PRESBYTERY OF FORDYCE, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN.

THE REV. FRANCIS WILLIAM GRANT, MINISTER. 
 


I- — Topography and Natural History. 
Name.— .In some cancient writings, the name of the town is given 
in each of the following ways,— BainifFe, BoinefFe, BainfFe, Banife, 
thus, most probably, drawing its origin from the word Bot/n, the 
name of a district in which Banff is situated. Boi/n found in older 
writings under all the different orthographies of Boynd, Boyne, 
Boynde, Boin, Bouyn, Buyne, Buyn, Boyen, is apparently the 
Gaelic word BuiJine, a stream ; and the district appears to have 
received its name from a stream passing through it, now called 
Burn of Boyne. On the bank of this stream, near its entrance in- 
to the sea, is the ancient castle of Boyne ; and the neighbouring 
parish of Boyndie was formerly called Inverboynde or Inverboin- 
dy, I. e. mouth of Boyn. Boyndie is pronounced Beendie or Bee- 
wze,— resembling, in this respect, the Gaelic word, more than its 
present orthography would seem to indicate. The sound of /-oc- 
curring in the word Banff, has probably originated from nothing 
more than a peculiarity of pronunciation,— as Murra/ is found to 
have bee at some former periods, spelled Murreff; Strathisla, 
btrathileff; Bailianj, Bailiareff. 

Ea:tent, Boundaries.~~The greatest length of the parish is about 
miles, its greateat breadth, which is nearly in the middle, about 
2 miles. Its superficial extent is probably below 9 square miles. 
As indicated by the measures now given, it is in shape lon and 
narrow but with a bend, the inner side of which is towards the 
east: the inland extremity tapering to a point exactly like a leaf. 
It lies longitudinally from N. E. to S. W. 

The parish is bounded on the north by the sea of the Moray 
Frith The river Doveran, for a distance of about a mile and a 
half from its entrance into the sea, forms the eastern boundary 
On the opposite side of the river, up to a rivulet falling into it about

half a mile from the sea, is the parish of Gamrie ; above the rivu- 
let is the parish of King Edward. From the point where it ceases 
to join the river, the parish of Banff is bounded, to its most souther- 
ly extension, by the parish of Alva; then, for a very small distance, 
by Marnoch ;— and, from that to the sea, by the parish of Boyn- 
die, from which it is, in part at least, divided by the burn of that 
name. 

Topographical Appearances.~ln the lower end of the parish, the 
ground rises in the centre to an elevation of from 200 to 300 feet 
above the level of the sea, forming an eminence called the Gal- 
lowhill, a prolongation of which stretches southerly, but gradual- 
ly descending, with a sweep, concave towards the east. In the up- 
per part of the parish, there are one or two eminences exceeding 
the Gallowhill in height, but, being less raised above the surface of 
the adjoining lower grounds, there considerably higher than the le- 
vel of the coast, they present merely the appearance of slight swel- 
lings, and the surface there is altogether of the most uninteresting 
character. On the east side, the Gallowhill slopes down into a 
fine plain or meadow, of about a mile and a-half long, enclosed within 
a circular bend of the river. On the north side, the slope being 
more gradual, necessarily makes a more abrupt termination as it 
approaches the sea, and the shore consists, in the parts more adja- 
cent to the river mouth, of precipitous rocky banks overhanging 
the beach ; more towards the west, there is left between the abrupt 
descent and the sea, a fine plain or links. On its western side, 
again, the Gallowhill declines gradually, but with occasional knolls 
and undulations, towards the burn of Boyndie. 

Near the town and harbour, low rocks stretch out into the sea 
from the beach; more to the west, and adjoining the mouth of the 
burn of Boyndie, is a sandy bay called Boyndie Bay. About mid- 
way between the extremes of the coast boundary, a rocky promon- 
tory is cleft in the middle into a sort of recess, called the Elf 
Kirk, about six or seven yards deep, and two yards broad, having 
perpendicular sides of rock to a considerable height. The recess 
has, however, rather the appearance of being scooped out by the 
action of the sea, than formed by the tearing asunder of its sides. 

River and Scenery.— The river Doveran takes its rise in the pa- 
rish of Cabrach, just on the confines between the counties of Aber- 
deen and Banff. Its source is 27 milesf due south of the mouth 

• Anciently the place of execution. 

t These distances all reckoned by the straight line are taken, somewhat loosely, 
from the scale on Irvine Ross's map. 



BANFF. . 3 

of the Spey, which is 2'2 miles west of Banff — thus making the ge- 
neral course of the Doveran to be nearly north-east, and the dis- 
tance from its source to its mouth 35 miles. But its course is far 
from a straight one. Thus, from Rothiemay to where it approaches 
Turriff, a distance of eleven miles, its course is, though with many 
meanderings, from west to east. From that point to Banfl" 9 miles 
its course is from south to north. Nearly a mile above the point 
where, passing from between the parishes of Alva and King Edward, 
the Doveran first touches the parish of Banff, it enters, with a sud- 
den turn, into a rocky gorge, whose precipitous sides crowned with 
wood are here joined by a semicircular stone arch. From this, the 
view stretches, above, into the open country, bounded by the hill 
of Alva ; below, it is closed by a succession of naked rocks and 
steep wooded banks, among which the stream is seen to lose itself. 
The grounds on the margin of the river continue abrupt and pre- 
cipitous, for nearly a mile farther down, when they gradually re- 
cede, opening out into a fine valley, round the eastern side of which 
the river takes a wide sweep, enclosing the plain on which Duff 
House is situated. Opposite to this plain, on the eastern side of 
the river, the ground is cut by the rivulet already mentioned, issu- 
ing from a woody ravine. Above, is a fine declivity, crowned on the 
top, and fringed along the water's edge, with wood; its surface diver- 
sified with breaks and swellings, and adorned with patches and rows of 
trees. Below, rises a green hill, presenting to the river and sea shore, 
a face of considerable height and steepness. The road from Edin- 
burgh and Aberdeen winds round the verge of its southern inclina- 
tion; and brings the traveller arriving in that direction, upon a pros- 
pect of rather uncommon attraction. On the extremity of the seaward 
slope of the hill, where it stretches out into a point skirting the bay, 
stands the town of Macduff. Just where the bend of the river com- 
mences, rises, on the western side, a high abrupt bank ; on the sum- 
mit of which, emerging from the gloom of a thicket, is a Gothic 
mausoleum, the burying place of the Fife family— near to which, 
on the verge of the bank, stands a funereal urn, containing bones 
dug up on the spot, of old the cemetery of a Carmelite monaste- 
ry. A little above, on the same side, is a remarkable round hill, 
which tradition represents as being artificial and the work of pe- 
nance, and which, now, crowned with a small summer-house or tem- 
ple, forms a striking accessory to the beauty of the scene. In one 
or two places, small islands, covered with wood, separate the stream 
of the river into branches; and its whole course between the two

bridges of Banff and Alva, a distance of two miles— all compre- 
hended in Lord Fife's park, affords a succession of beautiful or 
romantic scenes ; though even, perhaps, as it is, the " capabilities" 
of the ground have not received full justice : the walks not being 
always led with sufficient skill to catch the finest points of view, 
nor the necessary openings for the same purpose left in the wood. 

The breadth of the river where it washes this parish does not, 
perhaps, in any place, exceed 130 yards. Its depth is very un- 
equal, and liable to great fluctuations from shifting masses of sand 
and gravel. In some places, it runs in shallow streams ; in others 
there are pools of 10 or 12 feet, or even of greater depth. Under 
the arch of the bridge of Alva, where the stream is forcibly confin- 
ed, it is said to be of 15 fathoms depth. 

On some late occasions, the river, especially when aided bv 
high tides and northerly winds, has overflowed the low part of 
the town, and occasioned much mischief and inconvenience. In 
1799, in 1829, and in 1835, such inundations occurred, with a less 
considerable one between the two latter periods. On these occa- 
sions, there have been five or six feet of water in some of the streets, 
the inhabitants being rescued from their houses by boats. In 1829, 
three horses of the mail-coach were drowned, in attempting to pass 
through the Market-square. 

Springs. — The parish is well supplied with springs, and water 
may be found in most places by digging. In general, the water is 
slightly impregnated with carbonate of iron. There is a spring 
perceptibly chalybeate to the taste, about half a mile west of the 
town; and a very strong chalybeate of great use as a tonic 
about a mile farther west, in the parish of Boyndie. 

Geology and Mineralogy.  — The general direction of the strata 
within this parish is about from north-east to south-west ; and the 
parish being narrow, and running in a direction parallel to that of 
the strata, and including only within its range a limited number 
of beds of rock, affords but few remarkable geological features. 

The prevailing rocks are clay-slate and graywacke, although 
an intermixture of various other seams of rock is frequently met 
with. 

From the river mouth for about half a-mile, as far westward as 

 A high degree of liberality is shown by the Noble proprietor in the freedom 
granted to the jjublic, of walking in his grounds.

Boyndie bay, a bed of clay-slate is found reposing on graywacke ; 
the latter, at different points, protruding through the clay-slate, and 
rising, adjacent to the harbour, to the height of about forty feet. 
The clay-slate is found resting on the graywacke in a conform- 
able position, and following its windings in thin strata as far as 
they can be seen, till dipping or covered again by the soil or other 
beds of sand and shingle resting upon them. The elevation of the 
strata is different at different points. Where it is in conjunction 
with the graywacke, it may be at an elevation of from 60° to 80°, 
and gradually declining to a less angle of elevation as it recedes 
from the graywacke and approaches the surface of the bed of clay- 
slate. The clay-slate and graywacke at their junction alternate 
with each other in thin veins for a small space, and are intersper- 
sed occasionally with thin veins of graywacke slate. A Httle to the 
westward of the rock called the Elf Kirk, at low water-mark, a small 
portion of the old red sandstone formation makes its appearance, and 
seems, to the eastward, to be in conjunction with the graywacke. 
Above the old, rests a thin stratum of the new red sandstone ; but 
neither appear again at any other point within the parish. Adja- 
cent to the harbour, thin veins of quartz, in a variety of ramifica- 
tions, run through the graywacke. Around these veins the gray- 
wacke is changed to a brown, as if the heat of the quartz, poured 
in a liquid state into the crack, had changed its colour. The 
thickness of these quartz veins, in some places, mav be about a 
foot, decreasing in size, in the different ramifications, till they 
totally disappear. In general, the colour of the graywacke is chang- 
ed, m a greater or less degree, at all points where the veins of 
quartz are found. 

Towards the western side of the parish, there is a bed of mica- 
slate of a fine grain, resting on secondary gneiss, which is in con- 
junction, near Whitehills in the parish of Boyndie with the gray- 
wacke, on which it appears to be reposing. This bed affords many 
specimens of what is termed undulated mica-slate, and is travers- 
ed, farther to the westward, by thin veins of lime, which, below 
the flood-mark of the sea, is perforated with different kinds of pho- 
las, which pierce the vein till obstructed by a vein of gray wacke slate, 
or some other of the siliceous rocks. This bed soon enters the pa- 
rish of Boyndie, passing to the south-westward near Blair-shin- 
noch. 

The only point where granite appears, is at a place called Cairn 
ot Urd, the most south-westerly part of the parish. There, 



on a 



6 



BANFFSHIRE. 



piece of rising ground, the granite comes to the surface. In one 
part of the bed, the granite is excellent ; but in other parts, at the 
same point, it passes into secondary granite, or syenite, in which 
the quartz is either entirely wanting, or only found in very small 
quantities. The felspar is white and small-grained, and appears 
quite free from iron or any other colouring matter. Hence it re- 
tains its beautiful white colour, without being changed by the ac- 
tion of the atmosphere ; and, on that account, has been much 
esteemed for building. 

This rock passes into gneiss and coarse mica-slate, which ap- 
pears at different points a little to the eastward, but which has 
never been employed for any useful purpose. 

Various beds of sand, shingle, and clay, of different depths at 
different points, cover these strata; but none of them appear 
worthy of any remark, unless in so far as regards a bed of lias clay, 
which is found in patches at different points within the parish. 
This bed is of very considerable extent, stretching over a surface 
of more than twenty square miles. Belemnites and ammonites 
are found in it at all places where it has been wrought. It has 
lono- been wrought at Blackpots, a little to the westward of the 
boundary of this parish, for bricks and tiles, and also within the 
parish adjacent to the town, for the same purposes ; and the be- 
lemnite and ammonite have been found there in great abund- 
ance, as well as various other shells peculiar to that formation. 

There are no hornblende rocks in situ within the parish, but 
there is abundance of rolled blocks of that mineral scattered over 
the surface, as well as of hypersthene and augite. Rolled blocks of 
o-ranite, having the felspar red, are also found. Porphyritic horn- 
stone in water-worn nodules is also found on the moors and along 
the sea-beach. 

Alluvial deposits are very scanty, being mostly confined to a 
few patches along the line of the Doveran. 

The soils are extremely varied, partaking in some measure of 
the nature of the rocks on which they severally repose ; being, on 
the slate rock, of a clayey and soft nature, and very fertile. 

Meteorologij. — The climate is singularly changeable and capri- 
cious. At no time can a continuance of any particular sort of 
weather be in the least depended on. Winter is often compara- 
tively warm, and summer cold. In 1831, the difference between 
the temperature on the 24th June at half-past eight at night, 
and the 11th December at the same hour, was only 5°. In 



BANFF. 7 

] 832, in like manner, the thermometer stood so low as 50 on 
the 6th July ; so high as 49 on the 23d January, — on both occa- 
sions at half-past eight in the evening. May and June are general- 
ly characterized by severe droughts, and piercing northerly and 
easterly winds. The trees are scarcely in full leaf at midsummer; 
about which time, very often storms arise that blacken and wither 
their foliage. The steadiest and most pleasant weather is gene- 
rally in August and September. 

The following meteorological tables for the year 1832, are the 
result of observations taken under the direction of the Banff Sci- 
entific Institution.

mate,— cold and hot, dry and damp, succeeding each other ith 
the greatest rapidity and irregularity,— the town is not only subject 
to no peculiar complaints, nor to a peculiar severity of any com- 
plaints, but is in every respect, and in a high degree, healthy. 
What one would least expect in such a climate, pulmonary com- 
plaints are both rare, and of a gentle type when they do occur. 
Consumption is far from frequent. Hooping-cough is only found 
in a mild form. Patients in the latter complaint are often brought 
to this neighbourhood from some distance ; and, in the opinion of 
some, the locality is favourable to their recovery, in a degree be- 
yond what the mere change of air known to be always beneficial 
in this disorder can sufficiently account for. 

Zoology. — I. Mammalia. — This section of natural history does 
not seem to require any particular notice ; the animals compre- 
hended under it, in this parish, being such only as are common 
throughout the counties of Aberdeen, Banff, and Moray. It may, 
however, be remarked, that of late years several instances have oc- 
curred of the hedgehog Erinaceus EuropcBusJ f having been 
found in the parish, where at no distant period it was unknown. 
It is probable that this animal advances with the progress of cul- 
tivation, and especially with the planting of hedges and trees. The 
hare f Lepus timidus  is, on the contrary, and for the same reason, 
decreasing in numbers, especially in the more immediate vicinity 
of the town, and, it is conjectured, is retiring to those open grassy 
wastes, and sea side downs, which are more congenial to its habits. 
The roe-deer fCervus copreolus  is found wild in Lord Fife's woods. 

II. Birds.— l.Z/awi3zVr/5.— The red grouse  LagopvsScoticus 
is found sparingly in the upper and heathy districts of the parish. 
The partridge Perdix cinerea  is common, and we have been in- 
formed by a sportsman well versed in these matters, that he once 
met with a specimen of the quail  Coturnix vulgaris, in a cul- 
tivated part of this parish. The pheasant  Phasianus colchicus

ness of the Rev. James Smith, rector of Banff Academy. o . . 

+ The scientific names here given are taken from " Fleming's History of British 
Animals," published in 1828. That subdivision was necessary, and, to a great extent 
in the genera established by Linnaeus, cannot be doubted. It appears, however, to 
be questionable, whether, in the above-mentioned work, the learned author has not 
shewn a tendency to approach the opposite extreme, and to exalt unnecessarily, 
into distinct £-e«era, a number of animals which hitherto have ranked only as species. 
The frequent and excessive change of genera and species is one of the most annoying 
obstacles which the student of natural history has to encounter ; and, except where 
clearly and absolutely necessary, the practice ought as much as possible to be discoun- 
tenanced.

abounds in Lord Fife's plantations, and the ring-pheasant Pha- 
sianus torquatiis, now considered by naturalists as a distinct spe- 
cies, may there not unfrequently be met with. The ring-dove 
 Columha palumhiis  is abundant in every plantation. The rock- 
dove  Columba livia, J although frequent in the adjoining and 
rocky parish of Gamrie, is not to be found in this parish, the na- 
ture of the coast not being suited to its habits. The kestril Falco 
tinnunculus,  common. The merlin  Falco cesalon rare. The 
kite Milvus vulgaris, here called the glead, not common. The 
hen-harrier CVms cyaneus not common. The sparrow-hawk 
 Buteo nisus,  not uncommon. The horn-owl  Otus vulgaris ;  
the barn-owl  Aluco Jlammeus ; screech-owl  Strix stridula, 
common. The swallow Hirundo riistica ; the martin Hi- 
rundo urbica ; the sand martin  Hirundo riparia ;  the swift 
{Cijpselus apiis. In ordinary seasons, the first of the swallow 
tribe have been observed to arrive in this parish about the 10th of 
May. The goatsucker {Caprimulgus Europceus has been oc- 
casionally met with. The cinereous shrike {Lanius excuhitor, rare. 
The waxen chatterer {Bomhy cilia garrula, rare ; a specimen shot 
here preserved in the museum of the Banff Institution. The mis- 
sel-thrush  Turdus viscivorus has of late years increased in this 
part of the country, and is in some places as numerous as the common 
thrush {Tardus musicus. The fieldfare {Tardus pilaris, here 
called the Highland pyot, on the approach of winter descends 
in flocks from the more mountainous regions. The blackbird 
{Turdus merula, common. The dipper {Cinclus aquaticus, the 
water ouzel, common on the Doveran. Also the fallowchat 
{Saxicolaoenanthe, here called the chackert ; the whinchat 6a2co/a 
rubetra ; the red-breast {Sylvia rubecula ; the white-throat {Cur- 
ruca Sylvia ; the hedge-sparrow {Accentor modularis. The gol- 
den-crested wren {Regulus cristatus appeared here a few years ago, 
in a large flock, on the links, during winter. Its nest has been found 
in the top of a tall whin bush. The following also are found : 
The common wren {Troglodytes vulgaris. The white wagtail 
{Motacilla alba, here called the water wagtail. The yellow wag- 
tail {Motacillajiava not common. The sea titling {Anthus pe- 
trosus. The meadow titling {Anthus pratensis. The cross-bill 
{Loxia curvirostra has been occasionally met with. The yellow 
bunting {Emberiza citrinella, here called iheyellow ijirling. Com- 
mon bunting {Emberiza miliaria. The snow-bunting {Emberiza

nivalis, snow-flake, seen occasionally about the rocks in winter. 
The field-lark Alauda arvensis. Cole titmouse {Parus ater. 
Blue titmouse {Parus cceruleus. Bullfinch {Pyrrhula vulgaris. 
Green grosbeak {Coccothraustes chloris, provincially green linnet. 
House sparrow Pyrgita domestica. Chaffinch {Fringilla ccelebs. 
Brown linnet Fringilla cannahina, provincially Untie. Mountain 
finch {Fringilla montifringilla. Siskin {Fringilla spinus ; a win- 
ter visitant. Goldfinch {Fringilla carduelis. Starling {Sturmis 
vulgaris sometimes appears in flocks on the coast. Magpie {Pica 
caudata. Raven {Corvus corax, breeds near the bridge of Alva. 
Carrion crow [Corvus corone. Hooded-crow {Corvus corni. 
Jackdaw {Corvus monedula. Rook {Corvus frugilegus. Com- 
mon creeper {Certhia familiaris. Hoopoe {Upupa epops rare. 
The cuckoo {Cuculus canorus. 

2. Waders. — The following occur : The heron {Ardea cinerea. 
The bittern {Ardea stellaris. A beautiful specimen of this now rare 
bird was shot in 1831, a few miles from Banff, and is now in the mu- 
seum of the Institution. The crake or corncrake {Ortygometra crex. 
Common water hen  Gallinula chloropus. Curlew {Numenius arqua- 
to is sometimes to be seen among the rocks by the sea side. The 
whimbrel {Numenius pliceopus has been heard in this parish fly- 
ing overhead, being easily distinguishable by its singular notes ; 
but has never been observed on the ground, nor as a regular vi- 
sitant of the parish. Throughout this part of the country, ge- 
nerally, it is much less frequent than its congener the curlew. The 
woodcock {Scolopax rusticola. The great snipe {Scolopax major. 
A snipe, described, by the gentleman who shot it in this parish a 
few years ago, as much larger than any he had ever seen, is sup- 
posed to have been a specimen of this rather rare bird. The com- 
mon snipe {Scolopax gallinago is decreasing fast, in this and the 
adjoining parishes, in consequence of the improvements in agri- 
culture, and especially the draining of marshy and boggy ground. 
Jack-snipe {Scolopax gallinula.  Lapwing {Vanellus cristatus, 
here called the ewc/iet Grayplower {Squatarola cinerea. San- 
derling {Calidris arenaria. Golden plover {Charadrius pluvialis 
descends to the sea shore in storms. Ringed plover [Charadrius 
hiaticula, provincially sanny laverock. Oyster-catcher {HcEma- 
topus ostralegus. 

• Dunlin Tringa alpina  in this part of the country called the dorhk. Purple 
sandpiper  Tringa striata, has been observed on the rocks, near the harbour, dur- 
ing spring. Not common. Figured by Bewick as the knot.

3. Water Birds. — Cormorant {Phalacrocorax carho. Shag 
{Phalacrocorax graculiis, provincially scart. Gannet {Sula Bassana 
solan goose, is frequently to be seen in the bay here. Golden 
eye duck {Claiigulavulgaris a winter visitant of the Doveran, where 
it may be seen in considerable numbers. Long-tailed duck [Clan- 
gula glacialis, here called coal and candle lights frequent dur- 
ing winter in the bay, but never enters the river. In a calm day, 
their singular cries, resembling the words coal and candle light, may 
be heard all over the bay.  Scaup duck [Ngroca marila, in 
severe winters sometimes appears in considerable numbers on the 
Doveran, where it is known by the name of Norwegian teal. On 
its first arrival from the north, it suffers itself to be closely ap- 
proached, but soon becomes more wary. Common mallard or 
wild duck [Anas boschas, found in great numbers on the Doveran, 
in Lord Fife's grounds, where no one is allowed to molest them. 
The wigeon {Anas penelope. The cracker or pintail duck {Anas 
acuta. The writer of this has never seen but a single specimen 
of this duck on the Doveran, during the course of nine or ten years. 
It occurred in 1830, and associated with a flock of the common wild 
duck. Gargany or summer teal {Anas querquedida ; a single speci- 
men only of this duck has been met with within the writer's know- 
ledge. The teal {Anascrecca is found in winter in great numbers near 
the bridge of Alva. Brent goose {Anser brenta : a fine specimen of 
this goose was shot, near the sea coast a few years ago. The wild 
swan {Cggniisferus. Goosander {Mergus merganser. Insevere win- 
ters, these beautiful birds maybe seen on the Doveran sometimes in 
flocks. The red-breasted goosander {Mergus serrator has never 
been observed on the Doveran, but a specimen was shot some time 
ago among the rocks at some distance from Banff". The razorbill auk 
{Alca torda, and the puffin {Fraterculaarctica, are frequently to be 
seen in the bay, and along the shore ; making excursions from those 
stupendous rocks on the adjoining parish of Gamrie, where is to 
be seen one of the most extensive and most magnificent breedino- 
places of these and other birds, known by the name of sea fowl. 
Little grebe {Podiceps minor. Northern diver {Colymbus glaci- 
alis ; a specimen, in possession of a gentleman in this town, 
weighed, when killed, twelve pounds. The guillemot, here called 
the queet, {Uria troile, and the Greenland dove, or black guil- 

' Pochard  Nyroca ferina a specimen of the male of this species w.as killed 
during this winter rather a severe one on a-mill dam in this parish. White eve 
or castaneous duck  Nyroca kucoptluilmos, a very rare visitant. '

lemot, {Cephas grylle, here called the testie, may often be seen 
in the bay. The arctic skua {Cataractes parasiticus. Black-back- 
ed gull {Larus marinus. Herring gull {Larus argentatus here 
called the from its cry. Common gull LarMsca;z5. Kit- 
tiwake {Larus rissa, provincially kittg, one of the sea foivl found 
in greatest abundance on the Gamrie rocks. Common tern or 
sea swallow, {Sterna hirundo provincially /'I'AtorrocA, not resident 
in this parish, but may occasionally be seen on its way to flat and 
sandy coasts, its usual places of abode. 

III. Fishes. — The sea lamprey  Petromyzon marinus has 
been occasionally caught. It is termed the lamper eel. Common 
dog-fish  Spinax acanthiasJ caught in immense quantities dur- 
ing the herring season, and sold by the cart-load for manure to 
the ground. The thornback skate f Raia clavata. The common 
skate {Raia batis. Sturgeon {Acipenser sturio. A sturgeon, 
about 5 feet in length, was caught in the bay in the summer of 
1833. Salmon Salmo salar. Bull-trout {Salmo eriox and SaZ- 
mo hucho. The bull-trout occurs occasionally in the Doveran. 
Sea-trout {Salmo trutta found in great numbers. Finnock {Sal- 
mo albus. also found in great numbers, and by the most expe- 
rienced judges regarded as a species perfectly distinct from any 
other of the genus Salmo. Common burn-trout {Salmo fario. 
Herring {Clupea harengus ; taken in great quantities from about 
the middle of July to the middle of September. Gar fish, sea- 
needle or sea-pike, {Belone vulgaris. Minnow {Leuciscus phoxi- 
nus. Lump-fish, cock-padle, Q/cZo/ferMstojo«s. Common cod 
{Morhua vulgaris. Haddock {Morhua cBgleJinus. Whitehills, a 
fishing village in the vicinity, is famous for its smoked or yellow 
haddocks. These by many are reckoned equal, if not superior, to 
the celebrated Finnon haddocks. Ling {Molva vulgaris. not so 
frequent as the cod and haddock. Whiting {Merlangus vulgaris. 
Coal fish {Merlangus carbonarius. The young in their least state 
are called gerracks, afterwards jooi/ze5, sethes, &amp;c. Turbot {Pleuro- 
nectes maximus, here called the roan Jleuk. Till of late years 
the value of this fish was but little known as an article of food, 
and by the fishermen themselves it is still but little esteemed for 
that purpose. It is, however, now eagerly bought up by those 
who are fond of good living. Brill {Pleuronectes rhombus ; but 
little inferior to the preceding species, for which it is not unfre- 
quently taken. Sole {Solea vulgaris, not common. Plaice {Pla-

tessa vulgaris, here called joZas jieuk. Flounder {Platessa Jiesus, 
here called ff7'€7/ jievk. Holibut {Hippoglossus vulgaris, here cal- 
led turhot. Common eel [Anguilla vulgaris. Common launce, 
{Ammoclytes tobianus ; Sand-eel, or, as it is here termed, sannel. 
Blade-fish [Trichiurus lepturus. In the autumn of 1829, a fish, 
supposed to be of the above species, was found among the rocks 
near this place, dead, but in a perfect state of preservation. It 
measured about 6 feet in length, and about 20 inches in breadth, 
where widest. The dorsal fin was of a brilliant red, and extend- 
ed the whole length of the back. The body was of a silvery 
bluish -white appearance. The head was not unlike, in miniature, 
to that of a horse. The body was excessively compressed, being 
scarcely more than three or four inches thick. Sea perch {Ser- 
ranus Norvegicus, not uncommon at particular seasons of the year. 
Wolf fish {Anarhichas hipus, here called the sea cat. Angler 
{Lophius piscatorius, here called the sea devil, on account of its 
hideous appearance. Gray gurnard {Trigla gurnardus, here 
called the croonach. Gray mullet [Mugil cephalus. This fish 
is frequently taken here : it seems to delight in a rocky bottom. 
Mackerel {Scomber vulgaris, found here during the herring fish- 
ery in great numbers. John Doree Zeusfaber. Mr Robinson 
informs me, that about half a dozen of this rare fish were caught 
in his salmon bag-net, in the summer of 1834, and two others dur- 
ing last summer. Stickleback {Gasterosteus aculeatus, here cal- 
led banstickle. 

The bay here abounds with shrimps {Cancer crangon, which 
have been occasionally fished for with success. 

The mussel {Mgtilus edulis is not a native of this coast. Im- 
mense numbers of them, however, are annually brought by the 
fishermen from the shores of the Cromarty Frith, and are deposited 
among the rocks here, for the purpose of being afterwards used for 
bait. The lobster  Cancer gammarus is abundant, and also the crab 
{Cancer pagurus, here called joarew. The crab, however, obtain- 
ed here is not reckoned nearly so good as those brought to the 
Aberdeen market. A specimen of the cuttle-fish {Loligo offici- 
nalis, is occasionally seen. 

Botany.— The parish has never been made the subject of an ex- 
act botanical survey; but, comprehending as it does, hill and dale, 
wood, water, and sea-coast, with no small variety of soil and expo- 
sure. It no doubt possesses an extensive and interesting Flora. The 
plants of the parish of Banff are, however, confined to the " woody

region," or " agricultural and upland zones," as fixed by Hewett 
Watson ; for no part of it is sufficiently high for Carex rigida ; and 
although Corylus avellana, which is found in the lower grounds, 
ceases in the upper, Callujia vulgaris grows vigorously at the 
highest point. Of the plants observed in the parish, the following 
are chiefly worth enumerating :—Adoxa moschatellina, Agrhnonia 
Eupatorium Arenaria rubra, Cardamine amara, Gymnadenia co- 
nopsea, Habenaria bifolia, Hyadnthus non-scriptus, Lepidium 
Smithii, five or six species of Hypericum, Polygonum viviparum., 
Trientalis Europcea, &amp;c. Upon the coast in the immediate 
neighbourhood of the town, we have Arenaria marina and peploi- 
des, Cochlearia officinalis, Glaux maritima, Plantago Coronopus, 
with the beautiful Lithospermum maritimum, and the rather rare 
Bhjsmus rufus. To these may be added Pijrethrum maritimum, 
for which, indeed, one of the oldest recorded British stations is 
« rocks at Doun, near Banff, in Scotland." The most interesting 
feature, however, in the Flora of the parish, is undoubtedly Scilla 
verna, spring squill, with its fine blue fragrant flowers, which was 
discovered in spring 1835, by Mr George Campbell Smith. The 
species has long been known to be frequent in Orkney, Shetland, 
and the western parts of Britain, but it was considered very rare 
upon our eastern coasts, and, indeed, was not known to occur there 
until a few years ago. Digitalis purpurea abounds in the parish, 
and is used for medical purposes. 

Planting.— Bu House park, extending along the river side for 
a stretch of above two miles, and having many rides or paths 
branching out into the adjacent country, contains a considerable 
extent of ornamental planting ; the south-eastern and western slopes 
of the Gallowhill are also partially wooded. A few large ash trees 
near the principal gate of Duff House park are supposed to have 
been in existence since the Airly family resided there. The sod 
of the parish though perhaps not in a high degree adapted for 
■ timber of any sort permits the growth of every species of forest 
tree, particularly larch and Scotch fir. Unfortunately, however, 
the greater part of its surface is directly exposed to the fierce blasts 
that sweep over the north sea, so that planting only thrives m 
the few localities that afford a little shelter in that direction. Trees 
exposed to the north are almost invariably bare on their northern 
side, and bend their branches towards the opposite quarter, as if 
turning away from the fury of their ruthless enemy

II. — Civil History. 
Documents. — There is a manuscript, entitled " History of the 
Town and Parish of Banff," written about the end of the last cen- 
tury, by the late William Rose, Esq. of Mountcoffer, a gentleman 
noted for his singular acquaintance with the history of landed pro- 
perty and proprietors in the north of Scotland. It is now in the 
possession of his son, Patrick Rose, Esq. Sheriff-clerk of the coun- 
ty, who has kindly allowed the use of it to the writers, both of this 
and the former Statistical Account of the parish — into one or other 
of which accounts much of its contents have been transferred. 

A variety of papers relative to the former circumstances and 
transactions of the burgh have also been left by the late William 
Reid, Esq. town-clerk : with the use of which the compiler of this 
Account has been favoured. A good many of these relate more 
exclusively to municipal concerns ; the others are chiefly extracts 
from Mr Rose's manuscript, with additional remarks. 

Parochial Registers. — The earliest date of the parochial registers 
is 1620. The registers are pretty voluminous, and seem to have 
all along been kept with regularity. 

Surveys, Src. — There does not appear to have been any survey ever 
made of the parish, as a parish. The estates of each of the different 
proprietors have been surveyed, but none of them lately, with the ex- 
ception of that of Sir Robert Abercromby. There is a six-sheet 
map of the counties of Aberdeen, Banff, and Kincardine, with parts 
of adjoining counties, on the scale of an inch to an English statute 
mile, published in 1822 by James Robertson, A.M. F.R. S. It 
has a table of the superficial contents of each parish, and of the 
height of the most remarkable hills. It also delineates the varie- 
ties of surface, &amp;c. There is also a four-sheet map of the coun- 
ties of Aberdeen and Banff, on a scale of two-thirds of an inch to 
a British statute mile, by Alexander Irvine Ross, land-surveyor, 
published in 1826. Perhaps there may be other maps. 

Transactions.— The history of the parish is rather destitute of 
interest. Beyond the various revolutions of property, it presents 
few materials for narrative. Certain of the lands of which it con- 
sists, seem anciently to have constituted part of two different thane- 
doms— that of Boyne, and that of Mowbray. The thanedom of 
Boyne belonged, in the time of Robert Bruce, to Randolph Earl 
of Moray, and subsequently passed to the Ogilvies, a branch of 
the family of Deskford. The thanedom of Mowbray which in-

eluded part of Inchdrewer and some adjoining lands, belonged, 
at one time, to the Barclays of Towie. Walter Barclay, of this 
family, was sheriff of Banff in 1304. Another part of Inchdrewer 
probably comprehended in the lands of Strathalva belonged, in 
1414, to Alexander Lindsay,' Earl of Crawford, from whom it 
passed to the Ogilvies of Auchterhouse. Margaret Ogilvie of 
this family inheriting the lands of Strathalva and Doune, married 
James Stewart, Earl of Buchan, brother of James II. ; and these 
lands were then formed into a new thanedom, called Glendowa- 
chie, or the Glen of Dow ;  Banff Castle being at the same time 
made the messuage of the earldom of Buchan, and thanedom of 
Glendowachie. 

The town lands included all that is now called the liberties of 
the burgh, or burgh roods, that is, a tract extending along the 
whole sea coast boundary of the parish, and from half a mile to 
two miles inland, but excepting out of this the immediate demesnes 
of the castle which was a constabulary and the church lands. 
The town also possessed the river fishings for an extent of some 
miles, except two nets nearest the river mouth, one of which, with 
the sea fishing to the east, belonged to the Earl of Buchan, as 
holding the thanedom of Glendowachie, the other to the thane 
of Boyne. To the town belonged the sea fishing opposite to and 
west of, the river mouth as far as the western boundary of the parish. 

Prior to the year 1470, the town's lands and fishings seem to have 
been all enjoyed in a state of common. . In that year, in order to de- 
fray certain public expenses,-f- the fishings were let out to individual 
burgesses on leases of nineteen years. In 1595, the salmon fish- 
ings and the greater part of the lands were by virtue of a royal 

• This is the Gaelic word signifying black. Dowerane or Doveran is Hack water 
—still the name of the river at its source. Doune or Dowan, the name of the estate 
on which Macduff is situated, and Dow, or Dait-haugh, on which Duff House stands, 
are probably from the same root. 

\ " For the infefting and fundanation makkin of a perpetuale chaplainry to sing

the King and the Quyne, their predecessors and successors, the founders, for all

buthe, and for quhat the burgh has not substance." James Ogilvie of Deskford, for 
three nets of the water was to pay L. 6, and "bound to defend the burgh in their 
guid and honest quarrelles and freedom of the water, and if masterly vaxit, to bring 
the fish back fra the vaxars." 

On an occasion of leasing the fishings that occurred in 1551, " a nett of the King's 
water and an aughten part of Urack name of a particular fishing in the river were 
given to Elizabeth Ord to be reserved to Marjory Grantully, her guddame, beand

charter obtained for that special purpose let out in perpetuity at 
a small annual feu-duty, which, however, appears to have been the 
actual rent at the time. 

Land-owners. — The principal landholders at present are, the 
Earl of Fife, Earl of Seafield, and Sir Robert Abercromby of Birk- 
enbog, grandson, by the mother's side, of the last Lord Banff. 

To a comparatively late period, the town seems to have been a 
very insignificant place, little more than a fishing village, an ap- 
pendage to the monastery and castle. The streets were not paved 
before 1551 ; and, at the beginning of the succeeding century, few 
houses besides Lord Airhe's, Lord Banff's, and the Laird of Auch- 
medden's houses, were slated. The harbour was formerly within 
the river. 

Historical Events.—The town has never been connected with any 
historical event of importance, but some visitations to which it was 
subjected in the troublous times of old, have no doubt been reckoned 
of sufficient importance by the inhabitants. Spalding relates that in 
Marcher April 1644, " There went down to Banff the lairds' of 
Gight, Newtown, and Ardlogie, with a party of forty horse and mus- 
keteers, brave gentlemen. They took in the town, without contradic- 
tion, meddled with the keys of the tolbooth, took free quarters and 
plundered all the arms they could get, buff-coats, pikes, swords 
carabines, pistols, yea, and money also. They took frae Alexan-

der Winchester, one of the bailhes, 700 merks, whilk he had as 
one of the collectors of the taxations and loan-silver of Banff; and 

siklike took frae him 400 merks of his own gear ; and frae - 

Shand in Down, they plundered some monies. They caused their 
baillies for Dr Douglas, their provost, had fled, and townsmen, 
subscribe and swear the band, denying the last covenant, and ob- 
liging them to follow the king and his deputies, in his service, as 
ve have before. They took also frae George Geddes, another of 
the said four collectors, 500 merks of taxation and loan -silver ; and 
Gight keeped all the monies." 

The upshot of this transaction, so far as " Gight" was concern- 
ed, is told in the following words : from which we gather that the 
good laird's purposes had been sorely misinterpreted by a censo- 
rious world. It is to be feared that even Baillie Winchester him- 
self may have been vexed with some ungenerous suspicions. 

« Now the parliament goes on against Sir George Gordon of 
Gight, and John Gordon, his brother, who was also had over with 
him to Edinburgh. He is accused upon divers matters, but de- 
nies all ; he is accused upon the plundering of Banff, whilk he de- 
nied, except some monies he received in horroicing upon promise of 
restitution. It is referred to his oath ; he depones conform, and 
subscribes his deposition ; they craftily summoned over witnesses 
out of Banff, to prove him perjured, and thereby guilty of death ; 
at last his process is continued to the 8th of January 1645, that 
the parliament should sit down, through whilk delay he escaped 
prison." 

In 1645 the Marquis of Montrose seems to have bethought 
himself of negotiating a loan among the capitalists of Banff- 
doubtless on the same sort of terms, as to interest and security, as 
erewhile in use with that eminent financier the laird of Gight. 

" Thereafter he marches to Banff, plunders the same pitifully, 
no merchant's goods nor gear left; they saw no man on the street 
but was stripped naked to the skin. Some two or three worthless 
houses were burnt, but no blood shed, and so they left Banff." 

The visitation of the laird of Gight and the other " brave gen- 
tlemen" seems to have been mere child's play to this. There 
is yet extant a " humble supplication of the distresst burgh of 
Banff," made " Unto the Honourable and High Court of Parlia- 
ment," in 1647, and which " Humbly sheweth— That for our zea- 
lous affection, adherence, and concurrence to the covenant, and

extending our utmost powers for prosecuting the ends of that 
same, we have not only spent ane great part of our means in keep- 
mg of the dyets that were ever in the north, as we were desyrit 
be those who were authorized to require us yearly, but likewise at 
last our haill means, both horses, nolt, cloaths, corn, and merchant 
guids with our buiths, none whereof having been gotten removit, 
were all spolizit and away taken be James Graham, and his most 
cruel, unnatural, and merciless associates, in the month of March 
1645— our plenishing of timber all burnt, with some of the houses 
in our toun, so that nothing was left unto us except the bare walls 
of the houses ; and thereafter, when we were in small and mean con- 
dition, we were striving to live thereafter be the assistance of our 
well affected friends and countrymen, there did still fall upon us, 
ever as they had occasion to be in the country, and never was we 
free either of them, in special the name of Gordon Harthill, Lod- 
wick Lmdsay, or Captain Mortimer, or otherways we were not 
free of our awn forces, the one coming in upon us, as the others 
were removit, even untill this day, as is notourly known, &amp;c."— « So 
that now our condition is so miserable that we have nothing where- 
by either to labour our land, or use our trade, and dare not any of 
us frequent or haunt any burgess by reason of our debts restand 
be us for the guids that were taken from us, for fear of the ward- 
ing of our persons."—'' And now our kirk, tolbuith, scholl, ferry- 
boat, and all being demolisht and broken doun, we have no kind 
of subsistence neither for ourselfs to live, neither to repair these 
common works." The supplication, after stating that the burgh had 
debts of nearly 9000 merks, adds-" All the haill foresaid sums 
having been spent upon commissers to the General Assemblies 
and Parliaments for entering of our proportion of our levies to 
England, and for the expenses of mayn guards and watches when 
General- Major Middleton, Lieutenant-Colonel Hew Montgomery 
Lieutenant- Colonel John Home, Colonel Robert Montgomery' 

and Lockhart, and the foot regiments belonging to the Earl 

of Lowthean, and Lairds of Lawers and Buchanan, were at seve- 
ral occasions quartered in our town, and sundry sums of money 
taken from us be several officers, to hold us free of quartering of 
horses when our corns were growing on the ground, being even 
threatned whether they had orders or not, with plundering of our 
houses, and destroying of our cornes." In the concludino- peti 
tion for relief, a shrewd hint is given how to lay the saddle on the 
right horse, thus: « And that your Honours will give us warrant

been actually airt and part, or personally assistant to the away 
taking of our said means, or any part thereof, in this bygan tyme, 
and quha one or all of them are partly lying in our toun in a worse 
disposition nor ever they were of before." The copy is indorsed 
" Supplicatione, Toun of Banff Bodies 1647." The petitioners 
obtained a grant of their own excise as a means of relief. 

The Duke of Cumberland's troops passed through Banff on the 
10th November 1746, on their way to Culloden. The only ex- 
ploits by which they signalized their visit were, the destruction of 
the Episcopal chapel, and the execution, or rather murder, of a 
poor man named Alexander Kinnaird, from Culvie, in the parish 
of Marnoch. Being found with a stick notched, or seen notch- 
ing it, in a way supposed to take account of the boats passing the 
river with troops, he was taken for a spy, and immediately hanged 
on a tree, near the site of the present chief hotel. 

The last warlike visitation that befel the town was in the year 
1759, when Thurot, a French commodore, appeared off the coast, 
with intentions which were at once conjectured to bode no aug- 
mentation of the common good. The Provost, wisely considering 
this an emergency in which the united wisdom of the community 
should be called to exercise itself in the most solemn mode known 
or in use, forthwith convened a head court of the burgh. Here, 
however, dumb consternation was found to prevail — every one look- 
ing unutterable things on his neighbour. Luckily, in this prostra- 
tion of the faculties of the " whole heritors, feuars, burgesses, and 
other inhabitants liable to stent and taxation," who composed the 
court, there was one person capable of forming a determination, 
and this, as became his high dignity, was the Provost. His opi- 
nion being anxiously called for, was given with instant promptitude 
in favour of — running away  — A somewhat less decisive course, 
however, found favour in the eyes of one of the bailies, namely, 
that an endeavour should be made to compound with the foe for a 
certain sum ; but to this the Provost objected, that, as such a sum 

• A friend of the compiler's, who had lately occasion to inspect the town's records, 
has remarked it as a curious circumstance, that there is not a syllable to be found in 
them which could indicate that the country was not, at that period, in a state of the 
most profound calm ; and shrewdly conjectures, that the magistrates had, with the 
characteristic caution of the nation, purposely avoided committing themselves by any 
written expression of opinion, which might stand in the way of their joining the party 
that should eventually prevail.

as would be accepted could not be immediately raised, hostaoes 
would inevitably be required — and who was to be thought worthy 
of this distinction  This difficulty appeared to the court a mere 
bagatelle. « The Provost"— was at once shouted fi •om all quarters ; 
to the chief-magistrate, as of right, the honour in question was 
tendered by acclamation ; but, by that dignitary, most resolutely 
declined, and cordially offered to the bailie, out of whose proposal 
the occasion for conferring it had originated. Luckily in the 
course of the deliberations, or at least before the enemy had op- 
portunity to secure any contributions, a means of deliverance more 
effectual than any which burghal wisdom had succeeded in devis- 
mg, arose in the shape of a severe storm, which compelled the 
marauder to take his departure, leaving his anchors behind him 
for a memorandum,— some of which, it is said, were lately found. 
 Subsequently to this, the idea seems to have occurred, that a few 
eighteen and twenty-four pound guns, planted on the heights above 
the harbour, might facihtate any negociations, for which occasion 
might chance to arise, with visitors of this description ; and accord- 
mgly the town expended the sum of L. 400 for the interest of 
which, by the way, we are assessed to this day, in constructing a 
battery, guns being furnished by government, and certain of the 
citizens trained to work them. The battery was dismounted of 
Its guns at the peace; and we have perhaps reason to reckon our- 
selves as safe without an enemy as with our guns. 

Persons of note.— On\y two persons of any note have been con- 
nected with this parish ; and their respective histories present some 
curious points of contrast and resemblance. 

James Sharp, the famous Archbishop of St Andrew was 
born ,n Banff Castle in May 1613. His father son of David 
bharp, a merchant in Aberdeen, was Sheriff-clerk of Banff 
shire ; his mother a daughter 6f the laird of Kininvie. He studied 
at Aberdeen, and gave early proofs of superior talents. He 
afterwards visited the English universities, where he formed an 
acquaintance with several eminent divines. After his education 
was completed, he was, by the interest of the Earl of Rothes to 
whom he was related, elected a Professor of Philosophy in St An- 
drews. He was, at a subsequent period, appointed Professor of 
Divinity in the same University ; and was also, at one time, mini- 
s er of Craill, in Fifeshire, an office which he is said to have dis 
charged with dihgence, fidelity, and kindness. In the course of 



22

the religious and political disputes of his times, he v/cis sent on a 
mission to Oliver Cromwell, which he executed with such appa- 
rent skill as to draw from the shrewd Protector the remark, that 
" this gentleman might well, according to a Scottish phrase, be de- 
nominated Sliarp of that Ilk''' The succeeding events and tragi- 
cal termination of his life are matter of general history. A letter 
from his son Sir William Sharp of Stonyhill, to Sir James Baird at 
Banff, describing the circumstances of the archbishop's murder, 
will be found in the former Statistical Account, Volume xx. 
p. 373. 

James Macpherson was an illegitimate branch of the family of 
Invereshie in Inverness-shire. His mother was a gipsy. He was 
reared at his father's house until the death of the latter, when he 
was taken under his mother's charge, and acquired the habits and 
pursuits of the race to which she belonged. He was remarkable 
not only for strength and beauty of person, but for the degree of 
talent which he displayed for certain mental accomplishments, for 
the cultivation of which his mode of life might seem to have af- 
forded little opportunity. I am not, aware that any of his poetical 
productions are known to exist except his Lament ; but he seems 
to have been celebrated, during his lifetime, for his skill on the 
violin. It is said, too, that his conduct often afforded evidence 
of his being imbued with those feelings of generosity and pity which 
the fine arts are supposed to generate ; and it does not appear that 
any cruel or atrocious act was ever laid to his charge. After se- 
veral escapes from justice, to which he had made himself obnoxious 
by his lawless habits, he was eventually apprehended by the Laird 
of Braco and some of his followers at a Keith market : Braco him- 
self being the first to seize upon him. So desperate, however, is 
said to have been his resistance, aided by one Peter Roy, that it 
wfs only by blankets being thrown over his head from the windows 
above, that his numerous assailants could obtain any advantage 
over him. He was thus compelled to fly ; and seeking to reach 
the gable of the church, parrying the attack of his enemies by the 
way, he fell over a grave-stone, when he was secured, and lodged 
in the jail of Banff. His sword is yet in the possession of Lord 
Fife Brace's descendant, at Duff House, and is a weapon of such 
weight as only a most powerful man could wield. M'Pherson 
was brought to trial along with James Gordon and Peter and 
Donald Brown, before the Sheriff of Banff, on the 7th November

1700. A claim was put in on behalf of the Laird of Grant for re- 
pledging the two Browns, as being his vassals, and subject to his 
jurisdiction ; and on this claim, and on some preliminary objec- 
tions urged by the prisoners' counsel, an argument ensued of con- 
siderable length, and apparently by no means wanting in legal 
knowledge or acuteness. In an interlocutor, the Sheriff " sustains 
himself judge, notwithstanding the offer to repledge, in respect to 
the answer thereto, as being knoune habit and repute wagabonds, 
soroners, and Egiptians; and repellsall the rest of the defences and 
replyes, in respect of the answer, except that of robberie, which 
he does not sustain himself judge in ; and finds the libel relevant 
as to the rest of the articles, of being knoune habit and repute 
to be Egiptians and wagabonds, and keeping ye mercats in yr 
ordinarie manner of thieving and purse-cutting, or guiltie of the 
rest of the crimes of theft, and masterfuU bangstree and oppres- 
sion, to infer the punishment lybelled, and admitts the same to the 
knowledge of ane assyze." After the jury were impannelled "the 
Sheriff' so it is in the record " ordains the pannels for the sa- 
tisfaction of the assizers to rehearse the Lord's prayer," &amp;c. but 

it is not stated how far the prisoners either did or could afford this 
"satisfaction." Twenty-one witnesses were then examined, four- 
teen of whom were able to sign their depositions. Most of them 
depone, that the pannels were habit and repute Egyptians, and that 
these Egyptians went about armed in bands; some adding, that 
they spoke a language which the deponents did not understand, 
and " which was not Irish." But otherwise few well-defined or 
very serious charges appear in evidence against the accused indi- 
vidually. The evidence being heard, the jury, of which James

The most extraordinary part of the transaction is, that the guilt 
or innocence of the " three young rogues" seems to have been 
thought a matter not worth inquiring about. There is no appear- 
ance whatever of their having been named in the indictment, or 
produced in court, or of any endeavour to identify them or charge 
them with a crime. The mere fact of their being in prison, the 
good Sheriff seems to have thought " relevant to infer the pains 
of law." Very possibly, however, the " young rogues" may have 
got substantial, though not formal, justice. 

The two Browns were sentenced, on the 21st February follow- 
ing, to be hanged on the 2d April. It appears, however, that 
M'Pherson alone of the four was executed. Probably Gordon was 
pardoned. The Browns are thought to have escaped. M'Pher- 
son performed at the foot of the gallows, the " Rant" and Pibroch 
of his own composition, and then made offer of his violin to any 
one who would receive it as a remembrance of him. The gift 
being declined, he broke the violin, and threw the fragments into 
the grave prepared for his body. 

The story of M'Pherson's being executed before the time spe- 
cified in the sentence, in order to prevent his being benefited by an 
expected reprieve, is discredited. 

Antiquities.— The parish is almost wholly destitute of any re- 
mains of antiquity. Two cells of the Carmelite monastery men- 
tioned as existing at the time of the last Statistical Account have 
for several years been removed, and given place to modern houses. 
Not far from the site of these, a small vaulted chamber, supposed 
to have been a sleeping cell, now affords accommodation to the 
boiler of a steam-engine employed at the foundery. Some arches, 
apparently parts of similar cells, yet exist behind the inn called the 
Royal Oak ; and persons alive till a late period remembered of 
there having been a continuous line of such cells between the two 
points now indicated. This range of cells seems to have terminat- 
ed the buildings of the monastery to the east, unless that an hos- 
pital, of which there is a tradition as existing about the site of the

veral of the above particulars I owe to a notice in the New Monthly Magazine, Vol. 
i and a note to " M'Pherson's Lament" in the Ettrick Shepherd's edition of Burns. 
One very old man informs me of being told by his grandfather, who was one of the 
sruards at M'Pherson's execution, that the verses commonly circulated as spoken by 
M'Pherson on that occasion were really those uttered by him. A few of them that 
were repeated by my informant, corresponded most if I rightly recoUect with the 
first set given by the Ettrick Shepherd.— The execution took place on the Gallowhill.

present bede-house, may have formed one of its appurtenances. 
The yards or garden grounds of the monastery, with its chapels 
and other dependencies, are supposed to have extended beyond the 
present southern hmits of the town, and as far as the small rem- 
nants of the " Lodging" of the Earl of Airly in Duff House kit- 
chen garden. 

The precise time when this religious house was first established 
here is uncertain. It is supposed, on what authority I know .not, 
to have been as early as the time of Malcolm the Maiden, or even 
of Malcolm Canmore. The charter granted by Robert Bruce 
evidently implies that it had existed before, probably long before, 
the date of that instrument, since it goes merely to confirm " Deo, 
beatae Mariae virgini, et religiosis viris Fratribus de Monte Car- 
mele, capellam beatae Mariae juxta villam de Banff, una cum solo 
ad eandem capellam pertinente, ad sedificandum ibidem Ecclesiam 
et aliis domos sui ordinis, et ad inhabitandum dom. locum cum fra- 
tribus ejusdem ordinis, prout a summa pontifice eiisdem fratribus 
speciahter est concessum ; praeterea damns et concedimus hac pre- 
senti cart nostra confirmationis, fratribus ibidem deo servienti- 
bus, et servituris, illam davatam terrae cum pertinentiis quae ad 
dictam capellam ante presentem collationem nostram pertinere so- 
lebat, ad inveniendum panem vinum et ceram ad cultum domini 
ibidem devotius exercendum." 

It is not perfectly clear whether the chapel of the blessed Mary 
here mentioned was one on the present site of Lord Fife's mau- 
soleum, or the old church formerly called St Mary's on the bury- 
ing ground of the town, but more probably the latter. 

At the time of the Reformation, it is well known that many of 
the religious houses, foreseeing the difficulty of preserving their 
possessions, adopted the plan of feuing them out at a low considera- 
tion to powerful laymen; and a ready chapman of this description 
seems to have presented himself to the Carmelite brethren in the 
person of Sir Walter Ogilvie of Dunlugas,-an individual who ap- 
pears to have been gifted with a rare urn for the acquisition of 
property. In a charter dated 1544, the friars make over to Sir 
Walter the Darohaugh and its pertinents, but reserve a certain 
space of ground adjoining the site of Lord Fife's mausoleum,

aud the grant makes no mention of, and cannot be supposed to 
comprehend, the houses and gardens of the monastery in the town. 
Sir Walter, however, appears to have subsequently become pos- 
sessed of the whole, at least there is evidence of his descendants 
being soon after in possession ; and these continued to hold the 
yards till a late period, parts of which, indeed, are still held by 
them, either in possession or as superiors. Through these yards 
was formed, about the year 1770, the street called Bridge Street, 
now one of the principal thoroughfares of the town. The rest of 
the Ccirmelite lands, extending southward from the town, were suc- 
cessively conveyed in 1630 to Lord Airly, and in 1690 to Lord 
Fife. The superiority and feu-duties, which, in the year 1617, 
had been gifted by James VI. to King's College, Aberdeen, were 
also bought up, in 1752, by Lord Fife. 

A few very old persons can yet remember some large massy 
ruins, standing on the space now occupied by the plainstones, cal- 
led the Towers. These have probably been originally a part of 
the monastery, but are known to have been latterly a residence of 
the Lords Banff. In some old rights this building is styled a pa- 
lace — a distinction it is supposed to have acquired in consequence 
of having been the temporary abode of certain of the Scottish kings, 
who, as appears from the date of some old charters, had visited the 
town. This building was demolished by General Monro, in August 
1640, as is thus related in the History of the Gordons, Vol. ii. 
p. 339, " Monro havingmarched to Bamff, as said is, encamp- 
ed in Sir George Ogilvy, afterward created by the King, Lord 
Bamff, his garden, inclosed with excellent stone-walls, and plant- 
ed with the best fruit-trees then could be had. All of which they 
immediately hewed down, not leaving one fruit-tree, or barren, 
young or old, standing ; and they dug up all the hedges by the 
root. They entirely demolished his house there, one of the state- 
liest and finest in the north, and carried away all the timber and 
iron work in it, leaving nothing standing but the ruinous walls. 
When this barbarous act was told the King 'tis reported he said, 
as for the house, it mattered not much, money could build it up 
again in a short time ; but it was a cruel thing to destroy the gar- 
den, which many years could not repair." Spalding also speaks

of the destruction of " the pleasant planting and fruitful young 
trees bravely growing within the laird of Banff's oi-chard and gar- 
dens," and of his " stately house of Banff," as " pitiful to see " 
The gardens were the yards of the monastery, already mentioned. 

The lands on which the sea-town now stands belonged to the 
chapel of the Holy Rood. This chapel is supposed to have stood 
on the Rose Crag towards the present northern extremity of the 
castle-grounds; another supposition is, that it was on the site of 
the old churth. The lands of this chaplainry were, in the year 
1552, feued in perpetuity, by certain bailies and burgesses acting 
as commissioners of the town, with the consent of Mr James Cur- 
rer or Currier, chaplain of the Holy Rood, to Sir Walter Ogilvy, 
then provost, for payment of forty shillings yearly to the chaplain. 
The moving causes for this conveyance are stated to be " ob aug- 
mentationem rentalis dictse capellanise Sancti Crucis de Banff pro 
perpetua sustentatione capellani ejusdem omni tempore affuturo 
fien. ob divini cultus venerationem et exhibitionem et ad extir- 
pandam heresim tamdiu eminentem ut omnis prorsum earum am- 
biguitas et recidat. quod fieri non poterit nisi interve-

cipue auxilio et defensione nobilis viri Walteri Ogilvie de Dunlu- 
gas, militis et propositi nostri burgi de Banff, de nobis semper bene 
meriti, hinc igitur dedisse," &amp;c. Two of the commissioners could 
not sign their names to the deed. From Sir Walter Ogilvie the 
lands were conveyed, along with the Carmelite lands, to the Laird 
of Braco; and, by him, in exchange for some lands near Duff 
House, to the town of Banff, to which they now afford a feu-duty 

Another chapel dedicated to St Thomas the Apostle is sup- 
posed to have stood somewhere between the sites of the present 
parish church and St Andrew's Chapel. Names still existing, St Ni- 
nian's, St Catherine's, &amp;c. evince the once consecrated character 
of various localities in the town. 

It is known that the Knights- Templars anciently held property 
m the burgh, and a house is still remembered standing in the wa- 
ter-path at the south corner of the lane passing between it and 
the Castle Street, which bore the iron cross, the usual token by 

site onhety cfn"r.h7ri' '' chaplainry of the Holy Rood, and that on the 
and lie how endowed are confused

which the fraternity marked their possessions. A short distance from 
the town is a place called Spittal mire, supposed a corruption of hos- 
pital mire, perhaps from a house of that description belonging to the 
templars. It appears that when, on the abolition of the order of 
Knights St John, who succeeded the templars, their possessions were 
erected into a lordship in favour of Sir James Sandilands in 1563, 
many parts of these possessions were found to be so much scatter- 
ed, and let for such insignificant rents or feu-duties, as not to be 
worth the attention of the new proprietors ; and, in this way, pro- 
bably, the possessions of the templars in this town have passed 
at length into common burgage tenures. 

All that now remains of the ancient castle is a part of the outer 
wall and of the ditch. The house where Archbishop Sharp was 
born was pulled down about twenty years ago. One or two pieces 
of lettered freestone taken from it have been built into the church- 
yard wall, at the burial-ground of the Sharp family. 

The castle was a constabulary or lodging for the King when 
visiting this part of his dominions, and where he, or, in his ab- 
sence, the thane, or constable, or sheriff administered justice. 
These officers being named by the King, and moveable at pleasure, 
the castle seems always to have been public or royal property, 
until the Earl of Buchan, who married, as formerly mentioned, 
Margaret Ogilvieof Auchterhouse, was appointed hereditary thane 
or constable. From the Buchan family, the castle was conveyed 
to Robert Sharp, sheriff-clerk of Banff, elder brother of the famous 
archbishop, the father, William Sharp, having had it before in 
feu. The archbishop was murdered in 1679, and after Robert's 
death the castle descended to his brother's son, Sir William Sharp 
of Stonyhill, who resigned it to Leslie of Kininvie, from whom it 
passed to the Earl of Findlater  — whose heir, Lord Seafield, still 
holds it. Lord Seafield, it may be noted, was descended from 
the family of Auchterhouse, who formerly held the Castle. 

The old Castle of Inchdrewer, supposed to have been built 
about the time of James IV. or V., is still so entire as to be ha- ' 
bitable by the family of a tenant of Sir Robert Abercromby's. Its 
appearance possesses no peculiar feature of interest, and the only 
incident connected with it is the death of a Lord Banff who was 
burned in the year 1713, under some circumstances not very well 
explained. It is said that, having embraced the Roman Catholic 

• The office of Sheriff was resigned by the Earl of Buchan to Bairdof Auchmed-

religion, he had gone for some time to Ireland, engaged proba- 
bly in some of the intrigues then carrying on in behalf of the Pre- 
tender ; and it was suspected that the persons in whose charge he 
had left the Castle, having pillaged some of his valuable property, 
murdered him immediately after his return, and set his apartment 
on fire, for the sake of concealment. By some, it seems, the event 
was viewed as a judgment on his apostacy, and particularly with 
regard to some threats used by him, of burning the Protestants. 
This event might well have entitled the old castle to be haunted ; 
but I have never heard that it enjoys that reputation. 

A vaulted aisle of the old church still remains in the church- 
yard, and is a burying-place of the family of Lord Banff. 

Adjoining Lord Fife's mausoleum is a very curious ancient monu- 
ment, on which is represented the figure of an armed warrior recum- 
bent, with the inscription, " Hie jacet Johanes Duf, de Maldavat et 
Baldavi, obiit 2 Julii 1404," &amp;c. This monument, with the ashes of 
the deceased an ancestor of Lord Fife, was brought from Cullen. 

Some years ago, in levelling a small hillock on Provost Came- 
ron's farm of Poddocklaw, a stone coffin or case was found, inclos- 
ing a vase of baked earth, in which were some ashes and fragments 
of bones. In a tumulus dug into on a neighbouring farm, several 
of such vases were found, placed on a sort of stone bench, sup- 
ported on blocks. On this bench some of the vases were invert- 
ed, others had a flat stone on the top, the whole being covered 
over with earth. 

Within a few years also, in the course of digging the foundation 
of a new house on the high shore, at the foot of the Castlehill, a 
vessel was found containing a quantity of silver coins. They are 
about the size of sixpence, but very thin and greatly defaced, and 
covered with a green rust. Six of these coins which the writer 
has seen are in the possession of J. A. Cameron, Esq. Solicitor, 
—other six are in the museum of the Banff Institution. Of these 
coins one only presents a crowned head in profile, and the name 
Alexander is traceable round the edge. The obverse is quartered, 
in each quartering a star, and, around. Rex Scotorum is pretty vi- 
sible. The other eleven are ascertained to be of the coinage of 
Edward II. of England. 

In a small plantation of Lord Fife's on the Gallow-hill is a tu- 
mulus, having some appearance of being an ancient sepulchre; but 
it has never been opened.

or rather the only one, as a piece of architecture, deserving men- 
tion, is DutF House, the splendid mansion of the Earl of Fife, — 
splendid as it is, still more so if the design were completed. It was 
built eighty or ninety years ago by William Lord Braco, after a 
design by Adams, the first of the celebrated architects of that 
name, at an expense of about L. 70,000. The style is purely Ro- 
man. The body of the house for the wings have never yet been 
added is of an oblong shape, and consists of four lofty stories. 
The first is a rustic basement, over which rise two stories adorn- 
ed with fluted pilasters, and an entablature of the style of the 
temple of Jupiter Stator at Rome. Over this entablature, which 
goes round the whole structure, there is an attic story, surmount- 
ed by a balustrade. The four corners of the building have pro- 
jections resembling towers, which break and vary the outline, and 
also rise to a greater height than the other parts of the attic story. 
These towers are adorned at the angles by an upper range of pi- 
lasters, with an entablature of the composite order, and are crown 
ed at top by domical roofs, on which octagonal pedestal chimneys 
are placed. Both the entrance and back fa9ades have also central 
projections surmounted by pediments, on which the family arms are 
cut in has relief, which, with the appended achievements, fill the 
entire spaces of the face of the pediments. The entablature and 
capitals of the pilasters, as well as the smaller ornaments, are ex- 
quisitely carved, though some of these last, for what reason I know 
not, have been left unfinished. The back and front of the build- 
ing are precisely alike, except that the basement part of the pro- 
jection in front is occupied by an outer stair, of two circular as- 
cents, with carved stone balustrades. The principal entrance is 
thus on the second story. From an arcade below the landing- 
place of the outer stair there is an entrance to the servants' hall. 

Duff House, to be seen to advantage, requires to be beheld 
pretty near. There is too little variety of outline, and the colour- 
of the material freestone is too dingy to strike at a distance. It 
is besides desirable that the eye should be diverted from the con- 
fused assemblage of chimneys and slated pavilions by which it is 
surmounted, which seem to create an incongruous mixture of the 
castellated and the classic styles. Seen so near as to discern the ela- 
borate ornaments, the appearance of Duff House is in the highest 
degree rich, graceful, and majestic. 

Duff House contains a large collection of paintings, many of 
which are interesting and valuable, either as specimens of art, or 



BANFF.

as portraits of celebrated characters, and examples of the costume 
of various ages and countries. Among the more excellent of the 
former class may be enumerated a portrait, in perfect preserva- 
tion, of the Constable de Bourbon, by Titian. This has been al- 
lowed by the best judges, both in this country and on the conti- 
nent, to be one of the very finest specimens of the great Venetian 
colourist. A head of Charles 1. by Vandyke, esteemed a most 
characteristic specimen of that master; a portrait, three-quarters 
length, of Lord Strafford, and a full-length of Lady Herbert, both 
by Vandyke, and regarded as very fine ; a full-length portrait of 
the present Earl of Fife by Raeburn ; an original portrait of Mo- 
liere ; various portraits, chiefly of females, by Sir Peter Lely ; por- 
trait of Sir Godfrey Kneller by himself; portrait of Henderson, 
the Scottish preacher, by Jameson ; portrait of Mrs Abingdon 
by Sir Joshua Reynolds, esteemed a beautiful specimen of that 
master ; landscape by Ruysdael ; a flower-piece, beautifully co- 
loured, and esteemed a first rate specimen of art ; a candle-light 
scene, by Schalcken ; cattle-piece, by Cuyp ; dog and monkey, 
with still life, by Snyders ; a large landscape by Wynants ; a land- 
scape by Wouvermans ; an infant Christ by Murillo ; Virgin and 
child by Corregio ; philosopher and skull by Quintin Matsys, the 
blacksmith of Antwerp ; sea-piece by Backhuysen ; shepherd with 
his flock by Rosa da Tivoli ; landscape by Domenichino ; head 
of Charles 1. by Velasquez; two specimens of the rare Spanish 
painter Cano ; a painting by Luca Giordani ; Ostade's mother by 
himself, and several other excellent specimens of the Flemish and 
Dutch school, &amp;c. Among those of the second class may be no- 
ticed, portraits of most of the English kings, from Henry V. to 
George H., including a full-length of Henry VHI. by Hol- 
bein, formerly in the possession of Sir Joshua Reynolds; portraits 
of Cromwell, Marlborough, Marshal Villars, Prince Eugene, 
Charles XH., Peter the Great, John Duke of Argyle, smallliead 
of Ludovico Caracci,&amp;c. Respectable strangers are readily admit- 
ted, at all times, to view this collection. 

Two years ago, a very handsome though small chapel was erect- 
ed for the Episcopal congregation. It is in the Gothic style. 
The west front, of dressed freestone, is flanked by two carved 
mmarets, and otherwise chastely but tastefully ornamented. The 
mside IS finished in an appropriate manner, and has a very pleas- 
mg eff'ect. The chapel possesses a good organ. 

The parish church stands at the south side of the town, on -i

highly advantageous site, being on a sort of platform projecting 
forward from the declivity on which the town is situated. In its 
outside appearance the church is perfectly plain. " The spire'' 
says the worthy writer of the old Statistical Account " still re- 
mains in an unfinished state, which gives the whole building a 
heavy and awkward appearance. It is intended, however, to re- 
sume the work next season." I regret to say that the same 
words are still descriptive of the position of affairs in this par- 
ticular, if, merely for " intended," we read " wo intended." An at- 
tempt was lately made to raise funds by subscription for erecting 
a spire, according to a very handsome design, furnished by Mr 
Robertson, architect, of Elgin, but this purpose has not as yet 
succeeded. The inside of the church is sparingly but very taste- 
fully decorated. The pulpit and galleries are of uncommon 
height ; and the whole character of the interior is in a high degree 
light, airy, and spacious. A few years ago the church was very 
handsomely fitted up by subscription for burning gas lights. 

In the interior of the church though the parish burying-ground 
is not adjoining — the old church-yard being still used for that pur- 
pose, are four handsome monuments of marble, built into the walls. 
One of these is a very fine piece of sculpture by Bacon. It was 
erected, in addition to another in the cathedral church at Calcutta, 
by Sir David Octherlony and the army under his command, to the 
memory of Lieutenant Peter Lawtie a native of Banff. It re- 
presents a soldier leaning over a funeral vase in an attitude of 
deep grief. The figure and draperies are exquisitely carved. 

Of the other monuments, one is erected to the memory of the 
late Mr John Cruickshank, Rector of Banff Academy, by his 
former pupils ; another to the memory of the late Mr A. Gassy 
elsewhere mentioned as a benefactor of the town erected by sub- 
scription. The remaining monument is a private one. 

The town-house, built about forty years ago, is a very large, 
but entirely plain building, forming two sides of a square, with a 
spire rising from the external angle. The spire, which is much 
older than the house, is a sort of fluted cone, of very graceful 
proportions, rising from a square tower. The whole height of 
the spire is 100 feet. The tower, spire, and front of the house 
are built of dressed sandstone. The house is of three very lofty

out, and adorned with flowers and shrubs.

stories. It contains a hall, two large drawing-rooms, Town-coun- 
cil Chamber, Sheriff-court Room, Town Chamberlain's and Sheriff 
Clerk's offices, and prisons. The staircase and landing-places 
are spacious. 

There is a Trades' Hall, mason lodges, &amp;c. but neither these nor 
any of the other buildings in the parish are, as buildings, deserv- 
ing of any notice. It may be mentioned, however, that a few of 
the more considerable private houses lately built in the town have 
been designed with some degree of regard to architectural sym- 
metry and decoration, and present rather handsome fronts. Al- 
most every kind of building material is easily procured. Plain 
walls are generally built of a sort of soft blue slate. Window ri- 
bats, or whole fronts, are of dressed granite or sandstone. Bricks 
are also employed for slighter or more temporary purposes. 

III. — Population. 

The population of the parish, at different periods, has been as 
follows : 

In 1801 the population was 3571 
18H, - - 3603 
1821, . - 3855 
1831, - - 3711 
Males m the town in 1831, - 1229 
Females, - . _ 1706 

Total in the town, 2935 

Males in the country, - 360 
Females, . _ . 41 g 

776 



Total, - 37 11 

The decrease between 1821 and 1831 is ascribed, in the Go- 
vernment return, to absence of public works and emigration. 

The average of registered births for the last seven years is 62; 
of marriages, 25. There is no official register of deaths ; but, from 
a private list kept by the grave-digger, the average number of bu- 
rials, annually, in the church-yard of Banff, appears to be 55. 

Lord Fife is the only heritor that has a residence in the parish. 
His Lordship has been living constantly at Duff House for more 
than two years past. Perhaps it would be difficult to name more 
than one or two other persons of independent fortune in the parish. 
There are only three proprietors of land of the yearly value of 
L. 50 or upwards. 

The writer can learn of only 1 insane person in the parish, and 
4 tatuous; of none blind from natural causes; nor of any deaf 
or dumb. 

Language.— kmoug the higher and better educated classes, the 
Lnghsh language may be heard spoken in tolerable purity, both 



36 



BANFFSHIRE. 



as to idiom and pronunciation : there are few who cannot express 
themselves in Enghsh, still fewer who do not familiarly understand 
it when distinctly spoken. Unmixed Scotch is never to be heard. 
The most common dialect is a mixture of Scotch and English, the 
Scotch used being of the somewhat vicious kind, known, I believe, 
by the name of the Aberdeenshire. The Scotch, however, is gra- 
dually wearing out. Every person remembers the frequent use, 
in former years, of terms and phrases that are now seldom to be 
heard but among the older and more secluded. Even, however, 
in what is called, by courtesy, speaking English, or using English 
words, there is often a sore lack of the genuine English pronun- 
ciation. The defect is not so much in the accentuation, as in the 
vowel and diphthongal sounds. Thus the three different sounds 
of the letter a in far fat, faulty are all given alike, as in far. The 
sound of z, as in him, is made the same as e in her, — unless when 
some, flying from this Scylla of orthoepy, fall into the Charybdis 
of pronouncing it as if spelled heem. No difference is made be- 
tween the two sounds of o in pop and pope, and the oa in broad. 
Rod, rode, broad, are all made to rhyme together. The long a 
as in made is pronounced like the English short e : fed &amp;n6.fade 
are pronounced just ahke. Unaccented vowels are generally lost, 
or sounded like the French e in le. Regular is pronounced regler 
or regeler ; prelate, prelet ; absolute, abselet. Even in the matter 
of pronunciation, however, there is a great and progressive im- 
provement. 

Character and Circumstances. — Generally speaking, the intel- 
lectual, moral, and religious character of the people deserves to 
be favourably mentioned ; though, undoubtedly, among particular 
sections of the population, profligacy and vice is to be found pre- 
vailing in no inconsiderable degree. Perhaps vices of sensuality 
are more to be noted than those of injustice or inhumanity. Of 
poaching or smuggling there are scarcely any instances in the pa- 
rish. The people are also, in general, very cleanly in their habits. 

The poorer classes in the country subsist mostly on meal, milk, 
and vegetables, particularly potatoes, and kail, or colewort. Near- 
er the coast, fish may be easily had. 

Both in town, among the trading and labouring classes, and in 
the landward part of the parish, among the crofters and small 
farmers, there are a considerable number of persons, who, if not 
in absolutely destitute, are in very straitened circumstances ; and 
who, neither in regard to freedom from worldly anxiety, nor suf-

ficiency of even the necessaries of existence, can properly be said 
to enjoy a reasonable portion of the comforts of life. Even among 
these, however, discontent with their lot is not a remarkable fea- 
ture — though and particularly in the town the want of the whole- 
some excitement which a prosperous course of industry creates, is 
often sought to be supplied by that which is to be derived from 
the use of spirituous liquors. Nor is it probably too favourable a 
judgment to pass on human conduct, to say, that habits of in- 
ebriety are, at least, as often the effect as the cause — they are un- 
doubtedly both — of depressed worldly circumstances. 

It is supposed that from 40 to 45 cases of illegitimate birth 
have occurred within the last three vears. 

Amusements.— li can scarcely be said that the people of the 
middle or lower classes now devote any but a mere insignificant 
part of their time to what could properly be called amusement. It 
would almost seem as if men had now outgrown the rehsh for 
amusement, or find amusement in what was once the business of 
life. Even children seem indifferent to the sports and pursuits with 
which the children of former days appeared to be absorbed. There 
is now a harder competition for the means of livelihood — anxieties 
inconsistent with the pursuit of amusement have taken hold of men's 
minds. An improved state of the practical arts makes every pro- 
fession more difficult of acquisition, furnishes new occupation for 
ingenuity, new aims for mental activity, new subjects of emulation,— 
the diffusion of knowledge has created new desires, new ideas, new 
sources of excitement. From the increased diffusion of newspapers 
and cheap popular prints, a taste for reading has sprung up to a 
considerable extent. Such works as Chambers's Journal are fre- 
quently bought by farm-servants and artisans. Newspapers are 
circulated as long as the texture of the paper holds together, or 
its colour can be distinguished from that of the printer's ink. The 
recent political excitements, indeed, whatever may be their good 
or evil tendencies otherwise, have doubtless tended to increase or 
create an appetite for knowledge : there being few political ques- 
tions that do not, at least indirectly, excite a curiosity, and lead to 
inquiries, touching a variety of extrinsic subjects in history, geo- 
graphy, statistics, arts, commerce, &amp;c. A man who sets up for a 
politician finds occasion to learn a great many things besides politics. 

IV. — Industry.

acres. Of the last mentioned, there are 215 acres on the estate 
of Sir Robert Abercromby,  the improvement of which has been 
conditioned for. Some maintain that there is yet a quantity of 
waste land in the parish that might be profitably improved, others 
that cultivation is already over extended. There is no undivided 
common. The number of acres under wood is 223.  

In the grounds of Duff House, which comprise most of the plant- 
ing in the parish, are to be found ash, elm, beech, plane, birch, 
lime, maple, oak, horse-chestnut, mountain-ash, and various species 
of firs. Here there seems to have been rather too little done as 
regards the affairs of thinning and pruning, &amp;c. — principally, it 
is alleged, from an indisposition to diminish theshelter for the game, 
and much of the wood is of very slender growth. 

What other planting is in the parish belongs to Lord Seafield, 
and consists mostly of firs ; but, from age and thinning together, 
may be described as rather verging to decay. Sir Robert Aber- 
cromby is at present in the intention of planting some belts and 
clumps on his property in the upper part of the parish, and about 
fifty imperial acres have been laid off for that purpose. 

About a mile from the town, is a very considerable nursery for 
plants of all kinds, suitable to the climate. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of arable land in the parish 
may be stated at about 16s. per acre. It varies from 5s. to L. 2. 

• This statement is made up from the best existing data, namely, from accounts 
procured of the lands belonging to each proprietor in the parish : but, as there have 
been, as regards the greater part, no late survey, its exact correctness cannot be war- 
ranted. The total amount which it furnishes is 5162 imperial acres ; and after 
making allowance for the space occupied by the town of Banff, roads, &amp;c. the whole 
extent of the parish would fall short of that stated in Robertson's map, viz. 6312 acres. 

The map, however, includes in the parish of Banff a tract of perhaps 1 00 acres, 
on the river side, from about the cruive dike to the bridge of Alva, considered by 
the agent of Lord Fife, the proprietor, to be in the parish of Alva, and not included 
in the present computation — also a space, which may be guessed at 500 acres on this 
side of the burn of Boyndie, similarly stated, by the agents of Lord Seafield, the pro- 
prietor, to be in the parish of Boyndie. 

The boundaries of the two parishes are thus fixed in the decreet of disjunction 1 635 : 
« Ye said parochine of Banff to have includit yairintill ye toune of Banff, with ye 
pendicles of ye samyn as it had of before, and to have adjoyned yairto out of ye said 
parochine of Inverboyndy ye landis of Ord, Inchdrower, with ye pendicles yrof ; the 
lands of Blairshiiuioch, Kilbeuchlie, Paddocklaw, and CuUinorttis, ye whilk haill 
landis and parochine lyes on the eist side of the burne of Inverljoyndy ; and the said 
parochine of Inverboindy to have includit yairin as the particular boundisofye 
parochine of the samyn, the haill lands lyand betwixt the burne of Boyne at the west, 
the burne of Inverboyndy at the cast, the sea on the north, and the landis of park 
of Corncairn at the south pairtis." 

It seems the general understanding at present that , at least, the lands of Easter 
Baldavie and Raggal, with the plantations of Baldavie all on this side of the burn 
of Boyndie, belong to the parish of Boyndie — and these lands are not specified, un- 
less under the name of " pendicles" in the niiiincration of those which compose the 
parish of Banff, 4 



BANFF. 39 

The average rent of grazing is at the rate of about L. 1, 15s. per 
ox or cow grazed, or 7s. per ewe or sheep. 

Wages. — The ordinary wages of farm-servants is from L. 4, 10s. 
to L. 6 half yearly. 

Farm-labourers, according to the length of the day and other 
circumstances, receive from 9d. to Is. 6d. per day; country wrights, 
Is. 4d. ; masons, 2s. 6d. : — all these rates with victuals. 

Prices. — Wool is sold at Is. 6d. to 2s. per pound of 22 oz. Other 
species of raw produce for home use are rarely bought or sold, being 
generally grown by each consumer for his own particular use. Rid- 
dles cost from 2s. 6d. to 4s., sieves 3s. 6d., but these are now sel- 
dom used, most of the mills being furnished with sifters ; corn bas- 
kets called blind sieves Is. 6d. ; coarse wicker baskets for carry- 
ing weeds, peats, potatoes, &amp;c. Is. ; a sort of bass made of heather 
is sold for 2s. 6d. 

Mason work varies from L. 1, 5s. to L. 2 per rood. Carpenter's 
work for the various descriptions, as follows : Flooring and joisting 
from 3s. 6d. to 5s. 6d. per yard ; slate roofing, including rafters, 
from 5s. 9d. to 8s. 6d. per yard ; tile roofing, including rafters, 
from 3s. 9d. to 4s. 9d. per yard ; windows, from 2s. 3d. to 2s. 9d. 
per foot ; double lath partitions with plaster 2s. 6d. ; doors from 
10s. to 18s; stairs 4s. 6d. to 10s. 6d. per yard. 

Live Stock — The parish is not a sheep district ; the small num- 
ber kept in it are mostly of the Cheviot breed. The breed of cattle 
is the result of various crosses, which do not appear to have tended 
much to its improvement; and they have occasioned the loss of a 
very good breed, formerly known by the name of the old Banffshire 
breed. Altogether, the parish is not conspicuous for its improve- 
ments in this department. Perhaps, however, the now extensive use 
of bone manure, by which an increased quantity of winter keep is 
produced, may be the means of improving the breeds of cattle. At 
one period cattle was rather the staple produce of the district : lat- 
terly, it has become more a grain country. The plan of husban- 
dry m universal use is the rotation of crops for five, six, or seven 
years, the latter period being most common. 

Husbandry.~\n the course of the last forty years, perhaps one- 
fifth of the present arable land in the parish has been brought into 
cultivation. Draining has also been effected to a very large extent. 
On one farm alone  Blairshinnoch, in the occupation of Mr A. Milne, 
16,000 ells have been formed in the course of the last six years. 



40 



BANFFSHIRE. 



Still there is great room for improvement in this way — perhaps 
more in this than in any other way that could be mentioned. 

Some years ago a considerable improvement was effected by the 
straighting of the burn of Boyndie. 

The ordinary duration of lease is nineteen years. This, if not 
generally complained of, is by some considered to be of too short 
duration, in respect that, as farms may be generally supposed to 
be left, by outgoing tenants, in a somewhat impoverished condi- 
tion, the new entrants can scarcely have time, in a period of nine- 
teen years, to bring them properly into condition, so as to reap the 
benefit of their outlay before the termination of the lease. 

The greater part of the lands in the parish are enclosed and 
subdivided with substantial stone dikes ; and the farm-houses and 
offices good and sufficient — some of them superior to the genera- 
lity of farm accommodation, even in an improved district such as 
this parish. Any deficiency that exists in this respect may per- 
haps be owing to its being the more general practice in the dis- 
trict, that the tenants erect the farm accommodations, receiving 
an allowance at the end of their lease ; and the consequent induce- 
ment they have to lock up, in this way, as little of their capital as 
possible. 

Quarries. — The granite at Cairns of Ord mentioned in the 
Geological section is of excellent quality for building, and has 
been wrought for that purpose ; but, owing to its distance from the 
sea, not to such an extent as it would otherwise have been. The 
different species of rocks already described as existing in the pa- 
rish are also in some places quarried for building materials ; but 
unless at the time when the new pier was constructing there 
have never been any considerable operations in this way ; partly 
because the peculiar sort of stones afforded are not much prized 
for building, and partly because there is no great quantity of build- 
ing going on to require stones of any sort. 

Fisheries, — All the different kinds of white fish used for food 
that are to be found in the sea adjoining the parish are fished 
for, and brought to market, but only by individual fishermen on 
their own account, and therefore not on any great scale. It is the 
opinion of some, however, that if the cod, ling, and turbot fishery 
were prosecuted in this parish on a scale of sufficient extent, it 
might soon become of importance. These fish are said to be very 
plentiful about twenty-five or thirty miles off the coast. 

Lobsters and crabs are sold in the local markets, and peri- 



BANFF. 



41 



winkles, besides, have of late been sent to the London market to 
good account. There is also abundance of shrimps to be found, but 
they have never been fished for to any extent. 

The rent of the salmon-fishing in the river Lord Fife, proprie- 
tor, is L. 1600 a year. There are also bag-net fishings in the 
sea on each side of the river's mouth. That on the east side is 
Lord Fife's, and included in one tack with the river fishing. That 
on the west side is let by the town of Banff for L. 191 yearly ; but 
their right is called in question by Lord Fife, and at present the 
subject of litigation. 

The salmon are sent by steam, either pickled or packed in ice, 
principally to the London market. 

The herring fishery on the east coast of Scotland was for many 
years almost exclusively confined to the coast of Caithness and 
Sutherland; but about the year 1815, owing to the encouragement 
given by Government in the shape of bounties, together with the 
assistance of well qualified persons to superintend the cure and 
brand the herring barrels, the fishing of herrings was commenced 
on the coasts of Aberdeenshire, Banffshire, Morayshire, and Ross- 
shire. It was soon discovered that the herrings were of as good 
quality on the south side of the Murray Frith as on the north, 
and equally abundant ; and this trade, from a very small beginning, 
has grown to be flourishing and extensive; and, though the boun- 
ties have been withdrawn, the herring fishery is still carried on 
with great spirit. 

The quantity cured in the district of the Banff Fishery Officer, 
which extends from Gardenstown to Portsoy, in favourable seasons', 
IS about 30,000 barrels. Of this quantity, nearly one-half is ex- 
ported to Germany ; a considerable part is sent to London for the 
supply of the West India islands, and the remainder goes general- 
ly to Ireland. The following table exhibits the state of the herring 
fishery, as regards the port of Banff lone, for the last five years

About the year 1819, the number of herring boats from the 
port of Banff was perhaps not short of 70. The decrease lat 
terly I have never heard accounted for in any way that does not 
mamly resolve into mere matter of chance, or otherwise, bv refe 
rence to some of those unaccountable prejudices and superstitions

which people connected with sea-faring employments are so apt to 
take up. The two years preceding the last were indeed eminent- 
ly unsuccessful ; but any discouragement thence arising does not 
seem to have affected the district generally, as it has done this par- 
ticular port. There is no doubt a want of space near the harbour 
for the erection of suitable premises ; but even the space that ex- 
ists is not now employed. The existence of a higher rate of shore 
dues at Banff than at some neighbouring ports is also stated to 
have a discouraging effect ; but still this cause does not operate in 
a higher degree now than formerly. 

Shipping. — The number of vessels now registered at Banff Cus- 
tom-house is as follows : 

No. of Vessels. Denomination. Tonnage. 

1 . Bi'igi • 1-55 

18 . Schooners, 15G7 

48 . Sloops, . 2579 

Total, 67 . 4H01 

Of these 10 schooners 878 tons, and 11 sloops 657 tons, be- 
long to the port of Banff; the remainder belong to the creeks of 
Fraserburgh, Gardenstown, Macduff, Portsoy, Port-Gordon, and 
Garmouth, in the district of the port. 

The vessels of this and the neighbouring ports are generally 
employed in carrying grain, herrings, salmon, live cattle, and cured 
pork to London, and some other places in the south, and return 
with coals, groceries, &amp;c. &amp;c. Some of them take occasional 
voyages to Sweden for iron and deals ; to Russia for hemp ; and 
Holland, for flax. They also in autumn go frequently to Ham- 
burgh with herrings, from whence they get cargoes of grain, wool, 
bark, hides, &amp;c. to London, Hull, and the Frith of Forth. A 
great proportion of the herrings which are sent to the Prussian 
ports in the Baltic is shipped by Prussian vessels, because these 
vessels, having to return home at any rate, take them for a some- 
what lower freight, and the Prussian merchants who purchase the 
herrings frequently order them to be shipped by their own vessels. 
But British vessels are also employed in carrying herrings to the 
Baltic ; and, upon the whole, this part of the trade is pretty fairly 
divided between the ships of Britain and Prussia. 

There are four vessels a schooner and three smacks regularly 
engaged in the London trade, two in the Leith, and two princi- 
pally in the Aberdeen trade. 

The exporting of live-cattle to London was first tried, as a spe- 
culation, in 1826, and since that time has formed a regular branch 



BANFF. 



43 



of trade. During the year 1834, 440 head of live-cattle were sent 
to London by sea, besides 911 pigs, and 156 sheep and lambs. 

The exportation of grain from this port has increased in a very 
great degree during the last twenty years. In the course of the 
year 1834, 29,790 quarters of oats were shipped at Banff, all, with 
a trifling exception, for London; 1174 quarters of wheat, and 
976 quarters of barley and bear, mostly for Leith and London ; 
also a small quantity of oatmeal, pease, and potatoes. 194 bags 
of potato flour were shipped for Leith. 

Very few foreign vessels land at Banff harbour, though many 
come into neighbouring ports within the range of the custom-house 
of Banff". These are principally from Norway, with birch timber 
for herring barrels. 

In the year 1813 a Greenland whale fishing company was form- 
ed, and two vessels fitted out. In the course of a year or two, how- 
ever, one of the vessels was wrecked in a storm soon after going 
out of the harbour ; the insurance was only recovered after a liti- 
gation ; and as, besides this discouragement, the vessels had been 
unlucky in their fishings, and the price of oil was falling, the con- 
cern was abandoned at a very serious loss to the partners. 

Banff" is the principal station of a party of the coast guard. The 
commander's district extends from Speymouth to Rattrayhead. 
Their watch-house is at the battery. 

Manufactures. — There are premises on the high ground above 
the harbour, fitted, both by extent and supply of water, for carry- 
ing on the brewing trade on a large scale. Of late, however, the 
business has been little farther extended than to supply home con- 
sumption. It is stated that the demand for malt liquor is immense- 
ly reduced by the increased distillation of spirits. The brewery 
employs 9 cr 10 persons. 

The foundery was established about nine years ago by Messrs 
Fraser. They execute every species of cast metal work, machi- 
nery, grates, ploughshares, &amp;c. &amp;c. and to a very considerable ex- 
tent. A blast fanners attached to the furnace is driven, and me- 
chanical power supphed for all departments of the work, by a 
steam engine of six horse power, constructed on the high pressure 

• In the list of places in the whole kingdom supplying the London market with 
grain, BanfF ranks among the highest as regards amount ; but this is taking in the 
importations from all the ports from Fraserburgh to Garmouth, inclusive, vessels 
from which clear out at the custom-house of Banff. The total quantity of grain exl 
ported from Banff including these other ports in 1834, was 13-2,377 quarters of 
grain, and 660 tons of meal ; in 1835, 94,067 quarters of grain, and 362 tons of meal

principle. This engine was wholly made by the Messrs Fraser, 
the proprietors. There are about 10 persons employed at this 
establishment. 

The distillery is at Mill of Banff, about a mile from the town 
on the Huntly road. From 11,000 to 12,000 gallons of spirits at 
proof are produced here yearly. There are 6 or 8 persons em- 
ployed — generally about fifteen hours a day. 

There is a small manufactory of ropes and sails for home use. 
Ship-building is only carried on occasionally. 

A somewhat considerable thread and stocking manufactory, which 
was carried on here at the time of the last Statistical Account, 
was discontinued about twenty years ago. The proprietors enjoy- 
ed a patent for a species of stocking-frame, but farther improve- 
ments in machinery enabled the English manufacturers to under- 
sell them. The thread manufactory was kept up for a consider- 
ably longer period; but the increasing use of cotton instead of thread 
was gradually lessening the demand for it. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Town. — The town of Banff consists of two parts, completely se- 
parated, of which the first which may be called the body of the 
town lies partly on the lower extremity of the plain on the river 
side, already described, partly on the declivity; the other part cal- 
led the sea-town on an elevated level, which generally terminates 
abruptly within a small distance of the sea, by which it is bound- 
ed. Seen from the low ground beyond the river, the sea-town ap- 
pears to stand on a long ridge, having the battery at its northern 
extremity. On a piece of table-land projecting midway from be- 
tween the town and sea-town, stands the castle, nearly opposite the 
river mouth, and commanding an extensive and varied prospect, 
the sea, the town, and hill of Macduff, the sweep of the river and 
beautiful opposite slope, surmounted by the wood of Mountcoffer. 
The castle is a plain modern building with wings. 

The streets, though composed of houses of unequal size, are ge- 
nerally straight, and not deficient in width. The High Street, 
Castle Road, and a street in the sea-town terminating in the battery, 
form a continuous line from south to north, of above half a-mile in 
length. Within the last few years, many of the older houses have 
been pulled down and replaced by others ; and there is scarcely a 
building now remaining which would indicate the antiquity of the 
town. 

Some years ago it was proposed to form a new street to the south- 

3 



BANFF. 



45 



west of the town, entering from the Huntly road, and passing through 
to St Catherine Street ; but the scheme was abandoned from want 
of the concurrence of some of the proprietors in the proposed line. 

A gas-work was estaWished by a joint-stock company in 1831. 
The quantity of gas consumed in the year ending May 15, 1834, 
was 456,213 cubical feet ; in 1835, 463,547 cubical feet. 

In 1830, a new and very commodious market-place was laid out 
in a centrical part of the town, with complete accommodations of 
sheds, stalls, &amp;c. 

A few years ago, public baths were erected by a joint-stock com- 
pany. They are fitted up in a very convenient manner for hot, 
cold, and shower baths. They are open every day in summer, and 
once or oftener a-week during the remainder of the year. 

Notwithstanding that about L. 1100 was laid ouf in the year 
1810 for the conveyance of water into the town by pipes, the sup- 
ply in the summer season, in the public cisterns, is often extreme- 
ly deficient. On many premises, however, there are pump-wells. 

Means of Communication.— The post-office in the town of Banff 
is the only one in the parish ; but this office has three sub-offices 
attached to it, at Aberchirder on the road to Huntly, and New 
Pitshgo and Brucklaw on the road to Peterhead ; also a penny post- 
office at Macduff. There are daily mails to and from Aberdeen 
and the south, to and from Inverness and the north, and to and from 
Peterhead; also a direct mail three times a-week to and from Fra- 
serburgh, and the same to and from Huntly. The revenue of the 
post-office of Banff, stated at the period of the last Statistical Ac- 
count to be but L. 800, was, in 1829, after deduction of dead and 
re-sent letters L. 1284; since that year the revenue has been re- 
gularly decreasmg, being for the present year 1835 ending 5th 
December, only L. 1 131. A very considerable portion of the re- 
venue IS derived from the correspondence with the northern parts 
ot the contment, on account of the herring fishery 

The length of the turnpike road passing through the parish in 
the hne from Aberdeeen to Inverness, and extending from the west 
end of the bridge of Banff to a bridge across the burn of Boyndie 
IS exclusive of a part which forms the High Street of the town 
about two miles and a-half, perhaps a little more. 

The turnpike road from the harbour of Banff to a point on thp 
south-eastern boundary of the parish at the road leading to the 
farm o Wardend when it enters into the parish of Alva is also 
two miles and a-half. ' 



46 



BANFFSHIRE. 



There is a daily stage -coach to and from Aberdeen, and to and 
from Elgin ; and a daily mail-coach to and from Peterhead ; an 
open car also runs daily between Huntly and Banff ; a coach twice 
a-week between Keith and Banff; occasionally there have been 
others. All the mails except to Peterhead are conveyed by gigs 
or foot-posts. 

The Doveran is passed, near the town, by a handsome and sub- 
stantial stone bridge of seven semicircular arches, having a free 
water-way of 142 yards length. The parapets and abutments are 
of freestone. The bridge was built at the expense of Government 
in 1779. The burn of Boyndie, on the west of the parish, is pas- 
sed by a stone bridge of two arches. Both these bridges are in 
complete repair. Lower down on the burn of Boyndie, and where 
it is crossed by the old road, is another bridge of two arches. Along 
the whole line of the turnpike roads in the parish are substantial 
stone fences or hedges. 

Harbour. — The harbour of Banff is situated at the western ex- 
tremity of a circular bay, at the opposite extremity of which is the 
town and harbour of Macduff. The two extremities of the bay are 
rocky. The middle of it is a beach of sand and shingle cast up by 
the meeting of the river Doveran with the sea. The mouth of the 
river is sometimes at one, sometimes at another, part of this beach, 
but is most commonly near the land, and along the roadway lead- 
ins" from the town of Banff to the harbour. 

The old or inner harbour completed in the year 1775 is a tri- 
angular space enclosed within two piers and the land, the entrance 
being at the exterior angle facing the N. N. E. In 1816, how- 
ever, a new pier and break-water covering the old entrance was con- 
structed to the north of the old harbour, and a basin formed in the 
intervening space, according to a plan furnished by the late Mr Tel- 
ford. The expense of these improvements amounted to about 
L. 18,000, one-half of which was furnished by Government out of 
the proceeds of the forfeited estates. Unfortunately the new basin 
was found not to be a safe haven, as was sufficiently proved by the 
circumstance of vessels being wrecked when fairly moored within it. 
It has since, too, been almost filled up with sand, an increase of 
which it has also been the means of creating in the old harbour. 
Still the new pier has been of considerable use in several respects. 
It prevents all swell and agitation in the old harbour, which is now 
perhaps the safest artificial haven in the Moray Frith. It also af- 
fords some additional facilities for bringing vessels in or out. It is 



BANFF. 



47 



supposed by some that, by means of flood-gates, the new basin might 
yet be rendered a safe place for shipping. 

The present depth of water at the extremity of the new pier is, 
at low- water of spring tides, 4 feet 7 inches ; of neap-tides, 6 feet 
1 1 inches. A vessel drawing 12 feet water can enter the new basin 
at high water of ordinary neap-tides ; one drawing 15 feet at spring- 
tides. This depth, however, is only towards the outer part of the 
basin, owing to the accumulation of sand farther in. A vessel can 
enter the old harbour at high water of ordinary neap-tides, if draw- 
ing 8 feet, spring-tides 10 feet. 

A Morton's patent slip apparatus is now in the course of being 
laid down at the harbour. 

Municipal State.— The circumstance, that William the Lion 
gave a toft and garden in the burgh of Banff to his chaplain Dou- 
glas, Bishop of Moray, in 1165, similar gifts being made in Inver- 
ness, Nairn and Cullen, all royal burghs at this period, makes it 
probable that Banff possessed the privileges of royalty before that 
time. Tradition makes these privileges to have been conferred 
by Malcolm Canmore. They were confirmed by Robert Bruce. 
Robert II., in 1372, again confirmed them, together with such pri- 
vileges and liberties as were enjoyed by the town of Aberdeen. 
Farther confirmations were given by James VI. and Charles II. 

In the municipal government of the burgh, there has all along 
been this peculiarity, that the burgh taxes and assessments are im- 
posed, not by the magistrates and council, as is the usual practice 
in other burghs, but by the inhabitants assembled in head court. 

There is no regular police or night watch in the town. Two 
town Serjeants perform all the duties of police officers. Offences 
against the peace are taken cognizance of by either the Sheriff 
the Justices, or the magistrates, in their respective courts, to each 
ot which IS attached a separate procurator-fiscal of its own, whose 
duty It IS to prosecute offenders. 

When the property of the town in lands, fishings, &amp;c. is ba- 
lanced against its debts, the residue would appear to be rather in- 
considerable. The sum of L. 482, 9s. 1 Id. is raised annually, by 
assessment on the inhabitants, for the defraying of current expen- 
ses, as streets, water, lamps, &amp;c. 

Banff, on the whole, can scarcely be pronounced a thriving place 
It IS not increasing either in size or population ; and probably few 
It any ot the inhabitants are accumulating capital. Families seem 
to be dying away or becoming dispersed faster than new ones come

in their places. Yet few towns of its size present more attractions 
than Banff. It possesses both coast and inland scenery of a su- 
perior description ; is particularly healthy ; has excellent schools, 
variety of places of worship, abundant markets, regular and fre- 
quent posts, baths, literary institutions, society equal to what is ge- 
nerally to be found in a remote country town. No very good reason 
can be assigned for its want of prosperity, unless, perhaps, the de- 
ficiency of space about the town for manufacturing or commercial 
purposes, or for the erection of suburban villas. The town is hem- 
med in on two sides by great proprietors. On the one hand. Lord 
Fife is pushing us into the sea, on the other, Lord Seafield jams 
us close to the river ; yet, to say the truth, there seems little use 
made of even what space exists. A linen manufactory was lately 
projected, but failed. Indeed, most enterprizes of any extent that 
have ever been attempted in the town have turned out unfortunate. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church was built in 1790, and is ca- 
pable of containing 1500 persons. It is substantial and in com- 
plete repair. The average number of communicants is 700. The 
ao-e of the manse is not very well known ; indeed it has been built 
at different times. Soon after the settlement of the present in- 
cumbent, in 1821, it was in contemplation to erect a new manse ; 
but the incumbent agreed to accept, instead, an annual allowance 
with the old manse. The glebe contains 7 acres or more, and 
at one time rented so much as L. 45, but now falls very consider- 
ably short of that value. The stipend, about four years ago, was 
augmented to 18 chalders, half meal, half barley. 

A chapel in connexion with the Estabhshed Church has just 
been completed at the upper end of the parish, about half a mile 
from its extremity. The expense of its erection and that of a 
manse together about L. 400 has been raised by church collec- 
tions and subscriptions of heritors and others. It accommodates, 
without galleries, 300 persons. All the sittings have been rented, 
and demands made for many more. The minister's hving is de- 
rived from the seat rents, L. 20 being added from the Royal 
Bounty.

Wilson's trustees. i x .

gregation is 17. Tiie number of persons altogether, 84. For about 
ten years past, there has been no resident clergyman of this per- 
suasion in Banff. Service is performed once a fortnight, by a 
clergyman who resides at Portsoy. His living arises from seat 
rents, with some addition from the general fund of the Catholic 
church. The Bishop of Germaiiicia resides at Priestholm, in the 
parish of Rathven. 

The number of persons attending the Episcopal chapel is about 
300, of whom about 250 reside in the parish. 

The congregation established here in 1780, in connexion with 
the Relief body, separated from that connexion in 1808, and adopt- 
ed the Independent form. A new church, capable of containing 
upwards of 400 persons, was completed for the service of this con- 
gregation last year, at an expense of about L. 500. The number 
of families regularly attending is about 45; of persons altogether 
about 220, of whom, however, only about 90 reside in the parish. 

A congregation in connexion with the United Associate Synod 
was formed in 1822, and a substantial and commodious church 
erected in the low part of the town, at an expense of about L. 800. 
It IS capable of containing 500 persons. The number of families 
attending is 50 ; of persons altogether 200 ; but of these about 
100 are from other parishes. 

The livings of the ministers, respectively, of the Episcopal, Se- 
cession, and Independent churches, are made up from the seat 
rents and collections or subscriptions,— a certain mmm/m amount 
being, in each case, guaranteed by the hearers. 

A congregation of Wesleyan Methodists was first formed in 
Banff about the year 1775, but a chapel was not erected for their 
specia accommodation until 1820. It cost about L. 320, is with- 
out galleries, and capable of containing 300 persons. The whole 
number of persons regularly attending is about 100, about 40 of 
whom belong to the parish, of families 20. The ministers are 
maintained partly by an allowance from the general funds belong- 
ing tothisrehgiousbody, partly by contributions from their hearers. 

At all the places of worship in the parish divine service is in 
general well attended. 

A branch of the Bible Society, auxiliary to the Edinburgh in- 
stitution was formed here in 1824. It has generally from 60 to 
annually ' "nds average about L. 15

there are monthly or weekly meetings held, and contributions made 
for religious purposes. The whole amount thus collected will 
probably not exceed L. 25 per annum/ 

The average amount of extraordinary collections in the parish 
church for the last five years, after deduction, in each case, of a 
sum equal to an ordinary collection, has been L. 25. About 
three-fifths of the amount has been devoted to charitable, the re- 
mainder to religious purposes. 

Education.— kn academy was formed in 1786, under the di- 
rections of Dr Chapman, formerly rector of the grammar school at 
Dumfries, and author of a work on Education of some character at 
that period. The classes are taught by a rector and two masters : 
Latin, Greek, and French by the rector ; writing and mathema- 
tics, together with book-keeping, geography, and navigation, by 
one of the masters ; English reading, elocution, and grammar, by 
the other. Drawing is also taught by a separate master. The 
expense of education varies, of course, according to the number 
and description of branches in which each pupil takes lessons ; but 
' the highest expense for a principally classical education, does 
not ordinarily exceed 12s. 6d. per quarter; for a trading education, 
9s. 6d. ; an elementary, 6s. Course of book-keeping, L. 1, Is. ; na- 
vigation, 10s. 6d. ; French, 10s. 6d. 

The number of boys attending the academy has, of late years, 
been about 150; of girls at separate hours, about 20. Each of 
the masters, besides the fees of his class, receives a certain fixed 
sum from the town. The rector also has the salary of parish 
schoolmaster. 

The academy has 16 bursaries, one of which in the disposal 
of the Presbytery of Fordyce is of the annual value of the 
interest of L.600. The value of the other 15 is from L.2 to 
L. 3, 4s. t 

 There is evidence of there having been a grammar school at Banff, as far back 
as 1544. The charter formerly mentioned granted by the Carmelite brethren, to 
Sir Walter Ogilvie of Dunlugas, bears to be writnesseil, among others, " OuUiermo 
Clerk, preceptore scholce grammatices de Banff." n . 

In the vear 15S3, Bishop Cunningham of Aberdeen granted a charter, conhrmed 
bv James VI. in 1392, assigning the tenths of the King's rents of certaui lands m the 
county, for the maintenance of grammar schools in Banff; the teacher to be appomt- 
ed by tbe Provost, Bailies, and Town Council of Banff, but the trial of his fitness to 
be with the Bishops of Aberdeen, or, faihng them, the principal of King s College, 
Aberdeen These tenths amounted to L. 44, 10s. 6d. per anjium ; but it does not 
annpar that they have, up to a late period, or even ever been drawn. Ihe charter, 
but recently discovered, has been printed, with some additional notices regarding 
the ancient state of the school. 

t Three of these were endowed by Bailie Winchester,— of whom, as formerly men- 
tioned, the Laird of Gight borrowed a trifle in 1644.

There is a private unendowed school in the town, called the 
Commercial School, at which the number of boys attending as re- 
gular day-scholars, varies from 40 to 60 ; of other boys, at sepa- 
rate hours, from 15 to 20; of girls, at separate hours, about 30. 
Here the fee for reading and writing together is 4s. 6d. per quar- 
ter; for English reading and grammar, writing and arithmetic, to- 
gether, 6s. 6d. per quarter ; geography and higher mathema- 
tics, 7s. 6d. ; navigation, 10s. 6d. ; book-keeping, single, 7s. 6d., 
double, 15s. 

In 1804, Mr Alexander Pirie, merchant in Banff", left the sum 
of L. 1100 in trust to the town -council and kirk-session, for the 
maintenance from the yearly interest of a free school,— a feu in 
the sea-town, and an additional sum of L. 100, being at the same 
time assigned by him for the erection of a school and schoolmas- 
ter's house. The school is open to all poor children able to read 
the catechism whom the trustees may admit; and instruction is 
given in reading, writing, arithmetic, and church music. The 
usual number of scholars of late has been from 70 to 80. 

There are several unendowed boarding and day-schools for 
young ladies under the direction of highly accomplished teachers; 
the branches taught, and terms, being such as are usual in other 
similar establishments. 

There is a female charity school, under the management of the 
parish minister and a committee of ladies. The salary of the 
teacher is made up from subscriptions, and a small annual payment 
from a charitable bequest. The number of girls generally aitend- 
ing IS from 50 to 60. They receive instruction in reading, writ- 
mg, sewing, and knitting. One penny a-week is paid by each 
scholar to assist in procuring school-books and stationery. Tiie 
right of admitting scholars is vested in the subscribers. 

The exact number of persons in the parish who cannot read or 
write IS not ascertained ; but after inquiries made among a areat 
variety of persons, I feel warranted in saying, that, if there are any 
cases of this description, the number is altogether insignificant. 
This IS sufficient evidence of the value attached to education by 
the people of the parish; but matters having been always pretty 
much the same in this respect, there are no data, in the particular 
case, for ca culating the effect produced on moral habits by in, 
creased facilities of instruction.  

Similar circumstances to those that created occasion for an addi. 
tional church in the upper part of the parish, make an additional

school in the same place to be also wanted. The want would be 
greater, but that there is, at present, a private school in the upper 
part of the parish of Boyndie, so near the boundary of this parish 
as to accommodate a part of the population of its middle and up- 
per districts. 

Literary Institutions.— K Literary Society was instituted m 181 U, 
by five boys the most advanced of whom had only obtained the 
standing of three sessions at College. The institution originally 
embraced two objects,— the formation of a library, and meetings for 
delivery of essays and discussion of literary subjects. But the 
latter object was, after a time, necessarily abandoned, from the 
paucity of persons having resources for contributing to it. The 
library now contains above 2000 volumes. 

Connected with the Literary Society by a sort federal union, 
is the reading-room, where have been usually taken in five or six 
of the principal quarterly and monthly periodicals, two daily Lon- 
don, and some Edinburgh and provincial newspapers. Some dif- 
ficulty, however, has been found of late in supporting the expense 
of this establishment, and its continuance seems somewhat doubtful. 

In 1828 was founded an institution for the cultivation of science, 
and the discovery and encouragement of native talent. The in- 
stitution has occasionally held meetings for scientific discussions; 
but similar difficulties, as in the case of the Literary Society, have 
been felt in carrying this part of its plan into complete effect. 
Its conductors, however, have succeeded in collecting a museum of 
natural history, antiquities, and curiosities, which would do no 
discredit to ampler time and means, than have actually been en- 
joyed by them, and which, it is believed, few, if any, collections 
north of Edinburgh can equal. In particular, the collection of 
shells, consisting of many thousand specimens of the rarest and 
most beautiful kinds to be met with in Java, and throughout the 
eastern Archipelago, are well deserving of notice. There is a 
considerable variety of dresses, weapons, manufactures, and uten- 
sils of the natives of India and Australia ; many mineral and zoo- 
logical specimens, coins, idols, &amp;c. The institution also possesses 
some valuable books; among others, the printed Public Records of 
Great Britain, presented by Government; and, for scientific pur- 
poses, they are furnished with a transit and clock, a six feet reflecting 
telescope, together with an assortment of meteorological instruments 
from the best London makers. 

By the kindness of the magistrates, the two large drawing-rooms 



UANFF. 



53 



in the town-house have been allowed for the accommodation of the 
Literary Society and Scientific Institution. 

The Established Church, Episcopal, Secession, and Independ- 
ent chapels, have each a small library belonging to it. There is 
also a trades' library, open to master, journeymen, and apprentice, 
tradesmen. All these libraries are maintained by voluntary dona- 
tions, or subscriptions almost nominal. The collection belongmg 
to the Independent chapel was begun in 1814, and contains 320 
volumes. Here also there is a juvenile library of 364 volumes. 
The other collections are smaller. The advantages to be derived 
from these libraries, though not neglected, do not appear to be so 
eagerly sought after as might be wished. Probably the means at 
the disposal of the conductors will not always afford the selections 
best adapted for the readers.  

Benevolent Institutions. — About the year 1755, or soon after, Dr 
Alexander Strachan, physician in Banff, built a small house in the 
low part of the town, and left it, under the management of the ma- 
gistrates and kirk-session, as a residence to four poor persons, be- 
stowing, at the same time, a small sum of money and additional 
space of ground, now jointly yielding after payment of certain feu- 
duties an annual sum of L. 1, 3s. 6d. applicable to the upholding 
and repairs of the house. 

By a will, dated at Bombay, 7th November 1769, Mr George 
Smith, a native of the parish of Fordyce, in the county of Banff, 
vested in the magistrates of Banff the management of such residue 
of his estate as might arise out of certain legacies bequeathed by 
him to relatives of whose existence at the time he was uncertain ; 
and which, after the lapse of five years, might remain unclaimed 
by them : appointing the sum of L. 1000 to be applied to the en- 
dowing of an infirmary in Banff or Fordyce ; L. 25 yearly to be 
paid to the minister of Fordyce ; and L. 40 yearly to a school- 
master, to educate, at Fordyce, as many boys of the name of 
Smith as could be maintained, at the rate of L. 25 each, out of 
the interest of the final residue of the estate. As the handiest way 
of managing the affair of the infirmary or hospital, for which 
L. 1000 was held to be a rather slender provision, the magistrates 
formed the design of laying out a part of the town-house for a broth 
or soup-kitchen to the poor, in consideration of which they resolv- 
ed on applying the sum in question to the general expense of that

structure and this under the idea, it may be supposed, that they 
thereby, in effect, established an hospital for the admission and re- 
lief of persons labouring under the disease of an empty belly. Pa- 
tients of this class were accordingly, for a time, admitted, and dis- 
missed relieved. These, however, were soon succeeded by others 
of a different class, whose malady consisted in an inability to pay 
the penalties inflicted by excise courts ; and, at present, the only 
patient in the hospital is the Sheriff-clerk, whose complaint was 
ivant of room in the apartments otherwise allotted to him. To 
speak more plainly, the broth-kitchen became a prison, the prison 
a writing -chamber or record office ; but the departure, in this in- 
stance, from the testator's intentions, was more of chance or neces- 
sity than of design ; and, as there is now an ample provision for an 
infirmary otherwise, it needs not be regretted. Besides the be- 
quest for the hospital, however, the magistrates realized the sum 
of L. 10,297, 16s. 6d. three per cent, consols; and the yearly di- 
vidends L. 308, 18s. 8d. thence arising, are duly expended ac- 
cording to the directions of the will : nine boys, chosen by the ma- 
gistrates, receiving maintenance and education for five years each, 
in the manner specified. 

On the 2d July 1799, Mr James Wilson of the island of Gre- 
nada, directed, by will, « the whole stock" of his property, after 
the death of certain liferenters nominated, " to be drawn from 
the funds, and remitted to the magistrates of the burgh of Banff, 
North Britain, to be by them laid out as a charitable fund, in the 
best manner possible, and to remain under the directions of the 
acting magistrates from year to year," and without any more spe- 
cific instructions whatever. 

The last of the liferenters died only last year, and the magis- 
trates have realized L. 3561, 16s. Id. 3 per cents., and L. 2647 
of cash,— which, however, is less than half the actual sum left; 
the remaining, and greater part, being lost by the failure of the 
house in London to whom it was remitted. Every species of po- 
verty and distress in the parish being already as well provided for, 
otherwise, as can be beneficially done, it has been resolved to ap- 
ply Mr Wilson's bequest, jointly with some funds from other 
sources, to the purposes of education ; f and with this view, the

magistrates propose to erect a building  sufficient to embrace at 
once accommodation for an infant school, for a free school on the 
Madras system, and for class-rooms for the academy teachers, 
besides a library and museum; it being intended to admit the 
more promising boys from the free schools to the benefit of a more 
complete education in the classes of the academy. 

By a will dated 8th February 1819, Mr Alexander Cassy, a 
native of Banff, and then residing at Pentonville, near London, 
left the residue of his estate, after payment of certain legacies, 
in trust to the magistrates and town-council of Banff, — appointing 
" the interest accruing therefrom to be expended half-yearly, and 
every half-year, towards the support of poor, aged, and infirm per- 
sons, of both sexes, incapable of maintaining themselves by labour, 
born within the precincts of the said burgh, and helpless orphans, 
and other deserted children of both sexes, born as before, until 
they attain the age when they may be deemed capable of provid- 
ing for themselves. And I hereby declare it to be my desire, that 
those who become objects of this charity, shall be selected at the 
discretion of the majority of the aforesaid town-council, always 
giving the preference to the most necessitous." These are the 
whole directions contained in the will as to the mode of bestowing 
the charity ; but the magistrates, previously to entering on the 
administration of the funds, procured, for their more specific direc- 
tion, an opinion of counsel, by which they have since been guid- 
ed in the selection of cases for relief. 

Under the provisions of this will, the annual sum of L. 300, be- 
ing the dividends upon L. 10,000, 3 per cent, consols, fell, in the 
year 1824, to the disposal of the magistrates. A farther sum of 
L. 7000, 3 per cents., together with the value of a house at Pen- 
tonville, will fall in on the demise of certain liferenters named in 
the will. 

The average number of aged and infirm persons receiving re- 
lief from this fund since July 1824, is .59 ; smallest number at 
one time, 55 ; greatest, 66. The average number of famihes of 
children of one to six in each family, 28 ; smallest number, 24 ; 

• A chaste and classic design, furnished by Mr W. Robertson of Elgin, archi- 
tect, has already been adopted by the trustees. The eastern fa9adc is designed to 
be 154 feet long, and to consist of a portico in the centre, in the Grecian Ionic style, 
with side buildings and two protruding wings at the extremes, adorned with pilasters 
and entablatures in the same taste. The situation of the building on the ascent on the 
south-west of the town will be such as to give it every advantage, particularly when 
seen, from the road that approaches from the south, across the river, and over the trees 
environing Duff'- House park.

greatest, 35. Average of both classes, 87 ; smallest, 82 ; greatest 
96. The average payment at last distribution to each old per- 
son or young family, was at the rate of L. 2, 15s. per annum ; the 
highest being L. 4, 10s.; lowest, L. 1. L. 10 per annum is paid 
to the teacher of Pirie's school for instructing boys, and L. 5 to 
the teacher of the female charity school for instructing girls on 
the bounty. 

By a will dated 7th May 1825, Miss Elizabeth Wilson, an un- 
married female residing in Banff, pursuing an intention that had 
been mutually formed between her and her deceased brother, Mr 
John Wilson, baker there, bequeathed, to certain official and pri- 
vate trustees, the whole heritable and moveable property of which 
she should die possessed, with directions to apply the yearly produce 
of the same, with immaterial deductions, in equal annuities, to six 
tradesmen and six maiden women of the age of fifty years or upwards, 
and who have resided in Banff twenty years. The will also directs that 
L. 2 yearly should be laid out in the purchase of books selected by 
the minister for the use of the annuitants ; each of whom is far- 
ther to receive, on appointment, a Bible and book of devotion. 
Annuitants are named by a majority of the trustees. The ave- 
rage amount paid to each hitherto has been L. 9 or L. 10 per an- 
num. 

Alexander Chalmers, Esq. of Cluny, who died last year, left a 
settlement, jointly executed by himself and spouse, by which he 
appointed the whole of his heritable and moveable property sub- 
ject to certain legacies and annuities, and to Mrs Chalmers's life- 
rent, to be vested in trustees, for the " founding, erection, and 
endowment of an hospital and free dispensary of medicines," 
to be called " Chalmers's Hospital,"—" for the support, mainte- 
nance, cure, and relief of destitute sick paupers, lunatics, and 
other diseased and poor infirm persons of both sexes, born, domi- 
ciliated, and resident in any town or parish of the said county of 
Banff, the inhabitants whereof shall make collections for the in- 
stitution at their respective parish churches," &amp;c. — the site of 
Mr Chalmers's residence in the sea-town of Banff being at the 
same time assigned as that of the hospital to be erected. The 
trustees named for the management of this bequest are the Lord 
Lieutenant of the County ; Member for the County ; Sheriffs- 
depute and substitute ; Provost ; Ministers of Banff, Gamrie, and 
Marnoch ; President of Society of Solicitors, and Peter and John 
A. Cameron, Esqs.— three a quorum.

The whole value of heritable and moveable property which will 
eventually be available for this charity is supposed not to fall 
short of L. 40,000. 

A Female Clothing Society has been for some years establish- 
ed, which expends about L. 13 annually, raised by subscription 
among members and others, in providing clothes and fuel to poor 
persons. There are besides one or two annual distributions of 
coals in the winter season, from bequests made by benevolent in- 
dividuals. 

Provident Institutions. — The friendly societies which have had 
their regulations sanctioned under the new act, are, Solomon's 
Lodge of Gardeners, instituted in April 1778; Adam's Lodge of 
Gardeners, and the Mason's Operative Lodge. These, with St 
Andrew's Mason Lodge, are all the friendly societies unless the 
trades' incorporations, whose objects are similar, may be reckoned 
such, existing in the parish. The Graystone Friendly Society 
established in 1792; the Ploughman's 1801; the Sailors' 
1813; and some more of later birth, have been dissolved within 
the last few years. Few of the members of them were inclined 
to take the trouble of conforming to the new act, — as few it is 
suspected averse to a present division of their funds. All these 
institutions, however, have gradually been suffering decay. In 
this, as in most other things, there is a fashion ; and here the 
fashion has declined. Indeed, such societies are seldom entered 
so much with prudential objects in view, as for purposes of amuse- 
ment and good fellowship. It is remarked, too, that these associa- 
tions were never conducted upon sound principles, — the allowances 
being graduated, not according to a scientific calculation of the 
average proportion between contributions and claims, but in the 
ratio of the absolute number of contributors. The allowances 
granted at present by any of these societies are inconsiderable. 

To the principle of friendly societies the objection has been 
made, that they bear, in some respects, too near an alliance to a 
game of chances ; and that each person, trusting too much to the 
benefit he himself may enjoy at the expense of others, is thereby 
led to neglect sounder precautions against future necessity. From 
this objection, it is added, savings banks are free : here each man 
gets just his own savings, and hence, as alleged, the superiority of 
the savings banks over friendly societies. But though some, on 

"At the present moment June 1836, the trades' incorporations are in the course 
of being broken up, and the funds divided.

these grounds, prefer the principle of savings banks, still friendly 
societies seem generally to be reckoned highly beneficial in their 
nature, — supposing their management such as to let their operation 
have fair play. 

The Banff Savings Bank was established in 1815. For the

posited by them, has been as follows, viz.

The amount of funds from this bank in the hands of the Com- 
mercial Bank of Scotland is about L. 2900. The investments are 
generally made by men and women servants from Banff and neigh- 
bouring parishes. 

Pauperism. — The poor of the parish are provided for, partly 
from the funds of the kirk-session, partly by an annual subscription 
among the inhabitants. 

Besides the ordinary church collections, the kirk-session draws 
annually in rents and interest the sum of L. 28, 9s. 4d. 

A certain number of poor persons in the parish receive, direct- 
ly from the kirk-session, a regular weekly or quarterly allowance, 
at the rate of from 5s. to L. 2, 12s. a-year each. 

The kirk-session has a farther expenditure for extraordinary 
aids, and for allowances to persons residing out of the parish, but 
who have acquired a claim to relief by former residence. 

The affairs of the remaining poor of the parish are managed 
by a committee chtsen annually by the subscribers to the fund, 
and which is divided into sub-committees for the several districts. 

Along with the amount of the subscriptions, and occasional 
windfalls, the committee have L. 100 annually placed at their dis- 
posal by the kirk-session. 

Cases for relief are selected, and the rates to each individual 
fixed, by the committee, which meets twice a-year. The allow- 
ances are, for the most part, paid weekly, and range from 6d. to Is. 
6d. to each person, — a few quarterly from 2s. 6d. to 10s.

The system now described was first adopted in 1817, chiefly with 
a view to the suppression of common street begging, an end which 
it has effectually enough answered, — though by no means so as to 
supersede the necessity for private almsgiving, and occasional col- 
lections for special cases of distress; and, taken generally, as a plan 
of pauper management, its operation appears to have been, on the 
whole, satisfactory. 

It is, however, a circumstance well worth remark, that an addi- 
tional annual expenditure since the year 18'24 of nearly L. 300 
from Cassie's bounty, as already described, has had so far from 
a proportional effect in lessening the amount required to be raised 
otherwise.f Few or none, indeed, of the persons on the general 
poor's fund are those who are receiving, at the same time, an al- 
lowance from Cassie's bequest. But the latter class of persons, 
being only the next above the former, and that from which the ranks 
of the regular poor may be supposed to be filled, — the two funds 
may, in estimating the effect of an increased provision for the poor, 
be set down as one. It would, of course, be an error to say that 
Cassie's bounty has not been productive of benefit : it must, to its 
extent, have saved distress or privation that would have been other- 
wise felt : but an additional proof has been afforded by it, in the 
present instance — if, indeed, experience were needed to prove what 
may be pronounced before hand — that an increase of funds for the 
maintenance of the poor will not lessen the number of the poor. 

" For the last two years tlerehave generally been three services in the church each 
Sunday, and a resident heritor's contribution to the collections. 

t The average sum expended by the Poors' Committee for eiglit years, 1817-24, 
was L.327 ; number of poor, 156; average sum for five years, 1831-35, L. 216 ; num- 
ber, 95 ; making only a reduction of L. 1 11 on the sum, 61 on the number. It is be- 
lieved, too, that it is not so much a lessening of the demand as of the supply that oc- 
casions even this difference — several families who were liberal contributors having 
died away or removed.

Applications for assistance from charitable funds are stated to be 
increasing in frequency in the parish ; and it seems to be the opi- 
nion of all who have the means of observing, that feelings of dis- 
inclination to resort to such assistance are fast wearing off. There 
is good reason for suspecting, besides, that the existence of so 
many charitable institutions in the parish has been the means of 
attracting poor persons to come from a distance to settle m it. 
Priso7t.— The number of prisoners confined in Banff jail for 

three years has been as follows :

Criminals, - - 15 1« 4&amp;

Looking to the strength of the walls of the prison, the solidity 
of its window gratings, and the ponderous iron door which shuts in 
its main passage, one would scarcely suppose a prisoner could have 
much chance of escape ; yet, in some instances, escapes have 
been made from it, and in others, attempts to escape have only 
been discovered when almost on the point of success. — Some years 
ao-o, a few Crown debtors were confined for enormous penalties, 
incurred for contravention of the excise laws ; and on this occasion, 
so little dependence were the inhabitants disposed to place in the 
power of walls or bolts to retain the captives, that, having the fear 
of the Exchequer before their eyes it being understood that the 
town would be liable for payment of the penalties if the prisoners 
escaped, they turned out, every night, in companies of four or six 
by rotation, to guard the doors and windows of the prison. Still 
the prison may be said to be well secured. It is also entirely fire- 
proof. But it is decidedly deficient in accommodation. There 
are only two apartments for the reception of civil prisoners, each 
19 feet square ; and it is understood that a burgess of the town, 
if confined in one of these, has the power to exclude from it all 
others who may not possess that happy distinction. Unfortunate- 
ly, he cannot exclude them from the prison altogether. Instances 
have occurred in which ten or twelve persons have been huddled 
together, day and night, in one of these apartments, or with only 
the additional accommodation of the narrow passage into which 
the apartments open. There are frequently six or eight persons 
in one of them. The situation of the prison is airy enough, 



BAM-'F. 



61 



but there is no court-yard to which the prisoners have access. 
There are, besides the civil prisons, two cells for criminals. In 
these there are no fire-places ; and, even in the depth of winter, 
the wretched inmate has nothing furnished him but a bed-stead. 
Light and air are admitted through a narrow slit in the wall, which, 
till lately, was unglazed. So unfit, however, have these dungeons 
been conceived to be, for the reception of any human being, that 
criminals have, in fact, necessarily been allowed to encroach on the 
accommodation of the debtors. These prisons are on the second 
story. On the ground floor is a pretty large vault, with windows 
opening into a narrow court, in which female prisoners are gene- 
rally lodged together, without respect to the cause of their deten- 
tion. There is also, on the ground floor, a dungeon, lately con- 
structed which, assuming that the office of a dungeon is to make 
human existence wretched, seems to want nothing that can con- 
tribute to such a purpose, except the being fairly under ground. 
It is entirely in the interior of the building, and cut off from all 
direct communication with external light or air, — the small grat- 
ing in the door opening only into a half-dark passage. This is 
said to be intended only for the temporary reception of persons 
disturbing the public peace by brutal drunkenness or other outra- 
geous behaviour. It does not appear, that until within these few 
months, any regular means were employed for preserving cleanli- 
ness, either as regards the apartments and furniture, or the per- 
sons and dress of the prisoners, except that water was carried in- 
to them by the jailors. 

The jail is entirely under the government or superintendence of 
the magistrates. Criminals are allowed 3d. a-day, paid by the 
county, before conviction ; by the burgh, after it. Debtors without 
other means of subsistence receive an aliment from the imprison- 
ing creditor, the amount of which is fixed by the magistrates. It 
varies generally from 8d. to 2s. 6d. per day. 

Fairs. — The town is allowed by charters to hold seven or eight 
fairs or markets yearly, but only four are held ; and of these but 
one Brandon fair, at Whitsunday, is of any magnitude. This, as 
well as the Martinmas and Lammas, are feeing markets. There 
are no cattle-markets. 

Inns and Alehouses. — There are 38 inns or shops licensed for 
the sale of ale and spirits, — all within the liberties of the burgh. 
The general opinion seems to be, that the number of such houses 
adds to the prevalence of tippling, and undoubtedly this vice pre- 



02 



BANFFSHIRE. 



vails in the town to a considerable extent. But while some sup- 
pose that habits of drinking have their origin in causes which would 
work alike, independently of the greater or smaller number of li- 
censed houses, others, admitting the evil of licensing a house, but 
from necessity, in a district where there is yet no other, maintain 
that a small number of taverns or alehouses in a neighbourhood 
where there must be some, has a direct tendency to increase dis- 
sipation, from the greater number of visitors who must necessarily 
resort to one place, and the consequent more frequent and easy for- 
mation of drinking parties. 

A strong belief seems to be generally entertained of the perni- 
cious effects of spirit-shops, as distinct from inns or taverns, in so 
much as the former more especially when furnishing, as some of 
them do, a private room for tipphng, afford opportunities and temp- 
tations to many persons who would be averse to be seen frequent- 
ing the tavern. 

jPuel — Coals; but as" there is a peat-moss at the inland extre- 
mity of the parish, peats are, especially in its vicinity, more or less 
used. The average price of coals mostly from Sunderland is 
about Is. Od. per barrel of 2 imperial bushels. Carriage in the 
town about Id. per barrel more. Peats, in the town, cost from 2s. 
to 3s. per load, according to the size of the cart. 

Comparative State. 

The chief differences that have occurred in regard to the state 
and circumstances of the parish since the last Statistical Ac- 
count was drawn up, have been sufficiently indicated under the 
different heads comprehended in the present report. The ex- 
tension of cultivation, and the use of an improved mode of hus- 
bandry, — the establishment of the herring fishery, — the increase 
of the corn exports, and introduction of the system of exporting live 

cattle, the formation of turnpike roads, and multiplication and 

improvement of the means of communication, — the discontinuance 
ofsmugghng,— the expensive, though not quite efficient, additions 
to the harbour, — the establishment of new congregations and places 
of worship, — the institution of libraries, — the valuable bequests and 
endowments made to the town, — the increased conveniences from 
gas hghts, baths, and the like — may just be referred to as among 
the most striking alterations. In regard to moral and social changes, 
there is not much to remark. Like all other places in the king- 
dom, the town partook of the fictitious and temporary prosperity 
arising from the anticipations of the national revenue made during 



DESKFORD. 



63 



the war ; and, like all other places, when the product of these an- 
ticipations was once expended, and the permanent burden they en- 
tailed began to be felt, it suffered from the transition. In the first 
period, there was a general start upwards of every rank in society, 
each occupying the place of the one next above it. ■ The revulsion 
was necessarily in proportion. Numerous failures among the mer- 
chants and tradesmen took place after the peace ; and no little 
difficulty was sustained by others, whose circumstances were not so 
necessarily made apparent. Perhaps the increased facilities of 
bank accommodation which began to be afforded about that time, 
augmented the evil. But the worst is now past ; matters have re- 
turned to their natural level ; and nothing seems wanting, but the 
continuance of foreign and domestic tranquillity, to enable the com- 
munity to realize as much prosperity as, under national and local 
circumstances hardly admitting of alteration, the human condition 
is usually known to allow.

<p>
PRESBYTERY OF FORDYCE, AND SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. GEORGE INNES, MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The present name of this parish, there is reason to be- 
heve, is the only name which it has borne since its erection ; and 
is supposed to have reference to its situation and climate with re- 
gard to CuUen, with which it has, of all places, the most intercourse. 
Deskford lies to the south of Cullen, and being farther from the 
coast, the climate is naturally colder than that of Cullen ; hence, 
the name Deskford has been derived from Chess fure which sig- 
nifies " a cold place to the southward." 

Extent and Boundaries. — The length of this parish is rather 
more than 5 miles, and its breadth somewhat above 3. It is bound- 
ed, on the south, by Grange ; on the west, by Rathven ; on the 

• Fordyce, from which Deskford was probably disjoined, is said to have the same 
etymology. The climate of the greater part of both is similar, and the name, invert- 
ing the syllables, is also similar.

north, by Cullen, or that part of Rathven annexed quoad sacra to 
Cullen ; and on the east, by Fordyce. 

Topographical Appearances.— T\\e form of the parish is nearly 
that of a parallelogram. It is intersected by a small stream called 
the burn of Deskford, which rises in the adjoining parish of Grange, 
and is increased in its course through Deskford by many stream- 
lets from the rising grounds on each side of it, running down small 
glens or ravines, beautifully fringed with natural wood on each side 
of them, as is the burn or main stream into which they run. So 
that Deskford forms one of the most beautiful little straths in the 
whole country. 

The impetuosity of the little streams in thaws or floods, rolling 
and bounding down their steep and rocky channels, and of the 
burn, which is then swelled into a large size, sweeping majestical- 
ly along, is grand and striking. There is, as may be supposed, a 
variety of small waterfalls ; and there is one called the Linn, which 
is singularly beautiful. The water is hemmed within a very nar- 
row channel, in the deep cleft of a great rock, the entrance of 
which it has beautifully scooped and polished; and it throws itself at 
several successive bounds to a depth of nearly thirty feet. The 
scenery around is exceedingly romantic and beautiful. 

The high ground on the east side of the strath, at its south or 
upper end, is partly planted with larch and common fir. It is cal- 
led the Green-hill. That on the west or opposite side is of a mossy 
nature, and is generally covered with heath, except small patches 
here and there, which have been cultivated, the number and ex- 
tent of which are gradually increasing. At the north or lower 
end of the strath, the ground is cultivated on the east side to the 
very top of the hill ; and on the west or opposite side it is covered 
with fir and other thriving wood. The low ground, throughout the 
whole length of the strath, is almost wholly cultivated, except 
where the precipitous banks of the burns or ravines prevent it. But 
these being covered with natural wood, add much to the variety 
and beauty of the scenery. 

Climate. — The climate is rather cold and wet. But, if we may 
judge from the general health and longevity of the inhabitants, 
it cannot be considered as peculiarly unwholesome. And even its 

• ITiese patches are cultivated by small tenants, to whom the proprietor lets the 
eround in lots of from eight to twelve or twenty acres, for seven years, rent free ; and 
after that, for Is. or Is. 4d. per acre for a period of nineteen years, — after which the 
land is let for such moderate rent as it is judged worth.

humidity must be undergoing a fiivourable change, from the drain- 
ing and cultivation which are carried on. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The general soil of the parish, in 
the lower parts of it, is black loam upon a hard clay bottom. In 
the higher grounds, the soil is mossy, upon a hard impervious bot- 
tom of clay and gravel mixed. This renders draining, in almost 
all parts of the parish, of the greatest necessity and importance, 
and it has of late been much resorted to, and with much advan- 
tage. 

There is in the parish an excellent quarry of primitive limestone, 
The lime is of very superior fineness and strength. Large quanti- 
ties of it are prepared by the tenantry, partly for sale, and partly 
for their own use in agriculture and in building. 

There is, likewise, an extensive moss in the parish, from which 
the inhabitants are supplied with peat and turf, and from which they 
supply Cullen and some of the adjoining villages upon the coast. 

The parish, in so far as can be ascertained from the channels 
and banks of the burns and ravines, and other openings which have 
made, seems to rest chiefly upon strata of mica-slate, nearly verti- 
cal. Fragments of quartz are frequently found imbedded in the 
slate, but never to any considerable size. There is much reason 
to think that all this part of the country has, at some remote pe- 
riod, been under water, as almost all the higher grounds, upon par- 
mg off a surface coat of vegetable mould, which is of no great 
depth, except where the moss has much accumulated, are found to 
consist of gravel, or clay and gravel mixed. 

Botany.—Theve is not, as far as the writer knows, any rare spe- 
cies of plants found in the parish. The natural wood, which grows 
along the sides of the burn and smaller streams, is chiefly alder, 
hazel, gean, and birch. The planted wood is common fir, a small 
proportion of larch, and a still smaller of ash, beech, and oak, the 
whole of which thrive sufficiently well in most of the places where 
they have been tried. There are, in an orchard adjoining to the 
church, some very fine large ashes measuring from eight to twelve 
feet m circumference. One of them is of the latter dimensions, in 
girth, at the height of ten feet from the ground. But of the two trees 
called St John's, and young St John's, commemorated in the former 
Statistical Account, the grandeur is now entirely gone. The lat- 
ter was, by an act of presumption and bad taste, and without autho- 
rity from the Noble proprietor or his factor, cut down upwards of 
twenty years ago; and of the former, nothing now remains but a

very small part of the trunk, hollowed, scathed and withered, send- 
ing forth only one small solitary green branch, produced apparently 
since the former wide-spreading boughs gave way, and likely soon 
also to wither and disappear as they have done. The very fine 
holly, also commemorated in that Account, which consisted of a 
trunk about eight feet in circumference, separating into two beau- 
tiful straight stems at about eight feet from the ground, has now only 
one of these stems standing ; and that stem is also in a very fragile 
state, from pervading and consuming rot, which first disparted the 
stems to the very ground, then rendered one of them incapable of 
standing, and will soon do the same to the other. Thus the principal 
ornaments of this delightful spot, once so abundant in excellent fruit 
as well as in stately trees, are now either entirely gone, or are fast 
hastening to decay. There are, however, besides the ashes already 
mentioned, in a growing state, which may in time perhaps be not 
inferior to their sires,— a holly bush, one of the stems of which is 5 
feet in circumference ; and a hawthorn tree, 4 feet in circumfe- 
rence. There is likewise, in another part of the parish somewhat 
lower down, also by the burn side, a hawthorn tree of much larger 
dimensions. It is 8 feet round at the height of 6 feet from the 
ground, and its wide-spreading umbrageous top, when richly co- 
vered with flourish or with berries, is singularly striking and beau- 
tiful. 

II. — Civil History. 

This parish has long been the property of the Earls of Findla- 
ter and Seafield. The date of its erection into a parish, the writer 
has no means of ascertaining. 

Parochial Registers,— There are parochial registers as far back 
as 1669 : and the register of births and marriages is continuous 
from that time to the present. There is no record of the pro- 
ceedings of the kirk-session earlier than 1684. The record con- 
tinues to 1687. There is then a blank till 1694, from which time 
the record seems to have been kept with tolerable accuracy till 
1731, when there is another blank till 1734. This is attributed 
to the carelessness of the then session-clerk, who had left only " a 
few confused scraps, which nobody could connect." 

Antiquities.— There was found, about twenty years ago, on the 
confines of a farm called Liechestown, the resemblance of a swine's 
head in brass, of the ordinary size, with a wooden tongue moveable 
by springs. It had also eyes, and the resemblance in every respect 
was wonderfully exact. It was found at a depth of about six feet, in a 



BESKPORD. 



67 



mossy and knolly piece of ground upon a bed of clay. The ground 
abounded with hazel-nuts, which looked entire, but, upon being open- 
ed, were found empty. This antique curiosity is now in possession 
of the Banff Institution, to which it was presented by the Honour- 
able Colonel Grant, to whom it was given by the tenant who 
found it on his farm. The place where it was found is close by 
the confines of another farm, called Inalterie, which is supposed 
to mean the place of the altar, and where there are the remains of a 
very old strong massive building, the nature of which cannot now be 
ascertained, and respecting which there is no tradition. In one part of 
this building, there is a deep circular hole, about the diameter of an 
ordinary draw-well, inclosed by a wall of masonry, rising to a consi- 
derable height in the building. This hole is now filled up with 
rubbish to a level with the surface of the ground. What had been 
the original purpose of it cannot now be ascertained. Perhaps it 
had been intended as a " dry pit" for the solitary confinement of 
offending individuals. Close to it, there is a vault, on the top of 
which the tenant has now his kail-yard. Some years ago, an at- 
tempt was made to explore this vault. A stair was found leading 
down to it. A heavy rain, however, coming on at the time, and 
filling the place with water, the work was interrupted, and has 
never been resumed. Whether this ruin be that of a baronial or 
ecclesiastical edifice, it is not perhaps now possible to determine ; 
though the name Inalterie, and the artificial head already men- 
tioned, which was probably contrived for some purpose of impos- 
ture, or " lying wonder," would rather incline us to suppose it to 
be the rum of some ecclesiastical building, erected in those remote 
ages, when ignorance, superstition, imposture, and tyranny were 
so prevalent. 

In the immediate vicinity of this ruin, there was, till lately, a 
conical artificial eminence, called the Law Hillock, and supposed 
to have been at one time the seat from which justice was dis- 
tributed. It is now demolished, the tenant having found the stones, 
ot which it chiefly consisted, very convenient for the building of his 
otiices ; a purpose to which the stones of the adjoining ruin re- 
fused to be subservient, obstinately resisting every effort made to 
separate them. 

There is also on the other side of the burn of Deskford, within 
view ot the former, and about half a mile from it, another hillock 

flatirn tf' f- '"' '' ''""'"'y P" -nd 
«at upon the top,-which is of an elliptical shape, about 30 feet by 



68 



BANFFSHIRE. 



18 feet. It is surrounded at the base by a ditch, one part of which 
forms the bed of a small stream \\h\ch runs past it, and is called 
the Ha' burn, as the hillock is called the Ha' hillock, and is said also 
to have been a hall of law or justice. In a fine day, it would still be 
a most convenient and delightful place for such a purpose— incoin- 
parably preferable to a close and crowded court-house. There is 
a gateway over the ditch, by which suitors could approach. There 
is sufficient room in the area on the top, for the court, and a mo- 
derate share of witnesses on both sides, while the assembled multi- 
tudes below would be completely under the eye of the authorities 
above. 

There is likewise close to the church, the ruin of an old tower 
or castle, called the Tower of Deskford, which had been the fa- 
mily residence of the chief proprietor in the parish. The south 
wall of this old building and the north wall of the church are in 
immediate contact, and there is reason to think, that there had 
been a door of communication between the two, and that the church 
had been the family chapel, at the same time that it afforded ac- 
commodation for the people of the surrounding district, when as- 
sembled together for religious worship. This tower was, till lately, 
a very prominent and interesting feature in the scenery ; but, owing 
to the masonry having got into so loose and incohesive a state, as 
to occasion danger of its being blown down, and overwhelming the 
church, which it greatly overtopped, it was some years ago pulled 
down. — Of the Castle of Skeith, mentioned in the former Sta- 
tistical Account as a striking ruin, there is now no vestige. — The 
church is a very ancient building, and was evidently erected before 
the Reformation. It contains accommodations not now necessary in 
parochial churches— as recesses in the walls behind the doors for 
the vessels with holy water. It is said to have been dedicated to 
St John. Beside it, is St John's well, the spring or stream supply- 
ing which issues almost as it were from beneath the church. Close 
to St John's well is the once stately tree, dedicated to the same 
saint, which has been already mentioned, and of which so small a 
fragment is all that now remains. 

Modern Buildings.— There is no modern or other building of 
any note in the parish. There are two meal mills, one of them 

• The apprehension of this injury to the church was excited by two immense mas- 
ses of the same building in another part having fallen down, one above the other. 
Had these two masses fallen together in one continuous sweep, they would have ine- 
vitably crushed a small house quite near with its poor inhabitants. This hint was

with a kiln and barley mill attached to it, and there are eight

III. — Population. 
The ancient state of the population previous to the return made 
to Dr Webster, when its amount was 940, there are no means of as- 
certaining. Between the date of that return and of the former Statis- 
tical Account, a period of about forty years, there appears to have 
been a decrease of 188, and between that and the census of 1811 
there appears to have been a further decrease of 118, owing, in 
both cases, most probably, to the diminution of the number of 
crofters and subtenants. Since the census of 1811, there has been 
a gradual increase, occasioned, no doubt, in some degree, by the 
encouragement given to settlers in the uncultivated parts of the 
parish, near the moss.

The yearly average of marriages for the last seven years is 4i

There IS no family of rank or of independent fortune, and there 
IS no landed proprietor, residing in the parish. The number of 
unmarried men, bachelors and widowers upwards of 50 years of 
age, is 8; and of unmarried women upwards of 45, 26. The ave 
rage number of children in each family is 4. There are 2 persons 
m the parish occasionally insane; 3 rather in a fatuous state, and 
till within these few months there was one very aged female blind, 
who died m the ninety-first year of her age

for the most part, on vegetable food, the produce of their own 
corn and potatoe fields and kailyards. If, to this very sober fare 
they were permitted to add the exhilarating beverage of a little 
small beer, they would be very thankful ; but this, they have been 
for many years prevented from enjoying by the very heavy duty upon 
malt, amounting, when barley is at its lowest price, and of course, 
when they can least bear it, to upwards of 100 per cent., and by the 
vexatious restrictions which have till lately attended this enormous 
duty. The illicit distillation of whisky, till the excise laws upon that 
head were rendered more moderate and judicious, was very preva- 
lent among them, and was of course attended with its usual de- 
moralizing effects. There is now perhaps no such thing in the 
parish ; though certainly the government's repeatedly tampering 
with these laws in the way they have done is calculated to repro- 
duce it. It is, however, apprehended, that habits which, under so 
baneful a system were contracted, have not in every instance been 
got the better of. 

During the last three years there have been 5 illegitimate births 
in the parish.

cut down for herring-barrel staves, as was compatible with keep- 
ing up the natural beauty of the place ; while in some of the fir 
plantations, a little more thinning would be favourable to their 
health and vigour. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of arable land in the parish 

resting to mention, that his trin daughters, if we may use a word which is seldom 
needed, are all alive and in good health. It may also be interesting to mention other 
two singular facts relating to the same family, — for four successive generations they 
have held an office in the eldership ; and the fifth generation of the family is now upon 
the same farm.

The wages of masons are ls.6d.50f wrights, Is. 6d., and of tailors Is., 
— all with victuals. 

Live-Stock. — The breeds of cattle and of sheep are of a mixed 
kind. Great improvements have of late been made in the way of 
draining and cultivation. Lime and bone manure are both used 
with excellent effect, when the soil is rendered dry. Considerable 
quantities of fish manure are likewise used even by some of the 
tenants in the upper parts of the parish. The leases are in ge- 
neral for nineteen years. The farm-buildings are mostly of an 
inferior description. The proprietor allows for houses built of 
stone and lime, slated, and upon a plan approved of, to the extent 
of two years rent ; but as this is either not paid till the termina- 
tion of the lease, or, if given at the commencement, high interest 
is charged, — the encouragement is not found to be very great. The 
style of the buildings has, however, of late been somewhat improved. 
Slating is more used ; and there are now few or no black or feal 
houses. Even the very poorest contrive to get them built of stone 
and mortar of some kind or other. 

Quarries. — The excellent limestone quarry, which is in the 
upper end of the parish, has been already mentioned, and is of 
great advantage to Deskford and part of the adjoining district. 
There are no other quarries of any value or extent, and good 
stones for building are rather scarce. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce raised in 
the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is,

Manufactures.— There was, as already mentioned, till lately, a 
bleachfield in the parish. It was established as early as 1752, 
under the patronage of the then Lord Deskford, afterwards Earl 
of Findlater and Seafield, a nobleman whose enlightened zeal for 

" One of the modes which his Lordship adopted, for the accomplishment of his pa- 
triotic and enlightened objects, was to bring from the south, where the subjects were 
then better understood, persons well acquainted with agriculture and manufactures 
to settle on his estate, and to exemplify and conduct the improvements which he me' 
cutated ; and likewise by inducing the sons of the most respectable of his tenants tn 
l'X''''''''''y'o,c subjects. yhre they were then most thoroughly un- 



BANFFSHIRE. 



the agricultural and manufacturing improvement of this part of the 
country is still held in grateful respect and admiration. This 
bleachfield continued a profitable concern for many years to the 
manufacturer who held it, as well as furnished the means of sup- 
port to a considerable number of people in the neighbourhood em- 
ployed at it. From the falling oif, however, of the linen trade in 
this quarter, it has turned out latterly quite a losing concern, and 
has been given up ; the machinery remaining a dead stock on the 
owner's hand, and the bleachfield being converted into corn-land. 
But the loss to him and to the people employed in his work, is not 
the sole disadvantage which has resulted from the change as- to 
the linen trade. At one time, there were a good many thousand 
pounds annually brought by it into this parish and neighbourhood. 
There was not a house in Deskford, nor in any part of the adjoin- 
ing country, without one or more spinning-wheels in it. There 
was not a female among the labouring classes who did not learn 
to spin ; and even many of those who did not depend for support 
upon the industry of their hands, thought it not beneath them to 
learn the use of this simple small machine. When females be- 
came unfit for the more laborious occupation of household or 
farm-servants, this was their resource, and they could earn at it 
from 4d. to 6d. per day, which was quite adequate for their sup- 
port. But at the rate at which they are now paid, their earn- 
ings, even with the same industry and exertion, scarcely amount 
to one-third of that ; and many of the aged and feeble hardly in the 
live long day make out the sum of one single halfpenny. Yet still 
even that is an object to them, for it is 3d. in the week, and the occu- 
pation is an object to those who can find nothing else to do. Even 
the aged lady of ninety-seven, who has been mentioned, is not com- 
fortable unless she can have her wheel before her, and be " drawing 
out a thread." Accordingly, when any fresh supply of flax comes to 
the parish, which is but seldom and scantily procured, and more out 
of charity than any other motive, there is the greatest possible 
scramble among the old women to get a share of it. They will 
travel miles and even to other parishes to obtain it ; and if they come 
home without it, the disappointment is very great. Political 
economists are of opinion, that there is no great hardship in chang- 
ing employment from one species of industry to another. But, 
whatever public or ultimate advantage may occasionally result from 
such changes, there is no one who considers the power of habit on 
human capabilities and character, who will question that a vast deal

of Individual misery and distress is very often the result of such 
changes. And in nothing does this lamentable consequence more 
strikingly force itself upon our view, than in the effect which the 
recent improvements in machinery for spinning have had upon the 
comforts of the female peasantry of Scotland. He will certainly 
entitle himself to their distinguished gratitude, and that of every 
friend of humanity, who will contrive or lead to the introduction of 
some means of employing their industry, as generally applicable and 
useful, as was at one time the spinning-wheel. The young women 
are of course not learning the use of it ; and without some employ- 
ment suited to them in their declining years they must become a 
public burden. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication, Sj-c, — There is no market-town in 
the parish. The nearest market-town is Cullen, where also 
is the nearest post-oftlce. The distance of Cullen from the 
centre of Deskford is about four miles. But what must appear 
rather extraordinary is, that in Deskford, till lately, there has 
not been one foot of turnpike road. The inconvenience of this 
to the parish and to the public has been long most deeply felt, 
as through Deskford is the great thoroughfare from Keith to 
Cullen. What aggravated the evil to the parish was, that this 
th oroughfare required so much to keep it in repair, that little 
or none of the commutation money levied in the parish could 
be applied for making or improving the necessary cross roads. 
But whatever difficulties stood in the way of this most important 
accommodation have been now removed, and there is at last a very 
excellent turnpike along the whole line from Keith to Cullen, 
which will be of immense advantage to both these places, and the 
whole of the interjacent country ; and the more so, that there be- 
ing now a pretty good harbour at Cullen, it is likely to become 
the sea-port of Keith and the adjoining country. Another advan- 
tage resulting from this improvement is, that it will admit of the 
commutation money raised in the parish being applied to the mak- 
ing and improving of the other necessary roads. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The situation of the parish church is ex- 
ceedingly convenient, being in the very centre of the parish, and 
not three miles from any one extremity of it. It appears to have 
been built, as already mentioned, before the Reformation ; the exact 
time is uncertain. It is in pretty good repair, but it is not ceiled ; 
and is rather small, in its present accommodations, for the parish.. 



74 



BANFFSHIRE. 



This no doubt might, in some degree, be remedied, by the erecting 
of a new gallery between the two already erected at the ends. But 
other alterations would be requisite. There is sufficient accommoda- 
tion for 357 people, but it is desirable that upwards of 400 should be 
accommodated. These inconveniences, it is hoped, will ere long be 
remedied. All the sittings are free, with the exception of those in 
one of the galleries, which was erected by the heritor, and seated 
by the kirk-session. The rents, however, in this gallery are not 
very burdensome, being in no case more than 6d. per annum for 
each sitter, and some of the back seats only 3d. 

The manse was built about fifty years ago, and received a tho- 
rough repair, and partial enlargement about six years ago. It is 
an exceedingly commodious and good house. The extent of the 
glebe is about 8 imperial acres, and may be worth about as many 
pounds annually. The stipend amounts to 14 chalders, half meal 
and half barley, with L. 1, 15s. 3/2 d., arising from a mortification 
made in 1675, by Mr Robert Sharpe, Sheriff-clerk of Banffshire, 
tooether with L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. 

There is no dissenting or other chapel in the parish. The 
whole of the people, with the exception of about six individuals, 
belong to the Established Church, and are in general pretty re- 
gular in attending public worship in the parish church, the only 
one which they either desire or need. The average number of 
communicants is about 330. 

There has been lately an association formed in the parish in 
connexion with a presbyterial association, for promoting the spread 
of the Gospel in connexion with the Church of Scotland. The ob- 
jects are partly parochial, and partly general. The general objects 
are, — the promoting of church extension, the circulation of the Bible, 
the Assembly's Schools, the India Mission, and Colonial Churches. 
The parochial objects are, — keeping up and extending the Sabbath 
school library, procuring Bibles for poor people in the parish, either 
gratis or at a reduced price, as circumstances may require, and aid- 
ing poor people in the education of their children, by paying such 
proportion of the school fees as may be deemed requisite. It is 
intended that one-half of the funds shall be applicable to parochial, 
the other to general purposes, — the latter, though received and re- 
mitted by the presbytery, to be distributed as the contributors shall

minister.

direct. The contributions are to be made quarterly. For the current 
quarter, which is the first, they have been upwards of L. 3, and it 
is hoped that, with an improving appreciation of the objects, they will 
increase. The people were formerly in the habit of occasionally 
collecting in church for most of the above objects, but not so fre- 
quently or regularly as their importance merited. They have also 
had regular annual collections for the Aberdeen Infirmary, and for 
a pauper lunatic fund, under the management of the presbytery, 
for the benefit of such pauper lunatics — belonging to congregations 
which contribute, whether dissenting or other — as require to be sent 
to an asylum, but whose friends have neither the means of send- 
ing them thither, nor of keeping them at home. The average 
annual collections for each of the latter two objects is about L. 2, 
and these will require to be continued. But the contribu- 
tions of the association for religious purposes, as above explained, 
will admit of all the other collections made in church being wholly 
applied for the maintenance of the poor in the parish. The ave- 
rage annual amount of collections for this purpose is about L. 20. 
There is also the sum of L. 10, 12s. 2d., interest of money left at 
various times, and by various individuals, for the poor. The whole 
annual amount of contributions for religious and charitable objects 
has been, on an average of seven years, about L. 28. 

Education. — There are only two schools in the parish which have 
any endowment — the one, the parochial, — the other, a dame 
school, taught by two respectable females, sisters, who enjoy, 
through the kindness of the proprietor, the accommodations of a 
house and garden, and 3 bolls ] firlot of meal annually. In this 
latter school, little boys as well as girls are taught to read, and 
the latter also to knit and sew. The average number attending 
is about 28. The fees are, for reading alone, 2s. per quarter, for 
reading, sewing, and knitting, 2s. 6d. The parochial schoolmas- 
ter's salary is L. 32. The accommodations are very liberal and 
excellent. The branches taught are, reading, writing, English 
grammar, arithmetic, and Latin when required. The average 
number of scholars attending is 40. The expense of education 
is from 10s. to L. 1 per annum, the latter sum only when Latin 
along with the other branches is taught. The fees received by 
the teacher may amount to L. 15 or L. 16 per annum. He has 
also an allowance from the Dick Bequest, which has been hitherto 
rather more than L. 25 per annum. There are besides, seve- 
ral Sabbath schools taught in the parish, the number attending 



76 



BANFFSHIRE. 



which may vary from 50 to 90 or 100. In the cold and short days, 
It does not even amount to the smaller number. These schools 
are uniformly taught gratis, and it is only religious instruction which 
IS communicated. There are none in the parish between the age 
of six and fifteen who cannot read, or are not learning to do so. 
There, are, however, about 226 above the age of six unable to write, 
and 126 of these are below the age of twenty. The people are 
in general alive to the benefits of education, and there is no part 
of the parish so distant from the above schools, as to prevent at- 
tendance. Since the institution of Sabbath schools, that hallow- 
ed day, as was to be expected, has been more reverently observed 
and very considerable improvement has been made by the youth 
in religious knowledge, and it is hoped also in religious principle 
and practice. 

Librari/.— There is no other public library than the Sabbath 
school one ; but it is of great use to parents, and the other friends 
and connexions of the young who attend school. The Scottish 
Christian Herald, which has lately been begun to be published, 
enjoys also a pretty large circulation in the parish, and is likely, 
by the blessing of God, to be of much use. 

Charitable and other InstitvMons. — There is no hospital in the 
parish. But the people, as already stated, in consequence of their 
annual collection for the Aberdeen Infirmary, are entitled to ad- 
mission there, when any case occurs which requires it — which is 
indeed very seldom, as the practitioners in the country are in ge- 
neral well educated and expert. There is likewise, as has been 
stated, an annual collection for a pauper lunatic fund, the object 
of which is, to provide the means of admission to the poor who 
labour under that most dreadful malady, into the lunatic asvlum 
at Aberdeen, or to procure for them such other aid as their la- 
mentable case requires. 

There is no savings bank in the parish. But there is one in the 
adjoining parish of Cullen, the accommodation of which is open to 
the people of Deskford, and to all the surrounding neighbourhood. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is 37, and the average sum allotted to each 
annually is under 16s., some receiving considerably more than 

 It may be observed, that, besides the above schools, there are in the remoter parts 
of the parish, little schools taught by aged women, partly out of love to the occupation, 
and partly to eke out a slender maintenance, where small children in the immediate 
neighbourhood, to the number of from 6 to 10 attend, and learn to read the Shorter 
Catechism, the Proverbs, and New Testament. 

3

that sum, and others less, according to circumstances. The regu- 
lar distributions are made half yearly, but intermediate disburse- 
ments are occasionally made, as cases of necessity occur. The 
annual amount of church collections for the poor of the parish, as 
already stated, is about L. 20. There is likewise, as already stat- 
ed, interest of money for their behoof, amounting to L. 10, 12s. 2d. 
In cases of extreme emergency, contributions are occasionally 
made, particularly in winter and about Christmas, by humane in- 
dividuals going about from house to house, and collecting, in meal 
or money, whatever each person is disposed to give. There is but 
one travelling beggar now belonging to the parish, and she a very 
lame person, who can visit only her friends in her immediate 
neighbourhood. There are, however, too many beggars from 
other parts, whom it is very desirable to discourage ; so that they 
may remain where they are best known, and are least likely to 
thrive by imposture or idleness. The only way of effecting this is, 
by withholding alms from those from other quarters ; but this plan 
it is not easy to persuade the people with sufficient energy to adopt. 
There is rather an unwillingness to receive parochial aid, except 
in cases of necessity, but these are, alas  too numerous. There 
are six bolls of meal annually given from Cullen House, to be dis- 
tributed by the kirk-session anjong the most necessitous. There 
are likewise several poor and aged individuals, who receive from 
the same quarter a regular allowance, some of them at the rate of 
half a peck of meal per week, and some more, as the Noble proprie- 
tor, upon ascertaining the cases, is pleased to direct. 

Alehouses. — There are no prisons nor fairs in the parish; audit 
is very desirable that it could be added there is no alehouse ; but, 
though the number of alehouses be reduced, there is still one, 
which is quite unnecessary, and affords facilities and temptations 
to intemperance. It is much to be regretted that the magistrates 
or justices are not more alive to the baneful effects of licensing these 
where there is no occasion for them, and that certificates from mi- 
nisters and kirk-sessions are not more invariably required before 
granting such licenses. 

Fuel — The fuel chiefly used is peat and turf. The expense of 
this is not great, as it is prepared and taken home by the tenants, 
when their agricultural operations are slackest, between their tur- 
nip husbandry and harvest. They even burn their limestone with 
peat, and a mixture of coal, which they obtain at Cullen, at Is. Id. 
or Is. 2d. per imperial barrel.

Miscellaneous Observations. 

The improvements which have taken place in the agnculture 
of the parish, from draining, and the application of lime, fish, and 
bone manure, have been already mentioned. The great advantages 
likely to result from the new turnpike road have been also stated. 
There has likewise, within these two years, been a large extent of 
hilly and moorish ground lying towards Fordyce enclosed for plant- 
ing. It is called the Cotton Hill, and contains about 250 impe- 
rial acres, of which 190 are already planted. When the whole 
shall be completed, which is likely to take place in another year, 
it will extend the plantations in the parish to 850 acres. The 
drains which have been made for drying this piece of ground ex- 
tend to upwards of 19 miles, and the dikes and ditches enclosing 
it to above 6 miles. 

But the principal improvement, it is believed, is of a moral na- 
ture. Notwithstanding the still too great facilities for inebriety, 
it is much less common than when those facilities were more nu- 
merous. The Sabbath is more reverently and profitably spent ; 
and the introduction of Sabbath schools and Sabbath school 
books has led to passing the other evenings of the week in a more im- 
proving manner, than they were wont to be spent some twenty years 
ago, and even much later. Then, in winter, when the ordinary 
labours were over, and the out-door pastimes could not be en- 
joyed, cards were the common resource both for masters and ser- 
vants, whether in the parlour or in the kitchen. Now, such a 
thing is scarcely ever seen or thought of. But the present more 
profitable way of employing their leisure hours, and the superior 
moral and religious training now enjoyed, generally throughout 
the country, are likely to be exhibited more fully in their effects, 
when the rising generation shall be grown up, and shall have en- 
tered into the important relation of parents and heads of families.

PRESBYTERY OF FORDYCE, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. LUDOVIC W. GRANT, MINISTER  



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Boundaries, Sc. — This parish derives its name from Gaelic 
words, signifying the hollow beside the height It is situate be- 
tween 6 and 7 miles from the sea. It is of an oblong form, and 
is 3 miles in length, by 2 in breadth, undulated with rising 
ground. It is bounded on the north and west by the parish of 
Fordyce; by Grange on the south-west ; by Marnoch on the south 
and east ; and by Boindie on the north and east. It is terminated 
on the south-west by the Knock Hill, nearly 1640 feet in height. 

Topographical Appearances.— The appearance of the parish is 
bleak from the want of wood,— but in a few years will be much 
improved by the thriving plantations which have been lately made. 

Geologg.— As has been stated, the parish is in general flat, par- 
ticularly towards the northern part, and affords but few geologi- 
cal features worthy of notice,— the strata being in general deep- 
ly covered with beds of coarse clay, grit and iron shingle, so that 
the rocks are but sparingly laid bare, even by the burns and 
streams passing along the hollows ; and no quarries have ever been 
wrought within the parish, to open up the strata to public view.— 
We may state, however, that the greater part, if not the whole, of 
the parish appears to rest on a thick bed of coarse mica-slate pass- 
mginto gneiss, which again rests on granite,— the latter, in a dis- 
mtegrated state cropping out on the south-eastern point of the pa- 
rish, near the place called the Brown Hill Park. 

The direction of the strata within the parish is generally from 
the north-east to the south-west, and the dip is north-east and 
south-west, standing at various angles of elevation. At some points, 
It appears almost horizontal, and at others standing at almost right 
angles to the horizon. The eastern side of the parish is covered 
by a thick bed of moss, resting on a bed of coarse clay, intermix-. 

Drawn up by the former incumbent, the Rev. John Innes.

ed with scales of mica-slate, water-worn boulders, and fragments 
of various other disintegrated rocks, nowhere to be found in situ 
in that neighbourhood, — among which there was laid bare a few 
years ago, by some workmen belonging to Colonel Gordon of Park, 
in casting a ditch through a part of the moss, partially laid bare 
by casting peat, turf, &amp;c. a large block of sandstone, reckoned of 
several tons weight, and which must have been transported thither a 
considerable distance. That boulder, although partially imbedded 
in the clay, was surrounded towards its surface entirely by rposs ; 
before the removal of which it must at one time have been deeply 
imbedded; and it may be remarked that there is no sandstone in 
situ nearer that spot than Quarrywood in Elginshire, a distance of 
more than thirty miles. A few mile to the westward, however, in 
the neighbouring parish of Deskford, rolled blocks of sandstone, of 
the same colour and texture, were at a former period rather nume- 
rous on the surface, so much so, that the architect, when erecting 
the manse a few years ago, found abundance of them for supplying 
him with materials for erecting the chimney-tops, for window 
rybats, soles, lintels, &amp;c. 

Rolled blocks of whin and trap rocks are common throughout the 
parish, with occasional blocks of granite, containing beautiful crys- 
tals of schorl, also boulders of gneiss intermixed with mica-slate, 
the prevailing rock of that district. Rude garnets and tourma- 
line are also common, imbedded within the whin blocks and mica- 
slate, some of them very large. 

On the western side of the parish, the direction of the strata can 
be more distinctly traced, as they do not dip so far under the sur- 
face. In particular, the serpentine rock at Portsoy, so often no- 
ticed by geologists, can be distinctly traced from that place in a 
south-westerly direction, across the eastern base of the Knockhill, 
where and along the whole line blocks or outlayers of that mine- 
ral can readily be picked up, and of which I have seen various spe- 
cimens beautifully polished, and specimens of asbestos and rock- 
cork, both common in that mineral. Near the same spot, a few 
years ago, a large block of plumbago was discovered, along with 
several smaller pieces, on the outside regularly crystallized and 
very pure, — although soft specimens of plumbago have, also, been 
discovered on the same line, in the neighbouring parish of Grange. 

The top of the Knockhill, like many other of the. adjacent moun- 
tains, is covered with a bed of moss, which appears distinctly stra- 
tified, and which in many places appears to be from 15 to 20 feet 



ORDIQUIIILL. 81 

deep, and which at different points descends along the dechvity of 
the mountain, connecting itself with the mosses surroundino- its 
base. 

II. — Civil History. 

There is a charter granted by Alexander II. in 1242, describ- 
ing the boundaries of the estate of Park, in the possession of Lieu- 
tenant-Colonel Gordon, who is sole proprietor of the parish. A 
plan of the whole parish was made in 1782 for the use of the pro- 
prietor. 

Parochial Registers.— The parochial registers commence in 
1704; and have been kept regularly from that date. 

Eminent Men.— The only person of eminence as a literary cha- 
racter which this parish has produced, is Mr Walter Goodall, au- 
thor of a Defence of Queen Mary. 

Buildings.— k neat commodious church was built in IR05, ca- 
pable of holding between 400 and 500 persons ; the manse in 
1796; and considerable additions were made in 1829 to the man- 
sion-house of Park, which is a large handsome-looking building. 

III. — Population. 

The population in 1805 was 510 
1811 521 
1821 506 
1831 651 

The cause of the increase has been the improvement of waste 
lands. There is but one village,— where there is a population at 
present of 60; and in the country part there is a population of 
599. The average number of births for the last seven years is 15 • 
of marriages, 6. The number of persons under fifteen is 273 • bel 
twixt fifteen and thirty, 131 ; betwixt thirty and fifty, 148; betwixt 
fifty and seventy, 77 ; upwards of seventy, 22. The family of the 
proprietor resides in the parish. The unmarried women upwards 
of fifty are 3; and there are 1 widower and 4 unmarried women 
upwards of forty-five.

IV. — Industry. 
Agrxculture.-Thexe are 2500 acres cultivated or occasionally in 

tillage, and 2600 which have never been in cultivation, 500 of which 
might with profit be added to the improved land of the parish 
1 here are 400 acres under wood,— planted with larch, Scotch firs 
ash, beech, elm, and birch.— The land lets from 15s. to L. 1, 15/ 
bInff ""  nineteen years. The proprietor

gives great encouragement to improving and industrious tenants. 
A labourer earns in winter, with victuals, Is. ; in summer, Is. 6d. 
without victuals. Mason-work per rood, L. 1, 4s. to L. 1, 10s. 
Carpenter per day, 2s. in summer, and Is. 6d. in winter. The 
common breeds of cattle are black. The Highland Society and 
the Banffshire Farmer Club have awarded premiums ; and cattle- 
shows have been held for several years past in the village. 

The husbandry pursued generally consists in breeding cattle and 
raising oats. Several hundred acres have been reclaimed by drain- 
ing, within these few years. The farm-buildings are generally good ; 
but there are few enclosures. The principal improvements which 
have recently been made are, drainage on a large scale by the pro- 
prietor and by the tenantry,— the proprietor generally paying half 
the expense. The obstacles to improvement are the want of ca- 
pital, and the estate held under entail The value of potatoes per 
acre may be stated at L. 7 ; turnips, L. 5. The price of hay per 
acre varies, but may be reckoned at L. 3.

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Means of Communication —ear the village of Corncairn, which 
is a burgh of barony, there are six markets held in the year, usual- 
ly called Cornhill markets. The parish is intersected by turnpike 
roads, in several directions, to the extent of eight miles,— on which 
there are four bridges in good condition. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church is at the extremity of 
the parish, was built in 1805, is in good repair, and may contain 
between 400 and 500 sitters. No seat rents. The extent of 
glebe is between 7 and 8 acres, valuing at L. 1 per acre. The 
amount of stipend variable, but averaging L. 160. No chapels of 
ease, or Government churches, or dissenting chapels in the parish. 
The number attending the Established Church is 660. There is 
one family of Episcopalians, containing 5 individuals ; one family 
of Roman- Catholics, consisting of 6 ; one family of Seceders of 
6 ; and two of Independents, amounting to 6 ; in all, 23: Divine 
worship is well attended. The average number of communicants, 
300. The collections on Sabbath for behoof of the poor average 
10s. 6d.

There is a parochial association for promoting rehgious objects 
at home and abroad. 

Education. — There are two schools in the parish ; one paro- 
chial school, where Greek, Latin, mathematics, arithmetic, read- 
ing, and writing are taught ; and a dame school, where sewing and 
knitting, reading and writing, are taught. The salary of the school- 
master may average about L. 30 j fees in the year about L. 10. 
There are no persons betwixt six and fifteen who cannot read ; or 
upwards of fifteen who cannot read or write. 

Libraries.— A parochial library was established some years ago, 
which has diffused a taste for reading among the people, and been 
productive of much good : there is also a Sabbath school library. 

P oor and Parochial Funds, -c— The number of persons receiving 
parochial aid is 11 ; and the average sum allotted to each per year 
IS L. 1, 4s. The annual amount of contributions by collection at 
church for the poor, L. 27 ; for religious and charitable purposes, 
L. 5. The annual amount of fines for immorality, for behoof of 
the poor, is L. 2, 10s. The aversion among the poor to apply for 
parochial aid has diminished of late, owing, perhaps, to the pres- 
sure of the times. 

No prisons or jails in the parish, and but one inn.

PRESBYTERY OF TURRIFF, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. JOSEPH THORBURN, MINISTER. 



Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Boundaries, -c— This parish is sometimes called Teu- 
nan or St Eunon, from a saint of that name to whom a chapel 
the ruins of which still remain, is said to have been dedicated 
lorglen and the neighbouring parish of Alvah were at one time 
joined; but, before the middle of the seventeenth century, Forglen 
was erected into a separate parish, and an annexation from the 
adjoining parish of Marnoch was made to it both quoad sacra et 
civiha. In Blaeu's map of Scotland published in 1662, and com- 
piled before the disjunction of Forglen from Alvah, « St Eunan's 
Kirk is one of the places marked. 



84 



BANFFSHIRE. 



The boundaries of this parish are, on the south and east, the 
river Deveron ; on the west the parish of Marnoch ; on the north 
the parish of Alvah. Its length from south-east to north-west is 
about 5i miles, its greatest breadth is 4 miles ; it contams about 
12 square miles. A rivulet nearly bisects the parish, at the mouth 
of which are the ruins of the chapel before-mentioned. 

Climate, Springs, -c— The climate is warm, compared with that 
of the surrounding country,— owing to the nature of the soil, and 
the shelter of hills and woods. Streams flowing from the northern 
and high grounds, and pouring their waters into the Deveron, act 
as drains, and tend to render the soil dry. The people are in ge- 
neral healthy, and many live to a great age ; most are cut off by 
acute diseases, or die of old age. Chronic rheumatism is common. 
There are several perennial chalybeate springs on the bank of the 
Deveron, and on the higher grounds, where roots of oak are to be 
seen. The only river is the Deveron, which has its source in the 
mountains of Aberdeenshire. When it first enters the parish, it 
flows almost due east, it then takes a sudden turn towards the 
north, and continues to flow in that direction till it discharges it- 
self into the Moray Frith at Banff. 

Geology/.— Theve is a chain of greywacke which passes through 
the upper district of the parish, about north and south, from a 
place called Craigaithry, in the upper part of the estate of For- 
glen, towards Auldtown of Carnousie. There is another small 
hill of the same rock in the middle of the parish. Indeed the 
western boundary of the parish may be said to be formed of a ridge 
of greywacke ; the slight elevations towards the north are of the 
same rock; where the ground gradually shelves towards the river 
on the south and east sides, the clay-slate is to be found. In the 
low grounds, the clay-slate extensively prevails ; direction, south- 
east ; dip 70°. The fissures of the greywacke are, for the most 
part, filled up with quartz. Quartz and hyperstone are to be met 
with, but not in large masses. A thick species of clay-slate is to 
be found along the bed both of the river and rivulet, reaching 
near the meridian of the greywacke. The greywacke is covered 
by a thin layer of heath, the clay-slate by a light soil, composed 
chiefly of comminuted slate, mixed with vegetable mould. The 
soil is generally light, sandy on the river side— clayey in some 
places — seldom loamy.

The forests and plantations are chiefly composed of the Scotch

mate ; but oak, beech, plane, elm, Spanish chestnut, horse chest- 
nut, and ash, are here and there interspersed. 

II. — Civil History. 

Land-oioners. — There are only three heritors in the parish : 
Lady Abercromby, who possesses the patronage of the church ; 
Alexander Grant, Esq. of Carnousie; and Alexander Morrison, 
Esq. of Mountblairy. 

Ancient Charters. — There are several very ancient charters in 
the hands of the Forglen family, connected with the transference 
of property to and from the family of the Ogylvies of Banff, of 
which the present Lady Abercromby is a descendant. From these, 
it appears that the lands of Forglen at one time belonged to the 
abbey of Aberbrothick, as well as the patronage of the church. The 
writer of this article has inspected a deed conveying the lands of 
Forglen, and power of presenting to the living, from Irvine of Drum 
to the Abbey, and another re-conveying them to the family of Irvine. 
These deeds are dated as far back as the beginning of the fif- 
teenth century. 

Parish Records. — The records of church discipline begin in 
1659, and have been regularly kept till the present time, with the 
exception of five years after 1754. The register of baptisms and 
marriages is very imperfect. In these registers we find some 
notices which are worth recording, as exhibiting some interesting 
differences between the former and present age. It was usual at 
one time, before the celebration of the Lord's supper, for the mi- 
nister to inquire of his session if there was any variance existing 
in the parish, and if there was, they took steps to have it suppres- 
sed. On one occasion it is stated, " that there was variance be- 
twixt neighbours" in a certain district of the parish, whereupon the 
minister promised to travel that week among them and see what 
could be done. 

It was enacted by the Assembly 1641, that every presbytery 
consisting of twelve members should maintain a bursar of Divinity, 
and where the number was fewer than twelve it was to be joined 



FORGLEN. 



87 



with another presbytery which could count more members than the 
above-mentioned number. This injunction was comphed with in 
this parish till 1801, when the practice ceased. The sum contri- 
buted was 5s. yearly. 

Public appearances before the congregation in cases of disci- 
pline seem to have been given up about the year 1775. The fol- 
lowing persons are known to have been ministers here : 1. Alex- 
ander Scroggie, 1642; 2. Robert Brown, 1659; 3. William 
Blair, 1667; 4. John Dunbar, 1676; 5. James Bannerman, 1717, 
translated from Inveraven; 6. David Bannerman, 1741, translated 
to St Martins; 7. James Milne, 1759, translated to Ellon ; 8. Ro- 
bert Ballingal, 1775; 9. Laurence Moyes, 1796; 10. Present 
incumbent, 1831, translated from Aberdeen. 

Antiquities.— There are the remains of a rehgious house where 
the rivulet falls into the Deveron ; but nothing more is known con- 
cerning it than what has been already mentioned,— that tradition 
assigns it to St Eunon.— There are two barrows unopened, about 
600 yards from the church.— In making a road in 1827, an urn 
was dug up containing a quantity of ashes. Another urn with 
smnlar contents was found in the hill of greywacke before men- 
tioned, about twenty years ago.— A silver coin of the size of a crown 
piece, of the date of 1670, was lately found in the wall of an old 
house. It seems from the inscription to have been current in the 
Electorate and Archiepiscopate of Cologn.— Over the entry to 
the house of Forglen are placed the arms of Scotland. Below 
these, are the arms of the owner of the house at the time that part 
of it was erected,— which, we learn from one of the stones, was the 
year 1577. Above the royal arms, we find written, hoip of re- 
VAiRD CAVSES GviD SERVICE; and Under the arms of the family is 
the following inscription :

Buildings. — The houses of Forglen and Caniousie are ancient; 
the oldest part of the former being built about 1440, as appears 
from the arms and cypher on an old stone. The church, the pa- 
rochial and female school-houses are modern buildings. There 
are two mills in the parish, originally erected for the accommoda- 
tion of the tenants of Forglen and Carnousie. The materials em- 
ployed for building are the stones already mentioned as common. 
Sometimes, however, granite and red sandstone are used, which 
are brought from the neighbouring parishes : 

III. — Population. 

In 1 755, the population was, according to Dr Webster's tables, 607

During the last three years, there were 12 illegitmate births in the 
parish, — 3 of which were followed by the marriage of the parents. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Economy. — There are in the parish.

Most of the Scotch firs, which form a considerable proportion 
of those plantations, have been planted. Besides these, we have 
the spruce fir, the larch, the ash, and the oak, all of which thrive 
well, and some in a superior degree. The elm, the plane, the 
beech, the horse-chestnut, and the lime, are found in the policies 
of Forglen House. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of land per acre is 18s. A 
year's grazing for a cow or ox costs L. 5, for a sheep, L. 1. 



FORGLEN. 



89 



Rate of Wages. — Wrights receive about Us. and masons 12s. 
per week ; tailors 2s. per day. A ploughman's wages for a year are 
L. 11; a woman's wages L. 5. In 1795, according to the former 
Statistical Account, the fee of a farm-servant was from L. 7 to L. 8 ; 
women received about L. 2, 10s. Wooden ploughs cost L. 3, and 
iron ploughs L. 3, 10s.; carts, L. 10; harrows, 8s. 

Live-stock. — The Aberdeenshire and Buchan are the common 
kinds of cattle reared in the parish, and great attention has been 
paid to the improvement of the stock, by the introduction of the 
Teeswater, the Dunrobin, and the Galloway breeds. The common 
breed of sheep is the Highland, which has been improved by the 
introduction of the Merino, the Cheviot, and the Leicester. A 
valuable sort is obtained by a cross of the Leicester and the Che- 
viot. 

Husbandry. — The land generally passes through seven a years' 
rotation, in the following order : 1. turnips ; 2. oats or barley, with 
grass sown; 3, grass cut for hay; 4. grass; 5. grass ; 6. oats ; 7. oats. 
Very little wheat is raised in the parish. This grain has been culti- 
vated for so short a time, that a statement cannot be warranted as to 
whether it will be a profitable crop. The latest improvements in 
agriculture have been introduced. About one-third of the arable 
land has been reclaimed from waste within the last fifty years, 
and one-fourth of what is improved is drained. Leases are usual- 
ly granted for nineteen years. The farm-buildings are inferior to 
those in the south of Scotland. The work of inclosing is making 
great progress. Hedges as inclosures are almost unknown. The 
dry stone dike is chiefly used for that purpose. The chief obsta- 
cle to improvement is want of capital. There are several quarries 
of clay-slate in the parish. 

Fishery.— ki one time, the salmon-fishing in the Deveron was 
of considerable value ; but now, owing, as it is supposed, to obstruc- 
tions in the mouth of the river, it is much fallen off, so that the 
rent for three miles is only L. 5 per annum. The whole extent 
of the river in the parish is generally let to two individuals. 
V. — Parochial Economy. 
Banff, at the distance of seven miles from the northern extremity 
of the parish, is the nearest market-town. The post-town is Tur- 
riff, about a mile distant from the south-eastern boundary. There 
IS no village in the parish. The extent of turnpike road may be 
about seven miles. Three carriers pass through, weekly, to Aber- 
deen. The bridges over the rivulet are in good order. That over

BANFFSHIRE. 



the Deveron, connecting this parish with Turriff, built in 1826 of 
red sandstone, is of great utihty, and cost L. 2503. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church, which was built in 1806, and 
is in excellent order, is situated on the south-eastern boundary of 
the parish, — a very inconvenient position for the people, some of 
whom are between four and five miles from it. There is a morti- 
fication in favour of the minister, of 200 merks, which lies in his 
hand free of interest, and is transferred to his successor. This 
was left by the tutor of Cromarty, in testimony, it is said, of the 
minister's hospitality, which he had on a particular occasion enjoy- 
ed. The church accommodates between 400 and 500 persons. 
There are no free sittings. The manse had a very considerable 
addition made to it in 1828. The glebe, the yearly value of which 
may be stated at L. 14, consists of about 4 acres arable land, and 
between 4 and 5 acres of den fit for pasture. The teinds of the 
parish are exhausted. The stipend is paid partly in money and 
partly in meal. The money stipend is L. 134, 6s. 2d ; the meal 
stipend 58 bolls, 3 firlots, 2 lippies, which is paid according to the 
fiars price, by an arrangement between the minister and heritors. 
The whole stipend for the year 1835 was L. 172, 15s. 6d. In favour- 
able weather, the church does no more than accommodate the re- 
gular hearers. There are 4 Episcopalians who worship at Turriff, 
where there is a minister of that persuasion ; and 2 Roman Catho- 
lics. All the rest of the mhabitants attend the parish church. The 
number of communicants is about 350. There are two extra- 
ordinary collections in the parish yearly, — one for the Aberdeen 
Infirmary, the other for the Assembly's India Mission and the 
Schools in the Highlands and Islands. On each occasion, the 
contribution averages somewhat above L. 5. The average amount 
of collections for the poor is L. 56, a considerable part of which is 
supplied by the family of Forglen, who are resident. Neither of 
the other heritors is resident. The session is composed of five 
members. 

Education. — There are two schools in the parish, — the parochial, 
and the female school for sewing, which is unendowed, except that the 
school-house was erected by the subscriptions of the heritors and pa- 
rishioners. Besides these, there are one or two schools taught by fe- 
males, where the instruction is of a very elementary kind. At the 
parish school the branches are, English reading, geography, mathe- 
matics, Latin, writing, book-keeping, and occasionally Greek and

French. The salary of the schoolmaster is L. 34, 4s. 4d. His 
fees average L. 30 yearly. 

Mortified money in favour of the schoolmaster. — Mr George 
Bruce, minister of Dunbar, left, in 1793, L. 100 Sterling, the inte- 
rest of which goes to the schoolmaster, — of whom it is required, as 
a condition of receiving this money, that he shall read a portion of 
Scripture every Sabbath, between the second and third bells. A 
copy of the deed of mortification is inserted in the records of the 
presbytery of Turriff. The interest of L. 20 has been left for edu- 
cating poor children, by Mr George Gerrard. The schoolmaster 
has also the benefit of the Dick bequest, which may probably yield 
L. 30 per annum. 

Most of the inhabitants of the parish can write as well as read, 
and, as far as is known, there are only three persons belonging to 
the same family who cannot read. The people seem to set a high 
value on education. The school-house is centrical, in excellent 
order, having been recently erected ; and no part of the parish is so 
distant as to prevent the attendance even of young children. When 
the school is fullest, the numbers are somewhat above 100. The 
average may be stated between 80 and 90. Some attend from 
other parishes. There are between 30 and 40 attending the other 
schools, fn the return made to Government in 1 834, it is stated 
that the greatest number which attended the parish school from 
Ladyday to Michaelmas 1833 was 108; the other schools 40; total 
148. Perhaps 8 of these may be from the neighbouring parishes. 
Suppose then 140 at school, as the population amounts to 820, 
there is thus about one-sixth receiving instruction. It is only jus- 
tice to state, that the parish school is most effectively taught, and 
that the most recent improvements in education have been introdu- 
ced with great success by the present schoolmaster, Mr Webster. 

Sabbath Schools. — On the morning of the Sabbath, before public 
worship, there is a Bible class for young persons of both sexes, above 
the age of fourteen, who have attended with much regularity for the 
last four years, which is the length of time it has existed. Between 
30 and 40 take advantage of this means of instruction. The suc- 
cess which has attended this class has been very considerable. After 
the dismissal of the congregation, the children meet in the Sabbath 
school. The greatest number which has attended this school is 78, 
of whomgirls form the larger proportion. It is taught by well instruct- 
ed persons belonging to the parish, superintended by the minister

in the parish, and without any drawback, so far as has yet been ex- 
perienced. It has studded the church with young faces, which, be- 
fore it was erected, were very rare. It has rendered many of the 
children famihar with the Scriptures, and, it is hoped, will ultimate- 
ly, in a similar manner, affect the whole youthful population. It has 
brought the minister acquainted with the names, faces, and dispo- 
sitions of this important portion of his parishioners, and affords him 
every Sabbath an opportunity of conversing with them in a familiar 
way, of taking advantage of every local dispensation and occurrence, 
and speaking home to their consciences, while it also does good to 
parents, partly by the good feeling which it excites in them towards 
the instructor of their children, and reflexly, by stirring them up to 
the study of the Scriptures, and to a more tender walk and con- 
versation on account of the improved knowledge and growing ac-. 
quaintance with Christian character on the part of the children. 
The Sabbath school is at present taught in the church ; but as this 
has been found inconvenient, the parishioners are now engaged in 
erecting a building near the church for Sabbath instruction. 

Poor, — The following statement is to be found in the session- 
book about the middle of the last century : Income — The session had 
at interest L. 786, 13s. 4d. Scots, about L.65 Sterling; the in- 
come from collections, &amp;c. L. 50 Scots, about L.4 Sterling; income 
from interest on capital, L.39, 6s. 8d. Scots; collections, &amp;c. L. 50 ; 
total L. 89, 6s. 8d., about L. 7 Sterling. — Expenditure : — 4 paupers 
that can do nothing, L. 104 Scots; 9 paupers that can do a little, 
L. 140, 8s.; total L. 244, 8s., about L. 20 Sterling. To meet this 
they had one-half of collections and interest of capital, L. 3, 10s. 
Sterling; from the heritors, L. 16, 10s.; total L.20. The other half 
of collections was used for occasional and accidental cases of charity. 
By some notices in the parish records, it appears that it was not 
unusual in early times to give the Sabbath collections to travelling 
mendicants. In 1723, the poor funds were distributed twice in the 
year, and at that time the number of poor receiving regular assist- 
ance was 7. In 1755, the number of the poor had increased to 
11. At both of these periods, the population seems to have been 
about 600. The daily collection averaged between 15s. and 16s. 
Scots money, and the annual allowance to each pauper was from 
L. 17 to L. 18 Scots. 

As the subject of pauperism is intimately connected with morals, 
and every fact which tends to illustrate the system pursued in Scot- 
land is of value, the following tables are subjoined :

If 



In this table it will be observed, that, while the number of poor 
remains nearly the same, the allowance varies,— a circumstance 
which is to be accounted for, by the difference in the price of pro- 
visions, the severity of the season, and the occasional opening up 
of unexpected resources. The large sum spent in 1832 wasow- 
ing to the prevalence of cholera in the country, when, to prevent 
the parish being visited by it, so far as human means could effect 
this, the session made large distributions of clothing. There was 
not a case of that virulent disease in the parish.

that when they have become incapable of hard labour, they are 
altogether thrown upon the kindness of friends and the funds of 
the parish. 

From various circumstances, there is no one who is able and 
willing to work, who does not find employment. The average sum 
received by each pauper, yearly, is L. 2, 18s. The amount of 
contributions for the relief of the poor in 1831 was, from collections 
at the church, L. 64, 6s. 8d. ; from legacies, L. 12, 7s. lOd. ; from 
interest of L. 75 mortified money, L. 3, 15s. ; total, L. 80, 9s. 6d. 

Library. — There is a parish library, well selected, composed of 
works on religious and general subjects ; and it is gratifying to be 
able to state, that, of late, increased anxiety has been shewn to take 
advantage of it. 

Savings Bank. — A savings bank was established in 1816. Tak- 
ing a year at random, there was deposited the sum of L. 195, 
19s. 4d. ; there was withdrawn, the same year, the sum of L. 158, 
8s. 6d. Investments were for the most part made by servants. 
Transactions were, for several years, suspended on account of the 
failure of the chief depository. This was the case when the wri- 
ter of this account entered on the charge of the parish in the year 
1831. Although desirous of commencing a new bank, he found 
the confidence in these institutions so shaken by what had befallen 
the former, that he saw it was in vain to attempt it, at least for 
some time. However, having taken frequent opportunities of ex- 
plaining their importance, and shown that the late mishap was al- 
together apart from the principles of the bank, and entirely acci- 
dental, he ventured to offer to receive deposits in the summer of 
1834; and with such success was the proposal attended, that in 
the course of four months there was deposited above L. 100. The 
sum in the savings bank at present 1836 is within a few pounds 
of L. 300. There is this difference between the present and for- 
mer savings bank, that no contributions are now received beyond 
L. 40, nor from any persons not resident in the parish, — neither of 
which restrictions existed under the former regulations. 

jfins, — There is no inn or alehouse in the parish ; for resisting 
the introduction of which, the district is much indebted to the late 
Sir George Abercromby, and his son, the present Sir Robert. 

Puel. Peat and wood are the chief materials used for fuel. The 

peat is obtained from the Carnousie property ; the wood from Car- 
nousie and Forglen. Coals are brought from Banff at the rate of 
about lOd. the cwt. exclusive of carriage.

PRESBYTERY OF STRATHBOGIE, SYNOD OF MORAY. 

THE REV. JOHN ROBERTSON, MINISTER. 



''OPOGRAPHY AND NaTURAL HiSTORY. 

Extent, Boundaries, c— The parish of Gartly, though locally 
in Aberdeenshire, is nevertheless, legally, partly m that county and 
partly in the county of Banff. It is divided, nearly in the centre, 
by the water of Bogie, into what is called the Barony and the Braes. 
The Barony is in the county of Banff, and pays the land tax in that 
county,— the Braes are in the county of Aberdeen. This ano- 
maly is said to have arisen from the circumstance, that the pro- 
prietor of the Barony, Baron Barclay, one of the feudal barons 
of the ancient Earls of Huntly, being Sheriff of the county of Banff, 
used means to get his domains within his own jurisdiction. The 
parish is of an irregular oblong form, about 12 miles in length from 
east to west, and 4 miles in breadth in the middle, and may com- 
prise about 33 square miles. It is bounded on the east by the pa- 
rishes of Insch and Kinnethmont ; on the west by Cabrach and 
Huntly; on the south by Rhynie; and on the north bv Huntlvand 
Drumblade. " 

Topographical Jppearances.~The boundaries on the east and 
west sides are hilly and chiefly covered with heath, the moors on both 
sides are extensive, and abound with grouse, &amp;c. and have for some 
years past been let to gentlemen from the other side of the Tweed 
as shooting-grounds. From the mosses on these hills, not only the 
inhabitants of the parish, but also of the town of Huntly, are in a 
great measure supplied with fuel. The mosses on the east side of 
the parish are now almost exhausted ; but on the west side they are 
so deep and extensive as to be almost inexhaustible. From these 
hills many small brooks fall into the Bogie. The valleys supplied 
by these brooks are very fertile, as well as the lands on both sides of 

w th hif' 7i 1 '"'f ' " "'"" P"' beautifully diversified 
ith hd and dale. Some of the glens are exceedingly beautiful 
and picturesque. The glen of Ti lyminnet, in particular, Ich

BANFFSHIRE. 



appears among the surrounding hills like an oasis in the desert, 
has been frequently visited and admired by persons of taste from 
various parts of the kingdom. Near the manse, there is a very 
curious little hill called " the Riggin," from its resemblance to the 
ridge of a house. It is about 500 yards in length, and about 40 
feet in height. It has evidently been formed by the action of wa- 
ter, as it contains large masses of water sand, and an immense 
quantity of smooth and rounded stones. It is not unlikely that, 
in the course of ages, this singularly curious formation may have 
been raised by irruptions of the Bogie, in conjunction with torrents 
from the hills produced by sudden thaws after great falls of snow 
or long continued ftills of rain. The climate of the parish is rather 
cold, which may be accounted for partly from its high latitude, and 
partly from its particular situation among the hills, which are quite 
destitute of wood ; indeed, there is scarcely any wood in the parish 
except on the banks of the Bogie, which are covered with alder — 
a beautiful birch wood at the glen of Tillyminuet and three or four 
small young plantations. The numerous instances of longevity in 
the parish, however, afford ample evidence that the climate, though 
cold, is healthy. 

Springs, Sj-c. — The parish abounds with perennial springs of excel- 
lent soft water, and also with numerous very fine chalybeate springs. 
The Bogie takes its rise in Auchindoir, and after winding its course 
of about 14 miles, through the parishes of Rhynie and Gartly, 
unites with the Deveron a little below Huntly, and finds its way 
into the sea at Banff. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — In regard to minerals, this parish 
has little to boast, with the exception of slate. Granite, a little Hme~ 
stone and schistus, or clayslate, are here and there met with, suf- 
ficient for the purposes of building houses and stone fences; but the 
limestone is so small in quantity, and so deeply seated, that no quar- 
ries have been opened, as the farmers can obtain lime from the quar- 
ries of Ardonald in the neighbouring parish of Cairnie, at a cheap- 
er rate. Several of the hills, however, abound with excellent slate, 
and many quarries have been opened, which not only yield con- 
siderable rent to the proprietor, but afford employment to a num- 
ber of industrious labourers, who frequently obtain good wages from 
the tacksmen. The soils are various. In the Braes, and on the 
haughs along the Bogie, the soil is, in general, a sharp loam with a 
considerable portion of sand, and the subsoil either sand or clay. In 

3 



GARTLY. 97 

the Barony, it is light and sandy, and commonly rests upon a gravel- 
ly bottom or kind of hard till, which is very difficult to pierce. 

n.— Civil History. 
Many of the natives of this parish have risen to respectable rank 
in the military and medical departments, and many of them have 
done honour to the church established in our land. The late Dr 
Moodie of Edinburgh was born at Kirkstyle, during the time that 
a manse was building for his worthy father, then parish minister, 
whose memory is still held in veneration by some of the aged in- 
habitants—who speak of him as an able and faithful minister of 
the New Testament. 

Parochial Registers.— V'iYoc\\\a\ registers of births and mar- 
riages have been preserved from about the commencement of the 
last century, and kept with tolerable regularity up to the present time. 

Antiquities,— The principal antiquity in the parish is an old ruin 
called Castle of Gartly. In Chalmers's Life of Mary Queen of Scots, 
it is stated, that this beautiful but unfortunate princess, on her re- 
turn from an excursion to Inverness and Ross-shire, " repassed 
through the country of the Gordons, which had once been held 
out as s'o frightful. She remained a night at Gartly, where there 
IS still a ruined castle, and the parish whereof belongs even now 
to the Duke of Gordon."— The sites of four Roman Catholic cha- 
pels are stdl pomted out in the Braes, namely, at Heathery hillock 
Brawlinknows, Tillythrowie, and Kirkney ; and the vestiges of some 
of them and of the burial-grounds thereto attached are still visible. 
There were, of late years, a number of tumuh on a piece of ground 
called " the buried men's legs" on the farm of Mill-hill, near the 
church, where a skirmish was fought after the battle of Harlaw in 
the flight of a party of Highlanders in 1411. Several of the cairns 
were cleared away, about thirty-five years ago; and in one of them 
were found the remains of two dirks, the handles of which were 
pretty entire, but the blades m-ch decayed. In another, were found 
two large brass buckles about four inches broad, probably used in 
buckling their ckymores. There was also lately found, in a cairn on 
the farm of Faich-hill, an urn containing bones ; and a large one pet 
ty entire on the farm of Riskhouse. The present farmer of Cock- 
ston, within these last few years, found on his farm an earthen pot 
containing round pieces of stamped leather, which was supposed 
to have been used in ancient times as coin,-but in such a state of 
decay, that they mouldered away at the touch. A stone coffin was 
lately found by Captain Gordon of the Royal Artillery on his farm

of Cold ran. There is an eminence on a hill between Corncattarach 
and Malsach hill, called Yaiken or Oaken Bank, said to have been 
covered in ancient times with oak wood, and from which it is re- 
ported that the cupples of the old church were taken.— The re- 
mains of some oak trees are still to be seen in one of the mosses, 
and also of fir-trees of considerable size. — The ashes of the Vis- 
count of Aboyne and several of his followers, and of John Gor- 
don, laird of Rothiemay, who were burned in the old tower of the 
House of Frendraught, in the parish of Forgue, in 1630, as related 
by Spalding, were buried in a vault in the church of Gartly, which 
is still to be seen. There is a tradition, which appears to be well- 
founded, that that merry monarch, James I. of Scotland, who was 
in the habit of visiting different parts of the kingdom in disguise, 
in one of his rambles, spent a night at a place called " MuirelUs." 
The gudeman was so well pleased with the humour and jokes of the 
royal incog, that he ordered the gudeivife to kill " the hen nearest 
the cock" for a repast to his pleasant companion. The King, 
on the other hand, was so much pleased with the kindness and hos- 
pitality of his entertainer, that he obtained a grant from the Earl 
of Huntly, that he and his descendants should occupy the pos- 
session rent free, which it is said they did, for many generations. 
There is also a tradition that an infant son of the Baron of Gart- 
ly was drowned, on returning from being baptized at the chapel 
of Brawlinknows, when the water of Bogie was flooded after a great 
fall of rain ; and the place where it was said the infant was drown- 
ed, is still called " Lord John's Pot." 

III. — Population. 
The number of inhabitants in this parish, about fifty or sixty 
years ago, was much greater than it is at present. It was 

in 1755, - J328 

1783, - 2000 
1793, - - 1800 

At the census before last, it fell to 979. This decrease can only 
be imputed to the principal tenants extending their farms and re- 
moving their cottagers. It has, however, since that time increas- 
ed considerably, and is now 1136. This increase has chiefly arisen 
from the additional number of labourers lately employed at the slate 
quarries, many of whom are married and have families.

Agriculture. — The parish contains about 14,627 Scotch acres, of 
which 4325 are under cultivation, and 10,302 in pasture, wood, 
moor, and moss. Many of the moors are well calculated for grow- 
ing wood, and, were they planted, would tend not only to beautify 
the country, but also to afford shelter and improve the climate. 
The only undivided common in the parish is the Malshach hill and 
Its adjoining moors, which are common to all the tenants in the 
barony ; but few of them avail themselves of this privilege, as the 
pasture is rather poor. A considerable part of the moor, however, 
might be cultivated with advantage. The average rent of arable 
land is about L. 1 Sterling per Scotch acre. 

rra7e5.— Men-servants receive from L. 5, 5s. to L. 6, 6s. in the 
half-year; women for summer, from L. 2 to L. 3, and in winter 
from L. 1, 5s. to L. 1, 15s. ; herds from L. 1 to L. 2, all with victu- 
als. Country wrights, who go from house to house, receive from 
Is. 3d. to Is. 6d. a-day; masons are generally employed by the 
rood, and their charge is from L. 1 to I.. 1, I4s. per rood for plain 
ruble work : slaters charge from 12s. to 15s. per rood; blacksmiths, 
when they afford material, charge from 4d. to 8d. per lb. for made 
work, and Is. a -day with victuals. 

HusbandrT/.Since the introduction of turnip husbandry, cattle 
have been much improved, and more attention than formerly is 
now paid to the best breeds. The old Aberdeenshire breed cros- 
sed by the Argyleshire is undoubtedly best suited for the district. 
There are only a few farmers about the hill-sides who keep 
sheep; and it is not believed that there are above 1600 or 1800 
sheep in the parish, which are generally of the black-faced kind. 
The common duration of leases is nineteen years, which is consi- 
dered as sufficiently favourable to the occupier. Much improvement 
has been recently made upon many of the farm-steadings, and a 
considerable part of the waste land has been drained and improved. 
In the year 1828, George Gordon, Esq. in Bucharn, obtained the 
Highland Society's honorary gold medal, for 160 acres of land im- 
proved on that farm, during the seven preceding years. This gen-

tleman and a few others have also subdivided and enclosed their 
fields with very substantial stone dikes ; but in general very little 
has been done in the way of enclosing, though this is one of the 
greatest improvements for the country.

V. — Parochial Economy. 
There are neither villages nor market-towns in the parish. The 
nearest market-town is Huntly, which is about four miles from 
the parish church, but only about one mile from that part of the 
parish which is bounded by Huntly. The means of communica- 
tion enjoyed by the parish are tolerably good. Some of the by- 
roads, as it may be supposed, are very indifferent in winter or 
after much rain ; but as there are about four miles of turnpike 
on the line of road from Huntly to Rhynie and Kinnethmont, on 
which two public coaches travel daily, and about one mile and a- half 
through the Foudland hills, which on the one side joins the turnpike 
road from Huntly to Aberdeen, and on the other leads to the vil- 
lage of Insch in the Garioch, — the parish, upon the whole, enjoys 
considerable facilities in the way of communication with the prin- 
cipal market-towns to which the farmers have occasion to resort. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The kirk was built in the year 1621, but 
it has at different periods undergone so many repairs and changes 
that, with the exception of the steeple, there is perhaps very 
little of the old building now remaining. It was new seated, 
and otherwise substantially repaired, about twelve years ago. It 
is nearly centrical to the greater part of the population, though 
the extreme distance of a small part of it, on one side, is near- 
ly seven miles, and on the other about four. It affords accommoda- 
tion for about 550 persons, and the sittings are all free. A very sub- 
stantial and commodious new manse was built in the year 1821. 
The glebe, including the garden and sites of the manse and offi- 
ces, is about eleven Scotch acres, and may be estimated at about 
L. 16 a year. The stipend is fourteen chalders of victual, one-half 
in barley, and the other in meal, with L. 8, 6s. 8d. for affording 
communion elements. Number of families attending the Establish- 
ed Church about 160; persons of all ages, 500 ; number of Dissent- 



GARTLY. 



101 



ing families, 10; of persons, 34; Episcopalian, 1; Roman Catho- 
lic, 1 ; of families, in which persons attending the Established 
Church and dissenters are nearly equal, 9; average number of com- 
municants in the Established Church, 400. With the exception 
of prayer meetings, of which there are five or six in the parish, 
there are no societies for religious purposes established in the pa- 
rish, as it is near Huntly, where there are flourishing Bible and 
missionary societies, of which a considerable number of the people 
of this parish are members, and to which they contribute pretty 
liberally. The average amount of church collections for religious 
and charitable purposes, exclusive of the weekly Sabbath collec- 
tions for the poor, may be about L. 10 Sterling a year. 

Educat{on.~There is only one regular permanent school in the 
parish, namely, the parochial; but there are generally one or two 
schools taught by females for the benefit of young children, and 
the instruction of girls in sewing; and during the winter, one or two 
teachers are frequently engaged for instructing the children of such 
families as are at a distance from the parish school, in reading, 
writing, and arithmetic. These branches, together with Latin and 
the elements of mathematics, are taught at the parish school. The 
general annual expense of education is, for reading, 10s. ; reading 
and writing, 12s. ; arithmetic, I6s. ; Latin, L. 1 ; mathematics, &amp;c. 
L. 1 , I Os. The children between six and fifteen years of age are in 
general taught to read, and the greater part of them also to write. 
Children above ten years of age could generally attend school, with 
the exception of three families, whose distance from it is about seven 
miles; but an additional school for thee families and others who 
are more than four miles from school, would be of great conse- 
quence. The salary of the schoolmaster, including the statutory 
allowance for a garden, is about L. 32, 10s. and the amount of 
school fees, L. 1 5. 

Literature -There is a parochial library in the parish, consist- 
ing of upwards of 200 volumes on divinity, history, biography, voy- 
ages, travels, and on other subjects connected with aoriculture — 
which has, it IS hoped, been instrumental in increasing the intelli- 
gence and promoting the moral improvement of the people 

Poor and Parochial Funds.-The average number of persons re- 
ceiving parochial aid is 20, and the average sum allotted to each an- 
nually, nearly L. 2 Sterling. The annual amount of funds for their 



102 



BANFFSHIRE. 



relief is, from church collections, L.25; interest of funds, L. 12; pe- 
nalties from delinquents, L.3; total L. 40. Necessity alone compels 
the poor in general to apply for parochial relief, as such application is 
almost universally considered to be of a humiliating and degrading 
nature. 

Inns. There is only one inn in the parish, in a situation which 

renders it necessary for the accommodation of travellers ; and being 
kept by a person of very decent and respectable character, it is be- 
hoved that it has produced no bad effects on the morals of the 
people. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Since the last Statistical Account was drawn up, there has been a 
considerable improvement both in respect of the general intelligence 
and morality of the people, and the comforts of domestic life. While 
the price of labour and land rent is nearly double, the price of grain 
is nearly the same. The value of cattle is indeed greater, but does 
not afford a sufficient remuneration to the farmer. The system of 
husbandry the seven-shift course is perhaps, upon the whole, best 
adapted to the soil, climate, and local circumstances of the parish ; 
but if agriculture continues in its present depressed state, a reduc- 
tion of rent would appear to be absolutely necessary to stimulate and 
reward the industry, and promote the comfort and happiness of the 
tenantry ; and, as they hold their possessions from a family who 
have been long distinguished for a regard to their prosperity, there 
can be little doubt that, if a favourable change does not soon take 
place in the value of agricultural produce, this boon will not 
long be withheld.

<p>

PRESBYTERY OF STRATHBOGIE, AND SYNOD OF MORAY. 

THE REV. MORRIS FORSYTH, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
A'"ame.— The name is very ancient. In the charter given by 
Malcolm II. about 850 years ago, to the first bishop of this early 
see, it was called Morthelac or Morthlac. From the situation of 
the church, which is in a deep and hollow valley, some naturally 
enough think it is a corruption of the Gaelic word Morlay, great 
AoZ/ozy,— while others derive it from Mortislacus, the lake of death, 
alluding to a battle which was fought here, and which will be no- 
ticed in its proper place. Various other fanciful etymologies have 
been given. 

Extent, Surrounded by Glass on the east, Cabrach 

and Inveraven, including Glenlivat, on the south, Aberlour on the 
west,— with Boharm and Botriphnie towards the north,- it lies 51 
miles north-west from Aberdeen, and 30 south from Banff. Its 
form is irregular; the greatest length from the head of Glenrinnes 
to the pomt where it borders the Spey on the north, is fully 11 
miles; and the greatest breadth, from the banks of the Doveran to 
the foot of Benrinnes may be as much. It is encompassed with 
hills, the principal of which are Corhabbie and Benrinnes The 
latter towers conspicuous above all the others, being distinctly 
visible from the sea, from which it forms a good land-mark Its 
height above the level of the sea is estimated at 2561 feet from 
Its base, 1680. ' 

Climate, Hprmgs.-T air is pure and wholesome, though ra- 
ther moist than dry. We have several chalybeate springs similar 
0 those of Peterhead. There is one of a petrifying 4ture be- 
tween Morthven and Boharm. Besides the Doveran, which merely 
skirts the parish towards the south, the only two rivulets in the pa- 
nsh,aretheFiddichandDullen. The former has its source in Glen 
fiddich, towards Strathdon, the latter in Glenrinnes, on the bounda"- 
nes of Glenhvat; they unite about a mile below the church and 



104 



BANFFSHIRE. 



after a course of about 5 miles farther northward, run into the Spey. 
Their whole course may be about 12 or 14 miles. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — Limestone of good quality is found 
in the whole district. On some of the hills, particularly on the 
Conval, there is great abundance of granite well suited for build- 
ing ; and on others, abundance of coarse gray slate. On the burn 
of the Tulhch on the Kininvie property, there is some appearance 
of alum and lead ; and in one or two other places, there is a lami- 
nated rock, somewhat of the nature of asbestus. Antimony, in 
small quantities, is found imbedded in the lime rocks, while their 
fissures abound in calcspar. Small garnets, too, are sometimes 
found imbedded in the gray slate near the farm of Parkbeg, on the 
east side of the Fiddich. 

The soil is generally loamy, pretty deep, and fertile- 
Zoology. — Here are plenty of foxes, weasles, hares, badgers and 
otters. In the Duke of Gordon's forests of Glenfiddich, the red- 
deer are very numerous ; and at the head of it, there are convenient 
shooting quarters. Among birds, we have none more uncommon 
than the blackbird, thrush, goldfinch, bullfinch, linnet, and robin. 
We have also the migratory cuckoo, lapwing, and swallow ; and in 
the heath, there are grouse in abundance, and a few ptarmigan 
and black-cock. 

XL — Civil History. 
Shaw's History of the province of Moray contains, if not the 
most ancient, the best account of the civil history of this parish. 
Of historical events worthy of observation, the most memorable 
is that called the battle of Mortlach, in which Malcolm II. ob- 
tained a complete victory over the Danes, in the year 1010. Mal- 
colm had suffered a signal defeat from the Danes the preceding 
Year, and was compelled to leave them masters of the lands of 
Moray. Anxious, however, to expel these daring intruders, he 
returned, the year following, from the south with a powerful force, 
and the Danes having intelligence of his motions, came forward to 
give him battle. The armies having approached each other, in the 
neighbourhood of the church of Mortlach, engaged a very little to 
the northward of it. In the beginning of the attack, while push- 
ino- on with too ardent an impetuosity, Kenneth, Thane of the 
Isles, Dunbar, Thane of Laudian, and Graeme, Thane of Strath- 
earn, were unfortunately slain. Panic-struck by the loss of three 
of their generals, the Scotch got into confusion. Everything was 
now in a most doubtful state. The King, who had the character

of a brave, sensible, and pious man, was reluctantly borne along by 
the retreating crowd, till he was opposite the church of Mortlach, 
then a chapel dedicated to St Molach. The narrowness of the pass 
here abated a little the career of the pursuing Danes ; and the fly- 
ing army having a short space to breathe, were, from the very nature 
of the ground, again almost necessarily collected. The appearance 
of the consecrated walls inspired the monarch, in that age of su- 
perstition, with a devotional impulse. He prayed, paid' homage to 
the Virgin Mary and the tutelary saint, according to the manners 
of the times, and addressed himself in an animating speech to his 
countrymen and fellow-soldiers. At this critical moment, he put 
himself at the head of his forces, again pressed on the foe, threw 
Euetus, one of the Danish generals, from his horse, and killed him 
with his own hand. The charge was vigorously renewed ; and, un- 
der the mingled influence of patriotism and religion, the Scotch, 
carrying all before them, achieved the victory. Soon after this de- 
feat, the Danes left the kingdom. There are some appearances 
indicating that the final engagement, after rallying, happened a few 
hundred yards to the south-west of the Castle of Balvery ; and it 
seems more than probable, that the more ancient part of that build- 
ing v/as then in existence, for a fort is mentioned as near the field 
of battle.  

Antiquities. — The two old Castles of Auchindown and Balvery de- 
serve to be mentioned. They are, at present, in a ruinous state, but 
were, about two hundred years ago, both inhabited. When they 
were first built, and by whom, is not known. The former stands 
in a bold and commanding situation, on the banks of the Fiddich, 
and has, since the year 1535, been in possession of the Gordon 
family. The latter stands on a beautiful eminence, a little below 
the confluence of the Fiddich and Dullen, and is now the proper- 
ty of the Earl of Fife. On its front and over its high and massy 
gate still remaining, is a motto of the Stewarts, Earls of Athol, 
descriptive of the savage valour and unhappy circumstances of the 
times : " Furth Fortuine and Fill thi Fettris." 

Among some rubbish dug up about fifteen years ago, in the ruins 
of the Castle of Auchindown, a massive gold ring of three links 
was found, with a motto inscribed upon it, which, as it could only 
be read when the rings were in a certain position, seems to have 
been intended as a puzzle. It is supposed to be in the possession 



" Vide Fordun, Boetius, &amp;c. 



106 



BANFFSHIRE. 



of the Gordon family. Besides these, there are various traditional 
and sure memorials of the famous battle of Mortlach, which our 
present limits will only allow us briefly to mention. 

1. The vestiges of an intrenchment on the Conval hill, called 
the Danish Camp. 

2. A huge and irregularly rounded stone, now part of the fence 
about a corn field, said to have been placed over the grave of Eu- 
etus. 

3. Near the same place, is a small square piece of ground al- 
most covered with whins, into which multitudes of the dead were 
thrown. 

4. Three lengths of Malcolm's spear added to the length of the 
church, in fulfilment of his vow. 

5. Three of the Danes' skulls built into the north wall of the 
church, the moulds of which are to this day quite distinct. 

6. A large upright stone about seven feet high, on the one side 
of which are rudely carved the cross and two figures of animals, 
and on the other side a snake. 

Modern Buildings. — A small neat Roman Catholic chapel, built 
a few years ago, and a jail now in progress on the square in the 
villao-e, are the only modern buildings worthy of notice. 

III. — Population. 

It would appear, that, about fifty years previous to the date of 
the former Account, the parish had been considerably more popu- 
lous than it then was. Since the census of 1821, it has increased, 

which has been chiefly owing to the giving of land for feus, on 

part of Lord Fife's property. The village of Duff'town, which was 
begun in 1817, contains 756 souls, and the country partjof the parish 
1877 — making a total of 2633. The yearly average of births for 
the last seven years is 64 ; of deaths, 34 ; and of marriages, 10. An 
allowance may be made for two or three births omitted to be re- 
gistered every year.

don ; Lord Fife ; Mr Leslie of Kininvie ; Mr Gregory of Buch- 
romb ; and Mr Duff of Drummuir. The only resident heritor is 
Mr Gregory, Buchromb. 

Upon the whole, the inhabitants are a sedate and religious 
people, and in comfortable circumstances. We hear occasionally 
of poachers in our hills ; but, fortunately, illegal distillation, which 
at one time was carried on to a great extent in this parish, has of 
late, from the high fines imposed by the excise on those detected 
in it, become, it is believed, extinct. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — The gross rental of the parish is, as nearly as can 
be ascertained, about L. 4500. Of 35,000, the supposed number 
of acres in the pJirish, 5000 may be under cultivation, 30,000 waste 
or in pasture, of which from 400 to 500 may be capable of im- 
provement, and 600 under wood, consisting principally of ash, 
elm, plane, birch, oak, Scotch fir, larch, &amp;c. 

Rent of Land. — The land is generally rented at about L. 1 per 
acre, while the expense of grazing is at the rate of L. 2, 2s. per 
ox, and 2s. 6d. per ewe or full-grown sheep. 

Rate nf Wages. — Day-labourers at farm or other work receive 
from Is. 6d. to Is. lOd. per day without victuals, in winter from 
Is. to Is. 4d. ; Wrights per day of ten hours. Is. 8d. to 2s. ; ma- 
sons, do. Is. lOd. to 2s. ; farm-servants by the half year, maintain- 
ed in the family, men from L. 3 to L. 6 ; women from L. 1, 10s. 
to L. 2, 10s.; mason-work per rood for workmanship, L. 1 to 
L. ], 5s.; slate do. 12s. to 16s. 

Live-stock, 6fc. — The sheep are of the black-faced breed, and the 
cattle a cross between the Highland and Aberdeenshire breed. 

The state of husbandry is in general good, and of late much spi- 
rit in improving waste land, draining, &amp;c. has been displayed. 

Qjiarries. — There are several limestone and slate quarries within 
the parish, and though there is plenty of granite also, no quarry 
of this description has been wrought. 

Produce. — According to a calculation made by an individual of 
much experience, the annual produce is as follows : 



Grain raised in the parish, - - . L. 8935 

Potatoes, turnips, &amp;c. - - - - 3215 

Hay, including grass pasture, - - . - 3000 

Gardens and orchards, - - - - 80

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Village, Sc.—ln Dufftown, the only village in the parish, there is 
no regular weekly market ; but grain is brought there for the con- 
venience of dealers, who from time to time resort to the village. 

There are five cattle markets annually, which are well frequented. 
The nearest market-town, properly so called, is Keith, distant ele- 
ven miles. At Dufftown, there is a daily post which branches off 
from Craigellachie. The turnpike roads from Mortlach to Elgui, 
Keith and Fochabers extend six miles through the parish ; but, 
since the great flood of 1829, both the roads and the bridges over 
the Dullen and Fiddich have been entirely neglected. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The minister's stipend is 15 chalders, one- 
half barley and the other half meal, converted into money at the 
fiars prices of the county, and L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. 
The glebe, worn away at different periods by the inroads of the Dul- 
len, is, at the present period, about 5 acres in extent. An addw 
tion was made to the very old manse in 1807. 

The church, which is indeed venerable, may accommodate 1500 
sitters. It was a little modernized by an addition made to it seven 
years ago. Its walls are most probably as old as the beginning of 
the eleventh century, and so strong, that they may stand for many 
■years to come. Its situation is convenient for the most populous dis- 
trict of the parish. At the head of the parish, in Glenrinnes, there 
is a missionary chapel. The present incumbent, the Rev. Alex- 
ander Falconer, is paid L. 60 out of the Royal bounty. He has, 
besides, a free house and garden, with three acres of land. He 
preaches regularly, and catechises. Near the church, as before- 
mentioned, stands a handsome Catholic chapel. Of late years, in 
consequence of several families of that persuasion having taken feus 
and settled in the village, their numbers have increased, and amount 
at present to 170. From 40 to 50 of these are from neighbouring 
parishes. Divine service is regularly attended at the parish church, 
and the number of communicants never less than 700. There are 
no dissenting meeting-houses, nor any society for religious purposes, 
in the parish. 

Education. — Besides the parochial school, the average number 
of scholars at which is about 90, there is a school in Glenrinnes, 
supported by the Committee of the General Assembly, the num- 
ber of scholars attending which is about 80 in winter, and 30 in sum- 
mer ; also one in the village, supported solely by school fees, and 
two in Auchindown, the teachers of which receive annually L. 4 from 



MORTLACH. 



109 



the Duchess of Gordon. The parochial schoolmaster has the maxi- 
mum salary and the legal accommodations. All persons in the pa- 
rish, of proper age, can read, and almost all write a little. 

Libraries. — There is a small circulating library in the parish, 
and also a small library for the use of the children who attend the 
Sabbath school. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of paupers at present 
on the roll may be about 60, and these are wholly supported by 
collections made in the church, which may average from lis. to 
12s. weekly, and the interest of 1500 merks bequeathed by Wil- 
liam DufF, and L. 100 by Mr Alexander Forbes, a native of this 
parish. The interest of this last sum can only, in terms of Mr 
Forbes's will, be given to four families annually. Besides the 
above 1500 merks bequeathed by Mr DufF for behoof of the poor, 
he also bequeathed 500 merks for behoof of the schoolmaster. Dr 
John Lorimer, formerly of this parish, left L. 200 for the mainte- 
nance of a bursar at the school of Mortlach, and L. 200 more to 
enable him, if so inclined, to prosecute his studies at Marischal 
College, Aberdeen. It may be proper to observe, that the state- 
ment given in the former Statistical Account of this parish, of a 
sum of money having been bequeathed by a gentleman of the name 
of Moir, for the maintenance of a bursar from this parish, was in- 
correct.

PRESBYTERY OF ABERLOUR, SYNOD OF MORAY. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER WILSON, MINISTER. 



I. Topography and Natural History. 

Name.— Th name of this parish was originally Skirkdustan, 
from the word Skir, meaning, in the original Gaelic, to cut or di- 
vide, and Dust,m, the name of its tutelary saint ; the whole signify- 
ing Dustan's division or parish. It takes its modern name of Aber 
lour from its situation, the word literally signifying the locality near 
the influx of a noisy hum ; which burn, discharges itself into the 
Spey, about the middle of the northern boundary of the parish. 

Boundaries, Extent, -c— Aberlour is situated in the western 
part of the county of Banff; about 34 miles from the county town ; 
14 miles from Keith ; 14 from Elgin ; and 5 from Dufftown. 

The form of the parish nearly resembles a wedge. It extends 
9 miles along the southern bank of the Spey, from the hill of Car- 
ron on the west, to the influx of the Fiddich on the east, forming 
its northern boundary. Its eastern boundary, which represents the 
point of the wedge, extends backwards from the junction of the Fid- 
dich with the Spey, for about a mile of arable ground in a south- 
east direction ; the line of boundary then rises, in a south-west di- 
rection, along the summit of the Conval hills, and gradually diverg- 
es from the Spey, until, reaching the western boundary at the south- 
western extremity, it makes the greatest breadth of the parish 

nearly equal to its length. r i j 

On the north, it is separated from the parishes ot Knockando 
and Rothes by the river Spey; on the east, from Boharm, by the 
small river Fiddich ; on the south-east, from Mortlach by the Con- 
val'hiUs, and the brook Dullan in the vale of Glenrinnes ; and on 
the west, from Inveraven, by aline that passes from the rivulet Ter- 
vey over the western shoulder of Benrinnes and the hill of Carron 

to the river Spey. . , , i , 

Topographical Jppearances.-Theve is an almost complete moun- 
tain chain towards the southern part of the parish, consisting of the 



ABERLOUR. 



Ill 



Blue-hill, east and west Conval hills, the mountain of Benrinnes, 
and the broad hill of Cairnakay. This chain extends in an eastern 
and western direction. The three first mentioned hills belong part- 
ly to this parish, and partly to Mortlach ; the mountain of Benrin- 
nes is almost wholly embraced by Aberlour ; and the last mention- 
ed hill, Cairnakay, which completes the chain, belongs entirely to 
the parish of Inveraven. Besides these, Aberlour contains part of 
the hill of Carron, which is situated on the borders of Inveraven, 
close to the banks of the river Spey, and separated from Benrin- 
nes by a narrow valley. 

Benrinnes is a steep and sharp-pointed mountain, as its name 
from the original Gaelic implies, 2747 feet above the level of 
the sea, and 1876 feet from its own base. Its south and east 
sides or acclivities, particularly the south, are very steep, thereby 
verifying the observation of Bergman, who, in his physical geogra- 
phy, maintains, that " in chains ranging from east to west, the 
southern acclivity is the steepest." This is the highest hill in the 
country, for many miles round. From the top may be seen, in a 
clear day, the Grampian hills to the south, the romantic valley and 
hills of Glenaven to the west, and to the north, as far as the moun- 
tains of Ross, Sutherland, and Caithness. It commands a prospect 
of the sea for many miles along the coasts of Moray and Banff- 
shires, and forms a useful land-mark on that part of the ocean. A 
deep and narrow gorge or pass to the east separates this moun- 
tain from the Convals. This pass, called Glack-harnis, deserves 
particular notice, on account of its great length, its uniform breadth 
at the bottom, and the immense height and regularity of the slope 
on both its sides. 

The Convals are obtuse and dome-shaped hills, of twin appear- 
ance, considerably lower than Benrinnes, and entirely covered with 
heath. 

Running as an elbow from the western part of the Blue-hill, 
and to the north of the Convals, lies an elevated patch of land of 
a hilly description, called Allachie ; but the whole of this is either 
planted or under cultivation. 

The main valley is embraced by this elevated land, the Convals 
and Benrmnes. The southern part of this vallev, which partly 
consists of sloping land at the foot of the Convals, is called the 
Daugh or district of Edinvillie, and is separated by a brook -to the 
north-east from the land of Allachie ; and by the burn of Aberlour 
to the north, from the daugh of Ruthrie ; which last, situated in 



112 B\NFFSH1RE. 



the mouth of the valley, and becoming a little elevated to form its 
northern acclivitv, continues at nearly the same level, tillwithm a 
few hundred yards of the Spey. 

To the north-west of the daugh of Ruthrie, and at nearly the 
same level, lies the Daugh of Kinnermony, a small part of which 
consists of haugh or holm land on the banks of the Spey, commu- 
nicating with the more elevated parts, by a gentle slope. 

The Dauo-h of Carron lies to the west of that of Kmnermony, 
from which Tt is separated by a mountain rivulet, which runs m a 
very deep ravine. A considerable part of this division lies lower 
than the former, descending gradually from the borders of Inver- 
aven on the west, and forming a continuation of the valley between 
Benrinnes and the hill of Carron, already mentioned. Here, to- 
wards the Spev, there is a'considerable extent of fine holm land. 

To the eastof the Daugh of Ruthrie, and separated from it by 
the burn of Aberlour, lies the elevated land formerly mentioned, 
called the Daugh of Allachie, and to the east of this last, that ot 
Aberlour -both descending, by an almost uniform slope ot an ele- 
vation of nine or ten degrees, till within a short distance of the 
Spey. Close upon the Spey, Allachie contains a little holm land ; 
and still farther back from the river, a terrace about ten feet above 
the former, presents a considerable surface of level land extendmg 

to the foot of the acclivity. , , , i j j • 

The Daugh of Aberlour also contains a little holm land, and is 
watered by two rivulets which descend from the Blue-hiU, and 
uniting form the burn called Allachoy ; which burn divides Aber- 
lour, on the east, from the daugh of Drumfurrich. _ 

This last Daugh embraces all the eastern part of the parish si- 
tuated between the burn of Allachoy and the river Fiddich, and 
is mostly of a level description, with the exception of a httle slop- 
ing land at the foot of the Blue-hill, and the rising ground of Ta- 
manurie, near the river, which descends gradually to the south- 
east and is entirely cultivated on that side, but falls precipitately 
to the north-west, where its rocky foot is washed by the Spey. 
This Daugh also contains two beautiful fields of holm land. 

The remaining part of the cultivated land belonging to the pa- 
rish lies in the narrow vale of Glenrinnes; between which and the 
main body of the parish, the pass called Glack-harnis, formerly 
mentioned as separating Benrinnes from the western Conval, opens 
an almost level communication. , • u • j •

bottom of the vale, appertams to Aberlour, and contains several 
good fields, partly level and partly sloping from the foot of the hills. 

Climate. — The climate of the parish is, on the whole, tem- 
perate ; along the river, it is warm, — so much so, that there is fre- 
quently little appearance of snow here, when the surrounding 
country is covered with it. Those parts in the neighbourhood of 
Benrinnes and the Convals, and especially the district of Glenrin- 
nes, suffer more from Alpine inclemency, than any other parts of 
the parish. 

In the commencement of winter, Benrinnes is usually covered 
with snow, or, as the country people say, " has on its night-cap," 
long before any part of the surrounding country. 

The harvests in the neighbourhood of this and the adjoining 
hills, and in the district of Glenrinnes, are a few weeks later than 
in the vicinity of the Spey, partly owing to the traces of winter con- 
tinuing longer, and partly to the great quantity of rain, which, 
from the proximity of the hills, falls there during summer. 

Although a few weeks of severe drought during summer have 
been supposed at the time to be injurious to the crops, yet for se- 
veral years prior to 1835, and, indeed, in general, there has not 
been much occasion to complain of want of rain in any part of the 
parish. 

Hydrography. — Owing to the rapidity of the current, the Spey 
is little broader here than in Badenoch, fifty miles nearer its 
source, where the water flows more slowly. The fields in the 
immediate vicinity frequently suffer a little from overflowings 
of the river; and August 1829 witnessed the greatest and most 
destructive flood within the memory of any living inhabitant. In 
1768, the water is recorded to have risen eighteen feet perpendicu- 
lar above its ordinary level, but this was exceeded in 1829 by about 
eighteen inches. All the holm land belonging to the parish was 

more or less injured, along with the crops that it bore at the time, 

the soil of some fields being carried off to the extent of many acres 
bare to the channel, and others covered with sand and rough gra- 
vel to the depth of several feet. The dry stone arches which 
formed the eastern approach to the metal bridge of Craig EUachie 
to be noticed hereafter, were entirely swept away, leaving only 
a few yards of mason work to be a precarious support to that end of 
the arch. A cottage, garden, and offices near the foot of the bridge 
were entirely carried off" ; and much damage was done to furniture

and property in other parts of the parish by the water, which stood 
to the height of four or five feet in some dwelling-houses. 

There is a beautiful cascade called the Lynn of Ruthrie, on the 
Burn of Aberlour, about a mile above where it runs into the Spey. 
The stream, after occupying several yards of a smooth channel worn 
out by the water in the solid rock, is precipitated from a height of 
thirty feet, and, being broken in its fall about the middle of this 
height, by a projecting platform of the same rock, falls into a cir- 
cular pool or basin below, formerly of immense depth, but now 
greatly filled up by the boulders and debris brought from the hills 
in the flood of 1829. The rock, which is of red granite, rises to 
a great height above the fall ; and with its sylvan cover of birch and 
other shrubs presents, along with the fall, a very romantic and 
beautiful appearance. 

Sail, Sj'c.—The few fields of holm land, formed by the river, con- 
sist of a rich deep loam mixed with sand. A little farther from 
the river, a like mould occurs on a bed of rough gravel. To- 
wards the foot of the hills, in the east and middle parts of the pa- 
rish, the soil becomes a deep clay on a bed of gravel, covered with 
a thin alluvial soil ; and towards the foot of Benrinnes, there oc- 
curs a good deal of moss on patches lately improved from heathy 
surfaces. About the centre of the parish, there is a good deal of 
rich alluvial soil on granite rock, and there is still more soil, of the 
same productive nature, on alternate beds of clay and gravel, to- 
wards the eastern and western extremities of the parish, at the 
same distance from the river. The soil of that part of Glenrin- 
nes which belongs to Aberlour consists partly of loam and partly 
of clay, upon a pretty uniform rock of limestone, and averages from 
one to three feet in depth. 

No lime-rock is found in this parish or Inveraven, north of the 
mountain chain; but south of the chain, the parishes of Mortlach, 
Aberlour in Glenrinnes, and Glenlivat in Inveraven, are pervaded 
bv that useful rock, which runs in a continued vein through the 
whole of these districts. 

Mortlach supplies great part of Aberlour with lime at 2s. per 
boll, which answers the purposes of the farmer better here than 
in limestone districts, by rendering the soil very productive. The 
farmers in the upper part of the parish, from their near locality to 
Glenrinnes, prefer driving limestones from a quarry there, which 
they burn for themselves on their own farms.

Spey, has likewise, as well as theditFerence of climate, formerly men- 
tioned, a markedeffecton the period and continuance of vegetation. 
In the latter situation, where the soil is comparatively lightand sandy , 
vegetation is early, but the growth of grass, &amp;c. generally begins 
to fail by midsummer ; whereas in the more retentive soil of Glen- 
rinnes, vegetation is but partial until the day is longest ; but here 
the grazing continues good in autumn, when the fields on Spey side 
are comparatively bare. 

Zoology. — The migratory birds, the cuckoo, lapwing, and swal- 
low, make their appearance here at stated seasons during spring and 
summer, and disappear towards autumn, sometimes a little earlier 
or later, according to the comparative mildness of the season. The 
woodcock, too, generally appears in autumn, and disappears again 
about the end of April. Roe-deer may be found on the hill of 
Carron, and black-cock may be generally found there, although 
not very numerous. Partridges, plover, grouse, and hares abound 
on the hills of the parish, particularly Benrinnes, which is under- 
stood to be the nursery of game, to the moors of the surrounding 
country, to a great distance. There are also snipes and wild ducks 
to be found in the vale of Glenrinnes. White hares, ptarmigans, 
and eagles are sometimes seen on the top of Benrinnes. Foxes 
and wild cats still exist in the parish, but are becoming more rare. 

There is good salmon and trout fishing in the Spey and Fid- 
dich. Several pools in the former opposite to this parish are sup- 
posed to equal any other, for rod-fishing, in the whole course of that 
river. 

The fishing commences on the 1st of February, and closes on 
the 14th September; and a little after the latter period, the fish 
come up for spawning, and, sometime before the former, they re- 
turn again to the sea. 

During the time of spawning, a small bird called the water-cock 
abounds in the Spey and its tributaries, which is considered very 
destructive in diving and picking up the spawn. 

Formerly any person, who succeeded in killing one of these birds, 
was allowed, as a reward, the privilege of fishing in the close sea- 
son ; but, for a long time back, this has been lost sight of. 

Plantations.— i:\\QXQ are several thriving plantations of firs on 
the hilly parts of the districts of Aberlour, Allachie, and Carron, 
with some elm and ash trees nearer the river, the banks of which 
are, in many parts, covered with birch of a remarkable size.

lI._CiviL History. 

This parish can boast of no remarkable antiquities. 

Land-owners.— It belongs to four proprietors, Lord Fife ; James 
William Grant, Esq. of Wester Elchies; Alexander Grant, Esq. 
of Aberlour ; and the Earl of Seafield. Lord Fife is the greatest 
land-owner, and the Earl of Seafield the least, the latter posses- 
sing only the small property of Mudhouse. Aberlour is the only 
family seat in the parish. 

Parochial Registers.— A parochial register has been regularly 
kept since the year 1707, down to the present time, with t ex- 
ception of some trifling blanks during the troublesome period ot 
1745. A registration of marriages, births, and deaths was uni- 
formly made at the commencement of this period ; but that of 
deaths has been discontinued for the last seventy-six years. 

Modern Buildings.— "eRV the influx of the burn of Aberlour, 
on the daugh of Allachie, stand the roofless walls of the old church ; 
and about 300 yards farther to the east, on the same plain, is si- 
tuated the new church, a handsome and commodious building, 

erected in 1812. 

About the same period, Charles Grant, Esq. of Wester Elchies, 
commenced the building of a village on this plain embracing all 
the holm land of the district to the extent of half a mile in 
lencrth, and erected it into a borough of barony, under the name ot 
Chlrlestown of Aberlour. This village now contains 250 inhabi- 
tants, and has four markets in the course of the year, held respec- 
tively on the first Thursday of April, Thursday before the 21st of 
May, second Thursday of July, and second Thursday of Novem- 
ber.

Gaelic language. The people are decidedly sober, and in-

dustrious in their habits, neat and cleanly in their persons, and 
temperate in their diet, which, although animal food is occa- 
sionally used in the poorest families, principally consists, among 
the labouring classes, of milk and vegetable fare of their ow n pro- 
duce. They are in general contented and comfortable in their 
circumstances. Nor are they behind their neighbours, in point of 
shrewdness and intelligence. They are, in general, very well in- 
formed according to their station in life, and the tone of their minds 
may certainly be considered as moral and religious. A consider- 
able change for the better in these respects is understood to have 
taken place since the suppression of smuggling, — a case of which is 
now scarcely ever heard of within the bounds of the parish. 

IV. — Industry. 
The cultivated parts of the parish, which may be about one-half 
of its whole extent, and a great proportion of which has been im- 
proved within the last twelve years, are divided into farms, of from 
L. 10 to L. 100 of yearly rent, generally under leases of nineteen 
years' duration. Some of the farms are inclosed by good stone 
fences, and the farm-buildings are in general substantial and com- 
modious. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent per acre may be reckoned at 
L. 1, 5s., inclusive of permanent pasture susceptible of cultivation, 
the extent of which may be again estimated at about one-twen- 
tieth part of what is under the plough. Some moors, too, in the 
centre of the parish may be under cultivation in the course of years. 

The soil, with due culture, is in general capable of raising all 
sorts of grain, barley, oats, wheat, pease, &amp;c. ; and it is remarked, 
that the average weight of barley here is from a pound and a-half 
to two pounds more per bushel than in the heavier soils of the 
neighbouring parishes Mortlach and Glass. 

All the farmers raise black-cattle of the Morayshire breed, and 
those near the hills keep a flock of sheep of the hardy black-faced 
kmd ; but, on the whole, grain is the staple commodity the farmer 
has to depend on. 

Prices.— W\i\\va the last two years, the price of oats has varied 
from 16s. to L. 1, 2s. per quarter ; barley from L. 1, Is. to L. 1, 4s. 

BnU of Woges.~i:\iQ rate of wages to farm-servants may be 
stated as follows : for a first or principal man, L. 6 per half year ; 
a ploughman, L. 4, 10s. ; and maid-servants from L. 1, 10s. toL.  
all inclusive of lodging and maintenance. Tradesmen's wages 
are moderate, mason and carpenters' work being furnished bv es-

timate,-which system is understood to have lowered the expense 
to less than one-half, within the last twelve years. 

V.—Parochial Economy. , , , 

Means of Communication.-The parish has enjoyed the ad- 
vantage of a sub-post-office to Mortlach, ever since the year 1803 ; 
and in addition to this, a first-office was estabhshed, some years ago, 
at Craio- Ellachie, which now communicates daily with a prmc.pal 
office at'Ballindalloch through Aberlour, and also with the two sub- 
offices of Dufftown and Rothes. The means of communication have 
been greatly improved by a toll-road, which was made in 1817, and 
runs through the whole extent of the parish, from the bridge of 
Fiddich to the hill of Carron on the borders of Inveraven. An- 
other very useful road was made last season, in the south, or Glen- 
rinnes part of the parish, running through that vale from Duff- 
town in Mortlach to Glenhvat and Tomintoul. 

Ecclesiastical State.-lt has been formerly stated, that a new 
parish church was erected in the year 1812. This contains /OO 
sittings, all free. It is, at present, in good repair, and is con- 
veniently situate for the attendance of the greater part of the 
parish -being, with the exception of Glenrinnes, not more than 
three miles and a-half distant from its farthest extremity in an 
east and south direction, and little more than four from the far- 
thest habitation on the west, or Inveraven side. 

The whole population belong to the Established Church, with 
the exception of a few Seceders and Independents, who likewise at- 
tend divine service occasionally in the church. 

The manse is a very old building. It was, many years ago, pro- 
nounced, by decreet of presbytery, to be insufficient ; and having 
sustained considerable damage by the flood in 1829, which re- 
duced it to an entirely ruinous condition, the incumbent was al- 
lowed, in lieu of a new manse, an annuity for seven years from 

that date. . , «. , . ,i i. 

A ereat part of the glebe land was carried off bare to the chan- 
nel and hi order to protect the remaining part, and preserve its 
former bout.daries, two bulwarks were erected by the heritors at a 
Lit expense in 1830 ; one on the Spey, about 600 yards above 
fhe'glebe land, and the other on the burn of Aberlour where .t 
forms the boundary of the glebe, and near its junction with the Spey. 
Although that part of the field that was injured is entirely use- 
Z in fhe meantime, yet, it is hoped that the stagnant water re- 
ceived periodically in the excavated parts behind the bulwarks,

from the repeated risings of the Spey, will, by leaving- successive 
layers of alluvial deposit, produce a tolerable soil in the course of 
time. 

The stipend is 14 chalders of grain, one-half barley, and one- 
half oatmeal, with L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. 

There is a missionary establishment in the valley of Glenrinnes, 
for the accommodation of that remote part which belongs to Aber- 
lour, as well as the remainder of the vale appertaining to Mort- 
lach. There is a neat and commodious chapel at this station, and 
the minister, who is an ordained clergyman of the Church of Scot- 
land, receives L. 60 per annum from the Royal Bounty, and is pro- 
vided by the heritors with a manse, glebe, and some other little 
accommodations. He performs every parochial duty in his dis- 
trict, with the exception of administering the sacrament. There 
are about 460 communicants yearly at the church, inclusive of this 
district. Divine service is usually very well attended, both at the 
church and the missionary station of Glenrinnes. 

Education. — There is one parochial school and a female school 
in Charlestown for the accommodation of the main part of 
the parish, — the district of Glenrinnes being supplied by an Assem- 
bly school in that place. The branches of education taught in the 
parish school are, Latin, geography, arithmetic and elementary 
mathematics, writing, English grammar, and English reading, witlx 
the principles of Christian knowledge. 

At the female school, sewing, knitting, and English reading are 
taught; and English reading, arithmetic and writing, being the 
branches most required in the country, are taught in the Assem- 
bly's school of Glenrinnes. 

The salary of the parish schoolmaster is the maximum, L. 34, 4s. 
4id. and the school fees average from L. 10 to L. 15 per annum. 

The schoolmistress has a free house, a garden, and a small 
croft of land, from the proprietor, Mr Grant of Elchies, which, 
along with the school fees and the proceeds of her own industry 
in dress-making, form her only dependence. 

The parochial schoolmaster has the legal accommodations, but, 
m common with most of his brethren, finding these insufficient, he 
has lately built a small addition to his dwelhng-house at his own 
expense, in the hopes, that, when farther accommodation shall 
have been granted to the schoolmasters in general, he maybe re- 
imbursed for his outlay. The school fees are very moderate, and

the people in general appear sensible of the benefits of education, 
the poorest of the parish contriving to keep their children sonie 
time, more or less, at school,— in which and similar cases, education 
is given gratis. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The average number of the poor 
upon the roll may be stated at 30, who receive pecuniary assist- 
ance now and then, according to their respective necessities, and 
as far as the funds will admit. The weekly collections at the 
church here average about 7s., and at the chapel of Glenrinnes 
about 2s., one-third of which last falls to Aberlour, and, in conse- 
quence, the poor of Glenrinnes have an equal claim with the rest 
of the parish upon the session funds. Besides the weekly collec- 
tions, the poor derive assistance from a mortification of 3 bolls 
of meal, payable yearly, off' a small farm belonging to the Earl 
of Fife. The sums thus realized from time to time, along with 
the interest on two bequeathments of 100 merks each, "as also that 
arising from small sums occasionally put to interest in times of 
plenty, and penalties for immoralities, form a supply scarcely 
adequate to meet the wants of the poor, even without taking into 
account the burden of two pauper lunatics, who, though mainly 
supported by the heritors, have, for many years, been receiving aid 
from the funds. Application is seldom made for relief, without ne- 
cessity on the part of the applicant ; but, on the other hand, it fre- 
quently happens that unobtrusive individuals of delicate feelings are 
disposed to suffer considerable destitution, before making their case 
known ; but the members of session endeavour, as far as in their 
power, to find out such cases, and give assistance in a manner the 
least off'ensive. 

Distiller/.— In concluding this account of parochial economy, it 
may be stated, that there is one whisky distillery, on a large scale, 
in the parish, situated at Aberlour, which is considered an accom- 
modation to the surrounding farmers, in affording a ready and conve- 
nient market for their barley. There are two or three houses of 
entertainment in the parish, for which spirit licenses are annually 
granted, besides two principal inns, namely, the New Inn, situated 
in Charlestown, and the Cottage Inn, only separated from the vil- 
lage bv the burn of Aberlour.

Miscellaneous Observations. 

On comparing the present state of the parish with that exhibited at 
the termination of the last century, it appears, that a great addition 
has been made to its cultivated parts, as well as a great improve- 
ment in the method of culture adopted. These, in addition to the 
erection of the village of Charlestown, and the increased facility of 
communication by means of the toll-road formerly mentioned, form 
the most striking variations between the state of the parish at that 
time and its present state. 

The bridge of Craig EUachie over the Spey, near the eastern 
extremity of the parish, likewise adds most materially to the ac- 
commodation of the whole country south of that river, by opening 
up a communication to the Elgin markets, and to Garmouth, 
the chief grain market for this quarter ; from which last place too, 
this part of the country is most conveniently supplied with coals. 
This bridge was erected in the year 1815, at an expense of L. 8000, 
raised partly by subscription, and partly by voluntary assessment, 
along with L. 4000 from Government ; and in consequence there 
never was any pontage exacted. It consists of a single metal arch 
upwards of 160 feet in span, resting, on the north or Knockando 
side, on a solid rock, which gives name to the bridge, and on a 
strong pillar of mason work built on piles, on the east or Aberlour 
side. 

In the Knockando approach, the road was cut in the solid rock 
to the height of 70 feet in the immediate vicinity of the bridge, 
and upwards of 100 yards in length. Besides its advantage to the 
country, which is universally acknowledged to be very great, the 
appearance of the bridge, along with the majestic perpendicular 
rock frowning over its western approach, is very grand and impos- 
ing—adding greatly to the effect of the surrounding beautiful and 
picturesque scenery.— It is frequently visited by strangers as an 
object of curiosity. 

With respect to the improvements, of which the parish may be 
still considered susceptible, the chief regards the communication 
between its main body and the district of Glenrinnes. A road on. 
this line would be highly beneficial to every part of the parish, by 
increasing the facility of driving limestone from Glenrinnes, and 
peat fuel from the foot of Benrinnes, to the district of Edinvillie, 
and those parts in the vicinity of the Spey, and also by affording

BANFFSHIRE. 



the farmers of Glenrinnes a more direct communication to a mar- 
ket for their grain. The present substitute for a road is a rough 
cart track, running through the district of Edinvilhe and Glack- 
harnis, almost impassable, especially after the severe winter floods ; 
but such is the necessity of having a road on this line, that much 
expense has been already laid out upon it, by temporary repairs 
yearly, partly by allocation of small sums from the road funds, and 
partly by private subscription. 

It is in contemplation, however, to make a road near the pre- 
sent track, to communicate with the Aberlour toll-road, a little 
to the west of the manse at one of its extremities, and to join, at its 
other extremity, the road that has lately been made in Glenrin- 
nes ; as also another branch to run from Edinvillie towards the 
Carron district, with the view of accommodating the western parts 
of the parish. This road is anticipated with pleasure as a very 
great improvement. 

The farmers of this parish are spirited according to their means, 
and some have employed a large capital to good account. 

The system of husbandry adopted is much the same as that 
pursued in other agricultural districts. Some years ago, the High- 
land Society gave premiums for the curing of butter, to a district 
embracing this and five other neighbouring parishes, and the first 
and second of four prizes were adjudged to Aberlour. The patriotic 
and praiseworthy exertions of this national society, in the distri- 
bution of prizes for improvements in husbandry, certainly appear 
to be attended with those beneficial effects at which they aim : and 
it is to be hoped, that another competition, lately announced for 
this quarter, will be met by the good people with that emulation 
which the society has already, in a great measure, inspired.

PRESBYTERY OF ABERLOUR, SYNOD OF MORAY. 

THE REV. WILLIAM ASHER, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Extent, and Boundaynes. — This parish takes its name 
from the situation of its church, which stands on the south bank 
of the Spey, about a mile below the junction of the ' Aven with 
that river. Stretching back into the Grampians towards the 
sources of the Don for about '20 miles, with a breadth varying 
from 3 to 8 or 9, and lying partly in the county of Moray, but 
chiefly in the county of Banff, — it is bounded on the north by the 
parish of Knockando ; on the west by Cromdale and Kirkmichael ; 
on the south by Strathdon, and that part of Tarland which is at- 
tached thereto quoad sacra ; and on the east by Glenbucket, Ca- 
brach, Mortlach, and Aberlour, — with masses of lofty mountains 
intervening betwixt it and all these parishes except Knockando, 
in the direction of which the Spey forms the boundary. 

Topographical Appearances. — Consisting, in by much the larger 
proportion, of moorland and mountain, this extensive parish has 
upon the whole a bleak and barren appearance, particularly when 
entering the lower end of the parish by the toll-road from the 
east ; but along the rivers, near the banks of which both the arable 
land and natural wood chiefly lie, the prospect is in general pleas- 
ing, and occasionally highly picturesque and attractive. About 
three miles back from, and nearly parallel to, the Spey, Cairnocay, 
a lofty range of mountains extending from Benrinnes to the Aven, 
divides the lower part, or what may be termed Inveraven proper, 
from Glenlivet, a country well known to most Scotchmen by name, 
—while some six or eight miles further on, Glenlivet is itself di- 
vided into nearly equal parts by the Bochle, a high hill rising up 
in the centre of the valley, flanked on either hand by projecting 
masses of the neighbouring mountains. These three districts, 
thus divided by natural boundaries, are pretty equal in point of 
extent, and have an average population of about 900. The one. 



124 



BANFFSHIRE. 



above the Bochle, though the flattest part of the parish, is called 
the Braes of Glenlivet ; below it, the river, or water of Livet, as it 
is generally termed, runs through the centre of the valley, and 
then, though comprehending a more level district, called Morange, 
diverging from the east bank of the river, the country has much 
more of the characteristics of the true highland glen. In the 
lower or parish church district, the Aven, which enters the ia- 
rish from the south-west, and skirts Glenlivet for about a couple 
of miles, flows on through a narrow strath or glen to the Spey, 
from which the ascent is not so rapid, there being to the north of 
Cairnocay a considerable breadth of country sloping gradually to 
the mountain as well as to the river. 

Benrinnes, which, though much lower than some others, is al- 
ways classed among the highest mountains of Scotland, is situated 
on the eastern or Aberlour boundary, towering to the height of 
2763.5 feet according to the late Government survey above low 
mater-mark. This mountain, when seen from Inveraven proper, 
has rather a tame and heavy appearance, but its aspect From 
Glenlivet is both imposing and majestic,— while from the top, where 
there is a small bason in the rock usually filled with water, and a 
cave supposed to have been the hiding-place of James Grant of 
Carron, better known by the name of James au Tuim, or James 
of the hill, the prospect is very extensive, stretching, it is said, 
from Caithness to the county of Dumbarton. The other moun- 
tains, both within and bounding the parish, are all of considerable 
altitude, but they present little either in conformation or appear- 
ance particularly deserving of notice. They consist chiefly of flat 
unbroken ranges running in a southern and western direction. 

Climate, Diseases, SfC.— Y\\Q climate is decidedly different in 
each of the three districts into which nature has divided the pa- 
rish,~the coldest, which is that of the Braes of Glenlivet, being 
perhaps as much inferior to the climate on the river sides, in the 
parish church district, as the latter is inferior to the climate of the 
sea coast. Snow, the first indications of which usually manifest 
themselves on the top of Benrinnes, not unfrequently lies in In- 
veraven proper, as well as in the upper- districts to a great depth, 
interrupting field operations, and sometimes shutting up the 
communication, when, at the distance of ten or fifteen miles, not 
a vestio-e of hoary winter is to be seen ; still the climate is abun- 
dantly healthy, and such as to serve in ordinary seasons for bring- 
ing to maturity the fruits commonly produced in the gardens on 

«3 



INVEUAVEN.

the coast. Vegetation, though commencing late, advances rapidly 
when stimulated by summer heat, heightened by the reflection 
from the mountains, and in favourable years, of which for the last 
thirteen there has been little or no interruption, the grain crops 
produced even in the Braes of Glenlivet might not unfrequently 
compete, both in respect of quantity and quality, with the produce 
of the low districts of Banff and Moray. In the summer mondis, 
water spouts sometimes fall, and thunder storms are very common. 
No disease seems to be peculiar to the parish. Frequent cases 
of cancer have occurred of late, and consumption is very common ; 
but the people are in general both healthy and hardy. 

Hydrography. — It is not a little singular that, in so wide and 
mountainous a parish, there is no lake, with the exception of a very 
small one near the Kirkmichael boundary, and within a short dis- 
tance of the Aven, supposed to have been formed by that river when 
running on a higher elevation than at present, which people in the 
neighbourhood describe as bottomless, and as containing " a 
ploughman, his plough, and a yoke of oxen." The linn of Livet, 
which was the only waterfall in the parish, was destroyed some 
years ago, with the view of affording free course to the few salmon 
that enter that stream. Springs are numerous ; some of them 
very copious, and almost all affording water of excellent quality, 
though none are said to be medicinal. The most remarkable is 
one at Chapeltonof Kilmaichlie, in the immediate neighbourhood of 
the outlines of the old chapel, mentioned in the former report, which 
is cased with stones, indicating that though now visited only as an 
object of curiosity, it was possibly in repute in times of old, for 
common or medicinal purposes. Another spring, close by, is also 
cased at the mouth, though only recently, and in imitation of 
the former.— Of rivers in the parish, the most important is the 
Spey, which sweeps the parish on the north-west for about seven 
miles, and is said to discharge as much water as any river in Scot- 
land, though, from the rapidity with which it flows, smaller in appear- 
ance than some others. The Aven, the largest of the Spey's tri- 
butaries, though, except in floods, which usually commence twelve 
or more hours earlier, producing but little perceptible increase of 
its waters,— takes its rise from a loch of the same name lying at the 
foot of the mountains of Benmacdui, Benna-maur, and Cairngo- 
rum, and after flowing through the parish of Kirkmichael, for thir- 
ty or thirty-five miles, enters this parish, about seven miles from its 
mouth. At Drumin, it receives the Livet, swollen into a considerable 



126 



BANFF SHIRK. 



river by the tributary streams of Crombie and Tervie, the former, 
which is the drain of the lowest side of the country, called the 
Braes of Glenlivet, falling into it at Tombia, and the latter that 
of Morange and the country bordering on Glenrinnes, at Tom- 
breakachie. Of the smaller streams, the most considerable are 
Kymah, Aldregnie, Altachoylachan, and Tommore. The first, Ky» 
mah, takes its rise in the mountains bounding the parish to the 
south-east, and is larger at the junction than the Livet, which hap 
also its source in these mountains. Aldregnie falls into the Livet 
at the east side of the Bochle. Altachoylachan is tributary to the 
Tervie and Tommore, the chief outlet of the waters north of Cairno- 
cay. The Spey is celebrated for the value of its salmon fisheries 
and the quality of the fish, and also for the quantity of fir timber 
annually floated on it from the forests of Abernethy and Ro- 
thiemurchus ; and the Aven for its uncommon transparency, 
which makes it dangerous for strangers to attempt fording, being 
often many feet deep where it scarcely appears to be two, and 
hence the doggerel lines. 

" The water of Aven so fair and clear, 
Would deceive a man of 100 year." 

Some twenty or thirty years ago, salmon were very abun • 
dant, both in the Aven and the Spey ; and in the latter, fish 
were frequently caught in the parish upwards of thirty pounds 
weight ; but now, owing to the close fishing at and towards 
the mouth of the river, by means of nets and cruives, few escape, 
and those reaching this are seldom to be met with above twenty 
pounds weight. Grilse, salmon or white trout, finnock, trout, par, 
stickleback, pike, flounders, eels, and large fresh water muscles, 
in which pearls of some value are sometimes to be found, are all 
numerous in the Spey, and, with the exception of pike and mus- 
cles, are also to be found in the Aven, which, with its tributaries, 
is much superior to the Spey for trout, and, accordingly, except 
for grilse and salmon, held in higher repute by the angler. The 
salmon fishings on the Spey for some miles from its mouth, of 
which, since the death of the late much lamented Duke of Gordon, 
his Grace the Duke of Richmond is proprietor, yield a rent of from 
L. 8000 to L. 10,000 a-year. In the intermediate parishes, the pro- 
prietors either let them for trifling rents, or protect and retain them 
for their own use ; but in this parish and farther up, they are con- 
sidered of little or of no value. 

Geology and Mineralogy — The rocks throughout this parish are 
supposed to be wholly of primitive formation, the most prevalent 



IN VK RAVEN.

being gneiss. A vein of red granite running towards the Spey, 
and very suitable for building purposes, appears on the north side 
of Benrinnes. Small portions of asbestos have also been found on 
that mountain, and rock crystals occasionallv in the boulder 
stones of the Aven. But the most interestino- feature in the tjeo- 
logy of this parish is the limestone of Glenlivet, which is consider- 
ed by geologists as imbedded in the gneiss, and not as constitut- 
ing or representing a separate formation, such as mountain lime- 
stone or the like. It is of much superior quality to the secon- 
dary rock, which is quarried as limestone and used for agricultural 
purposes in the neighbourhood of Elgin and Forres, being of the 
same description as that of Mortlach and Duthil. None has been 
discovered in the parish north of Cairnocay, but throughout Glen- 
livet it may be found almost in every burn, and under every field. 
No regular manufacture of lime, however, as at the great works 
of Ardonald in Cairnie, and at Dufftown in the neighbour- 
ing parish of Mortlach, has yet been commenced in that quar- 
ter. Some of the tenants dig for themselves, but the principal 
quarries are given in charge to persons who pay no rent, but who 
are taken bound to sell the stones at prices proportioned to the 
depth oitir, or superincumbent soil, ranging from d. to Ud. the 
ten stone weight, which is computed to yield one full of the old 
corn firlot, or thirty-two pints of lime shells. Though there is a 
trifling demand from the low end of Cromdale and thetipper end of 
Knockando, as well as from Inveraven proper, the chief market for 
the quarried rock is found at home. Hence, lime kilns are to be seen 
on almost every farm in Glenlivet, for which and for family purposes, 
no small portion of time is taken up in providing peat fuel. Lime 
IS got in this way at less nominal expense, but both manual and 
animal labour on the farms is in consequence much increased, and 
the attention of the farmer too much divested from the cultivation 
of his farm and the care of his stock, to the production of a stimu- 
lant, which It would be much to his advantage to procure in a ma- 
nufactured state. Some years ago, a kiln was put in operation on 
the Balhndalloch estate, in the immediate neighbourhood of an 
inexhaustible supply of peat near the top of Cairnocay, to which 
the limestone was driven up the hill from Morange in Glenlivet 
but It was soon given up,~it having been found that peat fuel is un- 
aaapted for the manufacture of lime on a large scale, and that a 
supply coidd more conveniently be procured from the works at Duff 
town in Mortlach, where it is always to be had for about nine' 
months of the year.

Soil — The soil of the parisli, tliough occasionally thin and 
nioory, may, on the whole, be said to be ood. At Tomalinan, 
notffir from the marl pit mentioned in the former report, is a bank of 
land where the loam is upwards of three feet deep, said not to be 
inferior to anv land in Banffshire ; while on mains of Moranore, and 
some of the neighbouring farms, it is a strong rich clay, extreme- 
ly productive in favourable seasons. In Inveraven proper, the loam 
is more gravelly than in Glenlivet ; but still, as well as the haugh 
land along the sides of the rivers, of a kindly nature, and in general 
yielding good crops ; but a little to the east of the Aven, imme- 
diately south of the toll-road, the sub-soil is so retentive, that all 
the efforts of the late and present proprietor, which have not been 
few, have hitherto been unable to render productive such parts of 
the district as have been brought into cultivation. The new sys- 
tem of lineal drains at short distances, as yet scarcely known in 
this quarter, has lately been tried on one of the fields, which, it is 
hoped, will be attended with better success, and so give encourage- 
ment to the cultivation and farther improvement of a district no 
less offensive to the eye of the traveller than it is unproductive in 
itself, and unprofitable both to the proprietor and other occupants. 

Zoology. — This parish abounds in game. Partridges, moorfowl, 
and common hares are very numerous, and white hares by no 
means uncommon. Ptarmigan are to be met with on the moun- 
tains and in Inveraven proper, where there is also black game. 
An attempt has been made, but not as yet apparently with much suc- 
cess, to introduce pheasants. Roe are numerous about Ballindalloch 
and in the lower part of the parish, while to the upper districts, red 
deer occasionally stray from the forest of Glenfiddich, which, how- 
ever, soon find their way back, or pay the forfeit of their temerity 
with their lives. Foxes, weasels, and polecats are common. The 
first are of a large size, and very destructive, as well as dogs, to 
the lambs on the hills. Formerly, the eagle seems to have 
bred near the top of Benrinnes, where the remains of a nest are 
still to be seen ; but this prince of the feathered tribe has long 
since deserted the lower district, and is only to be seen in the 
upper districts of the parish when occasionally extending his 
flight beyond his favourite domains, of which the lofty Ben- 
macdui and far-famed Cairngorum are the almost impregnable ci- 
tadels. Rooks with pure white wings have been observed, and in 
the near neighbourhood but upon the opposite side of the Spey, 
in that part of the Ballindalloch estate which lies in the parish of 
Knockando, a covey of red grouse were seen, some years ago,

three of them with white wings, of which a male and female were 
shot, that presented a very singular appearance. Previous to the 
great flood of i829, which proved so destructive there and through- 
out this parish, chaffinches and house-sparrows were very numerous 
about Ballindalloch ; but of the former, though almost as numerous 
as ever, few were to be seen for a year after, and not a single in- 
dividual of the latter has yet made its appearance. 

Wood and Plantations. — Inveraven proper is studded in almost 
all directions with plantations, which, with the natural wood, con- 
sisting chiefly of birch, oak, and mountain-ash, lining the banks of 
the Spey and the Avon, afford shelter, and are very ornamental ; 
but with the exception of some stunted birches and alders, chiefly 
in the valley of the Livet, and some fruit, forest, and ornamental 
trees in the gardens and around the residences of some of the prin- 
cipal inhabitants, Glenlivet, including Morange and the Braes, is 
utterly destitute of wood. A clump of venerable firs, one of them 
measuring eleven feet in circumference at eleven feet from the 
ground, and supposed to contain 212 cubic feet of timber, height- 
ens the natural beauty of the ancient place of Kilmaichlie, which, 
with the old widow lady who inhabited it, and some of her domes- 
tics, is so interestingly described in the 87th No. of the Lounger 
by the graphic pen of the Man of Feeling. At Ballindalloch, and 
almost so near as to cast their shadows on the house, stand two 
splendid specimens of spruce fir, one measuring in circumference 
fifteen feet at the base, and nine feet nine inches at six feet from 
the ground, and the other, eleven and a-half feet at the base, and 
nine feet at six feet from the ground, both apparently healthy, and 
perfectly free from the aphis, to which other three of similar di- 
mensions, which stood close by, fell martyrs some years ago. On 
the lawn, there are also to be seen a number of very fine old hard 
wood trees, among which is an ash with thirty-five feet of clear 
stem, measuring in circumference fourteen feet at the base, and 
nine feet at sixteen feet from the ground ; and to the west of the 
house, within a few yards of the Aven, a magnificent Scotch fir, 
measuring ten feet in circumference at twelve feet from the ground. 
A considerable quantity of Scotch fir is nearly full grown on both 
sides of the Aven, which afford roofing, deals, planks, &amp;c. for coun- 
try purposes, — while the younger plantations, both of hard wood 
and larch, and Scotch fir, are of great promise, and such as to 
give every encouragement to their further extension. Some of the 
foreign species of pine, such as Pinus cymbra Pinus maritima 

BANFF. I '

BANFFSHIRE. 



&amp;c. raised from seed procured from abroad, have been introduced 
into the moor plantations on the Ballindalloch estate, which are 
also doing well. The whole wood on that property within the pa- 
rish may be estimated at from 1100 to 1200 acres, of which 800 
are planted, and from 300 to 400 natural. The only other plan- 
tation in the parish is a thriving one, also of Scotch fir and larch, 
on the small estate of Colquoich. 

II. — Civil History. 

Historical Events. — The battle of Altachoylachan or Glenlivet, 
the most important historical event connected with this parish, has 
already been so frequently described in other publications, as to re- 
quire but a very cursory notice in this place. This battle, in which 
the Earl of Huntly defeated the Marquis of Argyle, was fought on 
the 4th of October 1594, upon an inclined plain near the Glen- 
rinnes border of the parish, terminating in a flat ridge, which de- 
scends rapidly to the burn of Altachoylachan, and flanked on the 
south by a somewhat precipitous shoulder of the contiguous moun- 
tain. Here, on ground equally adapted for withstanding his op- 
ponent, and for affording a safe retreat in the event of defeat, Ar- 
gyle, who, it is allowed on all hands, had numbers on his side, wait- 
ed the attack. His right, commanded by Sir John M'Lean, oc- 
cupied the shoulder of the mountain, above alluded to, and fought 
manfully — but treachery in the centre and left powerfully aided 
his opponent, who had also the advantage of some pieces of artil- 
lery. Besides M'Neil of Barra, Campbell of Lochnell, Argyle's 
nearest heir, and his brother, to whom some also add Sir John 
M'Lean, about 500 were slain on the side of Argyle. On Hunt- 
ly's. Sir Patrick Gordon of Auchindown, Gordon of Gight, and 
twelve others were killed, and a much greater number wounded, 
among whom was the Earl of Errol. About three-quarters of a 
mile from the scene of action, a small knoll on the east bank of 
the stream Coulalt, commonly called Lord Auchindown's cairn, 
two-thirds of it swept away by the flood of 1829, marks the place 
where Sir P. Gordon of Auchindown is supposed to have died. 

Somewhat more than a century subsequent to this battle, this 
and the adjoining parishes found a troublesome neighbour in James 
Grant, commonly called James an Tuim, as may be, seen by 
reference to the History of the Troubles and Memorable Trans- 
actions in Scotland in the Reign of Charles I., published by John 

• See Sir R. Gordon's History of the Gordons, also Shaw's History of Moray, and 
frown's History of Highlands. 



INVERAVEN. 131 

Spalding, commissary clerk of Aberdeen, who, among other parti- 
culars, gives an account of the treacherous abduction by this bar- 
barian, of the young laird of Ballindalloch, during what he expect- 
ed to be a friendly meeting, — whom he confined at Bauds, in the 
parish of Speymouth, exposed to the greatest hardships, for the 
space of twenty-one days; whence he at length escaped, in the ab- 
sence of James an Tuim, by having gained over Leonard Leslie, one 
of his guards, with whom he conversed in Latin.  

Eminent Men. — Several of the lairds of Ballindalloch, in suc- 
cession, followed the military profession, and almost all of them 
rose to the rank of field officers. Colonel William Grant of Bal- 
lindalloch raised one of the five companies that constituted the 
Black Watch, afterwards embodied into the 42d Regiment. But 
the most eminent was General James Grant of Ballindalloch, who 
succeeded to the estate on the death of his nephew. Major Wil- 
liam Grant, in 1770. General Grant passed the greater part of 
his life in active service. He defeated Count D'Estaing, with an 
inferior force, conquered St Lucia in 1779, and was for many years 
Governor of Florida. At the time of his death, which happened 
at Ballindalloch in 1806, he was Colonel of the 1 1th Foot, and Go- 
vernor of Stirling Castle. In terms of instructions left by himself, 
his remains were interred in the corner of a field on the Mains farm, a 
favourite spot with him in his lifetime, which commands a view of 
the valley of the Spey, and of the barony of Ballindalloch, where 
a mausoleum has been erected by his successor, terminating in a 
handsome pillar, in which is inserted a marble slab, bearing a La- 
tin inscription descriptive of his rank and appointments, as well as 
of the time of his birth and death. The sloping ground to the 
north and west of this field is now covered with a thriving planta- 
tion, which adds not a little to its natural beauty. 

• The effects of James' treachery and cruelty, it would appear, were not confined 
to the lower district of the parish and its inhabitants. Tradition relates, that while 
in confinement in Edinburgh Castle, observing Grant of Tomnavoulen pass one day, 
he called out, what news from Speyside  None very pai ticular, rejoined his acquaint- 
ance, the best is, that the countrv is rid of 3'ou. Perhaps we shall meet again, repli- 
ed James. Tomnavoulen passed on, and James was left for the time to his medita- 
tions in jail, but m the end made his word good. Having escaped by means of ropes, 
conveyed to him by his wife, in a cask supposed to contain butter, he called on his re- 
turn to Speyside, at the house of Tomnavoulen in an evening, where he was invited 
to pass the night. The invitation being declined, Tomnavoulen and his son were 
asked in return to accompany him a little on his way. All three set out in company, 
apparently on the most friendly terms ; butthev had not gone far, when the barbarian 
drew his sword, slew both the father and son, and having cut off their heads, wrapped 
theni in a corner of his plaid, returned to Tomnavoulen, threw them reeking with 
blood into the lap of Mrs Grant, and then bade her good night.

The father of Sir James McGregor, Bart, who has so long and 
soably presided over the medical department of the British Army, 
held the farm of Lynebeg in Glenlivet, and it is said that Sir James 
himself was born there. 

Land-oicners. — Within the last two centuries, the greater .part 
if not the whole property of this parish seems to have gone into 
new hands. About 200 years ago, the Grants were proprietors of 
Blairfindy ; the Stewarts, of Drumin and Kilmaichlie ; and a family 
of the name of Nairn, of Moranges, — while a different branch of the 
Grants, commonly called the Craig- Achrochcan Grants, held Bal- 
lindalloch. Now the whole parish belongs to two large and one small 
heritor. All the Gordon estate in this parish, which comprehends 
the whole country of Glenlivet, with the exception of that part 
called Morange, having with Glenfiddich, &amp;c. in Mortlach and 
Kinrara in Badenoch, been excambed for the estate of Durris in 
Kincardineshire, the Duchess- Dowager of Richmond, on the death 
of her brother, George last Duke of Gordon succeeded to these 
estates, as heiress of entail to the Earl of Peterborough, and so 
became principal heritor of this parish. George M'Pherson Grant, 
Esq. who sat in Parliament for the county of Sutherland, for about

Parochial Registers, — There are three volumes of parish regis- 
ters, the oldest commencing 1630; but all have been imperfect- 
ly kept. Few of the Roman Catholics seem to have inserted their 
children's births at any time ; and now, scarcely any ; and until of 
late the Protestants were too negligent in recording theirs. Since 
1640, no notice appears to be taken of burials. 

Antiquities. — Rude stone coffins have occasionally been disco- 
vered in the parish, under cairns removed to make way for the 
plough ; and in trenching a wood on the farm of Kilmaichlie, the 
labourers found some old arms and coins, the former so corroded

as to be unworthy of preservation, the latter said to have been of 
the size of half-crowns, but which, having been privately sold to a 
silversmith, who has left the country, cannot now be particularly 
described. Numerous traces of Druidical temples are to be found, 
succeeded by almost an equal number of chapels and Christian 
places of worship, of which there were one at Phona, at Nevie, 
Deskie, and Chapelton of Kilmaichlie ; but no traces now remain 
of any of them except the latter, the outlines of which are still 
visible, with some appearances of graves close by. The burial 
ground of Downan is still used, and occasionally also that of Buit- 
terlach ; in the near neighbourhood of which, there is a very large 
cairn, supposed to be raised over the grave of a person of note. 
A small spot, in a field on the farm of Haughs of Kilmaichlie, 
appears clearly to have been also a place of sepulture. In order 
to protect it from the sacrilegious invasion of the plough, the pre- 
sent occupant of the farm has, with proper taste and feeling, caus- 
ed it to be planted. At Blairfindy, are to be seen the ruins of a 
hunting seat of the Earls of Huntly ; and at Drumin, on a high 
promontory near the confluence of the Livet with the Avon, stands 
part of the old castle of Drumin, now affording shelter only to 
jackdaws and pigeons. The wall, which is of great height and 
thickness, is pretty entire on the east and north, and half of the 
west side ; but the other half of the west and the whole south wall 
are gone, and the stability of a considerable part of what remains of 
the structure seems to rest on a single stone of a few inches in 
diameter, placed in a curious position on its edge, and not on what 
builders call the bed. 

The house of Ballindalloch, the residence of the proprietor, 
and, it is said, one of the most perfect specimens extant of the 
old Scottish castle, may also be classed among the antiquities 
of the parish. This large structure consists of a square build- 
ing flanked by three circular towers, — the centre one, which is 
the largest, containing the ancient door and turnpike stair, sur- 
mounted by a square watch-tower termed the " Cape House," 
with a window to each of the four sides, and an aperture in the 
wall immediately above the entrance, so as to admit of boiling lead 
or other missiles being thrown down, in the event of the enemy 
making good his approach. Over the chimney, in one of the rooms, 
IS carved 1546. The Cape House seems to have been added by Pa- 
trick Grant in 1602, and about the beginning of last century a fur 
ther addition was made of two large and commodious wings. This mas-

sy and irregular-looking structure is situated a little to the east of 
the Aven, and about half-a-mile from its confluence with the Spey, 
upon a low flat haugh of a triangular shape richly wooded, having 
Cairnocay in the distance on the south, the Aven, clear as crystal, 
and lined with wood, on the west, the Spey hemmed in by moun- 
tains on the north, and on the east a magnificent bank embracing 
Craig- Achrochcan covered with wood of many varieties, producing 
altogether a scene not often to be surpassed even in the Highlands. 
A little farther up the river, upon the edge of the high ground, 
and near a small stream called the Castle stripe, are to be seen the 
traces of a large building said to have been the old castle or man- 
sion-house of Ballindalloch, where tradition says it would have 
still stood, had not the rebuilding been prevented by unseen agency, 
— the part built in the day-time having been always thrown down 
through the night : at length a voice was heard saying, " build in the 
Cow Haugh, and you shall meet with no interruption." The re- 
commendation was followed, and the house of Ballindalloch conse- 
quently raised in its present situation, where it has long stood un- 
assailed by the invisible adversary of its predecessor, but exposed 
by times to a real and little less formidable one, the Aven. The 
most recent as well as the most destructive visit it received from 
this neighbour, happened at the great flood of 1829. 

HI. — Population.

" To remedy the desolation occasioned at Ballindalloch by this flood, the aspect of 
which was truly appalling, appeared almost a hopeless task ; nevertheless the attempt 
was made without delay, and with entire success, the place having some years ago as- 
sumed its wonted attractive appearance, and even become, in the opinion of many, 
prettier than before. Some old trees are indeed awanting, and a field or two may be 
deteriorated or circumscribed ; still other trees have been planted, pits have been filled 
up, roots and stumps of trees and gravel cleared, the garden, which till then was close 
to the house, moved to a suitable distance, the lawn levelled, trenched, and laid out 
anew ; and in addition to all this, and at an expense little less than that of all the other 
operations together, an embankment has been raised along the Aven, from its junction 
with the Spey to the rocks at the upper end of the lawn, a distance of about 1500 
yards, faced with stones keyed, that is, neatly set in after the end or edge to the level 
of the field, and then raised three or four feet with earth, partly turfed, and partly 
made green by grass grown from the seed. Great attention is bestowed, after floods, 
in examining this beautiful and substantial embankment, and in repairing breaches, 
which seldom, if ever, occur except by the falling of the river to a lower level. For 
this purpose, baskets made of rough planks or split trees nailed together in the shape 
of a parallelogram, and filled with large stones, have been of great use. A line of these 
baskets or creels, as they are called, has been found more effectual in opposing the 
river than any other obstacle hitherto employed ; and by their aid, the embankment 
has, without the smallest apparent diminution of its strength or neatness, been under- 
founded for a long way, part of it to the depth of nearly six feet, so as to suit the bed 
tf the river, which is deepened here and there by almost every flowl.

From the above table it will be seen that the population, which seems 
to have fallen off for ten years subsequent to Dr Webster's report, 
has since been gradually increasing, — the most marked increase 
being within the last few years ; in the course of which, the habits 
of the people have undergone a great change to the better. Pre- 
vious to the passing of the Act of Parliament, in 1823, for the en- 
couragement of legal distillation in the Highlands of Scotland, the 
inhabitants of Glenlivet almost without an exception, and many 
also in the parish church district, were more or less engaged in 
manufacturing and carrying to market smuggled whisky ; but the 
energetic measures taken by Government for the suppression of 
smuggling have proved eminently successful here ; the male po- 
pulation, instead of prowling over the country in search of a mar- 
ket for their whisky, and being constantly on the watch to elude 
the eye of officers of excise, are now happily and successfully em- 
ployed in the cultivation of farms, or in prosecuting handicrafts ; 
— while the females, who were in the habit of spending no small 
portion of their time, by night as well as by day, in the bothie, — 
a prey to the licentious and immoral, — are now more safely and 
suitably employed in domestic occupations, or in performing such 
portions of field labour as fall to the lot of their sex, in the best 
cultivated and most civilized districts of the country. 

There is only one family of independent fortune which lives in 
the parish, and that only for half the year. Some have large hold- 
ings, and most are in easy circumstances for their station in hfe. 
Cottars, that is, subtenants who hold houses and kail-yards from 
the principal tenant, are sometimes thickly set down ; but there 
is no village within the parish. The great bulk of the population 
are engaged in agricultural pursuits, though there is a due propor- 
tion of tradesmen to supply the wants of a rural district. Towards 
the borders of Kirkmichael and Cromdale, Gaehc is spoken by a 
few ; but it is fast dying out, and the number who either speak or 
understand it, is becoming smaller every year. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — Of late, the agriculture of this parish has made 
rapid progress. Some time ago, black oats, a species of grain now 
scarcely to be seen, were very common. Then, the aid of lime 
was rarely sought, and, except at Ballindalloch and a few other 
places, two-horse ploughs and improved implements of husbandry 



13G 



BANFFSHIRE. 



were not used ; but now, these and the best system of farming have 
found their way to all quarters. Not only is the old arable land, 
in consequence, in general well farmed, but a great extent of waste 
land has been brought into cultivation. On the Ballindalloch es- 
tate, the proprietor is usually at the expense of main drains when 
required, or allows for land improved L. 5 per acre to the tenant, 
who is thus enabled to purchase lime, on his agreeing to pay inte- 
rest at 5 per cent, during the lease; and it is an injudicious im- 
provement which does not in this way turn out advantageous both 
to landlord and tenant. But, notwithstanding such encouragement, 
the progress of improvement is much retarded in the parish church 
district, by the quantities of stones, either partly above or imme- 
diately under the surface, which create an expense in the removal, 
in general much greater than that of trenching. But in Glenli- 
vet, where there are comparatively few stones, the reclaiming of 
waste land is going on at a rapid rate, being on an average, on 
the Gordon estate alone, at the rate of 100 acres annuallv, or 
about 2000, in the course of the nineteen years' lease. Few of the 
farmers keep more than two or three horses in the low end of the 
parish ; but in Glenlivet there are some very extensive farms ; — and 
on them, the system of cropping and manuring the fields, and the 
general mode of management, can scarcely be surpassed. The 
example of these more skilful and opulent tenants being readily imi- 
tated in the neighbourhood, the advantage of liming and proper ro- 
tation is now universally felt: and consequently, good farming may 
be seen throughout the parish, with very few exceptions, not only 
on every farm but on every croft. 

Bent of Land. — The number of acres arable on the Gordon es- 
tate, and their average rent, cannot at present be stated. Ballin- 
dalloch estate, 2200 acres, average rent about L. 1 per acre. Cul- 
quoich do., about 70 acres, average rent about L. 1 per acre. 

Oats constitute the staple grain of the country, — the most com- 
mon being of the early Angus, and sundry varieties. Barley or Scots 
bear is usually sown after green crop. Very little wheat is raised ; 
but, even in the low end of Glenlivet, it grows of excellent quality 
in favourable seasons, and has been known to weigh 55 lb. per 
bushel. 

Stock. — Though none of the Clydesdale breed have found 
their way to the parish, many of the horses are strong and ac- 
tive, and in general better adapted than those of a larger size, to 
the nature of the country, the state of the roads, the quality of 

4 



INVERAVEN. 



13T 



their food, and the quantity of work for which they are intend- 
ed. 

The black-cattle of the more wealthy have a considerable dash 
of West Highland blood, and are in general handsome and well 
kept. At Ballindalloch, those bred are a cross betwixt Buchan 
cows and a Highland bull, which produces large fine animals; the 
three year old stots, when in good driving condition, having of late 
sold, in the month of July, for three years running, at L. 13 each. 

But the black-cattle in general throughout the parish, bred with- 
out much attention to the selection either of bulls or cows, and kept 
in numbers quite disproportioned to the food, which is often un- 
palatable as well as scanty, are equally destitute of symmetry, of 
size, and of flesh. With the view of improving this species of stock 
in this and some neighbouring parishes, the Highland and Agri- 
cultural Society now off'ers premiums; but until the number of 
cattle is better proportioned to the quantity of the food, and the 
smaller farmers begin in consequence to feel an improvement in 
their growth and prices, neither premiums nor any thing else will 
be found to remedy the evil. 

This parish, notwithstanding the range of mountain and ex- 
tent of waste ground, is not much adapted for sheep-farming. 
With the exception of a few of English extraction, kept on infield, the 
sheep are mostly of the black-faced breed, and in general stunted in 
their growth. Deriving their food chiefly from the hills which are 
attached to the farms, in general in undivided common, they soon 
deteriorate, when imported from other quarters; and hence the 
more judicious and wealthy farmers have, almost without excep- 
tion, given over keeping this description of stock. 

Farm Buildings.— Though there is abundance of room for im- 
provement, both in respect to arrangement and construction in the 
farm-steadings, yet this parish does not seem to be, in this respect, 
behind any in the neighbourhood. Many excellent slated dwel- 
ling-houses two stories high, are to be seen in Glenlivet with good 
out-houses. Those at Wester Deskie, which are very extensive, 
are the admiration of strangers, who in general go to the district, 
expecting to see little else than bothies,— amd would attract atten- 
tion in any part of the country. 

Mamffactures.— Instead of the smuggling house, formerly to 
be found on almost every streamlet, besides one in progress of 
erection, there are two legal distilleries in Glenlivet, where whisky 
IS produced of the very best quality, and always commanding a 



138 



BANFFSHIRE. 



great demand and high price; — one at Aucherachan, about the 
centre of the glen, as lately enlarged, gives employment to four men, 
consumes weekly about 160 bushels of malt made from bear, which 
yields 300 gallons of spirits, and about L. 45 of duties. The other 
is at upper Drumin, nearer the Aven. The proprietor of the former 
has also a distillery in Buchan ; but he finds, after the most careful 
and repeated trials, that, with the same hands and materials, he can- 
not produce a spirit equal to what he obtains in Glenlivet. For the 
latter, of which he never knows what it is to have a stock, there is 
a demand to all quarters of the world — its fame as well as quality 
being equal to that of any smuggled whisky. The chief market, 
however, is among private families, though even spirit-dealers rea- 
dily allow 6d. per gallon more than for the whisky distilled in 
Buchan. 

There are in the parish, 5 meal, 2 barley, 1 lint, I saw, and 2 
carding or wool mills, — but no public kiln, the grain being usually 
dried on the owner's or a neighbour's kiln. The other manufac- 
tures of the parish scarcely deserve notice, being chiefly confined 
to woollen cloths and plaidings made by the small farmers who 
keep sheep. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-towns. — Tomantoul and Charleston of Aberlour, both 
market villages, lie at the distance of about three miles, the former 
from the upper, and the latter from the lower end of the parish. 
Grantown and Dufftown are also within reach of many of the inha- 
bitants ; but the nearest market-towns of any note are Elgin, to 
which there are two carriers who go weekly, and Keith. The dis- 
tance to each of these places from the church is about twenty 
miles ; but a considerable proportion of the supplies of the lower 
district and of almost the whole of Glenlivet comes from Aberdeen, 
with which there is constant intercourse, by means of carriers resi- 
dent in Keith and in the parish, who bring out groceries, cloths, 
hardwares, &amp;c. &amp;c. partly for private families, and partly to be sold 
by the merchants of the parish, who are to be found in all quar- 
ters, and who take back, in return, cheese, butter, eggs, &amp;c. 

Roads. — The parish is crossed, in the lower end, by four miles of 
toll-road, which is too steep at both extremities, continued from the 
bridge of Aven by about two miles of Parliamentary road, which is 
steep also, but always kept in excellent repair. And in Glenlivet, it is 
crossed by a tolerable county road leading from Dufftown to Tamin- 
toul. The two principal heritors joined, some years ago, in making 



INVERAVEN. 



139 



a good road, each carrying it on, upon his own property, — lead- 
ing by the east side of Aven to Glenlivet and Kirkmichael, which 
has proved of the utmost advantage in opening up the communica- 
tion with these places. There are also a pretty good road, some 
miles up the Aven on the west side, and a couple of similar branch 
ones from the toll-road towards the Spey ; but, with the exception 
of the approaches to Ballindalloch and the church, there is scarce- 
ly another mile of good or even passable road in the parish. 

Bridges, Src. — The number of bridges in the parish is but small, 
compared to its extent and its wants. The old one over the Livet 
at upper Downan, mentioned in the former report, having been al- 
most destroyed by the flood of 1829, a fine new arch was built, last 
year, on a more eligible site some hundred yards farther down the 
stream ; and the one at Tomnavoulen, about three miles higher up, 
which was also so much destroyed by the flood of 1829 as to be of 
no use except for foot-passengers, has recently undergone repair. 
On the Ballindalloch portion of the new Avenside road, there is a 
very handsome arch over the rapid burn of Tommore. The only 
other bridge of any consequence, is that at Craig- Achrochcan over 
the Aven, mentioned in the former report. Neither of the two latter 
received any injury from the great floods of 1829. On the Spey, 
there is no bridge on either hand, nearer than those at Grantown and 
Craigellachie, which are about twenty-four miles asunder ; nor is 
there any good ford either in this or the neighbouring parish of 
Knockando, the best being that at Balnellan, which is very deep. 
Besides several private, there are two public boats, — one at Blacks- 
boat, and the other at Balnellan, immediately above the mouth of 
the Aven. 

No public coaches pass through, or are in any way connected 
with the parish. One was tried some years ago, from Keith to Gran- 
town, but it did not succeed. The mails are carried daily from 
Keith and Craigellachie to Bridge of Aven, where there is a re- 
gular post-office, called Ballindalloch, with a subsidiary one at 
Drumin ; from whence, there is a runner three times a week to To- 
mintoul. Letters to Grantown are sent by Keith, where they lie 
from ten to twelve hours, and are carried upwards of seventy miles, 
to save the paltry expense of a direct post for fourteen miles. 

EcclesiasticalStaie.— Fveyious to the Reformation, Inveraven was 
a parsonage dedicated to St Peter, and the seat of the Chancellor 
of the diocese, having the vicarages of Knockando and Urquhart

in Inverness-shire dependent on it. The church, which was built 
in 1806, is in good repair, but very inconveniently situated on the 
Spey boundaries of the parish. Intended for the accommodation 
of the Protestants in Glenlivet, as well as the ordinary congrega- 
tion at the communion, it is seated for 550, and may contain about 
600, being only about 150 less than the whole population of the 
parish church district. A good many seats being in consequence 
empty, on ordinary occasions, strangers may be led to suppose that 
the people frequent other places of worship ; but this is by no 
means the case, there being scarcely ten in the lower district who 
are not in the habit of attending the parish church. There is 
no chapel of ease in the parish, but a mission on the Royal boun- 
ty has been in operation in Glenlivet for upwards of 100 years. 
At Achbreck, a distance of about nine miles, there is a substantial 
but rather confined chapel, rebuilt in 1 825, at the joint expense 
of the heritors and the people, where the missionary usually 
preaches ; but once in six weeks, he goes to Achnara, in the Braes, 
to officiate on Sundays. In the parish church, the seats which are 
undivided, are all free. In the chapel at Achbreck, a very few seats 
are let, by such as have more room than their families require ; but 
the great proportion there are free also. In accordance with the 
practice in the presbytery, the people in the church district and 
the Protestants in Glenlivet, are cathechised twice a year — once in 
summer, preparatory to the communion, and again in autumn or 
spring. At the parish church, there are 237 communicants, at 
Achbreck also 237. Since the grant was obtained, for dispensing 
the sacrament of the Lord's supper at Achbreck, the Protestants in 
Glenlivet have given up attending that ordinance in the parish 
church. 

In Glenlivet, where about three-fifths of the people are of the 
Roman Catholic persuasion, there are two Roman Catholic cha- 
pels, — the one at Tombia, pretty far up the glen, — the other at 
Chapelton, in the Braes of Glenlivet. The former is a large 
building capable of containing from 800 to 1000 persons, — but on- 
ly partly finished : the latter contains about 300. 

The manse, which was built in 1775, received a handsome and 
commodious addition in 1834, and is now one of the best in the 
country. It is situated within a few yards of the church. The 
glebe consists of only about 4 acres of arable land, and pasture 
grass scarcely sufficient for the summer keep of one cow. The sti-

141 



pend was modified in 1821 at 15 chalders ; and there are still about 
L. 100 Sterling of free teind. 

The itinerant preacher in Glenlivet has L. 60 a-year, and L. 3 for 
furnishing communion elements ; and, besides an allowance for 
peats, he has a small farm on the Gordon estate, rent free, in lieu of 
a croft, with the privilege of a range of hill pasture for sheep. 

TheRoman CathoHc priests are chiefly supported by their hear- 
ers ; both possess farms at moderate rents, and the one officiating at 
Chapelton has L. 20 a-year, from funds provided by the Abb6 
M'Pherson. Bishop Kyle, who resides at Pressholm, in the parish 
of Rathven, is the Roman Catholic bishop of the district. 

Schools. — The only school in the church district, is the parish 
school, where the average attendance of scholars is, in summer, 44, 
and in winter, 53. In Glenlivet, there are 4 Protestant schools ; 3 
of them male and one female ; and 3 Roman Catholic schools, 1 male 
and 2 female. The Roman Catholic seminary or college there, men- 
tioned in the former report, was moved in 1799 to Achertes, near 
Aberdeen. Of the male Protestant teachers, one has a salary from the 
Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge, another from the Ge- 
neral Assembly's Committee for Highland Schools, and the third a 
small one of L. 5 from the Gordon estate, — and from the same quar- 
ter the Protestant female teacher has L. 5 a-year, in addition to a 
similarsum allowed by the Society for Propagating Christian Know- 
ledge. The Roman Catholic male, and one of the female teachers 
have each L. 10 a-year from funds provided by the Abbe M'Pherson; 
the other has also a small salary. The General Assembly's and So- 
ciety's teachers have houses and gardens ; and, with the exception of 
the female one, are also provided with peats, by the inhabitants of the 
district in which they labour, or are allowed an equivalent. The paro- 
chial schoolmaster has a good house and garden, and besides his 
fees, which may average about L. 11 a year, and the emoluments 
of the session clerkship, he has a salary of L. 28, 17s. 5d., and a 
share of the Dick bequest. 

Some few parishioners may still be found who are unable to 
read and write, but their number is gradually decreasing. The 
schools are well attended, and the people are fully alive to the be- 
nefits of education, and ready to avail themselves of the means of 
It, which are now fortunately within their reach : only a female 
school is much wanted in the parish church district. At the Pro- 
testant schools in Glenlivet, a number of Roman children are in at- 
tendance who read the Bible, and are engaged promiscuously with 



142 



BANFFSHIRE. 



the Protestant children in all the other exercises of the school, with 
the exception of committing to memory the Assembly's Shorter 
Catechism and the Protestant version of the Psalms. 

Poor, — The Protestant poor manifest no undue desire to become 
a burden on the funds ; nor do they consider it a degradation to 
receive aid from them, when standing in need of it. The number 
on the roll is 40, and each, on the average for the year, receives in 
quarterly instalments about 17s. The fund for their relief which 
received an accession some years ago by a bequest of L. 50, made 
by Sir William Grant of Bildornie, who for many years held the 
high appointment of Master of the Rolls, arises chiefly from col- 
lections at the church and Protestant chapel, and the interest of a 
small sum laid out at interest. The Roman Catholic poor, who only 
receive a share of any extraordinary gift to the funds of the parish, 
may be said to be supported by those of their own persuasion, who 
make collections for them at their chapels. 

Fairs. — There are four fairs held within the parish, a little to 
the east of the church, in the course of the year, for the sale of 
cattle, horses, grain, &amp;c. and where engagements are entered into 
betwixt the farmers and their servants, for the harvest and half year. 

Inns, Sfc. — In the parish church district, there are only two pubhc- 
houses, — one of them an excellent inn. In Glenlivet, there are no 
fewer than nine pubhc-houses, — a number quite disproportioned to 
the district, for which four or five would be quite sufficient. 

Fuel. — Moss, as may naturally be supposed, is to be met with, in 
all parts of the parish. Towards the mountains, it is in gene- 
ral black, and of excellent quality for fuel ; but in the lower and 
river side parts of the country, it is much exhausted, or of such bad 
quality, that some of the more opulent give a preference, except 
for the kitchen, to English coals driven from Garmouth, a distance 
to some of more than thirty miles. 

General Observations. 
The parish, within the last forty years, has undergone a very 
great change, in respect to the improving and planting of waste 
ground, and the state of roads, bridges, agriculture and buildings; 
but, by far the most important change is that which has taken place 
in the habits of the people, since the suppression of smuggling. The 
improvements which seem, at present, to be most wanted, are bet-

the Tervay, Crombie, and smaller streams ; cross roads in all di- 
rections, and a main one from Tomnavoulen to Achnara, round the 
country called Braes of Glenlivet, which is utterly destitute of roads, 
with a branch from Tomalinan to Tamintoul, and another, if practi- 
cable, to Glenbucketor Strathdon, — the present thoroughfare to the 
latter being only a pass so steep as to have obtained the very ap- 
propriate name of the Ladder. The much-talked-of line of road 
which is nearly complete in this parish from Perth to Elgin and 
Forres, with a bridge over the Spey at Tomdow, would also be 
highly beneficial to the parish. But the improvement which, above 
all others, is most to be desired, is the erection of a parish in the 
country of Glenlivet, which would be felt as a mighty boon by the 
Protestants, and which could not fail to be of great benefit to all 
the people. The conflicting nature of religious profession there 
is an evil whose consequences are deeply felt; and dram-drink- 
ing and illegitimate births, though both considerably on the decrease, 
are still too frequent. Yet, with the machinery of a parish under 
the guidance of a faithful and judicious clergyman, in the full en- 
joyment of the status and emoluments of a parish minister, — it 
might be hoped that, under the Divine blessing, the whole inhabi- 
tants of Glenlivet, disposed as they are, readily to avail themselves, 
of the means of religious and moral instruction, which they enjoy, 
would gradually be improved ; and that this beautiful and sequester- 
ed country would ere long become, what nature seems to have in- 
tended it to be, the enviable abode of religion, of happiness, and 
of virtue.

PRESBYTERY OF TURRIFF, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. ANDREW TODD, MINISTER. 

I._Topo GRAPHY AND NaTURAL HiSTORY. 

Name Extent, Boundaries. — Alvah and the adjoining parish 
of Forglen were originally united ; but before the middle of the 
seventeenth century, they were erected into separate parishes. In 
the most ancient manuscripts and printed records connected with 
the parish, the name, Alvah, is found to occur with the varied or- 
thographies, Jlveth, Alvethe, Jlvecht, Jlvechte, Alvach, AUwach 
Alwach and Avouch ; but, after the most diligent inquiry, the 
writer has been unable to form any probable conjecture in regard 
to its etymological meaning. The parish extends in length about 6 
English miles ; and at its greatest breadth, to nearly the same dis- 
tance ; but in some places, to little more than two. In Robertson's 
map of the counties of Aberdeen, Banff, and Kincardine, published 
in 1822, the superficial extent of the parish is estimated at 11,282 
imperial acres, or 17| square miles; but, according to the most 
accurate information which the writer could obtain, the superficial 
extent is only 1 1,133 imperial acres, being 149 acres under the ex- 
tent given in the map. On the north and north-west, Alvah is 
bounded by the parish of Banff ; on the south-west, by Marnoch ; 
on the south, by Forglen ; on the south-east, by Turriff; and on 
the east and north-east by King-Edward and Gamrie. 

TopograjMcal Appearances.~The highest elevations in the pa- 
rish are the hill of Alvah and the hill of Maunderlea. The for- 
mer, according to Robertson's map, rises, near the northern extre- 
mity, to the height of 578 feet above the level of the sea, while the 
latter, situated on the confines of the parish, nearly four miles 
south-west of the former, has on the same authority, 155 feet of 
superior elevation. Both hills are rather steep towards the north, 
but of more easy asxent on the sides more distant from the sea. 



ALVAH.

The hill of Alvah stands apart from any other considerable or 
immediate elevation ; but the hill of Maunderlea, proceeding in a 
northerly direction from the parish of Marnoch, is connected with 
a series of minor elevations, which are scattered over the western 
and south-western division of the parish, and which give to this dis- 
trict a bleak and hilly appearance, strikingly contrasted with the 
woodland scenery which adorns the sloping sides of the hill of Al- 
vah, and the rich and fertile lands which encircle its base. From 
the summit of this latter hill, the view is extensive, varied, and pic- 
turesque, and on an unclouded evening of summer, cannot be con- 
templated but with the most pleasing emotions. Towards the 
east, as far as the eye can reach, appears a large portion of the 
level, naked, and, comparatively speaking, uninteresting district of 
Buchan, having its otherwise monotonous aspect relieved, how- 
ever by the bold and projecting headlands of Gamrie and Troup, 
which rise in frowning majesty along its shore; on the south is be- 
held the Doveran flowing along between banks of the most fertile 
description, and here and there adorned with gentlemen's seats 
embowered amid thriving plantations,— the well known mountains 
of Bennochie, the Buck of the Cabrach, and further to the south- 
west, Belrinnes, appearing with imposing dignity along the Hue of 
the distant horizon. Looking in the direction of the north, the spec- 
tator beholds spread out, as it were, on a map below him, the pic- 
turesque and highly embellished scenery, amid which stands con- 
spicuous. Duff House, the classical and magnificent mansion of 
theEarlof Fife,— the Doveran winding amid the surrounding woods 
m many a tortuous maze, as if loth to quit so fair a scene, and at 
length flowing into the ocean at Banff", which, together with the 
adjoinmg bay, is from this eminence distinctly visible; while, far in 
the west and north-west, are seen relieved against the evening skv 
the fantastic forms of the Caithness hills, behind which the sun 
IS setting, and is throwing a parting gleam of molten gold across 
the broad bosom of the Moray Frith, the whole of which is stretch- 
ed out before the spectator in mellow and unbroken repose, save 
where here and there is espied the white sail of some distant vessel. 

Ihe ri.er Doveran may be considered as the natural boundary 
ot Alvah on the east, although the estates of Inverichny and Dun- 
ugas are situated on its eastern bank. This river, while within 
the parish of Alvah, flows nearly from south to north, and, includ- 
ing Its numerous and beautiful windings, has a course of more than 
SIX miles m length. Where it enters the parish, it flows between 



146 

BANFFSHIRE. 



the estates of Diinlugas and Montblairy, the proprietors of both 
of winch have elegant mansions on its banks, surrounded with ex- 
tensive and thriving- plantations. Below the estate of Dunlugas, 
on the eastern bank of the river, a part of the parish of King-Ed- 
ward intervenes, and at the distance of a mile and a half farther 
down, lies the estates of Inverichny on the same side. On the 
opposite side, below Montblairy, are situated, in succession, the 
lands of Auchenbadie, Sandlaw, and a small part of the. barony of 
Alvah. Before the Doveran leaves the parish, the scenery on 
either side becomes strikingly bold and picturesque. The ground 
rises to the north, presenting a rocky barrier, as if to intercept the 
progress of the stream. In this barrier, after diverting it from its 
northerly direction for more than a mile, a narrow chasm, as if by 
some great convulsion of nature, has been opened through the 
rocks for the reception of the water. Here the rocky and preci- 
pitous sides of the chasm are joined by a majestic arch,  which 
has more the appearance of a Roman structure than of a work of 
modern times. The chasm immediately under the bridge is only 
27 feet wide, while the depth of the water is 56 feet, and from the 
top of the parapet to the surface of the water, the height is 55 
feet. The scenery at the bridge of Alvahf is much and justly ad- 
mired ; but It is not easy by words to give any precise and accu- 
rate idea of its beauties. Immediately to the north of the bridge, 
the rocks start back, as it were, into a sort of amphitheatre, rising, 
in some places, almost a hundred feet above the water, and clothed, 
fringed, and festooned with the most beautiful and diversified tints, 
arising from the luxuriant intermixture of trees, shrubs, lichens, 
and mosses. The water below is collected into an extensive, deep, 
and dark-looking basin, exhibiting, on ordinary occasions, no ap- 
pearance of life or of motion, save when momentarily agitated by 
the splash of the leaping salmon. Farther north, and yet higher 
up, arises the hill of Montcoffer, stretching away to a great dis- 
tance, clothed to its top with firs, and forming the back-ground of 
the picture. The whole scene is of a solemn and secluded na- 
ture, and the sounds which most frequently break in on its gloomy 
stillness, are the scream of the heron, 'and the hoarse note of the 
raven. Farther down, the stream is again contracted by a suc- 
cession of shaggy rocks and steep wooded banks, between which it

urges its winding way for nearly a mile, when it becomes the east- 
ern boundary  of the parish of Banff, at the distance of about two 
miles from the sea. From the bridge of Alvah, downwards, art has 
everywhere been successfully exerted to add beauty to the gran- 
deur of nature. The summits of the rocks and steep banks of the 
river are clothed with a striking variety of forest trees, either 
tastefully disposed for effect, or studiously adapted to their conge- 
nial soils, while, from the rocky crevices below, springs a rich pro- 
fusion of wild flowers and shrubs, that dip their pensile branches in 
the stream. But this scene, at all times beautiful and romantic, 
assumes only its character of horrible grandeur when the river is 
swollen in a flood. On such an occasion, the narrow chasm at the 
bridge of Alvah, being insufficient to admit the augmented stream, 
the waters are repelled by the opposing crags, and flow backwards 
for nearly two miles along the stream, and, in many places, ex- 
tend for more than a quarter of a mile over the adjacent fields. 
When this mighty lake and the roused-up river, pour their waters 
over the opposing rocks at the entrance of the gorge above the 
bridge, and when the tortured stream is thence thrown down with 
resistless force into the narrow gap beneath the arch, where « it 
boils, and wheels, and foams, and thunders through," a scene i 
presented of such mingled beauty and horror, that, to convey an 
adequate conception of it, might require the combined powers of 
a Claude and a Salvator. 

Hylrocjraph7j.—T\ns parish abounds with perennial springs of the 
purest soft water, and contains also several excellent chalybeate 
The most remarkable fountain of the first class is called Comes well 
—a name which occurs in a charter dated more than 500 years 
ago. This fountain rises on the farm of Tipperty, at the northern 
base of the hill of Alvah, and is as remarkable for its maanitude 
as for the excellence of its water. It throws out twenty-seven im- 
perial gallons in a minute, and when tried by the hydrometer ap 
pears only a shade heavier than water distilled. It has \om been 
envied by the people of Banff", but has never yet been conducted 
thither, although such a scheme has been frequently contemplated. 
Many other fountains, of similar quality, spring from the base of 
the same hill, but none of them rise far up its sides. The tem- 
perature of the numerous springs within the parish ranges from 

 '.f""' the parish is said to extend downwards, alone the cour:P nf •

45° to 46° of Fahrenheit, with the exception of the well at Kem- 
plemire, of which the temperature is as high as 50°. The forma- 
tion of calcareous concretions has been ascribed to drinking from 
this last-mentioned fountain ; but from a recent chemical analysis, 
the water does not appear to be distinguished by any quality pro- 
ductive of such a disorder None of the chalybeates are worthy of 

particular notice, with the exception of the Red Gill well on the 
hill of Brownside, and a spring rising on the Hill-head of Mont- 
blairy. Each of these has been found to hold a greater quantity 
of iron in solution, than either the Red-well in Boyndie, or the well 
of Tarlair in Gamrie. From a qualitative analysis recently ob- 
tained, it appears that the Red Gill well contains a large quantity 
of the protoxide of iron held in solution by excess of carbonic 
acid, with an average quantity of chloride of sodium, carbonate 
and sulphate of lime. The Hill-head spring contains fully as large 
a quantity of iron as the former, held in solution as a protoxide by 
excess of carbonic acid, with rather less carbonate and sulphate of 
lime, but with fully as much salt. The writer has obtained ana- 
lyses of several of the other springs, but the results are marked 'by 
no peculiarity worthy of insertion. The whole of the springs ap- 
pear to arise, in general, between the clay-slate and greywacke, 
which constitute the prevailing rocks within the parish. 

The only river is the Doveran, which has only three tributaries 
of any consequence within the parish. Two of these flow from 
west to east, and join the river at Auchenbadie and Mill of Mont- 
blairy, the other flows from east to west, and joins the river at 
Boat of Ashoagle. The breadth of the Doveran varies from 90 
to 320 feet. 

Geology and Mineralogy.— T\vvs parish presents but few fea- 
tures interesting in a geological point of view. The surface, al- 
though varied and irregular, and raised up into small hills and 
rising grounds, and intersected by hollows and chasms, yet aff'ords 
but an occasional view of the solid strata. In the higher grounds, 
and in those places where the soil has been opened up, and quar- 
ried for building, the solid strata are occasionally discovered, but 
in other places they are covered up by deep diluvial beds, the 
thickness of which it would be difficult to determine. The hol- 
lows, ingeneral, are not traversed by any stream of magnitude 
sufficient to disclose the nature of the adjacent rocks : hence our

report upon this head has been attended with more difficulty than 
was at first anticipated. Enough, however, has been seen to af- 
ford sufficient evidence of the structure and superposition of the 
solid strata. 

The direction of the strata is from north-east to south-west, or 
perhaps, where the strata have been more than usually deranged, 
varying a point or two nearer the south on the one hand, and the 
north on the other; and the dip is to the north-west and south- 
east at right angles to the direction. The eastern side of the pa- 
rish is watered by the river Doveran, the banks of which, and the 
lower grounds, are a deep alluvial loam, resting on a bed of blue 
elay, intermixed with clay-slite, in broken fragments and in a state 
of dissolution. Indeed, it appears to me, that the bed of blue 
clay on which the alluvial and vegetable soils rest, is almost whol- 
ly a formation arising from the disintegration and dissolution of 
the clay-slate on which they are reposing. The vegetable soil on 
the lower grounds of the other parts of the parish is also reposing 
on a bed of diluvial coarse clay, and occasionally intermixed with 
thin veins or beds of ferruginous sand, shingle, and water-worn 
boulders; and on the higher grounds, around the hills of Tipper- 
ty, Alvah, &amp;c. the soil reposes on beds of sand and shingle, inter- 
mixed with fragments of greywacke slate, &amp;c. These are resting, 
throughout the whole parish, on a bed of clay-slate, which again 
is resting on a bed of greywacke, and on which the clay-slate lies 
in a conformable position, and in its lower strata following the 
windings of that mineral, with which, at their junction, the grey- 
wacke passes into greywacke slate, and for some distance alter- 
nates with the clay-slate. The greywacke is intersected with 
thm veins of quartz, the greatest thickness of which may be about 
four or five inches. These veins ramify through the mass, dimi- 
mshmg in size till they totally disappear. The angle of elevation 
of the clay-slate is different at different places, lowards the top 
of the hill of Alvah, the clay-slate is standing almost vertical; but 
on descending the hill the angle diminishes, and in the lower 
grounds, where the strata are less deranged, it is found almost ho- 
rizontal. I cannot, with certainty, determine the existence of any 
fault or dike by which the strata are deranged. The upper bed 
of the hill of Tipperty, toward the base, is clay-slate, but towards 
the top of the hill, coarse mica-slate passing into secondary gneiss 
crops out ; but we are unable to determine the strata on which 
these last repose. 



BANFFSHIRE. 



Rolled blocks were formerly common throughout the parish ; 
but on the surface of the cultivated ground most of them have 
yielded to an improved husbandry long ago. A few blocks of 
greywacke, similar to the rocks in situ, are still to be seen on the 
waste and rising grounds, between the farms of Clayfolds and 
Sandlaw ; and on the hill of Maunderlea, on the south-western 
boundary of the parish, a number of rolled blocks of granite, 
coarse mica-slate, gneiss, quartz, and trap, are still to be seen on 
the surface, and many similar are found deeply imbedded in the 
soil. Various blocks of sandstone are also intermixed, of a coarse 
and hard texture, altogether different from any sandstone rock 
within the county ; but most of those of a larger size have been 
fashioned into rabbets and lintels, or otherwise employed as mate- 
rials for buildinof. 

The existence of flints in Scotland is a recent discovery, the 
chalk formation in which they form a constituent part of the up- 
per beds, being there unknown. Notwithstanding, flints have now 
been found both in this and the neighbouring parishes, which ge- 
ologists have considered to be the true chalk flints. They are 
common on the sea shore, intermixed with the shingle along the 
beach adjacent to Banff", and have also been traced to Gamrie, 
and to the eastward as far as Peterhead. A large deposit of flints 
was first discovered in the hill of Delgaty, imbedded in a sort of 
unctuous clay, intermixed with nodules of quartz and shingle. 
They have also been discovered by Colonel Gordon of Park, in 
the parish of Ordiquhill, and they have been met with in the hill 
of Alvah, and in different other places within the parish. As 
there are no chalk-beds in this country, it appears evident that 
the flints and other debris, dissimilar to the rocks in situ, must 
have been brought there by some mighty inundation from a great 
distance, sweeping off the superior strata from extensive tracts 
which they once covered, and spreading and throwing them toge- 
ther in indiscriminate masses at great distances from the range, 
with which they have every appearance of having been once con- 
nected. To this great cause we cannot help assigning the great 
mass of the upper beds of coarse clay, intermixed with every va- 
riety of the debris of rock, neither to be found here in situ, nor at 
any known distance from the spot. To this general covering of 
water-worn debris then, torn from all the strata, the name of dilu- 
vium has been given by geologists, from that great and universal 
catastrophe to which it appears most properly assignable. Within

this parish there are no data from which we might form even a 
probable conjecture, in regard to the direction of this mighty cur- 
rent. Were we, however, permitted to travel beyond our bounds, 
we might remark, in passing, that, in the neighbouring parish of 
Boyndie, a narrow line of water-worn boulders of hornblend and 
bypersthene, many of them weighing more than thirty tons, runs 
from a north-easterly to a south-westerly direction, and which are 
traced more than thirty miles in that line through part of the pa- 
rishes of Boyndie, Ordiquhill, Grange, Keith, Cairney, &amp;c. while 
no rock on that line, of the same kind, is found in situ. 

No organic remains are known to have been found within the 
parish, neither of plants nor animals, neither the ores of any of 
the metals, with the exception of iron, which, in combination with 
the mineral, gives it its colouring matter. 

Zoology — The mammalia, and indeed most of the other ani- 
mals, are, with perhaps a few exceptions, precisely the same in 
number and character in this parish as they are in most of the 
parishes immediately adjoining. 

Pearls are occasionally found in the Doveran. They are, how- 
ever, of very small size, and of no great brilliancy. 

Entomology. — On this head it may be mentioned that a few 
years ago, a large and beautiful specimen was found at Montblairy, 
in this parish, of the death's-head hawk-moth {Sphinx atropos. 
This insect is said to advance with the cultivation of the potato' 
Mr Duncan, in his History of British Moths Naturalists' Library 
Vol. xiv. does not take notice of any example of it having been' 
hitherto met with so far north. The specimen now mentioned 
is in the possession of a gentleman in Banff.

Plantations. — There are about 750 imperial acres under wood, 
nearly 300 of which have been planted within the last forty years. 
The trees most generally planted are the Scotch fir and larch, 
intermixed occasionally with a considerable proportion of beech, 
ash, oak, elm, plane, birch, alder, horse-chesnut, Spanish chesnut, 
lime, poplar, silver-fir, spruce-fir, service-tree, mountain-ash, la- 
burnum, holly, &amp;c. &amp;c. Judging by the comparative growth, the 
particular species of trees do not, in every instance, especially in 
the earliest plantations, appear to have been placed in the soil 
most congenial to their growth. The experience of the past, 
however, will, it is probable, prevent in future the occurrence of 
such mistakes as may have been committed in this respect. As 
yet, it seems doubtful whether the soil generally is more conge- 
nial to the Scotch fir or to the larch. It is plain, however, that 
there are many stations more favourable to the one than to the 
other, and not a few unfavourable to both, where, notwithstanding, 
spruce and silver fir, as also beech and oak, are of vigorous growth. 
In regard to Scotch firs, the result of many experiments seems 
to have rendered it certain, that plants raised from seed collected 
from the natural forest, grow more vigorously, and produce timber 
of better quality than the common plants of the nursery. The 
fine thriving firs immediately behind the house of Dunlugas were 
raised from plants of the former description, and by the accus- 
tomed eye might be distinguished as such, from the peculiar tinge 
of their foliage. Upon the whole, with a few exceptions in the 
more elevated localities exposed to the blast of the north, the 
soil of the parish is well adapted to the growth of timber of various 
kinds ; and if any opinion may be formed from the success of for- 
mer plantations, the soil, if judiciously selected, is congenial to a 

 The Scotch fir of this part of the country is, properly speaking, the Canadian 
fir. The true Scotch fir is more red in the colour, its bark has a cleaner and shining 
appearance, its boughs are more gnarled, its timber is reckoned of superior quality, 
and altogether its appearance is more majestic and picturesque. It may be seen in 
perfection at Marr Lodge.

much greater proportion of ash, oak, beech, elm, spruce, and sil- 
ver fir, than has yet been introduced.

Documents Transactions, &amp;;c. — In the Advocates' Library at 
Edinburgh, is preserved a very ancient parchment,f containing the 
particulars of a transaction connected with this parish, at a dis- 
tance of more than 500 years. This document is a charter of do- 
nation made by Marjory,| relict of the deceased John Earl of 
Atholl, Lord Strathalveth, with consent of her son David, her law- 
ful heir. The tenor of the donation is, that for the salvation of her 
own soul, as well as that of her deceased husband, John, Earl of 
Atholl, Lord Strathalveth, and of her father Donald,§ Earl of 
Mar, she gives to the blessed Virgin Mary, to God, and to the 
Abbot of Cupar, the right of patronage of the kirk of Alveth, 
with the whole lands of Kirktown of Alveth next the kirk. The 
charter, after the usual preamble, details very minutely the

here, they would thrive better and prove more useful than any of the pines and firs 
now cultivated in this quarter : Pinus uncinata, P. resinosa P. Pyrenaica, P. phiea 
P. Laricio, P. mitis, P. Gerardina, P. Strobus, P. excelsa, Abies pinea, A. w'ehbiana

t This parchment was formerly one of the manuscripts of the late William Rose 
Esq. of Montcoffer, to whose son, Patrick Rose,. Esq. Banff, the writer is indebted 
for the copy now, for the first time, published. The writer has also to acknowledo-e 
his obligations to the same gentleman for affording him the use of the materials out 
of which the report on this head has chiefly been drawn. ' 

X This couLtess was the daughter of Donald, alias Bayne, Earl of Mar, and wife 
of John, tenth Earl of Atholl and Strathbogie. This Earl of Atholl was a o-reat pa 
triot, and joined Robert Bruce at the battle of Methven ; but, being afterwards dis 
covered, was conducted to London, where, notwithstanding his alliance by blood to 
the English monarch, he was condemned and executed A.D. 1306. In consequence 
of his royal descent, he was hanged on a scaffold thirty feet higher than ordinary 
Before life was extinct, he was taken down, when his head was cut off, and fixed on" 
London Bridge, and his body burnt to ashes. As a ransom for his soul, his widow 
gave the lands of Alvah, iit supra. 

David, eleventh Earl of Atholl, was son and heir of the above-mentioned countess, 
and of John Earl of Atholl and Strathbogie, and gave his consent to the above-men- 
tioned donation. He was a favourite of King Robert Bruce, and was made High 
Constable of Scotlind in 1311. Havmg afterwards withdrawn his allegiance: and 
revolted to the English monarch, the office of High Constable was given to Sir Gil. 
bert Hay, and Atholl s estates were forfeited. He was married to Joan Cumyn, eld- 
est daughter and coheiress of John Lord Badenoch, and by her had a son, David 
de Strathbogie, the twelfth Earl of; Atholl. It is said he had other sons, from whom 
the M'Intoshes, Duffs, &amp;c. are believed to be descended. 

§ This Donald, Earl of Mar, father of the Countess of Atholl, Strathbogie, and 
Strathalvah, was taken prisoner at the battle of Methven, confined eight years in Lon- 
don, exchanged for an English nobleman taken at Bannockburn, and conducted to 
Scotland in 1314. About this time he appears to have died, for the charter of confir 
mation accompanying the charter of donation, is granted by his son and successor 
Thomas Earl of Mar, on the 1 9th March in the same year. ' 

I'rom an old and scarce work entitled " Index to Charters by King David IT " f 
appears that this Thomas, Earl of Mar, granted a charter of the lands of SandhauH 
now called Sand aw, and of the half of Auchenbadie to Thomas Hill, a person of 
whose history nothing is now known.  °

die XX. proximo post Sancti Pauli Apli," and is signed by 

many witnesses, among whom are the Bishops of Dunkeld and 
Brechin, the Abbots of Dumfermling and Aberbrothwick, with 
several knights and persons of distinction. The above-mentioned 
donation is accompanied by a charter of confirmation, granted by 
Thomas Earl of Mar, Lord Strathalveth, signed and sealed, 
" apud Moravien. sedem an. dni 1314, et 19 marcij," in presence 
of many witnesses of distinction. To this charter of confirmation 
there is a docquet subjoined in the holograph of Thomas Deir, 
desio'ned " clericus St Andreae dioc. ac sacra aplica aucto : No- 
tarius," by which Henry, Bishop of Aberdeen, confirms the said 
donations, 1375. 

The charters of donation and confirmation, of which we have 
here given the substance, are very interesting as documents of great 
antiquity, and if rightly interpreted may yet become important in 
other respects. The northern boundary of the parish of Alvah can- 
not, at present, be precisely determined by the oldest inhabitant, 
nor, in so far as the writer has been able to discover, are there any 
existing documents, excepting the charter before us, which seem at 
all calculated to throw any light on the subject. If the localities 
here mentioned could be exactly determined, the question would 
doubtless be set at rest ; but the face of the country has undergone 
so many important changes from the progress of improvement, that 
it is now impossible to identify the present names of places, with 

names which have, probably, long since been changed and forgotten.

ALVAU. 155 



Several of the places mentioned in the charter, however, are known 
by the same names at the present day, — a circumstance which en- 
ables us to form a more probable conjecture with regard to the lo- 
calities of the rest; and accordingly with this assistance and that 
of the native octogenarians and others, we have given in a note 

' To determine the precise locality of the Stane7nainishead is the first and greatest 
difficulty which presents itself in tracing the bounds of this ancient donation. From 
the words of tlie charter, the Stanemunnishead must have extended on the north to 
the town lands of Banff, and these lands are known from tradition and other evidence, 
to have stretched into the interior of the country as far as Cuirnelpie, situated on the 
north-eastern angle of the farm of Wardend, and are supposed to have been bounded 
by a line, nearly straight, passing from thence to the river Doveran, in the direction 
of the row of old thorn trees which crosses the upper end of the deer-park. That part 
of the parish which lies adjacent to this line is now called Craig-head,— a name which 
bears some distant resemblance to the Stanemannishead, and in terms of the charter 
hes due north of the church of Alvah. Supposing this line, then, to mark the boun- 
dary on the north, we are now directed, in tracing the eastern limit, to ascend the river 
Doveran as far as the Meirhcrn. 'I'his name, although now almost forgotten, is still 
remembered by a few as the name formerly given to the small burn which flows be- 
tween the farms of Mill of Alvah and Clayfolds. On ascending this streamlet, in 
terms of the charter, we arrive at Blackbank and Fowlfurd, places which, although 
now unknown by these names, must have stood on the same burn a little below the 
present manse. A little farther up lies Knokkne, a place whicii still retains its an- 
cient name. From this we are directed to ascend the stream which flows from Cla- 
ret-well, untd we come to the road ascending to Slakmethy. The Claret-well is still 
known by the same name, and the stream which flows from it is only the upper end 
of the Meirburn—circumstances which confirm the opinion given in regard to the 
previously mentioned localities. The road ascending southward to Slackmethy. al- 
though this name is now forgotten, can be no other than the road ascending to the place 
now called Berryhillocks, and the descent from thence to Slacklethy must be the conti- 
nuation of the same slack to the place now called Kemplemire. From the well at Slack- 
Iethy Kemplemire, the charter directs us to follow the stream to its junction, at Red- 
bank, with the torrent which flows into Doveran. Redbank must be identified with 
Path-head, and the torrent pa.ssing this and flowing into Doveran is the burn of Stony- 
lea. Ascending this burn, as directed, we arrive at Ranate hillock, a place which 
probably corresponds with what is now called Ranald's hillock, .situated on the same 
burn a little below Eythestown. Farther up we come to the Crukit-hiUock, a name 
c • r u "'' is quite descriptive of the Broomhillock below Firfolds 

htiU farther up is Scurryfurd, which is probably the place where an old road now 
crosses the marshy hollow north-west of Bythestown, near the Slacks. We are ne.xt 
directed to ascend to the Greit Slack and Rishypannis. The Greit Slack is, no doubt, 
the Slacks of I ipperty, which commence immediately above the supposed locality of 
Scurryfurd. Rishypannis or Rishypans is a name not uncommon in this part of the 
country, and probably the Rishypannis of the charter may have been somewhere about 
the lower and once marshy extremity of the Slacks of Tipperty. From these Slacks 
a hollow on the farm of lipperty leads directly to the next station, viz. Comeswell- 
a well which still retains its ancient name. In completing the circuit, we are now 
directed to proceed from Comeswell to St John's well, and Bludypott's ad Burgusa;t 
stains inter communam de Banff et terra ecclesiastica de Alveth. 'i he site of St 
John s well IS now unknown, and that of Bludypott's can only be conjectured. In 
regard to the Burgu.sa;t stains we have more certainty. One of these was dug up 
naore tlian twenty years ago, near the wood of Bauchlaw, on the north-east angTe of 
the farm of Wardend. The letter B was rudely carved on it, and tradition had pre- 
viously marked the spot where it was found, as the point to which the Banff lands at 
one period extended. With true antiquarian taste and feeling, this stone was broken 
down and employed as material for building. Near the place where it was discovered 
once stood acaim known by the name of Caimelpie, in removing which, the fragments 
ot a human skeleton were found. According to tradition, these were the remains of a 
person murdered here in former times, and as the cairn once stood on the margin of

below what we conceive to have formed the probable boundaries 
of this ancient donation, which, if our conjecture be right, will 
point out the northern boundary of the parish. We need only 
farther remark at present, that the boundary of the donation which 
we have attempted to trace, comprehends almost the whole of the 
lands possessed by the present Earl of Fife,, within this parish, 
west of the river Doveran; and if, as the best accredited genealo- 
gies affirm, his Lordship be descended from the Atholl family, it 
is a very curious fact, that he should be in possession, at the pre- 
sent day, of the lands which were given away by his ancestor at the 
distance of 524 years. 

It was the writer's intention to have traced the succession of 
landed property in the parish from the date of the above-mention - 
ed charter down to the present time : but materials accumulated 
to an extent so incompatible with a work of this description, that 
he has found it necessary to present only a few detached fragments 
of the more interesting and less generally known portions of this 
part of our history. 

In the " Registrum Magni Sigilli Regum Scotorum in Arclii- 
vis publicis asservatum," is found at page 250, the confirmation 
of a grant, of date 1410, by Alexander Stewart, Earl of Marrand 
Garviach, Garioch, and Dominus de Dufle in Brabant, to his 
brother Andrew Stewart, of the lands of Sandhalch, Sandlaw, in 
the barony of Montblairy. This Earl of Marrand his brother 
Andrew, were two of the five natural sons of Alexander Stewart, 
Earl of Marr, better known by the appropriate name of the Wolf 
of Badenoch. In 1426, Douglas, Lord Balveny had a grant of 
Strathalvah confirmed by King James I. After the forfeiture of 
Douglas, the Lordship of Balveny, reverting to the crown, was in 

a deep and extensive pond, the place at an early period may probably have obtained 
the name of Bludypotts. Thus have we arrived at the place from which we set out, 
namely, the Stanemannishead— a place already identified with what is now called 
Craighead. This Craighead, as already mentioned, stretches in a line from the Bur- 
gusset stains at Bludypotts or Cairnelpie to the river Doveran, and this line across the 
upper end of the deer-park is now pretty generally considered the northern boundary 
of the parish of Alvah, although there are some who positively maintain that the pa- 
rish extends a considerable distance farther to the north. If a few more of the Bur- 
gusset stains were discovered between Cairnelpie and Doveran, the boundary, perhaps, 
might be determined with greater certainty. In regard to the boundary which we 
have now traced, it need only be farther remarked, that the ascents and descents, the 
heights and hollows, the points of the compass, and the course ot the streams, all cor- 
respond with the terms of the charter, — circumstances, which, taken in connection 
with the names still extant, render it highly probable that the above outline is pretty 
accurately delineated. The northern boundary of the Stanemannishead is the only 
point about which any doubt can be entertained. Mr Cowie has the principal merit 
of tracing the boundaries of this ancient donation.

1460 disponed to Sir John Stewart, afterwards created Earl of 
AthoU ; but with this lordship he does not seem to have received 
any of the lands of Alvah, for we find that his younger brother, 
Sir James Stewart, received a charter of Strathalvah from King 
James II. in 1466, and of the lands of Sandlach Sandlaw, iti 
1492. These two Stewarts were sons of Sir James Stewart, com- 
monly called the Black Knight of Lorn, and of Joanna, dowager 
of King James I., and were, consequently, uterine brothers of 
King James IL, for which they seem to have been distinguished 
by many marks of royal favour. The former Sir John Stewart, was 
created Earl of Atholl, and the latter, Sir James Stev/art, known 
also by the name of Hearty James, received Strathalvah and Sand- 
law, as already stated, and was created Earl of Buchan in 1469, and 
. appointed great Chamberlain of Scotland in 1471. From seve- 
ral existing charters, it appears that the Stewarts, and afterwards 
the Douglases, Earls of Buchan, retained property in the parish 
of Alva upwards of 1 50 years after the last mentioned date. From 
the worked printed by command of King George III. in 181 1, and

pears tliat Maria Douglas, Countess of Buchan, had in 1 6 1 5, charters 
of the following lands, in the barony of Montblairy, viz. Waistryne, 
Newtown, Todlaw, Quhitfield, Smedytown, and Haltown of Mont- 
blairy, the dominical lands of Auchenbadie with the mill, the lands 
of Staneley, the other lands of Auchenbadie, and lands of Ryland 
with the mill. Soon after this, a great part of these lands seems 
to have passed into other hands ; for from the work just referred 
to we find James Earl of Moray in possession of the barony of 
Montblairy and Ryland in 1619. About seventy or eighty years 
previously to this date, the other lands of the parish seem to have 
been possessed chiefly by Sir Walter Ogilvie of Dunlugas, whose 
rare turn for the acquisition of property is noticed in the present 
Statistical Account of the parish of Banff. Among the valuable 
manuscripts which belonged to the late William Rose, Esq. Mont- 
coffer, was a charter to Sir Walter Ogilvie of Dunlugas, granted 
2d February 1593, by the Cistertians of Cupar, of the lands of Al- 
vah and Inverichny. The lands of Alvah, here mentioned, were, 
no doubt, the donation of the Countess of Atholl, already particu- 
larly noticed ; but how the Cistertians became possessed of In- 
verichny is not very clear. From Nisbet's Append. 171, Inver- 
ichny would seem to have been mortified to Strathbogie, and pro- 
bably may have been presented by him to the Abbot of Cupar 
soon after the donation made by the Countess of Atholl. The 
charter conveying the above-mentioned lands to Sir Walter Ogilvie 
is now deposited in the Advocates' Library at Edinburgh, and as 
it seems to have been quite unknown to all the collectors of antiqm- 
ties of this kind, it may here be intelligibly presented in the fol- 
lowing abridged form : « Omnibus, &amp;c. Donaldus, &amp;c. Abbas

This Sir Walter Ogilvie was the ancestor of Lord Banff, and 
as his lineal descendant is still the most considerable heritor in tlie 
parish, he may, perhaps, with propriety, be more particularly no- 
ticed. He was grandson of Sir Walter Ogilvieof Auchleven, an- 
cestor of the first Earl of Findlater, and great grandson of Sir 
Walter Ogilvie of Lintrathen, High Treasurer of Scotland in 
1425, and ancestor of the family of Airly. Besides the proper- 
ty granted to him, in the parish, by the charter just mentioned, 
he acquired from Urquhartof Cromarty, in 1530, the half of Dun- 
lugas, Sandlavv, and the haugh of Newton. The other lands of 
Alvah, excepting Montblairy and Auchinbadie, he obtained from 
the Erasers of Philorth. He had also charters of Scatterly and 
Castletown in the parish of King- Edward, of Blackhill in Moray- 
shire, the lands of Petty, Braithliern, Strathe, and the Castle of 
Howhill in Inverness-shire, Carnousie, in Banffshire, and Mony- 
cabok in the county of Aberdeen. From the Barclays of Mont- 
coffer he acquired the Mains of Montcoffer and Gaveny. By his 
wife, Alisone Hume, daughter and co-heiress of Sir Patrick Hume 
of Fastcastle, he had a considerable estate. He had also exten- 
sive property in the county of Berwick, besides smaller estates in 
other parts of the country. From Leonard, Commendator of Cu 
par, he obtained the teinds of the parish of Alvah, and from the 
Abbacy of Arbroath the teinds of Banff and Gamrie. His successor 
for some time, appears to have rapidly increased the family property' 
and his great grandson. Sir George Ogilvie, for his eminent loyaUy 
and faithful services, particularly in the action against Montrose 
and the Covenanters, at the bridge of Dee in 1639, was raised 
to the Peerage, by the title of First Lord Banff, by King Charles I. 
in 1642. His lineal descendant, the Honourable Lady Aber- 
cromby of Forglen,t daughter of the seventh Lord BanfF, still re-

tains an extensive portion of the lands of her ancestors, and is, at. 
present, the most considerable proprietor in the parish. 

Eminent Characters. — This parish has produced but few indivi- 
duals eminently distinguished. Dr George Chapman may, perhaps, 
with some hesitation, be mentioned as one. By a reference to the re- 
gister of baptisms, it appears that he was born at Little Blacktown, 
and baptised August 18, 1723. A minute in the session records 
also intinates, that, while a student in philosophy, he taught the 
school of his native parish. He afterwards acquired distinguished 
reputation as a teacher and a scholar, at Dalkeith, Dumfries, Inch- 
drewer, and Banff. He finally removed to Edinburgh, where for 
some years he carried on business as a printer, and at the same 
time, received boarders, the instruction of whom formed his favou- 
rite recreation almost to the close of a life which extended to the 
age of eighty-three years. His " Treatise on Education," and his 
other smaller publications on the same subject, were, at the time of 
their appearance, justly esteemed for their practical utility. 

The name of another individual, to whose memory a monument 
has been erected at the public expense, may also be allowed a 
place in the statistics of the parish in which he resided, and in 
which, his memory is still cherished with respect. The late Ma- 
jor General Andrew Hay, who sold the estate of Montblairy to 
the uncle of the present proprietor, was distinguished in the parish 
by his generous and public spirit, no less than by his valour in the 
field. To perpetuate his military fame, an elegant monument has 
been erected in St Paul's Cathedral, London, bearing the follow- 
ing inscription : " Erected at the public expense to the memory 
of Major General Andrew Hay. He was born in the county of 
Banff in Scotland, and fell on the 14th of April 1814, before the 
Fortress of Bayonne, in France, in the fifty-second year of his age 
and the thirty-fourth of his services, closing a military life, 
marked by zeal, prompt decision, and signal intrepidity." 

Land-Owners. — The only heritors in the parish are, Lady 
Abercromby, who possesses the patronage of the church ; the Earl 
of Fife; the Trustees of the late Earl James Fife ; Alexander Mo- 
rison, Esq. of Montblairy ; Hans George Leslie, Esq. of Dunlu- 
gas ; and Harry Leith Lumsden, Esq. of Rosyburn. It is but 
justice to say that they are all liberal and encouraging to indus- 
trious tenants. The only resident proprietors are Mr Morison and 
Mr Leslie. 

Parochial Registers. — These consist of one quarto and six folio

volumes, and appear to have been regularly kept, in so far, per- 
haps, as the keepers were concerned. But, from the numerous 
applications for extracts of births and marriages, which are not to 
be found in the registers, it is evident, that, until within a recent 
period, both births and marriages have been very irregularly entered. 
Each successive keeper of these registers appears also to have 
made his entries after a form of his own, and in some cases, these 
entries are very defective in point of information. For instance 
the date of baptism is often recorded without the date of birth, 
and without mentioning the place of residence. The father's 
name is also often recorded without that of the mother ; and the- 
residence or designation of witnesses, until of late years, appears 
never to have been noticed. These and other irregularities, it is 
believed, prevail to a great extent in our parochial registers, and 
should any change take place in the mode of keeping them, this 
is a point to which the devisers of a better scheme, ought to be 
particularly directed. It might tend, perhaps, to secure uniformity 
and regularity, if the pages of our registers were uniformly printed, 
and draughted in the form of schedules, with spaces left to be filled 
up with dates, names, places of residence, and other essential de- 
tails. Each page should also be subscribed by the name of the 
keeper of the register, and every exertion made to enforce regis- 
tration. 

Our earliest recorded baptism is dated May 17, 1718, and the 
earliest minute of session. May 13, 1718. The earlier records 
are said to have been destroyed by accidental fire : — Others main- 
tain that they were carried off by Mr George Campbell, minis- 
ter of the parish, who, in 1718, was ejected from his charge on 
account of his adherence to Episcopacy. 

Antiquities. — Scarcely any remains of antiquity are now to be 
found in the parish. Some years ago, a tumulus was opened on 
the farm of Sandlaw, containing several rudely sculptured vases of 
baked earth. In a tumulus, on the farm of Boghead, were found 
several vases of a similar kind, containing ashes. Contiguous 
to this tumulus is a large stone called carliii hist, supposed to be 
part of a " cromlech," or kist-vaen. In digging into a small gra- 
vel hillock, near Montblairy, a rude stone case or coffin, about four 
feet square, was discovered, and, on removing the stone which 
formed the lid, were found some ashes and a few fragments of cal- 
cined bones. In digging graves in the churchyard, several vases 
containing ashes have been found, but differing from others dis-

covered in the parish, in having handles attached, and in being 
glazed over with a substance resembling the exterior coating of 
the coarse earthen-ware of the present day. On the eastern brow 
of the hill of Alvah, is a large tumulus or cairn, consisting chiefly of 
small stones and earth. It is of an elliptical form, covering.an area 
of about 20 falls, and in the centre risinor to the heio-ht of 7 or 
8 feet, but has never been sufficiently opened to disclose any re- 
mains of antiquity. Two smaller unopened cairns are also to be 
seen on the hill of Tipperty, and on the farm of Itlaw. There is 
also on the farm of Auchenbadie an apparently artificial mound of 
earth, nearly fifty feet high. It is known by the name oiHa -hill ; 
but there is no tradition respecting it, nor have any remains of 
antiquity been found in it. On the farm of Burreldales, there 
remain four large stones of a Druidical circle, and on the farm of 
Newtown of Montblairy, one large stone marks the site where, a 
few years ago, stood another circle of much larger dimensions. 
Some time ago, a Druidical circle was found under ground, in dig- 
ging deep into an old garden on the farm of Wardend. The ruins 
of the ancient castle which once stood near Montblairy are levelled 
with the ground, and the swamp on which it stood has now be- 
come a fruitful field. According to tradition, the castle in ques- 
tion was built by one of the Stewarts, Earls of Buchan ; but by 
which of them, or for what purpose, the writer has been unable to 
discover. In regard to the ancient chapel, now also entirely de- 
molished, which stood in its vicinity, tradition is entirely silent. 
As already stated, Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar, had the ba- 
rony of Montblairy, about the year 1400, and, as it is certain that 
he founded a chaplainry in the Garioch, the chapel in question 
may, probably, have been something in connection with that foun- 
dation. Whilst noting antiquities, it may also be mentioned that 
about 1000 acres of the poorest soil in the parish bear marks of 
cultivation at a period very remote ; and that in the haughs of 
Sandlaw, and in the moss to the north of Maunderlea, and else- 
where, trees of considerable size have been frequently found deeply 
imbedded in the soil. In the haughs of Sandlaw, they have been 
discovered lying at the depth of 8 or 10 feet from the surfixce; 
and in the moss, many of the trees, consisting chiefly of fir, oak, 
and alder, bear the marks of fire distinctly visible, while others are 
found with the roots uppermost, near the surface, and with their 
trunks deeply sunk. In some cases, the root of one tree has been 
found right above the stump of another.

Modem Buildings. — Under this head, tlie parish presents little 
worthy of particular notice. The house of Montblairy, the pro- 
perty of Alexander Morison, Esq. was built in 1791 by the late 
Major- General Andrew Hay, whose name has been already men- 
tioned. It is a substantial and commodious ediHce of three storeys. 
A considerable addition was made to it in 1 825. Within the last 
two years, it has received a thorough repair, and its outward ap- 
pearance is now very handsome and tasteful. Its situation amid 
thriving plantations on a fine sloping bank, on the west side of the 
Doveran, is particularly delightful, and the large and beautiful 
quadrangle of offices erected on the wooded rising-ground behind 
the house, adds not a little to the beauty of the scene, when viewed 
from the opposite side of the river. The southern fa9ade of this 
quadrangle is adorned in the centre with an elegant portico, sup- 
ported by four massy columns of the Ionic order, and surmounted 
by a corresponding entablature and pediment. An attic storey ex- 
tends from one end of the building to the other, and the whole is 
constructed of beautifully dressed granite. 

It may be noticed, while on this subject, that in the house of 
Montblairy, are to be found a few paintings which deserve the at- 
tention of the lover, whether of the arts or of history. Of these 
may be mentioned as the most valuable, either as works of art or 
as representations of remarkable individuals, — an original portrait 
of the Admirable Crichton, transmitted, according to tradition, 
by Crichton himself from Mantua to the Laird of Frendraught, to 
whom he was related ;— six portraitsf by Jameson, including the 
great Montrose, and the infamous Lady Frendraught, whose cruelty 
m setting fire to the house of Frendraught is commemorated in a 
well known popular ballad portraits of Peter the Great, and 
Prince Menzikoff, presented by the Czar himself to Gordon of 
Auchentoul, who was a General in the Russian service, and wrote 

• Mr Tytler mentions, in his life of CridUon, that there are three original nor. 
traits in this country of that famed individual ; one in the possession of Colonel C ich- 
ton, Ldinburgh ; and another belonging to Mr Stirling of Airth, both of which he 
has seen, and from the former of which his engraving was taken. The third is the 
one in question, which Mr Tytler never saw. Judging from the engraving in his 
book the present portrait would appear to be much superior to the one made use of 
by lUr lytler. It is indeed regarded by judges as a painting of great merit, and is 
also in an excellent state of preservation. The painter, in so far as we are aware is 
unknown. ' 

t These portraits are but in an indifferent state of preservation. The truth is 
that, owing to the extremely thin covering which Jameson used, or else to accident-il 
circumstances, the portraits of our Scottish Vandyke as he has not unjustly been

and of the Duke of Alva, &amp;c. 

About half a mile below Montblairy, on the opposite side of the 
river, stands the house of Dunlugas, the property of Hans George 
Leslie, Esq. This house, built of granite, in 1793, consists of 
three stories, and is substantial, commodious, and elegant. With 
the exception of Duff House, perhaps no residence in the county 
of Banff is more delightfully situated. A beautiful and extensive 
lawn, partially adorned with lofty trees, which are tastefully dispos- 
ed for effect, stretches in front to the margin of the river, and the 
ground, rising somewhat abruptly behind, is covered chiefly with 
thriving firs, whose dark foliage is finely contrasted with the light 
and more varied tints spread over the scene below. 

Mills. — Within the last thirty years, 31 thrashing-mills have 
been erected in the parish, seven of which are driven by horses, and 
24 by water. There are also six meal-mills, one malt-mill, and one 
lint-mill ; but none'of these last have been recently erected. The 
whole of the mills now mentioned are built of clay-slate, the pre- 
vailing rock within the parish. There is still one remnant ofthir-- 
lage in the parish.

From the above tables it appears, that, during the fifty-six years 
which elapsed between 1755 and 1811, there was a remarkable 
decrease of 170 in the population of the parish, and that during 
the twenty years which elapsed between 1811 and 1831, there has 
been an increase of 287. Some years after 1755, the parish be- 
gan to assume a new aspect, by the introduction of the improved 
system of husbandry, in the prosecution of which most of the 
farmers removed their subtenants, and began to farm on a more 
extensive scale, and to this cause alone is to be ascribed the par- 
tial depopulation which took place during the period in question. 
Since 1811, the number of subtenants removed has been very in- 
considerable, and much more than compensated by the introduc- 
tion of a number of crofters, who are now thickly and extensively 
scattered over the drearier districts of the parish, and are rapidly 
bringing into cultivation large tracts of waste land, which, at one 
time, were scarcely thought susceptible of improvement. Thus 
both the decrease between 1755 and 1811, and the increase be- 
tween 1811 and 1831 are easily accounted for. 

The yearly average of births for the last seven years is 32|, of 
which one-thirteenth are illegitimate. The yearly average of mar- 
riages for the last seven years is 4|. No register of deaths is kept. 
The number of persons of independent fortune is 2, viz. the two 
resident heritors. There are no proprietors of land but the six 
heritors formerly mentioned. The number of persons insane is 1 ; 
fatuous, 1 ; and blind, 2. The language generally spoken is a 
toarse mixture of Scotch and English, with an accent broad and 
drawling ; but within the last forty years, considerable improvement 
in this respect is certainly perceptible. There are no customs, 
games, or amusements peculiar to this part of the country. As a 
general fact, indeed, it may be observed, that all ranks and ages 
seem to have lost much of the relish for what formerly constituted 
the chief amusements of their forefathers. The habits of the peo- 
ple are in general cleanly, although among the poorer classes, ne- 
gligence in this respect, particularly in the matter of dress and 
bed-clothes, is but too frequently met with, and is, no doubt, oc- 
casionally the foundation of disease. The ordinary food of the 
peasantry consists of milk, meal, kail, or colewort, turnips, and 
potatoes, variously prepared. Among the aged poor, particularly 
females, tea is used to a great, perhaps to an injurious extent. 
Beef, mutton, bacon, or fish, seldom forms any part of the labour- 
er's dinner; but it is to be hoped that one or other of these mav

yet be more frequently afforded than present circumstances per- 
mit. The effects of hard labour, and under-feeding, become 
very perceptible on the approach of age. 

In so far as moral delinquency can be traced from our earliest 
records, commencing in 1718, it appears that, more than a hundred 
years ago, when the population of the parish was much less than it 
is at present, crime of every description was more generally preva- 
lent. Notwithstanding the severe discipline which the church then 
rigorously enforced, the number of illegitimate births was as great 
as at the present day, and not unfrequently attended with circum- 
stances of a revolting and aggravated description, which are now 
unheard of in the parish.

There are no undivided commons in the parish, but on the moss

is in Alvah, the Earl of Seafield and the Earl of Fife for a few 
farms on his estates have a servitude of firing : but the " bottom" 
or under strata belongs in property to the Forglen estates, and be- 
ing on the sandy clay, of a good quality, the ground is brought 
into cultivation as the moss is exhausted. 

The valued rent of the parish is L. 3304, 13s. 4d. Scotch, and 
the real rental about L. 4065 Sterling. The average rent of 
arable land is 13s. per imperial acre, or I6s. 5d. per Scotch acre, 
but, taking into account surplus rents paid by subtenants, the ave- 
rage rent paid for land is 14s. 3d. per imperial acre, or 18s. per 
Scotch acre.

troduced the improved system of husbandry, the agriculture of this

of crop, the quantity of grain produced, and the amount of live-stock, have been ob- 
tained from returns made by all the farmers in the parish, who both iiindly furnish- 
ed the information in question, and studied to render it as accurate as possible. One 
of the estates has been recently surveyed ; but of other four the surveys are of older 
date, arid the survey of the remaining one has not yet been completed ; so that in 
our statements of the total extent of the parish, the extent of waste land, &amp;c. ex- 
treme accuracy cannot be warranted, although we have reason to think that oyr 
statements are pretty nearly correct.

part of the country was of the most wretched description, and in 
this parish no improvement of any consequence seems to have taken 
place until about twenty years after; but since that time, im- 
provement has been rapid and steadily progressive, and the agri- 
culture of the parish may now be said to be conducted, on the 
most approved principles. 

Rotation, 8fc. — A regular rotation of cropping, suited to the na- 
ture of the soil, has long been universally adopted. The most 
common rotations are what are called the five, six, and seven shift 
courses — the last-mentioned being that which is, at present, most 
generally followed. Great and increasing attention is also paid to 
the preparation of the soil by superior ploughing and cleaning, and 
judicious application of manure. Lime has long been extensively 
employed, and, excepting a few cases in which it has been injudi- 
ciously applied, it has always been attended with the best effects. 
Several years ago, no fewer than eighty barrels or forty bolls per 
Scotch acre were laid on the haughs of Sandlaw, at an expense of 
L. 10 per acre, exclusive of carriage. In consequence of this, the 
produce was doubled — the fields yielding upwards of seven quar- 
ters of wheat, followed next season by 300 stones of hay per Scotch 
acre. This, however, is an extreme case, arising from the depth 
and nature of the soil. The greater part of the inferior land of 
the parish can scarcely receive twenty-five barrels per Scotch 
acre, without sustaining an injury which the farmers as yet know 
not how to repair. Within the last four or five years, bone-dust 
has been introduced as a manure, and with a degree of success 
which has not yet been satisfactorily explained. We cannot as vet 
say with certainty which of the ingredients of this manure consti- 
tutes the food of plants; for although bones boiled and crushed 
have been found to afford as good a manure as those in a raw 
state, and although this circumstance would seem to strengthen 
the opinion, that it is not the oily matter in the bones that consti- 
tutes the manure, yet the fact, that bones so boiled and crushed 
render the soil apparently as rich with oil as bones in a raw state, 
forbids us from asserting positively that the phosphate of lime 
alone constitutes the food of plants in the manure in question. 

" The state of agriculture in this parish at the period in question, is incidentally 
noticed in Souter's " General View of the Agriculture of the County of Banff, drawn 
up in 1812, for the consideration of the Board of Agriculture." In the same work 
may also be found descriptions and engravings of a turnip-sowing machine and horse- 
hoe, the ingenious inventions of the late Mr John Cowie, farmer at Sandlaw, and the 
first implements of the kind introduced into this part of the country. 



168 



BANFFSHIRE. 



But, whatever may be the chemical action of bone-dust, it has here 
been experimentally and satisfactorily proved that this manure can 
impart no richness to any kind of soil, unless naturally dry or tho- 
roughly drained. To the soil of this parish, generally, it is well 
adapted, and has accordingly been almost universally used, al- 
though its application has hitherto been exclusively confined to 
the turnip crops. The quantity here employed varies from twenty- 
five to thirty bushels per Scotch acre, at a price which has varied 
from 2s. 4d to 3s. 8d. per bushel ; but even a much smaller quan- 
tity has sometimes been applied with surprising effect. The best 
practical farmers are of opinion that thirty bushels of bone-dust, 
in good fresh land, not exhausted by over- cropping, will produce 
as good turnips, and stand out the rotation as well as if twenty-five 
cubic yards and upwards of farm-yard dung had been applied. 

Crops raised. — Some years ago, wheat was raised in considera- 
ble quantities, but, since the fall in price, this crop has been al- 
most entirely discontinued. Bear and barley are also at present 
raised to a very limited extent. Bear seems the more suitable of 
the two to our soil and climate, ripening earlier, and affording a 
better quality of grain. Chevalier-barley has been tried, but 
is fast wearing out of repute. Except in very favourable seasons, 
it is found too late for our climate. Various kinds of oats are 
sown, according to the nature of the different soils, such as potato, 
Hopeton, birly, sandy oats, &amp;c. The potato oats are mostly 
confined to the deep loams. The Hopeton are getting thicker 
in the husks upon being re-sown. The birly and sandy oats are 
excellent kinds, and well adapted to our soil and climate, and, as 
they are little known in the southern counties, their quality may 
be stated in comparison with the old common oats. They are from 
eight to ten days earlier, produce more straw, and yield four per 
cent, of more meal. Their average weight in 1836 was 42 lbs. 
per bushel. Good sandy oats bring the same price as potato oats. 
They are also as early, and have a great advantage over them, in 
producing a much greater quantity of straw, in being less liable to 
shake, and not apt to give way at the roots. Pease and beans, 
though once common, are now scarcely sown in the parish. The 
average number of imperial acres in yearly grain crop is 2846, and 
the average produce is 9792 imperial quarters, — being an averao-e 
produce, per imperial acre, of nearly 3 quarters 4 bushels, or per 
Scotch acre, of nearly 4 quarters 3 bushels. Ten of the best 
farms on and near the banks of the Doveran produce, on an ave-

rage, 5 quarters 6 bushels per Scotch acre, while some of the 
best fields, in the same district, have been known to yield occa- 
sionally 1'2 quarters per Scotch acre. 

Planting. — The extent planted is 750 acres. In regard to 
management, although our system, appears generally proper, yet, 
if more attention were paid to pruning and thinning, especially 
at an early age, it is believed that the trees would be more 
healthy, and of much larger growth. Several young and thriv- 
ing plantations of larch might be pointed out, in which it is 
necessary to cut down at least one-fourth of the trees immediate- 
ly, in order to preserve them in a healthy state. Young trees are 
also too frequently suffered to be overpowered by the growth of 
whins ; and in some stations of considerable extent, where the 
whins have been eradicated, with a view to remedy the evil, the 
the second plantation of trees has been completely destroyed by 
the rabbits, with which our woods are infested. 

Waste Land Improved. — 2278 imperial acres have been im- 
proved within the last forty years. By far the greater part of this 
extent has been reclaimed from thin land previously overgrown 
with furze and heath. This sort of improvement on large farms 
would seem, in some cases, to have been over-extended, as a con- 
siderable part has either again been allowed to run into its natu- 
ral state, or has now been planted. The most valuable improve- 
ments, however, have been effected by means of draining and ditch- 
ing marshy ground, and so far have these been carried, that com- 
paratively little now remains to be done in this way. The usual 
mode of reclaiming waste land of a certain description, is to trench, 
or trench plough the ground in autumn, allow it to lie in that 
state during winter, and generally all the following year, and in 
the second spring to crop it with oats in which case, turnips fol- 
low the next year or prepare it for green crop. The mossy lands 
once of very considerable extent are improved by drying and 
burning. The water is drawn off by open ditches and drains. The 
upper part of the moss, when dry, is burnt, and spread for ma- 
nure, and lime is applied for raising artificial grass. When the 
season is dry and early, this mode of culture produces fine crops 
of oats. 

Waste Lands still unimproved. — In the parish there are 3428 
imperial acres still unimproved. Planting is, no doubt, the only

kind of improvement of which the greater part of the waste land 
is susceptible ; and, accordingly, we are enabled to state, that, on 
the western district, the property of Lady Abercromby, 306 im- 
perial acres are to be enclosed and planted immediately, with mix- 
ed wood, but chiefly with larch, for which both the soil and climate 
appear most favourable. It is believed that plantations of consi- 
derable extent are also contemplated by §ome of the other pro- 
prietors. After all, however, a great extent will still remain to be 
improved. In the district mentioned above, 664 imperial acres 
have been conditioned to be improved, in leases of nineteen years, 
lately granted. When all the improvements, both those in pro- 
gress, as well as those contemplated by the proprietor, viz. 
straightening the marches, dividing the land into farms of conve- 
nient size, improving and planting the wastes, and draining and 
enclosing the cultivated land, have been completed, this once and 
still comparatively dreary district will assume a highly improved 
appearance. Similar improvements on the other estates will no 
doubt follow in course, at least in so far as they are practicable and 
necessary. Whilst speaking of waste lands, it occurs to the wri- 
ter, that this species of property might be very advantageously im- 
proved by letting, at least a considerable part of it, in small tene- 
ments or crofts. Besides the necessity which exists for supplying 
our surplus population with places of abode and the means of sup- 
port, there are many parts of the parish of Alvah of a soil so poor 
and unequal, that no other method seems so well calculated to 
improve it. Large farms on such a soil are entirely out of the 
question. Indeed, it is doubtful, if improving a great extent of 
waste land on one farm, under any circumstances, be a safe specu- 
lation to the improver, or of practical utility in any respect. That 
it has fallen far short, often, of all reasonable expectation, there 
can be no doubt. But the improvement of waste lands by small 
tenements is of a more permanent and useful nature ; and, though 
at first it may not be done to any great degree of perfection, its 
progress is gradual and sure. A crofter once set down on the 
poorest land, or land altogether waste, seldom or never fails to 
make an independent livelihood, and to bring up his family, and 
give them such an education as fits them for becoming useful mem- 
bers of society. Mechanics that are wanted for the district, such 
as tailors, shoemakers, masons, wrights, blacksmiths, &amp;c. are all

sure to thrive on such possessions. Hand-loom weavers from ma- 
nufacturing towns might also be tried, and if they succeeded, it 
would be a valuable experiment. The expense of carriage is 
the only obstacle, but with our present fficilities of conveyance, 
that expense could not be great. In letting waste land, in the man- 
ner suggested, the appearance of the country would be greatly im- 
proved, and the comfort of the crofters, at the same time, in- 
creased, if they were bound to build their houses after some uni- 
form and regular plan, to thatch and harl them when necessary, 
and to attend to such other cheap and tasteful improvements as 
their landlords might suggest. 

Breeds of Cattle. — The breed of cattle in the parish seems to 
be the same with, or at least very little different from, the Aber- 
deenshire breed. The only remarkable alteration that has taken 
place, for some years back, is the great increase of hummel cattle 
compared with the number of horned. By the graziers and best 
judges, this alteration is considered an improvement. About 
twenty years ago, a different opinion prevailed, and a good show 
of horns was a point much valued. As to systematic breeding in 
the way practised in the south, very little has been done in the 
parish, except that, in choosing bulls and cows, the best and hand- 
somest in the stock are generally selected and reared. The good 
or bad qualities of the former, however, are not always so much 
attended to as they ought. If the animal is once reared, he is 
seldom rejected, however indifferent his qualities may be. Most 
of the farmers consider systematic breeding as a scheme of too 
distant and uncertain remuneration, and, leaving this part of their 
economy to persons of larger means, they are content to avail 
themselves of the advantages resulting from the experience of 
others. But although the farmers here are not much given to 
expensive experiments, yet so greatly do they proHt by the expe- 
rience of others, that they cannot be said to be behind their neiah- 
bours in skill and judgment in the management of their sto°ck. 
The practice generally followed on farms of a moderate size is 
this : the stock consists of four sets, viz. cows, one year olds, 
two year olds, and three year olds, of each nearly an equal num- 
ber. The three year olds are sold off in the spring, or before 
Whitsunday generally fat, by which time the calves are ready 
to take their place, so that about the same number is always kept 
up. Some sell off their three year olds before winter, and"substi. 
tute four year olds in their room. Others speculate a little on 



U2 BANFFSHIRE. 

grazing. The fat cattle three year old on the best farms, will 
weigh on an average 35 stones Dutch, but over the parish httle 
more than 30 stones ; four year olds will weigh from 45 to 50 
stones ; while a few older cattle are sold annually, weighing 70 
stones and upwards. If there be any thing reprehensible in our 
practice, it is that of overstocking and paying too little attention 
to the nourishment of calves, and the qualities of bulls. 

The propriety of introducing what is called the short-horned, 
or Teeswater breed, is at present a much agitated question. The 
experiment has been made, with peculiar propriety, by some of 
the heritors in this and the neighbouring parishes, but few, if any, 
of the farmers here have yet followed the example, and probably 
will not do so, until they are satisfied as to the favourable nature 
of the result, and can make the experiment at less expense. The 
prevailing opinion is, that, in crossing the shorthorned with the 
native breed, the race will degenerate, and at last leave in the 
country a race retaining all the bad qualities of both, with few of 
the good, and thus destroying the purity of both. In Aberdeen- 
shire, where the experiment has been longer tried, it has been 
found that upon good and sheltered land, especially if enclosed, 
one cross betwixt the Teeswater bull and the Aberdeenshire cow 
answers extremely well, coming to a greater weight and earlier 
maturity than the native breed ; but upon inferior land and open 
field, it is generally thought they never can supplant the native 
race. Their flesh cannot at all compete with prime Scotch in 
the London market, and the Aberdeen butchers consider them, 
even when crosses, as very inferior, and in fact would never wish 
to see them on their stalls. 

Horses. — For twenty years back, a considerable number of our 
best horses have been brought from the south ; but this practice 
is now generally abandoned, and in some cases the trade has been 
reversed— a circumstance affording pretty strong proof of the im- 
provement of the breed. The original breed of horses in the pa- 
rish was peculiarly hardy and durable, but not equal to the pre- 
sent in point of bone and symmetry. The agricultural societies 
in the neighbourhood have, for a good many years, been giving 
premiums annually for the best horses, which have generally been 
gained by horses from the south ; and, as our horses are usually 
descended from these itinerant prize- winners, the old breed of the

a considerable extent on several of the best farms in the parish.

parish is in a great measure extinct. This change is by some con- 
sidered to have been carried too far, as having a tendency to pro- 
duce a race of horses of a size disproportioned to the work. The 
price of a good horse at present will vary according to his quality 
from L.15 to L.35. 

Sheep — Owing to the extensive improvement of waste and pas- 
ture land, comparatively few sheep are now reared in the parish. 
At present no attention seems to be paid to the breed, one flock fre- 
quently consisting of half a dozen different kinds. The flock at 
Sandlaw of the pure Leicester breed, famed for their size and the 
fineness of their wool, is perhaps the only exception. Besides the 
small number 679 at present reared in the parish, it may be not- 
ed that, for the last five or six years, large flocks from the Hio-h- 
lands come here for winter pasture, on the approach of snow'on 
their native hills. The number thus pasturing at present is 3700 
of the Highland, Strathdown, and Lanark breeds. The total 
amount received for the winter's pasture does not exceed L.80. 

Live-Stock. —Yrom an accurate survey made in December last, 
we are enabled to state the average number of the diff"erent kinds 
of live-stock as follows : 241 work horses; 101 other horses of 
every age and description ; 22 work-oxen ; 558 cows ;— 541 one 
year olds;— 401 two year olds ;— 27 I three year olds ;— 76 four 
year olds; 679 sheep; 191 swine; and 1 goat. 

The following table exhibits nearly the annual amount received 
from sales of live-stock now generally shipped at Banff" for the 
London market : 

271 three year olds, average weight 30 stone Dutch, at 6s. L.2439 0 0 

76 four year olds, do. 40 do. at 7s. 1064 0 0

It ought perhaps to be noted, that, within the last forty years 
great nnprovement has taken place in all kinds of handicraft, our 
masons, wrights, smiths, shoemakers, &amp;c. being generally very su- 
perior workmen.

DistiUery. — About twelve years ago, a distillery was erected on 
the estate of Montblairy, which is still in full and active operation. 
The extensive premises connected with this work are most com- 
plete and convenient, and being situated on an airy and romantic 
ridge of rock, and abundantly supplied with the purest water, the 
whisky produced is of first rate excellence, and greatly celebrated 
for its genuine flavour. This distillery was erected at an expense 
of L.4000, is capable of distilling 40,000 gallons annually, and in 
size ranks among the largest north of the Tay. Mr Alexander 
Scott is proprietor of the works. 

V. — Parochl\l Economy. 
Means of Communication c. — There are no villages or mar- 
kets within the parish. Banff, at the distance of two miles from 
the northern extremity, is the nearest market-town. The post- 
offices at Banff, Abercherder, and Turriff, lie at nearly equal dis- 
tances from the extreme points of the parish. The turnpike road 
leading from Banff to Huntly extends within the parish to the dis- 
tance of four miles and a half, and the turnpike branching off 
from this at the Slacks of Tipperty, enters the parish of Forglen 
on the moors above Montblairy, at the distance of four miles. To 
these may be added one mile of new turnpike leading from Bur- 
reldales, in the direction of Forglen House, making in all an ex- 
tent of nine miles and a half of turnpike roads within the parish. 

• The rates at which tlie grain is calculated in this table, is the average of Banff- 
shire fiar prices, for cominon oats with fodder, and for lest bear with fodder, from 
1829 to 1835 inclusive. No pasture is let for grazing in the parish, so that the ex- 
tent stated in the tables is to be considered as the pasture on which the farmers rear 
their own stock. 

In writing the preceding remarks on the subject of agriculture, the writer has con- 
sulted the opinions of the most iiitelligent practical farmers in the parish, and has re- 
ceived from them many lengthened written communications, the sul.stance of which 
could only lc presented in a very abridged and imperfect shape.

The parish is also intersected in different directions, by the fol- 
lowing commutation roads, viz. road from Portsoy to Turriff, two 
miles and a half: road from Banff to Turriff, by Sandlaw, Au- 
chmbadie, &amp;c. four miles and three-quarters ; branch to the Hen- 
ford, three-quarters of a mile ; road from Banff to Turriff passing 
through Inverichny and Dunlugas, four miles; besides several 
others of smaller extent, amounting in all to nearly seventeen 
mdes of commutation roads. The whole of these roads, with the 
exception of about four miles and a half, have been made within 
the last forty years, and are at present in good repair. No public 
carriages travel at present in the parish, although both a coach and 
a car have been tried at different times, on the road leading to 
Huntly. On the above-mentioned roads, no fewer than sixt°een 
bridges have been erected within the last fortv years, at an ex- 
pense of about L.730. When the last Statistical Account was 
vvntten, the only bridges connected with the parish were those at 
Blacktown, Alvah, and Denmill. The first only stands wholly 
vvithm the parish ; the other two unite Alvah with Kinff-Ed- 
vvard. 

Ecclesiastical State.The church, a plain, substantial edifice, 
at present m good repair, and containing free sittings for 600 per- 
sons, was erected in 1792, and is somewhat inconveniently situat- 
ed near the northern angle of the parish, at a distance varyino- 
from nearly four to six miles, from the extreme points in the 
south-west, south, and south-east. The more remote portions of 
the population, however, are conveniently accommodated in the 
neighbounng churches of King-Edward, Turriff, Forglen, and the 
Ord chapel of Ease, recently erected in the parish of Banff, near 
the confines of the parish of Alvah. 

The manse was built in 1764, and repaired in 1815. The 
glebe IS between SIX and seven acres in extent, and may be valued 
at from L.20 to L 30 per annum. The amount of the minister's 
stipend IS 13 chalders, the one half meal, and the other half bar- 
ley, payable in money according to fiars prices. 
n.rh' fif is the only place of public worship in the

and about 400 communicate annually. There are onlv 5 Episco- 
palians, 1 Seceder, 2 Baptists, and 4 Catholics withinthe parish 
JNo Society for religious purposes has yet been established. The 
probable average amount of church collections yearly for religious 
and charitable objects is about L.38. "

Education x, — There are five schools in the parish. The pa- 
rochial is the only school which has any endowment, with the ex- 
ception of one taught by a female, who receives L. 2 a year from 
Lady Abercromby of Forglen. English reading, grammar, writ- 
ing, mathematics, geography, Latin, and occasionally Greek and 
French, are taught in the parochial school. In other two schools 
conducted by male teachers, the branches taught are reading, 
writing, arithmetic, and grammar. In the two schools conducted 
by females, sewing and knitting are taught along with the elements 
of English reading. The number at present attending the paro- 
chial school is 63. The annual amount of fees varies from L. 8 
to L.20 according to the circumstances of the parents. The pre- 
sent scale of fees is much too high for the labouring-classes. A 
farm-servant, whose yearly income does not exceed L. 10, cannot 
afford to pay annually L. 3 for the education of five or six chil- 
dren. A gradation of fees might be introduced all over the coun- 
try, with considerable advantage. The numbers attending each 
of the other two male teachers, vary from 30 to 40 ; the scale of 
fees is much the same as that of the parochial teacher; and the 
amount received by each is about L.12 or L. 13 per annum. The 
number attending each of the female teachers seldom exceeds 12 
or 15, and the fees, varying from Is. 6d. to 2s. 6d. per quarter, 
may amount annually to about L. 5 to each. The salary of the 
parochial teacher is L. 30, with a contingent interest in the Dick 
Bequest. He has also the legal accommodations. Besides the 
above-mentioned schools, a Sabbath school has been taught in the 
parochial school-room, for more than three years, at the season in 
which regular attendance can be obtained. The number of Sab- 
bath scholars has varied from 30 to 65. There seems to be 
scarcely an individual in the parish upwards of fifteen years of age 
who cannot read, and none between six and fifteen, who cannot both 
read and write. The people begin to set a high value on educa- 
tion, and its corresponding effect on moral conduct is percep- 
tible. 

Savings Banks have been established for several years in some 
of the neighbouring parishes, in some of which considerable in- 
vestments have been made by the labouring-classes from Alvah, 
although the writer has been unable to ascertain the amount. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — In 1764, the average number of 
enrolled poor was 12, and the average yearly allowance to each 



ALVAH. 177 

was 9s. 4d. In 1792, the average number of enrolled poor was 
32, and the average yearly allowance to each was L. 1, Is. 3d. 
In 1836 and 1837, the average number of enrolled poor was 
21, and the average yearly allowance to each L. 2, Is. Average 
amount of weekly collections in one year, L.26 ; do. of penalties, 
L.5, 5s. ; average proceeds from mortcloth, 16s.; interest of L. 120, 
capital at 5 per cent. L.6; do. of L. 55, at 3 per cent. L.l, 13s. 
sale of effects of deceased poor, L.2 ; donations from heritors, va- 
rying from L.5 to L.l 5, L.l 0 ; total yearly amount of poor's funds, 
L.51, 14s. ; average amount distributed to enrolled poor, L.43, Is.; 
balance, L.8,13s. 

Out of the above balance, L.4 are paid to the clerk and precen- 
tor; L.l, 12s. to the church officer ; and the remainder is distribut- 
ed among persons in occasional distress, who are not on the roll, 
or is laid out in defraying the funeral charges of the deceased poor, 
or other incidental expenses. 

Besides the ordinary church collections, amounting on an average 
to L. 26 a year, we have extraordinary collections for charitable 
or religious purposes, varying, according to circumstances, from 
L. 1, lOs. to L.5, 5s. During the eighteen months preceding 
Martinmas last, our collections in the church for the General As- 
sembly's four schemes, for the Aberdeen Infirmary, and the Des- 
titute Highlanders, amounted to L. 17, 16s. lOd. In peculiar 
cases of distress, the relief of which might press heavy on the 
funds of the poor, recourse is occasionally had to subscriptions in 
the parish, which have always been attended with the desired re- 
sult. For two years past, the poor's funds have been relieved of an 
mcidental burden of about L.IO, 10s. a-year, by an annual sub- 
scription from the heritors. 

Having no fund for the poor arising from benefactions suffi- 
ciently large to discourage industry, or excite avarice, applications 
tor parochial relief are generally made with great reluctance. The 
poor think themselves degraded by such applications. 

There is at present only one inn or tavern in the pa- 
rish. 

FueL-Peats, although not so abundant and excellent as for- 
merly, are obtained in those parts of the parish which are farthest 
from the sea. In a few cases, peats are obtained from neighbour-

ing parishes. To those who have a privilege of firing, peats cost 
from Is. to Is. 3d. per cart load, exckisive of carriage; to others 
they cost from 2s. to 2s. 6d. Enghsh coals are procured at Banff 
at from Is. 0|d. to Is. 2d. per imperial barrel.

PRESBYTERY OF FORDYCE, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. JOHN INNES, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Boundaries, §-c, — This parish appears, from the earliest 
times, to have borne its present name. The most satisfactory 
account of its derivation is that which derives it from the two 
Gaelic words, Fuar cold and Deas south ; so that Fuar- 
deas, or, as it is now commonly written, Fordyce, would signify " a 
cold south." This derivation is very descriptive of the character 
of the parish, — the south part of it chiefly consisting of low, wet, 
or moorish lands, far inferior, both in point of productiveness and 
climate, to that which lies along the sea-coast. That the name 
is of Celtic origin is farther evident from the etymology of vari- 
ous other places in the parish, which are unquestionably to be 
traced to such a root, such as Auchmore, the great field or 
declivity ; Kindrought or Keandrochit, the head or end of the 
bridge ; Tillynaught, the turn or ridge of the hill ; Glassaugh, 
the gray haugh ; Durn, round like a clenched fist, &amp;c. 

The parish, including the whole of the quoad sacra parish of 
Portsoy, is of a quadrangular form, irregular, however, and ap- 
proaching nearly to that of a triangle. Its greatest breadth, in a 
straight hne along the sea-coast, is 6 miles ; its least, at the 
southern extremity, 2 miles ; its greatest length, from the mouth 
of the Burn of Boyne to the top of the Knock Hill, 8 miles ; and 
its least, from Logie Head to the same point, 7 miles. The num-

ber of square miles in tliewhole parish is about tJB. It is bounded 
on the north, by the Moray Frith ; on the west, by Cullen, Rath- 
ven, and Deskford ; on the south, by Grange and Ordiquhill ; 
and on the east, by Ordiquhill and Boyndie. 

The general appearance of the parish is irregular, and presents 
considerable variety of hill and dale. In its centre rise the hills of 
Durn and Fordyce, extending continuously, and in a crescent form, 
from north-east to south-west ; while the Knock Hill, in the south, 
rears its head still more majestically, and is seen as a landmark from 
a considerable distance at sea. The height of the Knock is from 
1200 to 1400 feet above the level of the sea, and that of Durn 
about 700 feet. On the top of the former, there is a bank of peat« 
moss, extending to the depth of ten or twelve feet, of comparatively 
little value, from its inaccessibility to carts. 

The coast is rather bold and rocky. It is intersected by two 
bays, that of Portsoy, where there is a safe and commodious har- 
bour for ships, and that of Sandend, where there is a sandv beach 
of about half a mile in length, with a small creek at the Redhyth 
Point, in which vessels of very light tonnage occasionally moor. 
The principal headlands are the East and West Heads, so called 
from their relative positions to Portsoy, and Logie Head, at the 
western extremity of the parish. There are several caves, which 
run more or less into the rocks; but none of them are of any great 
extent. The chief of these are, the Dove Cave, Kitty's Cave, 
the Bow Cave, and Cloutty's Cave, between Portsoy and Sand- 
end, and Findlater Cave close by the old Castle of the same 
name. 

Meteorology. — The temperature of the parish, from its conti- 
guity to the sea, is perhaps less variable, upon the whole, than 
that of others possessing a different exposure. But, from its 
very position in this respect, it is more exposed to the winds blow- 
ing between the north-west and north-east points of the compass, 
than parishes lying in the interior of the country. The climate 
is very salubrious. 

Hydrography — The only streams of any importance are, the 
Burn of Boyne, forming the eastern boundary of the parish,— -the 
Burn of Durn, and the Burn of Fordyce, the former emptying 
Itself into the sea at Portsoy, and the latter into the bay at Sand- 
end. In the neighbourhood of Portsoy, there are several springs 
of a chalybeate character. John Legg's well is the most famed 
in this respect, and is resorted to in the summer months by 



180 



BANFFSHIRE. 



many of the inhabitants, as well as by strangers, who come from 
the country for change of air, and the benefit of sea-bathing. 
There was formerly a loch called Soy, lying in the neighbourhood 
of, and giving name to, Portsoy •, but it is not now larger than a 
mill-pond, and has, for many years, been converted to this useful 
purpose. 

Geology and Mineralogy  — This parish has been long known 
to afford to the geologist much that is interesting. Dr Hutton, 
the talented founder of the Plutonic school, early drew attention 
to it ; and Professor Jameson of Edinburgh, in his volume of 
ineralogical Travels,' has detailed, at considerable length, 
some of its most important geological phenomena. Serpentine is 
the rock which has given to it its chief celebrity, and which is 
known as an ornamental stone, not merely over Britain, but on the 
continent. In the palace of Versailles, it forms some of the chim- 
ney-pieces, and is known by the name of Scottish marble, — the 
name which it most commonly receives from the parishioners. It 
is now, however, seldom wrought on a large scale ; but there is an 
intelligent lapidary in Portsoy Mr Abraham Clark who forms it 
still into a variety of small ornamental pieces, such as obelisks, 
urns, &amp;c. and who always keeps a large collection of minerals for 
the inspection of the curious. 

From the celebrity of this parish, in a geoloaical view, we shall 
notice, as fully as possible, the rocks which occur along the coast, 
commencing at the mouth of the Burn of Durn at Portsov, and 
advancing westward. The first rock which presents itself is a mass 
of serpentine, about 300 feet thick, passing into a syenite, which, 
with a few strata of hornblende, and limestone with granite veins, 
forms the only rock, till we arrive at the other side of the harbour. 
The syenite is in general large, granular, and, in a few instances, 
contains crystals of hypersthene. The granite is also large and 
granular, and seems to be synchronous with the syenite. We 
come next to a bed of white marble, of no value, however, as an 
ornamental stone. It is succeeded by a mass of white felspar 
rock, very compact, which passes in many places into serpentine. 
An alternating system of mica-slate and quartz rock, with a bed of 
limestone, now presents itself, and forms all the coast cliff up to 
the chief deposit of serpentine. The predominating qualities of 

• The writer begs here to acknowledge his obligations to Robert J. H. Cunning- 
ham, Esq. author of Essay on the Geology of the Lothians, &amp;c. who kindly supplied 
the materials of this article, after a minute survey of the parish in 1839.

tills serpentine, the greatest breadth of which seems to be about 
500 yards, are red and green ; and, by the different modes of their 
association, are produced those numerous and beautiful varieties 
of this rock which have been so universally admired. Veins of 
precious or noble serpentine so called from its translucency fre- 
quently occur, also others of calcareous spar, asbestus, amianthus, 
and, in a very few instances, hydrate of magnesia. Diallage, schil- 
ler spar, and magnetic iron ore, are also to be found in small 
quantities. 

As we proceed along the coast, we find strata of mica-slate and 
clay-slate, with occasional veins of quartz, constituting almost the 
whole line to the lime-kilns of Redhyth ; near to which gneiss a 
rock which is but of rare occurrence in Banffshire, presents it- 
self for a short distance, and contains numerous crystals of pre- 
cious garnet. Adjoining to this is to be seen a small deposit of 
red sandstone conglomerate, which rests unconformably upon the 
older rocks, and, like the other red sandstones and rd conglome- 
rates of Scotland, is entirely composed of fragments derived from 
them. The geognostical position of this rock is the bottom of the 
great independent coal formation; and a well exposed junctional 
section is afforded near the coast. Large veins of calcareous spar 
are at some points to be detected. Between Redhyth and Cra- 
thie Point, we meet with various large beds of crystalline lime- 
stone. It is in general connected with clay-slate ; but, from the 
fissured state of the strata, appears to be of little value as an or- 
namental stone. At the old Castle of Findlater is to be seen a 
quartz rock of rather an interesting character, while, between this 
and Logic Head, many other well-marked examples of quartz and 
mica slate are to be found. 

Returning to the mouth of the burn of Durn, and proceed- 
ing eastward, we first meet eccentrically contorted strata of 
mica- slate, containing a few beds of marble; so mixed, how- 
ever, with argillaceous earth, as to make them useless for or- 
namental purposes. Stratified rocks of the same 'general de- 
scription form the whole coast to the mouth of the burn of Boyne, 
where a large mass of distinctly stratified limestone comes into 
view, and, in some places, shows most interesting contortions. It 
may be traced a considerable way up the bed of the stream, and 
forms a part of one of those great bands of limestone, which tra- 
verse the county in a north-east and south-west, direction, and 
which, in many instances, may be followed by the geologist into

the wilds of the Grampian hills. From the appearance of this 
limestone, there is some reason to believe, that were it quarried to 
sufficient depth, it might be of value, and used as a marble. The 
most interesting rock, however, on this side, is a beautiful dis- 
play of graphic granite, so called from its exhibiting when polish- 
ed, characters in many respects resembling those of the Hebrew 
alphabet. It lies half way between Portsoy and the mouth of the 
Boyne ; and, next to the serpentine, has made this place so well 
• known to the geologist. No one having the opportunity should 
neglect to visit this rare and interesting rock. Imbedded in it are 
found in some places large crystals of schorl, and also mica in firm 
radiating masses. 

Throughout the interior of the parish, there is but little oppor- 
tunity for minute geology ; there being an almost universal and 
thick covering of alluvium to obscure the subjacent rocks. Care- 
ful examination, however, shows that the most of the interior is 
composed of those variations of trap, which are comprehended un- 
der the names of common greenstone, syenitic greenstone, hyper- 
sthenic greenstone, and augitic greenstone. Quartz rock forms 
the round-backed eminence of the Durn hill. It is distinctly stra- 
tified, and is inclined at a high angle. Boulders of syenite, of con- 
siderable size, are to be found around the foot of the Durn and 
Knock hills, and in some other parts of the parish. The soil is 
partly a strong clay, partly a clay loam, and partly a light loam ; 
and generally highly productive along the sea-coast, but cold and 
wet towards the south. 

Zoology. — This parish is not distinguished, at present, by any of 
the rarer species of animals. Its general breed of cattle is across 
between the old BantFshire and the Buchanmmble breed. The 
pure Banffshire is now seldom to be seen. The sheep are of the 
Cheviot breed, with a few of the small black-faced. 

 In 1770 a remarkable murrain broke out amongst Ijlack. cattle in this parish, to 
which it may not be uninteresting here to refer. It is still remembered by some of 
the oldest inhabitants, andis spoken of as " the Plague." It is said to have been im- 
ported into Portsoy, by means of some tainted hay brought over in a vessel from 
Holland, where it was raging at the time, and given as food to the cattle here. 
It produced great excitement in the place, and soon attracted the attention of the go- 
vernment, who, to jrcvent the contagion from spreading, sent down orders to have 
all the black-cattle, within a certain distance, immediately slaughtered on their show- 
ing any symptoms of the disease. The owners, however, were indemnified by the 
government, according to the value set upon their cattle by judges appointed for that 
purpose. The place of slaughter is still pointed out ; and for a season, a party of sol- 
diers was stationed at Portsoy to enforce a kiiid of quarantine in regard to all the cat- 
tle connected with it. The first appearance of the disease was heaviness, watering, 
of the eyes, and heat in the horus. This was succeeded by flux, which soon termi« 
nated in death.

There is not only an abundant supply of all the common kinds 
of sea fish, but salmon is to be had regularly in its season ; there 
being a bag- net station for this fishing near the mouth of the 
burn of Boyne. At a former period, lobster- fishing was carried on 
to a considerable extent, by the fishermen here, as well as along 
the whole of this side of the Frith to Inverness ; and small vessels 
visited the different stations on the coast, received the fish that 
were caught, and then proceeded with them to the London mar- 
ket. But nothing has now, for many years, been done in this re- 
spect, beyond a few being caught by aged fishermen, who dispose 
of them in the place. Crabs are found in considerable numbers ; 
and it may be stated that, during the winter of 18b8, when provi- 
sions were so high, the children of several of the poorer families 
derived an important part of their aliment from the common peri- 
winkle, which is to be found so plenteously on our shores. 

Botany.— One of the features of the parish most likely to strike 
the eye of a traveller is the want of wood, This defect, however, 
IS in the way of being remedied. In the east part, the Earl of 
Seafield has a young thriving plantation of considerable extent ; 
while a large space of waste land, contiguous to it, and lying be- 
tween the burn of Boyne and the Huntly turnpike, has been en- 
closed and planted during the past year. The other proprietors 
have been adding to the ornament of the parish, and the improve- 
ment of their own properties in like manner. 

II. — Civil History. 
There are no written records of the early history of this parish. 
It would seem, at least, to have been sufficiently large, compre- 
hending originally Ordiquhill, Deskford, and Cullen. When the 
disjunction of these took place cannot be positively ascertained 
From a decreet of stipend for Fordyce in 1618, it appears to have 
been subsequent to that period. 

Land-oioners.— Yhere are three landed proprietors, the Earl of 
Seafield; Sir Robert Abercromby of Birkenbog; and Arthur 
Duff Abercromby, Esq. of Glassaugh,-the last of whom only is 
resident in the parish. There are plans of the different estates in 
the hands of their respective proprietors. Those of the Earl of 
Seafield are of the oldest date, some of them not having been re- 
newed since 1771. The last plan of the Glassaugh estate was 
made out ui I82I ; while a new survey of Birkenbog was complet- 
ed only two or three years ago.

to whom the cause of education here has been so much indebted, 
were both natives of this paribh. The former, in 1678, be- 
queathed the lands of Redhyth and Meikle and Little Bogton, all 
within the parish, to establish bursaries at the parochial school, and 
at King's College, Aberdeen. They are called, from their founder, 
' the Ogilvie or Redhyth Bursaries." The number of bursars at the 
school is now, from 12 originally, raised to 17 ; the annual value of 
each bursary being 8 bolls of meal, L.l, 16s. 8d. in money, and 
L.1 for school-fees to the teacher. The term of the bursary is 
five years. The number at King's College, from 8 originally, is 
now also 17 ; and the annual value of each bursary is L. 17 Ster- 
ling.  Mr George Smith, who was born in the village of For- 
dyce, having realized a considerable fortune abroad, bequeathed 
the greater part of it for the purposes of education in his native 
parish. He died on his way home from the East Indies in the 
end of last century. The establishment on his foundation com- 
menced in 1801. There are at present nine bursars, each of them 
receiving L.25 a year for board, clothing, and education. They 
are all boarded with the teacher, who receives from the same fund 
L. 40 of annual salary, besides having had provided for him an ex- 
cellent house and garden. The parochial schoolmaster has hi- 
therto held the situation of teacher to " Smith's Bursars ;" but 
the magistrates of BantF, who are the patrons and trustees of the 
establishment, have it in their power to appoint one distinct from 
this. The term of these bursaries is likewise five years. In ad- 
dition to the above bequest, Mr Smith left L. 25 a year to the pa- 
rish minister, for taking a superintendence of the youth placed 
upon the endowment ; and also L. 1000 to aid in erecting an 
infirmary or hospital, either in Banff or Fordyce. 

The Rev. James Stuart,late rectorof George town and All- Saints, 
South Carolina, left, besides other legacies for the advancement of 
education, L. 1200, to endow one bursary at theschool of Fordyce, 
and another at that of Banff, to be enjoyed by boys of the name 
of Stuart. These bursaries commenced in 1810, and the pres- 
bytery of Fordyce presents to them. There are also other two 
small bursaries, amounting together to about L. 9, founded by the 
late James Murray in Butterytack, and to which the kirk-session 
of Fordyce presents. 

In consequence of the distinguished advantages thus posses- 
sed in regard to education, many who received the elements of

their instruction in this parish, have afterwards acquitted them- 
selves in a most creditable manner in the world, or are, at this 
moment, honourably filling stations of an important kind. Sir 
James Clark, presently Physician to Her Majesty, and Dr John 
Forbes, chief editor of the British and Foreign Medical Review, 
&amp;c., and now Physician Extraordinary to his Royal Highness 
Prince Albert, were both educated at the parochial school. 

Parochial Registers. — The registers of discipline have been re- 
gularly kept since 1658, and of baptisms since 1665. The mar- 
riage register does not commence till 1723, since which time it 
appears to have been regular. The following notice of the 
ministers of Fordyce, since the Reformation, is taken from one 
of these registers : — 

Mr Gilbert Gairdn, it is said, ' seldom went to the pulpit 
without his sword, for fear of the Papists." Mr Patrick Darg 
was minister for sixty-three years. David Abercromby, de- 
posed for drinking. William Blair, admitted in 1675, and trans- 
ported to Aberdeen in 1680. James Stuart came from Invera- 
ven in May 1681, and died in three years. Alexander Gallie 
came from Deskford in 1684, and died in 1715. Alexander Ir- 
vine came from Cullen in 1716, and died in 1746. James Law- 
tie, ordained August 1747, and died August 24th 1791. Alex- 
ander Humphrey, ordained March 8th 1792, and died February 
13th 1832. John Innes, present incumbent, admitted from Or- 
diquhill September 6, 1832. 

The following is a list of the Presbyterian ministers in Portsoy 
from Its first erection into a preaching station in 1741 :— viz Mr 
John Yule, Mr James Ogilvie, Mr Thomas Mitchel, Mr Robert 
Og.Iv.e, Mr Burnet, Mr Thomas Steel, Mr Walter Chalmers, 
Mr Abercromby Gordon, Mr James Kellv, Mr William Grant 
Mr Daniel Cruickshank, and Mr Alexander Reid, the present in- 
cumbent, who was admitted June 18, 1829. 

Antiquities.— The remains of the encampment on the hill of 
Durn are still visible ; it would appear to have been originally of 
considerable extent; and is most probably to be referred to the 
time of the Danish invasions. There are other relics which seem 
plainly to show that this parish had been the scene of repeated 
hostile feuds ; some of them perhaps arising from the incursion 
of foreign enemies, and others from the not more welcome visits 
ot Highland freebooters, descending on the richer plains. In addi 
tion to what IS stated in proof of this in the former Statistical

BANFFSHIIU'. 



Account, it may be mentioned that a tumulus was opened at 
Auchmore in 1828, in which was found an earthen urn, contam- 
ing ashes. The urn was placed in a kind of rude coffin, formed 
of'' stones laid together for that purpose. This and the large 
mound raised over it would seem to indicate, that it had been a 
person of distinction whose ashes had been deposited here. And 
there is reason to believe that they may have been those of some 
warlike chief, who had fiiUen in an engagement, of which there is 
a tradition that it took place near to the spot. The above urn is 
now preserved in the museum at Banff. Within a mile of the 
same place, on the brae of Roseacre, in the immediate vicinity of 
Portsoy, no fewer than five urns have been found, containing ashes 
and bones. Two of them were dug up about the beginning of this 
century, and the other three only a few years ago, when that part 
of the field was being trenched over to improve its productiveness. 
They were all, however, broken by the workmen ; but the frag- 
ments, which are still preserved, show that they would have been 
about twelve inches in diameter, and of a proportional depth. And 
in September of last year, there was turned up by the plough, on 
the farm of Ley, another urn, containing some remains of a si- 
milar kind. It was found placed upon a stone with a cover on the 
top, but was also broken. It is now likewise in the Banff museum. 

The old Castle of Findlater is deserving of notice amongst the 
antiquities of this parish. It is the most interesting ruin within it. 
It stands on a peninsulated rock on the sea shore, and still evi- 
dences, that, in its day, it had been a place of considerable im- 
portance. Leslie, Bishop of Ross, describes it although, from 
the tactics of modern warfare, we suspect that the description 
would not now hold true as castrum, loci natura ita muni- 
tum, ut inexpugnabile videatur." Its outer, or north wall, is so 
built as to correspond with the face of the rock; and its windows, 
which appear to have been chiefly on that side, would thus 
look into the sea. The lower apartments, some of which are 
partly excavated out of the solid rock, are strongly vaulted with 
stone arches ; and the south side of the building, which was the 
only one exposed to danger, appears to have consisted of a large 
mass of dead wall, protected by a fosse and drawbridge. Beyond 
this, and at about the distance of 100 yards, there had been ano- 
ther fosse and rampart, as an outwork to defend the castle ; leav- 
ing an intermediate space large enough to exercise a considerable 
number of men. The stones of the buildings, which were in the

south-west corner of this area, and were probably used as stables 
and storehouses, have now been almost entirely removed for agri- 
cultural purposes, on the adjoining farm. The dovecot, however, 
on the top of the hill, still stands in a tolerable state of preserva- 
tion, and continues to be used for its original purpose. 

Sir Walter Ogilvie got leave, in the 18th o James II., or a. d. 
1455, to fortify his Castle of Findlater with a tower and fortalice, 
and all other necessaries for a place of strength. It would appear 
to have been regularly occupied till towards the end of the reign 
of James VI., when it becam.e less necessary for our nobles to seek 
their safety within the walls of their castles. Findlater, at that 
time in the possession of John Gordon, son of the Earl of Huntly, 
was one of the places which refused to receive Queen Mary on 
her royal visit to the north ; and a party of six score of soldiers, 
sent out by the Queen to force a surrender, were one night, while 
lying at CuUen, surprised by him, and all of them either disarmed 
or slain. It soon, however, returned into the hands of its origi- 
nal possessors. There is an interesting tradition prevalent in the 
district, connected with its ceasing to be a family residence. 
While the lady of the castle, it is said, was one day standing at 
an open window holding an infant son in her arms, the child sud- 
denly leapt from her hold, and, falling amidst the foamingwaves and 
rocks beneath, immediately perished. The associations connect- 
ed with this melancholy event were such as to make the place to 
beimmediately after deserted. The district of Findlater, from which 
the castle takes its name, furnished the title of Earl of Findlater to 
a succession of noble proprietors. The title was first conferred 
on James, second Lord Ogilvie of Deskford in 1683, and continued 
to be enjoyed by the male heirs of his body till it became extinct 
in James seventh Earl, who died on the continent in 1811. The 
estates, together with the Seafield titles, then came into the pos- 
session of the present family through the line of a collateral female 
branch ; Lady Margaret, eldest daughter of James fifth Earl of 
Findlater, having married Sir Ludovic Grant of Grant, grand- 
father of the present Earl. 

 May not the name Findlater be traced to a French derivation  Fin-la-terre 
the land s end," is an appellation that is at least descriptive of its locality, bound 
ed as It IS by the sea, and projecting farthest into it on this part of the coast. This 
derivation is, moreover, borne out by the circumstance of Findlater, according to 
the earliest accounts that we have of it, having been first in the possession of a fami 
ly of the name of Sinclair. Now Sinclair is none other than the French name St 
Clair de sancto Claro ; and Douglas in his Peerage tells us that a family onhi. 
name came over with W illiam the Conqueror from Normandy into Britain, and that 
two branches of that family settled in Scotland in the twelfth century

Modern Buildings. — The present parish church of Fordyce was 
built in 1804, and of Portsoy in 1815. A new Roman Catholic 
Chapel was erected in 1829, and an Episcopalian one in the course 
of last year ; both within the town of Portsoy. The mansion- 
house of Glassaugh has also been lately much enlarged and im- 
proved, and now forms one of the neatest and most commodious 
residences in this part of the country. 

III. — Population. 

The population of this parish, as given by the census taken in 
1755, was 3212; in 1782, it had risen to 3425; in 1801, it 
amounted only if the census has been given correctly to 2747 ; 
in 1821, it had again reached to 3245 ; and in 1831, it was 3364, 
of whom 1578 were males, and 1786 females. The population 
in the towns and villages in 1831 was 2023, and in the country 
district, 1341. The yearly average of births for the last seven 
years is 70 ; of marriages, 20. No register of deaths has hitherto 
been kept.

dumb ; 1 dumb ; and 1 deaf. With regard to the last mentioned 
person, it is worthy of notice, that though his hearing, which he 
had in his youth, is now quite gone, he can still hold a degree of 
converse with others, by marking the movements of their lips, and 
will understand most persons to a certain extent, provided they 
speak with deliberation, and allow him to look them in the face.

Wood. — The general kinds of trees are, Scotch fir, larch, and 
ash. With the exception, indeed, of a small thriving plantation 
of the last, in the vicinity of the old Castle of the Boyne, the 
Scotch fir and larch are by far the most predominant description. 
The plantations are duly cared for, and the young woods regular- 
ly thinned from time to time, as they require. These thinnings,' 
however, do not realize much to the proprietor. 

Renf Wac/es, 8c. — The average rent of arable land in the 
parish, per imperial acre, is 16s. 3d. Grazing an ox or cow 
for the summer may cost from L. 2, 10s. to L. 3;' and the 
keep for the winter, a like sum. Grazing a full-grown sheep 
for a year, 7s. 6d. The ordinary rale of a labourer's wages 
per day in summer, without victuals, is from Is. 6d. to Is. lOd., 
and in winter, from Is. to Is. 4d. ; a mason's from 2s. 6d. to 3s. ; 
a Wright's from 2s. to 2s. 6d. ; a slater's from 2s. to 2s. 6d., with 
a proportional rate for the winter. When victuals are afforded, 
sixpence is the usual deduction made from these rates. Male 
farm-servants 1st class receive, exclusive of board, from L. 6 to 
L. 7 in the half year ; 2d class, from L. 4 to L. 5 ; and female 
servants from L. 2 to L. 2, 5s. Flax raised in the parish for do. 
mestic use may be estimated at 5s. 3d. per stone imperial, and 
Cheviot wool at L. J, Is. per do. 

Husbandry. — The common breed of cattle has already been 
mentioned. Not a little has been done of late for its improvement 
by the premiums given for superior stock, both by the Banffshire 
Farmer Club, and the Highland Society. Since 1829 the short- 
horned or Teeswater bull has been introduced ; and the result has 
been a decided advantage, both as regards size and facility of fat- 
tening. With the view also of improving the breed of horses, an 
enterprising farmer lately brought down several fine Clydesdale 
mares, both in symmetry and strength very superior to the ordi- 
nary class of the district. Nor are the improvements confined to 
this department of husbandry. Draining is carried on to a large 
extent, and with great activity. On one farm, which may be given 
as a specimen, there have been completed, since 1837, not less than 
10,175 yards of open ditches, and 17,998 of drains, on the 
plan recommended by Mr Smith of Deanston, besides 1600 of 
march ditches, cut by the heritor. On some of the other farms 
the draining has been nearly to the same extent. The introduc- 
tion of bone manure has been productive of great benefit and it 
:.ensively used. Several new thrashing-mills have beeu

190

recently erected. The farm enclosures are but few ; nor can it be 
said that there is not much room for improvement in regard to the 
farm-buildings. All the later erections, however, have been much 
superior to those which preceded them. The general duration of 
leases is nineteen years ; and it is believed, that few tenants are 
more indulgently treated than those on the estates in this parish. 

Quarries. — There are three lime quarries ; one at the mouth of 
the burn of Boyne ; another on the Glassaugh estate, near to Sand- 
end ; and a third close by that village. The last has not been 
much wrought for some time. There are annually produced at 
the first about 13,000 barrels of lime, and at the second, about 
7000. There is also a quarry of beautiful quartz on the north side 
of the hill of Durn, from which exports are made for the use of 
the potteries in England. It is considered to be peculiarly suit- 
able for this purpose, and to be much superior to the English 
quartz. 

Fisheries. — There are ten fishing-boats in Portsoy, and seven in 
Sandend, with four men to each boat. When the fishermen go 
to a distance to the cod fishing or herring fishing, they use a lar- 
ger boat, with from five to seven men. Each crew of four men pays 
an annual rent to the proprietor of L, 4, 3s. 4d, ; for which he 
supplies them, if required, with a new boat every seventh year. 
They will realize on an average to every man, from L. 27 to L.30 
annually ; but the amount will be more than this, if the herring- 
fishing has been very successful. Salmon-fishing by the bag-net, 
is also carried on at a station near to the mouth of the burn of 
Boyne. The rent to the proprietor for the part of the coast in 
this parish, is L. 12, 10s. The average number of salmon caught 
for last two years was 147, and of grilses, 410. 

Amount of Produce. — The average gross amount of raw pro- 
duce raised in the parish, as nearly as that can be ascertained, is 
as follows : — 

Produce of grain of all kinds, . . . L. 24955 

of potatoes, turnips, &amp;c. • . . 7362 

of hay and pasture grass, .... 5347 
of fisheries, sea and salmon, . . . 2220 

of quarries, . . . . . 1220 

of flax and other miscellaneous produce, . 146 

Total annual value of raw produce, 41,250 

Manufactories, — There is a small rope manufactory in Portsoy, 

• The calculation here made is for the number of boats only belonging to the parish, 
and does not include any extra boats during the herring fishing.

adjoining to the premises which were formerly occupied in con- 
nection with a thread manufactory and bleachfield. There is al- 
so a small distillery ; and a bone, thrashing, and saw mill, driven 
by the same water wheel, has lately been erected in the centre of 
the town. The importing of flax for spinning, which used to be 
to a large extent, has now entirely ceased ; and a most important 
means of support to humble and industrious females has thus been 
withdrawn. 

Navigation. — There are eight vessels belonging to the port of 
Portsoy, the whole registered tonnage of which is 556 of new mea- 
sure. Scotch and English coals are the chief imports. The 
amount of the former for the year, from May 6, 1839, to May 
6, 1840, was 3250 tons, including 200 discharged at Redhyth ; 
and of the latter, 3500 tons. From eight to ten foreign vessels, 
chiefly from different parts of the Baltic, annually visit this port,' 
bringing with them bones, and taking cargoes of herrings in return. 
Besides the export of herrings, grain is also frequently shipped to 
a large amount. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Towns, -c— Portsoy is the chief market-town, at which 
a weekly market is held on Saturday, for the sale of the various 
articles of country produce. It was erected into a burgh of baro- 
ny by a charter granted by Queen Mary in 1550. Its population 
at present is much the same as in 1831, viz. 1525. The popula- 
tion of the village of Fordyce, which was also made a burgh of 
barony in 1499, and had its charter renewed in 1592 to Menzies 
of Durn, is 212 ; of the fishing village of Sandend, 203 ; and of 
New Mills, in the interior of the parish, 30. Besides the accom- 
modation of a regular post-office in Portsoy, and of a daily coach 
running between Aberdeen and Elgin, the parish is now supplied 
with excellent roads, being intersected by these in every quarter 
There are fourteen miles of regular turnpike leading to Banff, Cul- 
len, Keith, and Huntly. The bridges on the roads are substantial 
but the fences are but few. The pier around the new harbour 
of Portsoy, which was built by the proprietor, the Earl of Sea- 
faeld, at a large expense, in the years 1825-28, and which form- 
ed one of the safest and most commodious on the coast, was first 
severely shaken on the north side, by the tremendous sea storm 
of 7 h January 1839 ; and by another, on the 30th of the same 
"ThT '"'"" demolished. Not having been yet rebuilt, the

old harbour is the only one at present used for shipping ; though 
small it is very safe and convenient. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church of Fordyceis centrally 
situated as respects the whole quoad civilia parish, and also its own 
ecclesiastical one, now only connected with it. The distance from 
it to the boundaries, varies from one and a-half to five miles. It 
was built in 1 804, and is at present in a complete state of repair. 
It will accommodate about 1100 sitters. The sittings, divided 
amongst the several heritors, are all free. It is not known when 
the manse was built, but it underwent a thorough repair in 1832. 
The glebe is only two acres and a half, and its value about L. 5. 
But there is a croft of five acres called the vicar's croft, and which 
was mortified in 1595 for the use of the minister of Fordyce, which 
is still enjoyed by him. The stipend is sixteen chalders, exclusive 
of the bequest by Mr Smith already-mentioned. 

The former chapel of ease at Portsoy was erected in 1886 into 
a regular quoad sacra parish church. The new parish, compre- 
hending the town and a district of from one to two miles in cir- 
cuit, lies wholly within the old parish. The church accommo- 
dates nearly 700 sitters. The minister's stipend is paid from scat- 
rents, and an annual allowance of L. 40 by the Earl of Seafield. 
It is guaranteed to the amount of 100 guineas ; and has hitherto, 
to the present incumbent, been made somewhat more. The pay- 
ment of seat-rents, however, even though they be comparatively low, 
is felt to bear heavily on the labouring classes. All that an ordinary 
day-labourer can earn, hardly averaging L. 18 annually, is quite 
inadequate to enable him to pay for church accommodation, and 
the necessary education of his children, in addition to what is in- 
dispensably requisite to their comfortable maintenance. 

There is an Episcopalian Chapel, and also a Roman Catholic 
one in Portsoy. The Roman Catholic Bishop resides at Pres- 
home, in the quoad sacra parish of Enzie. The number of Epis- 
copalians in the whole parish is 95 ; of Roman Catholics, 112; 
of Dissenters, 23, leaving 3134 in connection with the Establish- 
ed Church, of whom 1450 are in the ecclesiastical parish of For- 
dyce, and 1684 in that of Portsoy. Divine service is well attend- 
ed at the two Established churches, unless in very unfavourable 
weather ; and this is also stated to be the case at the two chapels. 
The number of communicants in Fordyce and Portsoy, for the last 
few years, has varied from 480 to 500 to each. There is a parochi- 
al association for religious purposes in both parishes, the object of 



FORDYCE. 



193 



which is to support the schemes of the General Assembly, and to 
provide, at the same time, for local wants, such as Sabbath school 
libraries, cheap Bibles, circulation of tracts, and the like. The 
average amount of annual contributions for these objects may be 
stated as being, for Fordyce, L.16, 10s,, and for Portsoy, L.14, 
10s. 

Education, — There are eleven schools in the whole quoad civi- 
lia parish, of which one is parochial ; one is supported by the So- 
ciety for Propagating Christian Knowledge ; five others have more 
or less aid given to them from voluntary liberality, and the rest are 
entirely dependent on the exertions of their teachers. Greek, 
Latin, English grammar, arithmetic, mathematics, and all the com- 
mon branches of education, are taught both at Fordyce and Port- 
soy. The salary of the parochial schoolmaster is L. 34, 4s. 4id. 
and the annual amount of his school-fees, about L. 30. He has 
no dwelling-house from the heritors, nor any allowance in lieu of 
it, but he has a glebe of ten acres of land, mortified by Thomas 
Menzies of Durn. The salary of the society's teacher in Portsoy 
is L. 15, with L. 5 additional from the Earl of Seafieid, and the 
usual accommodation of a house and cow's grass. His school- fees 
average about L. 20. The same nobleman gives liberally to the 
support of an infant-school teacher, and female teacher, in Portsoy, 
and to three other teachers in different parts of the country dis- 
trict. The annual expense ofeducation at the parochial school 
varies from 10s. to L. 1, according to the branches required ; at 
the Society's school from 6s. to 14s.; and at the grammar school 
of Portsoy, which is unendowed, from 12s. to L. 1, 10s. The 
children at the infant school pay each one penny per week The 
fees for the common branches of female education are much the 
same as those paid at the other schools ; but a considerably higher 
charge is made for music, French, drawing, and the like. 

There are very few between the ages of six and fifteen, who can- 
not either read, or are not learning to read ; and few also who are 
not, at the same time, taught to write. Any persons above that 
age who are unable to read, and of whom likewise the number is 
very small, consists almost entirely of those who have come from 
the Highlands, and settled in the parish, after they had reached 
the years of maturity. The people in general are fully alive to 
the benefits of education ; and the means of attaining these are 
now amply provided, there being no part of the parish that is not 
within a comparatively short distance of a school. No additiona

school is needed ; but it were most desirable that the grammar- 
school in Portsoy were raised to the full status of a parochial one. 
By the extension of week-day schools, in conjunction with the Sab- 
bath schools, the latter of which are under the immediate charge 
of the ministers of the Established Church, and are regularly at- 
tended bv upwards of 400 children, a marked and gratifying im- 
provement has been wrought, more especially upon the nsmg ge- 
neration. 

Literature.-Theve are two subscription libraries in Portsoy, 
besides a Sabbath school one there, and another at Fordyce, the 
books of which are given gratuitously to the children. There is 
also a small select library, consisting chiefly of religious works, be- 
longing to the Episcopalian congregation. These have done 
much good, by diffusing a taste for reading among the parishioners. 

Savings Bank. — A receiving branch of the Banff Central Sa- 
vings Bank was established at Portsoy in 1837. Though it has 
not yet prospered to the extent that could be wished, it may be 
stated as a proof of its making progress, that wiihin the last 
twelve months L. 145 have been deposited, while not more than 
L. 20 have been drawn. The depositors are chiefly of the work- 
intr classes ; and the whole amount of the deposits is now above 
300. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — There are two distinct manage- 
ments of the poor's funds,— one by the session of Fordyce, and the 
other by that of Portsoy ; each session maintaining the poor con- 
nected with its own district of the parish.

Besides the above means of support to the poor, there are about 
40 bolls of meal annually distributed amongst the more indigent ; 
and there is a female benevolent society in Portsoy, which some- 
times expends in coal, clothing, &amp;c. to the amount of L. 30. In 
both congregations, an extraordinary collection is made every year 
for the Aberdeen Infirmary, and for a pauper lunatic fund, esta- 
blished for the benefit of the different parishes in the presbytery, 
and under its immediate management. We regret to say, that, in- 
stead of their being, as formerly, a reluctance on the part of the

poor to seek parochial relief, the reverse is now too frequently the 
case. 

Fairs, — There is a fair All-Hallow Fair held annually at 
Fordyce on the last Wednesday of October old style ; and an- 
other at the same place on the fourth Thursday of November 
old style. Both are for the sale of cattle and sheep ; and the 
first has also been long one of the chief feeing markets of the dis- 
trict. 

Inns. — The number of alehouses and shops where ardent spirits 
are sold in Fordyce and Portsoy together, is no less than 24. 
The eflfect of licensing so many of these has been most injurious 
to the morals of the community ; and the facility with which such 
licenses have been hitherto obtained cannot be too deeply lamented. 
A Society on the principle of total abstinence, has been lately es- 
tablished in Portsoy, and its influence in lessening the prevalence 
of intemperance has already been very gratifying. Though as yet 
of little more than three months standing, it has reduced the 
consumption of ardent spirits to nearly one-third less than it had 
been in the former quarter. Such an influence needs only to be 
sufficiently extended, and made permanent, to drive intemperance 
speedily from the face of our land. 

Fuel— The chief fuel is English coals ; but in the country dis- 
trict, a considerable quantity of peat is used, procured from the 
vicinity of the Knock Hill, and other adjacent places. The ex- 
pense of the latter, per load, may be estimated at '2s. while the or- 
dinary price of coals per barrel is Is. 3d. In the summer season 
the barrel may often be purchased at Is. Id. or Is. 2d. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The valuation of this parish in the year 1690, after deducting 
the public burdens, was L. 8274 Scots, or L. 689, 10s. of Sterling 
money. In last Statistical account, the land rent is stated to be 
nearly L. 4000. It is now about double of this sum, thus afford- 
ing the best of all proofs of the success with which agricultural im- 
provements have been carried on during the last forty or fifty years 
It IS also within the same period, that the excellent turnpikes and 
the other best roads have been made. An extension, however, of 
the present system of draining, the raising of more fences, the in- 
troduction of a superior style in farm-buildings, and the planting 
ot some of the waste parts, would still farther add to the present 
improved aspect of the parish ; and while the active spirit that 
IS now showing itself gives promise of such tneliorations in the

rural economy being rapidly extended, it is hoped that the con- 
tinued appliance of the means of intellectual and Christian instruc- 
tion will, under the Divine blessing, have a corresponding success, 
and be instrumental in making the moral improvement of the pa- 
rishioners to keep pace with the advancements that are made m 
other respects. From the latter source only can flow the true and 
permanent happiness of individuals and communities ; and states- 
men would do well to keep in view, that all national prosperity will 
just be healthy and secure, in proportion as it is based on the cha- 
racter of a moral and religious people

<p>

PRESBYTERY OF ALFORD, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. JAMES GORDON, MINISTER. 



I._TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HiSTORY. 

jvTame.— The name is derived from words in the Gaelic lan- 
guage signifying the Timher Moss, the parish being covered with 

moss and fir. i • i 

Boundaries, Extent, Se.-The medium length of the parish 
from south to north is 5 miles ; the breadth from east to west, 3 
miles. It is bounded on the north, by the parish of Glass ; on 
the south, by Glenbucket ; on the east, by Kildrummy ; and on 
the west, by Mortlach and Inveraven. 

II, — Civil History 
Antiquities.— There is a tradition that one of the Kings of Scot- 
land, Malcolm Canmore, had a residence in the parish, at a place 
called the " King's haugh," on the farm of Spenwell, and it is said 
there are still ruins of a castle to be seen there. I went in con- 
sequence to examine the spot, where I found ruins indeed, but such 
as had evidently been the abodes of later and humbler occupants, 
though the nature and quantity of materials might countenance 
the idea that they had been taken from the remains of some for-

mer building. The place is a small haugh, about three acres in" 
extent, bounded on the north by a steep and rocky bank, upwards 
of 100 feet in perpendicular height. At the upper part, the 
Blackwater enters by a narrow passage through a rock, and runs 
through a deep and rapid channel, having on the south a pre- 
cipitous bank of more than thirty feet, rising into a high and steep 
hill at the lower end. Altogether, if inaccessibility and conceal- 
ment had been the objects of choice, a securer den could scarce- 
ly have been selected. There is on the west side of the eminence 
into which the north bank rises, a deep excavation into the rock of 
from twenty to thirty paces in length. There are, also, some re- 
mains of a chapel and burial-ground on the north bank of the Do- 
veran, near Lesmurdie. 

Parochial Registers. — The oldest register extant begins in 1711, 
and contains registrations of baptisms and marriages, accounts of 
collections for the poor, and distributions, intermixed with the mi- 
nutes of the kirk-session at intervals, till 1747; from which time, 
separate registers of baptisms, marriages, and matters relating to 
the poor's funds have been kept. The first is rather defective, 
owing to the negligence of parents ; the other two are full and com- 
plete. 

Land-owners. — There are three heritors, viz. the Duke of 
Richmond, the valuation of whose lands is L.843, 5s. 2d. ; Cap- 
tain James Stewart of Lesmurdie, L. 283 ; William James 
Grant of Baldorney, L. 150. They are non-resident ; but the 
Duke of Richmond has a shooting-lodge at Blackwater, in his 
deer forest of that name, about four or five miles north-west 
from the church, and Captain Stewart another at Lesmurdie 
Cottage, about an equal distance north from it. 

III. — Population. 

As there is neither town nor village in the parish, the whole po- 
pulation is rural: and in 1831, there were in Aberdeenshire, 412; 
in Banffshire, 566; total, 978; in 1841, 827. 

Number of illegitimate births in the parish within the last three 
years, 8. 

IV. — Industry. 
Several years have elapsed since any survey of the two principal 
properties has been made ; and during that time, considerable alte- 
rations have taken place in the extent of lands under tillage. The ge- 
neral character of the parish is wild and mountainous ; and there is a 
great extent of peat mosses, the remains of the extensive woods with 



198 



BANFFSHIRE. 



which the parish must formerly have been covered, and of barren 
moors. There is, however, a considerable extent to which cultiva- 
tion might still be advantageously extended, though the greater part 
of the parish must continue for ever in a waste state. There is no 
undivided common. A few acres, say ten or twelve, are covered 
with stunted birch of natural growth. There is a small planta- 
tion near Blackwater House, and some ground has lately been 
planted near Lesmurdie cottage and the manse, the whole of which 
does not exceed six acres. 

The real rental of the parish is about L. 2416, 18s. 6d. Ster- 
ling, exclusive of some hill ground, preserved as a deer forest, and 
worth about L.50. 

During the last thirty years, the turnip husbandry, and a regu- 
lar rotation of cropping, — seven-shift, has been introduced. Dur- 
ing the same period, a considerable portion of waste land has been 
brought under cultivation, and some of the more spirited agricul- 
turists are now beginning to subdivide and inclose. Two annual 
cattle-markets were established in 1824, one in July, the other in 
October, both which are well attended. A serious obstruction to 
agricultural improvements is the lamentable deficiency of roads 
and bridges. From the great extent of waste land in the parish, 
the commutation road-money is inadequate to supply this want. 
During the above period, a line of road through the parish, from 
Rhynie to Mortlach, has been opened up ;but, from its not being 
metalled, it is often barely passable, though a principal line of 
communication in the district. 

Manufactures. — There are two small distilleries in the parish, 
bearing a very high character for the excellence of the malt spirits 
produced at them, conducted by Messrs John Taylor, Lesmurdie, 
and James Robertson, Tomnavin. They consume about 640 
quarters of malt annually, and produce 10,000 gallons of spirits. 
Some of the tenants also burn lime with peat, chiefly for their 
own use, but in some cases for sale. 

Fishing. — The various mountain-streams in the parish afford 
excellent trout. Salmon are also occasionally found in the Doveran. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Ecclesiastical State. — Number of families in the parish belong- 
ing to the Established Church, 147 ; Dissenting or Seceding fa- 
milies, 21 ; Roman Catholic families, 2. The amount of stipend 
is L.152, 10s. The glebe is said to contain upwards of 22 
Scotch acres, or about 28 imperial acres, and may be worth L.IO

annually. The manse was built in 1801 or 1802. It is in a to- 
lerable state of repair, and affords about the average accommoda- 
tion of manses. 

Education, — There were four schools last winter, one paro- 
chial, three private. Of the latter, one taught by an old wo- 
man, affords instruction in English reading only. If these schools 
were permanent, they would be amply sufficient. But the emolu- 
ments of the private schools are inadequate to secure the services 
of qualified teachers throughout the year. One good school is 
wanted. Salary of the parochial schoolmaster, L.29, 18s. 9|-d., 
additional do. in lieu of a garden, L.2, 2s. Q/d. ; in all, L. 32, 
Is. d. Fees amount to about L.4 per annum. From session- 
clerkship, &amp;c. say L.2 per annum. This parish is also entitled to 
participate in the Dick bequest. 

Poor — The number for the last three years on the ordinary 
roll and their dependents, 14; receiving occasional aid, 10; total, 
24. To ordinary paupers the amount allotted is L.2, Is. 9d. ; 
occasional aid, 9s. 2d. ; average of both classes, L.l, 8s. per an- 
num, on an average of the last three years. On an average of the 
last three years, the amount raised for the poor from church col- 
lections was L. 10, 5s. 9|d. per annum; from alms or legacies, 
L. 11, 16s. 5d. including the interest of some accumulated funds. 
There is no legal assessment.

THE REV. HARRY LEITH, MINISTER. 



I.— Topography and Natural History. 
Boundaries, -c.-The parish of Rothiemay is bounded on the 
east and north-east, by the parish of Marnoch ; on the south and 
south-east, by Inverkeithnie, Forgue, and Huntly; on the west 
and south-west, by Cairny; on the north and north-west, by

Grange. Its greatest length is from 7 to 8 miles ; its greatest 
breadth from 5 to 6. 

The northern part of this parish is inferior to the rest, both in 
fertility and beauty. About a mile below its confluence with the 
Isla, the Doveran, running eastward, divides the parish into two 
parts, of which the northern follows the course of the river more 
than two miles, the southern near two miles farther. 

Last year a disease, which proved very fatal, broke out in one 
district of the parish, and carried off, in a very short time, the fe- 
male heads of five famihes. It was confined to females, with one 
solitary exception. The male who was seized had a tedious and 
protracted recovery. It was a species of erysipelas, and might 
be designated a diffusive phlegmonous erysipelas, and was said 
by the attending medical gentlemen to be seldom seen, except in 
large hospitals, or on board ships of war. 

II. — Civil History. 

Parochial Ref/isters.These consist of, 1. a register commenced 
1601, which contains the minutes of the kirk-session, the collec- 
tions made for the poor, and the distribution of the same. 2. 
Fragments of a register, almost in loose leaves, without the begin- 
ning. This comprises the transactions of the session from the 1st 
December 1644 to the 16th September 1649. 3. The Book of 
Discipline of the parish of Rothiemay, containing all that was done 
and acted, either in church or session, since the visitation of the 
kirk of Rothiemay by the Presbytery of Strathbogie, 19th Sep- 
tember 1649, Mr James Gordon being minister thereat. 4. The 
minutes of the accounts of the parish church of Rothiemay, 
resting by delinquents or paid by such, as also a note of mor- 
tificatFons and church taxes, laid on for upholding the church 
for several years, together with the minute book of the acts of 
the church-session of Rothiemay, beginning 16th August 1657. 
5. The acts of the session of the church of Rothiemay since the 
1st March 1662. 6. Session register of Rothiemay, beginning 
23d May 1686.— Soli Deo gloria in aeternum. It purports 
to be the register of acts, delinquents, and delinquencies, fines, 
absolutions, and dependencies, which concern the discipline of 
the session of Rothiemay. 7. Register of marriages and bap- 
tisms, in very bad condition, commencing 1677. It is in loose 
and detached pieces, and wants the beginning and end. 8. The 
register of contracts of marriage and marriages within the parish 
ofRothiemay since the 3d of January 1692. 9. The register of

baptisms within the parish of Rothiemay since the 27th May 1693. 
10. The register of the minutes of the kirk-session of Rothiemay, 
containing coljections made for the poor and the distribution of the 
same, commencing 2d March 1717. 11. The register of bap- 
tisms within the parish of Rothiemay, commencing January 1748, 
and of marriages within the parish of Rothiemay from the year 
1750. 12. The register of baptisms within the parish of Rothie- 
may, commencing January 1820. 13. A register of marriages 
within the parish of Rothiemay, commencing 20th January 1827. 
14. Cash-book of the kirk-session of Rothiemay, commencing 
from J 800. 15. Minute book of the kirk-session of Rothiemay, 
commencing 23d August 1827. 

In the old registers and minutes, commencing 1601, and con- 
tinued to 1715, there are two considerable blanks, from 1630 to 
1644, and from 1673 to 1686, for which years there is neither 
register nor minutes. There is a blank in the baptismal registers 
from 30th July 1710 till 1748, and in the marriage registers from 
22d July 1707 till the year 1750. In the minute and cash-book, 
from the 10th April 1735 till 1800, and from 1800 till 1827, 
there are no minutes of church discipline. The registers of this 
parish are among the oldest, if not the oldest, within the Synod of 
Moray. Though they appear to have been kept in general with 
great regularity, yet they have been preserved in a very careless 
manner. Considerable parts of them are lost, and the early bap- 
tism and marriage registers are in a very mutilated state. A fev 
of the parishioners, impressed with the value of these records,, are 
about to raise a subscription to have them rebound. 

Land-owners. — The principal land-owners in the parish are, 
the Right Honourable James Earl of Fife, and William Duff, 
Esq. of Mayen. The valuation of the Earl of Fife's estate is 
L.2728, 17s. 2d., and that of Mayen, L.441, 2s. lOd. 

Mansion-Houses. — The mansion-houses in the parish ar those 
of Rothiemay and Mayen.

IV. — Industry. 
AgricuUure.-li has not been possible to ascertain the number 
of acres, standard imperial measure, in the parish, which are either 
cultivated or occasionally in tillage, nor the number of acres which 
never have been cultivated, and which remain constantly waste or 
in pasture. There are somewhat more than 5000 imperial acres 
in the parish, inclusive both of cultivated, waste, pasture, moss, 
and woods. 

The most profitable way of applying capital to the improvement 
of the waste land would be, by planting, with the exception of the 
moss, the bottom of which, after being completely dug out, would 
make excellent cultivated land. There is no part of the parish in 
a state of undivided common. 

The plantations are very extensive, and none of them natural. 
The average rent of cultivated land per acre is about L. 1 Sterling. 
The real rent of the parish appears to be from L.4000 to L.5000 
Sterling. 

The more recent agricultural improvements consist of draining, 
diking, hedging, and the improving of waste land. 

There is a small woollen manufactory in the parish. 
V. — Parochial Economy. 

Since the old Account was published, fifteen miles of commu- 
tation roads have been made in the parish, and that part of the 
Huntly, Banflf, and Portsoy turnpike which passes through the pa- 
rish. Were the line of turnpike from Inverury to Bognie Brae, 
extended to the Keith and Banff turnpike, past the Milltown of 
Rothiemay, and a bridge built over the Doveran at this village, 
these would add much to the improvement of the district, and 
to the convenience, comfort, and safety of the lives of the parish- 
ioners of Rothiemay on the south side of the Doveran, and of 
others who have occasion to cross the river in this quarter. 

Ecclesiastical State.The number of families in the parish be- 
longing to the Established Church is 259. The number of Dis- 
senting or Seceding [families, 6. The number of Episcopalian 
families, 6. The number of Roman Catholic families, 5. The 
amount of stipend is 15 chalders of victual, the one-half meal, and 
the other half barley, at fiars prices, and L.8, 6s. 8d. communion 
elements. The annual value of the glebe may be L. 10, 10s., and 
the extent nearly eight acres, including the site of manse and gar- 
den. The manse was finished in 1825, and is in good condition. 

Education.— 'Theve are two schools in the parish, viz. the pa-

rochial, and one supported entirely by school-fees. The parochial 
schoolmaster's salary is L. 30, and his fees may amount to about 
L. 20. The schoolmaster is at present session-clerk, the emolu- 
ments arising from which office are from L. 5 to L. 6 Sterling per 
annum ; and L.2 Sterling in lieu of a garden. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is 16. Besides these, there are from twelve 
to sixteen who receive aid occasionally, at an average of L.3, Is. 
8d. per annum. The average sum allowed to each regular pau- 
per per annum is L. 1, 8s. 2d. The average annual amount of 
contributions for relief of the poor from church collections, is 
L.30, Is. 2|d. There are no legal assessments; but the Right 
Honourable Earl of Fife, Alderman Pirie, London, Thomas 
Grant, Esq. at Auchincloch of Rothiemay, and other benevolent 
individuals, have contributed largely from time to time, to relieve 
the distress, and alleviate the sufferings of the regular paupers, 
and other persons in indigent circumstances.

SYNOD OF MORAY, PRESBYTERY OF STRATHBOGIE. 



I- — Topography and Natural History 
Name.—Ta name of this parish is derived from' a Gaelic 
word signifying dark-green, and is descriptive of the appearance 
of the uncultivated parts of the parish. 

Extent and Boundaries.The figure of the parish is an oval, 
with several mdentations. Its greatest length, from east to west, is 
about 8 English miles, and its greatest breadth about 5 ; its su- 
perficial contents about 30 square miles. It is bounded on the 
south, by hills which separate it from Gartly and Rhynie ; on the 
west, by hills which separate it from Cabrach and Mortlach ; on 
the north-west and north, by a glen which separates it from Bo- 
triphnie ; on the north-east and east, by Cairney ; and on the 
south-east, by Huntly. 

The hills run abruptly from the vale of Strath bogie to the east, 

 Drawn up by the late incumbent, the Rev. John Cruickshank.

and stretch westward with increasing elevation and almost unbroken 
range, till they terminate at the shores of the Western Ocean. A 
stranger viewing the parish from certain points would conclude 
that it contains no cultivated land, as he sees nothing but hills and 
moors. But there are not a few rich straths, the principal of 
which is that through which the river Doveran flows, with ser- 
pentine course, from one extremity of the parish to the other, 
having a pretty regular line of hills on each side, from 1200 to 
2000 feet above the level of the sea. 

Hydrography.— Theve are a vast number of springs, of different 
magnitude, around each of the hills. Those towards their sum- 
mits are intermittent, being dry in summer ; those at their bases, 
and in the hollows, perennial. Some of them produce pure water ; 
others are mixed with chalybeate, and other ores, according to the 
nature of the rocks and strata through which they percolate. 

The only river in the parish is the Doveran, already mentioned. 
It rises among the hills of Cabrach, the adjoining parish, and 
flows with great velocity from one extremity of Glass to another, 
through a deep narrow vale, from west to east, emptying itself into 
the Moray Frith, at Banff, after a winding course of about fifty 
miles. 

The prevailing soil over the parish is a light loam, of from six 
to twelve inches deep, resting on a strong impervious bed of yel- 
low clay, mixed with small stones, containing, no doubt, a portion 
of marl, as when trenched up, and intermixed with the soil, it pro- 
duces luxuriant crops without manure. 

Formerly, considerable flocks of sheep were raised and fed ; 
but now, owing to losses in severe seasons, they are reduced to a 
few hundreds, mostly of the black-faced Highland breed. Their 
place is more profitably occupied by small cattle. 

Botany. — Along the banks of the river, the large hills are, to 
a certain height, fringed with natural plantations, consisting prin- 
cipally of : 

Betulaalba Salices Corylus avellana 

Alnus glutinosa Pyrus Aucuparia Rosa canina 

Fraxinus ornus Prunus cerasus Juniperus communis. 

The hills, above the limits of cultivation, are clothed principally 
with : 

Calluna vulgaris Melica cerulea Genista Anglica 

Erica cinerea Myrica gale Vaccinium myrtillus 

tetralix Nardus stricta Aira caespitosa 

Empetrum nigrum Festuca ovina Juncus squarrosus. 

Eriophorum angustifollum Alra caryophyllea 
Eleocharis caespitosa rv fiexuosa

In spring, besides our more common plants, 

Mercurialis perennis Oxalis acetosella Chrysosplenium oppositifo- 

Primula vulgaris Cardamine hirsuta lium 

Asperula odorata Draba verna Viola palustris, &amp;c. 

Anemone nemorosa Tussilago farfara 

Ranunculus Ficaria Fragaria vesca 

The Adoxa moschntellina, Chrysosplenium alternifolium and 
Arenaria verna, as of greater rarity, claim particular notice. The 
first, although by no means a common plant, has been found in a 
wood opposite to the manse, giving out its characteristic and 
agreeable odour. The second, seldom seen in the neighbour- 
hood, in some places unites its golden blossoms with those of its 
brother species, to grace the sides of shaded springs ; and the 
last, although not new to the country, can be found in few places 
in greater perfection than on some serpentine rock in the upper 
part of the parish. 

The long and uninteresting list of the more frequent summer 
and autumn plants, it would be useless to enumerate. The follow- 
ing, however, as of rarer occurrence, seem to deserve more parti- 
cular remark : 

Viola lutea Sedum villosum Teesdalia nudicaulis 

Gentiana campestris TroUius Europeeus Anchusa sempervivum 

Polygonum viviparum Hypericum humifusum Myrrhis odorata 
Pyrola media — — ,™™„ hirsutum Senecio saracenicus. 

.~~~w. minor Cnicus heterophillus 

The three latter are found in the neighbourhood of Apwanly, 
and have at one time been probably cultivated in the garden, al- 
though now growing at some distance from it. 

II. — Civil History. 

It is worthy of notice, that the maternal great-grandfather of 
Henry Lord Brougham, Mr Walter Sim, was minister here about 
the beginning of last century, and was thence translated to the 
neighbouring parish of Mortlach, where he died. 

Land-owners. — These are, the Earl of Fife ; Trustees of the 
late James Earl of Fife ; and Mr Grant, a minor, nephew of the 
late Sir William Grant, Master of the Rolls, proprietor of the 
lands of Beldorney, formerly belonging to the Gordons of Ward- 
house and Kildrummy, of which latter family, Rear-Admiral Sir 
James A. Gordon is a son. 

Two of the « aught-an'-furty " davochs, of the lordship of 
Huntly are located in this parish, but were alienated by gift to 
two of the meritorious vassals of t-he chief of the Gordon family ; 
that of Apwanly to Calder, after the battle of Brechin ; and that

of Cairnbarrow, to a Gordon, who, on that occasion, or on some 
similar warlike expedition, accompanied his chief with his seven 
sons; and when importuned by his noble leader to remain at 
home himself, on account of age, replied, that he would " head 
the whelps himsel', they would bite the better." 

Registers. — The registers of baptism, &amp;c. reach no farther back 
than to 1750, and have been very irregularly kept till lately. 

In several localities, more especially on the farms of Cairnmore, 
and Cairnbarrow, are large cairns, or barrows, composed of stones 
of ordinary size ; but there is no tradition regarding the time or 
purpose of their erection, nor does it appear that they have been 
opened and examined. 

III. — Population. 
The gross population of this parish, at the commencement of 
last century, is said to have been upwards of 1000. 



In 1791, it was 970 

1811, . 721 

1821, . 888 

1831, . 932 

1835, . 980 

1841, . 886 



There is no town or village in the parish. 

The yearly average of births is 24 
deaths, 14 
inarriages, 10 

The average number of persons under 15 years of age, is 345 

betwixt 15 and 30, 271 
30 and 50, 196 
50 and 70, 138 
upwards of 70, 30 

Total, 980 

The number of unmarried men and widowers, upwards of 50, is 33 

women, upwards of 45, . 32 

The average number of children in each family is about . 5 

There are 2 insane young men, and 1 old blind man. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The number of arable acres is computed to be 
about 3600. The extent of uncultivated surface can be ascer- 
tained only by deducting from the gross extent of the parish, that 
under cultivation and wood. From 300 to 500 acres are capable 
of being brought into cultivation, but whether they would pay the 
expense, is doubtful ; in the meantime, they are of some value for 
pasture. Almost the whole of the highest hills are undivided com- 
mon, some of them being appropriated to the several adjoining te- 
nants. The number of acres under natural wood is about 50, con-

sisting of the kinds specified under the branch Botany. One hun- 
dred acres have been recently planted with pine, larch, and hard- 
wood. No attention has been paid to the thinning and pruning 
of the former, and the Jatter is not yet fit for training. There are 
some fine old trees of ash and plane about the old mansion- 
houses of Asvvanly and Beldormy, and the whole scenery about 
the latter is grand and picturesque. The average rent of arable 
land per acre is about 15s. ; some of the poorest worth little more 
than labour and seed, and some of the best worth L. 2. 

The mode of cropping most generally followed is by seven 
shifts, — three years in grass ; two in oats ; one in green crop ; 
and one partly in oats, and partly in bear or bigg, with grass seeds. 
Wheat has been tried, but without beneficial results. The extent 
of the fiirms is small, — from 20 to 150 acres, and there are only 
six of the tenants qualified to vote for a member of Parliament. 
The farm-buildings are generally built with stones and mortar, 
with straw thatch, and all substantial and commodious. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce raised in 
the parish is computed to be as follows : — 

Of oats and bear, with straw, about . L. 5000 

Of turnips and potatoes, about . , ]250 

Of bay, altogether cultivated, about . 1000 

Of pasture, &amp;c., about . . . I150 

Total, I.. 8400 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situate in a small 
green, on the north side of the river, from which it is distant about 
300 yards. From the western extremity of the parish, it is dis- 
tant about five miles, and from the eastern extremity, about three 
miles ; in other respects, it is not inconveniently situate. It was 
built in 1782, and is in tolerable repair; containing good accom- 
modation for 550 sitters. All the sittings are free, and appro- 
priated to the several proprietors, and their tenants. The manse 
was built in 1772, and has been partially repaired more than once, 
and now requires considerable repairs and improvements to render 
It comfortable. The amount of stipend is 15 chalders, half meal 
half barley, payable by the fiars prices of Banff and Aberdeen 
shires, one- third of the parish being located in the former, and 
two-thirds in the latter; besides L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion ele- 
me nts. The extent of the glebe is about 12 acres, and its annual 
value about L. 20. The parish church is the only place of wor- 
ship, and is attended by someof almost every family within the bounds

of the parish ; but some individuals, amounting to about 30, have 
joined the Dissenters. No Episcopalian or Roman Catholic is, or has 
been, in this parish during the last forty years, with the exception 
of a servant now and then. The people, in general, are as regular 
in their attendance at church, as the unfavourable circumstances 
of their situation admit. The average number of communicants is 
about 300. Besides the parochial population, the inhabitants of 
a district of the parish of Mortlach, amounting to about 150, at- 
tend divine ordinances at Glass church, it being much nearer than 
their own. Two annexations have been made to the original pa- 
rish. On the removal of the Bishop of Mortlach in the thirteenth 
or fourteenth century, a large district of that extensive parish was 
annexed to those of Glass and Cabrach. Two chapels erected by 
the Bishop in this district were occupied by a Roman Catholic 
clergyman, so lately as the middle of last century. But not a ves- 
tige of Popery is now to be found, except the ruins of these chapels, 
and the burying-ground about them, which is used by the inha- 
bitants. The Bishop drew a part of his revenue from a farm, now 
in this parish. The other annexation, consisting of several of the 
best farms in the east end of the parish, taken from the then pa- 
rish of Drumdelgie or Peterkirk, now annexed to Cairnie or Bo- 
tary, was made about the end of the seventeenth century, so that 
the original parish must have been small. 

Education. — There is but one parochial school, and one unen- 
dowed. The salary of the parochial schoolmaster is the max- 
imum, with allowance for garden, L.36, 7s. Od., and the amount 
of school-fees, L.28, 3s. 4d. The schoolmaster has the legal ac- 
commodations. 

Poor. The number of individuals on the poor's roll is, at pre- 
sent, 10, who receive from 5s. to lOs. each quarter. There are 
also several other poor families and individuals who receive occa- 
sional aid, amounting in all to about L.20 per annum. This, with 
the very liberal benefactions of the more opulent inhabitants, has 
hitherto prevented the necessity of begging and assessment. The 
annual amount of collections at church is about L.22, and interest 
of money, L. 6. In most cases, there seems to be a disposition to 
refrain from seeking relief from the poor's funds.

PRESBYTERY OF STRATHBOGIE, SYNOD OF MORAY, 

THE REV. W. MASSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Extent Sfc. — The parish is situated about twenty-lour miles 
west from the county town, and extends from north to south about 
4, and from east to west about 3 EngHsh miles, comprehending 
the whole breadth of the county, being bounded by the parish of 
Glass, in Aberdeenshire, on the south, and on the north by part 
of Dundurcus, in Moray. 

The greater part of the parish consists of one beautiful strath, 
situated between two hills to the north and south, with the small 
river of Isla which takes its rise in the west part of the parish to- 
wards Mortlach running through the middle of it. The banks 
of this stream are beautifully adorned with alder and birch trees, 
the natural produce of the country ; several small rills, which fall 
into it from the hills on each side, are covered in the same manner. 

The soil is a black loam, and, in some places, a strong clay. 
The course of the small river Isla, which rises in the west end of 
the parish, and runs through its centre, has been straightened 
since the last Account was drawn up ; by which means a large 
extent of rich alluvial soil, which formerly was covered with bushes 
of alder or overgrown with rushes, is now in cultivation, and pro- 
duces, in favourable seasons, immense crops of grain. Besides 
this very extensive and profitable improvement, a large quantity 
of land, which was in moor or in rough permanent pasture, has 
been brought into cultivation, and chiefly by means of lime, of 
which there is a plentiful supply in the immediate neighbourhood, 
is turning out well, producing in general very fair crops. The 
inclosing of the fields with stone dikes, so pointedly recommended 
in the last Account, has not made much progress, — one farmer 
only having had the spirit to incur the outlay of enclosing his farm 
in this way.

the stipend is 13 chalders, half meal and half barley, Linlithgow 
measure, by the fiars prices of the county. The extent of the 
glebe is six acres; value, L.10. The manse was built in 1776, 
aiwl is in tolerable condition, considering its age. The church was 
built in 1820, and is in most excellent order, the pews and walls 
having been painted, at considerable expense, a few years ago.

PRESBYTERY OF STRATHBOGIE, SYNOD OF MORAY. 

THE REV. WILLIAM DUFF, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — In the old Statistical Account of this parish, it is said 
that Grange takes its name from Grangia, a middle-age term for 
a farm, or country residence. It is certain that this parish was the 
Grange or farm of the Abbots of Kinloss, to whom the greater 
part of it, if not all, was given by William, King of Scots, as may 
be learned by a charter of Strathisla to Kinloss, published in 
Shaw's History of Moray, without date, but with the names of wit- 
nesses attached. It is likely that this charter was granted by the 
King about the end of the twelfth century, or beginning of the 
thirteenth. 

The jolly monks had here a residence, built on the site where 
the church now stands, attracted, it is said, by the beauty of the 
situation. If it was beautiful in these days, it is much more beau- 
tiful now, having been, a few years ago, surrounded by trees and 
shrubs. The mount upon which their dwelling stood is situated 
upon the slope of a brae, which, in appearance, is mostly artificial. 
It overlooks the extensive liaughs or holms on the rivulet Isla, 

beautified principally by the cultivation of its banks, for the 

trees are yet few and far between, the few venerable ashes, elms, 
and planes that surrounded the farm-steadings, having been rooted 
out and sold. On the south of the Isla, there is a wide and long 
brush of larch and Scotch firs, now shooting up, and changing the 
scene a little, from the dull uniformity of unadorned hill and valley. 

Boundaries, Sfc.—The parish is six miles long by five broad. 
It is bounded on the east, by the Knock, a hill, about 1600 
feet above the level of the sea. This hill is cultivated a good way 
up, on all sides. The greater part of its surface is deep peat, 
and heather. On the top the moss is from eight to ten feet deep. 
In the dry year 1826, the surface was burnt round and round, havl 



214

ing caught fire, either by accident or design, nobody knows which. 
There is a very extensive view from it both of sea and land — 
Grange is bounded on the east, west, and south, by the parishes 
of Marnock, Rothiemay, Cairney, and Keith ; on the north, by 
that of Deskford and part of Fordyce. On the northern part 
there are two hills, the Lurghill and the hill of Altmore, now call- 
ed Aulmore, which signifies the great burn. In the centre there 
is the Sillyearn, on which there is an extensive plantation, young 
and thriving. In the southern part there are the Mickle and 
little Balloch, the lower parts of which are now covered with wood. 
Towards the top there could be no hope of a tree, as it is dry, 
rough, and rocky. On the Mickle Balloch, there are several 
graves of some unhappy suicides, marked by a cairn, not sacred to 
their memory, but to tell of their unchristian burial and untimely 
end. Here is the Gallow-hill, too, of which tradition speaks with 
fear and trembling. On this memorable mount the crimmals of 
the district met their ignominious fate. The abbots, as well as 
the feudal barons of those days, had the power to condemn with- 
out appeal, and, it is likely, to execute without justice. 

The Isla is a fine trouting stream. It takes its rise in Loch- 
park, on the estate of Admiral Duff, in the parish of Botriphnie, 
runs through Keith and Grange, and empties itself into the Do- 
veron, in the parish of Rothiemay. 

There are few remarkable springs, unless two or three, that, 
even in the driest season, are ever flowing, and full. The best 
known is the Ladywell, consecrated by some temperate abbot who 
indulged in the soft purity of the fountain. There is also the 
Croik, or the well of the cross, cold and pure, on the opposite 
side of the Isla ; and a few others of less note.

list of the more common plants of the parish :

There is no doubt that Grange was anciently covered with wood. 
In the extensive peat mosses, are found imbedded roots and trunks 
of fir and oak, chiefly of fir, vast quantities of which are cast out 
in the preparation of fuel. There are now large tracts of young 
wood on Lord Fife's estates ; and perhaps from fifty to sixty acres 
on the estate of Sir James Innes, Bart, of Edingight. 

This parish is now generally under cultivation — even the mossy 
and heathy hill of Aulmore is rapidly creeping under the plough. 
This hill is studded far and wide with the cottages of the poor ; but 
much of the lower lands has been cultivated with industry and skill. 
There is a great extent of excellent soil in the parish ; much, 
however, which no tillage will ever make good. The clayey and 
hard till subsoils prevail much, and are much complained of. The 
climate, in general, and particularly on the Davoch of Grange, is 
healthy and bracing. 

II. — Civil History. 

Grange was feued out into small lairdships, upon the appear- 
ance of the Reformation, by the then abbot of Kinloss, and was 
thus put into the hands of a great number of small proprietors. In 
the course of years, the number diminished as the wealth of some, 
and the wants of others, increased. It is said of Alexander DufF 
of Braco, Lord Fife's ancestor, one of the more cautious and eco- 
nomical of the feuars, that, as he was standing on the hillside at 
his residence of Braco, and seeing many of the laird's chimneys 
smoking around him, he remarked to a bystander, that he would 
make the smoke of these houses all go through one vent by and 
bye; and he nearly accomplished his purpose, as four- fifths of the 
whole are now in the hands of his descendants. Edingight, how- 
ever, still remains in the hands of the family of the original feuar, 
and the remainder is in the possession of the Earl of Seafield. 

It is recorded that there were some battles fought in the parish 
between the Scots and the Danes, when the Danes landed at Cul- 
len, in the reign of Donald III.

There is one resident family in the parish, that of Sir James

neral, moral and exemplary, and attentive to their religious duties.

IV. — Industry. 

There is an extensive manufactory of lime in the parish, lime- 
stone being inexhaustible. A great proportion of the small farms 
have their-lime kilns, and in this way the lands have been most- 
ly limed. Bone-manure is now much used, and we have conse- 
quently less fallow and more turnip. Bones seem to answer well 
with the soil ; they produce very fine turnip, and not worse grass. 

On the more extensive farms there are thrashing-mills, a great 
convenience to the farmer. They might still be more general, as 
they could be wrought in the localities, where there is no water, 
by the young oxen, without much deterioration. 

There is a bed of plumbago or black-lead at a place called Seff- 
ffiecrook, a rare mineral in the north. 

Harvest-labour has undergone a great change, shearing having 
now been nearly abolished, and the scythe generally used. 
Oats is the more general produce ; and the most prevalent kind 
at present is what is called sandy-oats. Early Angus and Kil- 
drummy are a good deal used. There are yearly a few fields of 
barley, and some patches of bear or bigg. There is no meadow 
hay ; it all consists of rye-grass, and white and red clover. The 
six-shift in cultivation is generally followed, that is, two years in 
grass, two in oats, one in green crop, and one in oats or barley, 
laid down with grass for hay. 

Farming is as well understood here, and the farms are in as 
high a state of cultivation as any in Mid- Lothian. On the large 
farms of Braco, Floors, Berryleys, Muiryfold, Myrieton, Cantly, 
and others, there are as fine horses and cattle as in any part of 
the county. The farming utensils are of the best make and 
mould. The iron plough is used, and of the best principle. The 
smith and wright work are unrivalled. Our grain, and cattle, 
and pork, meet a ready market in London. Many fine cattle are 
here fed and shipped from the port at Banff for London yearly. 
This is an improvement which was not dreamed of, when the last 
Statistical Account was written. 

There is no village in the parish, but there is a clachan, called 
Nether-mills. There is a sub-post-office, and only one public- 
house in the parish. 

There is a bridge over the Isla, which was " built hy Alexan- 
der Christie, tenant in Cantly, for the glory of God, and the good 
of the people of Grange,'' as the inscription, which was graven 
upon a stone in the bridge, bore. The stone is now supposed to be 



218 



BANFFSHIRE 



in the bottom of the rivulet. It was erected by Mr Christie to 
render the church accessible to the people of Cantly. One hun- 
dred merks were lodged in the hands of the laird of Edingight, to 
be laid out in repairing the bridge. This sum, no doubt, has been 
long ago exhausted. The bridge was originally very narrow, hav- 
ing been only intended for people on foot. To make it passable by 
carts, another of the same size was added to it, in the year 1783, 
the patron allowing the vacant stipend of that year to go to that 
use. The two bridges, many years ago, threatened to separate ; 
but, on the appearance of a breach between them, they were im- 
mediately bound together by bolts of iron. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Grange was separated from Keith in 1618, of which it once 
formed a part. Both of these parishes are church lands. The pre- 
sent church was built in 1795, and contains 616 sittings, allowing 
eighteen inches for each sitter. It is not well situated for the bulk of 
the population, being within amile of one end of the parish. There 
is a Secession meeting at the other end, the oldest, it is said, in the 
north. There are, on an average, in the parish church, about 490 
communicants, of which 155 are male heads of families ; in the 
Secession meeting, perhaps 90, made up of hearers from this and 
the surrounding parishes. Secession minister's stijend is L. 70 
yearly. The parochial manse and otRces were built in 1814; the 
offices are small, but the manse is large and good ; the glebe is five 
acres of good land ; the stipend 14 chalders, Banffshire measure, 
half barley, half meal, with L. 8, 6s. 8d. of communion elements. 
Lord Fife is patron. 

Education, — The school and school-house are limited in extent. 
The salary is the maximum, viz. L.34, 4s. 4d. with a mortifica- 
tion of L. 1, 2s. yearly, and the interest of L. 100, bequeathed 
by the late Mr Bruce, minister of Dunbar. The master has the 
benefit of the Dick Bequest. 

There is a school on the General Assembly's scheme, with a 
salary of L. 25 yearly, and a cow's keep gratis, for the benefit of 
which the people pay a rent, subscribed by the tenants in small 
sums, to Sir James Innes, the proprietor, who refuses to sup- 
ply the croft gratis. The school and school-house were built 
by subscription in the year 1827, by the exertions of the 
present minister. This seminary is of infinite importance in 
this part of Grange, which would be otherwise entirely desti- 
tute of the means of education. There are also two other schools 



GRANGE. 210 

on masters own adventure, so that now every opportunity of 
education is offered to all parts of the parish. The people esti- 
mate, according to its true value, the instruction of their families. 

Poor. — The poor, supplied from the funds, receive quarterly 
each about 5s. or 4s. 6d. This is a very inadequate supply ; but 
they receive much both in food and kindness from their more for- 
tunate neighbours. The farmers are very charitable. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

This parish is much changed since the last Statistical Account 
was written, having now very good roads and bridges, all kept in 
thorough repair. There are several very large farms, beautifully and 
substantially enclosed with limestone dikes, and well-kept hedge- 
rows. The trees and plantations are now numerous and varied, 
and there are many richly cultivated fields, and even farms that 
were at that time heather and morass. On the ftirms of Haughs 
and Mains of Grange, there is a most substantial embankment, a 
mile long, on the Isla, erected at the expense of the heritor. On 
the farms of Cantly, Clerkseat, Little Clerkseat, and Auchinhove, 
the farmers have erected smaller embankments, at their own ex- 
pense, by which much fine land has been protected from the ca- 
lamities of flood and storm. In the year 1829, the flood on the 
Isla was terrific, and the calamity memorable. 

This parish has long been infested by cairds, tinkers, and stur- 
dy-beggars; but It may be hoped that the evil will soon be remov- 
ed by the county police. 

An extensive embankment is about to be raised on the farm of 
Braco.

I»RESBYTERY OF FORDYCE, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. A. ANDERSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
JSfame.— The ancient name of the parish was Inverboindie, e. 
the mouth of the Boindie : the old church, now in ruins, being si- 
tuated near the point at which the snriall stream of that name falls 
into the sea. Boindie seems to be merely a diminutive from Boyn 
the name of a larger stream forming the western boundary of the 
parish. The word Boyn, besides, anciently gave name to two feu- 
dal territories, one named the thanedom, the other the forest oi 
Boyn. The thanedom included the chief part of this parish with 
certain parts of Fordyce and Banff. The forest of Boyn lay both 
to the east and west of the Forester's seat at Tarbriech, on the 
sfm7ik of the Binnhill near Cullen, comprehending a large district 
on the south and east of the parish of Fordyce, marching with the 
thanedom, besides Blairmand in this parish. The burn of Boyn 
thus appears to have traversed the centre of the district compre- 
hended in the two holdings of the thanedom and the forest of 
the Boyn. The word Bouin in Gaelic is understood to signify a 
stream, and thus with aa, a ford, gives name to the parish of 
Boyne, at which there is a stream and a ford. Probably our name 
Boyn, which, in the reign of Robert Bruce, was spelt Bouyn, has 

the same origin. 

Extent and Boundaries.— The figure of the parish is triangu- 
lar. On the south-east it extends about 5 miles, and is bound- 
ed by the parishes of Marnoch, BanlF, and the sea ; on the north, 
from 2 to 3 miles, and is bounded by the sea ; on the west, from 
4 to 5 miles, and is bounded by the civil parish of Fordyce and 
by Ordiquhill. The burn of Boindie forms the march towards the 
south and east, except in reference to the lands of Baldavie, which 
cross the said water, southward ; the burn of Boyn, towards For-

dyce ; and a streamlet falling into the latter, towards Ordiquhill. 
By survey, the parish contains about 5000 acres, Scots measure. 

Topographical Appearances. — The surface of the parish is pure- 
ly of a lowland character, rather elevated, however, above the 
sea-level, except the fine agricultural valley through which the 
Boindie flows, which lies chiefly within the parish. The north- 
ern coast, bounded by the Moray Frith, is chiefly rocky, with a 
portion of sandy beach. At its eastern extremity, there is a point 
of land called the Knockhead, extending into a reef of rocks, vi- 
sible at half-tide, called the Salt Stones. Here the coast turns 
towards the south and forms one side of a bav. The shore be- 
tween this point and the confluence of the Boindie with the sea, 
extends less than a mile, and forms chiefly a beach of sand and 
gravel. 

Climate. — The climate in the lower part of the parish is dry and 
salubrious ; that of the upper district, although removed only a few 
miles, is, on the other hand, wet and cold.f We find the virulent 
influence of the easterly wind on the human frame less complained 
of here than in the country at the opening of the frith, and although 
more steady frost occurs than on the immediate coast of the Ger- 
man ocean, yet we experience sufficiently the influence of the sea air 
to enjoy the most sensible superiority, in this respect, over the in- 
land districts to the south. The most prevalent winds are from 
north-west and south-east ; violent gales are generally from the for- 
mer point. From other causes than their greater violence, it is bv 
north-west storms almost exclusively that great damage is done to 
the grain crops on the coast; while their influence is attested by the 

• It is understood that the grey rat was first imported into this part of the coun- 
try from a ve.sscl wrecked on this reef. Three or four of these ferocious creatures 
were found m the act of iiiliing the sixth of a litter of young pigs ; the former five 
having been killed and devoured. They are manifestly dangerous to young children 

T i he cattle in this last district are very liable to the disease known here by the name of 
crcckles— in England called chine-fellon, which also occurs at one or two points in the 
lower part of the parish where the soil and climate are similar. Its more immediate 
cause seems to be the poverty of the pasture. This is inferred from the fact, that it 
has been wholly banished from a small farm in the lower district, where it used great- 
ly to prevail, since the tenant began regularly to fertilize his fields by an abundant 
supply offish manure. It is a remarkable, as it appears to be a well ascertained fact, 
that those farms on which it prevails in the upper part of this parish, and in the ad- 
joining district of Fordyce parish, have been peculiarly liable to this disease, only 
since the introduction of the sown grasses. Cattle affected with the disease are said 
to be cured by being made to pasture either in a marshy uncultivated situation, or in 
a tertUe held. I hus the origin and the cure of the disease appear to illustrate the bad 
ettects ot the practice, perhaps unavoidable under an alternate system of husbandry of 
cumvating the same grasses in all varieties of soils and climates. 

, 1 robably the cause of this fact is to be found in the usual dryness of north-west 
storms, and their coming oflj- the sea charged with salt spray unmixed with atmo 
spheric moisture which seldom happens in die case of north-east storms. It has been 
discovered that the blighted grain, if even partially filled, is quite available for seed

uniform bend of trees in exposed situations. The parish appears 
to be favoured in respect of the health and longevity of its inha- 
bitants. There have died since 1832, one person above 100, and 
four or five above 90. There is now living a woman in her 100th 
year. A more decisive test is to be found in the proportion of 
persons above 70 years of age. The average over Scotland shews 
about one in 36 who have passed this age. Here the proportion 
is about one in 19.f 

Hydrography. — There are no remarkable springs in the parish 
except common chalybeate, to which description belongs a well 
at the eastern boundary, much frequented in summer by persons 
from the inland districts, with all ranks of whom it is very custom- 
ary to spend one or two weeks annually at the sea side. 

Soil, Sfc. — A portion of the soil, chiefly on the lands of Boindie 
and Dallachy, on the eastern part of the parish, is a black sandy 
mould, of a considerable depth, with an open subsoil, fertile 
and early. The soil of Reattie, Baldavie, and Raggal, in the 
middle of the parish, is chiefly clay and clay loam, part of it highly 
productive. But the larger part of the parish, including a pro- 
portion of the lands specified, is a rather light soil, incumbent on 
a close subsoil, and is of inferior productiveness. 

The direction of the strata is north by east. They have been 
subjected to disturbance of so violent and irregular a nature, that 
it is impossible to assign any particular direction to the dip. The 
prevailing rock in the eastern district is believed to be greywacke, 
which alternates frequently with a micaceous clay slate. Among 
these there occur frequent veins of quartz, the upheaving of which 
may be supposed to have acted as a disturbing force to the strata. 
To the west of the greywacke, hornblende rock, much of it assum- 
ing a slaty character, occupies the sea coast for upwards of a mile, 
and appears in various places upwards of a mile inland to the south. 
Numerous and large boulders of the same rock are found scatter- 
ed along the coast, and prevailing in a south and south-west direc- 

• It is worthy of being recorded that this parish, in common with a large part of 
the north-east coast of Scotland, was exempted from the scourge of cholera. During 
the first fortnight of the year 1837, however, we were subjected to an epidemic, which, 
if the number affected by it be taken into account, was only less serious than the Asia- 
tic scourge. This was the influenza, which scarcely a single family, and few indivi- 
duals here escaped. It was attended by fever, pain in the bones, often violent affec- 
tion of the head, severe cough, and stifling, and great prostration of strength. Within 
the short period mentioned above, eleven persons, most of them old or infirm, were 
cutoflTout of this limited population, and the constitutions of many received a shock 
by which their lives will have been shortened. 

+ The proportion in the sea-faring population is 1 in 19.5 ; in the agricultural do., 
1 in 19.3 ; a striking proof of the operation of a law.

tion inland for several miles.  To the west of the hornblende, 
limestone, apparently of primitive formation, prevails to the west- 
ern boundary. Several veins of it occur in the greywacke, and 
were at one time extensively wrought for burning. Immediately 
beyond the western boundary, on the opposite side of the burn, it 
is still largely and successfully wrought for the same purpose. A 
small granite vein, the only instance of this rock known in the 
parish, appears in the limestone, on both sides of the burn, at this 
point. The limestone here is remarkable for the excessive con- 
tortions which its structure presents. 

A large mass of dikivial clay forms the upper part of the Knock- 
head to the east of Whitehills, and has long been wrought for the 
manuficture of bricks and tiles. Numerous small boulders are 
found m It contaming petrifactions. Among these are Belemnites, 
Cornu ammoms, &amp;c. also occasional impressions of vegetables.f 

:'--The various kinds of fish common on the east coast, in- 
eluding the herring and salmon, frequent the Moray Frith opposite 
to th parish. The herring has visited our coast in rather decreased 
numbers for several years. Haddocks are generally found most 
abundant after a continuance of easterly winds. Durino- several 
past seasons, they have appeared in unprecedented numbers. 

There are found on the shores of this parish numerous stones 
bored and honeycombed in a singular manner. In the holes a e 

stood to be furnished with an acid, by means of which thev exca- 
vate for themselves in the rock the curious habitation which it

Hard-wood trees are vigorous and healthy in the vicinity of the 
Castle of Boyn, where, though so much under the influence of 
the sea air, they prove the perfect congeniality of our climate to 
the more valuable kinds of native wood, when enjoymg the com- 
bined advantages of shelter and fertile soil. The orchard of the 
castle yields abundant crops of the black and red wild cherry. 

II. — Civil History. 
History —There is a manuscript history of the town and parish 
of Banff in the hands of Patrick Rose, Esq. Sheriff-clerk, drawn 
up by his late father, which contains some notices of the ancient 
land-owners of this district. The same gentleman possesses the 
decreet of disjunction of Banff from this parish, of which it for- 
merly was a part, dated 17th June 1635. Plans of nearly the 
whole lands of the parish are in the hands of the noble proprietor. 

By tradition this parish is held to have been the scene of an en- 
gagement with the Danes, at a point near the old church. Ac- 
cordingly, a trench, filled with bones of a large size, is known to 
exist on the north side of the road, about thirty yards from the 
churchyard. The field to the north of the road is at the present 
day known by the name of the " Arrdanes," and another on the ris- 
ing ground to the east is called the " Swurd -danes ;" names believ- 
ed to carrv in them the remembrance of the position of two several 
divisions of the invading Northmen, armed with arrows and with 
swords Was this the battle in which Indulf, the Scottish King, 
was slain, a. d. 968 It took place " in Uttore Boino'." Yet 
it may be fairly doubted whether Cullen, also within the district of 
Boyne, has not a preferable claim to the honour of having been 
the locality of that battle. More probably this was one of the 
engagements under Malcolm II. contemporaneous with those at 
Gamrie and Cruden. The connexion of the patron saint of the 
parish with that king, and the known taste of the latter for budd- 
ing churches, in acknowledgement of his victories, and restoring 
those wasted in his wars, favours the supposition, that the church 
of this parish, dedicated to St Brandon, had owed its existence 
or restoration to his liberality in connexion with such an event as 
is supposed in its neighbourhood.

A7itiquities.—'y Avions military antiquities, discovered here, are 
worthy of notice; some of them, perhaps, connected with the Da- 
nish engagement referred to. To the west of the locality, described 
in connection with it, on the rocky eminences on the north side of 
the road, two circular encampments may still be traced. Immedi- 
ately below the upper one of these, on the southern declivity, stands 
a large perpendicular stone, surrounded by a causeway. A little 
beyond this, on the opposite side of the road, not far from the 
site of the old mansion-house of Buchragie, may be traced the 
huge remains of what may possibly have been a Roman camp. 
On a field lying to the north-east of the manse, and on the south 
side of the Banff and Portsoy road, there may be traced a larcre 
cn-cular excavation, supposed to mark the site of an ancient en- 
campment. In this neighbourhood, and over the district, nume- 
rous flint arrow-heads have been turned up by the plough ; many 
of them of a yellow kind of flint, not found in boulders in this 
part of the country. A short Roman sword was found in the 
bogs of Reattie, and lodged in the armourv at Duff House Iti 
the immediate neighbourhood of the mans offices, on the west 
side, a stone coffin with its contents was found a number of years 
ago and deposited again in its place. A huge red stone is said 
to have stood about this spot before the erection of the office. 

Three Druidical circles are known to the writer in the parish •

Andrew, surmounted by the mitre, appears the legend " Jacobus 
Episcopus Sancti Andre." Near the north-east corner of the 
wood of Whyntie, is an artificial mound, known by the name of 
the Gallows cairn, on which tradition of course testifies that many 
suffered by the righteous or capricious decree of their feudal lord. 
Unplanted avenues have been left, from this point towards the 
mansions of Boyn, Inchdrewer, &amp;c., report says, as a memorial of 
the right enjoved by the surrounding barons in common, of award- 
ing to" their vassals, at pleasure, the crowning and peculiar privi- 
lege of the place. Another gallows cairn exists in the parish, on 
the summit of the Lodgehills, deriving its name from having been 
the place of execution of a man and woman, who conspired m 
putting to death the husband of the latter, farmer in Midtown of 
Badenspink, in Fordyce parish, about the beginning of last cen- 
tury. About thirty yards to the east of the steading, on the farm 
of Dallachy, below the old road, five or six urns, containing the 
remains of bones, were found a few years ago. They were of 
rude construction, except one, which is said to have been well 
shaped, ornamented with diagonal lines crossing each other, and 
surmounted by a lid and handle. The adjoining houses were 
built on a reputed Elf hillock. Another similar urn was found 
a few years ago at the base of a small circular mound, at the lower 
extremity of the plantation extending from Craig-herbs to the 
turnpike road. Many such barrows have been opened in this part 
of the country. There is much reason to doubt whether they 
were Roman. 

Eminent Persons.— The parish had the honour of giving birth 
to Thomas Ruddiman, the eminent Latin grammarian, and libra- 
rian to the Faculty of Advocates, whose father, James Ruddiman, 
was farmer at Raggal. His name does not appear in the paro- 
chial register, which only commences at a distance of above twenty 
years after the time of his birth, said to have been in the year 
1674. Here also was born a personage whose fame is of a 
different character, Mfs Buchan, the founder of a religious sect 

• ThP late Mr James Morrison, tenant of Whyntie obtained unexpected publicity

Parochial Registers, — The parochial register of baptisms ap- 
pears to have been kept with considerable regularity from 1700, 
the date of the first entry, till about 1770. From this period till 
1827, greater or less irregularity and incompleteness are observ- 
able. Till 1827, the marriage register consists of only a few frag- 
ments, having reference to the beginning of last century. There 
is no proper register of burials. Some interesting minutes of ses- 
sion are preserved for the period intervening between 1608 and 
1706.t 

Proprietors. — The Earl of Seafield, who succeeded the late Earl 
of Findlater and Seafield, is sole proprietor. The chief part of the 
land formerly belonged to the family of Ogilvie of Boyn, Baronets. 
This family, in common with the families of Findlater and of Banff, 
the latter of which is represented by Abercromby of Birkenbog, 
Bart. was a branch of the house of Airlie. Sir Walter Ogilvie 
of Boyn, great-grandson of Sir Walter Ogilvie of Auchterhouse, 

The witnesses, whether two or more, appear to have been uniformly of the same 
I n T-Qo" "'" baptized, if a male, for instance, under date April 

JU, " George Allan, in Upper Blairmade, had a lawfull son baptized, called 

Alexander,— Alexander Irvine, minister of Fordyce ; Alexander Law, younger, Alex- 
ander Peterkme in Newmili, and Alexander Ogilvie in Culfin, witnesses." In the 
event of the name bemg an uncommon one, a difficulty would occur in finding the 
qualified witnesses. In one instance, at the baptism of a " Theodore," the parties 
ot this name introduced are designed »' godfathers." 

t Besides an annual payment by the session of 'l.4 Scots « as their proportion of 
the P.esbylery burse of lordyce" for the support of a student of divinity, 1 find col- 
lections, from time to time, for such objects .s the following;-'- The rebuilding of 
K.nghorn harbour,"-" the redemption of Christians taken by the barbarians,'- 

forthe inhabitants of Leith,"-" Auchmedden's harbour at Pennan,"-" building 
an bridge over Dee, at Pittarch." The discipline then in use was rigid, not onlv in 
ih""" employed, but also in the inflexible determinaiion 

with which u was extended over the whole population. Probably the ministry thus 
acquired oo much of a magisterial character, and its influence in training up «' a wil. 
ling people was impaired. But the fault was that of the age, and we would do well, 
avoiding the extreme opposite error of our own times, to unite with the use of more 
winning methods than theirs, some degree of the vigour with which they prosecuted 
tbeir warfare against sin, and by means of which they were the honoured instruments 
of elevating their country to a moral rank unequalled in the history of the world. 
Take an mstance in an act of the Synod of Aberdeen, intimated January 1705 ; " As 
to the restraiMng the horrid sin of drunkenness, appoint ministers and elde.s to deal 
privately withm their bounds with any they know to be inclined to this vice. And 
f they abstain not, that then in the general they intimate from pulpit, without men- 
toning ai,y person s name, that there are some persons in the congregation known to 
nnvrrT' be given to the sin of drunkenness, who have r ot obeved 

ni l. therefore they are again warned to reform,-otherwise if thev

names be intimate from pulpit as grossly scandalous persons . . . l' 
that this act be duly execute by all sessions without respect of persons." " '

and son of Sir Walter Ogilvie of Auclileven, who acquired, by 
his marriage, the baronies of Deskford and Find later, was com- 
mon ancestor of the families of Ogilvie of Boyn, of Dunhigas or 
of Banff, and of Stratherne. He got the thanedom of Boyn by 
marriage, in 1485, with Margaret, daughter of Sir James Edmon- 
stone of that Ilk. Boyn continued in the family from father to 
son, till the beginning of last century, when Sir Patrick Ogilvie of 
Boyn, one of the Senators of the College of Justice, having got 
into great debt, by that means broke up the estate, and it passed 
to the ancestor of its present owner, the Earl of Seafield. The 
family, in males, is now said to be extinct. A superiority on the 
estate is still held by a collateral female branch, in virtue of which 
the husband of the party, Admiral Maitland, stands enrolled on 
the list of freeholders entitled to vote for a member for the county 
of Banff. 

The House or Castle of Boyn, the family mansion on the 
Boyn water, near its junction with the sea, is still standing, 
and, as a ruin, is tolerably entire.  This mansion exhibits 
the remains of considerable beauty and magnificence. In front 
may be traced a double row of gardens and terraces, with 
flights of stairs. The highly picturesque scenery by which it 
is surrounded, such as it is remarked that limestone districts 
are generally distinguished by, is one of the chief objects of 
interest in this part of the country. The ruins of a more ancient 
residence and place of strengthf are still to be observed, remarkably 

 It was dilapidated about or soon after the middle of last century, when the roof 
was removed, and the hewn stones used for buildings in the parish. 

■f When " the gallant Montrose" was carrying devastation among the Covenanters 
of the north, we read that " from Findlater, he marches to the Boyne, plunders the 
country, and burns the bigging pitifully, and spoilzied the minister's goods, gear, and 
hooks. The laird himself keeps the craig of Boyne, wherein he was safe ; but his 
haill lands, for the most part, were thus burnt up and destroyed." 

The minister thus treated was Mr William Chalmer, who was succeeded by Mr 
Patrick Chalmer, he probably by Mr Peter Darling, who died in 1730. The succes- 
sion from that date is as follows ; Mr Alexander Philp, translated from Deskford, 
died 1738; Mr James Anderson, translated to Cullen 1732; Mr James Dunbar, 
died 1785 ; Mr Alexander Milne, died February 1830, having been ordained in No- 
vember 1785. Mr Philp was the first in the Presbytery apparently settled under 
a presentation. When laid on the Presbytery table by Lord Findlater's secretary, 
the obnoxious document seems to have considerably perplexed them. " After rea- 
soning," however, they simply appointed a meeting at Boyiidie " for sounding the 
inclinations of the people," and " moderating in a call." Against this course, the 
patron's agent protested. " The wadsetters, elders, and heads of families" were found 
unanimously for Mr Philp, and, " accordingly, a call was subscribed with great peace 
and harmony." Mr Philp was asked his mind " anent call and presentation." He 
declared his opinion that "a siiritual and ecclesiastical relation betwixt pastor and peo- 
ple could only be fixed by ecclesiastical persons, and founded on spiritual considera- 
tions ; yet having such a clear and legal document of the iiiciiuations of the people of 
Boyndie, and understanding the mind of his brethren, he hopes it will give no of-

situated on the west side of the burn, on a precipitous rock by the 
brink of the sea, below the mansion, to which, under the influence 
of advancing civilization and refinement, it had given place. 

Ogilvies also possessed, probably as wadsets, the smaller estates 
of Baldavie, Culfin, and Buchragie. The foundation of the man- 
sion-house of the last family, with the garden adjoining, may be 
traced on the rockv eminence to the west of the old church. The 
estate of Reattie belonged to a family of the name of Dunn. 

This was one of the first parishes in the north of Scotland in 
which the alternate husbandry was practised. It was introduced 
here about 1754, upon the farm of Craigherbs, by the father of 
the last Earl of Findlater, at that time himself Lord Deskford, 
and heir-apparent to the estates. It is stated in the old Sta- 
tistical Account, however, that, even at the date of its pub- 
lication, at the distance of about fifty years, it had not come 
into general practice. The same Nobleman laid out the older 
plantations in the parish. Those in the eastern part of the parish 
and along the coast side road, partly now removed, with the nu- 
merous clumps adorning the hills of Boindie to the south-east, 
were designed to bound the grounds of a mansion projected by 
Lord Deskford about the present site of the manse. An excam- 
bion had been nearly effected with Lord Banff, in order to acquire 
the hills to the south-west, with the view of completing an amphi- 
theatre of ornamental plantations from three to four miles in dia- 
meter, the whole extent of which would have been in view from 
the commanding situation of the house. Circumstances, however, 
led to the abandonment of this grand project. It is understood 
that the common furze or whins with which the parish is now over- 
run, was unknown here until sown by this Earl of Findlater, for 
the use of the fishermen in curing their fish.-{- 

feiice, if he be removed from Deskford conform to the rules of this Church, he do not 
decline any civil right consistent with the principles of the Church of Scotland, and 
so does accept of said presentation, as giving him a legal right and title to the stipend 
of that paroch." This is a remarkable record, on the one hand, of the views enter- 
tained by a patron at that period of the effect of his right in extinguishing the influ- 
ence of the congregation, and, on the other hand, of the view under which our fore- 
fathers were able to reconcile the acceptance of a presentation to their principles. 

 An anecdote is often related as illustrative of the liberal views of this distinguish, 
ed imjjrover. The overseer of the above farm complained that his labours and anxie- 
ties for the success of the turnip field were frustrated by the thefts of the neighbour- 
hood. That precisely answers my purpose," was the answer, " having learned 
their value in this way, they will not fail to sow a few for themselves." It is appre- 
hended that his Lordship's enlightened views had not extended to the necessary con- 
nection between the right moral and the right economic condition of society." By 
the way, this Nobleman did not maintain his character for liberality in all things 
havmg acted on the principle of tolerating no Roman Catholic tenants. '

III. — Population. 
Dr Webster is said to have stated the population in 1755 at 
994 souls. The baptism register shows an average of about 35 
births annually during the first twenty years of last century, while 
before and after the said date of 1755, the average appears redu- 
ced to 29. According to the present proportion between the po- 
pulation and the number of births, this would indicate the popula- 
tion to have been nearly at the former period what it was found to 
be at last census, and greater at the latter period than Dr Web- 
ster's report makes it appear. But the proportion of births to the 
population must have been greater then than now, in consequence 
of the new agricultural economy employing chiefly unmarried ser- 
vants. This reconciles the state of the fact, as recorded by Dr 
Webster, with the large number«f births appearing at the same 
period in the register, and forbids us to estimate the population at 
the more remote period at above 1 100 or 1200. It thus appears, 
however, that a decrease had taken place during the former half of 
last century. Accordingly, there appears to have been anciently a 
number of hamlets in the lower part of the parish, in places which 
are now wholly depopulated. The introduction of large farms, 
joined to the exclusion of the ffimilies of servants and labourers, has 
operated in reducing the population in the same district to the pre- 
sent day, although more than a compensating increase till recently 
was taking place in the villages and in the moorland district in the 



south end of the parish.

No resident proprietor. 

Our population comprehends three insane, six fatuous, besides 
several persons of marked weakness of intellect ; none deaf and 
dumb. 

The condition and habits of the fishing population of Whitehills 
are deserving of particular notice. They form a society quite dis- 
tinct from the agricultural labourers residing in the same village, 
intermarrying almost exclusively among themselves, or occasion- 
ally with neighbouring seaftiring communities. Hence they may 
be generally distinguished from the agricultural inhabitants by 
their personal appearance, their complexion being clear, and 
their females possessing superior comeliness. The herring-fishery 
has afforded them opportunities of improving their circumstances, 
of which a certain number of them have availed themselves, thus 
attaining a degree of comfort in their dress and in the style of 
their houses and furniture, quite superior to what their forefathers 
enjoyed. Evil, however, has resulted from the herring-fishery in 
the case of those of less frugal habits, who, by the prospect of large 
returns, have been permitted to incur debts to an amount which 
keeps them permanently embarrassed, while it exercises a pernicious 
mfluence on their character and energies. As amongst others of 
the same class, the wife occupies a far more important; position in 
the family than in other situations of life. While, in addition to 
the ordmary domestic duties, she is subjected to the daily labour of 
baitmg the lines and preparing the fish for sale, to her belongs 
the formidable task of carrying the fish to market, often a dis- 
tance of many miles. But the prosperity of the family dependino- 
upon the success with which the last duty is discharged, she adopts 
a tone, and is allowed an influence which in another condition of 
life would appear little consistent either with feminine propriety or 
domestic order. The introduction of the herring-fishery indeed has 
in some degree lessened her pretensions, rendering the family great- 
ly dependent upon a source of emolument in which her exertions 
are httle available; but she still usually claims the disposal of the 
entire proceeds of the white fishery, prosecuted throughout ten 
months of the year, as her exclusive prerogative. 

The seafaring inhabitants of Whitehills are not without some 
ot the faults with which the class are generally chargeable ; these 

47'Jvts't5'W''V/i.f prevailing names are as follows : 117 Watsons

chiefly arising from a natural sanguinenes of temper, and the in- 
fluence, perhaps, of the necessary avocations of the females upon 
themselves and their children, who suff'er from the want of con- 
stant maternal superintendence. But no impartial observer will 
deny to them the credit of being, on the whole, superior to most 
other fishing communities on this coast. Many of them are m- 
telligent, and strictly exemplary in their moral conduct, and re- 
gular in their observance of the ordinances of religion, which has 
hitherto, in the case of a growing number, been, it is believed, 
belter than the form of Godliness. They show no disposition to 
cast themselves, or their aged parents and relatives, upon public 
charity ; but, regarding it as a degradation, submit to privations in 
order to avoid it. They are cleanly in their habits ; and fish cured 
by them consequently bears a superior reputation. Most of them 
having their stated customers, it is not uncommon for them to 
deal with these by means of an open account, enjoying the confix 
dence of their employers, and supplying their commodity without 
the formality of a noisy cotitest about the price. 

An advance in civilization has here had its usual influence in 
postponing the period of marriage, which, in fishing communities, 
usually occurs at a very early stage of life. The males continue 
to form a part of their father's family, until they have acquired the 
means first of paying a fourth share of a herring-boat and nets, 
and then, from the proceeds of this, of building and furnishing a 
house ; and, among the more respectable, the building, indepen- 
dent of the furniture, has generally amounted to L.IOO. They 
have not continued fully to maintain the high reputation for purity 
established for them by the fact, that, till within the last twelve 
years, there had scarcely been an illegitimate birth in the commu- 
nity in the memory of man. 

The farm-servants are the class of the population, morally and 
economically, in the least satisfactory state. They are hired half- 
yearly, in the public market, on a purely commercial principle ; 
and many of them seldom re-engage to their former masters. A 
small number of them appear regularly in their places in the house 
of God or form any proper connection with ecclesiastical society. 
Beino- mere sojourners in a parish, and unknown to minister or 
peopFe, they are not missed ; and, were it otherwise, feel them- 
selves independent of public opinion. 

The presbytery of Fordyce, some time ago, and the synod of 



BOINDIE. 



233 



Aberdeen, and various other synods more recently, have taken up 
the subject, especially recommending that diets of catechizing 
should be held after each half yearly term, for enabling the mi- 
nister to form an acquaintance with persons having come into the 
parish, and to recommend to them such means of improvement as 
the parochial institutions may present. This, or some similar ar- 
rangement, is demanded by the circumstances of the class under 
review. The labouring classes suffer generally from their want 
of opportunity for retirement; but many of the farm-servants are, 
besides, subjected to the powerful demoralizing influence of young 
persons being congregated in a bothy, or out-kitchen, without 
either the humanizing ties, or the wholesome restraints, of the do- 
mestic institution. Again, in many cases, their early education 
has been extremely defective ; so that although they can in some 
sense read, they want the inducements to the pursuit of knowledge 
possessed by those to whom the art is a ready channel of knowledge, 
in the use of which no sensible effort is required. With wages va- 
rying from L.5 to L.7 in the half-year, they not unfrequently enter 
into the married state ; their wives and families being left at a 
distance without active employment, and without the benefit of 
paternal authority and care. Not having the means even of sup- 
plying their offspring with adequate food and clothing, they cannot 
suitably educate them. At the earliest possible age, their children 
are sent to earn their subsistence, when, removed from all parental 
oversight, and often neglected by their employers, they perhaps 
lose any good they have learned, and they grow up to furnish new 
instances of the evils of which we complain.

gcat public benefit. i i   a

The common breeds of cattle in the parish are the polled Buch- 
an kind, or a BanflPshire breed with horns. A Teeswater bull was 
introduced by John Wilson, Esq. Brangan, in 1829; and there are 
now four or five bulls of this kind in the parish, and consequently 
a considerable stock of the cross-breed is now reared, which are 
fed off when risino- three or four year old for the London market. 
A large flock of sheep is kept on the farm of Mill of Boindie ; but 
this stock i not kept on any of the other farms, there being no range 
of suitable pasture for the purpose. It would contribute to the im- 
provement of the light dry soil in the low part of the parish to con- 
sume turnips on the ground with sheep, as it would tend to obviate 
the badeff'ectsof freqiientcultivationonsoilofthischaracter. Wheat 
husbandry has been practised to a considerable extent within the 
last ten years in the low part of the parish, but it is again very 
mueh abandoned. Independently of the soil being generally a 
sand, the climate on an average of years is incapable of maturing 
other than an inferior sample of this grain ; and the coarseness of 
the straw is a serious objection in a cattle-feeding district. The 
Chevalier barley is also generally abandoned, being found, although 
a fine sample, to be too late, and to yieid a deficient return in 
quantity. 

Leases now granted are for nineteen years. The houses of the 
farmers are generally very superior. The offices have undergone 
a great improvement of late years. For houses the landlord ge- 
nerally allows one or two years rent in whole at the expiry of the 
lease. The more recent erections have far exceeded this allow- 
ance. For the improvement of waste land L.5 per acre is allow- 
ed, for which 7 per cent, per annum is charged from the tenant. 
Several of the farms on the coast are enclosed with dry stone 
dikes. One of the principal improvements executed in this parish 
of late years, has been the reclaiming of the marshes lying along the 
course of the burn of Boindie, chiefly on the farm of John Milne, 
Esq. at Mill of Boindie. Frequent draining, chiefly with stones 
from the sea-beach, about the size of road metalling, is now going 
forward on the farms of Alexander Rainy, Esq. factor for the Earl 
of Seafield. Alexander Murray, Esq. at Whitehills, intends to put 
the same plan in practice on his fields at Lochside, which, when 
thoroughly drained, will confirm the reputation of his farm as the 
most highly improved in this district.

The most spirited improvements have gone forward on the 
farms of Reattie and Little Reattie, extending to about 400 
acres Scots, during the occupancy of the present tenant, An- 
drew Longmore, Esq. Within the last nineteen years, besides 
building houses to the amount of L.2000, he has executed the 
following improvements : 50 acres of waste land reclaimed, at 
an expense, he estimates, of L.12 up to L. 24 per Scots acre; 
30,000 ells of stone draining, for 10,000 of which the stones 
were quarried; 8000 ells of tile-draining; 8000 ells of thorn 
hedges planted last season ; 6000 additional to be planted next 
season, plants furnished by the proprietor; a formidable improve- 
ment in blasting and removing above 3000 tons of hornblende 
blocks sunk in the soil, the removal of some single stones costing 
above L. 5 ; an expensive but productive improvement on the 
haugh land, in connexion with the cutting of a new course for the 
burn. The climate upon Little Reattie is sensibly im.proved, and the 
harvest considerably earlier, since the draining was executed. Turf 
drains have been employed on this farm and elsewhere, but have 
been found very temporary in their operation, being destroyed es- 
pecially by moles. The system of frequent draining now com- 
menced, if carried forward, promises to effect a great transforma- 
tion on the agricultural chaiacter of this parish, a large part of 
which is rendered infertile by wetness. A vast quantity of fish re- 
fuse, bone-dust, and sea-weed is annually added to the self-pro- 
duced manure of the farms. The burning of kelp was prohibited 
by Lord Deskford, with a view to the agricultural improvement of 
the parish. Irrigation is practised on the meadows at the mouth 
of the burn of Boindie; and as that stream has considerable flats 
along its course, and its waters are of a fertilizing nature, perhaps 
the practice might be advantageously extended. Not a little slo- 
venliness is still displayed in the management of farm yard dung. 

The liberal encouragement afforded by the celebrated improver. 
Lord Findlater, Lord Deskford, has doubtless had an important 

good farming. It extends to nett 60 acres Scots, with 20 acres of pasture, chiefly 
bnks. The 80,1 is chiefly very light, though dry and kir.dly. For several years after 
J830, when It fell into the hands of the present tenant, he sunk more than the rent 
annually. It now yiMs, on an average, not less than 200 quarters oats and barley

influence to the present day in the improvement of the parish, 
through the instrumentahty of the wealth which it enabled the fa- 
milies who have been long in possession to acquire. The Noble 
family who now inherit the estates also pursue an encouraging and 
judicious system of letting, exacting a suitable rent, but never 
ejecting an industrious tenant who makes a fair offer, or agrees to 
pay the rent fixed by a competent valuator. 

Fisheries. — The herring- fishing is prosecuted at Whitehills from 
the beginning or middle of July to the beginning or middle of Sep- 
tember. From nineteen to twenty-seven boats, each containing 
four men, have fished here since 1830. They have caught, on an 
average, during these years, only ninety-six cranes per boat, and 
have been paid on an average, lis. per crane. A boat equipped 
for sea costs L. 66 ; and a fleet of nets, L. 75. The former will 
run twelve years ; the latter only six. Salt is brought chiefly from 
Liverpool ; barrel-wood from Norway. The herrings when cured 
are exported to Germany and Ireland. The West India market 
is now lost, but as a compensation the prohibitory duty in Russia 
has lately been reduced to a moderate amount. One cooper and 
three women wait on shore for each herring-boat. Coopers' wages 
are 12s. per week; in the fishing season, 14s. and 15s. Women 
receive for gutting and packing a full barrel, 7s. At this rate, with 
a sufficient supply of work, they might earn 5s. by a day's work. 
The expense of curing a barrel of herrings is about 8s. besides the 
price of the fish. The abolition of the bounty is supposed to have 
bad no bad effect, — the trade being still under the regulation of 
Government inspectors, who withhold their mark from an inferior 
article. 

Sixteen boats, each carrying four men, during the remainder of 
the season, fish for haddocks, &amp;c. They go to sea at least 120 
days in the year, and average not less than twelve dozen haddocks 
per boat each day, which will amount to about 23,000 dozen had- 
docks per annum, besides about 10,000 cod, ling, and skate. Had- 
docks will bring lOd. per dozen, and the other fish from 4d. to 5d. 
each. The above is a moderate calculation. The fishermen re- 
ceive about two bolls meal annually for their refuse, and about an 
equal value for black oil manufactured by themselves. The fish 
are usually sold within the district, but, in consequence of the great 
abundance caught last season, most of the boats carried a cargo to 
the south, as it was customary to do annually before the introduc- 
tion of the herring-fishing.

About L. 60 yearly rent, on an average, is drawn by the pro- 
prietor from the fishing-boats. The proprietor furnishes each crew 
with one boll meal and 100 merks Scots, to aid in buying a nevv 
boat once in seven years, if required. For about an acre and a 
quarter of potato land, and the use of the boat, a crew pay L. 5 
yearly rent. A good boat for the haddock-fishing costs L. 17, 
and will run eleven or twelve years. Instead of receiving the above 
allowance, and giving up the boat to the proprietor at the end of 
seven years, the fishermen are now agreeing to pay L. 4 per an- 
num each crew for right of fishing, including potato land, with 
freedom to possess boats of their own. Men above sixty years of 
age are allowed to fish free of rent. Muscle bait is brought an- 
nually from Sutherlandshire. Price of a boat's cargo, L. 3, be- 
sides the labour of gathering. 

The lobster-fishery is prosecuted by five or six boat crews by 
means of basket-nets, and the produce sent to London periodical- 
ly in the well smacks. 1100 lobsters were caught last season, price 
4d. each. The large number which die greatly increase the price 
to the purchasers. 

The salmon-fishery has been carried on of late years by bag- 
nets at Blackpots, near Whitehills, with progressively increasing 
success. The average produce from 1834 to 1837 amounted to 
about L.225 yearly. The salmon are either iced, or boiled and 
pickled with vinegar, and forwarded to the London market. 'J'he 
rent, understood to be paid by a subtenant for the fishery carried 
on here and at Findochty, may be estimated for the Boindie sta- 
tion, at L. 50, one-half of the whole, besides twenty per cent, on 
the fish caught above a certain amount. 

The average gross amount of raw produce may be estimated as 
follows : — 

1600 acres grain, 3 qrs. per acre, at L. I, 7s. 6d, including fodder, L. 1 1,000 0 0

Manufavtures — A manufacture of bricks, tiles, &amp;c. is carried 
on at Blackpots, near Whitehills. Eleven hands are employed in

the manufacture in the summer season. In winter, four or five 
are employed in preparing the clay. In consequence of this last 
operation being insufficiently performed, the work had fallen into 
disrepute, and therefore probably has not been a remunerating con- 
cern for a considerable time, but, under careful management, it 
has again begun to command a large trade. The introduction of 
tile-draining may be expected still greatly to increase it. Price of 
roofing tiles per hundred, 7s. 6d. ; draining do. without bottoms, 
3s. per hundred ; bricks, 3s. 6d. per hundred. 
- The bleaching and preparation of threads and stockings for the 
market was formerly prosecuted extensively at old bridge of Boin- 
die, in connection with Messrs Robinson's manufactory in Banff. 
Both the manufactory and bleachfield, with other similar works in 
this part of Scotland, have been long ago abandoned. At the 
above point there is now a saw-mill in full employment, — work 
executed at Is. 3d. per 100 feet of wood. Several miles up the 
stream, on the Boindie side, there are two meal-mills. On the 
burn of Boyn, there is a wool carding mill, largely employed, chief- 
ly for country work, where the weaving and dyeing of cloth is also 
carried on. On this stream, there were formerly two lint-mills ; 
one is abandoned, and the other little employed. Proceeding down- 
wards from these, there is a flour and barley mill, and a meal mill. 
The astriction of lands to particular mills is now in the course of 
being abolished ; and the multures have been commuted into a 
money payment with the rent. The multures, including service 
on some lands previously to this change, amounted to one-eleventh 
of the whole grain milled. The charge for milling oats is from 6d. 
to 8d. per boll. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town 8fc. — The nearest market-town on the east side 
of the parish is Banff, at the distance of a mile and a half from 
the boundary. Portsoy stands at a like distance on the west. In 
each of these, there is a post-office and a ready market for grain, 
and in the former, for the produce of the dairy. The only village 
in the parish is Whitehills, already described. The turnpike road 
from Banff to Portsoy extends above three miles within this pa- 
rish from east to west ; and the branch which diverges from it to 
Keith and Huntly en the left, extends a distance of about two miles 
to the point at which it joins Ordiquhill. These, and the several 
county roads pass the streams by which the parish is bounded by 

• In connection with it, there is r.ow a pit for kyanizing wood, &amp;c. 



bridges mostly sufficient, at ten separate points. There is a small 
harbour at Whitehills, having ten to eleven feet depth of viater at 
spring-tides, serving for the landing of herrings in the fishing sea- 
son, and admitting two or three vessels for the exportation of her- 
rings, and the importation of salt, coals, &amp;c. There is anoth.er 
small harbour a little to the east, near to the brick-work at Black- 
pots, intended for the exportation of tiles, and like the former, af- 
fording accommodation for the prosecution of the herring-fishery. 
At this point, too, the salmon- fishery is carried on. 

Ecclesiastical State —The church is situated at the distance of 
five miles from the south-west extremity, and nearly two miles 
from the north-east extremity of the parish. Since the erection 
of the new church at Ord, with which 250 of the population, in 
the remote district, have naturally connected themselves, the 
situation of the church is sufficiently central and convenient. It 
was built in 1773, when the old church, the ruins of which still 
exist in the burning-ground, near the sea, was abandoned. It is 
comfortably fitted up, and in good repair. 

There was left, in the year 1809, by the Rev. James Stewart, 
a native of the parish, and a clergyman of the Church of England, 
in the late American colonies, in trust to the kirk -session and 
the presbytery, a sum now amounting to L..391, intended to yield 
L.1, 10s. of an annual gratuity to each of six poor persons of the 
parish, and the same allowance, as a bursary, for defraying the 
education expenses of six poor boys of the parishioners. 

The church affords accommodation for 600 persons. The poor 
are freely accommodated in the seats attached to the land, and in 
a gallery held in trust by the kirk-session. The manse was built 
tor the first time, in its present situation, a year or two after the 
removal of the church. The old manse is still habitable, not less 
so than its successor, which is in an insufficient state. The olcbe 
extends to about seven Scots acres, and may be worth L 7 per 
annum. The stipend is 15 chalders ; equal parts of meal and 
barley. It has ranged, since the commencement of the writer's 
incumbency in 1830, from L.172 to L.284. L.8, 6s. 8d. is al- 
lowed for communion elements. 

There is no chapel of ease, or other additional place of reli- 
gious worship, within the boundaries of the parish ;t but there was

erected, in 1834, at Ord, in the extreme west end of Banff parish, 
a chapel, intended, partly, for the accommodation of the remote 
parishioners of Boindie, in which a minister has been ordamed, 
enioving an allowance of L.20 per annum from the Royal Bounty. 

The whole adult population, with more or less regularity, at- 
tend the Established Church, except, attending the chapels ot 
Dissenters of different denominations, 35 ; Methodists, 20; Epis- 
copalians, 12 ; Roman Catholics, 2 ; comprehending in all, 69 
individuals, and about 20 families. 

Divine service is generally well attended, except by the farm- 
servants, and a certain number of families of the lower classes, 
chiefly in the village, sunk in poverty and its attendant evils. We 
certainly are strangers to the nearly uniform decency with which 
some parochial communities are blessed, whilst, at the same time, 
we are not without some development of spiritual good. Two 
facts may be stated, well fitted to illustrate the state of society 
thus described. During the writer's incumbency, there have been 
resident in the parish eight women, all except one having fami- 
lies, deserted by their husbands. On the other hand, there are, 
in the village of Whitehills, from twenty to thirty men, who can 
conceive and utter an extempore prayer with no less fluency, and 
with little less propriety, than most educated ministers, and of 
whom it may be testified, without claiming for them graces in pro- 
portion to their gifts, that, on the whole, their conduct is not in- 
consistent with their profession. There are several meetings for 
prayer and mutual instruction, of which the writer can speak, 
among the members of the Established Church ; and he believes 
thev have been the means of advancing true religion in some de- 

gree in the parish. 

The average number of communicants is about 400, besides a 
proportionate number in the population attached to the Ord Chapel. 

There is a parochial association for religious purposes, partly 
subordinate to a presbyterial association extending over the district. 
The funds are collected quarterly. A moiety of them, not ex- 
ceedino- one-half, are applicable to religious objects within the pa- 
rish, as providing books for the Sabbath schools, educating poor 
children, providing Bibles for the poor. The remainder is des- 
tined to be applied for the support of the Bible Society, and such 
of the General Assembly's schemes for propagating the Gospel 
at home and abroad, as the contributors may select. There has 
been collected, during the three years of its existence, on an ave- 



BOINDIE. 



241 



rnge, about the sum of L. 15 annually, of which above two-thirds 
have been applied to rehgious objects not in the parish. 

There are, besides, two collections yearly, for a Presbyterial 
Pauper Lunatic Fund, and for the Aberdeen Infirmary ; the two 
together amounting on an average to L.7 Sterling. The whole 
sum collected in church for charitable objects, is about L.45 per 
annum. Subscriptions are occasionally entered into, to procure 
a supply of fuel and clothing for the poor, which have amounted 
usually to L.12 or L.15. Besides, there have in recent years 
been large contributions for church extension, new schools, and 
for the starving Irish and Highlanders. 

There are three schools in the parish taught by masters, an in- 
fant school, several dame schools, and numerously attended Sab- 
bath schools. The parochial schoolmaster has the minimum sa- 
lary, with the legal accommodations ; but enjoys an interest in the 
admirably administered bequest of the late Mr Dick. In addition 
to the common branches, he teaches Latin, Greek, geography, 
and the higher branches of mathematics. The two additional 
schools, one of which is at a distance of nearly three miles towards 
the upper extremity of the parish, and the other is at Whitehills 
within a mile and a half, receive, from the liberality of the pro- 
prietor, L.8, 9s. 6id. divided between them, and also three bolls 
of meal each. Each possesses an excellent school and school- 
house built by subscription. There is no need of an additional 
school, except it be for females. Those already in existence might 
be more conveniently situated. Indeed, since the erection of a 
new parochial school in the adjoining district of Banff parish, two 
onlv, judiciously placed, might be made to serve the wants of the 
whole community. The union of the two small salaries attached 
to he additional schoo s might, in this case, warrant the reduction 
of the fees, which, although varying only from 2s. 6d. to 3s 6d 
per quarter, are obviously too high for the means of a poor la- 
bourer having to support a family out of an income of from L.lO

it must exercise an important influence in obviating the unfavour- 
able circumstances, .already adverted to, to which the children ot 
a fishing population are peculiarly subjected. 1 he number at- 
tending school, including infmt and dame schools, and an evenmg

170 ; Bible class, ditto, about 80. 

The writer does not know any of the community betvveen six 
and fifteen who cannot read or write. There are a few individuals 
above fifteen, who, to all useful purp6ses, labour imder this inabi- 
lity. This applies to the resident population. Persons are fre- 
quently met with among the migratory class of farm-servants whose 
education has been totally neglected. 

Library.- K parochial library, consisting of an excellent collec- 
tion of works in religion and general knowledge, has been in exist- 
ence a good many years. It contains 164 volumes. The sub- 
scription is now only 6d. half-yearly. 

Friendly Society.-k Friendly Society was in existence in 
WhitehiUs ; but it was broken up and the funds divided on the 
passing of the act for new modelling this class of institutions 

Savings BazL-The parish schoolmaster acts gratuitously both 
as parochial librarian and as receiver of deposits for the Bantt 
Central Savings Bank, on the national security system. 1 he hsh- 
ermen usually deposit their savings in considerable sums, a ter the 
herrino-.fisherv, in the common banks, and the other great labour- 
ing class, who might have something to lay by, are generally 
strlmcrers in the parish, and therefore not likely to make deposits 
in it,°even were they inclined to save,— hence the privileges of this 
institution have not been extensively embraced. 

Poor's Funds.— About 40 persons have been accustomed to re- 
ceive stated parochial relief. At present, the number on the roll 
is 35 About five persons generally are in the receipt ot a weekly 
allowance at the rate of Is. each. A quarterly distribution takes 
place, at which sums of 4s. and 5s. are allotted to the whole poor 
on the roll The funds arise from, church collections annually, 
L 36, 10s. ; interest of money, L.32, 13s. 4d. This does not in- 
clude Mr Stuart's bequest, recorded above. It is a peculiarity 
in our parochial economy, that the poor funds of the hshing and 
the general population have always been kept distinct from each 
other The seafaring community occupy a gallery by themselves, 
which admits of the separation of their contributions. Part of the

Riim, from which the interest above stated arises, is lent out in 
their name. 

Fairs. — A fair for the sale of cattle, &amp;c. has been lately insti- 
tuted at Ordens, in the western part of this parish, appointed to 
be held eig'ht times in the year, and promises to be a great accom- 
modation for the disposal of fed stock in the winter season. 

Public-Houses. — We have five public-houses or spirit-shops in 
Whitehllls, and three in the landward district.f Three, instead of 
eight, would be a liberal supply for the real wants of the public. 
However decent the character of their occupiers, the remaining 
five, in a public view, are to be simply regarded as so many li- 
censed traps, spread over the parish for the demoralization of the 
unwary traveller or neighbour. 

Fuel. — Peat fuel, from the mosses lying to the southward, is still 
chiefly used for the upper district, and, to a considerable extent, 
even on the coast. A mixture of peat and wood is generally 
used for smoke-drying haddocks. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

The agricultural state of the parish has changed very remarkably 
since the date of the last Statistical Account. The small posses- 
sions, with their thatched cottages, which were then numerous, have 
now chiefly disappeared, and spacious fields surrounding insulated, 
and in some instances elegant buildings have taken their place. 
The alternate system of husbandry has become firmly rooted. In- 
stead of 60 acres of turnips, we have now 500. Thrashing-mills, 
not one of which had then been introduced, are now descending 
even to the class of crofters. The farmers have grown in wealth 
and luxury, and, in a corresponding degree, in a spirit of honour-i 
able enterprise and activity. 

The fishing population have also been greatly advanced in their 
outward condition. 

It is to be lamented that no similar improvement has taken 
place in the condition of a large part of the labouring classes, if we 
except the Increased cheapness of clothing having greatly advanced 
the comfort of many of them under this head. Elderlv single wo- 
men, for instance, are probably in a worse situation than at the date 

• Were the tendency not continually cliecked, the pauperism of the parish would 
be greatly increased. There are a number of persons removed a single grade in their 
circumstances above those on the roll who would at once become a burden on the pub- 
lic funds. When widows are left with families, a public subscription is generally 
raised, by which, well husbanded, most of them are carried through their difficulties. 

t One respectable person, the principal spirit vender in the village, has since 
abandoned the trade.

of last Account. When able for occasional field labour, earning by 
this 8d. a day without food, in the summer season they have chiefly 
to depend for winter sustenance on what they can save from this pit- 
tance, a week'sindustrious application to the spinning wheel yielding 
them only about sixpence. The male agricultural labourer when 
married enjoys a bare supply of the necessaries of life, and, when 
overtaken with premature old age, has too often to struggle with 
this, aggravated by the ills of poverty, or to receive a stinted al- 
lowance, or to occupy an unwelcome place in the family of a child. 
The rate of remuneration for the several branches of labour is 
probably beyond all direct human control. Yet much might be 
done by proprietors, masters, and philanthropists generally, to 
ameliorate the condition of this class, by taking every means to 
break up their migratory habits, by subjecting them to the influ- 
ence of domestic instruction and restraints, by the introduction of 
the hind or cottar system on large farms, instead of the demoralis- 
ing influence of the bothy, by encouraging saving habits and the 
use of savings' banks, by destroying or better regulating the sys- 
tem of hiring in markets, and by using every effort to remove those 
licensed temptations to drunkenness and improvidence in markets 
and otherwise, to which reference has been made. 

On the whole, it is to be hoped that the morality of the com- 
munity has advanced since the end of last century. Many things 
then openly practised are now esteemed more or less disrei3utabe, 
as, for instance, among many, the drunkenness then esteemed so 
large an ingredient in good fellowship, profanity, smuggling, &amp;c. 
It is to be lamented that licentiousness, lying, and reckless habits 
of backbiting, have hitherto given little evidence of being on the 
decline. By the blessing of God's Spirit, on the grand and ap- 
pointed instrument of human regeneration, we trust that another 
similar period may see these and all kindred obstacles to man's 
well-being effectually overcome. 

• The present and the former Statistical Account contain testimonies to the happy 
working of this system in districts where it has long prevailed. See Accounts of Lang- 
ton, Hutton, Berwickshire ; l.inton, Roxburghshire ; also Sir John Sinclair's Ana-

PRESBYTERY OF FORDYCE, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. JAMES GARDINER, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography AND Natural History. 
Name c. — " Rathven," according to the writer of the last 
Statistical report of this parish, " is said, by those conversant in 
the Gaelic language, to be derived from two original words, the 
one signifying ' brake' or ' fern,' and the other ' rock, eminence, 
or hillock.' " In support of this derivation he adds, " that there 
is a spot in the neighbourhood of the church called Brakenhaugh, 
and a farm named Rannachie, i. e. the Brakenfield." This, how- 
ever, is quite an erroneous derivation of the name. The spelling 
of the term in Gaelic is " Rath-bheann," or " beann," — the for- 
mer meaning a " circle of stones," and the latter " a hill" or 
" mountain." That this, therefore, is the true etymology of the 
name, we have only, in order to satisfy ourselves, to look to the 
Benhill, which overhangs that part of the parish situated towards 
the south, and examine the numerous cairns found in various 
parts of it, especially on the Bauds, which shall be duly noticed 
under the head Antiquities. 

Extent and Boundaries.~T\\\s parish is situated in the district 
of the county named Enzie. It extends along the coast, from east 
to west, 10 miles, and nearly 5 in breadth ; and is bounded on the 
north, by the Moray Frith; on the east and south- east, by the 
parishes of Cullen and Deskford ; on the south, by Deskford and 
Keith ; and on the west, by Bellie. It contains 27,000 Scotch 
acres, or 33,750 imperial, and 42} square miles. Annual value 
of the real property in the parish, as assessed in 1815, L.7336. 

Topographical J ppearances.— Its figure is rather irregular, but 
approaches nearer to the form of a parallelogram than any other, 
though the square diminishes considerably towards the east. There 
IS an extensive range of hills stretching from the Benhill on the 



246 



BANFFSHIRE. 



south-easf, wiiich bounds the southern part, of the parish westward. 
Ihe Benhill, the highest, is 945 feet above the level of the sea, 
and serves as a land-mark to the fishermen, being seen by them, 
according to their calculation, at fully fifteen leagues distance. 
1 he other two hills, Maud and Adie, are of less elevation, and co- 
vered with heath to their summits. They extend, in a westerly 
direction, to the boundaries of the parish.  The Benhill has been 
much improved of late by the Earl of Seafield causing a carriage- 
road to be made, which, by a circuitous course, leads to its top, 
the view from which, in all directions, is most extensive and com- 
manding. Previous to 1744, this hill was covered with heath, but 
It was then richly planted to the very summit. 

Climate, and Soil — The greatest part of the parish has a north- 
west exposure, and suffers severely from the storms which blow 
from that quarter. The most prevalent complaints are rheuma- 
tism and catarrhs, brought on by the alternations of heat and cold, 
particularly among the fishermen, who are exposed to all vicissi- 
tudes of weather. It may be remarked, that, in the year 1794, 
notwithstanding the large population of this parish, no medical 
man thought it worth his while to settle within its boundaries. At 
present, there are two surgeons and one apothecary in the village 
of Buckie. 

Surface c-c. — The surface may be described as rather moun- 
tainous, with some low-lying ground of good quality and conside- 
rable breadth from the sea shore to the base of the hills on the 
south. The hills, as already mentioned, are covered with heath 
or moss, and afford very little pasture, the soil being either hard 
gravel, or of a mossy character resting upon a bottom of clay 
very retentive of moisture. On the low grounds, part of the soil 
is a light loam, rich, with a clay bottom; in another part, it is ra- 
ther thin, and rests on a red kind of clay formed from the debris 
of the old red sandstone, but at the same time is very productive. 
Along the sea-shore it is sandy, and covered with an immense 
quantity of small stones, evidently rounded by the action of the 
sea, which, during ages long gone past, must have flowed over this 
part of the country. 

Hydrography. — The Moray Frith bounds this parish from east 
to west, towards the north, for ten miles. There is nothing re- 
markable with regard to the nature of the water, as to colour, 
temperature, luminousness, saltness, or the flowing of the tides. 
The shore abounds with ISIedusae, or sea-jellies. The depth of

water at the village of Findochtie, the property of Earl Seafield, 
is 24 feet, and the breadth of the entrance into the bason, which 
is well protected, 270 ; thus affording sufficient water and safe an- 
chorage, if converted into a harbour, for ships of very considerable 
tonnage. This parish is intersected by several rapid running 
burns or streamlets, all of which have their source in the high 
grounds within its bounds, and empty themselves into the sea at 
Portgordon, Buckie, and GoUachie. There are several medici- 
nal springs. One of these is situated at Burn of Oxhill, and is 
much resorted to by people from the inland parts of the country 
with their children, while labouring under hooping-cough ; but the 
benefit resulting from it is believed to be more imaginary than 
real, as change of air is always known to be of great advantage in 
this complaint. There are also two chalybeate springs, one at 
Gollachie, and the other in the immediate neighbourhood of New 
Buckie, much frequented, particularly the latter, by people who 
come thither for sea-bathing, and drinking the water of this well. 
At Findochtie, a spring of a purgative nature, issuing from a rock 
considerably within flood-mark, is occasionally drunk by the inha- 
bitants, and those who reside in the neighbourhood. There is an 
abundant supply of perennial spring water, free both from the car- 
bonates of lime and iron. 

Mineralogy. — The prevailing strata along the coast bordering 
this parish, are rocks of the primitive Neptunian series, viz. gneiss, 
mica-slate, clay-slate, and schist; and the direction of the strata 
is from north-east to south-west; and the dip of the rocks is north- 
west and south-east. The angle of elevation varies at different 
places. Adjacent to Buckie, where the rocks have been laid bare 
by the action of the sea, some are perceptible at an angle of about 
2.5°, others at 90°. At the north-east part of the parish, near the 
burn of CuUen, the old red sandstone commences, which is in con- 
junction with greywacke to the eastward; and the thickness of 
that bed extending to the westward is very great, particularly 
where the new red sandstone is found overlying the old red sand- 
stone formation. The new red sandstone appears at that point in 
nearly horizontal strata, and dips to the south and south-east. 
The greywacke here, and along the coast, alternates with clay and 
mica-slate, which reposes on the greywacke. The bed appears 
to be of considerable thickness. Its direction is from north-east 
to south-west ; and it is the prevailing rock within the parish. 
But the greywacke i« protruded through the clay and inica-slate 



248 



BANFFSHIRE. 



at different points alonon the coast, and in the interior as far to the 
westward as Buckie. There the clay and mica-slate alternate 
with thin veins of coarse limestone, till a short way to the west- 
ward of the town, where the greywacke and greywacke-slate alter- 
nate with seams of mica-slate, and veins of limestone of a reddish 
colour, arising from the oxide of iron. Within the village of 
Buckie, there is a part of the old red sandstone formation seen re- 
posing on clay-slate and mica-slate, which is again reposing on 
greywacke. This micaceous clay-slate is of a greyish colour, and 
covers a great part of the interior of the parish. Towards the 
south, it crops out at different points, and is quarried for roofing 
slates by the Duke of Richmond at Tarriemount and Upper Al- 
dyleth, and by Sir James Gordon, Bart, on his estate of Letter - 
fourie. Limestone is found and wrought at Nether Buckie. At 
Tarwathie the red sandstone already mentioned is quarried, and 
used in building. Indeed this is the only quarry of the kind found 
in the whole county. A very pure quartzy rock is found in the 
Benhill, the same as at the hill of Durn, near Portsoy. None, 
however, of the beautifully variegated serpentine, alternating with 
beds of marble, talcaceous schist, and hornblende rock, as found 
at Portsoy, occurs here. Boulders or detached masses of granite 
and gneiss, intermixed with mica, having their surfaces and sharp 
edges smoothed down and rounded, evidently by the long-conti- 
nued friction of water, or action of the air, are of frequent occur- 
rence along the sea-shore, and the Bauds moor. These boulders 
are sometimes found at the distance of many hundred miles from 
the rocks from which they have been originally detached, as is the 
case here, no granite appearing within the parish. These trans- 
portations point out the agency of currents and immense irrup- 
tions of the ocean passing over the land in particular directions, 
and with such impetus as to carry along these large and ponde- 
rous bodies. From the position of these masses, the direction of 
such currents can often be ascertained with great certainty. An- 
other most remarkable feature of this part of the country is, that 
the upper or vegetable soil is so densely mixed with water-worn 
stories, that, in many places, under a rotation of excellent crop- 
ping, these stones appear to form nearly a third part of the sur- 
face. They are chiefly of quartz, although intermixed with no- 
dules of lime, felspar, and mica. The fel.spar, as being in com- 
bination with potass, is easily affected by the action of the atmo- 
sphere, and a considerable portion of it annually dissolved, which 



RATHVEN. 



249 



forms a very productive soil. The nodules of lime produce the 
same effect. 

Zoology. — The ordinary indigenous wild animals found in this 
parish are, the fox, the polecat, the weasel, the ermine or stoat, 
the black-rat, now nearly extirpated in many parts of Scotland by 
the brown or Norway rat, common ; the water-rat, the short-tailed 
field-mouse, the common shrew, and the mole. The roe-deer is 
found wild in Lord Seafield's woods, near the manse; and the fallow- 
deer, the hare, the rabbit. The hedgehog, though rare in this 
county, was found last summer both on the farm of Rannes and 
in the woods at Letterfourie. The otter breeds every season 
among the rocks at Findochtie, and in the bogs of Rannes. Along 
the shore, the porpoise, the grampus, the spermaceti whale, and 
the seal, are frequently seen. The latter is very destructive to the 
stake-nets during the salmon-fishing season. 

Birds.--i:\ie osprey, or sea-eagle, is occasionally seen. The 
kite, commonly called the glead, is known to build on the lofty 
trees at Rannes and Cullen House. The kestrel, the goshawk, 
the merlin, and the sparrow-hawk, with the hen-harrier, not com- 
mon. The long-eared owl, the barn-owl, and the screech-owl 
are common. The great ash-coloured butcher-bird, though rare, 
has been seen in the woods of Letterfourie. The raven, the hooded- 
crow is very abundant, and destructive to the eggs of the partridge 
and pheasant ; common crow, jack-daw, and carrion-crow. 

The starling, the thrush or mavis, the blackbird, the missel- 
thrush, and the fieldftire, with its companion, the red-wing, oc- 
cur here in large flocks on the approach of winter. Among the 
strong-billed smaller birds, we have the yellow bunting, the snow- 
bunting, the common bunting, and the black- headed bunting. The 
bullfinch,greenfinch, chaffinch, goldfinch, brown-linnet, mountain- 
linnet or twite, and house-sparrow are common. 

Among the soft, or subulated billed birds, we may enumerate 
the red -breast, red-start, sedge-sparrow, white-throat, pied-wag- 
tail, yellow-wagtail, seen on the banks of small burns ; whin-chat, 
stone-chat, and sky-lark, the common wren, golden crested-wren, 
willow-wren, common creeper, and the hedge-sparrow. The 
great titmouse, blue titmouse, cole-titmouse, and long-tailed tit- 
mouse, though rare, have been seen in the manse garden. 

The summer birds of passage are, the house swallow, martin, 
swift, generally visible from the 1st to the 12th of May ; stone- 
curlew, landrail, cuckoo, and goat-sucker or night-jar, occasionally 



250 



BANFFSHIRE. 



seen at nightf\ill, flying with great rapidity round the manse and 
garden. 

Birds of Game. — The common grouse, partridge, pheasant, 
much on the increase, as also the wood-pigeon. The rock-pigeon 
is found in considerable numbers amongf the high rocks between 
the villages of Findochtie and Portnockie. 

Grallce. — The heron, water-hen, woodcock, common snipe, 
jack-snipe, lapwing, golden-plover, ringed-plover, grey plover, 
sanderling, and the oyster catcher. 

Aquatic Birds. — Cormorant, scart or shag, kittywake, common 
gull, black-backed gull, and the herring-gull. The eider-duck, 
velvet-duck, teal-duck, common wild -duck, and coot. The red- 
breasted-merganser, razor-billed-auk, puffin, little grebe, and 
northern diver, in severe winters. 

Fishes. — In the burns of Tynet, Gollachie, and Buckie, salmon 
is sometimes taken, but only when there is a high flood. A con- 
siderable number, however, is taken in the stake-nets at Porteasy 
and Portgordon, on their passage to the mouth of the Spey. 
The common trout and the eel are the only other species found 
in these burns. 

Along the coast, the following are taken ; viz. gowdie, haddock, 
cod, whiting, coal-fish, the fry called podleys, colmeys, and sethes, 
ling, tusk, halibut, erroneously called turbot ; plaice, flounder, 
sole, sea-perch, and mackerel. The herring, most abundant in 
this parish some years ago ; pilchard, and sprat or garvie ; stur- 
geon, taken lately in a stake-net at Portgordon; skate or flaire ; 
thornback, distinguished by a row of strong spines running along 
the back ; sea-dog, accompanying the shoals of herrings, and used 
as manure ; wolf-fish, sword-fish, and lump-fish, or lump-sucker, 
with the John Doree, taken occasionally. 

The lobster, and crab or parten, are abundant; and, about 
forty-six years ago, the fishers on the coast entered into a contract 
for five years, with a London company, to fish for lobsters. The 
Company furnished the skiffs and tackling, and were reimbursed 
by instalments. They took all their lobsters at 2d. a-piece, pro- 
vided they measured six inches from the point of the nose to the 
end of the boss ; and, when under that size, two were esteemed 
equivalent to one. The success of the white and herring-fisheries, 
and the amazing quantities of lobsters caught on the coast of Caith- 
ness, which the company purchased at a considerably lower price, 
put an end to this branch of industry.

The oyster and mussel are not found on this coast. The lat- 
ter, however, is brought from the Friths of Cromarty and Dor- 
nock, lodged among the rocks here, and used as required for bait 
by the fishermen. 

Botany. — In this parish, no particularly rare plants have been 
found. The peach-leaved bell-flower, and giant bell-flower, are 
seen in great beauty in the woods around CuUen House. The 
hemlock, foxglove, agrimony, brooklime, spotted dead nettle, sea 
tree-mallow, common mallow, hoary plantain, and lesser spear- 
wort, occur in the parish. 

Along the shore there are, sea-spurry, sandwort, common sea 
milk-wort, scurvy-grass, and squill. 

In the pleasure-grounds of Culien House, which mostly lie in 
this parish, there is a great deal of very valuable wood, consisting 
of oak, ash, elm, beech, larch, and Scotch fir. Some of the 
beech'es, in point of height and dimensions, may vie with the finest 
in Scotland. The grounds are extensive, and possess much na- 
tural beauty, and are intersected with many lovely walks, and kept 
in the highest order. The utmost attention has been paid by Sir 
James Gordon, and Mr Gordon of Cairnfield, in pruning and 
thinning their plantations ; and they have now the pleasing satis- 
faction of seeing their respective properties highly ornamented 
and improved, by a great variety of thriving forest trees. The 
grounds around their mansions are laid out with great taste, and 
neatly kept. 

H. — Civil History. 
Eminent Men. — The only man of learning and genius, as far 
as can be discovered, a native of this parish, was the celebrat- 
ed Dr Alexander Geddes. He was born at Pathheads, in 
the year 1737, and was descended from parents who had no 
claims or pretensions to worldly opulence or honours. His fa- 
ther, named also Alexander, the second of four brothers, was 
a small crofter on the Arradoul estate. The maiden name 
of his mother was Janet Mitchell ; she was a native of Nether 
Dalachy, in the parish of Bellie. In their religious tenets, both 
were Roman Catholics ; consequently, young Geddes was of the 
same persuasion. He was taught to read in the humble mansion 
of a schoolmistress, whose name was Sellar, and whose goodness 
of heart he was occasionally accustomed to make mention of to 
the latest period of his existence. Having exhausted all the 



252 



BANFFSHIRE 



store of knowledge which Mrs Sellar could impart, Geddes was 
next placed under the care of a student from Aberdeen, whose 
name was Shearer, and whom the Laird of Arradoul had engaged 
to educate his two sons. In the family of this gentleman, his in- 
structions were gratuitous. How long he remained at Arradoul 
is uncertain ; but, upon leaving the laird's hospitable mansion, he 
was, at the age of fourteen, removed to Scalan, a free Roman Ca- 
tholic seminary in the Highlands, limited to boys destined for 
that church, whose studies are to be completed in some foreign 
university. The vale in which this seminary was situated was so 
deeply excavated and overhung by surrounding hills, as almost to 
require the perpetual use of the lamp. 

Having attained the age of twenty-one, he was removed ffom 
Scalan, in October 1758, to the Scotch College at Paris, where 
he remained six years ; and, although pressed to take a share in 
the public labours of the college, he returned, however, to Scot- 
land in 1764. Immediately after his arrival, he entered into holy 
orders, and was appointed to officiate at Dundee. Here he was 
scarcely settled, when he received an offer to reside with the Earl 
of Traquair. This offer he readily accepted, and became an in- 
mate of his Lordship's family in May 1765. At this time he 
had reached his twenty-eighth year, and had resided in his Lord- 
ship's for more than a year, when a female relation of the Earl 
openly professed for him an affection which he could not return, 
having taken the vow of perpetual celibacy. In a sketch of this 
kind, it is not expected that we should trace the learned Doctor 
through the whole course of his eventful life. With regard to 
the merits of his various literary productions, we think it unneces- 
sary to give an opinion, farther than to state that they exhibit 
great proofs of talent, perseverance, and profound research ; and 
that there are few, if any, who will not allow that he was an ac- 
complished scholar. He died at London, rather suddenly, after 
suffering excruciating torture from the nature of his disease, on the 
26th February 1802, in the sixty fifth year of his age; and, at his 
own particular desire, his remains were interred in Paddington 

 The reader may form some idea of its dark and melancholy aspect, from the fol- 
lowing reply Geddes made to one of his fellow-students, who had obtained leave to 
visit his friends, and who asked him if he had any commands he could execute. 

Pray, be so kind," replied Geddes, " as to make particular inquiries after the 
health of the sun, and tell him 1 still hope I shall one day be able to renew the ho- 
nour of a personal acquaintance with him."

Church- Yard. The late Catholic Bishop Paterson of Edinburgh 
was also a native of this parish, and the son of poor, but industri- 
ous and honest parents. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners are, the Earl of Seafield, 
to whom belongs Rannes and Findochtie ; His Grace the Duke of 
Richmond, proprietor of Couffurrach, Leitchieston, and Burnside; 
Sir James Gordon, Bart, of Letterfourie and Nether Buckie ; John 
Gordon, Esq. of Cluny, owner of the lands of Freuchnie, part of 
Buckie, and Gollachie ; Adam Gordon, Esq. of Cairnfield; and 
the Misses Stuart of Tannachy. 

Sir James Gordon, Bart., Adam Gordon of Cairnfield, and the 
Misses Stuart are resident. John Gordon, Esq. of Cluny, resides 
occasionally, during the season, at Buckie Lodge ; and Dr Kyle, 
Catholic Bishop of Germanicia, at Presholm, 

Parucliial Rec/isters.—-The earliest records of discipline com- 
mence on the •25th December 1698, and have been very regularly 
kept till 1736. During that period, however, they really contain 
nothing, in any degree, particularly interesting, except the sum- 
moning delinquents before the session, who, upon confessing their 
guilt, and after severe penance in sackcloth, and many sharp re- 
bukes before the congregation, were restored again to communion 
with the church. From ]787 till the present time, these records 
have been regularly kept. 

Registration of marriages began at Whitsunday 1716, and that 
of baptisms in the same year. Great regularity has been observed 
in both from the above dale till 1746 ; but, from this time till 
1791, and even down to the present day, many Episcopalians and 
Roman Catholics do not register their children. No registration 
of deaths has ever been kept in the parish. 

Antiquities — There are many remains of antiquity in this pa- 
rish, particularly of Druidical temples or cairns. The most re- 
markable and striking of these is one on the heights of Corriedown, 
called the Cove Stanes. A considerable portion of the stones of 
this cairn was employed in building the present mansion-house of 
Letterfourie. Mr Gordon, the father of the present proprietor, 
examined three of them to the foundation, and found only char- 
coal, and a whitish substance resembling the ashes of wood or 
bones. He supposed that the low grounds, in the .vicinity of his 
house, had abounded in wood, as large pieces of oak and fir were 
dug out of the hollows now under cultivation. There is a large 
collection of stones on an eminence in one of Earl Seafield's en-

closures, near the farm of Woodside, south of the public road, 
commonly called the " King's Cairn." Tradition has handed 
down that it is the grave of Indulph or Indulphus, the 77th King 
of Scotland, who, after obtaining a complete victory over the 
Danes, was unfortunately killed near this spot. It is a well-known 
historical fact, that Indulphus's reign was much disturbed by de- 
scents of the Danes. There is, however, some dispute regarding 
the precise period when this event took place. Abercrombie says 
that it was in 961 ; Buchanan in 967. We agree with Aber- 
crombie, as Indulphus reigned from 952 to 961, and was succeed- 
ed by Duff, who fell by a conspiracy of his subjects in 965. The 
above event was distinguished by the name of the Battle of the 
Bauds, at that time an extensive moor, now the property of Lord 
Seafield. 

A great many small cairns are still visible on this moor, between 
the village of Findochtie and that part of the Bauds now planted, 
supposed to be the burial places of the Danes who fell in the bat- 
tle with Indulphus. About seventy-five years ago, a countryman 
found, on the lands of Rannes, in a tumulus or cairn which he was 
removing, a stone-coffin, containing human bones of a large size. 
" Having obtained permission," says the late Rev. Mr Donaldson, 
" to ransack this grave, I found it covered with a large stone, 4 
feet long, 3 broad, and about 14 inches in depth. On removing 
this, we found four other stones set on their edges, which served 
as a coffin to part of a skull and jaw-bone, with several teeth, and 
some fragments of a thigh-bone. The dimensions of this coffin 
were 3 feet 1 inch in length, 2 feet wide, and 1 foot 10 inches 
deep. There was no stone in the bottom. The bones were re- 
moved into a similar chest a few feet northward of this one, in the 
same tumulus. This last one was discovered, four or five vears 
ago, by a man in the neighbourhood, who was removing a few more 
of the stones for building a house. It is of smaller dimensions than 
the other, and was originally covered with two stones, one of which 
was off. No bones were found in it. There are many other cairns 
near this one, but none of them has been searched. They are at 
no great distance from the House of Rannes, on a farm lately im- 
proved out of moor, called Westerside. The ruins of the House of 
Findochtie, of an old chapel, near the farm-house of Farskane, and 
of some buildings on the tops of two hills, on the east and west side 
of the harbour of Portnockie, the former called the Green Castle, 

and the latter the Tronach Castle, are still to be seen :" but by

whom they were built is unknown. On the moor of Rannachy, to 
the right, at the distance of 100 paces from the high road, is an 
eminence evidently artificial, called Tarrieclerack, supposed to be 
a burial-place. 

Caves. — The most remarkable of those along rhe coast, which 
are found on the property of Lord Seafield, are, \st, Farskane's, 
so called from the proprietor having, in 1715, retired into it, alono- 
with two other gentlemen, to avoid trouble during the Earl of 
Marr's rebellion. In it they lived comfortably for five or six weeks, 
and returned to their own houses, when all apprehension of danger 
was past. 2dy Janet Corstair's cave, so named from a mad woman 
who took up her residence in it ; and, Qd, The Cross cave, so 
denominated from its taking a direction to the east and west, at 
some distance from its entrance. The extent of none of these is 
known. There is a well of fresh water on the north side of a green 
hill, surrounded by the tide, called Priest's Craig-well, betwixt 
Findochtie and Portnockie. 

Coins.— In 1805, a small square box was turned up by the 
plough, on the moor of Arradoul, the property of Mr Gordon of 
Cairnfield, containing some coins of Queen Mary, James VI., and 
Charles I. Several of them are in the possession of Mr Gordon 
and Sir James Gordon, Bart. They were in a very good state of 
preservation. A silver handle of a sword also was found by Sir 
James Gordon's father, on the grounds of Letterfourie ; but the 
blade was completely destroyed by rust, so that no idea could be 
formed of its antiquity. 

Modern 5z'Wm.s._The chief of these are, Letterfourie, Cairn- 
field, Tannachy, Burnside, Buckie Lodge, the Roman Catholic 
chapel, and the Bishop's dwelling-house at Presholm. There are 
four corn-mills, besides one for grinding flour and making pot-bar- 
ey, and another for carding wool. There is a distillery at Gol- 
lachie, but it has not been in operation for a considerable time 
past. 

in. — Population. 
The number of souls in this parish, as returned to Dr Web. 
ster m 1755, was 2898. By a minute of visitation in the presby- 
tery records, dated at the kirk of Rathven, 29th August 17'0 
tlie population is stated at 1700 catechisable persons, and 600 
Papists, by a moderate computation of those above ten years of ae 
by Mr Robert Gordon, the minister, in presence of the heritor. '

In 1793, exclusive of that part of the east end of the parish an- 
iiexed to Cullen quoad sacra, the date of which annexation cannot 
be found out, the population was 3019, of whom 1408 were males, 
1411 females; 1766 Presbyterians, 303 Episcopalians, 950 Ro- 
man Catholics ; and 720 families. At the same date, the annex- 
ed part contained 505 persons, of whom 271 were males, 234 
females ; 498 Presbyterians, 2 Episcopalians, and 5 Roman Ca- 
tholics.

The increase of population since 1821, viz. 1126, is altogether 
to be attributed to the encouragement given by Lord Seafield for 
the improvement of waste lands, and the flourishing state of the 
various fisheries, particularly of the herring-fishery ; which, how- 
ever, has been for several years past on the decline, within the 
bounds of this parish. 

There are two insane persons in the parish, and four fatuous. 
There are two blind, and two deaf or dumb. Two only of the six 
are supported by the session, one at L.6, 12s. and the other at 
L.2, 12s. per annum. 

Character of the People. — The farmers, whether Presbyterians, 
Episcopalians, or Roman Catholics, are men of plain and unaf- 
fected manners; open and sincere in their intercourse with others; 
friendly and obliging among themselves; charitable to the poor in 
proportion to their means, and not inhospitable to strangers. 
Many of them are intelligent men, and by no means deficient in 
intellectual, moral, and religious attainments. 

The fishermen, as individuals, are nearly placed upon a footing 
of equality. Their pursuits are similar ; hence their language and 
dealings are almost the same. It is said, " that the voice of one 
puts all in action, and that the example of one is frequently fol- 
lowed by all ; and yet, what is singular, no one seems to possess a 
character decisive enough to take the lead, or to rise to superio- 
rity by the strength of genius, or the arts of address." There 
cannot be the slightest doubt of the truth of this statement; as I 
have often marked, on hearing them talking of the success of one

cess either to the superiority of their neighbours' skill in fishing-, 
or of his nets, lines or hooks, but, like all in similar circumstances 
who are of a superstitious turn of mind, and believe in fate, to 
what they called "good chance." 

The boys go to sea as soon as they can be of any service to 
their fathers ; on that account their education is much neglected, 
or, at least, much interrupted, so that little progress is made. At 
eighteen years of age they become men, and, whenever they ac- 
quire the share of a boat, they marry, as it is a maxim with them 
' that no man can be a fisher, and want a wife." They marry, 
.therefore, at an early age, and the object of their choice is always 
a fisherman's daughter, who is generally from eighteen to twenty- 
two years of age. These women lead a most laborious life, and 
frequently go from ten to twenty-five miles into the country, 
with a heavy load of fish. They seldom receive money for this 
fish, but take in exchange meal, barley, butter, and cheese. They 
assist in all the labour connected with the boats on shore, and 
show great dexterity in baiting the hooks and arranging the lines. 
When stormy weather prevents the boats from fishing, the men 
are employed in mending their lines and nets, or in making 
new ones. They are stout, well-formed, of good stature, capable 
of undergoing great fatigue, and are the most expert and intrepid 
seamen in her Majesty's dominions. The women are, in many 
instances, handsome, good looking, and the very picture of health. 
Many of the fishermen are sober, industrious, and well-behaved 
men, and have laid up considerable savings. Others are thouo-ht- 
less, and too frequently spend foolishly what they have earned 
with so much danger and hardship. 

Every thing in their power has been done by the session to pro- 
mote temperance at marriages, baptisms, and funerals. Previous to 
a marriage taking place, the session exacts a pledge of half a guinea 
from the parties that there will be no rioting or fighting. If there 
is, the pledge is forfeited to the poor ; if it turns out otherwise, it 
is returned on the following Sabbath, provided the elder of the 
district certify the same. The fishermen generally are a sober, 
hard-working race of men, and those who act with common pru- 
dence enjoy all the comforts of life in a reasonable degree. la 
proof of this, the industrious and saving have good houses, mostly 
slated, and well furnished, consisting of two or three apartments. 
The women, some years ago, went to church bare-headed, but now' 
they put on white muslin caps, or straw bonnets, with red cloaks or

tartan scarfs. Both men and women dress well on holidays, and, 
with very few exceptions, are seldom absent from public worship. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agricultural and Rural Economy. — This parish, as already stat- 
ed, contains 27,000 Scotch acres, or 33,750 imperial. 

Number cultivated or occasionally in tillage, . 8,433 

meadow and pasture, . 437

Rent of Land. — In an extensive parish like this, consisting of 
such a variety of soil, the rent must vary. The best low-lying 
arable ground lets from L. 3 to L. 2, 15s. per acre, and that of 
a light sandy soil along the shore at I.. I per acre. The higher 
grounds, when improved, from 12s. to 16s. 

Live-stock. — Much attention has been paid of late years to 
the breeding and rearing of stock in this district. Bulls of 
the most improved kind have been introduced, which have ef- 
fected a most strikmg change for the better, both in the size 
and the symmetry of that animal. The Aberdeenshire breed 
is still the prevailing cattle in the district, and much prized. 
With proper attention paid to this kind of stock during winter- 
keeping, and when at their full size, they will weigh from 50 
to 60 stones. Besides, they are hardy, and more kindly in feed- 
ing than any other which has hitherto been introduced. When 
the bullocks are not kept for agricultural purposes, the stock 
is generally sold off at the age of three years, and if in good 
condition, will bring from L.9 to L.IO per head. The dealers 
who purchase these cattle for the south, are somewhat particular 
with regard to what they call " points of form and colour." These 
points are, short legs, a fair-proportioned round body, straight 
along the back ; and in their third year, a long slender white 
horn, tipped towards the point with black. The favourite colour 
is pure black. The brindled ranks next in esteem, and the dun 
is not disliked. Pure white or streaked are accounted infe- 
rior. One farmer lately introduced the Teeswater breed, but he 
very soon found that he had neither a sufficient quantity of grass, 
nor requisite shelter for such heavy stock. 

The sheep is of a mixed kind, and the whole number kept in the 
parish only amounts to a few hundreds. No attention, therefore, 
is paid to their breeding.

Horses. — The horses, particularly those for agricultural pur- 
poses, have been much improved in size and shape, and this in a 
great measure has been owing to the spirited exertions of the 
Agricultural Society, instituted some years ago at CuUen. A 
handsome premium is given from the Society's funds to the owner 
of the best stallion that appears at the annual competition, and 
the successful competitor is bound to keep his horse for the sea- 
son within the limits of a certain portion of the district. There 
are now many valuable horses for agricultural pur, oses in this 
parish, which in price may vary from L. 20 to L. 35, and some 
even bring so high a sum as L.40. 

The fields are properly laid out, cleaned, drained, and in 
many instances enclosed with dry-stone dik3s. Tlie furrows are 
straighted, run-ridge is abolished, and a regular rotation of cropping 
is strictly observed. The six years' shift is most general. The 
rents are from L. 30 to L. 500, according to extent and quality. 
The farm-steadings and office-houses, with few exceptions, stand 
very much in need of improvement. 

Manures. — Various kinds of manure are used. Farmers resid- 
ing near the coast, after a storm has loosed the sea-weed from the 
rocks, and driven it to the shore, procure large quantities, which 
they spread in summer on ley to the extent of three hundred cart 
loads to the acre. This process is renewed every second year. 
Dung, purchased from the fishing villages, and composed of the 
offals of the large fish, when mixed with moss or earth, is account- 
ed a valuable manure for raising green crops. 

Produce. — 



Grain of all kinds, . L.27,300

Manufactures. — About seventy-nine years ago, linen wa-s manu- 
factured to a very considerable extent in this parish, which at that 
time gave employment to sixty hand weavers, besides the great 
number of females who were employed in the spinning of the flax. 
It was mostly Dutch, and sent dressed or hackled from Aberdeen, 
Fraserburgh, Banff, Portsoy, Cullen, Huntly, and Fochabers, to 
different agents, to the amount of 348 cwt., which, given out to 



260

the spinners at the average price of Is. per lb., brought in annu- 
ally L.1948, 16s. At present there are only four weavers, who are 
chiefly employed by different families in weaving a little napery, 
linen, and plaiden for family use. A small manufactory for spin- 
ning ropes is still carried on at Buckie. 

The following are the imports and exports at Port Gordon for 
the following years.

Findochtie. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Some years ago, two fairs were annually held in this parish ; 
but now there is only one, which takes place in the end of July for 
cattle, sheep, cheese, &amp;c. At Buckie Burn, there is a post-office, 
with a daily delivery. There is no regular market for butcher - 
meat ; but at Buckie, and the other villages, wheaten bread and 
groceries can be procured. 

Villages in the parish. — There are six villages, viz. five fishing ; 
Buckie, Porteasy, Findochtie, Portnockie, Port Gordon, and 
Rathven, which requires no description. 

Buckie is situated at the mouth of the Burn of Buckie, and 
belongs to Sir James Gordon, Bart., on the west side of this burn ; 
and on the east of it, to John Gordon, Esq. of Cluny. According 
to the last census, it contains a population of 2005. The west 
side has been a fishing station for nearly 200 years, and is the 
oldest in the parish. At what time the other side became a fish- 
ing station, cannot be ascertained with any degree of certaintv. 



RATHVEN.

During the year 1723, a fishing-boat and crew, belonging to the 
Duke of Gordon, removed from Gollachie, which is situated about 
a mile westward of Buckie, as being a safer and more commodious 
situation. About that period, the proprietor of Nether Buckie, 
who held his lands in feu from the Duke, had only one boat ; and 
as he was out of the kingdom, and considerably in arrears of his 
feus to the Duke, the desired accommodation was the more rea- 
dily obtained. At present, there are 117 large boats, and 28 
small, employed in the various fisheries. 

Porteasy. — This village is situated nearly two miles east from 
Buckie. In the year 1727, it was known as a fishing- station, and 
contained five houses, which were built by Hay of Rannes, at that 
time the proprietor, for the accommodation of the original fisher- 
men, who came from Findhorn, in Morayshire, to settle there. 
The writer of the last Statistical Report says, " that he obtained 
this information from a man aged ninety, who was a native of this 
parish, and helped to man the first boat." This village contains 
a population of 420. They have 27 large boats, and 12 small 
ones. 

Findochtie. — Findochtie lies two miles from Porteasy, and con- 
tains a population of 414. A colony of fishermen settled here 
from Fraserburgh in 1716. They possess amongst them 24 large 
boats, and 15 small. 

Portnockie — Portnockie, the property of the Earl of Seafield, 
contains a population of 800, and attached, quoad sacra, to Cullen, 
is two miles to the eastward of Findochtie. " The following an- 
ecdote," says the late Rev. Mr Donaldson, " ascertains its origin as 
a fishing-station. About twenty years ago, died Kattie Slater, aged 
ninety-six. Like many old people, she was unable to tell her age 
precisely ; but she recollected that she was as old as the House of 
Farskane, as her father had often told her that he built the first 
house in Portnockie, the same year in which the house of Farskane 
was built ; and that she was brought from Cullen to it, and rocked 
in a fisher's scull, instead of a cradle." Now, from the date on 
the house of Farskane, it appears to have been built in 1677. 
Thus the origin of this village is fixed with sufficient accuracy. 
It contains 800 inhabitants, and has 70 large boats, and 27 
small. 

Portgordon. — This village, of which the Duke of Richmond 
is now proprietor, was named from the late Noble Dukes of Gor- 
don. It contains a population of 470, and is attached, quoad sacra y 



262 



BANFFSHIHE. 



to the Chapel of Ease at Enzie. There is a tolerably good har- 
bour, and, as has been stated, considerable business is done in 
exporting grain, and in importing salt and coals. There are 7 
large boats, and 10 small. 

Herring Fishery. — About Christmas, the fishermen engage with 
the curers in the herring fishing, at the various curing stations on 
the coast of Caithness, at Fraserburgh, Peterhead, and Aberdeen. 
They receive from the fish-curer a bounty on each boat from L.8 
to L. 10, and 10s. 6d. for every cran which will contain from 600 
to 700 dozen, with four pints of whisky weekly. Each boat requires 
four men, and sometimes a boy. In a successful season a boat 
may take in one night upwards of 40 crans ; from 150 to 180 is 
reckoned an excellent fishing for the season. The number of 
boats in this parish is 245 ; and, taking the average of each boat 
at 100 crans at 10s. 6d., the amount will be L. 18,375. 

Means of Communication. — The roads, upon the whole, in all 
directions, are good, and kept in an excellent state of repair. The 
post-road runs through the parish from east to west for ten miles. 
A coach from Elgin to Banff passes and repasses daily along this 
road, affording an easy and expeditious conveyance to various 
parts of the county. The condition of the bridges and fences is 
good. 

Harbours. — There are two harbours, one at Buckie and the other 
at Portgordon. Ships of considerable burden enter the harbour 
at Portgordon, where, as has been stated, considerable business 

 The large boats are from 12 to 14 tons in weight, and the small ones between 
4 and 5. The price of a large boat is L.27 ; masts and sails, including cordage, 
L.IG; each net is from 45 to 50 yards in length, and costs L.3, 10s. In fishing 
cod, ling, and haddocks, a large boat requires eight men ; and each boat has, from 
February to April, nine lines, containing 800 hooks at a yard's distance. From this 
period, when the season for taking large fish begins, till April, the fishermen seldom 
go farther from the shore than fifty miles. From the end of April, or beginning of 
May, they frequently sail out to the distance of eighty miles in search of skate, and 
then each boat has eighteen lines. Skate is found in great abundance in a particular 
spot of Caithness, called the Skate Hole. Cod, ling, halibut, tusk, and skate, are 
the only large fish caught in any quantity in the Moray Frith. They are salted in 
pots on the beach, and dried on the rocks, or on a temporary frame made for the 
purpose. Skate, however, is dried without salt, and the halibut is used fresh. The 
ling and skate are most valuable, on account of their livers yielding a considerable 
portion of oil, which is sold from lOd. to Is. per pint. Cod, ling, and tusk, are in 
season from May to February; skate is good at all seasons; and halibut in high per- 
fection about July. In June, the dried fish is packed in the large boats, and carried 
for sale to the different towns along the Fife coast, to Edinburgh, Glasgow, and oc- 
casionally to Ireland. A cargo is valued at L.IOO. 

The crew of a small boat consists of five men, with a boy. The small boats are 
used for taking haddocks, whitings, flounders, &amp;c. Mackerel is caught from July 
till the end of August, by a line sunk with lead, and the hooks baited with any sub- 
stance o.f a bright or red colour. They are also frequently taken in the salmon 
stake nets in large quantities.

is done in importing and exporting salt, coals, and grain. The 
one at Buckie is used chiefly as a landing place for the fishernnen, 
and a protection for their boats. In sumnner, coals and salt may 
be landed with safety. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The situation of the parish church is both 
centrical and convenient for the greater part of the population, its 
distance from the extremities being four miles and a-half, and from 
the nearest boundary about two. It was built in the year 1794, and 
since that time, has only undergone some slight repairs upon the 
roof. Its present state, therefore, is good, and 1000 persons, 
allowing eighteen inches to each, can be comfortably accom- 
modated. The sittings are all free, and the right of occupancy 
arises from the families living upon the properties of the different 
heritors, to whom seats were allocated in proportion to their valued 
rental. 

The manse was built in 1778, and underwent considerable re- 
pairs in 1827, and at present, including the office-houses, is in 
good habitable order. The extent of glebe is seven acres of ara- 
ble ground, which may be valued at L. 17, 10s. The amount of 
stipend is 120 bolls of barley, and the same number of meal, con- 
verted into money at the highest fiars of the county, with L. 10 
for communion elements. Sir Andrew Leith Hay of Rannes is 
patron

The present incumbent raised a process of augmentation of sti- 
pend before the Teind Court, which, however, was refused in No- 
vember 1838, on the ground that his ministerial labours were dimi- 
nished on account of the erection of a chapel at Buckie, on the 
Church Extension principle. 

Th ere are three Chapels of Ease attached to the Established 
church in this parish ; one situated at the Enzie, which was built 
in the year 1785, and seated for 404. This chapel was erect- 
ed from money raised by a general collection made through all 
the churches of Scotland, as recommended by the General As- 
sembly. It is endowed, and the fund arises from lands left by a 
Mr Anderson, which were purchased by Alexander, late Duke of 
Gordon, and the price received was more advantageously vested 
in other property. It is under the management of the Commit- 
tee of the Royal Bounty, along with the constituent members of 
the presbytery of Fordyce, within whose bounds it is situated. 
The clergyman receives annually from the Procurator of the 
Church the sum of L. 62, 8s. His other emoluments arise from 
seat rents, which are let so low as from Is. to 3d. annually, and a 
glebe of eight acres, for which two bolls of barley are paid to his 
Grace the Duke of Richmond. The ground is rather of an infe- 
rior quality, and its value may be about L. 1 per acre. There is 
no manse, but the clergymen resides in a very comfortable house at- 
tached to a farm which has always been let to the incumbent. 
The whole emoluments, exclusive of what may arise from the pro- 
fits of the farm, may amount to L.70 per annum. There are no 
free sitings, but as the seats are let at so very moderate a rate, this 
really can scarcely be felt as any inconvenience. The funds aris- 
ing from the weekly collections are under the management of the 
kirk-session. The yearly amount varies from L. 18 to L.21. Out 
of this sum, as they have no benefactions, they maintain their own 
poor, whose number at present on the roll is 33, and pay the 
church officer and precentor. The population is 1703, and di- 
vine service is well attended. Communicants 340.

In the same register for the Schyre of Tueddail, parochin Ettilstoiin, the following

in the village of Easter Buckie. It was built in the year 1835, 
chiefly by subscription, and cost the sum of L.800. It is free of 
debt. The clergyman was ordained to this charge in the month 
of July 1837, and has a bond for L.80 per annum as stipend. 
This chapel contains 800 hearers. There are no free sittings, 
provided they possibly can be let. The highest charge is 3s. 6d. 
and the lowest Is. No part of the weekly collections has 
hitherto gone to the support of the poor. The heritors and 
• kirk-session are now, however, entitled to the half of these col- 
lections, according to the decision given by the Court of Ses- 
sion in the cause of the heritors against the managers of the Cha- 
pel of Ease in Brechin. The population assigned is upwards of 
2000, which comprehends the whole of the village of Buckie, and 
a small portion of the landward part lying towards the south. 
Number of communicants, 400 ; unlet seats, 300. 

The third chapel in connection with the Established Church is 
situated at the village of Portnockie. It was finished and opened 
for public worship some time ago. It contains 450 sitters. The 
whole seats are already let, and the members of Presbytery have 
agreed to preach in rotation weekly till such time as a clergyman 
be ordained. It is called Seafield Church, and, when formed into 
a parish, will comprehend the part of this parish attached quoad 
sacra to CuUen, and a few families residing in the immediate neigh- 
bourhood of Portnockie. It was built by subscription, and cost 
L.400, of which the Honourable Colonel Grant, now sixth Earl 
of Seafield, contributed L. 100. 

There are two Episcopal chapels, — one at Arradoul, and an- 
other in Buckie. The one at Arradoul was built about fifty-four 
years ago, and contains 211 sittings, of which 139 are let at 3s. 6d. 
each. The other, in Buckie, was purchased about a year ago 
from the Methodists, and contains 200 sittings. 

There are two Roman Catholic chapels in this parish, one of 
which is situated at Presholm, and the other at Buckie. The one 
at Presholm was built in 1788, and contains 800 sitters ; the other, 
which was lately fitted up, holds 400. The attendance at each 
chapel averages 400. The amount of Catholic population is 
1500. The bishop resides at Presholm, and has three priests who 
officiate and live with him there, whose incomes depend solely 
upon what the bishop may give them. The collections at both 
chapels are given to the poor of their own persuasion.

Divine service at the Established Church is well attended. The 
number of all ages belonging to the parish church is 1820. Ave- 
rage number of communicants, 700. The amount of extraordinary 
collections, during the last five years, for charitable purposes, was 
L.20, 10s. lOd. One of these collections is annually made in 
behalf of the Aberdeen Infirmary. 

Education. — The number of schools in the parish is fourteen. 
Six of these are endowed, and the other eight are supported by 
fees. 

The master of the parochial school has a salary of L.32, Is. 6d., 
with the legal accommodation, and an annual sum from the Dick 
Bequest of L.25. The branches of instruction are, reading, writ- 
ing, arithmetic, English grammar, geography, Latin, and the ele- 
ments of Greek when required. The fees charged for reading 
English are 2s. per quarter ; for arithmetic and writing, 2s. 6d. ; 
English grammar and geography, 3s. 6d. ; for Greek or Latin, 5s. 
Average number of scholars during the year, 80. He is not ses- 
sion-clerk, consequently he has no emoluments from that office. 
Amount of school fees, L. 23, making in whole about L. 80 an- 
nually. The school is ably taught. 

The Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge has en- 
dowed two schools in this parish, one at Buckie, a most im- 
portant station, and the other at the village of Coulfurach, 
in the immediate neighbourhood of the Enzie chapel.  The 
number of scholars, according to the last report, was 46. At 
Coulfurach, the master has a free dwelling-house and school- 
room from His Grace the Duke of Richmond, and L.15 of sa- 
lary from the society above-mentioned. He teaches only the 
common branches of education. Number of scholars, 31. An 
efficient and active teacher is much wanted at this station. There 
is another school at Port-Gordon in this district. The Duke of 
Richmond pays the teacher a salary of L.15, and allows him a free 
house and school-room. This is also an important station, and 
the school is most successfully conducted. The number attend- 
ing is 90. 

 The school in Buckie has been withdrawn by the Society, on the ground, that 
the school- house has been allowed to fall into decay. This is deeply to be regretted, 
because Buckie, from its great population, is one of the most important stations in 
the north of Scotland. It is therefore to be hoped, that a commodious house will be 
speedily provided by the proprietor, and that a zealous and efficient teacher will be 
forthwith appointed.

Besides the school endowed by this Society, there is another in 
Buckie, kept by a woman, who teaches reading, along with sewing 
and knitting, to little girls. She receives a salary of L.4 ; num- 
ber of scholars, 30. There is another school, for the same pur- 
pose, taught by a female at Findochtie. She receives L.l, Is. 
annually from Earl Seafield, and has a free house. Their charges 
are a mere trifle per month. In the populous village of Portnoc- 
kie, the Noble proprietor, the Earl of Seafield, has built an ex- 
cellent school-house, and gives L.IO annually to the teacher, who 
is allowed to charge the same fees as at the parish school. It is 
numerously attended, and well taught by the present master. 
There are also five Sabbath schools in the parish, attended by 
about 300 scholars. 

In an extensive parish of this kind, it cannot be very easily as- 
certained what number of the young, betwixt six and fifteen years 
of age, cannot read or write. There are few, if any, who are not 
able to read ; but a considerable number cannot write. 

The people, in general, are alive to the benefits of education ; 
but many of the poorer classes, particularly the more indigent of 
the fishermen, are compelled to take their children from school 
as soon as they are able to do any thing for their own support. 

There are no parts of the parish so distant from some one of 
the schools, as to prevent attendance. 

There can scarcely be a doubt, that, in general, a visible change 
in the conduct and morals of the people has taken place, since 
the facilities of education were increased, though there is still 
great room for farther improvement. 

Library. — A public library was instituted some years ago in 
the village, or kirk-town of Rathven. It contains a considerable 
number of valuable works, and is supported by a quarterly con- 
tribution. 

Charitable Institutions. — Bede-House. — The origin of this in- 
stitution is mentioned by Spottiswood in his Account of Religious 
Houses in Scotland, and is as follows : " Rothsan, John Bisset 
gives to God, and the Church of St Peter's of Rothsan, for sus- 
taining seven leprous persons, the patronage of the Kirk of Kyl- 
talargy, to pray for the souls of William and Alexander, Kings 
of Scotland, andsouls of his ancestors and successors, about 1226."

The Rede House is still standing in the village of Rathven, and 
was very lately repaired ; and two of the six Bede men, who are 
still maintained on the establishment, at present live in this house. 
When a vacancy occurs, the kirk-session merely recommend, as 
the appointment is invested in the Earl of Seafield, who is pro- 
prietor of the lands of Rannes, and their yearly income is as fol- 
lows : From the lands of Rannes, each bedeman has half an 
acre of good croft land during his life, and one boll of oatmeal 
annually; from the lands of Findochtie, 8s. l:d. ; and, from John 
Gordon, Esq. of Cluny, as proprietor of the lands of Freuchnie, 
which formerly formed part of the estate of Rannes, Is. 4|d. 
making in whole, 9s. 6d. The half acre, when let, which they 
are allowed to do, brings L. 1, Is. per annum. 

Poor arid Parochial Funds.- — The number at ]resent on the 
poor's roll is 69, besides many others who occasionally receive re- 
lief. There are also two fatuous persons supported from the 
session funds, one at 3s. 6d. per week, and the other at Is. Hi- 
therto no assessment has been made; but in a very short time, 
it must become unavoidable. 

The present funds for the support of the poor are the ordinary 
weekly collections at the church doors, which, for the last eight 
years, have averaged L.44, 4s. llfd.; from interest of money 
vested with the Honourable Colonel Grant, L.2, 10s.; from fines 
last year, now not exacted, L.22, lis.; from mortcloth, L.2, 6s.;

from dues of proclamation, L.2, 12s. 6d. Total, L.74, 4s. 5|d. 
Last year, however, the sum of L.96, 14s. 5d. was disbursed, 
which included expenses of every kind ; but, in order to make up 
I his amount, the session were under the necessity of taking up the 
remainder of the money lodged with Earl Seafield. The poor, 
according to their necessities, receive from 5s. to 7s. per quarter. 
In addition to this. Lord Seafield gives annually a certain quanti- 
ty of meal to those on the poor's roll who reside upon the lands of 
Findochtie and Porteasv. 

This part of the country was wont to be greatly infested with 
vagrants; but the establishment of the rural police in this and the 
neighbouring counties has completely suppressed promiscuous 
begging, and conferred a great boon on the district. 

Jn a poor and populous parish such as this, we have much plea- 
sure in stating, that the poor, in most'cases, manifest no particu- 
lar disposition to seek parochial relief, unless forced by necessity 
alone or unexpected bereavement; many melancholy and heart- 
rending cases of which too frequently occur among the fishermen. 

Inns or Alehouses. — In the village of Buckie there are ten li- 
censed houses for retailing ardent spirits; in Porteasy, two; in 
Findochtie, foi;r; in Portnockie, four; in Portgordon, six; two 
by the turnpike road; two in the village of Rathven ; making in 
whole 30, — a number by far too great, and which must tend, 
and that in no ordinary degree, both to impoverish and demoralize 
the people, particularly the fishermen. 

Fuel. — The principal fuel used is peat, or dried turf. It is 
procured at a great distance from the different villages, conse- 
quently it is very expensive. A small cart-load costs from Is. to 
Is. 6d. According to the last report of this parish, it is stated, 
' that, when the load is sold at Is., the consumer pays at the rate 
of a halfpenny for four peats and one turf." Coals are sold at 
Buckie, and Portgordon, about Is. 6d. per imperial barrel, ten 
of which make a good cart-load, weighing nearly 18 cwt. 

MiSCELLANKOUS OBSERVATIONS. 

The valued rental of this parish in 1792, was from L. 4000 to 
L. 5000 Sterling; in 1313, it was assessed at L.7336. Since the 

Since the above was written the whole funds have been exhausted, so that the 
kirk-session found themselves under the necessity of calling a meeting of heritors, to 
take immediate steps to provide for the wants of the poor. They met accordingly, 
and assessed themselves for the ensuing year to the amount of L.95 Sterling.

last Statistical report was published, immense improvements 
have taken place. Many hundred acres of moor-ground have 
been reclaimed. The Earl of Seafield gives a bounty of L.5 
for each acre thus improved. On the extensive moor grounds 
lying on the north and south sides of the turnpike road lead- 
ing from Cullen to a little westward of Rannachie, from the 
 encouragement thus given, the appearance of the face of the land 
has been most completely changed : and, in addition to this, many 
comfortable and commodious houses have been built, which, with 
their neat enclosures, add very much to the beauty of the sur- 
rounding country. By the premium thus offered, many industri- 
ous and enterprising poor people obtain a decent and respectable 
subsistence. The improvers, besides receiving the L.5 for each 
acre reclaimed, possess it rent free for five years ; after that period 
they pay a rent according to the quality of the ground improved. 
Prejudices in favour of old practices are speedily dying away ; and 
every intelligent and cautious man is anxiously looking around him 
to discover what is most conducive to his own interest. Great im- 
provements have been made in agriculture, particularly in drain- 
ing and turnip-husbandry. Thrashing-mills have been erected 
wherever the farms are of any considerable extent, several of which 
are driven by water. Much corn is still thrashed with flails. The 
people are, in every respect, improved, both as to intelligence, 
food, clothing, and lodging. The roads and bridges are kept in 
good order, affording an easy aud ready access to markets, and 
every part of the surrounding country.

PRESBYTERY OF TURRIFF, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. THOMAS WILSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The parish of Gamrie, or, as it has been named at 
different times, Gamery, Ghaemrie, or Gemrie, according to ge- 
nerally received tradition, derives its name from a Gaelic word, 
Kemriey — signifying a running leap or running fight, — on account of 
a bloody engagement with the Danes on the spot where the old 
church now stands. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish is about 10 miles long 
from east to west, and from 3 to 4 broad. It is bounded on the 
north by the Moray Frith ; on the east, by the brook or burn of 
Nethermill, which separates it from Aberdour ; on the south, bv 
King-Edward ; and on the west, by King-Edward, Alvah, and 
the I ver Doveran, which separates it from Banff. 

Topographical Appearances. — The surface of the parish is ex- 
ceedingly diversified by hills, glens, and precipices. This appears 
to be occasioned by the singular nature of the sea-coast, which is 
skirted by a narrow ledge of stupendous rocks, running the whole 
length of the parish, and of the eastern adjoining one of Aberdour, 
in -some places perpendicular towards the sea to the height of GOO 
feet, and in all precipitous. The bay of Gamrie is formed by the 
jutting out into the sea of two headlands, Gamrie-head and Troup- 
head, leaving between them a large open bay, with fine anchorage 
ground for vessels of any size. The view of the coast from sea, 
outside the bay, is much admired. At the bottom of the bay, the 
rocks, which are steep and rugged on either side, retire a little, 
leavmg room for the village of Gardenstown, and no more ; and 
then they rise with just as much bend from the perpendicular as 
allows mould to lie upon them, which is closely covered with green 
grass, except here and there a winding footpath like a staircase, on

which few can venture without fear and trembUng, except the na- 
tives. From the tops of these braes, as they are called, one could 
almost fancy he might peep down the chimneys of the houses ; 
and so abrupt is the rising of the ground in some places, that one 
house of three stories has them all ground floors, one entrance 
being at the front, another at the back, and the third at an end. 
On the east side of the bay, the little fishing village of Crovie lies 
about a mile from Gardenstown, with the one gable-end of the 
houses to the sea, and the other to the land, and this last is bored, 
as it were, into the bank, like a brood of young sea-fowl, nesthng 
with their heads under the dams ; and nearly at the same dis- 
tance on the west side, stands the old church and church-yard, on 
a ledge of the hill's brow ; which one would think in equal danger 
of being smothered by the hill hanging over it, and of being under- 
mined by the sea below. 

From the bay of Gamrie alone of all the coast, except at the 
western extremity, before the high rocks commence, the land rises 
gradually, that is, from the top of the braes, with more or less ac- 
clivity, for upwards of a mile into the interior. The most singu- 
lar appearance of all the other coast is, that it is not the termina- 
tion of higher lands from the interior, but that it slopes down from 
the sea towards the south, sometimes immediately, but generally 
after a few furlongs of plain on the top, and forms glens parallel 
with the shore, which are scarcely less admired than the shore it- 
self, for their rich verdure and picturesque scenery. The rocks 
themselves, or narrow hills between these glens and the sea, are 
generally covered at their tops with heath ; and to a person stand- 
ing on their highest eminences, and surveying the wide extending 
plains, woods, and mountain-tops southward and westward, and 
the threatening ocean north, the reflection can hardly fail of of- 
fering itself, that these strong barriers of the mighty deep have 
been placed before its proud waves by the hand of Omnipotence, 
as a memento of his resistless fiat, " Hitherto shalt thou come, 
and no further."" 

Another circumstance that diversifies much the appearance of the 
parish is, that the rocks on the coast are not carried wholly in a 
continuous chain from end to end, but are broken in upon with 
chasms or cross dens to their very bottoms, appearing as if the 
rocks had been rent asunder by some great convulsion. In the 
zigzag projections of the opposite sides of these cross dens, each 
protuberance of the one corresponds with a like opening of the 



0 AM RfK. 



Other. From this last appearance some think that these gulleys 
have been formed gradually during the lapse of ages, by the action 
of water washing away the soft earth, and leaving the hard rock 
standing, first abrupt, and afterwards sloped by the mouldering 
away of the sharp edges ; but the general belief is, that the glens 
were formed at once by the flood, when the windows of heaven 
were opened, and the fountains of the great deep were broken up. 
There are four of these dens, or great openings in the rocks, which 
serve as outlets for the water of the interior, and which, branching 
off, or widening as they retire from the sea, become straths or val- 
leys. The first to the westward is called Oldhaven, between the 
lands of Cullen and Melrose; the second, and principal one, east 
of the old church, called the Den of AfForsk ; the third, at the 
fishing village of Crovie ; and the fourth at Cullycan, near 
Trouphouse. Nothing can be more lovely and romantic than the 
scenery of these passes or ravines, in their approach to the sea. 
A short description of the one below the old church may be inte- 
resting, as it is the deepest of the whole, and the richest in natu- 
ral scenery. The best view of the den is from a ledge or table 
of rock about half way down the point of the Rin of Afforsk, a 
steep acclivity in the form of a wedge which separates the ravine 
into two, and where the two burns meet at the bottom. There is 
thence a view of the higher part above the church, covered with 
heath, furze, and occasional bushes of rasp and whortleberries 
blaeberries in the more sheltered spots; and below, of the beau- 
tiful deep-winding valley or ravine, with the clear brook at the 
bottom, gurgling through its numerous sinuosities, overhung some- 
times with the naked rock standing in single gray buttresses, like 
fragments of an old castle,— and then sparkling up to the steep 
banks which rise high on either side, exhibiting all the shades of 
green according to their position, with here and there a brake' of 
thorns, well-peopled with thrushes, blackbirds, linnets, and other 
songsters, which enliven the solitude with their music. The point 
of the Rin below, and all the western valley above it, as well as that 
on the east side, is loaded with a profusion of herbage, and affords 
the best field for botany in the parish. Even one who is no bo- 
tanist cannot help admiring the richness and variety of herbage 
and gaudy wild flowers in this locality. The rocky places are 
throughout ornamented at the bottom with wild geraniums, cranes- 
bills, foxglove, primroses, hawthorn, wild-roses of different colours, 
and other mdigenous flowers of the season ; while the modest wild 



274 lUNFFSIIIRK. 

Strawberry may be seen blushing in the crevices, and the green 
ivv insinuating itself into every chink, and climbing up the shelv- 
ing sides. 

Caves.- As might be supposed, amongst such gigantic masses of 
rocks, there are several caves along this coast ; and among others 
of inferior note, two in the neighbourhood of Troup deserve par- 
ticular notice. The first is about 50 fathoms deep, 60 long, and 
40 broad, from which there is a subterraneous passage to the sea, 
about 80 yards long, through which the waves are driven with 
great violence in a northern storm, and occasion a smoke to 
ascend from the den. Hence it has got the name of Hell's 
lum. The other is a subterranean passage through a penin- 
sula of about 150 yards long from sea to sea, through which a 
man can with difficulty creep. At the north end of this narrow 
pas-arre, is a cave about t20 feel high, 30 broad, and 150 long, 
containing not less than 90,000 cubic feet. The whole is sup- 
ported by immense columns of rocks, exceedingly grand, and has a 
wonderfully fine effect, after a person has crept through the nar- 
row passage. This place is called the Needle's Eye. 

Meteorologij.— The climate may be considered comparatively 
drv and healthy. The temperature varies greatly in different parts 
oithe parish, the high lands being cold and the valleys warm. It 
in general may be considered colder than the interior, owing part- 
ly to the elevation of the land, and partly to the prevalence of 
north winds and storms from the German Ocean. Less snow lies, 
however, than in the interior, owing to the exposure to sea breezes. 
The warmest and earliest part of the parish is the eastern or Troup 
district, which has the double advantage of a south exposure, 
and of shelter from the north blast by the high rocks of Troup 

head. i p tvt 

Hydrograpliij.— Ow the sea coast in the neighbourhood of Mac- 
duff, is a pretty good mineral spring, called the Well of Tarlain, 
which has been resorted to for many years by invahds, both for 
the benefit of the waters and for sea-bathing ; and the Earl of 
Fife, whose philanthropy and attention to the comforts of all with- 
in h'is reach, are proverbial, has been at considerable expense in 
making roads to it, and keeping the place neat and commodious 
for visttors. There are minerals also of the same kind at Melrose, 
near the shore of Old Haven. 

In the hill of Troup, on nearly the highest ground in the pa- 
rish, there is a very small lake called the Standard loch, formed 



GAMHir:. 27o 

by hillocks surrounding a hollow, in which there seems to be a 
spring, as the loch never dries. It is the nightly resort of wild- 
geese, early in the spring, which, however, leave it before the 
hatching season. 

There are several brooks or burns in the parish, and in general 
it is well supplied with water. The burn of the Tore, or Nether 
mill, the name of the place at its entrance into the sea, running 
northward, at the bottom of a deep- wooded glen, separates the pa- 
rish from that of Aberdour, about three or four miles, and is also 
the boundary between the counties of Banff and Aberdeen. The 
same boundary is then continued by the burn of Logie, which has 
Its source near the former, and runs in a contrary direction, se- 
parating Gamrie from the parish of King Edward for several miles, 
till it is joined by the burn of Minnonie on Pitgair. There is 
something worth observing in the natural history of this last burn. 
The deep ravine, already described, below the old church, rises 
with a steep acclivity of ground for nearly a mile, preserving about 
the same width and depth, to the highest ground on the farm of 
Afforsk. The den then continues a dead level for perhaps one 
hundred yards or more, in a peat bog at the bottom, while the sides 
are covered with furze, heath, and grass. The water there sepa- 
rates, going the one part north, to the sea at Gamrie bay, and the 
other commencing a circuitous journey southward. After receiv- 
ing contributions from a number of cross rills for about two miles, 
till it becomes strong enough to turn a mill at Minnonie, it soon 
after joins the burn of Logie, and, going southward and then west- 
ward, past the church of King Edward, it joins the Doveran, runs 
in It northward, through the parishes of King Edward, Alvah', and 
Banff, till It meets again its old mother Gamrie, who, politely ten- 
dering her left arm, conducts it to the sea. The whole revolu- 
tion from the den of Afforsk cannot be less than sixteen or eighteen 
miles, while its twin brother has a short merry race among stones, 
rocks, shrubs, and flowers, of less than one mile. 

There is a similar division of the water of Troup in the east, 
which, rising on the farm of Northfield, runs parallel with the coast 
the one part eastward into the harbour of Culiycan, and the other 
westward into the shore of Crovie. A like division also takes 
place westward of the old church, when one part runs east, into 
the den of Afforsk, and the other west, parallel with the rocks to 
the bay of Old Haven. Near its termination, viz. at the mill of 
Melrose, there is a steep and beautiful waterfall, that turns two 



OTG BANFFSHIRE. 

svater-wlieeis, the one above the other, on the different floors of 
the same house. The one for a meal-mill, and also a saw mill, 
and the other for a flour or barley-mill. Another burn comes into 
the sea at Old Haven, with a northerly course. It rises about the 
Longman hill, and in its diff-erent branches, with the help of dams, 
is compelled to thrash the corn of several farmers, m its short 
course of some two miles. A singular proof of the height of land 
in Gamrie is, that not a drop of water comes into it from any 
other parish ; the whole rises in itself. 

Geology and Miner ahgy.-Y ox interesting details respecting tlie 
geology of the parish, we refer to the following : Professor bedg- 
wick Ind Mr Murchison's papers, Geolog. Soc. Trans. 1B2/-8. 
Mr Prestwick's papers on part of the Banffshire coast, including 
Gamrie, ib. : Poissons Fossils from M. Agassiz. : Prize Essay by 
Mr Cunninghame, Plighland Soc. Trans. 1840. 

An excellent section of the parish is presented along the shore 
of the Moray Frith from the mouth of the Doveran eastward to the 
mouth of the burn of Tore, of Troup, a distance of ten miles.    
The section is particularly instructive, as it displays all the rocks 
known to occur in the parish, and as nearly as possible in the pro- 
portions occupied by them in the horizontal section of the plane. 

The principal rock in the parish has been generally believed to 
belono- to the greywacke group, at least Professor Jameson so con- 
sidersit. Sedgwick and Murchsion give no opinion, while Mr 
Prestwick seems rather inclined to refer it to the primary slates. 
The rock consists of alternate layers of greywacke, greywacke slate, 
clay-slate very much broken up and contorted, lying generally at 
high angles, often vertical, and frequently traversed by quartz 
veins of inconsiderable thickness. The general direction or stroke 
of the beds is north by east, the dip is sometimes eastward and 
sometimes westward ; various artificial lines present themselves. 
The clayslate of one locality, Melrose, was formerly wrought as 
a coarse roofing-slate and slabstone. These, however, are now 
superseded by the Foudland and Easdale primary slate. Ihe 
p-reywacke is employed as a building stone ; its basis is generally 
hiahly silicious, and the enclosed fragments are quartz and fels- 
spar with occasional pieces of clay -slate. Scarcely any other im- 
bedded minerals occur. No subordinate calcareous layers occur 
ithin the range. In a single locality, the Longmanhill, one and 
a-half miles south-west of the coast, there appears an upshot of 
granite, agreeing perfectly in lithological characters with that of 



G AMR IE. 



277 



Aberdeen. This granite is occasionally worked, but not hitherto 
to any great depth ; neither have the workings afforded any in - 
formation respecting the changes produced by it upon the strati- 
fied rocks through which it breaks. In the eastern part of the lo- 
cal section are found sandstone, conglomerate, and shales of the 
old red sandstone. These rest unconformably on the upturned 
edges of the slates, but faults and dislocations are so numerous as 
render it almost impossible to determine the exact order of succes- 
sion of the sandstone and conglomerates. 

On the farm of Findon, the Gamrie fish-bed crops out in two 
ravines. Prestwick's description of the locality is in the main cor- 
rect. The chief organic remains are contained in calcareous no- 
dules. They are principally of fish, belonging to Agassiz's divi- 
sion, Ganoids ; and many of the species are described and figured 
in his Poissons Fossils, while several species subsequently dis- 
covered remain undescribed. Vegetable remains, also undescrib- 
ed, have been found, both in the nodules and imbedding. 

The Gamrie fossils are, for the most part, identical with those 
occurring in the Caithness and Pomona schists, and in the nodules 
and limestone found at Cromarty and various parts of Morayshire. 
In the upper alluvial layers shells occur, but, so far as has yet 
been ascertained, similar to those existing on the coast at present. 

The soil of that part of the parish which rests on the sandstone 
and conglomerate is more fertile than that which rests on the 
slates, and the springs indicate a greater amount of calcareous 
matter. 

Zoology. — There was lately a goodly show of pheasants in the 
Troup plantations ; but they have been greatly thinned of late 
years by vermin in the unprotected state of the woods. Active 
means are now employed against their enemies, and it is likely 
these elegant inhabitants of the woods will soon multiply again. 

But what distinguishes the ornithology of this parish from every 
other in the county is the annual migration of sea-fowl to it, for 
the purpose of hatching and rearing their young. The following 
account of these birds, taken from the Magazine of Natural His- 
tory, is by a gentleman who carefully visits them, for the purpose 
of ascertaining their habits, generally once a year. 

" The rocks of Gamrie are annually resorted to by immense 
numbers of those birds which are properly denominated sea-fowl, 
and it is remarkable that the various tribes of which the general 
body is composed, are most punctual with regard to the particular 



278

period at which they respectively and yearly return from the cold 
regions of the north, for the important and pleasing purposes of 
incubation. 

" The varieties which appear in greatest numbers are the kit- 
tiwake provineially kittie, the razor-bill auk provincially coul- 
ter, the guillemot prnvincially queet, and, lastly, the puffin 
provincially Tammy Norrie. ■ To a stranger who visits, for the 
first time, the scene of their vernal abode, the spectacle presented 
is striking and interesting in no ordinary degree. On various por- 
tions of the immense rocks, which rise in sublime magnificence 
before him, sit thousands and tens of thousands of the birds to 
which we are now directing attention. And it is curious to ob- 
serve the regularity with which the different species attach them- 
selves to the places most suited to their various wants and capa- 
cities. The kittiwakes and guillemots inhabit the firmest and most 
precipitous of the rocks, on the ledges of which they form their 
nests. These ledges, when viewed from below, appear to the spec- 
tator as scarcely presenting an inch breadth of surface, and yet the 
birds contrive to form their nests, which, in the case of the kitti- 
wake, is done with grass, and to hatch their young in this seem- 
ingly impracticable situation ; although it somethnes, indeed, hap- 
pens, that, on being suddenly startled, their eggs tumble into the 
sea. Although associated together, however, no actual intermix- 
ture takes place between the two species, for they have each their 
own particular ledges on which they sit, drawn up like regiments of 
soldiers in the most imperturbable manner; and, if startled by more 
than ordinary alarm from their nests, they nevertheless return af- 
ter a single evolution in the air, to the important duties from which 
they had been with difficulty aroused. The two species are easily 
distinguishable. The kittiwake is at once conspicuous by its 
snow-white head and breast, its yellowish bill, and its pearly blue 
mantle ; while the guillemot is recognized by its upright figure, 
the legs being placed very far back, as is the case with most sea- 
fowl, and by the great portion of brownish sleek black with which 
its plumage is diversified.   On a promontory immediately 
adjpming, and composed of softer materials, are assembled the 
puffins, or, in the language of this part of the country, the Tammy 
Norries, which, laying their eggs in holes burrowed in the earth, 
cannot, of course, take up their abode on the hard ledges occupied 
by the birds whose position we have already described. In the 
same manner, the razor-bills, although associated with the guille- 



GAMIUE. 



279 



mots, occupy in general a separate and somewhat soft and perfo- 
rated part of these enormous precipices, which, in the busy season 
of spring, teem with Ufe in all directions. These birds the razor- 
bills very much resemble the guillemots in appearance, especially 
when seen at a distance on wing. They may, however, on a nearer 
approach, be distinguished from the latter by the broad form of 
their bills, and by the superior length of their wings, which are, 
moreover, marked by a conspicuous streak of white along their 
outward extremity. Some of this enormous body of sea-fowl pro- 
bably males are constantly in motion, either gracefully and lightly 
swimming about in detached groups on the sea, or, by their circu- 
lar evolutions in the air, indicating to the yet distant visitor the 
particular rock where he may hope to encounter them in congre- 
gated thousands. And, on a fine day, and under the mild influ- 
ence of a vernal and unclouded sun, the scene is particularly 
beautiful. The ocean lies tranquil, and stretched out before the 
spectator like an immense sheet of glass, smiling in its soft and 
azure beauty, while over its surface the kittiwake, the guillemot, 
the razor-bill, aud the puffin, conspicuous by the brilliant orange 
and scarlet of its bill and legs, are beheld wheeling with rapid wing 
in endless and varying directions. On firing a gun, the effect is 
even startling. The air is immediately darkened with multitudes 
which are aroused by the report ; the ear is stunned by the varied 
and discordant sounds which arise. The piercing wailing note 
of the kittiwake, from which its name is derived, the shrill crv of 
the Tammy Norrie, and the hoarse burst of the guillemot, resem- 
bling, as it were, the laugh of some demon, in mockery of the in- 
trusion of man amid these majestic scenes of nature. All these 
combined, and mingled occasionally with the harsh scream of the 
cormorant, are heard above the roar of the ocean, which breaks at 
the foot of these tremendous and gigantic precipices." 

Ichthyology. — The river Doveran, which discharges itself into 
the sea between this parish and that of Banff, contains salmon, 
trout, and the other common varieties of river fishes. The salmon 
caught in the river and adjoining bay, and which are cured at 
Macduff, and prepared for the London market, are let in lease by 
the proprietor, the Earl of Fife, for a rent of about L.2000 per 
annum. The river and its tributary streams yield also excellent 
sport to the angler, and are much resorted to in that way. 

But the sea is the great source of revenue to this parish, in the 
way of fishing, regarding both the amount of value derived from 



280 



BANFFSHIUE 



it, and the number of hands employed and maintained at the work. 
A variety of kinds of fish are caught on this coast, such as hng, 
cod, haddocks, whiting, turbot, skate, &amp;c., yielding a supply to the 
interior, for a considerable number of miles, of wholesome and 
comparatively cheap food ; leaving also a large surplus to be 
either pickled or dried, and carried to the friths of Forth, Clyde, 
and Tay for sale. 

Shell- Fish.— The rocky coast about Gamrie abounds in shell- 
fish. Those used as an article of food are crabs provincially 
partons and lobsters. The former are plentifully used in the 
neighbourhood, particularly the claws. The lobster, however, is 
the favourite shell-fish, and besides those used in the neighbour- 
ing district, towns, and villages, they have been taken to the Lon- 
don market of late years, by smacks, which come round for them 
periodically. They are sold at home at 6d. 8d. or Is. each, and 
very large ones at Is. 6d. 

Botany. The great variety of soil and situation occurring in 

the parish ; the precipitous cliffs on the coast ; and, above all, 
the deep ravines cut in the sandstone and conglomerate, and the 
kindly soil afforded by the decomposition of the slate, clays, and 
conglomerates, — indicate an extensive and peculiar flora ; and, had 
the parish possessed a careful resident observer, there cannot be 
a doubt that his results would do more than verify these anticipa- 
tions. 

We have received the following account from a gentleman 
John Sheir, Esq. Professor of Agriculture, Marischal College, 
Aberdeen, well acquainted with the botany of the north of Scot- 
land, and who has paid frequent visits to this locality during the 
last fifteen years : " No satisfactory account of the botany of a 
parish can be given, except by a resident observer. I have care- 
fully examined the notes I took, and the specimens preserved du- 
ring my frequent excursions to your very interesting locality; and 
thoufrh the following may not afford you all the information you 
require, I trust the principal points have not been overlooked.

The heaths, fruits, and forest-trees, are those which are com- 
mon in the north of Scotland. 

Woods, Plantations, Sc. — There are some very pretty and luxu- 
riant belts of wood in the western extremity of the parish, parti- 
cularly that on the river side, connected with the extensive plan- 
tations of Duff House, in the adjoining parishes of Alvah, Banff, 
and Kinor Edward. 

The Earl of Fife has done much to beautify and improve that 
part of the country ; and, among the late improvements, has ex- 
tended a fence with hedges on either side of the turnpike, with 
occasional clumps of trees, as also neat cottages and lodges, with 
tasteful gardens, all the way from Banff and Macduff to the 
Church of King-Edward, a distance of five miles. The chief 
plantation in the parish, however, is the Tore of Troup, which, 
together with the woods of Troup House, measures upwards of 
700 imperial acres. The principal wood is beech and Scots fir ; 
the former, much admired for the largeness of the trees and wide- 
spreading foliage. Larch-fir is now coming more into general 
use, as it is of more rapid growth, and is considered more durable 
and suitable for husbandry use than the other kinds of fir in this 
part of the country. The deepness of the numerous ravines, and 
the towering height and steepness of the banks, diverging from 
the bottom or principal glen in all shapes, and at all angles, give 
the Tore a striking resemblance to a Highland mountain-pass, 
and render the scenery altogether exceedingly romantic and 
beautiful ; while the proprietors, who have been proverbial for 
ages for good taste, have made art assist nature in rendering this 
one of the loveliest spots in the far north.

II. — Civil History. 

Parochial Registers.— The parochial registers extend no far- 
ther back than 1704. Since that time minutes of the kirk-ses- 
sion's transactions, and of the collections and distributions for the 
poor, have been regularly kept. Registers of baptisms are also 
preserved since that time ; but in these there are very frequent 
omissions, owing to the neglect of parents ; and parties are very 
frequently subjected to inconvenience and loss afterwards in con- 
sequence of these omissions. A register of marriages has also been 
kept and preserved since 1757 ; but no regular account is kept of 
deaths in the parish. 

Antiquities and Historical Events.— These may be taken toge- 
ther, as there is no modern historical event worth mentioning con- 
nected with this parish. The greatest object of antiquity is the 
Old Church, which universally-received tradition relates as hav- 
ing been built at the time of the landing of the Danes in 1004. 
The following account of the place and its tradition was furnished 
by the writer to the Aberdeen Magazine, 183-2, and is believed 
by the inhabitants to be substantially correct. 

" It is not alone by the natural beauties of the place that this 
scenery becomes a field peculiarly adapted for the fancy to sport 
in. Th-ese green hillocks, grotesque knolls, rugged rocks, and 
deep gulleys — these vales which have rested for centuries in peace, 
were once the scene of deadly conflict; for it was here that our 
far-otf ancestors had to stem the torrent of invading Danes; and 
this brook, now meandering peacefully over the smooth pebbles, 
once flowed red with the blood of the slain. I'hat green conical 
mound that tops the east bank of the den, is the castle hill of Fin- 
don. It was garrisoned with a part of the Scotch army stationed 
here to watch the landing of the Danes ; a party of whom effect- 
ed a lodgement on the opposite bank, in the place where the Old 
Church now stands. The alarm was immediately given, and com- 
municated by means of fires on the mounds, several of which 
mounds yet remain on the highest eminences of this and the neigh- 
bouring parishes, which communicated the intelligence rapidly 
through the kingdom, and quickly brought up reinforcements. 
Still the Scottish chief the Thane of Buchan considered the 
issue of an attack rather dubious, and, in order to add the enthu- 
siasm of religion to that of patriotism among his followers, made a 
solemn vow to St John, in presence of the whole army, to build a 
church to him on the spot where the invaders were encamped, on 



283 



condition that the saint would lend his assistance in dislodging 
them. The superstitious soldiers, thinking this too good an offer 
for any saint to reject, made themselves sure of St John's co-ope- 
ration, and entered with alacrity into the plans of their leader; 
who, being now sufficiently reinforced, sent a detachment round 
by the head of the den, and these, fetching a compass by the 
south-west, succeeded in gaining possession of the top of the hill, 
directly over the Danish main camp, and, by rolling down large 
stones upon the invaders, obliged them to abandon it, and to make 
their escape by the north-east brow of the hill which overhangs 
the sea, where many were killed in the flight; whence the place 
obtained the name of Ghaemrie, or the running battle. After 
being dislodged from the east, the Danes formed u new camp, 
where the entrenchments are still to be seen, which still preserv- 
ed their communication with the sea, and also with an extensive 
barren plain on the top of the hill. Meantime the whole Scottish 
army, in fulfilment of their leader's vow, set to work and built the 
church on the spot where the Danes first settled, while both par- 
ties were waiting additional reinforcements. The Danes having 
been joined by a party of their countrymen who had landed at 
Old haven of Cullen, about four miles westward, made a success- 
ful attack on the Scots, and drove them back to the castle hill ; 
and, in spite to Saint John for assisting their enemies, they pollut- 
ed his sanctuary by making it a stable for their horses. " By this 
time, however, the alarm had spread fir and wide, and the Scots, 
pouring in from all quarters, not only forced back the Danes to 
their old position on the brow of the hill, but, getting possession 
of the whole heights, and enclosing them on all sides except that 
overhanging the sea, they again commenced their murderous work 
of rolling down stones, while the helpless Danes could neither op- 
pose nor escape, and then rushing down upon them, sword in 
hand, the Scots cut them to pieces to a man. The Bleedy pots 
Bloody pits is still the name of the place, which, being incap- 
able of cultivation from its steepness and exposure to the north 
blasts, remains to this day in statu quo. Besides the round, 
the crescent, and variously angled figures in the ground, the 
graves of the Danes are yet to be seen, sunk and hollow, among 
the rank brown heather, green at the bottom, and surrounded at 
the borders with harebells and whortleberries, with fragments of 
rock and large detached stones lying around, and covered with 
moss.

" Three of the sacrilegious chiefs were discovered amongst the 
skin, by whose orders the church had been polluted ; and I have 
seen their skulls, grinning horrid and hollow, in the wall where 
they had been fixed, inside the church, directly east of the pulpit, 
and where they have remained in their prison-house 800 years 

" After the church became a neglected ruin, about twelve years 
ago, these relics of antiquity skulls were pilfered bit and bit, by 
some of the numerous visitors to the place, one was subsequent- 
ly recovered and placed, for greater security, in the Museum of 
Lit. Inst. Banff, where it is still to be seen, and nothing of them 
now remains but the holes in the wall in which they were imbed- 
ded." 

There is an old ruin in the farm of Pitgair, called Wallace Cas~ 
tie ; with very thick walls, composed of stone and lime half-vitri- 
fied, standing on a knoll, in a very romantic spot : but there is no 
history or tradition known connected with it. The walls have the 
same appearance as those of the old church, namely, that of great 
antiquity. 

Land-owner s.~The land of the parish of Gamrie is nearly 
equally divided between the Earl of Fife and Francis Garden 
Campbell, Esq. of Troup and Glenlyon, the former possessing 
the west end of the parish and the latter the east. The only ex- 
ceptions are two farms, Whitehall and Greenskairs, west of the 
old church and den of Afforsk, which, being the only unentailed 
property on the estate of Troup, were sold during Mr Garden's 
minority some years ago ; Whitehill to Dr Smith in Banff, and 
Greenskairs to Mr Al. W. Gardiner, who rents the farm and re- 
sides in the mansion-house of Melrose, in the immediate neigh- 
bourhood. Part of the Fife estates in the parish are in his Lord- 
ship's own possession, and part of them in the hands of trustees, 
in terms of a deed left by his uncle, the late James Earl of Fife. 

Emi7ieJit Persons. — Sewera] members of the ancient family of 
the Gardens of Troup have distinguished themselves in the camp, 
the Court, and Judges' hall. One of Mr Garden's predecessors, 
Alexander Garden, Esq. of Troup, was unanimously elected Mem- 
ber of Parliament for the county of Aberdeen, in the middle of 
the last century, during three successive parliaments. He was 
succeeded by his brother. Lord Gardenstoun, one of the Lords 
of Session, who was distinguished in his time as an eminent law- 
yer, a man of letters, and a gentleman of highly cultivated taste 

and intellect. Several of the family also have served their coun- 

3

try with much approbation, both at home and abroad, as officers 
in the army. The Barclays de Tolly, one of whom figured in the 
last war, had their seat in old times at Cullen, in this parish, 
and their burial-place within the church, where there still re- 
mains a Latin inscription, in old characters, recording their name 
and interment. 

Modern Buildwrjs. — The mansion-house of Troup, which was 
built principally for a sea-view, about seventy years ago, seems at 
a distance as having rather a bare appearance, from want of wood 
on the south and east sides; but this appearance gradually wears 
off in approaching, and when the approach is made, the situation 
IS found to have been well chosen. The ground rises to such a 
distance in front, towards the south, that wood in that quarter, 
more or less, would impose a look of confinement and closeness on 
the whole scenery :— while the opening to the east leaves to the 
windows in that part of the house, a splendid prospect of the gi- 
gantic rocks of Pennon, which, when seen in a mild evening, gild- 
ed by the setting sun, and relieved on the one side by the smooth 
blue ocean ; and on the other, by the various shades'of green, in 
the highly cultivated fields, knolls, brakes, and gulleys, presents 
a scene of natural grandeur seldom equalled. 

In the close vicinity of the house, there are two beautiful ra- 
vines, meetingat right angles, and nearly half surroundingit, the one 
on the west and the other on the north. The latter, after passing 
the house, rises with a gentle acclivity, leaving a fine southern ext 
posure for garden and pleasure-ground. As these glens were 
tastefully laid out with walks, and planted some thirty or forty 
years ago, they are now smiling in all the beautv which wood and 
water, well tramed, can give to a place that w'ould be beautiful 
without either, from its natural position of banks and braes. As 
these woods and valesare little seen in the approach from the east 
the effect to a stranger arriving from that quarter is heiahtened by 
agreeable surprise.   

The house itself has been allowed to go into considerable dis- 
repair during the long minority of the present landlord, as well as 
the sweet Norwegian cottages of the Tore ; but when the improve- 
ments on the house, &amp;c. projected by the young and spirited 
proprietor, are carried into execution, it will be exceeded as a ba 
ronial residence, by few in the north, and hardly bv anv in natu 
ral beauty of site. " '

IV. — Industry. 
AgricuUure and Rural Economy.— aie land has been im- 
proved of late years to a very considerable extent, and its improve- 
ment, in most cases, has yielded ample remuneration for expense 
and labour. These improvements, together with the superior 
mode of cultivating land now in use, have altogether more than 
doubled the produce of the soil in this parish since 1790. There 



287 



i-emains yet a large proportion of waste ground that might be 
brought under cuUivation with advantage. 

The extent of the Troup estate, according to a late survey, when 
reduced froni Scots to imperial acres, is as follows: — , 

Imp. acres arable Do. pasture Do. wood or Roads, stances 
or cultivated. or waste. planting. of houses, &amp;c 

Troup estate, . 4665 . 4655 . 721 . 184 

Whitehill and Greenskains, 360 . 502 . 0 , 9 

Whole, 5025 5157 "72 ~193 

Altogether Troup, Whitehill, and Greenskains, are generally 
considered as amounting to half the parish, both as to extent and 
value of land ; and the following may be taken as a fair average 
calculation of the whole in imperial acres : — 

Acres cultivated, . . 10,000 

Acres pasture or waste land, . 10,000 

Acres in wood, . . 75Q 

Acres in roads, houses, &amp;c. . 300 

Of the 10,000 acres waste land, about 3000 or 4000 may be 
capable of tillage, and would yield a fair remuneration for capital 
laid out on it. The remainder, from the mountainous nature of 
the ground, want of water on the heights, and other causes, may 
be considered irreclaimable.

The rent per acre varies according to the locality,and the qua- 
lity of the soil. Good land in the neighbourhood of Macduff rents 
from L 3 to L.l ; the best farm land in the country part, from 
i.. 2, 10.., and descends, according to the quality, to about 15s. 
The average rent of a farm may be from L.2 to L.l, 15s. accord- 
ing to the quality. 

Recent Agricultural Improvemenfs.—VXoughmg and farm-work 
are, in general, carried to a high degree of improvement in this 
parish and neighbourhood. 

The agricultural improvements which have tended much of late 
years to increase the value of the produce of the soil have been

manure ; 2. bone manure ; 3. draining; 4. the ready conveyance 
of grain and cattle to the London market by sea ; and 5. the su- 
perior mode of culture, and increased attention to the selection 
of grains suited to the soil, and to the breeding and reanng of 
cattle. 

I have been favoured with the following account from Mr Gar- 
diner of Greenskains, of the improvements on his farm, which are 
a good specimen of the improvements in the parish generally 
« The first of the more recent agricultural improvements I 
would take notice of, is bone manure, which was used by me first 
in the vear 1829, and I have continued to use it in large quanti- 
ties, every successive year, since that time ; raising fine crops of 
turnips, and the other crops in the rotation equally good ; the grass 
after the bone manure is particularly rich, and I have often observe 
ed that the cattle eat it in preference to grass, after any other ma- 
nure. The advantages to be derived from this manure in this 
part of the country are incalculable. 

« The additional turnips raised by it keep a greater number of 
cattle during the winter, and they of course increase the quantity, 
and improve the quality of the farm-yard's dung, which being laid 
upon the farm the following year with a little more bone dust, 
must go on increasing the fertility of the farm to a very conside- 
rable extent; and the facility we have here of shipping the cattle 
to London, and other great markets generally, causes a good de- 
mand for the extra number of cattle kept. 

» The next improvement I would take notice of Is the wedge- 
draining, or, as it is termed, the frequent draining system of i\Ir 
Smith of Deanston. I commenced this operation in 1834, and, 
since that time, I have put in about 10,000 ells of these drains, 
and have found the advantage of them very great, both from the 
increased quantity of corn raised, and also the superior quality of 
the grass. This, if properly followed out according to Mr Smith's 
plan, I consider the greatest of our modern improvements ; but 
the expense is so great, that few tenants on a nineteen year's lease 
would be justified in going on with it to any great extent, without 
the proprietor bearing part of the expense. But I am perfectly 
satisfied, that there is a very great deal of the arable land m this 
parish that could be more than doubled in value by this improve- 

would next notice the introduction of the short-horned breed 
-jf cattle. I have had that breed on my farm since 1835, and find 



G AMR IK, 



2S9 



them thrive uncommonly well, both the pure breed and the first 
cross from the Aberdeenshire. I can bring them, and have done 
so, to a greater weight at three years' old, than I used to have the 
native breed at four year's old ; their quality for feeding is decid- 
edly superior ; but I do not consider they would be a proper stock 
for the parish, but on the best farms. I have no hesitation in say- 
ing, that for the same quantity of good keep, this will return more 
money than any other cattle that can be put upon it. But they 
will never do to be sent to pasture on a heather hill. 

" I have kept a flock of about 200 Cheviot sheep for twelve years, 
bred from the best stocks in Ross-shire and Sutherland. They were 
at firstprincipally kept on natural grass pasture on the sea braes and 
burnside, and thrive remarkably well. Within the last few years, I 
have crossed them with pure Leicester tups, which has increased their 
size, their propensity to fatten, and also the quantity of their wool. 
Since using the Leicester tups, I have, in addition to their former 
natural pasture, been in the habit of depasturing most of my thin 
arable land by them, which I consider a great advantage on the 
poor land, first, because a sheep will fatten where an ox would 
starve, and second, the manner their dung is scattered over the 
land must add more to its fertility, than if the grass were eaten bv 
cattle. I also allow them in spring a proportion of the turnips on 
the worst land, to be consumed on the ground. For the reasons 
I have stated above, it is my humble opinion that the poorest of 
the arable land in this parish would be more profitable, if stocked 
with sheep, than with cattle." 

Duration of Leases, Crops, SfC — The general length of form 
leases in this parish is for the period of nineteen years. A few 
old liferent leases still remain on the estate of Troup ; but none 
are given in that way now. The feus in Macduff and Garden- 
ston are perpetual. 

The chief crops raised in the parish are oats. Barley is raised 
to a considerable extent, and Scotch bear on some of the farms- 
wheat, pease and beans, but rarely. Hav, potatoes, and turnipV 
are raised m regular rotation with oats. Large quantities of grain 
are shipped annually for the London and other markets, while 
barley and bear are generally sold to the home brewers and dis- 
tillers. 

There are two rotations of cropping throughout the parish ac 
cording as the nature of the different farms is found suitable thp 
seven years and the five years. The former consists of two' crops 



290 BANFFSHIRE. 

of oats, one of turnip or potatoes, one of barley or oats, and three 
of rass. The five ears' rotation has one crop of oats, one of 
turnips or potatoes, one of barley or oats, and two of grass. Land 
is scarcely ever fallowed here, except before a crop of wheat. 

Mannfactures.—T\xeve are five meal-mills in the parish, three 
saw.miUs, one for grinding bones for manure, and another build-- 
ing. At Mr Carny's manufactory of rope and sails at Macduff, 
50 tons hemp for sails, value L.1500; nets, L. 900 ; total, 
L.2400. Capital of the Gas Light Company, L. 1800, pays 5 
per cent. Capital of the bone and saw-mill company, L. 10,000. 

Of the three fishing stations in the parish, the following account 
is taken in answer to minute inquiries at the principal curers. The 
cod, ling, and small fish are principally sold in the towns on the 
south and W3st friths, the herrings at Stettin, Hamburgh, Russia, 
Ireland, the West Indies, &amp;c.

Nrvic/ation —There is a very commodious harbour at Macduff, 
huilt chiefly at the expense of the Earl of Fife, the proprietor. 
An outer harbour was attempted to be built about twenty years 

o at the expense of the same munificent nobleman ; but it was 
Ifmost wholly destroyed by successive storms. The remaining 
part of it hasbeen secured, and is of considerable use as a break-

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Toioiis. — There is a weekly provision market at Mac- 
duff on Tuesday, and at Banff, inlhe immediate neighbourhood, 
on Friday. Macduff" was constituted a royal burgh by charter bv 
George III. in 1783, through the influence of James Earl of Fife", 
who patronized and greatly improved it. In the early part of the 
last century, it was only a small fishing village, containing only a 
few houses, and was called Down ; while the land was let in farms. 
Earl James changed it to Macduff", after his own family name, 
which is Duff". It is included by the Reform Act within the 
boundaries of the burgh of Banff", but retains its separate magis- 
trate,, namely, a provost, two bailies, and four councillors, elected 
by the feuars. 

Villages.— The village of Gardenstown appears fiom a record 
in the baptismal register to have been built in the year 1720, and has 
remained nearly stationary, as to size and population, ever since. 

The fishing village of Crovie is above a mile eastward of Gar- 
denstown. The date of its commem:ement is unknown, but sup- 
posed to be about the same as that of Gardenstown, and Down or 
Macduff". 

A small village called the Longman was commenced on the 
top of a hill of the same name, about twenty years ago, by the 
Earl of Fife, on the Banff" and Peterhead turnpike; and as the 



2f2 BANFFSHIUK. 



surrounding waste land was let out in small portions to the feuars, 
the whole in that neighbourhood has been reclaimed, and is now 
in a state of cultivation. The locality has, therefore, more the cha- 
racter and appearance of a colony of small crofters regularly set 

down, than of a village. 

Means of Communication.- A stage-coach, which used to carry 
the mail, passes from Banff to Peterhead daily, through the south 
district of the parish, for upwards of seven miles. A foot post 
goes on alternate days on the old coast road, the whole length ot 
the parish from Banff to Fraserburgh, through Aberdour and Pit- 
sliao, going one day and returning the other. A earner also goes 
reaularly twice a week from Gardenstown to Banff, and another 
carrier goes weekly between Aberdeen and Gardenstown. 

The Fraserburgh postman has no house for the delivery oi his 
letters in the parish, except at Macduff. An application is about 
to be made for a post-office at Dubford, which the postman passes, 
and where cross roads branch off in all directions ; and as there 
is a considerable amount of correspondence connected with the 
trade, fishing, and shipping in Gardenstown, as well as from the 
interior, it is hoped the application will be successful, as the want 
of a post-office is the greatest privation in the way of communica- 
tion that the parish has to endure. 

Ecclesiastical State.-lt would be impossible for one church to 
accommodate the whole of this parish, on account of its length and 
population. To remedy this, a very neat and commodious church 
was built at Macduff, by the late James Earl of Fife, and allow- 
ed a small salary for the minister. It has been used as a Chapel 
of Ease for many years, with the half of the parish attached to it, 
as to population, and about one-third in regard to extent. 

The parish church now stands about the centre of the eastern 
or Gamrie district, and is as convenient for the parishioners 
as the very uneven nature of the land and roads admits of. It was 
built in the year 1830, is a very neat and comfortable place of 
worship, and abundantly commodious for the congregation, being 
seated for 1000 sitters, and capable of holding considerably more. 
An excellent manse was built in the vicinity of the church for the 
minister, with a suitable steading of offices. The extent of the 
olebe is about 13 acres, of which about 10 or 11 are arable. The 
value is about L. 13. The amount of stipend is 16 chalders of 
victual, Linlithgow measure, half barley and half oatmeal, calcu- 



GAM R IE.

lated annually at the fiar prices for the county. There is also 
L.8, 6s. 8d. allowed for communion elements. 

The great bulk of the population in this parish are members of 
the Established Church ; and their attendance both at the parish 
church and at the chapel of Macduff is in general regular and 
punctual, when the weather and roads permit.

Three or four families, in the south-west of the parish, attend 
the church of King- Edward, which is much nearer them; and a 
few on the borders of King-Edward parish, farther east, attend 
the church of Gamrie for the same reason. The sacrament of 
the Lord's Supper is dispensed once a-year at both churches, 
with generally upwards of 700 communicants each. The young 
are admitted to communion for the first time, after careful instruc- 
tions and examinations by the ministers for months previous, and 
strict inquiry into their moral and religious character. The Crown 
is the sole patron of the parish, and the Earl of Fife's Trustees 
appoint the minister of MacdufF, and pay him a salary of L.80, 
which they have raised to L.lOO for some years past; but, as 
they will give no bond for his stipend, he has not been admitted 
to the rank of a qicoad sac7'a minister, although ordained to the 
pastoral office. The Rev. Thomas Wilson is the third of his fix- 
mily, in a direct line, who has held the office of parish minister 
of Gamrie. His grandfather was ordained to that charge in 1732. 

Education. — There are two parochial schools in the parish ; 
one at Gamrie, and the other at MacdufF ; each has the salary 
settled by law in such cases, of L.25, 13s. 3d. with a share af 
the Dick Bequest. The amount of fees average at MacdufF about 
E.50, and at Gamrie, L.25. The schoolmaster of Gamrie's 
other emoluments, as session-clerk, amount to L.12, making his 
living altogether about L.90, with a house and small garden, the 
rent of which is paid gratuitously by Mr Garden of Troup, as 



BANFFSHint:. 



that of the schoohnaster of Macduff is by the Earl of Fife's Trus- 
tees. 

One private school is now taught at Troup ; another at Gardens- 
town. A handsome new school is erecting at the Longman village 
by the Earl of Fife, and subscribers in the neighbourhood. There 
are three private or subscription male schools in the parish, besides 
several other chance schools, both male and female, in Macduff. 
The number of children at the parochial school of Macduff, at 
one time, mav average about 110; those at Gamrie about 50. 
The whole children at school in Macduff, 300 ; in the other 
parts of the parish, above 200. There is a female school in Mac- 
duff, with a house and moderate endowment, for the useful and 
common branches of female education, such as reading, sewing, 
knitting, &amp;c. ; and one at Gardenstown, not endowed. It would 
be a great benefit to this part of the country, if the parochial sys- 
tem were extended, and made to embrace female as well as male 

education. ... 

Sabbath-school teaching has been in full operation in this pa- 
rish for some considerable time past. There are about '200 at- 
tending the Sabbath school of Macduff, under the superintendence 
of the'' minister and schoolmaster, with six or eight subordinate 
teachers, male and female ; and nearly an equal number attend 
the different Sabbath-schools in the Gamrie district, under the 
superintendance of the parish minister ; but these are in general 
more thinly attended in summer than in winter. 

lAbrariefi.— There is a good circulating library in Macduff, es- 
tablished and supported chiefly by subscription, and the aid of libe- 
ral donations from the Earl of Fife. There is no public library 
in the Gamrie district, although attempts have been made to have 
one established. The parochial schoolmaster procured the Kil- 
dare Street Library for the use of his scholars, which he finds a 
great benefit in giving them a taste for useful reading. The mi- 
nister has also procured one of the Tract Society's Libraries for 
the Sabbath scholars, which is also very well employed and useful. 

Savings Bank. — A parish savings bank, on the national system, 
was established at Gamrie in 1836, is succeeding remarkably well, 
and gives promise of becoming of vast benefit to the labouring 
community. The amount of deposits in August 3 840 was above 
L.1300. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The poor's funds of this parish are 
nearly exhausted. L.200 was left by the tninister's uncle, Hugh 



GAMRIE. 



295 



Wilson, Esq. of Jamaica; and L. 20 by a Mr West, for annuities 
to be paid to certain poor individuals specified ; but the sum is not 
available for the general poor. The average number of paupers 
on the roll is 100, besides about twenty families that receive occa- 
sional aid. The distributions for the relief of single families are, 
largest, L.7, 16s. ; smallest, 6s. ; average, L. 2, 3s. 6d. Average 
amount of contributions for the poor, from church collections, 
L. 100 ; from voluntary assessment of the heritors, L. 100 ; from 
alms, legacies, &amp;c., L.50. The heritors assessed themselves last 
year to the amount of L.lOO to supply present wants; but it is to 
be feared a public assessment cannot long be avoided. 

Inns. — Low public-houses have been a great nuisance in this 
parish and neighbourhood, for a considerable number of years. 
There are far too many of them yet in the town of Macduff and 
the villages. 

Fuel — There was peat fuel in the parish, but it is all exhausted. 
There is, however, an inexhaustible stock of peat moss, in the hills 
of Kinbean and Overbrae, in the parishes of Aberdour and King- 
Edward, and from this the farmers drive a considerable portion of 
their fuel during summer, at a time when there is little else to do for 
their servants and horses. Were it not for this, peats would be much 
more expensive fuel in this parish than coals, which are imported 
in sufficient abundance during summer to Macduff, Gardenstown, 
and occasionally to Cullycan, generally from the Newcastle and 
Sunderland mines. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
A remarkably good feeling has existed, time out of mind, in this 
parish, between landlord and tenant. The Earls of Fife and the 
Gardens of Troup have been proverbial for ages as good land- 
lords. One consequence of this is, that the land is not rack-rent- 
ed, and the cultivators of the soil are in general what is called 
well to live; while the landlord, on the other hand, has seldom 
to complain of ill paid rents. It is a rule with both landlords ne- 
ver to move a well doing tenant. And many is the instance in 
which the farmer can say or sing, 

" The farm I now hold on your honour's estate 
Is the same which my grandfather tilled," &amp;c. 

Another peculiarity among the tenantry, which proceeds, no 
doubt, from the same cause, is an endless chain of connec- 
tion, running through them by kindred and intermarriages. 
W'ith few exceptions, the families of the whole farms on the 



t 



290 



BANFFSHIRK. 



estate of Troup are all related in some way to each other. This 
system of clanship is carried still farther among the fishing 
population in the villages; the most of whom in Crovie and 
Gardenstown are of the name of Watt or Wiseman, so that they 
are obliged to have recourse to nicknames for the sake of distinc- 
tion. It is a rare thing for them to marry but among themselves, 
as the manners and habits, as well as the work of the rural popu- 
lation, are quite difFerent from theirs. The influx of strangers, 
however, at the time of the herring-fishing leads both sexes to form 
connection with strangers, which will likely in time give more va- 
riety of names.

Name. The parish takes its name from the church, which war» 

dedicated, previous to the Reformation, to St Michael, and called 
after his name, St Michael's Kirk, or Kirkmichael. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish is upwards of 30 miles in 
length from north to south along the banks of the Avon, a tribu - 
tary branch of the Spey ; and its average breadth is from 3 to 4 
miles. Only about eighteen miles of its length is inhabited. The 
other twelve or fifteen miles stretch into the Grampian hills, and are 
uninhabited. Of this territorial extent, about nine miles of the inha- 
bited part, and all the uninhabited portion, lie in the quoad sacra pa- 
rish of Tom.intoul. The main range of the Grampian mountains 
on the south, and branches of that range running from south to 
north on the east and west form its boundaries, and encircle it, ex- 
cept on the north, where it joins the parish of Inveravon in a nar- 
row neck at the outlet of the Avon.

goruni, the highest mountain in the Grampian chain, lies in the 
southern extremity of the parish. The forest of Glenavon 
contains from 60,000 to 70,000 imperial acres, and has been 
lately set off by the Duke of Richmond, the proprietor, as 
a deer-forest. Cairngorum and Benmacdui rise respectively 
to the heiorhts of 4060 and 4362 feet above the level of the 
sea, and retain the unmelted snow in the ravines on their am- 
ple sides generally all the year round. The general appearance 
of the parish is mountainous. Its inhabited parts consist of the 
narrow valley of the Avon, and the tributary glens of the Conglass 
and Kebat on the east, and the Lochy on the west. 

Meteorology. — The temperature of the atmosphere, as ascer- 
tained at Tomintoul by daily observation at 9 a. m., for the year 
1839, was as follows : The observations were made on Fahrenheit''s 
thermometer in the shade. Average monthly temperature, Janu- 
ary, 25°; February, 27t ; March, 29 ; April, 36°; May, 42 ; 
June, 56°; July, bQY; August, 52f°; September, 49 Octo- 
ber, 41|°; November, 34i°; December, 29}°. Average daily tem- 
perature for the year, 43,. The coldest day was the 26th Novem- 
ber, 8°, and the warmest the 17th June, 79°. An extraordinary 
snow storm occurred on the 13th May, and continued to the 16th. 
The snow drifted to the depth of many feet. On the 14th, the ther- 
mometer stood on an average of the whole day, 6° under the freezing 
point. The pressure of the atmosphere was as follows : Average 
monthly pressure, January, 28.99 inches ; February, 28.92 in. ; 
March, 29. 13 in. ; April, 29.6 in. ; May, 29,57 in. ; June, 29.46 in. ; 
July, 29.29 in. ; August, 29.44 in. ; September, 28.88 in. ; Octo- 
er, 29.66 in. ; November, 29.2 in. ; December, 29.13 in. Average 
pressure for the year was 29.37 inches. The pressure was least 
on the 7th January at 9 a. m., 26.3 inches, and greatest on the 
29th October at 9 a. m., 30.7 inches. 

Hydrography. — The only river worthy of the name in the parish 
is the Avon, or rather this water is a deep rapid stream, clear as 
crystal, which, after running a course of about forty miles, and be- 
ing increased by many tributary streams, falls into the Spey at 
Ballindalloch, in the parish of Inveravon. Salmon is found in the 
Avon from the month of June till towards the latter end of the 
year. 

Lakes. — Lochavon lies in the southern extremity of the parish, 
in the bosom of the Grampian mountains. It is estimated at three 
miles long and a mile broad. The scenery around it is particu-

larly wild and magnificent. The towering sides of Bein-bord, Rein- 
niacdui, Cairngornm, an d Bein-bainac, rise all around it, and their 
rugged bases skirt its edges, except at the narrow outlet of the Avon, 
at its eastern extremity. Its water is quite luminous, and of great 
depth, especially along its northern side. It abounds in trout of 
a black colour and slender shape, differing much in appearance 
from the trout found in the limpid stream of the Avon, which is- 
sues from it. At the west end of the lake is the famous Clach- 
dhian or shelter stone. This stone is an immense block of gra- 
nite, which seems to have fallen from a projecting rock above it, ris- 
ing to the height of several hundred feet, and forming the broad 
shoulder of Benmacdui. The stone rests on two other blocks 
imbedded in a mass of rubbish, and thus forms a cave sufficient to 
contain twelve or fifteen men. Here the visitor to the scenery 
of Lochavon takes up his abode for the night, and makes himself as 
comfortable as he can, where " the Queen of the storm sits," and 
at a distance of fifteen or twenty milis from all human abode. 
There are various other small lakes called na-du-lochan or the 
black lochieSi a little to the south-east of Lochavon, towards the 
forest of Braemar. These also abound in trout, and afford good 
sport to the angler. Lochbuilg lies between Inchrory and the 
Garrou on the Beallach-dearg road. It is upwards of a mile long 
and about half that breadth, and abounds also in trout. 

Geolof/.— The whole range of the Grampian Hills is compos- 
ed of granite rock. There is a bed of sandstone of rather soft and 
friable quality, running across the whole breadth of the parish 
at Tomintoul ; and farther down, there is a bed of slate-stone, 
also running across the parish near the parish church. There is 
a slate quarry wrought in this bed close by the banks of the Avon. 
It produces excellent gray slates and pavement slabs, not inferior 
perhaps to any in Scotland. Limestone abounds in almost every 
part of the parish. Ironstone is found in the south-eastern extre- 
mity of the parish, in the Hill of the Leacht. About a century 
ao-o, the iron ore from this place was transported sixteen miles 
across the country on horseback, and manufactured with charcoal 
from the woods of Abernethy by an Iron Company established 
there. The ore is considered rich, and is to be found in great 
abundance. Fluor spar is found in the Braes of Avon, and there 

' Specimens of it have been analyzed and found to contain 83 per cent, of iron. It 
is also interspersed with rich veins of manganese, of which a considerable quantity 
has been dug out, in the course of last summer, by workmen employed by the Duke 
of Richmond. It is proposed to carry on the mining of this valuable mineral, which

is an extensive marl-bank close by the Avon, a little below Inch- 
rory, in the southern extremity of the inhabited part of the parish, 
but it is not available for agricultural purposes, from the want of 
a road to it. If there were any access to this marl-bank, it would 
be of great value in the parish. 

There is a considerable portion of the arable soil alluvial, i. e. 
on the haughs of the Avon, and its tributary streams ; and the 
greatest part of the remainder rests on lime-rock, and consists of 
a rich loam. The soil, on the whole, is productive, and wor- 
thy of a betterclimate. 

ZwIo/i/.—The eagle is still found in the forest of Glenavon. It 
builds its eyrie in some inaccessible rock, and continues from year 
to year to hatch its young in the same spot. One of these noble 
birds was killed some years ago, which measured upwards of six 
feet from tip to tip of the wings. The following incident, illus- 
trative of the habits of birds and beasts of prey, may not be un - 
worthy of notice. One of the keepers of the forest being one day 
reclining on the side of a hill, observed an eagle hovering about 
for its prey, and darting suddenly down, it caught hold of 
a polecat, with which it rose up and flew away in the direc- 
tion of an immense cliff on the opposite hill. It had not pro- 
ceeded far, when he observed it abating its course, and descending 
in a spiral direction, until it reached the ground. He was led from 
curiosity to proceed towards the spot, which was about a mile dis- 
tant from him, and there he found the eagle quite dead, with its 
talons transfixed in the cat. The cat was also dead, with its 
teeth fixed in the eagle's gullet. Foxes were, some years ago, nu- 
merous in the mountain ranges of the parish, and were very de- 
structive to the flocks, but it is believed that they are now nearly 
extirpated. Otters, weasels, polecats, and rabbits, are found in 
the parish. All sorts of game, such as grouse, hares, snipe, and 
partridges, abound over the whole parish. Ptarmigan, also, are 
numerous on the Grampian hills. Exclusive of the immense forest 
of Glenavon, now being stocked with deer, the shooting on the 
Duke of Richmond's portion of the hills alone lets at about L.300 
a-year. 

The domestic animals are all of the ordinary kind, but conside- 

it is expected will pay well and give employment to a number of work people. Plum- 
bago is also found ui considerable quantity and of good quality in the immediate 
neighbourhood.

II. — Civil History. 
Eminent Me/i.— Of military officers connected with the parish, 
may be mentioned Major- General William Alexander Gordon, C. 
B.of Inverlochy, ofthe ancient and respectable Gordons of Crough- 
ly, an officer of undaunted courage and intrepidity, who, at the 
memorable battle of the Nieve, at the head of the light infantry of 
General Hill's division, led the van in crossing the river, dislodged 
the enemy on the opposite bank, and turned the fortune of the day 
in favour of the British arms. The General still hvesto enjoy hiswell 
earned honours and the respect of his countrymen. He had three 
brothers officers in the army, one of whom, James Gordon, Esq. of 
Revack, in Strathspey, retired from the paymastership ofthe 9-2d 
Highlanders at the close of the Peninsular war, and now lives be- 
loved and respected by bis family, and a numerous circle of friends 
and acquaintances.— Another family, that of the late Mr Samuel 
Middletonof Inveroury, has been equally eminent in the military de- 
partment. One of his sons. Lieutenant- Colonel William Middle- 
ton, an accomplished gentleman and officer, has lately retired from 
the command of the 42d Highlanders, after an active service of 
more than thirty years, principally abroad. Another of them, 
Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Middleton, retired from the command 
of a cavalry regiment some years ago, and two more of his sons, 
John and Alexander, the one a captain, and the other a quarter- 
master, lost their lives in the service of their country. The pro- 
motion of this family rested solely on their own individual me- 
rit and bravery. — Another family, that of the late Captain Robert 
Macgregor of Delavorar, also furnished four meritorious officers 
for the King's service. The last of them. Captain Charles Mac- 
gregor, a worthy gentleman and magistrate, died at Delavorar some 
years ago. 

Land-owners. — The sole land-owners are the Duke of Rich- 
mond and the Earl of Seafield. The former owns about nine- 
tenths, and the latter about one -tenth of the parish. 

Parochial Registers.— parochial registers have been very 
imperfectly kept. There are no original records previous to the 
beginning of the present century. At that period, there were some 
fragments of registers of births and marriages extending as far back 
as the year 1725. These were collected and transcribed about the 
year 1 800, but there are considerable blanks in the manuscript. 



KIRK MICHAEL.

The earliest entry in the register of births is in the year 1725, and 
of marriages, in 1726. There are no records of minutes of disci- 
pline previous to the year 1810, and even since that period, these 
records have not been regularly kept. 

III. — Population. 
The population, taken at different times during the last eighty- 



four years, is as under : —

Of the population of 1831, there were 836 males, and 905 fe- 
males. During upwards of fifty years previous to the commence- 
ment of the present century, the population appears to have re- 
mained nearly stationary. But, during the first thirty years of this 
century, it increased between 400 and 500. This increase has 
been owing to the introduction of an improved system of husbandry 
during that period, and the great kindness of Dukes Alexander 
and George Gordon to their tenantry, and their desire to continue 
them and their famiHes on the estate, and promote their wel- 
fare. It may also be mentioned, as conducing to this increase of 
the population, that Alexander Duke Gordon gave great encou- 
ragement to the village of Tomintoul ; in consequence of which 
the village increased from 37 to 143 families during the same period. 

Since the year 1831, there has been a decrease of 19 on the 
population. This decrease is accounted for by the great failure 
of the crops during the last four years, and by the village of To- 
mintoul having been enlarged beyond the maximum of its resources 
for supporting its inhabitmts, many of whom are now obliged to 
leave it ; and also by a desire, manifested on the part of the pro- 
prietors, to enlarge the farms in the parish, with the view of in- 
creasing the comfort of those who occupy the soil ; and it is more 
than probable, that, from the operation of the two last mentioned 
causes, the population will continue to decrease, at least for some 
time.

From this table, which has been constructed from the registers, 
it appears that the average Protestant births in the guoad sacra 
parish of Tomintoul, among a population of 623, has been, for 
each of the last seven years, 20f ; and in Kirkmichael, among a po- 
pulation of 614, 6f ; and among a Roman Catholic population of 
485 171. Average annual births in the whole parish, 44. lrom 
a comparison of the Protestant population allocated to the parish 
church, with the number of births, it is evident that not a third of 

them is registered. 

The number of Protestant marriages for the last seven years in 
the quoad sacra parish of Tomintoul is 14, average yearly 2 ; at 
Kirkmichael, 32, average yearly, 4f ; Roman Catholics lb, ave- 
rage yearly, 2f . Average yearly in the parish, 8f . There is no

spinsters. There are 313 under twelve vears of age, and 187 un- 
der seven years. There are 187 who usually employ themselves 
as servants,— being 120 more than the number of individuals in 
that capacity which the parish requires. 

The number of illegitimate births for the last twelve years is 
somewhat under an average of 3 each year. 

There are 362 families in the parish. The average number of 
individuals m each family is 5 in the landward part of the parish, 
and 3f m the village. There are two fatuous persons, and two 
dumb. 

The language generally spoken is the Gaelic, but it has de- 
creased very considerably within the last forty years. There is 
not an indmdual between twelve and forty yeas of age who can- 
not speak English. They all read Engli'sh, and the.e are many 
ot the rismg generation who cannot speak Gaelic.

v.— Parochial Economy. 
Village. — Tomintoul is the only village in the parish. It is 
situated about five miles south of the parish church. It was com- 
menced in the year 1750, and now contains a population of 530. 
It has five markets held annually in it. There is no system of po- 
lice established. The villagers subsist chiefly on the produce of 
their tenements and the small lots of land which they rent from 
the heritor. The average quantity of land attached to each tene- 
ment is about two acres. There are 120 tenements, and 143 fa- 
milies, 56 of the families occupy all the land. The tenure is 
a 114 years' lease of the tenement, consisting of 36 falls. The 
lease commenced in 1825. There is no branch of trade or ma- 
nufacture established in the village, and the lots of land are too 
small for the comfortable maintenance of those who occupy them. 
There are 87 families depending on handicraft, trade, or on their 
industry as common labourers, or on charity for their maintenance. 
The site of the village was a bleak and barren moor previous to 
Its erection in 1750, and still from its exposed situation, and hav- 
ing no wood near it, it presents a bleak and barren aspect. It is 
the highest in elevation above the sea, and probably the farthest 
distant from the sea of any village in Scotland of the same extent 
and population. 

Means of Communication.— The parish presents the greatest fa- 
cilities and inducements for being made one of the most public 
thoroughfares of any Highland parish in Scotland, yet it is curi- 
ous, if not extraordinary, fact, that it is shut out from all commu- 
nication with the surrounding countries, and remains at this mo- 
ment nearly as unapproachable as it was a hundred years ao 
A\ hilst the improvements of late years have brought turnpike roads

within some miles of it on the north and east, aione of them have 
vet reached its boundaries, and on the south and west there is not 
; turnpike within thirty miles of it. There is a daily post to To- 
mintoul, and several small carriers go weekly, or as occasion re- 
quires, to Elgin and Forres. The supply of merchant goods is 
brought chiefly from Aberdeen. The long-projected south and 
north line of road from the shores of the Moray Fnth to Perth, 
lies through the parish. This line of road, if opened, would 
create a transit of all marketable commodities, both to the north 
and south, and bring Elgin and Perth about fifty miles nearer each 
other. An east and west line from Aberdeen to Inverness also 
lies through the parish. This line if opened, would cross the for- 
mer in the village of Tomintoul, and be fully as short as the pre- 
sent line by Keith and Huntly. There are only twenty-one miles 
of it to open from Grantown to Strathdon, through this parish. 
The opening of these two great lines of road would promote the 
means of communication in every direction, and conduce greatly 
to the improvement and prosperity of the parish. The present 
mail route between Tomintoul and Perth by Dundee and Aber- 
deen, is 167 miles, whereas by the proposed line by Braemar it 
is only 67. This line was surveyed in the year 1810 by direction 
of the Commissioners for making Highland roads and bridges. It 
was again surveyed in the year 1832, by direction of the Lord 
Lieutenant of Morayshire, and other noblemen and gentlemen m- 
terested; and again in 1839 by direction of the trustees of the 
Blairgowrieand bridge of Cally turnpike road. The total estimated 
expense of completing the whole line from Elgin to Perth is van- 
Gusly stated in these surveys at about L.18,000 to L. 23,100. It 
is calcutated that the free revenue to be derived from tolls would 
yield 5 per cent, interest for upwards of L. 13,000 of this sum, and 
that about L. 10,000 will have to be subscribed by the heritors and 
others more immediately benefited by the undertaking, It is much 
to be regretted that after so many repeated attempts, during up- 
wards of thirty years, this comparatively small sum could not be 
raised for the accomplishment of such a great national improvement. 
The only portion of the line at present impassable by wheeled 
carriages lies between Tomintoul and Castletown of Braemar, a dis- 
tance of twenty-one miles, and the highest estimate for opening 
this portion, including the expense of a bridge over the Dee, is 
only L. 8200. It is, however, still to be hoped that the public 



KIRKMICHAEL. 



Spirit of the heritors on this principal portion of the line, aided by 
Government and all others concerned, will surmount every obsta- 
cle, and speedily open up this great and important line of com- 
munication between the north and the soui.h of Scotland. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church was built in the year 1807. 
It contains sufficient room for 350 persons. It is situated about 
four miles from the northern extremity of the parish, and fourteen 
from the southern. Since the erection of Tomintoul into a pa- 
rish quoad sacra, its situation, as regards the congregation now 
attending it, is the most convenient that could be chosen. It is 
a plain building, in tolerable repair. It has no gallery, but is of 
sufficient size for the congi-egation allocated to it. The sittings 
are all free. The glebe is about nine acres. The stipend is 15 
chalders, at the fiars prices of the county of Banff, one-half in 
oatmeal, and the other half in barley, with L.8, 6s. 8d. for com- 
munion elements. The manse and offices were rebuilt on a new 
site on the glebe in 1825, and are in good repair. The manse 
IS an elegant and commodious dwelling, situated on the top of 
a romantic knoll, 200 or 300 feet above the level of the Avon, 
and commanding an extensive view of the picturesque valley 
of the Avon to the south, with the summits of the Grampian 
Hills in the distance. The good taste and liberality of the 
Rev. Mr Tulloch, the present incumbent, have done much in 
adding to the elegance of the manse, by his improvements in 
plantmg and inclosing around it, and in opening up approaches 
to it. 

There is a Government church and manse in the village of 
Tommtoul. It was built by Government in 1820, at an expense 
of L.750 for the church, and L.738 for the manse. It is situated 
five miles from the parish church. The district allocated to it 
was erected mto a parish quoad sacra by the General Assembly 
of 1833. The stipend is L. 120, including communion elements, 
and IS paid by Government. There is a glebe of half an acre, 
mth another half acre and two roods for a garden and site of the 
church, manse, and the church-yard. The church affords accom- 
modation for 336 sitters, and is built to admit of a gallery to con- 
tain about 200 more. Two-thirds of the area are let at from 6d 
to 9d. each sitting, annually; the proceeds to be applied in keep- 
ing the church and manse in repair; but the collection of the 
seat rents has been discontinued for some years. The other third 



308 BANFFSHIRE. 



part is allotted as free sittings. The manse is a neat cottage of 
one storey, consisting of seven apartments. 

Thereis a Roman Catholic chapel also in the village. It is a 
very substantial and capacious building, and includes the priest's 
dwelling-house, which consists of eleven apartments. It was 
built in 1838, and is sufficient to accommodate 464 persons on 
the ground area, besides space for galleries to accommodate 300 
more. The sittings at present fitted up are for 368 individuals. 
The expenses of the building were defrayed by private subscrip- 
tions over the three kingdoms. These are stated as exceeding 
L.1200; but the exact amount, or how much has been expended 
on the building, is not known. The bishop resides at Presshome, 
in the Enzie, near Fochabers. The priest is paid by the seat- 
rents of the chapel, which are let at from '2s. to 4s. each sitting. 
He has also the interest of L.400, bequeathed by a native of this 
■ parish to the priest at Tomintoul, besides the annual allowance 
of about L.9 from the fund for the maintenance of the Roman 
Catholic clergy. The number of families attending the parish 
church is 115, and the individuals, 614. The number attending 
the church at Tomintoul is 148 families, and 623 individuals. 
Total attending both the Established churches, 263 families, and 
1237 individuals. The number attending the Roman Catholic 
chapel is 99 families, and 485 individuals ; and as the chapel is 
sufficient to accommodate 764 persons, it appears that the muni- 
ficence of the supporters of Popery has, as in this instance, furnished 
accommodation for 279 individuals more than the whole congre- 
gation, voung and old, attending it consists of. Divine service at 
the Established Church is generally well attended. A great im- 
provement has taken place in this respect of late years, although 
there are a few nominal adherents of the Church of Scotland, 
who still retain the pernicious habit of going to church only oc- 
casionally, or not at all. 

The average number of communicants in the church at lo- 
mintoul is 150, and in the parish church, 143; total, 293. 
There are occasional collections and subscriptions raised for the 
General Assembly's schemes for religious purposes, for the Bible 
Society, and for the infirmary at Aberdeen. These collections 
and subscriptions amount annually to about T..10. 

Education.— There are three permanent schools in the parish, 
1. the parish school, near the parish church. It is attended by 



KIRKMJCHAEL. 



309 



about QO scholars annually. The teacher has the maximum sala- 
ry of L.34, 4s. 4|d., besides being eligible for a share of Mr 
Dick's bequest of from L.20 to L.30 a year. The school-fees 
average about L.3 a year. By the liberality of the heritors, the 
teacher has a dwelling-house of six apartments, and a commodi- 
ous school-room sufficient to contain about 100 scholars. The 
school- room was built in 1836, and both school -room and dwel- 
ling-house are in good repair. The teacher has a garden and 
croft of land sufficient to keep a cow. He has L.l a year of fee 
as session-clerk, besides the usual perquisites of office, which do 
not amount to more than L.2. 2. There is a school in the vil- 
lage of Tomintoul. The school is at present on no established 
footing. The teacher receives L.l 7, 3s. 3d. a year as a gratuity 
from His Grace the Duke of Richmond. The parochial school was 
situated in Tomintoul until the year 1835, and the teacher still 
enjoys the accommodations. The school is attended by upwards of 
1 00 scholars annually. The school-fees average about L. 1 4 a year. 
There are measures now in progress for erecting this school into 
a parochial school, under the Act I. Victoria, c. 87. The heri- 
tors have liberally undertaken to enlarge the accommodations, so 
as to entitle the teacher to the maximum salary; and it is expect- 
ed that he will be also eligible for a share of Mr Dick's bequest. An 
active and efficient teacher will thus be suitably encouraged. Be- 
sides the- ordinary branches of English reading, writing, arithme- 
tic, and English grammar, such scholars as may require it are 
taught Latin, mathematics, and geography at both these schools. 
The school-fees charged from those who can pay, are 2s. a quar- 
ter for reading, with 6d. additional for writing, and Is. additional 
for arithmetic and English grammar. Five shillings a quarter are 
charged for the higher branches; but a considerable proportion of 
the scholars are unable to pay any fees. The greater number of 
them attend only about a quarter in the year— many of them for 
a shorter period. 3. There is another school in the village, en- 
dowed by the Trustees of the late Mr Donaldson of Aberdeenshire. 
The salary is L.26. The school is attended by upwards of 100 
scholars annually. No fees are charged ; and only the elementary 
branches of education are taught. 

Besides these, there are commonly two or three schools on the 
teachers' own adventure in remote corners of the parish. These 
are taught only during the winter season. One of these schools, 



310 



BANFFSHIRE. 



in the Braes of Avon, is usually attended by from 40 to 50 child- 
ren. This portion of the parish is from seven to thirteen miles 
distant from the parish school, and from two to eight miles from 
the schools of Tomintoul. The population of the Braes of Avon 
is 280 souls. Of these 70 are under twelve years of age. An ad- 
ditional school is much required in this station. 

Library.— ThexQ is a small circulating library belonging to the 
quoad sacra parish of Tomintoul. It consists at present of 160 
volumes, chiefly religious and historical. 

Friendly Societies. — Various attempts were made some years 
ago to establish friendly societies in the parish and neighbourhood, 
but, being based on erroneous principles and under improper ma- 
nagement, none of them succeeded. 

There is no Savings bank in the parish, nor within twenty miles 
of it ; and it is not known that any of the population invest any of 
their earnings in any of these institutions at a distance. It is be- 
lieved that a Savings bank instituted in the parish, would be pro- 
ductive of great advantage, by inducing the labouring population 
to save their earnings, and make some provision for sickness and 
old age. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.—The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is about 80. They receive from 5s. to L. 2 
each annually. These allowances are very inadequate to the main- 
tenance of the poor, and much more depends on the private bene- 
volence of the community than on the poor's funds for maintaining 
them. Such of them as are able, assist in supporting themselves 
by any industry of which they are capable. Others obtain supply 
by going from house to house, whilst those who are disabled by 
sickness or old age from doing any thing, are supported by the 
alms-givings of the neighbours sent into their houses. 

The following natives of the parish may be here mentioned : 
Miss Isabella Maepherson of Tomachlaggan, who, by her talents , 
and industry, acquired a respectable rank and fortune in Edinburgh, 
and after making provision for all her relations, bequeathed L.350 
to the poor of the parish, which laid the foundation of the hand- 
some permanent funds now belonging to the poor. Mr Eneas Ca- 

• These facts refer to the state of the Braes of Avon previous to the year 1839. 
Since then, more than half the population has been removed by the new system of 
enlarging the farms, and many more will soon be removed from the same cause. 
This removal of the population removes also the necessity of any additional school 
m this district of the parish. 



KIRKMICHAEL. 511 

meron of Ballinlisb, a partner of the North- West Company in Ame- 
rica, left considerable property to his relations, and destined L. 100 
to the support of the poor. Messrs James and Gabriel Stewart 
of Cults amassed a handsome fortune by their business in Lon- 
don, and the former bequeathed L.IOOO to the poor; and Mr 
George Gordon of Fodderletter, of whom honourable mention is 
made in the last Statistical Report, as a chemist and botanist, 
left L. 50 to the poor, which, under the provisions of his deed of 
settlement, has now accumulated to L. 155. Mr M'Donald of 
Grantov/n also bequeathed L. 45 to the poor. 

The annual amount of contributions for the poor is about L.95. 
Of this sum there is about L.17 collected in the parish churches. 
Charitable donations make about L. 13 a year more. Of this 
sum, the Duke of Richmond has given L. 10 for the last few years. 
There is a fund of L.760, bequeathed by various benevolent indi- 
viduals belonging to the parish, which yields about L. 30 of year- 
ly interest ; and there is a sum of L.IOOO in the hands of Wil- 
liam Forbes Stewart, Esq. of London, for which he pays about 
L.35 yearly interest. Two-thirds of the interest of this last sum 
is destined to the support of the Roman Catholic poor in the pa- 
rish, under the management of the Roman Catholic Priest, the 
other third is under the management of the kirk-session, for be- 
hoof of the Protestant poor. 

The spirit of independence and a desire to refrain from seeking 
parochial relief prevails to a considerable extent among the poor, 
but, it is believed, that, in proportion as the means of extending 
parochial aid to them are increased, this spirit of independence 
decreases. 

Owing to severe harvest frosts, the crops of 1836, 1837, and 
1838, were almost complete failures, especially the crop of the 
year 1838; and it was found necessary, towards the beginning 
of 1839, to raise extraordinary supplies for the maintenance of the 
poor. On application to the committees in London and Glasgow 
for the management of a fund raised for the relief of the destitute 
in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, a grant of L.150 was 
obtained. This sum, aided by other sources, afforded the means 
of distributing 167 bolls of meal in the parish, which relieved the 
necessities of 198 families. 

Prisons. — Any criminal offenders in this part of the country, of 
whom the number is happily very small, are sent to the countj-jail

BANFFSlimE. 



at Banff", a distance of about fifty miles. There is a lock-up-house 
in the village of Tomintoul, under the charge of a district consta- 
ble. But this place of safe keeping is comparatively useless, from 
the want of any resident magistrate, or efficient means of securing 
those disturbers of the public peace, who not unfrequently infest 
the village, and annoy the peaceful and well-inclined portion of the 
community. There are five markets held annually in Tomintoul, 
viz. on the last Friday of May, new style ; on the last Friday of 
July, old style; on the third Wednesday of August, old style ; on 
Friday after the second Tuesday of September, old style ; and on 
the second Friday of November, old style. These markets are 
principally for the sale of cattle and sheep, and engaging servants. 

Inns. — There . are four inns or public-houses in Tomintoul, and 
two in the country part of the parish. It is much to the credit of 
Mr Skinner, the Duke of Richmond's factor for this parish, that 
he strenuously opposes the indiscriminate licensing of dram-houses. 

Puel. — The only description of fuel used in the parish is moss- 
peat. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

The more striking variations betwixt the present state of the 
parish and that which existed at the time of the last Statistical Ac- 
count, exhibit considerable improvement in the state of society. 
The means of religious instruction and attendance on these means 
are greatly increased, as appears from the Sabbath collections 
made for the poor. These have increased about eightfold, or 
from L.2, 2s. 6d. to about L.17. The total annual funds for the 
maintenance of the poor have increased fortyfold, or from L.2, 2s. 
6d. to L.95. The population has increased more than one-third, 
and the attendance of children at school is fourfold, or from about 
80 to 320. The minister's stipend is increased about four- 
fold, or from L.68, 6s. 8d. to an average of more than L.240, 
whilst he has less than half the charge. 

The arable acres are increased from 1550 to 2400, and the rent 
from about L. 1100 to L.2760. The permanent poor's funds have 
increased from L.5 to about L.1800. 

The parish is susceptible of considerable improvement, by 
means of planting the hills and moors, improving waste ground, 
enclosing the fields, and road-making. In this last particular, some- 
thing has been done within the last ten or twelve years, by open- 
ing up a line of internal communication along the banks of the 



CULLEN. 313 

 

Avon, and another to the east by Glenlivat. Arrangements are 
also made by the Duke of Richmond for subdividing and en- 
closing the farms ; and as His Grace evinces a disposition to pro- 
mote the interests of his tenantry, and improve his extensive do- 
mains, it is expected that he will give orders to plant a considera- 
ble portion of the waste ground in the parish.

PRESBYTERY OF FORDYCE, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. GEORGE HENDERSON, A. M., MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, — The etymology of the name of this parish, as well as 
the historical origin of the royal burgh of CuUen, appear to be 
lost in the mist of antiquity. The legendary accounts prevalent 
in the parish, and even to be met with in the writings of some of 
the minor historians, are unworthy of notice. It was originally 
called Invercidan, being bounded on the north and west by the 
water of Cullen, which falls into the sea at the western extremity 
of the parish ; but it has long borne the name of Culan, Culane, 
or Cullen only. 

Extent and Baundaries. — The ecclesiastical parish consists of 
two parts, viz. Cullen proper, or Cullen quoad civilia, and a por- 
tion of the neighbouring parish of Rathven, annexed to it qurad 
sacra. The former, which bears the form of a wedffe, extends 
from north to south, in length about U miles, and from east to 
west, in average breadth, nearly ] mile, containing 684 imperial 
acres. The annexation from Rathven is about 3 miles in leno-th 
from east to west, and nearly 2 miles in breadth, from north to 
south. Cullen Proper is bounded on the north, by the Moray 
Frith ; on the south, by Rathven and Deskford ; on the east, by 
Fordyce ; and on the west, by Rathven. 

Topographical Appearances. — The topographical appearance of 
this parish presents the richest and most varied landscape of hill 

• The following statistics apply only to the parish of Cullen proper, unless where 
special reference is made to the annexation.

and dale, wood, water, and highly cultivated fields, which is to be 
seen in the district. Along its shores, the rocks rise in precipitous 
grandeur, or are thrown up in rugged deformity, to a very consi- 
derable height above the level of the sea. In some places, they 
are perpendicular, or nearly so; in others, they are disrupted, and 
jut out into the water in fragments. Thence, the land rises by a 
gentle acclivity, on which the ancient barony of Ogilvie is situated, 
and which the Noble proprietors have been pleased to distinguish, 
by assuming its more modern name of Seafield, as their most ho- 
noured title. Advancing to the south, the land rises more abruptly, 
then gradually descends to the extreme boundary of Cullen pro- 
per. Here and there, in a gentle undulating maimer, it forms it- 
self on the top into knolls or risings. From an elevated spot on 
Seafield farm, the view is most extensive and delightful. To 
the north-west, are seen the most prominent buildings of the new 
town of Cullen, pleasantly situated on the western acclivity of the 
hill adjacent to the sea, the sandy bay of Cullen, and the bold 
and precipitous headland of Scarnose, forming the western extre- 
mity of the bay, and the most northern point of land on this side 
the Moray Frith. In the back ground, the distant shores and 
dark blue mountains of Sutherland and Caithness, on the oppo- 
site side of the frith, are distinctly seen ; while the wide interven- 
ing expanse of sea, bespangled with -trading vessels and fishing- 
boats, adds greatly to the landscape. To the southward, are seen 
the richly cultivated fields of Cullen proper, and part of the arable 
lands of the annexation, also in the highest state of luxuriance ; 
the latter bounded by a dense and extensive forest, which imparts 
to the scene an aspect of the most picturesque beauty. The view 
in another direction is not less interesting. To the west and 
south-west, stands the Bin Hill, which is partly within the quoad 
sacra district of the parish, and forms the most conspicuous object 
in the district. It has two tops, the one considerably higher than 
the other, and presents to the eye of the spectator looking from 
the north, very much of the form of the Hon couchant. Its ele- 
vation above the sea is 1076 feet, and it serves as an excellent 
land-mark to navigators. About seventy years ago, it was planted 
with trees, which have thriven well, excepting towards the sum- 
mit, where the severity of the exposure bids defiance to vegetation 
of any kind, save heath. In the same direction, is seen the stately 
mansion of Cullen House, with its superb pleasure grounds. In 



CULLEN.

ilie back ground, the woods and plantations of the ancient barony 
of Rannes, in the parish of Rathven, meet the eye ; and in the 
distance, the bleak mountains of Inverness-shire shut up the view. 

Meteorology. — From its proximity to the sea, and the quality 
of its soil, the climate of this parish is cool and bracing. In win- 
ter, when the inland districts are covered with frosts and snow, it 
stands comparatively free from either, particularly the latter. 
This is to be attributed to the strong influence of the sea breezes, 
and the thorough draining which a great portion of the land has 
recently undergone. The season of spring is proverbially early, 
especially in the grounds around Cullen House, where the culti- 
vation is so high, and the shelter afforded by wood so complete, 
that the growth of trees and plants may almost be said to be un- 
interrupted during the whole year. In this parish, no disease is 
endemick ; its inhabitants are, on the whole, more healthy than 
those in the inland districts ; and it is frequently resorted to by in- 
valids, on account of the salubrity of its climate. There are pro- 
bably few places in Scotland more conducive to health and lon- 
gevity. The people are not liable to any prevailing distemper. 
Epidemicks are of very rare occurrence ; and when they do visit 
the district, are generally of a mild character. Many of the in- 
habitants live to the age of eighty-five and ninety ; and lately, 
two persons, natives of the parish, died, each at the patriarchal 
age of one hundred years and upwards. The Bin Hill, in the im- 
mediate vicinity, and the most prominent object in the district 
acts as a never-erring barometer, its summit being invariably co- 
vered with mist, previous to rain or moist weather. The prevail- 
ing winds are, the north, north-east, and north-west. These are 
cold, but comparatively harmless to vegetation, except that from 
the north-west blowing violently, in the end of July and beginning 
of August, before the white crops have attained maturky ; its 
blighting effects sometimes occasioning considerable loss to the 
farmer. There is no thermometrical or barometrical table kept 
in the parish. The average annual fall of rain is 22 inches. 

Hydrography.— T\\e parish is bounded on the west and south 
by the water of Cullen, which rises in the heights of Desk ford, 
and, proceeding in a northerly direction for a distance of about 
six miles, enters Cullen parish at its south-eastern boundary. 
By draining in its course the hollows of Deskford, it receives a 
considerable accession to its strength, and by the time it has

reached Tochieneal farm, lias become a stream of considerable 
magnitude. Thence taking a north-westerly direction, it supplies 
the machinery of several works with water-power, and receives 
some additions in its progress, until it enters the policies of Cul- 
len House, of which it forms a highly ornamental feature. Sweep- 
ing the base of the perpendicular rock on which the mansion 
stands, it flows directly north for nearly a mile, and then enters 
the bay of Cullen. In the whole of its course, it has a very con- 
siderable velocity, and, by the time it has reached Cullen House, 
has acquired a breadth, within its banks, of twenty feet. The 
water is clear and pure, and has long been used for the purposes 
of bleaching, &amp;c. There are no remarkable springs in the pa- 
rish, with the exception of one at the farm of Tochieneal, which 
is strongly impregnated with sulphurated hydrogen. Its tempera- 
ture, February 22, 1842, was 40°. The other fountains, rising 
within the parish, are all used for culinary and domestic pur- 
poses. 

Geology and Mineralogy.— parish exhibits no remarkable 
geological features. In length and breadth, it reposes on a single 
bed of stratified quartz, standing at an angle of from 50° to 80°, 
and which, again, reposes on a thick bed of compact graywacke, 
in a conformable position. The direction of the strata is from 
north-east to south-west, the dip being north-west and south-east. 
Adjacent to the harbour, the greywacke has assumed the slaty 
structure, and alternates with the quartz. In the flat sandy bay 
of Cullen, situated in the quoad sacra district of the parish, 
there are three remarkable masses of insulated rock, called the 
« Three Kings." The first, or most easterly, is formed of quartz, 
in small angular fragments, which, in some places, are loose, and 
in others, appear cemented together by a ferruginous paste. The 
other two are composed of pudding-stone, or old red sandstone, 
which appears to have been protruded through the surrounding 
strata. These masses of rock are of considerable height, and of 
different shapes, and being, moreover, formed of different mate- 
rials, have a very striking appearance on the flat surface of the 
plain on which they stand. The old red sandstone appears no- 

• The reason assigned for the above name, is the legendary tale, that a Danish, 
a Scotch, and Norwegian King, met at this spot, in order to settle their feuds by 
personal combat. Two were to fight, and the third was to be arbiter of the contest. 
It is said that the Danish King fell, and that the Scotch King came off victorious. 
History, however, is silent on the subject. 



CULLRN, 317 

where else within the parish. About half a mile to the westward, 
two patches of the new red or stratified sandstone, appear reposing, 
in a horizontal position, on the disrupted edges of the greywacke. 
The upper or diluvial beds are shingle, clay, &amp;c. Near Tochie- 
neal Cottage, at the southern boundary of the parish, there is an 
extensive bed of fine lias clay, containing ammonites, belemnites, 
and other petrifactions common to the lias formation, and which 
can be traced over a considerable portion of the southern part of 
the parish. Tliis clay having been by the plough mixed with the 
vegetable mould, has rendered the soil uncommonly productive. 
No erratic or rolled blocks have been seen, either in the interior 
of the parish, or along its shores, different from the rocks in situ; 
nor, with the above-mentioned exception, have any petrifactions 
or veins of metal been ever found. 

Botany. — The parish of Cullen, throughout its ecclesiastical 
extent, possesses a highly interesting and most extensive P'lora. 
With variety of soil and exposure, it comprehends hill and dale, 
wood, water, and sea coast. It is matter of regret, however, that 
this interesting field for botanical research has never, to the know- 
ledge of the writer, been examined with that industry and atten- 
tion which it so well deserves, and seldom indeed at all, save by 
the passing stranger. Yet, notwithstanding this desideratum, 
the writer is enabled to notice several plants comparatively rare 
in the district. Subjoined also are the names of some of the more 
common, which are particularly remarkable for luxuriance of 
growth, and beauty of flower. Along the sloping sides of the 
Bin hill, many alpine plants are to be found, among which may be 
noticed: 

Anemone apennina Vaccinium vitis-idaea Rubus chamaemorus. 

Hyacinthus non-scriptus myrtiilus 
Vaccinium oxycoccos Oxalis acetosella 

Towards the base of the Bin hill, and in the lower grounds, are' 
found : 

Adoxa moschatellina Circaea alpina Jnniperus communis 

Alnus glutinosa Digitalis purpurea Laniium album 

Borago officinalis Geranium pratense Trientalis Europfca. 

Campanula latifolia Iris pseudacorus 

Along the coast and sea shore are found : 

Carex arenaria I.aminaria digitata Porphyra laciniata 

Fucus esculentus Laurentia pinnatifida Rhodonienia palmata 

Helianthemura vulgare Plantago coronopus Salsola kali.

II. — Civil History. 
Historical Events.— It is well known, that the piratical Danes, 
who long had the mastery of the seas, continued for several cen- 
turies to desolate the coasts of Scotland, and to prove a per- 
petual scourge to the country. Although their incursions and 
depredations are involved in much obscurity, yet the scattered 
notices and traditionary accounts handed down to the present 
time, leave no doubt of their predatory inroads along the shores 
of the Moray Frith. In Buchanan's History of Scotland it is 
recorded, that the Danes, after having made an unsuccessful at- 
tempt to land on the coast of Buchan, proceeded farther west- 
ward, and put ashore at the mouth of the burn or water of CuUen. 
Thither Indulfus, who then held the sceptre of Scotland, march- 
ed at the head of his army to oppose their progress, and a bloody 
battle ensued between the Scotch and their Danish invaders. The 
scene of the conflict is denominated by the above historian " a 
woody valley ;" and many tumuli have been dug up throughout 
this locality, where now are situated the splendid mansion of the 
Noble family of Seafield, and the beautiful grounds surrounding 
it. The most deadly arena of the conflict, however, appears to 
have been a spot a little farther west, on the moor of Ranna- 
chie, or Baads of CuUen ; and the action which took place 
here, is known and currently spoken of as " the Battle of the 
Baads." The place is thickly studded with tumuli in every direc- 
tion, and these on being opened are always fbund to contain de- 
cayed bones, fragments of arms, &amp;c. Upon this occasion, the 
Danes were routed, and put to flight; but the brave monarch In- 
dulfus was killed by an arrow, while at the head of his troops 
pursuing the enemy, anno 960. One division of the Danes, it is 
said, fled to Mortlach, where there was an encampment of their 
countrymen; another took the road to Forfar, where they were 
again defeated ; and a few of their scattered number endeavoured 
to regain their ships. This was a decisive victory gained by the 
Scotch, and is supposed to be among the last battles fought with 

• An accomplished and ingenious friend has suggested the possibility of the name 
of the parish having been derived from this very circumstance, the name of the holly 
in the Gaelic language being Cuileonn, or, as pronounced by the common people in 
districts where Gaelic is spoken, Coulion—CuWea

the Danes, previous to their total expulsion from the kingdom, 
about the year 1014. 

There is a very distinct tradition in the parish, the truth of 
which there seems no cause to dispute, but, on the contrary, strong 
reason to credit, that Queen Elizabeth, consort of Robert I., died 
at an occasional residence near to where Cullen House now stands, 
and that " her bowels are erded, i. e. buried, in our Lady Kirk of 
Cullen." The circumstance of Kinff Robert havino- endowed 
a chaplain to pray for the soul of his consort, Queen Elizabeth, in 
the church of Cullen, affords strong presumptive evidence in favour 
of the truth of the tradition. The question naturally suggests itself, 
What could have brought Queen Elizabeth to Cullen  To this the 
most probable answer is, that, as she had a daughter married to the 
then Earl of Sutherland, she had come on a visit to her daughter ; 
and as the family of Sutherland had at that period considerable pro- 
perty in the Boyn and Enzie, that the Queen, at the time of her 
death, might have been the guest of some of their friends or rela- 
tives in that quarter. 

The town of Cullen had its share of the troubles to which 
Scotland was subjected in the days of the Covenanters, having 
been repeatedly plundered by the Marquis of Montrose, and after- 
wards burnt. On the 4th March 1645, Montrose, with the body 
of his army, had stationed himself at the Bog of Gight, " and 
sent beforehand over Spey the Farquharsons of Brae of Mar, to 
plunder the town of Cullen, pertaining to the Earl of Findlater, 
which they did pitifully." A short time thereafter, « Montrose 
marches frae the Bog to the place of Cullen of Boyn, the Earl of 
Findlater having fled south himself before to Edinburgh, leaving in 
thir dangerous days pitiful to behold his lady behind him. This 
stately house, well decored with stately insight and plenishing, and 
furnished with silver plate and all other necessaries, was pitifully 
plundered, and nothing tursable left; and then was beginning to 
raise fire, but the lady pitifully besought Montrose now in her hus- 
band's absence to forbear firing of her ground, but for the space of 
fifteen days, within the whilk time, if her husband came not to give 
satisfaction, that then his Lordship should do as pleased him best ; 
and for this peace of fifteen days time, she promised twenty thousand 
merks, whereof she paid in hand five thousand merks. Montrose 
granted her desire upon the conditions foresaid, and raised no fire 
on the Earl of Findlater's grounds albeit a great Covenanter at this

time." From what has been stated, it might be supposed, that our 
good town of CuUen would have been spared from farther violence. 
Such, however, was not the case ; for, about the middle of May in 
the same year, Montrose sent a party of his troops to Cullen, and 
burnt the whole town to the ground, first plundering and carrying 
off every thing valuable, then consuming the remainder in one 
common blaze; and, doubtless, many of the aged, infirm, and 
helpless, fell victims to the devouring element. 

Familt/ of Findlater and Seqfield.—T\ns noble and ancient fa- 
mily is descended from Gilchrist, a man of high rank, and a fa- 
vourite of King Malcolm Canmore, whom that monarch created 
Earl of Angus. He lived after the year 1 120, and was among 
the first in Scotland upon whom the title of Earl was conferred. 
His son, Gilibrede, the second Earl of Angus, was a great war- 
rior, and hved in the reigns of David I., Malcolm IV., and Wil- 
liam the Lion. He had six sons, of whom Gilbert, the third, was 
ancestor of the present family of Seafield. He was a man of 
great abilities ; and, agreeably to the custom of these early times, 
assumed his name from his lands of Ogilvie, viz. Gilbert de 
Ogilvie, f 

Sir Walter Ogilvie of Auchleven, the eighth in direct hneal de- 
scent from the aforesaid Gilbert de Ogilvie, and second son of Sir 
Walter Ogilvie of Lintrethan, Lord High Treasurer of Scotland in 
1425, married, in 1437, Margaret, daughter and heiress of Sir 
John Sinclair of Deskford and Findlater, who was killed at the 
battle of Harlaw, in 1411. The baronies thus acquired by Sir 
Walter Ogilvie of Auchleven became the chief titles of his family ; 
and, in accordance with ancient usage in such cases, he quartered 
the arms of Sinclair of Deskford with his paternal coat of Ogilvie. 
In 1440, he obtained two charters, under the Great Seal, of the 
lands and baronies of Deskford, Findlater, &amp;c. Sir Walter Ogilvie 
of Deskford and Findlater, the sixth in direct lineal descent from 

♦ Spalding's History. _   , . 

+ The following is the reason, assigned by some historians, for Gilbert changing 
his name to that of Ogilvie:— The Gilchrists having unfortunately incurred the re- 
sentment of their sovereign, were, in consequence, long subjected to the loss of the 
roval favour. The king one day, in taking the diversion of hunting, imprudent- 
ly separated himself from his retinue, and was attacked by a band of robbers. At 
that critical moment the Gilchrists made their appearance, and, having dispersed 
the robbers, had the good fortune to rescue the king; upon which, the differences 
formerly existing- between them were immediately made up ; the king intimating to 
them that he wo°uld grant them, without reserve, whatever favour they chose to ask ; 
but adding, at the same time, a condition, that, for the future, they should hold and 
bear the name of Ogilvie; as the monarch in his wrath had previously sworn, that no 
man within his kingdom, should be suffered to live, and bear the name of Gilchrist.

the aforesaid Sir Walter Ogilvie of Auchleven, was a man of great 
abilities, and a favourite of James VI., by whom he was raised to 
the dignity of the Peerage, and created Lord Ogilvie of Desk- 
ford, October 4, 1616. His son and heir, James, second Lord 
Ogilvie, was created Earl of Findlater by Charles I., 20th Febru- 
ary 1638, by patent to the heirs-male of his body; but, having no 
male issue, he obtained a new patent, 1 8th October 1641, in fa- 
vour of Sir Patrick Ogilvie of Inchmartin, who had married his 
eldest daughter, Elizabeth. This St Patrick became second Earl 
of Findlater, and died 1658, leaving an only son, James, third 
Earl, who died 17 J 1, and was succeeded by his son James, fourth 
Earl, K. T., the celebrated lawyer and statesman, who, during his 
father's lifetime, was created, 28th June 1698, Viscount Seafield, 
and, 24th June 1701, Earl of Seafield, Viscount of Reidhaven, 
with remainder, on failure of male issue of Iiis body, to his other 
heirs of entail. He died 1730, and was succeeded by his son and 
heir, James, fifth Earl of Findlater, and second Earl of Seafield, who 
died 1764, leaving the following issue, viz. a son, James, by whom 
he was succeeded, and two daughters, Margaret and Ann, the 
former married to Sir Ludovick Grant of Grant, Bart., the latter 
to John second Earl of Hopetoun. James the sixth Earl of Find- 
later, and third Earl of Seafield, died 1770, and was succeeded by 
his son and heir, James, seventh Earl of Findlater, and fourth 
Earl of Seafield; on whose death, without issue, 1811, the Earl- 
dom of Findlater, which was limited to the heirs-male of the body 
of the first Earl, became extinct; but the Earldom of Seafield, 
and the other titles created by the patent of 1701, together with 
the whole of the family estates, devolved on his cousin. Sir Lewis 
Alexander Grant of Grant, Bart., son of Sir James Grant of 
Grant, Bart., and grandson of Sir Ludovick Grant of Grant, 
Bart., and his wife, Margaret, elder daughter of James, fifth Earl 
of Findlater, and second Earl of Seafield. Sir Lewis Alexander 
Grant, fifth Earl of Seafield, assumed the name of Ogilvie, and 
died 1840, without issue. He was succeeded by his brother, the 
Honourable Francis William Grant, the sixth and present Earl of 
Seafield, who has male issue. 

The house of Seafield is lineally connected with the following 
noble families : Aberdeen, Airly, Athol, Banff, Buchan, Caith-

Eminent Characters.— Under this head, the name of James 
fourth Earl of Findlater and first Earl of Seafield, claims a special 
notice. This distinguished statesman and eminent lawyer was 
born in 1664. In 1689, he was chosen member of the Conven- 
tion of Estates for the burgh of Cullen, in which capacity he ob- 
tained much celebrity, by a remarkable speech in favour of King 
James VII., and by being one of the five members who dissented 
from the act for forfeiting that monarch. Contrary to what might 
have been expected, his firmness and fidehty to his former sove- 
reign had not the effect of injuring him in the eyes of James's suc- 
cessor ; for, after the government was settled in favour of William, 
he became a special favourite of his Majesty. In 1693, being an 
eminent lawyer, he was appointed Solicitor for the Crown, She- 
riff of Banff", and, at the same time, received the honour of knight- 
hood. In 1695, he was appointed Secretary of State. In 1698 
he was appointed President of the Parliament, and was, at the 
same time, created Viscount Seafield. In 1700, he held the of- 
fice of his Majesty's Commissioner to the General Assembly of 
the Church of Scotland, and was thrice afterwards preferred to 
the same dignity, viz. in 1703, 1724, and 1727. In 1701, he was 
created Earl of Seafield. He continued Secretary of State dur- 
ing all King William's reign ; and, upon the accession of Queen 
Anne, he filled the same department, until November 1702, when 
he was appointed Chancellor. In 1703, he was created a Knight 
of the Thistle. In 1704, he was again appointed Secretary of 
State, and likewise presided in Parliament. In the same year, he 
was appointed Chancellor for the second time, in which office he 
continued until the Union was completed, having been first Com- 
missioner for Scotland at the treaty of Union, and presided in the 
Scottish Parliament which ratified it. After the Union, he was 

 It is a somewhat remarkable circumstance, that, although his Lordship was main- 
ly instrumental in promoting the Union, it was, nevertheless, in imminent danger of 
being dissolved, several years after the act was passed, through the instrumentality of 
the same individual. When the Malt- Tax was extended to Scotland, his Lordship 
was so irritated at the measure, considering it an infringement of the articles of 
Union, that, in the House of Lords, 1st June 1713, he laid open the grievances of 
the Scottish nation, which he reduced to four heads, viz. I. The being deprived of 
a Privy- Council ; 2. The extension of the treason laws of England to Scotland ; 3. 
The Peers of Scotland being incapacitated from being created Peers of Great Bri- 
tain ; and, 4. The Scots being subjected to the Malt Tax, which would be the more 
insupportable to them now, in that they never bore it during the war, and had reason 
to expect the benefits of a peace,— concluding, that, since the Union had not been 
productive of those good effects which were expected, he moved, that leave be given

appointed Chief Baron of the Court of Exchequer in Scotland, 
and a member of the Privy- Council. He was chosen one of the 
sixteen Peers in the first British Parliament, and was repeatedly 
re-elected to the same honour. In 1713, he was again appointed 
Chancellor, and Keeper of the Great Seal in Scotland ; and dur- 
ing all the periods' in which he held the office of Chancellor, he 
presided in the Court of Session. As a Senator of the College 
of Justice, he is recorded to have displayed consummate eloquence, 
great legal abilities, and a peculiar talent of dispatch in business. 
His Lordship died in 1730, in the sixty-sixth year of his age. 

There have been few men, to whom his country has been so 
deeply indebted, considered in the character of a peaceful patriot, 
as to James sixth Earl of Findlater and third Earl of Seafield, 
born 1714. To that distinguished individual, appertained the ex- 
clusive merit, of introducing into the north of Scotland, those im- 
provements in agriculture, manufactures, and all kinds of useful

industry, which, in the space of a few years, raised his country 
from a state of semi-barbarism to a degree of civilization, equal to 
that of the most improved districts of the south. His Lordship 
completed an excellent education by foreign travel, which emi- 
nently qualified him for the distinguished part he was destined to 
act in the field of philanthropy. In 1754, he was appointed one 
of the Commissioners of Customs in Scotland; and in I7b5, was 
constituted one of the Lords of Police. He was one of the trus- 
tees for the improvement of fisheries and manufactures, and tor 
the management of the forfeited estates in Scotland ; and attended 
to the business of these boards with the most exemplary zeal and 
assiduity. Enthusiastic in his desire to benefit his native land, 
the prime object of his ambition, he conversed much with and 
greatly honoured men of letters and persons of ingenuity in every 
profession, always endeavouring to convert whatever knowledge he 
by such means acquired, to the improvement of his country. In 
these truly patriotic pursuits, he succeeded to an extent altogether 
unparalleled in the annals of industrial improvements ; and his 
name is still a household word over the north of Scotland, being 
regarded as that of a man who, in his day and generation, proved 

crop, as well as other green crops, by degrees, into general practice. Altbongh his 
Lordship well knew the baneful effects of exacting services from his tenants, he had 
Them boud in proportion to the size of their respective farms to send their sons or 
ervltra crtainuLberofdays. to assist in the hand-hoeing of his own turnips, for 
™xp ess purpose of teaching them to do this work, in a proper manner, on the 
o ber fS ms of his estate. So averse were the men, at that time, to this kHid of work 
Sat they expected to get free from it, by giving the overseer cause to complain that 
they weL doing it in a slovenly manner. His Lordship, however, was not to be de- 
ceived or disappointed in his favourite scheme, and immediately directed that, until 
thev could do a sufficient day's work in a proper manner, they must make it up, by 
servine more days than was stipulated for. By this means, it will easily be imagined, 
hTs Lordship gained his much- wished for object, and the business of turnip-hoeing 
was, in a few years, very well performed all over his estate. 

a it is not to be expected, that any general improvement in the modes of agriculture 
can be introduced all at once, or that the inhabitants of a country will, on a sudden, 
rive UP their old habits and ways of thinking. They must be mduced to do so either 
from the advantage which they are satisfied they will derive, in consequence of mak- 
inTnew arrangements with the proprietors, or from a conviction in their own minds, 
Ihft the experiments of their more adventurous neighbours have proved successful 
and advantageous ; and, therefore, in this new state of things, it was no wonder, not- 
tithfandin Lord Findlater's unwearied exertions, that many years elapsed, before 
fo ow sowing grass and turnip, and other green crops, came into general practice, 
onin that Quarter of his estate, which may be said to have had the advantage of his 
'''' ol L.nprintendence. But the tenants being at last satibfied, that the improve- 
Srin troE d 1 -1 if adopted by them, would promote 

S interest, they set about making experiments, which having, m every instance, 
Ixceeded expectation, the spirit of improvement began to gain ground, ana, as a na- 
SrSstquence, his Lordship's example was followed by the other proprietors and 
tural constque , . „• fmers in other parts of the country. In a short pe-

himself one of the most substantial benefactors of his species. His 
Lordship died at Cullen House, 3d November 1770, in the fifty- 
sixth year of his age. 

Sir James Clark, Bart., First Physician to Her Majesty, is a 
native of this parish ; and, at the parochial school of the neigh- 
bouring parish of Fordyce, received the elements of that educa- 
tion, which, by successful cultivation, has deservedly raised him to 
the highest professional eminence. Although he has been long 
absent from the place of his nativity, he has uniformly evinced a 
lively interest in its welfare, by frequent and substantial acts of be- 
neficence ; and to his friendship, not a few of his countrymen have 
been mainly indebted, for their prosperity in life. 

Land-uwner — The Earl of Seafield is proprietor of the whole 
parish, with the exception of nine and a half Scotch acres, mortified 
for charitable and educational purposes. There are few parishes in 
Scotland so fortunate in their proprietary as Cullen. His Lord- 
ship, who resides chiefly at Cullen House, deservedly sustains the 
character of a patriot and philanthropist, in the true and proper 
meaning of the terms ; evincing the most lively interest in the im- 
provements not only of the lands in his own natural possession, but 
in every part of his princely estates, and stimulating the exertions 
of his tenantry, by the most liberal yet judicious encouragement. 

Parochial Registers.— These have been well preserved, and are 
in good order. With the exception of a hiatus of eight years, viz. 
from 1762 to 1770, the records of the kirk-session contain an un- 
interrupted history of its proceedings, from 1640 down to the pre- 
sent time. The register of baptisms and marriages commences in 
1682, and is quite complete from that date. 

Antiquities.— On the eastern bank of the water of Cullen, and 
overhanging the Sea-town, an eminence, called the Castle' hill, 
rises in a conical form, to the height of upwards of 200 feet above 
the level of the sea. In remote ages, it appears to have been 
crowned with a vitrified castle or fort, which had been guarded by 
a triple wall and ditch. These have long since been demolished, 
but traces of them are yet distinctly visible. This castle, like 
many others along the coast, has been the subject of much specu- 
lation among antiquaries and historians. They appear to have 
been, in general, situated upon promontories, mountains, and other 
lofty eminences. Their massive walls were cemented with vitrid 
matter, instead of lime, which is alleged to have been produced 
by a powerful heat and flux, perhaps kelp, and which, falling

into the crevices of the building, so effectually united the whole, 
that the remains of the cement, which are occasionally to be 
found, appear to be almost as strong as the solid rock. These for- 
tresses appear to have been occupied by the chiefs and proprie- 
tors of the adjacent soil, as places of safety, in those barba- 
rous and unsettled times, which rendered such erections neces- 
sary. It is traditionally reported, that this castle was original- 
ly the residence of the proprietors of Cullen and the adjacent 
grounds ; and if such were the case, it is not improbable that 
the Queen of Robert de Bruce may have died in it. A far- 
ther tradition respecting it there being no record whatever is, 
that it was a military fortress, occupied by the Scottish forces 
about the time of the invasion of the Danes, and when an enemy 
appeared, the inhabitants of Cullen carried their most valuable ar- 
ticles into the castle for safety. Before the use of cannon, the 
Castle-hill was extremely well situated for warlike operations, 
being inaccessible from the north by an almost perpendicular rock 
of 170 feet in height. 

Ecclesiastical History and Antiquities. — The present parish 
church was originally dedicated to St Mary, and is of considera- 
ble antiquity. The following is an excerpt from an unpublished 
manuscript, entitled, " A view of the Diocese of Aberdeen :" 
" Church of Saint Mary of Cullen. This church was founded by 
Robert I., and it is said that the bowels of his Queen Elizabeth 
are buried here. This church had a provost, six prebends, and 
two singing boys, founded by Alexander Ogilvie of that Ilk, pre- 
decessor of the Earl of Findlater, Mr Alexander Dick, Archbishop 
of Glasgow, John Duff of Muldavit, ancestor of Lord Fife, with 
all the magistrates of Cullen, an. 1,543. This foundation was con- 
firmed by William Bishop of Aberdeen, the same year, and by 
John Archbishop of 'i KuAvevslegat alatere 1552. Each of the 
clergy was to have twenty merks yearly in lands and money, toge- 
ther with an apartment and garden. For this end, they had se- 
veral crofts allotted to themin the town, together with the vicarage 
of Rathven, with all the privileges belonging to the burghers of 
Cullen." Agreeably to the above statement regarding the foun- 
dation of the church of Cullen, it appears from the charter of the 
burgh, that " Robert of Bruce, King of the Scotch, granted and 
gave in gift for ever, L. 5 of the money of the kingdom, /". e.

Monuments. — The church of Cullen, having been, for many 
ages, the burying-place of the Findlater and Seafield family, con- 
tains several ancient monuments of a very elegant description. 
The chief of these is a monument 1554 to the memory of Aiex- 
ander Ogilvie, Baron of Findlater, and his wife, Elizabeth Gordon, 
which, in point of Gothic excellence and grandeur of design, is 
perhaps inferior to none in Europe of a corresponding age. A 
superb monument to the memory of John Duff of Muldavat, re- 
presenting the figure of an armed warrior recumbent, was remov- 
ed in 1790, along with the supposed ashes of the deceased, from 
the family burying -place in the church of Cullen, and deposited 
in the mausoleum in Duff House Park. The aforesaid John Duff, 
who had his residence near to where the present mansion of Cul- 
len House stands, on the opposite side of the water of Cullen, was 
a reputed ancestor of the Fife family, and died in 1404. In the 
southern aisle of the church, are some curious foundation inscrip- 
tions, well worthy the attention of the antiquary. 

Cullen House. — Cullen House, the principal residence of the 
Earl of Seafield, is situated in the parish of Cullen proper, at the 
distance of six furlongs from the town. It is an ancient and state- 
ly structure, consisting of several irregular masses of unadorned 
building, erected at different periods, the oldest of which is, in all 
probability, coeval with the erection of the present parish church, 
in the fourteenth century, to which it appears to have been ori- 
ginally attached as a monastic edifice. It contains many magnifi-

figures of the entombed, in devotional attitudes, are well rounded and correctly 
drawn. The sculptures of the central and interior part, according to the ideas of 
early ages, have most learned and sublime allusion. Two angels guarding an altar- 
piece, on which the virtues of the deceased are inscribed, seem to call the dead, re- 
presented by a skeleton laid under the altar, to appear before the tribunal of the 
Most High, expressed by a hieroglyphic above. ' The Ancient of Days sat on

imagery by which the prophet Daniel pointed out the things that must be hereafter 
The well-known symbol here on the tomb of this one, upholding the globe iii 
his arm, implies the Intellectual Power and Wisdom which is the origin and support 
of Creation. The attitude of Benediction and the Triple Crown, though seemingly 
of more modern allusion, yet, in the Egyptian wisdom, refer to the Three Great At- 
tributes of Deity, and the Supreme pronouncing a blessing on his works. The pil- 
lars of Heaven, expressed by columns supporting an arch, rest on the cloud, and a 
circumambient vine. From that arch, diverging rays are spread, in which a Dove is 
descending, and they beam on ihe Cross that rises over the Globe, the most ancient 
and venerable symbols of the Universal Benignity of the Uncreated Light of th. 
World, manitesting the Divine Favour to Wan." "

cent, apartments, furnished in the first style of elegance. It is 
picturesquely elevated on a perpendicular rock, along the southern 
base of which, the water of CuUen, which animates the heautiful 
landscape, passes here within a hollow rocky channel, sixty-four 
feet deep beneath the mansion walls. Over this current, a hand- 
some single-arched stone bridge, of eighty-four feet span, connects 
the woods, parks, gardens, and pleasure-grounds with the man- 
sion. The plantations, within the umbrageous recesses of which 
the mansion is embowered, consist of a great variety of valuable 
wood, beneath the shady foliage of which, an excellent carriage- 
road, besides many delightful serpentine footpaths, winds by easy 
acclivities to the summit of the Bin hill, whence there is an ex- 
tensive view of the surrounding country and opposite coast. The 
pleasure-grounds are upwards of ten square miles in extent, and 
present to the eye a range of scenery, which, for richness, variety, 
and picturesque beauty, is not surpassed by any policy in Scot- 
land. Here nature has done much, and the embellishments of 
art, have been liberally bestowed from time to time, by the No- 
ble proprietors, especially by the present Earl, whose accurate and 
refined taste has been most successfully exercised, in adding to the 
attractions of this magnificent residence. In Cullen House, there 
is an elegant and extensive library, consisting of many thousand 
volumes in the several departments of literature and science ; and 
the walls of the principal apartments are adorned with a great va- 
riety of valuable paintings, many of them by the first masters. 
The gardens, vineries, &amp;c. are upon a scale of grandeur, corre- 
sponding to the dignity and opulence of the Noble proprietor, and 
for beauty of arrangement and luxuriance in the growth of rare and 
costly plants and fruits, are unrivalled in the north of Scotland. 

Modern Buildings. — The only modern building deserving of no- 
tice is the Cullen Hotel, attached to which, and under the same 
roof, but with a separate entrance, are three public rooms, viz. an 
elegant ball-room, 43 feet in length, and 23 in breadth ; a com- 
modious court-room, in which are held the sheriff and justice of 
peace courts ; and the council-room of the burgh, a handsome apart- 
ment of a circular form, 23 feet in diameter and 16 feet in 
height. The entire building was erected in 1822, at the expense 
of the Right Honourable the Earl of Seafield, and cost L. 3000. 
It is situated at the public square, and adds much to the appear- 
ance of the town.

Character and Condition of the People. — The parishioners may 
be characterized as in general, intelligent, moral, peaceable, and 
industrious ; possessing much natural affection, warm-hearted, and 
benevolent towards their poorer, brethren, plain and unaffect- 
ed in their manners, frank and sincere in their intercourse 
with others, obliging and neighbourly among themselves. They 
are possessed of a due share of the proverbial shrewdness of 
the north. Divine ordinances are greatly respected ; the Sab- 
bath is devoutly observed ; and there are few parishes in which 
the people are so unanimous in their attachment to the national 
church. There being, at all times, abundance of employment in 
the various departments of industry and good wages, the labouring 
classes enjoy a competent share of the comforts of life, and, from 
the ample provision made for the wants of the poor, abject pover- 
ty may be said to be a stranger to the parish. Like Scotchmen 
in general, the parishioners are strongly attached to the place of 
their nativity. Not a few of the present generation, who, in their 
youth, friendless and penniless, left the parish to push their way 
in the world, have realized handsome fortunes. 

In consequence of the fluctuations to which his calling is liable, 
it is impossible to calculate precisely a fisherman's annual gains ; 
but judging from personal observation, and the best information, 
the writer has no hesitation in stating it as his decided conviction, 
that there are comparatively few of the working classes in Scot- 
land, whose labours are so amply remunerated, as those of the 
fishermen on this coast ; and that with ordinary economy, every 



CULLEN. 



331 



family among them may enjoy in abundance the comforts of life. 
The almost invariable habit which prevails, of intermarrying 
with those of their own craft, and the no less general practice 
which obtains, of every fisherman's son following his father's oc- 
cupation, prove very serious drawbacks to the progress of this or- 
der of the community in the march of improvement; having the 
effect of rendering them a distinct class of society, with senti- 
ments, sympathies, and habits peculiar to themselves. Until some 
amalgamation shall take place between them and their brethren 
of terra Jirma, their advancement in the improvements of civilized 
life must necessarily be slow and partial. 

Habits and Amusements. — There is no marked peculiarity in 
the habits of the people, as regards language, dress, or mode 
of living. The names more peculiar to the parish, and of old- 
est standing are, Anderson, Coul, Davidson, Finluy, Forsyth, 
Gardiner, Hay, Ogilvie, Runcie, Simpson, Strahan, and Wright. 
In consequence of the frequent identity of Christian and surnames 
among the fishing population, caused by intermarriages, certain 
extra names are used to distinguish individuals. Thus, there are 
several heads of families of the respective names of Alexander Ad- 
dison, James Addison, and William Addison, who are thus dis- 
tinguished, viz. Alexander Addison, Saunders ; Alexander Addi- 
son, Kitti's Saunie ; Alexander Addison, DrodUe ; James Addi- 
son, Kitty's Jamesij ; James Addison, Tatie fiddler ; James Addi- 
son, Bubblie; William Addison, Sheepie ; William Addison, Boatie- 
row ; William Addison, Calkinapin ; William Addison, May's 
Wilsie. Snuffing and smoking are almost universal among the la- 
bourmg classes. Smuggling, which at one time prevailed so exten- 
sively in the district, owing to the facilities which its proximity 
to the sea afforded for the traffic in foreign contraband goods is 
now altogether unknown ; and from the vigilance exercised for 
the preservation of game, poaching may be considered as in a great 
measure impracticable. 

In former times, at Halloween, Christmas, and "other holidays 
when our manufactories were in their most flourishing state, the 
younger part of the community resorted to the sands and links of 
the bay of CuUen, for the purpose of playing foot-ball, running 
foot races, throwing the hammer, playing bowls, &amp;c. They left 
the town in procession, preceded by a piper and other music and 
were attended by numbers from the adjacent districts. The games 



332 



BANFFSHIllK. 



were keenly contested, and the victor was crowned by a bonnet 
adorned with feathers and ribbons, previously prepared by the 
ladies. When the games were over, the whole parties had a 
dance on the green, with that meriment and glee, to which the 
etiquette and formation of the ball-room at the present day are to- 
tal strangers. Thereafter, the procession was again formed, and 
returned°to the town, the victor preceded by the music, leading 
the way. A ball took place in the evening, at which he presided, 
and, moreover, had the privilege of wearing his bonnet and feathers. 
The bowls were played by rolling or throwing a cannon ball, and 
he who could with fewest strokes put it beyond a mark at the far- 
ther end of the links, was declared the victor. But a man having 
on one occasion been accidentally killed by the ball, this athletic 
game was forbidden by the magistrates, and has never since been 
revived. Now-a-days, the parishioners are in the occasional ha- 
bit of amusing themselves with the games of golf, shinty, foot-ball, 
and target-shooting, for which the links of CuUen afford excel- 
lent play.ground. Christmas and New-year's day, O. S., are uni- 
versally observed by the labouring classes ; on which occasions, 
there is an entire cessation from business, all appearing in holiday 
dress, and every mucMe pat containing something extra. The 
ancient festivities of harvest-home, halloween, and brose-day 
are still kept up in the parish. The people of Cullen have long 
been noted for their musical talents, and continue to sustain their 
character in this respect. The average weekly delivery of newspa- 
pers, from the post-office, to the inhabitants of Cullen proper, is 
120; besides which, a variety of magazines and periodicals are 
regularly received. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The whole extent of the parish, exclusive of the 
ground occupied by the sites of the New town and Sea town, 
amounting in all to 34 acres, is about 650 imperial acres, of which 
115 are waste pasturage and moor. Of the remaining 535 acres, 
110 form part of the extensive park of Cullen House, 200 
arable are let to the inhabitants of Cullen, and 225, also arable, 
are rented by the occupiers of the farms of Seafield, Tochieneal, 
and Shirrals, which extend into the adjoining parishes of Fordyce 
and Rathven. The waste ground and pasturage consist partly of 
steep rocky pasture, along the sea-shore, not susceptible of culti- 
vation, and forming part of a sheep range, held by the tenant of 
Seafield, which is connected with similar pasture in the parish of 



CULLEN. 



333 



Fordyce. The moorish waste ground, also on the farm of Seafield, 
is thin and rocky, standing high and exposed to the cold north 
winds. Little or none of it could be converted into arable land, 
unless at an expense which would render the undertaking unpro- 
fitable. 

Of the ground included in the Cullen House Park, about 30 
acres are under wood, the greater part of which was planted with- 
in the last thirty years by the present Earl of Seafield. These 
plantations consist chiefly of oak, ash, beech, elm, plane, maple, 
birch, lime, horse-chestnut, sweet chestnut, mountain-ash, and 
larch ; and, with the exception of a small part exposed to the 
northern blasts, are all thriving with a luxuriance, which is not ex- 
ceeded by any plantations in the north of Scotland, or perhaps in 
the island. Many of the elms planted about 100 years ago have 
attained the height of 97 feet, and measure from 10 to 12 feet in 
circumference, at 10 feet from the ground. Among the forest 
trees are interpersed a great variety of ornamental shrubs, which 
appear in great beauty. Many of the trees of older date are of 
large size, and contrast finely with those recently planted. An 
aged elm, overhanging a rocky bank of the water of Cullen above 
Cullen House, measures ICJ feet in circumference, at 12 feet from 
the ground, and standing alone with wide spreading boughs, forms 
a beautiful feature in the landscape. Several ash trees in the park 
measure from 8 to 12 feet in circumference, at 12 feet from the 
ground, and have attained a height of 100 feet. Some of the old 
larch and lime trees are also of great size and beauty; and there 
IS a cedar which has attained a growth, believed to be uncommon 
m the north of Scotland, measuring 6 feet in circumference, at 16 
feet from the ground. As the plantations about Cullen Houe 
have been laid out chiefly for ornament and shelter, they are per- 
haps not so much thinned and pruned as might be proper were 
the mcrease of the value of the timber the sole object in' view 
That part of the Cullen House Park not under wood, is, for the 
most part, kept in pasture, and produces grass of the richest quali- 
ty ; the sod being uncommonly fine, and having all been in cul- 
tivation from time immemorial, before being added to the park. 

The arable lands let to the inhabitants of Cullen are laid off in 
small lots. Few persons are in possession of more than what is 
requisite for the keep of a cow. The rents of these lots vary from 
L.l, 3s. 9d. to L.3, 1 Is. 4d. per imperial acre. Of the whole 
arable land let in the parish, the average rent is L.l, 16s. per im- 



334 BANFFSHIRF. 

perial acre. The rents of the small lot, occupied by the town's 
people, are higher than could be obtained for land in a different 
locahty, and let in farms; but land such as that in this parish 
would be valuable in any situation, being for the most part 
a rich deep loam of fine quality, a description which, with slight 
exceptions, is applicable to the other arable lands of the parish. 
In the more elevated parts, the soil is incumbent on gravel. Here 
it is comparatively thin, but sharp and productive. The greater 
part, however, has a subsoil of clay, which, in some places, renders 
the land wet, where the evil has not been remedied by dramage. 
A small portion of the arable land towards the south end of the 
parish, occupied by the town's people, is a poor stiff clay soil ; 
and part of the farm of Seafield, on the high grounds adjoinnig the 
moor, chiefly ground which has been reclaimed from waste, is ex- 
tremely light and thin. But, with these exceptions, the arable 
land of the parish is of very superior quality, and the climate be- 
ing good, it produces abundant crops of wheat, barley, oats, pota- 
toes, and turnips ; and it is particularly noted for yielding fine 
grass. The large quantity of fish offals, procured as manure from 
the fishing village of Cullen, and the other fishing stations in the 
neighbourhood, tends much to the fertility of this and several ad- 
joining parishes. The inhabitants of Cullen generally follow a 
short rotation of crops, with a view to having a considerable por- 
tion of their lands in green crops, for the keep of their cows. On 
the farms five and six shift courses are the rotations adopted. 

The only cattle kept by the town's people are cows. These 
are, for the most part, of the common breed of Banffshire, and 
are selected chiefly with a view to their qualities as milchers. The 
breed of cattle on the farms is a cross between the Banffshire 
and Teeswater breeds. This cross was introduced into the pa- 
rish about thirteen years ago, and has been attended with advan- 
tao-e to the farmers, more particularly of late years, since the ship- 
ping of cattle from the neighbouring port of Banff, for London 
and other places in the south, has given encouragement for high 
feeding ; these crosses being found to take on fat more quickly, and 
to arrive earlier at maturity than the old breed of the county, al- 
though not so well fitted for the former state of the markets, when 
the cattle were sold to drovers, and had to perform a long over- 
land iournev to the southern fairs. The sheep kept on the pasture 
of Seafield farm are of the Cheviot breed, but the range for them 
is considered too small, to admit of their being turned to great ad- 



CULLKN. 



335 



vantage. They are, however, the only description of stock suit- 
able for the ground, its steepness rendering it in many places un- 
safe for cattle. The practice of feeding off sheep on turnips, has 
not yet been introduced into the parish. 

No leases are given on the lands occupied by the town's people. 
The farms are let for a period of nineteen years, being the ordi- 
nary duration of leases on the Seafield estate. The only farm- 
buildings situated within the parish are those at Seafield. They 
are of a commodious and substantial description, and comprehend 
a thrashing- mill of five-horse power, wrought by steam, — the only 
thrashing-machine of the kind in the county. There are few per- 
manent enclosures in the parish ; but a considerable proportion of 
the grass lands on the farms is generally enclosed with wooden 
palings, which are obtained at a moderate cost, from the Earl of 
Seafield's extensive plantations in the immediate neighbourhood. 
The ordinary ploughs used in the parish are iron ones, of a good 
construction, made by the tradesmen of Cullen. Larger ploughs, 
with teams of four horses, are generally used by the farmers,'' for 
giving a deep furrow to land intended for green crop and fallow ; 
and Mr Smith's of Deanston subsoil plough has been used on 
all the farms. 

Upon the whole, this parish may be said to be in an advanced 
state, as regards agricultural management. Much has been done 
to the dramage of the wet lands, in the old mode of draining; and 
of late years, the Deanston system of thorough draining has been 
actively commenced. Stones are used where accessible; and in 
the southern part of the parish, where they cannot be procured 
but at a great expense, tiles have been lately introduced. A tile 
work for the manufacture of drain tiles was erected last vear, on 
the border of the parish, by the tenant of Tochieneal farm, John 
Wilson, Esq. This gentleman has also brought from StirliiiP- 
sh.re, one of Mr M'Ewan's lately invented drain-ploughs, an im- 
plement which, with a team of sixteen oxen, has performed the 
operation of casting drains for tiles in a very satisfactory manner, 
doing great credit to the ingenious inventor. 

Banffshire Farmer CM.-The influence of associations, for the 
promotion of the arts and sciences, must be regarded as among 
the rnost efficient means of improvement. It is impossible to con- 
template the transactions of the Highland and Agricultural So- 
ciety of Scotland, since its formation, and the gigantic strides

same period, without awarding to that noble institution, the merit 
of those mighty improvements, which have raised our native Scot- 
land to so distinguished a rank among the agricultural nations of 
the world, notwithstanding the comparatively unpropitious nature 
of its climate and soil. One, and perhaps the most important, of 
the benefits, resulting from the exertions of the above society, has 
been, the formation of local Associations throughout the country, 
by which means, every improvement in husbandry may be said to 
be brought to the door of the humblest individual. 

So far back as 1730, an Agricultural Association was formed in 
Banffshire, under the designation of " a Small Society of Farmers 
in Buchan," in which district, those parts of Banffshire, which are 
upon the south side of the river Deveron, have been generally in- 
cluded. Notwithstanding the modesty of its title, it was composed 
wholly of landed proprietors, several of whom belonged to the 
southern counties of Scotland. Although it is now scarce possible 
to ascertain the beneficial influence of this Society, upon the ge- 
neral state of the agriculture of the county, yet we may fairly pre- 
sume, that it had the effect of directing the attention of the noble- 
men and gentlemen of the district, to the concerns of husbandry, 
which had hitherto been accounted beneath the notice of people of 
fashion. 

In 1785, the proprietors and farmers of the county formed an 
Association, under the title of « the Banffshire Farming Society." 
Excellent rules were framed and printed, for conducting the busi- 
ness, and prosecuting the objects of the institution ; but they seem 
to have rested in good intention only. Politics usurped the place 
of the plough, and the meetings of the society became thinly at- 
tended. Those who continued their attendance, deemed it unfair, 
that they should bear both the expense and trouble of the busi- 
ness ; and, by a natural course of events, the funds were debited 
with the tavern bills. The consequence was, that the meetings 
of the Society dwindled into a kind of lounge for a few of the 
members, whose situation allowed them, without inconvenience, 
to attend. In this state of matters, a meeting was at last formed, 
for the purpose of investing the whole of the funds, which then 
amounted to a considerable sum, for carrying on a section of the 
turnpike county road ; which proposition was adopted, but not 
without a keen opposition. 

In 1821, an Agricultural Association was formed, under the 
name of " the Banffshire Farmer Club." This institution has fared 



CULLEN. 



337 



very differently from its predecessor, having, under judicious ma- 
nagement, been productive of the most beneficial results, in awak- 
ening a laudable spirit of enterprize and emulation among the 
agriculturists of the lower district of the county, who may bear 
a comparison with any of their brethren in Scotland, for skill and 
success in the several departments of husbandry. There are two 
ordinary meetings of the club in the course of the year, which are 
held at CuUen, on the first Tuesdays of March and November. 
On these occasions, the members dine together in an elesrant hall, 
provided for them by the liberality of the Right Honourable the 
Earl of Seafield, and, on the removal of the cloth, proceed to the 
discussion of some subject connected with agriculture, of which 
previous notice has been given, each member being expected to 
afford to those present, the benefit of his practical knowledge, as 
it may happen to bear upon the question for the day. An ex- 
traordinary meeting of the club is held annually at Cornhill, on 
the first Tuesday of August, for a competition show of horses and 
cattle, on which occasion, the sum of from L.25 to L.30 of the 
funds of the association, is expended in premiums to the successful 
competitors. The interest excited by the important object of 
this meeting, has the effect of securing a numerous attendance of 
local proprietors and tenants, and of agriculturists from the adja- 
cent districts. The quality of the stock exhibited is invariably 
such as to do the greatest credit to the exhibitors, and to main- 
fain the high character which the county has so long held, for the 
successful prosecution of this important branch of husbandry. 
Ploughing matches and seed shows are occasionally held, under 
the patronage of the club; and it deserves to be mentioned, that, 
to this association, the lower district of the county has been mainlv 
indebted for the services of a veterinary surgeon, — a liberal salary 
having been for many years paid, from the funds, for the encou- 
ragement of a resident practitioner of this important department 
of the healing art. The club is composed almost exclusively of 
landed proprietors, and practical farmers, and consists at present 
of eighty-three members, of whom twenty are honorary. Each 
member contributes one guinea annually to the funds. Attached 
to the club, is a library for the use of the member, containing 
100 volumes, on subjects more immediately connected with agri- 
culture. 

Fisheries.— h\\ the different kinds of white and shell fish, com- 
mon to Scotland, are to be found in abundance on the coast, and 



338 



BANFFSHIRE. 



tishing, on an extensive scale, has long been prosecuted by the 
inhabitants. About one-third of the whole population are directly 
dependent upon the produce of the sea, for their subsistence. 
There are seven first class boats employed in the deep sea fishery,  
each having an equipment of from eight to nine able-bodied men. 
The following is the routine of the Cullen fisherman's employ- 
ment throughout the year. The deep sea white-fishery, which is 
chiefly for cod, skate, and ling, commences in February, and con- 
tinues to the end of May. In the prosecution of this department 
of their calling, the fishermen usually resort to the distance of 
from twenty to'' sixty miles from land, and remain at sea for days 
and nights together, in the event of the weather proving favour- 
able. °On the return of the boats to shore, the operation of cur- 
ing the fish immediately commences ; the process of drying them, 
occupying a period of three or four weeks. The month of June 
is chiefly°employed in fishing for haddocks, which are cured into 
speldings. From the end of June, the fishermen are exclusively 
occupied in preparing for the herring-fishery, which commences 
about the 10th July, and continues for seven weeks, ending about 
the beginning of September. At the conclusion of the herring- 
fishery, the fishermen repair to the south for the disposal of their 
stock of dried fish, and in general find a ready market. From 
their return about the end of September, to the commencement 
of the deep sea fishery in February, they betake themselves to 
the haddock-fishery, which is generally prosecuted in skiffs or 
yawls, with four men to each, at the distance of from one to six 
miles from shore. With the exception of the small quantity that 
is sold fresh, chiefly to the inhabitants of the parish, the fish 
caught at this season are cured into yellow haddocks, by the pro- 
cesof smoking. The bait commonly used in the prosecution of 
the white-fishery is mussel, which is imported by the fishermen 
in their large boats, from the shores of Inverness, Cromarty, Ross, 
and Sutherland. The crews provide themselves annually with 
two or three cargoes each, at a cost of L.2, 10s. per boat load of 
nine tons. 

Herring-Fishery. — From the introduction of the herring-fishery 
into the Moray Frith in 1816, to 1837, the business was vigo- 
rously and successfully prosecuted at Cullen, by the native fisher- 
men. The seasons of 1834 and 1836 having proved unfavour- 
able, the fishermen became discouraged, and perceiving that their 
brethren, at the other stations on the coast, were reaping abun- 



CULLEiV. 



tlant harvests, while they were toiling from year to year, without 
adequate remuneration, they almost all to a man engaged them- 
selves to the curers at Wick, Macduff, Fraserburgh, and Peter- 
head, to which places they continue to resort annually. The 
average number of boats belonging to Cullen is thirty, each hav- 
ing a crew of four men, of whom, in general, two are the owners, 
the others being hired for the season. The ordinary terms on 
which the curers engage the boats, are lis. per cran of herrings, 
to the amount of 200 crans, besides certain allowances in name 
of bounty, drink money, &amp;c., which may amount to L.20 per 
boat. The following is an abstract of the quantity of white-her- 
rings, cod, and ling, cured at Cullen, from 1827 to 1841, inclusive.

Salmon- FisherT/.— For several years past, a salmon-fishery has 
been prosecuted in the bay of Cullen, with very considerable suc- 
cess. The parishioners are supplied, on moderate terms, with this 
delicious article of food ; but the bulk of the fish taken is sent 
to the London market. The bag-net is that exclusively used. 
1 he Me.ssrs Hogarth of Aberdeen are the tacksmen of the fishery.

the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows :—

Monu/actos.— Atone period, manufactures were carried on in 
this parish, to a considerable extent. The patriotic Earl of Find- 
later and Seafield, see Eminent Characters, to whom Banffshire 
has been so largely indebted for his beneficent exertions in the 
cause of improvements, introduced this branch of industry in 1748. 
His Lordship then presided at the Board of Trustees for Manu- 
factures at Edinburgh— an office which afforded him peculiar fa- 
cilities for the establishment of manufactures at CuUen ; and, ac- 
cordingly, under his fostering care, the measure was attended with 
entire success. The writer of the last Statistical Account of the 
parish states, " There are in this small place, 65 looms constant- 
ly employed in weaving linen, some few of them in weaving da- 
mask. The manufacturers also give out a great number of webs, 
to be woven by country weavers in their own shops. There are 
also seven stocking-looms constantly employed." Of CuUen, as re- 
gards manufactures, it may now be truly said, " non sum qualis 
eram ;" the business as a staple article of trade having altogether 
vanished. 

Harbour and Navigation.— In 1817, a small but substantial 
harbour was erected by the Earl of Seafield; and, in 1834, it was 
greatly enlarged and improved, by the erection of an additional 
quay, which has rendered it one of the best harbours in the Mo- 
rav Frith. From first to last, the work has cost his Lordship up- 
wards of L. 10,000. There is a depth of 8 feet water at the pier's 
head at neap tides, and of 12 feet at spring tides. There are 4 
vessels belonging to the port, of from 40 to 100 tons burthen 
each— amounting in all to 270 tons. The harbour-dues are 2d. 
per ton, and yield an annual revenue of L.70. The principal im- 
ports are, coals, salt, staves, and barley for distillation. The 
chief exports are, herrings, dried fish, timber, oats, and potatoes. 

Boat-Building, -c— Boat-building is carried on to a conside- 
rable extent in the parish, the abundance of timber grown in the 
immediate vicinity, affording ample facilities for the prosecution of 
this branch of industry. The average number of boats built in 
the course of the year, may be computed at 44, viz. boats of the 
first class, intended for the deep sea and herring-fibhery, 36 ;

skiffs or yawls, 8. There are three master builders, and the bu- 
siness affords employment to 22 individuals. Ship-building, to a 
small extent, is occasionally carried on. In the course of the last 
three years, five vessels, of from 40 to 110 tons each, and of su- 
perior construction, have been built and equipped at the harbour 
of Cullen. 

Distillery. — In 1824, a distillery was erected at Tochieneal, 
and received a very considerable enlargement in 1828. Average 
annual quantity of spirits distilled from malt for the last five years, 
25,292 gallons at proof: annual average duty paid for spirits and 
malt for the same period, L.5188, 13s. 3d. The work gives em- 
ployment to 12 persons, including two officers of excise. 

Mills. — There are three mills on the water of Cullen, viz. a lint- 
mill, a circular saw-mill, and a meal-riiill ; at the last of which, 
about 2500 bolls of grain oats and barley are annually ground. 
On the Seafield estate, the ancient lavi of astriction is abolished, 
the tenants being at liberty to have their grain milled where they 
please. 

Wages and Prices. — A male farm-servant usually receives from 
L.5 to L.7, 10s. half yearly, exclusive of lodging and maintenance. 
The wages of female domestics for the same period are from L.2 
to L.2, 15s. Herd-boys are hired at the rate of from L.l, 5s. to 
L.2 for the season of six months, with maintenance. Day-labour- 
ers earn Is. lOd. per day in summer, and Is. 5d. in winter, with- 
cut victuals. Harvest fees are, for a man, L.2, 5s. ; and for a 
female reaper, L.l, lOs., with maintenance. The following are 
the ordinary weekly wages of journeymen tradesmen : Black- 
smiths, 10s. 6d. ; masons, 15s.; shoemakers, 9s.; tailors, lOs. ; 
square-wrights, lis.; cart-wrights, lis.; boat-builders, 12s.; 
sawyers, 15s.; saddlers, 12s.; bakers, 10s.; slaters, 16s.; garde- 
ners, 9s.; coopers, 12s.; plasterers, 153. 6d. Carters charge 6d.

The following are the current prices of the under-mentione 
articles: An iron plough, fully mounted, L.3, 10s. to L.3, 15s.;

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Town and Filiate. — The town of CuUen consists of two parts, 
which are completely separated, viz. the New Town, and the Sea 
Town or Fish Town ; the latter being situated on the shore, and in- 
habited chiefly by fishermen. The predecessor of the former, 
which was called the Old Town, was meanly built, and, about 
twenty years ago, was utterly demolished, in order to make way 
for the improvements of CuUen House. The New Town, by which 
it was replaced, stands nearer to the sea than the old one did, be- 
ing close to the eastern extremity of the Sea Town, above which it 
is considerably elevated. It is a very neat little town. The houses 
are good, and the streets are laid out on a tasteful and regular 
plan, according to which but a moiety is as yet erected. The 
Boundary Commissioners observe, however, that, " being favour- 
ably situated for fishing, and in a well cultivated district, it may 
be expected to increase." Its symmetrical form presents a curious 
contrast to the contiguous awkward squad of fishermen's houses 
constituting the Sea 1 own, and which display a total independence 
of any thing like partial subordination to the " rank and file" of 
streets — their relative positions very much resembling those of 
hail-stones as they fall on the ground. 

As an agreeable and desirable residence, the town of CuUen 
possesses many advantages. It lies on the post-road, and in a 
highly salubrious district. It is beautifully situated on the mar- 
gin of the romantic bay of Cullen, and in the immediate vicinity 
of the picturesque grounds of Cullen House. The society is most 
respectable ; and all sorts of commodities are to be had at a mo- 
derate cost. It has the benefit of a post-office, a regular butcher- 
market, a brewery, a convenient harbour, good schools, skilful 
tradesmen, excellent shops, gas-light, a copious supply of good 
water, plenty of all the necessaries of life supplied from a rich 
country, on the one hand, and an ample supply of all kinds of

fish from the sea, on the other, with the command of abundance 
of the various sorts of fuel. 

Means of Communication. — Cullen enjoys the advantage of a 
local post-office, which, previous to the introduction of the penny 
postage, yielded an average revenue of L. 165 ; present revenue, 
Ii.95. There are daily mails to and from Aberdeen and the south, 
and to and from Inverness and the north. The turnpike road, from 
Banff to Fochabers, traverses the parish for a distance of one mile 
and a half, and passes through the town. A new line of excellent 
turnpike from Cullen to Keith, was opened in 1836. A stage- 
coach between Elgin and Banff passes and repasses the burgh 
daily ; and there is a weekly communication with Aberdeen and 
Inverness, by means of carriers' waggons. Steam-boats plying be- 
tween Inverness and London, and between Leith and Inverness, 
pass through the bay of Cullen. The Cullen toll-bar, for the 
Banff and Keith turnpikes, is situated at the distance of two fur- 
longs to the southward of the town, and yields an average reve- 
nue of L. 150. 

Municipal State. — Cullen is a royal burgh of considerable anti- 
quity, as appears from a charter of James I., 6th March 1455, ra- 
tifying another of Robert L, by which were granted to the burgh, 
the usual liberties, privileges, and advantages. There is reason 
to believe, however, that Cullen possessed the privileges of royal- 
ty previous to the time of Robert I. and that the act of that sove- 
reign was but a confirmation or ratification of burghal privileges, 
conferred previously either by William the Lion, or, according 
to tradition, by Malcolm Canmore. Similar to Banff, it was at 
one time a constabulary, of which the Earl of Findlater was here- 
ditary constable, by virtue of an ancient right. He ultimately be- 
came hereditary chief magistrate, with the title of Freses. Under 
the old constitution of the burgh, the council consisted of the 
preses, three bailies, dean of guild, treasurer, and thirteen coun- 
cillors, — in all, nineteen ; the jurisdiction extending over a dis- 
trict of about three miles from east to west, and two from north to 
south. Here, corporations have never existed, every one being 
entitled to buy, sell, and manufacture as he chose ; and burgess- 
ship was constituted simply by giving a " burgess-act." Merchant 
councillors were chosen from the sellers of goods, trades council- 

The oldest notice of Cullen on record, so far as is known to the writer, is a deed 
in the chartulary of Moray, in which William the Lion grants to Richard, Bishop 
of iMoray, " unum toftuni in Burgo de Banef, unum in luverculan, &amp;c."

lors from handicraftsmen. Bv the Burgh Reform Act of 1833, the 
number and order of the council are the same as under the old 
constitution, with this exception, that the office of chief magis- 
trate or provost is no longer hereditary in the Cullen House fa- 
mily. The Parliamentary boundaries, which are not nearly so ex- 
tensive as the royalty, extend from the water-mouth of Cullen, 
along the shore, to the Maiden Paps ; thence, due south to the 
Logie road ; thence, in a straight line to the point at which the 
Banff and Keith roads meet ; thence, to the point at which the 
Seafield and Slacks roads meet ; and thence to the bridge over 
the water of Cullen, the boundary terminating at the water- 
mouth. Municipal constituency, 38. Annual revenue from L.70 
to L.80 ; expenditure from L.60 to L.65. The burgh possesses 
this peculiarity, that for long it has been altogether free of debt.

Members of the British and Imperial Parliaments. — At the 
union with England, 13th June 1707, the burghs of Elgin, Banff, 
Cullen, Inverury, and Kintore, sent one member to the British 
Parliament: and since 2d February 1801, the union with Ire- 
land, till 3d December 1832, when the Parliament was dissolved 
after the passing of the Reform Bill, one member to the Imperial 
Parliament. By the Reform Act of 1832, the town of Peterhead 
was associated with this district of burghs in sending one member 
to the Imperial Parliament. The following is a list of the Mem-

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish of Cullen originally formed 
part of the parish of Fordyce, from which it was disjoined at a very 
remote period. The parish church is a fabric of great antiqui- 
ty, {Ecclesiastical History and Antiquities, and, like many of the 
religious edifices of the olden time, bears the form of a cross. Not- 
withstanding its extreme age, the walls are still in a sound state, 
and seem destined to endure for centuries. The site is highly ro 
mantic, being in the centre of the ancient burying-ground, which 
is almost completely environed by the picturesque pleasure- 



BANFFSHIRE. 



grounds of CuUeii House, from which the church is only forly 
yards distant. The interior presents a most venerable appearance, 
— its dingy light, antique fittings, and the ancient monuments 
which grace its walls, combining to impart to it a very imposing 
aspect, and well calculated to aid devotional feeling. The pecu- 
liarity of its construction, and the circumstance of never having 
been ceiled, render public speaking in it somewhat difficult, and a 
very considerable strength of voice is requisite, to enable the 
preacher to be generally heard. It was enlarged about forty-four 
years ago, by the erection of an additional aisle, which, from the 
circumstance of the minister being invisible to the great body of 
the hearers, who occupied that portion of the church, by reason of 
the awkward situation of the pulpit, was commonly denominated 
" the believers' loft," — a title which is no longer applicable, the 
evil having been remedied by changing the situation of the pul- 
pit. The church is situated close to the western boundary of Cul- 
len proper. It is somewhat about a mile equidistant from the 
northern, eastern, and southern extremities of the parish, and 
three miles from the most remote boundary of the annexation. 
Since the removal of the old town of CuUen, in the centre of 
which it stood, its situation has become not a little inconvenient 
for the parishioners, being nearly a mile distant from the New 
town and Sea town, where nine-tenths of the population are loca- 
ted. It is seated for 800, allowing eighteen inches to each per- 
son. The sittings are all free and undivided, — the parishioners 
being at liberty more gregis to accommodate themselves wherever 
they please. In summer, the whole of the sittings are fully occu- 
pied, and in winter, the attendance is one-third less. The ave- 
rage number of communicants is 640, and of male heads of fami- 
lies in full communion with the church, 220. There is no regular 
Dissenting place of worship, either in Cullen proper, or in the an- 
nexation. In the former, the entire number of Dissenters may be 
computed at 26 souls, viz. Episcopalians, 5 ; Wesleyan Metho- 
dists, 7 ; Independents, 2 ; Roman Catholics, 12. With the 
above exceptions, the whole of the parishioners of Cullen proper 
professedly belong to the Established Church. The greater part 
of the Dissenters give occasional attendance at the parish church, 
and the members of the Methodist communion are in the habit 
of receiving sealing ordinances, at the hands of the parish minis- 
ter. There are, usually, four extraordinary church collections du-

ring the year, for religious and charitable purposes, of which the 
average amount is L. 20. 

A handsome manse and suitable set of offices were erected in 
1830. The glebe measures about five Scotch acres, and is of ex- 
cellent arable land, of the annual value of L. 4, 10s. per acre. 
The stipend consists of the following items: L. 109, 12s. 5d. ; 
barley, 3 quarters, 5 bushels, 2 pecks, l lippies; meal, 7 bolls, 
3 firlots, 3 pecks, 1 lippie; L.3, 6s. 8d. paid from the funds of 
the burgh : L. 36, 8s. 4d. added by the Exchequer. In addition 
to the above, the minister receives L.8, 6s. 8d for supplying com- 
munion elements, L. 5 in lieu of a grass glebe, and L.8, 6s. 8d. 
as remuneration for right to peat-moss surrendered. 

The Right Honourable the Earl of Seafield is patron and sole 
heritor.

Seafield Church. — An additional Church, bearing the above title, 
In compliment to the noble family of Seafield, to whose munifi- 
cence the erection was mainly owing, was erected in 1838-39, in 
the quoad sacra district of the parish, under the impulse of the 
General Assembly's Church Extension movement. The entire 
cost of the erection has been L.668; and it is satisfactory to state 
that it is altogether free of debt. The population of the district for 
whose accommodation the church is specially designed is upwards 
of 900; number of sittings, 450; annual seat rent, from Is. to 3s. 
6d., the average being 2s. ; annual amount of seat rents, about L.40;

of ordinary church collections, L. 29. The collections, by consent 
of Lord Seafield, go to the benefit of the chapel funds, until the debt 
is liquidated, subject to a deduction of an annual paynnent to the 
parochial funds for behoof of the poor, to make up the deficiency 
in the latter caused by the new erection. Since the church was 
opened, 16th October 1839, divine service has been performed in it 
every Lord's day by the minister of Cullen, aided occasionally by 
the members of presbytery, and the resident probationers ; and 
there is a fair prospect of soon procuring the services of a stated 
pastor for the charge. 

Ediicaiion.— The parish is abundantly supplied with the means 
of education, there being altogether in Cullen proper, seven schools, 
of which four are endowed. The salary of the parochial teacher, 
which is the medium, aided by an old bequest, is L.36 ; the aver- 
age yearly amount of school fees is L. 40 ; and, as the school en- 
joys the benefit of the Dick bequest, his official emoluments may 
be estimated at upwards of L. 100 per annum. The parochial 
school-house is suitable and commodious ; and the teacher is pro- 
vided with an excellent dwelling-house and garden. The average 
daily attendance of scholars throughout the year, is 78. 

A boarding and day school, for the instruction of young ladies 
in the plain and ornamental branches of education, is under the 
direction of an accomplished teacher ; the branches taught and 
terms charged, being the same with those in similar provincial esta- 
blishments. The teacher is accommodated with an excellent dwel- 
ling-house and small garden, rent free, provided by the Earl of 
Seafield ; and in addition to the fees, she receives a salary of fifteen 
Tuineas, of which his Lordship contributes ten, and the town-coun- 
cil five. 

An infant school, patronised and endowed by the noble family 
of Seafield, was instituted in 1839. It is efficiently taught by a 
female, and is usually attended by from 70 to 80 scholars, from 
the age of two and a-half to that of seven years. The school fee 
is one penny per week, in addition to which, the teacher receives 
a salary of fourteen guineas, and is, moreover, provided with a free 
school-room and dwelling-house. 

An unendowed school, for the ordinary branches of education, 
has, for many years, been successfully taught by the individu- 
al vvho holds the office of session-clerk, at which the average daily 
attendance is in summer 60, and in winter 120— the latter includ- 



CULLEN

ing an evening class, for the instruction of farm-servants and young 
tradesmen. 

In addition to the above, there are three schools, one of which 
has an endowment of a salary of L.5, the joint gift of the Earl of 
SeaBeld and the town-council of Cullen, taught by dames, and 
attended by children from three to ten years of age, who are in- 
structed in reading, knitting, and sewing. These humble semi- 
naries are of much consequence to the labouring classes, and are 
highly deserving of encouragement, were it for nothing more, than 
their utility in relieving mothers of much trouble during the day, 
and keeping their children out of harm's way. 

The people in general are fully alive to the advantages of edu- 
cation, as is apparent from the fact, that the average daily attend- 
ance of scholars throughout the year is 330, or upwards of one- 
fifth of the whole population. There is no portion of the parish 
so distant from school as to prevent regular attendance, and the 
circumstances of the parishioners at large are such as enable them, 
without difficulty, to pay the school fees. Formerly, education 
was much neglected by the fishing population, but a marked change 
for the better has happily taken place, and is on the increase. On 
the whole, it may be said of this parish, that the interests of edu- 
cation are in fully as prosperous a state, as in any of the provincial 
parishes of Scotland. 

Sabbath Schools. — Of these there is one in Cullen proper, and 
another in the annexation, which are under the immediate super- 
intendence of the minister, and usually attended by from 200 to 
300 scholars. During the greater part of the year, the minister 
teaches two Bible classes weekly, which are well attended. They 
are designed for the benefit of adults of both sexes, whether single 
or married, of young persons who have left the juvenile Sabbath 
schools, and of all who propose to offer themselves for admission 
to the ordinance of the Lord's Supper. 

Bursaries.ln 1675, Mr John Lorimer, town -clerk of Cullen, 
bequeathed a croft of land, containing about one and a half Scotch 
acres, with the buildings upon it, for the education of a boy at the 
school of Cullen, of his own name, or related to him, and appointed 
the town-council and kirk-session of Cullen, joint patrons of the 
bursary. In consequence of the removal of the old town of Cul- 
len, the bursary land is now within the precincts of the Cullen 
House policy, and is held in tack by the Earl of Seafield, who 
pays an annual rent of 5 qrs. 3 bushels, 3 pecks, If lippies, bear

convertible into money at the county fiars price. On a recent ap- 
plication by the Noble Earl to the patrons, the latter agreed to an 
excambion of the bursary land, which is now in course of being 
made. In 1764, Mr William Lorimer of St James's Parish, Lon- 
don, grandnephew of the aforesaid Mr John Lorimer, out of gra- 
titude for the benefit of his own education, upon his grandimcle's 
foundation, bequeathed a sum of money sufficient to yield L.l 
yearly, to provide books for his granduncle's bursar, and also 10s. 
yearly, to the schoolmaster of CuUen, for his attention to said 
bursar. The benefit of this bursary continues for the space of 
five years. 

The aforesaid Mr William Lorimer was also the founder of a 
separate bursary, having, in 1764, bequeathed the sum of L.200 
for the education of his granduncle's bursar, if found qualified, 
and the relations of his mother, alternately, at the High School 
of Aberdeen, for one year, and, thereafter, at Marischal College, 
for four years. The foundation is under the management of the 
Magistrates and Town- Council of Aberdeen, the Principal and 
Professors of Marischal College, and the Magistrates and Minister 
of Cullen. In consequence of the lack of candidates for this bur- 
sary since its foundation, the funds have accumulated to such an 
amount, as to admit of the simultaneous education of two bursars, 
and yielding the annual sum of L.l 2 to each. 

In 1721, Mr John Watson, Merchant in Edinburgh, a native 
of the parish of Cullen, bequeathed 2000 merks Scotch, for assisting 
in the education of a boy at the school of Cullen, related to him 
by father or mother, — the nearest of kin to be preferred. The 
patronage of the bursary is vested in the kirk-session of Cullen. 
The sum originally mortified yields L.2, 2s. per annum to the 
bursar, who enjoys the benefit for the period of four years. The 
same benevolent individual founded similar bursaries at the schools 
of Banff and Fordyce. 

The above bequests, under judicious management, have proved 
most beneficial to the founders' relations, and have been the means 
of raising many a destitute youth to opulence and respectability. 

Parochial Library. — In 1830, a parochial library was established. 
It consists of a well-selected assortment of works, in the several 
departments of literature and science. 

Friendly Societies. — Formerly, the following friendly Societies 
existed in the parish, viz. Innocent's Lodge of Free Masons, in- 
stituted 1808; Linen Society, instituted 1792; Wrights' Society, 



CULLEN. 



transferred from Banfl", 1806. The above Societies were instituted 
for the purpose of relieving sick and indigent brethren, their wi- 
dows and children. They were all dissolved in 1832, in conse- 
quence of an Act of Parliament passed, or about to be passed, at 
that time, respecting the funds of Friendly Societies. The Mason 
Lodge was remodelled in 1835. It consists at present of from 
60 to 70 members, and has a disposable fund of about L. 100. 
This Society, previous to its dissolution in 1832, numbered 270 
members. 

Poor and Poor's Funds. — The average number of persons re- 
gularly receiving parochial aid is 87, viz. 71 in Cullen proper, 
and 16 in the annexation. The distributions are made quarterly; 
intermediate aid being advanced occasionally, in case of urgent 
necessity. The average sum allotted to each person per annum 
is, in Cullen proper, 15s. 4|d., and in the annexation, 14s. 3d. 
The average annual amount of monies, for the last seven years, 
available for behoof of the poor, and under the management of 
the kirk session, is L.76, 14s. lOd., arising from the following 
sources, viz. church collections, L.59, 4s. 6d. ; interest of funds, 
L.6, 9s. 4d. ; dues on proclamations of banns, L.l, 18s. lid.; 
hire of mortcloth, L.l, 6s. 9|d.; mortification, L.2, 2s.; penalties, 
L.5, 13s. 4|d. The average annual expenditure, for the same 
period, is L.78, 13s. 8d., viz. quarterly distributions, L.66, 6s. 2d. ; 
occasional aid, L.4, 15s. ; officers' fees and other expenses, 
L.7, 12s. 5§d. There never has been an assessment for the sup- 
port of the poor ; the voluntary contributions of the community, 
together with the items above staled, having hitherto proved suf- 
ficient for affording the usual rate of aliment. 

Bede-House. — There formerly existed in the parish a bede- 
house, or hospital, for the maintenance of a limited number of 
decayed persons, the origin of which cannot now be precisely de- 
termined. It appears to have been founded by the Findlater fa- 
mily, and its name marks it as an institution of Popish times. 

Bede, in Saxon, prayer ; hcde men, who joined in tlie celebration of masses for 
the dead. The writer has gleaned the following traditionary notices regarding the 
Bede House of Cullen, which may be relied on as substantially correct. The lands 
of Upper Pattenbringan and Brunton were mortified, for the support of eio-ht de- 
cayed farmers, and eight farmers' widows. A house of two storeys was built for 
them in Cullen; each flat divided into eight sleeping apartments and a kitchen 
The men occupied the lower, and the women the upper flat. The men had two pecks 
of oatmeal, and the women one and a-half ditto each per week. From Pattenbringan 
and 'Hrunton, wcuk abont, they were supplied with milk in summer, and beer

About sixty years ago, the liospital system was abolished, and the 
funds, which are under the patronage and management of the 
Earl of Seafield, are expended in stated and occasional allowances 
of meal, to poor families belonging to the parishes of CuUen, Rath- 
ven, Deskford, and Fordyce, residenters on the Seafield estate ; 
by which means the charity is rendered more extensively useful. 
From the above source, the parish of Cnllen derives about 85 
bolls annually ; of which, 70 bolls are shared by 40 persons, in 
weekly pecks and half pecks ; ten and a-quarter bolls are placed 
at the disposal of the kirk -session ; and five bolls are distributed 
by the local factor.  

winter. Tlie allowance of milk was the produce of one cow, and unskimnied ; tlie 
allowance of beer was the produce of two pecks of malt. At Christmas, yearly, 
they were furnished from the aforesaid farms, alternately, with a good fat horned 
niairf, and salt to salt it. The horns supplied them with spoons, and the hide with 
broguts. From Paltenbringan and Brunton, week about, a female servant was sent 
to make the men's beds and clean out their apartments. From the same farms, 
they got what was called leet peals for fuel, in equal proportions, which were not 
only brought to their door, but built up for them ; and if their fuel fell short, Cullen 
House was bound to make up the deficiency. They were annually supplied with 
blue top coats, and the old ones were made into vests and breeches. When they 
wanted bed-clothes, they carried the old to Cullen House, and received new. They 
were all obliged, if in health, to attend church every Sabbath, and they sat on forms, 
in front of the recumbent stone figure within the elegant sarcojjhagus, in tlie eastern 
aisle of the church. The eight figures, in niches, along the foot of tlie tomb, are 
supposed to represent the bede men. It is said, that, at one period, part of their 
duty was to sit at the church doors, with pike staves in their hands, in order to pre- 
vent the ingress of dogs. A herald, from Edinburgh, visited the Bede Mouse half 
yearly, when every lede man and bede woman was interrogated separately, if tliey 
had any complaint to make in regard to their domestic comfort, and if so, Culhn 
House was immediately applied to for redress. 

 The following bequests have been made by persons, natives of, or connected 
with, the parish of Cullen. In 1650, John Lawtie, burgess of Cullen, bequeathed 
his whole property, consisting of a house, a garden, and a croft of land, for behoof 
of the poor of Cullen, which pays, of yearly rent, to the kirk session, L.2, 2s. In 
1657, William Lawtie, of Myre House,' bequeathed a croft of land, with some houses, 
and a sum of money, with which were purchased some additional acres of land, 
within the parish, for behoof of poor persons related to him, or beaiing his name. 
The aforesaid bequests are under the patronage and management of the heirs and 
representatives of the founders. William Leslie, of Birdsbank, an heritor in the 
parish, bequeathed the sum of 1000 merks Scotch, ar.d ajipointed the interest to be 
applied as an encourageitient to a schoolmaster in Cullen. under the direttion of the 
mao-istrates. This money, by a negotiation of that body, was settled in the hands 
of the Earl of Findiater, upon his agreeing to make some addition to it, and he 
thereby became patron of the school. A Mr Smith bequeathed a house, a garden, 
and a croft of land, and appointed the rents of them as an additional encouragement 
to the schoolmaster, of Cullen. Collector John Ogilvie, of the Customs at Inverness, 
tmd his son, Bailie William Ogilvie, Merch.mt in BanflT, bequeathed the sum of L.44, 
9s. the interest to be applied, by the kirk-session of Cullen, for behoof of the found- 
ers' poor relations, and the poor of the jiarish, in equal parts. The following be- 
quests were made to the kirk-session of Cullen, for behoof of the poor, viz. Mr James 
Ogilvie, formerly wadsetter of Logie, L.16, LSs. 4d. ; in 1805, Dr Brands, Jamaica, 
L.20; in 1824, Miss Janet Grant, daughter of the Rev. Robert Grant, formerly 
minister of CuUen, L.20.

Tlie Noble family of Seafield distribute annually, in voluntary 
charity, forty-one bolls of meal, among twenty indigent and aged 
females, residenters in the parish of Cullen ; and, in other respects, 
attend to the wants of the poor, with a beneficence and liberality 
worthy of their honoured name. There is an annual subscription 
among the inhabitants, for the support of a coal fund, from which 
the poor are liberally supplied, during the winter months, with 
that important article of the necessaries of life. 

It thus appears, that the wants of the poor of this parish are 
most amply provided for; in proof of which, it deserves to be 
mentioned, that there is scarcely ever such a thing as regular beg- 
ging on the part of the inhabitants. The people evince much of 
the ancient spirit of independence, in their laudable efforts to 
maintain themselves by the labour of honest industry, so long as 
the power of doing so remains, and show much reluctance in'ap- 
plying for parochial relief. 

Banks.-K branch of the Aberdeen Bank was established in 
the burgh in 1837. It has experienced very considerable success, 
and has proved an important boon to the community of Cullen 
and the surrounding districts. A savings' bank was established in 
1816, and has been productive of the most beneficial effects. 
The institution is open to the inhabitants of the adjacent parishes. 
The followmg is a statement of its affairs, 1st April 1842 : num- 
ber of depositors, 480 ; amount of principal sums due, L.7069, 
15s. 7id.: amount of interest due, L.260, 13s. 4d.; total amount 
due to depositors, L.7330, 9s. ; average sum of each deposit 
L.15, 5s. 5d. ' 

Courts.— The following courts are statedly held in Cullen, viz. 
Sheriff Sm.all-debt Court, for sums not exceeding L.8, 6s. 8d on 
the second Thursday of February, June, and October; Just'ice 
of Peace Court, on the first Tuesday of every month, for sums not 
exceedmg L.5 ; Registration Court, for the enrolment of Parlia 
mentary electors under the Reform Act, in August annually. The 
ordmary meetmgs of the Reverend the Presbytery of Fordvce are 
held at Cullen.  

Prison.— The only place of confinement in the burgh is a lock- 
up-house, for the purpose of punishing petty delinquents by a short 
imprisonment, and to be used, in case of need, for the afe cus- 
tody of prisoners on their way to the county jail. It consists of 
three apartments or cells of moderate dimensions, vaulted, paved 
lighted, and ventilated. ' 



'yj4 BANFFSHIRE. 

Jnsurnnce Companies.— There are three branches of Insurance 
Companies in the parish, viz. tlie Scottish Union, the Aberdeen 
Fire and Life, and the North of Scotland. 

Fairs and Markets.— these, there are three held annually, 
viz. Whitsunday market, on the third Friday of May ; Martmmas 
market, on the second Friday of November ; St John's fair, on 
the 7ih January. They are chiefly for the feeing of servants, and 
are well attend;d. There is a weekly market for the sale of grain 
durino- the spring months, at which business, to a considerable 
amount, is occasionally transacted; and dealers frequenting it are 
accommodated with the use of excellent grain lofts, which are let 

on moderate terms. 

Inns and Alefiouses.— There are two inns in the burgh. 1 he 
principal inn is a handsome and commodious building, and inferior 
to none on the route from Aberdeen to Inverness. The internal 
accommodation is such as deservedly to attract the admiration of 
strangers, and the posting department is very complete. In the 
Seatown, there are three public-houses. There are thus altoge- 
ther five public-houses, including the two inns. This number does 
not appear to be unreasonably great ; and the magistrates of Cul- 
len deserve well of the community, for the laudable exercise of 
their discretion, in the granting of licenses to so very moderate an 
extent. 

Gas-Light.—k Gas-light Company was formed in 1841, with 
a capital of L.IOOO, in as many shares; and, in November last, 
the inhabitants obtained the benefit of this light in great purity 
and brilliancy. The gas has already been introduced into eighty 
houses, with the prospect of the number being speedily doubled. 
The consumpt of gas for six months, from 5th November 1841, 
has been 80,000 cubic feet. The charge is 16s. per 1000 cubic 

feet. c c \ 11 

iwe/.— Formerly peat constituted the chief article of fuel, which 

was obtained from a moss in the immediate vicinity. The moss 
being now under cultivation is no longer serviceable for fuel ; nor, 
indeed, have the parishioners any cause to regret the loss of their 
privilege. They are abundantly supplied with coal on moderate 
terms ; and, all things considered, the change has proved advan- 
tageous in regard both to comfort and economy. Peat is still 
occasionally used, being brought from the neighbouring parishes

of Rathven and Deskford ; and the extensive forests belonging to 
the Earl of Seafield afford, at all times, abundance of fire-wood. 



 The writer begs to acknowledge his obligations to the fol- 
lowing gentlemen, for the valuable aid afforded him by them in the 
compilation of the foregoing statistics, viz. John Wilson, Esq. 
Tochieneal; James Christie, Esq. Solicitor, Banff; and Mr James

PRESBYTEllV OF ABEBLOUR, SYNOD OF MORAY. 

THE HEV. L. W. FORBES, A, M., MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
In very early times, there seems to have been a parish of Arn- 
dilly, then called Artendol, the church of which stood on the emi- 
nence which is now the site of the mansion-hou-e of Arndilly, on 
the banks of the Spey, in the south-west corner of the present pa- 
rish. Vestiges of such ecclesiastical occupation of this lovely spot 
remained till within the memory of man, the ruins of the church 
being cleared away to make room for part of the offices of the 
mansion-house, and an equivalent being then given for the glebe, 
which now forms part of the lawn. 

In the chartulary of Moray, as quoted by Shaw in his History 
of the Province, there is a deed recorded, which must be of date 
about A. D. 1215, by which William, the son of William, the son 
of Freskyn de Moravia, of a family very distinguished at that time, 
and possessed of large domains in this district, granted to the ca- 
thedral church of Moray " the church of Artendol, with all its 
pertinents, excepting the corn tithes of the two Davochs, which 
lay next to his Castle of Bucharin, viz. Bucharin and Achelna- 
thorck, which tithes, by the consent of Brice, Bishop of Moray, 
were assigned to the grantor's chapel of his Castle of Bucharin for 
the support of a chaplain." if by " Achelnathork" we are to un- 



BANFFSHIRE. 



dersland the property now called " Aiichlunkart," then these two 
Davochs constitute the greater part of what was the parish of Bo- 
harm down to the year 1788, and it is conjectured that the church 
at Arndilly having been allowed to go to ruin, perhaps even before 
the Reformation, the chapel of the Castle of Bucharin, in a much 
more centrical and convenient situation, became the place of wor- 
ship for the whole district, and gave name to the parish. 

In the year 1788, the parish of Dundurcos, lying due north 
from Boharm, on both sides of the Spey, was suppressed, and the 
part of it which lay to the east of the river was annexed to Bo- 
harm, except one small property, Aikenway, which, with the lands 
on the west side of the river, was annexed to Rothes. The an- 
nexation added to Boharm upwards of a third both in extent of 
surface and in the number of the population. 

The old parish is in the county of Banff. The annexation, ex- 
cepting a small fragment in Banffshire, is in the county of Elgin. 

]ame. — The name, Bucharin, Bucharn, Boharme, Boharm, is 
said, in the former Account, and in Shaw's History, to signify in 
Gaelic " the bow round the hill" and this is very descriptive of the 
parish as now constituted : for the Spey being the boundary on the 
west, and the mountain Benagen rising almost abruptly from the 
bed of that river, the cultivated part of the parish consists chiefly 
of a circular valley on the south, east, and north sides of the hill. 
But as this description is only partially applicable to the district so 
named of old, the old parish containing only one-half of the bow, 
one is rather inclined to seek another derivation, and to suppose 
that the castle, whence, as we have seen, the parish had its ori- 
gin, took its name from its own situation, and bestowed it on its 
dependent district. It stood on the point where the brook Al- 
tarn, now Aldernie, i, e. the burn of alders, flows into the Fiddich, 
which, just at that point, takes a very singular turn in its course. 
Hence, perhaps, Bucharn, or " the bend of the alder stream," for 
the name of the castle, and so from the castle to the parish which 
it originated. 

Boundaries and Extent. — The parish, as now formed, is bound- 
ed by Mortlach on the south ; by Aberlour on the south-west ; 
by Rothes on the west ; by Fochabers or Bellie on the north and 
north-east ; by Keith on the east ; and by Botriphnie on the 
south-east. From the boundary with Aberlour at the confluence 
of tlic Fiddich with the Spey, it is about 13 miles in length. 



BOIIAHM. 



357 



From the boundary with Mortlach to that with BeUie, which may 
he taken for the mean length, the distance is about 9 miles. The 
breadth from Keith and Botriphnie boundaries to the Spey ave- 
rages 4 miles ; but at the middle of the length, the cultivated and 
inhabited part is of considerably less breadth ; being much com 
pressed by the bulky mass of Benagen, which occupies a very 
great proportion of the whole surface, and forms the circular val- 
ley already mentioned, which, narrow in the middle, and expand- 
ing at either end, is all cultivated, both in the bottom and to a 
considerable distance up the slopes on each side, and to which, 
and a valley opening into it, from Keith eastward, to a detached 
district in the eastern angle, and to a narrow strip along the river, 
interrupted at the middle for about two miles, partly by the penin- 
sular pendicle annexed from Dundurcos to Rothes, and partly by 
the abrupt ascent of the hill, the cultivation is chiefly confined. 
On the map, the parish has nearly the figure of a long parallelo- 
gram, following the course of the Spey from south to north. The 
whole, except the strip along the river, lies high above the level 
of the sea. The summit level of the bottom of the valley running 
round the hill is 400 feet above the sea level, from which height 
the valley gradually descends to both ends, till near the junctions 
with the valley of the Spey, when the descents become very abrupt. 
In the other valley, opening from the east, the waters divide, — 
one-half running to the Deveron at twelve miles distance east, the 
other to the Spey at four miles distance west. The height of 
Benagen above the sea is 1500 feet, and, on the south and east, 
the cultivated ground extends nearly half-way up its sides. 

Meteorology and Climate. — A register of the weather was kept 
at the old manse by the late incumbent, now the learned Profes- 
sor of Humanity and Natural History in King's College, Aber- 
deen, and one of the ministers of St Machar's, which, from July 
1803 to February 1809, has been already published in the Agri- 
cultural Survey of Banffshire. 

The present incumbent has, since March 1818, but, it is to be 
feared, with much less accuracy, kept a register both of the 
iveatherand of vegetation at the new manse, about three miles nearer 
the sea, and about fifty feet nearer the sea level. 

The prevailing wind is the south-west, particularly in autumn 
and spring, and it is often very violent, sweeping down the long 
valley of the Spey, which, till it turns here, runs to the south-east. 



358 



BANFFSHIRE. 



After blowing strongly for a day or two, these westerly gales often 
end in rain or snow. It is observable, that, when very violent, 
they always send the river down more or less flooded, partly, per- 
haps, from their own action on the stream, but oftener, it is sup- 
posed, by bringing the rains to the upper part of the river before 
they reach us, or where they are exhausted without reaching us at 
all. 

As spring advances, this district is often visited with cold east- 
erly haars, frequently accompanied with frosty fogs, extremely 
prejudicial to early vegetation. In the early part of summer, the 
wind not unfrequently sets in from the north, for a considerable 
tract of time steadily dry. In summer, thunder is frequent; and, from 
the proximity of the hills, the accompanying rains are very heavy 
and destructive. Contrary to what might be expected, the parish 
is singularly free from early frosts in autumn, and this much miti- 
gates the lateness of its vegetation and harvest. There is always 
one considerable flood, sometimes two or three in the early part 
of autumn, and the cold winter rains commence generally about 
the middle of November. 

The climate, except in the strip along the river, where the ele- 
vation is small, and the soil gravelly, is cold and moist. The 
rains are frequent, and the soil is very retentive of moisture, yet 
the parish is healthy. Its inhabitants are generally vigorous and 
hardy, though spare, and live long, without affording many in- 
stances of extreme longevity. Agues by the recent drainage of 
the marshes seem to be altogether removed. Fevers, except scar- 
latina among children, are rare. Measles are seldom fatal ; and 
universal vaccination appears to have altogether banished small- 
pox. Consumption at the age of from eighteen to twenty-two is 
rather frequent. Of late, cancers have been common, cutting off 
at least one victim yearly. The chief complaint of more advan- 
ced age is failure of digestion, owing, perhaps, partly to the na- 
ture of the climate, but mostly to the almost exclusive use of ve- 
getable food, the large quantity of which necessary for support 
being easily discussed in the days of vigorous youth, but proving 
burdensome to the organs when their powers become less active. 

Hydrography. — There is abundance of spring water in the pa- 
rish, except in the northern extremity. There are several very 
strong chalybeates. 

The River Spey separates the parish from Rothes on the west, 



BOHARM. 35y 



from the influx of the Fiddich, near the bridge of Craigellachie, 
down to Ordequish, about a mile above the village of Fochabers, 
the small peninsula excepted, which has been already noticed as 
annexed to Rothes, though on the Boharm side, and, excepting 
also two trifling haughs of this parish, which are on the Rothes 
side. This rapid, large, and turbulent stream, rising in Lochaber, 
holds for about ninety miles a direction due south-east, till it 
strikes upon the abutments of Benagen at the south-west angle of 
this parish, when it is turned due north for the rest of its course, 
about sixteen miles, to the Moray Frith, at Garmach. It is strict- 
ly a mountain stream, sometimes falling very low, and often very 
suddenly rising in mighty floods, provincially spates, which, on va- 
rious occasions within memory, have been so large as to fill the 
whole bottom of the valley nearly a mile in breadth with resist- 
less torrents, most destructive to property, and even fatal to life. 
The flood of 1829, so well chronicled by'Sir Thomas Dick Lau- 
der, will not soon be forgotten on the banks of the Spey. The 
river is generally so large in autumn, winter, and spring, as in these 
seasons to permit the fir timber of the forests of Rothiemurcus, 
Abernelhy, Invereshie, &amp;c. to be floated down in immense rafts to 
the various timber yards on the bank, and to the sea at Garmach. 

The Fiddich, which, descending throughthe lovely vale of Bal- 
veny in Mortlach, skirts this parish on the'south and south-west, 
is a stream of considerable magnitude, beautifully wooded, but' 
like the Spey, is subject to very destructive floods. The rivulet 
Aldernie, already mentioned, conveys to the Fiddich the collected 
waters of the upper part of the parish, while those of the lower 
part, uniting where the eastern valley meets with the circular val- 
ley, form the " OrchiU," now the burn of Mulben, which thence 
descendmg very rapidly to the Spey, which it joins at the place 
called Boat of Bridge, has cut a very romantic channel for itself 
in the rocks through which it passes. 

GeologJ.~k\oxg the south boundary of the parish, in the val- 
ley of the Fiddich, and a little distance backward to the hill 
gneiss is everywhere to be seen. Northward from this, for more 
than two-thirds of the length of the circular valley, and up to the 
summits of the hills, talc slate, dipping to the south, and with a 
direction north-east, is the prevailing rock ; it might be called the 
universal rock, except that it is traversed by frequent veins of 
quartz, and by a narrow vein of primitive limestone, which sets off 



060 



BANFFSHIRE. 



near Keith from the great limestone formation of Banffshire, and, 
passing entire through a considerable length of the parish, finally 
loses itself in a number of small veins, as it approaches the gneiss 
on the south-west. On the authority of Dr Forbes, it may be 
stated, that, where the talc slate is penetrated by the quartz veins, 
Kyanite has been frequently found. The limestone is quarried in 
many places, both for calcination, and for building stone. As a 
cement it is peculiarly valuable, particularly for hardening speedi- 
ly under water, as it contains 30 per cent, of silex. This admix- 
ture, however, renders it somewhat less valuable as a manure. 

Before this talc rock disappears in the lower part of the valley, 
mica slate is seen alternating with it ; and where the talc, at the 
junction of the eastern valley, meets with a formation of quartzy 
sandstone, and alternates with this, its colour is changed to pure 
white, and in consistence it becomes extremely soft and unctuous ; 
so that, in fact, the people in the neighbourhood use it for paint- 
ing their cottages and furniture. 

The rocks of the valley of the Spey are gneiss and quartz, hav- 
ino" also a north-east direction, and in the lower part of this pa- 
rish, when once they pass the deep chasm of the Orchil, form- 
ing the lower part of the circular valley, these pass under an 
immense deposit of red clay and gravel, which forms the whole 
extensive table-land lying above Fochabers. On the south 
edge, along the chasm of the Orchil, this deposit is skirted by 
beds of pure white sand, in layers, in some places horizontal, 
in others inclined, and again in other places curiously contorted, 
over which beds the red gravel looks as if it had been poured, fol- 
lowing all their contortions and sinuosities. The sand is discover- 
ed by the action of the burn or other causes removing the over- 
lapping deposit. Proceeding northward and eastward, the depth 
of this red stuff becomes exceedingly great. The Spey has cut 
in upon the west side of it, opposite to Orton House, and formed 
cliffs of great height, the change of whose colour, from bright red 
to dark crimson, is a sure prognostic of rain. The brooks which 
drain off the moisture from the table-land have formed many ra- 
vines almost perpendicular in the sides, and in many instances 
from 50 to 100 feet deep. Nay, it is not uncommon, where a 
ditch has been cut, or the surface otherwise removed, to find a 
new ravine formed of great depth in the course of one day by the 
first heavy rains. Towards the bottom of these ravines, the sides, 



nOHAU.M. 



301 



befjre long exposure to the nir, are iiard and compact, having 
much the appearance of breccia traversed by horizontal layers of 
•solt sandstone. After some exposure, they become soft. The 
breccia-like substance is reduced to clay and gravel, and the sand- 
stone to sand, ready to be swept away by the next rain. The 
bright crimson colour of the torrents poured through these ravines 
into the Spey has often attracted observation. They are absolutely 
like torrents of blood. On this table-land no springs rise, except 
at its edges, to which of course cultivation is confined; while the 
rest of it, except where planted, for which it is all admirably adapt- 
ed, remains a barren waste. 

Further to the east, and forming the north-eastern side of the 
lateral valley, are the round hills of Muldeary, the western slope 
of which is in this parish composed of the same red clav and gra- 
vel; abounding here, however, both superficially and in the Lb- 
soil, with large boulders of granite and hornblende. These, in 
some places, are so numerous as to cover the surface, and totally 
prevent cultivation. They afford building stone of the best qualil 
ty, and are extensively used in this way. 

Zoolo/.~Red.deer frequently visit the parish, chiefly in their 
passage from the forests of the interior to the coast, or as ma- 
rauders from the park of Gordon Castle. Roe-deer are pretty 
numerous. Hares are most abundant everywhere, and rabbits on 
the river side. Foxes, polecats, weasels, notwithstanding the ex- 
ertions of the game-keepers for their destruction, are also nume- 
rous. Badgers are not rare. Otters, once very numerous, still 
frequent the rocks of the Orchil, and the margin of the river 
A hedgehog, the only one ever seen here, was lately found on 
the river bank. Rats are a perfect nuisance, and, of late, the 
large grey rat has found its way from the coast. Water-rats with 
round heads and short tails, are numerous, burrowing in embank- 
ments and the sides of mill ponds. Hawks of various kinds are 
very p entilu , and a few ravens may be seen, which have their 
domicile in the rocks of Benagen. Rock pigeons are numerous 
in the glen of the Orchil, and wood pigeons in all the plantations. 
Rooks visit the parish in large flocks, chiefly from the woods of 
Cordon Castle and Balveny. The common crow makes also a 
frequent appearance. Owls, both common and horned, are nu 
merous, and there are the usual abundance and variety of smaller 
birds. Grouse are plentiful on Benagen and the bounding hlls 



062 nANKt'SHlRE. 

Partridges are abundant. Black-game is to be found, and wood- 
cocks are numerous in the early part of winter, or end of autumn. 
At Arndilly, these have occasionally remained throughout the 
year, nestling and bringing out their young. A few plovers, 
snipes, and curlews frequent a large moss in the lower end of the 
parish, and the few remaining swamps, where also the bittern 
has been heard and seen. 

'J'here is nothing peculiar in the breeds of the domestic cattle. 
The black-cattle are chiefly Highland or Aberdeenshire. The 
few sheep are Leicesters, on the arable grounds, and Lintons on 
the skirts of the hills. There are no goats. The brooks have 
all a good store of common trout. The river here abounds with 
salmo'n in close time, and would naturally abound with them 
throughout the year, as it did of old ; but, during the fishing sea- 
son, the labours of the fishermen, in the lower part of its course, 
are now so indefatigable, and the operation of the cruive dike, si- 
tuated just at the lower extremity of the parish, is now so perfect 
as a barrier, that comparatively very few fish get up even so far 
as the fishing grounds here ; and the fishery rent of the parish, 
and of Rothes, has, instead of rising in proportion to the greatly 
increased value of the commodity, dwindled to a mere trifle. 
When the water is low, even the Sunday's slap is said to be of 
little use for the run of the fish, owing to the construction of the 
dike, and there is a tolerable supply here only when a flood has 
overtopped the dike, or caused a breach in it, and has in some 
deo-ree interrupted the fishing below. There is generally, how- 
ever, a sufficient number of fish to aff'ord excellent sport to the 
angler. White or sea-trout, and finnocks, are at certain seasons 
very abundant. 

}foods. A noble forest, chiefly planted by operations of various 

dates, extends on the estate of Arndilly, to a length of from seven 
to eio-ht miles, along the banks of the Fiddich and Spey, and 
stretches far back from these streams up on the slopes, and into 
the recesses of Benagen. The plantations here consist of Scotch 
fir larch, spruce, and various hard-woods. There is a consider- 
able intermixture of natural hard-wood, birch, geen, alder, ash, 
mountain-ash, and oak, in the lower parts, near the Spey, and a 
considerable breadth of natural Scotch fir, spreading from the 
plantations towards the top of the hill. Everywhere, in the valley 
of the Spey, and at Arndilly as much as anywhere, the Scotch 



BOH ARM. 



383 



tir seems to rejoice in the soil and climate, and soon becomes 
very valuable, and the spread of it here seems likely, at no distant 
date, if the ground be properly protected from sheep and cattle, 
to cover the whole western face of Benagen, even to the summit, 
and make it, indeed, a fine object in the scenery of the country. 
The larch, here, too, thrives admirably, as indeed does every spe- 
cies of wood usually grown in Scotland. There are three beecli 
trees in the garden of great size. One of them presents a noble 
pillar in its stem, 17 feet high from the ground, clear of branches, 
and of a uniform circumference of 1 1 feet 8 inches, for the whole 
of this height. A sweet chestnut, also in the garden, has a stem 
of 13 feet long, and 12 feet round. A birch, near the house, 
has a circumference of 7 feet, at six feet from the ground. 

Further down the river, on the estate of Cairnty, in the angle 
between the Orchil and the Spey, natural oak and birch cover a 
considerable extent, and the glen of the Orchil, and the lateral 
ravines, are thickets of birch. Were this glen inclosed, and 
planted with oak, &amp;c., it would, at very little loss to the tenants 
of the pasture, soon become of immense value to the proprietor. 
Here, too, some plantations of Scotch fir and larch were made 
about thirty years ago, along the river, which have of late been 
largely augmented, all in the most thriving state. 

In the valley of Boharm, there is, in the upper end, a consider- 
able quantity of natural birch, alder, mountain-ash, and geen, 
among which, the late proprietor intermixed a krge quantity of 
ash and elm, which have thriven excellently ; and lower down 
Mr Steuart of Auchlunkart has around his mansion-house a 
most ornamental plantation, of upwards of eighty Scotch acres of 
liard wood, with a proportion of larches and spruces, which are 
gradually thinned out. Ash, oak, elm, beech, &amp;c. &amp;c. thrive 
here remarkably well, and have already got up to be trees of con- 
siderable size, where, only thirty- five years ago, there was little 
besides rows of ash and plane-tree round the old garden. Mr Steu- 
art has, however, taken great pains with this plantation, great part 
of the ground having been trenched for it, limed, and sown out with 
natural grasses. Mr Steuart has also planted, on his hills and moors, 
in this parish, to the extent of 300 Scotch acres and upwards, Scotch 
fir, and larches, greatly to the ornament of the country. The Scotch 
fir here does not thrive so well as on Spey-side, and it is gradually 
thinned out to give room for the larches, which get on admirablv.

Opposite to Aiichluiikart, on the Seafield estate, a large planta- 
tion has recently been made out, on the lower end of the Benagon 
range, which already shews well. The summits of the Muldeary 
hills were planted many years ago with Scotch fir. They look 
well at a distance, but the wood has come to little size, and re- 
quires to be filled up with hard-wood and larch. 

II. — Civil History. 

The earliest account that the reporter is acquainted with, both 
of the parish of Boharm and the suppressed parish of Dundurcos, 
is in Shaw's History of the Province of Moray. There are no spe- 
cial plans or surveys of the parish. It is possessed by four pro- 
prietors, by whose families their respective estates have been held 
for several generations. William Grant M'Dowal, Esq. has the up- 
per part, consisting of Arndilly, Easter and Wester Gauldwell, 
Newton, and Auchmadies, together with thepeninsula of Aikenway, 
in Rothes, already mentioned, all lying contiguous in a rich, com- 
pact, and beautiful estate. Next, downwards, John Duff, Esq. of 
Drummuir, has the farm of Knockan, which unites with his ex- 
tensive possessions in Botriphney. Patrick Stewart, Esq., has 
the. barony of Auchlunkart, in the middle of the parish, and the 
Earl of Seafield has the lower end of it, comprising the lauds of 
Balnabriech, Mulben, Muldeary, Cairnty, and Forgie. 

Parochial Begisters. — The parochial registers commence in 
J636, and, except in the times of Charles H. and his successor, 
and another break, from 1784 to 1800, the session record is very 
full and complete. The registers of baptisms and marriages, 
however, are defective before 1800, and there is no register of 
deaths. 

Antiquities. — A stone, which was in the wall of the old church 
at Arndilly, is now built into the wall of one of the wings of the 
mansion-house. It has rude figures carved on it. As the re- 
porter has seen another stone, and has heard of a third, having 
very nearly the same figures upon them, the former having been 
taken out of the foundation of the old church of Inveravon, and 
the latter being built into the wall of the abbey of Deer, he has 
sometimes thought that they may be Druidical memorials, and in- 
dicate that our forefathers fixed their first Christian temples on the 
sites of Druidical worship. 

The Castle of Bucharin, now Galval, is an interesting remain, 
situated on a fine eminence between the brook Aldernie and the 
Fiddich, having the vale of Balveny stretching out in front ; the 



BOIIAKM. 

vale of Boharm to the east; the lower part of the valley of the 
Fiddich to the west ; and a great extent of well cultivated fields 
and beautiful woodlands all around. Little of the building is now 
standing. The former Account states, that, by some excavation 
among the ruins, some silver spoons apostle spoons were found, 
with round hollow handles, and the mouth or shell completely cir- 
cular. What became of these relics, the present reporter could 
never ascertain. Under a stone in the tloor of the oratory of the 
castle, a silver ring was lately found, having a small shield fixed 
upon it, which exhibited two martial figures. This is now at 
Arndilly. 

Both record and tradition inform us, that, in very early times, 
there was a bridge over the Spey, near the influx of the Orchil 
It appears to have been chiefly of wood, and calculated only for 
the passage of pedestrians and horses. Where tradition says it 
crossed the river, the water is very deep close to the rock on the 
east side, which served for one of the abutments ; but this great 
depth extends but a little way out from the rock, and then the 
stream shallows to the western bank. Hence one long stretch, 
not beyond the powers of the largest timber of the coun'try would 
suffice for getting over the deeper water, and then the progress 
westward would be comparatively easy by means of supports from 
the bottom; and such, according to tradition, was the nature of 
the structure. If liable to injury by a flood, or to decay by time 
It could be easily repaired or replaced by the funds allocated fo 
the purpose. This bridge was, for many ages, the only passage 
of the kmd across this large, rapid, and dangerous river, and must 
have been of great consequence to the whole of the north Its 
first erection has been ascribed to the Romans in their progress 
under Severus, and it is known to have been in existence after the 
Keformation. It is conjectured that the Reformation havino- ter- 
minated the religious establishment connected with it to be After- 
wards mentioned, the bridge thus deprived of means for repair or 
restoration yielded to decay soon thereafter, or was finally swept 
away by a flood. Not a vestige of its ruins has been visible for 
many years. A ferry-boat was substituted for it, and the passage 
of the river, still very important, came to be called by the anoma- 
ous name of - the boat of bridge," while the farms in the neiVh- 
bourhood still retained their former appellations of Bridoetown of 
bpey and Upper Briglands. After a lapse of about 250 ye irs 
the boat has, m its turn, given place to another bridge, which wis 



3G BANFK.«HIUE. 

erected a few years ago at the same spot, at the expense of the 
Honourable Colonel Grant for the Earl of Seafield, Richard 
Wharton Duff, Esq. of Orton, and Patrick Steuart, Esq. of 
Auchlunkart, and chiefly in consequence of the exertions of 
this latter gentleman. It is on the suspension principle, on a 
plan by Captain Brown, and cost about L.3500. Its span is 235 
feet. The towers are lofty structures, of ashlar granite. The 
toll-house, of polished freestone, is remarkably handsome. Un- 
der the authority of the Banffshire Turnpike Act, a very moderate 
pontage is exacted, little more than sufficient to keep the bridge 
in repair ; but the gentlemen who have so liberally stepped for- 
ward with the funds for it will eventually be well repaid, by the 
increased value of the land on both sides of the river. Since the 
erection of the bridge of Fochabers, six miles below, and Craigel- 
lachie, six miles above, the passage of the river here is not of such 
general importance as it once was ; but the accommodation af- 
forded by this bridge to the public is still very great, and to the 
districts in the neighbourhood it is invaluable. 

Connected with the ancient structure, and on the Boharm side 
of the river, there was a religious establishment called " the Hos- 
tital of St Nicholas at the Bridge of Spey." This seems to have 
derived its origin from a gift of « Muriel de Pollock, heiress of 
Rothes, in the beginning of the thirteenth century, of her estate 
of Inverorkil," where the bridge was built, " to God, the Vir- 
gin, and St Nicholas, in pure alms, for the support of a house 
there for the reception of poor passengers." See Shaw in loco, 
and Appendix, No. 2. Shaw gives also, from the Chartulary of 
Moray, the deeds by which Andrew Bishop of Moray, about the 
same time, granted to this hospital the church of Rothes with its 
pertinents, and by which Alexander II., a. d. 1232, granted a pro- 
vision for a chaplain here. Shaw also mentions a grant to the 
hospital of the lands of Aikenway by Walterus de Moravia. 

The ruins of the buildings of this establishment remained in 
considerable extent, till cleared away for the approach to the pre- 
sent bridge, when many human bones were disinterred ; but no 
other article of curiosity. It is presumed, that, at the Reforma- 
tion, the lands were resumed by the heirs of the original donors, 
or taken possession of by the neighbouring proprietors. 

Modern Buildings.— modern buildings there is nothing worth 
notice but the bridge just mentioned, and the mansion-houses of 
Arndilly and Auchtunkart. The former is chiefly remarkable for 



BOHARM. 367 

Its noble situation on the bank of the Spey, in a recess of Benagen, 
which rises steep on three sides crowned with wood, having the river 
in front spreading out into a broad pool, with the fine plains and ris- 
ing woodlands of Rothes on the opposite bank, and the lofty Bel- 
innes closing the prospect at five or six miles distance. Auch- 
lunkart House is a most commodious mansion, on the plea- 
sant bank of a brook, in the middle of the plantations already 
mentioned. A Grecian colonnade ornaments the front, and adds 
to ornament the important utility of a covered portico. A conser- 
vatory in the same style gives its very tasteful decoration to the 
south front, and communicates with the drawing-room. 

There are three meal-mills, each with a drying-kiln ; three saw- 
mills, two of them fitted up with circular saws ; ten threshing-mills, 
half of which are driven by water, and the rest by horses.

The whole population is rural. So far as can be ascertained 
there has been little change upon its numbers, for many years past. 
Towards the end of last century, it was somewhat diminished by 
the enlargement of farms, but this has been since more than com- 
pensated by the increase of cottages along the new lines of road 
and by the settlement of crofters in the wastes. During the nre'

There are no other inhabitants of independent fortune. 

The people are very intelligent, thrifty, and good bargain mak- 
ers. Considering the distance of many from church, they attend 
public worship with commendable regularity. The lower orders 
have certainly much improved in morality since the suppression oi

great facilities. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture.—ln consequence of the want of any thing like a 
complete plan of the extensive estate of Arndilly, it has been 
found impossible to give the full table of extents required under 
this head. From such plans as there are of detached portions ot 
that estate, and from the information furnished by the proprietor 
and tenants, the extent of the arable ground upon it, deducting the 
portion in the parish of Rothes, the rate of rent per arable acre, 
and the extent of improveable ground have been ascertained in a 
tolerably close approximation to the truth, and are so added in 
the table below to these particulars, as exhibited on the plans of 
the other properties in the parish. But of the large number of 
acres under wood, in green pasture, and in heath upon Arndilly, 
the information obtained is quite insufficient for an accurate state ; 
and hence the parochial extents of these cannot be given.

Servants.— Servantii are engaged universally for the half year, 
from 26th May to 22d November, and from 22d November to 
26th May, except what additional troops are required in harvest, 
who are engaged for whatever time the harvest may last. The 
men servants, v»hether married or single, as well as the women 
servants, always live in the families of their employers, those that 
are married renting houses either in the neighbourhood, or in the 
nearest village for their wives and families. It would perhaps be 
a considerable improvement, if there were more married men ser- 
vants, and these placed in cottages upon the farms. One great 
evil of the present system is the constant recurrence of trouble 
and expense to the masters, and the danger of dissipation to the 
servants, in making new engagements at the feeing markets at the 
end of every half year. 

Labourers.— Much farm-work, cutting and filling drains, clear- 
ing ditches, turning dung, &amp;c. is done by contract with labourers. 
Sometimes hay is cut by contract per acre, and more rarely grain. 
The labourers have generally abundance of employment. 

iartTsfzw//.— Comparatively little of the cutting in harvest is 
now done by the sickle, the use of which has been for the most 
part superseded by the scythe. Each mode has its advantages. 
The shearing is the neatest work, and more conservative of the 
grain, but the scything is cheaper as to work, speedier as to time, 
and more bountiful of fodder. It also admits of earher stacking, 
a point of great consequence in such a climate, and if the people 
are tolerably expert in the use of the instrument, and in the ope- 
ration of gathering the sheaf after it, it makes much neater work 
than any one would imagine who has not seen it in employment. 
The difference of expense per Scotch acre, between cutting by 
the sickle and by the scythe, may be reckoned as between 10s. 
and 5s. 6d. An evil consequence of the general employment of 
the scythe is, that it has interfered most materially with the har- 
vest gains of the aged and infirm, who are now almost wholly ba- 
nished from the fields. It may be here mentioned, that Mr 
Stewart of Auchlunkart having lately introduced the short-handled 
scvthe for cutting the grass in his plantations, the servants and 
labourers all around have already miiversally adopted it, and a 
long-handled scythe is now nowhere to be seen in this quarter. 
The workmen say, that, with the short- handled instrument, they 
can cut about one-sixth more per day, and this with less fatigue 
to themselves.

Hordes. — Horses of suitable size and strength are kept in the 
proportion of a pair for every thirty-five Scotch acres, and the 
parish rears nearly as many as suffice for its supply. 

Cattle and Sheep. — The black-cattle are rather of a small size, 
which there have been few attempts to raise, as it is found very 
suitable to the climate and pasture. 

The stots and spare queys are generally sold off, when about 
three years old, in the summer markets of the neighbourhood, 
and, at that age, the stots are in great request for winterers in 
the feeding districts. The soil, for the most part, not being pro- 
ductive of heavy crops of turnips, and the markets for fat'cattic 
being rather distant, what turnips are raised are chiefly given to 
the milk cows and rising stock, and are seldom applied to" fattening 
for the butcher, except on some of the larger farms. 

Sheep, as before stated, are few in number, not above 400 iti 
all ; about the half of these are Lintons, kept on the skirts of tlie 
hills ; another hundred are also Lintons, kept on old grass bv the 
two resident heritors for the supply of their own tables ; and the 
remainder are of the large English breed, kept on the farms 
chiefly for the sake of their wool. 

Swine.— 'me are kept in considerable numbers. The breeding 
stocks are maintained at the corn-mills, and at a few of the laraer 
farms. Two feedmg pigs, at least, are kept at every farm-steadino-, 
and one or two at each of the cottages. These are fed for six or 
eight months, till they attain about the weight of six stones each, 
when they are sold to the curers in the neighbouring town of 
Keith for exportation to London. Even at the present low prices, 
a large sum of money is thus brought into the parish 

P./ry._Common barn-door fowls and ducks are numerous 
at every dwelling, but there are few turkeys or geese, except at 
he barn-yards of the mansion-houses. The eggs of the common 
fowls are bought up by the country merchants, and exported to 
tl.e London market, along with the spare butter from the dairies. 
Eggs alone bring in a sum of about L.500 

System of Husbandry. -The prevailing system of husbandry is 
a six-course shift. The grass ground is broken up for oats : a se- 
cond crop IS taken which is called the awald or one-fold crop; 
then the field is fallowed,~a naked fallow, dunged in sprinL 
where the land is wet,-turnips and potatoes, wifh occasiona t; 
some tares, where it is tolerably dry. Barlev or oats are sown 
the fourth year with grass seeds. From half die extent o: 



372 BANFFSHIRE. 

out, hay is made the fifth year, and the other half is either cut 
green for house-feeding, or depastured by the horses and cows. 
The sixth year is always pasture. Taking all circumstances of 
soil, situation, climate, and extra pasture into account, this is per- 
haps as good a rotation as could be adopted ; though another year 
in pasture, particularly on the lighter soils, or rather a proportion 
of these devoted to permanent pasture, might seem an improve- 
ment. In some few instances, the five-course shift has been in- 
troduced, taking only one crop of oats at the commencement, but 
this rotation is not a favourite, and, indeed, the soil being gene- 
rally a stiff moist clay, the second crop of oats is always the more 
productive. Of late, wheat has been attempted on part of the 
best ground, in consequence of the very low price of oats, bemg 
substituted for the oats after ley, which is top-dressed for it, 
or for the barley after potatoes or bare fallow ; but though it has 
hitherto paid well, it is, unquestionably, an unsuitable and preca- 
rious crop for such a climate. The soil is well adapted for lint, 
but it is not considered a remunerating crop ; a small patch, how- 
ever, is almost always sown on each farm for domestic purposes. 
Tares were, a few years ago, introduced for part of the fallow or 
green crop, to be cut green for the horses, and a small portion 
of them for this purpose is now sown on the greater number of 
the farms. The production of turnips is greatly on the increase, 
in consequence of the use of bone-manure, introduced since 1829, 
but very sparingly used till 1833, when the palpable success of 
the few original experimenters led to its more general application. 
It bids fair in a few years, if the supply can be continued at its 
present cost, of about 2s. 9d. per bushel, to become the universal 
manure for turnips, and to banish bare fallow altogether, except 
in very wet fields. At first, the bones were applied in large quan- 
tities, to serve instead of the farm dung for the rotation, and this 
is still the case in some instances, about thirty bushels being thus 
given to the Scots acre, strewed in the bottom of the turnip drills ; 
but what is now the more common practice, is to dibble in the 
bones upon the top of the drills, in holes about eight inches 
asunder, giving only from eight to ten bushels per acre, which is 
found quite sufficient to raise the turnip crop, and then, in the 
following spring, the farm manure saved from the turnips is given 
to the barley and grass seeds, much to the improvement of the 
barley and hay crops, and at a very trifling increase of expense. 
In either way, the stock of manure is greatly enlarged, and the 

6 



BOllARM. 



373 



advantage is very considerable. Within these few years, a farmer 
from Aberdeenshire has introduced the practice now followed by 
some others, of growing turnip seeds on a large scale ; the turnips 
are transplanted into the field for green crop ; this practice is 
troublesome and expensive, but is said to pay well. Oats are un - 
questionably the staple grain. They are raised of excellent qua- 
lity, while the barley and the small produce of wheat are generally 
inferior. The value of the oat-straw, too, for fodder, where so 
much depends upon cattle, is so much more, as to be held to 
compensate even for the present inferiority of the price of the 
grain. They are driven in large quantities to the various har- 
bours on the coast, about ten or twelve miles distant from the 
centre of the parish, for exportation to London and Leith, and a 
considerable quantity is sent to the Elgin district for meal. The 
little quantity of wheat is sold at Elgin, and barley finds a ready 
market at the various distilleries, of which there are four in the 
neighbourhood of Craigellachie, and two at Keith. 

Lime brought from the large calcining establishments in the 
parishes of Keith and Mortlach, or calcined from the lime rock 
within the parish, is abundantly applied as manure, and is consi- 
dered essential to successful husbandry. On the old arable ground, 
known to have been limed before, a fresh dose, of about thirty 
provincial bolls of shells, equal to ninety-six bushels imperial, and 
producing, of powdered lime, 240 bushels, is given to each acre 
once in every currency of a lease of nineteen years, and as near 
as possible to the commencement of the lease. On ground newly 
taken in from the waste, as much as 400 bushels imperial of pow- 
dered lime is given, and on old arable, not limed before, the first 
application is about 320 bushels imperial. On the arable fields, 
it is commonly applied during the process of fallowing, or along 
with the grass seeds. On newly improved lands, it is given before 
they are put under their first crop. The price per provincial boll 
of shells is about Is. 6d. 

The farm-buildings have of late been much improved both in 
appearance and accommodation, particularly on the property of 
Auchlunkart ; but, in too many instances, they are still mean and 
Uiconvenient. There are few permanent enclosures either by 
stone-dikes or hedges, except in the neighbourhood of the mau 
sion houses, and more would be very desirable, as leading to lonoer 
continuance of the dry Helds in pasture ; but the want is less kit, 
that wood is so abundant and cheap for paling, the use of which 
for temporary enclosures, is very common. 



374 BANFKSHIUE. 

In this parish, the spirit of improvement awakened, about forty 
years ago, by David M'Dowal Grant, Esq., husband of the late 
proprietrix of Arndilly, and much encouraged by him during the 
continuance of his connection with the property, has since accom- 
phshed much, particularly since 1808, when the country was open- 
ed by turnpike roads. Patrick Steuart, Esq. of Auchlunkart 
commenced a very spirited course as an improver soon after his 
succession to the estate in 1800, and has since persevered with 
most praiseworthy energy and most profitable success. A consi- 
derable deal has also been done on the Seafield property, and 
much is in immediate contemplation. Throughout the parish, 
the old arable fields have been much dried by ditches and drains, 
and, having been freed of unsightly baulks and bogs, have been 
properly laid together, limed, and brought under a regular rota- 
tion. The swampy bottoms of the valleys have been drained, and 
are now almost entirely converted into productive lands, and many 
acres of moor ground have been reclaimed, partly by the plough, 
and partly by trenching, which is considered the preferable mode, 
and is found, on the whole, not more expensive. 

In such a report as this, the fact surely deserves a place, that 
Mr Steuart, succeeding to an arable extent in this parish of 812 
Scotch acres, has, besides all his plantations already noticed, ad- 
ded to that extent, either by his own direct operations or by his 
tenantry, the extent of 300 Scotch acres, and has 120 more, at 
this present time, in course of improvement ; so that, in the course 
of two or three years hence, the total number of arable Scotch 
acres on the estate of Auchlunkart in this parish will be advanced 
from 812 to 1232. Mr Steuart has been equally energetic and 
successful in the other parishes into which his property extends.

V. — Parochial Economy. 

There is no market-town or village. Keith, at the distance of 
SIX miles east from the centre of the parish, is the nearest market- 
town, and the village of Rothes is about the same distance in the 
opposite direction. Fochabers, close to the lower extremity, is 
about seven miles from the church, and Dufftown of Mortlach, 
and Charlestown of Aberlour, near the upper extremity, are each 
about eight miles from the centre. Elgin is thirteen miles distant. 

A daily post passes through the parish on the route from Keith 
to Craigellachie, and there is a sub-office near the centre. One 
line of turnpike road, admirably formed and kept, passes from 
Keith to the suspension bridge, opening communication thence to 
Elgin, Rothes, Garmach, &amp;c. The length of this road within the 
parish is four and a half miles. Another line of turnpike, called 
the Boharm road, branches off from the Great North Road half- 
way between Keith and Fochabers, and passes up the valley till 
near the upper end, where it divides into two branches, one lead- 
ing to Mortlach, and the other to Aberlour, Grantown, &amp;c. with 
an offset to the bridge of Craigellachie. The length of this road, 
including the branch to Mortlach, is, within this parish, about 
twelve miles. This road is in a state of great disrepair, and one 
of the bridges, destroyed by the flood of 1829, has not been 
replaced, so that for two or three years no tolls have been exigible 
on the line. This is understood to be owing to some dispute 
among the trustees about a debt contracted for the original for- 
mation of the road. It is much to be wished that this matter were 

agricultural produce of the parish, are the results of much and very careful inquirv 
and observation, and are as follows, viz. that of the 3761 Scotch arable acres con

speedily settled, that the road might be again put in proper con- 
dition, for not only is the disrepair inconvenient already, especially 
in winter, but it is always increasing, and must soon terminate iii 
the complete ruin of the present roadway on one of the most im- 
portant lines in the county. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church is situated as nearly as possi- 
ble in the centre of the parish. It stands on the boundary line 
between the old parish and the annexation from Dundurcos, — the 
decreet of suppression and annexation having provided for a new 
church and manse in this situation. It was built in 1793, and is in 
good repair. It affords accommodation for about 700. There are, 
strictly speaking, no free sittings, the whole sittings being divided 
among the farms, and annexed to them ; but there are no seat- 
rents, and all are well accommodated, in consequence of all hold- 
ing some land, a farm, a croft, or a kail-yard. Though the church 
is situated as conveniently for the general body of the people as 
perhaps it could be, yet, in a parish of such length, and where the 
population is so scattered, one church cannot be convenient for 
all, while the numbers of those most inconvenienced are so few in 
their respective localities as to prevent all idea of remedying the 
evil by additional churches within the parish. One or two of these 
remote districts might be accommodated by churches or preach- 
ing-stations erected in similar detached corners of the adjoining 
parishes, by combining them with which suitable congregations 
might be formed. 

The manse was built in 1811. It is large, but very far from 
commodious. Though built in a very damp situation, which must 
soon impair it, it is still in pretty good condition, having received 
some trifling repairs in 1818. 

The glebe is about 28 Scotch acres in extent, of which 18 were 
arable at the time of the designation, poor thin land ; and the rest 
have been improved at an enormous expense by the late and pre- 
sent incumbents. It was given at the time when the church was 
removed, in excambion for the old glebe of eleven acres, which 
now rents at L.14. The present glebe would perhaps let for L.25 
or L.30 ; but this increase of glebe value is but a poor compensa- 
tion for the outlay which has produced it. 

The stipend is, by surrender of teinds in 1817, L.168, — 55 b. 1 p. 
2l. oatmeal, and 28| bolls barley payable in kind, and 11 bulls 
victual, i. e. half meal half barley, payable by the county tiars, 
without any seiarate allowance for communion elements.

There is no chapel of ease, Government church, or Dissenting 
meeting-house of" any description. All the parishioners, except 
ahout 20, belong to the Established Church, and the Episcopa- 
lian part of the exception, amounting to one-half of it, attend wor- 
ship generally in the parish church. The other half of the excep- 
tion consists of one family of Roman Catholics, 5 in number, and 
5 Seceders, who worship at Fochabers or Keith. 

Divine service in the church is generally well attended, always 
so when the state of the weather and roads allows the more distant 
parishioners to walk so far. The average number of communi- 
cants is 510. 

The annual average amount for the past five years of the whole 
collections in church is L.35, of which one collection, averaging 
L.2, is given to some of the Assembly's four Schemes, and one, 
amounting to L.5, is appropriated to a fund for procuring medical 
attendance to the poor at home, or conveying them to that most 
useful charity. Gray's Hospital at Elgin. About L.5, 10s. is re- 
quired to pay the salaries of session-clerk, precentor, and kirk- 
officer, and incidental expenses, and the whole of the rest is paid 
over to the poor's box. 

Education. — There are three schools, besides two sewing schools 
for girls, and two or three dame schools for infants. The parish 
school is situated close to the church in the centre of the parish, 
and one of the other two in each extremity. One of the sewing 
schools is in the upper division, the other in the lower. 

The parish schoolmaster has the maximum salary, the le- 
legal accommodations, and a share of the Dick Bequest. His 
average amount of fees paid is L.I7 per annum. The teacher of 
the school in the lower end has a salary of L.5 from the Earl of 
Seafield. The teacher in the upper end has, from Arndilly, the 
accommodation of a comfortable house and a good garden, but has 
no salary. The sewing school in the lower end is altogether on 
the teacher's own account. The one in the upper end is support- 
ed by a salary of L.5 from the Society for Propagating Christian 
Knowledge, and by an endowment of five bolls of oatmeal, with a 
free house and garden from the family of Arndilly. The fees in 
these subsidiary schools are so much more paid in other articles of 
value than in money, that it is impossible to state their amount. 
The people in general are fully alive to the advantages of educa- 
tion. There are only a few, chiefly aged, persons that cannot write, 
and the instances are rare, indeed, of inability to read. The sub- 



378 



BANFFSIIIllE. 



sidiary schools remedy, in some degree, in their respective dis- 
tricts, the evil of remoteness from the parish school ; but they stand 
greatly in need of better endowments, while there is one district, 
containing seventeen families, so situated as to have no benefit at 
least for its younger children from any of the schools, and it is 
unable to maintain a school within its own bounds. 

Literature. — There is one parochial library, managed by a com- 
mittee of subscribers, containing a tolerable collection of useful 
and interesting books, and likely to prosper. 

Institutions.— There is a parish saving bank, which was insti- 
tuted in the year 1821, under the management of the minister as 
cashier, the schoolmaster as accountant, and two or three respect- 
able parishioners as trustees or directors. At first the deposits, 
considering the small population and general poverty of the dis- 
trict, were large, till they amounted at length to the sum of 
L.1'200. The diminution of the rate of interest some years ago 
considerably checked the spirit of depositing, and still operates 
against accumulation; but the capital still amounts to L.IOOO, 
having, for the last three or four years, been neither increased nor 
diminished, the amount of deposits and accumulating interests on 
the one hand just balancing drafts and uppayments on the other, 
each being about L.200 per annum. When an account rises to 
L.25 it is paid up ; and there are instances of the same individual 
having been twice paid up in this way. The depositors are chiefly 
farm servants, unmarried aged females, and parents for small pro- 
visions to their children. The institution has been and still is 
most beneficial both to the temporal interests and the moral wel- 
fare of the people. The proprietors could not lay out money to 
better account, for their own eventual benefit, as well as for the 
good of their tenantry, than by giving a little to foster savings 
banks in connection with their estates, by enabling their managers 
to pay a more tempting rate of interest than can be done without 
such aid. 

Poor. — The average number of poor on the regular roll is 21, 
of whom an average of two being bedrid or infirm, receive the value 
of a peck of meal,'and Is. 3d., in all about 2s. 6d. per week, and the 
remaining nineteen receive about 5s. each, at each of four distribu- 
tions in the year, besides occasional supplies when necessary. Be- 
sides this, there is what is called the occasional roll, containing on 
an average the names of 12 poor people, who receive, as the 
money may be spared among them, about 10s. each yearly. Func-

ral expenses for those on the regular roll are allowed at the rate of 
L.l each. Females of the poorer class advanced in years, or other- 
wise disabled from earning their subsistence, form now unquestion- 
ably the most destitute portion of the rural population, as the rate 
of pay for spinning flax by the hand-wheel, on which such persons 
used formerly to depend, has been reduced by the competition of 
machinery so low, that its remuneration for the most sedulous in- 
dustry is insufficient for the barest subsistence, and thus there is 
little temptation for engaging in the work. For the benefit of 
such females, the reporter some years ago suggested, and still car- 
ries on, a plan which may be here detailed, because not only has 
It been found most beneficial for its object, but its simplicity of 
operation is such that no dread of trouble attending it need pre- 
vent its adoption in other quarters. At the commencement of each 
winter, a small charitable work fund is formed, chiefly by the libe- 
ral donations of Mrs Steuart, Auchlunkart, and a list of some 
fifteen or twenty of the class in question, the most deserving ob- 
jects of a little kindly assistance, is made out. It is intimated to 
these, that if they procure flax for themselves, which they always 
do from some of the country merchants, or in the neighbouring 
towns, and gain the manufacturer's wages for spinning it, they will 
for so many months of the winter be paid an additional sum of 4d. 
for each 8d. so gained, on their application to some one of two or 
three agents of the charity appointed throughout the parish, to 
whom they just produce a certificate from the merchant who has 
received the spun lint back from them, of the amount he has paid 
them in the preceding week or month. This additional payment or 
premium brings up the pay for a week's work to a week's sub- 
sistence, and so supplies the necessary stimulus, so that with very 
little trouble to any body a charity of L.6 is made to enlarge itself 
to L.18, and to carry the happiness and blessings of industry alonff 
with it. '  

Poor's Funds.— The annual average amount of collections paid 
over to the poor's box, is L.22, 10s. ; interest of L.200 lent by the 
kuk treasurer on heritable security, L.8; one-half rent of Bede 
rigs of Dundurcos, 10s.; average amount of income from other 
sources, penalties, donations, &amp;c. L.12; total, L.43. Besides oc- 
casional donations, the heritors, whenever there is an extraordi- 
nary demand, are never backward to supply contributions in propor- 
lon to their respective valued rents, to prevent encroachment on 
the stock of the kirk-session. There is a general reluctance still 



380 



BANFFSHIRE, 



to apply for parochial aid, but from various causes it is gradually 
wearing out. 

Inns, — There are 4 licensed victualling houses or inns. 
Perhaps this number is required on such a length of road, but then 
the whole four are spirit-shops also, and by far the greater part of 
the business is the sale of spirits drunk on the premises. Hence 
each of them is unquestionably a nuisance in its neighbourhood, 
the habitual resort of the profligate, and the seducing tempter of 
the unwary. The best that can be said of them, if they are all 
necessary, is that they are necessary evils. Were the regulations 
of law enforced as to hours, &amp;c. the evils might be somewhat abat- 
ed ; but this cannot be expected in a district so remote from police. 

jPuel. — The general fuel is turf and peat, procured easily in the 
lower part of the parish from an extensive moss, but with great 
difficulty in the middle and upper parts, from mosses on the hills 
almost exhausted. Where, however, turf is scarce, wood is abun- 
dant and cheap. Coals are used by the resident proprietors, and 
partially by the more substantial tenants. They are brought from 
Port-Gordon, on the Banffshire coast, at a medium distance of 
twelve miles, or from Garmach, at the mouth of the Spey, at a 
medium distance of fourteen miles. The price of the imperial 
barrel at the shore is about Is. 4d. and the cartage of a barrel 6d. 
but a large proportion is brought up by the returning carts, which 
have carried down grain for exportation. Where easiest procured, 
the cart load of peats of the size generally taken on the farmer's 
carts, is about Is., exclusive of carriage. In use, this is equal to a 
barrel of coals, but the carriage is more expensive when there is 
oLherwise full employment for the horses. Where turf is more dif- 
ficult to be procured, and of worse quality, the inhabitants would 
in fact pay much less for coals and wood, and be more comfort- 
able with these, but the turf ashes are prized for manure, and the 
expense, which consists in labour alone, is not sufficiently esti- 
mated. 

Drawn vp in 1834. 

Addenda. 

The following addenda bring the foregoing report up to the 
present date. 

1. By the census of 1841, the population of the parish was 
found to have considerably diminished since 1831, being now only 
1261, or 124 less. The causes of this are, an enlargement of 
farms on the Seafield property, the pressure of a series of late 



BOHARM. 



381 



years and bad crops, and an increased disposition for emigration 
to the colonies. 

2. Notwithstanding the unfavourable character of the seasons 
of late, the progress of agricultural improvement has been steadily 
going on. Fu rrow or frequent draining has been introduced, in 
a few instances, with most beneficial effects. Bone manure, not- 
withstanding its greatly increased price, is in almost universal use 
for turnips, greatly enlarging the production of this useful article. 
It is now very often applied along with a small quantity of dung. 
On the Seafield estate, many of the improvements in contempla- 
tion at the date of the report have been executed, and more are 
in progress. The farms have been properly arranged and subdi- 
vided, and some of them substantially enclosed. Several useful 
roads have been made. Drainage has been carried on on a very 
extensive plan, and with most beneficial effects ; and many plan- 
tations have been made, which will soon afford both shelter and 
ornament to the district. 

3. The reporter's plan for supplying the wants of aged females, 
by the medium of their own industry, has lately failed ; not from 
any want of funds, but from the impossibiUty of procuring the 
materials of industry, there being no such thing now as flax given 
out for hand-spinning in this part of the country. This class of 
our poor population are perhaps the most destitute of all, now 
that the domestic manufactures, which used to sustain them, are 
so much superseded ; and their case, for some suitable provision, 
is strongly recommended to the consideration of the charitable. 

4. The incommodiousness of the manse has been wholly reme- 
died by a considerable addition, and a small change of internal 
arrangements, most handsomely granted last year by the heritors 
as a personal favour to the present incumbent, for which he is 
happy to have this public opportunity of recording his thanks. 

5. The deficient bridge, on the Boharm road, has been replaced 
by the Earl of Seafield, and, instead of a temporary wooden bridge 
over the Fiddich, a very handsome structure of stone has been 
erected at an expense of L.450, supplied by the liberality of the 
gentlemen in the neighbourhood. It was opened in the end of 
last year. The road has also received some slight repairs, and is 
kept passable by the several gentlemen through whose properties 
It extends, but it is still in a very bad state, demanding a thorough 
repmr, so as to permit tolls again to be raised for its support

<p>



PRESBYTERY OF STRATHBOGIE, SYNOD OF MORAY. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

'Same. — Aberchirder, the original name of this parish, was, 
no doubt, taken fronfi Sir David Aberkerder, Thane of Aberker- 
der, who hved about the year 1400, and possessed a great part of 
it. He is mentioned as paying revenue to the Bishopric of Mo- 
ray ; his daughter was married to Sir Robert Innes, brother 
to John Innes, for seven years Bishop of Moray previous to 1414. 
The present name is derived from St Marnoch. A well near the 
manse is called the Saint's Well, and another, at no great distance, 
the Lady's Well. There is a village in the parish, contain- 
ing 800 inhabitants, still called Aberchirder. Some say this word 
signifies the mouth or opening of the moss, and that this place was 
so called from its being near the edge of a large moss. 

The Earl of Fife is patron. The right of patronage connected 
with the property of Kinardy was purchased by the late Earl 
James. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish is of very irregular shape. 
It lies along the north bank of the river Doveron for about 6 miles, 
and extends backwards from the river to the distance of 5 or 6 
miles. Some of the extreme points are 8 miles apart. It is 
bounded on the south by the Doveron, on the opposite side of 
which lie the parish of Inverkeithny and part of Rothiemay ; on 
the west, by Rothiemay ; on the north, by Ordiquhill, Boyndie, 
Banff, and Alvah ; and on the east, by Forglen. The superficial 
extent is about 34 square miles. 

Topographical Appearances, S,'c. — The southern parts of the pa- 
rish are beautifully situated, have a fine exposure, and consist of ear- 
ly fertile soil. Some of the haugh ground is superior. There are 
several most delightful spots along the river-side. The Inch line 
on the property of Edward Ellice, Esq. of Ardmellie, is remark- 



• Communicated by the Rev. D. Henry.

able for a variety of very large and beautiful trees. Some larches 
in particular have here attained their largest dimensions. They 
must have been planted about eighty years ago, soon after the 
larch was first introduced into Scotland. The mansion-house on 
this property, occupied by William Stronach, Esq. commands an 
extensive view of the valley of the Doveron. The grounds are 
regularly laid out, and are in the highest state of cultivation. The 
steep-wooded hill of Ardmellie is the highest ground in the pa- 
rish. The manse stands at the foot of it on the bank of the river, 
at the junction of the Burn of Crombie. The church is on a 
rising ground at a little distance, in the middle of a Druidical 
circle, two large stones of which now only remain. The church- 
yard lies at the river-edge,— a site of peculiar interest and beauty. 
It contains several monuments of some architectural elegance. 
The most remarkable is that of " Reverendus et Pius Geo. Mel- 
drum de Crombie, et quondam de Glass, Prseco." He was Epis- 
copal minister or bishop of Glass, and laird of Crombie in this pa- 
rish ; died 1692, aged seventysix. The ornaments on the tomb 
are very rich and well carved. There is a vault attached to it ; 
and, in a recess in the centre of the elevated part of the monu- 
ment there is a half-length figure of the bishop, with cap on, 
and full sacerdotal robes, the hands holding a book, and altogether 
an uncommonly rich and highly-finished piece of architecture, in 
freestone from Elgin. A portion of the old church still remains 
rn the grave-yard. It had been used as a Roman Catholic, Epis- 
copal, and Presbyterian parish church in succession. There is 
a very neat vault, erected by public subscription in 1831, in which 
the bodies of the dead are laid for two months previous to being 
interred This plan originated in consequence of a grave having 
been robbed of its dead, which occasioned a great sensation in th 
parish. The river, a little below this, at the farm of Euchrie, 
takes several most remarkable turns.-The bridge, built in 1806, 
Js the next object of interest. It consists of two arches, one of 
which IS of a very wide span, and stands high on two opposite 
rocks. A httle below, stands the old tower-looking mansion of 
Kinardy, on a promontory at the junction of the burn of the same 
name with the Doveron. Its situation is peculiarly picturesque

village of Inverkeitliny, on the opposite bank, about two miles dis- 
tantr Here on the Marnoch side is a place called Chapelton, 
where, no doubt, there had once stood a place of worship. A 
little lower down are the grounds and mansion-house of Ne- 
iherdale,— the property of Mrs Rose Innes, second heritor of 
the parish. The house is modern and handsome. The garden 
and grounds are beautifully laid out and well wooded. There 
arc beech hedges here, remarkably large and fine specimens. 
The property, chiefly consisting of several large farms, is very 
well cultivated. 

The middle portion of the parish from west to east is considera- 
bly diversified with rising grounds, the summits of most of them being 
covered with young thriving plantations, which aff"ord shelter and 
very much improve the appearance of the country. The hollows 
or straths between are well cultivated, and watered with small burns 
or rivulets. The soil in some places is dry, but commonly humid 

and mossy. . 

On the west side stands the old castle of Crombie, now the 
property of the Earl of Seafield. It has the appearance of having 
been a place of some strength. It now consists of three stories, 
but, like the similar castle of Kinardy, was at one time much 
higher. It is supposed to be of very ancient date. 

In the northern parts of the parish, consisting of the small pro- 
perties of Barrie, Culvie, Thorax, and the larger one of Auchin- 
derran, the soil, in general, though pretty fertile, is of a mossy 
nature, the exposure rather unfavourable, there being no wood. 
Much has been done of late years to improve these properties. 
In this part of the parish, the only resident proprietor is Robert 

Ogilvie, Esq. of Culvie. 

Hydrography.— ThevQ are numerous small rivulets tributary to 
the Doveron ; and springs of different qualities abound in the pa- 
rish. Most of the springs are strongly impregnated with iron. Se- 
veral in the lands of Crombie and Anchintoul have been of late dis- 
covered, containing sulphur, &amp;c. There are very extensive mosses 
in the parish, especially on the hill of Crombie, and on the lands of 
Auchintoul and Auchinderran; these are much resorted to for peats 

Mimralogy.ThQ rock in the parish is principally granite, ot 
which there are several quarries wrought to a considerable extent. 
One of these, on the lands of Cluny, of a gray colour, yields the 
largest and finest post for all sizes of cut granite equal to any in 
Scotland. A limestone is also found in Ardmellie. A kiln had 
been formerly in operation here. The range of granite rock seems 



MARNOCH.

to terminate, and that of a bhie limestone seems to commence, 
about the burn of Kinardy. 

II. — Civil Historv. 
Land-owners. — The land-owners in the parish are, William 
Aitken, Esq. of Auchintoul ; Mrs Rose Innes of Netherdale ; 
Earl of Seafield, Crombie, and Crana ; Earl of Fife's Trustees, 
Kinardy ; Mrs Chalmers of Cluny ; The Right Honourable Ed. 
Ellice of Ardmellie; Arthur Abercrombie, Esq. of Auchinderran ; 
William Duft', Esq. of Tillydown ; Robert Ogilvie, Esq. of Culvie ; 
William Grant, Esq. of Barry ; and John Benton, Esq. of Thorax. 

Mansion-houses, c— Near the centre of the parish stands the 
mansion-house of Auchintoul, now the property of William Ait- 
ken, Esq., the largest proprietor in the parish. This was once 
the residence and property of General Alexander Gordon, who 
entered the service of Russia as a cadet, under Peter the Great, 
and rose to high favour and command in his army. After he re- 
tired to his native country, he took a prominent part in the rebel- 
lion of 1715, commanded the Highland clans at Sheriffmuir, and 
conducted their retreat with great skill. He was after this attaint- 
ed for treason, but escaped by a misnomer, and thus saved his life 
and property, but was obliged to remain concealed for several years in 
France, whence he returned in 1724. He wrote in two volumes the 
history of his « Great" master and friend, was much respected, and 
died aged eighty-two years: he was buried in the church-yard 
here, but no memorial marks the spot. His second wife was a 
daughter of Sir T. Moncrieff of MoncriefF. The house on this pro- 
perty is a large plain building, forming three sides of a square,— 
one side was built by General Gordon. It has been much im- 
proved by the present proprietor; the situation is commandino-. 
The gardens are beautifully walled with dressed granite, and well 
kept. The hot houses and conservatory are extensive, and there 
IS a very handsome square of most commodious offices. The 
woods and belts are of considerable extent, and thriving on this 
property ; and within half a mile of the house stands the village of 
Aberchirder, consisting of three streets, regularly laid out, running 
parallel to each other, having a large square in the middle, and 
many excellent substantial houses recently built. 

f A stands the mansion-house of Cluny, the property 

ot Mrs Chalmers. It is a modern structure, beautifully built of 
dressed granite in the cottage stle. The house was built, and 
the whole place laid out by the late Mr Chalmers, with great 
judgment and taste. The whole is in a most complete state 



386 BANFFSHIRE. 

and the young plantations are very ornamental. This property, 
along with another in an adjoining parish, was destined by the late 
Mr Chalmers to the establishment of an hospital in Banlf. 

Parochial Registers.— The parochial registers are, Ut, book of 
discipline, commencing in the year 1666, kept regularly, con- 
taining also the money transactions of the kirk-session, with regard 
to the poor; 2d, register of baptisms, commencing in the year 
1676, and kept regularly; register of marriages, continued 
from 1672 to 1680. There is then a complete blank till 1773, 
but from that period the registration is regular. 

III. — Population. 
' The population of the parish in 1841 was 2876. The number 
of families 623, all belonging to the Established Church, with the 
exception of about 40. Of these, about twelve belonj to the Se-- 
cession Church, about ten to the Roman Catholic, &amp;ha six to the 
Episcopal church, and about eight to the Baptist communion, 
all of whom have places of worship in the village. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture.— The real rental of the parish is about L.7000. 
The highest rent of land per acre is L.3, the ordinary rent is from 
IBs. to L.1, 2s. A considerable portion does not exceed from 
12s to 15s.' per acre. It is believed that agriculture has, within 
the last twenty-five years, by the improvement of waste land, added 
about one-third to the rental of the parish. Improved breeds of cat- 
tle have been introduced in several of the farms, and crossed 
with the native breeds, with apparent advantage. The new system 
of drainage has also commenced here. 

The lands of Crombie have been much improved of late years 
by the two enterprising tenants. One of them, Mr Smith, gained 
a medal from the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland 
in 1836, for the improvement of waste and other land. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Markets, Sfc.—ln the village, there are regular markets for feeing 
servants at the terms of Whitsunday and Martinmas. During the 
winter, there is a weekly grain market on Monday, as also an an- 
nual market on the second Tuesday of March, for horses and cat- 
tle called Marnoch fair. There are six public houses m the pa- 
rish one in the country, and five in the village,-three too many. 
There are a branch of the North of Scotland Bank, and a stamp- 
office in the village, as also a post-office, and regular runners every 
lawful day to Banff and Huntly. The turnpike between these 
places runs through the village, and also the road between Tur- 



MAllNOCH. 



387 



riff and Portsoy, the village being almost in the centre between 
these places, and from eight to ten miles distant from each. The 
parishioners of Marnoch are an industrious, quiet, well-behaved 
people, and possessing a high degree of intelligence. 

Library, — There is an extensive parochial library, as well as a 
juvenile library. Many of the parishioners are much given to 
reading. It may be mentioned, that, in the course of two weeks, 
60 copies of Dr Dewar's " Body of Divinity" were sold in the 
parish. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The stipend, as last augmented, is 128 
bolls of meal, the same number of barley, and L.IO for commu- 
nion elements. The glebe contains about five-and-a-quarter acres 
arable, worth L. 3, 3s. per acre, and three and a-quarter acres of 
grass, wo' L.l, 10s. per acre. The manse was built in 1805, 
a plain, comfortable building, in good repair, and beautifully si- 
tuated. The church, built some years prior to this time, and, 
from insufficiency, rebuilt within a few years after, is still little 
fitted for comfort. It is one of those old-fashioned barn-looking 
houses, which are now very properly disappearing, to make way 
for more improved places of worship. 

The Protestant ministers of the parish were, — Hugo Chalmers, 
Episcopal minister of Marnoch, who died in 1707. His son, Alex- 
ander Chalmers, succeeded him as Presbyterian minister, for which 
office he had been educated by his father. — Mr James Innes, who 
died in the year 1803; and Mr William Stronach, who died in 1837. 
Mr John Edwards was presented by the patron in 1837 ; another 
presentation was issued by the patron in 1838 in favour of Mr D. 
Henry. The proceedings that led to this second presentation, or 
that ensued, need not be recited here. We may merely mention, 
that they led to the erection of a very handsome new church 
and manse near the village. The church contains about 1000 
hearers, and the whole cost more than L. 2000. 

Education.— There are generally three or four schools in the 
parish, viz. the parochial school, taught by the Rev. J. Largue, 
in the most efficient manner, and according to the most approved 
modern system, and two or three unendowed. There is not so 
much need of an increase of the number, as of assistance to some 
of those already in operation, or perhaps of a second parochial 
school m the village, or a more centrical position for the present 
otie. 

BANFF.  



388 



BANFFSHIUE. 



The amount of the schoolmaster's salary is L.34, 4s. 4id. ; the 
probable amount of fees, about L.35 ; and of other emoluments, 
viz. from Dick's Bequest, Bruce's Legacy, session-clerkship, about 
L.5a 

Poor.— The average number of persons regularly on the poors 
roll is about 50, receiving from 5s. to 9s. per quarter; besides 
these, a good many poor persons receive occasional aid. The col- 
lections at church were wont to amount to about L.70, and the 
heritors generally gave about L.40 per annum. Now, however, a 
new arrangement is about being made. Besides the above, the 
population at large are most liberal in alms-giving, relieving very 
many cases of poverty by local subscriptions.

PRESBYTERY OF STRATHBOGIE, SYNOD OF MORAY. 



1. Topography and Natural History. 

ExtentySfc—TuB parish is about 6 miles long and as many broad. 
It lies in that fertile track of country called Strathisla, through 
which runs the water of Isla. It is bounded on the north, by the 
parishes of Rathven and Deskford ; on the south, by those of 
Glass and Botriphnie ; on the west, by Grange. The prevailing 
soil is loam and clay : the climate moist and cold. 

The general appearance of the parish is not very inviting. Yet, 
along the banks of the Islay, there are beautiful and rich corn- 
fields in the highest state of cultivation. The course of the Islay 
through the parish may be said to be from south to north. 

II. — Civil History. 
Mansion- Houses.— A modern and respectable mansion-house 
has been recently erected at Edintore, the seat of the only heritor 
resident in the parish. 

 The proceedings consequent on the presentation to the parish of Marnoch in 
J837 led to the deposition, by the General Assembly in 1841, of the Rev. J. Thom- 
son, Minister of this parish : in which Mr Thomson and a minority of the General 
Assembly do not acquiesce. They have obtamed a suspension and interdict from Uie 
Court of Session. 



KEITH. 



389 



Superstitions. — The parish records bear, since the establish- 
ment of Presbyterianism, that the session took up a case of witch- 
craft against a woman, upon an accusation, that, as often as 
she passed the door of the Earl's mill, the mill-clap stopped. 
There was, in the north part of the parish, a rig of uncultivated land, 
called the Gun Rig, set aside to propitiate the evil spirits; and 
tradition says, that, when the farmer, about fifty years ago, was 
about to improve it, one of his cattle fell down dead. A stone- 
coffin containing some ashes was found in a heap of stones, which 
the present tenant removed, he having succeeded in improving the 
land, without injury to man or beast. 

Eminent Men. — This parish had the honour of giving birth to 
Mr James Ferguson, the celebrated writer on astronomy and na- 
tural philosophy.

The villages of New Keith and Old Keith contain 1805 inha- 
bitants ; Fife Keith, 579 ; Newmill, 448. The Banffshire part 
of the parish contains 1349, and the Morayshire, 276. - 

IV. — Industry. 

The people are generally employed in agriculture, and the va- 
rious trades which the cultivation of the land requires. 

On the hill of Oldmore, there is a population to the amount of 
300. The produce of the land is not sufficient for more than three 
months maintenance of the people in the year, even when the crop 
is good; and as it often fails from frost and other causes, they 
have to depend entirely on the sale of peats, which they pre- 
pare during summer, and drive to Keith all the year round, with 
small carts and ponies — frequently a female being the driver. The 
same, though on a somewhat less scale, may be said of Bogbain 
and the hill of Achanacy. The farms in the other parts of the 
parish vary in size, from crofts of 5 or 6 acres, to farms of 150 to 
200 acres. 

Agricultural Improvements.— SuhsoW ploughing is carried on 
with doubtful success ; bone manure answers well ; and furrow- 
draining is practised both with small stones and tiles. Crosses of 
the native breed of cattle of the country with Teeswater and short- 
horned bulls have answered well. 

Benf.—Re.x\ rent of the parish, L.6500 ; highest rent per acre

BANFFSHIRE. 



The produce of the parish for export consists of cattle, corn, 
barley and bear, pork, eggs, butter, and cheese, of which a great 
quantity is sent to the London market. The land is culti- 
vated generally on the six-shift rotation of cropping, two years 
grass, two corn, one potatoes or turnips, and one corn or barley. 
There is no wheat cultivated in the parish ; yet, there being two 
flour-mills, its manufacture is carried on to some extent. In New 
and Old Keith, there are 338 feu, to each of which are annexed 
from two to six acres of land, so that every feuar, whatever his 
trade or occupation, produces his own milk, butter, and cheese, 
and, in many cases, a sufficiency of meal for the use of his family. 
In Fife Keith, there are 120 feus, and to each feu are annexed from 
4 to 6 acres of land. In Newmill, there are 100 feus, with five 
acres of land to each feu ; and here, the people are more devoted 
to agriculture than in the other two villages, there being in pro- 
portion fewer tradesmen. 

Manufactures. — There is a tannery, which employs two tanners 
and one currier ; a distillery, which produces about 20,000 gallons 
of whisky annually ; a tobacco manufactory, which requires from 
40 to 30 cwt. annually. There are two mills for carding and 
spinning of wool, and a bleachfield for country use ; a mill for 
home-grown flax ; six corn-mills, and two flour-mills, which carry 
on a great trade, supplying the country for upwards of twenty miles 
round. A vein of limestone runs through the parish, from north- 
east to south-west, which is manufjictured with advantage at Black- 
hillock, Douglas Brae, and Maisley, producing annually from 
30,000 to 40,000 bolls of lime, which finds a ready market, be- 
sides supplying the surrounding districts both in Aberdeenshire 
and Morayshire, and giving employment to many carters and small 
crofters, both in driving the coals from Port- Gordon to the quar-

Villages. Old Keith is a very ancient place, and, at no very 

distant period, was celebrated for an annual market held in Sep- 
tember, to which merchants from Glasgow and the other manu- 
facturing towns in the south repaired in great numbers, where they 
met those from the north, as far as Orkney, and exchanged their 
various commodities. So great was the concourse of people there, 
that the historian of Moray says, " There was not accommoda- 
tion for them, and they occupied the barns and out-houses in the 
country for many miles round." New Keith is a clean thriving-hke 
village, on a rising ground sloping towards the east, with three

parallel streets running due south and north, intersected hy a nar- 
row lane between each alternate feu. The feus are fifteen yards 
front by sixty yards back, and pay from 10s. to L.l, 5s. feu-duty. 
There is a town-house and lock-up-house, and a large square or 
market-place, where there is a weekly market on Friday for the sale 
of all sorts of produce. There are six annual markets for the sale 
of cattle, horses, and sheep. At those of June and September a 
great deal of wool is still disposed of. New Keith may still be 
considered the market-town of the district. It was begun to be 
built about the year 1750. There are branches of three banks, — 
the Aberdeen Bank, the Town and County Bank, and the North of 
Scotland Bank. In it are all the principal merchants' shops, the 
residences of all the solicitors and doctors, while the inn, which is 
a commodious building, is the resort of all the commercial travel- 
lers, and the Mail and Defiance coaches stop at it daily. Gas- 
light has been lately introduced. There is likewise a Savings Bank 
in New Keith, which was instituted in 1827 by the parish minis- 
ter. It is conducted by a secretary and thirty directors. There 
is a subscription library containing upwards of 600 volumes of 
standard works, and several other libraries connected with seve- 
ral of the congregations of the place. Fife Keith is a clean 
healthy village, and was begun to be built in 1817 by Lord Fife, 
on the north side of the Islay. It has a fine building adapted for 
an inn. The whole village, in a commercial view, has been a com- 
plete failure ; for, except a few merchants' shops, and some three 
or four tradesmen, the population may be said to depend on their 
crofts of land. It has four markets for the sale of cattle annuallv. 
Newmill was begun as early as New Keith ; but, being at a dis- 
tance from public roads, it did not thrive,— the people depend- 
ing entirely on their land. It has one annual well frequented mar- 
ket for the sale of cattle, horses, and sheep, in the month of October. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is a substantial erection, 
built in the year 1816. It is 100 feet long, and 60 wide, and is 
seated to contain 1800. It has a square tower 120 feet hiah, in 
which are placed the clock and bell. The Roman Catholic'' cha- 
pel is a neat building, with a highly ornamented gable fronting the 
market place of New Keith. It was erected in 1828, and is ca- 
pable of containing 340. The General Assembly's church con- 
tains sittings for 700. The Independent chapel has seats for 240, 
The Secession church has seats for 450. The Episcopalian cha- 
pel is seated to contain 150, and has a fine organ. 

There are about 60 communicants connected with the Seces-

sion ; about 400 belong to tbe Roman Catliolic profession ; Epis- 
copalians and Independents not above 30 eacii. 

Education. — The parish school is a large and conimodious 
house, built for two teachers, and capable of accommodating 260 
scholars. It was erected at the expense of the heritors in 1833. 
There is a school-house in Newmill capable of holding 100. 
There are likewise three other school-houses in the parish, erect- 
ed within these few years by public collections and donations from 
private individuals and the heritors, obtained by the exertions of 
the minister. One of these schools is at Achanacy, another at 
Tarrycroys, and another at Oldmore. 

The parish schoolmaster, besides the usual salary from the he- 
ritors, enjoys the Dick Bequest; and before the Schoolmaster's 
Act passed, there were mortified for the benefit of a schoolmaster 
in New Keith the lands and estate of Edendrach, the minister and 
kirk-session of the parish being appointed trustees ; but, about a 
century ago, a progenitor of the Duff family, alleging that the 
land had fallen to him from the non-payment of the teinds, 
which he at that time rented from Forbes of Croigievar, got pos- 
session of the land for the yearly payment of 300 merks Scots 
to the schoolmaster— one of the elders at the time protesting 
against the transaction. About fifteen years ago, an attempt was 
made to reclaim the lands to their original purpose; but the title 
was found to have prescribed. The late Dr Simpson of Wor- 
cester, in the year 1840, left L.500, 3 per cent, consols, the inte- 
rest of which was to increase the income of the schoolmaster. Yet, 
notwithstanding all these advantages, the school-fees are higher 
than in any of the surrounding parishes. The schoolmaster of 
Newmill receives, conjointly from the Society for Propagating 
Christian Knowledge, the Earl of Fife, and the interest of L.lOO 
mortified by the late Mr Chalmers, Newmill, an endowment of 
about L.25 annually, besides the school-fees. 

Poor.— There are about 130 on the poor roll, who are under 
the guardianship of the kirk-session, and receive annually L.250 
Sterling, derived from charitable collections, the iise of the mort- 
cloth, the sale of burial ground, and the interest of some donations, 
—the heritors making up the deficiency. It is given in sums, va- 
rying according to the condition of the claimants, from 3s. a week 
to 4s. a quarter.

PRESBYTERY OF ELGIN, SYNOD OF MORAY. 

THE REV. WILLIAM GORDON, i 
THE REV. ALEXANDER WALKER, j- A' 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — It appears from the chartulary of Moray that the name 
of this town and parish prior to the year 1226 was Elgyn or Hel- 
gyn; and an old iron seal in the town's repositories, has this inscrip- 
tion, engraven in Saxon characters, in a style supposed to be earlier 
than that of the middle of the 16th century, — " S. commune civi- 
tatis de Helgyn." a variety of etymologies have been given of 
the name, but the most probable derives it from Helgy, General of 
the army of Sigurd, the Norwegian Earl of Orkney, who conquer- 
ed Caithness, Sutherland, Ross, and Moray, about the beginning 
of the tenth century. This general, it is said, built a town in 
the southern part of Moray, which most probably was Elgin, as it 
is situated about eight miles south east of Burghead, where the 
Norwegians had a small fort and harbour for their shippino-.-|- 

Extent, 8fc. — The parish of Elgin is inland, and extremely irre- 
gular in its figure. With the exception of that part of the parish 
lying westward of the Lossie, and containing the vales of Pluscar- 
den and Mosstowie, which are separated by a steep hilly rido-e, it 
has a gentle acclivity from the town, on the northern extremity, 
to the base of the Blackhills, the summit of which is its southern 
boundary. We are not perhaps far from the truth in estimating 
the superficial extent at 18 square miles. The town stands on 
the south bank of the Lossie, on ground sloping a little to the north, 
and its length is greatly disproportionate to its breadth, the high 
street being nearly three quarters of a mile long. The bulk of the 
population have their dwellings in closes or alleys, opening at aright 
angle to the principal street. In olden times, the river ran by the 
gardens which generally terminated these alleys to the north ; but 
a field of fifty or sixty acres of haugh land, partly in the parish of

New Spynie, now intervenes betwixt the river and its former chan- 
nel. A highly cultivated and well-wooded secondary slope, rising 
in the form of a crescent from the north bank, greatly beautifies, 
and at the same time shelters, the town from the North-west, North 
and North-east, winds. The south side of the town is preferred 
lor building, and many handsome houses and cottages, have been 
recently erected ; but the effect of the whole is marred by a total 
want of plan; the Proprietor having left each Feuar at liberty to set 
down his house according to his own taste or caprice. 

Meteorology. — No regular register of the barometer and ther- 
mometer has been hitherto kept in the parish ; but it may be stated 
generally, that both of these range higher than in any of the northern 
counties of Scotland. The prevailing winds are west and south- 
west, and the climate of the town and district is particularly mild and 
salubrious. In the year 1 830, 93 deaths were recorded, of which 
one-third were above sixty years of age, viz. 8 from sixty to se- 
venty ; 16 from seventy to eighty; 7 from eighty to ninety; 
and 2 from ninety to one hundred. There are comparatively 
few winters when snow lies more than two or three weeks after 
the commencement of the year, and for some winters past it 
was scarcely seen for as many days in succession. The summers 
are dry and warm. When the clouds, loaded with the vapour of 
the Atlantic, reach the head of the Moray Frith, they are attrac- 
ted on the north by the Ross and Sutherland hills, and on the south 
by the lofty mountain range where the Nairn, the Findhorn, and 
the Lossie have their sources; and the farmer, in what is called the 
Hoio of Moray, sees many a cloud pouring its waters to the north 
and south which would be most grateful and refreshing to his parch- 
ed fields. The drought of July is most injurious to the spring- 
crops. 

None of the prevalent diseases can ascribed to any peculi- 
arity in the climate. No case of Indian cholera has occurred in 
the parish. 

Hydrography. — The landward part of the parish is generally 
well supplied with springs of excellent water ; but the town is de- 
pendent on pump-wells, the water of which is more or less impreg- 
nated with the strata through which it rises, — or on river water, 
brought in casks drawn by horses or carried by servants, at a great 
expense of time and labour. 

• A barometer, thermometer, and rain-gage have been provided at the Elgin In- 
stitution, and placed under the charge of Mr Allan, the accurate and intelligent house- 
governor, and the observations on each will be given to the public in a tabular form.

The Lossie is the only stream of any magnitude in the parish. 
It either skirts or winds through it, rather a sluggish course of 
about eight miles, part of which it forms the northern boundary, 
and falls into the Moray Frith at the shipping port of Lossiemouth, 
five miles north-east of Elgin. Running through a flat country, 
it requires to be confined to its channel by artificial banks, which 
it frequently overflows, damaging the crops on the adjoining fields, 
and occasioning considerable expense to the proprietors, in repairs. 
This was particularly the case in the disastrous floods of August 
1829, so accurately and graphically described in Sir Thomas D. 
Lauder's book on the subject. 

Geology and Mineralogy.— On either of these branches of sci- 
ence there is very little to interest the naturalist. The hilly ridge 
which separates Pluscarden from Mosstowie is of hard sandstone, 
not liable to be decomposed by the action of air and water; and, 
where the strata are visible, they appear to be nearly parallel to the 
horizon. About a mile south of Elgin, there is a bed of secondary 
limestone, lying in the direction of east to west, and which may 
be traced eastward through the parishes of St Andrews and Ur- 
quhart to a rock visible at low water in the Moray Frith. This bed 
IS adulterated with sand, clay, and oxide of iron. These impuri- 
ties give the lime a dark colour, but it is found to answer very well 
for agricultural purposes, and for mortar to buildings of an infe- 
rior description. There is a great variety of soil in the parish. 
Much of the arable land is light and sandy, part is inclined to clay, 
and part is a rich loam, particularly on the banks of the Lossie. 

Woods.— Khoxxi seventy years ago, the lowland district of Mo- 
ray was one of the barest in Scotland. Scarce a tree Was to be 
seen, except a few ashes in the avenue leading to the mansion of 
some old family. James the Second Earl of Fife was the first ex- 
tei;sive planter, and his example was soon followed by the neio-h- 
bourmg land-owners, so that there is now hardly an uncultivated 
knoll or ridge to be seen which is not covered with wood. The 
oldest plantation in this parish is at Main, the property of the Earl 
of Seafield, and it barely reaches to half a century. Many hun- 
dreds of acres on the estates of the Earl of Fife and George Duff; 
Esq. of Milton Duff", which, less than twenty years ago, were naked 
moor, are now clothed with almost every variety of forest trees. 
These, and the plantations at Westerton, the property of Colonel 
Alexander Hay, greatly improve the scenery of Pluscarden, and 
render the mteresting ruins of the priory much more beautiful and

picturesque. On the south side of the parish, Blackhills, the pro- 
perty of Lachlan Cuming, Esq. is also well wooded. All these  
plantations are very thriving, and consist of larch and Scotch firs 
interspersed with oak, beech, ash, &amp;c. where the soil gives any 
promise of sufficient depth and richness for the nourishment of 
hard timber. The larch here, as in most other parts of the coun- 
try, is much infested with the insect peculiar to it; and, at one pe- 
riod, the planters were much alarmed at the ravages of the Chermcs 
pint, as it has been called, but their fears are subsiding, as experi- 
ence has shown that it rarely kills, though it no doubt retards the 

growth of the tree. 

Remarkable Beech.— There is a very beautiful and perfectly 
healthy beech tree in the college garden, the property of George 
Duff, Esq. of Milton. The stem rises almost perpendicular to the 
.height of 16 feet, and then bursts out into a forest of Umbs in every 
direction, and with every possible variety of curve and angle, form- 
ing an object truly picturesque. The girth of the bole near the 
ground is 13 feet, and at 8 feet high it is 12 feet. As nearly as 
can be ascertained, the fine head rises to 70 feet, and the boughs 
extend over a circle of 80 feet in diameter. Eight of such trees 
would cover an imperial acre. 

II. — Civil History. 
The Rev. Dr Lachlan Shaw, one of the ministers of Elgin, pub- 
lished a history of the province of Moray in the year 1775, and 
the writer of this has abridged from it much of what is stated re- 
lative to the antiquities of the town and parish. The book hav- 
ing become scarce, was reprinted with notes at the Courier print- 
ing-office Elgin, in 1827, and is now in general circulation. 

Historical Notices.— Elgin is the county town,— the seat of the 
presbytery,— of the law and county courts. About the beginning 
of the eleventh century it appears to have been a considerable town, 
with a royal fort. The earliest charter of guildry was granted by 
Alexander 11. in 1234. This charter was subsequently confirm- 
ed; and various local taxes remitted at different dates by the Earls 
of 'Moray, to whom the town was subject as Constables of the 
King's fort Grants of land and other concessions by Alexander, 
Robert, James I. XL and VI. were ratified by Charles I. in a char- 
ter dated the 8th of October 1633. The gross revenue of the burgh 
at prepnt is about L. 600 per annum. The town's arms represent 
St Giles in a pastoral habit, holding a book in the right hand and 
a pastoral staff in the left, with this motto, " sic itur ad astra."

Since the passing of the Reform Bill the limits of the royalty have 
been greatly extended, and include the populous village of Bishop 
Mill, in the parish of New Spynie. The number of the enrolled 
constituency is 277, but at least twenty more have a right to the 
elective franchise, who have not qualified. Along with Cullen, 
Banff, Peterhead, Kintore, and Inverury, it sends a Member to 
Parliament, and is the returning burgh. Within the last fifteen 
years, two printing-presses have been established in the town, and 
the proprietors of each attempted a periodical, the one a literary 
magazine, and the other an agricultural journal, but without suc- 
cess. The Elgin Courier, a weekly journal, was first pubhshed in 
1827, and at one time had a circulation, it is said, of 300, which, 
had it continued, would have remunerated the enterprising pro- 
prietor. From untoward circumstances, the journal has recently 
passed into other hands ; and if the Elgin Courant is conducted 
with the prudence and ability which the few numbers published 
indicate, there is no doubt it will succeed. 

Eminent Men. — Alexander Grey, Esq. surgeon, and Lieutenant- 
General Anderson, both of the E. I. C. Service, the former a na- 
tive of Elgin, and the latter a proprietor and occasional residenter, 
deserve to be mentioned. Dr Grey, by economical habits, amassed 
a very considerable fortune in the East, the greater part of which 
he bequeathed for charitable purposes, particularly for building 
and endowing an hospital for the sick poor of the town and county 
of Elgin, of which the objects for whom it was intended have been 
reaping the benefit for more than fifteen years. 

General Anderson was born of very humble parents in the neigh- 
bouring parish of Lhanbryd, and entered the Honourable Com- 
pany's service as a private. By his good conduct and soldierly 
qualities he attained rank and wealth, and the large fortune which 
he had honourably acquired he devoted at his death to the educa- 
tion of the young, and the support of the aged poor of his native 
county. The Elgin Institution at the east, and Grey's Hospital 
at the west end of the town are splendid memorials of these phi- 
lanthropists. 

Land-oiDuers. — The principal proprietors in the parish are, the 
Earls of Fife, Seafield, and Moray, George Duff of Milton Duff, 
Colonel Alexander Hay of Westerton, Alexander Brander of 
Springfield, James Stephen, M. D. of the Shanchry, James Stewart 
King of the Greyfriars, Lachlan Cuming of Blackhills, and Major 
Taylor of Bilbohall.

Parochial Registers. — The register of baptisms and marriages, 
extending to seven volumes, commences in the year 1705, and 
though a years are wanting, it may be reckoned on the whole 
as complete a record as is to be found in most parishes. The re- 
gister of burials begins in 1770, and is confined to those interred 
in the cathedral burying-ground. This inaccuracy, however, is 
more apparent than real, as the number of strangers interred in the 
cathedral ground are probably very nearly the same as the number 
of persons who die in the parish, and are buried in the neighbour- 
ing church -yards. These registers are most accurately kept. 

Antiquities. — There are various remains of religious houses in 
the parish, the most interesting and magnificent of which are those 
of the cathedral. This noble edifice was founded by Bishop An- 
drew Murray in the year 1224, on the site of the church of the 
Holy Trinity at the north-east extremity of the town, and, as he lived 
eighteen years, it is probable that if he did not finish, he greatly 
advanced the building. " The Wolf of Badenoch," having seized 
upon, and kept violent possession of some of the Bishop of Moray's 
lands, was excommunicated for this outrage, and in resentment 
burnt the town, the parish church of St Giles, the Maison Dieu, 
the cathedral, and the greater part of the college in the year 1390. 
The cathedral was rebuilt with as little delay as possible, in the 
form of a Passion or Jerusalem cross, having five towers, two at 
each end, and one in the centre. In the interior it had what is 
called the nave for the numerous and splendid processions of Christ- 
ian worship under papal guidance, — aisles for the reception of the 
multitude to witness these processions, — and a choir for the actual 
performance of the sacred rites. On the north side was the chap- 
ter-house, communicating with the choir by a vaulted vestry. These 
essential appendages of Romish worship necessarily occupied a 
space of great magnitude, as the following measurement, which is 
nearly accurate, will shew : Length of cathedral over walls, 264 
feet; breadth, 35 ; traverse, 114 ; height of centre tower, 198 ; east- 
ern turrets, 60 ; western towers without the spires, 84; side wall, 36. 
The whole was of Gothic architecture, in the style called " decor- 
ated English;" and although the grotesque is the prevailing cha- 
racter of the sculpture, many small ornaments, designed with taste, 
and executed with the utmost delicacy, are yet to be seen. This 
costly and imposing edifice stood entire in all its grandeur, until  
the government of the Regent Morton was driven to the miserable  
shift of passing an act of council on the 14th February 1568 for

stripping the lead from the cathedral churches of Aberdeen and 
Elgin, and selling it to pay the troops. This order was too faithful- 
ly executed, and the cathedral of Moray, thus uncovered, was 
suffered to decay as a piece of Romish vanity, too expensive to be 
kept in repair. The wooden work of the great tower gradually de- 
cayed, and, the foundation giving way, it fell in the year 1711. The 
remains of this venerable pile are well worth the examination of 
the traveller. The chapter-house, an exact octagon, 37 feet in 
diagonal breadth, with a vaulted roof 34 feet high, and supported 
in the centre by a column 24 feet high, and 9 feet in circumference, 
on which rest arched pillars from each angle of the sides, is in good 
preservation. The turrets and walls of the choir on the east end, 
and the towers on the west, between which was the grand entrance 
with its deep recess and bivalved door richly ornamented, are still 
standing at the dimensions already specified ; but of the walls of 
the nave and traverse only a few fragments remain. A commend- 
able attention has been paid for some years past by the Barons of 
Exchequer in Scotland, and the Commissioners of Woods and 
Forests in England, to the preservation of these interesting relics, 
and grants of money have been judiciously expended in clearing 
away the great mass of rubbish in the choir and nave, by which the 
steps to the altar and the bases of the pillars that supported the 
arches of the aisles have been uncovered, so that a tolerably accu- 
rate idea may now be formed of the extent of the several parts of 
the building. Much praise is due to the present keeper for the 
zeal and diligence with which he has laboured in bringing to light 
adjuncts of the fabric, particularly the steps leading to the grand 
entrance, and a porch to the southmost aisle, of which there was 
no record. 

The College was an appendage of the Cathedral, and contained 
not only the church and grave yard, but also the bishop's house, 
and the manses and gardens of the twenty-two canons. It was 
inclosed with a strong stone wall 4 yards high and 900 yards in 
circuit, and had four gates. The Pans Port or eastern gateway , 
with part of the inclosing wall, is still standing, and appears to have 
had a portcullis, iron gate, and porter's lodge. 

A Convent of Grey Friars was settled in Elgin by Alexander II. 
and the ruins of their church are to be seen on the south side of 
the town. 

The site of the preceptory of Maison Dieu may be traced in the

middle of ah arable field at the east end of the town, but no part 
of the buildings remain. 

The ruins of the Alley of Pluscarden are situated in a vale of 
the same name, at the foot of a steep bridge fronting the south, 
about six miles westward of Elgin. A lofty stone wall, of which a 
considerable part is standing, inclosed several acres of ground. 
The church, in the form of a cross, stood almost in the centre, 
with the prior's house and the cells of the monks adjoining. The 
Dormitory, which has recently been roofed in, and the walls 
and windows repaired in the same style as the original build- 
ing, was on the second floor, at the south east end of the church, 
and under it was an arched Kitchen. The latter has been fit- 
ted up as a place of public worship for the inhabitants of the vale, 
and a clergyman on the Royal Bounty resides near, and regularly 
officiates. The inclosure also contained the gardens, the burial- 
ground, and the mill for grinding the monks' grain. Every atten- 
tion is paid by the Earl of Fife, the proprietor, to preserve these 
relics from farther decay, and the shrubberies and walks near the 
abbey, and the plantations adjacent, add greatly to their beauty 
and interest. 

Port. — There are some remains of a fort on a small green hill, 
now called the Lady-hill, at the west end of the town, but they are 
not sufficient to show the form or extent of the buildings. The 
walls were built of stone and run lime, and, as the length of the 
plain area on the top of the hill is nearly twice the breadth, the 
fort was probably an oblong quadrangle. It no doubt had its towers, 
draw-well, guarded entrance, and fosse, as traces of some of these 
are still to be seen. The Earls of Moray acted as constables, and 
had jurisdiction within certain bounds till the middle of the fifteenth 
century ; they had for salary the customs of the town, the assize of 
ale, and some lands. The property of the hill descended to their 
successors, and belongs to the present Earl. This little hill com- 
mands a most extensive and delightful view of the frith and the 
surrounding country for many miles. 

New Buildings. — The Elgin Institution, for the support of old 
age and the education of youth, stands on the south side of the en- 
trance to the town from the east, and is a quadrangular building 
of two stories, surmounted with a circular tower and dome. The 
principal front and entrance is to the north, having the two sides 
of the quadrangle projecting, and, in the centre a portico of two 
beautiful Ionic columns with entablature rising to the height of 



ELGIN. 



9 



the building, on which is placed a group of three figures in sculp- 
ture, emblematic of the founder and the objects of the charity. 
The west side has also its portico of six plain Doric columns and 
entablature rising to -the base of the windows of the second story. 
The interior contains most convenient and comfortable accommo- 
dation for sixty children, ten aged and indigent persons, and for the 
necessary establishment of house-governor, matron, teachers, and 
servants. The grand entrance leads through a narrow corridor di- 
rectly into the chapel, having an arched roof full 30 feet high, and 
communicating by arched passages with both sides of the building. 
The school rooms, the eating halls, and dormitories of the children 
occupy the whole eastern side ; the apartments of the aged are 
on the ground floor of the western side, and over these the sick- 
rooms for the children, and the parlours and bed-rooms of the 
house-governor and matron. The kitchen, wash-house, laundry, &amp;c. 
are to the south ; and connected with these, but having a separate 
entry, are the free school, of sufficient extent for 230 scholars, and 
the apartments for a male and female teacher. The porter's lodge, 
in the form of an octagon with a pyramidal roof, is on the west 
side. The garden, play-grounds, shrubbery, and stance of the 
buildings, measure about 3 Scotch acres, and are enclosed with a 
stone wall and iron railing. The building is reckoned very chaste, 
and highly creditable to the talents of Archibald Simpson, Esq. 
architect, Aberdeen, who designed it. It is constructed of beau- 
tiful freestone, from the hill of Quarrywood, and, with the furnish- 
ings, cost nearly L. 12,000. It was opened on the 5th June 1833. 

Church. — The new church, on the site of the old church of St 
Giles, is in the High Street, nearly in the centre of the town, and 
is built of the same materials as the Institution, and after a plan by 
the same artist. This is a very elegant structure, not surpassed by 
any in the north of Scotland. The length over walls is 96 feet, 
and breadth 601 side walls 36, and height of ceiling 31. On 
the east end there is a projecting square tower with clock and 
bells, surmounted by what is commonly called a lantern, consist- 
ing of one massive column in the centre, and a circular colonnade, 
supporting a tholus or cupola richly ornamented, the whole rising 
to the height of 112 feet. The access for the congregation is by 
three doors on the west end, under a spacious portico of six Gre- 
cian Doric columns, projecting 7 feet 4 inches from the building 
and extending 53 feet in breadth. The entablature rises to a 
sufficient height to admit of the portico being roofed uniformly

with the church. An unseemly court-house and jail, a few yards 
to the westward of the church, prevent this fine portico from be- 
ing seen to advantage, but an act was passed last Session of Par- 
liament for their removal, so that this deformity to the church and 
to the street will soon be corrected. The vestry on the ground 
story of the tower communicates directly with the pulpit, which is 
placed about ten feet from the wall, by a small stair, and there is 
a stove for heating the church. The interior arrangements of gal- 
leries and pews are most convenient, and a beautiful simplicity, well 
suited to the forms of Presbyterian worship, characterises the whole. 
It was opened for public worship in October 1828; and, includ- 
ing communion plate and a fund of L. 300 for repairs, cost the pro- 
prietors L. 8300. 

Grey's Hospital. — This also is a building of two stories, in the 
Grecian style of architecture, having on the front, which is to the 
east, a fine projecting portico of four Roman Doric columns, and 
entablature, rising to the same height as the walls of the building, 
and the centre crowned with a dome, which has been found fault 
with as too heavy. It stands on a rising ground at the west end 
of the town, and coming into view almost immediately after passing 
the church, it forms a very striking and beautiful termination to 
the High Street. A small lunatic asylum for paupers, containing 
ten cells and the necessary accommodation for keepers and servants, 
was built, 1834, by a voluntary assessment on the land-owners, 
amounting to L. 850. It is situated on the grounds of the hospi- 
tal to the westward. Some delay in opening it has been occasion- 
ed by the want of funds to provide furniture, and to erect appen- 
dages to the building absolutely necessary, though not included in 
the original plan and estimate. The Trinity Lodge Assembly Rooms, 
spacious and elegantly furnished ; Sir Archibald Dunbar's town 
house ; the Episcopal Chapel ; the House of Westerton, are all of 
recent erection, but the limits of this report do not admit of their 
being fully described. 

III. — Population. 
If the returns of the population of the town and parish prior to 
tiie Government census be correct, it has fluctuated very consider- 
ably. 

In 1750, according to Dr Webster, the amount was - . 6306 



1793 - Rev. John Grant - - 4534 

1801 - Government census - . 4345 |. 

1811 - Do. - - - 4602 

1821 - Do. - - - 5308 

1831 - Do. males 2824, females 3306, 6130

The Increase since 1801 has been mostly in the town popula- 
tion, and probably may be thus accounted for. The work people, 
employed in a manufactory of woollen cloth, established since that 
time in the immediate vicinity of Elgin, though not in the parish, 
have their residence in the town. The extensive public and pri- 
vate buildings carried on, quarrying, road-making, and other job 
work, have induced many labourers to settle from different parts of the 
country, and not a few respectable families have been attracted by 
the acknowledged mildness of the climate and the excellence of the 
seminaries for male and female education. The increase on the 
landward population since 1793 has only been 23.

Language. — The dialect of the lowlands of Moray has no dis- 
tinguishing pecuharity, except an occasional substitution of w for 

as weal for veal, icery for very. A more extended education and 
better qualified instructors have of late generally improved the 
language of the operative classes. 

Habits and Character. — In the cottages of the small farmer and 
labourer, and in the apartments of the journeyman artisan, there 
is a marked improvement in cleanliness and comfort, and the same 
is observable in their dress and mode of living. It may be truly 
said that the people enjoy in a reasonable degree the comforts and 
advantages of society. In so numerous a population there is no 
doubt considerable diversity of character, but it may be stated ge- 
nerally that they are intelligent and industrious, decent in deport- 
ment, and attentive to their social and religious duties. Offences 
against the excise laws are become extremely rare ; but convictions 
for poaching are by no means uncommon. 

During the last three years, there have been 21 illegitimate 
births in the parish. 

IV. — Industry. 
The trade carried on in Elgin is mostly confined to retail. The 
shopkeepers and artisans supply the inhabitants of the town and

the agricultural population of the surrounding district, with the 
necessaries, and such of the luxuries of life as their respective cir- 
cumstances enable them to reach. 

The following statement exhibits the branches of industry in which 
the male population of the parish above twenty years of age are em- 
ployed. 1. Farmers, cottars, and servants employed in agriculture, 
365; 2. Master manufacturers, 6; 3. Masters and workmen in retail 
trade and handicraft, 703; 4. Capitalists, bankers, professional, and 
educated men, 113 ; 5. Labourers, employed by the classes, Nos. 2, 
3, and 4, 151 ; 6. Retired tradesmen, superannuated labourers, and 
males diseased in body or mind, not included above, 77 ; Taxed male 
household servants under twenty years of age, 12; above twenty 
years of age, 8 ; female servants, 480. 

Agriculture. — The plans and measurements of the large estates 
in the parish are generally of an old date, and do not give an ac- 
curate account of their contents of waste and arable land ; and it 
is equally difficult to get any correct knowledge of the extent of 
the small properties around the town. In stating the number of 
the imperial acres in the parish cultivated or occasionally in til- 
lage, and also what is uncultivated and under wood, it must be un- 
derstood that only an approximation to the truth is given, from the 
best information that could be obtained. 

Imperial acres cultivated or occasionally in tillage, 7000 
remaining waste or in pasture, - 3000 
under wood, _ _ - - 1500 

There is a very considerable extent of waste land, particularly 
on the south side of the parish, which might be profitably cultivat- 
ed, if sufficient encouragement were given by the land-owners, as 
lime works most beneficially on the new soil, and raises heavy crops 
of grain and grass. A common between the estates of the Earl 
of Fife and Mr Cuming of Blackhills has been recently divided, 
and though the westmost and most extensive part of it is almost 
inaccessible to wheel carriages, and no allowance given for build- 
ing, or for the land improved, beyond a lease of scarcely the ordi- 
nary endurance at a trifle of rent per acre, yet it is astonishing to 
see with what spirit the industrious settlers are bringing large tracts 
into culture. It is the general opinion that a sum of money laid 
out in making roads, in a very moderate allowance per acre for im- 
provements, and in planting, would be amply repaid to the proprie- 
tor, and make almost the whole of this waste a cultivated and or - 
namental field. There is no natural wood in the parish, and it has 
been already mentioned, that larch and Scotch firs preponderate 



ELGIN. 



13 



in the plantations, but not to the exclusion of hard timber. All 
the plantations are pruned and thinned with great care and regu- 
larity, and the thinnings sold for paling, roofing, and other pur- 
poses of husbandry. 

Rent of Land. — In 1828, the rental of land in the parish was 
L. 8520, and if the foregoing estimate of what is arable be correct, 
it will make the average annual rent L. 1, 4s. per imperial acre, or 
about L. 1, 10s. per Scotch acre. The best haugh land is let from 
L. 1, 12s. to L.2, and the light lands in the vicinity of the town, 
from L. 2, 8s. to L. 2, 16s. per imperial acre. 

Rate of Wages. — Farm-servants generally live in the farmers' 
houses, and the males receive annually from L. 9 to L. 10, and 
the females from L. 4 to L. 5, of wages besides food. Male la- 
bourers engaged by the day get from 9s. to 9s. 6d. per week, and 
women for field labour from 3s. to 4s. per week. Male labourers 
prefer piece-work when practicable, and if they earn more in this 
way it is by longer and harder toil. A carpenter's wages per day 
are from 2s. to 2s. 4d. and a mason's from 2s. to 2s. 6d. ; with the ut- 
most diligence weavers can hardly reach 9s. per week. 

Husbandry. — Thirty-five years ago the breeds of horses and cat- 
tle in the parish and district was of a very inferior description, but 
since that time much attention has been paid to their improvement. 
The best breeds of horses from the southern counties have been 
introduced ; and it may now be asserted that more compact, active, 
strong, horses are seldom to be met with than those in the posses- 
sion of the Morayshire farmer. The most prevalent breed of cat- 
tle is a black-coloured horned breed, resembling the Aberdeen- 
shire, though not so large, and, with much care and expense by 
the breeder, it has attained great symmetry and beauty as well as 
size. Some enterprising farmers have begun to cross this breed 
with the short-horned ; but the experiment has not been made for 
a length of time sufficient to determine whether the plan ought to 
be generally pursued. The few sheep fed with the farmer's cattle 
do not require to be noticed, but pigs of every variety of breed are 
very abundant in every farm-yard, and there are few of the poorest 
cottagers without one. On most of the farms in the parish the ro- 
tation of crops consists of a five-shift course, in which white and 
green crops, including two years' grass, alternately succeed each 
other ; and the agricultural implements are of the most approved 
construction. In the cultivation of green crops, there has been a 
wonderful alteration within a few years, from the application of 



14 



ELGINSHIRE. 



bone manure. It is now used to a certain extent by almost every 
farmer ; and Mr Lawson of Old Mills has erected, near Elgin, a 
mill for its manufacture. From fifteen to twenty bushels per im- 
perial acre, without mixture, will produce a heavy crop of turnips ; 
but, for a year or two past, a more economical mode of applying 
bones for raising this valuable esculent has been adopted, namely, 
by dibbling, and in this way half the quantity, or even less, will 
raise a very fair crop. In order to render the saving plan bene- 
ficial to the soil, the whole crop thus raised ought to be consumed 
on the ground by sheep, — a practice to which, one great ob- 
stacle at present is the want of a market for the fatted stock, — 
an obstacle which steam conveyance, it is hoped, will soon re- 
move. Wheat, oats, and barley, are cultivated in considerable va- 
riety in the parish. About four years ago the Hopetoun oat was 
first tried by that intelligent and zealous agriculturist, Mr Isaac 
Forsyth of Haughland. This variety does not suit light land, but 
it is now much used on rich soils, and the produce in straw and 
corn exceeds considerably that of any other oat formerly cultivat- 
ed. The Chevalier harley has been recently introduced, and from 
its superior quahty is Hkely to be extensively raised. 

The use of lime has been general for twelve years. On light land 
it ig apphed at the rate of 120 to 140 bushels, and on strong 
land at the rate of 200 bushels, or even more per imperial acre. On 
very light sandy soil, though the effects are visible in the green crops 
and grass, it is doubtful whether it will pay, but along the margin of 
the Blackhills and in Pluscarden it operates so advantageously that 
one crop or two will repay the expense. The farm-buildings gene- 
rally belong to the tenant. The house of the small farmer con- 
sists of one story, and is thatched with straw, — that of the more 
extensive farmer has two stories, is built of sandstone, and slated. 
The farm of Main, and two or three small Properties in the vici- 
nity of the town, are enclosed and subdivided with thorn hedges, 
but this species offence is too slow of growth, and too liable to acci- 
dent, and requires too much care and attention to be adopted by 
the farmer without encouragement from the heritor, which has not 
hitherto been given. The fields around the Abbey of Pluscarden 
have been enclosed and subdivided by the proprietor with stone 
dikes ; and similar enclosures, made a:t the expense of the tenant, 
are partially to be met with on that side of the parish ; but Mr 
Lawson's farm of Old Mills, near the town, is the only one com- 
pletely enclosed with this substantial and durable fence. Con- 



ELGIN. 



15 



venient and profitable as such enclosures are to the farmer, they 
are too expensive to become general, unless the land-owners were 
to defray the cost of building, exacting a moderate per centage from 
the tenantry. Extensive improvements have recently been made 
by draining in the vales of Pluscarden and Mosstowie, mostly at the 
expense of the proprietors. Much waste land in the parish has 
been reclaimed by frequent ploughing, harrowing, and liming, — at 
the tenant's expense generally, though in a few instances an allow- 
ance of L. 5 per Scotch acre has been given by the proprietor when 
the land is brought into proper tillage and limed, and for which the 
tenant pays five per cent, during the remaining years of his lease. 
The proprietor of Westerton trenched and limed a large moor 
some years ago at an expense of L. 12 per Scotch arce, which is 
now paying well. A small sum of money laid out in making roads, 
and an allowance of L. 5 per acre for tillage and liming, would soon 
bring some hundreds of acres of waste land under crop, which, even 
in these times of agricultural distress, would pay both landlord and 
tenant. Leases in general are of nineteen years endurance. On 
some of the large properties the farms are valued by an experien- 
ced person before being let ; on others they are let to the highest 
bidder. 

Manufactures. — There are eight grain mills in the parish, — a 
carding-mill for wool, and a saw-mill for timber. Thrashing-mills 
driven by horses or by water are in general use. A tannery and 
brewery in the town, and two distilleries in the landward part of 
the parish, are in active operation. The hands employed in any 
of these works are not numerous, and no injurious effects on the 
health or morals of the persons engaged in them have been obser- 
ved. 

Morayshire Farmers Cluh. — This club was instituted in 1799, 
and is now the oldest local agricultural Association in Scotland. 
The original members were most happy in their selection of Mr 
Isaac Forsyth as secretary, who engaged in the cause with all his 
heart, and, for more than a quarter of a century, devoted the ener- 
gies of an active and intelligent mind to the attainment of the im- 
portant and patriotic objects for which the Society was established. 
The attention and funds of the club were first applied to the in- 
troduction of new implements of husbandry — to the excitement of 
emulation among ploughmen, by awarding premiums after public 
competition to the most skilful, and to the improvement of the 
breed of horses by the purchase of one of high character and pedi-

gree. The advantages of the Association became every year more 
and more apparent, and it soon enrolled as members, not only the 
whole body of respectable farmers in the district, but also all the 
noblemen and gentlemen connected with the county. Annual 
cattle shows were then established, — premiums of large amount 
were given for horses from the southern districts, to serve for the 
season in the county, — for the different kinds of stock brought into 
competition, — for various branches of tillage and crops, — for seed 
grain, grasses, &amp;c. These premiums are not confined to the mem- 
bers of the club, but, with a liberality which has characterized all 
their proceedings, are open to every class of farmers in the county ; 
and certainly it is not one of the least gratifying effects of the so- 
ciety's exertions, that a considerable proportion of prizes for the 
best stock is annually carried off by the small farmers who are not 
members. The club has not been inattentive to another very im- 
portant object, namely, to the supply of the means of information 
to the members on those subjects with which it nearly concerns 
them to be acquainted. At an early period of the association, a 
sum of money was annually set apart from the funds, for the esta- 
blishment of an agricultural library, which now contains a valuable 
collection of the best books on every branch of rural economy, and 
is yearly increased by every useful publication on agriculture, as 
soon as it comes from the press. Since its commencement, the 
individual members of the club have contributed L. 2250 to its 
funds; and if the implements in use, the state of tillage, and the 
breed of stock to be seen even on small farms, be compared with 
what they were thirty years ago, the mighty alteration must be as- 
cribed, in no small degree, to the judicious expenditure of this 
large sum, and to the beneficial influence exerted by the society, 
in promoting the agricultural improvements of the district. The 
club still exists in undiminished vigour and usefulness. 

Society for promoting Industry among the most necessitous Poor. — 
The object of this Society is sufficiently indicated by its name. 
There is in the town a number of indigent but industrious females, 
whom the introduction of steam manufacture has deprived of the 
means by which they formerly earned a subsistence. A small fund 
is provided by subscriptions and donations among the members 
and friends of the society, to purchase the materials of spinning, 
knitting, and sewing, which are given out to these females to be 
wrought up according to instructions, and for which they receive 
the ordinary rate of wages. The manufactured articles are then 



ELGIN, 17 

sold, and the money dmwn applied to the purchase of more raw 
material. There are upwards of seventy aged and infirm females 
on the books of the society, who are either occasionally or con- 
stantly employed. They express their gratitude for the aid which 
keeps them from the degradation of begging, and seem very sen- 
sible how much the relief which their own industry thus procures 
for them, is superior in relish and respectability to the ordinary 
gratuity. A committee of ladies attend at the sale-room on a stat- 
ed day every week, to give out and take in work, and it is chiefly 
owing to their benevolent and active services, that the society is 
flourishing in the sixth year of its existence. Beyond the inciden- 
tal expenses, the annual loss upon the manufactured articles is a 
mere trifle. 

Produce. — The average amount and value of raw produce yearly 
raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows : 

Grain, - . L. 14485 

Potatoes and turnips, - 3603 

Hay, . . 292 

Pasture, - . 2920 



-L. 21,300 

The thinnings of plantations may probably amount to L. 100 per 
annum. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Tom.— There are no villages in the parish, and Elgin is the 
only town. It has been already stated that it is not a manufactur- 
ing place, and that the population are capitalists, professional men, 
retailers, artisans, and labourers. It has ten fairs annually for the 
sale of cattle, horses, &amp;c. and a weekly market on Friday for grain, 
poultry, butter, and other articles of farm and garden produce 
The small farmer generally sells his grain to the corn-factor, and 
the large farmer disposes of his barley to the brewer or distiller, or 
sends It with his wheat and oats to the Leith, London, and Liver- 
pool markets. Some years ago a considerable traffick in wheaten 
flower was carried on with Aberdeen and some of the provincial 
towns of that and the neighbouring county of Banff", but of late 
this trade has rather declined. There is also a class in the town 
called meal-mongers, who purchase small quantities of oats, which 
they manufacture, and retail to the trades-people and labourers. 
Police.— The magistrates have the superintendence of the police, 
i / 7 PP""  ' the burgh, and occasionally hold courts 
tor determining trifling debts and disputes concerning burgage pro' 
perty and for the trial of petty off'ences committed within the 



18 



ELGINSHIRE. 



royalty. Excise and small debt courts are held by the Justices 
of the Peace, but since the Sheriff small-debt court came into ope- 
ration, there is httle business before the latter. About five years 
ago, the chief magistrate, Mr Lawson Junior, and some other pub- 
lic-spirited individuals, laid before the citizens a proposal for light- 
ing the streets with gas, providing they would voluntarily assess 
themselves for a certain number of years, to defray the expense 
over L. 30, granted annually for this purpose by. the magistrates, 
out of the common good. The proposal was almost unanimously 
acceded to,— a gas company was formed,— a gas manufactory built, 
and the subsequent winter the streets and shops, and many private 
houses, were lighted with gas. The matter continued on this 
footing till the passing of the new Scotch Burgh Police Bill, when the 
inhabitants adopted the lighting clause, and assessed themselves in 
the necessary sum, but by amajority negatived the other clauses. The 
principal streets had been previously causewayed, and had paved foot- 
paths, and the town-council being chosen commissioners of po- 
lice, were appointed to enforce the provisions of the statute against 
the proprietors as to lighting, and the repairs of the pavements. 
No funds for watching and cleaning being placed at the disposal 
of the commissioners, they are not perhaps to be blamed that there 
is no nightly patrol for the protection of property, and that the 
streets are cleared of filth in a very imperfect and slovenly manner. 

Means of Communication.— The inland means of communication 
in the town and parish are very ample. There is a post-office in 
the town and turnpike roads diverging in every direction. The 
great north road passes through the town,— another turnpike road 
strikes directly south, and leads to Rothes and the banks of the 
Spey, and another north to the sea-port of Lossiemouth. The 
commutation roads to Pluscarden, Mosstowie, and Blackhills, are 
in good repair. The Lossie is crossed by one iron and three stone 
arches, the most distant not more than a mile from the town. The 
mail-coach passes and repasses every day, and a letter despatched 
from London through the post-office reaches Elgin about three 
o'clock P. M. of the third day. There are daily mail-gigs to Los- 
siemouth and Burghead. A stage-coach starts for Inverness every 
lawful day at seven o'clock a. m. and returns at nine o'clock p. M. 
Another for Banff at half-past five o'clock a. m. where it commu- 
nicates with a coach from Aberdeen, and returns at eight o'clock p. m. 
The Defiance coach from Edinburgh to Inverness passes and re- 
passes through the town in the middle of every lawful day. There 



ELGIN. 



19 



are regular carriers to Aberdeen, Banff, and Inverness, and to all 
the adjacent villages. On the other hand sea-carriage is both te- 
dious and expensive. The retailers in Elgin generally supply 
themselves with goods from the London market, which are carried 
in the smacks trading to Inverness, and landed at Burghead, if the 
weather permit. This subjects the dealer to an expense of nine 
miles of land carriage in addition to the freight, besides much 
delay occasioned by the trade only affording employment for a few 
such vessels. In consequence, light goods are frequently ordered 
to be sent by the steam-vessels to Aberdeen and forwarded by the 
carriers. The supply of coals for the town and neighbourhood is 
imported at Lossiemouth, and a good deal of grain is exported, but 
there is so little water in the harbour, that loaded vessels of small 
tonnage can only come in or go out at stream tides. The incon- 
venience and loss to the community arising from the want of a 
good and central harbour, have led to the formation of a Joint Stock 
company for erecting one at Stotfield point, a few hundred yards 
to the northward of the harbour of Lossiemouth. This spot hav- 
ing been surveyed and approved of by an eminent engineer, and a 
plan given, shares to a large amount were speedily disposed of; an 
application was made to Parhament and a bill passed last session, 
vesting the company with the requisite powers of management, levy- 
ing shore dues, &amp;c. and every thing is ready for proceeding with 
the work as soon as the season admits. If this undertakino- is suc- 
cessful, of which there is the most sanguine hope, it will be of im- 
mense advantage to the trading and agricultural interests of the 
town and district. A direct communication with London and 
other markets for farm-stock and grain by steam would be imme- 
diately opened, and merchant goods and coals imported at much 
less expense of carriage, and with great regularity and expedition. 
The writer has been led to notice this projected improvement, 
though in another parish, not only on account of its importance to 
Elgin, but because the present harbour and village are the pro- 
perty of the town, and because the magistrates are shareholders in 
the new harbour to the extent of one- fourth of the sum estimated 
as sufficient to complete it. 

Ecclesiastical State.~T\\e parish church, in the centre of the 
town, IS about eight miles distant from the westmost point of the 
parish, and nearly five from the south-east extremity. As three- 
fourths of the population reside in the town it could not be more 
conveniently situated. A missionary on the Royal Bounty beincr

placed in Pluscarden, very few of the country people have to travel 
more than three or four miles at most to church, and even some of 
these are still nearer to the neighbouring parish churches. The 
church was built in 1828, and can conveniently contain 1800 per- 
sons. Thirty-six free sittings are set apart for the poor. Four silver 
communion cups, the gifts of pious individuals, are the only bene- 
factions on record. There is no manse, but in lieu of it, the heri- 
tors paying stipend agreed some years ago to pay the senior mi- 
nister L. 50 per annum during his incumbency, or until they should 
build a manse. Each clergyman has a glebe of about four acres, 
which is presently rented at L. 18. The stipend, as modified m 
1808, is a fraction under fifteen chalders of barley to each mimster, 
and L. 5 for communion elements. As the sacrament of the Lord's 
Supper is dispensed twice a-year, it would require nearly double the 
allowance to defray the expense. It has been already observed, 
that there is a missionary in Pluscarden, supported by the Royal 
Bounty, by the interest of some legacies, and by the heritors and 
people, conformable to the regulations of the commission for ma- 
naging his Majesty's gift. This mission has been established up- 
wards of a century, and supplies the ordinances of the gospel and 
spiritual instruction to a population of about 600 souls, in the most 
remote district of the parish. 

The sectarian places of public worship in the town are nume- 
rous, and are frequented by persons from every parish in the pres- 
bytery of Elgin. There are two chapels connected with the United 
Associate Synod of the Secession church ; one with the Associate 
Synod of Original Seceders, an Independent chapel in connection 
with the Congregational Union of Scotland, an Episcopal, and a 
Catholic chapel,— the Catholic bishop residing in Enzie, Banff- 
shire. The ministers of these chapels are paid by their congrega- 
tionsin seat rents and collections; and as a large proportion of the 
people attending the chapels of the Secession church are of the 
poorer classes, their stipends must be very small. Dissent does not 
appear to be on the increase, and divine service at the Establish- 
ed church is generally well attended by at least three-fourths of the 
respectable famihes of the town and parish. The number of com- 
municants is about 800. 

Religious Societies.— Bible and missionary societies have been 
established in the parish for many years ; and the following is a pro- 
bable average of their annual contributions ; British and Foreign 
Bible Society, L. 20 ; Edinburgh Bible Society, L. 30 ; Mission- 



ELGIN. 



21 



ary Society, L. 24. Collections are also made periodically in the 
Established Church in aid of the General Assembly's Schools, the 
Indian Mission, and the funds of the Hibernian schools. The ave- 
rage amount of such collections yearly may be about L. 20. 

FAucafion. — There are thirteen schools in the parish, of which 
ten are in the town. The Elgin Academy is partly endowed, and 
partly supported from the town's funds, and the three schools of 
which it consists, though not perhaps technically, are in fact paro- 
chial schools, and most efficiently answer the same purpose. The 
trustees of the Dick bequest to the parochial schoolmasters of the 
counties of Moray, Banff, and Aberdeen, have not as yet admitted 
the teachers of the academy to any share of the fund under their 
management, but it is hoped, they will give the benefit of any am- 
biguity in the wording of the benevolent donor's settlements, to a 
seminary where education is conducted after the most approved 
method, with exemplary zeal and distinguished success. The 
school of industry and the free school of the Elgin institution are 
both endowed; four others in the town, two of which are for the edu" 
cation of young ladies, are unendowed; and one, an infant school, 
recently established, is supported by individual subscriptions and 
fees; — the other three in the landward part of the parish, are also 
unendowed. The branches taught in the academy, are English 
reading and writing, English grammar and composition, arithmetic, 
geography, practical mathematics, French, Latin, and Greek. A 
course of lectures on natural philosophy is occasionally delivered, 
and illustrated by a neat experimental apparatus, partly pubhc, and 
partly the property of the mathematical teacher. In the ladies' 
schools are taught, English reading and grammar, and composition, 
writing, arithmetic, sewing, geography, drawing, music, French and 
Itahan. The youths attending the other schools are instructed in 
the ordinary branches of education. The Bible is read, and the 
Shorter Catechism committed to memory in all the schools. 

The salaries of the English and mathematical teachers of the 
academy are L. 45 each ; that of the classical teacher is L. 50. 
They have no house or allowance for one, and the English and 
classical teachers are obliged by agreement with the magistrates to 
keep and pay assistants. The fees are, for English reading per 
quarter, 2s. ; reading and writing, 3s. ; English grammar, 2s. 6d. ; 
 Latm, 7s. 6d. ; elocution, mathematics, French, and Greek, 10s. 
6d.; arithmetic, 4s, ; a course of geography, L. 1, Is., and three 
sets of book-keeping L. 1, Is. The interest of L. 200 was bequeath-

ELGINSHIRE. 



ed by the late James M' Andrew Esq. of Elgin, to be given an- 
nually in prizes to the three boys in the Latin school who have 
made the greatest progress in the preceding year. The male and 
female teachers of the free school of the Elgin institution have a 
joint salary of L. 75. No fees are exacted, and orphans and the 
children of poor widows receive books. The house-governor and 
teacher of the school of industry has L. 55 per annum, and his 
maintenance and lodging in the institution. The teacher of the 
infant school has L. 25, the fees, and a house. The trades' school 
has a salary attached of L. 5 from the town's funds. The ladies' 
schools and one chance school depend wholly on fees. The school- 
masters in the landward part of the parish have each a small sa- 
lary and a house from the heritor on whose property the school is 
situated, and some advantages from the tenantry of the district, and, 
including fees, their emolument may fluctuate from L. 25 to L. 30 
per annum each. There are probably none of the young betwixt 
six and fifteen years of age of sound mind who cannot readov ivrite ; 
and the writer has not met with or heard of any person above the 
age of fifteen who cannot read, though there are no doubt a good 
many aged persons, particularly females, who cannot write. There 
are few parishes in Scotland better supplied with the means of edu- 
cation, and there does not appear to be any backwardness on the 
part of parents to give the advantages of it to their families. It 
is producing in a greater or less degree its usual beneficial effects 
on the moral habits and general welfare of the people. 

Literature. — A circulating library has been long established in 
the town, and contains an extensive and valuable collection of his- 
tory, travels, poetry, &amp;c. carefully selected by the proprietor, and 
to which he is adding the best works for general readers as they 
are published. A small collection of books, selected by the teach- 
ers, has been provided for the use of the students attending the aca- 
demy. 

A literary association, consisting of twenty members, was institu- 
ted in 1818 in the town. The object of this association was to 
procure at a moderate expense four or five of the best periodicals, 
and such books as the members generally could not readily find 
access to. The periodicals and books are circulated according 
to rule among the members, and are afterwards bound and placed 
in a library. The institution has most satisfactorily answered its  
purpose, and is going on prosperously. A small annual subscrip- 
tion has already supplied a library of nearly 700 volumes. The 



ELGIN. 



23 



members of the association about two years ago, connected with it 
a reading-room, suppHed with a sufficient number of daily London 
and provincial newspapers, to which many of the most respectable 
gentlemen of the town have become subscribers ; but the reading- 
room is conducted without any interference with the funds or pro- 
perty of the original establishment. The Elgin Courant, a weekly 
newspaper, is published in the town on Friday morning. 

Aims-Houses. — James VI. by royal charter, dated the last day 
of February 1620, granted to the provost, bailies, councillors, 
and community of the burgh of Elgin and their successors, the 
hospice or preceptory of Maison Dieu, founded for the aliment and 
support of certain poor and needy persons, with the right of patron- 
age of the same, together with all the revenue belonging to the said 
hospice, for the support of certain poor and needy persons, accord- 
ing to the original estabhshment thereof, to maintain and support a 
teacher of music and other liberal arts, and to answer and promote 
the affairs of the burgh, because the common revenue was barely suffi- 
cient. There are lands also of considerable extent conveyed by the 
grant for the same purposes ; but there is no evidence that they 
ever were in the possession of the magistrates, and probably the 
charter gave right only to the casualties of these lands, payable 
at the time to the hospital of Maison Dieu, the dominium utile being 
in the hands of lay impropriators. By virtue of this charter a Beid- 
house has been erected within the burgh, to contain four Beidmen 
having garden ground attached, and as far back as can be ascertain- 
ed these four paupers have each received annually four bolls of bar- 
ley, or about three imperial quarters, out of the rents of the pre- 
ceptory lands. 

Hospitals, Dispensaries, and Lunatic Asylums. — Grey's Hospi- 
tal for the sick poor of the town and county of Elgin, was opened 
for the reception of patients in 1819. It was founded by Dr Alex- 
ander Grey of Calcutta, and the funds which he destined to its 
support are adequate to the expenditure. The average number 
of sick admitted to the hospital during a year is about 250, and the 
average number in it at one time is 26. Dr Dougal, a medical 
practitioner in Elgin, willed L. 15 per annum for the purchase 
of medicines, to be dispensed to the poor. This sum was hand- 
ed over to the Trustees of Grey's Hospital by those to whom it 
, had been left in trust, and medicines and advice are now given 
at the hospital to more than 300 out-patients annually. A pau- 
per lunatic asylum, near the hospital, is just completed, and 



24 



ELGINSHIRE. 



will be supported from the interest of money subscribed, and a 
small board from the parishes who send the lunatics. It contains 
ten cells, and the benefit of it is confined to the insane poor with- 
in the county. 

Elgin Institution for the support of old age and the Education of 
Youth. — This charity was founded and endowed by General An- 
derson, and consists of three branches. \st. An hospital for the 
support and maintenance of indigent men and women, not under 
fifty-five years of age, of decent, godly, and respectable character; 
persons answering this description from the burgh of Elgin to be 
preferred, and failing applications from those in the town, then 
from those in the parish, and failing both, thenrom any other part 
of the county. Five males and five females from the town are at 
present enjoying as inmates the comforts of the charity. 2c, A 
school of industry for the support, maintenance, clothing, and edu- 
cation of male and female children of the labouring class of socie- 
ty whose parents are unable to maintain and educate them, and for 
placing and putting out the said children, when fit to be so, as ap- 
prentices to some trade or occupation, or employing them in such 
a manner as may enable them to earn a livelihood by their lawful 
industry, and make them useful members of society. Twenty-two 
boys and eighteen girls from every parish of the county, in propor- 
tion to the population, are reaping the benefits of the institution. 
On the death of two annuitants this branch will probably include 
twenty additional children. 8d, An establishment of a master and 
mistress, properly quahfied to conduct a free school for the educa- 
tion ordg of such male and female children whose parents may be 
in narrow circumstances, but still able to maintain and clothe their 
children. Of this class 230 children are receiving in the free 
school a gratis education suited to their station. 

Friendly Societies. — The six incorporated trades are in one re- 
spect of the nature of friendly societies. From yearly assessments on 
the brethren of their respective crafts, they have a fund under the 
management of each corporation, which they distribute, in whole or 
in part, among their poor and decayed members and widows. 

Guildry Charitable Fund. — This fund was established in 1714, 
and the members are all merchant guild-brethren. It arises from 
quarter pennies and admission fees of entrants. By good manage- 
ment and judicious investments in lands, of a part of their income  
always reserved, it has rapidly increased, and they now divide L. 250 
annually among the widows, children, and decayed members, still 

4 



ELGIN. 



25 



retaining every year a considerable sum, which is added to their sink- 
ing-fund. 

Cumininff's Beidmen. — Wilham Cumrhing of Auchray, by deed 
of mortification, 12th October 1693, conveyed money and lands for 
the support of four poor, old, decayed or broken merchants, being 
residenters within the town of Elgin, to the magistrates, and gave to 
them and his heir the right of presenting alternately. The inte- 
rest of the money and the rent of lands amount to L. 71, 18s. 9d. 
which is equally divided among the four persons admitted to the 
charity. 

Braco's Mortification 1729, of some lands to the town for the 
support of a decayed burgess, produces about L. 23. The Earl of 
Fife names to the charity. 

Petrie's Mortijication, of lands for defraying the education of 
six poor orphans or children within the parish of Elgin, is dated 
1777, and is under the management of the kirk-session. Each of 
the children receive L. 4 annually, and have the benefit of the bur- 
sary for three years. 

Gre7/'s the founder of the hospital Charity for reputed old 
maids of the town of Elgin. This fund amounts to L. 2000, and 
will receive an addition of L. 1000 more on the death of Mrs Grey, 
the donor's widow, the annual interest of which is divided among 
the daughters of respectable but decayed families. The two 
clergymen and physicians of Elgin are the patrons. 

Laincfs Mortification of a park of land, to be applied towards 
maintaining a decayed merchant, burgess, and guild brother, pro- 
duces a rent of L. 5, 10s. per annum. The nearest relative of the 
donor living in the county is patron. 

Ekjin Savings «w/e.— This bank commenced in 1815, and for 
the first year and a-half the amount of deposits was only L.212, 
lis. lOd. On the 30th May 1818, it was L. 478, 12s. 2d. After 
this it grew speedily into favour, for in 1820 the number of contri- 
butors was 222, and the amount deposited L. 2087, 5s. 9|d. In 
1824, the contributors increased to 492, and the deposits to L.4851, 
12s. Hid. From that year until 1832, there was a gradual de- 
crease of deposits, averaging annually about L. 150, which was pro- 
bably owing in part to the rate of interest having been reduced. 
Smce 1832 the investments have exceeded the sums annually with- 
drawn by L. 320 on an average. At Whitsunday last the number 
of depositors was 556, and the amount of deposits about equal to 
what It was in 1824, and during the currency of the past half v 



ear

ELGINSHIRE. 



they have risen about L. 200. The monthly transactions may 
average from L. 130 to L. 150 of receipts and payments. The 
investments are made generally, it may almost be said exclusively, 
by the labouring class. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of poor on 
the roll of the kirk-session receiving regular parochial aid is 160. — 
Of these about 30 receive a weekly allowance from 6d. to 3s. or on 
an average L. 3, 5s. per annum. About L. 60 are distributed half 
yearly among the remaining 130 poor, averaging 9s. annually to each. 
Besides this sum, they receive each coals to the value of 2s. 2d. 
and the interest of money and lands under the management of the 
magistrates for behoof of the poor, amounting to L.23, 7s. 6d. The 
amount of church collections 1834, L. 150 ; donations from one 
heritor, L. 5 ; other persons, L. 42 ; interest at four per cent, for 
legacies and other funds destined for the relief of the poor under 
the management of the kirk-session, L. 1365, is L. 54, 15s. The 
casual supplies to the sick poor on the roll, and small salaries to 
the kirk-officer and beadle, consume the balance of contributions 
above what has been stated as regularly distributed. 

No regular mode of procuring funds for the poor, besides that of 
church collections, has been adopted. The kirk-session, aware that 
an assessment on the heritors would increase at least twofold the 
applications for relief, have hitherto succe_ssfully laboured to avoid 
it, by a careful inquiry into the circumstances of the apphcant, and 
a timely, though small, supply. It is believed, that, generally 
speaking, the poor are averse to seek relief until driven to it by 
necessity, and that they consider it a degradation to be put upon 
the poors roll. 

Prisons. — The number of prisoners confined in the Elgin jail 
in 1834 was one for murder, one for concealment of pregnancy, and 
three for assault. The jail is an old building, and the prisoners 
cannot be said to be well secured or well accommodated. The ma- 
gistrates have the government and superintendence of it, and, in as 
far as they can, are attentive to the health, diet, and lodging of the 
persons confined. A new jail, in accordance with the improvements 
of the age in such buildings, will be very soon erected at the ex- 
pense of the proprietors in the town and county. 

Fairs. Besides the ten annual fairs held near the town for the 

sale of horses, cattle, &amp;c. there are two others in the town on the 
Fridays immediately preceding the terms of Martinmas and Whit- 
sunday, for hiring farm-servants.

Inns, Alehouses, §-c. — There are in the town and suburbs' 33 licen- 
sed innkeepers, 21 spirit-merchants, and 10 tippling-shops, and 
in the country part of the parish one inn or public-house. This 
extraordinary number might be reduced at least one-half without 
any inconvenience to the public, and with much advantage to the 
morals of the inhabitants. Too little attention is paid to the cha- 
racter of some who receive licenses, and there is great reason to 
suspect that those who recommend them are influenced by other mo- 
tives than the good of their fellow citizens. Many of the innkeep- 
ers are persons of good character, and to these the granting of li- 
censes ought to be confined, but there are others of an opposite de- 
scription, and whose houses are too often the haunts of folly and 
vice. The evils of the present system of indiscriminate licensing 
are too apparent to be denied, and an effort ought to be made by 
those who have the power to apply a remedy. 

Pife/.— Peat or turf is used for lighting fires, but coal is almost 
the universal fuel of the town. The prime cost and freight of a 
keil of coals from Sunderland to Lossiemouth may be about L. 15, 
and the carriage to Elgin, five miles, about L. 4, 10s. The far- 
mers on the outskirts of the parish partly burn peat or turf; but 
the cost of casting, drying, and driving is so great, that the use of 
coal is every year becoming more general among them. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The improvements in the agricultural implements, in the system 
of farming, and in the breed of stock,— in the education, dress, 
houses, and other comforts of the peasantry, are very strikino- and 
extensive since the last Statistical Report. The drainage,— the 
straightening and laying out of the arable fields,— the farm-stead- 
mgs, and the plantations, give to the general aspect of the parish 
a look of cultivation, and management, and prosperity, which, at 
the former period, it did not possess. The means of communica- 
tion are also most decidedly superior. It must be acknowledged, 
however, as has been already hinted, that there is still ample scope 
for improvement. A more general and adequate allowance from 
the land-owner for waste land brought under proper culture by the 
tenant, and for enclosing and building, should be granted; addi- 
tional roads and planting are wanted, especially on the south side 
of the parish. The progress of improvement in the town is also 
very observable : Forty years ago there were no turnpike roads 
leading to or from it, no stage-coaches, no gas-work, no lightino- 
or side pavement to the streets, no hospital for the sick, no in tt

tution for the support of old-age, and the education of youth, no 
academy, no printing-press, or newspaper pubhshed in the town. 
A large proportion of the houses have been built within the above 
period, and their external appearance and interior arrangements 
are vastly superior. The houses then occupied by the most re- 
spectable families of the place are now the dwelhngs of ordinary 
tradesmen. The improvements still wanting in the town are, a 
more efficient police, water brought into the streets and houses by 
pipes, and the removal of that greatest of nuisances, the shambles. 
Lossie water filtered could be brought into the town, at an expense 
which the inhabitants would not grudge, if they once had experi- 
ence of the convenience and comfort of having an abundant supply 
at their doors and in their houses. 

Some attempts have been made to remove the slaughter-house 
and meat-market, but hitherto without success. An intelligent 
and public-spirited citizen has favoured the writer with the follow- 
ino- observations on this subject : " On the advantage, and indeed, 
the necessity, of removing from a crowded neighbourhood and the 
centre of the town, that sink of impurity and danger, the present 
slaughter-house, there cannot be two opinions. The removal of 
the present meat-market to a drier and more airy situation is in- 
dispensably necessary to the comfort and welfare of the community. 
It is too confined, and so filthy, that the mistresses of families are 
unable to attend it, and have therefore mostly abandoned the im- 
portant duty of personally laying out the money of their families 
to the best advantage." This duty is generally devolved on ser- 
vants, from the cause mentioned. The shambles are the property 
of the town, and the magistrates must take the lead in any plan 
for their removal. Surely a central situation for a provision mar- 
ket, and a suitable one for a slaughter-house, could easily be found ; 
and if the town's funds cannot afford the outlay for erecting the 
necessary buildings, there is no doubt that, if a well-digested plan 
were laid before the public, the capital necessary would very soon 
be subscribed by a joint stock company. There is hardly any 
other undertaking in which the magistrates could engage, which 
would tend so much to promote the comfort and economy of the 
community, and to induce respectable families to fix their residence 
in a town so desirable on account of its schools, its society, and its 
climate. f

PRESBYTERY OF ELGIN, SYNOD OF MORAY. 

THE REV. W. LESLIE, MINISTER  



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — Lhanbryd signifies in Gaelic the Church of St Brid- 
get. It was united to that of St Andrews in 1782. 

Climate. — This district is subject, in the spring season, to"a suc- 
cession of storms called, in the common language of the country, 
the borrowing days, the Toocliefs storm, the Gouk's storm, the 
equinoxial, and the gah of May. The most unpleasant weather 
comes on about the last of these, a withering gale blowing cold 
from the thawing snow on the mountains of Norway and Denmark, 
and continuing steadily from the east, till near the summer sol- 
stice, equally injurious to vegetation and to animal life. The far- 
mer suffers every summer by drought ; it being computed that 
Moray and Nairn have forty dry days in the year more than any 
other county in the kingdom. It has by the rain-gage been ascer- 
tained that the quantity falling in the year is from 25 to 30 inches. 

Hijdrography and Geology. —The drainage of the Loch of Spy- 
nie, at the cost of nearly L. 10,000, is still imperfect; the outfall, 
at first on a level with the ebb in the port of Lossiemouth, was of 
late injudiciously made farther up the river, and without the least 
advantage, nearly a foot above that of the first level. 

Upon its southern banks, the boundary of the parish for a mile, 
the late greatly esteemed John Brander, on the hypothesis that 
the coal of Brora, at the distance of 100 miles directly opposite 
on the other side of the frith, might be found about the same 
depth on his estate here, bored 97 feet through abed of sandstone 
uniformly continuous, with the exception of a very thin layer of 
limestone at two or three different depths. This perforation is kept 
open and clearly indicated by a weighty stone put over it. 

The Lossie, having now by courtesy the title of river, though but 
a brook m its ordinary state, being in this parish the drain of about 

• Drawn up from notes furnished by Mr Leslie.

600 square miles, is nevertheless too inconsiderable to have been 
heard of in Egypt by Ptolemy, in the beginning of the second cen- 
tury, any more than its two conjoining brooks, the Lochty and the 
Lenoch, winding through their own dun hills. It is certain, that the 
Lossiein bygone ages occupied at different times different channels m 
its progress to the°sea. Embankments of earth to prevent the over- 
flow of a spet were formed partially along the lower grounds adja- 
cent to the river several years ago; and since the deeply disastrous 
flood in 1829 they have been improved into a style of magnificence 
and security on both sides of the river through the whole extent 
of the plain,— reared on a base of 20 feet broad, to the height of 
8 or 10 feet, where the ground is low, slanting upwards to a trim 
walk along the top, of 3 or 4 feet in breadth. In one very ob- 
structive bend of the river, a straight course of half a mile was then 
also opened, to the depth of more than 5 feet, in wideness more 
than 40 feet. After the first swell, which cleared out the new chan- 
nel, its bottom was found a bed of clay, in which ridges formed 
by the plough in the direction of the shadow at one o'clock, ac- 
curately parallel and equal in breadth, were to admiration present- 
ed, which being now scarcely four feet above the level of the frith 
during the flood, suggests several interesting geological consider- 
ations, relating both to the surface of this part of the globe, and 
the scientific state of agriculture, before that deeply interesting al- 
teration, which superinduced upon this corn field of clay, a bed of 
fertile sandy loam, over an extent of nearly 1000 acres to the thick- 
ness of nearly 6 feet ; when it was thus cultivated, the frith could 
not have been so far within the land, and even the German Ocean 
must have been then at a lower level than it is now. Secure, how- 
ever, as these costly embankments may be deemed at present, yet, 
if given up with presumptuous security to the burrowing of the 
aquatic rat and of rabbits, they will soon be found insufficient. In 
the excavation of the canal for the drain of the Loch of Spynie, 
there were six varieties of shells dug up, of which oysters and cock- 
les bore the larger proportion, with some specimens of a petrifac- 
tion called Belemnite, of which there is as little known of as the 
Cornu ammonis. In the beach which shut in the eastern end of 
the lake from the sea, such large accumulations of oyster shells 
have been found as to have been carted off for manure. In a new 
course lately formed for the brook which works the mill of Lhan- 
brvd, at the distance of seven miles southward from the shore, and 
more' than two northward from the hill in which its component 
streamlets are united, there was turned out a boulder of more than 



ST ANDREWS LHANBRYD. 



31 



a ton weight of blue argillaceous Hmestone, having its mass confus- 
edly mingled with a variety of petrified shells, in which the Cornu 
ammonis was conspicuous, and muscle shells bore the largest pro- 
portion. If this boulder had ever been detached from the rock 
of the same material at Brora, its transportation to its long undis- 
turbed bed here, not three feet under the surface of the globe, is much 
more difficult to be accounted for, than that of the celebrated dwel- 
ling transported entire from the eastern shore of the Mediterra- 
nean Sea, to the western coast of the Adriatic.

Antiquities. — This parish had the ci-edit of having preserved two 
Druidical monuments through all the mutations of nearly 3000 
years, until lately when, for the sorry purpose of forming material 
for a road, and uniting a little spot of pasturage to a corn field, one 
of these objects was annihilated. The other, at the distance 
scarcely of a mile, is nearly entire.

men of skill with adequate capital.

The rental of the parish is betwixt L. 3000 and L. 4000. 

Manufactures.— In this parish there is one public manufacture 
of malt. Mr Brown carries on the business of a distiller at Link- 
wood, having invested a large capital in the requisite buildings 
and utensils, all in the most commodious arrangement, and of the 
most substantial construction, in the malting, grinding, brewing, 
distilling, and in the store. The stills are respectively of the con- 
tents of 400 and of 170 gallons, manufacturing yearly 1200 quar- 
ters of barley, and producing from 16,000 to 20,000 gallons of 
fine spirit, consumed mainly between the rivers Spey and Ness • 
a small proportion only being disposed of in London, and in some 
ot the larger cities of this kingdom; the rivalry in brandy, rum 
and gm, being inconsiderable. But a formidable competition is 
maintained by the great distilleries in the south of Scotland, which 



32 



ELGINSHIRE. 



import a coarser and a cheaper spirit than, in the circumstances of 
the distillers here, can be produced. 

Where this parish presses so closely on the city of Elgin as to 
have the gentle Lossie only intervening, there are two other manu- 
factories,— the very respectable manufactory of wool, begun by 
Alexander Johnston, Esq. which employs about 50 people m com- 
pleting cloth from 4s. to Is. the yard, with blankets, flannel of dif- 
ferent" deorees of fineness, fancy articles, chiefly of wool, which 
are all disposed of mostly in the country. 

At Newmill there is also established a cast iron foundery, 
which, though upon a small scale, is of great convenience in the 
country, and receives increasing encouragement. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Ecclesiastical State.— The kirk is as commodious for the people 
as in landward parishes kirks generally are. About 400 persons 
form the ordinary amount of the congregation. The stipend is 
128 cwt. 90 lb. and 9 oz. of oat-meal,— of bear, 81 qrs. 1 bushel, 1 
peck, and 14 pints,— and in cash, burdened with the cost of the 
communion, L. 6, lis. l,d. All the families in the parish, ex- 
cept three or four Dissenting or Seceding, attend the Established 

Church. -IT I, 

Education.— endowment of the parish school, includmg the 
yearly interest of L. '27, 15s. 6d., bequeathed by a distinguished an- 
cestor of the family of Fife, may be estimated almost at the high- 
est allowed by the 43 Geo. III. cap. 54; and the accommodation 
is better than that act has provided. His fees may amount to 
L. 10 per annum. The people are all quite sensible of the ad- 
vantages of education. With scarcely any exception they can 
all read, and with few exceptions, they can write; although there 
are many who do not write often, and a great many also who add 
nothing to their stock of knowledge by their reading. There 
is no occasion for any other besides the parish school. Although 
not permanently endowed, it would be improper to omit the men- 
tion of Mr Barclay's private academy at Calcots. That gentleman 
teaches every thing requisite for our national universities, and for 
the business of life. The number of his pupils at present the 
sons of respectable families in other parishes is 27, in addition to 

his own sons. „ •,  , . i 

Poor and Parochial Fmds.Th funds for the poor, after de- 
ducting expenses, amount to about L. 36 yearly. The number of 

poor at present is 42.

PRESBYTERY OF ELGIN, SYNOD OF MORAY. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER BRANDER, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Na77ie, Extent, c. — This parish, the name of which is supposed 
to be derived from the Gaelic word Duhuisf' signifying " black 
lake," and having reference to the lake of Spynie now drained, or 
to some other lake of which no vestiges remain, extends along the 
south side of the Moray Frith for nearly 6 miles, and having an ave- 
rage breadth of about 3 miles. Its figure is that of an irregular 
parallelogram, bounded to the north by the sea, and on the other 
points by the adjoining parishes of Drainie, New Spynie, and 
Alves. 

Topographical Appearances.— Ahng the coast, and for half a 
mile inland, the surface is for the most part a meager green " bejitg" 
pasture. All this ground had formerly, it is believed, been a rich 
cultivated soil, but was overblown with sand from the western beach, 
at the same time probably that the large estate of Culbin in Nairn- 
shire was entirely destroyed by a similar calamity. The sand has 
long ceased to blow ; and a great portion of this space, as well as 
of land more partially covered, has been brought into culture by 
the joint efforts of enterprise and industry. All the rest of this 
parish is arable, and in a state of complete cultivation. It presents 
in its general aspect an entire and unbroken level, with the exception 
of an eminence called the hill of Roseisle, and an artificial mound, 
upon which stand the ruins of the castle of Duffus,— which two accli- 
vities serve, in a considerable degree, to diminish the tameness of a 
landscape, which, though at certain seasons rich and even beauti- 
ful, offers little of the grand or picturesque to gratify the eye of 
taste. It exhibits, however, what is perhaps better and more pleas- 
ing to the eye of benevolence, fertile, rich, and well -tilled fields, 
occupying the industry, and supplying the wants of many peaceful 
and happy families. In the western district of the parish the soil is a 
black earth, in some places a good deal mixed with sand, but in o-enp

ral of excellent quality and great productiveness. The eastward dis- 
trict is a deep rich clay, resembling that of the Carse of Gowrie, to 
which noble tract of country the plain of Duffus bears also externally 
a degree of similarity, wanting, however, its princely river and wide 
spreading groves,— grievous wants to be sure, yet not altogether ir- 
remediable, since the latter defect has been so far amended by one 
of the smaller proprietors on his ground, and promises to be still 
farther rectified by judicious improvements now in progress upon 
the estate of the principal heritor. The ground is in fact gene- 
rally too valuable to be devoted to extensive plantations; but 
the plan of hedging and hedge-growing, which imparts such rich- 
ness to many districts of England equally flat with this, would, it 
is thought, afford much protection to the cattle and the crops, as 
well as greatly embellish the district. This seems, indeed, the only 
improvement which it requires, and as pecuharly suited to it, it is 
to be hoped, that the system so tastefully and efficiently begun will 
be gradually and successfully extended. 

The sea coast at the east end of this parish is rocky, and very 
bold, although a mile or two west, it subsides into a level sandy 
beach, and contains some large and remarkable caverns, accessible 
on foot at low water, and which, it is probable, formed in earlier 
times a secure and favourite resort of those engaged in contraband 
traffick. Towards the west extremity of the parish, a small rock 
or promontory of land runs boldly into the sea, forming a conspi- 
cuous object in the navigation of the frith. It was formerly the 
site of a Roman fortification, and is now that of a populous and 
thriving village. 

Climate.— The temperature of this parish, in common with that 
of the county, is remarkably mild for its latitude. The superior 
earliness and warmth of the plains of Morayshire are such, that 
harvest often commences here simultaneously with that in the Lo- 
thians, and many parts of England. The climate of this district, 
compared with that of the neighbouring counties, and of Britain 
generally, is so genial, that physicians of eminence acquainted with 
it have declared that they would prefer it to Devonshire for the 
winter In the season 1829-30, the winter was greatly milder 
here than at London or Paris, or even during its brief rigor at 
Rome More is suffered from cold in spring, particularly during 
the first ten days of May, than during the depth of what are cal-  
led the winter months. Comparatively little rain falls in this quar- 
ter, though, from the nature of the soil, it occasionally lies long.

The wind blows almost three-fourths of the year from the west or 
south-west ; the east wind, however, is very keen and severe at the 
spring season alluded to, and occasional storms come from the north 
and north-west, but they are rare and of short continuance. It is 
difficult to say whether the existing state of the weather greatly 
affects the health of the inhabitants, though necessarily from their 
pursuits much exposed to the " skyey influences." Fever is the ma- 
lady which seems most prevalent amongst them ; pulmonary com- 
plaints are not uncommon among the agricultural part of the com- 
munity, but of rare occurrence among the seafaring portion of it. 
" It is a truth," says the former Statistical Account of Duffus, 
" which no mere Englishman will readily believe, that in this com- 
paratively rude part of Britain, the itch is less frequent in propor- 
tion to its population than in the British capital." It is a still more 
gratifying fact, that this loathsome disorder is now all but extinct. 

The Moray Frith bounds this parish on the north, and is about 
thirty miles in breadth betwixt it and the opposite coast of Suther- 
land. Its usual colour is a rather deep blue, varied by green where 
the bottom is rocky ; it often exhibits a luminous phosphorescent 
appearance at the approach of storms; but its tides do not rise high, 
fortunately, else the plains of Duffus, Drainie, Leuchars, and Innes, 
which He but a few feet above its ordinary level, would be subject to 
frequent and disastrous inundations. 

Hydrography.— There are few springs throughout this parish, 
and none of what are called " mineral waters," though the water is 
in several places impregnated with iron. One sainted spring situ- 
ated near the shore, and welling deliciously out of the pure sand, 
deserves mention, as a former resort of pilgrims, and still an ob- 
ject of superstitious curiosity to the peasantry of the county. No 
river, indeed scarcely a rivulet, takes its course through the'parish, 
owing to the flatness of the country; this is both very inconvenient,' 
and extremely disadvantageous to the people. ' 

There is now no lake properly speaking in this parish, though 
the loch of Spynie when full used to extend into it for a mile or 
two. Indeed, it formerly lay within so short a distance of the castle 
of Duff"us, that its moat was thence supplied; but in its present re- 
duced dimensions from draining, it is entirely without the bounds 
of the parish of Duff"us.

remam. Upon a gentle eminence, or rather mound, which bears

many marks of artificial construction, stand the ruins of the castle 
of Duffus, the ancient seat of the Lords of that name,— a branch 
of the noble house of Sutherland, which still bears the title re- 
cently restored from attainder though it now possesses no pro- 
perty in the district. It was a square tower about 20 feet high, 
and 5 feet thick, with a parapet, ditch, drawbridge, and other ap- 
pendages of a fortified baronial residence, and its date of erection 
is fixed in the reign of David I. who it is said, but on no good au- 
thority, gave a grant of the ground to a family of the name of 
Cheyne, which built the castle in this defensive form, because 
they had been guilty of some crime in France, which exposed them 
to persecution. The walls of the castle are still pretty entire on the 
west side, having been built with run lime ; and it appears to have 
been a place of considerable strength as well as importance, hav- 
ing been partly surrounded by the lake of Spynie, and no place 
within several miles having sufficient elevation to command it, — the 
surrounding country besides having been then marshy and diffi- 
cult of access. Its orchard and garden are still in preservation ; 
but the castle itself has long ceased to be occupied. An old woman 
was lately alive, whose mother recollected to have seen the cele- 
brated Claverhouse Viscount Dundee on a visit to the Lord Duf- 
fus of that day. 

Very indistinct remains of what is supposed to have been a Ro- 
man camp occur on a spot near the west end of the parish, with a 
paved road leading to it; but its outline and parts are so much ob- 
literated as to elude description, and no tradition exists to aid in- 
quiry on the subject. 

Several tumuli or " cairns" are to be seen on the heights along 
the shore, marking, it may be presumed, the graves of distinguish- 
ed warriors, but none have been lately opened. In trenching land 
on the estate of Inverugie, stone coffins have been occasionally dis- 
covered, containing, however, nothing remarkable. 

Some years ago there stood about the centre of this parish an 
obelisk, which was conjectured to have been erected by Malcolm II. 
in commemoration of a victory over the Danes under Camus, and 
near this monument there was a village called Kaim, which was 
supposed to be the village mentioned by Buchanan as retaining 
the memorable name of Camus. This village is now removed ; but 
the place retains the name of Kaim. 

But the most interesting relict of antiquity is the remains of for- 
tifications at Burghead, by some maintained to be Roman, and by

others accounted Danish, but very probably occupied by both na- 
tions. General Roy, in his learned and elaborate work upon the 
Roman Antiquities of Britain, makes Burghead the most northerly 
regular station of that illustrious people, the " Ptorotoji" of Richard 
of Cirencester, and the " Alata Castra" of Ptolemy of Alexandria; 
and supports his statements by correct references to its distance re- 
spectively from Jussis  Spey river,  and Barr is  Forres ;  and by seve- 
ral plausible arguments, he places Ptoroton at the end of the ninth, 
and commencement of the tenth iter of Richard; and mentions it 
as the chief town of the Vacomagi, and enjoying the privileges and 
immunities of Roman citizenship. A deep well, built with a regu- 
larity and elegance seemingly beyond the attainment of a rude 
people like the Danes, has been recently discovered, and adds an- 
other argument to these in favour of General Roy's position, which 
one is ready enough to admit, upon even slenderer grounds; because 
one would wish to believe that the spot he daily treads had been 
familiar to the footsteps of that imperial race, and would gladly 
confer upon a place presenting few natural attractions the charm 
of a reflected classical fame. It seems probable that the Danes 
who invaded Scotland about 1008, seized this promontory and oc- 
cupied it as a stronghold until they were driven from the country ; 
bestowing on it the name of Burgus, which it still retains, but slight- 
ly changed, being at present called " the brough" by the com- 
mon people. These old works were divided into two parts, a hioher 
and a lower; and presented no less than four strong ramparts built 
with oaken logs towards the small isthmus upon which the villaoe 
of Burghead now stands; in the gradual extension of which these 
interesting remains have been much defaced. The trench which 
insulated the promontory has in the course of time been filled up, 
and the rectangular platform at its summit lowered and partially 
covered with buildings 

Land-owners.— The principal land-owners in the parish are, 
Sir Archibald Dunbar of Northfield, Baronet, and his eldest son 
Archibald Dunbar, Esq.— to which family half the parish belongs ; 
Sir William Gordon Gumming of Altyre and Gordonstoun, Bart. \ 
Charles L. Gumming Bruce, Esq. of Roseisle and Kinnaird • 
William Stuart, Esq. of Inverugie ; Thomas Brander, Esq. of 
Roseislehaugh ; and William Young Esq. of Burghead.

According to the census of 1831, which was taken here with 
the greatest exactness, the population of this parish was distribut- 
ed as follows : 

In the village of Burghead, - 749 

of Port Gumming, - 1' 

of Hopeman, - 445 

of New DufFus, - 198 

In country and landward district, - 735 

2344 

The chief apparent causes of the increasing population are im- 
provements in agriculture, extension of the fisheries, and more ge- 
neral division of labour. 

The yeariy average of recorded births and care is taken to have 
all regularly registered for the last seven years, is 67 ; that of 
the deaths may be estimated at 14, though in this particular the 
registration is not so correct ; and that of the marriages at 15. 

In 1821, a year for which there exist the best possible data, the 
actual number of persons of various ages were respectively as un- 
der, 

Under fifteen years, - males 406 - females 382

And by the same return the average number of children in each 
family under ten years of age was found to be 1 nearly. 

The only families of independent fortune resident in the parish 
are those of three of the heritors, Mr Dunbar of Northfield ; Mr 
Stuart, and Mr Brander. The six proprietors already named are 
all and they alone are possessed of land of the yearly value of 

L. 50 and upwards. 

The people on the whole enjoy in a considerable degree the

comforts and advantages of society. Their general character is in- 
telligent and industrious, as well as moral and religious. No poaching, 
smuggling, or any species of unlawful traffic prevails amongst them.

No part of this parish remains in a state of undivided common. 
Little of the land which does lie waste would repay the expense of 
cultivation. 

Scotch firs in too large a proportion with all the kinds of hard 
wood, occur in the plantations which are with one exception well 
managed, as regards thinning, periodical felling, pruning, &amp;c. 

Rent of Land. — Some of the land is rented at L. 2, 10s. to L.3 
per acre, but the average rent of arable land, including pasture, 
let in potatoes with the arable ground, may be stated at L. 1, 6s. 6d. 
per English acre. 

Rate of Wages. — Labourers at farm and other work earn in the 
long day Is. 8d. and in the short Is. 4d ; tradesmen gain 2s. 6d. 
in summer, and 2s. in winter; ploughmen are boarded in families, 
and their wages are from L. 9 to L. 12 a-year. 

Husbandry. — Considerable attention has of late been paid to 
improving the breed of cattle, aided much by premiums offered by 
the Morayshire Farmers Club, — the breed being locally known 
as Morayshire, and somewhat resembling the Highland breed, 
but of more weight. The general rotation of cropping is the six-shift 
with two years grass ; but some of the strong clay land is wrought 
in a four-shift series with one year grass. Most farms are tolera- 
bly well drained and in a good state of tillage, and generally held 
on leases of nineteen years' duration, affording reasonable allowance 
and opportunity for improvement. The farm-buildings are mostly 
straw thatched, but substantial and of suitable extent for the size 
of the farms, and in general in good order. On several farms, the 
property of Sir W. Gordon Cumming, the tenants are reclaiming 
waste land by deep trenching at an expense of about L. 10 per 
Scotch acre. Lime has within these few years been extensively 
used as a manure by the more opulent farmers, and with decided 
success. 

Produce. — The gross amount of raw produce raised in the pa- 
rish is supposed to be as follows :

Grain - - - L. 17,613 0 0 

Hay, pasture grass, turnips, and potatoes, - 4,193 0 0 

L. 21,806 0 0 

Quarries.— The quarries which occur here are of sandstone and 
hmestone. The former are let for L. 60 of annual rent, while the 
latter average L. 27, 10s. and yield about 3500 bolls of lime sold 
at 3s. 6d. per boll Moray barley measure. 

Fishings.— There are three kinds of fishing carried on in this 
parish, viz, the salmon, the herring, and the white fisheries. The 
first of these is acquired by stake-nets erected at the village of 
Burghead, to the proprietor of which it yields L. 100 per annum. 
The herring fishery was for many years extremely fortunate and 
profitable on this coast, but has for the last few seasons been very 
unsuccessful. Shell-fish are not abundant, but the supply of all the 
ordinary varieties of white fish is plentiful and excellent. About 
eighty boats are generally congregated in autumn for the herring fish- 
ery ; and ten boats are employed during the year at the white fish- 
ing, the value of which may be from L. 200 to L. 300 per annum. 

Navigation.— Burghesid is the only port since the decay of 
Hopeman harbour frequented by vessels, and it is visited by per- 
haps 400 in the course of a year. The number of ships belong- 
ing to it is twelve, measuring 738 tons register, and amongst these 
are regular traders to London, Leith, Liverpool, Aberdeen, &amp;c. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication. — This parish is distant about three 
miles at its south border from Elgin, the market, post, and coun- 
ty town, with which it enjoys easy communication by means of a 
turnpike road at its west, and a good commutation road at its 
east end. A light curricle conveys the mails to the villages of 
Duffus, Hopeman, and Burghead, at each of which there are branch 
post-ofiices. 

Villages. — These just named, with another called Port- Gumming, 
are the principal villages in the parish of Duffus. New Duffus, 
on the estate of Sir A. Dunbar, Bart, is a remarkably neat, regular, 
and cleanlv village, the prettiest, probably, in the county, except the 
beautiful and picturesque little town of Rothes. Hopeman, on the 
coast, though regularly built, is extremely dirty, and its harbour 
has been of late allowed to go almost completely to wreck. Port- 
Cumming is also a stragghng and dirty village. Burghead is large, 
populous, andfor themostpartwellkept; itpossessesagood harbour, 
erected about twenty-four years ago, by subscription, to which Go-

vernment contributed L. 2000. Several large and commodious houses 
including an excellent inn have been built of late years; and the 
enterprising proprietor has constructed baths for the accommodation 
of summer visitors, who frequent the place in considerable num- 
bers. Regular communication with London, Leith, &amp;c. by traders 
and steam ships, a daily post and carriers to and from Elgin, com- 
fortable lodging houses, and pleasant sea walks, add to its advan- 
tages as a watering-place. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church, of which Sir A. Dun- 
bar of Northfield is patron,  is very inconveniently situated at the east- 
ern extremity of the parish ; which evil, however, is less felt, since 
the erection of a chapel of ease at Burghead. It was thoroughly 
repaired in 1782, and is still substantial, but, like most of the old 
churches in Scotland, constructed without the least regard to ap- 
pearance, comfort, or commodious arrangement. The reverse is the 
case with regard to the manse, which was built in 1830, and is a very 
handsome and comfortable house, with a most compact and con- 
venient square of offices at a proper distance. The glebe contains 
nme acres of good ground, two of which are occupied with garden, 
orchard, &amp;c. and the stipend is 120 bolls of barley, with the same 
quantity of meal, and allowance for communion expenses. There is 
a chapel of ease to the Established church situated at Burghead, 
the clergyman of which is paid partly by the seat rents, and part- 
ly by the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge and the 
Committee for managing the Royal Bounty. His stipend is about 
L. 70 per annum, and a house has lately been built for him by vo- 
luntary subscription. There is a Secession meeting-house in the 
village of Burghead, but not always open, from the scantiness and 
poverty of the congregation. An Episcopalian chapel, near Kaim, 
IS attended by a very limited but respectable congregation. Divine 
service is well attended at church, and also at the several chapels, 
but It were difficult, if not impracticable, to ascertain the number of 
families which resort to each. Fully three-fourths of the popula- 
tion, however, attend the Estabhshed Church; and twelve families 
are Episcopalians. The number of communicants at the parish 
church is about 400. 

Educatio7L.—T\ieve are in whole eight schools within this parish, 
four of which are taught by male teachers, and four by females 
Ot these the most important are the parochial school and that of 
the General Assembly at Burghead, both well conducted and at- 
tended, and affording instruction in the usual branches of education 

4 ' 



42 ELGINSHIRE. 

Latin and Greek, mathematics, geography, grammar, writing, and 
reading. The number of pupils attending the different schools 
within the parish amounts at present to nearly 300, of whom the 
two seminaries specially mentioned engross one-half. 

The parish school salary is the maximum allowed by law, and 
the school fees, bating those of paupers and bad debts, may amount 
annually to L. 12, or upwards, and the teacher possesses the limit- 
ed statutory accommodations, — with the prospect of sharing in 
' the Dick bequest." It is believed there are no young persons 
of competent age within the parish who cannot read and write, 
though many adults, especially among the seafaring part of the 
community, are destitute of these advantages, which shows that pa- 
rents and the people in general are alive to the benefits of educa- 
tion, and anxious to secure them for their families. 

Libraries. — The only pubhc libraries in this parish are on the 
itinerating plan ; one being already in circulation, and another ex- 
pected to be procured in a short time. There is a pubhc read- 
ing rooih in the village of Burghead. 

Poor and Parochial Funds— The number of poor receiving 
parochial aid is at present 81, and the amount of contributions 
for their rehef almost entirely from church collections, is from 
L. 50 to L. 56 a-year, to which the non-resident heritors have of 
late added liberal donations. The total sum, however, when di- 
vided, furnishes but a miserable pittance, the average being 12s. 
a-year to each pauper ; and holds out little temptation to the poor 
to solicit parish relief, which, with a commendable spirit of inde- 
pendence, they are still slow and reluctant to claim. 

Inns, c. — The number of small inns and alehouses often very 
carelessly licensed, is very great, and their effects on the morals 
and circumstances of the people are most pernicious and deplor- 
able, though not more so here than elsewhere. 

Puel Coals are the fuel chiefly used, with the addition of wood 

and peat, but th last is comparatively unfrequent. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The most striking differences betwixt the present state of the 
parish, and that exhibited in the last Statistical Account, are brief- 
ly these : A decided and palpable improvement has taken place 
in agriculture ;— the farms being now held on regular leases, well- 
drained and cultivated ;— the ordinary as well as the gentlemen far- 
mers being comfortable in their circumstances and dwellings, and 
able, consequently, to avail themselves of new improvements in farm

implements, to procure good horses and cattle, and to maintain 
them in good order, though at present the low price of agricultural 
produce prevents their realizing all the amendments in husbandry 
of which the exceedingly rich soil of this parish is susceptible. 
The roads have undergone wonderful improvements, having been 
almost impassable in winter twenty-five years ago ; but much still 
remains to be done in this respect, the facilities of internal com- 
munication being limited by the inadequacy of the commutation 
funds for making and repairing roads. Many waste places have 
been planted, and wood otherwise disposed for profit alike and or- 
nament. The draining of the lake of Spynie, from which so much 
was expected by the projectors, has ameliorated some portions of 
land in this parish ; but elsewhere has totally failed to fulfil the 
golden hopes cherished regarding it. The building of Burghead 
harbour has greatly enlarged that village, and increased the trade 
and opulence of the parish and county, — the herring and salmon 
fishery, and the extension of steam-navigation, adding also to this 
increase. A very great change has taken place in the circumstan- 
ces and manners of the people. They are now better fed and 
better lodged, less superstitious in their ideas, and more refined in 
their habits. Their houses and persons are more cleanly, and 
their dress more expensive and tasteful. It may be doubtful, how- 
ever, whether they are more temperate or upright. The very 
amount of the poors' funds proves the increase of wealth, exhibiting 
an advance from L. 15 to L. 56 per annum, and shews inter alia, 
that this northern parish has not lagged far behind the rest of Scot- 
land in her rapid march of improvement during last half century.

PRESBYTERY OF ELGIN, SYNOD OF MORAY. 

THE REV. JAMES MACLEAN, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

JSlame. — The name C/r'M/iar appears to be compounded of three 
Gaelic words, viz, oire, a coast, an edge, a brink,— /afZ, long,— and 
avihan, a river or water; and would seem to have been imposed 
to denote the great length of sea coast by which the parish is bound- 
ed on one of its sides. That his etymology is the true one, " ap- 
pears highly probable from two circumstances ; of which one is, 
that the name Urquhart is pronounced by Highlanders, when 
speaking Gaelic, Urachadan, which differs very little in sound from 
the three Gaelic words above-mentioned, when joined in one, and 
pronounced by a Highlander : the other, that the two Highland 
parishes of the same name are similarly bounded on one side ; Ur- 
quhart in Ross-shire by the Frith of Dingwall, and Urquhart in 
Inverness-shire by Lochness, — the line of coast in each being of 
very considerable length." 

Boundaries, Sfc. — The parish of Urquhart is bounded on the north 
by a line of sea coast 5 miles in length, extending from the mouth 
of the river Lossie on the west, to that of the river Spey on the east ; 
and an equilateral triangle erected on this line as a base, gives a 
pretty correct idea of its shape or figure. It excludes from the 
sea the two contiguous parishes, St Andrews Lhanbryd on the 
west, and Speymouth on the east, which two parishes meet where 
the parish of Urquhart terminates on the south. The barony of 
Garmouth, situated in the angle formed by the river Spey and the 
sea coast, was annexed, quoad sacra, to the parish of Speymouth; 
but the teinds of that bapony still form a part of the fund from 
which the incumbent of Urquhart derives his income. 

Topographical Appearances.— The sea coast, through its whole 
extent, is a sandy beach, with the exception of a small rock called 
" The Bear's Head,'' not visible at high water. The shore has no 
creek or landing-place capable of receiving or accommodating so much 



URQUHART.

as a fishing boat. The small lake, called the Loch of Cotts, hav- 
ing been drained about thirty-three years ago, there is now no lake 
in the parish ; neither are there hills in it deserving the name, yet 
the names of places would indicate that it abounded in both. It 
must appear somewhat strange that the elevation of places called 
Longhill, Broomhill, Lochhill, Gladhill, and Hills, should not ex- 
ceed twenty-five feet above the level of the sea; and that the in- 
habitants of Easter Lochs, and Wester Lochs should be but in- 
differently supplied with water even for domestic purposes. There 
is no river in the parish ; the only streams which run through it 
are three small brooks or rivulets, on one of which there are two 
mills, one for grmding corn, and the other for sawing timber i on 
another of them a corn mill has been lately erected by a tenant in 
the neighbourhood, as a speculation, and is sufficiently employed 
Thirl age being abolished, the tenants are at liberty to grind their 
corns at any mill they please. 

With the exception of a plain of about 2i square miles on the 
north-west, elevated not more than ten feet above the level of the 
sea, the surface of this parish is unequal and waving, but no where 
so steep as to render more than two horses necessary for drawing 
the plough. The general appearance of this parish is beautiful, 
the moors having been long since planted, and every barren hillock 
in the arable part of it covered with a clump of fir trees. 

Finfati mU.— Near the line which divides Urquhartfrom Spey- 
mouth, at a place called Finfan, there is a well which is resorted 
to in the summer season by a few invalids, not more perhaps 
than five or six for the recovery of their health. It does not ap- 
pear that the water of it has been analyzed, but its taste and smell 
resemble those of the Strath peffer spa, and its effects are said to be 
the same ; and it might have attained to equal celebrity had it had 
the good fortune to be recommended with the eloquence and zeal 
by which the late Dr Morrison brought the Strathpeffer spa into 
such high repute. General Sir James Duff, who till lately was in 
the habit of spending a part of the summer at Innes House, built 
a neat cottage at Finfan, and placed a person in it to keep the 
well and furnish water to occasional visitors. Sir James, while at 
Innes House, visited this well almost every day; owing to which 
circumstance, and the trouble and expense he put himself to re- 
specting It, It is now usually called Sir James's well. 
. . 11. — Civil History. 

Antiquities.-- About half a mile from the church, and near to 



40 



ELGINSHIRE. 



Innes House, the remains of a Druidical temple are still to be seen, 
consisting of nine tall stones fixed in the earth, and placed in a 
circle, the entrance to which, fronting the east, has a stone on each 
side taller than the rest. 

In a hillock, called the cross-hillock of Kempston, there was 
lately found a human skeleton in a reclining posture, with its head 
to the north-east. It crumbled quickly to dust when exposed to 
the air. 

A hillock, or barrow, on the farm of Meft, on being opened, was 
found to contain two very rude urns full of ashes and burnt bones. 

In the moor now covered with wood about a mile and a half 
east from the church, there is a rising ground almost entirely sur- 
rounded by a trench, and which, if tradition may be credited, was 
a Danish camp. Near it there is a hollow called the " Innocents 
Howe," where, it is said, that the women and children of the natives 
had taken shelter, and that the Danes, having discovered their re- 
treat, put them all to death. 

No vestige of the richly endowed priory of Urquhart now re- 
mains ; its site only is indicated by the name Abhey well, still given 
to the fountain which supplied the monks with water. Its ample 
possessions shared the fate of the property of the church through- 
out the kingdom in the reign of James VI. The lordship of 
Urquhart, the lands of Fochabers, and some other lands in this 
country, together with a part of the salmon fishing of the Spey, 
which all belonged to this priory, were seized by the crown, and 
granted partly to court favourites, and partly as rewards to cham- 
pions of the Reformation. 

Modern Buildings.— Inues House and the grounds around it are 
particularly attractive of notice. The house, a large, tall, irregular 
building, was for a long period the residence of the lairds of Innes, 
and is now that of Janes Duff, Esq. by whom it has been render- 
ed one of the most elegant and commodious mansions in this coun- 
ty, and by whom also the grounds around it have been laid out 
in' excellent taste. The only other mansion-house in the parish 
is that of Leuchars, a more modern structure, and much smaller 
than Innes House, but in thorough repair, and a most comfortable 
residence for the gentleman who now occupies it as a tenant. 

Exclusive of the barony of Garmouth, which, as has been stated, 
is not in this parish quoad sacra, and with the exception of two or , 
three very small farms on the eastern side which belong to the 
Duke of Gordon, the whole landed property of it was acquired, 



URQUHART. 47 

partly by purchase, and partly by excambion, by the late James 
Earl of Fife ; and, under a trust-deed executed by that Earl, has, 
since his death, been managed by trustees. 

III. — Population. 

For nearly a century previous to 1755, the annual average of 
baptisms recorded in the session register was double what it has 
been in the last seven years, and hence the parish must have been 
then considerably more populous than it is at present ; but proba- 
bly not so much more so, as the greater number of births would 
indicate, a greater number of children having died then, than die 
now, owing to the small-pox and other diseases not being now pre- 
valent, or having ceased to be fatal, except in a few instances. 

Population in 1801, - 1023 

1811, - 936 

1821, - 1003 

1831, . 1019 

The number residuig m Urquhart, the only village of the parish is 1 60 

of families in the parish is, _ 220 

In this village there are about twelve tradesmen, consisting of 
shopkeepers, masons, wrights, blacksmiths, shoemakers, and tail- 
ors, but these with only four exceptions, occupy crofts of land, so 
that the whole parish may be said to be agricultural. The annual 
average of baptisms in the last seven years is 18f , of marriages 5'. 
There is no register of deaths. 

Character of the People.— The people are shrewd, intelligent, 
industrious and well-behaved. They have all of them been taught 
to read and write; and though they cannot talk fluently on religi- 
ous subjects, they seem sensible of their obligations to live in the 
fear of God and in the practice of Christian duties. Their attend- 
ance on the public ordinances of religion is upon the whole regular. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture, c-c— The number of Scotch arable acres in this 
parish may be stated at 3100, and the average rent per acre at 
L. 1, 5s. The valued rent is L. 5567, 15s. 6d. Scots. There 
are six farms of more than 100 acres each.- With the exception 
of about 120 acres possessed by the villagers of Urquhart, in lots 
of from two and a-half to seven acres each, the rest of the parish 
IS divided into farms, varying in size from 20 to 100 acres. The 
number of tenants qualified to vote at the election of a Member of 
Parliament for the county is 21. 

The extent of waste land may be stated at about 200 acres 
and of woods, all planted by the late James Earl of Fife, at 2478 
consisting chiefly of Scotch firs. They are thinned annually by 



48 ELGINSHIRE. 

sales, partly of decaved trees for fuel, but chiefly of young trees 
for hurdles', and full" grown ones for rafters and deals. Oi late 
years, there have been planted annually in the parish from 20 to 
30,000 hardwood trees, but very few Scotch firs. The woods ap- 
pear to be all in a thriving state. 

Husbandry/.— The soil islightand sandy, generally of akmdly na- 
ture, and well adapted for producing turnips, potatoes, barley, grass, 
and oats, to which crops the cultivator till within these few years chiefly 
confined himself; but his great object now is to raise as much wheat 
as possible ; and, accordingly, an eighth, and in some instances, a 
fifth part of the farm is sown with wheat; whether to the advantage 
of the farmer upon the whole may admit of a doubt; his inducement 
to adopt this management appears to be, that wheat is the gram 
most easily and readily converted into money to meet the rent and 

expenses. , . 

The rotation of cropping most common in this parish is, ist, 
turnips and potatoes ; 2d, wheat and oats ; Sd, grass, of which 
but a small proportion is made into hay ; grass pastured ; 
5th, wheat and oats ; 6th, oats. When barley is wanted, it is 
sown in a part of the fifth or sixth lots, in place of oats; seldom 
m the second. The average quantity of grain obtained from an acre 
is probably not equal to what it is in some other parts of Moray- 
shire • but the quahty of it will bear a comparison with that of any 
grain'in the kingdom. The average produce of a Scotch acre 
may be estimated at from three to four quarters. 

The improvement of waste lands in this part of the country 
would be attended with no advantage to the farmer. Most of 
these lands are overrun with furze and broom, which it would 
cost a very considerable expense to root out, and carry off"; and 
the soil when turned up by the plough, would produce nothing if 
not richly dunged, which, obviously it could not be, without obhg- 
ing the farmer to his great loss, to stint his fields already in culti- 
vation of their usual allowance of manure. The improvement 
most likely to be profitable, it is apprehended would be, to lay 
plenty of hme on the land already under the plough, and to use 
bones as a manure for raising turnips. These substances have 
been tried in this quarter, and have answered remarkably well ; 
but the cost from 3s. 6d. to 4s. for a boll 128 Scotch pints of 
unslaked lime, and 3s. per bushel of ground bones, rather exceeds 
the ability of the smaller farmers to procure them m any consider- 
able quantity. 



URQUHART. 



49 



Rabbits, owing to the prodigious increase of their number with- 
in the last three or four years, have become destructive in no in- 
considerable degree to the wheat and rye brairds, and turnips. 
The measures taken for abating this nuisance by the gentlemen 
who manage this property as trustees, have not yet had all the 
effect that could be wished : and perhaps it might be well that 
the farmer himself were permitted to use such means as he might 
find necessary for protecting his crops from this sort of depreda- 
tion. 

Produce. — The average amount and value of raw produce yearly 
raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows : 

Grain of all kinds, . L. 7436 0 0 

Potatoes, turnips, - - 1854 0 0 

Hay, . . - 150 0 0

V, — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Toion. — The nearest market town is Elgin, which is five 
miles distant from the church of Urquhart. 

Means of Communication. — The length of turnpike road pas- 
sing through the parish is 2\ miles. County roads have been 
made where they are wanted, and are kept in tolerably good re- 
pair. There is no Justice of Peace resident in the parish, not even 
a Constable. To give a small matter to vagrants is found to be 
attended with less trouble and expense than to deal with them as 
they must often be dealt with in towns. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The only place of worship in the parish is 
the parish church, of which the situation is sufficiently convenient, 
its distance from the farthest extremity of the parish being scarce- 
ly three miles. The church is an old house, but in good repair, 
and affords sufficient accommodation for the population. The sit- 
tings may be said to be free, excepting those in a small gallery, 
for which the kirk-session draw about L. 4 of rent annually for 
behoof of the poor. A certain space has been allotted by the pro- 
prietors of the parish to each farm according to the size, for which 
the tenant at his entry pays at the rate of 9s. for a pew, which, how- 
ever, is repaid to him at his removal ; so that for six sittings, the 
number of sittings in a pew, the rent paid yearly is no more than 
the interest of 9s. 

The manse, an excellent house, was built in the year 1822. 
The extent of the glebe is five acres, the value about L. L 5s npr

acre; the amount of stipend, as modified in 1829, is fifteen chal- 
ders, the one-half meal and the other half barley, and L. 10 of 
money. The only Dissenters in the parish are three families of 
Antiburgher Seceders, and three of Episcopalians, consisting of 
about 25 individuals. The sacrament of the Lord's Supper is 
dispensed once a-year ; and the average number of communicants 
is 200. 

Education.— The parochial school is the only one in the parish 
at present. The branches taught in it are, English, English gram- 
mar, Latin, Greek, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, the elements 
of algebra, and practical geometry. The schoolmaster's salary is the 
maximum. He has a comfortable dwelling-house, and is paid the 
statutory allowance for a garden. The Earl of Dunfermline's mor- 
tification to the school of Urquhart of twelve bolls meal annually 
eight and a-half stone Dutch weight to the boll, is now paid to 
the schoolmaster according to the fiar price of the county. The 
amount of school fees does not exceed L. 8 a-year. 

Last year there was another school in the parish, but the mas- 
ter left it for a better situation. Another teacher is wanted, and 
in all probabihty will soon be found, to supply his place. The 
emoluments of the last teacher consisted of school fees, and an al- 
lowance of three guineas annually by the trustees of the late James 
Earl of Fife. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.—The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is thirty, and the average sum allotted to 
each annually is L. 1. In the course of a year, casual relief is af- 
forded to pei-sons not on the roll, to the amount of from L. 2 to 
L. 3. The annual amount of contributions and other funds for 
relief of the poor is as follows : 

Average of weekly collections in the church, - L. 24 0 0 

Mortification payable by the town-council of Elgin from land called the 

Shooting acres, - - " Ion 

Rent of gallery in the church, - - T c  

L. 64 in bank, reserved to meet a time of unusual distress, at 2 per cent. 15 7 
Donations, average cannot be calculated, but say, - 2 0 0 

L.33 19 1 

Applications for parochial relief are not frequent, and the circum ■ 
stances of those who do apply for it are so well known to the mem- 
bers of the kirk-session, that there is little danger of its being 
given to such as do not really stand in need of it.

gard to the dress and diet of the people, a considerable change to

PRESBYTERY OF ELGIN, SYNOD OF MORAY. 

THE REV. JOHN GORDON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography, &amp;c. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The extent of the parish from north 
to south is about 7 miles ; and from east to west about 2 miles, 
on an average. It is bounded on the north by the Moray Frith ; 
on the east by the Spey. The parish is formed of the two old pa- 
rishes of Essil and Dipple, which were united in 1731. 

Topographical Appearances. — At the distance of about half a 
mile from the sea, the ground rises suddenly to a small hill. Be- 
yond this there is almost one continued plain, of 3 miles in length, 
and about 1; in breadth, bounded on the side towards the river 
by a steep bank, from forty to fifty feet in height. The soil is for 
the most part light. The climate is mild and temperate, and 
the situation healthy. 

About the year 1800, the extensive moor adjoining Garmouth, 
called the Common, was divided among the feuars, the Duke of 
Gordon retaining a portion. Nearly the whole was planted with 
Scotch firs, which are thriving well, and have much improved the 
appearance of the country. 

II. — Civil History. 

Antiquities. — The only relic of the past in this parish worth pre- 
serving, was part of the house in which Charles II. is said to have 
signed the Solemn League and Covenant; but this was razed to the 
foundation last year. In digging in several parts of the beach at

Kingston, many human skeletons were found, confirming the state- 
ments of our provincial historians, that several skirmishes had been 
fought at different times in that quarter. 

Historical Notices. — The village of Kingston has, with the ex- 
ception of three or four houses, been built within the last twenty- 
five years. The first dwellings erected there were mere temporary 
wooden sheds, built bv Dodsworth and Osbourne, for the ac- 
commodation of their workmen, and by them named Kingston 
Port, after Kingston-upon-Hull;- and not, as Sir Thomas Dick 
Lauder states in his excellent history of the Morayshire Floods, in 
honour of Charles II. who landed here on his return from Holland. 
These gentlemen purchased the forest of Glenmore from the Duke 
of Gordon in 1784; and for many years carried on a most exten- 
sive trade here in timber and ship-building. I am informed that, 
subsequent to 1793, they built twenty-four vessels, two of which 
were upwards of 750 tons register burthen; two of nearly 600 tons ; 
the rest from 30 to 500 tons. Several other shipbuilders have 
during that time built 126 vessels, measuring from 29 to 200 tons ; 
of these Mr W. Geddie built 43, and he still carries on the busi- 
ness successfully. All these vessels were built of Highland natural 
grown fir timber, and have been found to last as long as many ves- 
sels built of oak ; and are insured at Lloyds and by the other Sea 
Insurance Companies on equal terms with vessels built of oak. 
The four large vessels above-mentioned were long employed by 
Government in the transport service ; and two of them were after- 
wards engaged by the East India Company in the India and China 
trade. 

Since the flood in 1829, the harbour of Garmouth has been far 
from good, nor can it be improved until the action of the sea shall 
force in, and raise the gravel bank on the east side of the river, so 
as to form a barrier against and yield a shelter from the sea dur- 
ing stormy weather. To attempt the erection of a pier is out of the 
question, as the channel shifts almost every speat, and the nature 
of the ground precludes the possibihtyof obtaining a secure founda- 
tion. A large quantity of gravel is brought down the river dur- 
ing every flood, and forms into ridges at the water mouth, often 
rendering access into the harbour impracticable except for vessels 
of small burthen. At present the ordinary depth of water on the 
bar at the lowest neap tides is only 6 feet, and at the highest 
stream tides 12 feet. Since 1815, the depth of water in the bay, 



SPEYMOTJTH. 



53 



for about two miles out, has diminished one fathom. This will 
give an idea of the quantity of gravel carried down by the stream. 
From beyond the bridge of Spey, the gravel over which the river 
flows is continually in motion, and rapidly descending to the ocean ; 
in proof of which I may mention, that several large stones, which 
formed part of the bridge of Spey, were cast ashore at the water 
mouth, four days after the bridge fell on the 4th August 1829; 
and the mooring anchor, weighing at least a ton, and securely fas- 
tened, as was supposed, in the channel of the river, a quarter of a 
mile from its mouth, was during the great flood carried out to sea, 
and never recovered. 

in. — Population. 
By the last census the population amounted to 1475, of which 
number 675 are inhabitants of Garmouth, 200 of Kingston, and 
the remainder in the landward part of the parish.

Character and Habits of the Feople.~The people of this parish 
are m general honest, peaceable, and industrious, very charitable 
to the poor, and in cases of distress disposed to acts of humanity 
They are active and hardy. The greatest part apply themselves 
to husbandry, to the salmon-fishing, or to a seafaring life. They 
seem to enjoy the comforts of society in the same degree as those 
of their station throughout the kingdom in general. Scarcely any 
change has taken place among the small formers, farm-servants 
day-labourers, &amp;c. since 1792, as to their mode of living,-with 
the exception of a greater consumption of tea, which probably 
arises from their being deprived of home brewed beer, a beverage 
of which they are very fond, and the want of which is the cause of 
much vexation particularly during harvest and when milk is scarce 
Ihe latter is often the case, as cows are kept chiefly for breeding 
In dress there has been a great change. Scarcely any of the men 
use cloth made at home, except when engaged in their daily la 
hours. On Sundays and other particular occasions, they appear in 
dresses of cloth from England or the south of Scotland. Amol 
the men hats and watches are universal; not a solitary bonnet fe

mains, but when at the plough or in the barn, a Kilmarnock coul 
may sometimes be seen. The working classes have been for some 
years subjected to severe trials from the want of employment, but 
they bore them patiently, and maintained their honesty and inte- 
grity. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture.— Extent of Farms, Rent of Land, §-c.— The farms 
in this parish are of very different extent, 1 exceedmg 200 
acres, employing four ploughs; 4 from 100 to 150, employing 
three ploughs each ; 7 from 60 to 100, employing two ploughs 
each; about 16 from 12 to 30 acres, with one plough each; be- 
sides, there are a few cottagers occupying from 1 to 4 acres, some 
keeping one horse and a cow, some a cow only. There are about 
60 acres occupied by the feuars of Fochabers, in the parish of 
Bellie, who have free access, across the Spey by the bridge at 
Fochabers, to their acres, which they hold from year to year. The 
rents over the parish vary from 20s. to 40s. ; the average may be 
about 28s. per acre. There are a considerable number of small 
heritors or feuars in Garmouth, who have feus of different extent 
on the lands of Garmouth, all holding of the Duke of Gordon as 
superior. The rents here cannot be so well ascertained, asthe great- 
er part of the lands are occupied by the feuars themselves. 

Hushandrij.—The five-shift rotation is in a few cases carried 
on, but the general course is the six-shift, viz. one-sixth in green 
crop, turnips and potatoes, all in drills, generally about three-fourths 
of the former, well dunged with farm-yard dung, sometimes bone ma- 
nure, which is found to answer turnips very well, but it is not yet fully 
ascertained if this kind of manure will be sufficient for the succeedmg 
crops of the shift. However, it is by far too expensive, considering 
the low rate of agricultural produce at present,— the quantity found 
to operate effectually being from 25 to 30 bushels per Scotch acre, 
at 2s. 9d. per bushel. This shift is next year laid down with wheat 
or barley, and grass seeds, eight lb. red clover, one or two white, 
one or two rib-grass, and one and a half bushels perennial rye-grass 
per acre. It then remains two years in grass, partly cut for hay, 
partly pastured the first year, pastured the second ; it is then in most 
instances dunged for wheat, and sown in the month of October or 
November. When the whole cannot be dunged, the remamder 
is sown with oats in spring. The sixth and last crop of the course is 
cpring corn ; the field ribbed in autumn to rot the stubble, then 



SPEYMOUTH. 



55 



ploughed in spring, and sown with oats or barley, as the farmer thinks 
the soil adapted. By this method the farm will be divided thus : one- 
sixth in green crop ; one-third in grass; one-half in corn. Lime has 
been in use here for thirty years, and is still now and then repeated 
when the land is in process of cleaning with green crop. 

Stock. — There are about 120 or 130 work horses. They are not 
heavy, but generally active. Two make an excellent plough. Breed- 
ing them to any extent for sale is not practised, as the lands are 
generally open fields ; but most farmers endeavour to rear as many 
as supply themselves. 

There are about 650 black-cattle. The breed is a cross be- 
tween the Highland and Aberdeenshire. They are very handsome 
stock when in good condition. A very small proportion of what is for 
yearly sale is fed off for the butcher. These when three or four years 
old weigh from twenty-eight to thirty-six stone. The greater part 
is sold when two or three years old to the graziers in Aberdeenshire, 
and other counties to the south. The dairy is not much practis- 
ed. The largest farms keep from eight to twelve cows. They bring up 
their calves, and serve the family. The farmer is more careful to 
have neat figures for breeding than to have them good for milk- 
ing. There are few sheep. Three or four flocks of about one 
hundred each are kept. Most of the farmers close upon the Spey 
keep from four to eight pasturing among their cattle. The breed 
is a cross between the Cheviot and the small brown-faced Moray- 
shire. 

JVauzVjrazon.-— Notwithstanding the disadvantages connected with 
the harbour of Garmouth, it is gratifying to know that, compared 
with what It was in 1792, the trade and shipping of the port has 
greatly mcreased. I have no means of ascertaining the number of 
vessels which entered here during any year from 1792 till 1816 
From 1st January 1816 till 31st December 1825, a period of ten 
years, 1863 vessels besides boats sailed, three-fourths of which at 
least were loaded with timber and grain. This gives an average of 
186 yearly. The following is the number of vessels which arrived 
and sailed for the seven years from the 5th January 1826 to 5th 
January 1833, as per Custom-house books.

During the ten years from 1st January 1816 to 31st December 
1825, the greatest number of vessels entering the harbour was 257 
in 1818, and the least 154 in 1822. 

From the pilotage book kept here, the number of vessels which sail- 
ed during 1 834 appears to have been 204, fifty of which were loaded 
with grain, chiefly oats and wheat, and carried at least 18,000 quar- 
ters to various English ports, and chief towns in the south of Scot- 
land. A large proportion of the remainder were loaded with timber. 
The rest sailed in ballast. During last year, forty cargoes of Scotch 
coals, equal to 3000 tons, were delivered here for various hme-bur- 
ners and distillers. Twenty cargoes of English coals were imported 
from Sunderland during the same period, containing 18,000 imperial 
barrels, and sold at from Is. 9d. to 2s. per barrel. Since the division 
of the moor of Yarmouth nearly forty years ago, till then com- 
mon to all the feuars, and supplying many of the inhabitants with 
turf for fuel, coals and wood are universally used for fire. Indeed, 
in many houses a peat or turf fire was never seen. There are 
twelve vessels belonging to the port, of from 29 to 84 tons regis- 
tered burthen, whose total tonnage is 685 tons ; and they are man- 
ned by 55 seamen. All the masters, with two exceptions, and nearly 
all the men, are natives of Garmouth and Kingston ; and besides 
these, several masters, seamen and ship-carpenters, origmally be- 
longing to this place, go to sea from other ports. With two excep- 
tions, all the masters of the above twelve vessels are part or sole 
owners of the vessels they command. 

Although they never enter the harbour, the Spey Fishing Com- 
pany's salmon smacks should be included in the Garmouth ship- 
pino- From 8 to 12 of these are annually employed in conveying 
salmon to the London market. From the best information I can 
obtain, 73 cargoes of salmon were last year shipped in whole or in 
part in the bay ; 52 of these were sent direct to London, the rest 
were sent to Aberdeen, and there re-shipped for London. Each 
cargo contains on an average 280 boxes, containing 1 cwt. of fish 
each, and may be estimated as worth L. 5 each box, taking the 
average prices of the whole season. 

Salmon Fishing.-The Salmon Fishing Company employ twelve 
crews of seven men each, and seven curers in the fishing department. 
Lat year the fishers were engaged at L. 9 certain, and were to get 



SPEYMOUTH. 



57 



more, provided the fishing turned out well. .They got L.13, 3s. each. 
Their wages this year are to depend on the quantity of fish caught. 
Two kit boats are employed to carry out the fish to the smacks in 
the bay, and bring in the empty boxes, &amp;c. These boats have a 
crew of seven men each, whose wages are not less than L. 8, for the 
period from 1st February to the end of October; but if the fishing 
is good, they have the option of being paid 2d. for each full box of 
fish shipped from the tug-net, or shifted or exchanged from one 
smack to another in the bay, and Ijd. for each empty box taken 
from the smack to the quarters. Salmon sells here from 1st Fe- 
bruary, when the fishing commences, to 31st May, at Is. 6d. per 
pound, and grilses at Is.; and from 1st June to 14th September, 
when the fishing ends, salmon sells at Is., grilses above 5 lb. at 9d., 
and 6d. for those below that weight. These prices are charged 
here even when salmon is selling in the London market under 6d. 
per pound. The rent of this fishing is L. 8200. 

Timhtr Trade. — The timber trade of Garmouth is now far from 
being what it once was. The forest of Glenmore was exhausted 
upwards of twenty years ago, and all the natural timber brought 
here since was from the forest of Abernethy, belonging to the Earl 
of Seafield, the forest of Rothiemurchus, belonging to Sir John 
Peter Grant of Rothiemurchus, and Glenfishie forest, belonging to 
Mackintosh of Mackintosh. There are three agents for the sale of 

this timber, and three individuals who deal in planted fir timber 

an article of comparatively recent introduction into the market in this 
place. During part of the late war, when foreign timber was ex- 
cluded from the British market, the quantity of natural fir timber 
sold here exceeded L. 40,000 Sterling yearly ; and even so recently 
as 1818 it amounted to about L. 30,000. Since that period foreign 
timber has been more generally used for extensive jobs, particularly 
in England and the south of Scotland ; and planted timber, though 
far inferior in durability and quality to the natural grown fir, is 
often preferred for inferior purposes, because of the difference in 
the price. At one period the price of the best fir timber was as high 
as 3s. 6d. per cubic foot ; the same quality is now sold here at Is. 3d. 
and Is. 4d. ; logs and spars from 8 to 40 feet long, and from 7 to 18 
inches diameter, are sold from Is. to Is. 4d. per solid foot, and small 
logs and spars from 9d. to Is. per cubic foot. Sawn timber, viz. 
scantling pknk and deals vary from Is. 6d. to 2s. per cubic foot; 
the two last are generally sold by the 100 feet, superficial mea-

sure. The sales for several years past range from L. 8000 to 
L. 10,000, to which may be added from L. 800 to L. 1000 worth 
of planted timber. The average number of floats received for the 
last few years does not exceed 300 of Highland timber; the aver- 
age value of each float is about L. 30, and the average floating 
money about L. 2, 15s. The floats received by the agent for 
Rothiemurchus' trustees are generally smaller than those received 
by the agents for the Earl of Seafield and the Glenfishie Wood 
Company, and consequently do not exceed L.2, 10s. for floating 
money; but the above average of the whole is very near the mark. 
Connected with the wood trade, from 60 to 80 persons are employed 
during the greater part of the year as labourers and sawyers. Wa- 
ges of labourers Is. 6d. per day, when loading vessels 2s. per day; 
sawing is paid by the 100 feet from Is. 9d. to 2s. 6d. according to 
the size of the timber sawn. No allowance of spirits is given, ex- 
cept on extraordinary occasions. Last year about 120 floats of 
planted timber were receivedhere, average value L. 7 ; average float- 
ing money L. 1, 10s. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

The great post road enters this parish at the bridge of Spey, and 
passes through the middle of it to Elgin. The bridge was finished 
in autumn 1804, and fell in part during the flood of August 1829. 
A handsome and substantial wooden arch was thrown over the fal- 
len part, and the bridge re-opened on the 5th December 1832. 
The mail passes daily, and there is a daily runner to Garmouth. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is inconveniently situated for 
the bulk of the population, standing about the middle of the parish, 
and consequently fully three miles distant from either extremity. 
The villages of Garmouth and Kingston, containing a large pro- 
portion of the population, are at the one extremity, and some small 
farms, together with many cottages, at the other. Few parishion- 
ers are within a mile of the church; but notwithstanding there 
are few country parishes in Scotland where the inhabitants are 
more disposed to attend church, or more attached to our national 
Establishment. There are not more than seven Dissenters. The 
church was built in 1732, enlarged and repaired in 1799, and is 
now in good condition. The stipend, by decreet of annexation 
1731, is 77 bolls, 1 firlot, 2 pecks bear; 32 bolls, 1 peck oat- 
meal, at 8 stones the boll ; and L. 340 Scotch. The glebe is 
twenty-five acres in extent ; but the soil is not good, and the crops 
on it, as well as on the neighbouring fields, are fearfully destroyed 



SPEYMOUTH. 



59 



by rabbits. The yearly value of the glebe per acre may be L. 1, 
3s. 

Education. — Besides the parochial school, which is situated in 
Garmouth, there is a school in the higher part of the parish, the 
master of which receives a salary from the Society for Propagat- 
ing Christain Knowledge, as also an allowance from the Duke of 
Gordon, who is sole heritor. The salary of the parochial school- 
master is L. 29, 18s. 9d., and his school fees may amount to 
L. 19 per annum. There are also three private schools, and, so far 
as I know, all the youths are more or less instructed. 

The Garmouth Sabbath school was opened in 1822, and in De- 
cember 1831 anotherwas opened in Kingston. By the quarterly re- 
turns rendered in February last, the former contained 108 and the 
latter 50 scholars. A Sabbath school library was established in 
1827, from which the scholars receive books once a fortnight as a 
reward for good conduct and merit as scholars. The Garmouth sub- 
scription library was instituted in 1823, and contains nearly 200 vo- 
lumes, chiefly approved standard works. The mechanics' library was 
established in 1825, and contains also about 200 volumes. These 
three institutions have been the means of supplying much useful and 
entertaining information, and have certainly created as well as sup- 
plied the taste for reading, which of late years has characterized 
many of the community. It is hoped they will continue to do 
much good. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of poor at present re- 
ceiving parochial aid is 43. The means of aiding them arise 
from the collections on Sunday, which for the last two years amount- 
ed to L. 33 per annum; seat rents in the church L. 3, 12s. ; half 
of the interest of L. 140 mortified money, the other half being as- 
signed to a teacher in the higher part of the parish, and the in- 
terest of L. 45 lately bequeathed. 

Mills. — There are three corn-mills, to any one of which the 
tenants may carry their corns. The multure paid is for service only ; 
and for the miller about one-sixtieth part, but the general practice 
is to pay the miller for drying and grinding, Is. for nine stone of 
meal. The feuars of Garmouth are astricted to the mill of Gar- 
mouth, belonging to the Duke of Gordon, paying one-thirteenth 
for multure to the proprietor, and some small proportion to the 
miller for work. They are likewise bound to assist in keeping the 
mill lead in repair.

THE REV. GEORGE GORDON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Boundaries, Sfc. — The parish of Knockando, or as it for- 
merly was spelled, Knockandow, derives its name from two Gaelic 
words, which denote Black Hill, or Hill with the Black Head. The 
parish of Ma Calen, or Macallan, is now annexed to Knockando, 
but no distinct record of union is preserved. According to Shaw, 
Knockando was a vicarage depending on the parson of Inveravon, 
and Ma Calen or Elchies, a vicarage depending on the parson of 
Botarie. 

Extent, Boundaries. — Knockando is of a long irregular figure, 
stretching along the banks of the river Spey, and extending about 
15 or 16 miles in length, whilst varying from 2 to 6 in breadth. 
It is bounded on the west by the parishes of Cromdale and Edin- 
killie ; on the north by Dallas and Birnie ; on the east by Rothes ; 
and on the south by the river Spey, which separates Knockando 
from Inveravon and Aberlour, in the shire of Banff. 

Topographical Appearances. — The external appearance of 
Knockando parish is considerably diversified by rising grounds and 
intervening glens, with occasional level haughs stretching along 
•the river side. On the northern boundary the ground is hilly, form- 
ing part of a tract known by the names of the Hunt Hill and the 
Mannoch Hill. In the western direction of the parish is an emi- 
nence called James Roy's Cairn, which is generally supposed to 
be the highest ground in Morayshire. In fine weather there is a 
very extensive prospect from its summit. Along the banks of the 
Spey the scenery is in general picturesque, especially at the man- 
sion house of Knockando, and the bridge of Craig Elachie. The 
hills are covered with various kinds of heather, and the banks of 
the river are in many places skirted with wood. 

Caves. — There are two caves in the parish, — the cave of James 
An Tuim, i. e. James of the Hill, at Dellagyle. This James An 



KNOCKANDO. 



61 



Tuim is supposed to be James Grant, nephew of Carron, frequent- 
ly mentioned in a well known pubhcation entitled " The History 
of the Troubles and Memorable Transactions in Scotland, by John 
Spalding, Commissary- Clerk of Aberdeen." The other cave is 
called Bane's Hole, and takes its title from Donald Bane,  White 
Donald, a robber of that name, who is supposed to have been shot 
and buried in the immediate neighbourhood. 

Meteorology. — The climate may in general be characterized as 
dry and healthy. The temperature is considerably colder than in 
the lower and more fertile districts of Moray, resembling rather 
the climate of Aberdeen and Banff shires. The west and south- 
west winds are the most powerful and prevalent, frequently con- 
tinuing for days and nights in succession, especially during the 
winter and spring months of the year. The snow generally re- 
mains longer than in the low country, and this may be easily ac- 
counted for from the hilly nature of the parish. The warmest 
part of the parish is the district between the Spey and the House 
of Knockando. At MiU-haugh of Ballintomb and Dalmounach 
Cottage, there is frequently calm and warm weather, when at half 
a mile's distance the storm is raging.

Hydrography.— Theve are a great many mineral springs 
in this parish, which might with very Uttle trouble be converted 
into excellent wells. On the farm of Bogroy, there is a chaly- 
beate spring, which contains a small quantity of carbonic acid, 
and a great quantity of iron. Another mineral well on the farm 
of Felochans, near the village of Archiestown, partakes much of 
the same ingredients. In the wood of Wester Elchies is the well 
of Topran, or the Sabbath Well, which contains a trace of sul- 
phuric acid united with soda, a small quantity of carbonic acid gas 
and salt, according to an analysis made by Mr Shier, lecturer on 
chemistry, and late assistant to Dr David Boswell Reid of Edin- 
burgh. The Topran Well affords a general specimen of the 
common drinking water of the parish. 

There are two small lochs in the moorlands, viz. Benshalgs, and 
Loch Coulalt, or the loch of the small burn. The latter is about 
a mile in circumference, the former not so much. 

A number of burns water the parish, the principal of which are 
the burn of Aldyouhe or Ault Gheallaidh, this name in Gaelic 
signifies Burn of the Covenant, and it is generally believed that a 
paction between two contending clans had been entered into upon

its banks, the burn of Aldarder, the burn of Knockando, and the 
burn of Ballintomb. Trouts are found in these streams. 

All these rivulets rise among-st the hills, and descend during rain 
with surprising velocity, overflowing their banks, and doing consi- 
derable mischief. During the great Moray floods of August 1829, 
all these mountain streams rushed down with tremendous force 
from their native hills, swollen to the size of rivers, carrying bridges, 
mills, trees, &amp;c. before them to the Spey.  

There are several pretty little waterfalls over some of the burns, 
especially those of Knockando, Aldyouhe, Aldarder, and Ballin- 
tomb. One romantic fall is caused by the junction of two burns 
beside the glebe, the view of which, as seen from the rustic bridge 
of Poolflasgan in the immediate vicinity, is very picturesque. 

The Spey is the only river in the parish, and is the most rapid 
as well as one of the largest in Scotland. It flows through the 
whole length of the parish, from the Cromdale boundary on the 
west, to the Rothes boundary on the east, a little beneath Craig 
Elachie Bridge. The velocity of the Spey may be stated at four 
to four and a-half miles per hour. A number of rafts of timber 
pass down the river during the floating season, from the forests of 
Rothiemurchus and Abernethy. In this parish is the rock of Tom- 
dow, the most dangerous place for floats in the course of the river. 
During the flood of 1829, this rapid and powerful river occasion- 
ed great damage in this as well as in many other parishes along its 
banks. On the lands of Kirdals, belonging to Mr Grant of Bal- 

Great Floods of August 1829, in the FroincfSoayl

lindalloch, the house and offices of one subtenant were complete- 
ly swept away, and the ground covered with sand to a considerable 
depth. The following will suffice for specimens of damage on the 
estate of Mr Grant of Wester Elchies :— On the Broom Isle, 3 
acres covered with sand to the depth of 2 feet; 7 acres, do. H 
feet ; 6 acres, do. 1 foot ; 1 acre, do. 3 feet ; 4 acres, do. 15 inches. 
—On the Haugh of Wester Elchies, 5 acres, 2 of which average 4 
feet of sand, and 3 do. 1 foot ; 3 acres, do. 3 feet of sand and 
gravel; 5 acres, do. H feet; 1 acre, do. 2i.— On the Haughs of 
Dellagvle and Dellowlie, 4 acres, averaging 2 feet. On the Boat- 
man's Haugh, 1 acre, averaging 3 feet. The appearance of the 
country on this memorable occasion was awfully grand, and will 
lono- be remembered in Knockando. 

Geology and Mineralogy.— The rocks are all primitive, and 
consist of granite, felspar, mica, sandstone, slate, gravel, and rock 
crystal. There is a considerable variety of soil. Near the river it 
isWndy ; higher up, black gravelly mould; still higher up, a heavy 
clay soil, and near the hills, mossy. In some places the substra- 
tum is clay, in others gravel. The alluvial deposits consist of clay, 
bog iron ore, peat, fuller's earth, and marl. The mosses are of 
considerable extent ; the chief are, Milton, Monahoudie, and Man- 
noch. Oak and fir roots, and sometimes whole trees, have been 
found imbedded in the mosses, and in all probability have lain 
there concealed for ages. Hazel-nuts have also been found at the 
depth of twelve feet. From which circumstances, there is oonsider- 
able reason for supposing that the country had at one period been 
covered with wood. Neither coal nor lime have been found in the 
parish. There is a small vein of slate, from which stones have oc- 
casionally been taken, and which is capable of being wrought. 

Zoology. The only rare animals are a few Thibet sheep at 

Wester Elchies, sent home from India by Mr Grant. They do 
not appear to thrive well in this part of the country, owing, as is 
thouo-ht, to the damp of the climate. The cross breed, however, 
have'succeeded well, and afford excellent mutton, and lamb of the 
most delicate quality. The wool has degenerated ; but is still of 
a very soft texture, and superior to the common. 

Amongst the animals commonly found in the parish may be 
mentioned the roe-deer, which frequents the woods of Wester El- 
chies during winter; the fox, polecat {Mustela putorius, weasel 
M. vulgaris, rabbit {Lepus cuniculus, blue, white, and brown

to breed. Game birds are rather decreasing than otherwise in 
this part of the country. Amongst other birds may be mention- 
ed the eagle, as sometimes seen when passing to his eyrie, perched 
on the summit of the lofty Ben Avon, or the " high Cairngorum."

Ichthyologij.—The Spey is one of the most productive fishing 
rivers in Scotland, and a high rent is annually paid for the fishings 
at its mouth. Owing to stake-nets and cruives being employed far- 
ther down, the salmon fishing in this parish has much decreased of 
late years. There is still, however, occasionally excellent sport for 
the angler, and in the Spey are to be found white trout; finnock 
and flounder are also to be numbered amongst the inhabitants of 
the river. Excellent trouts are found in the larger burns of the 
parish. The fly, the bait, the bag-net, and the clip, are all em- 
ployed by anglers, and sometimes the spear is put into operation 
during a blaze by torch-light. 

Botany. — The parish of Knockando aff'ords an excellent field 
for the study of botany. " The moorland harebells beautiful " 
are very plentiful ; the forget-me-not, that " little modest flower, 
to friendship ever dear," is not awanting; the anemone, " child of 
the wind," adorns the woods and plantations ; " the violet blue, 
that on the moss bank grows," is by no means uncommon ; the 
primrose presents itself in great abundance, and in rich profusion 
scattered around, the " wee, modest, crimson-tipped flower, daisy," 
rears its gentle head. The honeysuckle, the wild rose, and the 
foxglove, court the shade of the woods, and the heather rejoices 
in the moors and uplands. Along the beautiful banks of the burns 
of Knockando and Ballintomb will be found plants and flowers 
almost 



beyond the power 



Of botanist to number up their tribes." 

Amidst these sequestered dells may the student of botany gather 
each flower of the rock, when " ilka cowslip cup has kepp'd a 
tear," and explore the varied phenomena by which he is surround- 
ed. Amongst the rarer plants may be mentioned Ranunculus au- 
ricomus wood ranunculus; Hippuris vulgaris mare's-tail; Ve- 
ronica Anagallis water speedwell ; V. montana mountain do. ; 
Poa decumhens decumbent meadow-grass; Briza media quak- 
ing grass. 

The heath consists of three kinds, viz. Calluna vulgaris com- 
mon heath; Erica Tetralix cross-leaved heath; and E. cinerea 

fine-leaved heath. 

The fruits are as follows -.— Vaccinium Myrtillus blae-berry or 
whortleberry; Fragaria strawberry; Ruhus fruticosus bramble 
or black-berry; R. idaus raspberry; Berheris vulgaris bar-

chiestovvn, are the chief. The wood of Dalballie was all cut down 
a few years ago. In the year 1830, Mr M'Pherson Grant plant- 
ed about 430 acres of hill pasture on the estate of Kirdals with 
larches and Scotch firs, and in 1834 he commenced a similar plan- 
tation of nearly the same extent. 

Trees,— In the garden of Knockando House are three old ash 
trees, measuring severally in circumference 11 feet 3 inches 9 feet 
5 inches, and 7 feet 5 inches. During the spring of 1834, a larch 
tree, 73 feet in length, which stood in the wood of Knockando 
was blown down by the force of the wind in a tremendous hurri- 
Tw trees are to be found in the garden 

of Wester Elchies, viz. an apple tree, which extends along a brick 
wall for the space of 78 feet in length by 11 in height, and a geen 
tree which measures 10 feet in circumference, the branches over- 
hanging a circular space of considerable extent. In the vicinity of 
the same garden is a silver fir, which measures 6 feet 7 inches in 
circumference. Scotch firs and larches are the chief trees in the 
plantations, and appear to thrive better than any others. "The na 
tura wood consists principally of birch. At Wester Elchies are 
two Wge walnut trees, which in fine seasons generally yield plenty

down to future generations as the greatest historical event con- 
nected with the annals of Knockando.— A place called Camp- 
bell's Cairns is supposed by some to derive its name from bemg the 
scene of battle between the Campbells and some other clan, m 
which the Campbells were defeated ; whilst others mamtam that 
the place is so called from Cossack Dhu, a freebooter of the old- 
en time, who was said to have concealed his booty among the 



canns.

Parochial Registers.— In consequence of a fire breakmg out ni 
the village of Archiestown on the 17th April 1783, the house of 
the session-clerk was burned, and three volumes of session records 
were consumed, commencing in 1712, and ending in 1767. Ihe 
testamentary book, and the register of baptisms and marriages, 
commencing in the year 1768, were fortunately preserved. Since 
1783, books have been kept containing accounts of the ordinary 
collections, distributions to the poor, and general session business, 
as hkewise registers of baptisms and marriages. The baptismal 
yegister is by no means complete, owing to parents having neglect- 
ed to have their children's names inserted. -Within the last few 
years, however, the register has been more accurate from the mea- 
sures' adopted to enforce registration. No record of deaths or fu- 
nerals appears to have been kept until the year 1834, when the 
present minister commenced a private register. 

Antiquities.— In the church-yard of Macallan, a small part of 
the church wall is still standing, but gradually mouldering away, 
and it is probable that ere long scarcely a vestige will remam. 
There are two or three places in the parish where chapels or re- 
ligious houses are supposed to have stood. About eighteen years 
ago there was found in the cave of James an Tuim, a dirk sup- 
posed to have belonged to that individual. The belt and buckle 
immediately crumbled to atoms on being touched. The handle 
appeared to have been composed of deer's horn ; only a small part 
of it was entire. This dirk passed into the possession of Lewis 
Inkson, Esq., London, and is understood to have been deposited 
bv him' in one of the Museums of that city. 

A small Danish battle axe of copper, found on the farm of 
Milton, and two small dirks picked up a few years ago, are m the 
possession of William Grant, Esq., younger of Wester Elchies. 
Two small coins of the reign of Charles II., were found last year 
in the western end of the parish, but unfortunately were sold by 
the finder, for the small sum of Is. 6d. On the farm of Ballin-

tuim are three large stones, supposed to have formed part of the 
ruins of a Druid's temple. A human skeleton was dug up some 
years ago near the Mains of Kirdals, and reinterred in the same 
spot. 

Occurrences of Note. — The chief occurrences of note are those 
connected with the great flood of 1829, previously referred to, 
and which event is now interwoven with the history of Morayland. 
It may here be mentioned, that a very singular place was formed 
at that memorable period by the burn of Aldarder, where there 
formerly was a waterfall 80 feet in height. At that time the burn 
changed its course, dashing with tremendous force over the top of 
a small hill, which it speedily undermined, and a chasm is now left 
of considerable extent. No measurement has been taken, but the 
ravine may probably vary from 200 to 300 ells in breadth, the 
banks on each side being from 60 to 100 feet in height. The 
waterfall was destroyed, and is now reduced to 6 or 8 feet, in the 
form of an inclined plane. 

Land-owners. — There are three heritors, viz. James William 
Grant, Esq. of Wester Elchies ; George M'Pherson Grant, Esq. 
of Ballindalloch and Invereshie ; and the Right Honourable the 
Earl of Seafield. Mr Grant of Wester Elchies, the chief heritor, 
holds a civil appointment in Bengal ; his family are resident in the 
parish, at the house of Wester Elchies. The Earl of Seafield 
possesses the lands of Easter Elchies. Mr Grant of Ballindalloch 
possesses Kirdals ; and Mr Grant of Wester Elchies, Knockando, 
Ballintomb, and Wester Elchies. All the heritors have likewise 
property in other parishes. 

Eminent Persons. — Lord Elchies, a distinguished Scottish judge, 
was born, and occasionally resided in the house of Easter Elchies. 
The Messrs Grant of Manchester, who by their own industry have 
established one of the most extensive mercantile establishments in 
the west of England, are natives of this parish. The late Sir 
William Grant, Master of the Rolls, was nearly related to the Elchies 
family. 

Several young men have gone from this parish to the East and 
West Indies, and having realized property, have returned to their 
native land, and it is to be hoped will not again forsake their na- 
tive hills. Others have settled in various places, and prospered in 
the world. 

Modern Buildings. — The mansion-house of Wester Elchies, 
which is situated on an elevated position commanding an extensive

prospect, was originally an outpost of Castle Grant in Inverness- 
shire. From the various additions which this mansion has receiv- 
ed, it is now a large building, partly in the old manorial, and part- 
ly in the castellated style, still retaining in some of the cellars, 
small windows and gun ports, used for defence in former ages. In 
the entrance-hall are preserved some chairs from the ancient castle 
of Rothes, marked with an Earl's coronet, and supposed to be 
some centuries old. 

The house of Knockando was built in the year 1732, and is a 
plain edifice, consisting of a main building and a wing on each side- 
It is now occupied by three families ; part is considerably dilapi- 
dated, but the whole is capable of repair. Knockando House is 
beautifully situated near the bank of the Spey, and surrounded by 
wood. The walk in this direction is exceedingly picturesque and 
beautiful.

The landscape stretches far and wide, presenting varied aspects 
of Highland scenery, hill and dale, wood and water, rock and glen, 
blending harmoniously together in the vicinity, whilst the lofty 
summits of Ben Avon and Cairngorum are blue in the distance. 
— In the midst of wild yet simple scenery, 

" Far up the windings of the stream, 

Where birken witch-knots o'er the channel meet," 

stands Glengunnery, or the cottage of the Clune. This dwelling, 
built of wood and thatched with heather, was erected in the year 
1827 as a shooting lodge, by the late Charles Grant, Esq. of 
Wester Elchies. The cottage contains thirteen apartments of va- - 
rious sizes; it was for some time inhabited by Ian Stewart, who 
during his residence fitted up the building in a style tastefully 
characteristic of the days of " auld lang syne." A young planta- 
tion is now rising around this romantic and sequestered spot, si- 
tuated on the bank of the Knockando burn. 

The mansion house of Easter Elchies, which consists of three 
stories, was erected in the year 1700, by the father of the late 
Lord Elchies, Captain John Grant, who distinguished himself at 
the battle of Cromdale, and died in 1715. He was succeeded by 

" At Wester Elchies are also to be seen several sculjitured stones, the remains of 
a Hindoo temple. They had lain for upwards of a hundred years in the neighbour- 
hood of Gour, the ancient Hindoo capital, and have lately been sent to this country 
by Mr Grant.

his son Lord Elchies, one of the Judges of the Court of Session, 
whose son Baron Grant sold the estate to the Earl of Findlater. 
The house is at present occupied by Alexander Reid, Esq. who 
rents the home farm. In the wood of Easter Elchies, a little be- 
low the mansion house, is the churchyard of Macallan, a seques- 
tered rural burial-ground. 

At some distance below the House of Easter Elchies, and near 
the eastern extremity of the parish, stands the elegant bridge of 
Craig Elachie. This handsome structure was built in 1814 by 
the Parliamentary Commissioners, aided by private subscriptions. 
It consists of a single arch of cast metal thrown across the Spey at 
one of the most beautiful parts of the river. The span of the 
arch is 150 feet 3 inches above the ordinary level of the water; 
the abutments are supported by four castellated turrets, each rais- 
ed to the height of fifty feet. " These towers, during the floods 
of 1829, established in a remarkable manner the superior durabi- 
lity of a hollow cylindrical construction in masonry, for they were 
but little affected by the pressure of water, which swept away many 
seemingly stronger buildings." 

The execution of the bridge did great credit to Mr John Simp- 
son of Shrewsbury. The cast iron was delivered at Speymouth 
for L. 3000. The cost of erection, &amp;c. including iron, amounted 
to L. 8000. The approach to Craig Elachie bridge is very grand. 
The traveller appears on crossing to be approaching a large ca- 
vern, but feels surprised to find himself on a turnpike road, cut 
for a considerable extent along a huge rock covered with firs of 
a large size, and bounded by a secure parapet wall overhanging 
the Spey. The height of Craig Elachie rock, at the highest 
point cut down for the rdadway, is 70 feet. 

In Rothiemurchus there is another lofty rock called Craig Ela- 
chie, and between these two crags is comprehended the well-known 
district of Strathspey. In former times, signals by fire used to be 
communicated from the one rock to the other, on the approach of 
an enemy, to convene the inhabitants. • Hence the Grants use for 
their motto, " Stand fast, Craig Elachie."

There are 3 insane persons, 2 or 3 fatuous, and 3 blind. 

There are 3 landed proprietors, and ] 6 tenants paying L. 50 and 
upwards yearly for their farms ; 6 merchants who have shops for 
the sale of cloths, groceries, &amp;c. 

Most of the inhabitants are employed in agriculture as farmers, 
crofters, labourers, or farm-servants. 

There are also 13 masons, 1 heatherer, 4 gardeners, 13 wea- 
vers, 7 tailors, 11 shoemakers, 8 blacksmiths, 10 wrights, 3 car- 
penters, 6 sawyers, 1 dyer, 2 carding-millers, 4 grain-millers, 
1 forester, 1 carrier, 1 butcher, 1 groom, 1 fish cadger. 

Language. — Not very long ago, the Gaelic tongue was spoken 
in this parish. There are now, however, not above a dozen indi- 
viduals who understand it, and not the half of these natives. Knoc- 
kando is reckoned a Highland parish, but the preaching of Gaelic 
has been discontinued for nearly ninety years. Provincial Scotch, 
mixed with English, is now the common dialect of the country. In 
the neighbouring parish of Cromdale, Gaelic is still spoken and 
preached. 

Customs, Sfc. — Amongst the customs, it may be remarked, that 
married women generally retain their maiden names in preference 
to assuming those of their husbands. Many of the people appear 
to have formerly had two names. The following specimens are 
selected from the parochial registers : 

Grant alias Beg ; Grant alias Achnach ; Grant alias Roy ; 
Grant alias M'Robbie; Grant alias Miller; Grant alias M'Ker- 
ran ; Grant alias Cly ; Grant alias Moir ; Smith alias Gow ; 
M'Pherson alias M'Lellan ; Robertson alias M'Robie alias 
M'Robert; Cameron alias M'Phail ; M'Donald alias M'Alister; 
M'Donald alias Muggach; M'WiUiam alias M' Cully. 

The night-waking of corpses still continues, but nothing of an 
improper nature now occurs. The system of drinking, which was 
too common at funerals, has been happily abolished. It is singu- 
lar that in this quarter, the father, who ought to appear as chief- 
mourner, seldom attends the funeral of his eldest child. Tues- 
day, Thursday, and Saturday are the common days on which wed- 



KNOCKANDO. 



73 



dings take place, — the people having some absurd superstition 
against Monday and Friday. 

Within the last few years a visible improvement has taken place 
upon the dress of the people, especially amongst the females, — 
caps and bonnets being now pretty generally worn. Many of the 
younger children are dressed in the kilt and hose. The men gene- 
rally wear the tartan plaid over coats and trowsers of broad cloth. 
However plain and homely the parishioners may appear to dress in 
general; for kirk and market they always reserve a suit of good 
clothes. Of late, there has also been an improvement in cleanli- 
ness, although there is still considerable room for more, both with- 
out and within doors. Except by a few families, butcher-meat is 
not much used. Fish is becoming more common amongst the 
peasantry than formerly, whilst tea and sugar are rapidly gaining 
ground. 

Character of the People.— The parishioners of Knockando are 
exceedingly kind and hospitable, according to their means; ever 
ready to pity the sorrows and supply the wants of the vagrant pau- 
per. They are frugal, and, generally speaking, industrious and sober. 
It is to be regretted that the blessings and benefits of education 
have not been prized as they ought,— it being not uncommon to find 
individuals unable to read and write. This, however, is partly ac- 
counted for by the former miserable state of the roads. It must also 
be admitted, that there are too frequent instances of unlawful inter- 
course between the sexes; and that poaching, both in game and 
the salmon fishery, prevails to some extent. Smuggling, which 
was formerly very common, is now almost entirely suppressed. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Economy. parishes in Scotland of 
the same extent contain more waste land capable of improvement 
and cultivation. A good deal of hill pasture, which was formerly 
stocked with sheep, is now brought into cultivation. Some of the 
hills and waste moors might be profitably planted with larches and 
Scotch firs, which would not only add shelter to the cultivated fields, 
but at the same time tend much to adorn and beautify the parish. 

On the estate of Easter Elchies there are about 500 acres in 
constant or occasional cultivation, and about 100 which have never 
been cultivated, the half of which, however, might, by proper drain- 
ing, be brought under tillage. There is no undivided common 
except where turf and peat are cut for fuel. ' 
There are about ninety acres of wood, consisting of Scotch fir 



74 



ELGINSHIRE, 



and larch, and fourteen of ash, birch, oak, elm, and beech. There 
are few or no enclosures, but the state of the farm-buildings and 
dwelling-houses is improved of late years. As the farms are small, 
and the tenants industrious, improvements, encouraged by the 
landlord, during the last seventeen years have made rapid progress, 
—much aided, no doubt, by the facility with which lime is pro- 
cured from Mortlach, in consequence of the building of Craig 
Elachie bridge, and the improved state of the roads. The returns 
on the best land are six to eight; and on the poorer soils four to 
five. The weight of hay from sown grasses from 100 to 150 stones 
per acre. 

On the estate of Kirdals there are 572 acres either cultivated or 
occasionally in tillage ; 132 waste or in pasture ; 4500 in a state of 
undivided common ; and 400 in wood, consisting of fir, oak, birch, 
and alder. There are few enclosures ; and, with some exceptions, 
the farm-buildings are rather of an inferior kind. The greatest 
obstacles to improvement arise from want of capital, and more ex- 
tensive meliorations. The number of horses amounts to 44 ; of 
black cattle to 330 ; and of sheep to 200. Average gross amount 
of raw produce raised on the estate : turnips, 30 acres; grain, 1200 
bolls ; potatoes, 400 bolls ; hay, 3000 stones. 

On the estates of Wester Elchies and Ballintomb there are 
about 1170 acres in cultivation, 100 in meadow pasture, and 3400 
in hill and moss, 60 for occasional tillage, and 86 for permanent 
pasture, 200 in natural wood of oak, birch, alder, &amp;c., and 80 in 
plantations of Scotch, larch, spruce, and silver firs. The want 
of capital is the chief obstacle to improvement; and although 
the proprietor allows L. 5 for every improved acre at the end of 
the lease, few tenants can conveniently want their money so long, 
chiefly on account of an advance of ten per cent, on the tenth 
rent, and five per cent, on the fifteenth rent, which per cen- 
tages continue to the expiry of the nineteen years' lease. There 
are but few enclosures, and the farm-buildings are generally but 
indifferent. Stone enclosures are paid by mutual valuation at the 
conclusion of the lease. There are about 50 pigs, 90 horses, 800 
black-cattle, and a few sheep. The average gross amount of pro- 
duce may be about 50 quarters of wheat ; 200 of barley ; 45 of 
pease ; 1940 of oats ; 350 bolls of potatoes ; 25 stones of flax ; 
and 150 to 200 of hay per acre. 

No proper return can at present be given for the estate of 

Knockando.

Rent of Land. — The rent of land varies from 18s. to L. 1, 15s. 
per acre, the average rent may be from L. 1 to L. 1, 5s. Most 
of the tenants, however, pay customs to the proprietor in the shape 
of sheep, hogs, poultry, meal, eggs, and hmestone, besides services 
consisting of a draught of horses and carts for any purpose the pro- 
prietor may choose. Some of the proprietors have now converted 
most of the customs and services into money. The tenants likewise 
pay road-money. The annual rent of a labourer's house varies from 
10s. to L. 1, and with garden and ground from L. 1 to L. 1, 10s. 

Wages, §-c. — A ploughman receives in the half-year from L. 4 
to L. 5, the average about L. 4, 10s. ; women from L. 1, 10s. to 
L. 2 ; married servants who have houses, from L. 5 to L. 6, with 
meal and milk; day-labourers. Is., and women 6d. per day with 
victuals ; harvest labourers 3d. per threave.— Mason and carpen- 
ter work are generally performed by contract. When employed per 
day, a mason will earn Is. 6d. or 2s. with victuals; a carpenter or 
Wright, Is. 3d. with do. ; a gardener. Is. 3d. with do. ; a shoemaker, 
Is. 6d. with do. ; a tailor, Is. with do. The wages of herds vary ac- 
cording to their duties. Ditching costs ld. to 4d. per ell, accord- 
ing to the depth ; casting of peats per load, 3d. to Sd. ; setting do. 
id. per load ; diking from 4d. to 5d. per ell ; trenching 4d. to 6d. 
per rood. For mossing, men -receive Is. 6d., and women, 9d. per

of the parish are supphed with wood for pahng, roofs of houses and 
other purposes. On the estates of wester Elchies the average prices 
are as follows :— Ash, 2s. 6d. per solid foot ; oak, 3s. per do. ; elm

Duration of Leases, t.— The general length of the farm leases 
is for the period of nineteen years; feus, for thirty- one years; m 
the village of Archiestown, there are four perpetual feus. 

The chief crops raised in the parish are oats, viz. Hopetoun early 
and late, Angus, Kildrummy, potatoe and black, oats; barley and 
Scotch bear, wheat, pease, beans, potatoes, turnips, flax, and hay. 
The oats and barley are chiefly sold, the remainder being used m 
famihes, or for feeding domestic animals. The potato and turnip 
crops are consumed in the parish. The rotation of crop generally 
observed consists in two white crops, one green crop, and two crops 
of grass. The quantity of grass seeds sown in an acre amounts 
to eight pounds of clover, mixed with three bushels of rye-grass. 

The agriculture of the parish may still be said to be in its in- 
fancy; but improvements are daily taking place in the system of 
husbandry, and the farmers becoming more sensible of the advan- 
tages of hming. The most approved methods of farming have 
been adopted by Mr Reid on the farm of Easter Elchies, and by 
the Rev. William Asher on the farm of Nether Tomdow, the 
greater part of the latter having been recently improved and laid out. 

Manufactures.— T\veve are four meal-mills, a waulk-mill, and a 
carding-mill, in the parish. Saw and thrashing-mills have also 
been lately added to one of the former description. At the waulk 
and carding-mills, wool is dyed and manufactured into plaiding and 
broad-cloth, blankets and carpets. Four hands are employed, but 
not constantly. A good deal of weaving and spinning used to go 
on throughout the parish, but there is now much less than formerly. 
There are two distilleries, one at Cardow, conducted by Mr Gum- 
ming ; the other at Macallan, by Mr Reid ; both of which are well 
known for the very superior quahty of the spirit distilled. 

jlantal The valued rent of the parish amounts to L. 1987, the 

real rent to upwards of L. 3000. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
MarJtet-Toions, -c— There are no market-towns within the 
bounds of the parish ; the nearest are Charlestown of Aberlour, 
distant 5 miles from the centre, Rothes 10, Dufftown 15, Forres 
16, Grantown 16, Elgin, Keith, and Fochabers, 20. There is a 



KNOCKANDO. 



77 



nearer road to Elgin through the Mannoch Hill, about 13 miles in 
length ; but in winter this road is often impassable, being in some 
places in very bad repair. The greater part of the grain exported 
from the parish is shipped at Garmouth, the remainder at Lossie- 
mouth and Findhorn. 

Village. — The only village is Archiestown, which was built on 
the moor of Ballintomb, by the late Sir Archibald Grant of Mony- 
musk, about the year 1760, to whom the property then belonged. 
By an accidental fire in 1783, the village was partly destroyed. 
The ruins of some houses still remain in the same dilapidated con- 
dition, but Archiestown is now beginning, Phoenix-like, to rise from 
its ashes. Several new houses have been built during the last year, 
and three are at present in progress of erection. The village con- 
sists of a main street, a square and several bye-lanes, and contains 
180 inhabitants. 

Means of Communication c. — There is no post-office in the 
parish ; the letters and newspapers are conveyed twice a-week by 
a foot-runner to and from the post-office at Craig Elachie. It is 
to be hoped that the communication will ere long be more fre- 
quent. There is a carrier from Aberdeen to Archiestown, once a 
week, who resides in Rothes. There is also a weekly carrier 
from the parish to Elgin. The turnpike road from Elgin lead- 
ing to Dufftown, Grantown, &amp;c. passes through the parish for 
a very short distance between the bridge and the blue scaur of 
Craig Elachie. Until lately the parish roads were most miserable. 
A central road has now been formed for a considerable distance, 
and is expected soon to be completed. The bye roads are in very 
bad repair, and several farm-houses are sometimes inaccessible 
from the state of the roads. At Wester Elchies, there is a ferry 
boat, which affords communication with Charlestown of Aberlour, 
&amp;c. ; and there is another farther up the river at Black's Boat, in 
the parish of Inveraven, which leads to Glenlivat, Tomintoul, &amp;c. 
At both ferries, foot-passengers pay Id.; the charge for crossing a 
horse is4d. Besides the bridge of Craig Elachie over the Spey, there 
are several bridges of wood and stone over the burns. A new stone 
bridge is about to be commenced over the burn of Aldarder. The 
fences- are in general very insufficient, and, with the exception of 
an old hedge or two, consist of rough stone dikes or wooden pa- 
hngs. The bridge of Craig Elachie has been the means of faci- 
litating the improvements of this and all the neighbouring parishes ;

Tomdow, Kirdals, or any other place towards the top of the pa- 
rish, it would prove of the utmost utility. This important object 
well deserves the attention of the landed proprietors, road trustees, 
and the commissioners for Highland roads and bridges, — more par- 
ticularly should the proposed new line of road from Perth to El- 
gin and Forres be carried into effect. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church of Knockando, situated 
abouteight miles from the eastern, and seven from the western boun- 
dary, is on the whole pretty central for the population. It was built 
in 1757, almost close to the site of the former one. It was repaired 
in 1832, and is now one of the neatest churches inside, in this part 
of the country, but too small for the population. In order to re- 
medy this defect, it is intended very soon to have a dwelling-house 
in the village of Archiestown, at three miles distance, fitted up as 
a chapel in connection with the Church of Scotland, in which di- 
vine service will be performed once a month, or oftener, by the pa- 
rish minister. The collection of L. 11, 13s. Id. Sterling, recently 
made in the parish in aid of the General Assembly's Church Ex- 
tension scheme is to be laid out for this purpose ; the family of 
Wester Elchies having kindly granted whatever wood may be re- 
quired to promote the object. The parish of Knockando would 
make two sufficient parishes, both in point of extent and popula- 
tion. 

Several small benefactions are on record, which have been dis- 
tributed amongst the poor; and last year a legacy of L. 19, 19s. 
was bequeathed by a foundling of the parish who died in Aberdeen 
at an advanced age, and in which city and neighbourhood she 
had long resided as a servant. The parish church accommodates 
between 500 and 600 persons. The sittings are all free, and are 
proportioned to the tenants, according to the valued rents of the 
heritors. It thus happens, that for the inhabitants of Archiestown 
and for tradesmen, little church accommodation is provided. 

The manse was built in the year 1767, and stands in the im- 
mediate vicinity of the church, on an elevated peninsula formed 
by the Knockando burn, and distant from the river Spey about a 
mile. The extent of glebe may be about fourteen acres, of which 
eleven or twelve are arable. Nearly two acres were destroyed by 
the memorable flood of 1829. The amount of stipend, includ- 
ing communion element allowance, is L. 158, 6s. 8d. and is all 
paid in money ; Knockando being on the list of small livings 
augmented by Act of Parliament. There are about 320 fami-

lies attending the Established church. There is a small con- 
gregation of Independents in the parish, who assemble for public 
worship in the upper flat of the minister's dwelling-house. There 
are about eight families of this persuasion in the parish, — a few fa- 
milies from other parishes also attend. The Independent mi- 
nister rents a small farm. There is also a place of worship occa- 
sionally visited in summer by licentiates of the United Secession 
church. There are no families in the parish who profess to be con- 
nected with that body, consequently the congregation is made up 
of occasional hearers. There are, however, some individuals who 
generally attend when there is sermon. Only one Roman Ca- 
tholic is to be found in the parish. 

Divine service at the Established church is generally well attend- 
ed, especially during the summer season ; some of the people re- 
gularly coming a distance of six or seven miles. A few families 
occasionally attend the churches of Aberlour, Rothes, and Inver- 
avon, from the greater proximity of these places of worship. The 
average number of communicants amounts to 370. The parish- 
ioners are almost all well affected towards the Established church, 
in proof of which, it may be stated, that petitions to both Houses 
of Parliament, praying for the support and extension of the Church 
of Scotland, were transmitted in February last, signed by upwards 
of 400 male inhabitants of the parish. The sacrament of the 
Lord's Supper is dispensed once a-year, previous to which, seve- 
ral diets are held for catechising both the advanced and young 
communicants. The parishioners are also regularly examined 
and catechised once a-year, after the conclusion of the harvest 
season. In the year 1810, four communion cups, and in 1822 two 
communion plates were gifted to the kirk-session,— the former by 
Mr George Stewart, merchant, Corgyle of Wester Elchies and 
the latter by Mr James Cruickshank, farmer, Bogroy, one of the 
elders of the parish. The Earl of Seafield is sole patron.

Education.— There are six schools in the parish, two of which 
are parochial, three supported by the Society in Scotland for Pro- 
pagating Christian Knowledge, and one which is unendowed. The 
last mentioned, and two of the society's schools are taught by fe- 
males. Each of the parochial schoolmasters has a salary of L. '25, 
13s. Sid. with a share of the bequest left by the late Mr Dick to 
the parish teachers in the counties of Moray, Banff, and Aberdeen. 
The amount of fees at each of the parish schools averages from 
L. 8 to L. 10 per annum. The school-house of Knockando is at 
present in very bad repair, and the scholars have no play ground. 
The school fees vary from 2s. to 5s. per quarter, according to the 
number of branches which the pupils are learning. The usual 
branches taught at the parochial schools are, reading, writing, 
arithmetic, book -keeping, land-measuring, mathematics, geography, 
English grammar, and Latin, with the Shorter Catechism, and the 
principles of the Christian religion. The Bible and New Testa- 
ment are read every day in all the schools of the parish, and the 
parochial schools and the Society's male school at Archiestown are 
opened and closed with prayer. In the female schools, sewing, 
knitting, and samplar work are taught, along with reading, spelling, 
writing and arithmetic. 

There are two Sabbath schools under the superintendence of 
the minister and elders, which are well attended both by young and 
grown up persons. It is also intended to have another established. 
The Independents likewise have a Sabbath school. One of the 
parochial teachers officiates as session-clerk, with a salary of L. 2, 
10s. out of which sum he provides a depute precentor. His fees 
for proclamations of bans are, 5s. when both the contracting par- 
ties reside in the parish, and 3s. 6d. when only one party is resi- 
dent ; for recording baptisms. Is. ; for extracts and certificates, Is. 
except when of an unusual length. The session officer has a fee 
of 16s. 8d. and a small perquisite from the marriage and baptism 
dues. 

Library, Savings Bank. — At present there is neither a parish 

library nor a saving bank,— the want of which are felt. It is, how- 
ever, sincerely to be hoped that means will ere long be found for 
introducing into the parish these admirable additions to our in- 
valuable Scottish parochial system. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— Theve are at present thirty-nine 
individuals on the poor's roll, and upwards of 20 families who oc- 
casionally receive supplies during the year. There is a general 



KNOCKANDO. 

distribution once a year, and sometimes oftener, but those who are 
in immediate want receive additional allowances as necessity re- 
quires, from 2s. 6d. to 10s. During the year 1834, the collec- 
tions amounted to L. 30, including ordination and sacramental 
occasions. The collections at the church, the interest of L. 60 
in the British Linen Company's Bank, with occasional donations 
and penalties, form the only means from whence the poor are sup- 
ported. The heritors allow L. 10 per annum for the support of 
each of two pauper lunatics, one of whom is boarded in a farm- 
house, and the other lodged in a house, rent free. Whilst it must 
be admitted that the reluctance to apply for parochial aid is not 
gaining ground, yet, the spirit of true Scottish independence is 
still to be seen in the parish ; and last year a case of this kind oc- 
curi-ed, when a poor woman in Easter Elchies, to whom the kirk- 
session sent half-a-crown as an occasional supply, returned the 
money, saying that, as long as she had her cow, she would not ac- 
cept of one single farthing. ,-present there is no pauper in the 
district of Easter Elchies. The parish is much infested by sturdy 
beggars, and tinkers, especially during the summer season, who 
drain away a great deal of what might otherwise be given to the 
home-poor. 

Inns, -c— There are four public-houses in the parish, three of 
which are in the village of Archiestown, and the other at the boat 
of Wester Elchies. One in Archiestown is perfectly sufficient. 
Ihe effect of such a number is decidedly most injurious to the 
morals of the people. It is to be feared that there are also some 
mdividuals who do not scruple to sell whisky even without a license. 

i./.-The fuel chiefly used consists of peat and turf, taken 
from the different mosses. Wood is also burned, but, oing to 
the distance from the sea-coast, very few coals are consumed. 
Miscellaneous Observations. 
Ihe most striking variation between the present state of the 
parish and that which existed at the time of the last Statistical 
Account, consists in the suppression of smuggling, and the conse- 
quent greater attention paid to agriculture, and the rearing of cat- 
tle, together with the quantity of moorland which has been im- 
proved. Draining and liming are much wanted, and also fences 
for the protection of the fields from the inroads of cattle, and foot

hiohly useful ; cand if premiums were to be occasionally awarded by 
the proprietors for the best kept cottages and neatest gardens on 
their estates, the advantages would be very great, there bemg much 
room for improvement in cleanliness. We have much pleasure, 
however, in pointing out Corgyle Cottage, the tasteful residence 
of Mr Robert Stewart, merchant, which, both m external and m- 
ternal arrangements, affords an example of neatness to the country 
around. The school-house of Elchies has also been very prettily 
dressed up, and is neatly kept by Mr Charles Grant, the present 
teacher Grant and Robertson are the most common surnames 
in Knockando. The late Robert Grant, Esq. of Wester Elchies, 
had a small medical garden. Several of the plants still remain, 
includino- agrimony, camomile, costmary, crowfoot, elder, garlick, 
black hellebore, lavender, marsh-mallow, mint, mustard, rosemary, 
rhubarb, saffron, sage, Solomon's seal, savine, saxifrage, sorrel, 
thyme, valerian, trefoil, horehound, &amp;c. &amp;c.

PRESBYTERY OF ELGIN, SYNOD OF MORAY. 

THE REV. GEORGE GORDON, MINISTER. 



I Topography and Natural History. 

2Vg c.— This parish, in some old writings, is called " Bre- 
nuth." No satisfactory derivation has yet .been assigned to the 

Extent and Boundaries.-T\e outhne of the parish of Birnie 
approaches an oblong; with its narrower extremity on the north, 
and within 2 miles of the burgh of Elgin, it runs due south for 
7 miles, averaging If in breadth. It is bounded on the east, north, 
and west, by the parish of Elgin, and is separated from the parish 
of Knockando on the south by the junction of the parishes of 
Dallas and Rothes. Birni hes on the north side of the high ground 
which rises between the Spey and the flat of Moray From its 
highest elevation, at the Manoch-hill, of about 1000 feet, it has a 
gridual fall,— till at its northern boundary it is less than 50 feet 

• Shaw derives it from " Bremth, i. e. a brae, or high land." 



BIRNIE. 83 



above tbe level of tbe Moray Frith. The surface is uneven, inter- 
sected by a few ravines and water terraces, and studded over with 
many alluvial knolls. 

Climate. — The superiority of the climate of the lower districts 
of the province of Moray over that of some more southern coun- 
ties, may in a great measure be accounted for by the little eleva- 
tion at which these districts stand above the level of the sea, the 

absence of any mountain range to attract the watery clouds,— the 
neighbouring waters of the frith preventing such extremes of tem- 
perature as are experienced in more inland situations,— but per- 
haps chiefly by the dry and sandy soil speedily absorbing the rain 
after it falls. 

Rivers, c— The small river Lossie, rising in the parish of 
EdinkiUie, enters the parish of Dallas, the lower part of which, 
Kellas, is evidently the bed of an old and extensive lake. The' 
river, leaving this ancient bed, runs in a deep and lengthened chan- 
nel, cut through the solid rock, which formerly had been the bar- 
rier of the lake. In this water- worn channel, several of the pecu- 
har characters of the rock gneiss and its quartzose veins are to 
be met with. The Lossie forms the western boundary of the pa 
rish of Birnie for about 2 miles, then enters the ancient bed of 
another lake, which had extended from Birnie to Aldroughty and 
after a course of about 25 miles, excluding windings, ioins the 
Moray Frith at Stotfield-head. Small though this stream appears 
It IS yet found extremely difficult in many places to keep it within 
Its proper channel. At one part of its course where it touches 
and intersects a corner of this parish, it has brought down from 
the higher ground, and thrown up such quantities of shingle and 
coarse gravel, as, instead of forming any protection to the adjoin- 
ing land, often stop up the old run, and make the water divero-e 
into a new course. At this place, it has within the last hundred 
years swept away many acres of good land, and is at this day, from 
want of sufficient bulwarks, cutting and washing away a field of a 
soil inferior to few within the county. 

Geology, Soils, c._The Grampian range, both on the north 
and south sides and its subordinate chains of primitive mountains 
are flanked by the rocks of the old red sandstone formation. wTh 
in he province of Moray, these secondary rocks dip into what is 
geologically termed the basin of the Mo;ay Frith.' They tm 
both banks of the Spey for several miles above its influx. Thence

they may be traced in a westerly direction through the parish of 
Birnie, in the northern half of which they form the underlying rocks. 
The southern half lies on gneiss, destitute dike of such metallic 
veins and calcareous beds as this rock in many other places is found 
to contain. The lowest beds of the old red sandstone here present 
a very hard, compact and flinty appearance, very different from the 
overlying conglomerates, which are comparatively easily disinte- 
o-rated by the weather, and cut into deep ravines by the smallest 
rivulets. With the exception of a few detached patches of lias, 
which are met with between the town of Elgin and the frith, the 
old red sandstone formation including some rather unusual siibor- 
dinate strata of cornstone and yellowish gray sandstone, destitute 
of fossils, comprehends all the secondary rocks of the lower part 
of Elginshire, so that, notwithstanding the traditional and long 
cherished hope, the true coal measures need not be looked for in 
it. Neither the gneiss nor harder strata of the sandstone have 
been quarried in this parish, the outliers or boulder stones being 
abundant enough for all the building required. The softer con- 
glomerates and upper beds are unsuitable for this purpose. 

Over the rocks that lie in situ, there is generally such a depth 
of sand, gravel, and other alluvial matter, that they have little or 
no influence on the soil. However, when the softer varieties of 
the conglomerate approach the surface, the soil partakes much of 
the component parts of the rock, and thereby becomes one of the 
most fertile and productive. The productiveness of the soils here 
seems to depend as much, if not more, upon the character of the 
subsoil, than upon the proportion in which their own ingredients 
meet. The prevailing soil in cultivation is of a gravelly or sandy 
nature ; but examples present themselves at no great distance from 
each other, not unfrequently on the same farm, running from a 
deep retentive clay, through the rich haugh loam, up to the light 
sandy soil of the gravelly bank. 

Several large granitic boulder stones are to be met with here, as 
in other places, far from their parent rocks, and are lasting monu- 
ments of the impetuosity with which the floods and currents of 
water, in a bygone period, have swept the surface of the globe. 
Peat of good quality, with imbedded trunks and roots of fir and 
other trees, is found near the top of the Manoch-hill, and in a 
hollow near the glen of Rothes. Formerly there was much of it 
carried to and sold in Elgin ; but the more general use of coal 
has superseded in a great measure the use of peat as fuel.

Botany. — Jimciis halticus, Lapsana pusilla, Potamogeton he- 
terophyllus, Hieraciim denticidatiim, Listera cordata, Pyrola 
media, Rhinanthus major, and Aspidium Filix fcemina may be 
enumerated among the rarer Scottish phaenogamous plants found 
in this parish. The water lily Ni/mphcca alba noticed in 
the last Account, has disappeared, the lake having been drained 
many years ago. Until lately, there were no plantations of any 
description within the parish, which could only shew a few strag- 
gling alders and willows by the sides of the rivulets, or the still rarer 
ashes which served to mark the narrow confines of what was once 
the kail-yard. Within the last twenty years, 274 imperial acres 
have been planted in separate lots, with larch and Scotch fir. They 
promise so well, that it is. to be regretted this improvement has 
not been carried on to a much greater extent, as there are exten- 
sive tracts of land, lying waste, that could not be better appropri- 
ated than for plantations of firs and even of harder woods. 

11. — Civil History. 
Land-oivners.— The Right Honourable the Earl of Seafield is 
sole proprietor of Birnie. There are, in his Lordship's possession, a 
plan of the whole parish in 1784, five Scots chains to the inch, 
and detached surveys of most of it that have also been completed 
since that date. 

Parochial Register s.—The parish registers do not reach beyond 
last century. At the first meeting of the kirk-session after the battle 
of Culloden, there is the following entry in the handwriting. of the 
incumbent, who had made himself so obnoxious to the Jacobites, 
that he was obliged to go south to meet the Duke of Cumberland 
for protection. " Birny, 16th June 1746. The collections since 
last distribution December 1745 amounted to no more than 
seven Ls. nine sh. Scots, occasioned by the rebels, their having 
been so long in this country." 

Antiquities.— The Bishop's Church was first at Birnie, afterwards 
at Keneddar, then at Spynie, and last of all at Elgin. About forty 
years ago, the foundations of an extensive building were dug up in 
the corner of a field, which had formerly the name of Castlehill 
On this site likely stood the ancient Episcopal residence. 

The present church is probably the oldest place of worship now 
used in the country. Like those of the more dignified structures of 
Koman Catholic times, the walls are built inside as well as on the 

inc from the orX'l-'' received its name from some families, who, remov 

ing from the old situation, carried the name along with them to their new sSlement:

outside with square cut ashlar work of freestone, and to this day stand 
perpendicular as they did hundreds of years ago. In 1734, this 
ancient structure seems to have been shortened by a few feet ; and 
the west gable, though then renewed with the same materials, does 
not exhibit the skill and workmanship of the older walls. It is 
situated on the top of a small rising ground, similar to stations some- 
times occupied by the stone circles that have hitherto been deemed 
of Druidical, but are now thought to be of Scandinavian origin. And 
that this was probably the site of one of these circles, may be infer- 
red from several large granitic stones some of them with figures re- 
sembhng parallelograms, rudely drawn on them, being built into the 
surrounding churchyard wall, and which are not likely to have been 
carried thither for any recent purpose. The first preachers of the 
gospel may thus have taken advantage of the natural awe with 
which the natives regarded the place where their religious rites 
were performed, and would thereby gain attention, at least, to the 
new doctrines which were also to be dehvered there. It is perhaps 
to this heathenish awe, as well as to the circumstance of this place 
being one of the mother churches, or one of the earliest consecrated 
grounds of the Roman hierarchy in the north of Scotland, that we are 
to trace that superstitious feeling with which this particular church 
and burial-ground are even still regarded by some. The stone 
baptistry and old bell, noticed in last account, are still preserved 
in the church. A sketch of the latter antique curiosity has been 
given by Sir Thomas Dick Lauder, in his very interesting account 
of the Moray Floods. The remaining antiquities comprehend 
the Bible stone, the cairn of Kilforman, rectangular trenches, or, 
as some say, a Roman castra at the Foths, and a Danish encamp- 
ment at the Shogle. The last having hitherto escaped the plough- 
share is still " to be traced in a well-aired dry situation, watered on 
the west side by the burn of Bardon, and fortified on the east and 
north by a valley. It commands a prospect of the Moray Frith from 
Speymouth to Cromarty bay," and is just at that part of the as- 
cending ground whence the first view of the great Danish strong- 
hold of Burghead can be had over the sandstone ridge of the 
Knock of Alves. In confirmation of the opinion that there once 
existed a stronghold of the Danes in this situation, it may be stat- 
ed that the adjoining farm still retains the name of Edinburgh ; 
and, notwithstanding that a very different derivation for this name 
is current in the neighbourhood, the term hurgh mosi likely marks 
it as a place known to the Scandinavian tribes.

Had such a table as the above been constructed ayearao-o, the 
population would have been found to have exceeded the Govern- 
ment census of 1831. A few have emigrated to America or re- 
moved otherwise from the parish ; but the decrease within so short 
a period has been chiefly owing to scarlet fever, which for several 
months has been frequent and fatal in this neighbourhood. The 
mistaken but still practised friendship of visiting and crowding the 
sick-room, and the no less reprehensible reluctance to call in me- 
dical advice, or early to remove the patient to Gray's Hospital at 
Elgin,— while these are the surest means of spreading and continu-.

ing the disease among the community, — are not the best or wisest 
for hastening the cure of the afflicted. 

Character, Sfc. of the People. — Improved in the cleanhnessof their 
habits, and in the quahty and neatness of their Sabbath day attire, 
dihgent in their various caUings, and attentive to their rehgious and 
moral duties in pubhc and private, — there are perhaps few rural 
communities that, " upon the whole, enjoy in a higher degree the 
comforts and advantages of society, or are more contented with 
their situation and circumstances." For these comforts, they are 
indebted chiefly to the liberal system of management which has 
been adopted in this part of the Seafield property, where an al- 
lowance of L. 5 is given to the tenant for every acre that he takes 
from the waste ground, improves and adds to the arable land of 
his farm. The enterprising tenant has thus been enabled to lime 
his field, and to reap such returns as no other application could 
secure. 

The habits, the comforts, and the morals of the peasantry of the 
north of Scotland experienced a beneficial change when iUicit dis- 
tillation was suppressed : and this was the case in few districts to a 
greater degree than in the upper parts of Moray — where night 
was turned into day, the farm and family neglected, and all credit 
and character perilled in this demoralizing manufacture and traffic. 
All, however, now allow that the well filled stack-yard is a more 
becoming appendage, than the bofhie, to the farm; and few of 
the oldest smugglers deny that the suppression of their trade has 
turned out, in the end, as beneficial for themselves as it was, at the 
time, just to others. 

In this parish, the good effects of the entire absence of the spirit- 
retailer, as well as of the complete suppression of illicit distillation 
and smuggling, are to be clearly seen, and are thankfully acknow- 
ledged. There is a licensed malt barn ; but neither fair nor village, 
neither inn, alehouse, nor gin-shop, nor manufacturers, nor lawyers, 
are within its bounds. Elgin, distant about six miles from the centre 
of this parish, is the post-town, and the market for all commodities. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The parish of Birnie contains, by measurement, 
5784 Scots acres; of which 829 were in cultivation in 1784, the 
rest in pasture, moor, moss, and waste ground. At present, there 
are about 1600 Scots acres arable, 304 imperial acres under wood, 
and, of the remainder, 400 acres might, with a profitable applica- 
tion of capital, be reclaimed and added to the cultivated ground.

Rent of Land. — The average rent of the arable land is 15s. per 
Scots acre ; and the duration of leases generally nineteen years. 

Husbandry. — The farms are usually managed under a six-shift 
course, viz. 1st, Wheat from grass manured; 2d, Oats; 3d, Tur- 
nips ; 4th, Barley with grass seeds ; 5th, Grass, generally cut for 
hay; 6th, Grass always pastured. It may not be thought a cor- 
rect mode of husbandry to have two white or corn crops in succes- 
sion ; but the grass for wheat is always well manured, and the oat 
crop following is generally excellent. And, when a liberal allow- 
ance of bone dust, or well prepared manure is given to the turnip 
crop, and attention paid to cleaning, the land is kept in good con- 
dition under this system. 

Cattle, Sj-c. — The cattle are mostly a cross breed between the 
low country cows of Moray with West Highland bulls ; and by 
considerable care and attention on the part of the breeders, the 
stock have been much improved of late years. The horses are 
small, but very active, and admirably adapted for ploughing the 
light land, of which this parish is chiefly composed. The old breed 
of sheep which were small, with reddish-brown faces and legs, have- 
given place to the Cheviot, which were introduced into this country 
some considerable time ago, by a gentleman who now has the great- 
er part of the hill grounds of Birnie, in conjunction with a part of 
the Rothes hills, under lease, and on which he has an ewe stock of 
Cheviot sheep, managed on the same system with the other large 
sheep stocks in the north of Scotland, and also under the charge 
of shepherds brought from the border counties. By this manao-e- 
ment, the tacksman is enabled to afford a considerable rent for 
hills which not many years ago yielded little or nothing to the 
landlord.

Means of Communication.— The success of agriculture and the 
condition of farms have not inaptly been said to depend upon good 
roads, as the comfort and health of the animal frame depend upon 
the soundness of its blood-vessels. To secure good roads, then, 
ought to be the first object with every improving landlord. 



90 



ELGINSHIRE. 



By act of Parliament, the statute labour of Birnie has been con- 
verted, and yields only L. 14, — a sum quite inadequate to keep the 
old in repair, and of course unfit for the construction of new roads ; 
so that the parish roads have become almost proverbially bad. 
Much reliance, however, is placed on the liberality of the Ho- 
nourable Colonel Grant of Grant, and on his long experienced 
attention to the wishes of the Seafield tenantry ; and it is confi- 
dently expected, that the making and repair of roads in this district 
will keep pace with his other territorial improvements. An earnest 
of this is afforded in his having lately ordered a survey of the main 
hne, upon a plan which, when completed, will secure to the pa- 
rish of Birnie a properly conducted and well-made road from north 
to south. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church, the only place of public wor- 
ship within the parish, is not centrically placed for the population, 
being six miles distant from the southern boundary. There is no 
tradition as to the time when it was erected ; its interior was repaired 
in 1817, and affords legal accommodation for 253 persons. The 
whole of the seats, except a gallery, erected by the kirk-session, 
and let for behoof of the poor, are allocated to the different farms, 
and are often found to be given not in proportion to the number of 
individuals that reside on these divisions of the parish. The manse, 
the walls of which are of an old date, underwent considerable al- 
terations in 1811, but cannot be said to be in a state of good re- 
pair. The extent of the glebe, including garden, &amp;c. is about 
eight acres of good land, which would rent for about L. 2 per acre. 
Bv decreet of the Court of Session in 1813, the stipend is 14 bolls, 
s'firlots, 2| lippies victual, 3 pecks and | of a lippy meal, and 
L. 102, 4s. S/d. Sterling money. 

The average number of communicants is 90 ; of whom 39 are 
male heads of families. There is no missionary or catechist ; and 
the parishioners are seldom called upon to contribute to religious 
or charitable purposes carried on beyond their own immediate sphere. 
There are 5 individuals in the parish. Dissenters. 

Education. — There are two schools, the parochial, and a female 
school. The parochial schoolmaster has the legal accommodation 
and L. 26 of salary, with about L. 4 for school fees. The school 
expenses of the pupils for the year may run from 6s. to 8s. There 
are some parts of the parish so distant from the parochial school 
that young children residing there cannot attend ; but this has of 
late been in some measure obviated by the endeavours of the school- 
mistress to support herself by teaching in the southern district of

the parish. L. 2 from the Earl of Seafield, a free house and yard, and 
the school fees which must be but trifling make up the sum of her 
emoluments — with the exception of what she wins by needle-work. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — For the last seven years, the average 
number of poor who have received parochial relief is 10 ; and the 
average sum yearly given to each in the same period is L. 1, 5s. The 
parish funds arise from the ordinary collections at the church, 
amounting to L. 8 per annum, one-tenth of Darkland's mortification, 
amounting to L.o, 3s. 4d., rent of session loft m the church amount- 
ing to L. 2, and L. 1 from the Earl of Seafield in lieu of an old 
gallery. The sum of L. 100 gradually accumulated by the sur- 
plus funds, and by a donation of L.30, has just been placed at 
interest, and will materially add to the annual allowances of the 
poor. There has here never been any assessment for the poor, 
who in most if not in all cases are driven only by want to seek relief 
from the parish funds. But when they have been once admitted 
on the roll, they become generally as reluctant to resign their por- 
tion, even when their circumstances have improved, in behalf of 
the more necessitous, as they were at first to accept it. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

There is at present the same number of inhabitants in this pa- 
rish as at the date of last Statistical Account, forty years ago ; but 
in this interval they seem to have first decreased by one-eighth, and 
then regained their former numbers. 

The more marked differences that have taken place in that time 
besides those already noticed are, \st, The extensive and valuable ad- 
ditions which have been made to the arable land, which since 1784 
has almost been doubled ; 27, The improved management of farms, 
cattle, and farm produce; and M, The consequent increase of 
comfort in the diet, clothing, and dwellings of the people. With- 
in the last twenty years, many fences and several sheltering plan- 
tations have been reared ; but there is still much room left for such 
enclosures. 

In conclusion, it may be safely stated, that there are few, if any, 
districts in the north of Scotland, where, in despite of the wretched 
state of the roads, greater agricultural improvements have of late 
been made than in the parish of Birnie. These improvements 
have been accomplished, by the exertions of an active tenantry, di- 
rected by the judicious suggestions and management of the gentle- 
man who has the charge of this portion of the noble proprietor's ex- 
tensive domains.

PRESBYTERY OF ABERNETHY, SYNOD OF MORAY. 

THE REV. DONALD MARTIN, MINISTER. 



I. Topography and Natural History. 

Extent, Bou7idaries.--TnB parish of Kincardine has been 
united to this parish ; and both he on the south-east side of the 
river Nethy. The parish extends from the borders of Cromdale 
to Rothiemurchus. The river Spey, expanded apparently to its 
greatest magnitude, ghdes onward in a smooth unruffled course, 
from Rothiemurchus till it meets the district of Moray, near the 
middle of Abernethy, the lower end of which parish falls within the 
county of Inverness. 

Topographical appearances, Src— The mountains of Cairngorm 
the blue mountains rise to a conspicuous elevation on the southern 
boundary of the parish. They are seldom wholly free from snow. 
The forests cannot extend themselves to a great height on their 
sides. There are beautiful topaz stones of all colours found on 
these hills, capable of being polished for ornamenting rings and 
 finishing seals. 

There are several lakes in the parish. That of Glenmore in 
Kincardine is nearly circular, and about 2 miles in diameter. It 
occupies the middle of an aged forest of firs, which, when sold by 
the late Duke of Gordon, was considered to be of the largest and 
best timber in Scotland ; and the progress of a new growth of tim- 
ber in the forest is now so great that the result must one day be 
very profitable. The lake discharges into the Spey a stream which 
has a course of 6 miles. In this quarter, there is a lake in the 
hollow of a mountain, which neither takes in- nor emits any stream; 
but the rocky banks rise around to a great height, and are clothed 
with the ever verdant pine. This lake is stored with abundance of 
fat trout. 

The Nethy, from which the parish takes its name, is only a brook 
in dry weather ; but is occasionally swelled to such a degree as to 
float down timber to the saw-mills or to the Spey,

II. — Civil History. 

Land-owners. — The Earl of Seafield is proprietor of the great 
estate of Grant. The chief persons of the Grant family have 
been baronets for several centuries; and have maintained very re- 
spectable characters. His Lordship's heir-apparent is Colonel the 
Honourable Francis William Grant of Grant, who has several sons. 

Eminent Men.' — Connected with this parish was Francis Grant, 
Lord Cullen, an eminent lawyer and Judge in Scotland, and born 
about the year 1660. He distinguished himself at the Revolution 
by a treatise which he wrote to prove that James had abdicated the 
crown, at the time of agitating the question of the Union of Eng- 
land and Scotland. He was created a baronet by Queen Anne, 
and about a year after was appointed a Judge. He died in the 
sixty-sixth year of his age. 

Patrick Grant was born in Edinburgh, in 1696, and in 1754 was 
made one of the Lords of Session, with the title of Lord Preston- 
grange. He also was connected with this parish. He wrote seve- 
ral tracts against the Rebellion of 1745, and was a distinguished 
lawyer. He died at Edinburgh in the sixty-fourth year of his age.

IV. — Industry. 

I am informed that there are 7000 acres of the Grant estate, 
in Abernethy, under fir of natural growth. The arable ground 
in the parish bears but a small proportion to the uncultivated, — 
a great part of the surface being covered with wood. There are 
some farms in the parish in a high degree of improvement, — having 
substantial and commodious buildings, and fields properly cultivated 
by strong horses and implements of the best form. 

An uninterrupted manufacture of timber has been carried on in 
the Abernethy district for more than sixty years. The York 
Building Company, in 1728, purchased the timber of the woods of 
Abernethy to a great amount. Extensive, indeed, was their be- 
ginning; every kind of implement was of the best form: saw- 
mills, smelting furnaces for iron ore, manufacturing bricks, &amp;c. 
&amp;c. — all surprising novelties in the place, — were commenced, and 
carried on for seven years. They imparted much useful know-

ELGINSHIRE. 



ledge to the people, and taught them dexterity in many opera- 
tions. 

For a considerable length of time past, the improvement in agri- 
culture in this parish has been great ; and is likely to continue. 
This has been occasioned chiefly by the command of lime, which 
happily is found here in various places; and abundance of peats 
and decaying timber, for burning that valuable article, is found 
all over the parish. This mode of cultivating and improving the 
ground is found so beneficial, that there is not an individual of 
even th6 lower order of farmers, such as pay no more than L. 6 
of rent annually, who has not a lime-kiln in use. This manure 
not only promotes the increase of corn, &amp;c. but greatly meliorates 
the pasture for cattle, and increases both the quantity and quality 
of hay. 

The proprietor, most prudently and most beneficially to all ranks 
of farmers, gives a fixed sum for every acre of waste ground brought 
into a state of cultivation. 

I cannot obtain any accurate account of the yearly amount and 
value of raw produce raised in the parish. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church of Kincardine is very well 
built and finished, and is 7 miles distant from the manse. It af- 
fords sufficient room for 600 persons. The church in the district 
of Abernethy is very sufficiently built, well supplied with light, and 
commodiously fitted up with seats. There is a beautiful seat in 
the gallery, opposite to the pulpit, intended for the use of the fa- 
mily of the heritor. The church can accommodate 1000 persons. 
The parish was accommodated with a catechist, by the Com- 
mittee for managing the Royal Bounty, since the year 1790. But 
the old man died two years ago, and the salary was withdrawn. It 
is well known that the abolition of that cheap office produces a de- 
plorable ignorance of the doctrines of salvation. 

Education. — I can give a very favourable report of the paro- 
chial school, in which there are seldom fewer than 100 scholars. 
Mr M'Donald now upwards of thirty-one years in office very 
successfully teaches Latin, EngUsh, arithmetic, book-keeping, En- 
glish-grammar, writing, and mathematics. There are many young 
men now conducting business prosperously who had been educated 
at this school ; and we have to ascribe their success to the instruc- 
tions they here received. We have at Kincardine, a school,

supported by the Society for Propagating- Christian Knowledge. 
When I came to this parish I instituted several Sabbath evening 
schools, which have become an eminent blessing to the people ; 
and I shall encourage them while I live.

PRESBYTERY OF ELGIN, SYNOD OF MORAY. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER SIMPSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — Spynie, the ancient name of this parish, is derived from 
the Loch known by that name, which, before it was drained, bound- 
ed the parish along its north side. 

Extent, Boundaries. — This parish is nearly 4 miles long, and 2 
miles broad, and therefore consists of about 8 square miles. It is 
bounded on the south by the river Lossie, excepting a fine field 
of about 50 acres called Burrough-bridge, which belongs to this 
parish, though on the south side of the river. It is bound- 
ed on the west by the parish of Alves ; on the east by the parish 
of St Andrews ; and on the north by the parishes of DufFus 
and Drainie, orj in other words, by the ground anciently covered 
by the loch of Spynie. About a mile from the east end of the 
parish, a ridge of moor stretches almost to its west end, for the dis- 
tance of about 3 miles, rising gradually towards the west, into a 
pretty high hill, and clothed almost throughout its whole extent 

with thriving plantations of fir, intersected with other forest trees, 

excepting one httle farm, near its centre, quite embosomed in the 
wood. Along the south side of the highest part of this hill, about 
a mile north-west of Elgin, there is a large extent of flourishing 
oak wood, the property of the Earl of Fife, allowed to be one of 

• The reason of this is, that the Lossie anciently ran close hy the town, as appears 

from the title-deeds of the properties in the adjoining quarter of the hurgh, which 

still bound these properties hy the river, though the valuable field above referred to 
now the property of the Eail of Seafield, has been from time immemorial interjected 
between them. The reverse of this has happened a little lower down the river in a 
small semicircular field, called Dean's Crook, which has been evidently cut off 'from 
the cathedral lands of Elgin, by the river occupying the diameter, instead oftheneri 
phery, which is now for the most part a cultivated field.  



96 



ELGINSHIRE. 



the finest forests in the country, and seen to a great advantage ris- 
ing up the hill in fine inequahties. 

Soil and Climate.— Von each side of this ridge, hes almost the 
whole of the cultivated land, in which almost every variety of soil 
is to be seen, from the richest clay to the most barren sand. The 
air is healthy, and on the south side of the hill peculiarly soft and 
warm, during a great proportion of the year. On the north side, 
the climate is not so pleasant, the soil being rather damp and cold. 
The inhabitants, however, are quite healthy, and the soil has been 
much improved by draining. 

Loch of Spynie.—T\\Q loch of Spynie was formerly more than 
3 miles in length, and about 1 in breadth ; and the sole of it be- 
ing considered valuable, if the water were drained off, a contract 
for executing that undertaking was entered into by the contermi- 
nous heritors, in the spring of the year 1807, and a tolerably com- 
plete drainage was effected, at the expense of L. 10,744 Sterling; 
but unfortunately after that great outlay, the ground was found to 
be so impregnated with sulphur and iron ore, as to be almost total- 
ly barren. Almost the only beneficial results from the great out- 
lay have been, — the redeeming from the influence of the water of 
the loch the rich clay lands which formerly surrounded its margin, 
and were occasionally flooded by its overflow. 

11. — Civil History. 
Land-owners. — The only land- owners are the Crown, the Earl of 
Fife, the Trustees of the late Earl of Fife, the Earl of Seafield, Mr 
Sellar of Westfield, and the Heirs of the late Colonel Grant of 
Findrassie. 

Antiquities. — The palace of Spynie, the ancient residence of the 
Bishops of Moray, is situated in the eastern extremity of the pa- 
rish, on the south bank of the ancient lake where the water had 
been deepest. The palace had been a magnificent and spacious 
building, round a square court, having the gate on the west side, and 
fortified by towers at the corners, and a dry ditch on the west and 

south, and containing lofty halls, deep vaults, a chapel, stables and 

other offices. These ruins are now in a very dilapidated state, and 
so rent as to be incapable of repair. Around the ruins are some 
bishop's lands, now in the hands of the Crown. Their extent is 
227 acres, of which about 36 acres are arable, 118 moor and pas- 
ture, and 73 plantation. Within the last eight years, the Barons of 
Exchequer have greatly improved these Crown lands, by laying out 



NEW SPYNIE. 



97 



judiciously about L. 900, in enclosing with stone dikes, and planting, 
and in building a keeper's cottage, to whom they allow L. 5 yearly, 
for taking care of the place, and looking after the planting. A 
large portion of the moor is at present in course of being rendered 
arable ; for doing which, the Barons allow the tenant L. 5 per Scots 
acre. 

In the year 1828, the heritors united in building, at the expense 
of about L. 30, a substantial stone wall, pointed with lime, around 
the much neglected and unprotected churchyard of Spynie, the old 
wall having totally crumbled down ; and completed the enclosure 
with a cast-iron gate. This is the only burying ground in the pa- 
rish, and consists of about an acre finely situated. 

Parochial Register.— The earliest entry in the parochial regis- 
ter of baptisms was made in the year 1708; and since that period 
the register has been pretty regularly kept.

The population has evidently been increased by the buildino- of 
the village of Bishopmill, which contains 621 inhabitants; while 
the rest of the parish contains only 500. In several parts of the 
parish, a number of crofts have been long ago converted into farms, 
—which has greatly diminished the population in the country.

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture.~ThQ number of acres, standard imperial measure, 
which are either cultivated or occasionally in tillage, is 3176; con- 
stantly waste or in pasture, 471. 

The uncultivated land is chiefly that part of the bed of the an- 
cient lake which belongs to this parish ; a much greater part of 
which belongs to the parishes of Duffus, Drainie, and St Andrews. 
It affords coarse pasture for cattle, but proves neither nutritive nor 
who esome, and has the strange effect of changing the colour of 
black cattle grazing on it, into gray. 

Bnraining, embanking and substantial sluices ; by trenching

down the sandy surface, and turning up the clayey subsoil to the 
summer sun and winter frost ; by purifying and enriching it with 
lime and other manure,— posterity may yet convert this large extent 
of ground into a beautiful and fertile field. The number of acres 
under wood, natural and planted, is 1411. 

Rent of Laiid.—T\iQ average rent of arable land per acre in the 
parish is about L. 1, 10s. The real rent of the parish is L. 4764. 

Stock,— ThQXG are now few sheep in the parish, the former pas- 
ture for them being either planted with wood, or cultivated and 
brought into tillage. The most approved breeds of cattle have 
been gradually introduced by some of the farmers; and much at- 
tention paid to their improvement. The Earl of Seafield, for a 
number of years past, has encouraged his tenants to cultivate the 
waste ground on their farms, by affording them L.5 per Scots acre 
for what they bring into a proper state of tillage. Some of the 
tenants of the Earl of Fife have of late years made considerable 
additions to their farms, by cultivating waste ground, with great 
industry, at an expense of from L.5 to L. 10 per acre. Mr Sel- 
lar of Westfield has, for a number of years past, been tastefully 
dividing and inclosing his property with hedges, beautifying and 
sheltering it with belts of plantations, enriching the soil with lime 
and marl, and making substantial roads. 

The estate of Findrassie had been for many generations posses- 
sed by the Leshesof Findrassie, and was, in 1825, purchased from 
Sir Charles Leslie, the present Baronet, by Colonel Grant of the 
H. E. 1. C. S. now deceased, son of the late Provost Grant of 
Forres. Colonel Grant was the only residing heritor in the pa- 
rish, and during the time he had the estate, very much improved 
it, by judicious draining, fencing, planting, trenching waste ground, 
and bringing it into a proper state of tillage. He also made an 
addition to the mansion-house, and otherwise much improved it. 

The general duration of leases is for nineteen years. The farm 
buildings are for the most part commodious squares, and suitable to 
the respective farms, though in general they are thatched, instead 
of being slated. The enclosures are made either with substantial 
stone dikes, or hedges, excepting temporary ones with paling. 

Quarries. There is, near the summit of Quarrywood-hill, a free- 
stone quarry, very hard and durable, which supplies a large ex- 
tent of country with mill-stones, and the town of Elgin and neigh- 
bourhood with stones for building. Towards the foot of the hill, 
on the south side, there is a fine quarry from which it is supposed 

4 



NEW SPYNIE. 



99 



the Elgin cathedral had been built. From this quarry Dr Gray's 
Hospital, Elgin, was built, and is hence called the Hospital Quarry. 
The stones are susceptible of a fine polish ; they are of a beautiful 
yellow or cream colour, and are often found of large dimensions, fit 
for pillars and lobby pavements. The whole of this hill seems to 
be a mass of excellent sandstone. 

There are also fine freestone quarries on the Seafield proper- 
ty — from which a considerable portion of that property has been 
lately inclosed with substantial stone dikes, and from which the 
village of Bishopmill has been built. The Findrassie property af- 
fords quarries of freestone fit for common buildings, and excel- 
lent for dikes. 

There is in the parish, a bleachfield for linens and yarns : it 
lies in the eastmost part of the parish, on the north side of the 
river Lossie, within half a mile of Elgin. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Village.— There is only one village in the parish,— that of Bishop- 
mill. It is almost close to Elgin, the market-town, and by the late 
Reform Act is included in that burgh. This parish enjoys peculiar 
means of communication, no part of it being inconveniently dis- 
tant from either of the harbours of Lossiemouth and Burghead 
or the markets of Elgin,— to which last there is at all times an un- 
mterrupted access by one cast iron, and two handsome stone bridges. 
One of these bridges is where the post-road to Forres crosses the 
Lossie, towards the west end of the parish; another, about the mid- 
dle of the south side of the parish, where the road to Duffus crosses 
the Lossie ; and another, towards the east end of the parish, at 
Bishopmill, where the post-road to Lossiemouth crosses the Los- 
sie. This last mentioned bridge was originally built of stone, but 
was swept away by the floods of August 1829; and the road trus- 
tees thereafter erected a handsome cast iron bridge. 

Ecclesiastical State.~The church and manse were originally 
most pleasantly situated at the eastern extremity of the parish, in 
the vicinity of the Bishop's Palace; but in the year 1736, they were 
removed to Quarry wood, a more centrical, though much more bleak 
situation, nearly under the highest part of the north side of the 
hill. Both are at present in pretty good repair, and the manse has 
several times got additions and alterations. The church affords 
accommodation for about 400 persons, and all the sittings are free. 
It IS about 3 miles distant from the extremities of the parish - but 
more than the half of the population being residenters in Bishop-

mill, almost close to Elgin, and upwards of two miles from Quarry- 
wood, thev find it much more convenient to attend the churches in 
Elgin. In good weather, however, a good many from Bishopmill 
attend the parish church. For eight months past, a sermon has 
been preached monthly in Bishopmill, on Sabbath evening, in the 
school rooms, chiefly for the aged and infirm, some of whom are un- 
able even to attend the churches in Elgin. — The glebe, including the 
garden, consists of about 6 acres, inclosed with stone dikes ; and 
its annual value may be about L. 14. By a private agreement 
with the heritors, the present minister receives L. 8 yearly, during 
his incumbency, in lieu of a grass glebe. The amount of the sti- 
pend is 91 bolls of meal, 91 bolls of barley, and L. 3 of money. 
The 91 bolls of meal, deducting one-ninth part for difference of 
weight, are equivalent to cwt. 113.7499. The 91 bolls of barley, 
deducting one twenty-first part for difference of measure, are equi- 
valent to quarters 66.2907. 

There is no Dissenting or Seceding chapel in the parish ; but 
about 36 persons, chiefly inhabitants of Bishopmill, are Dissenters, 
and 10 of them Episcopalians. There are no Roman Catholics in 
the parish. Divine service at the Established Church is generally 
well attended, and the average number of communicants is about 
100. 

There are three Sabbath evening schools in the parish, and an 
annual collection is made in the church for defraying the expense 
of them. 

Education. — There are two schools in the parish, viz. the pa- 
rochial school at Quarry wood, and an unendowed school in Bishop- 
mill. The branches of instruction generally taught in each are, 
reading, writing, arithmetic, English grammar, book-keeping, and 
Latin. The parochial schoolmaster's salary is the maximum, viz. 
L. 34, 4s. The amount of the school fees is about L. 16, 8s. 
The schoolmaster has merely the legal accommodation. The ge- 
neral expense of education per annum for English reading is 6s., 
for reading and writing, 8s., for reading, writing, and arithmetic, 
10s., and for the additional branches of English grammar and La- 
tin, 12s. With very few exceptions, the people are alive to the be- 
nefits of education, and there are scarcely any individuals upwards 
of twelve years of age who cannot read and write. There are two 
female schools, one at Quarrywood, and one in Bishopmill. In 
these are taught reading, sewing, and knitting. They are justly 
considered valuable institutions.

Library. — There is one parochial library; it is stationed at 
Bishopmill. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is 28. The average sum allotted to each 
yearly is 18s. ; the annual amount of church collections is L. 20 ; the 
annual amount of interest for money lent out from the poors' fund 
is nearly L. 11. There is an independent disposition among the 
poor, restraining them from seeking parochial relief, while they 
are healthy and able to work; but when old age or distress comes 
upon them, they do not consider it as degrading to apply for relief. 

Alehouses. — There is no inn in the parish, and but four alehouses, 
two of which are toll-houses ; and the fewness of these is, without 
doubt, much in favour of the morals of the people. 

Fuel. — Some peats and turf are still used for fuel, as also a 
good deal of wood ; but the principal fuel, and perhaps the cheap- 
est is English coal, imported to Burghead and Lossiemouth, at an 
average price of about Is. lOd. per barrel.

PRESBYTERY OF ELGIN, SYNOD OF MORAY. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER GENTLE, MINISTER. 



I- — Topography and Natural History. 
Extent, Boundaries. — The boundary of this parish is irregular, 
especially towards the north. It includes about one mile of the 
coast of the Moray Frith, half way between Burghead and Find- 
horn; and for about a mile and a half inland, the parish is confin- 
ed to a mile in breadth by Duffus on the east, and Kinloss on 
the west, along the sea coast; after which, it extends in breadth, 
east and west, about 5 miles. The south boundary is the 
ridge of the hill of Pluscarden, which is about 6 miles from the 
sea. The church and manse, situated on the north of the turnpike, 
are readily observed by passengers about midway between Elgin 
and Forres. On the south, Alves joins the landward part of the 
parish of Elgin ; on the east, the parish of New Spynie ; on the 
north, the parish of DufFus, the coast of the Moray Frith, and part 



102 



ELGINSHIRE. 



of the parish of Kinloss; on the west, it joins the parishes of Kin- 
loss and RafFord. 

Topographical Appearances.— The face of the country within 
the parish presents to the eye an agreeable variety of hill and dale, 
— in the spring and summer, covered with a fresh green, and in the 
autumn with yellow corn. Admirers of scenery would not call it 
beautiful, on account of the scanty appearance both of wood and 
water, and of the large tract of stunted heath, which appears in se- 
veral parts, especially toward the south and west, close by rich 
fields of corn or pasture— causing the stranger to ask why the one 
portion has been so much cared for, and the other so much ne- 
glected  The answer is, that the property of the uncultivated 
parts called common or undivided liberty is claimed by the three 
heritors whose lands adjoin. Their respective claims have been 
under arbitration for upwards of forty years, but are not yet ad- 
justed; in consequence of which, several thousands of acres lie 
waste, some parts of which are said to be fit for tillage, and the 
greater part well adapted to the growth of fir. The whole of the 
common has lately been measured, and, it is expected, will be di- 
vided ere long. At the east end of the parish, there is a small 
conical hill covered with, wood, called the Knock of Alves. Like 
several other places in the neighbourhood, it has been rendered fa- 
mous by the tradition of a meeting of Macbeth and the Witches on 
the spot. Several years ago, the proprietor, Alexander Forteath, 
Esq. of Newton, erected, on the top of the Knock, a handsome 
tower, called York Toioer. It is a pleasing object amidst the same- 
ness of the surrounding country ; and from the top of it, may be 
obtained an extensive view of the Moray Frith. 

Climate. — The air in this parish, as throughout the county of 
Moray, is dry and salubrious. During the cold season of the year, 
the prevaihng winds are the N. and N. W. ; and in the summer 
months the W. and S. W. It has been said that, on an average, 
the county of Moray has in the year about forty less of rainy days 
than the neighbouring counties. In a very dry season, the far- 
mer feels the effects of this in the diminished quantity of straw. 
The soil, however, in this parish, which is under culture, is for the 
most part very fertile,— being a deep loam on a clayey bottom. 
The inhabitants are healthy and active, and instances of a vigor- 
ous old age are not rare. 

Geology.— Theve are, in several places within the parish, large 
beds of freestone, some of which have been partly quarried. It

is found to be harder than usual, and not easily wrought, but very 
durable. There is, besides, one quarry for millstones at present 
worked, — from which the mills in the neighbourhood have for several 
years been in part supplied. In the low ground, in several places, 
there is still a considerable depth of peat moss. At one time, the 
inhabitants were abundantly supplied with fuel from the moss 
grounds. The best portions, however, are now drained, and brought 
into culture. The peat procured from what still remains uncul- 
tivated, emits, when burning, a very strong sulphureous vapour ; and 
as ilo coal has been found in the county of Moray, the poor are at 
times but ill provided with fuel. They make great efforts of eco- 
nomy, that they may be able to purchase a small quantity of En- 
glish coal, — of which several cargoes are imported yearly from Sun- 
derland, and sold at Burghead, and Findhorn betwixt Is. 8d. to 2s. 
per barrel. Occasionally, the poor have been assisted in purchasing 
that comfort, in the winter months, by the donations of benevolent 
individuals connected with the neighbourhood. 

Botany. — Ash and fir, and all kinds of flowering shrubs and com- 
mon fruit-trees seem to thrive in the soil. The following plants, 
named according to Hooker's British Flora, have been found grow- 
ing spontaneously in this parish and vicinity, viz. Acinos vulgar 
ris, Chrysosplenium, alternifolium, Cerastium arvense, Fedia denta- 
ta Goodyera repens, Hippuris vulgaris, Liiincea borealis, Petasi- 
tes vulgaris, Silene anglica, Solarium dulcamara, Teesdalia nudi- 
caulis, Thlaspi arvense, Trientalis Europcea. 

II. — Civil History. 
Ancient State of Property. — It appears, from Shaw's History of 
the Province of Moray, that at the beginning of last century, the 
landed property of Alves was more subdivided than at present. 
There had been then four mansion-houses of resident proprietors, 
if not more. There are now only two. One farmer occupies as 
his dwelling-house, the old mansion-house, which had been occu- 
pied by the proprietor. Lord Lyon, and afterwards by the family of 
Brodie before the property was sold to the late Earl of Fife. Some 
years ago, there were to be seen the remains of three castles, of 
the smaller size, built as places of defence. The materials of two 
of them have been used in the building of farm steadings. A con- 
siderable part of the third is still standing, called the castle of As- 
leisk, indicating in several parts that it had been formed to hold 
out against a strong body of assailants. The other two are report- 
ed to have been of similar construction ; they were at first occu-

ELGINSHIRE. 



pied, it is said, by three brothers, named Dunbar, among whom the 
discordia fratrum seems to have prevailed to an unusual degree. 

Present Land-owners. — The greater part of the land within the 
parish is still held by the descendants of the ancient families, whose 
rights were granted or confirmed by Royal authority. There are six 
land-owners, viz. the Earl of Moray ; the Trustees of the late James 
Earl of Fife; Henry Joseph Brodie Dunn, Esq. married to the heir- 
ess of Milton Brodie; James Campbell Brodie, Esq. of Lethen and 
Coulmony ; Major L. Gumming Bruce of Rose Isle and Kinnaird; 
and Alexander Forteath, Esq. of Newton. The proprietors of Mil- 
ton Brodie and of Newton usually reside in the parish. None of 
the others have a residence in it. The good understanding, however, 
which has for the most part subsisted between landlord and tenant 
is evident from this circumstance, viz. that not a few of the farms 
have been rented by several generations of the same families : ad- 
ditions being made to the original farm at each new lease. There 
is one tenant now occupying a large farm on the Earl of Moray's 
estate, who is of the ninth generation on the same ground; there 
is another tenant on the same estate whose fathers had occupied the 
same farm upwards of 400 years. Among their discharges of rent 
was found one signed by Thomas Randolf Earl of Moray. This, 
as a curious relic, was given up to the Earl of Moray's factor ; and 
a renewal of the lease was granted on the most indulgent terms. 
It has followed, that from the residence of the same families for so 
long a time, on the same spot, and from the consequent intermar- 
riages which have taken place among them, — many of the present 
generation are more or less nearly related to one another. Hence, 
too, arises a strong attachment to the neighbourhood itself, — so 
that if a livelihood can be obtained in it, they have not hitherto 
been willing to remove. 

Changes in the Mode of Possession. — The rent of farms has 
from time to time been greatly increased. The rental of the pa- 
rish, about forty years ago, is said to have been not more than 
L. 3000. It is now about L. 6000. Among the changes that 
have taken place during that period, one is — the letting of land 
in large farms, instead of the small crofts into which it was former- 
ly divided ; another is — the paying of rent in money, and not in 
grain, wedders, fowls, &amp;c. in which a great part of the rent of some 
farms used formerly to be paid. Both of these changes have no 
doubt operated towards improving the cultivation of the soil; more 
capital is employed, and every part of the work is better done.

Pai 'ochial Registers. — The parochial register of the kirk-session 
is preserved from the year 1649, down to the present time. The 
manuscript has been somewhat injured by damp and smoke. But 
the greater part can be read. The registers of marriages and bap- 
tisms is also preserved. In the session records, are found frequent 
intimations of days set apart for prayer, humiliation or thanksgiv- 
ing. 

Antiquities — The old military road can still be traced about a 
quarter of a mile south of the present turnpike. Not many years 
ago, there was, near the old road, a very large heap of stones, cal- 
led Moray's Cairn, supposed to be commemorative of a battle. 
Not far from the same place were dug up some Lochaber and 
Danish axes. For many years, a superstitious fear prevented the 
neighbours from removing any of the stones from the heap ; but 
at length, the workmen employed in making the new turnpike al- 
lowed present convenience to overcome all fears ; and the stones of 
the cairn were thereafter employed in metaUing the road. In the 
churchyard, was dug up several years since, a large stone coffin, 
such as might be supposed to have belonged to some personage of 
note. It was found in the ground which had formed the area of 
the old church. 

EcclesiasticalHistory,—li2LeYs, from Shaw's History of Moray, 
that the first Protestant minister in this parish was Mr Patrick Bal- 
four, in the year 1567; from which time down to 1646, there had 
been appointed five ministers,— the last of whom, George Hannay, 
was deposed in 1646 for opposing the Covenant. In 1649, the 
kirk-session Records commence with the ministry of Mr William 
Campbell. The first pages of the Record are filled with the Solemn 
League and Covenant, written out very carefully, and subscribed 
by the minister and forty-two heritors and parishioners ; to which 
signatures, are added in the handwriting of the clerk the names 
of above two hundred parishioners, who most likely were not able 
to write their own names. From that time to the present, there 
have been twelve ministers ordained. One of them, named Be- 
roald Innes, was an Episcopal minister. He was ordained by the

Lord Bishop and Presbytery in the year 1676, and was ejected in 
1690. He did not, however, leave the neighbourhood ; but occu- 
pied a house and a small piece of ground on the border of the pa- 
rish, where he remained during the rest of his days. In his room 
was appointed a Presbyterian minister, Mr John Gilchrist from 
Leith, of whom it is stated in the minutes of kirk- session, June 22, 
1697, " that he was, according to the sentence of the late Gene- 
ral Assembly, transported from the parish of South Leith to this 
parish of Alves." So that there appears to have been an interval of 
some years at that time from 1690 to 1697, before any one was 
appointed to the stated pastoral charge of the parish. 

Until the year 1659 or 1660, Alves included a large portion of 
what now forms the adjoining parish of Kinloss ; and it is evident 
that, previous to this date, when Kinloss was erected into a pa- 
rish, the pastoral duties of Alves must have been heavy on one 
minister and one session. It appears, however, from the old pa- 
rish records, that in these days the elders were both numerous 
and assiduous in the performance of their duties. The minute 
of kirk-session, dated January 9, 1659, contains a resolution of 
the session to make a new election of elders for the several dis- 
tricts of the parish. These districts amounted to eleven, and 
elders are appointed to each of them. The whole list contains 
no less than twentij-seven names. As all the districts named are 
within the present bounds of the parish, it is likely that the new 
election of elders was made on account of the change which was then 
taking place as to Kinloss. It seems, also, to have been the usual 
practice of the session to nominate one of its members as ruling 
elder, to attend the meetings of synod. The exercise of church 
censure was extended much farther than in modern days. Besides 
other immoralities, — drunkenness, slander, brawling, theft, absence 
from church ordinances, profaning of the Lord's day by strolling in 
the fields, or playing at foot-ball, undutiful conduct to parents, &amp;c. 
appear from time to time to have been the occasion of administer- 
ing warning, and even rebuke before the congregation. When, 
from any cause, there was no sermon on the Lord's day, the con- 
gregation was nevertheless convened in the church to hear the 
scriptures read. On such occasions, the minute bears, " no sermon

a slab of Scotch marble, bearing a well written Latin inscription, to the memory of

esteemed, though ejected on account of his adherence to Episcopacy. Some of the 
descendants of his family are still in the parish. One of them i". Po««f

this day, the people convened and heard the word read," " the col- 
lection for the poor," &amp;c. 

Not only are week days frequently mentioned as having been 
set apart for fasting or thanksgiving; but, hkewise, special subjects 
that appeared to call for thanksgiving were often enjoined to be 
remembered on the Lord's day. From the middle of last century, 
the vigorous exercise of church censure seems to have been gra- 
dually relaxed, — so that for a considerable time back, no mention 
is made of any delinquent appearing before the congregation, but 
only before the kirk-session, to be admonished or rebuked. There 
has long prevailed in this neighbourhood a reverence for the Sab- 
bath, and for the ordinances of religion. 

III. — Population. 
While Alves included a large portion of Kinloss, the population 
must have greatly exceeded its present amount. Even after that 
time, the number of inhabitants within the present boundaries of 
the parish had been for several generations much greater than what 
it is now. This may be inferred from the following comparison of 
the registrations. 

Old register for the year 1689, — marriages, 16; baptisms, 83 

Yearly average of the 20 years preceding 1835, — marriages, 5 ; baptisms, 20. 

In like manner, the decrease of population appears from the re- 
turns made at different periods. 

By the returns made to Dr Webster, the amount of population in 1 755 was 1 691 

By former Statistical Account in - . - 1793, 1111 

By Government census in - - - 1811, 922 

Do. do. - - - - 1821, 947 

Do. do. . - _ . 1831, 945 

From the above, it appears that for some time, there had been 
a rapid decrease ; after which the amount had become nearly sta- 
tionary. The great alteration in the size of farms, already men- 
tioned, is oneof the chief causes of the decrease up to the year 1811. 
Many small crofts were thrown into one large farm ; and the sur- 
plus population, no longer obtaining dwelling or employment in 
their native places, went to swell the numbers in the large towns.

Language, Habits, SfC. of the People. — The language generally 
spoken is the Scotch. A stranger is struck with the peculiar voivel 
sounds, given in a great many words, as loMit for wheat, feel for 
fool, pure for poor, and weri/ for very, &amp;c. Gaelic is not spoken, 
except by strangers. 



108 



ELGINSHIRE. 



The habits of the people are marked by simplicity, frugality, and 
industry. They have many domestic comforts ; and the changes 
of the seasons bring to them a regular change of occupation. Most 
of the cottars cultivate a small piece of ground in front of their 
dwellings, on which they raise a few common vegetables ; many of 
them rear a pig, and, according to the quantity of ground they can 
manure, the neighbouring farmer allows them to plant potatoes 
for themselves on a part of his green crop field. 

Instances of great age, accompanied with good health and vi- 
gour of the mental faculties, are common. The grandfather of one 
of the present parishioners died at the age of 106 years; an old 
woman died a few years ago aged 101. 

During the last three years there have been 12 cases of ille- 
gitimate birth brought before the kirk-session. On this subject 
it is not unimportant to notice, 1st, that the delinquents are for 
the most part hired servants from various quarters of the country ; 
2d, that, according to an old usage, female servants for the sum- 
mer half year are often hired at Whitsunday by the farmer at the 
public market in Elgin, without any certificate of character. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — Between 80 and 100 acres within the parish are 
planted with wood, chiefly Scotch fir. It is thinned regularly; 
and of late years larch, and the common kinds of hard wood have 
been mixed with it. It is calculated that upwards of a sixth part of 
the surface of the parish lies waste in the state of common, formerly 
mentioned. The remainder of the surface being divided into about 
twenty-five large farms, is cultivated with great diligence. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of arable land per acre may 
be stated at from L. 1, 10s. to L. 2 per English acre. Grazing 
of a cow or ox per quarter of a year L. 2 ; do. of a sheep do. do. 
Is. 

Wages. — Wages of a farm-servant for six months, from L. 4 to  
L. 6, with victuals; out-door labourers have from 5s. to 6s. per week 
with victuals; or from 7s. to 8s. without victuals; masons may be 
engaged at 2s. per day ; and wrights at 2s. per day, with victuals, 
or at 2s. 6d. without victuals ; women servants are engaged for six 
months, at from L.l, 15s. to L.2, 5s. ; women are engaged to work 
in the field at 3s. per week in winter, and 4s. in summer ; in harvest 
time cutting and stacking per acre, at from 13s. to 15s.; cutting 
and building per acre, 8s. to lis. Thraving is counted at 2d. to 
3d. per thrave, viz. two stooks. Sometimes a man engages with 
a ftirmer for the whole harvest, at from L. 1, 15s. to L.2, 5s. and 



ALVES.

a woman engages for the whole harvest at from L. 1, 5s. to 
L. 1, 15s. Of late years, some having large farms prefer as farm- 
servants married men. To each, they give a house on the farm, 
rent free, for himself and family; wages L. 5 in the half-year, with 
3 bolls of 9 stone viz. 27 stone of oatmeal, and one pint per day 
of sweet milk. It is found that, with this provision, they can live 
comfortably with their families ; that there is less service required 
in the master's house, and less waste. During the greater part of 
the year, they have already breakfasted in their own houses, and 
have got the horses in the yoke by six o'clock in the morning, and 
labour till noon; then they rest for two or three hours, during which 
they dine, and attend to the cattle, after that, they continue at 
work till six or seven in the evening. 

The only country manufacture is that of plaiding, which sells at 
Is. 2d. or Is. 6d. per imperial yard ; and of coarse harn, which sells 
at 8d. or lOd. 

Live-Stock. — The cattle are for the most part of a mixed breed, 
betwixt the Aberdeenshire and the Highland. Some farmers have 
of late introduced the polled breed from Buclian. 

Husbandry. — Most of the tenants are bound by their leases 
to adopt the fifth or sixth shift rotation of crops. The farms ge- 
nerally are in a high state of cultivation, and some of them have, 
during the current lease, been greatly improved by being subdivid- 
ed and enclosed by dry stone dikes, well built, at the joint expense 
of the proprietor and tenant. The advantage of such enclosures 
is acknowledged to be very great. Most of the large farms are 
provided with substantial dwelling houses, of two storeys. Some 
are slated, others are thatched. A steading of office houses is at- 
tached to each. In several instances, the buildings have been 
erected by the tenant after entering on his lease ; such tenants are 
entitled to claim from the landlord at the expiry of their leases, the 
value of the buildings erected to the amount of one year's rent of 
the farm. 

Both open and under draining has been executed to a conside- 
rable extent. The under draining is in most cases done with stones. 
It has been tried lately with fir trees of the smaller size, laid length- 
wise in the bottom of the drain,— the brush not cut off; one tree 
being laid above another, the brush of the one being laid alono- 
the trunk of the other. The earth being thrown in and levelled', 
sufficient openings for the water are kept by the branches. In 
this way, a drain of great length is made in a short time when the

ELGINSHIRE. 



Leases of farms usually extend to nineteen years. The great 
and unlooked for changes in the value of farm produce in the course 
of nineteen years may render it very difficult for the farmer, with 
all his industry, to fulfil his engagements. When this occurs, the 
good sense and good feeling of the landed proprietors have gene- 
rally pointed out the remedy. They have come forward, and al- 
lowed a reduction of fifteen or twenty per cent, on the rent due. 
This never fails to produce the happiest effects by cherishing good 
will between landlord and tenant ; while it encourages the families 
of a whole neighbourhood to persevere in that unremitting industry 
which, " provides things honest in the sight of all men." 

The chief improvements on the farms, of late years, are the ex- 
tensive enclosures already noticed ; and to these may be added the 
draining of two mosses consisting of upwards of 150 acres. Those 
farms which have not the benefit of enclosures nor of proper drains 
shew at once how much is lost by the want of them. 

Produce. — The rental of the parish being about L. 6000, would, 
according to the usual computation, give about L. 15,000 as the 
average yearly value of the raw produce of all kinds raised within 
the parish. 

It may be added that the valuation of the rental of most of the 
land is of an old date. It is stated in the last process of Augmenta- 
tion to have been made in April 1629, and to have been then set 
down as 1563 bolls, 2 firlots of victual, and L. 164 Scots of money. 

A great part of the grain raised within the parish is shipped at 
Burghead or Findhorn, and sold in the London market. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-toions, Sc. — The nearest market-towns are Elgin on the 
east, and Forres on the west. The turnpike, lying in the most cen- 
trical parts of the parish, renders the communication with the towns 
very convenient. Besides the mail to Inverness, there are two 
stage-coaches. 

There is no village within the parish. The largest group of 
houses hes along the high road south of the church. Among 
these, are two shops for the sale of groceries, meal, &amp;c. ; there are 
also here, a tailor, two shoemakers, and two wrights. The sale of 
spirits is allowed only in two houses within the parish. These are 
at a considerable distance from each other, and on different estates. 
As there are no feus, the proprietor or factor can exercise an ef- 
ficient control over any improprieties of conduct on the part of the 
occupants of single houses or shops. 

On one of the estates, a range of cottars' houses has been erect- 



ALVES. 



Ill 



ed on the following conditions, viz. the cottar builds the house 
and encloses a small piece of ground for garden ; he pays yearly 
a small rent of 10s., at the rate of L. 4 per acre, for the ground oc- 
cupied. He is notallowed to subset the house, nor to sell spiritu- 
ous liquors without express permission from the factor ; he may 
be called on, within twelve months' notice, to resign possession of 
house and ground, in which case the proprietor pays him for such 
meliorations of the house amay be ascertained by men mutually 
chosen. Such a power to eject is not likely to be exercised op- 
pressively, while it preserves a very salutary control to the land- 
lord who is interested in the moral condition of the neighbourhood. 
It is perhaps to be regretted that similar arrangements are not 
more frequent in country districts, and also that, when they are 
made, too little ground is allotted along with each house. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The glebe contains about four acres of 
good soil, close by the church. The manse is newly built, about 
a hundred yards west from the church, on a different part of the 
glebe from the former manse. It is a very commodious and well- 
finished house, of three storeys, with garden and office-houses very 
conveniently situated. The stipend, as fixed by the last augmen - 
tation in the year 1822, is 14 chalders of victual, half meal, half 
barley, payable in money, according to the fiars of the county an- 
nually, with L. 8, 6s. 8d. Sterling for communion elements. Includ- 
ed in the stipend is the sum of 6s. Id. yearly in lieu of the manse 
and croft of the Chantor of Moral/, an office in the old cathedral 
at Elgin, which had been counted in former times as annexed to 
the parsonage of Alves. Taking the average of several years past, 
the stipend may be stated at L. 200. 

The church was built in the year 1769, and, as was usual at that 

time in country churches, it is long and narrow— 75 feet by 25 

not the most desirable structure either for speaker or hearers. It 
is substantially built, and well seated ; and having been built when 
the population of the parish was much greater than at present, it 
affords fully more accommodation than the law requires. This is 
owing entirely to the diminution of the number of parishioners, al - 
ready noticed. There are sittings for about 590 persons. Each 
farmer has a certain number of seats, rent free, assigned to him by his 
landlord. These he occupies with his family, servants, and cottars. 
The sittings in the area of the church were fitted up from the kirk- 
session funds many years ago, and are let at from 6d. to Is. 2d. each, 
—by which means about L. 3 are added yearly to the poors' fund 
The church is conveniently situated, being not far from the centre 



112 ELGINSHIRE. 

of the parish ; and not distant much more than three miles from 
any of the habitations. The roads leading to it are for the most 
part very good ; and during the greater part of the year, it is well 
attended. 

The outward means of spiritual improvement to which the people 
have access are, — besides the opportunity of public worship on the 
Lord's day, — two Sabbath evening schools in different parts of the 
parish, — the yearly celebration of the Lord's supper in the month 
of July, — week days occasionally set apart for public worship, — 
annual public catechisings in twelve districts, — monthly prayer 
meetings in the church, commonly on the first Wednesday of the 
month, — two classes, one of young men, another of young women, 
about twenty in each class, during- the winter months, at the manse 
in the evening, once a fortnight, — and visiting by the minister and 
elders in cases of sickness. 

It cannot be affirmed that there are not instances of drunkenness 
and other immoralities; but these are comparatively few. Nor can 
itbe denied that many shew little evidence of vital Christianity, who 
are yet punctual and even zealous in "observing the outward forms. 
Still, it may be said that the Christian character is always the stand- 
ard, and that the example of practical godliness exhibited by the few 
who come nearest to that standard, restrains some from evil, and in- 
cites others to a higher measure of what is good, than they would of 
themselves have sought. Daily worship is kept up in a consider- 
able number of families, though not to the same extent as at for- 
mer periods. The average yearly number of young communicants 
that is communicants for the first time, is 5. The communi- 
cants in all are about 110, of whom 38 are on the roll as male 
heads of famihes, according to the last General Assembly's Act 
on Calls. 

During the last seven years, there have been contributed within 
the parish, partly for cleirities in the neighbourhood, and partly for 
the General Assembly's Schools and missionary objects, in whole 
about L. 112 ; making as the yearly average of such contributions 
about L. 16, 

There are only four or five families of Dissenters in the parish ; 
they are connected with the Dissenting congregations in Elgin. In 
one family, two of the members are Papists. 

Education. — The school-house is close by the church, and con- 
sists of two flats, the under containing school-room, 28 feet by 14, 
and kitchen ; the upper containing three small rooms and a closet. 
The accommodation is more than the act of Parliament requires; 



ALVES. 



113 



but the house being built close to the churchyard, and the ground 
rising on the back wall to the height of eight or ten feet, cause a 
considerable dampness. The salary is the maximum, L. 34, 4s. 
4|d., to which is added a share of the Dick bequest, probably 
L. 25 or L. 30 per annum. School fees and session clerk's fees, 
Jj. 20 ; — allowance for garden, L. 2, 2s. 9d. — Average number of 
scholars for several years past 50 ; — hours of teaching six ; va- 
cation time in winter, ten or twelve days; in harvest about six 
weeks ;— branches taught, reading, writing, arithmetic, book-keep- 
ing. Some are taught English Grammar and geography ; occa- 
sionally a few are taught Latin, Greek, and the elements of ma- 
thematics, preparatory to their attendance at Aberdeen colleges. 
The Scriptures are read once a-day by the whole school, not as a 
lesson in reading, but as a means of acquiring the knowledge of 
the truth. 

The heritors give a house and small salary to a female teacher, 
who gives instruction in sewing, knitting, &amp;c. to about twenty girls 
There is also a subscription school at the west end of the parish 
for the accommodation of several districts in this and adjoining pa- 
rishes not conveniently situated for the attendance of young'chil- 
dren at the parish schools. There are always at the Alves school 
seven boys as bursars,— their education being paid for out of the 
interest of money bequeathed by two individuals, and affording 
about L. 1 , 10s. to each. Besides the school fees being paid, there 
is a small surplus for clothing, which is given to thei parents for 
that purpose. The bursars are nominated by the kirk-session out 
of those families who seem most to require such aid. 

The schoolmaster takes charge of a parish library," consisting of 
nearly 200 volumes. The readers pay 6d. per quarter. There 
IS a juvenile library for the children, of about 80 volumes. There 
IS also one of the itinerating libraries, of 50 volumes, lent at Id 
per volume, to be returned in two weeks. This last is in con.i- 
derable demand among the farm-servants and work-people durino- 
the winter months ; and indeed that may be said to be the real 
mg with an agricultural population, their hands beino- at other 
seasons of the year so full of employment that little leisure time 
«s left to most of them. Not a few of the farmers themselves 
however, receive the newspapers regularly, sometimes three or four 
taking a share of an Edinburgh or London paper. They are p-e 
nerally intelligent and shrewd in all matters relating to aaHculture" 
zlir '" observation than from reading. Books 



114 



ELGINSHIRK. 



of history, biography, and travels, are for the most part preferred. 

To some, books on Scripture subjects are more acceptable. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — There has never been in this pa- 
rish an assessment for the poor. The average number on the roll 
is about 26, almost all above fifty years of age. It is said the 
number would be greater, were it not for the harvest-work, by 
which some gain an addition to their small means by thraving. A 
distribution of money is made to the poor by the minister and el- 
ders at the church on a week-day, three times a year. They re- 
ceive in all from 15s. or L, 1, to L. 1, 10s. each yearly. The funds 
for this purpose are supplied chiefly from the contributions at 
church on the Sabbath, collected not at the door, but in hand 
boxes carried round by the elders before the congregation is dis- 
missed. The average weekly collection is 10s. There is like- 
wise the yearly interest of a small sum mortified for the poor. A 
poor person when admitted on the roll of paupers for the first time 
is required to sign an obligation to the kirk-session, giving them a 
preferable right to any money, furniture, &amp;c. which the individual 
may be found possessed of at the time of his decease ; and autho- 
rizing the kirk-treasurer to take thereof to the amount of what the 
pauper had received out of the poor funds. The effect of this re- 
gulation is to prevent any from seeking to be admitted on the roll, 
▼/ho, having some means of their own, or relatives able to assist 
them, are not proper objects of public charity. It is evident that 
the sum given out of the session funds cannot be suflRcientfor the 
yearly maintenance of any one. Even all the items which make 
up the yearly provision of several persons, must be acknowledged 
to make but a frugal provision : these are, 

From the kirk-session yearly, say - - » L. 1 10 0 

Work in harvest for rent of house, . - " _ 0 10 0 

24 bolls of potatoes from their own planting on the farmer's green crop field, 0 15 0 
Occasional supplies of oatmeal from the farmer, - - 10 0 

Do. do. of fuel and other articles, - . 0 15 0 

L. 4 10 0 

This is the whole of the yearly provision of such poor persons as 
are unable to do out-work, except for a short time in the harvest. 
Formerly, spinning was the great source of maintenance for old 
women ; and since that was done away nothing has come in its 
place for them. 

The average yearly collections at the church for the poor amount 
to about L. 01. To this are added several small sums from mor- 



BELLIE. 



115 



tifications, churchyard dues, &amp;c. making the receipts in all about 
L. 45 yearly ; out of which, besides the regular allowance to those 
on tlie roll, extra supplies are given in cases of sickness, funeral 
expenses are paid, &amp;c. also the session-clerk, precentor, and church 
officer ; so that there is but a small sum reserved in hand ; and 
probably so much the better, — for it seems to be generally ac- 
knowledged that, wherever a large fund is accumulated, the claim- 
ants increase in number. 

Gray's Hospital at Elgin, to which the poor of all the parishes 
within the county have access, on presenting the certificate of their 
parish minister, is of incalculable benefit ; and the lunatic asy- 
lum, lately attached to it, capable of receiving ten patients at a 
time, is likely to be found a valuable addition for the relief of the 
parishes of this county.

PRESBYTERY OF STRATHBOGIE, SYNOD OF MORAY. 

THE REV. DAVID DEWAR, MINISTER. 



L — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The name has been traced by some to the Gaelic 
Bellaidth, signifying broom ; and by others to Beid-aith, signify- 
ing the mouth of the ford. 

Boundaries, Extent, c. — The parish is of an oblong quadran- 
gular figure, but narrower at the northern than at the opposite ex- 
treme. Its length, from north to south varies from 5 to 6 miles. 
Its greatest breadth is 4 miles ; its mean breadth 3 ; and its su- 
perficial contents in square miles, very nearly 19. The Spey is 
the boundary on the west; the Moray Frith on the north ; Rath- 
ven on the east; Keith and Boharm on the south. 

Meteorology. — The following meteorological table, embracing a 
period of ten successive years, is extracted from a register care- 
fully kept by an eminent naturalist, who long resided at Gordon 
Castle.

Hydrography. — This parish is abundantly supplied with water. 
The numerous perennial springs are, in general, exuberant, beau- 
tifully clear, and admirably fitted for domestic purposes. Some 
powerful chalybeates are seen at intervals depositing a strong fer- 
ruginous residuum, and tempt the invalid to try their healing 
virtues, but hitherto without any remarkable effect. Two of our 
springs have been honoured with the names of patron saints. The 
Mary well, which rises near the centre of the parish, and St John's 
well, in one of the upper districts, were both frequented by su- 
perstitious votaries, in less enlightened times. 

There are several lochs or natural collections of water among 
our woods, the resort of wild-duck and other aquatic fowl ; and 
one highly ornamental artificial lake, fed by several copious springs, 
with an island in the centre, and fringed with a circuit of stately 
trees, constitutes one of the most picturesque beauties which adorn 
the delightful scenery in the vicinity of Gordon Castle. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The most remarkable feature in the 
mineralogy of this parish, is what is termed the " red rock," con- 



BELLIE. 



117 



sistingof a mixture of dark-coloured argillaceous a iid siliceous earths. 
It is imbedded in loose and decompounded strata of the same con- 
stituent elements, which form a very superior binding for roads 
and garden-walks, for which purposes it is in great request. 
Huge masses of this red sandstone are occasionally found, and 
broken down for various architectural uses. Some portions of the 
" rock" are very hard when first dug from the quarry, but it is lia- 
ble to be corroded, and to moulder away when long exposed to the 
weather, and on that account, when employed in the outer courses 
of buildings, it is usually overcast with a thick coating of lime. 
The breccia, or pudding-stone, is frequently found imbedded in 
this rock ; and on the beach of the river, some beautiful pebbles and 
fragments of asbestos have been occasionally picked up, which 
have probably been washed from the mountains by heavy floods. 
Some micaceous schistus and stalactitical accretions also reward 
the search of the collector. 

Soil. — The soil of the lower district of the parish is chiefly light and 
sandy, and, although interspersed with some patches of barren gra- 
vel, is productive on the whole in moist seasons. Where the stillness 
of the waters, by which it was evidently at one period overflown, 
allowed the alluvial deposit to become deep and extensive, it con- 
sists of a rich and fertile loam. The under stratum is wholly of 
gravel and stones, formerly the bed of the river or the sea. The 
coast along its whole extent, and to the breadth of about a-quar- 
ter of a mile, is entirely sterile. The lands near the eastern 
boundary are also sandy and light. The south-eastern and high-, 
est part of the parish is chiefly barren uncultivated moor, swelling 
into hills of various forms, of which the eastern range consists, 
in general, of the ''schistus cceruleus," or blue slate, whilst that on 
the south and west is chiefly composed of a red and very tenacious 
clay, intermixed with gravel and small stones. Among these ele- 
vated grounds, there are a few farms of clayey loam, with a mix- 
ture of moss, which would be highly productive, were it not that 
the climate here is unfavourable, and the harvest usually late. 

Zoology. — Some rare and beautiful birds of passage have been 
occasionally recognized in our fields and ponds ; and a list of the 
most noted of these migratory strangers that were intercepted in 
their flight, may not be unacceptable to the scientific reader. 
They were shot by the Duke of Gordon or some of his Grace's 
visitors, in the neighbourhood of Gordon Castle.

Botany. — The Listera or tvvay-blade, the Goodyera repens and 
LinncBa horealis may be reckoned the rarest of our indigenous 
plants. The Trientalis Europcea or chickweed winter-green, 
also unfolds its beautiful stars in our copses and glens, mingling 
with the flowers of the Oxalis acetusella or wood sorrel ; and the 
Asperula odorata or sweet woodroof, is found in great abundance, 
growing wild in a small glen on the south-eastern border of the 
parish. Our prevailing forest trees are the Scotch fir, with a few 
thriving plantations of larches and birch. Some majestic limes, 
horse-chestnuts, and planes, with stately rows of beeches and elms, 
and a great variety of ornamental trees, adorn the extensive lawns 
and scenery at Gordon Castle. And one delightful spot has long 
been known by the name of the " Holly Bank," from the superior 
growth and profusion of this beautiful evergreen, with which it is 
chiefly covered. 

A magnificent lime-tree on the south lawn of the Castle usual- 
ly attracts the admiration of strangers. It has the appearance of 
three stems incorporated into one, and its pensile branches, which 
are enclosed with a tasteful rustic pallisade, cover a space of the 
immense circumference of 300 feet. 

II. — Civil History. 

Antiquities. — To the north of Gordon Castle, are the re- 
mains of a military station, which early tradition assigned to the 
Danes, but which in later times has long been known by the 
appellation of the " Roman camp." Those who ascribe it to 
the Danes suppose it to have been connected with a battle 
which they fought with the Scots in the neighbourhood of Cul- 
len ; but, as the Roman Eagles were once certainly displayed 
upon the banks of the ancient Tuessis or Spey, it is generally 
supposed that this encampment was formed by a detachment of 
Agricola's troops, when he traversed the coasts of our island, and 
may have been intended to cover the ford of the river, which at 
that period probably ran along the base of the bank where the 
station is placed. Its quadrangular form, with its rampart and 
ports, seem also to indicate, with some degree of certainty, that it

belonged to the conquerors of the world. S me years ago, the 
fosse was cleared by order of the proprietor, but no relics of anti- 
quity were found, with the exception of a few aniulets or beads of 
party-coloured stone. It is now, in some places, overrun with 
whins and broom, and in other parts has been recently planted 
with clumps of trees and shrubs, to serve as a peaceful covert for 
the brood of pheasants and other game. A little to the north of 
this encampment, there was lately to be seen a tumulus or mound 
known by the name of the " Green Cairn ;" supposed to be the 
tomb of some chieftain of ancient renown. It consisted of a belt 
of earth of the richest mould, interposed between a casement of 
pebbles, and was encompassed at the base with two ranges of 
stones in a vertical position. 

A little to the east of this spot, on one of the banks of what is 
termed the "dry burn," there are the remains of a Druidical temple. 

Another antiquity deserving notice, is a small mound of earth, 
a little to the north of the fore-mentioned temple, apparently 
artificial, called the " Court Hillock," which in former times was 
probably a seat of justice. The ancient Cross of Fochabers may 
also be mentioned, now standing within the Duke of Richmond's 
park. 

New Buildings. — By far the most magnificent of these is Gor- 
don Castle, the princely seat of the distinguished family of Rich- 
mond. This superb and elegant structure, extending from east to 
west the enormous length of nearly 570 feet, is situated towards 
the south-western angle of the lowest of the three extensive semi- 
circular " flats" into which the parish is divided. It is universally 
allowed to be one of the noblest specimens of architectural ma. 
mficence to be found in Britain, and is the grand object of attrac- 
tion to all travellers who visit this quarter of the island. On the 
llth of July 1827, the roof and interior of the eastern wing were 
totally destroyed by an accidental fire, but the destroyed parts 
have since been restored in a suitable magnificence. The neces- 
sary brevity of this article prohibits a detailed account of many 
objects of interest connected with this magnificent mansion. 

A square of offices was completed, some years ago, at the castle 
farm-yard, presenting a range of buildings which, for amplitude, 
utility, and elegance, are certainly unrivalled by any in the north. 

A neat Episcopal chapel has just been erected by the Duchess 
of Gordon, with Gothic windows and two ornamental spires, 
on the north side of the village of Fochabers, opposite the parish

church, and exactly within the southern verge of the castle grounds. 
It consists of two storeys, of which the place of worship constitutes 
the highest, that upon the ground being occupied as an infant 
school, comprehending the necessary apartments for the accom- 
modation of the teacher. 

On the glebe, an excellent manse, with offices, was lately built 
on a liberal scale. It is pleasingly situated on a rising-ground 
near the eastern bank of the Spey, commanding an extensive view 
of the valley of the river and surrounding country. 

III. — PorULATION. 
The number of residenters in the village of Fochabers, accord- 
ing to the last return, was 1086. In he landward districts, there

The whole parish, with the exception of the domains surround- 
ing the castle, was in former times partitioned out into small estates 
or landships, which were held in feu of the Gordon family. Dal- 
lachy was divided into several parts. The two Auchinreaths were 
separate estates ; Auchinhalrig was a wadsett, and Tynet, Tul- 
loch, and Braes had each their respective lairds. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The agricultural state of the parish will be ascer- 
tained by the following statement, which, it is believed, is pretty 
accurate : 

Imperial acres. 
Arable, . . . 3658 
Pasture, . . . 643 
Wood, . . , 2852 
Moor, . . , 4832 

Water, . , , 13 
Turnpike roads, . . 50 

Total, . 12048 
Husbandry c. — Since the powerful impulse imparted by the 
high prices of grain during the late war, agriculture has been car- 
ried on with increasing spirit. A large portion of the lower part 
of the parish is parcelled out into small farms, consisting often of 
detached acres, of which the rents are paid by wages earned at 
the Spey fishing. In the upper districts, the farms are larger, but 
there are few of any considerable extent. The leases are in ge- 
neral for nineteen years, and the average rent of arable land is 
18s. per imperial acre. The most prevailing mode of cultivation 

is the rotation of six, and in some mstances of five courses. Bar-

ley was wont to be the staple crop, but since the suppression of 
illicit distillation in the Highlands, which lessens the demand for 
that produce, wheat is very generally cultivated, yielding from seven 
to nine returns.- Oats are still in favour, but not so extensively sown 
as formerly. Potatoes and turnips form on every farm a large 
proportion of the crop. The fields are well dressed, and, in addi- 
tion to the manure of the stable and farm-yard, and sea-weed or 
" ware" which were formerly used, lime is now very generally 
adopted, botli as a compost and spread in an unmixed state upon 
the field. Considerable quantities of herring soil from the fishing 
station at Port- Gordon, are now also purchased by the fcirmer, and 
made into compost both for turnip and wheat. Bone manure has 
likewise been tried, in some instances, with considerable success. 

Live-Stock. — The black-cattle amount to about 690 ; horses to 
166; and sheep to 1370. i 

Produce. — The average annual gross amount of raw produce 
raised in the parish may be reckoned as follows, .upon a moderate 
calculation, viz. 

Produce of grain of every description, . . L. 7659 0 0 

potato, turnip, and green crop, . . 992 0 0 

hay, .... . 1875 0 0 

On grazing cattle and pasturing sheep during the season, . 1032 0 0 
Annual thinning of wood, .... 1000 0 0 

Average produce of the Spey fishing, . . , 16,400 0 0 

Miscellaneous produce, . . . 15Q o 0 



Total, . L. 29,108 0 0 
Salmon-Fishing. — The salmon-fishing of the Spey has long 
been famous. It extends from the mouth of the river about 
nine or ten miles, and yields a revenue. to the Duke of Richmond 
of L. 8200 Sterling a year. By a recent enactment of the Legis- 
lature, the fishing begins on the 1st of February, and ends on the 
14th September. Salmon trout appear in the end of March, and 
grilse about the beginning of June. A spacious mansion for the 
gentlemen holding the lease, with an extensive court and range 
of buildings commodiously fitted for every purpose connected with 
the fishings, occupies a prominent station on the beach near the 
mouth of the river. The greater part of the fish is sent to 
London, covered with ice, in boxes peculiarly constructed for the 
purpose. Eight smacks are constantly employed in this traffic 
durmg the season, each at the expense of L. 40 a month. The 
demand in the English market is usually so great, that the price 
of salmon is always high on the river side, being usually sold 
at Is. 6d. per lb. to the 1st of June, when it falls during the re- 



122 



ELGINSHIRE. 



mainder of the season to Is. Grilse of five lb. and under are sold 
at 7d. ; and if of a greater weight at 8d. per lb. Trout are 9d. 
to the 1st of June, and after that are 5d. per lb. The fishing is 
with nets and small boats, each with seven men and a kenner," 
who is princeps of the band. Some alterations are occasionally 
introduced in the management of this extensive concern; and the 
whole fishing, by the present regulation, is to be conducted in fu- 
ture by twelve bands, each consisting of eight men. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Markets -c. — Six markets, in the course of the year, for cattle 
and horses, but chiefly the former, are held at Fochabers, our prin- 
cipal village. The markets are held on the first Wednesday of 
January, the fourth of March, and May ; the second Wednesday 
of August ; and the fourth of October and December. The vil- 
lage of Fochabers is placed on a rising ground where a small ri- 
vulet unites with the Spey. It is a burgh of barony,- and is built 
on a neat and regular plan, with a large square in the centre, 
planted on each side with trees and flowering shrubs. 

Ecclesiastical State. — By far the greater part of the people are 
of the Established Church. There are only a few families of the 
Episcopal persuasion. The Roman Catholics, who are more nu- 
merous, have of late years erected a chapel in the village of Foch- 
abers. They have another place of worship about four miles dis- 
tant, on the eastern border of the parish, where their clergyman 
resides. He is under the control of a bishop, who has lately built 
a very excellent mansion for himself in the neighbouring parish of 
Rathven. 

The Enzie mission has just been erected into a parish, quoad 
sacra; and the small village of Auchinhalrig, and a large thinly 
peopled district of the Braes of Enzie have been detached from 
the parish of Bellie and annexed to it. 

The stipend of Bellie is made up, by an annual grant from the 
Exchequer, to the minimum allowance of L. 150 a year. The 
glebe consists of about twelve acres, The Duke of Richmond is 
patron of the parish. 

Education, c. — There are no fewer than fourteen schools 
in the parish ; viz. one parochial, three partly supported bv the 
Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge ; one infant school 
established by the Duchess of Gordon ; three that are only par- 
tially endowed ; two by teachers on their own adventure ; three 
Sabbath-schools, and one winter evening-school. The parish

schoolmaster has all the legal accommodations, with maximum sa- 
lary of L. 34, 4s. 4d. a year. The school fees amount to nearly 
L.-20. He has also his accustomed fees as session- clerk, and an 
annual allowance from the Dick bequest. 

Literature, Sfc. — We have one Subscription Library in Foch- 
abers, and two Itinerating Libraries, with 50 approved works in 
each, presented to the parish by the late Duke and the Duchess 
of Gordon, all affording to numerous readers much solid instruc- 
tion and useful entertainment. Under the same distinguished pa- 
tronage, a society was formed for disseminating the Scriptures, and 
co-operating with kindred institutions, under the denomination of 
the " Fochaber Association for Religious purposes." 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The principal funds for the main- 
tenance of the poor are from contributions of individuals, the in- 
terest of a little money, and the usual collections in the parish 
church. Tliey average about L.70 a-year. There are upwards 
of 50 paupers upon the roll ; but private liberality prevents any 
thing like absolute destitution. The collections in church average 
about L. 1 3 a-quarter. There are a considerable number of families 
who enjoy the privilege of what is called the " Bede Meal," an 
ancient provision of the Gordon family, chiefly for the support of 
old men. Private alms are liberally given, and the people in ge- 
neral are charitably disposed.

PRESBYTERY OF ABERNETHY, SYNOD OF MORAY. 

THE REV. WILLIAM GRANT, MINISTER. 



I.— Topography and Natural History. 
iVane.— The ancient name of the parish was Gleann a cheat/ier- 
nich~ihe Heroes' Glen— probably derived from the extensive 
power possessed by its ancient proprietors, and from the many 
brave feats performed by them in the defence of their widely scat- 
tered domains from the encroachments of neighbouring chieftains, 
as well as from their success in arresting the predatory incursions

of the Locbaber reivers to Moray land. Its modern name is evi- 
dently derived from the Gaelic Tuathil, north, in opposition to 
Deishal, south, the name of a considerable stripe of land in the 
southern district of the parish. 

Extent' and Boundaries. — The parish may be about 16 miles 
long by 13 miles broad. It is bounded on the north and north- 
east by the parishes of Ardclach and Cawdor; north-west, by 
the united parishes of Moy and Delarossie ; south-west, by Alvie ; 
east, by Inverallan ; and on the south, by the Spey, which di- 
vides it from the united parishes of Abernethy and Kincardine. 
Its figure is nearly that of an oblong square. 

Topographical Appearance, SfC. — The appearance of the parish 
is hilly. Along the whole of the north side, there runs a continu- 
ed range of hill, commencing at the north-eastern extremity, and 
running westward in a direct line, till it terminates in the Monadh- 
lia, an extensive range common to the districts of Badenoch, 
Strathdearn, and Stratherrick. The only interruption to the con- 
tinuity of this range, is the narrow pass or ravine of Slocmuic, 
through which the great highland road between Inverness and 
Perth passes. The only natural production peculiar to this rano-e, 
as well as to many smaller hills projecting from it, is heather, with 
a sprinkling of small verdant patches at considerable distance from 
one another, which relieves the eye in some measure from the 
sombre monotony of the general landscape. Parallel to this range 
there is another in the south side of the parish, much lower than 
the range already mentioned, but equally barren in natural pro- 
ductions. This range commences eastward in Craig Ghartin, and 
expands in breadth till it terminates in Craigelachie, the slo- 
gan hill of the Grants, which divides Strathspey from Badenoch, 
and the county of Moray from Inverness, in that direction. Be- 
tween these two parallel ranges, is the narrow valley of the Dulnan, 
bisected by the stream from which the valley derives its name. 
Between the southern range and the Spey, is a narrow stripe of 
land, extending the whole length of the parish. 

Soil. — The soil is of two kinds. That on the banks of the 
Dulnan and Spey is chiefly alluvial, with a deep clay subsoil. In 
the more elevated situations, its general characteristic is thin and 
gravelly, with a considerable intermixture of stones. In favour- 
able seasons, the haugh grounds yield heavy crops of oats ; and 
since the year 1827 till 1834, both included, the higher grounds 
nave, under the joint influence of favourable seasons, and an im- 



DUTIIIL.

proved system of husbandry, yielded excellent crops of oats, bear, 
barley, turnips, and potatoes. 

Climate. — The cold season may be said to commence, in gene- 
ral, early in November, and to end in May ; yet, notwithstanding 
the long continuance of the cold season, the climate is the reverse 
of unhealthy. The prevailing diseases are rheumatism and scro- 
fula, — the former proceeding in some measure from the people's 
inattention to add to their summer dress, when the winter colds set 
in. The latter may be ascribed to the low innutritious food on 
which many of the poorer inhabitants were, of necessity, in years of 
scarcity obliged to subsist. In the summers of 1808, 1816, and 
1817, many families subsisted for several successive weeks on the 
tops of nettles, mugwort, turnip thinnings, and milk, without 
any corn food ; and such as subsisted on this miserable substitute 
for food, are labouring under the latter disease. 

Fissures. — About four miles north of the parish church, there is 
a rocky hill, projecting in front of the main range, called Craig na 
Holar, the eagle's eyrie, or crag. In this hill there are several fis- 
sures. One of them, near the west end, is from the top to the bot- 
tom of the hill. Its appearance is as if it were cut with a sharp 
weapon. 

Hydrography. — If we except three or four small lakes of a few 
furlongs in circumference, there is little in this department de- 
serving of notice. Loch Bhruach, situated on the summit of the 
northern range of hills, abounds with very fine trout, resembling 
in colour the mossy bottom of the loch in which they live. In two 
of the other lochs, there are some pike ; and in one of these, viz. 
the loch of Tullochgriban, some water snakes have been recent- 
ly seen. 

The Dulnan is the only river properly belonging to the parish. 
Its source is in the Badenoch hills. It flows from west to east till 

' The tradition respecting its formation is sufficiently wild. As the formation of 
this natural phenomenon could not be otherwise accounted for by the limited under- 
standing of the inhabitants, they ascribe it to the prowess of the Fingalian hero, 
wlio, on a certain day, had left his residence in the lowlands of Moray, and had gone 
to the forests of Glenmore and Benavin, for the double purjjose of enjoying the 
amusement of the chace, and of replenishing his larder. Having that day, by some 
fatality, neglected to propitiate the favour of Cailleach a ghlinnc mhor, an ill-natur- 
ed spirit in the unamiable shape of an old withered beldame, who lorded with potent 
sway over man and beast that came within the boundaries of her sylvan domains 
though tantalized with the sight of more game on that day than lie had ever seen on' 
any former visit, he had the mortification to catch none. Returning homeward in 
the evening, weary in body, and his mind chafed with disappointment, he was cut- 
ting figures in the air with his sword, till at last, in a fit of frenzy, he struck the 
end of the hill with his sword, ly which he made the fissure alluded to. Hence the 
fissure IS called " beum a chlaidheamh"_the sword's cleft.

it falls into the Spey at Belentomb of Inverallan. Though in ge- 
neral but a small stream, it frequently happens that, when swollen 
with heavy rains, or the melting of the snow on the adjacent hills, 
it does considerable damage to the corn and grass fields near its 
banks. 

It is evident, that the whole surface of this country, at some re- 
mote period, had been covered with a dense forest. In cutting 
peals, or in digging for the roots of fir trees in the deep mosses, it 
is no unusual thing to meet with two or three roots piled one above 
another, as if, phoenix-like, the one grew out of the ashes of its 
predecessors. It is equally evident, from the many remains of 
wolf-traps that are to be met with in the different passes through- 
out the hills, that wolves had been at one time numerous. So dar- 
ing were they, when impelled by hunger, that there are instances 
on record, of their having left their natives haunts, to levy black- 
mail from among the live-stock of the inhabitants. 

A short time previous to their extirpation from this district, a 
v/oman that resided on the farm of Lochanhully about a mile to 
the westward of the church, and had been returning from a neigh- 
bour's house with a gridiron or girdle in her hand, was met by a 
huge animal of this kind in a narrow lane near her own house. To 
return would have been inevitable destruction, and to proceed, her 
ferocious enemy signified, by his growling accents, that shedare not. 
They thus, for a few moments, stood gazing at one another, when the 
animal sprung upon its prey; but, as he was in the act of seizing her, 
she, by a well-directed stroke of the edge of the gridiron, cleft his 
head in two, and laid him lifeless at her feet. In commemoration 
of this feat, the lane is called Clais a Mhadidh — the cur's hollow 
or lane. 

About the beginning of the last century, the forest of Dut- 
hil or Dulnanside was destroyed by fire. The few wolves that 
escaped the dreadful conflagration, found a miserable shelter 
among a small clump of trees that by some means escaped the ge- 
neral conflagration. In this last covert, they were not long permitted 
to remain unmolested. The people rose en masse and destroyed 
them, with the exception of an overgrown animal that escap- 
ed the general carnage, by fleeing across the hills to the east- 
ern part of the parish of Moy. It had not been long in that 
district, when the inhabitants had a fearful warning of its be- 
ing among them, by its killing a woman and her infant child. As 
soon as the laird of Mackintosh heard of this melancholy event, he 



DUTIIIL. 



55ummoned his vassals to attend on a certain day on the banks of 
the Findhorn, for the purpose of destroying this formidable enemy. 
Their intentions were, however, anticipated by a daring fellow, that 
lived in the eastern extremity of the parish, who, as he was on his 
way to join the rest of his clansmen, was met by the very animal 
in question, in an exceedingly narrow path in the face of a rock, cal- 
led Creig achrochdan, and overhanging the river. As it was impos- 
sible for either party to recede, they boldly advanced, each bent up- 
on his opponent's destruction ; when the man, by a well-directed 
stroke of his club, brought his foe to the ground. With his dirk 
he cut off the animal's head, and carried it as a trophy of his vic- 
tory to the place of meeting. On his arrival, the laird reproached 
him for his tardiness ; when the man with affected contempt re- 
plied, that he believed he came sufficiently soon for all that was to do. 
As the laird was about to reproach him in somewhat more bitter 
terms, he drew the wolf's bleeding head from under his plaid, and 
threw it at his chieftain's feet. Thus perished the last of the na- 
tive inhabitants of the forest of Glenchearnich. — The other ani- 
mals are such as are peculiar to the neighbouring districts, viz. 
deer, roe, hares, rabbits, foxes, badgers, otters, wild-cats, and wea- 
sels. The principal of our reptile tribe are the snake ancV li- 
zards. The black snail is peculiar to a certain district of the parish. 
Toads are entire strangers. 

Salmon, river-trout, and eels are the only fish in the Dulnan. 
The former come up to spawn in the months of October and No- 
vember; and such as escape the poacher's leister return to the sea, 
by the end of the last-mentioned month. 

Insects.— In the beginning of July 1815, during several days of 
intense heat, all the birch in the parish was completely stripped of 
its foliage, by a large blackish-coloured species of caterpillar. During 
these few days, the thermometer was seldom under 90° in the 
shade. 

Birds.— The feathered game consists of grouse, partridges, 
plovers, snipe, lapwings, wild -ducks, and some ptarmigan. Of late 
years, black game has been very abundant, but, as a natural conse- 
quence, as the latter multiplied, the former have become lessplen- 
tiful. ' 

Forests.—ln the upper part of the northern district of the pa- 
rish, there is an extensive forest of natural Scotch fir. For the ma 
nufacturing of the timber, there are two saw-mills of two saws each', 

 Since the above was written, rats have become very numerous.

driven by the waters of the Dulnan. About thirty years ago, an 
extensive tract of barren moor had been planted by the late Sir 
James Grant along the northern banks of the Spey, which is in 
a very thriving state. The district is well supplied with natural 
birch ; scattered partly in clumps through the forest, and partlv 
detached, by which the landscape is greatly enlivened, and the 
eye relieved from dwelling continually upon a scenery composed, 
without this latter addition, of lugubrious heath-covered hills, and 
cypress-coloured forests. To the fir, birch, and alder, the climate 
appears very congenial. 

II. — Civil History. 
Tradition ascribes the possession not only of this parish, but of 
almost all the lands adjoining the Spey between Inverlochy and 
Fochabers to the Cummings, whose principal residence was in 
this parish. Be this as it may, it is evident they were in possession 
of the greater part of the said district, many years before 1280 ; 
as appears by a charter granted in that'year by Gilbert, the third 
lord of that name, or, as he is called in the charter, tertius Domi- 
nus de Glencherny, Knight, with consent of Matilda, his spouse, 
Gilbert, his eldest son, of the lands of Gerbothy, with pertinents 
for homage and service. This charter is granted on the feast of 
the Purification of the Holy Virgin at Glencherny ; the reddenda 
being " unura per albarum Cyrothicarum, fortasse Cherothi- 
carum." These lands of Gerbothy are situated near the banks of 
the Fiddich, parish of Boharm. By another charter of Gilbert 
de Glencherny. he gives to Duncan of Ferindrawth in libero mari- 
tagio with Margery his daughter, and their heirs, the eastern half 
of the Davoch of Conynges, "per suas rectas divisas in tenemente 
de Abernethyn." Among other witnesses to this deed are found the 
names of Archibald and Henry, Bishops of Moray and Aber- 
deen. Though the deed bears no date, yet, as Archibald was 
Bishop of Moray from 125.3 to 1298, and Henry, of Aberdeen, from 
1281 to 1298, between the first and last year of Henrv the char- 
ter must have been granted. From various other charters still ex- 
tant, it appears that, from the last-mentioned period, the overgrown 
power of the Lords of Glenchernich was fast declining, as they dis- 
posed of davoch after davoch of their property, for homage which 
in many cases was but reluctantly paid them, and for services 
which were but imperfectly performed. Gilbert, the last of the 
Lords of Glenchernich, better known by his soubriquet of Gibbon 
Mor, had the mortification, on succeeding to the property, of find- 



DUTHIL 



129 



ing- his pafernal acres in the possession of others, with the excep- 
tion of Glenchernich and Belindalloch. With these his power 
seemed also to vanish. For the purpose of propping his falling 
greatness, and of checking the growing power of the Grants, be- 
tween whom and the Cummings there had been a hostile rivalship 
for many generations, he had recourse to a no less singular than 
ludicrous expedient. At Gibbon's door, there stood a large stone 
cistern for keeping water for the fowls. When any applied for per- 
mission to join Gibbon's standard, if the applicant's appearance in- 
dicated, that he would be an .acquisition to the clan, he was seized 
by the heels, and with ludicrous solemnity, plunged three times 
head foremost into this dirty font. After this immersion, he was 
not only entitled to bear the name of Gumming, but enjoyed all 
the privileges peculiar to the clan. Hence their descendants are 
called « Cuiminich clach na'n cearc,"— the Cummings of the hen 
trough. Independent of this ludicrous expedient, to which the 
proud chieftain resorted, he had the mortification to see his own 
power fast declining, and his rival's increasing in an inverse ratio, 
when his only daughter and heiress caused a cessation of hostilities, 
by giving her hand to the rival chieftain, Sir John Grant of Freuchy, 
naturally hoping that, at no distant period, her good-natured father 
would withhold from her neither his blessing nor his acres. 

By this act of Gibbon's daughter, the feuds between the rival 
clans subsided so completely, that Gibbon Mor, in the year 1364, 
ceded his lordship of Glenchernich, not to his son-in-law, Sir John, 
but to his grandson, Sir Duncan Grant of Freuchy. This transfer 
had been subsequently confirmed by a charter from King David, 
dated the same year, — and, by an instrument of sastne pro- 
ceedmg on a precept from King James' chancery, for infeftin 
John Grant de Freuchy son of Sir Duncan in the lands of Glen- 
chernich and Belindalloch, with the mills, &amp;c. The dispensing 
clause makes " locum de Mulquuharde, principale messuagium die- 
tarum terrarum," and accordingly the infeftment was taken there 
the 8th April 1499. Since that period, the parish has been the ' 
undisputed property of the chief of the Grants. 

Considering the isolated situation of the parish, and the deadly 
feuds and bloody broils in which the inhabitants were too frequent- 
ly engaged in days of yore, it will excite no surprise that its an- 
nals record but few, if any, men who became eminent in the arts 
and sciences peculiar to social and peaceful life. But if we mioht

we could mention many, from the recital of whose reckless deeds 
in the shedding of human blood, we should recoil with horror. 

From among many, we shall select John Macandrew of Delna- 
hartnich, who, on account of his diminutive size, obtained the cog- 
nomen of Ian beag Macandra, little John Macandrew. At the 
period in question, the laird or tacksman of Achaluachrach, previ- 
ous to his union with a yoiing maiden of his own country, made a 
predatory incursion into the lowlands, from whence he carried away 
all the best cattle belonging to Rose of Kilravock, in Nairnshire. 
He reached in safety with his booty as far as the Cro-clach, in the 
braes of Strathdearn, where he rested for the night. While the 
hungry cattle fed with eagerness upon the rich pasture of this ce- 
lebrated glen, the freebooters fared no less sumptuously, on a 
plentiful supply of broiled steaks, from the buttocks of one of the 
fattest of the beeves. So secure did the reivers consider them- 
selves from pursuit, that they did not use the precaution of setting a 
proper watch, but entrusted this important post to a boy who 
followed them from home ; who no sooner had his post assigned 
him, than, overcome by fatigue, he threw himself down on the heath 
and fell fast asleep. Though Kilravock was far advanced in 
life, and lame besides, he no sooner missed his cattle, than he 
collected the most efficient of his retainers, and issued the crois 
taridhf and followed the tract of his cattle ; so that by the time 
he came in sight of the beasts, he found himself at the head of a 
numerous and resolute band ; among whom our hero held an ad- 
vanced post. Though Kilravock's party outnumbered the reivers, 
so assured were they of encountering a formidable resistance, that 
they used every necessary precaution. Being, by the concurring 
favourable circumstances of the darkness of the'night, and som- 
nolency of the faithless sentinel, enabled to surround the bothy, 
in which the reivers were feasting, a shower of arrows from the 
pursuers was the first intimation they had of danger. The bothy 
was so closely besieged as to admit of no egress ; those within 
laboured under the disadvantage of shooting at random, where- 
as the pursuers were so favoured by the light within the bothy, 
that their arrows did fearful execution. John Macandrew's eye was 
in search of the chief, whom he soon recognized amid his follow- 
ers, by the superiority of his dress ; an arrow from John's bow, pin- 
ned him to the beam against which he leaned ; which feat was no 

sooner observed by Mackintosh of Kyleachy, than he exclaimed 

" Dia as buaidh leat Ian Mhic Anndra, tha thamh an Dalnahait- 



DUTHIL.

nich" — God and victory be with you John Macandrew that dwell 
in Dalnahaitnich. Upon hearing this ill timed compliment, which 
he knew would subject him to considerable danger, if any of the 
freebooters should escape, he indignantly replied — "Mile Molachd 
air do theang' Ian chaim Choilachi" — a thousand curses on vour 
tongue, gleyed John of Kyleachy. The result of this dreadful fray 
was the destruction of the miserable reivers, for whose slauofhtered 
bodies the hut in which they fell, formed a funeral pile. None 
returned to tell the tale, but the faithless sentinel, who had been 
witness of this onslaught; but who, by the darkness of the night, 
was enabled to remove to a distance from danger. 

Connected with the parish by burial, is the celebrated Jacobite 
bard, Ian Manndach or Lorn. After the total defeat at Culloden 
of the unfortunate party, whose feats he had so often panegyrized, 
John fled across the river Nairn, towards the hills to the south 
of the Held of battle, where he skulked, till hunger compelled 

• Not long after this bloody scene, John, as he anticipated at the time, had sub, 
stantial cause to curse Kyleachy for his ill-timed compliment. A party of strano-ers 
had been seen skulkmg through the woods and hills near John's house. Their d'ress 
betrayed their country, and their skulking, with equal certainty, indicated their 
business. John, notwithstanding his vigilance, was overtaken one day by these men 
as he was looking after his cattle. They asked him if he knew John IVJacandrew 
—he answered in the affirmative. Being offered a sixpence, if he would conduct them 
to his house, John readily pocketed the bribe and led the way. On his arrival, he 
told his wife that the strangers wanted his master, and wished to know if he was at 
iiome. His wife, with great presence of mind, entered into his views in carryino- on 
the deception he being taken on account of diminutive size for the herd, toldthe 
men that her husband was not at present within, but that she expected him to return 
soon, and requested them to rest till his return, with which request they readily com- 
plied. In order to enable her husband to mature whatever plans he miht devise 
for extricating himself from his present danger ; she, with well-feigned lu,spitality, 
laid aplenlitul supply of bannocks and milk before the strangers. While the men were 
partaking of his wife's viands, John was amusing himself at the fire side in bcndinr 
a bow, which seemed to he far beyond the strength of his diminutive body, when a 
smart slap on the side of the head from his wife's" brawny arm caused John to start 
tlT"n jn'-p'r' unc-oncern ; she desiring him at the same time to look after hiscat- 
lowLl Si A A V 'TT '■"'•""g ith apparent n luctnnce, sneaked 

towards he door, and c imbed up to the top of a close -topped fir tree that stood at a 
short distance from his door where he had roosted by night, ever since the slaughter 
at Cro-clach,and where he had a bow and a plentiful stock of arrows. No sooner did 
he safely ensconce himself in his eyrie, than he cried out that his master was coming. 
This being heard by the party within, they hastened out one after another ; but no 
sooner did each appear outside the door, than he fell by an arrow from John's bow. 
Thus fell Achaluachrach s avengers, as if by some invisible agent. A few small green 
hillocks, with a plentiTul crop of nettles, the natural products of the grave, pointed 
out where the mortal remains of those misguided men had been deposited but the 
desolating aood of 1829, so graphically dercribed by Sir T. D. Lauder, in h"s Ic' 
count of the Floods in Morayshire, has completely obliterated these. TMs tra4

him to seek a place of retreat more suitable to his miserable con- 
dition. On the second or third evening after the defeat of his 
party, he arrived, faint, weary, and broken-hearted at the little 
farm-house of Lochanhully, on the banks of the Dulnan, where 
he experienced as much kind hospitality from the humane land- 
lord, as his limited circumstances would admit of. As soon as his 
immediate wants were relieved, John laid his weary limbs on that 
bed, from which he was destined never to rise again. As it soon 
appeared evident to the landlord, that the hand of death was pres- 
sing fast and heavy on his guest's eyelids, he tenderly asked the 
latter, if he had any directions to give respecting his funeral. 
" Give yourself no unnecessary concern regarding my funeral," 
was the dying man's caustic reply, " I will be there myself and 
will see about it." In a few hours thereafter, John's muse became 
silent for ever, and his bones found a resting-place in Cnochdan 
nan Gael, a small spot in the west side of the parish church-yard, 
set apart as a burying-place for strangers. 

Land-Owners. — The Right Honourable the Earl of Seafield 
is the sole proprietor of the parish, whose family seat is Castle 
-Grant, in the parish of Cromdale ; though the family burying- 
place has been in this parish at least since the year 1585. A 
splendid mausoleum was built last season for the family, from a de- 
sign by Mr Playfair of Edinburgh. 

Parochial Registers.— Frevious to the induction of the present 
ninister in 1820, the registers of baptisms and marriages were 
very irregularly kept. The earliest entry of baptisms and there 
is but one, is in 1779, and of marriages in 1796. Since 1820, 
all the records have been very regularly kept. 

Antiquities. — On a plain piece of barren moorland, near the 
Inn of Aviemore, there is a Druidical temple, which was till lately 
in a state of great preservation, when one of the small tenants in 
the neighbourhood, removed some of the stones to build a house 
for himself. 

AtDunmullie, there can be traced the vestiges of a moat fenced by 
a ditch, on which, according to tradition, there stood the residence 
of one of the ancient Lords of Glenchernich, previous to their re- 
moval to Kinchurdy, their last residence in this parish. 

In the face of the hill above DunmuUie, there is a large stone, 
in form not unlike a chair, and which is still called Bigla's Chair, 
as it is said that from this chair Bigla once proprietor of Glen- 
chernich, mounted her horse on her way to Duthil to hear mass.

Half-way between Diinniullie and Duthil, there is another stone, 
hollowed in the centre, where the same lady is reported to have 
deposited her keys, when going on the same religious errand. 

III. — Population. 

The population in 17.55 amounted to 1785, including Rothiemurchus, 

1792 830, exclusive of Do. 

1801 HI 3, Do. 

1821 1154, Do. 

1831 1309, Do. 

The yearly average of births for the last seven years is 30 
marriages, . Qf- 

Number of insane, 3; fatuous, 2; blind, 6; deaf and dumb, 2. 
Of the insane, one is blind, and another dumb, but not deaf. Of 
the fatuous, one is blind. 

Language, — Until of late years, the Gaelic might be said to 
be the only language spoken or understood ; but, by the settle- 
ment of a few strangers from the Lowlands among the people, 
the long possession which the language enjoyed has been disturbed. 
Those whose business brought them into immediate and frequent 
contact with those strangers, were from necessity obliged to at- 
tempt to speak a kind of imperfect English. Another circum- 
stance which contributed much to the advancement of the Eng- 
lish, is the introduction of the intellectual or explanatory system 
into the parochial schools. 

Among the popular customs prevalent here, may be noticed 
pennyweddings and funeral festivities, in both of which there is 
much to be lamented, deprecated, and amended. 

Smuggling has been so completely suppressed, that it may be 
said to be a tale of years long bygone. 

IV. — Industry. 

If the present state of husbandry be contrasted with that of 
thirty years ago, the change will appear to have been great. 
At the former period, farm-produce consisted of bear or big on 
dunged land ; rye ; black oats ; brocked oats ; and a few patches 
oi white oats. The quantity raised was but seldom equal to the 
consumption; but the deficiency was generally supplied by the 
humane proprietor, the late Sir James Grant of Grant, whose pa- 
ternal regard for his people was unremitting. At the period alluded 
to, there were scarcely any turnips sown, if we except a few ridges 
raised by the clergyman; and so unacquainted was he with the use of 
them, that he generally sold them to the poor in the neighbourhood, 
who used them as food. The present clergyman may be said to be 
the first who used compost of farm-yard dung, and moss earth, and 



134 



ELOINSHIllE. 



lime, and introduced a regular rotation of cropping. From the 
year 18'27 to 1834 inclusive, the crops were so abundant, that a 
very considerable quantity of grain was exported; and of such 
quality as to secure the highest market price. 

The system most generally practised is a five-shift course; \st, 
green crops, viz. potatoes and turnips ; 2d, barley, or oats laid down 
with clover and rye-grass seeds ; Sd, a crop of hay : 4th, pasture ; 
and last oats. The only objection to this system is, that the soil has 
not sufficient time to rest. Bone dust has been of late years used 
by some of the tenants, with all the success which generally re- 
sults from the use of that stimulant. In the aggregate, a consider- 
able quantity of waste ground has been brought into culture. The 
turf-built farm huts of former years are fast disappearing, and suc- 
ceeded by stone and lime cottages, whose white-washed walls, and 
straw-thatched roofs, afford a pleasing contrast with their dingy 
predecessors. 

The general duration of leases is nineteen years ; and so indul- 
gent is the proprietor, that no industrious tenant entertains any fear 
of being: removed at the termination of his lease. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Towns. — The nearest market-towns are those of Inver- 
ness, Nairn, and Forres, all which may be said to be equidistant 
twenty-six miles, from the centre of the parish. In the village 
of Grantown, distant about eight miles, there are feeing-markets 
for servants, held in the months of November and May ; also cat- 
tle-markets to suit the great southern markets. 

Means of Communication. — No Highland district is better ac- 
commodated with means of communication. The great Highland 
road between Perth and Inverness passes through the parish for fif- 
teen miles. In the hamlet at Carr Bridge, a post-office was esta- 
blished in July 1836. From Carr Bridge, a road branches off to 
Grantown, on which a mail-gig runs daily. This road is joined at 
Carr Bridge, near the confluence of the Spey and Dulnan, by an- 
other road that passes through the southern district of the parish. 
In the parish, there are two bridges over the Dulnan. The one 
at Sluggan, was built soon after 1745, on the line of road formed 
under the superintendence of General Wade. Since the desolat- 
ing flood of 1829, it is scarcely passable. The other is at the ham- 

" Since the above-mentioned year, the crops have been so much injured by early 
frosts and mildew, especially the crops of 1836 and 1837, that the little meal the 
grain yields is of a bad quality, and along the banks of the Dulnan, so great was the 
am a ge, that the tenants could not depend on any of their own growth for seed. 



DUTHIL.

let from which it derives its name, was built in 1791, and is in ex- 
cellent repair. 

Ecclesiastical State. — Part of this parish was detached to form 
the quoad sacra parish of Rothiemurchus. The church, an excel- 
lent edifice, built in 1826, is situated within two and a-half miles 
of the eastern extremity of the parish. It is seated for the accom- 
modation of between 800 and 900 persons ; the seats are all free. 
The manse was built in 1704; rebuilt in 1763. In 1804, it got 
a thorough repair, and an additional wing of two apartments, be- 
sides attics. Notwithstanding various patchings it received subse- 
quent to the last mentioned year, it was found necessary last sum- 
mer to take it down. The new manse is not yet finished ; but 
it bids fair to yield all necessary accommodation. The glebe 
does not exceed three acres, including manse, offices, and garden. 
The stipend is fifteen chalders, half meal, half barley, payable ac- 
cording to the fiars of the county, with L. 100 Scots for com- 
munion elements. 

There are properly speaking no Dissenters in the parish. About 
twenty families profess to be of the Established Church, but absent 
themselves from all places of worship. Their leader, a self-consti- 
tuted teacher, visits them periodically. One principal feature in his 
and their creed, is a deep-rooted and bitter enmity against the 
Establishment. The name of this sect has not as yet found a 
place in any nomenclature. The communicants may average about 
160.  

Education.— There are four schools in the parish,— Uff, the pa- 
rochial ; 2c, a school endowed by the Society for Propagatincr 
Christian Knowledge ; 3d, one partly so by the Education Society 
of Inverness ; and 4th, aschool of industry. The parochial school- 
master's salary is L. 25, 13s. 5d. In such years as the present, 
when the people are reduced to destitution by the failure of their 
crops, the school fees are merely nominal. The higher branches 
would be taught, but the poverty of the people preclude their as- 
piring beyond the ordinary branches of education for their chil- 
dren. The teacher has the legal accommodation of house and gar- 
den. So well is the parish supplied with schools, that all that are 
desirous, can have access to one or other of them. It is to be regret- 
ted that the people are by no means so alive to the benefits of edu- 
cation as might be wished. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The number of persons at pre 
sent upon the roll is 29. There are no funds for their re- 



136

lief, except what arise from the weekly collections, fines, &amp;c. and 
L, 1, 12s. being the interest of L. 40 produced by the sale of the 
wood of the old church, taken down in 1826. The funds are di- 
vided once a-year ; and the poor are divided into two classes. The 
average sum assigned to each individual, annually, for the last 
seven years was, to those on the first class, 5s. 3d., and to the se- 
cond 3s. 3d. ; and, small as the pittance assigned to each is, there 
is a strong disposition manifested to obtain it. 

Fairs.— There were several fairs held in the kirkyard of the 
parish at one period, but they have been, since the middle of the 
Jast century, partly discontinued and partly transferred to the vil- 
lage of Grantown, in the neighbouring parish of Inverallan. 

jnns. — There are two very respectable inns on the Highland 
road; one at Aviemore, and the other at the hamlet of Carr Bridge. 

Fuel— The common fuel is peats. They are abundant and easi- 
ly obtained.

I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name.lTS present, which is also its ancient name, is derived 
from the Gaelic, Rath a' mhdr-ghiutkais, signifying the plain of 
the great pines. Its name is suited to the appearance of the country, 
which is either covered with the debris of the ancient forest, or with 
a thrivino- young plantation of pine of natural growth. 

Extent and Boundaries— The parish is about seven miles in length, 
and ten miles in breadth, bounded on the north by the river Spey, 
separating it from Duthil and Alvie; on the east, by the united 
parishes of Abernethy and Kincardine ; on the south and south- 
east, by the united parishes of Crathie and Braemar in Aber- 
deenshire ; and on the west, by that portion of the parish of Alvie 
which lies upon the south side of the river Spey. 

Topographical Appearance, c— This district presents a great 
variety of surface, consisting of beautiful tracts of level ground well 
cultivated, knolly eminences, covered with birch, Scotch fir, larch, 



DUTHIL. HOTHIEMURCHUS. 137 



and different kinds of hard-wood ; while in the back-ground, and 
at the base of the lofty Cairngorum range, extends the large forest of 
pine, which renders this property so valuable. Near the west end 
of the parish is the Ord-ban, white hill, a hill standing solitary 
in advance of the great Grampian chain, beautifully wooded to 
near the summit, and presenting the rather uncommon appearance 
in the Highlands, of a mountain decorated with green verdure. 
There are excellent lime quarries. Along the base of this hill to 
the soutli, stretches Loch-an-Eilean, lake of the island, more 
than a mile in length, and varying from half-a-mile to a quarter of 
mile in breadth. Upon its banks grow the weeping-birch and 
some fine specimens of the tall sombre pine, remains of the old 
forest. This lake contains an island where are the ruins of a 
castle, of which tradition speaks as one of the strongholds of the Wolf 
of Badenoch, celebrated for his burning of the Elgin Cathedral. 
It is chiefly remarkable in the present day for a very distinct echo, 
whose reverberations among the surrounding mountains have a 
very fine effect. Southwards, about half-a-mile from Loch-an- 
Eilean, is Loch Gamhuinn, encircled by the tall dark pine, in 
harmony with the wild Alpine scenery around. Along the margin 
of this lake, runs Rathad-na-meirlich thieves' road the common 
pass of the Lochaber reivers in their excursions to Morayland ; and 
it IS probable that this was the scene of some striking event in their 
history, as the name of the lake Loch of the Steers has an affi- 
nity to their desperate and unlawful calling. Overhanging these 
two lakes on the south, is the branch mountain of Lich Riach, 
which, with the Brae Riach, still further south, and belonging to 
the great chain, forms Glen-Ennich, a good pasturage for sheep. 
In this glen, which is of considerable extent, are several lakes, the 
chief of which is Loch-Ennich, surrounded upon all sides but one, 
by precipices of striking grandeur and majestic height. 

The Brae Riach, above alluded to, is upwards of 4000 feet 
above the level of the sea, of a table shape, with numerous cor- 
ries, affording shelter for the red deer and ptarmigan ; abounding 
with precipices dangerous to the hunter ; and the resort of gem- 
collectors in search of the Cairngorum quartz. Near the summit 
of this part of the Grampian range, about a mile distant from the 
boundary of the parish, is the source of the river Dee in Aberdeen- 
shire, called by the country people the Wells of Dee. These wells 
are about a dozen in number, which unite their streams, and pass. 



138 



ELGINSHIRE. 



in the course of a few miles, through scenery of surpassing subli- 
mity and grandeur. 

To the east of Glen -Ennich, and about the centre of the pa- 
rish, there is a bold pass through the mountains, named in the lan- 
guage of the country, Larich-ruadh, or red pass. Through this 
narrow guUey, a foot-path has been formed with much trouble by 
the removal of immense blocks of granite, which have fallen from 
the adjoining precipices on either side of the pass, with the view of 
communicating with the southern markets by a shorter route than 
the great Highland road presents. 

The task of bringing cattle through this pass is one of difficulty 
and danger ; but a pedestrian, fond of the grand in nature, will have 
his toils amply repaid, while he wends his way along the base of 
the lofty Ben-Mac-dui. The shoulder of this mountain forms in 
this direction the boundary of the parish. 

Soil — Along the banks of the Spey, the soil is a rich alluvial 
deposit, producing heavy crops, but subject in rainy seasons to in- 
undations of the river. The higher grounds are more secure but 
less fertile. 

Hydrography. — Lakes and streams abound. Loch-an-Eilean 
and Loch-Gamhuinn to the west, Loch-Ennich to the south, 
and Loch-Morlich to the east, with many others of inferior note, 
are made serviceable, with the aid of numberless streams de- 
scending from the mountains, for the purpose of floating timber to 
the Spey, whence it is conveyed to Garmouth or the Moray Frith. 
The whole surface of the parish is indented with lakes, which, 
while they add to the beauty of the country, greatly enhance the 
value of the forest, by affording a cheap mode of conveyance. The 
Benie, Luinac, Altruadh, and Druie, are the names by which the 
principal streams are designated. 

Fishes and Game. — Salmon, trout, eels, and pike, are found in 
abundance in the Spey ; and pike, eels, and trout of a very fine 
quality are produced by the lakes. In Loch-Ennich, char are 
found. The forest, half a century ago, was the resort of herds of 
red-deer and roe. Few of these are now met with, the sheep hav- 
\no occupied their place. Black game, pheasants, partridges, 
ha'res, rabbits, and especially ptarmigan abound. 

Birds and Beasts of Prey.-— The black eagle, the denizen of 
the mountains, occasionally visits the shepherd's flock, and the 
cunning fox still rears her cubs in the inaccessible wilds of Brae 
Riach. The osprey builds her nest and nurtures her young on

the top of one of the turrets of Loch-an-Eilean Castie, and supplies 
herself with food from the neighbouring lakes and streams, while 
the cormorant, on the glassy surface of the lake, swims slowly along, 
watchful to pounce on the finny tribe beneath. 

Forests.— The greater part of the parish is covered with forest, 
calculated to extend over a surface of sixteen miles. It is now 
about forty years since the proprietor procured an act of Parlia- 
ment to enable him to manufacture timber to an unlimited extent. 
During many years of that period, particularly during the late war, 
he derived an annual income varying from L.10,000 to L.20,000. 
The result is, that only a few remnants of the ancient forest now ap- 
pear, though these cannot fail to impress the mind of the beholder 
with a vivid picture of its former glory. Not only the pine, but also 
the birch, grows luxuriantly in the parish. The alder appears in 
great vigour by the banks of the various rivulets, and on the lower 
grounds different kinds of hard-wood, as oak, lime, beech, and 
ash of goodly dimensions, adorn the policies of the demesne. 
Plantations of larch have been successfully tried in various parts 
of the property, which promise a rich return, and prove the soil 
to be well adapted for the growth of this ornamental and useful 
tree. For the purpose of manufacturing a portion of the timber 
into deals and staves, &amp;c. both for foreign and domestic use, a 
handsome wooden building was erected several years ago, con- 
taining machinery capable of setting in motion ten circular saws, 
and an upright frame of eight plain saws. When in full operation,' 
it required a force of from ten to fifteen men to work these, and 
a boy to increase or diminish the volume of water deemed neces- 
sary for the operations. When manufactured, the wood was floated 
down the Spey in large rafts, conducted by two men, to the village 
of Garmouth, where a manager always resided to preside over the 



sales. 



II. — Civil History. 
History speaks not with certainty regarding the original pro- 
prietors of this district of country, but tradition and probability 
pomt to the Gumming race as lords of Badenoch, Rothiemurchus, 
and Strathspey. When that name lorded it over the neighbour- 
ing lands, it is not probable that Rothiemurchus, centrically si- 
tuated as it is, would have escaped this yoke. After the times 
of Robert the Bruce, their power was broken, and their influence 
and possession passed into other hands. The Shaws succeeded 
the Cummmgs in the possession of this property. A feud ex

isted between the two races, carried on with various success, 
until finally the Shaws triumphed by stratagem. Tradition 
speaks of the bloody catastrophe. The leading men of the Cum- 
mings were upon an excursion to the low country, and the Shaws, 
apprized of this circumstance, resolved to waylay them upon their 
return and effect their ruin. The latter placed a sentinerupon 
the summit of the Calart hill, at the eastern boundary of the pa- 
rish, with instructions to give a preconcerted signal as to the route 
of the Cummings, north or south of that hill. Their plan thus 
matured was followed up, and the hour at length arrived when 
the hostile parties met. A desperate encounter took place, and 
the Shaws prevailed. Not one of the foe escaped, and thus the 
sword effected what the law dared not accomplish. At the base 
of the Calart, there is a hollow still known by the name of Lag- 
na-Cuimminich, indicative of the spot where the tragedy was 
acted. A day of retributive justice at length overtook the race of 
Shaw for this deed of blood. The last of that name who held 
the property, actuated by a spirit of malignant envy, murdered his 
step-father, the Dallas, an act which so irritated the mother of 
the youth, that, collecting the deeds and instruments by which 
her son could hope to hold the property, she escaped to Castle 
Grant, and surrendered to John Grant of Freuchy the whole 
rights and interests of the young Shaw. The Laird of Grant 
having thus acquired these lands, gifted them to his second son, 
Patrick, who, towards the close of the sixteenth century, took pos- 
session, and since that period till the present day, his descendants 
liave been in the quiet and secure enjoyment of this inheritance. 
Connected with the history of the parish is the slaughter of one 
of the Earls of Athole, who, fleeing before his enemies, was sur- 
prized and murdered, when taking shelter behind a large stone 
near the summit of Inch Riach, called to this day, in allusion to 
this event, Clach-Mhic- Allan, the Earl of Athole's Stone. 

Eminent Characters. — We are not aware of any names of 
celebrity, either in the arts or sciences, connected with the pa- 
rish. Tradition hands down the names of several individuals 
eminent in their day for deeds of active strife. Macalpine and 
Tighearna Bane, lairds of Rothiemurchus, are names endear- 
ed to the inhabitants, more by the record of their services in the 
cause of benevolence, than by any remarkable traits of character 
or talents peculiar to themselves. John Roy Stewart one of 
Pri nee Charlie's Colonels, and a native of Kincardine, in this vici-

nlty, fled from the field of Culloden and concealed himself for many 
years in the forests of Glenmora and Rothiemurchus, whence 
at length he effected his escape to France, where he died. Some 
of his descendants yet live in this parish, and retain the affection- 
ate remembrance of acts of kindness shown them by their relative 
while an exile and in the service of the King of France. 

Land-owners. — Siv J, P. Grant, Knight, Puisne Judge at Cal- 
cutta, is the sole proprietor of the parish ; a gentleman of acknow- 
ledged talent, and eminent for his services in the cause of civil 
liberty. When acting in the capacity of judge at Bombay, he 
supported the dignity of the Bench by asserting, in opposition to 
the then governor, Sir John Malcolm, the rights of the native po- 
pulation as British citizens, to the privileges conferred by law. 
As he could not conform to the despotic views of the reigning go- 
vernment, he resigned his office, but was a few years thereafter re- 
. stored to the Bench, where he now sits, by a succeeding govern- 
ment. 

Parochial Registers. — The earliest entries for both baptisms 
and marriages are in the year 1774. The registers have been 
always kept distinct from those of Duthil, but have not been re- 
gularly kept till within the last dozen years. 

J niiquitics.— The Castle of Lochan-Eilean is the only anti- 
quity in the parish. It stands upon an island evidently artificially 
formed in a part of the lake of great depth. The remains of a 
path-way from the mainland are easily traced. The records of the 
family now in possession of the property, speak of it as a ruin two 
centuries ago; and the date of its erection ; indeed, the purposes 
for which it was originally built, are hid in obscurity, anti- 
quarians disputing whether it was intended as a strono-hold or 
a religious house. Tradition refers it to the era of th"e Cum- 
mings, as one of their houses of retreat, during the early feudal 
broils. 

Modern Building s.—The mansion-house at the Doune, the re- 
sidence of the proprietor, is the only building of note in the parish. 
It IS a modern building without architectural pretensions, pleasant- 
ly situated on the banks of the river Spey, surrounded by shrubberies 
ot great taste, and the policies around beautifully wooded. No situa- 
tion on the banks of the Spey possesses greater attractions. The 
garden, placed at a short distance from the mansion, in a deep dell 
among rich plantations, has had its natural features much improv- 
ed through the taste of the late Duke of Bedford and his amiable

Duchess, who chose this as their favourite summer residence. lis 
inequalities of surface, so unusual in modern gardens, its natural 
and artificial beauties, and the picturesque character of the vicini- 
ty, have attracted many delighted visitors. 

III. — Population. 

The population has been gradually decreasing for the last ten 
years. In 1831, it amounted to upwards of 600 souls, while the 
last census, in 1841, gives the number of 521. To account for 
this decrease, the fact presents itself, that a surplus population 
was introduced into the parish by the influx of strangers, for the 
purpose of assisting in the manufacture of wood, which being now 
at a close, compels many to seek for other localities where labour 
is more in demand. 

Language and Customs. — The foregoing circumstance, the in- 
flux of strangers, also explains the more general prevalence of the 
English language in this district, than in the neighbouring parishes. 
The Gaelic still retains its hold among the aged, but the young 
manifest great anxiety to acquire the knowledge of the more useful 
English. 

Not only has smuggling ceased, but penny-bridals and extrava- 
gant festivity at funerals have, it is to be hoped, been for ever abo- 
lished. The games wont to be practised here and throughout 
the Highlands are forgotten ; and instead, the young men betake 
themselves on holidays to the practice of shooting at a target. 

IV. — Industry. 

Those who devote themselves to husbandry are not behind their 
neighbours in the march of progressive improvement, and they 
enjoy great advantages from the lime-quarries in the parish, and 
the facility with which, through the landlord's kindness, they can 
procure fuel to burn the limestone. A sufficient quantity of pro- 
duce, such as oats, bear, potatoes, and turnips, is raised for home 
consumption. This was not the case at a late period. It is a 
fact, that a farmer not long since deceased, grew turnips upon 
trial, but felt greatly disappointed at the result, alleging that they 
enabled his cattle to consume too much fodder — so that the prac- 
tice was at that time abandoned. Experience has taught the pre- 
sent generation a different lesson. 

The labouring portion of the population have acquired much of 
the improvident character peculiar to manufacturing districts, live 
generally in extremes, either in extravagant abundance or desti- 
tution. Necessity, the mother of invention, is gradually accom-

plishiiig the overthrow of habits of wasteful expenditure ; and fru- 
gaUty is likely, ere long, to be acknowledged as a virtue. 
V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Towns. — There are none in the parish, the nearest be- 
ing Inverness, at the distance of thirty-three miles. The villages 
of Grantown, distant sixteen miles, Kingussie, twelve miles, and 
Castletown of Braemar, thirty miles, are the resort of the f&amp;r- 
mers for the sale of their cattle. 

Means of Communication.— AXong the southern bank of the 
Spey runs a line of county road, stretching from Craigellachie 
bridge, near Rothes, to the Bridge of Spey, near Kingussie, and 
passing through this parish. Communication is kept up with the 
great Highland road by means of a ferry-boat across the Spey at 
Inverdruie, distant from the hne about half a mile, and by several 
private boats. The sub post-office, at Lynwilg, on the north bank 
of the Spey, distant two miles, is the receiving-office of the dis- 
trict. The royal mail conveys letter bags to this office from Perth, 
Inverness, Carr Bridge, and Kingussie. 

Ecclesiastical State.— Thk was at one period a distinct parish 
from Duthil. It was disunited and formed into a quoad sacra pa- 
rish, by Act of Parliament V. Geo. IV. cap. 90, in the year 
1824. The present church, situated to the west of the mansion- 
house of the Doune, and surrounded by a belt of planting and an 
efficient dike, was rebuilt by Sir J. P. Grant, at an expense of 
L.395. The manse, situated at the base of the Ord-bane, half 
a-mile distant from the church, was completed by the commission- 
ers under the above act in the year 1830, at an expense of near- 
ly L 750; and the present incumbent was inducted in September 
of that year. The church is in a state of good repair; but the 
manse havmg been very carelessly constructed, notwithstandina 
the scandalously enormous expense incurred by Government in its 
erection, requires attention and an occasional outlay of money by 
the minister, ,n order to keep it in a proper condition. The ffar 
den wall is a hideous object, and built in so slovenly a manner, that 
portions of it are continually toppling to the ground. The glebe 
inclusive of the garden and site of the manse, contains four acres' 
one rood, and two falls. The stipend amounts to L. 120 per an' 
num, without any allowance for communion elements 

There are no Dissenters in the parish, with the exception of one 
Roman Catholic, and one family of the Baptist communion. The 
nuniber of communicants is about 60.

Educaiio7i.— There is but one school in the parish, centrically 
situated. The salary attached to the office, and paid by the pro- 
prietor, is L. 10 per annum. Advantage has not hitherto been 
taken of the late Highland School Act. The attendance at school 
averages from 50 to 70; and were it not for the poverty of 
the people, and the smallness of the salary, which prevents the 
teacher from bestowing gratuitous education upon any, nearly 
double this number would avail themselves of the opportunity of 
receiving instruction, so much desiderated by the whole body of 
the people. None of the charitable educational societies of 
Scotland has yet stepped forward with a helping hand to aid in 
this benevolent object. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The funds for the relief of the poor 
are derived from collections in church, donations, and the interest 
on a small fund lodged in the bank. Through the liberality of the 
late Duke of Bedford, the present Dowager Duchess of Bed- 
ford, and the kind interest taken in the welfare of the poor, by 
Mrs J. G. Craig, Edinburgh, daughter to Sir J. P. Grant, the 
annual funds have averaged between L. 50 and L. 70 per annum, 
for the last ten years, which has placed the poor in a state of com- 
parative comfort. 

Fuel, Sc. — The common fuel is peats and wood, of which there 
is great abundance in the parish. 

No fairs are held in this parish, and the only public-house is 
one at the boat-house of Inverdruie.

Boundaries, 4c.— This parish, as its ancienfname imports, is a 
peninsula; bounded on the north, by the Moray Frith; on the soutl,, 
by the lake of Spynie; on the east, by the river Lossie; and on the 
west, by the parish of Duffus. It is in form a parallelogram ; m 
leno-th about four, and in breadth about two miles. It is low or 
flat and, excepting on its northern boundary, approaches nearly to 
a level. Its southern boundary, stretching along lake Spynie, 
throuo-h the canal of which the tide now flows, is cold and swampy. 

The low drained fields consist of rich loam or marly clay, and 
bear heavy crops of every kind of grain; the lighter grounds rest 
upon a substratum of gravel, or upon pure while sand. The qua- 
lity of the ground is various, and the transition from the very 
best to the worst so sudden, that scarcely twenty acres alike are to 
be found. About a square mile in the centre is of the very worst 
description. It never was good,— commons seldom are so ; but 
what was naturally bad, was made worse, by peeling and paring off 
the surface for fuel, as often as its stinted heath would hold the turt 
too-ether and enable it to burn. To hide the nakedness of the 
land, part of it has been planted with firs or pine, but why in plant- 
ing it they did not study beauty or utility I know not ; it would 
puzzle any one to account for its zig-zag direction. This oddity in 
the way of ornamental plantation, and another patch or two of hrs 
in the south-east corner of the parish, are our only plantations. 
Neither oak, ash, elm, birch, nor any of the deciduous tribes have 
been attempted, though more likely to succeed on alow maritime 
coast than pine, which only comes to perfection on more e evated 
grounds, and at a greater distance from the sea. Fossil oaks have 
frequently been found, and of great dimensions ; and Oaken-head, 
the name of a farm adjoining these plantations, would indicate 
that oak, natural or planted, once flourished there. 

The sea, at some distant period, it is manifestly seen, cover- 
ed all the low lands of Drainie. As it retired it left behind a 
beach or strand of polished water-worn stones, now from eight 
to twenty feet higher than the surface of the present arable fields ; 
and this high beach not only guards as it were the opening on the 
north between the Causea and Goulard hills, but extends on the 
east from Lossiemouth to the lake of Spynie. The mass of water- 
worn stones, hurled together between Canal bridge and Kay's 
bridge, is perhaps the greatest of its kind in Britain. 

Coast— On the east, fronting Spey's Bay, the coast is flat and 
low; the sea at ebb in high tides recedes a mile from the river 



DIIAINIE. 



147 



Lossie, and touches or closes with it at high-water. The greatest 
depth of water on the Bar at spring-tides is ten feet, in ordinary 
tides sometimes less than eight. The unfortunate mariner that 
is overtaken by the storm, and who, in hopes of saving his life, 
runs his ship ashore, or is driven on it by the tempest at low wa- 
ter, must inevitably perish. From the violence of the surf which 
lashes this shallow coast in every northern storm, no ship can 
live, nor boat give aid or assistance. The decks are swept of 
every living soul, and the vessel itself, if it holds together, digs 
its own grave in the shifting sand, and in a few days disap- 
pears from human view. Such has been the fate of too many. 
Scarcely a year passes that does not tell the mournful tale. I 
cannot assign the cause, why more ships have been lost in Spey's 
Bay since the erection of the light-house on the opposite coast 
at Tarbet point, than ever were lost in the same number of 
years, previous to its erection. On the northern side of this pa- 
rish, the coast is bold and rocky. A reef or chain of hidden rock, 
a mile distant from the shore, runs parallel to the Coulard and 
Causea Hills. In calm weather, this reef is visible from the neigh- 
bouring height, and its course may be traced by the black curl of 
the water over its surface, and in tempestuous weather by the tre- 
mendous billows that dash and break upon it. That part of the 
reef called the Great Skerry, is at all times visible. Providence 
has in mercy lifted the head of this reef above the waters, as if to 
warn mariners of the hidden rocks that flank it right and left. On 
this fatal reef, more than forty vessels are known to have been 
wrecked within these fifty years past, and many no doubt have 
shared the same disastrous fate, that never have been known or 
heard of. That the light-house at Tarbet point on the opposite 
coast is of some use, as it guards the mariner against mistaking 
the Dornoch Ferry for Cromarty Bay, is admitted, but not one ves- 
sel ever was or will be lost in the Dornoch Frith for ten that 
has been and in all probability will be, lost on and near the 
Skerries. There is a talk of erecting a light-house on the 
Moray side of the Frith.

Minerals, Backs, and Caverns.— In the Coulard Hill, between 
Lossiemouth and Stotfield, there are appearances of lead, said 
to be of the very best quality. It is found in detached mas- 
ses imbedded in the rocks, which are of fluor spar. Dr Lewis 
Gordon, in the last Statistical Account of this parish, informs 
us, that some adventurers from England expended m his time 
more than L. 500, but could discover no vein of ore worth 
working; but had it been worth working, the ignorant dissipated 
fellow employed to make the trial, was capable of spending a much 
greater sum to no purpose. Very near this, there is a vein of lime- 
stone, and a powerful spring of fresh water, issuing forth at low 
ebb tides near the old Stotfield harbour. The whole range of rock 
along the Causea shore is one uninterrupted mass of freestone, lying 
on horizontal strata differing in thickness, hardness, and colour. 
The ornamental hewn work of all the great mansions in this and the 
neighbouring counties, has been taken from the Causea quarries, 
and Thames Street in London was at one time paved with stones 
from Lossiemouth. 

Gerardine's cave, in Elgin charters denominated Holy- Man- 
head, probably the abode of a hermit, was about twelve feet square. 
It was ornamented with a Gothic door and window, and com- 
manded a long but solitary prospect of the eastern coast. Its 
Gothic door and window were demolished about sixty years ago 
by a drunken sailor, and the whole cave has since been scoop, 
ed out by quarriers. 

The Causea caverns, caves, and fissures are so numerous, as to 
bid defiance to the wanton spoiler. There, the violence of winds and 
waves has cut the softer parts of the rock into many fantastic forms 
resembhng caves, arches, and pillars. Those immediately west of 
the village of Causea, are truly beautiful. The descent to them 
IS by a safe and gently sloping road, to a beautiful verdant lawn 
bounded on three of its sides by perpendicular rocks from 60 to 
100 feet high, as smooth and regular as the walls of a garrison. 
The entrance to this lawn, through a natural arch, its stately pillars 
and lofty alcoves, repay the trouble of visiting them. No sooner 
does the stranger enter, than the gulls, daws, and pigeons, which 
nestle on the ledges of these rocks, and are usually annoyed by the 
little urchins who frequent them, take wing. Of this wonderful 
scenery, the Gull's or Gow's Castle, as itis called, isto the vounthe 
most attractive. It stands, a monument of former times, isolatednd 
detached from the rocks of which it once formed a part, and tells us 



130 



ELGINSHIIIE. 



of the destructive power of those warring elements which if. has so 
long withstood; but its fall, though distant, is approaching; the slow 
consuming influence of wind and tide has not only narrowed but per- 
forated its base, and its heavy, flat, projecting top threatens, by its 
weight, to accelerate its ruin. On the western side of the lawn is 
a cave, once the cell of a hermit, but degraded to a stable by Sir 
Robert Gordon, who concealed his horses in it in the Rebellion 
of 1715. On this verdant vale, parties sit down to pick-nick din- 
ners, where all the rarities of the season are gathered together. 
Everything around them contributes to their pleasure, the novelty 
of the scene, the different plants of variegated colours, creeping or 
hanging in festoons from the rocks, the noise and flight of fright- 
ened gulls, daws, and pigeons, the hoarse murmur of the sea, and 
the melody of song, cheer and gladden every heart. Farther west 
the rocks are more lofty and rugged, the caverns numerous, and 
all looking to the sea ; some of them are yet unexplored, and it 
would be difficult and dangerous to explore them. To visit 
these, gentlemen and ladies, pleased with the scenery, and more 
pleased with each other, scramble hand in hand over slippery 
rocks, and rounded boulders, at the risk of breaking their necks 
and limbs. 

II. — Civil History. 
Of the history of Moray, little is known prior to the reicrn 
of Malcolm II. and that Iktle only records incessant insur- 
rections and rebellions. Of Danish or Norwegian origin, the 
Picts of Moray hated and resisted the Celtic dynasty. In the 
southern provinces, the Picts, subdued by force, or bribed by 
favour, were sooner reconciled than the northern, who were at 
a greater distance, and feared them less. The murders of Mal- 
colm, Duff, and Duncan, attest that they never scrupled as to the 
means of attaining their end. Unable of themselves to regain the 
throne, or preserve their independence, they called in the aid, as 
they had often formerly done, of their brethren the Danes. This 
called down the vengeance of Malcolm II. III. and IV. The 
punishment, though deserved, was severe. To weaken the power 
of the turbulent barons, some were killed, others banished to the 
south, and their estates confiscated. The bishopric of Moray, 
the fourth in order, was then erected, and the strong fortresses of 
Kinnedder, Spynie, and Plewland, since called Gordonston, were 
put into the peaceable but unwarlike hands of bishops, of whom 
Gregory, who held them anno 1 120, was first Bishop of Moray. 



DRAINIE. 



151 



By the policy of Malcolm, the address of Gregory, the superstition 
of Queen Margaret, and cunning of her confessor, Turgot, the 
Murriffs were deprived of their real estates. The bishops, into 
whose hands the real estates came, might well be satisfied. It 
laid the foundation of their future power and more ample revenue. 
The lands of -Kinnedder were held by these church dignitaries, 
from the time of Queen Margaret, in uninterrupted succession, till 
the time of Patrick Hepburn, uncle to Earl Bothwell, who alien- 
ated them to the Earl of Moray, bastard brother to Queen Mary; 
his heirs assigned them to Brodie of Brodie, and Brodie's to Mr 
Brander, whose heir enjoys them. Gordonston, about the same 
unhappy period, fell to the Marquis of Huntly, as his portion of 
church plunder. 

Antiquities. — Adjoining to the churchyard, in the centre of 
which the foundation of the ancient church of Kinnedder may 
still be traced, stood the once stronghold of Kinnedder, called 
the Castle, and now, by way of dignifying it, called the Bishop's 
palace. Archibald, tenth Bishop of Moray, is the only bishop of 
whom it is recorded that he made the Castle of Kinnedder his 
place of constant residence. Before the cathedral was fixed at 
Spynie, the bishops lived sometimes at Birnie, sometimes at 
Spynie, and sometimes at Kinnedder. They got the credit, to 
which they were not entitled, of building these strongholds. They 
might have repaired them ; but they were built by the Celtic or 
Pictish barons, who lived many centuries before a bishop was 
heard of. The great tower of Kinnedder was defended bv two 
walls, about fifty paces from each other, each wall having its ditch 
in front, and, what was more uncommon, an earthen rampart, from 
eight to ten feet wide, and as many feet high, behind each wall. 
The space enclosed comprehended about two acres, the form ap- 
proaching to a hexagon; the outer wall was defended at each 
angle by a small tower. These small lowers were square, solid, 
and projecting six feet beyond the wall. They were distant from 
each other about two casts of a javelin, and the ascent to them 
was from the rampart by a strong but rough stone stair. The 
storehouses and barracks stood directly east of the great tower ; 
they were vaulted and grated ; the walls four feet thick at bottom ; 
and the tradition is that they were fire-proof. What remain- 
ed of the doors and windows, and the hewn stones found amono- 
the rubbish, shows that the work was of the Gothic order, and 
highly ornamented in its day. This part of the fortress, havini 



152 



ELGINSHUIE. 



the outer wall six feet thick, from which there was a sally-port 
formed the hypotheneuse of an obtuse- angled triangle, the two 
sides of which were sixty feet each in length. The great tower, 
which stood in the centre, after being deserted by the bishops, and 
taken possession of by owls, bats, and daws, was, from its great 
height, appropriated as a belfry to the ancient adjoining church 
of Kinnedder. The fortifications on the east were guarded by a 
morass, and two ditches, one of twenty-four, and a little beyond it, 
another of twelve feet wide, the drawbridge of which was lately 
discovered in making a drain. The horn-work, a hollow tower to 
defend these ditches, was converted by the bishops to a pigeon- 
house. The wall on this east side seems to have been about six- 
teen feet high ; parts of it and of the small towers yet remain, and 
very lately, part of the earthen rampart. On the north, west, and 
south sides, which were probably more strongly fortified, the whole 
is now completely effaced. The Rev. Lachlan Shaw, the his- 
torian of Moray, who saw them in 1734, tells us that, in his 
time, the foundations of the castle and surrounding fortifications 
were so entire, as to be easily traced ; but since then, these walls 
have been levelled with the ground ; the earthen ramparts have 
been thrown into the ditches which fronted them, the plough- 
share has passed over it, and the place that knew this strong- 
hold of the MurrifFs knows it no more. The labourers who filled 
up the ditches were astonished at the quantity of ashes and oak 
charcoal, and number of broken urns and human bones they met 
with, in levelling these earthen ramparts, more especially under 
their foundations. The reports of witnesses yet living induced 
the present incumbent to examine more minutely what yet remain- 
ed of the earthen rampart, and which was about to be removed. 
Under the foundations he found the graves closely packed. On 
removing the earth, there appeared first peat or turf ashes, then 
within the rude stone chest, oak-charcoal, and some fragments of 
human bones. The stone chests were scorched,' and blackened 
with the fire by which the bodies had been burnt. When the 
stone chests were of hammer-dressed flags, the ashes were as 
smooth as if they had passed through a sieve, and were packed in 
it, and the charcoal laid on the cover, but not a vestige of bone 
among the ashes. All that could be found among the oak charcoal 
was sometimes a tooth, and sometimes small remains of the harder 
bones. Where the graves were of rude construction, consisting 
of common undressed stones, the peat or turf ashes were more 

3 



DftAlNIE. 



153 



abundant, the oak charcoal was scanty, and the larger and harder 
bones, particularly the vertebrae, not half consumed. 

I know not what our Pictish ancestors may have done, but it is 
certain the Celts did burn, and burn with oak. The Druids con- 
sidered oak as the symbol of Deity ; their altars were strewed with 
its leaves and encircled with its branches, and chaplets of oak 
were worn by the priests and by the people on all their religious 
ceremonies, none of which were more solemn than the funeral 
rites paid to the dead. That the Celts were expelled from Kin- 
nedder and all the lowlands of Moray by the Picts, is admitted ; 
and I think it must also be admitted, that the Celts built the for- 
tress of Kinnedder, from which, after much slaughter, they were 
driven by the Picts, and the Picts in their turn expelled by Mal- 
colm II. or III., and Kinnedder granted as a fief to the Bishops 
of Moray. The numerous graves running parallel to the wall, and 
covered by the high earthen rampart, which, till lately, never ap- 
pear to have been disturbed, prove the ancient castle and fortifi- 
cation to have been the work of the Celts, or of the Picts, if they 
also burned their dead ; but clearly disprove the claim of any Bi- 
shop of Moray having built either the Great Tower, or surround- 
ing fortifications. Some, however, from the numerous fragments 
of urns found in Kinnedder, suppose the fortification to have been 
Roman, and an outpost of Burghead Ptoroton. 

" Warlike Hills:'— Hhe&amp;e are a range of artificial, conical earthen 
mounds, at nearly equal distances, and from twenty to thirty feet 
high, erected on the summits of the Causea hills, which stretch 
their perpendicular rocks on the north, along the Moray Frith, and 
raise their heads on the south, above the long extended plains of 
Moray. Their name denotes the end for which they were con- 
structed. Commanding a distant prospect both by sea and land, 
they were used as telegraphic signal-posts. When the Celts pos- 
sessed the land, they announced by lighted fires a hostile invasion 
by northern Celts or Danes. When the Pictish or Norwegian 
race possessed the land, they answered the same purpose, by sum- 
monmg their armed warlike vassals to the field, or served to direct, 
through the Moray Frith, the course of the fleets of their brethren 
the Danes, who might come to their aid, or extend their conquests. 

Eminent Characters.— Mtev the establishment of Episcopacy in 
Moray, the bishops were the only proprietors of Kinnedder and 
Ugston, from the time of Malcolm II. down to that of the unfor- 
tunate Mary. But excepting the ruins of the old church of Kin- 



154 



ELGINSHIRE. 



nedder and its ancient cross, which yet stands, there is not a stone, 
obelisk, or remains of any ecclesiastical or public work, to tell of 
their existence. 

Sir Robert Gordon, first of Gordonston, claims a niche among 
the historians of the north. He is author of the History of 
the Family and Earldom of Sutherland. He was second son 
of the Earl of Sutherland. He was great-grandfather to Sir 
Robert Gordon, who claimed the honour and titles of Suther- 
land, in opposition to the female claimant, the present Du- 
chess. Little did he imagine, while composing his ingenious 
and elaborate history of their pedigree, that he was undermining 
the claim of his own great-grandson. To counterbalance the 
weighty authority of this history, Sir William Gordon, son of the 
claimant, wrote the history of Joannes Ferrarius, whose annals of 
Scotland were more favourable to his father's pretensions, and en- 
deavoured to raise that obscure monk of the Abbey of Kinloss to 
the dignity of an historian superior to Sir Robert Gordon, his own 
ancestor, the historian of Sutherland ; but Sir William's history 
of Ferrarius, as a partial pleading, has sunk into obscurity. 

Of all the family of Gordonston, Robert, son of Lodvic, com- 
monly known as Sir Robert the warlock, has been longest re- 
memiaered. Educated at home in all the liberal sciences then 
known, he travelled on the continent, and made himself master of 
many secrets in natural history unknown to his illiterate country- 
men, whom he took pleasure in frightening and astonishing. It was 
believed he was educated in Italy in the Schod of the Black Art. 
Many stories are told of his proficiency therein, which space does 

not allow us to recite here. 

III. — Population. 
A rent-roll at Gordonston, taken about the year 1666, shows 
that from forty to fifty families lived on what would now be con- 
sidered but a small farm. The return to Dr Webster gave 1174. 
The population in 1791 amounted to 1040; in the year 1B21 to 
1060; and in 1831 to 1296, whereof there were on

In the villages of Lossiemouth and Stotfield, there reside 17 
masons, 7 shoemakers, 5 house-carpenters, 6 tailors, 3 coopers, 
3 blacksmiths, 4 bakers, 3 waggoners, 1 boat-carpenter, 2 but- 
chers, 4 grocers, 7 British spirit-retailers, and 1 foreign spirit-re- 
tailer. 

IV. — Industry. 
About the year IBOO, the mania for augmenting farms spread 
from south to north, and in 1809 the furms in this parish were re- 
duced from the number of 68 to 38. Only three or four tenants 
in the whole parish of Drainie now remain on the farms occupied 
by their fathers at the date of the old Statistical Acount. Little 
discernment was manifested in the choice of their successors. The 
highest bidders, men without capital, and many of them without 
skill or capital, were preferred. These were perfectly satisfied with 
the terms and duration of the lease, and well they might, for be- 
fore the expiration of it, four-fifths of them were bankrupts and 
rouped out. The war-prices of grain and cattle tumbling down 
at the peace of Amiens, no doubt accelerated their ruin ; but their 
own folly and extravagance had just as powerful an effect. The 
old butts and bens, with kitchen and spens, were abolished, and 
mansions with dining-rooms, drawing-rooms, and parlours, which 
they could not furnish, or afford to furnish, were erected in their 
stead. The principal proprietor was then a minor, and but heir 
to an entailed estate. When became to majority, he found him- 
self loaded with a vast expense for these buildings, and the abortive 
attempt of draining the lake of Spynie. 

Agriculture has made advances, though slowly, towards im- 
provement. At the date of the last Statistical Account, turnips 
and artificial grasses were cultivated on a very narrow scale. White 
corn crops succeeded each other till the field became exhausted, 
which was then allowed to rest by running into grass, the natural 
product of the field. The common rotation at present is, Is, fal- 
low or green crop ; 2d, corn ; 3cl and 4th, grass ; Fth and 6th, corn. 
Too frequently beans or pease are substituted for green crop or 
fallow, not from ignorance but from necessity, as the poor farmer 
has not capital to wait a distant though more ample return. Only 
one farmer, Mr John Stephen of Goulard Bank, adopts the rule of 
never sowing two white corn crops in succession. Sea-weed is, at 
times, got in abundance and with little trouble, though in general 
not without much labour. 

There are no complete stone enclosures in the parish. When 



156 ELGINSHIHE. 

a field is enclosed, it is done with wood, purchased at a high price, 
obtained as a favour, and drawn from a great distance. As little 
encouragement is given to draining, little in that way is done. 

The number of arable acres in the parish may be about 8000, 
the gross rental L. 4500 ; farms 38, ploughs 70. Two of the 
f;irms exceed 200 acres, five exceed 100 acres, and twelve exceed 
80 acres. 

Fisheries. — In the villages of Stotfield and Lossiemouth, there 
are forty-six families of fishermen, consisting of seventy men and 
twenty-five boys. These put to sea forty-five fishing-boats, nine- 
teen of which are for herring, and twenty-six for white-fish. These 
twenty-six are of two sizes ; the larger size is used during the 
winter and spring months, and the smaller during the summer. 
They belong to thirteen crews, who also man the nineteen larg- 
est class of boats during the herring-fishery, which commences 
about the middle of July, and ends about the 5th September. 

The average income of each able seamen, exclusive of outlay 
for boats, nets, and fishing-tackle, may be from L. 90 to L. 100, 
besides an ample share of fish for food. Cod and herring are let 
for the season to curers at home ; cod at 3d. or 4d. each fish, and 
herring at 10s. to lis. 6d. per cran. Haddocks are generally sold 
at Elgin, or through the county, fresh, smoked, or stone-dried. 

Skipping Trade of Lossiemouth. — The vessels frequenting this 
harbour are of the smaller class, rarely above seventy tons register, 
unless with a ballast cargo. This is owing to the want of water, 
which seldom exceeds nine feet at stream tides. 

The number of vessels which entered inwards during the year 
ending January 1838, was 106, registering 4816 tons, navigated 
by 352 men. The number outwards during the same period with 
cargoes and part cargoes was 44, registering 1918 tons, navigated 
by 144 men. 

The imports, about 4500 tons of English coal ; 1000 tons of 
Scotch coal ; 400 tons bones and bone-dust ; 1 40 tons of bark ; 
150 tons salt; some hundred empty barrels, and other fishing 
stores for curing herring and cod-fish ; and a small cargo of mer- 
chant goods. 

The exports were 4243 quarters of grain, 2000 barrels of her- 
ring, 200 barrels of cod-fish, and three cargoes of plantation 
timber. 

Steam-vessels from London and Leith, trading through the Mo- 
ray Frith, call off this place during the summer season, and when 



DRAINIE. 



157 



weather permits, land and ship goods, passengers, and luggao-e. 
The imports generally are merchant goods, chiefly foreign and co- 
lonial. 

The exports are live-stock, fresh provisions, agricultural produce, 
salmon, pickled cod and herring, making together about 3276 
barrels bulk of five cubic feet each. The English coal imported 
IS used for family use, and carried to Elgin and the adjoining 
country; the Scotch coal for breweries, distilleries, limekilns, and 
brickworks ; the grain goes to the different ports of the kingdom ; 
the herring to the London, Liverpool, and Irish markets, and oc- 
casionally a small cargo to Hamburgh and Stettin. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Elgin, to which there is an excellent toll-road, was, till the 
mtroduction of steam-boats, almost the only mart for the little 
traffic of this parish. There is a daily post. The runner and post- 
master are paid by Government. 

A new and useful harbour is in course of being formed under 
the superintendence of Mr James Bremner of Wick, civil-eno-i- 
neer. The outer and inner basins are excavated from the 
solid rock, and, at ordinary tides, will admit vessels drawino- fifteen 
feet water. 

Ecclesiastical State.— A new and elegant church was built in 1 823. 
It is centrical for the parish, but too far from Lossiemouth and 
Stotfield, where the population is rapidly increasing, and at pre- 
sent constitutes the majority of inhabitants. The church may ac- 
commodate 700. Most of the sittings are free, and rent only 
exacted where there is a competition for front seats. The 
manse, though old, is in decent and comfortable condition. The 
glebe IS six acres in extent, and would rent at L. 9 or L 10 Ster 
Img. The stipend is 1 5 chalders. There are no chapels of ease 
nor chapels of any denomination. The parish church is well at' 
tended There are but few Dissenters, and these attend some 
ol the Secedmg or Dissenting chapels at Elain. 

Education.~mnci\on is at a very low ebb. The parochial 
school IS on the western part of the parish, nearly three miles from 
the poj3ulous villages of Lossiemouth and Stotfield, where a school 
IS much needed. Till some endowment is obtained for a teacher 
there no man properly qualified will accept of the office Thl 
parochial schoolmaster has the maximum salary. 

One charitable institution deserves to be recorded. It took 



158 



ELGINSHIRE. 



its rise from a very calamitous event which befel the fishing 
crews of Stotfield, on Thursday the '25th December 1806, 
when no less than 21 seamen lost their lives, leaving 17 widows 
and 47 children unprovided for,— besides aged parents, and other 
relatives depending for their support on the labours of the deceas- 
ed. Collections to the amount of L. 1075, 13s. were received, 
and a committee of gentlemen appointed to take charge of the 
distribution. They allowed each widow L. 3, and each child under 
fourteen years of age L. 1, 10s. half yearly. By the deaths of 
those originally appointed, the charge devolved on John Jack, Esq., 
merchant in Elgin, to whose accuracy, mildness, and firmness, 
in this business, the parish of Drainie is much indebted. His 
record of the annual distributions will be preserved along with the 
parochial registers. From the fall of interest, the allowance to 
the widow has been, since 1834, reduced to L. 1, 10s. annually. 
Only L.35 Sterling remains at present, and, after a lapse of thirty- 
two years, there are still eight of the widows surviving. 

Poor. — The number of poor on the roll of session is confined 
as much as possible below 40. The sick, infirm, and aged only 
are put on the permanent list. Few in the rural district claim 
sessional aid ; but in the villages of Lossiemouth and Stotfield, the 
number would be tripled, if all who asked relief obtained it. 
Were applications for relief from all disposed to make them, lis- 
tened to, the rental of the parish in a short time would not suffice 
to satisfy the demands. The average annual amount of church 
collections for charitable purposes is L.27, 16s. 9|d. ; donations 
for the last year, L. 7 ; interest of money, L. 320 ; and mort- 
cloth dues, L. 16, 18s.

is that which derives it from two Gaelic words, Far, uis, denoting 
near water,— o. signification which accurately corresponds with the 
locality of the town and parish ; the former of which is built on the 
banks of a small stream, and the latter is bounded, for an extent of 
several miles, by the river and bay of Findhorn. 

Extent, Boundaries, Sc.~The parish extends about four miles 
from north to south, and varies considerably in breadth from east to 
west, being in some places not more than one mile, while in others 
It IS nearly three ; its greatest length is in the direction from north- 
east to south-west. It is of an irregular form, somewhat of a tri- 
angular shape, having a narrow stripe of land projecting from its 
south-east angle for nearly three miles into the adjoining parish 
of RafFord, which it nearly separates into two divisions. It is 
bounded on the north, by the bay or estuary of the river Find- 
horn, a tract of sands and carse ground which is daily overflowed 
by the tide ; on the north-west and west, by the river Findhorn 
which divides it from the united parishes of Dyke and Moy • on 
the south, by a small portion of the parish of Edinkillv, and' the 
parish of RalTord ; and on the east, by the parishes of Rafford and 
Kinloss. It may contain within its limits an area of nearlv seven 
square miles. 

More than one-half of the whole extent of the parish on the 
north-west side, bordering on the river, is an alluvial plain little 
elevated above the level of the sea, under a high state of cultiva- 
tion, and beautifully enclosed and subdivided bv hedges and hede-1 
row trees The central part is agreeably diversified by small 
round hills, and gentle acclivities, the slopes of which are cultiTat 
ed, and the summits covered with thriving plantations or coppice-

wood. The most conspicuous of these are the Cloven hills, so 
called from their peculiar formation, a cluster of abrupt and wood- 
ed eminences, situated close to the town on the east, on which 
public walks have been tastefully formed, which are much resort- 
ed to by the inhabitants of the town, and from whence beautiful 
views are obtained of the surrounding country. On the highest of 
these hills, a handsome octagonal tower of three stories in height, 
in the Gothic castellated style of architecture, having a flat leaden 
roof surrounded with a parapet and embrasures, and surmounted 
by a flag staff", was erected in 1806, by public subscription, in com- 
memoration of Lord Nelson, and the victory of Trafalgar. 

In the south-eastern quarter of the parish, the ground rises gra • 
dually to a very considerable elevation, and is chiefly occupied by 
moorish tracts, which are but partially cultivated, and exhibit a 
striking contrast to the fertility and beauty of the rest of the parish. 
Here, however, the hand of industry is making rapid advances in 
diminishing the waste-ground ; and there is every prospect that, in 
a few years hence, from the united eff'ects of the progress of culti- 
vation, and the growth of plantations which have been lately form- 
ed, this division of the parish will present a very improved appear- 
ance. The southern portion is principally composed of low wet 
land, interspersed with tracts of deep moss ; these, however, have 
of late years been much improved by draining, and are now almost 
entirely under cultivation. 

The south-west corner of the parish is altogether covered with 
extensive plantations of Scotch fir and larch, with the exception 
of the farm of Cot-hall, which consists of several beautiful fields 
of haugh-land on the banks of the Findhorn, surrounded by state- 
ly timber trees, and separated by a broad expanse of wood from 
the other cultivated parts of the parish. 

The general aspect of the parish, when viewed from any of the 
commanding eminences in the neighbourhood of the town, is rich 
and delightful, and presents to the eye a landscape abounding in 
every feature of rural beauty. From Nelson's Tower is obtained a 
splendid panoramic view, which, for extent and beauty, is scarcely 
excelled in any other part of Scotland. Extending far beyond, the 
limits of the parish, it embraces a large portion of the plain of 
Moray, studded with towns, hamlets, gentlemen's seats, and well- 
cultivated farms, interspersed with groves and winding streams, 
and adorned with extensive woods and plantations. Bounding this 
foreground on the north, is seen the Moray Frith, in its whole

extent from Inverness, eastwards until it expands into the German 
Ocean, and beyond it the mountains of Ross, Sutherland, and 
Caithness. 

Soil, Climate, c'c— As may be supposed, from the above topo- 
graphical description, the soil varies considerably accordino- to its 
situation. In the lower and more fertile part of the parish,°it is a. 
fine loam, in some places having an admixture of clay, and in ge- 
neral superincumbent on a sandy or gravelly subsoil. Vhen under 
good management, it yields in luxuriance all kinds of grain 
and green crops. The high ground in the south-east of the pa- 
rish IS composed in some places of a retentive clayev soil, and in 
others of a compound of sand and moss, having likewise an ad- 
mixture of gravel and large stones which impede the plough, and 
render its improvement very laborious. The middle part of the 
parish IS generally of a light sandy nature, which, however, when 
properly fertilized with manure, is highly productive. 

Morayshire has been always celebrated for the excellence of is 
chmate, and the parish of Forres partakes in a high decree of the 
general mildness, dryness, and salubrity of the county : facts which 
are fu ly established by the general healthiness and lonoevitv of 
the inhabitants. The parish is very seldom visited with severe 
epidemic diseases, although fevers are not uncommon, and cases of 
consumption and other pulmonary complaints are extremely rare 
No case of Asiatic cholera has occurred in the parish Se- 
veral individuals have of late years been known to attain nearly a 
hundred years of age ; and there are still living in the parish seve- 
ral persons considerably above ninety,-while it is no uncommon cir- 
cumstance to see men and women employed inactive labour, who 
are upwards o eighty Less rain falls here than in most other dis- 
tricts of Scotland, which, taken together with the dryness of the 
SOI , renders the country in the neighbourhood of Forres particu- 
lar y agreeable to reside in, and remarkably early in the l ipening 
of crops and fruits Cherries often ripen in favoured situatL.s if 
the first week of June, and barley harvest frequently commences 
about the middle of July. The prevailing winds throughout the 
year are the west and south-west, which are generally accompanied 
with dry and genial weather; but in the spring season there is of- 
ten a period when cold easterly winds prevail, which retard the 
eary vegetation, and destroy the fruit blossoms in the gardens 

Hydrography It has been already mentioned that the n'ver 
Findhorn bounds the parish throughout its whole length on the

north-west. It has its source in the mountains to the south of In- 
verness, and, after a course of nearly forty miles, falls into the Mo- 
ray Frith about four miles below Forres. It flows for a great part 
of its course between high rocky and wooded banks, exhibiting in 
many places the most beautiful and picturesque scenery. It is a 
large and impetuous river, and is often subject to sudden and de- 
structive floods. The greatest of these of which there is any re- 
cord, was that which took place on the 3d and 4th of August 
1829, and which is so accurately and graphically described by Sir 
Thomas Dick Lauder, in his very interesting account of that calami- 
tous event. The Plain of Forres was, on that occasion, the principal 
scene of its ravages, and its effects in this parish are still visibly mark- 
ed along the banks of the river. The parish is likewise watered by 
the burn of Forres, a small stream which rises in the adjoining pa- 
rish of Rafford, and after winding through the beautifully wooded 
grounds of Burdyards in this parish, it passes close to the west end 
of the town, at the base of its ancient Castle hill, having its course 
enlivened by several mills and a public bleaching-green. Besides 
the above, another small brook runs through the parish and joins 
the burn close to the town. There are also several perennial springs 
of excellent water, which amply supply the wants of the inhabitants. 

Geology. — There is little in this parish to interest the geologist. 
The only rocks within its confines are of the secondary class of 
sandstone and limestone. They are situated in the south end of 
the parish, and are most conspicuous on the banks of the Find- 
horn, where they project in several places in high and precipitous 
cliffs overhanging the river, and form important features of the 
picturesque surrounding scenery. 

Zoology. — Most of the animals generally met with in the other 
low and improved districts of Scotland are abundant, or occasion- 
ally to be seen in the parish. Of the rarer quadrupeds, it may 
be mentioned, that roe-deer sometimes are found in the woods of 
Burdyards and Mundole. Foxes and polecats, although not nu- 
merous, inhabit the same localities, where they prey on rabbits, 
which have of late increased to a great extent, and have become 
a serious nuisance. Badgers are known to exist, and traces of 
otters have been at different times observed along the banks of 
the river and burn. 

Oi birds, — the pheasant has of late years been introduced, and 
thrives well in the parish, and partridges and snipes are abundant. 
The ringdove is common in all the woods. Various species of 



FORRES.

tlie hawk tribe are frequently seen ; but the kite, more commonly 
known here as the glead, has almost entirely disappeared from the 
parish. Different varieties of swallow, and also the swift, annu- 
ally appear and disappear in their seasons ; but it has been re- 
marked that the cuckoo is not now so regular a visitant of the pa- 
rish as in former years, and several successive summers have of 
late passed without its delightful note being heard. Of the song- 
ster tribe, the thrush, the blackbird, and the linnet are common; 
and the siskin, bullfinch, and goldfinch, although not so numerous, 
may always be found. The water-ouzel frequents the sides of 
the streams, and instances have been known of the kingfisher being 
seen in the same vicinity. It must not be omitted, that on the 
banks of the Findhorn, at the verge of this parish, a colony of 
herons have for ages established themselves. Their nests are 
built in a few aged trees, and on the face of a precipitous rock, 
from the top of which the spectator can look down unobserved, 
and witness many of the curious habits of this peculiar bird. 
They are strictly protected from disturbance by the Earl of Mo- 
ray and Sir William G. Gumming, the proprietors of the adjoin- 
ing ground. Numerous flocks of wild-geese, and ducks of several 
species, frequent the Bay of Findhorn in the winter and spring 
seasons, and in severe winters swans are sometimes seen, and have 
been shot in the parish. 

\Vood.~T\-ees of all kinds grow well in the parish, and good 
specimens are to be seen of oak, ash, elm, plane, and beech. 
The finest oaks are on the banks of the Findhorn, at Cot-hall, and 
belong to Sir William G. Gumming. There is an avenue of lofty 
and venerable ash-trees along the turnpike road, leading to For- 
res from the west, which have a fine effect in approaching the 
town. They are said to have been planted, upwards of a century 
ago, by direction of Mary Sleigh, wife of Alexander Brodie, Esq. 
of Brodie, the Lord Lyon,— a lady whose memory is still che- 
rished in the neighbourhood as a great improver and benefactress of 
the district. There are likewise some beautiful large beeches and 
elms near the mansion-house of Sanquar. A great part of the 
wood in the parish is under forty years of age, and chiefly consists 
of plantations of oak, larch, and Scotch fir. The most extensive 
of these belong to Sir William G. Gumming and Mr Eraser Tyt- 
ier, and are well managed with respect to thinning and pruning. 
, n. — GiviL History. 

No ancient documents exist which throw light on the early his-

ELGINSHIRE. 



tory of this parish, but there can be no doubt that Forres was a 
place of considerable importance at a very remote period. Some 
ancient writers suppose it to have been the Varis of Ptolemy. 
King Duffus, when residing in the castle, was treacherously mur- 
dered by the governor in 966. We learn from some early histo- 
rians, that the " gracious" King Duncan had his camp at Forres, 
and that it was when proceeding to join him there, that Macbeth 
and Banquo were met by the Weird Sisters. There is evidence extant 
that, at subsequent periods, this castle was occupied by our Scottish 
Monarchs. The writer of this has seen an original charter of some 
lands in the neighbourhood, granted here by Alexander II. 
It is not exactly known when the town first enjoyed the privileges 
of a royal burgh ; the oldest charter now possessed by it is one de 
7tovodamus, granted by James IV., dated 23d June 1496, and 
which bears that " the ancient charters of the burgh had been 
destroyed by fire and other accidents, and therefore the king of 
new erects it into a royal burgh." 

A plan of the town was published in Wood's Town Atlas, in 
1825. . 

The town is built on a low ridge of ground, which stretches from 
the base of the Cloven hills, and is elevated about forty or fifty feet 
above the adjoining plain. The main street extends more than 
half-a-mile from east to west, and has declivities on each side, on 
which minor streets or lanes branch off and communicate with the 
country. The streets are well paved and lighted with gas; and 
the town presents, on the whole, a remarkably neat and clean ap- 
pearance. In the principal street, are several handsome houses 
and public buildings. In the centre, is the town-house, a very 
beautiful edifice, completed in 1839, and built on the site of the 
former tolbooth. It is a Gothic structure, having a square tower 
on one side, with a bartizan, on which is raised another of octa- 
gonal shape, surmounted by a dome and vane. It contains a 
spacious court-h tuse, and other accommodation for the Sheriff and 
Justice of Peace small debt courts, which are regularly held here, 
besides a council-chamber, a record- room, the post-office, and 
business apartments for the town- clerk. The tower and dome 
are much admired for the beauty of their proportions, and form a 
great ornament to the town and neighbourhood. The parish 
church is a large plain building, and stands on the north side of 
the street, near the west end. A small Episcopal chapel, the in- 
terior of which is very elegantly fitted up, was erected last year

chiefly by subscriptions from the neighbouring gentry, who prin- 
cipally attend it. Anderson's Academical Institution, built about 
twenty years ago, is a handsome building in the Grecian style, adorn- 
ed with a spire and public clock ; it was endowed by the late Jona- 
than Anderson, Esq. of Glasgow, for the education of poor chil- 
dren, from the parishes of Forres, Raflford, and Kinloss. St Law- 
rence Mason Lodge, built from a design by Mr Simpson of Aber- 
deen, is another striking ornament of the town, and includes a 
ball-room, supper-room, and other apartments for the meetings of 
the brethren. 

Antiquities. — Allusion has already been made to the ancient 
castle or fort which existed here, as being the occasional residence 
of royalty. It stood at the west end of the town, on a green mound 
where the ridge on which the town stands abruptly terminates, and 
is washed at its base by the burn of Forres. Scarcely any traces 
of the ancient buildings now remain to indicate its extent or form, 
but, judging from the area of ground on the summit of the hill, it 
could not have been very considerable. There can be no doubt 
that it was originally occupied as a royal fort, to which state pri- 
soners were brought from all parts of the north of Scotland for 
trial and punishment. It afterwards belonged to the Earls of Mo- 
ray, probably as the delegates of royal power in the district, and 
from them it devolved by inheritance on the Dunbars of Westfield, 
who held, until a late period, the office of hereditary sheriff of Mo- 
ray. This last family resided here, and the building which now exists 
was intended by them as part of a new structure contemplated for 
their accommodation, in substitution of the former castle. It is now 
the property of the Right Honourable the Earl of Seafield. The 
remarkable obelisk so generally known as the " Forres Pillar," or 
Sweno's Stone, although in the close vicinity of the town, is not 
within the limits of the parish. It may therefore suffice here to 
state, that it is still in tolerable preservation, although the effects 
of time are gradually eff'acing the emblematic sculpture on its 
surface. A correct engraving of one side of this splendid obe» 
lisk is to be found in the edition of " Shaw's History of Mo- 
ray," published in 1827. In corroboration of its traditional his- 
tory, that it was intended to commemorate a victory obtained by 
the Danes at this place, it may be mentioned, that, about thirty 
years ago, a number of human skeletons were dug up within a few 
yards of it. 

Eminent Men. — Under this head, the name of Mr James Dick 



ELGINSHIKE. 



is preeminently deserving of notice. Mr Dick left his native pa- 
rish, early in life, and v-ent to America, where he accumulated a 
large fortune, and at his death in 18-28 bequeathed L. 140,000 for 
the benefit of the parochial schoolmasters of the counties of Mo- 
ray, Banff, and Aberdeen ; a sum, the interest of which gives from 
L. 20 to L. 30 per annum to each schoolmaster in these counties. 
This fund has been hitherto admirably managed by the trustees, 
leading members of the Society of Writers to the Signet in Edin- 
burgh, and under the particular inspection of Allan Menzies, Esq. 
W. S., a gentleman eminently qualified for the important duties 
to which he has been appointed. It is certainly matter of sur- 
prise, that the enlightened class of persons who participate in Mr 
Dick's patriotic and noble generosity have as yet taken no decid- 
ed steps to testify their gratitude to him, by erecting some testimo- 
nial to his memory. The inhabitants of Forres are desirous 
to unite with those who share so largely in his bounty, in rais- 
ing some suitable monument in his native town, and where the re- 
mains of his parents and ancestors repose, to record the obliga- 
tion of the country generally, and of the schoolmasters of the three 
counties in particular, to this great friend of education ; and it is 
to be hoped, that, at no distant period, their wishes will be respond- 
ed to by those gentlemen, to whom, perhaps, should belong the 
merit of originating such a measure. 

The late John Gordon, Esq. M. D. of Edinburgh, was also a 
native of Forres, and though his sun went down at noon, it shed 
a lustre on the place which gave him birth and on his country, ere 
it set. 

The family of the late Provost Duncan Grant of Forres have, 
by their distinguished merit and success in life, reflected honour 
on their native parish. The eldest son, Mr Walter Grant, died 
early in life in India, but not until he had earned a high reputa- 
tion as a barrister. His brother, the late Lieutenant- Colonel 
Alexander Grant, H. E. I. C. S., was no less distinguished as a 
soldier than his brother was as a lawyer. His bravery was conspicu- 
ously displayed at the Battle of Assaye, to which victory he greatly 
contributed by his gallantry. Another brother, the late Lieute- 
nant-Colonel Colquhoun Grant, was intrusted with the most im- 
portant and confidential services by the Duke of Wellington dur- 
ing the Peninsular war, in which he acquitted himself under cir- 
cumstances of extraordinary difficulty and danger, with remarkable 
courage and success. His services and merits are well described

and eulogised by Lieutenant- Colonel Napier, in his History of the 
Peninsular War. Two brothers are still living of this family, and 
enjoying their well-earned honours, viz. Sir Janies R. Grant of the 
Hill near Carlisle, who held the office of Principal Inspector of 
Hospitals, and superintended the medical department of the army 
in France in 1815, and Lieutenant-General Sir Lewis Grant, 
K.C.H., late Governor of the Island of Trinidad, and Colonel of 
the 96th foot. The sister of these gentlemen also connects with 
this parish her husband, the much respected and esteemed Sir 
James M'Grigor, Bart., Director-General of the Army Medical 
Department. 

The late John Hoyes, Esq. Speaker of the House of Assembly 
in the Island of Granada, should not be omitted in this list of 
names, — a gentleman whose warm and generous feelings were al- 
ways evinced whenever opportunities occurred of rendering services 
to his native parish. 

Land-oioners, — The state of property has undergone many 
changes within the last fifty years. At present thechief land-owners 
are, William F. Tytler, Esq. of Burdyards ; Major Grant Peterkin 
of Invererne and Grievshop ; Sir William G. Cumming, Bart. ; 
Archibald Leslie, Esq. of Balnagieth; the town of Forres; the 
Earl of Moray ; the Earl of Seafield ; Miss Smith of Waterford ; 

Gordon, Esq. of Thornhill; Greig, Esq. of Lin- 

gieston ; Lieutenant- Colonel Frazer of Drumduan ; John For- 
syth, Esq. of Springfield ; and Alexander Smith, Esq. of Bog- 
Ion ; all of these have land worth L. 50 of yearly rent; the two 
first mentioned possess more than half of the parish. 

Mansion- Houses. — Sanquar- House, the seat of Mr Eraser Tyt- 
ler, is particularly deserving of notice. It is situated about a mile 
to the south of the town, amidst well-wooded and beautifully varied 
grounds, through which the burn winds for upwards of a mile, and 
expands into a small lake in front of the house. Being situated 
on an elevated bank, it commands a fine view of the town and rich 
plain below. About a mile to the north of the town is Invererne, 
formerly Tannachy, a handsome building erected in 1818 ; it is 
surrounded by some thriving plantations, and attached is an ex- 
cellent and productive garden, and spacious stables and farm-offices. 
Forres House, immediately at the east end of the town, is a large 
and commodious mansion ; it is the property of Sir William Gor- 
don Cumming, Bart, and was formerly the residence of the Dow- 
ager Lady Cumming Gordon, but since her death has been let

to tenants. Druiriduaii, situated upon an eminence about a quar- 
ter of a mile from the town to the eastward, is an elegant villa, 
and commands an extensive view of the surrounding country. 

Parochial Registers. — Registers of births, baptisms, and mar - 
riages are regularly kept. There is a disposition, hoviever, often 
shown to neglect the registration of births, merely to save the small 
fee of Is. charged for registration. Few think of registering 
deaths and burials, and the register of these is very defective. 
The earliest register of births, &amp;c. is dated May 1675. That of 
marriages bears the same date. 

III. — Population.

the former Statistical Account, was

In 1831 there were in the parish, families, - 1018 



Of which were employed in agriculture, 264 

trade, &amp;c. 464 

According to the above returns, it would appear that the popu- 
lation has fluctuated considerably during the last forty years. 
From 180] to 181 1, a diminution seems to have taken place, which 
was followed, during the next ten years, by a considerable increase. 
This may perhaps be accounted for by the number of men who 
entered the army, and who were, during the war, withdrawn from 
the parish ; many of these served in the militia regiments, which 
were stationed chiefly in England, and had their families along 
with them. The diminution in the population which has occur- 
red during the last ten years, it is not so easy to explain, as the 
number of families during the same period has rather increased. 
The mostprobable solution, however, of this is, thata number of single 
persons have of late years emigrated to the Colonies. There are 
generally resident in this parish three or four families of independ- 
ent fortune, although at present none of the principal heritors 
reside on their estates ; but several of their houses are occupied 
by gentlemen of independent fortune as tenants. There are, be- 



FOIlllES. 



sides these, a few individuals and families not engaged in business, 
living in the town on moderate private means. 

Habits and Character of the People, SfC. — The great body of 
the people enjoy in a considerable measure the comforts and ad- 
vantages of society, and are generally contented with their condi- 
tion in life. They are warmly attached to their own town and pa- 
rish, the beauty and amenity of which they highly appreciate, and 
take a zealous and lively interest in promoting every measure cal- 
culated for their embellishment and improvement. On occasions 
of public excitement they particularly manifest sentiments of loy- 
alty and patriotism; and it may be truly said that Chartists, Soci- 
alists, or similar characters have met with little encouragement 
among them. The people are decent and orderly in their outward 
deportment, and are regularly observant of the public ordi- 
nances of religion. The lower orders are frugal and indus- 
trious, and have of late years much improved in habits of clean- 
liness both in their houses and dress. It is much to be lamented, 
however, that so many houses and shops for the retail of ardent 
spirits are permitted within the town, and if fewer existed, there 
can be no doubt the moral and religious character, as well as 
comfort and happiness of the people, would improve. It may be 
observed, that nothing has tended more to the demoralization of 
the working-classes than the frequency of fairs and markets which 
are held in the burgh, and particularly of the half-yearly feeing 
markets for ao-ricultural servants, which have been established with- 
in the last few years. These markets are much under the con- 
trol and regulation of the farmers of the district ; and it is earn- 
estly hoped that they will soon see the propriety of altering a 
system which has already produced but too great effects in low- 
ering the standard of morals of our labouring classes, both male 
and female. 

Language. — The English language is universally spoken in the 
parish. There are perhaps 200 individuals who speak Gaelic, 
chiefly old persons, natives of the Highlands, and of these one- 
half may understand it better than English, but their number is 
yearly diminishing. 

There are six insane persons connected with the parish, three 
of whom are supported at the expense of the heritors, in well-con- 
ducted asylums, and the others are under the care of their friends. 
One deaf and dumb boy has been sent to an institution in Lon-

don tor the education of such unfortunate children, and one blind 
girl has been recently sent to the Edinburgh Blind Asylum. 

IV. — Industry. 

There are no manufactures in Forres, but such as are required 
for the supply of the town and neighbourhood, and these consist 
in the production of the more ordinary kinds of handicraft labour. 
The principal trade of the shopkeepers and dealers is in the retail 
of all varieties of goods and wares usually required to meet the 
consumption of a populous agricultural district, and such is now 
the Aicility and readiness of communication, and ease of transpor- 
tation of goods, that almost every article of ordinary consumption 
can be purchased of equal quality, and as cheaply, in this north- 
ern burgh, as in the manufiicturing marts of the south. 

Agriculture, — As no accurate plans exist of some of the estates 
in the parish, it is impossible to state precisely the extent of land 
it contains. The following statement, however, h:is been taken 
from certain data afforded, and may be considered as a near ap- 
proximation to the truth. 

Cultivated, - 3300 Imperial acres. 

Uncultivated, - 700 

Under wood, about - 1200 

There is at present no ground in a state of undivided common. 
Within the last few years, the only common in the parish, consist- 
ing of a large moor, was divided under authority of the sheriff, and 
a great part of it has been since enclosed and planted. Of the 
uncultivated land there is an extent of about 200 acres, which 
might be profitably converted into arable land. It consists of a 
high moor, belonging in property to the town corporation. Por- 
tions of it have, within the last few years, been judiciously let by 
the magistrates, in small allotments, on improving leases, and se- 
veral of the tenants have already succeeded in raising luxuriant 
crops in places, which, until of late, presented a very barren and 
rugged appearance. 

The cultivated land is chiefly divided into farms varying in size 
from 20 to 150 acres: but there is also a considerable extent of 
ground immediately adjacent to the town, occupied in small tene- 
ments under ten acres. These are held by various classes of per- 
sons in the burgh, who engage in a limited way in agricultural 
pursuits. 

The larger farms are generally held on leases, the usual dura- 
tion of which is nineteen years, although shorter leases are also

common. The farm-houses and steadings in the parish are, al- 
most without exception, good and commodious ; many of them have 
been recently erected, and are well arranged, and substantial stone 
buildings roofed with slates. To most of them are attached thrash- 
ing machines driven by horses, and on one farm there is a machine 
of this kind worked by a steam-engine. 

Husbandry. — The most usual rotation of crops is, \st, turnips 
and potatoes or fallow ; 27, wheat and barley ; grass, part 
of which is made into hay ; Ath, grass pastured ; bth wheat or 
barley, and oats ; QtJi, oats. In the smaller farms, the same re- 
gularity of cropping is not observed, and particularly in the parks 
near the town, where the facility of obtaining and applying manure 
render the ordinary rotation unnecessary. 

Cattle. — There are no particular breeds of cattle or sheep pe- 
culiar to the parish, nor indeed to the county. Many of the far- 
mers change their live-stock annually. In the end of the season, 
they purchase animals most frequently oxen, brought from the 
northern counties, which they dispose of in the following spring 
or summer to drovers from the south. In the farms nearest to the 
town, cows are chiefly kept, as being more profitable, from the con- 
stant demand which exists for all dairy produce. 

Rent. — The rent of land varies greatly, according to its situa- 
tion and quality. Near the town, L. 4 and L.5 are commonly paid 
for good land per Scotch acre ; and for the best land in the more 
distant parts from L.2, 10s. to L.3 are obtained ; while in other 
parts, where the soil is of an inferior quality, the rent is as low as 
L. 1. The valued rent of the parish is L. 2954, 6s. 6d. ; the real 
land rent amounts to about L. 6000, and the annual value of real 
property in the own to nearly L. 1800. 

Fishing. — There is a valuable salmon-fishing on the Findhorn, 
within the parish, which has been managed for many years for the 
behoof of the proprietors, Messrs Forbes and Co. of Aberdeen. 
It has fluctuated much in value of late years, and was greatly in- 
jured by the flood of 1829 ; but it is understood that, during the 
last two or three seasons, it has again improved. 

Quarry. — There is a limestone quarry on the farm of Mundole, 
belonging to Sir William G. Gumming, where kilns are in con- 
stant operation, and lime is sold, but chiefly to the proprietor's own 
tenants. 

Mills. — There are flour and meal-mills on the burn of Forres, 
which are kept in full employment, and where considerable quan- 



172

titles of grain are ground annually. The Messrs Urquhart have 
a powerful saw-mill, where timber is sawn into deals, spars, &amp;c. 
Of late, they have prepared a quantity of wood-pavement, cut into 
small hexagonal blocks, for the streets of London. There is a 
brewery, and also a distillery in the close neighbourhood of the 
town. 

Produce. — The value of the average annual produce of the parish, 
so far as can be ascertained, may be stated as follows : 

Grain and straw, . L. 10,0U0 

Potatoes, turnips, &amp;c. . 3.500 

Grass, . . . 4,000 

Salmon-fishing, . . 500 

Wood, ... 200 
Gardens, ... 100 

Total, L. 18,300 
Wages. — The rates of wages for agricultural servants are, for 
males, from L. 9 to L. 12 per annum, besides food, for which an 
allowance is often given of six bolls of meal, besides a quantity of 
potatoes. Females receive from L. 4 to L. 5 and their victuals. 
The wages of day-labourers vary from Is. 6d. to 2s. per day ; car- 
penters receive from 2s. to 2s. 6d. ; and masons, 2s. 6d. and 3s. 

An agricultural society was instituted about ten years ago, 
which holds several meetings annually in the town, and of which 
most of the farmers in this as well as the adjoining parishes are 
members. Cattle-shows take place every summer, in the month 
of July, under their auspices, at which premiums are awarded to 
the exhibitors of the best animals of each class of stock, — and the 
good effects resulting from the establishment of the society have 
already become apparent in the increased anxiety and enterprise 
of the ftirmers to procure improved breeds of stock of all kinds. 

HorticuUural Societi/. — No branch of rural economy has re- 
ceived more encouragement in the parish of late years, than gar- 
dening. A horticultural society was established a few years ago, 
under the patronage of the Earl of Moray and several of the 
neighbouring gentlemen, with the view of exciting more general 
attention to the cultivation of garden produce. Two exhibitions 
of fruits, flowers, and vegetables take place annually under the 
auspices of the Society, in June and September, at which prizes 
are awarded for the best specimens. The institution has hitherto 
been very successfully managed ; the flower-shows have been 
pleasingly and tastefully conducted, and have been generally at- 
tended by a numerous and gay assemblage of company from all 
parts of the county.

v.— Parochial Economy. 

Toivn.— It has already been stated that Forres is not a place of 
manufacturing importance, and that the employments of the peo- 
ple consist in the ordinary trades of retail and handicraft. Since 
the Reform Act, the town has been governed by a provost, three 
bailies, a dean of guild, a treasurer, and twelve councillors— a pro- 
portion of whom are annually elected by the constituency of the 
burgh. The revenue of the town is about L. 550, — and is deriv- 
ed from lands, feu-duties, petty customs, &amp;c. 

There are daily markets for butcher-meat and fish ; twice a 
week for butter, eggs, poultry, &amp;c. ; and grain markets on every 
Tuesday. Fairs are held on the first Wednesday of January, third 
Wednesdays of February, April, and May ; first Wednesday of 
July; fourth Wednesdays of August and September; and third Wed- 
nesday of November. Besides these, feeing markets for agricul- 
tural servants take place on the Saturdays preceding the terms of 
Whitsundays and Martinmas. 

Means of Communication. — The most ample means are enjoyed 
by the inhabitants of communicating with other parts of the coun- 
try. The turnpike road from Aberdeen to Inverness passes through 
the town, on which a mail-coach and two stage coaches travel daily. 
There is likewise a turnpike road to Findhorn, five miles off, 
where the London and Leith steam-boats call regularly. The 
parish is intersected in all directions by district roads, which are 
kept in excellent order. There are four stone bridges on the 
burn, within the limits of the parish, all of which are in good 
repair; and where the turnpike road crosses the river Findhorn, 
at the western extremity of the parish, is a chain-bridge, which 
merits more particular notice, as it forms one of the greatest orna- 
ments of the county, and, although not so large as some others, 
is certainly one of the most elegant structures of the kind in Scot- 
land. It was erected in 1831, to replace the former stone bridge 
at the same place, which was destroyed by the great flood of 1829, 
and when completed was opened to the public with a grand cere- 
monial procession early in 1832. The design was aff"orded by Sir 
Samuel Brown, R. N. the celebrated engineer, who contracted to sup- 
ply the iron work, and the work was superintended by his able as- 
sistant, Mr Mitchell. Beautiful Gothic archways, which form the 
entrance to the bridge at either end, are flanked on each side by 
finely proportioned towers, built of a beautiful light coloured free-

Stone, on which rest the massive chains from which the platform 
IS suspended. The whole work was admirably executed, and re- 
flects great credit on the workmen employed. The expense of 
the building amounted to nearly L. 7000, which was principally 
subscribed by the spirited and enterprising inhabitants of Forres, 
aided by the land-owners of the neighbourhood. A pontage is 
exacted, under authority of an Act of Parliament, for the pri- 
vilege of passing the bridge, and affords a remunerating revenue 
to those who have advanced their money for this noble and useful 
structure. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is conveniently situated ; 
it was built in 1775, and was partially repaired and painted about 
th ree years ago, when an additional gallery vias put up by the he- 
ritors, which accommodates nearly 100 sitters. The whole church 
is seated to accommodaie about 1000 persons, and that number 
usually attend divine service. About 600 of the sittings are let, 
and the rents are paid to the heritors. The parishioners have 
lighted the church with gas at their own expense, for the conve- 
nience of those who attend divine service, and the Sabbath schools, 
in the evenings. It is in tolerable repair, but is far from being a 
suitable church for the parish in size, convenience, comfort, or or- 
nament. The manse was built in 1818 ; it has not undergone 
any material repair since it was built, and is at present in need of 
considerable improvement. The glebe is about five and a-half 
Scotch acres in extent, and would bring a rent of L. 25 a year if 
let. The stipend is eighteen chalders, half meal and half bar- 
ley, payable at the county fiar prices. 

There are no chapels of ease or Government churches in the 
parish connected with the Established Church, but there are three 
Dissenting chapels, one of which is connected with the United As- 
sociate Synod of the Secession Church, another belongs to the 
Independents, and the third to the Scotch Episcopal Church. The 
first of these is attended by a large congregation, amounting to seve- 
ral hundred persons, but of these a considerable proportion com.e 
from the neighbouring parishes. The Independents are not a nu- 
merous body, and there are only a very few families of Episcopa- 
lians resident in the parish. The ministers of these chapels are 
paid by the seat rents and Sabbath-day collections of their hearers. 
There is no place of worship for Roman Catholics in the parish. 

There are two services in th parish church every Lord's day, 
and on some occasions three. The number of communicants be- 



FOUUES. 

loncrina to the Establislied Church in the parish is about 340 ; 
non-parishioners who communicate, about 320. 

Collections and contributions are regularly made for the religi- 
ous and educational schemes of the church, amounting to from 
L. 26 to L. 30 a-year, being somewhat more than L. 5 annually 
for each of these important religious institutions. 

Education.— There are six schools in the parish for the educa- 
tion of boys, taught by male teachers, four of which are associated 
in the academy, or Anderson's Academical Institution. The teach- 
ers of three of these being the parochial schoolmasters, receive sa- 
laries from the funds of the burgh ; the fourth, a charity school, 
for educating poor children of the parishes of Forres, Rafford, and 
Kinloss, is endowed by funds left by the late Jonathan Anderson, 
Esq. of Glasgow. The other two schools are supported by the 
fees and contributions of the scholars. There are two boarding- 
schools for young ladies, having four teachers, neither of which is 
endowed ; and there are two other females who teach a few chil- 
dren, and receive small salaries from the burgh funds, besides fees. 

At the academy, including the free school, the branches of edu- 
cation taught are, the English, French, Latin, and Greek lan- 
guages, writing, arithmetic, mathematics, English grammar, geo- 
graphy, history, and drawing. In the boarding-schools are taught 
all the common branches of female education, such as the Eng- 
lish, French, and Italian languages, English reading, grammar, 
history, geography, writing, arithmetic, music, drawing, and all 
kinds of needle-work. Sacred biography, and history, together with 
an acquaintance with the principles, doctrines, and duties of Christ- 
ianity, are taught in all the male and female schools, and several 
of the teachers, both male and female, assist in the Sabbath even- 
ing school taught in the parish church, which is commonly attend- 
ed by from 200 to 300 children. 

When the last minute examination was made into the numbers 
of children attending the schools of Forres, it was found, that 
644 were then receiving education, of which number 379 were 
boys, and 265 girls. About the same number, and in the same 
proportion, of boys and girls are attending the different schools at 
present, which is perhaps as high a proportion relatively to the po- 
pulation as is to be found in any other parish in the country. 

Literature. — A Subscription Library was established about forty 
years ago, which contains a tolerably good collection of books, prin- 
cipally in the departments of history, travels, periodicals, &amp;c. which 



176 



ELGINSHIRE. 



are given out for perusal to the contributors of a small annual sum. 
It is managed by a president and small board of directors. 

A newspaper, entitled the Forres Gazette, was established about 
six years ago, and is still published on the first Wednesday of 
each month. 

Charitable and other Institutions. — A Ladies' Charitable So- 
ciety has existed for many years, and has been productive of much 
good. The benevolent zeal of many of its members in visiting 
and relieving the distressed objects of their charity, is most con- 
spicuous, nor are their unremitting exertions in contributing and 
collecting funds to meet their disbursements less praiseworthy. 
A cholera hospital was built in 1832, but happily it has never 
been found necessary to use it for its intended purpose. It has 
been fitted up as a temporary prison. A dispensary was esta- 
blished a few years ago for providing medicines for the poorer 
classes ; it is superintended by the medical gentlemen of the 
place in monthly rotation, who give their professional services 
gratuitously to the poor. A saving bank has been in operation 
for a good many years, and is in a prosperous state. There are 
also several Trades and Friendly Societies of old dates in the 
town. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is nearly 200, and the average sum given 
to each is L.l, 6s. 6d. annually, or 6d. weekly, which includes 
the price of two barrels of coals to each. 

The funds at the disposal of the session for the last year were 
derived from the following sources : 

Collections at the parish church, - L.80 10 0 

Interest of money belonging to the poor, - 12 0 0 

Dick's bequest in money, - - 20 0 0 

Do. coals, - - - 30 0 0 

Rent of lands for poor, called moitified fund, 20 ' 0 0 

Bequest by the late John Hoyes, Esq. - 22 10 0 

From the "heritors, - - - - 60 0 0 

L.265 0 0 

It has been already stated, that the heritors also support three 
pauper lunatics, at an expense of from L.40 to L.50 annually. 
There is little disposition on the part of the poor to refrain from 
seeking parochial relief, and the feelings of independence and 
honest shame, by which they were wont to be influenced on this 
subject, are fast giving way, and contrary dispositions taking their 
place. It may be observed that this burgh, being in the heart of 
a rich and well cultivated district, many labourers and farm-ser- 



FOUllES. 



177 



vants, when unfit to support themselves as in their youthful days, 
seek a residence in the town, there being few places in the country 
parts where they can be accommodated. This has been long felt 
as a great evil, and will continue to operate until the proprietors 
of small cheap houses in the town are in some way obliged to feel 
that they are increasing their own burdens, by encouraging poor 
decayed persons to come to occupy their miserable abodes. A 
great proportion of the poor are from other parishes ; many from 
the Highland districts. 

Prison. — The old jail having been pulled down about four 
years ago to make way for the erection of the present town-house, 
there is no regular prison at present in the burgh. The only 
place of that kind is a building in the outskirts of the town, used 
temporarily as a place of confinement. It is understood that the 
General Prison Board have resolved that there shall be no jail 
in the town for civil debtors or criminals incarcerated for any 
lengthened period, and that these shall be sent to the county 
jail in Elgin. They have determined, however, to build a lock- 
up house, containing a few cells, for the temporary imprisonment 
of offenders. 

Inns, 4rc. — The number of houses licensed for the sale of ale 
and spirits in the town and parish is very great ; and there can be no 
doubt that it might be much reduced with great advantage to the 
morals and habits of the people. 

Fuel. — The principal fuel used is coal, chiefly brought from 
Newcastle, and conveyed in carts from the neighbouring sea-port 
of Findhorn ; including the land-carriage, it may be purchased 
for from 2s. 4d. to 2s. 6d. per barrel. Peats and turf are also 
brought weekly to the town in small carts, by the peasants from 
the adjoining hilly parishes, but they are not much used, and are 
found equally expensive as coal. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
This parish has fully kept pace with other districts of the coun- 
try in the general improvements which have taken place, during 
the last fifty years. A very superior system of agriculture is now 
generally adopted to what formerly existed. Much more atten- 
tion is now paid to cleaning and draining land, and a greater regu- 
larity is observed in the rotation of crops. Improved breeds of 
horses and cattle have been introduced into the parish, and the 
farmers are more characterized and stimulated by a desire of im- 
provement, and evince a greater readiness than their predecessors 

ELGIN. M

to adopt changes which are likely to prove beneficial. Large 
tracts of ground in the parish which, thirty years ago, were bare 
moors, are now covered with thriving plantations, or have been sub- 
jected to the plough ; but it may be remarked, that, while the 
land rent is at present nearly double of what it was at the date of 
the former Statistical Account, it may be doubted whether the 
wealth of the community is increased, or the commerce and trade of 
the town extended. The greatest changes have occurred in the 
public improvements of the town, and in the altered habits, 
tastes, and manners of the people. 

During the last thirty years the streets of the town have been 
newly paved, lighted with gas, and embellished by the erection of 
a number of handsome bui Idirgs. In 1793, there was only one 
small bridge in the parish, and the passage across the Findhorn 
was made in a ferry boat, which often proved dangerous. There 
are now four excellent stone-bridges on the burn, and an ele- 
gant chain-bridge across the river In 1806, no public conveyances 
passed through the parish ; now a mail-coach and two stage- 
coaches pass daily. It were very desirable if we could add, that 
the improvement in the morals and religious feelings of the peo- 
ple was commensurate with their increased social advantages ; but 
it is to be feared, that the tendencies of luxurious enjoyment are 
more adverse than conducive to good morals and religion.

PRESBYTERY OF FORRES, SYNOD OF MORAY. 

THE REV. PETER PARRIES, MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name Boundaries c. — The ancient Gaelic name of this pa- 
rish was Aodincoillie, which signifies the face of the wood. This 
appellation, there can be no doubt, it derived from its general as- 
pect ; for while it contained two-thirds of the royal forest of Dar- 
naway, and the whole of the royal forest of Drummine, the quan- 
tities of oak, fir, hazel, &amp;c. which are still dug up in the peat- 
mosses, afford reason to believe, that the greater part, if not the 
whole of the parish, was covered with wood. This parish is not 



EDENKILLIE. 



179 



unfrequently called Brae- Moray, which is descriptive of its accli- 
vity from the low grounds of Moray, near Forres, on the north, to 
the range of hills to which it extends, and which divides it fronri 
Knockando and Cromdale, on the south. The form of the pa- 
rish is irregular ; its greatest length from north to south is about 
thirteen miles; its greatest breadth from east to west about seven ; 
and it contains about fifty square miles. It is bounded on the 
north by the parish of Dyke, and a narrow portion of RafFord, 
which separates it from Forres ; on the north-east and east by 
Rafford and Dallas ; on the south by Knockando and Cromdale ; 
and on the west by Ardclach, Auldearn, and Dyke. 

Topographical Appearances. — In its general surface, this parish is 
hilly, but not mountainous. The greatest eminence is the Knock 
of Brae- Moray, which is a hill near the southern extremity of the 
parish, of a round form, with a ridge sloping to the north-west, 
and from its summit, which is about 1000 feet above the level of 
the sea, it commands very varied and extensive views. The 
whole of this part of the parish, extending several miles in breadth, 
from Ardclach on the west, all along its southern and eastern 
boundaries, is bleak and moorish, diversified by a few small farms, 
or rather parts of farms, which are under tillage, or were formerly 
under tillage, but now form parts of sheep-walks. From about a 
mile below the Knock, the western side of the parish, comprehend- 
ing fully one-half of its mean breadth, and extending to its north- 
ern extremity on the left bank of the Findhoin, within a mile of 
the elegant suspension bridge over that river, on the toll-road from 
Inverness to Aberdeen, is for the most part under cultivation, or 
covered with wood. From many points, the views of this part of 
the parish are extremely beautiful. The picturesque scenery of 
the pleasure grounds of Relugas, the beautiful valleys of Dun- 
phail, Logie, Sluie, and St John, on the banks of the Divie and 
the Findhorn, with the wood of almost endless variety, which rises 
from the gently sloping or precipitous banks of these rivers, and 
the finely cultivated fields on all sides of the grounds above, in- 
terspersed with clumps of trees of various forms and dimensions, 
present landscapes for richness and beauty, not often to be met 
with, and to which a considerable extent of the Moray Frith, 
which comes within the range of some of them, not a little con- 
tributes. 

Climate. — The 'climate is very different in the two opposite ex- 
tremities of north and south of this parish, even beyond, perhaps, 



180 



ELGINSHIRE. 



what usually occurs in a similar elevation and distance from the 
sea. Surrounded by extensive plantations, under the most ap- 
proved system of farming, within the influence of the mellowing 
breeze from the Moray Frith, and with an elevation not exceed- 
ing 100 feet above it, the district in the vicinity of Darnaway 
Castle, one of the seats of the Earl of Moray and comprehend- 
ing two-thirds of his Lordship's domain lands there, and one-third 
of the extensive nursery grounds and gardens, the atmosphere 
is'remarkably dry, mild, and salubrious. But leaving the forestry, 
and ascending towards the southern extremity of the parish, the 
difference of climate is very perceptible. Here, from the entire 
destitution of wood, and from its proximity to the lofty mountains 
on the south-west, which are yet not so near as to afford shelter 
from the prevailing boisterous winds which blow from that direc - 
tion, the air is sharp and cold ; the winter is often severe and 
of long continuance ; the snow is frequently found covering the 
whole surface to the depth of several inches, and the frost consi- 
derably intense, when the plough is in active operation on the 
lower grounds. On the latter, the grain seed-sowing and harvest 
are often on the eve of being finished, when here they are only 
beginning. At an average, there may be a difference of three 
weeks between them. More rain, too, falls here than on the low 
grounds of Morayshire, and, consequently, the old proverb, "that 
Morayland enjoys forty days more of fair weather, and fifteen days 
more of summer, than any other part of the nation," must be 
taken with especial limitation, as respects the more remote and 
elevated districts of this parish. The air, however, is healthful, 
and no peculiar diseases are known to the inhabitants of any part 
of it. In 1834, when cholera was raging throughout the whole 
length and breadth of the land, and when it committed such fearful 
devastation in Inverness, about twenty-four miles distant, and prov- 
ed fatal tp several of the inhabitants of Nairn, only seven miles off, 
it deserves to be recorded, with feelings of gratitude, that not a 
single case of infection occurred in this parish ; nor even, what is 
more remarkable, as being the only county in Scotland complete- 
ly exempted from it, in any parish in Morayshire. There have 
been many instances in this parish of extraordinary longevity. 
Within the last twelve years, twenty-two individuals were residing 
in it at the same time, above eighty years of age, four of whom 
were ninety-three, one ninety-five, and one ninety-six. When the 
census was taken on the 7th June 1841, there were seventeen in- 
dividuals who were each upwards of eighty years of age.

llie Div, and the Dorback. Of these the principal is the Find- 
horn, which " rises from a wide morass covering the flat summit 
oi a mountain in the midst of the Monad-kadh group" in Inver- 
ness-shire, "and runs" north-east « through a direct hne of coun- 
try not less than sixty miles, its sinuosities being about thirty more," 
and discbarges itself into the Moray Frith, about three miles be- 
low Forres. This river, in its course, runs through Edenkillie 
about seven miles, dividing the Darnaway district, which contains 
nearly one-sixth of its population, from the rest of the parish. The 
Divie has its origin in the hills which have been noticed as form- 
ing part of the southern boundary of the parish, and, with its wind- 
ings, runs about nine miles in a north-westerly direction, when it 
joins the Findhorn. The Dorback flows from the lake Lochen- 
dorb, also forming a part of the southern boundary of the parish, 
and situated about midway betwixt the source of the Divie, and 
where the Findhorn enters this parish. Like the Divie, it has the 
whole of its course within the parish, which is about seven miles, 
when it unites with and loses its name in that river, about three- 
fourths of a mile below the church, and three miles from its junc- 
tion with the Findhorn. The Divie and the Dorback are but of 
small dimensions, yet the former, for an extent of several miles, 
especially after being united with the latter, may almost vie with 
the Findhorn in the wildness, variety, and picturesque descrip- 
tion of its scenery ; nor after extraordinary falls of rain can the 
depth and force of its current be regarded but with mingled emo- 
tions of admiration and alarm. Its capability of doing mischief has 
been often felt ; onestriking instance of which has been well de- 
scribed by the accomplished and talented author of the " Account 
of the Great Floods in the Province of Moray in August 1829." 
Tlie scenery on the Findhorn in its course through this parish, par- 
ticularly deservingof notice,and notinferior to any perhaps through- 
out its whole course, commences at Rannoch or Randolph's Bridge, 
about a quarter of a mile above where the Findhorn is joined bv the 
Divie, and about an equal distance on the east from the house of 
Relugas. From this place, for five or six miles down the stream, 
the scenery is truly magnificent, comprehending all the varieties of 
the wild, the grand, and the picturesque. Some of the finest views 
of that splendid scenery are obtained from various points of the 
very extensive and beautiful pleasure -walks, which were lately 
planned with great taste by the Honourable John Stuart, and are 
now in course of being finished— leading from the castle of Dar-

naway through the forest, and extending for several miles along 
the verge of the left bank of the Findhorn. 

Heronry.-T\ie banks of the Findhorn below Sluie are ren- 
dered remarkable by an extensive heronry which has existed there 
for generations. Some large and ancient oaks growing on the west- 
ern side of the river are covered with the nests of this beautiful 
bird, and a few are lodged in "the high and perpendicular cliffs ot 
sandstone that tower over its stream on the eastern side. It is 
extremely interesting to watch the movements of these creatures 
when they are congregated here for the purpose of breeding; and 
the conflict which is waged with them by the :jackdaws who are 
continually endeavouring furtively to possess themselves of their 
eggs the moment they quit their nests, is often extremely amusing. 

II. — Civil History. 

Land-owners.— i:he principal land-owner is the Earl of Moray. 
The other heritors, taken in the order corresponding with the va- 
lue of their estates, are, Charles Lennox Gumming Bruce, Esq. 
of Roseisle and Kinnaird, M. P. for the county ; Mrs Cumming of 
Logie ; Sir William G. G. Cumming of Altyre and Gordonstone, 
Bart. ; and William Mackilligin, Esq., who purchased the property 
of Belugas from Sir Thomas Dick Lauder of Grange and Foun- 
tainhall, Bart., in 1836. Only two of the heritors at present reside 
in the parish, viz. Mr Cumming Bruce and Mr Mackilligin. 

Parochial Repsters.— These consist of six volumes : 1 . contains 
acts of church discipline, from 3d January 1649 to 3d January 
1676, and registers of baptisms and marriages from 1702 to 1733; 
2. Church discipline and collections for the poor from 1702 to 
1720; 3. Church discipline and collections for the poor from 
1720 to 1764; 4. Register of baptisms from 1733 to 1810, and 
matrimonial contracts from 1741 to 1826, there being an interval 
in the latter from 1765 to 1783 ; 5. Church discipline and coU 
lections, and distributions to the poor from 1764 to 1841 ; 6. 
Register of births and baptisms from 1810, and matrimonial con- 
tracts from 1827 to 1841. From the above, several intervals ap-. 
pear to have occurred, in which no insertions were made in the 
registers of church discipline and matrimonial contracts since these 
began to be kept in this parish ; and the registers of births and 
baptisms, with only one or two brief periods of exception, seem to 
have been very irregularly kept, till about thirty years ago. 

Antiquities.— T\\e Castle of Lochindorb, though a little beyond 
the boundary line which divides Edenkillie from Cromdale, \e 



184 

ELGINSHIRK. 



being situated on an island of a lake of that name, part of which 
IS within this parish, and in the last Statistical Account, as well 
as in other records, having been treated of as belonging to it, some 
notice of it mav be here expected. The remains of this castle 
occupy a space of about eighty square yards, and bear marks of 
liaving been a place of great strength. In 1303, Edward I. of 
-fcngland took possession of it on his way to Inverness, and on his 
return resided here for some time, where, and at Kinloss, he re- 
ceived the submission of the northern parts of the kingdom. In 
1336, it was the residence of Catherine de Beaumont, widow of 
Uivid de Hastings, Earl of Atholl, and " other ladyis that 
were luvely," when it was blockaded by Sir Andrew Moray, 
successor in the Regency of Scotland to Douglas, who was killed 
at Hahdon Hill, but who, on the approach of Edward III. with 
a chosen body of his army, retreated to his castle at Darnaway. 
Of that retreat of Sir Andrew Moray's, Sir Walter Scott, ina 
letter to Sir Thomas Dick Lauder, as stated in a note of that 
gentleman's work already referred to, says, that it was one of the 
finest actions of the period, and most characteristic of Scottish 
generalship. The only farther authentic information we have of 
the Castle of Lochindorb is, that it was left garrisoned by Edward, 
—was the place of imprisonment and death of the celebrated 
William BullocL a favourite of David Bruce, in 1342,— that it 
passed from the Earl of Moray into the hands of Campbell of 
Cawdor in 1606, and has been for at least a century past the pro- 
perty of the Earl of Seafield. 

The Castle of Duniphail is also a fortress of considerable anti- 
quity, though little can be learned either from history or tradition 
respecting it. Its ruins occupy a considerable space of the sum- 
mit of a steep conical hill, only accessible by one side, with a deep 
narrow ravine, of a very romantic description, encompassing three- 
fourths of its base, which is supposed to have been, in ancient 
times, the channel of the Divie, though its present course is 60 
feet lower, and 150 yards to the west. After the battle of " The 
Lost Standard," the castle was besieged by Randolph Earl of 
Moray, the first Regent of Scotland during the minority of David 
Bruce, and gallantly defended by Cumin, the proprietor. In the 
course of that siege, some incidents occurred characteristic at once 
of the bravery and barbarity of the age. Allastair Bane, son of 
Cumin, and a man who had distinguished himself by extraordinary 
deeds of valour, being no longer able to cope with the enemy in 



EDENKILLIE. 



185 



open combat, after the dreadful slaughter of his followers in the 
engagement above alluded to, had recourse to ambuscade and 
stratagem to harass the besieging party, and to supply his father's 
garrison with provision. At length the place of his concealment 
was discovered, which was a deep cavern in a wild narrow glen, 
called Slaginnan, Gallice Slochk-nan-cean, about half a mile from 
the castle, when he was taken by surprise and murdered. His 
head was then cut olf and thrown into the fortress, with this ter- 
rible taunt to the old man, " Your son has provided you with 
meal, and we now send you flesh to eat with it." " It is a bitter 
morsel, indeed," said the veteran warrior, as he took it up, kissed 
it, and wept over it, " but I will gnaw the last bone of it before I 
surrender " The castle and estate of Dunphail some time after- 
wards became the property of Mr Dunbar, and now belongs to 
Mr Gumming Bruce. 

The Doune Hill of Rehigas is described in the last Statistical 
Account as follows: — " It seems to be a fortress of still greater 
antiquity," viz. than the Castle of Lochindorb, " and used as such 
far beyond the period of authentic history. It appears to have 
been a place of strength, to which the inhabitants of the country ' 
retired, with their cattle, upon the invasion of the Danes, to which 
this country of Moray was so frequently exposed. It is a conical 
hill, round a considerable part of which runs the rapid river of 
Divie, in a deep rocky channel ; and, when not defended by the 
river, it is encircled by a deep fosse or ditch, with a strong ram- 
part on the outside, mostly composed of stones, some of which 
have the appearance of vitrification." It is probable that, in the 
early history of the country, the Doune of Relugas was one link 
of a chain of signal stations used for the purpose of communicating 
by fires up the twin glens of the Findhorn and Divie. The Ro- 
mans also seem to have occupied it at one time, for Sir Thomas 
Dick Lauder, by digging, found some fragments of Roman pottery on 
the summit of it, which are still in his possession. They were sup- 
posed tohave had a line of posts from Forres to Brae Mar, and thence 
to Perth, and this was unquestionably one of them ; and in this very 
line, and at no great distance, a spear and two bronze hatchets 
were found on the property of Sluie, which are likewise in the pos- 
session of Sir Thomas. 

Modern Buildings. — The mansion-house of Dunphail, which is 
an elegant edifice, and has been described as one of the happiest

efforts of Mr Playfair's classical taste, was built in 1829. A con- 
siderable addition is now in course of being made, which, when 
completed, will greatly increase the accommodation, without, per- 
haps, detracting from the effect of the original structure. It stands 
on a terrace about 130 yards from the Divie, and 26 feet above it. 
From its south-west front, the eye, after passing over the interven- 
ing lawn, naturally glides along the beautifully wooded western 
bank of that river, and through the vale of the Dorbach, till the 
view is terminated by the summit of the Knock. About 170 yards 
from its north-east front rises the nearer of two tiers of terraces, 
at the northern extremity of the higher and more distant of which 
IS the hill on whose summit the old castle stands, and which ap- 
pears over the tops of the intervening trees and shrubberies, and 
between the wood of the adjacent banks, " majestic in ruins." On 
the higher of these terraces, which stretches from the southern 
base of the castle-hill, is the garden, which is most tastefully and 
elegantly laid out, as are the whole of the flower-plots and shrub- 
beries which ornament that beautiful valley. The dreadful ra- 
vages committed there by the floods of 1829 have been amply re- 
paired ; and, from the immense strength of the embankments 
which have been made, no encroachments of the river in that 
quarter, at least beyond the flat fields on its right bank, may any 
longer be apprehended. 

The House of Relugas was considerably enlarged and improved, 
about fourteen years ago, by an addition consisting of a very hand- 
some suite of apartments, 96 feet in length, with an arched vesti- 
bule projecting from the centre. The house presents a most 
beautiful picturesque appearance from various directions, and ad- 
mirably harmonizes with the delightfully romantic scenery of its 
pleasure-grounds, and the surrounding country. 

The mansion-house of Logie stands at the northern extremity 
of the valley of that name, on the right bank of the Findhorn ; but 
no alterations have been made on it, deserving of notice, since the 
last Statistical Account was published. 

A very handsome shooting lodge, consisting of eight apartments, 
belonging to the Honourable John Stuart, and generally occupied 
by him and other members of the Noble family of Moray for se- 
veral weeks of the shooting season, was erected three or four years 
ago at the north-west base of the Knock, on the right bank of the 
Dorbach, and about three miles above its junction with the Divie.

1831, . - - - - 1300 

1841, ----- 1234 

By the writer of the last Statistical Account of this parish, pub- 
lished in 1793, the great increase of the population to that period 
from 1775, is ascribed to " a good deal of the waste land in the 
remoter parts of the parish having been lately brought into cul- 
ture by families settling in these wilder parts." The subsequent 
much greater decrease from 1793 to 1801, amounting to more 
than a third part of the whole population, at the former of these 
periods, appears to have been owing to the extension of farms, 
and the consequent removal not only of many of the former te- 
nants and their families, but also of the cottaofers and their fami- 
lies, who had been very numerous on some of the properties be- 
fore these changes were effected. The apparent increase again 
from 1821 to 1831, may be accounted for from a number of ma- 
sons and labourers employed in building bridges, and in making 
the new line of road from Pitnisk to Dava, and other improvements 
that were then going on in the parish, who did not properly be- 
long to it ; but were included in the census taken at the latter of 
these periods.

Character and Habits of the People.— The practice of illegal 
distillation, which prevailed to a considerable extent within the 
last twenty years, amongst the minor tenants of the upper districts 
of the parish, was attended with all its usual pernicious effects on 
the inhabitants. Since their means of support, and of payino- 
their rents from that source, have entirely ceased, a manifest im- 
provement has taken place, both with respect to their pecuniary 
circumstances and moral character. A due attention to their 



18S 



ELGINSHIRE, 



farms, which were formerly neglected, has more than compen- 
sated for any pecuniary loss that might at first be sustained by 
the suppression of smuggling ; and instances of intemperance 
and open profanation of the Sabbath, are now of rare occur- 
rence. A great improvement has also taken place in their attend- 
ance on religious ordinances. The practice of announcing sales, 
&amp;c. by a crier, in the church-yard, upon the congregation retir- 
ing from church, has been quite discontinued ; and there have not 
been more than two instances of funerals on Sabbath for the last 
five years. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Economy. — 

The number of acres, standard imperial measure, which are either cultivated 

or occasionally in tillage, . . , 3 331 

The number of acres that never have been cultivated, supposed to be about 25,000 
acres in a state of undivided common, • . ' q 

acres under wood, • • . . 4,7'0 

More than one-half of the land under wood belongs to the 
Earl of Moray j two-thirds of the forest of Darnaway, as has been 
already stated, being in this parish, which consists of oak, ash, 
beech, elm, sycamore, Spanish chestnut, larch, spruce-fir, Scotch 
fir, mountain-ash, poplars, birches, gean-trees, hollies, alders, &amp;c. 
In the course of the last twelve years, a large quantity of the wood 
which had arrived at maturity in the forest has been cut down, 
and the vacant ground has been filled up by young plantations, 
consisting chiefly of oak, to the number of about 100,000 annu- 
ally, on which all due care is bestowed in the way of drainino-, 
pruning, and fencing. The young plants are raised from seed on 
the nursery grounds at Darnaway. At three years old, they are 
planted out in pits previously prepared by mixing a small quan- 
tity of lime with the earth in the bottom, which is said to promote 
their growth, so as to make as much progress the first year as 
they generally do in two years, when planted in the usual way. 
The proportion of the other properties under wood is nearly as 
follows: Dunphail, 800 acres ; Logic, 573; Altyre, 400; Belu- 
gas, 547. The Scotch firs are greatly improved in quality, and 
their growth promoted, by procuring the seed from the natural 
wood grown in Strathspey. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of land under cultivation is 
about 16s. per annum the imperial acre. 

Breed of Live- Stock.— The black-cattle reared are chieflv of 
the Highland breed ; but about 100 two years old, of a larger 



EDENKILLIE. 



189 



size, are purchased in autumn, fed upon turnip, and sold the fol- 
lowing summer to cattle-dealers, who purchase them for the south- 
ern markets. The sheep, consisting of about 2500, are of the 
black-faced kind, with the exception of about 250 of the Cheviot 
breed, which are purchased in September, and fattened upon tur- 
nip for the butcher, or partly fed with turnip, and sold with their 
lambs the succeeding year. 

Fishings. — There is a considerable salmon -fishing within the 
parish, at Sluie, upon the Findhorn, the property of the Earl of 
Moray. Four men are employed there to fish, with a boat and 
draught nets, the Sluie pool, and two other pools near to it, with 
two or three more, considerably farther down the river. Before 
salmon-fishing nearer the sea was so well understood as it is now, 
the fishing at Sluie was of great celebrity. It appears by a letter 
dated 7th June 1648, from the Earl of Moray to his Countess, 
that " in one night, on the Pool of Sluie alone, 1300 salmon 
were taken ; and at one draught, six-and-twenty scores." About 
thirty-six years ago, 3G0 salmon were caught in the same pool on 
one day. But the number now taken, in all the pools connected 
with the net- fishing there, does not average above 700 yearly. It is 
let to Messrs Hogarth and Co. at an yearly rent of L.50, the right 
of angling being reserved to himself by the Noble proprietor, 
which some years ago was let by the Company at L.20 per annum. 
At the Ess, or fall, which is about six feet in height, and half a 
mile above Sluie, a man is employed by the Company to fish with 
an instrument here called a clip which has a handle ten feet in 
length, and two or three crooked prongs. The man placing him- 
self upon a rock immediately below the fall, and holding his clip 
about six inches under water, and eight or ten inches from the 
rock where he is seated, watches the opportunity of the fish being 
driven to the water's edge by the force of the fall, and by a sud- 
den jerk with his instrument, seldom fails to place it on the rock 
beside him. 

The Findhorn affords excellent sport to anglers, both of salmon 
and trout. A considerable variety of the latter kind of fish is caught 
in the Divie and Dorbach, especially after falls of rain. 

Produce. — The average amount and value of gross produce, 
yearly raised in the parish, may be nearly as follows : 

Oats, 1257 imperial acres, at L.3 10 0 per acre, L.4399 10 0

Husbandry. — When the last Statistical Account was published, 
farming seems to have been in a very backward state in this pa- 
rish. Since then, hundreds of acres of land, which had been lying 
waste and useless, have been brought under cultivation, with an 
ample return of profit; and the land previously in culture, by 
means of draining, cleaning, the application of lime, and a regu- 
lar rotation of cropping, has been rendered, in many instances, 
worth more than double its former value. Lime, of which little 
or none had been used at the former period, is now had recourse 
to almost universally. It is procured from Cothall limekilns, the 
property of Sir William G. G. Gumming, Bart., in the parish of 
Forres, about six miles distant from the centre of this parish ; or 
from the sea-port of Findhorn, about fourteen miles off, where it is 
imported from England. About seventeen bolls are generally 
given to the imperial acre, which are supposed to be fully equal 
in the effects it produces on the land here, to a third more on the 
low grounds of Morayshire nearer the sea. 

The commencement of agricultural improvements in the upper 
districts may be dated from about the beginning of the present 
century, when Mr Alexander Wilson, late tenant at Gervally, was 
brought from Berwickshire by Mr Cumin of Regulas to this parish. 
His merits as an agriculturist have been recognized in a manner 
which must have been highly gratifying to his surviving family, as it 
was honourable to themselves, by five extensive and most respect- 
able proprietors, who erected a marble tablet to his memory in the 
churchyard of Edenkillie, where his remains were deposited, in 
order, as the inscription on it bears, " to mark the sense they en- 
tertain of his zeal and fidelity in the management and improve- 
ment of the estates in this neighbourhood." 

While the spirit of improvement, of late years, has been evinced 
in a greater or less degree on all the properties, it is no more than 
justice to state, that the improvements, both of an useful and or- 
namental kind, which have been making on Dunphail, the proper- 
ty of Mr Gumming Bruce, especially on that part of it, of which 



EDENKILLIE. 



191 



there is a considerable portion now in bis own bunds, bold a dis- 
tinguished place. Mucb waste land bas been reclaimed, and more 
in course of being so. The most approved system of farming bas 
been adopted. Fields have been enclosed, generally with sunk 
fences feced with stone, along the tops of which are planted rows 
of forest trees, or hedge-rows of thorn or beech. 

The mode of drying land by wedge drains, according to the plan 
recommended by Mr Smith of Deanston, has been practised to a 
very considerable extent ; and the subsoil-plough, which Mr Gum- 
ming Bruce introduced two years ago, promises to form another 
era in the improvement of agriculture in this parish. 

Manufactures— There are three corn-mills in the parish, viz. 
the Dunphail, the Logie, and Half-davoch. The Dunphail mills 
include an oat-mill, one for barley, one for sawing timber, a 
thrashing-mill, and till lately there was a carding-mill, all under 
the same roof, and wrought by the same stream of water. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Markets, Means of Communication, — The nearest market- 
town is Forres, at the distance of eight miles and three-quarters 
from the parish church. Nairn is fourteen miles, and Grantowu 
thirteen miles, from the same place. At Forres, is also the near- 
est post-office; but runners carrying the mail bag betwixt Forres 
and Grantown, which is conveyed in a gig from the latter place to 
Aviemore, one of the stages on the Highland road from Inverness 
to Perth, pass twice a day along the road extending throughout 
the whole length of the parish on the east of the river Findhorii. 
Several carriers pass weekly along the same road. The turnpike 
road within the parish on the above line, nine miles of which were 
made about ten years ago, is eleven miles in length ; and three 
more by the old route from Forres to Grantown. From the turn- 
pike road, about half a mile above the church, there is a parish 
road by the bridge of Dalt-lich, across the Findhorn, and through 
the forest of Darnaway, to the toll-road between Inverness and 
Aberdeen. Besides these, from ten to twelve miles of roads have 
been made by Sir William Gumming on his property within the 
parish ; which, with roads of several miles in length made by Mr 
Gumming Bruce, afford excellent means of communication to al- 
most every part of the parish. There are three toll-bars within 
the parish; but travellers passing along the whole length of the 
toll-road pay only at two of them. 

Bridges. — By the floods of 1829, two substantial stone bridges

over the Divie and the Dorbach, about sixty yards above their 
junction, were swept completely away. Tliese devastations, how- 
ever, were, in 1831, fully remedied by a very handsome bridge 
built across the Divie, near the church, on the new turupike road ; 
and by one built at the same time over the Dorbach, in a very ro- 
mantic situation, about half a mile above where the old one stood, 
on the parish road already mentioned, by the bridge of Dalt-lich 
Both of these bridges have their arches built of granite, and spring, 
ing from rocks on each side. 

Ecdesiasiical State.— The church is situated on the right bank 
of.the Divie, not, as is marked on almost every map the writer has 
seen, to the east of the Knock, but two miles nearly due north of 
it; and is as central and convenient as might be for the general 
population, though at the distance of nine and a-half miles from 
one extremity of the parish. It was built in 1 741, was new seated, 
and underwent some other improvements in 1813. Thouoh com- 
fortable enough within, it is of a very mean exterior, and much 
requires that something should be done at once to preserve the 
building, and to improve its appearance. It is seated to contain 
500 persons, which is sufficient for the population, especially as 
those residing in the Darnaway, or Conicaval district, from their 
great distance, are unable regularly to attend their parish church. 
The number of communicants in the parish is about 140, sixty 
of whom are male heads of families ; and from twenty to thirty 
from other parishes, join them in partaking of the ordinance of 
the supper, at its annual dispensation in the parish. 

The manse was built in 1823. It is a neat and handsome- 
looking building, in the cottage style, and in good repair. It is sup- 
plied with excellent water, conveyed by leaden pipes from a spring 
160 yards distant; and which cost the last incumbent upwards of 
L. 40. The glebe, including the garden, shrubberies, and the site 
of the manse, and offices, contains ten imperial acres, and is worth 
L. 12 per annum. The stipend is L.123, 6s. lOd. ; 46 bolls 2 
pecks, i lippie of barley ; 4 bolls, 1 firlot, 2 pecks, i lippie'of 
oatmeal ; 1 firlot, 1 lippie of oats, according to the old mea- 
sure of the county. The average annual amount of money and 
victual stipend is about L. 1 85. 

The number of fimiilies in the parish belonging to the Establish- 
ed church is, 269 ; number of Seceding or Dissenting families, 17 • 
Episcopalian, 1. With the exception of only two of the families in 
the parish belonging to Seceding or Dissenting congregations, there

is none of their houses within less than seven and a-half miles from 
the parish church. Their places of worship are Forres, and Bog- 
hole in the parish of Auldearn. 

Education. — There are five schools in the parish, exclusive of five 
Sabbath schools, viz, the parochial school; one at Conicaval, and one 
at Tullydivie, both of which are supported by the Society for Pro- 
pagating Christian Knowledge: one female school at Half-davoch, 
on the property of Sir William Gumming, who allows to the teach- 
er a salary of L.5 per annum ; and one female school at the Knock, 
on the teacher's own adventure. The parish school, and the 
schools supported by the Society for Propagating Christian Know- 
ledge, are each attended by about 100 scholars in the course of 
the year. The number present at all the schools, at the annual 
examination by the presbytery last spring, was as follows : parochi- 
al school, 60 ; Conicaval, 60 ; Tullydivie, 54 ; Half-davoch, 36 ; 
the Knock, 30. About one-half of the number of scholars attend- 
ing the school at Conicaval is from the parish of Dyke ; and 
about 8 from RafFord of those attending the school at Half-davoch. 
The salary of the parish schoolmaster is the maximum, L. 34, 4s. 
4|d. : the school fees amount to about L.16 per annum ; and the 
Trustees of the late Mr Dick's bequest to the parochial teachers 
of the counties of Aberdeen, Banff, and Moray, have allowed 
to the schoolmaster of this parish, for the present year, L. 38, 5s. 
Id., which allowance may be expected to be continued so long as 
the teacher shall act in conformity to the regulations, and merit 
the approbation of the trustees. 

Library. — There is a parish library consisting of 160 volumes, 
chiefly of religious works. It is supported by a contribution of Is. 
per annum from each of the subscribers, of whom there are at pre- 
sent about 40. 

Savings Bank. — A savings bank was instituted here last year, 
in connection with the Forres and Nairn Savings Bank ; and, from 
the manner in which a considerable number have already availed 
themselves of it, it promises to be highly useful. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The regular number on the poor's 
list is about 34, and the number who receive occasional aid is about 

• From the last Statistical Account it appears that there is a claim for three schools 
in this parish from the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge, in consequence 
of a donation by Dr Cumin, son of James Cumin, Esq. of Relugas. This gentle- 
man was physician to King William III. at the battle of the Boyne, in 1690. In 
1714, he sent the sum of L.261, 13s. 7d. Sterling to the Society, with a recommen- 
dation that they should keep always three schools in this parish.

8. The church collections for the poor, for the last seven years, 
have averaged about L.29 ; which, along with donations from the 
heritors of about L. 10 per annum, after deducting L. 4, 10s. to 
the session-clerk, precentor, and beadle, are distributed regularly, 
three times a year, by the kirk -session, according to the compara- 
tive degrees of need of the applicants, and varying from 12s. to 
L.1, 7s. per annum to each. These sums are very inadequate as 
means of efficient relief. But the deficiency is in a good measure 
supplied by the beneficence of the heritors to the poor on their re- 
spective properties ; of which an excellent example is set by the 
Earl of Moray, who allows to a considerable number one peck of 
meal each, or Is. per week. Several aged and infirm individuals 
on the property of Mr Gumming Bruce are not only supplied with 
soup, twice a-week, from the kitchen at Dunphail, but have also, 
along with others, meal regularly, and occasionally blankets and 
clothing, bestowed on them by him and his lady. The poor on 
the estate of Logie still continue to be remembered by the pro- 
prietress and her family, though now residing at a distance from 
the parish, with all their characteristic liberality and kindness. 
Nor would it be proper to omit to notice in this statement of good 
offices to the poor, the readiness of the people themselves to con- 
tribute to the aid of the necessitous, whether residing in their im- 
mediate neighbourhood, or when application is made to them from 
other quarters. In the course of the severe winter preceding last, 
unaided by any of the heritors, save a small contribution from one 
of them, they raised among themselves in meal and money about 
L. 17 for behoof of the poor of the parish. The collections in 
church in aid of the schemes recommended by the General As- 
sembly average from L. 6 to L. 7 annually. 

Inns. — There are two small inns in the parish for the accommo- 
dation of travellers. To these there can be no objections when 
used only for their proper purpose. But it is matter of regret, for 
obvious reasons, that toll-keepers should be allowed to convert 
their houses into dram-shops. 

Fuel. — The fuel generally used is peat, of which a plentiful 
supply, in favourable seasons, is obtained from the mosses in dif- 
ferent parts of the parish. Coals are brought from the sea-port of 
Findhorn, where they are imported from England,

PRESBYTERY OF FORRES, SYNOD OF MORAY. 

THE REV. WILLIAM TULLOCH. MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, 8c. — The name of this parish is derived from two Gaelic 
words, dale, a vale or plain, and uis, contracted from uisge, water. 

The parish was formerly a parsonage, dedicated to St Michael, 
and the seat of the sub-dean. Sir William Gordon Gordon Gum- 
ming of Altyre and Gordonston, Baronet, is patron. Upon the 
annexation of Altyre part of this parish to the parish of RafFord, 
Easter Kelles, church lands, for above an hundred years the he- 
ritage of Farquharson of Kelles, a family now extinct, was annexed 
to this parish in 1657; and the disjunction and annexation were 
ratified in Parliament in 1661. 

The barony of Dallas had been long the property of Gumming 
of Altyre, before it was sold to Sir Ludovick Gordon of Gordon- 
ston, in the end of the last century ; but the Gummings of Altyre 
have again become heirs to it. 

Extent and Boundaries. — This parish is, in shape, like an oblate 
spheroid. It is about 15 miles long, and 9 in breadth. It is 
bounded on the south-east and east, by Rothes and Birnie ; on 
the north-east and north, by Elgin ; on the north-west and west, 
by Rafford and Edenkillie ; and on the south-west and south, by 
Knockando. 

Topographical Appearances. — The parish is considerably di- 
versified with rising grounds, and beautiful straths lying between 
the hills, the principal of which runs through the length of the 
parish along the river. These hills are in general highly culti- 
vated, and yield rich and luxuriant crops. They are nearly all 
covered with heath, and in many places the banks of the river are 
skirted with alder wood, the bark of which many of the people use 
for dyeing black. The hill of Melundy, the property of Sir Wil- 
liam G. Gordon Gumming, has been lately replanted with silver- 
fir, spruce-fir, larch, and birch ; and part of the hill of Wangle, 



196 



ELGINSHIRE. 



the property of Sir William G. Gordon Gumming is also covered 
with natural oak, and the rest of it he lately planted with fir and 
larch. 

There is another thriving plantation of fir and larch joining 
that of Melundy, on the estate of Craigmill, the property of James 
Will iam Grant, Esq. of Elches, and formerly of the Cummines, 
who sold it to the Grants about the year 1752. There are, be- 
sides, several small plantations in the parish. 

Meteorology. — The climate may, in general, be considered very 
healthy ; the inhabitants have seldom been visited by any epide- 
mic ; but, as the parish is more elevated than the lower parts of 
Moray, it is much colder, frequently the harvest being nearly 
completed in the low country, before it is well begun here. The 
south wind, which is the most prevalent, blows down the vale with 
great fury, for the greater part of winter and spring, often tearing 
up trees by the root. The north side of the strath is much warmer 
than any other part of the parish, and is sheltered by the sur- 
rounding hills from the north wind. 

Hydrography.— T[\e parish is supplied with many excellent 
springs of different qualities, some of which are strongly impreg- 
nated with iron. There is an excellent spring, which passes 
through gravel and rock of a very soft nature, which had been a 
favourite well, and dedicated to St Michael, the patron saint of 
the parish. 

There are several lochs in the parish, the principal' of which 
are, Loch Dallas, Loch Noir, or Grass Loch, Loch Trevie, which 
is the source of the Lossie, and the Loch of Rheninver; in all of 
which, there is abundance of excellent trout. 

There are small burns rising among the hills, all of which 
are tributary to the Lossie. The principal of these are, the 
Black Burn, the Dorral, the Burn of Auchness, the Burn of 
Auldnachuirn, or Cart Bum, so called on account of the people 
f the country making their carts of the wood which grows on its 
banks, the Burn of Aulderg, or Red Burn, so called because the 
water is coloured with a red kind of clay, through which it passes ; 
the Burn of Auldnacuish, or Fir Burn ; and the Burn of Glen 
Latterach, or Angry Burn. The latter, which, in time of rain, is 
very impetuous, divides Birnie from Dallas. On it, there is a 
beautiful waterfall, called the Ess of Glen Latterach, which has a 
grand appearance when the burn is swollen. It rises among the 
hills, about two miles above the fall. It dashes over a precipice 



DALLAS, 



197 



about fifty feet in height, and falls into a basin, which the country 
people call the Kettle ; a little farther down it falls into another 
basin, which they call the Pot. The rocks surrounding it are stu- 
pendous, rising almost perpendicular to more than 100 feet in 
height Nothing is wanting but trees hanging over their summits 
to render the scene sublime. There is another beautiful little 
cascade, on the Burn of Auchness. 

The Lossie, the only river in the parish, rises in Loch Trevie, 
about eight miles above the church, and meanders along the whole 
length of the parish, when, at the north-east end, it dashes over 
a rock thirty feet high ; it is surrounded by scenery at once the 
most enchanting and grand, and after passing through the pa- 
rishes of Birnie, Elgin, and Drainie, flows into the Moray Frith 
at the sea-port town of Lossiemouth. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — In this parish, there are several spe- 
cies of rock, the principal of which are granite, felspar, mica, sand- 
stone, slate, and gravel. The variety of the soil is considerable 
along the banks of the river; it generally consists of light loam on 
a gravelly bottom, — higher up, of a black soil and a till bottom ; 
and towards the southern extremity of the parish, it chiefly con- 
sists of moor and moss, in the latter of which there are found 
fir-roots, and trees of an immense size, several feet deep, some of 
which have been burnt, the charcoal remaining fresh to this day. 
There are several freestone and grey slate quarries of a very good 
quality in this parish. 

Zoology. — The extensive range of moor affords excellent shelter 
for game; the principal kinds of which are black-cock T. tetrix, 
woodcock Scolopaxrnsticola, moor-cock, wild-duck was boschas, 
pheasant [Phasianus Colchicus. There are a great variety of other 
kinds of birds, among which may be mentioned the swallow, the 
sparrow [Fringilla domestica, the sparrow-hawk jF. nisus, the 
hooded-crow C comix, the rook [Corvus frugilegus , the raven, 
the magpie C, Pica, the owl [Strix, the wood and tame pigeon 
Colamba Palumbus, and C. Livia, the corn-crake {Gallinula 
crex, and the sea-gull Larus canus, which comes annually from 
the sea coast to hatch in the lochs before-mentioned. 

IL — Civil History. 
Land-owners. — There are threeheritors, all having lands in other 
parishes, viz. Sir William G. Gordon Cumming of Altyre, Bart., 
the Earl of Fife, and James William Grant, Esq. of Wester 
Elches. 



198 



ELGINSHIRE. 



Antiquities.— k castle, of which the ruins remain, and which is 
named the Castle of Dallas, or Torcastle, was built by Sir Thomas 
Gumming of Altyre, anno 1400. It was formerly the stronghold of 
the Cummings, the ancestors of the present proprietor. It is situat- 
ed on a plain at the foot of the hill of the Wangie, on the side of 
the Dorral burn, about a mile from the church, on the north bank 
of the Lossie. The vestiges of out-works and a moat are still to 
be seen. In the centre of the church-yard, there still remains en- 
tire a cross, where the people were once accustomed to hold their 
markets on Sunday. It is twelve feet high, consisting of one stone 
set on a stone pedestal, about three feet and a half square, and its 
capital a fleur-de-lis. The stone weather-beaten effigy of St 
Michael, mentioned in the last Statistical Account, now lies in a 
mutilated state at the foot of the cross. There is also a laro-e 
oblong stone at the east end of the parish, which stands on the 
site of an old Roman Catholic chapel and burying-ground. 

III. — Population. 

In the year 1770, the population amounted to 700 
1778, . . 917 

1788, . 888 

1811, . . 871 

1831, . 1153 

1841, . . 1179 

The greater part of the population are employed as farmers, 
crofters, labourers, and farm-servants. There are also masons, 
weavers, blacksmiths, carpenters, grain-millers, carding-millers, 
tailors, shoemakers, cartwrights, sawyers, fleshers, merchants, 
&amp;c. Not many years ago, the Gaelic language was spoken by the 
whole people of the parish, and most of the places still retain 
Gaelic names. There are not, however, now above twelve per- 
sons in the parish who understand that language, A very great 
change has taken place in the dress of the common people : all 
the females, with very few exceptions, wear bonnets now, whereas 
twenty years ago, only about three were to be seen in church. 
The males were accustomed to appear in church with clothes 
made of homespun grey ; but now, the most of them are provided 
with a suit of broad-cloth, for kirk and market. 

The parishioners of Dallas are exceedingly kind and hospita- 
ble. They are also most industrious and persevering. The waste 
lands given them gratis for a limited number of years, are in a 
short time turned from barren moor into fertile fields. 

Smuggling, which so greatly prevailed throughout the Avhole

parish, is now entirely suppressed ; and the effects of the change are 
very remarkable on the manners, comforts, and happiness ot ttie 
people. 

IV. — Industry. 

Rent of Land.— The average rent of land is from L.l, 10s. to 
L.2 per acre, and the duration of leases nineteen years. 

Waffes, Sfc— The farm men-servants receive half yearly from 
L.4 to L.6; women from L.l, lOs. to L.2 ; day-labourers, Is. 4d. ; 
women, 6d. per day, with victuals ; masons, 2s. 6d. ; carpenters, 
2s. 4d.; tailors. Is. 4d. with victuals; for cutting peats, men re- 
ceive Is. 4d., and women 8d. per day, with victuals. 

v.— Parochial Economy. 

Market-Towns.— There are no market-towns withui the pa- 
rish ; the nearest are Forres and Elgin, the former nine miles from 
the centre of the parish, and the latter twelve. 

There is only one small village in the parish ; it is situated 
on the north bank of the Lossie, distant from the church about 
two furlongs. It was feued about forty-three years ago by Sir 
Alexander'' Penrose Gumming. It contains thirty-two houses. 

Means of Commimication.— As there is no post-office in the pa- 
rish, the letters to the east district, called Kelles, are left at El- 
gin ; and those to the west district, at Forres. The county roads 
to Elgin and Forres are in good repair. Many of the other roads 
however, are in a bad condition. There is a new road now form- 
ed called " the Knockando road." It extends from Forres to the 
Spey, and will be of the greatest advantage to those tenants who 
inhabit the more hilly districts of the parish, where there is no road 
save the one alluded to. 

The flood of 1829 carried away the only bridge then in parish : 
it was|upon the Lossie ; and the want of it, when the river is swol- 
len, which is very often the case, prevents nearly one-third of 
the population from attending church ; but there is a bridge of 
three arches to be built immediately upon the Lossie, a little below 
the church. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church of Dallas, the only place of 
worship in the parish, is situated very near the centre of the pa- 
rish. It is distant from the nearest boundary about four miles and 
a half, and from the farthest, six. It was built in 1794, but was 
never finished nor taken off the workman's hands. The walls are 
neither plastered, nor the roof ceiled, and it is therefore in a very 
uncomfortable condition. It accommodates only 400 sitters, and a 



200 



ELGINSHIRE. 



loft is required for 200 more. The sittings in the church are all free, 
and divided among the tenants ; but, as the villagers are not includ- 
ed, a loft was fitted up for their accommodation by Sir William G. 
G. Gumming ; but it is not sufficient to hold one-third of them. The 
manse, which was built in 1783, is situated a little lo the north-west 
of the church, at the top of a beautifully inclined plain sloping to- 
wards the Lossie. It is in very bad repair, and, owing to the mi- 
serable state of the interior, a new one is required immediately. 
The extent of the glebe, including the garden and lawn before the 
house, is about ten acres : its value about L. 12. The whole of 
the stipend, including money for communion elements, amounts to 
L.158, 6s. 8d. all paid in money, part of which is derived from the 
vicarage of Auldearn parish 

The Protestant ministers of the parish were the following : Mr 
William Thomson, reader in Dollas, anno 1567. John Clark, 
reader in Altyre and Dollas, annol 56. William Paterson, mi- 
nister and sub-dean, anno 1574. Alexander Richardson, minister 
in 161 1 and 1617. George Gumming, ordained about 1624, died in 
summer 1648. James Strachan, ordained in winter 1649, died in 
October 1671. Alexander Gumming, ordained June 13, 1672, 
demitted in 1681 for the test. George Dunbar, ordained 13th 
October 1681, transported to Nairn in 1687. Thomas Ur- 
quhart, privately ordained, was admitted 11th January 1688, and 
died about 1706. John Grockat, ordained 9th May 1708, died 
22d April 1748. Robert Dalrymple, ordained 23d February 
1749, deposed in May 1763. James Hay, ordained 27th Sep- 
tember 1763, died 20th October 1777. David Milne, admitted 
7th July 1778, translated to Edenkiilie 27th June 1793. Richard 
Rose, admitted 1 St May 1794, translated to Drainie 23d July 
1816. Francis Will iam Grant, admitted 26th September 1816, 
translated to Banff 16th December 1821. William TuUoch, ad- 
mitted 11th Apr, 11822. 

The whole population, with very few exceptions, is connected 
with the Established Ghurch. Pubhc worship is, in general, well 
attended. About 400 or 500 attend every Sabbath, except when 
the river cannot be forded. There are 170 communicants, of 
whom 70 are male heads of families, all well affected to the Es- 
tablished Church. As a proof of this, it may be observed, that pe- 
titions were sent to both Houses of Parliament, signed by above 
200 male inhabitants of the parish, praying for the support and 
extension of the Ghurch of Scotland. The sacrament of the

Lord's Supper is regularly dispensed once a year; and diets of ca- 
techising for the old and young are held in the spring of the year. 

Edzication.There are four schools in the parish, viz. a paro- 
chial school, an endowed school, and two female unendowed schools. 
The salary of the parochial schoolmaster is L. 34, 4s. 4|d. : he 
has also a share of the Dick bequest, which amounts to L. 28, 
3s. 3d., and about L. 12 of school-fees; which in all amount to 
L.74, 7s. 7d. Sterling. The parochial school-house has lately 
undergone great repairs ; and an elegant class-room on a new plan 
has been built separate from the dwelling-house, to accommodate 
more than an hundred scholars. The endowed school is situated 
in the east end of the parish, on the lands of the Earl of Fife, 
for behoof of the children on his estate. The schoolmaster has 
L.3 per annum, a free house, and garden. Latin is not taught in 
it. In the female schools are taught reading, knitting, and sew- 
ing. The fees in these schools amount only to L. 5 or L. 6 per 
annum. There is also a Sabbath school in the parish, which is 
well attended. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — There are at present 24 poor on 
the roll ; but none of them depend altogether upon the collections. 
The distribution of the funds takes place twice a year. The 
amount of collections from January 1839 to January 1840, was 
L.16, 14s. 6d. Sterling. 

Jnns. — There are three public -houses in the village, and one in 
Kelles. One would be quite sufficient in the village. 

PKel. — The people use very little coals, on account of the inex- 
haustible fund of moss which is in the parish. 

MiSCFXLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. 

Since the last Statistical Account was published, very great 
changes have taken place in the parish ; the most striking of which 
are, the erection of the village ; the improvement of the roads 
leading to Forres, Elgin, and Knockando ; the attention paid to 
the cultivation of the land and the rearing of cattle ; the quantity 
of moorland taken in : and a decided improvement in the moral 
and religious habits of the people, since the suppression of smug- 
gling.

PRESBYTERY OF FORRES, SYNOD OF MORAY. 

THE REV. WILLIAM ROBERTSON, A. M. MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name and Boundaries. — Tradition bocars, that DufF Mac Mal- 
colm, King of Scotland, having been assassinated in the Castle of 
Forres, his body was for a short time concealed under a bridge in 
this parish, and its name, as if commemorating this tragical event, 
is by the less educated classes in the surrounding districts written 
not unfrequently Kingloss. There is every reason to disbelieve 
this legend of the twelfth century. The name seems to be a com- 
pound of the two Celtic words cmn-locli, pronounced Kinloch, the 
form in which it actually appears in a charter of endowment of 
lands granted to the abbey by King William, and which accurate- 
ly points out its locality, the abbey being situated at the head of 
the bay. The parish is bounded on the north, by the Moray 
frith ; on the south, by the parishes of RafFord and Forres ; on 
the west, by the river Findhorn ; and on the east, by the parish of 
Alves. 

Topographical Appearances. — In figure it is nearly square, the 
side between three and four miles in extent. Viewed at its south- 
ern boundary, on the turnpike road leading from Aberdeen to In- 
verness, about three miles east of Forres, where the land is some- 
what elevated, it has a flat champaign appearance, offering little of a 
picturesque description, but a great deal on which the eye of the 
philanthropist may look with satisfaction. The first object that 
attracts notice is Grangehall, with its thriving plantations. Then 
are seen the ruins of the abbey, the church and manse of modern 
date, and Seapark House with its policies. Fertile well cultivated 
fields, studded with farm-houses, adapted, some of them for the ac- 
commodation of genteel families, and all neat and comfortable, ap- 
pear on every side ; whilst in the back ground, Findhorn displays its

masts, with the commercial flag waving in the breeze; and the ocean 
rolls its waters into a bay, at full tide, more than seven miles m 
circumference. The scene altogether suggests the idea of health, 

peace, and plenty. .... 

The line of coast, which extends east about four miles, is uni- 
formly low, excepting the mounds of drifted sand, which extend 
aloncr, and often change their position by the action of the wind 
and tide. Behind these sandy hillocks, runs a bleak bank of coarse 
shingle, about one-fourth of a mile broad. That the land once 
projected out where the bar now is, cannot be doubted ; but be- 
ing low, as well as loose and pliable, it is not at all surprising that 
it should have yielded to the impetuosity of the sea, which, al- 
though now more eff"ectually opposed by this gravelly ridge, pre- 
sents as much as ever the appearance of an ambitious adversary 
still aiming at new conquests. In proof of this, it may be mention- 
ed, that the present town of Findhorn is the third that has borne 
the name. The first stood about a mile west of the bar, the point 
at which the river originally had its confluence with the Frith, un- 
til those tumuli called the Sandy Hills, by whatever impulse set in 
motion, drove it, in their progress eastward, into the channel it now 
occupies. The founders of the second took up a position a little 
to the north of the present village, where they doubtless imagined 
it would be safe ; but in the course of time, the advancing ocean 
reached their. habitations also, and swept them into its watery bed. 
Nor is the existing town free from the risk of being overtaken, par- 
tially at least, by a similar catastrophe. The little space that in- 
tervenes between tide-mark and the north end, is a broken bank 
of sand, that drifts dreadfully with every hurricane, covering the 
streets and gardens to the depth sometimes of eight or ten feet : 
and this constitutes but a feeble bulwark against the tremendous 
surf that beats with a north-easterly swell ; so that if means be not 
taken to give it a solid surface, either by laying it over with turf, 
or planting it with bent, there is reason to apprehend that it will 
by and bye be blown away altogether, leaving Findhorn that now 
is to share at some future period the fate of its predecessors. 

Hydrography/. — The only river in the parish is the Findhorn or 
Erne, which, taking its rise in the mountains near Badenoch, and 
winding through the counties of Inverness and Nairn by a course 
of about sixty miles from south-west to north-east, amid some of 
the most romantic scenery in Scotland, especially after its entrance

into Morayshire, falls at length here into the Moray Frith. It 
abounds with salmon and trout, nnd affords excellent sport to the 
angler. There is also a rivulet or burn, called the Burn of Kin- 
loss, which flows due east and west, and divides the parish into 
almost equal parts. Receiving at the east end of the parish two 
tributary streams, and fed in its progress by numerous drains, it 
occasionally swells to a considerable size, and empties itself into 
the bay of Findhorn, a little below the parish church. 

Meteorolofjy — The mean density of the atmosphere is found 
to be 29.595 ; the mean temperature in the shade 48.6 ; the mean 
monthly depth of rain 2.006 inches. For about one-third part of 
the year, the south-west wind blows ; to which circumstance is to 
be ascribed the superior mildness of the air in Morayshire, during 
the summer and autumn. In the end of autumn, and for the most 
part of winter, either a north-west wind prevails, increasing often 
to a tempest, with cold rain, sleet, or snow, or a north wind, which 
is always cold, generally fair, but occasionally accompanied by 
heavy rain. The most unpleasant weather in all the year is about 
the end of spring and beginning of summer, when a keen easterly 
wind continues for weeks in succession. In this particular locality, 
when the wind blows either from the north or east, in winter or 
spring, it is intensely cold, and, on the other hand, in summer and 
autumn it is uncommonly sultry and hot. The transition also from 
heat to cold and from cold to heat is not only frequent but some- 
times sudden. Yet the climate is remarkably healthy, and the 
inhabitants live in general to an advanced age. Pulmonary com- 
plaints and rheumatism are not unfrequent. 

Geology. — There is considerable diversity of soil in the parish, 
— clay, loam, sand, and moss ; but a rich fertile loam is its pre- 
vailing character, particularly in the lowest part of the valley, and 
towards the gently rising acclivity of its southern boundary, where 
alluvial deposits from the higher lands of the surrounding district 
settle down. Clayey loam abounds chiefly in the east end of the 
parish, deep black loam in the centre, about the precincts of the 
abbey, and light, sharp, sandy loam northward in the direction of 
the sea. The average depth of the soil is from eighteen inches 
to three feet, resting on a subsoil, sometimes of yellow or blue 
clay, but, for the most part, of red or white sand. Below the sand

is found, in some places, a stratum of gravel, and betwixt them, 
at the depth of eight or ten feet from the surface, a bed of shells, 
proving almost to demonstration, that, at a remote period, the sea 
must have overflown the land that is now cultivated. The pro- 
portion of peat earth or moss is not very great, being limited to 
a few acres on each side of the turnpike leading to Forres, imme- 
diately below the plantations of Grange. The subsoil, as else- 
where, is principally sand. The soil, in general, is capable, un- 
der good management, of producing plentifully every species of 
crop, and the abbey lands especially are considered equal in qua- 
lity to any in Morayshire. 

Zoology. — In this department, there is little variety. Hares, 
partridges, and rabbits are the only game that abounds in the pa- 
rish. The wild-duck is occasionally found along the shores. 
Weasels are numerous. The fox has not been seen for some 
years ; but he had, not long ago, his lodgement in the wood of 
Blackstob. Salmon, which abound, are allowed to go up to the 
spawning ground at the beginning of August. They deposit their 
spawn about October, and return to the sea in November. The 
only shell-fish that are found, are mussels and cockles. The for- 
mer are used for fish-bait more than food, and are bought by the 
fishermen at a high price from the proprietor or his tenant. The 
latter are gathered free, and sold by those who gather them in the 
country and towns around. 

II. — Civil History. 

At the downfall of the Roman Catholic hierarchy, when the re- 
ligious houses were dissolved, Mr Edward Bruce of Clackmannan 
got the lands belonging to Kinloss Abbey, the only one in the 
province of Moray, in commendam, and was created Baron Kin- 
loss in 1601, and his son, Thomas, Earl of Elgin, and Baron 
Bruce of Kinloss, 1633. By him the lands and feu-duties were 
sold to Brodie of Lethen.

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers were carried away

prior to 1699, but since that period, minute-book, marriage and 
baptism registers have been regularly kept, and there has also 
been a reoister of deaths kept since 1st January 1826. 

Mansion-houses. — The only resident heritor is Major Grant 
Peterkin. Grangehall, his seat, already alluded to, is an elegant, 
commodious, and substantial mansion, of a quadrangular shape, 
built in the modern style of architecture. The lobby is exceed- 
ingly spacious and handsome, and all the rooms correspond in size 
and comfort. Seapark, the residence of John Dunbar, Esq., has 
lately had great improvements made on it, by additions, enclosures, 
and planting, and the arrangements, both inside and outside, dis- 
play great judgment and taste. 

Antiquities. — Of these the ruins of the Abbey alone are impor- 
tant or interesting. It was founded by King David I., December 
19th 1150, and confirmed by a papal bull 1 174. It was liberally 
endowed. Shaw, in his history of Moray, mentions, that in 1561 
the revenues were L.1152, Is. Scots — 47 chalders, 11 bolls, 1 
firlot, 3 pecks, bear and meal ; 10 bolls 3 firlots, oats ; 34 wed- 
ders, 41 geese, 60 capons, 125 poultry. The fragments that re- 
main of the church, with its aisles, and the chapter-house, as well 
as the monastery, clearly shew that the buildings must have been 
originally splendid and extensive. Edward I. resided here for 
six weeks in the autumn of the year 1303, and a detachment of his 
army remained for a longer period. Little, however, is now to be 
seen of the former magnificence and grandeur of the edifice. In 
the year 1652, the walls were broken down and the stones sold to 
Cromwell's soldiers to build the citadel of Inverness. Since then, 
violent hands have committed depredations on it at various times, 
and in fact, it has formed a quarry for almost all the old houses and 
granaries in the neighbourhood. Still, notwithstanding these at- 
tacks, the side and gable walls of the abbacy stood entire until 
they were within these few years past recklessly levelled to the 
ground, and disposed of for building dikes. Not one stone 
would have been left on another to mark the spot, had not 
the trustee on the estate, a gentleman of antiquarian taste and at- 
tainments, interdicted the spoliation, and caused the east, gable, 
that narrowly escaped destruction, to be propped by a buttress of 
mason-work; and there it stands, the sad and solitary fragment 
of a mansion, wherein the mitred abbot once held his sumptuous 
banquets, and even princes were his guests.

Character of the People.— The peasantry are intelligent, sober, 
and industrious, althoucrh the practice, which has become so universal, 
of hiring servants at markets, is found to be producing deteriorat- 
ing effects on morals. The fishing people are here a distinct race, 
distinauished eminently, the female sex more especially for their 
greatdvility, sobriety, cleanness, and proper behaviour in every re- 
spect. Instances of'thoughtlessuess and improvidence may be met 
with, and then misery and want will be met with, too, as insepara- 
ble concomitants ; but the careful and the temperate live contented 
and happy, having abundance of the necessaries and a few even of 
the luxuries of life, in neat, well-furnished, and comfortable cabins. 
Taken as a body, the inhabitants, both seafaring and landward, 
respect religious ordinances, and regularly attend on them, and 
when they come out on the Sabbath, dressed in their best attire, 
the very respectable appearance and devout manner they exhibit, 
seldom fail to attract the notice of a stranger. It is to be hoped 
too, that whilst, with very few exceptions, they have all the form 
of godliness, many of them are blest by the experience of its power.

Much attention has been paid of late to the improvement of 
live-stock, and the style of farming is also far superior to what 
prevailed in former times. The rotation of cropping generally 
followed is the six-shift, beginning with green crop, which is fol- 
lowed by barley ; then two years' grass, succeeded by wheat ; and 
lastly by oats. A great deal has been done of late in the way of 
draining, ditching, and enclosing. One enterprising tenant alone 
has -expended from L.l 500 to L.2000 on such improvements. 
Within the last ten years also, nearly 200 acres have been brought 
into cultivation by industrious and skilful tenants. Of any estate 
in the parish, that of Grange shows probably the greatest change 
for the better. When it was bought about the year 1 800, it con- 
tained 700 acres, of which two-thirds at least were completely 
waste ; at present, the whole of that waste is under wood or regu- 
lar cultivation. Extensive improvements have been made too 
on the barony of Muirtown ; and on the farm of Kinloss, the pro- 
prietor has built as handsome and commodious a square of offices 
as any in the county. By planting and taking in waste land, the 
estate of Sir G. Macpherson Grant, Bart, has undergone consi- 
derable change. The march of improvement, however, has still 
room to advance. No inconsiderab-le portion of the undivided 
common, now overflown by the sea, might, by embanking, be re- 
claimed, and were a belt of planting carried down from Kinloss 
to Findhorn, on each side of the road, where there is nothing at 

• In many respects, this parish had cause to regret the early death of the late 
amiable and intelligent proprietor, John Gordon Peterkin, Esq. of Grange and Gres- 
hop. He has been succeeded in the possession of the estate by his sister Mary Anne, 
only surviving child of the deceased James Peterkin, Esq., and a lady distinguished 
by many virtues. She married Major Peter Grant of Invererne. The parochial 
funds for the relief of the poor, and all contributions to charitable and religious ob- 
jects, meet on every occasion with the generous support of the family.

present, but a coarse kind of bent, it would add greatly to the 
beauty of the landscape and the mildness of the climate. 

Fisheries,— There are three different kinds of fisheries regular- 
ly prosecuted in the parish, the salmon, herring, and white or had- 
dock fishery. The first has been successfully carried on for many 
years. The great flood of August 1829 so altered the course of the 
river at its confluence with the sea, that, for some seasons afterwards, 
it yielded not the same return as before, but now it is returnmg 
again to its wonted state of productiveness. On an average there 
are 600 boxes of fish, packed with ice, each containing 34 lbs., 
and worth L.5 Sterling, annually shipped for the London market. 
The fish is caught partly by drag, still, bag, stake-net, and yair. The 
price here, from 1st February to the 1st June is Is. 6d. per lb. for 
salmon, and Is. for grilses, and from 1st June to 1st August Is. 
for the former, and 6d. for the latter. The rent for the whole 
river, bay, and sea fishing is L.1180. The herring-fishery, which 
is next, if not first in importance to the parishioners, has also been 
prosecuted with various success for the last twenty years. The 
fishermen are sixty in number, and during the last ten years up- 
wards of 20,000 barrels of herrings have been caught by them, for 
which they have been paid on an average, at the rate of at least 
8s. 6d. per barrel, making the sum received by them for that pe- 
riod L. 8500, while the time spent each season in earning their 
gains seldom exceeds seven weeks. The boats are of large di- 
mensions, and will carry from eight to ten tons weight. The her- 
rings are of a good quality, and a large kind, and the meshes of 
the nets by which they are caught are about 1| to 1 inches in size, 
and the length of the drift with which the boats are equipped va- 
ries from 330 to 400 fathoms. The white or haddock fishery is 
likewise vigorously prosecuted by nine or ten boats, manned each 
by a crew of six men, and which, on an average, bring on shore 
every day they can get to sea, from L.8 to L.9 worth of very fine 
fish, for which Forres and the surrounding country furnish a ready 
market. The produce of this branch annually may be reckoned 
at L.2000. 

The average produce of the fishings may therefore be thus com- 
puted : 

Salmon, 600 boxes, at L.5 per box, . L.3000 0 0 

Herrings, 2000 barrels, at L.l per barrel, . 2000 0 0

Navigation. — There are twelve vessels belonging to the sea-port 
of Findhorn in the parish, measuring in all 1000 tons register. 
Foreign vessels also visit the place, bringing sometimes two cargoes 
yearly of iron, tar, and timber from the Baltic, and one of timber 
from British North America. The articles brought coastways 
are about 25,000 barrels of Sunderland and Newcastle coals, 
which sell from Is. 9d. to 2s. per barrel ; 7000 bolls lime from 
the same places, which sell from 2s. 9d. to 3s. per boll ; 400 tons 
coals from the Frith of Forth, which sell from 13s. to 17s. per 
ton ; 150,000 slates from Balachulish, which sell from L.2, 15s. to 
L.3 per thousand ; 300 tons iron from Wales and Staffordshire, 
which sells from L.8 to L.14 per ton, according to size and quali- 
ty ; 400 tons salt from Liverpool, which sells from L. 1, 16s. to 
L.2 per ton ; 5000 to 6000 bushels bone-dust for manure, which 
sells from 2s. 6d. to 2s. 8d. per bushel. There are regular 
trading smacks from London, Leith, and Liverpool, which bring 
general cargoes of merchandi.se for Forres, Elgin, and Nairn. 
There is also regular communication by steam-vessels with these 
different places. The produce of the country around, sent coast- 
ways yearly, may be about 2000 barrels of herrings, 10,000 quar- 
ters of grain of every description ; 200 boxes of eggs, each con- 
taining 160 dozen; 2000 loads of timber, chiefly from the forests 
of Darnaway and Altyre. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Town. — The nearest market-town is Forres, to which 
there is easy access by an excellent turnpike road to Findhorn, 
and which strikes off, at the bridge of Kinloss, by a branch east- 
ward to Burghead and Elgin. The ride in this direction is one 
of the most beautiful in the district. Betwixt Forres and Find- 
horn there is a daily post. The distance is five miles. 

Village. The village of greatest importance is Findhorn, — 

signifying in Gaelic the mouth of the Erne, and hence by High- 
landers called Invererne. It is a burgh of barony, and contains a 
population of above «00. It is the sea-port of Forres. The har- 
bour, formed in a great measure by nature, is among the safest 
on the coast ; and, there being two quays of hewn stone, one of 
them erected lately with a breast-work, by which it is joined to 
the old pier, at a cost above L.1300, excellent accommodation is 
afforded for shipping. The entrance from the Frith at the mouth of 
the/iver is, indeed, a little intricate, by reason of a bar that shifts 
with heavy floods and strong easterly winds ; but the intricacy is very

much obviated by numerous active and skilful pilots, who under- 
stand the windings so well, that little damage has ever occurred, 
— one vessel only of all that have entered for the last forty years 
having been injured ; and even this accident was said to have been 
occasioned by the fault of the master. The truth is, that both 
the run at the entrance and the harbour itself are capable of re- 
ceiving much larger vessels than usually frequent them. The 
depth of water in the shallowest part of the channel is 10 feet 
during the lowest neap-tide, and in stream tide it is from 13 to 17 
feet, being greater than that of any other harbour on the coast 
from Aberdeen to Inverness. The bay, from the bar at the north 
to its termination south, is three and a half miles long, its breadth 
varying from five-eighths of a mile to two miles. A great part of 
it is dry at low water ; but in the run of the river, which, in some 
places, is about half a mile broad, there is, at the lowest ebb of 
stream tides, from 12 to 15 feet water, and the largest vessels 
which enter lie afloat at low water in perfect safety. 

Ship-huilding. — This is a branch of trade which has of late been 
carried on with considerable spirit, under the auspices of Mr Tho- 
mas Davidson, and other enterprising merchants. They have 
brought a ship-carpenter from the south, who has settled in the 
place, and employs about twelve men. For the last five years ten 
vessels altogether, built of the fine oak and larch of Darnaway, 
have been sent off the stocks into the watery element. 

Ecclesiastical State. — Kinloss, disjoined from Alves, RafFord, 
and Forres, was erected into a separate parish in 1657. The 
patrons are the Earl of Moray and Brodie of Lethen. After the 
Reformation, the abbey was for some time used as a place of wor- 
ship, and might have so been to this day, had not its dilapidation 
early taken place, as already narrated. The present church was 
built in 1765, and in 1830 it underwent a thorough repair; but, 
although too small for the accommodation of the parish, the heri- 
tors would not enlarge it. The kirk-session, however, with their 
consent, made an addition to it, capable of accommodating 200 
additional sitters, and now there is sufficient room for all the church- 
going population. The people belong all to the Establishment, 
with the exception of one family of Independents, consisting of 
man and wife, and another of Episcopalians, two members even of 
which are in communion with the church. The attachment felt 
towards the Church is strong, and the contributions annually made 
in behalf of its religious schemes liberal, being between L, 1

and L. 20. The stipend was augmented in 1819 to 66 bolls, 
2i lippies meal; 94 bolls, 3 firlots, 1 peck. If lippies bar- 
ley ; 18 bolls, 3 firlots, 2 pecks, f lippies oats ; and L.60j 
10s. 6Jd. Sterlino-. The teind is exhausted. The extent of 
the glebe is between four and five acres, value about L. 1, 8s. 
per acre. The manse was built in 1820, and, having been re- 
paired in 1839, is at present in good condition. The accom- 
modation it affords is not extensive : but the plan, furnished 
by the late Mr Gillespie of Edinburgh, is very neat. The parish 
church is centrically situated, being distant from the extremities 
of the parish on either side about two miles. There is no chapel 
of ease, but there is a place of worship in Fiadhorn wherein a Dis- 
senting preacher at one time officiated. When the present in- 
cumbent was admitted, more than twenty years-ago, it was vacant, 
and under the burden of some debt. This debt he paid off, and, 
with consent of the subscribers, took possession of the house, and 
he has since been in the practice of preaching in it on the Sabbath 
evening, generally once a month. 

Education. — In the parish, there are two schools, — the paro- 
chial, and an Assembly school in Findhorn. The parochial school- 
master's salary is L.35, his fees are about L.12, his other emolu- 
ments may amount to L.IO, besides the yearly allowance from Mr 
Dick's bequest to the schoolmasters in the shires of Aberdeen, 
Banff, and Moray, which may be something about L.30. The 
present incumbent keeps an assistant, and the school is well and 
efficiently taught. The teacher at Findhorn has a salary of L. 20 
per annum from the General Assembly's Education Committee, 
and his fees may amount to other L.12. The proprietor, H. A. 
J. Munro of Novar, who gives liberally every encouragement to 
educational institutions and plans, allows him L.IO per annum for 
cow's grass and other accommodations. A school- room and dwel- 
ling-house, affording excellent accommodation, were built a few 
years ago. The building cost something above L.160, which sum 
was raised by private subscriptions, and public collections in 
the parish. By the want of population in the immediate lo- 
cality, the attendance on the parish school is comparatively 
small ; but, betwixt these two schools, and a female school sup- 
ported partly by subscription, there are from 150 to 170 children 
attending the means of instruction generally, — a proof that the 
people, for the most part, are alive to the benefits of education. 
There are not above five or six persons in the parish above fifteen

years of age unable to read. Sabbath schools are taught; and, 
in Findhorn especially, a visible change for the better has occur- 
red, since the facilities of intellectual and religious instruction have 
been increased. 

Savings Bank A savings bank, in connection with that in For- 
res, on Government security, was lately established, and it is to be 
hoped it will meet with the encouragement and support which such 
tiseful institutions deserve. 

Library/. — A small library, set on foot in Findhorn by collec- 
tions, and another in connection with the General Assembly's 
school, have been found very beneficial. The books, chiefly of a 
religious and moral description, are eagerly sought and read by old 
and young. 

Friendly/ Society. — A Friendly Society, formed about forty years 
ago, is continuing to flourish, — its funds amounting at present to 
L.380, of which L.300 is lent on heritable security, and the re- 
mainder is in the British Linen Company's Bank. 

Poor. — The average number of poor receiving parochial aid is 
40. The only funds for their relief, exclusive of the interest of 
a small mortified sum, are the weekly collections at church, 
amounting on an average to L. 50 per annum. There are occa-  
sional donations from the heritors to the amount of L. 10 a year, 
and several benevolent individuals in the parish distribute every 
year from 150 to 200 barrels of coals among the most destitute. 

The allowance given in the course of ihe jear to each pauper, 
varies from L. 1 to L.3, which would be altogether inadequate to 
their support, did not their relatives and neighbours kindly assist 
them. A laudable spirit of independence, too, prompts them to 
make as much as possible by their own industry, and for the last 
twenty years not an individual from among the numerous poor that 
are in the parish, has gone forth from it publicly to beg. There 
has been no assessment hitherto, but how long this state of mat- 
ters, however desirable, may contiruie, is difficult to say. The po- 
pulation is on the increase, and if pauperism should increase along 
with it, nothing can prevent a change in the system which the 
kirk-session has been labouring to uphold, save increasing libera- 
lity on the part of the non-resident heritors, who have hitherto in 
any way, borne but a very trifling share of the burden. 

Fairs. — Three fairs are held annually at Findhorn, one in Octo- 
ber, one in March, and one in July, on the second Wednesday 
old style of each month, chiefly for sheep, cattle, and horses.

Inns, — Of licensed public-houses and whisky shops, there is a 
superabundant number, no fewer than 13. That they have a de- 
moralising tendency is most apparent. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
From the preceding- statements it may be seen, that the state of 
this parish in regard botlj to its agricultural, mercantile, and educa- 
tional resources, has been considerably improved within halfacentu- 
ry. By the attention that is paid to the system of farming and breed 
of stock, husbandry has been carried to a much higher degree of 
perfection — the means of communication by roads and bridges 
have become more ample — the education, dress, lodging, have be- 
come greatly meliorated, and an appearance of cultivation, beauty, 
and prosperity, has been given to the whole aspect of the parish, 
which it did not before possess. The improvements on the coast 
have kept pace with those in the interior. The harbour accom- 
modation has been enlarged and the shipping increased. Of the 
houses built, both in town and country, the outward appearance 
and internal arrangements are vastly superior to the old, and the 
seafaring as well as the agricultural population, the tradesmen 
and the peasantry, are better educated, better fed, better clad, 
and better accommodated, than used to be the generation of their 
fathers. The tide of prosperity which has thus so rapidly flowed 
in commerce and agriculture, has, it is to be hoped, been accom- 
panied by progressive advancement in the cultivation of the 
moral soil, and the attainment of what is the true riches, — the ex- 
cellence of Christian character.

PRESBYTERY OF FORRES, SYNOD OF MORAY. 

THE REV. MARK AITKEN, MINISTER. 



I. Topography and Natural History. 

Name.— Tub name of the parish of Dyke is supposed to be the 
Gaelic word Dig, signifying a water drain or ditch ; that of Hoy, 
the Gaelic word Maigh, signifying a plain. 

Boundaries, -c— The parish is situate on the south coast of 
the Moray Frith, and on the west side of the river Findhorn. Its 
extent is about 27 square miles. 

Topoffraphical Appearances.— The forest of Darnaway covers a 
considerable extent in the southern part of the parish, concealing 
from the view the park and open grounds around the castle of 
Darnaway. The ground slopes gradually to the north, with a 
gently undulating surface. After leaving the forest, the view is 
particularly rich and picturesque. To the left are the fine woods 
around Brodie House ; and, northward from it, appear the church 
and village of Dyke, embosomed in trees, and almost hid from the 
view. Behind the village, to the north-west, the ground rises con- 
siderably, with fine fields sloping towards the south, surrounded 
by trees and hedge -rows; while the Muckle Burn, and two smal- 
ler rivulets, fringed with natural alder, wind their way through the 
low ground, adding greatly to the beauty of the scene. Farther 
to the north are seen the woods and House of Dalvey. The 
ground still retains its undulating character, as far as the ancient 
boundaries of the parish of Dyke extend. The rich level land of 
Moy and Kincorth, ornamented by hedgerows and avenues, stretch 
from Dalvey to the sand-hills of Culbin. These cover an im- 
mense extent along the shore from east to west, relieved at the 
east end by the few acres which have as yet escaped devastation 
upon the estate of Binsness. To the north-west, there is a consi-

derable extent of moor and marsh, of which 150 acres wereplait« 
ed last year by the proprietor, J. M. Grant, Esq. of Glenmorris- 
ton. There still remain at least 200 acres fit for the growth of 
timber, which are to be planted next season. A few years ago, 
Robert Grant, Esq. of Kincorth, planted a belt skirting the sand- 
hills, which is thriving admirably ; and when the whole extent is 
covered with wood, it will prove a great shelter from the north, 
and conceal from the view a tract of ground, which at present has 
a very unsightly appearance.  

Meteorology. — This parish is not inferior in point of climate to 
any part of the county. There are no prevalent distempers aris- 
ing from local causes. Many cases occur of individuals attaining 
nearly to the age of a hundred years. 

Hydrography' — The Moray frith boimds the parish to the 
north. The shore is low and sandy. The water is exceedingly 
shallow for a considerable distance from the shore. The parish is 
well supplied with perennial springs, none of which possess any me- 
dicinal properties. The river Findhorn forms the eastern boundary 
of the parish, separating it, except in two points, from the parishes 
of Forres and Kinloss. The volume of water is not generally great; 
but the river, from having its source in the mountains, and from other 
cauf:es, is subject to high floods. In 1829 it rose to an unprece- 
dented height, and was comparatively more flooded than any of the 
rivers which were influenced by the rains that fell at that parti- 
cular period. It carried down an immense quantity of sand, which 
it deposited in the bay of Findhorn, lessening its depth, over a 
surface of three square miles, to the extent of eighteen inches. 
For several years the fishing was almost destroyed ; but it has beeu 
gradually improving, and is now nearly equal in value to what it 
was before the flood of 1829. After leaving its rocky bed below 
the suspension bridge, it is necessary to embank it, to prevent it 
from making encroachments on the cultivated ground. These 
embankments have cost an enormous expense, and require con- 
stant repair. When the river is flooded, such is the strength and 
velocity of its current, that it bursts all its artificial barriers, and 
sweeps resistlessly every thing before it. Several small trouting

ed by a clump of fir trees, is pointed out as the scene of the meeting between the 
weird sisters of Forres and the Thane of Glammis. The blasted heath is now cover- 
ed with a thriving plantation. It is contended by some, that, in this instance, tra- 
dition is at variance with history. But were this proved to be the case, facts cannot 
now deprive the " Harmore scene" of the interest which tradition and poetry have 
thrown around it.

Streams run through the parish, of which the largest is the Muckle 
Burn : all of them fall into the Findhorn. 

Geoloc/y—The most remarkable feature in the geology of the 
parish, is the sand-hills of Culbin. About the beginning of the 
thirteenth century, a section of the most fertile land in Moray, 
stretching along the sea~coast for several miles, was overblown and 
devastated by an irruption of sand from the westward. The im- 
mediate cause of this catastrophe is supposed to have been that 
partial upraising of the coast out of the bed of the ocean now as- 
certained to have taken place within the present geological era, 
which, by exposing to the action of the atmosphere the accumu- 
lated silicious detritus of ages, furnished the magazine from which 
this fearful inundation was derived. The estate of Culbin, once 
a valuable patrimony, is now an arid waste of shifting sand, desti- 
tute of any herbage except bent {Carex arenaria, or Ammophila 
arundinacea. Many of the sand-hills rise to the height of 100 
feet above the level of the sea; and, when sections are exposed, 
they exhibit a species of stratification similar to a series of super- 
imposed beds in a sandstone quarry. 

Proceeding upwards from the sea, along the course of the rfver 
Findhorn, the first rock exposed is at the suspension-bridge over 
the river, on the great post road. It is a coarse concretionary 
limestone, containing schist, iron pyrites, and occasionally crys- 
tals of galena or lead-ore. This bed in Moray forms the up- 
permost section of the old red sandstone. Between Findhorn 
bridge and the sea no rocky strata are exposed, the whole district 
being covered over by a mass of diluvium of great thickness ; but 
should strata be detected between this point and the sea, they will 
be found to belong to newer formations than the old red sand- 
stone. From the bridge up to the promontory of Sluie, a suc- 
cession of magnificent sections of old red sandstone is exposed. 
These deposits belong to the middle or gray beds of the system, 
and are characterized by containing organic remains in conside- 
rable variety and abundance, of which teeth and scales of fossil 
fish of the genus Holoptychius have been determined. At Sluie 
the sandstone beds terminate abruptly, and are met by an almost 
vertical chff of gneiss and granite, belonging to the primary series- 
of rocks. At this junction, there is no upheavement of the newer 
or sandstone beds from the general inclination of about 14 while- 
the primary rocks are nearly vertical. From this absence of di&amp;-

turbance in the newer rocks, it is inferred, that the primary beds 
were raised to their present angle before the deposition of 
the sandstone. From Sluie to the head of the parish, the pri- 
mary rocks only are found. The noble domain of Darnaway, with 
its adjoining forest of oak, occupies the primary and old red sand- 
stone section of the parish. That portion of it which rests on the 
limestone and newer deposits, which are always characterized by 
a gently undulating surface, is studded by gentlemen's seats, and 
is highly cultivated. 

Botany. — This parish presents rather an interesting field to 
the botanist. The sea-coast, the banks of the Findhorn, and the 
woods of Darnaway and Brodie, are worthy of being better ex- 
plored than they have hitherto been. There was collected by 
the late James Brodie, Esq. of Brodie, a large and valuable Her- 
barium ; but it contains few specimens gathered within the county 
of Moray. It is now in the possession of David Stewart, Esq. 
Edinburgh, Near Brodie House, the rare and beautiful Pyrola 
uniflora now termed Monesis grandiflora, was at one periodfound ; 
but it has now entirely disappeared, — probably from the spot 
where it grew being overgrown with furze. In the Darnaway fo- 
rest, and in the park and woods of Brodie, are many splendid spe- 
cimens of oak, ash, and beech. At Earlsmill, on the Darnaway 
property, are two magnificent trees, — one an ash, and the other a 
beech, which were noticed in the old Statistical Account. At the 
time of its publication, the ash measured 14 feet 10 inches in girth. 
It now measures 17 feet 7 inches. In 1824, it lost two of its 
largest branches, and is now a splendid ruin, fast going to decay. 
In the centre of it, there is a cavity large enough to admit of three 
men standing upright. The beech is still in full vigour, and 
has increased in girth from 14 feet 7 inches to 16 feet. On the 
property of William Brodie, Esq. of Brodie, and near the bound- 
ary line which separates the parishes of Dyke and Auldearn, are 
two Scotch firs {Pinus si/lvestris , which are especially deserving 
of notice. Since so much of the old pine forests of Scotland have 
fallen before the woodman's axe, there are comparatively few fine 
large specimens of this tree to be seen. These two are called, by 
way of pre-eminence, the King and the Queen. One of them 
measures, at the height of three feet from the ground, 12 feet 8 
inches in circumference. The other is somewhat less. The 
smaller of the two stands on rather high ground, and, towering, as 

it does, far above its comparatively puny neighbours, has been

shorn of some of its branches by the westerly blasts, and the sym- 
metry of its top has been thus partially destroyed, without adding 
to its picturesque beauty ; but the other, with its massy and deep- 
ly-furrowed trunk, its giant branches beautifully arranged and 
grouped together, and spreading over a space measuring 67 feet 
in diameter, has, from its lower situation, escaped the ravages of 
the tempest, and is surpassed by few, if any, of the same species 
in Scotland. 

In the garden of Dalvey, there is a venerable apple tree, which 
still blossoms richly, and bears some fruit of inferior quality. It 
is impossible to ascertain its age ; but it is conjectured, with some 
appearance of truth, that it was planted by the monks of Pluscar- 
den, at the time that Diilvey, then called Grangehill, belonged to 
that priory. The wood is very much decayed, and the tree, long ere 
this, would have fallen to the ground if it had not been supported. 

In the park near Brodie House, there is a plant of Magnolia 
purpurea grown to the height of 18 feet. 

The following list, selected chiefly from Mr Gordon's " Collec- 
tanea for a Flora of Moray," comprehends the rarer plants found 
within the parish : — 

Hippuris vulgaris Saxifraga stellaris Listera ovata 

Veronica montana aizoides Typha latifolia 

Circsea alpina Clinopodium vulgare Carex incurva 

Rhyncospora alba Cochlearia Anglica pauciflora 

Scirpus lacustris Danica teretiuscula 

Eleocharis multicaulis Erysimum Alliaria stricta 

fluitans Geranium pyrenaicum Carex sylvatica 

Milium effusum Corydalis claviculata Spergula subulata 

Epilobium hirsutura Cnicus heterophyllus Mentha sylvestris 

roseum Petasites vulgaris Ballota nigra. 

Zoology. — The roe {Cervus capreolus is found in the Darnaway 
forest, and in the woods of Brodie. The fox {Canis vulpes, the 
badger {Ursus meles, the polecat and weasel {Mnstelce, are fre- 
quently to be met with. The common hare {Lepus timidus, is 
abundant. Rabbits {L. cuniculus burrow in great numbers 
throughout the plantations and in the sand-hills. They are very 
destructive to the crops. Notwithstanding a constant war of ex- 
termination carried on against them, it is found impossible, from 
the extent of cover, to eradicate them. 

Reptiles. — Among the reptiles may be mentioned the viper 
[Coluber bermy the adder [Anguis eryx and lizards {Lacertce. 

" Both these are alpine plants, and have been carried down from the higher regions 
by the river. A single specimen only of Saxifraga stellaris was found near Moy 
Carse by Dr Innes of Forres subsequently to the floods of 1829.

Birdf. — There are several rookeries in the parish. Whatever 
opinion may be entertained elsewhere, the farmers in this quarter 
do not look upon the rooks as the " farmer's friend," and would 
be glad to get rid of them. They think, and not without reason, 
that the good which they do is far more than counterbalanced by 
the ravages which they commit upon the young braird and the po- 
tato crops. Pheasants {Ph asiarms colchicus, are very numerous. 
The cross-bill {Loxia curvirosfra, the starling Sturnus vulgaris, 
the woodcock {Scolopax rusticola, the golden-crested wren {Mo- 
tacilla regulus, the quail  Tetrao coturnix, the siskin {Fringilla 
spinus, all build in the parish. A beautiful specimen of the snowy 
day-owl {Surnia nyctea, was shot some years ago in the sand- hills. 

Amongst the water- fowl, which frequent the small lochs and 
marshy ground near the sea- coast, are the following : The wild- 
swan {Anas cygnusferus, white-fronted wild-goose {A. albifrons, 
scaup-duck {A. Marila, shieldrake {A. tadorna, pin-tailed duck 
{A. acuta, long-tailed duck {A. glacialis, golden-eye {A. clan- 
gula, tufted-duck i./w5ca, gooseander {Mergns merganser  
auk or razor-bill {Alca tarda. The great northern diver {Colym- 
bus glacialis, is sometimes to be met with in the bay of Findhorn. 
A specimen of the bittern {Ardea steUaris, was shot in a small 
loch, in 1839, in the Brodie woods. A great variety of terns 
{Sterna, breed upon the sand-hills of Culbin. Thousands of the 
black-headed gull {Larus ridibundus, breed upon an islet in a 
small loch in the Darnaway forest. 

II. — Civil History. 

Eminent Characters. — Among the eminent individuals connect- 
ed with this parish, may be mentioned James Stewart, known as 
" the good Regent," who was Earl of Moray in the reign of his 
sister, the unfortunate Mary Queen of Scots. 

Alexander Brodie of Brodie, who lived during the usurpation of 
Oliver Cromwell, was a man of great piety, learning, and ability. 
He was twice chosen a Lord of Session, but from his retired and 
domestic habits, accepted the office with reluctance, and soon re- 
signed. He was one of the commissioners sent to treat with 
Charles II. at the Hague and at Breda. He left a diary, of which 
extracts were published about the middle of the last century, 
which illustrate some parts of the history of the times in which he 
lived. 

The late James Brodie of Brodie was a man of considerable ta- 
lent and scientific acquirements. He especially distinguished

himself as a botanist, and added a considerable number of plants 

to the British Flora.

Parochial Registers. — The earliest date of the parochial regis- 
ters is 1640. They consist of eleven volumes of different sizes- 
Before the date of the registers which are now filling up, there are 
several blanks. Since 1783, they have been regularly kept. 

Antiquities. — Forming the back wing of the castle of Darnaway, 
stands an ancient hall, measuring 89 feet long by 35 feet broad. 
Its lofty roof is supported by massy beams of oak, and resembles 
those of the Parliament House of Edinburgh, and Guildhall, Lon- 
don. It is said to have been erected by Thomas Randolph, Earl 
of Moray. A large table of oak, and a chair of the same mate- 
rial, which bear evident marks of great antiquity, are still preserv- 
ed as memorials of the office and hospitality of the Regent. 

Near the northern approach to Brodie House, is a sort of obe- 
lisk, about six feet high, forming a parallelogram. On one side is 
a cross, elaborately carved, and on the other a number of rudely 
sculptured fabulous animals. It was found in digging out the 
foundations of the present church, and was claimed by some of 
the parishioners as a grave-stone, a purpose for which it was obvi- 
ously never designed. It was put up in the village in commemo- 
ration of Rodney's victory over the Count de Grasse, and from 
that circumstance received the name of Rodney's Cross. A few 
years ago, it was removed to the Park of Brodie. It is verv much 
defaced, and no trace of any inscription can now be seen upon it. 

In the church yard of Dyke, there is a grave-stone belonging 
to the Brodie family of the date of 1448. The inscription is still 
perfectly distinct and legible. 

About eighteen years ago, there was found in the churchyard, 
imbedded in a heap of rubbish, a grave-stone, which possesses a 
peculiar and melancholy interest, not so much from its antiquity, 
for its date is only 1613, but as the only existing memorial of a 
once powerful and opulent family, now extinct. Even the spot 
where the ashes of the members of the family repose, cannot now 
be pointed out. Fortunately it had escaped injury, and is quite 
entire. A few years after it was found, it was placed for its better 
preservation in the church.

About fifteen years ago, there was dug out of a steep bank 
above the Findhorn, a coffin of large dimensions, composed of 
flag-stones, containing the remains of a human skeleton. 

Ancient Coins. — Several of the coins noticed in the old Account 
as having been found in the parish are in the bands of private col- 
lectors. 

Modern Buildings. — Darnaway Castle is a large oblong pile. 
When seen from a distance, it has a very imposing appearance, 
rising in proud pre-eminence above the surrounding forest. It 
stands upon a gentle eminence, commanding a magnificent view 
of rich and varied scenery. The park below the castle presents a 
fine field for the landscape gardener. It contains great variety of 
ground, and natural capabilities, which, from the non-residence of 
the noble proprietor, have not been improved to the full extent of 
which they are susceptible. During the last two years, the fami- 
ly have resided at the castle, and several improvements have al- 
ready been made. Walks have been formed of immense extent, 
by the Honourable John Stewart, leading to and opening up 
scenery of surpassing beauty upon the banks of the Findhorn. 

JBrodie House is an irregular, castellated building. A large 
addition to the old mansion-house was built by the present pro- 
prietor in the old English style. The ground around is naturally 
an uninteresting flat; but the fineness of the wood, for the growth 
of which the soil is admirably adapted, the taste with which the 
ground has been laid out, its numerous avenues of noble trees, 
and an artificial pond, have supplied the place of natural beauty, 
and make it a delightful residence. The ceiling of the drawing- 
room is divided into compartments, and is curiously ornamented 
with grotesque figures, formed of stucco, in alto relievo. An ex- 
cellent collection of paintings adorns the walls of the public rooms, 
several of which are of great value. 

Nearly occupying the site of the old Castle of Dalvey stands a 
handsome modern building, pleasantly situated upon a fine knolh 
overlooking the Muckle Burn, which passes it in front. The gar-

the most beautiful plants and flowers. The other modern man- 
sion-houses are those of Moy and Kincorth. The material used 

in building is sandstone. 

III. — Population. 

According to the census of 1P31, the population of the parish was 1457

The number of families in 1841, • • 295 

Average number of births for the preceding seven years, as per register, 22 
marriages, - - - 9" 

deaths, - - 22 

The decrease is partly owing to emigration, and partly to the 
enlargement of farms. 

Norman Macleod, Esq. of Dalvey, is the only propietor who 
constantly resides in the parish. The Earl of Moray has resided 
for the last two years. Robert Grant, Esq. of Kincorth, resides 
for several months in the parish every season. 

There are three families of independent fortune in the parish, 
besides the landed proprietors. Five of the proprietors hold lands 
of the yearly value of upwards of L.50. 

There is one person fatuous and dumb, and one blind. 

The people seem contented and happy, and enjoy, in a rea- 
sonable degree, the comforts and advantages of society. They 
are generally decent, industrious, and sober ; church-going in their 
habits, and attached to the church of their fathers. A great im- 
provement has taken place in the morals and intelligence of the 
people, within the last twenty years. 

.IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — The number of acres under 
tillage is 3'218 imperial. There is scarcely an acre capable of cul- 
tivation, which has not already been brought under the plough. 
Of pasture there are 1286 acres, and 2802 acres under wood. 
The rest of the parish, to the extent of 9974 acres, is an irreclaim- 
able waste. There is no undivided common. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of arable land is L. 1, 15s. per 
Scotch acre. 

The gross rental of the parish is about L.56;32. 

Price of Labour. — Farm-servants receive from L. 10 to L. 14 
per annum with board ; women-servants, from L. 3 to L, 4. Day- 
labourers gain Is. 8d. in summer, and Is. 3d. in winter, without 
victuals. During harvest, the price of labour is considerably high- 
er. A mason receives 2s. 6d., and a carpenter 2s. a day.

Hnshandry. — On the estate of Darnavvay, the tenants are bound 
to follow the five-shift rotation ; and on the other properties, the 
six-shift. The farms are generally let for a period of nineteen 
years. They vary in size from 40 to 1 50 acres Scots. The aver- 
age produce of wheat is 4 quarters ; of barley, 6 quarters ; of 
oats, quarters per acre, Scots. Wheat weighs from 60 to 65 
lbs. ; barley from 52 to 57 lbs. ; oats, from 40 to 45 lbs. per 
bushel. The average produce of hay is 150 stones per acre 
Scots. 

Improvements. — Subsoil ploughing and furrow-draining have 
been tried upon a farm belonging to the Earl of Moray ; and there 
is no doubt that there will be an ample remuneration for the outlay. 
Several acres have been trenched with the spade during last win- 
ter. Lime and marl have been extensively used. Bone dust is 
also in general use. It is planted or sown with the hand at the 
rate of ten bushels to the acre, and produces excellent crops of 
turnips, for which the soil is well adapted. 

The subsoil varies considerably. In some places, it is a fine 
open sand, or gravel ; in others, it is composed of a hard pan, 
called Moray coast, impervious to water. Furrow-draininga nd 
subsoil or trench-ploughing might be profitably introduced to a 
great extent. 

The few hedgerows are generally ill-kept and broken. They 
serve to enrich the landscape, but are of little use as fences. From 
the expense of driving material, there are very few stone dikes. 
The most common fence is paling, which is cheap, and of easy 
carriage. 

Great improvements have been made within these few years 
upon farm-steadings. Still, however, much remains to be done, 
in that respect, especially on small farms. 

There are sixteen thrashing mills in the parish, for the most 
part worked by horses. 

Woods. — The wood consists of oak, ash, beech, elm, Scotch 
fir, larch, spruce, birch, sycamore, horse-chestnut, and alder. 
The plantations are generally well and regularly kept. The 
management of the Darnaway forest, as to pruning, thinning, 
&amp;c. does very great credit to Mr Cutler the forester. His im- 
proved plan of raising oak plants from the seed deserves to be 
especially noticed, and made extensively known. The bed intend- 
ed to be sown, which, in this case, is 40 feet square, is excavated 
to the depth of a foot. Sleepers are then laid three feet apart, 



DYKE AND MOY. 



225 



and floored over with slab deals in the same way as a room, with 
this difference only, that wooden pegs are used in place of nails. 
The foot of earth, which was previously taken out, is now replaced 
upon the floor. The seed-beds are formed three feet wide, with 
a foot between them. The seed is then sown and covered with 
two inches of earth, which is trodden down firmly with the foot, 
to prevent mice from destroying the acorns. The beds remain 
in this state till the plants make their appearance, when the 
earth is gently loosened with a dung fork, to give relief to the 
plants, and to allow them to throw out their fibres more freely. 
When they are fit for transplanting, a spade is run along from end 
to end of the beds with its mouth kept close to the floor, and the 
plants are picked up by the hand, as the spade turns them up. 
They are then carried to the forest, and planted in the same way 
as seedling firs. One advantage obviously resulting from this plan, is 
thegreat saving of expense in planting ; and another is, that, during 
the whole process, every fibre of the root, though as fine as a hair, 
escapes injury ; and, when planted, the young oaks take root and 
grow at once, whereas by the old method the roots are all cut, and 
it is generally the third year before they recover from the check, 
and a great many of them die. 

There are regular sales of timber, fit for boat and ship build- 
ing, and general carpenter-work, in the Darnaway forest and the 
other plantations. 

The Scotch acre is planted by Mr Grigor of the Forres nur- 
series with 4500 Scotch firs and larches for 13s, 

Fishings. — There is a salmon fishing of considerable value up- 
on the Findhorn. The sea-shore yields an inexhaustible supply 
of excellent cockles, which not only afford a wholesome addition 
to the meals of the common people, but give employment and sub- 
sistence to a number of women, who sell them through the coun- 
try and the neighbouring towns. It is calculated that the pro- 
duce of this bed exceeds L. 100 per annum, besides what is ga- 
thered for home consumption by the cottagers. 

Produce. — The average gross value of raw produce yearly rais- 
ed in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows ; 

Wheat, . . L.5976 0 0 

Barley, , . 4717 0 0

V. — Parochial Economy. 
There is no market-town in the parish. The nearest is For- 
res, distant about four miles from the centre of the parish. There 
are several small villages ; Dyke, Kintessack, Broom of Moy, 
and Whitemire. The population of the largest does not exceed 
200. 

Means of Communication. — The nearest post-office is that of 
Forres. The great post-road, from Aberdeen lo Inverness, on 
which the mail and two stage-coaches run daily, traverses the pa- 
rish from east to west, and county roads intersect it in all direc- 
tions. A great number of bridges span the burns which flow 
through the parish, and an elegant suspension-bridge connects it 
with Forres. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The Established Church is the only place 
of public worship in the parish. It is conveniently situated. It was 
built in 1781, and is in good repair. It is seated for betwixt 800 
and 900. No seat rents are exacted. The number of communicants 
belonging to the parish, and from the neighbourhood, is about 
250. The manse was built about fifty-one years ago. It received re- 
pairs and an addition in 1822. The stipend is 16 chalders, of 
which one-half is barley, and the other meal ; besides L.8, 6s. 8d. 
for communion elements, and L.20 Scots, in lieu of a grass glebe. 
There are two glebes, consisting of 10 acres, valued at L.16. 

Two hundred and forty-nine families attend the Established 
Church. There are 43 Dissenting, and 3 Episcopalian families 
in the parish. 

Education. — There is one parish school, the teacher of which 
has more than the legal accommodation, and the maximum salary. 
This parish is within the bounds embraced by the Dick Bequest. 
The allowance from that source varies according to circumstances. 
The average for the last seven years allocated to this parish is 
L.34 per annum. The session-clerkship is worth about L.5. 
The school-fees amount to about L.30. The branches taught 
are, Greek, Latin, French, mathematics, &amp;c. For the purpose 
of elevating the standard of education in the parish, the school- 
master has hitherto taught geography and English grammar gratis. 

Till within these few years, there was a school in the village of 



DYKE AND MOY. 



227 



Kintessack, which was given up for want of sufficient support. 
There is great need of one in that locahty ; and there is now 
some prospect of its being established under more favourable cir- 
cumstances. There is a Society school in Edinkillie, near the 
confines of this parish, which puts the benefits of education within 
the reach of those who are at too great a distance from the parish 
school. There is a female school in the village of Dyke, the 
teacher of which has a house and garden, and a small endowment. 
There is another female school in the village, and one in Kintes- 
sack, wholly supported by school-fees. The number of children 
attending school in the parish, is about 200. There is an annual 
sum of L.8, lOs. 6d. arising from two mortifications for the edu- 
cation of the children of the poor. There are none in the pa- 
rish above ten years of age, who cannot read. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
on the poor's roll, is 90 ; and the average amount of collections, 
for the last seven years, is L.43, 6s. 8d. There are, besides, three 
bolls of barley, from a mortification for the use of the poor, and 
the interest of L.lOO for the clothing of poor children. The al- 
lowance to each varies from 2s. 6d. to L.l, 10s. per annum, ac- 
cording to circumstances. Besides these public funds, the pro- 
prietors and their families distribute, during the winter, coals, 
money, and clothing to the most necessitous upon the respective 
estates. 

Jnns There are 7 ale-houses ; far more than are necessary 

for the accommodation of the parish. To the credit of the inha- 
bitants, it may be added, that they are not much frequented. 

Fuel. — Turf and wood are in most general use for fuel among 
the poorer classes. From the breadth of plantation in the parish, 
wood fire is cheap. Ships deliver coals, when the weather per- 
mits, within the parish, opposite to the harbour of Findhorn. The 
nearest sea-port is Nairn.

PRESBYTERY OF ABERLOUR, SYNOD OF MORAY. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER M'WATT, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Boundaries 8fc. — The parish of Rothes is beautifully situated 
on the west bank of the river Spey, with the exception of the 
estate of Aikenway, formerly called Oakenwall, which is on the 
opposite bank, at the bottom of the hill of Beneagen, and occu- 
pies little more than the space of a mile, in the form of a penin- 
sula. It is bounded on the south and south-west, by Aberlour and 
Knockando ; on the west, by Dallas ; on the north-west and north, 
by Dallas, Birnie, Elgin, St Andrews-Lhanbryd, and Speyraouth ; 
and on the east, by the Spey, on whose opposite bank is the pa- 
rish of Boharm, extending along the winding bank of the river, 
northw.ird from the rock of Craigellachie, a distance of between 
nine knd ten miles, with an average breadth of nearly three. 

Topographical Apjjcarancea. — The form of the parish is somewhat 

irregular, and its physical aspect agreeably diversified with hill and 

dale. Besides the noble Spey, several smaller streams or burns are 

in the parish, which descend from the interior, and discharge their 

waters into the river at various places. Along the margin of the 

Spey, the surface of the ground is extremely level, and the hills, 

at certain distances, bending near to the bank of the river, have 

shaped this level course into four beautiful haughs or detached 

plains called Dandaleith, Rothes, Dundurcus, and Orton. These 

haughs consist either of excellent alluvial soil or deep loam, and 

produce some of the finest crops of oats, barley, and wheat, to be 

met with in the country. By the river side, the soil is, with few 

exceptions, rich and fertile throughout. Leaving the Spey, and 

advancing into the interior of the parish, the surface swells or rises 

into irregular eminences of various and considerable height, and 

forms, as it were, a natural barrier on the north and west. The 

sides of these rising grounds are, in a great measure, covered with 

thriving plantations of wood, principally Scotch fir and larch, 

3 



ROTHES.

which cover nearly 800 imperial acres, all of which are particularly 
thriving, and some of them nearly advanced to maturity. In the 
more elevated parts of the parish, there is a considerable extent of 
hill, moor, and moss ground, which never has been in cultivation ; 
on the greater part of which heath and natural grass grow, afford- 
ing pasturage to flocks of sheep ; and the remainder consists of 
peat-moss, which is highly serviceable to the population as an ar- 
ticle of fuel. 

The soil along the margin of the river consists, in general, of a 
deep and fertile loam, — in some places, of beds of pure clay in 
others, of a mixture of light sand and coarse gravel, superinduced 
by the floods. Along the bottom of the hills, the mould is sharp 
and gravelly ; and on the hill-side, moss-earth is to be met occa- 
sionally. Within the last twenty or thirty years, great and import- 
ant improvements in the system of agriculture have been intro- 
duced by a regular rotation of cropping, and the judicious use of 
lime as a manure. Portions of waste land have been thus reclaim- 
ed, and are now become tolerably productive. 

The geological features of the parish, so far as yet ascertained, 
are few and simple. At the southern extremity, is the lofty and pic- 
turesque rock of the lower Craigellachie, consisting of huge detached 
masses of quartz; and between that and the village of Rothes, a short 
distance to the south-west, is another somewhat remarkable and con- 
spicuous eminence called Conerock, also of quartz, and of similar 
character; and both present the appearance of having, atan early pe- 
riod, experienced the effects of some awful revolution of nature. By 
fracturing the blocks of quartz which form the hill of Conerock, as 
well as examining their surface, beautiful specimens of rock-crystal, 
of various sizes, are met with, and, some years ago, they were eager- 
ly sought after by the curious. Similar specimens are also found 
in other localities of the parish. Erratic blocks of granite, of 
greater or less dimensions, are scattered here and there ; and al- 
though no continuous, or regular mass, or rock of granite, has yet 
been discovered, it is the decided opinion of geologists, that gra- 
nite, sometimes passing into gneiss, is the prevailing character of 
the underlying strata. A kind of sandstone, possessed of conside- 
rable hardness, and placed in regular laminae, walls the sides of the 
mountain-streams already alluded to, while, in other parts of their 
course, quantities of mica-slate, imbedded in blocks of granite, ap- 
pear. 

Climate. — The climate of Rothes is genial and temperate ; and 



230 



ELniNSHTRE. 



from the; purity of the air, and the verdure of the surroundingr 
mountains, is regarded as highly conducive to health and longevi- 
ty. The harvests are early, and the crops very seldom affected 
by frost. For, though the more cultivated and productive parts 
of the parish he at the distance of ten or fourteen miles from the 
sea-shore, yet, in consequence of being well sheltered on the one 
side by the high hills of the parish, and on the other, by the moun- 
tain of Beneagen, the crops are seldom more than ten days later 
in arriving at maturity than those nearer the coast. 

II. — Civil History. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers are of two kinds, 
marriage and baptismal ; the former commences in the year 1791, 
the latter in 1717. The baptismal register has been kept regular- 
ly throughout; the other has a break from 1815 to 1832. 

Land-oicners. — The parish is divided among six proprietors : — 
the Earl of Seafield ; Richard Wharton Duff, Esq. of Orton ; 
the Duke of Richmond ; William Grant M'Dowall, Esq. of Arn- 
dilly; William Robertson, Esq. of Auchinroath ; and Mrs Gum- 
ming of Logie and Pitcraigie. The last two hold their respective 
properties off the Earl of Seafield, as superior, and pay to his Lord- 
ship a small annual feu-rent. The Earl of Seafield is the largest 
proprietor, and the valued rent of his estates amounts to L.1621, 
14s. lOd. Scots. To him belongs the village of Rothes, situated 
on the haugh of that name, in a very pleasing and picturesque spot, 
surrounded on all hands by lofty hills, distant ten miles from El - 
gin, the same from Fochabers, and about twelve from Keith. It 
was commenced in the year 1766, on leases of two nineteen years, 
and the liferent thereafter of the possessor ; after which, it is in the 
option ofthe proprietor to take the tenements to himself at valuation. 
Each tenement occupies the eighth partof an acre, at an annual rent 
of 10s. At the same time, the tenants of each tenement have the 
privilege of renting an acre or two of land along with each tene- 
ment, but without any formal lease ; and by this means, as the 
land is generally good, together with the emoluments of some in- 
dustrial employment, to which they have, in most cases, been early 
trained, they procure for themselves a decent and respectable live'- 
lihood. Of late years, however, a number of poor labourers and 
others have been induced to take up their residence in the villao-e, 
and having no fixed employment, they are, in general, in indifferent 
circumstances, and in the winter season are subjected to great pri- 
vations. 



/ 



ROTHES. -•' 

The second largest proprietor in the parish is R. Wharton 
Duff, Esq of Orton. His property lies towards the lower end of 
the parish, and, unlike many of the landed gentry, he resides the 
greater part of the year on his estate. Orton House is a large 
and handsome edifice of four stories, containing ample accommo- 
dation for a family, and stands within less than half a mile from 
the banks of the Spey. The grounds about the house are taste- 
fully laid out and carefully kept, and a large and well sheltered 
garden and orchard yield an abundant supply of vegetables and 
fruit. Besides being embellished with a variety of the more or- 
namental trees and shrubs, Orton House is encompassed with a 
considerable extent of thriving plantation, principally of Scotch 
fir, but interspersed to no small extent with larch and various kinds 
of hard-wood, as oak, beech, ash, and elm. The valued rent of 
Mr Wharton Duff's property is L.501, 12s. 2d. Scots. 

At the northern extremity of the parish the Duke of Richmond 
possesses a small property called Inchberry. The soil in this part 
of the parish is inferior, and inclined to moor and gravel, and co- 
vers an extent of 835 imperial acres. Of these, 170 acres are 
under cultivation, 20 in pasture, 20 in planting, and 625 in moor. 
Of the moor land, none, or scarcely any, could with a profitable 
application of capital, be added to the cultivated land. It is all 
undivided, and pastured upon in com.mon by the cattle belongmg 
to his Grace's tenants of Inchberry. Valued rent is L.134, Os. 8d. 
Scots, and the real rental may be stated at L.141. 

One side of the glen of Rothes belongs to the family of Logie. 
At Birchfield, there is a commodious house and productive gar- 
den, lying at the base of a high ridge of hill ground, beautified 
with a large plantation of natural birches, which stretches along 
the side of the glen to a good distance. From the appearance, it 
is evident that the house was originally intended to be a proprie- 
tor's residence, but at present it is occupied by one of the tenants. 
Valued rent is L.74, 15s. Scots. The opposite side of the glen 
is partly the property of William Robertson, Esq. of Auchinroath, 
but it is limited in extent, and, excepting a thriving plantation of 
Scotch firs and larches, is not particularly valuable. There is a 
snug, comfortable house, suitable to the size and quality of the 
property. Valued rent is L.35 Scots. 

On the east side of the Spey, in the county of Banff, the penin- 
sula of Aikenway, already alluded to, and projecting from the 
base of Beneagen, is the property of William Grant Macdowal, 



232 



ELGINSIiniE. 



Esq. of Arndilly, connected with his estate in the parish of Bo- 
harm, Aikenway is divided into two farms, upper and lower 
Aikenway, and a small croft. Valued rent is L.130 Scots. 

Jntiquities. — In the immediate vicinity of the village, the site 
of the once important and well fortified castle of Rothes is to be 
seen. This place of defence, the ancient seat of the Earls of 
Rothes, stood on the extreme verge of a point of land running 
out from the more elevated parts of the parish to a consider- 
able distance and the situation must have afforded every facili- 
ty to the occupants for expelling the assaults of invading enemies. 
And not only did it possess this natural advantage, but, moreover, 
was surrounded by a high wall, and defended by a ditch on the 
land side, over which a draw-bridge was thrown, whereby the 
castle was nearly insulated, and well secured. The space oc- 
cupied by this fortalice was pretty large, as the inequalities of 
the surface covering the ruins sufficiently indicate. At the pre- 
sent day, no vestige of the castle itself remains; only a por- 
tion of the high wall which once encompassed it stands a con- 
spicuous object, and seems to call to remembrance the war- 
like character of our ancestors. About half a century ago, many 
of the stones of the ruin were removed to assist in the building of 
some of the houses of the village. The exact date when the cas- 
tle was erected, is uncertain, but it may be safely supposed that it 
was not earlier than the middle of the fifteenth century. About 
that period, the first Earl of Rothes was created, of the ancient 
and honourable house of Leslie, and the castle was the residence 
of the Earls, to whom it has given the title. On the Peninsula 
of Aikenway, already alluded to, at its extreme point, which is 
a rock of considerable height overhanging the Spey, it is re- 
ported that an old castle once stood, bearing the name of the 
Castle of Oakenwall. The situation was peculiarly eligible, be- 
ing surrounded on three parts by the Spey, whose broad, deep, 
and rapid stream, together with its steep and elevated banks, af- 
forded sufficient defence ; and the hill of Beneagen inwardly 
rendered the place not only a safe retreat, but a command- 
ing position for its inhabitants. The whole form of the ground 
on which the castle is said to have stood, evinces that great 
care was taken to render the place suitable by art, as well as p.-o- 
per and convenient by nature, the only approach to the castle be- 
ing by a narrow road on the top of an elevated ridge, from which 
the sides of the ground suddenly and equally sloped to the edoe of 



ROTIIRS.

the river. And although no authentic historical documents are 
extant, at this distance of time, to attest the truth of such a tra- 
dition, there are some ruins to be seen which are pointed out as 
the remains of the castle, and afford no small degree of credibility 
to the tradition. Connected with the castle of Rothes was a cha- 
pel or religious house, whose site is a short distance from the cas- 
tle on the south side, and is marked out by the remains of a bury- 
ing ground, which are still seen, though no longer used. The 
farm where this house was situated, is known by the name of Cha- 
pel hill. In the district of Orton, also, was a chapel, dedicat- 
ed to the blessed Virgin. And in the same quarter, there exists 
a well, known by the name of the Chapel well, which, in former 
generations, when, under the Popish yoke, ignorance and super- 
stition wofuUy prevailed, had attained a degree of unexampled ce- 
lebrity for its efficacy in the removal of almost every kind of 
disease and suffering, and was the resort of multitudes from 
all parts of the countrj', even from the distant Highlands. The 
first Sabbath day of the month of May was the special period 
when the waters, through the miraculous interposition of the bles- 
sed Virgin, were said to possess their full medicinal and curative 
efficacy ; and then, early in the morning, even before break of day, 
might be seen crowds of humanity, under real or imaginary suf- 
fering, of all ages, and ranks, wending their way from all directions 
towards the celebrated Chapel well, in anxious hopes of relief from 
their troubles. And even at present, there are individuals surviv- 
ing who have witnessed the eagerness, and sympathized with the 
credulity, of persons resorting to this once consecrated well, believ- 
ed to be efficacious in curing troubled hearts as well as diseased 
bodies. The first Sabbath of May is still observed by many of the 
lower classes of society hereabouts; and though, perhaps, not with 
the hopes of bygone days, yet, with no small degree of superstition, 
they keep up the practice of visiting the Chapel well, at an early 
hour of that day annually. 

The parish of Rothes, with respect to its ecclesiastical and edu- 
cational establishments, consists of what was originally the entire 
parish of Rothes, and a large proportion of Dundurcus. The an- 
nexation took place in the year 1782, when the suppressed parish 

' In the churchyard of the parish is to be seen the tombstone of the first Presby- 
terian clergyman after the Reformation. As the stone is quite entire, the inscription 
is perfectly legible, and runs as follows : — " Here lies ane Nobleman, Mr James 
Leslie, Parson of Rothes, Brother- German of George umquhile Earl of the same 
who departed in the Lord, 13th October 1576." '

of Dundurciis was divided between those of Boharm and Rotlies. 
Whether the reasons calhng for such a proceeding were at the 
time well or ill founded, it is not our province to inquire; but in 
the present altered state of manners and society, and the increas- 
ed population of the country, a disjunction in this case, as well 
as in others similarly situated, would seem to be both politic and 
advantageous. 

III. — Population. 
The whole population in the village, as computed by the cen- 
sus of 1841, amounts to 946 : and the number of houses inhabit- 
ed, 262; uninhabited, 13; building, 2. In the entire parish, 
there is a population of 1843, which is dispersed in the following 
manner : —

The parish is situated partly in the county of Elgin and partly 
in the county of Banff. The number of persons residing in El- 
ginshire is 1794; males, 828; females, 966. In Banffshire, 49 ; 
males, 25 ; females, 24. From this it will appear that, in the vil- 
lage, the number of females over males is 98, and in the rural dis- 
tricts, 39, and in the whole parish 137; and the average number 
of persons to each inhabited house, 4. In the year 1831, the po- 
pulation of the whole parish was 1709; the increase in 1841, 
therefore, is 134. 

The number of illegitimate births in the parish within the last 
three years, is 8. 

The inhabitants of the village consist chiefly of mechanics and 
agricultural labourers. No manufacture of any consequence is 
carried on, if we except small quantities of rough blanketing, &amp;c. 
Within the last two years, one of the most extensive distilleries in 
the north has been established in it by Messrs J. and J. Grant; in 
which establishment, between 30,000 and 40,000 gallons of whisky 
are annually made. The distillery is constructed to distil nearly 
1500 gallons per week. 

Though the people are, for the most part, attached to their na - 
tive place, and seem not to desire to remove far, or for any length 
of time, beyond its bounds, yet there are some individuals, whom 
an honourable ambition to improve their circumstances now and

then impels to seek their fortune in other lands ; and hence, 
within the last few years, a good many have undertaken voyages 
to America and Australia.  

IV. — Industry. 

As the several properties in the parish have not been thorough- 
ly surveyed, the exact extent of ground which lies constantly waste 
or in pasture cannot be stated, That belonging to the Earl of 
Seafield is about 8280 imperial acres in extent, and to the Duke of 
Richmond 625. All the properties united do not exceed 12,000 
acres. Though cultivation is, in a great measure, confined to the 
more level ground near to the river, there are portions of the 
hill districts carefully improved, and not at all unproductive. In 
particular, the defile called the Glen of Rothes, through which 
the road from Elgin, the county town, is conducted, and which 
is hemmed in on either side by lofty ridges of mountain, con- 
tains several good farms in a high state of cultivation, yield- 
ing abundant crops of grain. The quantity of land in the parish 
still remaining waste or in pasture, which, with a profitable appli- 
cation of capital, might be added to what is already cultivated, 
does not exceed 300 imperial acres. The number of acres in a 
state of undivided common is 625, which belong wholly to the 
Duke of Richmond, and are pastured upon in common by the cattle 
belonging to His Grace's tenants of Inchberry. The average rent 
of the land per acre in the whole parish is about L.1, and the 
valued rent is L.2497, 2s. 8d. 

The number of imperial acres on Lord Seafield's estates in the 
parish, which are cultivated or occasionally in tillage, extends to 
about 2200. The extent of hill, moor, and moss ground, which 
never has been in cultivation, and which remains constantly waste 
or in pasture, is about 8280 acres. The quantity of land still re- 
maining waste or in pasture, and which, with a profitable applica- 
tion of capital, might be added to the cultivated land, does not ex- 
ceed 200 acres imperial. On this property, there is no undivid- 

• As an instance of the success consequent on honest and laborious industry 
which is characteristic of steady and prudent Scotchmen, we may here mention 
somewhat of the history of Dr J. Simpson, of Worcester, a native of the pa- 
rish. Having finished his education at the University and King's College' of 
Aberdeen, he left the place of his nativity with little more than an empty pocket 
and the wide world before him. He proceeded to England, entered upon the profes- 
sion of an academical teacher, and by his prudence, diligence, and perseverance" 
blessed by Heaven, accumulated a very considerable fortune. The greater part of 
this fortune he bequeathed, at his death, to the University of Aberdeen, and L 500 
to each of the parish schools of Rothes and Keith, for the purposes of educati.m 
He died little more than a year ago.

ed common. The number of acres under wood, which is almost 
wholly planted, extends lo 520. The wood consists chiefly of 
Scots fir and larch, which are particularly thriving, and of which 
a considerable part is nearly advanced to maturity. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
The old church and churchyard of Dundurcus, the former in 
ruins, are to be seen not far from the Spey, about two miles 
from the village of Rothes, and occupy an interesting and attrac- 
tive situation on the verge of a piece of table-land overlooking the 
fertile haugh of Dundurcus. Only the walls of the church remain, 
and the burial-ground is enclosed with a substantial wall, which 
was built a few years ago, at the expense of the late Dr John 
Simpson. The present parish church stands in the centre of the 
village, and is a plain, simple, and unadorned edifice, well befitting 
the unassuming genius and humble character of our Presbyterian 
form ; and, being the only place of worship in the parish, for there 
are no Dissenters within its bounds, is barely sufficient to accom- 
modate the population of the parish. The benefice is one of the 
smallest, L.37, I8s. being paid out of the Exchequer. This dis- 
advantage is, however, in some measure, compensated by the 
annexation of the glebe of Dundurcus to that of Rothes, making 
in all nearly twenty acres of excellent arable land. About the year 
1630, Mr John Wemyss, brother to the Earl of Wemyss, and mi- 
nister of the parish, made a private agreement with the proprietors, 
fixing the stipend at L.20, l-2s., and 45 bolls of meal. The sti- 
pend was augmented, in 1812, to 71 bolls, 3 firlots, 3 pecks vic- 
tual, half meal and half barley, and L.52, 12s. lOd. Sterling. 
The sum paid by the Exchequer to raise the said stipend to L.158, 
6s. 8d. which includes allowance for communion elements, is, as 
already said, L.37, 18s. Two-thirds of the right of patronage to 
the living belong to the Earl of Seafield, and the remaining one- 
third to the Crown, in consequence of the annexation just alluded 
to. The manse is an elegant erection, built about a year ago. 
It is of the old English or Elizabethan style of architecture, and is 
very commodious; and, being situated on an eminence skirted with 
wood, and overhanging the village, is a truly picturesque object in 
the lovely landscape with which it is surrounded on every side. 

Education. — The educational establishments of the parish con- 
sist of the parochial school, a female society school, a school hav- 
ing a very small endowment, and two adventure schools. There 
is also another school, which is to be endowed with a small salarv, 



ROTHES. 



237 



about to be establisbed; for which a school-room and school-house 
are in progress of erection. In the parish school nearly 100 cliildren 
of both sexes give almost regular attendance throughout the year, 
and receive instruction in all the branches of a useful education. 
Besides the maximum salary, the parish schoolmaster enjoys the 
advantage of the Dick Bequest, which has tended in an eminent 
degree to enlarge the comforts and raise the status of the school- 
masters to whom it is extended. And, moreover, the school has 
been recently benefited by the legacy of the late Dr J. Simpson, 
before-mentioned. This, together with the Dick Bequest, may 
amount to about L.57 or L.58; and the probable amount of fees 
actually paid to the schoolmaster in the year is about L.3'2. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of poor on the parish 
roll amounts at present to about 60, who are supported partly by 
the Sabbath collections raised in the ordinary way, and amounting 
to about L.60 annually ; and partly by the annual proceeds of 
certain endowments made at different times to the poor by bene- 
volent individuals. By this means, an average annual contribution 
is raised, for the relief of the poor, of about L.90, which, after 
deducting certain necessary charges and expenses, yields about 
an average of L.l, 6s. to each pauper in the year. There is no 
legal assessment. 

Savings' Bank. — There is a National Security Savings' Bank 
in the parish, which was instituted about two years ago, and is 
principally managed by the minister and schoolmaster. The 
amount of money invested in the bank, during the first year, was 
L.lOll, 3s. 4d., and during the same period there was withdrawn 
L.43, 8s, 2d. The amount invested during the second year is 
L.624, 15s.; and withdrawn, L.277, 2s. 2d. 

There are three markets held in the village every year ; the 
first on the third Thursday of April; the second on the third Wed- 
nesday of July ; and the third on the third Wednesday of October, 
for the sale of black-cattle and general business. They are in ge- 
neral well attended.

PRESBYTERY OF FORRES, SYNOD OF MORAY, 

THE REV. GEORGE MACK AY, A. M., MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name Boundaries, Sc. — The origin of the name of this parish 
is not certainly known. It has undergone so many alterations as to 
defy all attempts at fixing its etymology. In a charter, granted by 
Pope Innocent to the Bishop of Moray, in the thirteenth century, 
it is styled Ratheforde ; and in another charter of the same period, 
Rathefd. In records of subsequent dales, it is designated Rathed, 
Rathat, Raffart, Raffort, Raffard, and RafFord; the last of which is 
its present orthography. If we were to hazard a conjecture amidst so 
much uncertainty, we would assign an origin to the name, derived 
from the situation of the parish, and which is in some measure sanc- 
tioned by the high authority of Chalmers. He says, " The hill 
forts in Ireland, which are called Raths in the Irish language, 
were the strengths of the ancient Irish : and those raths are si- 
milar in their site and structure to the hill forts of the ancient 
Britons. The raths were placed on the summits of hills." If, 
therefore, we give a Celtic origin to the name, and take into con- 
sideration the eminences around this place, adapted for strengths 
or keeps, we may perhaps arrive at as reasonable a conjecture as 
may be formed on the subject. 

Extent, Sfc. The length of the parish is about 8 miles ; its 

breadth varying from 3 to 5. It is bounded on the east, by the 
parishes of Alves and Elgin ; on the north, by Kinloss and For- 
res ; on the west, by the river Findhorn ; and on the south, by 
Dal'las and Edenkilfie. It is of a very irregular figure, and is in- 
tersected near its northern extremity by a narrow neck of the pa- 
rish of Forres, which stretches for two miles into the interior ; 
while it again encroaches on what might be supposed to be the 
proper boundaries of that parish, and reaches a point not farther

than a quarter of a mile from the burgh of that name. This ar- 
bitrary division can be accounted for, in this and similar instances, 
only by a desire on the part of the authorities of the time, not to 
divide the estates of the several proprietors, but to place them, in 
such cases as admitted of it, under one and the same spiritual ju- 
risdiction. 

Topographical Appearances.— The face of the country is very 
much diversified ; the lower part being of a character quite dis- 
tinct from the upper ; the one partaking of all the characteristics 
of a lowland country, while the other assumes the bolder features 
of Highland scenery. The centre presents the appearance of an 
extensive undulating valley, diversified by moorland, lochs, wood, 
and well cultivated fields. Whilst it possesses this variety within 
itself, there are points affording the most extensive views of the 
adjacent counties. From the towers of the Castles of Burgie and 
Blervie, and the intended site of a new mansion-house at Altyre, 
the eye embraces a range more extended than is often to be met 
with ; comprehending the counties of Banff, Inverness, Ross, 
Cromarty, Sutherland, and Caithness ; whilst at our feet lies our 
own beautiful and fertile province of Moray. 

Climate. — The climate of Moray is so well known for its equal 
temperature and salubrity, that it is unnecessary to dwell upon the 
subject. It may suffice to say, that it still lays claim to those vir- 
tues which Bishop Leslie, himself a Northern, and consequently 
qualified to draw a comparison between it and other counties 
around, ascribes to it — " Regio est una, prae caeteris omnibus 
apud nos, amenitatem celebrata." To this, certainly, this parish 
forms no exception, of which the following proofs may be given. 
The present incumbent, at one time, paid considerable attention 
to the registration of deaths, and the causes and ages of decease. 
This record he showed to a friend then visiting him, who has a 
name now honoured in the first of our universities, and distinguish- 
ed for his philanthropy, and acquaintance with the " annals of the 
poor." This gentleman was struck with the frequency of cases 
of extreme old age recorded, and declared that he had not met 
with any thing so favourable to the salubrity of the climate, except 
in the bills of mortality in some of the valleys of Switzerland.  

• Whether it was owing to information derived from this source, or from another, 
is unknown, but it so happened, that, some years ago, an apph'cation was made to 
tlie same incumbent, by persons embarking in a Tontine speculation, to furnish them 
with some of the best lives above seventy-five. This was done, with a s]ecial recom- 
mendation in favour of one intlividual, although he had attained his seventy-eighth

There were at one time three individuals under one roof, whose 
united ages amounted to the extraordinary number of 298 years. 
And at present, out of the comparatively small population of the 
parish, we have now, or had since the commencement of the year, 
twelve persons, none of whom are under eighty-two years of age, and 
several of whom have attained to eighty-eight ; while in many of 
those who range between seventy and eighty, there are none of the 
symptoms to be met with of extreme old age. 

Hydrography. — There are several lochs in the parish. The 
most important, and certainly the most interesting, is the Loch of 
the Romach, which forms a part of the southern boundary of the 
parish. Its extreme length is about a mile, whilst its breadth may 
be about one-eighth of a mile; but what it wants in space is com- 
pensated by the romantic nature of its situation. It is formed by 
very precipitous banks on both sides, in a district naturally wild 
and desolate, and lies entirely concealed till it bursts upon the 
view, and the visitor finds himself at once translated to a region 
where he may recreate himself according to his mood, either in 
wandering along the well-formed walks, or in pursuing his pastime 
of fishing for the trout, in which the loch abounds. A streamlet 
issues from it, which takes the name of the Back Burn, and which, 
afterwards increased, winds down the valley of Pluscarden, famed 
for its fertility and stately priory. The loch of the Blairs, or loch 
of the moss, also on the estate of Altyre, has been considerably 
enlarged by the proprietor, and, having been stocked with trout, is 
now rendered useful as well as ornamental to his grounds. The 
loch of Tulloch, on the estate of Blervie, has, on the other hand, 
of late years, been much reduced in size, it having been found 
necessary to drain it for the purpose of reclaiming a flat of 
moss which surrounds it. The Findhorn, we have already said, 
bounds the parish, and is the only river in it. That portion of it 
to which we have to refer, is that where its devastating power has 
been least felt, whilst its beauties are here principally concentrat- 
ed. Being confined by lofty and precipitous rocks, it rushes 
through the narrow passes, boiling and tumultuojis, or reposes in 
the dark and deep pools it has formed ; while plants, and shrubs, 
and lofty trees crown the steep heights, and finely contrast their 

year; and the minister had the satisfaction, in consequence of this person being se- 
lected, to attest for many succeeding years liis firm tenure of life ; while he himself 
was unconscious that any interest was attached to its duration beyond his own humble 
sphere. At length his good old friend could keep his hold no longer, and with him 
ended this episode in our parish history.

variegated foliage with the deep-red of the cliffs on which ihey 
grow. It is here also that this river has gained a notoriety for be- 
ing the most rapid and dangerous of any in Scotland, oftentimes 
after rain coming down from the gorges above breast-high, and 
overtaking the passenger before he is aware of the danger. The 
burns of Altyre and Rafford partake very much of the same cha- 
racter. The declivities through which they pass are so rapid, and 
their course lies so much through deposits of gravel, that they are 
continually inundating the plains below with debris, which is a con- 
stant annoyance and expense to those through whose lands they 
run. On the 6th August 1838, the whole region of the source 
and course of the latter burn was visited by a water-spout, more 
appalling, and more destructive in its effects, than any thing ever 
witnessed in the memory of any one now living amongst us. Sweep- 
ing bridges in its progress, and breaking down the banks, it covered 
the plain below with sand and gravel to the extent of several acres, 
and, in some places, to the depth of four feet. By this over- 
whelming calamity, the glebe, then bearing a beautiful crop of 
wheat, was rendered useless; and, but for the liberality of the 
heritors, who at a great expense carried away in part, and in part 
trenched down the deposit, it would have been for ever lost to the 
cure. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The geology of the parish has, in 
common with the rest of the province, been lately defined in a 
map which accompanies Sketches of the Geology of Moray by 
Patrick Duff, Esq." This unpretending but very able manual has 
appeared seasonably for the guidance of the uninitiated in that 
science, which is now occupying so much of the attention of the 
learned, and for prosecuting which this province offers so favour- 
able a field. The parish does not differ in its formations from the 
surrounding district, lying either on a bed of gneiss, or of grey and 
red sandstone. There is one point on the burn of Altyre where 
these different formations are seen to unite, and which lately at- 
tracted the observation of M. Agassiz, who visited the spot. We 
believe that the future will open new discoveries of an important 
nature in this department, through the zeal and talent of Lady 
Gordon Gumming, who has already done much for the interests 
of this science ; and of whom it has been well said, " that, while 
others may advance it by their graphic descriptions, hers has been 
the higher accomplishment of delineating, with unrivalled skill,

the fossil remains of a former world, and exhibiting them to the 
senses and mind in their primitive forms and colours." 

Of the two quarries mentioned in the former Account, one, that 
of freestone, which is of a coarse gritty texture, is still wrought, 
and furnishes materials for common ruble work ; the other, 
that of gray slate, though not exhausted, is now not used, — the 
coarse slate which it furnished, and which was at that time very 
commonly used in roofing, being now superseded by the imported 
Easdale or Ballachulish blue slate. The writer is not aware that 
any attempts have been made to ascertain the existence of marl in 
the bottom of those mosses which were formerly under water ; but, 
if he were to conclude from corresponding indications witnessed 
elsewhere, he would say that it was by no means improbable, that 
the experiment might be followed with success. A small sum' ex- 
pended in boring might put within reach a manure admirably 
adapted to the prevailing soil of the district. 

The soils are various, consisting of a deep rich clay, a light 
sand, a black loam on rock, moss, and the more common brown 
shallow mould lying on what is called " Moray coast," which is a 
compact stratum of upheaved attrite gravel. Of the moss land, 
considerable tracts have been recovered, within these thirty years. 
Some of these have well repaid the improvement. The writer has 
had, on a portion of moss thus recovered, wheat weighing 63 lbs. 
per bushel ; and, although these moss lands are by no means 
equally productive, yet there can be no doubt that their recovery 
from water and waste tend much to the value of property, inas- 
much as the draining necessary to them has served to carry off the 
superfluous water of the higher lands. In these mosses, large logs 
of oak and fir are everywhere to be found, evidently indicating that 
thev had grown from the original soil before the moss began to be 
formed, — the remains of the Sylva Caledonia of Tacitus, and the 
retreat of wolves and other wild beasts before men ventured 
to contest the possession with them. We must not omit, 
in speaking of soils, a peculiarity more marked in this parish 
than in any place round, although not confined to it. It is 
that, contrary to the usual case of the heights feeding the 
valleys below, the deeper soils are to be met with in the lands 
placed at the highest elevation. This is to be seen at the Castles 
of Bargie and Blervie, the lands of Cluny, belonging to Lord 
Moray, and of Phorp, on the estate of Altyre ; in each of which

the disadvantages of climate, in consequence of a high elevation, 
are more than compensated by the fertility of the soil. What may 
be still more difficult of explanation is, that, in such cases, the 
more fertile lands lie generally to the north, shaded from those 
genial influences to which we are accustomed to ascribe fertility 
and abundance. 

ZooloffT/.We are not aware that any very rare animals haunt or 
frequent the parish. The red-deer or stag is occasionally to be 
seen. The roe-deer is frequently to be met with, and parties of 
sportsmen are sometimes formed for a battle. 

We must be content to give only a few of the most remarkable 
birds. Of a predatory nature, we have the kite, the buzzard, the 
moor-harrier, the hen-herrier, the merlin, the kestril, the sparrow- 
hawk, the raven, the carrion-crow, the hooded-crow, the rook, 
the jack-daw, and the magpie. Of owls, we have the long-eared 
owl, tlieshort-eared owl, and the white owl. Of the legitimate objects 
of interest to sportsmen, we have the pheasant, no longer so rare as 
to be considered sacred ; blackcock, an occasional visitant, when 
driven by deep snowfromhisalpine retreats; red grouse or moorfowl, 
the partridge, the golden plover, the lapwing, and the corncrake. 
Of water-fowl, we have the wild-goose, now merely halting on 
their way to well known remote lochs, or passing over our heads, 
in regular array ; the heron, which may be seen wading in pursuit 
of prey in solitary marshes, or flapping his way towards his social 
home in the Findhorn ; the wild-duck, the woodcock, the water- 
rail, the water-hen, &amp;c. 

There is no variety of fishes beyond what is common to all 
small lakes or lochs, although the trout of each has its peculiar 
character of shape and colour. They may all be said to be re- 
markably delicate. 

Adders are sometimes to be met with in the woods; they may, 
however, be said to be scarce. The largest specimens occurring 
are about two feet in length. They are considered venomous. 

Botany. — Mr Gordon's Collectanea for the Flora of Moray, 
published in 1839, which is the most obvious source of informa- 
tion respecting the localities of Morayshire plants, mentions very 
few stations within the parish of Raff'ord. In the absence of other 
materials, the names of a few have been selected from that work ; 
they are known to be indigenous, or found in the parish, though 
scarcely entitled to be called rare.

The hills, moors, marshes, old woods, &amp;c. of the parish, if ac- 
curately explored, would, undoubtedly, furnish a much longer list 
of plants, possessing greater interest to the botanist than those 
mentioned above. 

I he plantations are chiefly of Scotch fir,  Pinus sylvestris J ; 
and larch,  Larix ; to both of which, particularly the latter, the 
soil seems well adapted, and both attain to a considerable size. 
There are larches planted by the late Sir Alexander Gumming of 
Altyre, now standing ; the value of which, at the usual rate at 
which the cubic foot is sold, is about L,5; and the present Baronet, 
who has, for the last thirty years, been faithfully obeying the dying 
advice of the Scotch laird to his son, has the satisfaction of seeing, 
in the large plantations of this valuable wood, formed by himself, 
trees of 20 inches diameter at the root, and tapering in beautiful 
proportion to a height of 40 feet. The oaks, of the same age, 
are commonly 12 inches. If, as Dr Johnson says, " that man 
is the greatest benefactor of his species, who makes two stalks of 
corn to grow where there was only one,/' some praise may be due 
to one, who, yet in his prime, has redeemed from waste, either to 
the culture of the plough, or the scarce less profitable appliance 
of planting every foot of his patrimonial inheritance. Of old 
wood, there are some noble specimens in the parish. In the gar- 
den of Burgie, there is a large sycamore  Acer-Pseudo-platanus 
measuring 14 feet in girth; while the diameter of its ramification, 
which is equally clustering and umbrageous on every side, is fully 
80 feet. Such a " monarch of the woods " is rarely to be seen. 
In the same place, there is an oak f Quercus robur J, the circum- 
ference of which measures 1 1 feet. But perhaps the most noble 
specimens of former ages, are the beeches, which surround the 
remains of that baronial hold, as if in proud mockery of the de- 
generacy of the present age. Of these there are several rows ; 
each tree, on an average, having a trunk of 10 feet, with fitting 
head and arms. It is cause of regret, that, when a modern 
house was judged necessary to be built, a site so begirt with the 
pomp and circumstance of former times should have been abandon-

II. — Civil History. 
The parish of Rafford, at one time, comprehended part of that 
of Kinloss, the latter being formed, partly from Rafford, partly 
from Alves, In 1661, Altyre, then a distinct parish belonging to 
the parsonage of Dollas, was by Act of Parliament annexed to 
Rafford. In the days of Episcopacy, Rafford was the seat of the 
subchanter of Moray. Reference is made to the parish in the re- 
cords of the Presbytery of Forres, which commence in 1651. 
Those of the parish commence in 1668; but are defective during 
the periods between 1709 and 1722, and between 1733 and 1738. 
They bear evidence of a discipline more strict than would be to- 
lerated in this age, when all who are disaffected to the Establish- 
ed Church, or feel aggrieved by her discipline, can obtain privile- 
ges from Dissenting bodies. Frequent reference is made in them 
to charges of witchcraft, malison, and exorcism, indicating the pre- 
valence of a superstition, which, we regret to say, is not yet whol- 
ly extirpated. The register of births commences in 1682, and is 
wanting from 1730 to 1738. It cannot be said that any disincli- 
nation is evinced to register the births, unless it be in a rare in- 
stance among the poorer classes, arising from a wish to evade the 
small fee. 

Eminent Characters. — Dr Alexander Adam, for many years Rec- 
tor of the High School of Edinburgh, and author of " Roman 
Antiquities," " Classical Biography," &amp;c. was a native of this 
parish, and received the first rudiments of his education at the pa- 
rish school. Dr Duncan Shaw, son of the well-known author of 
the History of the Province of Moray, was minister of the parish 
from 1753 to 1783. Towards the latter end of that period, he 
was elected to the Moderatorship of the General Assembly, and 
was translated to the East Church of Aberdeen, in which charge 
he died. He was a man of cultivated mind, and of pleasing man- 
ners, possessing in no ordinary degree the affections of the people. 
He published several works, which are respectable proofs of his 
literary research and taste, viz. " A comparative View of the several 
methods of promoting Religious Instruction," 2 vols. — " the His- 
tory of Gamaliel"—" the History of the Jews"—" the Centurion." 

Although not of eminence, yet if respect and honour, beyond the ordinary lot of 
men, the consequence of unblemished character and useful exertion, claim notice in 
a record of this kind, a place is due here to Mr George Fiddes, long the laborious 
and successful schoolmaster of this parish. Besides doing much for the cultivation

La7id-owners.~Vhe land-owners are, according to their valued 
rent, Robert Tulloch, Esq. of Burgie; Sir William G. G. Gum- 
ming of Altyre and Gordonston, Bart. ; the Earl of Moray ; and 
the Earl of Fife. The valued rent is L.2628, 4s. 1 Id. ; the real 
rental about L.3784. 

Antiquities. — The most remarkable piece of antiquity in the 
parish is the celebrated obelisk called Sweno's Stone, which stands 
on the property of the Earl of Moray, about half a mile eastward 
of the town of Forres. It has been so often described, and its ori- 
gin has been the subject of so many conjectures, that nothing new 
can now be advanced. Warlike instruments of various kinds have 
been dug up in the field where it stands ; but no distinct tradition 
exists of a battle having been fought on or near the spot. The 
following accurate description of the obelisk is taken from Rhynd's 
" Past and present State of Moray, pages 127, 128, and 129. 

" The Forres Pillar, commonly called Sweno's Stone, is situat- 
ed about half a mile to the east of Forres, on the north side of the 
highway, and occupies the position in which, in all probability, it 
originally was placed. The stone sts around the base are mo- 
dern, and were placed as supports to the pillar by a late Countess 
of Moray, Lady Anne Campbell. It has a hard sandstone 23 feet in 
height above ground, and said to be 12 feet more below ground. 
The breadth at the base is 4 feet; the thickness about 15 inches. 
On the south side there are five divisions, each filled up by nume- 
rous figures cut in relief. 

" The first division represents a number of persons as if engaged 
in deep council, and holding conversation, in groups, probably the 
back ground representing the walls of some hall or fortification. The 
second division exhibits an army of horse and foot on the march, 
the cavalry being in the van, and at full gallop, the infantry fol- 
lowing with spears in their hands, and shields. In the third divi- 
sion are appearances of a battle, both single combats, and general 
fighting. In one corner are several decapitated bodies lying, piled 
the one on the other ; while at the top of this division troops are 
seen entering the gates of a city, or it may be besieging it. The 

of the youth in the place, his school was resorted to by great numbers from Forres 

many of whom have since done credit to bis training by their advancement in the 
world, and occupying places of trust ; whilst his piety and wisdom secured to hinij 
among the people, a measure of moral influence rarely attained even by the ministe- 
rial character. He is here held up principally with the view of proving to those ia 
similar situations, how much good may possibly be done within their sphere, and 
how certain is the reward of exertion, not confined to their official duty, but embrac 
ing every object connected with the spiritual good of the community.

fourth division shows a number of captives bound together, some 
naked, and apparently females, others clothed in short jackets; 
while a row of warriors above, with unsheathed swords, are shout- 
ing victory. The last division is very obscure ; but it gives indi- 
cations of horsemen either returning as conquerors from the bat- 
tle, or retreating as beaten fugitives. 

« The other, or north side of the stone, has only three divi- 
sions. Below are two figures with human heads, though their 
bodies are rather of grotesque forms, typical, perhaps, of priests 
bending over something, as in an attitude of prayer; while a smal- 
ler human figure stands behind each. All these figures have a 
broad cap on their heads, while the warriors on the other side are 
all bareheaded. In the division above, is a long cross, the arms at 
the top being within a circle. The cross, and the entire spaces 
of the middle division, are filled up by the most ingenious carv- 
ing, representing the intricate and endless convolutions of the 
Runic knot. The edges of the stone are also occupied by these 
Runic knots, and evidently show the elaborate art of the sculptors. 
At the base of one of the edges of the stone are several figures, 
apparently females." The following extract from Gordon's " Iti- 
nerarium Septentrionale" will show the most generally received 
opinion of the date and origin of this curious relic of the olden time, 
page 159. " That these obelisks were erected for victories gain'd 
over the Danes, I have very good reason to believe, but cannot, 
from the history of their invasions on Scotland, learn that any vic- 
tory was ever gain'd by the Scots in that country : On the con- 
trary, we have already shown, that in the reign of Malcomb, when 
Olavus Scandianus, and Enecus, the Danish generals, were sent 
into Scotland by Sueno, they pitched their camp in Murray, and 
gain'd a very considerable victory over the Scots, taking posses- 
sion of the castles of Nairn, Forres, and Elgin, which obliged 
Malcomb to retire into other parts of the kingdom. Why this 
obelisk was rais'd, or how to explain the several figures thereon, I 
am at a loss, but cannot forbear thinking that it was erected by the 
Scots after the battle of Murtloch ; for the Danes having gain'd 
the afore-mention'd victory in Murray, design'd to settle them- 
selves, and families, in that country, being one of the pleasantest 
and most fruitful provinces of Scotland ; and accordingly sent 
their ships back to bring their wives and children over. But their 
affairs taking a different turn, by the battle of Murtlach, they were 
oblig'd not only to leave all thoughts of settling there, but entire- 



248 



ELGINSHIRE. 



ly to quit the kingdom. The Scots, therefore, seem to have 
erected this obelisk, as a monument not only of the battle of Murt- 
loch, which oblig'd their enemies to quit the kingdom, but as an 
evidence of the disappointment the Danes met with, in their hopes 
of settling in that particular corner of Scotland. The tradition 
concerning this stone favours my conjecture, it being still call'd 
King Sueno's Stone ; Olavus and Enecus, the Danish generals at 
Murtloch, being sent thither by Sueno.' 

There is a stone of a similar description at Altyre, found, it is 
said, about DufFus, and now placed in the grounds here. It con- 
tains simply a cross crosslet, resembling Sueno's stone in having 
its middle part greatly elongated. There appear to be faint marks 
of Runic knots on this stone, or other carvings. Its height is fif- 
teen feet. 

On the height immediately north of the manse stand the re- 
mains of the ancient Castle of Blervie, the seat of a branch of the 
once powerful family of the Dunbars. Its name, some centuries 
ago, was written Blare ; and it has subsequently undergone the 
various alterations of Blarie, Blarvie, Blairvie, and Blervie. It 
consisted of an oblong building, with a square tower at its west 
corner. In one of the angles between these a spiral stair led up 
to the top of the tower. Over the fire-place of the old hall is the 
the date 1398. The tower, of five stories, and the staircase, are 
now all that remain. The principal part of the building was taken 
down to build the present house of Blervie. At the height of a 
few feet from the ground, a breach of about a foot was made all 
round in the building, and its place filled with turf and other com- 
bustibles. The latter were then set on fire and consumed; but 
such was the strength of the old masonry, that the large pile of 
building, attached but by one corner to the tower, stood for three 
hours afterwards without falling. Although at one period the 
whole district of Moray belonged to the Dunbars, there is no tra- 
dition respecting the family of Blervie. The property about the 
beginning of the last century was purchased by Alexander Mack- 
intosh, who was " Laird of Blairie' in 1713 and 1724. From 
him it was purchased by William, Earl of Fife, and is now the 
property of the Earl of that name. 

The Castle of Burgie bears the date " 1602 zeiris," with the 
family armorial bearings, and the initials of the laird and lady of that 
day on the mantel of what was the great hall. The estate came to 
the Dunbars bv Katherine Reid, niece of the last Abbot of Kinloss, 



UAFFORD. 



249 



who was married to Alexander Dunbar, first laird of Burgie of 
that name. To the castle a more commodious house was added 
in 1702; but along with the original great hall, it was, in 1802, 
taken down to build the present mansion-house. The strength 
of the building was such, that the detaching of the stone from the 
mortar or lime cost more than the quarrying of new materials 
would have done. A square tower similar to that of Blervie, but 
more elegant, still remains. 

On the Burgie estate have been discovered several ancient 
coffins, each formed of five slabs of undressed freestone. The 
last was found in 1841. Its length was three feet, breadth two 
feet, and depth two feet one inch. It contained a skeleton, in a 
sitting posture, the head resting on the knees, which, on exposure 
to the air, fell to pieces. It contained also, as did the others dis- 
covered, an urn of clay, of very rough workmanship, rudely orna- 
mented with the representation of spiral shells, ten inches by seven. 
In this coffin alone were found ornaments, of a jet black substance, 
resembling cannel coal. Two rhomboidal pieces measured two 
inches by one, and an eighth of an inch in thickness. These, 
with tw.o smaller pieces of the same shape, and two of a triangular 
form, had small holes neatly drilled in them, through which ap- 
pear to have passed cords, attaching them to about 100 large 
beads; the whole fixed to a ring two-and-a-half inches in diameter. 
The appearance of the bones and the ornaments seemed to indi- 
cate that the grave had been that of a female of rank. None of 
these graves were surmounted by cairns, of which, notwithstanding, 
there are many in the parish. Small mounds occur in various 
places, composed of pieces of stone, about the size of road-metal, 
and having the appearance of exposure to the action of fire. 
Mixed with these is a very black mould, which, on minute inspec- 
tion, is found to contain small pieces of burnt wood. On remov- 
ing one of these, on a warm summer morning, the workmen were 
sensible of a heavy sickening smell, like that which is sometimes 
felt on opening a grave. The cairns are found in the higher parts 
of the parish, and are by the common people thought to mark out 
the former rude attempts of agriculture, when these stones were 
gathered, in order to lay the circumjacent parts under cultivation ; 
it being farther supposed, that only these patches of the higher 
ground were cultivated, whilst the valleys were covered with wood. 
This, however, is disproved by the fact, that, when opened, they 
present the relics of human bodies. Their origin is entirely un-

known. Near Blervie Castle, are four large stones, erect, and 
forming a square ; they are known by the name of the Temple 
Stones, and are evidently the remains of a Druidical temple. In 
a piece of soft moss ground, on the Burgie estate, a number of 
ancient querns were found, probably hid there, when multures 
and thirlage were enforced by law, and the use of the quern for- 
bidden. 

Family of Cumming of Altyre. — The family of the Cum- 
mings of Altyre can be traced to a very ancient date, and, at 
one time, held very large possessions in this country. Pont, 
or Gordon of Straloch, who, on Font's decease, was engaged 
to complete the Theatrum Scotiae, gives this testimony as to 
their former power. " Altyr ad Cuminios spectans, quae gens 
ante trecentos annos omnium Scotiae nobilium, et supra omnes 
Scotorum proceres potentissima et numerissima." And he goes 
on to describe the extent of their possessions. " Tenuerat ea 
gens Buquhaniae maximam partem, Strathbogiam universam, 
Balvanian, Badenochiam, Lochabriam, Atholiam multaque alia 
in his oris. Multaque quoque in australibus nostri regni pro- 
vinciis, quae mihi non nunc occurrunt." The family of the Cum- 
mings, or Comyns, were settled in Britain before the Conquest. 
The first Scotch nobleman of the name on record, is Robert Co- 
myn, who fell along with his sovereign, Malcolm Canmore, in 
1093. There are references to this family, continuously, in char- 
ters to which we have access. In 1296, July 26, Sir Alexander 
Cumyn, Knight, swore fealty to Edward apud Elgin, in Moravia. 
On 4th September 1296, Edward I. assigned thirty merks of legal 
extent to Alexander Cumyn of Badenoch. This Alexander was 
slain at Dumfries, by Robert Bruce, with his brother, John Cu- 
myn of Badenoch, on the 10th February 1306. 

His family seem, at that time, to have resided at Darnaway ; 
as, in 1368, a charter is given by David to Richard Comyn of the 
office of forest of Tarneway, &amp;c. ; and, in 1671, at a court held 
at Perth by Robert II. Richard Comyn resigns the Castle of 
Tarneway to Thomas the Graunt, son of John the Graunt, in 
the presence of the King, for their faithful and praiseworthy ser- 
vice to Thomas Ranulph, Earl of Moray, and Thomas and John, 
bis sons. Earl of Moray, our cousin ; " et quas terras, &amp;c. per 
eomposicionem amicabilem finaliter concordati, non vi aut metu 
ducti, nec errore lapsi, sed mera spontanea concordia et unanimi 
voluntate." 



i 



RAFFORD.

It would appear, that, about this time, the family settled at Al- 
tyre, inasmuch as, that, in 1398, Alexander Comyn is witness to 
an excambion of the lands of Mondole, Balnageith, &amp;c. for the 
lands of Leuchars in Fife, by the Duke of Albany. 1408, Alex- 
ander Cumyne gives a band man rent to Thomas Dunbar Earl of 
Moray, for his guid will to his marriage with his sister Euphemia. 
In 1456, Thomas Comyn surrendered the mill of Altyre to the 
Prior of Pluscarden, on being: threatened with excommunication, 
though he had always been informed that it previously belonged 
to hum, Jure hereditario. 

In 1672, Robert Cuming, laird of Altyre, gave his band to the 
Council of Scotland, for the peace of the Highlands. 

In 1657, he married Lucy Gordon, daughter of Sir Ludovick 
of Gordonston, through whom the estate of Gordonston devolved 
on Alexander Penrose Gumming of Altyre, on the death of Sir 
William Gordon of Gordonston, Bart, in 1795. 

He thereupon assumed the name and arms of Gordonston, and 
was created a Baronet of Great Britain in 1804. This succession 
was afterwards confirmed by the House of Lords, after a long and 
ineffectual litigation. The family is now represented by Sir Wil- 
liam G. G. Cumming, his son. 

There is a hill at Altyre which still goes by the name of the 
Gallow-Hill, where, in former times, the sentences passed at the 
Baron Court of Altyre were executed. An examination of the 
" Barron Court" Book serves, however, to show that the proceed- 
ings partook more of the observance of form and of dispassionate 
endeavours to investigate the truth than we are wont to ascribe to 
this court, and that, although punishment was inflicted in a way so 
prompt and summary as to stand in bold contrast with the lenity 
of the judicial code of this day, yet the accused was not altogether 
without protection. They do not appear to have attained to the 
perfection of " Jeddart justice." We subjoin a judgment of the 
" Barron Court of Altyre, holden near the place thereof, be the 
Right Honorable Alexander Cuming of Altyre, and William Cum- 
ing, younger of Craigmiln, his bailzie, upon the 16th day of Sep- 
tember 1697 years. " John Macgillichallom, theilf and robber, 
haveingbeen indicted, 'as within written, and haveing acknowledged, 
as is within espresst, the persons of assyze finding him guiltie, the

Of late years, the princi[al cause of its decrease has been the 
uniting of a number of small farms into one. It is hoped that the 
reduction, from this cause, has now reached its lowest degree, and 
that our proprietors are convinced that they need not, for any pru- 
dential reasons, enlarge their farms ; but that their rents are as 
surely forthcoming from a L.40 farm as from one of L.400. 

The yearly average of births for the last seven years may be 
stated at 16; that of marriages at 8; number of families, 200; 
average number of children in each family, 4. There are two fa- 
tuous persons in the parish, but none insane ; one blind ; none deaf 
and dumb. The people enjoy, in a reasonable degree, the com- 
forts and advantages of society, and are, in general, moral, reli- 
gious, contented, and industrious.

Livestock. — The former common breed of sheep, small horn 
Scotch white-faced, is now very much superseded by the Cheviots 
or crosses, which, of course, repay better for winter feeding. Of 
cattle, we have Highland, polled Aberdeenshire, and short-horned. 
Much attention has, of late, been paid to the improvement of these 
several breeds, and has been evidently productive of the desired

253 



efifect, as many of the prizes from agricultural societies are award- 
ed to this parish. 

Husbandry. — The system of husbandry commonly pursued 
is the six-course shift, which is thus arranged : 1. year, grass ; 
2. grass; 3. wheat; 4. oats ; 5. turnips or potatoes ; 6. barley. There 
are instances, although not required by any conditions of lease, of 
the farmers preferring the fifth course, which does away with oats 
succeeding wheat, or two continuous white crops. Draining is 
carried on to a considerable extent, and a good deal of waste land 
has been reclaimed. Perhaps the principal improvement recently 
introduced is the draining of the moss of Tarras, by means of 
which, and of other operations of a like kind, from 200 to 300 
acres have lately been added to the cultivated land of the parish. 
Farther improvements might be made in this respect. Indeed, all 
obstacles to improvement are in a fair way of being overcome by 
the increased activity of the tenantry. The only thing required 
is adequate remuneration on the part of the landlord for reclaim- 
ing lands. Were the proprietors to grant a fair allowance to the 
tenant at the end of the lease for every acre taken in, the benefit 
would be theirs as well as the tenants, in the improved state of 
their properties. The duration of leases is nineteen years, which 
is considered equally favourable to the tenant, and to the land. 
The farm buildings are generally substantial and in good repair; 
but no enclosures are used except palings, and, in most instances, 
none at all. Thrashing-mills are now almost universal. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce, as nearly 
as can be ascertained, is as follows : — 

For grain of all kinds, at L 5, 10s. per Scotch acre, . L.7700 0 0

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Town. — There is no market town in the parish. The 
nearest is Forres, distant from the church about two and a half 
miles. The parish contains no village of any size. Forres is also 
the nearest post-town. 

Means of Communication. — The length of turnpike roads is 
three and a-half miles. On the road between Elgin and Forres, 
which intersects the parish for about three miles, there run daily 
a mail-coach and two stages ; these, however, pass only through 



254 



ELGINSHIRK. 



the northern extremity of the parish, and there is no coach or car- 
rier on the other road. There is a road in continuation of the 
road to Craigmiln in DoUas, now carrying on beyond the bounds 
of the parish, through Dollas and Knockando— a part of the con- 
templated direct hne from Perth — which promises to be of great 
advantage, as opening an intercourse with the lower districts of the 
Spey, even if not prosecuted farther than to its banks ; whilst in 
the accomplishment of the greater object, viz. its being carried 
on to Perth, it would shorten the distance to that central point 
fully forty miles, and make this the direct line of communication 
between Morayshire and the capital. 

The bridges on the Kaffordburn were all swept away by the flood 
formerly referred to, and have not been rebuilt ; those on the Al- 
tyre burn are in a state of good repair, and highly ornamental to 
the scenery, especially the one at Craigroy, than which, a more 
picturesque object is scarcely to be met with. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is nearly centrical, and is dis- 
tant not more than four miles from any part of the parish. It was 
built in 1826, is a handsome and commodious structure, in the Go- 
thic style, from a plan furnished by Gillespie Graham, Esq., and 
affords accommodation for 600 sitters. The sittings are all free. 
The manse, built in 1817, is a good substantial house, and every ne- 
cessary repair has been given to it by the heritors, from time to time ; 
but, having been found to be inadequate for the accommodation of a 
very large family, itwas, about two years ago, very considerably enlarg- 
ed by the present incumbent, at his own expense. The extent of the 
glebe, exclusive of the ground occupied by the manse, garden, and 
offices, is about four acres, and its yearly value L. 8. The stipend 
awarded by decreet of the Court of Teinds in 1822, is 14 chal- 
ders, with L. 10 for a grass glebe, and L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communi- 
on elements, unexhausted teinds, L. Ill, 17s. 6d. The patron 
of the parish is James Campbell Brodie, Esq. of Lethen. There 
are no chapels of Ease, Government churches, Missionaries, Ca- 
techists. Seceding or Dissenting chapels of any denomination with- 
in the parish. Eight families, or their heads, attend Dissenting 
chapels in the neighbouring parish of Forres; one family alone at- 
tends the Episcopal chapel there. The number of families, there- 
fore, attending the Established Church may be about 190; the 
number of persons of all ages, 500 to 600 ; the average number 
of communicants is 140. 



RAFFORD. 



There are no Societies for religious purposes established in the 
parish, but collections are annually made for the various schemes of 
the General Assembly. The average annual amount of church 
collections for all purposes, religious and charitable, is L.50. Be- 
sides these, cases frequently occur of a public and private nature, 
for vvhich subscriptions are raised, and to which the people con- 
tribute liberally. 

Education, c. — There are four schools in the parish, one paro- 
chial and endowed, and three unendowed, and supported entirely 
by the fees of the pupils. The salary of the parochial schoolmas- 
ter is the maximum, with an allowance for a garden. He likewise 
enjoys the benefit of the bequest under the management of the 
Dick Trustees. Fees about L.16 per annum. He is also session- 
clerk. The parochial school house affords the legal accommoda- 
tion ; but is in such a state as to demand inquiry whether it be 
adequate to sustain the growing reputation of the school, or in 
good keeping with the increased comforts of every dwelling 
around. No additional schools are consequently required. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is 36, and the average sum allotted to each, 
15s. There is a capital stock of L.lOO; and the annual amount 
of contributions strictly for their relief, including other sessional 
disbursements, is about L.40. No recourse has been had as yet to 
assessments, nor do we desire to see that day. The poor people still 
retain a good deal of that, perhaps, peculiarly Scottish feeling, 
which inclines them to make parochial relief their very last resource. 
In truth, the destitution is in many cases great, before that is re- 
sorted to. 

Fairs. — Two fairs annually are held within the parish, one in 
the beginning of April, the other in the beginning of November. 
Both are cattle markets. 

Inns. — There is but one public-house, a convenience which 
could not well be dispensed with, and which is under such con- 
trol as to prevent its being productive of any evil effects. In this 
respect, never was a parish more indebted to the care of heritors. 
In several instances in which attempts were made to open ad- 
ditional public-houses, they were resisted by the heritors, who de- 
ferred to the opinion of the minister whether they were required 
or not. 

Fuel. — Three descriptions of fuel are used, — peat, wood, and 
coal. Of the first, there is now a scarcity, owing to the improve- 



256

ment of the mosses. Coal is procured from the port of Findhorn, 
distant about eight miles, at an expense, including carriage, of 
2s. 4d. per barrel. Wood is had at a reasonable rate from the 
thinnings of plantations. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The greater extent of ground now cultivated, and the immensely 
improved state of husbandry, constitute, perhaps, the most strik- 
ing difference between the present state of the parish, and its state 
at the time of the last Statistical Account. Connected with this, 
and, in a great measure the cause of this improvement, is the put- 
tingdown of the former practice of illegal distillation of spirits — than 
which, surely, never did any thing tend more to degrade and de- 
moralize a people. So prevalent was this twenty years ago, that 
no disgrace was attached to the practice ; and families, in other 
respects of good repute, carried it on without any compunctions, 
save those arising from a fear of detection, and consequent punish- 
ment. Instead of the midnight watchings, during which excite- 
ments cannot be supposed to have been wanting, and habitual de- 
ceit resorted to, in order to conceal their practices, we have now 
the satisfaction of seeing the same people steadily pursuing the 
improvement of their lands, elevated in their moral tone and bear- 
ing, their outward appearance giving evidence of a healthy tem- 
perament and ameliorated condition.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE COUNTY OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q19604743">ELGIN</name>.</head>

<p>

The ancient province of Moray extended from the mouth of 
the river Spey on the east, to the river Beauly on the west. A 
line, stretching from Loch Lochy on the south-west, through 
Lochaber, and following nearly the course of the river Spey, along 

d Benrinnes, formed its southern boun- 
dary, while the Moray Frith terminated it on the north, and sepa- 
rated it from the peninsula of Ross. Moray thus included the 
whole district of country stretching along the sea-coast ; and hence 
probably the Gaelic derivation of the name Murar or Morar, the 
sea-side, from Mor, the sea, and Taobh or Tav, the side. 

The present boundaries of the country are much more circum- 
scribed, — Nairnshire occupying the western, and part of InverneSs- 
shire the south and south-western portions of the ancient province. 
The greatest length from north to south is about forty miles, and 
its breadth varies from eight to fifteen and twenty-three miles. The 
northern range of the Grampian mountains, terminating in Ben- 
rinnes, which has an elevation of 2300 feet, forms the southern 
boundary and most elevated part of this county, from whence there 
is a gradual descent to the sea level by a series of parallel hills in- 
tersecting the county from west to east, and valleys between. The 
hills to the south consist of granite, gneiss, mica-slate, quartz rock, 
and talcose schist. Within about eight miles of the sea, these pri- 
mary strata are succeeded by the lower and middle beds of the old 
red sandstone, containing abundant remains of fishes ; and to these 
beds succeed the upper yellow sandstone of the same formation, 
with subordinate bands of a nonfossiliferous limestone. Small 
patches of the lower oolite and lias are also found near Lhan- 
bryde and in the parish of DutFus, containing numerous bivalve 
shells ; and at Linksfield is a fresh-water bed of limestone, analo- 
gous to the English Wealden, with remains of fishes, molluscous 
animals, and Saurian reptiles.-f-

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE 



The sandstone hills are of less elevation than the primary ridges, 
and the whole country gradually slopes towards the shores of the 
Frith. Hence, the rivers and streams which water the county, as 
the Spey, Lossie, Lochty, take their rise in the high grounds to- 
wards the south, and flow north and north-eastward to the sea. 

The plain of Moray consists generally of a light arenaceous 
soil, interspersed with valleys and tracts of rich alluvium and loam. 
In the lower district there is a deep clay. From the position of the 
county along the shores of an estuary ; from its slight elevation 
above the sea level ; and from the dry and porous nature of the 
subsoil, — the climate is genial, and superior to that of the neigh- 
bouring counties. The elevated hills to the south carry off much 
of the atmospheric moisture which would otherwise fall, and the 
level of the frith extending to the northward, and bounded on the 
opposite side by a chain of high hills, still farther prevents an ex- 
cess of rain ; while the porous surface readily absorbs, and as rea- 
dily gives off by evaporation, that moisture, which, stagnating in 
less favourable localities, renders the surrounding air chill and un- 
genial. There are few lakes or marshes of any extent in the shire. 
Lochindorb, in the upper part of the county, is the most conside- 
rable. Loch-na-bo, in the vicinity of Elgin, is celebrated for its 
picturesque beauty. Loch Spynie was of considerable extent, but 
it is now almost entirely drained. In ancient times, a considerable 
portion of the low country of DufFus and Drainy appears to have 
been under the influence of the ocean ; and along the coast, there 
are proofs of an elevation of the land, probably at a comparative- 
ly recent period. 

The county is decidedly Lowland, and the names, language, and 
habits of the people, indicate them from a very early period as a 
distinct race from their Celtic neighbours. They appear to be from 
the same Scandinavian origin as the natives of the whole eastern 
shores of Scotland. 

The lowland situation of Moray, joined to the amenity of its 
soil and climate, must have pointed it out as a desirable locality 
for our first religious establishments. Accordingly, we find, that 
it was early visited by the Culdees, the first messengers who brought 
the pure spirit of Christianity from the primitive churches of the 
east. Subsequently, about the beginning of the eleventh century, 
numerous religious establishments from Italy, planted the Romish 
religion in the province, and from that period till the Reforma- 
tion, the church engrossed the chief sway, and held extensive pos-

sessions in the district. A bishopric was established about the 
year 1100. The abbey of Kinloss, and the priories of Urquhart 
Pluscarden, and Kingussie, besides several other religious houses 
and hospitals, quickly followed, and the province was regularly sub- 
divided into parishes ; and churches or chapels were erected in 
each. 

The area of the county includes 840 square miles, or 536,600 
acres ; of these, 120,000 are under cultivation, chiefly in the lower 
district of the county, while the remainder is under wood, or pas- 
turage, or unproductive. The population, according to the census 
of 1841, amounted to 34,994, being an increase of 763 over that 
of 1831. 

The parliamentary constituency is 598.

PRESBYTERY OF NAIRN, SYNOD OF MORAY. 

THE REV. JAMES GRANT, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, ExtentfSfC. — The parish derives its name from the river 
which runs through it, called in Gaelic Uisffe Nearne, or Water 
of Alders, from the great quantity of trees and shrubs of that spe- 
cies of wood which grows upon its banks. From east to west, it 
measures 6 miles, and from north to south, upwards of 8. The 
figure somewhat resembles the letter X. In the environs of the 
town, and along the coast by Delnies, as also about Kildrumie, 
the soil is light and sandy. On the river side, it consists of sand 
mixed with a kind of mortar or clay. The south side of the parish 
is rather of a rich and heavy mould. On the north side of the river, 
the ground is flat and level ; and on the south, it rises with a gradual 
ascent, terminating, at one corner of the parish, in the hill of Ur- 
chany, the only eminence in the parish deserving the name of a 
hill. 

II. — Civil History. 
Antiquities, c.—On the north side of the hill of Geddes, are 
to be seen the vestiges of an old edifice, about twenty-six yards 
long, and nearly half as broad. It is called Caisteil Fionlach, i. e. 
Finlay's Castle. At the bottom of this little hill, on the south- 
east, there appears to have been a sunk, or draw-well for the use 
of the castle. A little to the east, on the side of the same hill of 
Geddes, are the remains of the Castle of Rait, built probably by 
Rait of that ilk, but at what period is uncertain. It was for some 
time the residence of one of the Cummines; and, considering the 
tmie at which it seems to have been built, it appears to havebeen 
a house of great strength. A little below this castle, is a place 
called Knock-na-gillan, i, e. the hill where the young men or lads 
were killed. Here, it is said that eighteen of the Mackintoshes 
were destroyed by the Cummines, who then lived at Rait, on ac- 

IJAIRN.

count of some grudge that subsisted between the families. At 
the place of Easter Geddes, are the remains of an old chapel, 
with a burying-ground around it. In this chapel is the burying-- 
place of the family of Kilravock ; and here they have been inter- 
red for many generations back, perhaps ever since the Roses came 
to this part of Scotland. How long the Roses were in possession 
of the lands of Geddes, previous to the marriage of the Laird of 
Geddes with Mary de Bosco, lady and heiress of Kilravock, can- 
not now with certainty be ascertained, as the writs of the family, 
relative to that estate, were destroyed in the cathedral church of 
Elgin, when it was consumed by fire. Lady Kilravock and her 
husband, Hugh Rose of Geddes, obtained a charter posterior to 
the loss of the writs above-mentioned, from King John Baliol, 
in the year 1293, confirming to them and to their heirs, the lands 
of Geddes and Kilravock. 

Parochial Registers. — There is a register of baptisms, and one 
of marriages, both commencing 5th March 1708; and a register 
of discipline, commencing February 1768. 

Land-owners. — These, with their respective valuations, are as 
follows: The Earl of Cawdor, L.1108, 17s. Id.; William M'ln- 
tosh, Esq. of Geddes, L.810; Hugh Rose, Esq. of Kilravock, 
L.518; William Robertson, Esq. of Househill, L.200 ; James 
A. Grant, Esq. of Viewfield, L.133; Henry Robertson, Esq. of 
Newton, L.130. 

Mansion- Houses. — These are, Geddes House, the grounds 
about it much ornamented by planting and shrubberies ; Viewfield, 
Newton, Firhall, Auchrhea, Milbank, Ivybauk, Househill. 

• Concerning the family of Kilravock, it would be needless, on this occasion, to 
say any thing particular. The figure they have made in the world, in various de- 
partments in life, their taste for the tine arts, for literature, for politeness, hospitality, 
&amp;c. is too well known to require the pen of a panegyrist. Geddes probably derives 
its name from Geelda, a Pictish saint, to whose memory, on this spot, it seems a 
place of worship was dedicated. 

The charter of foundation of the Chapel of Easter Geddes, part of the walls of 
which is still extant, and granted by Hugh Rose of Kilravock, bears date 1473. 
This chapel was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and endowed with L.5 Scots of sti- 
pend, together with a small croft, as a glebe, and on which to erect a manse. The 
priest or chaplain was to perform daily oflSces, not only for the soul of the founder, 
but also for the souls of his predecessors, and of his heirs and successors for ever. 
The bull of privileges for said chapel is dated at Rome, 26th April 1473, in the 
fourth year of Pope Sextus the Fourth. 

The site of the constabulary is still visible in the town of Nairn. The Lairds of 
Calder were, for a series of time, high constables, and heritable sheriffs of the county. 
Notice is taken of the Kebback-stone, in the Statistical Account of the parish of Ar- 
dersier. In the north-east corner of this parish, is a place called the King's Steps. 
Even tradition does not say on what account this royal appellation was affixed to 
this spot of ground. There is an excellent quarry of freestone, below flood-mark, 
easily wrought, and of no contemptible quality. There are some chalybeate springs 
of water, but not of such consequence as to deserve a particular description.

Number of acres under Wood, whether natural or planted, . 1380 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of land per acre is about 
L. 1, 5s.; but near the town, as high as L.2, 10s. or L.3. The 
real rental of the parish, for the landward part is L.4125, 2s. 2d. ; 
for burgh, L.2511, 8s. 4d. ; in all, L.6636, 10s. 6d. 

The agricultural improvements keep pace with those common in 
the north of Scotland. Mr Mackintosh of Geddes is the greatest 
improver of land, having all his property in the best state of culti- 
vation, and raising grain of superior quality. 

The chief improvements in the parish, for many years past, have 
been made by William Mackintosh, Esq. of Geddes. When he 
succeeded to that property, in November 1822, he found the 
arable fields in the late proprietor's own possession, in the best state 
of cultivation ; but those in the possession of tenants, in the worst 
and most unproductive state possible. The home-farm, however, 
consisted only of about 60 acres ; and the rest of the property was 
let to five small tenants, in farms from 40 to 100 imperial acres to 
each, exclusive of pasture. To the south, and immediately in 
front of the mansion house, is a large hill, called the hill of Ur- 
chuny, which at that time was a common between the neighbour- 
ing proprietors on both sides of it, but totally unproductive, and 
at the same time a very ugly feature in the country. As soon as the 
present proprietor got possession, it immediately became an object 
with him to improve the property in all its parts ; and he accord- 
ingly applied to the neighbouring proprietors to have the hill di- 
vided, and fortunately succeeded. This being done, he commenced 
planting his proportion with larch, oak, and some Scotch fir trees; the 
other proprietors immediately following his example ; so that the 
hill, which was formerly an eye-sore, is now an ornament in this part 
of the country. The proprietor of Geddes has also planted about 



4 



NAIRNSHIRE. 



50 imperial acres with different kinds of hard-wood, which are now 
most thriving. He also took all the farms which were in the hands 
of tenants into his own; built substantial farm-steadings upon 
them ; drained, limed, and enclosed them ; so that they are now 
equal to any fields in the country, either in appearance or produc- 
tiveness ; and he has added about thirty acres to the arable, mak- 
ing in all 390 acres, exclusive of pasture and beltings. 

The mansion-house and approaches to it have been much im- 
proved and enlarged. An excellent garden has been laid out, 
with an extensive range of glass. About seven years ago, the pro- 
prietor of Geddes purchased a farm called Torrich, immediately 
adjoining his own property. It was at the time in the worst order, 
but, by taking it into his own hands, he has so improved it by 
draining and blasting of stones, that, from 102 imperial acres, he 
has increased them to 155, of the best land, and let them to enter- 
prising tenants, in two farms, one of 115 acres, and the other of 
40. On the largest farm, there are erected a substantial steading 
of offices, and a capital mansion house. 

The last improvement to be noticed on the estate of Mr Mack- 
intosh, is the erection of a' range of neat cottages for labourers at 
Burnside of Torrich. One of the houses is occupied as a school 
and dwelling for the teacher, who is appointed by, and receives a sa- 
lary from, the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge. There 
is generally in an attendance of from 50 to GO scholars. A Sab- 
bath school is regularly attended by the children, and their pa- 
rents, who appear to prize highly the benefits derived from this 
institution through the bounty of Mr Mackintosh. 

Fishings. — Haddock and cod-fishing is carried on to a great 
extent, by about 200 fishermen and boys ; and in the season, they 
all remove to the Caithness coast, to the herring-fishing, which 
is their principal source of wealth. There is also a small salmon- 
fishing at the mouth of the river, and along the shore, which rents 
at L.60 or I..70. 

Navigation. — Seven vessels belong to Nairn, the only port. 
The burden of the seven may amount to 370 tons register. There 
is a good deal of trade carried on with the place, through other 
vessels, in importing coal, lime, and bone-dust, and exporting wood, 
the principal export, and sometimes corn. 

A small pier was erected some years ago at the mouth of the 
river Nairn, which has since been much injured by floods in the 
river, and an accumulation of sand driven in by the sea, so as to 
be of little use except for fishing-boats and small vessels.

v.— Parochial Economy. 

Burgh. — The burgh of Nairn has not much increased in size or 
population, during the last twenty years. The only increase is in 
the fishing town, occasioned by the prosperity attending the herring- 
fishing; when the whole of the male fishing population, numbering 
perhaps 150, besides boys, go with their boats in the hernng sea- 
son, to the Caithness coast, where they remain for six weeks, and 
on an average bring home from L. 30 to L. 100 each man, which 
constitutes a great source of wealth to the town. An academy was 
erected by public subscription some years ago in the burgh, and 
forms a very neat building at the west end of the town, the ground 
being the gift of the late Captain James Rose, R. N., who, be- 
sides several large donations during his life, has bequeathed his 
dwelling-house and a considerable sum of money to the Institution. 

Two other schools, one called the sessional school, to which 
the General Assembly's Committee have appointed a teacher, 
and the other the monitory school, have been been built by pub- 
lic subscription. A dwelling-house is attached to the former. 

There are branches of three different banks in the burgh, viz. 
the National, British Linen Company, and Caledonian. The first 
named have erected a handsome building for their institution. 

Gas has been of late introduced into the burgh, and promises 
to become a great benefit to the inhabitants, both in their private 
dwellings, and shops, and in lighting the streets. The public 
street, from having been a rough causeway, is now Macadamized, 
and much levelled; but some inconvenience is felt, in very dry 
weather, from the increased quantity of dust. 

There is an excellent well kept hotel in the burgh, at which 
three public coaches stop every day. 

There is a Temperance Society in the burgh, which promises 
to be productive of good. 

Ecclesiastical State. — Number of families in the parish belong- 
ing to the Established Church, 730. Number of Dissenting or 
Seceding families about 100; 1 Episcopalian family; and 1 Ro- 
man Catholic. Stipend 122 cwt. 6 stone, 12 lb. meal, 55 quar- 
ters, 6 bushels, 1 gallon, 1 quart barley, paid by the fiar prices, 
and L.129, 9s. 3i\d. money. The glebe is nearly seven acres in 
extent, and rents at L.18 per annum. It is not known when the 
manse was built; but in 1817, it was completely repaired, and is 
now in good condition.

Education. — The total number of schools in the parish is, five 
for boys, and two for girls. The parochial schoolmaster's salary 
amounted to about L.40 per annum. But the parochial school- 
master having died about six months ago, the heritors and Pres- 
bytery consented to a junction of the parish school, with an 
academy established in the town, by way of trial ; and at present, 
they form one institution under two teachers. The salary for both 
is L.65 per annum ; and the school fees amount to about L.30. 

Savings Banks. — There are two of these in the parish. The 
amount invested therein last year was L.1436, 14s.; withdrawn, 
L.385, Is. 8d. 

Poor. — The number of poor is from 120 to 130. Amount of 
contributions for their relief from L.60 to L.70 per annum; of 
which, from church collections, L.50 ; and from alms or legacies 
from L.IO to L.20.

PRESBYTERY OF NAIRN, SYNOD OF MORAY. 

THE REV. WILLIAM BARCLAY, MINISTER. 

L — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Sfc. — The parish of Auldearn seems to have derived its 
name from a brook which runs through it, and which is called in 
Gaelic Alt-em, — alt signifying a brook, and em, aldei\, a species 
of tree growing upon its banks. It is situated on the shore of the 
Moray Frith, about twenty miles west from Elgin, and as many 
east from Inverness. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish is bounded on the north 
by the Moray Frith ; on the east by the parish of Dyke ; on the 
south by the parish of Ardclach ; and on the west by the parish 
of Nairn. Its length from north to south is about 7 miles, and its 
breadth from east to west about 5. To the distance of three miles 
from the shore of the Frith, the ground, though of varied eleva- 
tion, is low. It then rises to a considerable height, and, at the 

distance of five miles from the sea, is intersected by a valley, 

4 



AULDEARN. 



through which flows a stream called the Muckle Burn. Beyond 
this valley it rises to an elevation greatly exceeding the former ; 
but, at its greatest height, corn may be cultivated and brought to 
maturity. 

Topographical Appearances. — For about half a mile from the 
shore of the Frith to the westward, and about one mile to the east- 
ward, the soil consists of nothing but sand covered with bent 
{Ammophila arundinacea . Here there are two objects worthy 
of notice. The one is an island or peninsula of sand, separat- 
ed from the land at high water, and called by the people in its 
vicinity " the bar." It is remarkable for shifting its place to the 
westward. Opposite to it are two sand-hills, about 100 feet in 
perpendicular height, and gradually moving to the eastward by the 
action of the wind, yet retaining their form. The bar is moved in 
the contrary direction by the action of the tide. It is difficult to 
form any theory regarding either the formation or locomotion of 
these objects ; but the facts, as stated, are certain. The rest of 
the parish, though generally level, is varied by gentle eminences. 
A great part of it is beautified by plantations, and the aspect 
which it presents when seen from some of the higher grounds, es- 
pecially in the season of spring, when the spectator has immedi- 
ately under his eye the tender green of the fields and woods, the 
herds feeding in the pastures, the Frith, which here is seven miles 
broad, the bold rocky coast of Ross, its mountains, and those of 
Sutherland, then often covered with snow, is altogether such as 
cannot be surpassed by any parish in the north of Scotland. 

Climate. — Along the whole coast of Moray, from the mouth of 
the Spey to that of the Ness, the climate is remarkably dry. It 
has been ascertained that the district enjoys forty days in the year 
of dry weather more than any other part of Scotland, and there is 
no parish where this is more rerparkable than in Auldearn. Every 
year the farmer suffers more or less from want of rain. Little 
snow falls in winter. The temperature is in general mild and 
conducive to health. 

Hydrography. — The Moray Frith, where it bounds this parish, 
is so shallow, that no vessel can approach the shore, and even a 
small boat could not conveniently land. There was, at one time, 
a fishing village opposite the sand-hills already mentioned, from 
which they retain the name of Mavistown ; but it has been long 
abandoned. A brook, called the Burn of Auldearn, passes through 
the lower part of it, and enters the river Nairn about half a mile 



8 



NAIRNSHIRE. 



from its mouth. On this brook, and within the parish, are four 
corn-mills. The Muckle Burn, already alluded to, on which 
there is one corn-mill within the parish, passes through its upper 
part, and enters the river Findhorn not far from the sea. There 
are a few small lakes in the parish, one of which, Lochlee, is ra- 
ther below the level of the sea. The parish is in most places 
well supplied with water. 

Geology and Mineralogy — None of the rocks in this parish are 
primitive. They are all of sandstone, some of them admirably 
adapted for building, of which the beautiful suspension-bridge over 
the Findhorn, near Forres, affords an excellent specimen. Its 
towers are built of stones taken from a quarry in this parish, on the 
estate of Mr Brodie of Brodie. Near the house of Boath, and on 
the property of Sir Frederick William Dunbar, Bart, there is a 
rock of black stone, which, on the application of fire, emits a flame. 
From this some have imagined that coals might be found in the 
parish. But it has been ascertained, that this description of rock, 
though frequently found below coal, is never found above it. At 
Clune, on the property of James C. Brodie, Esq. there has been 
found a number of limestone nodules, containing such a variety of 
fossil fishes as has of late much attracted the curiosity of geolo- 
gists and others. Dr Malcolmson was the first who discovered the 
contents of the limestones, as those who were engaged in carrying 
on the lime-work had never thought of splitting them in such a 
way as to exhibit the fossils they contained. On the Brodie 
property there is a moss of considerable extent, called the Moss 
of Inshoch, in which vast quantities of fir roots, and often whole 
trees, are found imbedded. In the moss of Litie, on the property 
of the Earl of Cawdor, there is an extensive bed of pure marl, 
from the use of which the agriculturist has in many parts of the 
parish experienced the greatest benefit. Marl is also found in 
other parts of the parish. 

Botany. — The botany of this parish appears not to have under- 
gone much investigation. Of late, however, a few discoveries have 
been made, which render it highly probable, that, notwithstand- 
ing a want of variety in the soil, the parish is every way worthy of 
farther research. Of the plants lately discovered, some are addi- 
tions to the Nairnshire flora, some to the more extensive flora of 
the province of Moray, and one, Potamogeton praelongus, discover- 
ed in 1832 by the Rev. Mr Brichan, to the flora of Britain. 
The following list comprehends such plants as are of greatest in- 



AULDEARN.

terest to the botanist, none being enumerated that are not decid- 
edly indigenous to the parish : 

Carex incurva Juncus balticus Pyrola media 

vesicaria maritimus minor 

Centunculus minimus Lobelia Dortmanna secunda 

Cnicus heterophyllus Lycopodium inundatum Ranunculus ayricomus 

Gagea lutea Nymphaea alba Trientalis europaea 

Goodyera repens Potamogeton praelongus Utricularia minor 

Hippuris vulgaris heterophyllus vulgaris. 

The Scotch fir, the larch, and every species of hard-wood known 
in Scotland, are successfully cultivated, and, in many instances, at- 
tain a considerable size. At Boath, and at Lethen, there are 
some fine specimens of beech, elm, and ash. To the east of In- 
shoch, on the property of Brodie, there is a plantation of birch, 
which seems to be the only one of natural wood in the parish. 
Some parts, once covered with wood, are now uncultivated moor- 
land. 

II. — Civil History. 

The parish of Auldearn was, at one time, of much greater ex- 
tent and importance than now. It was the ancient seat of the 
Deans of Moray. In 1650 some parts of it were annexed to 
Nairn, some to Cawdor, and some to Ardclach. 

The only place in the parish that derives its name from an his- 
torical event is a farm called Knock-na-gillan, or, the Young 
Men's Hillock. Here the Cummings of Rait put to death twelve 
out of thirteen young men of the clan Mackintosh, whom they 
had apprehended while passing through the parish. This was the 
means of increasing a feud which subsisted between these two 
clans, and which ended in the extirpation of the Cummings. 
Some time after the event just mentioned, they met at the Castle 
of Rait, on the occasion of a marriage. Each of the Cummings 
came prepared to kill one of the Mackintoshes; but the latter, 
having been forewarned of the intention of the Cummings, fell on 
them the instant they arrived ; and having put them all to death, 
burnt their Castle of Rait. The ruins, though not within this 
parish, may be seen from it, standing as a melancholy monument 
of the barbarism of ancient times. 

Battle of Auldearn. — The ground to the south and west of the 
village was the scene of one of the victories of the celebrated Mar- 
quis of Montrose. Having defeated the Campbells at Inverlochy, 
he marched into Moray, whence a detachment of the covenanting 
army, commanded by Hurry, not being in condition to oppose 
him, retired to Inverness. They were immediately re- enforced 
by the Erasers, Mackeuzies, Rosses, Sutherlands, and Brodies, 



10 



NAIRNSHIRE. 



and their number thus amounted to about 3500 foot, and 400 
horse. Montrose, having also received re-inforcements, from 
which his army amounted to about the same number, proceeded 
to Auldearn, and waited the approach of the Covenanters. These, 
advancing .from Inverness, engaged the royalist army on the 9th 
of May 1645. The latter seem to have occupied very nearly the 
line of the present road between Newmill and Auldearn ; their 
right wing being posted on the site of the modern village, and 
their left resting on the Bog of Newmill. Previously to the en- 
gagement, Montrose ascended the steeple of the church which 
stood on the rising ground above the village, the view from which 
position commanded the approach of the enemy and the whole 
field of battle. Here he seems to have remained a spectator of 
the fight, till circumstances about to be mentioned called him to 
the aid of his men. The attack commenced on the part of the 
Covenanters, and was directed against the left wing of the royal- 
ists, commanded by a Highlander named Macdonald, and entrusted 
by Montrose with the charge of the royal standard. The troops 
under Macdonald, though well defended by brushwood and en- 
closures, soon gave way before the veterans of the Covenant. 
When Montrose observed this, he descended from the steeple, 
and advanced with Lord Gordon to attack the left wing of the 
Covenanters. These, after a very obstinate resistance, he put to 
flight ; and, advancing to the aid of Macdonald, succeeded at 
length in defeating the whole of the enemy's force. His success 
on this occasion was considerably aided by an unskilful movement 
on the part of Major Drummond, who commanded Hurry's horse. 
This officer, anxious to support the infantry when hard pressed 
by Montrose and Lord Gordon, wheeled about so suddenly, that 
he encumbered the ranks of the foot, and threw them into partial 
disorder, which led to their ultimate defeat. For this he is said 
to have been tried at Inverness, and condemned to be shot. Va- 
rious accounts are given of the number of slain on both sides. 
The most correct seems to be that of Shaw, who says that 800 
of the Covenanters, and a considerable number of the Royalists, 
fell in this battle. Among the killed on Montrose's side was 
Macpherson of Invereshie. And if tradition may be credited, the 
life of Macdonald, though he was brave to desperation, was saved 
as much by his cunning as by his bravery. He was engaged 
hand to hand with Hay of Kinnudie, a tall and powerful man ; 
and, perceiving himself about to be overpowered, called out to Hay, 
111 not deceive you ; my men are coming behind you." Having 



AULDEARN. 



11 



by this means induced Hay to turn round, he saved his own hfe 
by stabbing his adversary at a disadvantage. Besides Hay of 
Kinnudie, there fell on the part of the Covenanters, Campbell of 
Lawers, Captain Bernard Mackenzie, Sir John Murray, Mr Gi- 
deon Murray, and Alexander Drummond of Meedhope, 

In a field to the south-west of the village, there is a small 
clump of trees enclosed with a dike. Here many of those slain 
in the battle of Auldearn are buried.f 

Eminent Persons. — John Innes, Esq, of Broad Street Buildings, 
London, who was a partner in the house of Fairley, Bonham, and 
Co., which had at one time the most extensive mercantile trans- 
actions with India of any house in London, was born in the village 
of Auldearn. He was for many years a Member of the Commons' 
House of Parhament. To the extensive influence of Mr Innes, 
and the unwearied benevolence with which he exercised it, espe- 
cially in behalf of his countrymen, the rise of many a private for- 
tune may be traced. There has just been erected to his memory, 
on a small eminence on the east of the village, a handsome build- 
ing, intended for an infant school. \ 

The building is surrounded by a stone wall, inclosing nearly a 
quarter of an acre of ground, imperial measure. The ground, 
with the road by which it is approached, was handsomely given 
for the purpose by Sir Frederick William Dunbar, of Boath, Bart. 

Land-owners. — The heritors of the parish, and their respective 
valued rentals, are as follow : 

John Gordon, Esq. of Cluny, L. 2418 19 4 Scots.

• The death of the last three is commemorated by two tombstones ; the one in 
the church-yard, the other with a tablet within the choir of the old church, the only 
part of that building which now remains. The inscriptions are as follow, and fix the 
date of the battle, which is erroneously said to have been fought on the 4th of May. 
f Heir lyeth Captaine Bernard Mackensie who in defence of his religion and 
covntrie feighting diet at Alderne the 9th of May 1645.

ray who lyes here intered who, fighting walliantly in defence of their religione 
king and native covntray died at Avldearn the 9th .May 1645." 

f Some time ago, on trenching the ground, their bones were exposed ; and when 
it was suggested to the late Mr Gordon of Biaid, the proprietor, to dig a pit, that 
they might be buried at a greater depth, that gentleman said, " They are low- 
enough already, poor fellows, and we'll not put them farther down. We'll plant it." 
This was accordingly done, and the place is since familiarly known by the name of 
the Dead Wood.

of worth, and for the education of infants in his native parish, this building was 
erected by the friends of John, Innes, Esquire, of Broad Street Buildings, London, who

Parochial Registers.Yvova the negligence of the session-clerks 
at some former periods, or from other causes, some of the paro- 
chial registers are lost, others are almost illegible, and the date 
at which they commence is therefore not easily ascertained. 

Antiquities.— On the higher ground in the parish, and on the 
Cawdor estate, are the remains of two Druidical temples— one at 
Golford, the other near the site of the old castle of Moyness. The 
latter consists of two concentric circles of large stones. It has an 
appendage not generally found attached to Druidical circles, and 
named a rocking-stone. It is large, and might weigh about four 
tons. It rocks slightly, only when passed over in a particular di- 
rection. The rocking-stone is supposed to have been used as an 
ordeal for the conviction of criminals. 

On a small eminence, called " the black hillock," and lying be- 
tween the two Druidical stations above-mentioned, there was dug 
up about twelve years ago a coffin composed of large ilag-stones, 
and containing a large and perfect skeleton. Near it were found 
also five or six ancient urns, filled with ashes and pieces of burned 
bone. 

The ruins of the castle of Moyness are now but a heap of stones. 

About a mile north of the church, on the property of William 
Brodie, Esq. of Brodie, lies the old castle of Inshoch, the family 
residence of the Hays of Lochloy, who once possessed a conside- 
rable proportion of the land in this parish. Within the ruins of 
Elgin cathedral there is a stone sarcophagus with a recumbent 
knight in full armour on the lid ; and the inscription tells us that 
the mortal remains within are those of William de le Hay of Loch- 
loy, who died 1421.— Rhind's Sketches of the past and present 
state of Moray. 

The inscription is as follows : 

Hie jacet Wills de le Hay qu5da dns de Lochloy qui obiit 
viii die mesis decebris anno dom mccccxxi. 

The property of Lochloy, now called Lochlee, adjpins that of 
Inshoch, and gave the title to the family who possessed both. 

A mile eastward of the church stood till lately the old house of 
Penick, the residence of the deans of Moray. Immediately west 
of the church, there is a small round hill, evidently artificial, for- 
merly called the Castlehill. It is on the property of Boath, but 
not even a tradition remains as to its original proprietor, or the 
purpose for which it was reared.

Modern Building s.-Oi these the mansion-houses of Lethen and 
Boath alone are worthy of particular notice. The former, the re- 
sidence of James C. Brodie, Esq. is the older of the two, having 
been built last century. It consists of a large main building of 
three stories, with two wings of less height and of unequal dimen- 
sions. It is situated in the southern part of the parish, on the 
higher ground of the valley of the Muckleburn. Seen from the 
opposite side of the valley, with large old beeches immediately sur- 
rounding it, and the beautifully wooded banks of the stream slop- 
ing below, it contributes to form one of the finest landscapes in the 
county. 

The mansion-house of Boath, the seat of Sir Frederick Wil- 
liam Dunbar, is an elegant building of three stories, erected about 
1830, of freestone taken from a quarry on the property, but not 
within the parish of Auldearn. It stands in the valley of the burn 
of Auldearn, at the meeting of the two principal branches of that 
stream, and a little to the north of the church and manse. The 
garden, lawn, and shrubberies are not extensive, but are well and 
tastefully laid out. The freestone, of a beautiful whiteness, has 
retained its colour almost uninjured by the elements. 

III. — Population. 

In 1755, the population is said to have amounted to 1951. 
The following are its various amounts during several of the years 
since that period : 

Year. Males, Females. Total. 

1796, . 661 . 745 .1406 
1801, 

1821, . 723 . 800 

1831, . 752 . 861 

1841, . 704 . 753 

Of the population, there are 360 resident in the village, and 
1097 in the rest of the parish. A considerable decrease in the 
latter, from the enlargement of farms, is partly compensated by a 
corresponding increase in the former. In 1797, the village con- 
tained 41 houses, and 185 inhabitants. It now contains 86 houses, 
and, as slated above, 360 inhabitants. 

From a register kept by the parochial schoolmaster, the num- 
ber of births, deaths, and marriages, for the last seven years, 
would appear to be as follows : 

Year. Births. Deaths. Marriages.

The number of families in the parish in 1831, - - 379 

chiefly employed in agriculture, - - 190 

trade, manufactures, or handicraft, 101 

But the number of marriages in the above account can alone be 
regarded as accurately ascertained. Many of the births in the pa- 
rish are not registered, especially of those who belong to the Seces- 
sion. So that there are probably about six births annually more 
than appear by the above statement. The register of deaths is still 
farther from the truth, being a record only of those who are buried 
in the parish. Many people, especially in the parish of Nairn, 
have their burying-grounds in Auldearn ; while, on the other hand, 
many who die in this parish are buried in others. 

There is no proprietor, or family of independent fortune at pre- 
sent residing in the parish, except James C. Brodie, Esq. of Le- 
then, and family. 

The number of families is 371 ; the number of persons in each, 
on an average, 4 ; the number of inhabited houses, 371 ; of unin- 
habited or building, 9. The parish contains 4 insane persons. 

A considerable proportion of the people are decidedly religious, 
and their influence and example have a most beneficial effect on 
the sentiments and manners of those who are themselves igno- 
rant of the power of vital godliness.

Is.; turnips, per acre, L.5, 10s.; hay, per cwt, 3s. 4d. ; butter, 
per lb., 8d. ; cheese, per lb., 4d. ; beef and mutton, per lb. 4d. ; 
fowls, each Is. ; eggs, per dozen, 3d. in summer, 6d. in winter. 
Mason-work 2s. 6d. per day ; carpenter do., 2s. 

The cattle are of various kinds, chiefly Highland. The sheep, 
as before-mentioned, are generally of the white-faced breed. The 
system of husbandry in the parish has of late been greatly improved. 
The general rotation of cropping is the six course shift, to which 
the tenants on all the estates except Kinsteary are bound. The 
order is as follows : 1st year, grass ; 2d, grass ; 3d, wheat or oats ; 
4fh, oats ; 5th, turnips and potatoes ; 6th, barley or wheat. The 
five course shift is thus arranged : Ist year, grass ; 2c, grass ; 3d, 
wheat or oats ; 4th, turnips and potatoes ; 5th, barley or wheat. 
Some of the farms on Colonel Gordon's lands are enclosed with 
good stone dikes. Much waste land in all parts of the parish has 
been reclaimed within the last thirty years. Great improvements 
have been made by draining, and by the use of lime and marl, 
bone-dust, and other manure. 

The general duration of leases is nineteen years. 

The state of farm- buildings has of late been much improved, 
but few enclosures have been made except on the property of Co- 
lonel Gordon of Cluny. 

The principal improvements recently introduced are better 
roads, better farm-buildings, and the greater productiveness of the 
fields by thorough cleaning, and good manuring. 

The principal obstacles to improvement are the want of capital 
on the part of the tenants, the want of a good harbour at Nairn, 
and the want of due encouragement from the proprietors. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce yearly 
raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows : 

Grain of all kinds, . L.8440 0 0 

Potatoes and turnips, . 2110 0 0 

Hay, . . 300 0 0

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town. — There is no market-town in the parish. Nairn 
the county town, is the nearest, and lies two and a-half miles to 
the westward of the church. There is but one village of any 



NAIRNSHIRK. 



size. It is adjacent to the church, and contains, as stated above, 
360 inhabitants. 

Means of Communication. — The means of communication en- 
joyed by the parishioners are various, and have, in the course of 
the last twenty years, been immensely improved. There is no post- 
office nearer than Nairn. The turnpike road from Elgin to In- 
verness, formed in 1820, runs through the parish for , about four 
miles, and along with county roads running in all directions, and 
all kept in good repair, affords the best possible communication 
short of railroads or canals. The bridges are well and substan- 
tially built. A daily mail, and two daily stage-coaches, run on 
the turnpike, and carriers, regular and occasional, complete the 
means of conveyance enjoyed by the inhabitants. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church, though not exactly 
centrical, is, from its situation, convenient for the great majority 
of the people. It is close to the village, as already mentioned, 
and even those at the greatest distance are within five miles of it. 
A range, therefore, of three miles at an average will include al- 
most the whole of the church-going population. The church was 
built in 1757, and is still a substantial, though an ill-constructed, 
building. The length is completely out of proportion to the 
breadth, and the whole building affords a specimen of the little 
attention formerly paid in the erection of churches both to the 
comfort and the acoustic powers of the congregation. It has ac- 
commodation for 477 sitters, and no seat-rents are on any pre- 
tence exacted. No sittings however are provided for the inhabi- 
tants of the village. The manse was built in 1817, and, in re- 
spect both of construction and situation, is as desirable a residence 
as any country manse in the present day. 

The extent of the glebe is about six acres, and its annual value 
L.12. The stipend, by a decree of the Court of Teinds, is fixed 
at 16 chalders, half meal, half barley, paid out of the teinds, 14 
wedders converted at L. 2, Is. 6d., L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion 
elements, and L.IO in lieu of a grass glebe. There are in this 
parish about L. 200 of unappropriated teinds. The patron and 
titular of the parish is Mr Brodie of Brodie. 

There is no chapel of ease, no Government church, and no 
missionary in the parish. There are two catechists employed by 
the kirk-session, with the consent and approval of the congrega- 
tion. One of these is partly paid by the Society for Propagating 
Christian Knowledge. There is a Dissenting meeting-house at 

3 



AULDEARN.

Boghole eonnected with the United Associate Secession. The 
charge is at present vacant. The clergyman is paid partly from 
the seat-rents, and partly from the collections or other contribu- 
tions of the congregation. The amount of his stipend is about 
L.80. The parish contains no Episcopalians, and but one Roman 
Catholic. 

The number of families attending the Established Church is 
about 260 ; the number of persons of all ages about 950. Divine 
service is generally well attended. The number of Dissenters, or 
of those who attend the Dissenting chapel, is 275. About one- 
third of these are not Dissenters, but attend merely from their 
proximity to that place of worship. The average number of com- 
municants at the Established Church is 164. 

There are no societies for religious objects exclusively paro- 
chial ; but there is a branch of the Nairnshire Bible Society, and 
a branch of the Presbytery of Nairn Missionary Society auxiliary 
to the schemes of the church. The amount annually contributed 
by the parish for these and other religious objects is about L.25. 
The average annual amount of church collections for the parochial 
poor is also L.25. 

Education. — There are two schools in the parish, one parochial, 
and one unendowed. The parochial schoolmaster has a good 
house, and a salary of L.36, 7s. 2d., including the allowance for a 
garden. The branches taught by him are, reading, English 
grammar, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, geography, land-sur- 
veying, and the other branches of mathematics, Latin, Greek, and 
French. All these, except the last three, are likewise taught at 
the unendowed school. 

There is scarcely a child in the parish between six and fifteen 
years of age that cannot read. There may be from twelve to 
fourteen persons above fifteen who cannot read. All are desirous 
to have their children educated, and there is no part of the parish 
so distant from a school that the benefits of education cannot be 
obtained. A school for the instruction of infants and of girls in 
those branches which belong to female education, is much wanted. 
The school-house, already mentioned as in the course of erection, 
is intended for this purpose ; but there is, as yet, no adequate pro- 
vision for a teacher. 

There is a Sabbath school library, and about 300 religious 
tracts distributed on loan. 

Charitable and other Institutions. — There have been two Friend- 

NAIRN. 



18 



NAIRNSHIRE. 



ly Societies established in the parish. Their object is to give aid 
to members when sick, or unable from age to work, and an allow- 
ance to widows. Each also allows L.4 to defray the funeral expenses 
of a member or member's wife. There was a Savings Bank kept 
by the minister of the parish for more than twenty years ; but, on 
the opening of a National Security Savings Bank at Nairn, the 
funds were in 1841 transferred to it, as a more convenient loca- 
lity for the depositors. The amount of the funds transferred wa&amp; 
about L.800. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of poor on 
the roll is 44. There are about six more who require occasional 
relief. The annual average allowance to each on the roll is 10s. 
The collections for their relief during the year, average as follow ; 
Church collections, after deducting payment of session-clerk, pre- 
centor, and kirk-officer, L. 13, Is.; received for the use of the 
mortcloth, L. 3, 10s.; contributed by the heritors, L. 6 ; total 
collected exclusively for the poor, L. 22, lis. The insane poor 
are entirely provided for by the heritors. There is no other re- 
gular mode of supporting the poor, but donations are sometimes 
given for their use by benevolent individuals connected with the 
parish. They are very unwilling to apply for parochial relief, and 
their relations often provide for them in order to save them from 
the necessity of such application. All admitted on the roll make 
aver to the session for the behoof of their survivors what property 
they may leave at death, deducting funeral expenses. Little is 
gained in this way, as none but those without property come upon 
the roll. 

There are no prisons in the parish. There are four fairs — St 
Colm's market, held the first Wednesday after 19th June; St 
John's, first Tuesday after the Inverness Martinmas market ; and 
two fairs, held respectively a fortnight and a month after St John's. 

There are four public-houses, three of which are in the village. 
Their effects on the morals of the people are decidedly injurious. 

Puel. — Three descriptions of fuel are used, — wood, peat, and 
coal. Almost all the parishioners have access to the mosses where 
peat is obtained. English coals are brought from Nairn. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
In comparing the present state of the parish with its state at the 
time of the former Statistical Account, several striking differences 
occur. During more than forty years that have elapsed since that 
pericd, agriculture, from being hampered by ancient prejudice and 

4 

I 



CAWDOR. 



19 



ancient skill, has attained a degree of improvement equal to what 
is exhibited by the most improved parts of the country. New roads 
have been made, the old so thoroughly altered for the better, and 
the means of communication thus so much increased, that the 
whole parish has of late risen greatly in improvement and value 
The rental is nearly doubled. Perhaps the most obvious improve- 
ment that could be introduced is some species of manufacture to 
give employment to the poor. But, though the parish affords 
abundant facilities for this, its distance from the nearest available 
harbour may be mentioned as the greatest hindrance to any such 
speculation. It is questionable, however, whether the introduction 
of manufactures would improve the morals of the people, whose 
religious character is very observable. The population of the pa- 
rish, according to the statement given above, has since 1797 been 
of varied amount. That of the village has considerably increas- 
ed. The diminution of the number of public-houses in the vil- 
lage, and the allocation of seats in the parish church to its inhabi- 
tants, would add materially to their comfort, and under the Divine 
blessing would prove the means of their social and religious im- 
provement.

PRESBYTERY OF NAIRN, SYNOD OF MORAY. 

THE REV. SIMON F. M'LAUCHLAN, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural Hjstory. 
Name. — The first name, at least the first recorded name, of this 
parish appears to have been " Barewen" or " Barivan Ewa7i 
being the saint to whose tutelar protection it was entrusted, and 
Bar, probably a corruption of Brae, as the old church, the walls 
of which are still extant, is situated in the upper and hilly part of 
the parish. For several hundred years, however, the parish, as 
such, has been known by the name of Calder or Cawdor. The 
former is the mode of pronouncing the word, common among the 
Gaelic part of the population now, and apparently from a remote 



20 



NAIRNSHIRE. 



period ; but It was known as Cawdor both to Hector Boece, the 
historian, and Shakspeare, and so was adopted as the family title, 
when, in 1796, the present Noble family of Cawdor was elevated 
to the Peerage, since which time this has become the general and 
recognized mode of spelling the name of the parish. In the an- 
cient Atlas of Blaeu, the name is given " Cathel,"— a form still 
used by many of the country people, who do not speak Gaelic, in 
the eastern parts of the parish and county. 

Extent, cc— Though the parish of Croy claims some detached 
parts on the south of the Nairn, this river may be considered the 
northern boundary of the parish of Cawdor. The length of the 
parish from west to east, along this river, is between 3 and 4 miles. 
Its breadth is very irregular, in some places not above a mile, m 
others 4 and 5 miles, while one offset stretches southward across 
the Findhorn river to a distance of more than 16 miles. The 
parish may be described as a cultivated plain of about a mile in 
breadth, and parallel with the Nairn, rising towards the south into 
ranges of hills of considerable elevation, which, for some distance 
up their sloping sides, are brought under tillage, above which, 
again, rise large plantations of wood, while these in their turn are 
succeeded by very wide tracts of brown and barren heath. 

Climate, — The climate is dry, mild, and agreeable, being, in 
some measure, sheltered by distance, and the intervening parishes 
of Nairn and Auldearn, from the piercing winds which blow off the 
German Ocean. 

In winter, snow seldom lies to any great depth, which may be 
owing partly to the little elevation of the land above the sea, not 
above 80 or 100 feet, in part also to its being walled in with hills 
to the south and west. Indeed, during the last two winters, there 
have been striking instances of snow falling to the depth of several 
feet to the east and west, while, at the same time, in this parish, 
the depth was not above a few inches. Perhaps the greatest de- 
gree of cold that has been experienced in this part of the island 
for many seasons, was felt on the 7th and 8th days of January of 
1841, when the mercury in Fahrenheit's thermometer was seen 
to sink within doors to about 5° below zero. As the soil is ge- 
nerally of a light description, the crops often suffer in summer 
from excessive drought. 

Hydrography. — The only river in the parish, if we except the 
Findhorn, which cuts through a narrow and remote neck of land 
to the south, is the small but often impetuous and destructive river, 

8 



CAWDOR. 



21 



al ready referred to, called the Nairn, which falls into the seaabou 
two miles below the point at which it leaves the parish. In passing 
through, it receives a tributary in the Burn of Cawdor, justly cele- 
brated for the great beauty and romantic scenery of its wooded 
banks, and on whose brink stands the old castle of the same name. 

The soil of the flat is generally an alluvial loam, seldom of a 
very rich nature, lying upon rolled debris of sand and gravel. The 
lower and nearer hills are composed of old red sandstone, with its 
associated coarse conglomerate. In the higher hills, however, to- 
wards the south and west, we find only gray gneiss, in many places, 
much shattered and contorted by granite veins. The junction of 
the old red sandstone with the gneiss is beautifully displayed in 
the bed of the Burn of Cawdor, about half a mile above Achneem. 

Botany. — There is nothing peculiar in the Flora of this parish, 
if we except a very interesting addition, not only to it, but to the 
Flora of Scotland, which was lately 24th August 1841 discover- 
ed in the wood of Cawdor, viz. Monotropa Hypopytis — a plant 
rare in England, and, it is believed, never before found in Scotland. 
Among the other varieties of the Flora of the parish may be par- 
ticularized : — 

Festiica calamaria Listera ovata Lycopus Europasus 

Milium efFusum Goodyera repens Rhinanthus major 

Convallaria majalis Aspletiium viride Hesperis matronalis 

Pyrola securida Scolopendrium vulgare Juncus balticus, &amp;c. 

Stellaria nemorum Lycopodium inuiidatum 

The soil and climate seem both peculiarly favourable to the 
growth of wood, the chief varieties of which make rapid progress, 
and, in many cases, attain a great size. 

II. — Civil History. 
The parish is in the hands of two proprietors ; the Right Ho- 
nourable the Earl of Cawdor, and Sir John Rose of Holme. Nei- 
ther is resident. The seat in Scotland of the family of Cawdor, 
long an influential one in this part of the country, is the old castle 
already alluded to, and which is one of the finest specimens, and 
in best preservation, of those ancient fortalices of the feudal barons, 
which still continue to frown over many of our plains. The li- 
cense to build it bears date 1393 ; but it appears not to have been 
completed for about half a century afterwards ; and several large 
additions were made in succeeding times. It is in a state of good 
repair, and is occupied by the family of the Noble owner, during 
their occasional visits to their northern estates. A tradition ex- 
ists, that King Duncan of Scotland was murdered here by Mac- 



22 



NAIRNSHIRE. 



beth. The room is shown in which the bloody deed was perpe- 
trated ; and until a few years ago, when it was accidentally de- 
stroyed by fire, a bed stood in this room, known as King- Duncan's 
bed. It is not improbable that the latter part of the tradition 
may be correct ; the fatal bed may in some way, and at some pe- 
riod, have been transferred to this castle ; and this, if so, will ac- 
count for the enlarged edition of the story which has descended 
to our times ; but considerable doubt may well be entertained as 
to the rest, when it is borne in mind that the worthy King was 
put to death nearly 400 years before the castle had a being. It 
is a piece of history more to be relied on, that the well known 
Lord Lovat of the Rebellion lay hid for some time from his pur- 
suers in a distant and secret apartment of this building. Sir 
Hugh Campbell of Calder, who lived at the close of the seven- 
teenth century, was a gentleman who took a very active part in 
ecclesiastical affairs. Although, we believe, a Presbyterian, he 
contended for the necessity of an injunction being laid upon the 
clergy to repeat the Lord's Prayer some time during the services 
of the Sabbath. To accomplish this object, he repeatedly ad- 
dressed letters to the presbytery of Inverness, to Principal Car- 
stairs of Edinburgh, and to the General Assembly, and finally 
published a work upon the subject ; copies of which are still oc- 
casionally to be met with. Mr Shaw, author of a very interesting 
and valuable work, the History of the Province of Moray, was, 
previous to his translation to Elgin, for a considerable period, mi- 
nister of this parish. It would appear, that, in the dark times of 
Charles II., the demon of persecution reached even this quiet and 
rural parish. A most interesting manuscript journal, kept by a Mrs 
Lilias Dunbar or Campbell, a native of, and resident in, the parish, 
still exists. This lady was a ward and relative of the family of Cal- 
der, lived in the castle, and afterwards married one of the cadets of 
the house, Mr Campbell of Torrich. She joined the Presbyterian 
party, was in the habit of hearing the outed ministers, and gives 
an account of perils encountered in this way ; among others, of 
her being carried away, and nearly drowned in crossing the swol. 
len river of Nairn there being no bridge, to hear the celebrated 
Mr Thomas Hogg, who used often to preach in the contiguous 
parish of Croy, especially at Kilravock. For her offences in this 
respect, she was seized, thrown into the Jail of Elgin, and was on 
the eve of being for ever banished her native land, when, oppor- 
tunely for her, the news arrived of the King's death, and she was 



CAWDOR. 



23 



released. The narrative is deeply interesting, both as containing 
an authentic account of some of the proceedings of those days, 
and also, and more especially, as indicating a mind not only im- 
bued with the deepest piety, but of superior power, and very con- 
siderable accomplishment. The language is more that of the 
present, than of the seventeenth century ; and the sentiment and 
style not unfrequently rise to great elevation and pathos. 

III. — Population. 

By the Government census taken this year 1841, the popu- 
lation of the parish is 1150, being a decrease of 37 since the 
census of 1831. The number of families is '270 ; of inhabited 
houses, 259. The average number of births per annum about 
30. No register of deaths is kept. There are 5 fatuous persons. 
The decrease in the population is small, and is confined to the 
Highland part of the parish. 

This parish forms the extreme limit of the Gaelic district in 
this direction, there being nothing but English spoken beyond its 
eastern boundary. Both languages, as might be expected from 
its position, are in very general use, although in their intercourse 
with each other, and in the services of religion, the peasantry still 
show a decided preference for the Gaelic. Notwithstanding the close 
neighbourhood of English, the increased opportunities of instruc- 
tion, and the rapidly growing intercourse with other parts of the 
empire, it is a remarkable circumstance, that the two languages 
seem to occupy relatively to each other nearly the same ground 
that they did from a remote period ; a fact which would seem to 
put the day far off, with regard to the Highlands in general, when 
the mountain-tongue shall, to any great extent, give place to the 
more cultivated, but not more expressive, language of the plain. 

The population is altogether rural, and engaged in agriculture ; 
and, the land not being too much subdivided, on the one hand, 
nor thrown into too large farms, on the other, the people enjoy 
the comforts and advantages common to their class elsewhere. 
They are on the whole cleanly in their habits, and their dwellings 
have been of late years much improved. Their general character 
is that of a sober, regular, and well-disposed people, among whom 
no open vices prevail to any extent, and over whom religion exerts 
a considerable influence. 

IV. — Industry. 
As already observed, agriculture is here the chief employment; 
and it is gratifying to observe the rapid improvement which is tak- 



24 



NAIRNSHIRE. 



ing place in this branch of industry, making itself apparent in the 
improved appearance of the country. A regular system of rota- 
tion of crop the six-shift is enforced; and lime is coming much 
into use. More attention, too, is paid to improving the breed of 
cattle. These changes are owing partly to the advancing intelli- 
gence of the farmers themselves, partly to the general spirit of im- 
provement abroad, and in no small degree to the exertions of the 
Nairnshire Farming Society, which holds an annual meeting in the 
parish, and awards premiums for the best of the various descrip- 
tions of stock. 

Tbe number of arable acres may be about . 2,400 
Under pasture and moor, . 22,278 

Underwood, . . . 2,200 

The rent per arable acre ranges from L.l to L.l, 10s. Farms 
range in size from L. 15 to L.l 90 of rent. The general duration 
of leases is nineteen years. A common labourer's wages are, in 
winter, Is. 4d., in summer, 2s. per day; those of a tradesman, 2s. 
to 2s. 6d. Provisions, such as meal, potatoes, &amp;c. are in general 
cheap. The woods in the parish consist partly of indigenous, 
partly of planted timber. The indigenous wood is oak, ash, birch, 
fir, and alder; the planted, beech, lime, larch, sycamore, and elm 

V. Parochial Economy. 

The parish lying off the great lines of communication with the 
south and east, there are no public conveyances passing through 
it, the nearest point of their course being the town of Nairn, which 
is six miles distant from the parish church. All the roads are 
district roads, which are kept in a tolerable state of repair. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church, which is quite centrical, 
was built in the year 1619, in consequence of a vow, made 
by the then laird of Calder, when overtaken by a storm at 
sea, that, should a kind Providence bring him safe to shore, 
his first business on reaching home would be to erect a church 
more convenient for the parishioners than the one then in 
existence. It underwent a very extensive repair in 1830, when 
it was also considerably enlarged, and is seated for 638 per- 
sons. The manse, an excellent and commodious house, was 
built in 1831. The glebe contains from nine to ten acres of 
land, mostly arable, and may be worth about L. 10 per annum. A 
catechist is employed, who is supported by the parish. The people 
are all warmly attached to the Established Church, and there is 
but one Pissenting family in the parish, not natives of it. Great 



CAWDOil. 



25 



regularity prevails in attendance on public worship, which is con- 
ducted in Gaelic and Enghsh. The communicants are from 80 
to 90 in number. Stipend about L. 170. 

There are two religious associations to which the parish in ge- 
neral contiibutes. The one a Bible, the other a Missionary Society. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The church collections for the 
poor amount to about L. 25 per annum, besides which there are 
no other parochial funds. About a similar sum is collected an- 
nually for other charitable and religious purposes. The number 
on the poor's roll is 50. 

Clothing Societij.—A penny a -week clothing Society is support- 
ed in the parish by the Countess of Cawdor, upon a plan well de- 
serving extensive imitation. A penny is contributed weekly by 
each poor person on the list, to which another is added by the be- 
nevolent promoter of the scheme. With this sum, which, in the 
course of a year, amounts to 8s. 8d. for each person, there is pur- 
chased at the beginning of winter such articles of clothing as they 
severally find most requisite. The number on the list here at 
present is 50, but this might vary according to circumstances. 
The clothing is purchased for the poor, and in no case is the money 
entrusted to themselves. By this plan, charity is prudently and 
usefully dispensed, while, at the same time, habits of thriftiness 
and forethought are cultivated in the minds of those who are ad- 
mitted to the benefit. Of course, wherever acted on, some suitable 
individual must be appointed to take charge of the vieekly deposits, 
procure the clothing, and take the general management of the 
scheme. 

Education. — There are four schools in the parish, all more or 
less endowed. The parish school enjoys the maximum salary ; 
the fees vary from L. 10 to L. 14 per annum. The children of 
paupers are taught at reduced rates. Another school has lately 
been established by the society for Propagating Christian Know- 
ledge. The two others are sewing and reading schools, taught 
by females ; one endowed by the Right Honourable the Countess 
of Cawdor, and the other by the above-mentioned society. With 
the exception of a very few old people, there are none but can read, 
and the majority can write. 

Means of Communication. — There is a penny-post in the village 
of Cawdor, where a considerable daily increase of letters has ta- 
ken place since the reduction of the postage rates. 

Inns. — There is one inn, and two licensed spirit-shops. 



26 



NAIRNSHIRE. 



Distillery. — The well-known Brackla distillery, which is the 
only one in Scotland, we believe, privileged to use the Royal arms, 
and supply the Royal table, has been in operation on an extensive 
scale in the parish for manv years. 

Fuel. — Two large peat mosses supply the people with fuel, but 
coal taken from the sea port of Nairn is chiefly used by the bet- 
ter classes.

PRESBYTERY OF NAIRN, SYNOD OF MORAY. 

• THE REV. HUGH MACBEAN, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The name Ardclach is Gaelic, signifying high stony 
ground. 

Extent. — The extreme length of the parish is 13 miles, and its 
extreme breadth about 8 miles. It contains in all about 65 square 
miles. 

Boundaries — It is bounded on the north by the parishes of 
Nairn and Auldearn ; on the east, by Edenkillie ; on the south, by 
Cromdale and Duthil ; and on the west, by Cawdon Its figure 
is extremely irregular, and its character generally mountainous, 
and in many parts very romantic. 

Climate. — The high and exposed situation of the parish, desti- 
tute to a great extent of the shelter of wood, renders the climate 
cold, and causes the winter to be long-continued. But the dis- 
trict is notwithstanding healthy. The prevalent distempers are 
said to be rheumatism and erysipelas. 

Hydrography. — The parish is throughout its extent abundant- 
ly supplied with excellent water. Many of the springs are chaly- 
beate. 

There is one fine lake, situated on the property of Lethen, cal- 



ARDCL ACH. 



27 



led the Loch of Belivat, covering an area of 27 acres, and re- 
markable for having no known or perceptible stream running into 
or out of it. It has a small island in the centre ; and is well sup- 
plied with excellent trout, averaging about 2 lbs. in weight, and 
of three distinct kinds, one of which is peculiarly remarkable for 
the deep redness of its flesh. 

The river Findhorn, which takes its rise in the Monad-leah 
group of moimtains in Inverness-shire, and, running in a north- 
easterly direction, discharges itself into the Moray Firth, at the 
port of Findhorn, flows for about thirteen miles through the parish 
of Ardclach, increased in its progress by a number of mountain- 
streams, viz. the burns of Torgarrow, Drumlochan, and Tom- 
narroch from the south, and the burn of Altnarie from the north. 
On the burn of Torgarrow, near the farm of Lynemore there is 
a beautiful cascade, and another on the burn of Altnarie, upon 
the estate of Lethen. The fall of Altnarie is of considerable 
height, and the beauty and highly romantic character of the deep- 
ly wooded and secluded glen in which it is situated, renders it a 
great attraction to the lover of the picturesque. 

The Burn of Lethen, or Muckle Burn, is a considerable stream, 
which takes its rise in the south-west of this parish, and flows 
through it for about ten miles, in a direction nearly parallel to 
the Findhorn, which it ultimately joins, within about two miles of 
its mouth. 

Geology. — The general character of the parish is sub -alpine, 
and the prevailing rocks belong to the primary series. Of these, 
some magnificent sections are made on the eastern side of the pa- 
rish, by the river P'indhorn, on whose banks, — particularly at Dul- 
cie. Fairness, Altnarie, and Coulmony, — are spots whose rocky 
scenery and woodland beauty may bear comparison with the most 
romantic to be found in Scotland. The rocks along the course 
of the Findhorn are granite, gneiss, and quartz. On the western 
limit of the parish, the burn of Lethen has cut for itself a deep 
channel from west to east, through the lowest division of the old 
red sandstone formation, and has exposed the schistose sandstone, 
containing impressions of plants, apparently marine fucoids, but 
species not determined, resting on the conglomerate ; and nodules 
containing imperfect remains of fishes are also got here. But, at 
Lethenbar, on the brow of the hill, a short distance south of the 
bed of the stream, the remarkable fish bed of the lowest division 
of the old red sandstone crops out at the surface. The ichthyo- 



I

lites, or fossil remains of fishes, are enclosed in nodules, or flat 
elliptical bodies, of fibro-carbonate of lime, and imbedded in a 
loamy shale, which overlays a schistose sandstone, having vegetable 
mipressions. The nodules are composed of the purest lime, and, 
when burned, yield excellent shells for manure or building pur- 
poses. They run so much into each other as to present a pretty 
thick bed of compact limestone, which is found highly useful, and 
burned to a considerable extent, principally for manure to newly 
improved land. The fossil contents of these nodules have lately 
excited much curiosity and attention in the scientific world. The 
fishes they contain are in a state of perfect preservation, — every 
scale and fin, in many of them, remaining in their places. They 
are believed to have been inhabitants of the sea, but the very ge- 
nera to which they belonged are now totally extinct, viz. Coc« 
coste/s, Pterichtlujs, Cheirolepis, Cheiracanthm, Diplocanthus, Os- 
teolepis, Gyrolepis, besides others which, though discovered, have 
not been hitherto named. Many geologists are assiduous in their 
investigations into this subject, and the locality is already distin- 
guished in the annals of geology. The burn of Lethen, in its 
downward course, cuts through and exposes sections of the newer 
beds of the old red sandstone, in which fossil remains of fishes, — 
totally different from those of Lethenbar, Clune, and that neigh- 
bourhood, — have been discovered ; but these sections are beyond 
the boundaries of the parish. 

The strata of the rocks of the primary series, forming, as has 
been said, the prevailing rocks of the parish, are generally placed 
at a high angle, dipping in various directions. Those of the old 
red sandstone dip to the north-west, at an angle of 14°. The 
sandstone strata have undergone little disturbance, no trap dikes, 
or other indications of volcanic agency, occurring in the parish. 
The sandstone beds are not of great thickness, so far as hitherto 
exposed. 

No mineralogical survey has ever been made of the parish ; and 
no metallic ores to any extent have been discovered, though indica- 
tions of iron and manganese have been observed. Neither have 
any simple minerals of value been detected. 

The upper or alpine division of the parish, belonging to the 
primary series of rocks, has but a scanty covering of alluvial mat- 
ter or vegetable mould for the support of herbage, and yet trees 
of luxuriant growth find rooting among the crevices of the rocks. 
But the alluvial deposits at the sides of the rivers and streams, 



ARDCLACII.

provincially called haughs, holms, and straths, are very fertile. In 
the lower or northern division, where the sandstone beds are cut 
through by the burn of Lethen, the thickness of diluvial matter, 
sand, and gravel, exceeds 300 feet. Over the whole surface of 
the table-land of the parish are strewed erratic blocks of granite 
and gneiss, which are mostly water-worn, and have apparently 
been transported from considerable distances, as they differ in li- 
thological character from the rocks in the neighbourhood. Peat- 
mosses also abound in the table-land. 

Zoology. — Red-deer are now seldom seen in the parish of Ard- 
clach, but roe-deer are numerous. The common and alpine hares 
are abundant; and rabbits have of late years found their way into 
the parish, and are excessively injurious to the young plantations. 
Foxes, badgers, polecats, foulmarts, and weasels are plentiful ; 
but the wild-cat is now seldom met with. The otter is occasion- 
ally trapped on the banks of the Findhorn, and brown and scaly 
lizards frequent the moors. The common viper or adder, and 
Anguis fragilis, inhabit the weedy districts and rocks of the river. 

Of rapacious birds the most common are the common buzzard, 
kite, sparrowhawk, ringtail, and kestril, common and horned owls, 
ravens and hooded crows. 

Black game and grouse are abundant ; and heron, partridges, 
woodcock, snipe, curlew, plover, and wild-pigeons are also found. 
Wild-duck and teal frequent the marshes; and innumerable sea- 
fowl and other aquatic birds nestle on the islands in the Loch of 
Belivat. 

Salmon is still caught in considerable quantity, but was former- 
ly so abundant in the parish, that it was common for servants, en- 
tering on an engagement with any family resident on the banks of 
the Findhorn, to stipulate that they should not be fed upon salmon 
beyond a stated number of days in the week. 

Botany. — The woodland scenery of the parish is well deserving 
of notice. At Coulmony and Lethen are to be seen trees of large 
dimensions, and stateliest growth, of beech, elm, sycamore, birch, 
alder, pine, and others, besides extensive plantations of more re- 
cent date. Towards the upper part of the parish, along the banks 
of the Findhorn, scattered remnants still exist, among the cliffs, of 
the great Caledonian forest of the red Scotch pine. These mag- 
nificent trees send forth their widely-spread branches, clothed in 
the darkest foliage, in a manner which gives them a picturesque 
charsfcter never to be met with in Lowland artificial plantations.

The prevailing shrubby plants of the upper division of the parish are, 
Calluna vulgaris, Erica Tetralix, E. cinerea, Ilex Aquifolium, Juni- 
perus communis, Rosa canina, Rubus idceus, and several dwarf spe- 
cies of Salix. In the lower division, where the surface is encum- 
bered by a thick mass of diluvial sand and gravel, the distinguish- 
ing shrubby plants are, Cgtisus Scoparius, Ulex EuropcBus, Genista 
anglica, &amp;c. In the upper division, ferns or brackens form the 
most plentiful undergrowth in the ravines and precipitous bank'. 
Of these the spreading " bracken curtain," Pteris aquilina, is the 
most abundant; and the elegant Asplenium viride is not unfre-' 
quent. There are also, where water is stagnant, Pinguicula vul- 
garis, Trollius Europjceus, and Pedicularis palustris. The roman- 
tic banks of the Findhorn contain treasures for the botanist which 
it would be endless to enumerate ; and, with very few exceptions, 
the whole woodland flora of the two counties of Elgin and Nairn 
might be gathered within the parish. A few of the more rare are, 
V eronica montana. Milium effusum, Melica nutans, Fesiuca calama- 
ria, Pyrola minor, and Stellaria nemorum. All the culinary or pot 
herbs are foreign introductions. Some of the flowers of wild plants 
were formerly used by the peasants as dyes for cloth ; but they 
have fallen into total disuse. 

II. — Civil History. 
A large portion of this parish formerly belonged to the family 
of Falconer of Halkerton, now Earls of Kintore, who held it at 
least as early as the year 1295, and continued to possess it till the 
commencement of the seventeenth century, when they sold it to 
Grant of Freuchie, ancestor of the present Earl of Seafield, from 
whom again it was purchased, with a variety of other lands, in 
1634, by Alexander Brodie of Lethen, second son of David, Laird 
of Brodie. Another, but much smaller, portion of the parish has 
been for centuries in the possession of the family of Campbell of 
Calder, now Earls of Cawdor. And a third portion, situated on 
the south bank of the Findhorn, now the property of George 
Montgomery Cuninghame, Esq. of Fairness, belonged of old to 
the family of Rose of Kih-avock, who again had acquired it, at a 
period still more distant, partly from the Dunbars of Cunzie and 
Kilbuyack, and partly from Patrick Hepburn, Bishop of Morav. 
The remainder of the parish consists of the lands of Mid-Fleenes 
and Acharait,now belonging to Colonel Gordon of Cluny ; the 
lands of Dallasbrachty and Craigcroy, which belonged in 1526 
to James Dunbar of Cunzie and Kilbuyack, and are now the pro- 



ARDCLACH.

perty of Sir William G. G. Gumming, Bart, of Altyre ; and the 
lands of Glenernie, which were possessed for several generations 
by the Erasers of Glenernie, a branch of the family of Lovat, and 
now belong to Charles Lenox Gumming Bruce, Esq. of Roseisle 
and Dunphail. 

The history of the parish is but little interwoven with the civil 
history of the county. It appears, however, from some old un- 
printed Statutes of the Parliament of Scotland, to have shared large- 
ly in the troubles of the Covenanting period, and that, after the bat- 
tle of Auldearn in 1645, the lands of Brodie of Lethen, who had 
strongly attached himself to the cause of the Covenant, were burnt 
and plundered by the victorious Marquis of Montrose, after he had 
besieged without success the old fortalice of Lethen. Afterwards, 
says the same statute, which was passed on the 15th of March 
1649, " the late Marqueis of Huntly and his sones, with twa thow- 
sand fute and horse, beseidged the Hons anew the space of twelfe 
weikes ; but, being disappointit and enragit throw the loss of many 
of y"" men, at last did utterlie burne over againe the haill lands, 
y'upon ther was above ye number of eight scoire persons, and left 
not ten of them to remaine." The same estate was aain laid 
waste in 1658, after another unsuccessful attack upon the old tower 
of Lethen, by a detachment under the command of Sir Mungo 
Murray, of the army of the Earl of Glencairn, who then held a 
commission in Scotland from Charles II., to whom Lethen's Co- 
venanting principles rendered him obnoxious, notwithstanding he 
had not only assisted the State with loans of money, but had fought 
personally in the army raised by the Scottish Covenanters for the 
King, both in the engagement at Lestwick, and at the battle of 
Dunbar.

Antiquities. — There is a curious obelisk, situated in a haugh on 
Glenfairness, on the river side, and about a mile below the old 
bridge of Dulcie. Characters somewhat similar to those on Sue-

NAIRNSHIRK. 



no's Pillar, near Forres, are sculptured on it, but it is scarcely 
half the height of the Forres obelisk. The sculpture is nearly the 
same on both sides of the stone, but in the lowest compartment 
on one of them are two figures, seemingly in the Highland dress, 
and in the attitude of embrace. There is no trace of any writing, 
and tradition describes it to be a memorial of the unhappy fate of 
a Celtic princess, who eloped with a Danish lover, and was pur- 
sued to the birch-covered hill, called the Doune of Dunearn, on 
the verge of the Findhorn, from which, to avoid their pursuers, 
they precipitated themselves into the river, and perished together. 

On the line of the old military road from Fort- George to Perth, 
made by General Wade, which passes through the parish, there 
is the fine old bridge of Dulcie, crossing the Findhorn, and situ- 
ated in a most romantic spot,— the rocky and precipitous, but 
deeply wooded, banks of the river, the dark hue of its rapid stream, 
and the bold arch of the old bridge itself, combining with the 
character of the scenery around it to form a truly beautiful land- 
scape. 

On the summit of the hill of Lethenbar, which stands 862 
feet above the level of the sea, in latitude 57° 31' 24" north, lon- 
gitude 3° 44 38" west, there is a very perfect Druidical circle, and 
in its immediate neighbourhood are numerous tumuli, 

Mansioi-Houses.— The on]y mansion-house within the parish is 
Coulmony House, the property of Mr Brodie of Lethen. On a tablet 
over the door is inscribed the date 1746. It is situated on the banks 
of the Findhorn, and the scenery around is justly celebrated for its 
highland beauty. The late Sir James Montgomery Cuning- 
hame commenced to build a mansion-house on his estate of 
Fairness, on the opposite bank of the river ; but unhappily he did 
not live to finish it.

The people of the parish are, generally speaking, rather above 
than below the middle size ; and are a strong and hardy race, 
capable of enduring much fatigue. They are ruddy and healthy 
in complexion, and chiefly black and yellow-haired ; but there are 
some families whose hair is generally fair, and who were former- 
ly termed " Bain," " Riach," or " Roy," according to the depth 
of the shade of yellow or red. In these last families, the Chris- 
tian names of Sweyne" or " Sueton," « Evan," and « Gillies," 
has prevailed for ages, from generation to generation, evidently 
indicating their Scandinavian descent. 

The number of insane or fatuous persons in the parish is two. 

The language now generally spoken is English; but in the upper 
or southern district of the parish they continue to speak the native " 
Gaelic, though, within the last forty years, it has been gradually 
losing ground ; and, even in the upper district, the people, with few 
exceptions, now speak both Gaelic and English with almost equal 
facility. On the Sabbath, there are two services at the parish 
church, one in Gaelic, and the other in English. 

The people are industrious, and have greatly improved in their 
habits of cleanliness. At church and market they equal, in de- 
cency of appearance, any of their own rank in Scotland. Their 
dress is home-made, the linen or cloth being usually spun by the 
female members of the family, or woven by some country weaver. 
In former days, the men, instead of stockings, wore hose made of 
tartan cloth, called " caddas," with party-coloured garters, the 
kilt, and the pointed or Glengarry bonnet, and brogues with 
freuchans, — every family being their own tanners, and, generally, 
their own shoemakers. The dirk, the sporran, and skian-dhu, 
were worn on gala days. Now, the Highland dress has given 
place to stuffs from the manufacturer ; but the plaid is still re- 
tained, and frequently the Highland bonnet. In former times, 
the shirts in general use were made of woollen cloth called " plaid- 
ing," which has now given place to cotton and linen ; but, with 
the latter, have been introduced rheumatism, and other diseases,

said to have been unknown to their forefathers. In their mode of 
dress, the women differ little, if at all, from their northern neigh- 
bours. In former times, the younger women wore the snood, and, 
out of doors, in bad weather, a small handkerchief. Now the cap 
is common among them, and, in many instances, straw bonnets, 
which bid fair to supersede all other head dresses. The matrons 
or elderly women wore formerly the " toy," which consisted of 
two long broad stripes of linen attached to a cap fitted close to the 
head. Now they wear the ordinary " mutch," which is still pre- 
ferred by the more elderly women to bonnets, which would be con- 
sidered by most of them unbecoming their station. Cotton, mus- 
lin, and other manufactured stuffs now form the greater part of 
the female dress of the district; but the tartan, linsey-woolsey, 
and russet, of the olden time, have not fallen wholly into desuetude. 

The ordinary food of the peasantry is plain and simple. For 
breakfast, they take pottage made of oatmeal, and, in some cases, 
where it can be afforded, they use tea. Their dinner consists, 
variously, of potatoes and milk, sowans kale and brose ; and more 
rarely, of fish or broth, and animal food. A drink, called broch- 
' an or gruel, suffices for supper, which, like all their other meals, is 
generally concluded with cakes of oatmeal, and milk. Living fru- 
gally, they are generally happy and contented with their circum- 
stances, and enjoy the comforts common to their station. 

The peasantry are kind, obliging, and hospitable, especially to 
strangers, whom they readily welcome to their simple fare. But 
they are hasty in temper, and prompt to resent an injury or af- 
front, real or supposed. Family feuds, which were formerly kept 
up among them, and caused many a broken head at markets and 
other gatherings, are now fast wearing away. They are not defi- 
cient in intelligence, or in moral and religious feeling, — which 
is fostered by their habit of worshipping God in their families, and 
giving regular attendance at -church. 

Poaching in game may prevail to some extent ; and smuggling 
also, which was formerly more frequent, may still take place occa- 
sionally, but very rarely.

Planting — The planted wood in the parish consists principally 
of Scotch fir and larch ; but there is also some little hard-wood. 
The only plantations of any extent, formed within the last thirty 
years, are those on the property of Glenfairness, by the late 
Sir James Montgomery Cuninghame. They consist chiefly of 
larch, with a sprinkling of common Scotch fir, and some hard 
wood in the low sheltered dells ; and are extremely thriving. 
There are several older plantations on the Lethen estate ; and par- 
ticularly, a considerable forest of fir, called the wood of Dulcie, 
which is almost wholly indigenous. The indigenous trees are 
Scotch pine or fir {Pinus sylvestris ; common birch, {Betula al- 
ba and weeping birch; alder, {Alnus glutinosa ; hazel, {Cory- 
lusavellana ; aspen or trembling poplar, Populus tremula ; bird- 
cherry, Prumis padus ; sloe or black-thorn, Prunus spinosa ; 
mountain-ash or roan, {Pyrus aucuparia ; holly, [Ilex aquifoli- 
vm ; and willow. Alders formerly succeeded well along the 
banks of the river and larger burns, and attained to a great size ; 
but, of late years, they are decaying in this as in other parishes, 
though the cause of their ceasing to thrive is unknown. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of arable land in the parish 
is about 10s. per acre. In the upper part of the parish grazing 
for a cow on inland and green pasture is 12s., and for a stot on 
hill-ground, 3s. 6d. to 5s. In the lower district of the parish, the 
ground is more valuable, carries larger animals, and pUts them into 
better condition, and will bring 4s. or 5s. additional. The hillv 
ground, in the upper district, and the " streens" is the only ground 
occupied by sheep ; and there the charge for a year's keep of one 
sheep is 2s. 

Wages. — The average rates of labour for farm-labourers and

country artisans are as follows: ploughmen per half-year, L.5; 
women-servants, L.2 per half-year, with food; day-labourers, Is. 
2d. per day in winter, and Is. 6d. in summer; women per day, 
7d. ; carpenters, Is. 6d. per day in winter, and 2s. in summer ; 
masons, 2s. 6d. per day in summer ; — they do not work in winter. 

Price of Produce. — The average price of produce is much the 
same as in the adjoining parishes. Wheat, L.2, 10s. per imperial 
quarter; oats, L.1 per quarter; barley, L.l, 10s. per quarter; 
potatoes. Is. per bushel; turnips, L.5, 10s. per acre; hay, 3s. 4d. 
per cwt. ; cheese, 4d. per lb. ; butter, 8d. per lb. ; beef and mut- 
ton, 4d. per lb. ; eggs, 3d. to 3|d. per dozen in summer, and 6d. 
in winter; fowls. Is. each. 

Breed o/Live-StocL — The breed of sheep, some thirty years 
ago, was the old Scotch sheep, having brown faces and legs, short 
wool, and wide-spreading horns. These gave place to a black- 
faced Highland breed, with pretty long horns, snow tops, or tufts 
of wool on the forehead, and an open and very coarse fleece of 
long wool. This last breed is now greatly improved by superior 
tups Lintons, brought principally from Lanarkshire every year, 
having no tufts on the forehead, a much closer and better fleece, 
and more compact barrel-shaped bodies. The horns of the we- 
thers, instead of spreading high, keep close down by the head on 
either side, so as nearly to resemble a horse- shoe. This last breed 
is much more esteemed by turnip-feeders than the coarse and open- 
woolled kind ; but a few even of the ancient Scotch breed are still 
to be found, perfectly pure, on two or three farms in the lower end 
of the parish, where there is not sufficient range for the black- 
faced mountain sheep. This ancient breed is, however, nearly 
extinct. The practice of annually smearing in autumn, with tar 
and butter, each individual of the mountain flocks, has only of 
late become general in the few and limited sheep-walks in this 
parish ; but it is found to be a great improvement, as it completely 
protects the animal against the most inclement weather. 

The cattle are of small size, but hardy and well-formed, and 
are well cared for, — the inhabitants having been always remarkable 
for their attention to cattle and skill in rearing them. They are 
yearly improving in size and condition by better and more plenti- 
ful keep ; though, generally speaking, the land is somewhat over- 
stocked. On the whole, it would, perhaps, be difficult to intro- 
duce a breed either of cattle or sheep more suitable in all respects 
to the district than those it at present possesses.

Hushandry. — The improvement in tlie mode of farminjr in this pa- 
rish, within the last few years, is most marked and decided. Previous 
to 1831, very few of the tenantry followed any regular rotation of 
cropping. The land nearest their steadings was kept constantly in til- 
lage, receiving the whole manure of the farms, and cropped with bar- 
ley or bear, potatoes, and a few drills of turnips, which was followed 
by grain crops, year after year, as long as they were worth shear- 
ing. The land farthest from the steadings was cropped with three 
or four, and sometimes more, grain crops, in close succession, and 
was then abandoned, to remain for seven years or upwards in a 
state of nature, overgrown with weeds, and totally unproductive. 
It was then " tathed" by folding cattle or sheep upon it, broken 
up, and cropped as before. In consequence of this mode of farm- 
ing, the tenants, as may well be supposed, were reduced to a low 
ebb. But their condition has been ameliorated, and the husbandry 
of the parish immensely improved, by the course which has been 
pursued in the management of his property, by James C. Brodie, 
Esq. of Lethen and Coulmony, who succeeded to those estates in 
1829, and became resident in the parish during the following year. 
Mr Brodie has encouraged his tenants to lay off their farms, whe- 
ther large or small, in regular shifts ; and they now follow gene- 
rally a six-shift course, raising green crops and sowing grass-seeds 
in regular rotation as follows; — 1. grass; 2. grass; 3. oats; 4. 
oats ; 5. green crop ; 6. grain, with grass-seeds. To render this 
system successful it was necessary to supply the tenants with hme, 
and lime was given them on credit, — those of smaller holdings be- 
ing employed in carting the thinnings of the plantations to the 
shipping port of Nairn, and carrying along with them orders for 
lime, which they brought home to their fields, instead of returning 
with empty carts. They were further supplied, also on credit, with 
superior seed-corn, instead of resowing, year after year, the pro- 
duce of their own land ; and, wherever any additional accommo- 
dation was required in their houses, new buildings were erected of 
good masonry, and according to regular and approved plans. The 
result of this system has been most beneficiah The husbandry of 
the parish and the condition and circumstances of the tenantry are 
vastly improved. The old turf hovels are everywhere fast disap- 
pearing ; the smallest crofter now aims at building his comfortable 
and substantial cottage of stone and lime ; and the larger tenants 
proceed, as suits their convenience, with the erection of their 
houses and regular squares of offices, their old houses being some- 



38 



NAIUNSHIIIE. 



times still left standing, scattered and unconnected, and strangely 
contrasting with the cleanliness and compactness of all else around. 
Instead of a poor tenantry, largely in arrear, and paying what they 
did with difficulty, their rents are now regularly paid, and arrears 
unknown, while they themselves are thriving apace, and feeling in- 
dependent through successful industry. There is now, perhaps, 
nowhere, in any upland district, a more industrious and prosperous 
tenantry than the generality of those in the parish of Ardclach. 

Duration of Leases. — The ordinary duration of leases in the 
parish is nineteen years. 

Farm-Buildings and Indosures. — The farm-buildings, till of 
}ate years, were in wretched condition. They are now rapidly 
improving; and many new steadings getting up, built of stone and 
lime, and roofed with slate, or sometimes with heather, which, 
when properly put on, makes a durable and neat thatch. The 
only enclosures in the parish are at Coulmony, where they are 
constructed of stone, supplied with iron gates, and in excellent 
order. The principal agricultural improvements recently made 
in the parish have been made by Mr Brodie of Lethen, on the 
mains of Coulmony, and upon moorish ground, on the hill called 
the Shaw, upon the estate of Lethen, at an elevation of nearly 
800 feet above the level of the sea. In these improvements, the 
Deanston system of thorough draining has been carried into effect 
with complete success ; and a neat and substantial square of offices 
has been built upon the farm. Much, also, though on a smaller 
scale, has been accomplished by the tenants themselves, who are 
now quite alive to the advantages derivable from well-directed ex- 
ertion. 

Manufactures. — There are no manufactures in the parish, be- 
yond a little tartan, and plaiding, and linsey-woolsey, which is 
manufactured for home use. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market- Towns, c. — There is no market-town or village within 
the parish itself. The nearest market-towns are, Nairn, which is 
about ten miles from the manse, and Forres, about twelve miles. 

Means of Communication. — There is no post-office nearer than 
Nairn. No turnpike road passes through the parish ; but it is 
intersected by the county road from Nairn to Grantown, and by 
branches of other county roads, as well as of one of those under 
the charge of the Parliamentary Commissioners. A great deal 
has been done of late years in the improvement of district roads,

and making new ones; but much tliat requires to be done is still 

unaccomplished. 

There are three stone bridges over the Findhorn, viz. one at 
Dulcie, one at Glenfairness, and a third at Daltulich. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish of Ardclach is not made men- 
tion of before the Reformation, previous to which era the places 
of worship resorted to by the inhabitants were two chapels, one 
at Fairness, and the other at Lethen. After the Reformation, 
Ardclach is mentioned as a vicarage, of which the parson of Raf- 
ford, as sub-chanter of Moray, was patron. Thereafter it became a 
distinct parish, which, however, it did not long continue, having been 
united in 1618 to the kirk of Edenkillie, and those two kirks 
being appointed to be served per vices by one minister. This 
junction of the parishes continued for somewhat upwards of thirty 
years ; but, during the latter part of that period, it was strongly 
represented against, though the united parishes were by that time 
supplied with two ministers. Representations against the junction 
were made to the two General Assemblies holden at Edinburgh 
in August 1639, and August 164J, and the last of these assem- 
blies gave in a representation to Parliament, which, however, lay 
over unattended to till 1650, in which year the parish of Ardclach, 
as it now exists, was, by Decree of Piatt, dated 13th February 
1650, for the first time erected, by the disjunction of the Old 
Parish from Edenkillie, and the annexation to it of the following 
lands, formerly in the parish of Auldearn, viz. " the lands of Le- 
thinbar, Fornighty, Fleenesnagall, Achamore, and Achavelgin, be- 
loncinJ to Alexander Brodie of Lethin ; and Middle Fleenes, 
and Achnatone, belonging to William Rose of Clava, and Hugh 
Rose, fiar thereof." 

Ardclach, before the Restoration, belonged to the presbytery 
of Forres. After the Revolution, and the re-establishment of 
Presbyterianism, it became part of what was called the presbytery 
of Moray, which existed from 1690 to 1702, and comprehended 
the whole diocese of Moray. In 170'2, it became part of the 
united presbyteries of Inverness and Forres ; and, when those 
presbyteries were separated in 1708, it became part of the pres- 
bytery of Forres, and so continued till 1773, in which year it, 
along with Auldearn, was disjoined from Forres, and contributed 
to form the presbytery of Nairn, which then became a presbytery 
for the first time. 

The parish church of Ardclach is placed in the centre of the

NAIRNSHIRE. 



cluirch-yard or burying-ground, which lies in a deep valley or 
liauorh on the north side of the Findhorn, at some little distance 
above the bridge of Fairness. The situation, on the whole, is 
perhaps the most convenient that could be chosen. Its distance 
from the extremity of the parish, on the north, is about five-and-a- 
half miles ; on the south, eight miles ; on the west, eight miles ; 
and, on the east, also eight miles ; the extreme point on the east 
being on the lands of Sir W. Gumming and Major Gumming 
Bruce, which lay stretched beyond the rest of the parish, near 
the confines of Knockando, and have the parish of Edenkillie in- 
terjected between them and the rest of Ardclach. The church 
was built in 1626, rebuilt in 1762, and again rebuilt in 1839, at 
a cost of above L.500. It affords accommodation for 686 sitters. 
The present manse was built in 1744; repaired, and an addition 
made to it in 1816 ; and again repaired in 1841. The extent of 
the glebe is 7 acres, and the annnual value of it L.5. 

The present stipend was modified in 1816, decree dated 4th 
July 1821, and amounts to 14 chalders victual, half meal half 
barley, standard measure, with L.8, 6s. 8d. Sterling, for commu- 
nion elements. In the course of the Locality which followed upon 
the augmentation of 1816, the Nairnshire barley firlot was more 
than once experimented upon, with great care and precision, 
by the late Professor Leslie, under the orders of the Gourt of 
Teinds, and was found to be precisely 4| per centum larger than 
the Linlithgow or standard firlot. 

The gradual advance of the stipend of the parish during the last 
two centuries affords a curious picture of its progress. When the 
two parishes of Ardclach and Edenkillie were united by the Teind 
Commissioners, on 14th July 1618, the stipend of " the minis- 
ter serving the cure at the united kirks" was fixed at 520 merks 
Scots, or L.28, 17s. 9fd. Sterling. This continued till 1650, 
when the united parishes were again disjoined, the present parish 
of Ardclach erected, and a stipend granted to its minister of 2 
chalders of victual, 400 merks Scots, or L.22, 4s. Sj'd. Sterling 
money, and L. 50 Scots, or L. 4, 3s. 4d. Sterling, for com- 
munion elements. This stipend continued till 1732, upwards 
of eighty years ; but, in that year, a process of augmentation 
was brought, in which the then real rent of the whole parish was 
proved to be L. 2670, Is. 4d. Scots, or only L.222, 10s. l\d. 
Sterling, and 31 bolls 3 pecks victual; and by decree dated 16th 
February 1732 the stipend was augmented to 31 bolls 3 pecks 



ARDCLACH.

victual, and L. 430, Is. 2d. Scots, or L. 35, 16s. 9d. Sterling, 
money, including therein 40 inerks, or L. 2, 4s. Sjjd. Sterling, 
for furnishing the communion elements. In a process of augmen- 
tation in 1786, the then real rent of the parish was proved to be 
L.543, 8s. 5d. Sterling, and 283 bolls of victual ; and, about 1796, 
the stipend was again raised to L. 85 Sterling, including L. 5 Ster- 
ling for communion elements, with 31 bolls 3 pecks victual. 
Lastly, in 1816, the stipend was augmented to its present amount 
of 14 chalders victual, with L.8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. 

The patron of the parish is Mr Brodie of Lethen. The num- 
ber of male communicants is 49, and of females, 52. The parish 
is connected with the Nairnshire Auxiliary Missionary Society, to 
which it contributes L.5 Sterling yearly. 

Education. — There are three schools within the parish, viz. the 
parochial school at Ardclach, a female school there, and a school 
at Fornighty ; of which the two last are endowed by the Society 
in Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge. The branches 
of instruction taught in the parish school are, reading, writing, 
arithmetic, book-keeping, land measuring, mathematics, geogra- 
phy, English, Latin, and Greek; in the female school, reading, 
sewing, knitting, and sampler workj and in the school of For- 
nighty, reading, writing, arithmetic, and English grammar. The 
parochial schoolmaster's salary is L.36, 7s. 3d. per annum, includ- 
ing an allowance of L.2 for a garden ; and his legal accommoda- 
tion is complete. The school-fees amount to from L.IO to L.15. 
The female school receives L.5 a year from the Society. And 
the Fornighty school receives L.15 a year from the Society, and 
L.2 a year from the late Mr Dunbar of London. The general 
expense of education at the parochial school is, per year, for read- 
ing, 6s.; reading and writing, 9s.; do. with arithmetic, 12s.; 
Latin, &amp;c. 15s. There is no higher charge. It is not believed 
there is any young person in the parish between the ages of six and 
tifteen who is unable to read; but there are about thirty persons 
above fifteen who can neither read nor write. The people are, in 
general, alive to the benefits of education ; but there are some few 
parts of the parish so distant as to render it impossible for the 
young children to attend school. In the remote districts alluded 
to the population is extremely scanty, — so much so, as to be in- 
sufficient either to support a school, or furnish an adequate number 
of scholars. Increased facilities of education have, most certainly, 
effected a decided improvement on the character of the peoplcv

Literature.— There is a parochial Hbrary, and a Literary So- 
ciety in connection with the parish school. 

Savings Bank.— There is no savings bank nearer than Nairn. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The number of poor on the roll 
is 27, and of other persons occasionally receiving aid, 15. The 
sum allocated to each of the permanent poor is 4s. yearly. The 
church collections average L.5, 10s. annually ; besides which,- there 
are L.2, 3s. per annum, being interest of a legacy of L.45 left by 
the late Mr James Dunbar of London, and some trifling casual 
donations. The poor are indisposed to apply for parochial relief, 
which they consider degrading, and never apply for but under 
most urgent necessity. 

Inns.— There is only one inn in the parish. It is called the 
New Inn, and stands on the property of Fairness. 

JFuel. — Peat is the ordinary fuel of the parish, and is obtained 
in abundance in the different mosses, where the people cast it for 
themselves. Wood is occasionally used, and sometimes a Httlo 
coal, which is obtained at Nairn at from 13s. 6d. to 17s. 6d. per 
ton. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The state of the parish as it at present exists, as compared with 
what it was, very much within the remembrance of persons now 
living, is striking in the extreme. Till a period comparatively re- 
cent, the peasantry and small farmers, forming the body of the po- 
pulation of the district, were in a most miserable condition. They 
lived in hovels, the entrance to which was used promiscuously by 
themselves and their cattle, one end of the dwelling being possess- 
ed by the latter, and the other by themselves. The dung of the 
animals was cleaned out at long intervals, — the work being per- 
formed by means of a hand-barrow, such as is used by masons, 
and requiring two able-bodied men to accomplish it. The mid- 
den or dunghill was invariably in a large hollow, made for the 
purpose, at the very door. The dung was carried to the fields, 
not in coup-carts," but in " kellachs" of basket or wicker work. 
The horses were left unshod ; and scarcely any use was made of 
iron in their implements of husbandry, except for coulter and sock, 
and harrow-tines, which last were not unfrequently made of wood, 
and for the iron sockets which pointed their dung-forks. To 
draw their ploughs they used four oxen or cows, and two horses ; 
or sometimes, six or eight black cattle, without horses. In the 
long winter evenings, their only light was moss fir, split into

ARDCLACII. 



43 



small slips,— lamps being unknown, and a tallow candle so rare, 
as to be known only as " a white candle," in contradistinction to 
the " fir candle," which they ordinarily used. 

This state of things now no longer exists. The people, though 
many of them in poor circumstances, are, generally speaking, mo- 
derately comfortable, and many of them thriving, and rapidly ac- 
quiring both increase of knowledge, and the means of independence. 
They are becoming intelligent in their mode of farming, rearmg 
bette'r crops, doing more justice to the land, and very many of 
them inhabiting substantial and comfortable dwellings. The 
causes which have contributed to this amelioration are various. 
The country has been opened up of late years by the formation of 
roads; encouragement has been given to the tenantry, and even 
to the cottars ; they have been taught, and have experienced, the 
benefits of liming their land, and maintaining a proper rotation of 
cropping, and the evils of the wretched system which they former- 
ly pursued ; farming societies are established in the neighbouring 
towns and villages, at whose competitions they are encouraged to 
attend ; and premiums are given, partly by societies and partly by 
the landlords, to the tenants and farm -servants, for good ploughing, 
and to cottagers for the neatest and cleanliest cottages. With all 
this, a great deal remains to be done ; but, improvement having 
once commenced, and the people being fairly alive to several of 
the main causes of their improved condition, the prospect for the 
future is sufficiently encouraging.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 
ON THE COUNTY OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6959764">NAIRN</name>.</head> 
<p>

This small county is included between the shiresof Inverness and 
Moray. It is bounded on the west by the river Nairn, and on the 
east by the river Findhorn. The river Nairn takes its rise in the 
eastern part of Inverness-shire, deriving its sources from numerous 
small streams that issue out of Loch Clachan, as also from the 
waters of several small lakes to the eastward of Lochness. The 
river then takes a northerly direction, flowing through Strath Nairn, 
till it discharges its waters into the Moray Frith. 

South-east of Strath-Nairn, and lying in a parallel direction, is 
the valley of Strathdern, through which flows the Findhorn, which, 
among its other tributaries, receives a stream issuing from Loch 
Moy. The upper portion of the country is hilly and composed of 
gneiss and granite rocks ; the lower valleys are occupied by the 
old red sandstone, and are of a more fertile nature. The banks of 
the Findhorn are highly picturesque, and beautifully clothed with 
wood. 

Nairn is the chief and only town of the county. The length 
of the county from north to south is 22 miles, and from east to 
west 15 miles, including an area of 200 square miles, or 
128,000 acres, of which about 30,000 are under cultivation. It 
contains a population, according to the census of 1841, of 9218. 
The parliamentary constituency amounts to 118 voters. The an- 
nual value of real property, as assessed in 1815, amounted to 
L. 14,902.
