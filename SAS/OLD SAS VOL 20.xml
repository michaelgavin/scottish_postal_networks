It is with infinite fatisfaction, that the Author has 
brought this Volume to a conclufion, and prefents the Pu- 
blic, with the remainder of the Statiftical Accounts of the 
different Parimes in Scotland, without a Jingle one being 
omitted. He thinks it proper, however, to add, that ano- 
ther Volume is now in the Prefs, the printing of which has 
already made confiderable progrefs. That Volume will 
contain, not only fuch material additions to, or corrections 
of, the Parochial Reports, as have been tranfmitted fince 
the original Accounts were printed, but alfo a very copious 
General Index, carefully compiled, and divided into three 
parts ; the firft, compriling all the Subje&amp;s treated of ; the 
fecond, the Names of the Perfons ; and the third, the Names 
of the Places, Lakes, Rivers, Mountains, &amp;c. mentioned in 
the Statiftical Volumes. — The whole Work will therefore 
be comprehended in Twenty-one Volumes. 

In regard to the propofed Analyfis of the Statiftical 
Account of Scotland, or the refult of the Inquiry, the 
Author has begun that important undertaking, and will en- 
deavour to complete it, as foon as his leiiure from other 
avocations will admit.— It is a Work, however, that will 
require fo much attention and labour, that he trulls the Pu- 
blic will excufe him, for not attempting to execute it in too 
hafty a manner.

HISTORY 



OF THE 

ORIGIN AND PROGRESS 

OF THE 

STATISTICAL ACCOUNT 

O F 

SCOTLAND. 



AN author, who printed a work, intitled, 
" Profpedls and Obfervations on a Tour in 
" England and Scotland foon after the com- 
mencement of the Statistical Account of 
Scotland, and who, it would appear, had feen 
fome fpecimens of that publication, ftates, in the 
following words, his opinion, of the impracticabi- 
lity of fo great an undertaking, being completed 
by the exertions of one individual. 

" There have not been wanting different per- 
" fons, public-fpirited indeed, but perhaps of too 
Vol. XX. a " fanguine 

% Publifhed by Meflrs Robinfons, London, in one vol. 4to, an, 1791. 



x Hi/lory of the Origin and Progrefs of the 

" fanguine difpofitions, who, ftruck with the fub- 
" ferviency of parochial diftinction, to the advance- 
" ment of both civil and natural hiftory, have ad- 
" dreffed letters to the different parifhes in Scot- 
" land, and particularly to the Clergy, inviting 
" them to a correfpondence, on whatever might 
" appear mofT curious and intereffing in their re- 
" fpective divifions. Thefe Gentlemen do not reflect, 
4 that there is no individual, however diflinguifhed 
" by genius, rank, or fortune, or even by a happy or 
" rare union of all thefe advantages, who can poffibly 
** be confidered, by a whole Nation, as a fit centre 
" for fuch general co-operation 

It is certain, that notedly this ingenious travel- 
ler, but alfo many of the Author's friends, on 
whofe judgment he could bed rely, were in gene- 
ral of the fame opinion, and adverfe to his enga- 
ging in the attempt on fo great a fcale. It is pro- 
per, therefore, that the hiftory of the accomplish- 
ment of fuch an undertaking, and of the means 
by which it was completed, in the midft of a va- 
riety of other important avocations, fliould be pre- 
served, as a memorial, of what may be effected by 
unceafing energy and perfeverance. 

At an early period of life, I felt a flrong pre- 
dilection for literary purfuits, and, as far back as 
October 1769, when only about fifteen years and a 
half old, began to fend to the newfpapers, and 

other

• other periodical publications, various communica- 
tions, fpecimens of which, merely as Boyifh Com- 
pofitions, I have thought it might not be improper 
to refcue from oblivion. (See Appendix, A ). But, 
above all, I preferred engagingin inquiries connec- 
ted with political fubjecls, and collected, many 
years ago, very extenfive materials, for works on 
queftions of that nature, which, probably, I mall 
never *have leifure to execute. Fortunately, how- 
ever, I found time fufficient, to Iketch out the Hi- 
ftory of the Public Revenue of the Britifli Em- 
pire *, (for the Work, as printed, is only a Iketch), 
which, though it contains theeffence of many hun- 
dred publications, was executed in a very iliort 
period of time. The firft volume, I think, was 
both written and printed in the fpace of about 
fix months, anno 1785, and the, other, in about 
the fame period of time, anno 1790. The materi- 
als, however, of both had been previoufly collec- 
ted. I have ever confidered it, indeed, as the be.ft 
mode of compofition, to colled the materials for 
any work, as leifure would permit, and when they 
were collected, to dedicate a certain fpace of time, 
to that fubject exclufively, and not to fuffer any 
other matter to break in upon the propofed inve- 
ftigation. 

At the conclufion of .the Hidory of the Reve- 
nue, it was my intention to have laid before the 
Public, a General View of the Political Circum- 

ftances 

* Tlus work is in three-parti. The two firft were printed in 1785, and 
the third in 1790. 



xil Hijlory of the Origin and Progrefs of the 



ftances of the Country ; but, after taking every 
poflible pains to become mafter of the fubjeft, all 
the information I could obtain, was fo extremely 
defective, that it was neceflary to give up the idea ; 
which I did with a confiderable degree of reluc- 
tance. 

On my arrival at Edinburgh, in May 1790, to 
attend the General AlTembly of the Church of Scot- 
land, of which AlTembly I was a Lay Member, 
and with the leaders of which, I lived on terms of 
intimacy and friendfhip, it fortunately occurred 
to me, that I might prevail upon that refpe&amp;able 
body, to furniih fuch information, refpecling the 
general ftate of Scotland, as might enable me to 
give a fufficient idea of the political fituation of 
that part of the Britifh empire. My original in- 
tention was, to have drawn up a General Statifli- 
cal View of North Britain, without any particular 
reference to parochial diftridh ; bat I found fuch 
merit and ability, and fo many ufeful fads and im- 
portant obfervations, in the communications which 
were fent me, that I could not think of depriving 
the Clergy, of the credit tbey were entitled to de- 
rive, from fuch laborious exertions, and thence was 
^induced, to give the Work to the Public, in the 
manner in which it has been printed. It is my 
intention, at the fame time, as foon as leifure from 
other purfuits will admit of it, to draw up the refult 
of the whole inquiry, in a publication to be enti- 
tled, " Analylis of the Political State of Scotland, 



Statijlkal Account of Scotland. xiii 

" with a View of the Principles of Statiftical 
" Philofophy," a work which, I hope, it will be 
in my power to lay before the public at the com- 
mencement of the enfuing century. 

The moft natural mode of obtaining informa- 
tion, and the one which I originally adopted, was 
that of printing and circulating Queries, as many 
individuals might be inclined to fend anfwers to 
any queftions put to them, who would not take 
the trouble of drawing up a regular Report. I ac- 
cordingly addreffed a Letter to the Clergy, and in-r 
clofed Queries in it, which will be found in Ap- 
pendix B. 

Many people were at firft furprifed, at my uling 
the new words, Statijlics and Statijlkal, as it was 
fuppofed, that fome term in our own language, 
might have expreffed the fame meaning. But, in 
the courfe of a very extenlive tour, through the 
northern parts of Europe, which I happened to take 
in 1786, I found, that in Germany they were en- 
gaged inafpecies of political inquiry, to which they 
had given the name of Static/lies; and though 1 ap- 
ply a different idea to that word, for by Statiftical is 
meant in Germany, an inquiry for the purpofe of 
afcertaining the political ftrength of a country, or 
queftions refpecling matters offlate; whereas, the 
idea I annex to the term, is an inquiry into the 
ftate of a country, for the purpofe of afcertaining 
the quantum ofbappinefs enjoyed by its inhabitants, 
and the means of its future improvement ; yet, as 

I 



xiv Hijlory of the Origin and Progrefs of the 



I thought that a new word, might attrad more 
public attention, I refolved on adopting ir, and I 
hope that it is now completely naturalifed and 
incorporated with our language. 

Having received a number of returns in con- 
fequence of the Queries circulated, and fome of 
them being drawn up in the form of a regular Re- 
port, I refolved to try the effed of publifhing a 
volume of parochial accounts ; and having return- 
ed from London, (where I had gone to attend my. 
duty in Parliament), to Edinburgh, in January 
1791, I commenced the undertaking, by printing 
the reports of the four parifh.es with which the firft 
volume of the Statiftical Account commences, 
namely, thofe of Jedburgh, Holywood, Port-Pa- 
trick, and Hounam, and having thrown off icoo 
extra copies of thofe four parilhes, fent them, by 
way of a fpecimen, to every Clergyman in Scot- 
land, accompanied with another Letter, to be 
found in Appendix C. 

By dint of great exertions, the firfl volume of 
the Work was publifhed on the 25th of May 1791, 
exadly 12 months from the commencement of the 
undertaking. It gave, on the whole, very general 
•fatisfadion. Some of the Clergy, indeed, were 
difTatisfied, at the freedom uied with their com- 
munications, (it being thought neceiTary to con- 
denfe them as much as poffible) ; and others, una- 
ware of the difficulty of printing corredly, parti- 
cularly from manufcripts written by fo many dif- 
ferent hands, were difpleafed with a few typogra- 
phical 



Statijlical Account of Scotland* xv 



phical errors. It fo far furpaffed, however, any 
thing of the kind that had ever been hitherto at- 
tempted, that every individual, who wilhed well 
to the improvement of the country, or the wel- 
fare of its inhabitants, became defirous of pro- 
moting it, and hence I had fome reafon to flatter 
myfelf, that the whole Work would be completed 
in a fhort period of time. 

Being fo frequently out of Scotland, I have in 
general been obliged, to rely upon the affiftance of 
others, for preparing the communications of the 
Clergy, and correcting the prefs. The fecond vo- 
lume, however, I was enabled to undertake my- 
felf, during a Parliamentary recefs ; and I do not 
recollect, to have met with a greater ma£s of curi- 
ous and interefting information, in any publication 
of that extent. It begins with a parifti near the 
borders, that of Tortherwald, and ends with Mid 
and South Yell in Shetland, the parifhes gradual- 
ly proceeding northwards. Thofe who can perufe 
that volume, without pleafure and improvement, 
muft have little real turn or difpofition for fuch in- 
veftigations. 

It was natural tofuppofe, that the moft zealous 
friends to the caufe, would early come forward 
with their communications, and that fome induce- 
ment muft be held forth to thofe, who were incli- 
ned to be backward, to prevail upon them to make 
the necelTary inquiries. From the beginning, I 
had propofed that the profits arifing from the pub- 

licaticn^ 



xvi Hi/lory of the Origin and Progrejs of tie 



lication, flioulcl be given to the Society inftituted 
for the benefit of the Sons of the Clergy. It ac- 
cidentally alfo occurred to me, that it would be 
poffible to procure a Royal Grant for the fame be- 
nevolent purpofe ; and having, with that view, ap- 
plied to Mr Secretary Dundas, his Majefty, in 
confequence of his recommendation, was graci- 
oufly pleafed to grant L. 2000 to that Society ; I 
availed myfelf of that opportunity, to make a third 
application to the deficient Clergy, (fee Appendix, 
D), which I flattered myfelf would have been ve- 
ry generally fuccefsful. 

Experience, however, foon proved, that altho' 
confiderable progrefs might thus be made, yet that 
it was impoflible to expect, without ft ill greater 
exertions, the unanimous afliftance of fo numerous 
a body as the Clergy of Scotland. Many circum- 
ftances prevented unanimity on fuch an occafion. 
Some difliked the fcheme from the beginning, or, 
having rafhly given an opinion againft it, before 
they had thoroughly underftood its nature or ob- 
iecl, were aihamed afterwards to retract. Some 
were prevented by old age and bodily infirmities, 
fome owing to family diftrefs, and fome by the 
jealoufy of their parimioners, who thought that 
the whole was a deep laid fcheme, fet on foot by 
Government, with a view to taxation ; whilft the 
tenants, in many country pariihes, did not much 
relifti the inquiries which were made into the pro- 
duce of the foil, the value of their cattle, &amp;c. ap-

prehenfive that their landlords, might avail them- 
felves too much of that information. In fhort, 
from a combination of fuch circumftances, after 
writing many thoufand letters, and the exertions 
of above two years, I found, on the ift of June 
1792, that no lefs a number than 413 accounts 
were ftill wanting. 

Every meafure, either devifed by myfelf, or 
fuggeited by others, was carried into efftc"t, in 
order to prevail upon the deficient Clergy to com- 
plete the Work. A recommendation from the Ge- 
neral AfTembly was one of the meafures adopted ; 
the diftinguimed Hiftorian of Scotland and Ame- 
rica, (the late Dr Robertfon), was prevailed upon 
to write to all his contemporaries, requefting their 
affiftance ; many other refpeclable members of the 
Church, as Sir Henry Welwood Moncrief, Dr 
Blair, (the celebrated author of the Sermons, and 
other valuable publications), Dr Kemp, Dr Hardie, 
&amp;c. applied to their Clerical friends, to promote 
the Work within the bounds of their feveral pref- 
byteries. The Duke of Argyll, the Earl of Le- 
ven, (whofe fituation as Commiffioner to the Gene- 
ral Alfembly gave him much weight with the 
Church), the Earl of Fife, and feveral other great 
Proprietors in Scotland, wrote to the different Mi- 
nifters, whom they had prefented to livings, or 
with whom they had any particular connection ; 
and from time to time, I took every opportunity 
that occurred, of reminding the Clergy, by va- 
rious letters, which will be feen in Appendix, E ; 
Vol. XX. b but

but I flill found, not only that feveral indivi- 
duals could not be prevailed upon to draw up their 
accounts, but indeed that fome, from a procrafti- 
nating fpirit, and unwillingnefs to engage in, or to 
complete, any laborious undertaking, could not be 
depended on, after they had promifed to tranfmit 
them. 

Determined, however, to complete the Work, 
I then relblved to fend Statifiical Mifjionaries to 
different parts of the country, one to the Weftern 
Iflands, another over the counties of Aberdeen and 
Banff, a third to the prefbyteries of Dunkeld and 
Perth, a fourth to Dumfries-fhire and Galloway, 
and a fifth to the Orkney Iflands ; and by that 
means, feveral accounts, to the amount of about 25, 
that would otherwife have been wanting, were 
procured. 

When the whole Work was nearly brought to 
a conclulion, and litis of the different parifhes were 
made up, an unfortunate circumftance occur- 
red, of the moft difcouraging nature. The ac- 
counts were fent by the Clergy to me, and many 
of them were received in London, and thence 
tranfmitted to Scotland, to be incorporated in the 
Work. Upon making up the lift, in June 1796, 
no lefs than twelve accounts, which I thought had 
been received, were not to be found \ and it be- 
came necefTary, again to apply to the Clergy to 
make up the lofs. I do not recoiled! any circum- 
flance, in the whole courfe of the undertaking, 
that gave me fo much Uneafinefs.

At laft, on the ift day of January 1798 *, or fe- 
ven years, feven months, and feven days, from the 
commencement of the attempt, an account of eve- 
ry parifti in Scotland, was either given in, or might 
be relied on, in the fpace of a few days. The 
reader will eafily conceive the fatisfaftion which 
that circumftance occafioned ; and as, undoubt- 
edly, no inftance is recorded in hiftory, of fuch 
a number as above 900 perfons, engaging in fo 
laborious an undertaking, more efpecially at the 
requeft of a private individual, it may not be im- 
proper, briefly to ftate the circumftances to which 
it may be attributed. 

In the firft place, I had made it a rule, from an 
early period of life, to behave with attention and 
civility to thofe with whom I happened to be in 
company ; and many of the Clergy afterwards in- 
formed me, that nothing induced them more to 
comply with my requeft, than their recollection of 
little incidents of that nature. I mention this cir- 
cumftance, as a proof of the advantage to be de- 
rived from fuch a ftile of behaviour ; for I had 
little reafon to imagine, that a young clergyman, 
to whom I might accidentally (hew any little mark 
of civility, could ever have had it in his power to 
make any return for it. 

In the fecond place, having an eftate in the moft 
northern part of the kingdom, where I occalional- 
ly refided, I had better accefs to information re- 
garding the remoter diftrids, than falls to the lot 

of

of the generality of my countrymen, and thence 
indeed had an opportunity of cultivating a more 
extenfive acquaintance, than is commonly in the 
power of any individual, and of increafing it when 
neceftary. 

In the third place, I laid it down as a rule, 
pointedly to anfwer every letter I received from 
the Clergy, and to acknowledge the receipt of all 
their different communications, which, in fome 
cafes, were very numerous, even from a fingle di- 
ftricl, the minifters occafionally fending their 
reports even in fheets. — I do not know any thing 
more efTentially necefiary for fuccefs in bufinefs, 
than regularity of correfpondence. By delays in 
anfwering letters, I have at various times fuffcred 
much, and I attribute my fuccefs in this important 
undertaking, in a great meafure, to the punctuality 
with which I carried on my Statiftical correfpond- 
ence. Fortunately, at that time, the privilege of 
franking, was, in regard to the number of letters, 
unlimited, and the late reflrictions upon that right, 
are much to be regretted, as they di fable perfons, 
not in official fituations, from carrying on fuch ex- 
tenfive inquiries. Had I been confined to the fend- 
ing of only 70 letters per week free from portage, 
I fhould fcarcely have undertaken, far lefs carried 
through, the Statiftical Account of Scotland. 

In the laft place, the fuccefs of this under- 
taking is to be attributed, to a fpirit of perfeve- 
rance, which no obftacle could refill, and without

which, no great enterprife can ever be accom- 
plifhed ; a fpirit, which was kept up, from time to 
time, by animating eulogiums, from various refpec- 
table quarters, both foreign and domeftic, fome of 
which, I have thought it proper to infert, in the 
Appendix to this paper. (See Appendix, F). 

I beg leave to add, that though the advantages 
to be derived from fuch a Work, both by this and 
by other countries, are many, yet in no refpect is 
it of more effential confequence, than in proving 
the practicability, of combining the information 
and intelligence of great numbers of people, in one 
important literary undertaking. Who, before, 
could have imagined, that it would be poffible to 
unite the labours of above nine hundred individuals 
in one Work. By following a fimilar plan, regard- 
ing other ufeful objects of inquiry, there is no art 
or fcience, that might not be brought, with conli- 
derable rapidity, to a greater height of improve- 
ment, than can ever othervvife be effected ; and 
thus the lot of the human fpecies, may, in various 
refpects, be fpeedily ameliorated. 

I cannot conclude, without returning my 
warmed acknowledgments, to the many refpect- 
able characters, by whofe affiftance I have been 
enabled to complete this Work. By their exer- 
tions on this occafion, they have immortalized 
themfelves, and the order to which they belong ; 
and the greateft compliment that in future can be 
paid to any body of men, will be, that they are

Letters Jigned Julius C^sar, the firjl Literary attempts of 
the Author of the Statiftical Account of Scotland. 

WHHW wmmmm 



THE following letters, written by Sir John Sinclair, were printed 
in the Caledonian Mercury in Odlober 1 769. An anonymous author, 
under the name of Mercator Caledonius, had written letters in that paper, 
lamenting the necefiity which the natives of the Highlands were under, of, 
abandoning their native country, in confequence of the increafe of rents, 
and of emigrating to America. On that occalion, Sir John Sinclair 
was tempted to commence author, though then only about fifteen year* 
and a half old. The letters were written merely by way of an exercife, 
and trial of fkill, than with any other view. It is hoped, therefore, that the 
reader will make allowance for fuch a circumftance. No perfon happened 
to be acquainted with his having written them, and nothing could be more 
amufing for fo young a man, than upon going into company, to hear his 
works talked of with approbation, inquiries made who the author could be, 
&amp;c. &amp;r. 



N° I. 

To the Printer of the Caledonian Mercury. 

SIR, 

] Observed at the end of your paper of the 2d current, that you had ex- 
* pimgcd fome pafiages of a letter figned Mercator Caledonius, and in- 
deed it would have been of no confequence if you had expunged the whole. 
Chriftian charity, however, forces me to conclude, that Mr Mercator will 
make a better figure behind his counter, tying up a pennyworth of fugar, 
or changing a fixpence to his beft cuftomer, than filling your paper with 
heavy complaints of no moment or importance. As for my lhare, Mr Prin- 
ter, I have often travelled through every corner of the Highlands of Scot- 
land ;

land ; it is the place of my birth, and the country of my heart ; yet, with all 
my partiality and prejudice fur it, I have feen too many of its inhabitants 
■who were pictures of indolence and" floih. Contented to live in inacti- 
vity and idlencfs, without even the neceflaries of life, they would rather 
ftarve in the midft of profufion, than apply themfelves to any bufinefs, with 
induftry and labour ; they would rather mount up, with the utmoll diffi- 
culty, to the top of a bleak and barren mountain, from whence nothing can 
be feen but the clouds of Heaven, and the Albion fnows, than ftrive to attain 
to independency and freedom, with the fweat of their brow, or the labour 
of their hands. They would rather cringe to their landlord and their laird, 
to obtain the crumbs that fall from his table, than attempt to get a decent 
and comfortable livelihood, by cultivating the lands entrufted to their care, 
or applying themfelves to any trade, (which, though it would, perhaps, 
difgrace the blood, and the race from whence they fprang), yet it would, 
in time, make them richer even than the chief of their clan. What, then, 
can their mafters do with fuch tenants, and with fuch dependents? Can 
they fee, without emotion, their lands lying defolate and uncultivated by 
the floth of its inhabitants ? Can they fee, without emotion, their friends 
and their neighbours wallowing in riches and plenty, and they themfelves 
funk in poverty and wretchednels ? What fignifies the tracts of land they 
poflefs ? Of what avail is the number of the tenants on their eftates, if they 
fcarce receive as much for ten miles of good country, as elfewhere would 
not rent the tenth part of an acre ? But, mult they Hill continue to go on 
in the fame foolifti and unaccountable jog-trot ? Will they ftill continue to 
ride through twice twenty miles, without feeing the fmoke of a chimney, 
or hearing the crowing of a cock ? Or, will they not rather attempt, by 
heightening their rents, to excite the induftry of their people, and fill their 
eftates with the fober and the diligent ? Thefe things, according to Mr 
Mercator's phrafe, grow clamant for redrefs ; they have been often confide- 
red with the utmoft attention by the landed property in the Highlands. I 
myfelf have an eftate in that country, and, I am fure, if this fcheme does 
not make it better, it cannot make it worfe. I lhall not detain you, Mr 
Printer, any longer at prefent, I hope that you will admit thefe few uncon- 
nected hints into your moft entertaining paper; and will only add, that Mr 
Mercator need not dread, in cafe the Highlanders do defert their fo much 
beloved native foil, that they will feize the fniall pittance that he has fcra- 
ped together, for they never think of attacking thofe who have nothing to 
lofe ; the poor man may whiftle in the night-time, though the fword of the 
robber is pointed at his bread.

MEROATOR CALEDONIUS being much diffatisfied with this attack 
upon his lucubrations, publiihed a Very angry reply ; in confcquenre of 
which the Author wrote the following letter, which ended the eontro- 
verfy. 

N° It. 

To the Publijber of the Caledonian Mercury. 

SIR, 

f-pHOUGH I have confidered, Mr Printer, with the utmoft attention, the 
fituation of fome of our weftern Highlanders ; though I have afked 
again and again the fentiments of my friends on this interefting fubjeft, yet 
I ftill continue in the fame opinion I at firft adopted : and fo far am I from 
thinking, that the departure of a few fatious and idle Highlanders would 
prove detrimental to thefe united kingdoms, that I would with a contribu- 
tion was immediately begun ; let them be flapped off at the public expence, 
whilft the whim .continues, and let them be tranfported to a country, where 
they may find a nation perhaps as favage as themfelves, and, if poffible, 
equally deftitute of the lead appearance of religion and virtue. But I hope 
that the lbber and the diligent will not think of following their example ; 
let them be deterred from executing that fcheme, by che difmal mifcarriage 
of the firft attempt ; the news lately arrived in Scotland, that fome of thefe 
people, who had left the fruitful Argylefhire coafts, to inhabit the Ameri- 
can wilds, had not met with that reception they wifhed or expected. You 
mi*ht have heard, Mr Printer, that fome of them died, during a long and 
tedious voyage ; that fome fuffered the worft of deaths, by the want of fub- 
liitence ; and that the reft were fo overcome by the change of the aiv, and 
the inclemency of the weather, that few, if any, expecled to fee the return 
of another fummer. I hope that this news will be of fome advantage to 
my deluded countrymen ; let t.hern conlider the danger of perifliing in a 
vaft and tempeftuous ocean, without a friend or a neighbour to afTift them 
in their diftrefs: how they muft go to a country where their language is 
unknown, and their -mifery will be dil'regarded ; how they muft leave 
a beloved wife and tender infants, to bewail their abfence with unavailing 
tears, when left to the care of a treacherous friend, or a concealed enemy : 
and even fuppofing that they do fafely arrive at thefe barren del'erts ; fup- 
pofing that they can fpeak the dialed of the country, and that at lirft they 
are viewed with the tender eye of pity and compaffion, yet how can they 
expect to be long fupported by hardened avarice, or flagging charity ? How 
can they then expect to receive affiftance and alms from the lavages of the 
defert, or obtain a fcttlement, even in that vaft and boundlefs country, with- 
out the ncceflary aids of friends and money ? and when reduced to the laft 
extremity in a foreign country, they will then, perhaps, be worl'e than the

~ that a plan, which has been fortunate enough to meet with the appro 
bation of fome of the molt refpedlable and diftinguiflied characters in thefe 
kingdoms, will be favoured with your affiftance.

which in thefe enlightened times is juftly held of the molt efTential public 
importance*.

In many parts of the Continent, more particularly in Germany, Statifti- 
cal Inquiries, as they are called *, have been carried to a .very great c*. 
tent ; but in no country, it is believed, can they be brought to fucb perfec- 
tion 'as in Scotland, which boafts of an eccleliaftical eftablilhment, whofe 
members will yield to no defcription of men, for public zeal, as well as for 
private virtue, for intelligence, and for ability. 

I flatter myfelf, that upon this occafion, they will not be backward in 
contributing their aid, to promote an attempt, which may prove of confider- 
able fervice to the country at large, and cannot fail to add to the reputa- 
tion and character, which the Church of Scotland has already fo defervedly 
acquired for public utility. 

I have the honour to be, 

Sir, your very obedient,

N. B. It is not expected, that all the inclofed Queries fhould be anfwer- 
ed by any individual ; nor is minute exsxflnefs looked for : but it is requeft- 
ed, that as many queftions may be attended to, as circumftances will ad- 
mit of. 

In the event of a vacancy in the parifli, or where the prefent incumbent 
is prevented, by ficknefs or otherwife, from fending an anfwer, it is intreat- 
ed that fome neighbouring clergyman would take that trouble upon him- 
felf. • 

It is fubmitted, whether it might not be proper to infert the Queries and 
Anfwers in any parochial regifter, that in after times the future ftate of the 
parifh, may be compared with its fituation at prefent. 

Any anfwer to thefe Queries may be directed to Sir John Sinclair of Ulb- 
fter, Baronet, Member of Parliament, Edinburgh, who will thankfully ac- 
knowledge the receipt of any paper upon this fubject, that may be addrefied 
to him. 

It may he proper to add, that if it is thought advifable to publifli fuch 
an account of Scotland, as may be drawn up from the materials, to be thus 
collected, any profit that can be derived from the publication, is to be 
dedicated to an inftitution lately formed, for the Benefit of the Sons of the

couragement.

population of any diftricT; or country, may be known with fufficient accura- 
cy, by multiplying the number of births by 26, or the number of deaths 
by 36. 1° Scotland, on the other hand, Mr Wilkie, minifter of Cults, 
iuppofes, that the number either of births and burials, if they are equal, 
fhould be multiplied by 40 ; or, if there is any difference, the half of the 
whole, (both the births and the burials), mould be multiplied by the ex- 
pectation of an infant's life, adapted to the particular diftridt, in order to 
afcertain its population. See Statiftical Account, vol. II. p. 415. It ap- 
pears, from Mr Wilkie's calculations, that the expectation of a life in 
Scotlaud, is much greater than in England, or on the Continent.

It may be proper to add, that many important facts and obfervations

APPENDIX, a 

Second printed Circular Letter to the Clergy, with a Specimen of Four 
Pari/hes. 

SIR, 

TT is with infinite pleafure I have the honour of acquainting yoit, that by 
the zeal and patriotifm of the clergy of Scotland, I have already in my 
pofTeffion materials for drawing up a Statiltical Account of a considerable part 
of the whole kingdom ; and that in the couvfe of the enfuing fpring, (which 
is the feafon when the minifters generally take a clerical furvey of their 
refpective parifhes,) I have reafon to expect returns from above a half of 
Scotland. Of the nature and importance of the reports which have been 
received, you will be able to judge from the fpecimen I inclofe. It is part 
of a volume, now in the prefs, which will be ready for publication by the 
next meeting of the General AlTembly. 

You will eafily perceive the many important advantages which the pub- 
lic muft neceffarily derive, were reports equally accurate with thofe inclo- 
fed, fent from every other diftrict in the kingdom, though fome years were v 
even employed in bringing this great political furvey to a conclufion; But 
I am anxious that the Clergy of Scotland mould not only do it well, but 
quickly ; fo that the ftate of the whole country mould be known, if poffible, 
at nearly the fame period of time. I therefore hope, Sir, that, for the ho- 
nour of our national church, you will make every exertion in your power, 
to fend me as full, and as accurate an account, as poffible of your parifh, 
and of any neighbouring diftrict, that by any accidental circumftance, may 
require your affiftance. As a Scotchman, and as a friend to the Kirk of 
Scotland, I fhould feel a very peculiar pride in being able to afTert, that, on 
the 45th of May 1790, I began to circulate my ftatiflieal queries among the 
Clergy ; and that before a twelvemonth had elapfed, I had received m&amp;re 
full and fatisfactory information refpecting the ftate of this country, than 
had ever been collected concerning any gther kingdom, 

Yen

Appendix, 



You will perceive, that die inclofed accounts are fyftematically arran- 
ged, from the anfwers which were fent me It is, however, unnecefiary 
for die Clergy to give themfelves that trouble. If the queries which have 
been already fent, are anfwered with minutenef. and accuracy, a complete 
account can eafily be made from thofe anfwers ; neverthelefs, if any clergy- 
man has fufficient leifure to draw up a complete and fyftematical defcrip- 
tion of his parifli, it cannot be the lefs acceptable. 

Some diftricts, fuch as the parifli of Hounam, furnifh little room for fta- 
tiftical inveftigation. In that cafe, the ftate of population, and facts con- 
nected with the political circumftances of the country, are all that is ne- 
ceffary. Fuil accounts are defirable ; but, at the fame dme, no minuter 
ought to hefitate about fending a Ihort one, when there are not means of 
fupplying more important materials. 

In the queries formerly fent, fome particulars were omitted, of which I 
fhould be glad to be informed, even from diofe gentlemen who have alrea- 
dy favoured me with their anfwers : as, 

1. What is the ftate of the fchoob in the parifli ; the falary and per- 
quisites of the fchoolmafter ; and the number of his fcholars ? 

2. What is the number of alehoufes, inns, &amp;.c. ; and what effect have 
they on the morals of the people ? 

3. What is the number of new houfes or cottages which have been 
built within thefe ten years paft ; and how many old ones have 
been pulled down, or have become uninhabitable ? 

4. What has been the effect of employing cottagers in agriculture, or 
of working by hired fervants in their ftead ? and, 

5. What has been the number of prifoners in any jail in the diftrict, 
in the courfe of the yeaT 1 790 ; and for what caufes were they im- 
ptifoned ? 

Tables of births, marriages, and deaths, kept in any particular parilh, 
would be very deGrable. Nor can die informadon reflecting all points 
connected with the population of the country, be too accurate and mi- 
nute. 

On the whole, I flatter myfelf, by your affiftance, and. that of your Bre- 
thren, that it will be in my power to bring a work to perfection, which 
will do more credit to the Clergy of the Church of Scotland, as a learned, 
able, and ufeful body, than perhaps has ever fallen to the lot of any other 
defcription of men. ' 

I have the honour to be, with great regard and efteem, Sir, your mod 
obedient, and very humble fervant, 

JOHN SINCLAIR.

N. B. It is intreated, that at the next meeting of your Prefbytery, fome 
plan maybe formed, for completing the furvey within its bounds, as expedi- 
tiouay as maybe confiftent with accurate returns to the different queries ; 
and that the Moderator, or fome member of the meeting, will have the 
goodnel's to inform me of the fteps which are taken for that purpofe. The 
letters may either be directed to Edinburgh or London. 

Any of the Clergy who have not received a copy of this, or of the former 
letter and queries, may be affured, that it has only arifen from haiftake, and 
from thofe errors which cannot be avoided in fo extenfive a correfpond- 
ence. 

It is alfo requefted, that, in the courfe of any correfpondence with your 
brethren, you will not fail to recommend as early an attention as poflible to 
this inquiry. 

In regard to any queftion, about the propriety of anfwering which a dif- 
ficulty mould arife, no reply is required. 



APPENDIX, D. 

Third printed Circular Letter to the Clergy, announcing the Royal Donation 
of L. aooo. 

SIR, 

T have at length the fatisfaclion to inform you, that the Second Vo- 
lume of the STATISTICAL ACCOUNT OF SCOTLAND will be pu- 
blilhed on the a^th current ; and that the Third, the Fourth, and the 
Fifth Volumes of that Work, (which will comprife a considerable propor- 
tion of the kingdom), are in the prefs, and will be printed without delay. 
You may eafily fuppofe, how defirable it -muft be, on many accounts, tc* 
have an undertaking of a nature fo laborious and important, brought to a 
■conclufion. The public at large are anxious to have it completed, on ac- 
count of the many beneficial confequences, which muft neceflarily refult 
from it: The fooner it can be finiflied, the greater will be the credit, which 
will accrue to thofe, by whofe zeal and exertions, this great Inquiry has 
been carried forward. And, when the Work is finilhed, I have the plea- 
fure of adding, that it will then be in my power, to prefect to the very 
ufcful Society, lately conftituted, for the benefit of the Sons of the 'Clergy, 
a fum which will enable that Inftitution to begin its laudable operations *. 

-Thefe 

* The Society's funds, on 15th June 179T, amounted to L. 1060 ; but 
it did not propofe to diftribute any part of its income until the capital 

reached

Appendix, 



— Thefe are consideration*, which muft have fufilcient weight with every 
Clergyman, who has either any regard for his own order, or any attachment 
for the country at large, to make every exertion in tranfmitting, with all 
convenient fpeed, the information that is required. As yet, indeed, there 
has been no caufe for complaint. Returns have already been fent from 
about one half of the Parifh.es in Scotland ; and, if the remainder were re- 
ceived, previous to the Meeting of the enfuing General Aflembly, the pu- 
blication of rhe STATISTICAL SURVEY OF SCOTLAND might be com- 
pleted in the courfe of the year 1792, or, at fartheft, within three years 
from its commencement, in May 1790; and confequently, with a degree 
of rapidity and fuccefs, which none but the molt fanguine could have 
looked for. 

The 

reached L. 2ooo ; which, it was fuppofed, die fale of the STATISTICAL 
ACCOUNT OF SCOTLAND would complete. 

Regretting that any time fliould be loft, in commencing fo ufeful a distribu- 
tion, I took the liberty of fuggefting a petition to the Crown for fome pecu- 
niary aid. It was with fome difficulty, that I prevailed upon the Society to 
make the application. At firlt they were refolved to decline it, as appears from 
a letter I received from Dr Hardy, dated the 9th May 1 792, in which that re- 
fpectable Clergyman ftates: " I have delayed aniwering your letter, inclofing 
" a draught of a petition for aid to the Sons of the Clergy, till I fhould have 
" converted with Several of the members of the Society, who have taken 
" an active part in its affairs. We all consider the Society as very much in- 
" debted to you, both upon the ground of the Statistical .inquiries, and of 
" your readincfs on this occafion, to exert yourfelf for fome immediate pe- 
" cuniary grant, to bring its capital into a Situation which may authorife 
" a commencement of distribution. All of the gentlemen with whom I 
" have converted on this point, exprefs, however, a reluctance to take fo 
" pointed a Hep, as a petition for pecuniary aid in this cafe, as there is 
" no Specific fund in view on which a probable claim might be laid, but 
" only the privy purfe to which our petition could refer. We are afraid 
" that a repulfe might expofe the Society to fome blame in the view of 
" the public, and our existence depends on our being able to prcServe 
" the full and unmixed approbation of the country,". 

But upon my prelling it again, it was at laft agreed to, and fortunately 
fucceeded ; and now the Society is placed in Such a Situation, that it cannot 
fail to prove materially Serviceable to the Sons of a molt valuable body of 
men, and I trult that ere long its funds will enable it to extend its atten- 
tion to the Daughters of the Clergy alfo.

The information, which will be accumulated m this great Work, will, 
it is believed, be found infinitely fuperior, to that contained in any other 
publication, of a political or ftatiftical nature. Indeed, what elfe could be 
expedted, from the united exertions of above a Thousand Individuals of 
intelligence and ability, who, in a greater or letter degree, will contribute 
to its formation ? I am induced, from that circumftance, to fuggeft, that it 
might not be improper for the Minifters, the Elders, and the principal 
Heads of Families, to join together, in purchafing, for each Parifli, a copy 
of the different Volumes, as they come out. To any mind capable of re- 
ceiving ufeful information, no literary performance can furnifli fo much 
entertainment. Nor is there any, that will yield more important hints— 
for the improvement of agriculture — for the extenfion of commercial in- 
tluftry — for regulating the conduct, of individuals, — or for promoting the 
profperity of the State. The peculiar form of this Work, alfo, admirably 
adapts it for parochial circulation ; and were this idea carried into full ef- 
fect, there is every reafon to believe, that it would materially contribute, 
to further the moft efiential interefts of the community.— -This is a point, 
therefore, which may deferve to be brought under confideration, at any en- 
fuing meeting, of the Prefbytery, or the Synod, to which you belong. 

I have now only to regret the repeated trouble you have received, in 
the courfe of this correfpondence ; but I truft, that you will impute it to 
the real caufe, — an ardent wifh to promote, fo far as I am able, the happi- 
refs of my native country ; and, what is of »much more confequence, than 
the exertions of any fingle individual, to furnifli a numerous and refpedlable 
body of my fellow- citizens, with an opportunity of proving, to the convic- 
tion of the world, their patriotifm and abilities. I have the honour to be, 
with great regard and efteem, Sir, your very obedient humble fervant,

Either anfwers to the original Queries, or an arranged Parochial Ac- 
count, may be fent, as is moft convenient and agreeable. 

It may be remarked, in general, that the great object of the Inquiry is, 
to know the prefent7?ar* of the country,' and to afcertain what means are 
the moft likely to promote the real interefts of its inhabitants, and, that 
deep refearches, into fubjects of antiquity, are far from being confidered as 
equally efiential, though certainly not to be overlooked-

The names of the authors will not be infertcd, if that omiflion is de- 
fied ; and no information is wifhed for, that can give uneafinefs to any in- 
dividual. 

It may not be improper for every Clergyman, who receives this letter, 
to acknowledge the receipt of it, fuggefting any hints, at the fame time, 
that may occur to him refpecling the Statiftical Inquiry ; and, particularly, 
as to the beft mode of Supplying any deficiency in the accounts, either by 
an application to any of the redding Heritors, to fome neighbouring Clergy- 
man, or to any other individual, who has fpirit and capacity, to do jultice 
to fuch an undertaking. 

Any important facts or observations tranfmitted by the Clergy, which 
may not be included in the Statiftical Account of Scotland, as now pub- 
lished, (to prevent the Work fwelling to too great a 152e), are to be care- 
fully written out in Several interleaved copies of the work, to be depofited 
in the principal public libraries both of England and Scotland, for the pur- 
pofe of preservation, and as a foundation for county or provincial half- 
tones, in which more minute information may be expected. 

It might be the means of Shortening fuch accounts considerably, if the 
information, respecting certain articles, were condenfed as much aspoflible,

Additional Notes and Letters, fent from time to time, to the deficient 

'JpHERE was certainly reafon to hope, after having made fo confiderable 
a progrefs, as that of receiving 528 returns, in the f pace of about two 
years, that little difficulty would have been found, in collecting the re- 
maining accounts, amounting only to. 413, in even a fhorter period of time. 
The contrary, however, turned out to be the cafe. It became ncceflary there- 
fore, to reiterate the applications from time to time, to prefent the fubject 
to the deficient Clergy in every poffible light, lbmetimes fetitrtisjj and fome- 
times jocular ; and to prefs them, by every means that, could be fuggefted, 
to tranfmit their refpecftive reports. With that view, the following letters 
were fucceffively written to them. The firft one was printed; the reft, to 
fatisfy them how much the number of deficient parifhes was dimiuifhed, 
were written in manufcript ■; and -one, fent with my own hand, to demon- 
ftrate the particular anxiety I felt to receive a fpeedy anfwer. If any oile 
fliould imagine, th:(t the Statiftical Account of Scotland, could have been 
more rapidly completed than it was, I truft that he will exculpate the Au- 
thor of that undertaking from any blame, after perufing the following fe- 
ries of notes and letters. 

Series of Notes and Letters written to the Clergy of the Church of Scot- 
land, during a Period of Five 2"ears, from the ijl December 1791, 
to the ijl of December 1797. 

No I. Printed Circular Note, dated the :8th December 1792. 

SIR JOHN SINCLAIR prefents his compliments. He hopes that his 
former communications, refpedling the Statiftical Account of Scot- 
land, have been received. It is earneftly requefted, that fuch of the Cler- 
gy as have not yet tranfrnitted their refpeclive accounts, will lofe no time 
in lending them, the Public at large being extremely anxious, to have this 
Work brought to a conclufion, as quickly as poffible, as the advantages of 
which it may be productive, cannot be thoroughly known or felt, until it 
is completed. Eight volumes, which will contain in all about 5C0 p'arifhes, 
will be publifhed in the courfe of January 1793, and the remainder of the 
Work, if the neceffiiry materials come in, might be finifhed foon after the 
meeting of the enfuing General Affembly, ' when it is hoped th'tit not a 
fingle account will be wanting. 

The Clergy will hear, with fatisfaClibn, that not only in England, but ia 
every part .of the Continent, the higheft eulogiums have been befto\Ved, oh 
the zeal, talents, and induftry they have difplayed, in carrying on this great 
undertaking, which, in the opinion of every unprejudiced perfon, will be of 
as much confequencc to other countries as even to Scotland.

N. B. Nothing could be more difagreeable to Sir John Sinclair, thatl to 
be under the neceffity of applying to any other perfon, than the Minifter of 
the parifh, for the Statiftical Account of it ; particularly, as it might tend 
to lelTen the high reputation which the Clergy have already fo defervedly 
acquired by their Statiftical exertions. He hopes, therefore, that your af- 
fiftance will not be wanting, a moment longer than is abfolutely neceflkry ; 
and he fliould be glad to be favoured with your account, directed to him at 
London, in packets not exceeding two ounces in weight, as fptedily as pof- 
fible. It is not in his power, during the fitting of Parliament, to attend to 
the printing of the different returns, but he wifhes to have the fatisfaction 
of reading them over before they are fent to the prefs, and many refpect- 
able literary characters in the church, (in particular thofe, who have taken 
an active part in eftabliftiing the Society for the Benefit of the Sons of the 
Clergy), have undertaken the trouble of revifing the prefs at Edinburgh, 
during his ab fence. 

He has the pleafure of adding, that there is the profpect of a fund being 
foon eftablilhed, for the Daughters as well as the Sons of the Clergy ; and 
though the Clergy engaged in this important Work, without any interefted 
motives, it canuot be an unpleafing circumftance, that their labours are 
likely to meet with luch folid marks of public approbation, and will pro- 
bably be productive, not only of perfonal credit to each individual, but of 
beneficial confequences to the order in general. 

It need fcarcely be added, that the merit which they have ahead) acqui- 
red by their Statiftical exertions, muft very materially contribute to the fuc- 
cefs of the application now in agitation, for the augmentation "of the fti- 
pends of the Clergy. It is indeed an unfortunate circumftance, that the 
Statiftical Account of Scotland was not completed previous to fiich an ap- 
plication. However, the greater number of accounts that are received and 
printed before that queftion comes on, the better chance there is for fuccefs ; 
and it is to be hoped, that at leaft ten volumes, combining from fix to fe- 
veu hundred parifhes, will be publifhed before the month of April, when 
that bufmefs will, in all probability, come under difcuffion. 

SIR JOHN SINCLAIR begs to hear from every Minifter, who has not 
yet written him, when his account may be expected. He will have the 
honour of attending the enfuing General Affembly, when he hopes fome 
plan will be formed, for having, in each parifh, a copy of the Work. In 
die concluding volume, every neceflary correction which the Clergy will 
take the trouble of pointing out, (hall be attended to, and any additional in- 
fprmation will be inferted, that is judged in any refpects of importance.

Clergy, July 1793. 

SIR, 

J Have the pleafure to inform you, that the eighth and ninth volumes of 
the Statiftical Account of Scotland, are juft publilhed ; that the tenth is 
in confiderable forwardnefs, and that the remaining volumes, are ordered to 
be begun. 

The deficient parties are now fo much reduced in number, that I can at 
iafl addrefs every Clergyman, who has not as yet favoured me with an ac- 
count of his parifli, by a letter in M. S. inftead of a printed application. I 
am extremely anxious, on every account that can poffibly have any influ- 
ence on the mind of an Author or of a Citizen, to have this great and la- 
' borious undertaking over ; and I am perfuaded, that you would not wifli to 
be confidered as difinclined to contribute your aid to a Work, which is fo 
ftrongly recommended, by the inclofed unanimous vote, of the venerable 
General Aflembly. If, however, you are prevented by ficknefs, or other- 
wife, from fending the account yourfelf, I will trouble you to point out anv 
tether channel for procuring it, as fpeedily as poflible, as it would be a dil- 
grace to the Country, to have a Work, in which the national character is 
now fo much concerned, too tedious in being brought to a conclufion, 01 s 
to any refpect defective. The eftablifhment of a Board of Agriculture, and 
Internal Improvement, (which would never have taken place had it not 
been for this inquiry), is a fufBcient proof, of the many important confe- 
rences, of which it may be productive.—— Expecting the favour of an an- 
fwer in courfe, that I may take the necefiary meafures accordingly, in cafe 
an application to any other perfon fhould be requifite. I remain, with

" W HICH day ' in thC General A^embly of the Church of Scotland,

SIR, 

HIS Majefty having been gracioufly pleafed, to place me at the head of 
the Board of Agriculture, conftituted for the purpofe of promoting 
the internal improvement of the country, (a fituation which, I find, will be 
attended with great labour and fatigue), I am therefore extremely defi- 
rous, of bringing the Statiftical Account of Scotland, as quickly ai poflible, 
to a conclufion ; and I flatter myfelf, that it can eafily be now completed 
before Chriftmas. Your exertions for that purpofe, I am perfuadetl, will 
not be wanting ; and I will trouble you to inform me, in courfe of poft, 
when your return may be expected, as, without fuch information, the 
printing of the remaining volumes cannot well be arranged. I remain,

At any rate, he depends on hearing from you in courfe ; and he hopes 
that your letter, will either be accompanied with your account, or that you 
will have the goodnefs to point out the proper perfon to apply to for infor- 
mation, as no time can now be loft. If the parim does not furnifh great 
materials, any general information, as to the ftate of the population, agri- 
culture, church, ftipend, poor, fchool, boats, fifhermen, &amp;c. will be fuffi- 
cient, and your name will be prefixed or not, as may be moft agreeable.

SIR, 

J Have at laft the pleafure of finding, that the remaining deficient parifhes 
are fo few in nurnber, that I can now addrefs the Clergy, without ma- 
king ufe of a borrowed hand. The laft volumes are in the prefs, and I am 
in great hopes that it will be in my power to take the charge of them my- 
felf. I beg, therefore, that you would lofe ho time in fending me the Ac- 
count of your parifh, as M. S. is much wanted to keep the prefs a-going. I 
cannot think of leaving Scotland, without having this great undertaking, if 
poffible, completed ; and indeed I told the King, who takes a warm intereft 
in a Work, which would do credit to the reign of any Sovereign, that I fiat, 
teretl myfelf, I fhould be able to prefent the laft volume to his Majefty 
when I returned to England. I remain, with great regard, your very

A Circumstance has juft occurred, which muft give a considerable 
^~ degree of uneafinefs, to every perfon interested in the prosperity of that 
excellent iuftitution, the Society for the Benefit of the Sons of the Clergy. 
It is this : A plan, I underftand, is in contemplation, for publifliing an Ab- 
stract of the Statiftical Accounts, with a view of intercepting a corrfiderable 
ftiare of the emolument to be expected from that publication. In order to 
defeat fo invidious a project, I propofe to draw up the refult of the whole 
Inquiry myfelf, in a feparate Work, to accompany the laft volume of the 
Statiftical Publication ; but, for that purpofe, it is abfolutely necefTary, that 
I fhould immediately have all the deficient parishes in my pofTedion; of 
which, I ha.ve the pleafure to inform you, there are only 14 now remain- 
ing, each of which I am in daily expectation of receiving. You will, I am 
perfuaded, fee the neceffity of fending me the Account of your parifli in 
courfe ; for until it arrives, no progrefs can be made in drawing up the in- 
tended Abltract. I hope that this meafure will defeat the malicious inten- 
tion of thofe people, and will be the means of fecuring a considerable Aim, 
for a very Benevolent Iuftitution, whofe fuccefs we muft all feel a pleafure

from the Clergy are now coming in fo rapidly, that I have every reafon 
to hope, there will be hardly a deficient parilh agniiift the meeting of 
the enfuing General Affembly. I need fcarcely remark, that the lboner fuch

cerned, and the better for the country ; for, till it is completed, thofe plans 
for the improvement of Scotland, which will be the refult of this inquiry,

As the Statistical Inquiry commenced during the Aflembly 1790, and is

of Scotland will make every poflible exertion, rather than fuffer another 
Aflembly to pafs over, with a lift of deficients, however fmall. He hopes

No XXII. Printed Note, circulated by the Duke of Argyll, the Earl 
of Fife, the Reverend Principal Robert fan, &amp;c. amongft the Clergy, 
urging them to tranfmit their Statulical Accounts. 

THE DUKE OF ARGYLL prefents his compliments to 
Hopes that the letter and the queries, addrefied to the Clergy of the 
Church of Scotland, by Sir John Sinclair, have been received. As fuch 
Statiftical Inquiries are of great public importance, and may prove, in vari- 
ous refpedts, of eflential fervice to the country, it is requefted that every 
poihble attention may be paid to them. It is not neceflary that all the que- 
ries Ihould be anfwered ; only fuch as are the moll material, and on the 
points with which you are the beft. acquainted. At the fame time, the 
more information that can be given regarding tlte population^ aad the poli- 
tical circumjlancej of the country, the more deferable. The queftions re- 
garding the natural hiftory, and the antiquities of the parifli, are not fo ef- 
fential, and are only intended for fuch of the Clergy as may have dedicated 
their attention to fuch inquiries. It is alfo requefted, that you would re- 
commend this inveftigation, when any opportunity offers, to the Clergy in 
your neighbourhood, and to your friends in the Church. 

N. B. Several of thefe notes were tranfmitted by the Duke of Argyll, 
the Earl of Fife, the Reverend Principal Robertfon, &amp;c, to the Clergy of 
their acquaintance.

GENTLEMEN, 

J Have the honour of fending herewith, a copy of the very intelligent 
and fatisfactory Statiftical Account, tranfmitted to me, of the Univcr- 
fity of Glafgow ; and it is my earneft wifti, to be able to print, by way of 
Appendix to the kit volume of the Statiftical Account of Scotland, fimilar 
Accounts of all our Scotch Univerfities. It muft be attended with many 
good confequences, and will throw great light upon the important fubject 
of education in general, to have, not only fhort hiftories of thefe Univerfi- 
ties, and a view of their method of proceeding, in carrying on the educa- 
tion of youth ; but alfo obfervations on the rules and practices, which have 
been found, by experience, moft beneficial for that efiential purpofe. I am 
perfuaded, that I may fafely rely upon your exertions, for procuring me 
fuch an Account of a feminary, refpecting which, from the celebrity it has 
obtained, the public will naturally be anxious to have authentic informa- 
tion. The only particular, in addition to thofe mentioned in the Glafgow 
Account, which I Ihould be glad to have, is a ftate of the number of flu- 
dents who have attended the Univerfity fince the commencement of the 
prefent century ; diftinguifliing, rft, Each year ; id, The country whence 
they came, as Scotland, England, Ireland, America, or foreign countries ; 
and, 3d, The number who have attended the different clafies reflectively. 
This is to be added to the Glafgow Account. I have the honour to be, 
with great regard and efteem, Gentlemen, your very obedient, and faithful 
humble fervant,

means left untried, that were likely to bring it to a fpeedy conclufion, as 
foon as the poffibility of completing the Work was afccrtained. It is pro- 
per, at the lame time, to obierve, that many of the Clergy, who were thus 
fo dilatory, were not indifpofed to the caufe, or unwilling to oblige me, 
and far lefs, incapable of drawing up Accounts of their refpective pariffies; 
but they put it off from year to year, in expectation of additional informa- 
tion, or thinking they would Jlill be in time enough for the lajl volume, 
little considering, that the delays of only 50, out of about 900 individuals, 
actually put off the accomplimment of this Work, for the fpace of above 
three years. 



APPENDIX, F. 

Extracls of various Letters, approving of the STATISTICAL ACCOUNT 
0 F SCOTLAND, and urging a Perfeverance in that Undertaking. 

A S it was my intention, in writing the Hiftory of the Origin and Progrefs 
of the Statistical Account of Scotland, and the Appendix annexed 
thereto, to lay before the reader, the various circumftances which tended to 
bring that important Work to a conclufion, I am thence induced, to add 
die following Extracts of Letters from feveral refpectable quarters, wliofe 
approbation, undoubtedly, materially contributed to induce me to perfevere 
in the attempt, when otherwife my zeal might have flagged, from the de- 
lays and difficulties which it was neceffary to encounter. It is to be confi- 
dered, that this great undertaking, was carried on by a fingle individual, at 
his own rifk. and expence, and that nothing could have Supported him, in 
going through fo great a labour, but the fulleft conviction of the great im« 
portance of the meafure, and the circumftance, of its having met with the 
approbation of many refpectable individuals, both at home and abroad. 
Some of the letters I received on the fubject, particularly from the pre- 
fent Emperor of Ruffia, from Count Bernftorff, Prime Minilter at the Court 
of Denmark, and others, having been accidentally left in London, cannot 
be inferted in this place ; but the reader will eafily perceive, that the Au- 
thor muff have been a good deal animated in his purfuit, by thofe which 
follow.

In printing the following feries, it was on the whole thought preferable, 
to preferve their order, in point of time, rather than any other mode of ar-

No I. Extract of a Letter from the Reverend Dr Robert Henry, the 
Hiftorian, dated the 19th July 1790. 

j Had the honour to receive your printed letter, with the inclofed paper, 
a few days ago. A perfect knowledge of the population, and other cir- 
cumftances of our country, may be of great utility : Greater perhaps tkafi 
can be at prefent forefeen. You are much to be commended, Sir, for your 
efforts to obtain that knowledge, and fhbuld be aflifted by every Scotch- 
man, who hath it in his power. I am forry, that my retired fituation, and 
very precarious ftate of health, make it impoffible for me to be of fo much 
ufe to you as I wifli. — Befides, I am engaged in finifliing the fixth volume 
of my Hiftory of Great Britain, a work of which you may, perhaps, have 
heard. 



No II. Extract of a Letter from George Dempfter, Efq; dated 14th 
February 1791. 

THE reafon of my troubling you at prefent, is, to return you my thanks 
for the fpecimen of the StatifticaL obfervations. This is a molt valu- 
able and ufeful work. It is a real Dooms-day Book, and promifes to be 
more read and quoted than any book printed fince Dooms-day Book. The 
older it grows, the more valuable it will prove. The object of this letter 
is, to entreat you to go on with it. Your induftry is fully adequate to the 
talk. It will alfo place the intelligence and good fenfe of our Clergy, in 
a very advantageous point of view. When the general approbation of the 
public follows this of mine, which it certainly will do, I pray you to ex- 
tend your views to England and Ireland, and give us all the three king- 
doms. The fale will defray the expence, and found an academy at 
Thurfo. 

No III. Extra6l of a Letter from Sir David Dahymple, (Lord Hailes). 
on receiving the fpecimen of the four lirft Pariflies of the Statiltical 
Account, dated 18th February 1791.

bly, till you perfect a Work yourfelf, by which your name will be as cer- 
tainly handed down to pofterity, as William the Conqueror, and with much

J Thank you for the copies yon fent me, of the papers now circulat-

taining juft information, on matters connected with the political circum-

which are equally interefting to both our countries. I entirely approve of 
your very excellent idea, that of inveftigating the interior ftate of every

have nfually the requifite knowledge and capacity, as well as the neceffary

well known Dr Gilbert Stuart), one of the bell fcholars, and one of the 
nbleft men, at that Univerfity, when it certainly rivalled, for erudition 
and talents, the moft celebrated feminaries in Europe. I had attended 
his clafs, but had not feen him for many years. It was by the mereft 
accident, (franking a letter to him), that any intercourfe was renewed, 
between us. The refpedtable Profeflbr, thought he would embrace that 
opportunity, of encouraging his old Pupil to perfevere in a courfe, which 
met with his particular approbation. I think it right to give a larger 
extract from that letter, as it may be as ferviceable to other young men, 
as to the pcrfon to whom it was addrefled.

make a report on 57 heads, the major part of which related to geography, 
to natural and civil hiftory, to heraldry, to agriculture, to the productions 
of each diftrict, to mineralogy, &amp;c. ; but there were feveral alfo, purely 
Statistical, as, 

I. What is the prefent number of houfes and families ? Were they for- 
merly more numerous ? If fo, to what caufe muft be attributed the 
fubfequent diminution ? 

II. Are all the inhabitants employed in ufeful labour ? 

III. Are the people profperous and flourilhing ? What manufactures d» 
they carry on ? And in what do they excel ? 

IV. What wafte lands and commons luwe they ? What is the value of 
thefe to the community ? 

V. What is the value of the biflioprick, and of all the livings in the dio- 
cefe, &amp;c. &amp;c. ? 

It is evident, as Mr Townfend very juftly remarks, from the general 
i'cope of thefe inquiries, that the defign of Philip II. was to gain a perfect 
knowledge of his kingdom, with a view to political economy ; but, in order 
to dazzle the eyes of his fubjects, he intermixed queries, which had no re- 
ference to that object *. 

It is not known whether any material progrefs was made in this under- 
taking ; but it certainly does more credit to the memory of the Sovereign 
under whofe aufpices it was commenced, than any circumftance, connected 
with his reign, that is recorded in hiftory. 

1. Sweden. — The fecond attempt, in modern Europe, feems to have been 
made in Sweden, anno 1630. The nature of the plan will appear, from 
a circular letter, addreffed to the Clergy of his diocefe, by the Aichbilhop 

of

I believe that no notice of this inquiry is taken, in any of the hiltories of thi« 
Monarch's reign.

* The following tranflation of that letter, tranfmitted to me by Mr Knox 

of Gottenburgh, may not be unacceptable to the reader. 

Be it known to you all, by thefe prefents, That his Majefty, our mod 
gracious Lord and King, out of his royal favour and grace, having, with 
peculiar care and good affection for his fubjects, deliberately taken into 
confideration, a plan, which in a various, extenfive, and praife- worthy 
manner, may tend to the lafting honour and renown of our dear native 
country, 

Has been gracioufly pleafed, on the 30th May 1 630, worthily to confti- 
tute, and with full powers to appoint, the well learned Dr Martinum Af- 
chaneun, in Himmelby and Freftad, and Johan Hindrickfon, to be antiqua- 
ries for the kingdom. 

That his Majefty has furnifhed thefe learned men, with letters of inftruc- 
tion, ordaining them, narrowly and zealoufly, to fearch over the whole 
kingdom, after all remarkable old monuments, tranfactions, writings, and 
manufcripts, by which the hiftory of our native country can be illuftrated. 

To collect fuch, and make their remarks on them ; and more efpecially 
to attend to the following points, namely, to collecl, 

I. All kinds of Runic writings, both in books, and upon (tones, 

II. Runic computations, or the various diftinctions and difference of 
Runic characters. 

III. Old law-books, corporation rights, fecret papers, ftatutes, privileges, 
and edicts. 

IV. Old chronicles, hiftories, tables, Runic and heroic poems. 

V- Such old letters and writings as can afcertain the value of coins, and 

elucidate the genealogy and arms of noble families. 
VI. Old coins and monies. 

And, in fhort, any thing further, which tends to the praife-ivorthy inv 
firovement of our native country. 

All which, the fore-named learned men, are to depofit in the Royal Ca- 
binet ; and the refult of their refeai ches, (hall, for the benefit and improve- 
ment of the kingdom, be afterwards publiflied. 

Therefore I, in his Majefty's name, earneilly and zealoufly requeft, that 
you feverally, in your different parilhes, do truly examine your parifhioners, 
rich apart, about ufeful old monuments, &amp;c. which they, out of mifcon- 

ception,

plius, was too great a King, and too wife a Statefmen, to confine his atten- 
tion, on fuch an occafion, to thofe objects merely, but farther extended it, 
to every thing that could promote " the praife-worthy improvement of his 
*' native country." What a Sovereign ! who could thus unite, to the mod 
fplendid military achievements, fuch an attention to the arts of peace, and 
the purfuits of literature, on which, he knew well, that the happinefs and 
profperity of his fubjects fo materially depended. 

It is quite uncertain, with what fuccefs this attempt was attended, 
though it is rather improbable, that any great progrefs v/as effected, other- 
wife fome notice would have been taken of it in the hiftoiies of thofe times. 
Indeed, as Guftavus commenced his war in Germany, in June 1630, it is 
•rather improbable, that fuch an undertaking could be carried on in his ab- 
fence, with fufficient zeal and energy. 

In modern times, a very intelligent political account has been publifhed 
of Sweden, by Monfieur Canzler, a native of Saxony, who had refided at 
the Court of Stockholm in a diplomatic line, and had collected together a 
number of curious and interesting public accounts, reflecting the ftate of 
the Swedifh monarchy. It was originally publifhed in the German, but 
was afterwards tranflated into French #. 

3. France. — The next investigation of the fort, feems to have taken place 
anno 1698, by directions of Lewis XIV. of France, who ordered the 
lntendants of his different provinces, to draw up a particular account of 
each province, for the inftruction of the Duke of Burgundy. It is believed, 

that 



ception, are apt to conceal ; that you communicate your refearches to his 
Majefty's antiquaries, fent through the kingdom on this laudable errand, 
in order that they may, at once, have at hand, the ufeful information above 
mentioned, for forwarding this important bufinefs, fo that his Majefty's 
royal will may be gratified, the work be attended with fuccefs, and finally 
carried into full execution. 

And that all this may be truly and faithfully accornplifhed on your part, 
I earneftly and zealoufly exhort you.

'that none of thofe provincial accounts have been printed. Voltaire men- 
tions, with great approbation, the account of Languedoc, drawn up by Mon- 
fieur de Lamoignon de Bavrlle. In conl'cquence of the obliging attention 
of Dr Nalli, of Bevere, in Worcefterfhire, I had m opportunity of penvfing 
that work, in manufcript, and was perfectly altonifhed, at the little ufeful 
information which it contained. If that was the beft, the others muft have 
been miferable indeed. The obfervations made by Voltaire on this under- 
taking, are perfectly well founded. He remarks, " Had what the King di- 
" reeled, been well executed, the collection would have been one of 
" the moil valuable monuments of the age. The defign was excellent , 
and it would have been of the greateft ufe, had it been executed with 
f judgment and uniformity *." 

4. Germany. — It has already been remarked, that great attention has been 
paid in Germany to Statiitical Inquiries. Baron Bielficld, in his Elements 
of Univerfal Erudition f, gives the beft account of any which I have hither, 
to met with, of the progrefs made in that part of the Continent. The fci- 
ence called Statiltics, he obferves, " teaches us what is the political ar- 
" rangement of all the modern Jlates of the known world.'" Profeflbr 
Godfrey Achenwal of Gottingen, was the firft to reduce that important 
fubject into a true fyltem. He has made it a feparate fcience, " whence," he 
obferves, " hiftory borrows great lights, which furniflies the beft materials 
*' for the conftitution of a ftate, which enriches politics, and which prepares 
" thofe of the brighter! genius among the ftudious youth, to become one 
" day able minifters of the ftate." 

The following is a fhort abftract of the particulars, which, according to 
Baron Bielfield, are included in the fcience of Statiftics. 1. A general 
knowledge of the ftates, into which Europe, and the other quarters of the 
globe, are refpedlively divided. 2. An examintion of each particular ftate, 
and its revolutions. 3. A defcription of the territory of the ftate, and its 
foreign pofl'eflions. 4. An account of its population, 5. Its conftitution, 
and arrangement of its public affairs. 6. The rights and privileges of its 
Magiftrates. 7. The rights of the people, in regard to national affemblies, 
&amp;.c. 8. The titles, courts, ceremonials, &amp;c. of the Sovereign. 9. The 
arrangement of the Cabinet, more efpecially the management of foreign af- 
fairs. 10. The direction of its interior, or domeftic concerns. 11. The 
national church, n. The judicial department. 13. The principal regula- 
tions with regard to its police. 14. The rel'ources of the ftate, whether

from agriculture, and all its natural productions, or manufactures, or com- 
merce, interior and exterior, or mercantile navigation. 15. The revenue* 
^ of the ftatc, and the manner of collecting and employing them. 16. The 
^ftate of the arts and fciences, of fchools, univerfities, &amp;c. 17. Its military 
forces, and mode of management. iS. Its marine. 19. Its internal interefts. 
And, laftly, Its external interefts,. or the maxims it ought to obferve, with 
regard to its neighbours, allies, &amp;.c. 

Such is the wide field, into which the fcience of Statiftics has been extend- 
ed in Germany, and which the Germans have been cultivating for about 
50 years, with all that painful refearch which belongs to the character of 
that refpectable nation. It is unfortunate that German literature is fo little 
cultivated in England ; hence the mafs of Statiftical information, collected 
in that part of the Continent, would probably have been little known here, 
had it not been for the Political Survey of the prefent State of Europe, 
written by Profefior Zimmerman *. In that ingenious and interefting work, 
we have an abftract of all the information which the Germans had accumu- 
lated ; from which, however, it does not appear, that any work was known 
in that part of the world, which can at all rival, for extent of ufeful infor- 
mation, the Statiftical Account of Scotland. 

t 

5. Denmark. — That refpectable ftatefman, the late Count Bemftorff", fent 
me a work in the German language, printed anno 1795, but never publifh- 
ed, which feemed to contain a great deal of Statiftical information. There 
were tables in it of the finances of Denmark, of its debt and expenditure, of 
the commerce of the kingdom, and ftatements of its army, navy, &amp;c. 
Some of the accounts were for the year 1778, but no material alteration 
had lince taken place ; and on the whole, it was the beft account that could 
be obtained of the political ftate of that kingdom. I wifhed much to ha\e 
had it tranflated into the Englilh language, and recommended it for that 
purpofe to the attention of the Britifti Government, as a knowledge of the 
ftate of one nation, is extremely material to another ; but the idea has not 
hitherto been carried into execution. 

6. England. — It appears from Gough's Britifti Topography, that inqui- 
ries into antiquities, and natural hiftory, have long occupied the attention 
of the Englifh. 

Some valuable county hiftories have been publifhed ; but of the 40 
counties into which England is divided, nine have found no antiquary 
hardy enough to attempt their general illustration ; and the collections 

which

which have been made for eight others, were with-held from the public, as 
late as the year 1 7 So. The account given of them by Mr Gough is not 
very t'avouiable ; he ilates, "that incorrect pedigrees futile etymologies, 
" verbofe dii'quifitions, crowds of epitaphs, lifts of landholders, and fuch far- 
" rago, thrown together, without method, unanimated b reflections, and 
" delivered in the moll uncouth and horrid ftyle, make the bulk of our 
county hiftories*." At the fame time, in fome of thofe works, fome ufe- 
ful facts may be obtained, and they furnifh materials, which may be offer- 
vice, when a Statiftical Survey of that kingdom, on a proper fyftem, is un- 
dertaken. 

But befides thefe county hiftories, various attempts have heen made in 
England, of a more extenfive nature, more efpecially that general furvey, 
known under the name of Homes-day Book, which is thus defcribed by 
Hume the hiftorian : "In 108 1, William began' an undertaking, which 
" proves his extenfive genius, and does honour to his memory ; it was a ge- 
*• neral furvey of all the lands in the kingdom, their extent in each di- 
" ftrict, their proprietors, tenures, value, the quantity of meadow, pafture, 
" wood, and arable land, which they contained ; and in fome counties, the 
" number of tenants, cottagers, and flaves of all denominations, who lived 
" upon them. He appointed commiflioners for this purpofe, who entered 
" every particular in their regifter, by the verdict of juries; and after a la- 
" bour of fix years, (for the work was fo long in finilhing), brought him 
" an exact account of all the landed property of his kingdom. This monu- 
" ment, called Domes-day Book, the moft valuable piece of antiquity pof- 
" fefled by any nation, is ftill preferved in the Exchequer, and though only 
y fome extracts of it have hitherto been publiflied, it ferves to illuftrate to 
" us, in many particulars, the ancient ftate of England. The great Alfred 
" had finifhed a like furvey of the kingdom in his time, which was long 
" kept at Wincheller, and which probably ferved as a model to William in 
" this undertaking, f " 

It is unpardonable in the Britifh Government, not to have tranflated this 
record, and by tables or otherwife, to have explained the political ftate of 
Eugland, at the conqueft. The book is properly, indeed, a royal rent-roll, 
and was intended for the purpofe of ascertaining the income of the Crown, 
and the perfons by whom it was payable, But, at the fame time, it con- 
tains many curious facts, which would throw very confiderable light on the 
ancient ftate of the country, and which ought not to be kept in a manner 
unintelligible to the public, from the uncouthnefs of its character, and the 

multitude

multitude of its abbreviations. If Parliament does not take it up, perhap* 
it is rot beyond the powers of the Society of Antiquaries to accomplifh. 

Camden's £dtannia, in its prefent improved ftatc, is defervedly held in 
high eftimation, and many eminent perlbns, in every branch of literature, 
have, with infinite labour and refearch, contributed to illuftrate a number 
of articles, which, in the original editions of that work, had been either im- 
perfectly explained, or totally omitted. It is a work, however, better cal- 
culated for the purfuits of the antiquary, than of the ftatefraan. 

The Political Survey of Britain, by Dr Campbell, printed in two vo- 
lumes, 4to, anno 1774, is a judicious and laborious compilation, of all the 
information that the author could collect during a period of about 20 years. 
It contains a feries of reflections on the fituation, lands, inhabitants, reve- 
nues, colonies, and commerce, of this, ifland ; intended to fliew, that we have- 
not as yet approached near the fumtnit of improvement; but that it will af- 
ford employment to many generations, before they puih; to their utmofl: ex- 
tent, the natural advantages of Great Britain. 

In his preface, after giving a concife account of his attempt, he exprefsly 
fays, " on the plan here purfuedj we had no guide, though many helps and 
" informations, without which; whatever it may be, it could never have 
" been performed." 

He introduces the work with ftating, that in the light in which he was 
about to conlider it, " the perfection of policy is, fo to improve the natu- 
" ral advaantag^s in the poffeflion, or in the power of the fociety to which 
" it is applied, as to make all, without diftinction, who compofe thatfocie- 
" ty, as happy as it is poffible, and to place this happinefs on the firmeil 
" bafis, fo as that neither the ever mutable tempers of men, or the inevitable 
" viciflitudes of time, fliould affect it." 

The Doctor, unfortunately, had not materials fufHcient for completing, 
fuch a work; in the manner in which it ought to have been done. Had he 
lived a few years hence, polTeiTed as he was, of zeal, mduftry, and judg- 
ment, bis labours would have appeared to infinitely more advantage. 

I underftand that fome queries, probably at tile inftance of Government,, 
have, at various times, been circulated amongft the Englifh Clergy, by the 
Bifhops of their refpective diocefes. The rcfult of thefe inquiries I have not- 
been able to difcover, nor 'whether any public advantage has been derived' 
from them. 

It was, in fome refpects, with a view of afcertaining the ftate of the 
population of the kingdom, that a fmall duty was laid on chriftenings and 
burials; but the tax being found inadequate for that purpofe, and vexatious 
in its operation, it was foon afterwards repealed.

in- Parliament, I preffed much the idea, * that it might be the means of ob- 
« taining a Statiftical Account of England, and confequently of explaining 
" the real lituation of the country in every point of view, that could pofli- 
- bly be wiflied for by a Patriot or a Statefman. Such an Account of 
" Scotland was already nearly completed, and fpecimens of it having been 
m circulatedabroad.it had received the molt flattering marks of approba- 
" tion. If, in England therefore, the fame plan were executed, it would 
" hardly be doubted, that it would foon be univerfally adopted in every 
" other country, and thus the principles of political fociety, and the fources 
u of national improvement, would be more completely afcertained, than 
" in any former period of hiftory *". 

Various circiimftances have hitherto prevemed that idea from being ta- 
ken up, though undoubtedly of effential importance; but if ever the Board 
mould be placed on that refpedtable footing, to- whichjuch an inftitutiun is 
fo peculiarly well entitled, ^attention will necefTarily be directed to Sta- 
tiftical Inquiries, on an extenfive fcale. In the interim, the Agricultural 
Surveys, contain a great deal of interelting information of a fimilar nature. 

It may be proper here to add, that-Mefirs Williams, bbokfellers, Strand, 
London, have begun a Statiftical Survey of the principality of Wales, and 
would probably have made confiderable prbgrefs in it before this time, had 
not the ftate of the times been extremely unfavourable for fuch inveftig?.-

7. Ireland. — Iri Ireland, .they do notfeem to have been very fortunate, in 
their attempts to elucidate the ftate of that country. A fociety founded by- 
Petty and Molyneux, for philofophical inquiries, hardly fubfifted for five 
years. Another fociety was formed aboiit the year 1760, by whom a plan 
was drawn up for writing the defcriptions of counties ; but it is believed 
without much fuccefs. In the year 177 -;, the Dublin Society formed a 
Committee, by whom a number of queries were printed ; but in four years 
time, they only obtained- 40 anfu-ers, to 4000 copies they had circulated, 
many of which were perfectly trifling. The Committee was therefore 
dropped, and the fcheme abandoned, even by Major Valiancy, who had 
prevailed upon the Society to engage in it. Indeed a zealous and public- 
fpirited member of the Irifli Parliament, (the Right Honourable William 
Burton Conyngham), tranfmitted to me an account of the parifh of Kilro, 
nan, in the county of Rofcommon and, the adjoining diftrict, written by

which, he informed me, was the only one worth preferving in the whole 
collection. 

8. Scotland. — The attempts which have been made in Scotland, have been 
numerous, but their progrefs did not juftify any very fanguine expectations 
of fuccefs. 

The firft of which we have any account, was an inquiry begun by Sir Ro- 
bert Gordon of Straloch, at Bleau's requeft, for his Atlas Scotise, printed 
anno 1662. From the anfwers he received, the defcription'of feveral of the 
counties \vere drawn up, both by Sir Robert, and by David Buchanan, on 
whom he devolved it ; but the troubles during the reign of Charles I. and 
the uftirpation of Cromwell, prevented them from completing it. 

The next attempt was made by Sir Robert Sibbald, who alfo circulated 
queries, anfwers to which he requefted fhould either be addreffed to himfelf, 
or tranfmitted to his bookfeller. They principally relate to natural hifto- 
ry, to the illuftration of which, his chief attention was directed. His Atlat 
Scoticus, the refult of thofe inquiries, according to Gough, frill ezifts in 
manufeript, in which ftate it will probably remain *. 

The late Walter Macfarlane, of Macfarlane, left behind him in manu- 
feript, the Geographical defcriptions of many parifhes in Scotland, begun 
about the year 1722, and continued for feveral years afterf . Who was the 
author of this attempt does not appear ; but from a letter, beginning "Reve- 
" rend Sir," figned Lud. Grant, dated Fortrofe, 14th July 1732, it feems to 
have been undertaken by fome clergyman %. The following extract from 
Mr Grant's letter, (who was probably minuter of Fortrofe), it may not be 
improper to infert in this place. " I would have fent you what account 
" of the parifhes I was acquainted with here, fome time ago, had I not ex- 
" pected, that fome would have lent their helping hand, in defcribing fuch 
" parifhes as occurred to their knowledge ; but finding them cither fhy to 
" undertake, or unwilling to put themfelves to any fuch trouble, pretend- 
" ing their little or no {kill in topography ; I thought it proper not to de- 
" lay any longer, what I intended to fay upon the head; I have fent a de- 
" fcription of four parifhes ; fince I have now frequent occafion to traverfe 
" them, and though I did not keep clofe to the printed direEtion, yet I 
" think the fpecimen I have given, will furnifli you with materials to 
" range the bounds and diftances, in what order you think fit. The de- 
" % n » A n mv judgment, is laudable; and would be both diverting and in-

" {trailing, to have a clear and diftinct account of all the parifhes in our 
kingdom ; and none mould be averfe to contribute their endeavours, in 
" promoting and furthering fuch an excellent undertaking, which has not 
41 as yet been done by any pen that I know of ; and I cordially wifh it may 
" fucceed," &amp;c. 

From the little attention that had been paid to thofe inquiries, fo evident 
from this letter, much fuccefs could not be expected. Short memoran- 
dums refpedting a number of parifhes were received ; but hardly any of them 
entitled to be printed. It is Angular, that fome of the beft accounts are 
from the county of Caithnefs ; and indeed it is proper, on all fuch oc- 
calions, that the remote diftricts, which are the leaft known, mould, if 
poflible, be defcribed with the greateft minutenefs and accuracy. 

The next attempt was by Mr William Maitland, an author well known 
by his hiftory of London, and other works. He circulated alio a number 
of printed queries ; but I underftand, that the anfwers he received were 
very few, and that he foon found it neceflary to relinquifh the defign. 

It may be proper, in this place, to mention, the fuccefsful attempt made by 
the late Dr Webfter, which he begun in 1743, and completed in the year 
1755. Though reftridted merely to the ftate of the Church, and the popu- 
lation of the kingdom, yet this refpedlable clergyman, found the utmoll dif- 
ficulty, in completing his undertaking, in the fpace even of 12 years. It is 
fortunata, however, that he was able to accomplifh it ; as it furnifhes data, 
for making a comparifon between the population of that period, and of 
the prelent times ; without which, it would be hardly poflible to have fa- 
tisfied the public/that the inhabitants in Scotland had materially increafed 
within the laft 40 years. 

Mr Pennant, to whom the world owes fo much entertaining, and fo 
much ufeful information, was led to imagine, from the high idea he enter- 
tained of the Clergy of the Church of Scotland, that he could prevail 
upon them, to favour the public, with exadl defcriptions of their refpedlive 
panlhes ; and his wifhes were in fome inftances complied with, but not to 
any great extent. Scotland, however, mull always remember with grati- 
tude, the fpirit with which he pervaded every part of that country, and the 
favourable accounts he publifhed both of it, and of its inhabitants, which 
contributed to remove many of the prejudices entertained againfl them. 

I he laft attempt, previous to the commencement of the Statiftical Ac- 
count of Scotland, was by a refpedlable body, the Scotch Society of Anti-

the circulation of this paper, the accounts of five pariflies were obtained, 
which are printed in the ift volume of the Tranfactions of the Society; and 
are certainly amongft: the moft valuable papers of the fort any where to 
be met with. 

It was after fo many attempts had been made, either fruitlefsly, or on a 
narrow fcale, that the Author of the Statiftical Account of Scotland, be- 
gan his extenfive, laborious, and what was almoft universally deemed, hi$ 
impracticable undertaking. Perhaps an ambition to accomplifh what others 
had failed to execute, might contribute to thofe exertions, which could 
alone carry through fo great a Work. And if its publication fliould ever

ceived, above one half of the number of parifhes in Scotland. There was 
every reafon, therefore, to hope, that the whole Work would have been 
completed within the fpace of a year pr two more, and every exertion was 
made for that purpofe, by employing a number of different printers, &amp;.c. ; 
but the prefs was often flopped for want of manufci ipt. 

In the fecond place, It is evident, that on the a8th March 1794, only 140 
Accounts were wanting, and that it has taken very near four years to make 
up that deficiency. I am perfuaded, that the Clergy, had no conception of 
the inconvenience with which this circumftance was attended, to the Author 
of the Statiftical Account, and how much it retarded the meafures he had 
in view, for promoting the improvement of the country, otherwife they 
would have made almoft any exertion, fooner than have kept bacjc, for fo 

long a fpace of time, the completion of fuch a Work It is now over. 

But, I hope, if ever they fliould have it in their power to promote a fi- 
milar undertaking, that they will fhew, from the commencement, every pof- 
fible degree of alacrity and zeal in fuch a caufe ; and will recoiled the 
words of a refpe#able Clergyman, who well remarked on the occafion : 
" It has often been a matter of aftonifliment to me, that I have gone fo 
" much into the fpirit of procraftination, in a cafe like this, when an im- 
" portant object was held forth, and the individual exertion necefTary was 
" fo trifling." 

In the lajl place, It is certainly to be regretted, after the Work had 
made fuch extraordinary progrefs, that greafer exertions were r.;-t made by 
the deficient Clergy, to complete it more fpeedily than has been the cafe. 
1 At the fame time, that cannot detract from the great merit of the body at 
large ; and, on the whole, it is certainly more to be wondered at, that the 
Work was completed at all, than that it fhould have been fo long in hand. 
For a long time, indeed, many of the Clergy imagined, that the plan would 
be dropped, as fo many others had been ; and confequently, that it was on- 
ueceflary for them to take the trouble of making any inquiry. Indeed, on 
the 8th November 1792, above two years and a half from the commence- 
ment of the undertaking, no lets a number than 210, had not even acknow- 
ledged the receipt, or taken the fmalleft notice, of my repeated applica- 
tions. 

With regard to the progrefs made in printing the Wprk, the following 
Table will fatisfy the curi«fity of the Reader.

CONCLUSION. 

Mints explaining the Nature and Objett of a Work, to be entitled. 
" Analyfis of the Political State of Scotland, with a View of the 
" Principles of Statijlical Philofophy" the refult of the Statijtical 
Account of Scotland. 

IT was my intention, to have printed, with the laft volume of the Statifti- 
cal Account of Scotland, a general View or Analyfis of the Political 
State of that part of the Kingdom, together with fome explanation of tha 
Principles of what may be called Statiftical Philofophy. But I find, that 
fuch an undertaking, will require more leifure than it is poffibl^ for me at 

prefcnf.

prefent to beftow nffcti it, and perhaps it may be as well, to give fuch an 
account of a kingdom, at fo marked a period, as the conclufion, or the 
commencement of a century ; and if health will permit, and no accident 
intervenes to prevent it, I hope that it will be in my power, in the courfe 
of the year 180O, or i8cu. to publilh fuch a Work, as cannot be rivalled, 
in regard to the Hate of any other country. 

In the interim, I think it proper to lay before the public, fome informa- 
tion refpecting the plan of that Work, as it may induce public-fpirited in- 
dividuals, to favour me with their remarks upon it ; and in cafe any cir- 
cumftance fliould prevent me, from executing fuch a Work myfelf, it may 
furnilh hints to any other perfon by whom it may be undertaken. With 
that view, I have drawn up the following general obfervations, applicable 
to an Account of Aberdeenlhire, as a fpecimen of the manner, in which the 
mals of information contained in the Statiftical Account, ought partly ta 
be arranged by parifhes and counties, before any important refult can be 
drawn from it. 



General Obfervations, refpe£ting the Refults to be drawn from the 
Statiflical Account of Scotland, and the manner in which the fame 
ought to be made. 

a Considerable proportion of the vaft mafs of important information, 
contained in the Statiftical Account of Scotland, may b« condenfed, 
into a fmall compafs, in three different ways : 1. There are a variety of ar- 
ticles, as the General State of the Population, &amp;.c. where the information 
may be given, in the fliape of Parochial Tables: 2. There are other parti- 
culars, as the State of Property, &amp;c, where calculations by Counties, may 
be preferred : And, 3. There are many other points, where general compu- 
tations for the Kingdom at large, will be found more eligible. 

In regard to each of thefe, the attention of the reader is requefted, to the 
following Preliminary Obfervations. 

L FAROCHIAL TABLES. 

Though it could not be expected, that complete information could be 
procured, refpecling all the particulars contained iri the following Tables, 
from every individual Clergyman, yet a-fufficient number of facTrs has been 
obtained, to form calculations, the average refult of which, will be fuffi- 
ciently accurate for every ufeful purpofe. There is indeed every reafon to 

believe. 



Appendix. lxxxvii 



believe, that computations, though, perhaps inaccurate in regard to parti- 
cular dillri&amp;s, may on the whole be right. Where they are drawn upon a 
great fcale, and on proper data, they may approach very near the truth, 
eyen where, in many of the minute particulars, there are considerable er- 
rors *. 

In the following Statistical Tables there are 14 Columns. 

Column r. This will merely contain the names of the different Pariflies 
in each Country, arranged in alphabetical order, to which, if thought necef- 
fary, might be added, the volume of the Statiftical Account of Scotland, 
where the defcription of each parifli is to be found. In feveral inftances, 
pariflies are fituated in different counties. Where that is the cafe, the whole 
diflrict is included in that county, where either the Church or the greater 
part of the parifli is fituated. 

Col. 2. 



* The following example will explain the meaning of this obfervation. 
Let us fuppofe that there are 4 pariflies, the valued rent of which is known, 
but only two of which have their real rent returned ; for inftance, 

Valued Rent, Scotch money. Real Rent, Sterling money. 

No. 1 L. 5300 L. 3100 

— 2 3500 I3 oo 

L- SSoo L. 4400 

It is evident, that the average of the two pariflies, is at the rate of L. 2 
of valued, to L. 1 of real rent. 

- Let us fuppofe, that the other two pariflies, have their valued rent return- 
ed as follows. 

Valued rent 
No. 3 L. 4200 

— 4 755° 



L.n 



75o 



According to the data above mentioned, the real rent of No. 3. ought 
to be L. 2100, and of No. 4. L. 3775, both of which may be wrong ; the 
one may be too much, and the other too little, yet the one error mty cor- 
rect the other, and the total refult may be perfe&amp;ly right. 

So accurate, however, was the above . mode of computation found that 
the real rent of one parifli, computed at L. 2450, was found, by the Mini- 
tfev's return, to be L. 2460. 



Ixxxviii 



Appendix, 



Col. 2. The fecond column will give a ftaiement of the population of 
Scotland, as drawn up for the information of Government, by the late Rev. 
Br Alexander Webfter, one of the Minifters of Edinburgh, and completed 
by him in the year 1755. The Doctor's account was never printed, but 
there are fome copies of it, in manuscript, in private hands. In his intro- 
duction to the report, he ftates, " That he had eftabliftied, in the year 1743, 
" a general correfpondence both with clergy and laity, for preparing a 
" fcheme, which was afterwards ratified by Parliament, for a provifion 
" for Minifters widows : That he had improved that correfpondence, for 
■' the purpofe of procuring lifts, either of individuals, or of perfons above a 
" certain age, in the different parifties of Scotland : That, when the lifts 
" contained- only thofe above a certain age, he calculated the amount of 
" the whole inhabitants, by the proportion which they might be fuppofed 
" to bear to the number of fouls, according to the moft approved Tables, 
" compared with the fact in many parts of Scotland, where the Minifters, 
" at his defire, not only numbered tJieir pari/hioners, but diftinguiftied their 
" refpedtive ages. So that, it is humbly apprehended, the account he has 
" given of the number of the people, is fufficiently exact toanfwer every 
" valuable purpofe." 

Dr Webfter's original inquiries, it would appear, were merely for the 
purpofe of fixing data, to calculate the principles, on which the Society for 
the benefit of the Widows of the Scotch Clergy, might be eftabliftied : But 
afterwards, at the defire of that refpectable character, the late Prefident 
Dundas, then Lord Advocate for Scotland, to whom the work is dedicated, 
lie drew up a General Report, with a view of afcertaining : t. The popula- 
tion of Scotland. 1. The income of the Clergy, an augmentation of which 
was then a fubject of difcuffion. 3. The Patrons of the different livings, 
and, 4. The number of fighting men, an inquiry confidered to be of pecu- 
liar importance at that period, in confequence of the warlike lpirit which 
the Highlanders had then recently difplaycd, a fmall body of whom had 
boldly marched from their native mountains, till they had reached within a 
few miles of the metropolis of the empire. The number of fighting men in 
Scotland, were then computed at 253,076 — 

It is extremely fortunate, in many points of view, that this inquiry was 
begun and completed. In the fnft place, it enabled Dr Webfter, (whofe 
exertions on this occafion, and Ikill in political arithmetic, cannot be too 
much praifed), to draw ftp the calculations for the Widows fund, on fuch 
juft principles, that the rt fult has turned out hardly in any refpect different 
from his computations ; a,nd thus a moft valuable infiitution was efiablifh- 
ed, on foundations creditable to the author of it, and advantageous to a moft 
refpectabie body of men. — In the fecond place, it fumiflies a ufeful fource 
of companion, with the prefent population of the country, which otherwise 

could

could not have been attained. It is certain, that the fame pains were not 
"then taken by the Clergy, as at the prefent period. A much longer fpace 
of time was alfo employed in carrying on the inquiry, for it was begun in 
1743, and not ended till 1755, a period of about twelve years ; whereas the 
prefent inquiry has been completed in lefs than eight years. At the fame 
time, had it not been for Dr Webfter's report, it would have been impof- 
fible to have convinced jnany, that the population had not materially de- 
creafed. Indeed, fo prevalent is the inclination to praife the times part, 
and undervalue the pre/ent, that in the courfe of thefe Statistical Inquiries, 
I have found the Clergy, in gueffing the population in 17551 have in every 
inftance exceeded the number ftated by Dr Webfter, and have almoft uni- 
formly gone below the truth, if they made a rough guefs of the number of 
their parifliioners at this time, which evidently appeared, when afterwards 
they were prevailed upon, to take the trouble of making a fpecial enumera- 
tion. Dr Webfter, however, and the Clergy at that time, had every pof- 
fible inducement, to make the population of Scotland as confiderable as 
they could. The Doctor was drawing up a paper for the confederation of 
Government, in whole eyes he would naturally be inclined to place his na- 
tive country, in as favourable and refpedtable a light as poffible ; and the 
Clergy were to make a return of facts, on the accuracy of which, the future 
comfort of their wives and families, and the augmentation of their own li- 
vings, a point at that time in difcuffion, depended. It is impoflible, there- 
fore, to fuppofe, that the population of Scotland, could, in fuch circumitafl- 
ces, be undervalued. 

Col. 3d. This column contains the Population as returned to the Au- 
thor of this Work, in the courfe of his Inquiry, which has occupied the 
fpace of about eight years. There is reafon to believe, that the population 
of fuch an extent of country, was never before fo accurately taken. Not 
only the number of the inhabitants, but alfo very fatisfactory information 
refpecting their ages, the place of their birth, their religious perftsafions, 
their occupations and lituations in life, their refidence, whether in towns, in 
villages, or in the country, together with Tables of the number of Births, 
Deaths, and Marriages, in each Diftrict, have been given. Thefe are parti- 
culars, however, the confideration of which it is propofed to referve, for 
thofe general computations which will be drawn up, to explain the in- 
ternal Structure of fociety in Scotland, and the general ftate of the king- 
dom. This column, therefore, will only contain the prefent ftate of our 
population. , 

Col. 4th and 5th. The Population in 1755, and its prefent ftate, being 
thus afcertained, it is next propofed, to give a general view of the increafe 
or decreafe in each parifli, for the purpofe of grounding an Inquiry, the re- 
lult of which mull be extremely important, as in confequence of it, thofe

raeafures will be recommended to the attention of the public, which have 
been found to occation an increafe of population, whilft thofe which have 
been unfortunately diftinguiflied by a contrary tendency, will be distinctly 
enumerated, and unlefs counterbalanced by fome ftriking advantages, will 
be juftly reprobated. 

Col. 6th. This column gives a view of the Valued Rent, which is al- 
ways ftated in Scotch money, L. T2 of which is only equal to L. i Sterling. 
This is the rate according to which the Land Tax is now affefied. It was 
originally introduced during the Ufurpation of Cromwell, but was after- 
wards more fully eftablifhed by an act of die Scotch Convention, in 1667. 
In fome cafes, the valuation taken during the government of the Protector, 
continues the rule; but in general, new valuations have iince been taken, 
which have been occafionally altered from time to time. The rents, how- 
ever, being etiimated at a remote period, are certainly in general low. At 
the fame time, the proportional increafed value, compared to that of Eng- 
land, would not have been considerable, had not the Agricultural fyftem, 
and legal policy of Scotland, been infinitely more favourable to improve- 
ment than thofe of her filter kingdom. 

Col. 7th. In the next column, the Real Rent is ftated in Sterling money. 
I know that fome doubts are entertained, how far it is prudent to lay this 
information before the public, as if it were poflible to alter that folemn 
compact between the two nations, by which their refpective proportions of 
the Land Tax were for ever afcertained *. The fact, however, is, that on 

this 



# Nothing can be ftronger or more explicit than this Article. It is con- 
ceived in die following terms : 

Art. 9th. *' That whenever the fum of one million, nine hundred, nine- 
" ty-feven thoufand, feven hundred and fixtv-three pounds, eight millings 
« an d fourpence halfpenny, fliall be enacted by the Parliament of Great 
" Britain, to be railed in that part of the United Kingdom called England, 
" on land and other things ufually charged in Acts of Parliament there, for 
" granting an aid to the Crown by a Land Tax : That part of the United 
■ Kingdom now called Scotland, fhall be cliarged by the fame Act, with a 
" fum of forty-eight thoufand pounds, free of all charges, as the quota of 
" Scotland to fuch tax, and fo propoi tionably for any greater or lefTer fum 
« raifed in England by any tax on land, and other things ufually charged 
" together with the land ; and that fuch quota for Scotland, in the cafes 
« aforefaid, be raifed and collected in the fame manner as the Cefs now 
" is in Scotland ; but fubject to fuch regulations, in the manner of collec. 
" ting, as fliall be made by the Parliament of Great Britain.

this head there is no ground for complaint on the part of England, or for 
apprehenfion on the part of Scotland. Let the Englifh pafs a general bill 
of iuclofure ; let them modify tithes, fo as to prevent their being a bar to 
improvement ; let them reftrain the poors rates within moderate bounds; 
let them aboiifh any obnoxious remnants of the feudal fyftem ; let them 
grant proper leafes to their tenants, and let them demand afl adequate in- 
come from their eftates, and the land of England will foon be as cheaply 
taxed as that of Scotland. It is owing to the circumftances above alluded 
to, that the rents of Scotland have proportionably increafed more, under all 
the difadvantages of an inferior foil, of an inferior climate, of an inferior ca- 
pital, and of inferior markets. Give England the fame legal advantages 
which Scotland at prefent happily pofiefle?, and its Agricultural profperity 
would increafe, in fuch a ratio, that the Land Tax it is now fubject to 
■would not be felt. 

It is proper here to obferve, that in many inftances the Clergy were re r 
ftrained from giving any return of die Real Rent, from an appreheufion of 
giving offence to their pariftiioners. Where that is the cafe, the real rent 
is computed, according to the proportion of the real td the valued rent, in 
thofe parilhes where a return of both has been made, and consequently on 
data, that cannot, on the whole, be materially erroneous*. 

Col. 8th. The next column relates to the Stipends of the Clergy. 
Their income confifts, 1. Of Money ftipend — 2. Of Grain, compi t-hending 
various articles, as wheat, barley, bigg, or inferior barley, oats, and oat- 
meal—And, 3. The value of a glebe, which is not, in all cafes, of mat h life 
to the incumbent ; but inftead of entering into all thofe articles fepai i ly, 
it was thought more advifable to convert" the whole into one fum, ar.d to 
ftate the Income of each Minifter in turnulo. To thefe ecclefiaftical ex- 
pences, there is to be added a fum for communion-elements, i. e. for pur- 
chafing wine and bread when the Sacrament is celebrated, which fum, how- 
ever, 



* The real rents of Scotland might be very nearly known, by exa- 
mining the late proceffes for augmenting the livings of the Clergy, where 
the rent of the parifti is always mentioned, and from which few parilhes 
have been exempted. About 40 years ago, the whole land rent of Scot- 
land was only computed to amount to L. 600,000 per annum. The increafe 
is greatly owing to the higher price of grain, of cattle, and other agricultu- 
ral productions. It remains to be afcertained, by computing the value of 
money, in purchafing the neceflaries of life, and the labour of man, at va- 
rious periods, what the difference really is.

ever, does not, in every inftance, pay the expence attending the celebration. 
The amount will be feparately ftated, when information fufficiently accurate 
can.be obtained, 

The price of the grain will vary, in the different counties, according to the 
quality commonly raifed in each. 

Col. 9 til. Scotland has long been celebrated for the attention paid to 
the education of its inhabitants, and it is believed to be the only kingdom in 
Europe, where a fchool is eftabtlhed by law in every parilli, and where, for 
a very inconfiderable fura, the children of the pooreft cottager may be 
taught to read and write, and even fome of the higher branches of educa- 
tion. — The effects of this on fociety will be an important fubject of inqui- 
ry. — It was judged extremely defirable, therefore, to afcertain the number 
of Scholars in each diftrict — Where no returns were made, an afterifk i- 
prefixed, and the number was computed, according to the population of the 
diftriet, in proportion to that of other parilhes, where the returns were com- 
plete. 

Col. iotli. In the ntxt column, there is an eftimate of the legal Salaries 
paid to the Parochial Schoolmaiters. — Where no return has been made, an 
afterifk is placed, and the blank is filled up, according to the average of the 
other parilhes. In addition to the legal falaries, the fchoolmafters have 
certain emoluments of a cafual nature, which will be feparately eftima- 
ted ; but altogether,, they form an inadequate compenfation, for fo ufeful a 
body of men. 

Col. nth. The Number of the Poor in each parifh is Mated \r this co- 
lumn. Where no return was made, an afteriik is alfo prefixed, and a com- 
putation is made, according to the average number of the poor, and of the 
population, in other parifhes, whence returns have been tranfmitted. This 
column includes the occafional, as well as the inrolled permanent poor, as 
the Clergy have rarely made a diftinction between them. 

Col. iath. The management of the poor in Scotland, is one of the moll 
curious and important particulars, connected with the Statiftical Hiftory of 
that country. — They are not only, in general, maintained by the voluntary 
contributions of the more opulent part of the inhabitants, but, from the care 
and frugality with which their funds have been managed, coniiderable funis, 
compared to the money received, have been accumulated. — It was thought 
advifable to give a general view of the fund thus created, which does fo 
much credit, both to the charitable difpofition of the people, and to the pru- 
dent management of thofe who have had the conduct of it. 

Col. 13th. This column contains the annual voluntary Collections, at 
the church doors of the different pai iflies, for the maintenance of the Poor. 

In fome diltricts in the l'outh of Scotland, the baneful fyftera of affeff- 

ments has been introduced.— Where that is the cafe, that circumftance will 

be

be ftated in a note. — The number of thofe diftricts have hitherto been very- 
few, and it is hoped they will not be fuffered to increafe. 

Col. 14. In this column will be ftated the Total Annual Income of the 
Poor, refulting from the intereft of their capital flock, the annual voluntary 
collections, the profit derived from the ufe of the pall or mort-cloth, which 
goes to the poor's fund, and the legal affefiments, where any have takerr 
place. In all the parifhes there are voluntary collections, but in many in- 
ftances, the returns made by the Clergy, ftate merely the total income, with- 
out difcriminating the particulars. 

This concludes the great mafs of information, which it is thought neceflk- 
ry to put into the fliape of Parochial Tables. 

II. COUNTY COMPUTATIONS. 

There are feveral particulars which it is thought better to endeavour to 
afcertain, by County, inftead of Parochial Computations. — Thefe relate, 
1. To the ftate of the landed property in the county. — 2. To the manner in 
which it is employed. — 3. To the number and value of the live-ftock which 
it maintains. — 4. To the amount of its agricultural productions, including 

timber. 5. To the productions of its manufactures and commerce. — 6. To 

the value of its mines, filheries, and kelp. — And, laftly, To the general ftate 
ofthediftrict. 

1. State of Property. — It is of the utmoft importance in every county, 
to afcertain the manner in which its territories is poflefled, whether by great 
or by fmall proprietors, in what proportion by each, what is the total num- 
ber of proprietors of land, what portion of the kingdom is held by cor- 
porations, and other points of a fimilar nature. With that view, it is pro- 
pofed to give fome account of the State of Property in each county, in re- 
gard to thefe particulars. 

a. Mode of Occupation. — In many of the parochial returns, an account 
is given of the manner in which the territory of the diftrict is employed.— 
But without accurate furveys of each, the information could not be com- 
plete, and it is impoflible to attempt this parochially. There are fufficient 
data, however, for making calculations, regarding the ftate of each county, 
in this important refpect. 

3. Live Stock.— The number and value of the domeftic animals main- 
tained in a country, is another object which it is defirable to afcertain. It 
could not be expected, that an account of live ftock would be made from 

every 



xciv 



Appendix. 



every parifli, but, in general, the returns are fufficientl; 
calculations on fafe data, (fuch as the rent of each), 
which no return of ftock has been made. The value i 
it is evident, muft vary, according to the price of the c 
rent counties. 

4. Agricultural Produce. — This is another moft im 
quiry, returns of which could not be expected from ev 
— There are three modes of eftirnating it. — 1. By cal 
according to the quantity of land fuppofed to be occup 
pofes, whether arable, pafture, &amp;c— 2. By multiplyin 
diftrict, according to the known proportions between 
produce, in any particular parifli whence a return 
3. By computing it according to the fuppofed confui 
tants, deducting any articles imported.— Calculations 
duce are particularly efiential, becaufe they will prove 
rior, in point of importance and extent, our Agriculi 
our commercial, a point hitherto little attended to, eitl 
on the continent. — Hence the abfurd attempt of Frai 
dom, by excluding its fliips from the ports of Europe 
commerce is of great importance, cannot be queftion( 
time, it is proper to obferve, that we draw as much rea 
ture in one year, as from commerce in five. 

5. Productions of Manufactures and Commerce.- 
bead it will be difficult to give any fatisfactory inforn 
fpects, the accounts muft necelfarily be defective, and 
ftinguilb thofe branches of commercial or manufactu 
are properly fpeaking dependent upon agriculture, froi 
commercial. The latter indeed, ought, ftrictly fpeaki 
articles, the raw materials of which are imported frotr 
which, when they are either manufactured here, or 
factured ftate, are again exported. — In this point of v

7. General County Statements.— It is propofed, in the laft plao 
"before the reader a general view of the irate of each County, cxhib 
one glance, a futnraary of thofe articles, with regard to which, a 
and public- fpirited Statefman, would be moft anxious to procure 1 
tion. 

It is impoflible to expect, that all thefe particulars, whether re 
parifhes or counties, can be given in fo very exact a ftate, as to ef 
remarks of little critics, though it is believed that they will be fuf 
correct, to anfwer every ufeful purpofc of inquiry ; and the foi 
being once laid, there can be no doubt, that by perfeverance, and fai 
veftigation, they may ultimately be brought to fuch a ftate of min 
fection, as may be judged neceflary by the public. 

III. GENERAL COMPUTATIONS. 

The great object of the Statiftical Inquiry, was to nccomplifh, w 
hitherto never been **ven attempted, namely, to af~ertain the 'ntern 
ture of Society. Various ingenious authors have perplexed themfe 
their readers, by puzzling ihemfelves about what thr.y termed the pre 
and unproductive clafles, without having ever analyfed the real ftate 
litical community. By the afliftance of the Cleigy of Scotland, I h« 
enabled to refolve a problem hitherto involved in myltcrv. The 
clades into which a fociety, containing about 1,550,000 fouls, is 
the modes by which they refpectivtly obtain their lubfiftence, 
means by which their condition may be improved, will be explainer 
degree of precifion hardly to be expected in a firft attempt. — Info 
of that fort, however, only becomes intercfting, in proportion to t 
on which it is given, and hence it feems more delirable, to referve al 
fions concerning the clafles of fociety, or the diltribution of a politii 
munity, for thofe general computations, which will be drawn m 
the general ftate of the kingdom is explained. At the (feme I 
this Work may fall into the hands of numbers, who may not have ai

A number of returns in detail, equally curious and important as that of 
Kincardine O'Niel, are dil'perfed through the Statiftical Volumes. — Thefe 
will furnilh fufficient data, on which the general ftate and itructure of fo- 
ciety, in the northern part of the ifland, may be afcertained. But they con- 
tain fuch a number of particulars, that few readers would have patience 
10 go through them, were they multiplied over a thoufand diftridls. 

I have thus laid before the reader, a general view, of fome, among many 
other important articles of information, which the Statiftical Account of 
Scotland affords, and which it would be in vain to fearch for in any former 
publication. — Poflefled of fuch a balls, on which to ground their feafoning, 
or their conduct, with what advantage will not future political authors ex- 
plain the principles of policy, and future ftatefmen direct the adminiftration 
of public affairs I May thefe labours have the effedl of rendering the rulers 
of nations wife, and thofe whom they govern happy ! May they be the 
means of promoting the interefts, not only of this, or of that community, 
but of the fpecies at large '. Aud may the doctrines thence to be inculca- 
ted, be from time to time improved, until the principles on which political 
fociety ought to be founded, will ultimately reach their utmoft ftandard of 
perfection. 

I fhall now proceed to give fome Tables of Abcrdeenfhire, by way of 
fpecimen how fuch a work ought to be drawn up.

It is here to be obferved, that though part of the parifhes of Cairny and 
Cabrach, lies in Banff-fhire, and part of the parifli of Drumoak, in the 
county of Kincardine, the whole population of each of thefe parifhes is 
fet down in the Table, from the difficulty of apportioning the number 
of inhabitants to each refpe&amp;ive county, therefore the real population of 
the county of Aberdeen is fomewhat lefs than above ftated. 

The increafe has almoft exclufively taken place in Aberdeen, Peterhead, 
Huntly, Fraferburgh, and the other towns, whilft it would appear, that the 
population of moft of the country parifhes has diminiflied. The number 



of inhabitants of the towns is about 17,833, viz.

The valuation or valued rent of the county of Aberdeen, column fixth, 
as entered in the records of the Court of Exchequer, is L. 235,665 : 8 11

• Column 7th. The real rent of the pariflies that have fe.nt returns being 
%a the proportion of L. 52, 10 s. Sterling to each L. 100 Scotch of va- 
lued rent ; the real rent of the other pariflies is therefore computed in the 
f2me proportion, and marked with an afterifk. The rent of the parifhes 
of Old Machar and Newhills, aiftricts particularly circumftanced, is re- 
turned at L. 13,500 Sterling. Proceeding on thefe principles, it appears, 
jhat the total land rent of the county., including that of the falmon-fifhings

This rent, considerable as it is, compared with the old valuation, it is ho- 
ped wiil fall far fliort of the fum which this extenfive and induftrious coun- 
ty will reach in a fliort period : and it is to be obferved, that in fome pa- 
riflies, the grain or victual-rent, has been ftated at the rate of only 10 s. the 
boll, a fum below the actual converfion. 

Column 8th. The total income of the Clergy in this county, converting 
the bear and barley, at 15s.; the oats and oatmeal, at. 11 s. ; and the .malt, 
at 17 s. 6 d. the boll; and computing moderately the (Upends of three pa- 
riflies that made no returns, amounts to L. 9173 : 8 : 5 ; which divided by 
S8, die number of Minifters, gives an average of L. 104, 5 s. to each Cler- 
gyman. In this is included the value of the glebes, amounting, on an ave- 
rage, to L. 6, 10 s. each; and the allowance for communion-elements, 
which varies from L. 1 : 6 : 8 to L. 10, and averages!.. 4, 12 s. 

The ecclefiaftical benefice of the parilh of Newhills, in this countv, is 
of a Angular defcription : George Davidlon of Pettans, a burgefs of Aber- 
deen, having, in 1663, mortified the lands of CapelhiUs, for the maintenance 
of the Minifter of that parifli. Thefe lands, confifting of 563 acres, of 
arable, pafture, and moor ground, having a privilege of mofs and pafturage, 
worth altogether at prefent L. 1.40 per annum, is poflefled by the Minifter 
of Newhills for the time being, and conftitutes the whole of his living, ex- 
cept an allowance of about L. 7 for communion-elements. 

Column 9th. The proportion of fcholnrs to the whole inhabitants of the 
pariflies that have 'made returns, being nearly ,as 1 to 30,. the number is

Column 10th. The total income of the parochial fchoolmafters of A- 
oerdeenfhire, (Old and New Aberdeen not included), computing each 
of the deficient parities at L. 14, amounts to L. 1224:2:9, or nearly 
L. 15 each. The emoluments of the parochial fchoolmafters arife from, ift, 
The legal falary, varying from L. 2, 10 s. to L. 12, average L. 6, 14. 2d, 
An allowance for acting as feflion- clerk and precentor, with fees for ma- 
king entries in, and extracts from, the parifh regifters and feffion recordi. 
And, 3elly, The fees for teaching, which are extremely moderate, being on- 
ly from i s. 6 d. to 2 s. a quarter, for each fcholai, taught Englifh and wri- 
ting; the average of the two laft is L. 8, 15 s. It cannot fail of being 
obferved, that their wliple emoluments amount to a fum too fmall to enable 
the fchoolmafters to livt with any degree of fatisfaction or comfort. 

Column 1 rth. The ''■number of poor in the country pariflies in Aber- 
deenfhire, is 2318 ; in New Aberdeen, 4S1 ; and in Old Aberdeen, 240 ; 
in all, 3039 : being in the proportion of about r in every 40 of the inhabi- 
tants. 

The total of column 12th, being the capital of the poor's funds, amounts, 
in the country pariflies, to L. 9866 15:6; and in Old Aberdeen, to 
L. 1265; making in all L. 11,131 : 5 : 6. 

Column 13th. The collections in 76 country pariflies, amounts to 
L. 128S, 13 s. ; and in Old Aberdeen, to L. 102, 12 s. : in all L. 1391, 5s.; 
and this fum docs not include the collections in New Aberdeen, and in the 
other country parifhes, which muft be in proportion. 

Column 14th. The total income of the poor in this county, is L. 3062, 
6 s. d. ; making an average of about L. r for each pauper, which is cer- 
tainly maintaining the poor at a very fmall expenee. The profits of the 
pall or mort-cloth are included in this column. 

Thefe additional remarks will fuffice ou the parochial Tables. 



COUNTY COMPUTATIONS. 

We fliall now proceed to the articles which it is propofed to confider, 
not by pariflies, but by counties. 

I. State of Property. 

A particular account was obtained of the ftatc of the property in this 
county, the number of proprietors, and the extent of property held by each ;

It ,s proper to remark, that the above fum of L. 133,630 is graft rent, from 
ivh.ch there are a variety of heavy deductions ; as, 1. The expence of collec- 
tion ; 2. The rilk of lofs from the infolvency of tenants ; 3. The ejpence of 
Jupporting the tenants in bad felons, when, inftead of receiving rent, it is

often nectffkiy to maintain the fmall farmers and their families ; 4. EccleE. 
aftical expences, not only the Minifters ftipend, and the fum allowed for 
communion-elements, but alfo the expence of building and keeping in re- 
pair the church and manfe, and the offices connected therewith^ whichj like 
all other public buildings, are twice as expenfive as any other ; 5. The fa- 
lary of the fchoolmafter, and the expence of repairing his houfe ; Iaftly, 
The land-tax, houfe, and window tax, and other impofitions of a public na- 
ture, as that for railing men, &amp;c. All thefe charges being deducted, it is 
probable that the real free rent to the proprietors, would not much exceed 
two-thirds of the grofs rent above mentioned, or L. 89,080; and the other 
one-third, or L. 44,550, may be the amount of the deductions. Both toge- 
ther make 3s. 8^d. of average rent, per Englifh acre, over the whole 
county.

Above L. 66,000 Scotch of valued rent, or property equal to L. 36,85:) 
in Sterling money of real rent, is fubject to the Uriel fetters of a Scotch 
entail. It is fuppofed, that about one half of the rents of the county be- 
long to perfons who do not refide in it, and are fpent in other parts of the 
kingdom. 

II. Mode of Occupation. 

"Without an actual furvey, it is evident that this can only be the fub- 
ject of rather loofe and general computation, the returns from the parifhes 
in general having been extremely imperfect. It is probable, however, from 



Appendix. e*£ 



the Deft calculations that it is poflible to make, on fubfe data as could be 
procured, that the following is pretty near the truth.

From this general view of the manner in which the lands in Aberdeen- 
fhire is employed, it will appear, what immenfe fcope there is for improve- 
ment. Perhaps, of the whole, the land that is planted, or under natural 
wood, together with, perhaps, one half of the in-field land, amounting 
to about 100,000 Scotch acres, or 120,000 Englifh, is all that has 
qearly reached its proper value or height of produce. When the land is 
thoroughly cultivated, in the manner which it is hoped will take place, 
what additional wealth, of the bell and moft permanent nature, may not be 
expected ? 

III. Live-Stock. 

The information refpedling this important particular is more minute than 
could have well been expected. There arc returns from 40 parifhes in the 
county, of the number of horfes, cattle, and flieep in each. Of thefe, there 
are four parifhes, namely, Birfe, Crathie, Glenmuick, and Strathdon, which - 
are particularly circumltanced, having more than the ufual proportion of livc- 
ftock; it is propofed therefore, in the following account, to keep them, di- 
Hindi, and afterwards to ftate the flock in the 36 other parifhes which have 
fent returns ; and then to eflimate the parifhes whence there are no return, 
in the fame proportion with thofe returned, according to their refpeclive 
valuations. The live-flock of the county of Aberdeen, on thefe principles, 
may be then flared in the following manner:

Of thefe, it is fuppofed, that 20,000 head of cattle, and 26,000 iheep, 
are annually fold out of the county, and it is well known, confiderable 
quantities of felted pork are exported. 

This table muft fatisfy every one of the great advantage that might be 
derived from the improvement of live-ftoek. Though there are confiderable 
numbers of valuable animals of the different forts above mentioned, yet the 
average price, young and old included, cannot with juftice be ftated at 
more than the fmall fums above mentioned. Whereas, by attending to the 
improvement of the different breeds, the fame pafture might feed animals 
of much fuperior value. 

IV. Agricultural Produce. 
We thall next proceed to give a general view of the profit derived from 
the cultivation of the foil, in the manner above fpecified, and from the ftock 
above enumerated,

This produce is in proportion to the land rent as five to one. Five rents 
is certainly a larger proportion than is ufually expedted by the tenant; but 
it is to be confidered, that a larger profit is eflential for a very fmall farmer, 
than for a large one ; and that a lefs proportion of the produce of arable land, 
can be paid from poor land, than from rich. Where farms are very fmall, as 
is too much the cafe in the northern parts of Scotland, namely, from L. 5 
to L. 10 per annum, in common years, 1 the farmer requires almolt the whole 
produce to maintain his family, and to defray the expences of cultivation. 
Even on a farm of L. 20 per annum, five rents will do little more. But 
when, in addition to the fmallnefs of the farm, the produce per acre is in- 
confiderable, which, from the preceding ftatement, there is every reafon to 
believe, it is not to be wondered at, that fo large a portion of the produce 
fliould be ncceffary for the occupier. 

Thefe calculations, however, furnifh, on the whole, no unpromifing pro- 
fpect, both to the proprietors of this county, and to the public. It would 
appear, that the produce of Aberdeenihire, is only at the rate of about 24 s. 
fer Scotch acre, or 19 s, per EngUlh acre ; which, however confiderable, 

compared 



Appendix, 



compared to what it yielded formerly, yet might foon be doubled, if not 
.tripled, by promoting ufefal improvements, and by converting the farms, to 
fuch a reafonable She, as would enable the farmers to live more comfort- 
ably themfelves, to pay better rents to their landlords, and to raife a greate; 
produce for the public. 



V. Produttions of Manufadures and Commerce. 

It does not feem necefl'ary, in the prefent (ketch, to enter with minutenefs 
into the commercial and manufacturing ftate of this county, as thofe are 
fnbjects which will be more fully confidered, when the general ftate of the 
kingdom at large, in regard to thofe two important particulars, is difcuffed; 
and, owing to various circumftances, I have not been able to colled the 
Trecefikry fads, for forming any exact eftimate. I calculate, however, on 
very general grounds, that both may produce about L. 200,000 per annum. 
The flocking manufacture alone, in the neighbourhood of Aberdeen, is fup- 
pofed to extend to L. 103,000 annually, for hofe or ftockings expoitsd ; a 
part of which, however, is manufactured in the fliire of Kincardine. 

VI. Mines, Fijl-eries, and Kelp. 

Thefe fources of wealth, being principally of a local nature, are on that 
account joined together, under one head. 

With regard to mines, little wealth of that defcription has hitherto been 
found in Aberdeenfhire. The moft valuable article arifes from the granite 
quarries in the vicinity of Aberdeen ; 12,000 tons of that durable ftone are 
annually exported to London, valued at 14 s. the ton, or L. 8400. 

There are millftone quarries in Aberdour parifh, rented at L. 40 ; the 
produce may be ftated at L. 400. Limeftone is found in fome parts of this 
county ; Glenbucket parilh contains inexhanftible ftores of that valuable 
mineral. About 55,000 bolls of lime arc annually burnt in Old Machar 
and Old Deer parifhes, and may be valued at L. 2750. A quarry of blue 
flate is wrought in Culfalmond parifh, though not to any extent ; and a vein 
of mangancfe in Old Macliar. The total produce of mines and minerals 
may be ftated at L. 11,600. 

The Dee and the Don, and the other rivers of AberJeenfhire, have long 
been celebrated for the excellence of the falmon they produce. The rent 
of thofe fifhings amount to about L. 24S0 per annum, .and the produce to 
L. 10,000. 

Confiderable fifheries are alfo carried on, on the fea coaft of Aberdcen- 
Gilnvand by Gibing vellels from the ports of that county, in particular from 

Peterhead 



Appendix. 



cxiii 



Peterhead and Fraferbnrgh. Some kelp is alfo made on the coaft ; the Ta- 
ke of thefe two laft articles may be Hated at L. 9000 ; there being about 
60 boats, &amp;c. employed, the produce of whofe induftry muft be confider- 
able *. 

Confequently, the whole produce of mines, fifheries, and kelp, will, on a 
moderate computation, be found to amount to L. 30,600. 

We lhall now proceed to give a general view of this interefting d 
ftricl.

CONCLUSION. 

There is nothing which can give an intelligent and contemplative mind, 
more real fatisfaction, than to fee the ftate of an intcrefting drflrict thus 
analyfed. It is only by means of fuch ftatements, that any idea can be 
formed, of the real circumftanccs of a country, and confcquently of the 
means of improving it. It certainly would be defirable, to have the infor- 
mation above Iketchcd out, afccrtained with minutenefs and accuracy, but 
that could not be expected, at the fiiil attempt of a private individual, car- 
ried on by his own perfonal exertions, and who principally relied on the zeal 
of thofe to whom he addrefied himfelf for information. It will fcareely be 
credited, in future times, that fuch an undertaking could be completed un. 
der fuch a difadvantage ; and thole fortunate individuals, by whofe in- 
ciuilry and public fpirit the Work wa accomplilhed, in addition to the fatis- 
faction which they rauft derive from their own minds, will have their me-' 
ir.ories juflly celebrated by their grateful pofterity.

It may be proper alfo to inform the reader, that the preceding Tables re- 
fpe&amp;ing the ftate of Aberdeenfhire, were rendered more perfect than could 
have been expected, from the deficiency in feveral of the original returns, 
in confequence of fome fpecial queries having been circulated for that pur. 
pofe, amongft the clergy of that county, in December 1796, to which 67 
anfwers were received; and from them the Tables of population, rent, Stc. 
were corrected. Some differences which will appear between the numbers 
in thole Tables and in the Statiftical volumes, may be attributed to the dif- 
ferent periods at which the calculations werp made. 



Since the above was written, it appears, from " A General View of the 
P State of Portugal," by James Murphy, printed in London, in one volume 
quarto, anno 1798, that inquiries, both of a Statiftical and Agricultural na- 
ture, have been carried on in that kingdom, in confequence of an inftitution 
entitled, The Royal Academy of Liibon. In particular, it would feem, that 
a number of premiums were offered and adjudged by that Academy, as far 
back as the year 17S3, for phyficaland economical defcriptionsof any difti! " L 
or confiderable territory, either in Portugal or its tranfmarine dominions * ; 
and that a number of queries were circulated amongft the farmers, in 1787, 
on this judicious principle, that no fyftem for the improvement of the coun- 
try could with fafety be adopted, without a previous examination into the ac- 
tual ftate of the nation, in regard to population, induftry, natural produc- 
tions, commerce, public revenue, and national expenditure f . 

It is not ftated how far this plan has fucceeded, though it has been 
carried on for feveral years ; but it would appear, that no expence was 
1 pared to accomplifli it, and that it leceived the full fupport and protection 
of Government. It is the more creditable therefore for this country, that 
fuch inquiries have been carried on fo fuccefsfully, by the exertions of indi- 
viduals.

(County of Linlithgow, Synod of Lothian and

By James Gray.</head> 



<p>Situation. 

THE parilh of Livingftone, which was a parfonage be- 
longing to the abbey of Holyroodhoufe, is fituated 
within the county and prefbytery of Linlithgow, and fynod 
of Lothian and Tweeddale. . It is bounded on the eaft by 
the pariflies of Uphall and Mid-Calder ; on the fouth by the 
parilhes of Mid and Weft C alder, or by the waters of Al- 
^ol. XX. A mend"

mond and Rfeich ; on the weft by the parifh of Whitburn, 
which was formerly a part of the parifh of Livingftone, but 
disjoined and erected into a feparate parifh about the year 
1730; and on the north by the parilhes of Bathgate and 
Uphall. 

Extent. — The figure of the parifh has fome refemblance 
to that of a fand-glafs, being betwixt 4 and 5 miles in length 
from eaft to weft, about a mile and a half in breadth at each 
end, and interfered in the middle to about half a mile. It 
contains near 4000 acres, all arable, and inclofed to a mere 
trifle. 

Soil. — The foil is various, but in general inclined to clay, 
and in many places the bottom is tilly, which occafions a 
wetnefs difficult to remedy. This defect, however, is in 
fome meafure atoned for, by various ftrata of lime, coal, 
i'ron-ftone, free-ftone, &amp;c. — And notwithstanding the damp- 
nefs, the air is certainly falubrioiis, as there are no difeafes 
which are peculiar to this fpot ; on the contrary, rl has exhi- 
bited many itittances of extreme longevity. 

Proprietors. — The property of this parifh is divided 
amongft 5 heritors, viz. Sir William Auguftus Cunyng- 
hame of Livingftone, the patron, George Moncrieff, Efq; of 
Elackburn, John Hamilton, Efq; of Pencaitland, Thomas 
Shairp, Efq; of Houftoun, and William Honyman, Efq; of 
Graemfay, now Lord Armadale, one of tire Senators of the 
College of Juftice.— Sir William is proprietor of about two- 
thirds of the parifh, and he and Mr Moncrieff are the only 
refiding heritors. — The valued rent is fomething above 
L. 3000 Scotch ; and the real rent, by recent and expcnfive 
improvements, is near L, 3000 Sterling. 



Population. 



of Livingjlone, 



Population. — In 1755 the population of this parifti is fta- 
ted at 598; about 25 years ago it was conliderably dimi- 
niihed by the difmiflion of a number of fmall tenants, and 
letting their pofleffions in larger farms to others ; but this 
lot was in feme degree compenfated, by an acquisition of 
indudry and fpirit for improvement, and the population is 
again upon the increafe. At the period laft above men- 
tioned, the inhabitants of the parifh, including all ages, were 
reduced to about 300, at prefentthey are conliderably above 
40c. The following table of baptifms and burials, for a pe- 
riod of 7 years, prior to the 1794, affords a comfortable 
proof of this fad!:.

Villages. — There are two villages in this parifh, one, the 
Kirktown of Livingftone, containing about 40 inhabitants ; 
and the other, lately built upon the eftate of Blackburn, 
upon feus from Mr Moncrieff, and which contains near 200 
people. But there are no manufactures of any kind carrieql 
on in either, excepting that a water-mill, to drive machinery 
for carding and fpinning cotton, has lately been erected at 
the latter village, which, it is to be hoped, will be of ufe, 
by employing at leaf! a part of the inhabitants. 



Ecclejtaftical 



4 Statijlical Account 



Ecclejia/lical State. — The ftate of religion in this pari fit 
is perhaps alfo improving, for here there are very few fece- 
ders, and thofe, it is believed, are moftly confined to perfons 
in fedentary occupations. People in this fituation, having the 
opportunity of uninterrupted converfation, naturally acquire 
a tafle for polemical difquifition, and, in proportion as they 
are bewildered, they become conceited and tenacious. 

Charailer of the People. — After what has been faid, it is 
almoft unneceflary to add, that the morals of the inhabi- 
tants of this pariih are in general correct. They have np 
vices that are peculiar to themfelves ; though, upon occa- 
lions, they refufc not to partake of a cheerful glafs, they are 
by no means addicted to drunkennefs. As the public road 
from Glafgow to Edinburgh panes through the pariih, and. 
upon which there is one inn and fcveral tippling houfes, , 
drunkennefs may fometimes be pra&amp;ifed in the parifh, but: 
not by its inhabitants. 

The degrading fervility of the feudal fyftem Li here to- 
tally eradicated \ they approach their fuperiors with abun- 
dance of difcretion, but without cringing; for a good deedi 
they are not aihamed to be grateful to their inferiors ; andi 
they would forgive an injury from a beggar, which they, 
would refent from a peer. 

Church, ifc. — The church and manfe of Livingftone are: 
delightfully fituated, (for the clergy had always fome taftc 
even for an earthly paradife), upon a dry'mouht, half en- 
circled by the water of Almond : They are both mcde 
and neat. 

The ftipend confifls of 16 bolls of barley, 32 bolls o? 
meal, and L. 1060 Scotch in money ; which, converting th 
meal and barley at 16 s. per boll, amounts to L. 126: 14 : 5 
Sterling, excluftve of the manfe and glebe ; fo that the H: 



of Livingjloye. 



ving may be reckoned worth Jl,. 150 Sterling a-year, which, 
conlidering the extent of the parilh, the fmall number of ijs 
inhabitant?, and their moderate principles, it is certainly 
an eligible cure. 

The character of the prefent incumbent has no doubt had 
its influence in forming that of the people ; he is a man 
equally remarkable for his worth and for his misfortunes •, af- 
ter having loft his wife, he has alfo been deprived of 5 out of 
6 children, who had either arrived at, or near, the age of 
majority ; and he has borne thefe afflictions with that decent 
magnanimity, which nothing but the true fpirit of Chrifti- 
ani'ty can infpire. 

School. — The fchoolmafter's falary, independent of his 
houfe, fchool, and other perquifkes, is betwixt L. 9 or L. 10 
Sterling ; 15 merks of which arifes from an old mortifica- 
tion ; in the remainder the heritors have voluntarily anefTed 
themfelves; and for one hajf of which, by aft of Parliament, 
they are entitled to relief againft their tenants ; but this re- 
lief has wifely and humanely never been demanded. The 
fituation of the place is well adapted for a public fchool ; 
and it k to be regretted, that one half of the learning pof- 
feffed by the prefent fchoolmafter is rather more than he 
has occafion for. The number pf children who attend this 
fchool is from 20 to 30 ; and from 30 to 40 are taught in 
another private fchool kept in the village of Blackbnrn. 

Poor — The poor are fupported from the collections at 
the church-doors, and the fees upon marriages, baptifms, 
and burials, and the interefls of an excrefcent capital, which, 
in better times, had arifen from thefe, and amounted to 
about L. 10 a-year, which at prefent is divided amongft five 
perfons. 



Agriculture, 



6 



Statiftical Account 



Agriculture. — The face of this parifh has been entirely 
changed within tliefe 25 years ; and much praile is due to 
Sir William Cunynghame and Mr Moncrieff, the two rt-fi- 
ding heritors, for the great expence and unwearied applica- 
tion they have beftowed upon improvements ; tor, " he who 
" makes two blades of grafs to grow where only one grew 
" before, has more merit than the whole race of politici- 
*' ans put together." Not long prior to the period juft now 
mentioned, it was not uncommon to fee 4 horfes and 4 oxen 
dragging and ftaggering before a large heavy plough, with 
a very fmall furrow, at the rate of about a mile in an hour; 
whilft the gadman or driver, the only active being of the 
cavalcade, was obliged to traverfe at leaft three miles for 
their one, in fruitlefs endeavours to prevent them from fall- 
ing afleep. Now we fee no plough drawn by more than 
1 horfes, without a driver, and carrying with them a fur- 
row of twice the weight, and going, with apparent eafe, 
three times falter ; while, at the fame time, thefe horfes are 
of a better breed, in better order, and maintained at lefs 
expence. 

This, and feveral other improvements in agriculture 
equally important, tho' formerly not altogether unknown, 
were principally introduced into this parifli by a very intel- 
ligent and thorough-bred farmer, brought from Northum- 
berland by Sir William Cunynghame, in the quality of his 
overfeer ; but it was not in this ftation that he acquired ei- 
ther celebrity or imitators. 

In that character, every deviation he made from the com- 
mon practice was looked upon as a wild experiment, which 
none but a man of fortune could rilk. It was not till he be- 
came a farmer on his own account, and had a rent to pay 
like his neighbours, and continuing the fame practice, which 
being uniformly crowned with fuccefs, that prejudice gave 
' . • way

way to demonffration, and thefe practices became as tini- 
verfally copied as they had formerly been ridiculed. 

As the improved practice of hufbandry, however, is now 
fo generally known over Scotland, it would be unneceflary 
here to enter into particulars ; there is only one other which 
we ftiall beg leave to mention, becaufe it is of the utmoft 
importance, and feems to be little attended to by farmers 2 
This is the mode of increafing the quantity of manure upon 
a farm, as pra£tifed by the perfon alluded to, limply, by 
making the ftable-yard or fite of the dunghill much deeper 
than ordinary, preventing, as much as poffible, any drain 
from it, and beginning the dunghill every year by laying in 
3 or 4 feet deep of the bed earth which can be procured 
upon the farm, from the banks of rivulets, or other places, 
where it is either totally ufelefs, or lies thicker than necef- 
fary •, then fpreading the dung regularly, as it is made, over 
this earth, and at the fame time allowing the drains from 
the kitchen, llables, byres, and feeding fhades, to run into 
it. Having lain through the feafon in this fituation, the 
earth at the bottom, from having abforbed all thefe juices, 
will be found very little inferior in quality to the dung 
above it. 

In addition to this, it is well worth the farmer's while, 
where he has the command of Kme, and fuch earth as has 
been mentioned, to employ his people as much as poffible 
in making compofts of thefe materials, for a top drefling to 
his grafs lands. 

It is unneceffary to inculcate the utility of draining wet 
lands ; befides the ordinary kind of drains, form? others have 
been ufed here, which, we believe, are not generally known 
ip this country. 

The annexed plate exhibits tranfverfe feaions of 3 drains, 
which may be underftood without much- further explana- 
tion,

Fig. i. — From experience we cannot recommend this 
drain, efpecially where the land has to undergo the opera- 
tion of the plough •, for it wa9 found that the feet of the 
cattle went down and deranged the billets which iupported 
the brulhwood, and the drain foon became rather worfe than 
ufelefs. 

Fig. 2. Is by much a better drain, but far from being un- 
exceptionable. It is made by means of 2 fpades, eadi about 
9 or io inches deep in the mouth, and floping in the fide8 
fo as to fuit the figure. The circular cavity at the bottom 
is excavated by an inftrument fimilar to a how, with a fe- 
micircnlar mouth. This drain is adapted to a lawn where 
heavy cattle are debarred. By the turf being replaced, it 
is fcarcely, and but for a fhort while, perceptible at all ; 
while the brulhwood, being fupported by the moulder above 
|the circular cavity, allows the water to filter, freely from the 
top and fides ; but in a fhort time the brufhwood muft rot, 
and the whole contents fall down. 

Fig. 3. Is liable to none of thefe objections, and is at the 
1 fame time by far the cheapeft ; it f anilines its own mate-

rials, and a good workman may execute 200 yards of it in 
a day. It can be done no where to purpofe but upon grafs 
lands, where the fod has acquired a confiderable degree of I 
cohefion by the roots of the grafs. The fame kind of fpades 
which dug the laft drain will dig this. The firft fpade takes 
out the fod to any length alongft the drain the operator 
thinks convenient ; that is laid to one fide, and the fecond 
fpade takes out the remainder of the earth, which is laid to 
the other fide ; he then pairs with a knife the fides of the 
fod, fo as when replaced, in an inverted pofition, and pref- 
fed down with the foot, the furface may reach till within 3 or 
4 inches of the bottom of the drain ; the earth is then filled 
in, and fown with grafs-feeds. It muft be attended to, -that the 
fods ought not to be replaced in the drain too clofe together, 
to prevent the water from the fides and the top from getting 
down. 

The fods are here in the fituation of the key-ftones of an 
arch i the more perpendicular prelTure they receive they b.ew 
come the firmer. In fliort, taking all circumftai.ces toge- 
ther, this is the beft fpecies of drain we have ever feen or 
heard of. It was lately imported by Sir William Cunyng--| 
hame himfelf from Richmond Park, Surry, to Livingftone, , 
and we do not know that it has been executed any where 

elfe in Scotland. 

A fourth fpecies of drain, or rather aqueduft, and evem 
{till more fimple than the laft, has been tried here with fusj 
cefs. A ditch was made at the neceffary depth, narrow at 
the bottom, in which was laid a fmooth tree or cylindricallj 
piece of wood, about 20 feet long, 6 inches diameter at the- 
one end, and 5 at the other, having a ring in the thickefti 
end, to which a rope was fattened; after ftrewing a littlei 
fand upon the furface of the tree, the clayey or tilley con-, 
tents of the ditch were firft thrown in, and then the re- 
mainder, and trod firmly down ; then, by means of the | 
rope, the tree was drawn out till within a foot or two of 

r ' the HI 



of Livingjlone.

the' fmall end, and the fame operation repeated. This clay 
pipe has conduced a fmall rill of water a confiderable way 
under ground, for more than 20 years, without any lign of 
failing. 

This fuggefts what would be a great difcovery, were it 
pra&amp;icable, viz. the leading of water into a city, &amp;c. by 
means of a pipe made of lime-mortar. It is an eftablilhed 
fa£l, that lime-mortar, when immerfed in water, acquires a 
greater degree of hardnefs and cohefion than when expofed 
to the air *. There appears to be no difficulty in furnifh- 
ing a pipe of this kind with both air and cleanging cocks ; 
but it does not fo readily occur how a fraclure might be 
repaired. 

Before concluding this fubjec~t, we cannot help communi- 
cating to the public a hint, which, if well founded, merits 
their attention. It is but too well known, that (he-ep who 
have been breed in a moorifh country, and fed chiefly upon 
heath, when brought to a low country, and fed upon a rich 
patture, are liable to die of a difeafe called the rot, a fpecies 
of dropfy. 

It is faid that the diuretic quality of parfley, of which 
flieep are fond, prevents this difeafe. When a field, there- 
fore, intended for fheep-pafture, is laid down, 3 or 3 pounds 
to an acre of this feed, added to the other common grafs- 
feeds, would be no hazardous experiment ; no feed can be 
more eafily procured. Hares are alio faid to be fond of 
parfley, if fo, this kind of flock, which affords both food and 
diverfion, maybe thus brought to hand without much trouble 
or expence. 

Antiquities.— On this head we beg of our readers, and 
the patron of this work, a little indulgence.

Statijlkal Account 



As to the derivation of the vr or 6\ , Livingftone, we will 
Rot even offer a conje&amp;ure. It is certain that Livingftone 
Was for a confiderable time the chief feat of a family of that 
name, from whom were defcended the Earls of Linlithgow 
and Callander, &amp;c. ; and it is probable, becaufe it was moll 
common, that the family took, their name from the place, 
and not the place from them. 

The houfe of Livingftone was a fortified caflle, furround- 
ed by a wet ditch about 30 feet wide, and a rampart of 
earth within the ditch ; more than three-fourths of this ditch 
and rampart remained entire till within thefe 45 years, 
In old writings it is called the Peel of Livingftone, a name 
denoting this infular fituation. 

It is faid that the firft of this family was ennobled by the 
title of Lord Livingftone, in the minority of James II. But 
this is a miftake ; for either that firft Lord Livingftone was 
not the reprefentative of this family of Livingftone, or be- 
came at that time only what was called a lord of Parlia- 
ment *, which did not imply the rank of nobility. Very 

few 

* About this period the fmaller vaftkls of the crown, below a certain year-" 
Jy rent, had obtained a difpenlation from perfonal attendance upon Parliament, 
on condition of their electing, out of their own body, fo many comrxiiffioners 
from each county to reprefem thern, whofe expences they paid. 

At the commencement of each Parliament thefe fmaller vafTals were fum 
moned, by a general writ, to elect their commiffioners, whilft the greater pro 
prietors, who were not entitled to that exemption, either got each a particu- 
lar fummons, or attended fpontaneoufly in virtue of their freeholds ; hence 
thefe latter acquired the appellation qf Lords of Parliament, to diltinguifli 
them from the former. Anciently, the word Dominus, or Lord, figniried no 
more than mailer, governor, or proprietor. At this day we call the mailer of 
a houfe Landlord, the proprietor of a great eflate Lord of He Manor ; and, 
Jn Scotland, the proprietor of any ellate Laird, which is merely a corruption 
pf the word Lord. 

From the confufion which has arifen by not attending to this diltinction, it 
js probable that the original patents of creation of fome of our moll ancient 
cpble families may be fought for in vain. 



of Livingjtone. 13 

: cw or no inftances had then occurred where perfonal ho- 
lours had been bellowed; they were either annexed to lands 
3 r to offices, and were transferred with the property, or be- 
came extin5t with the office. And the barony of Living- 
lone not only never was erefted into a lordlhip, but we 
ire pofleffed of an authentic deed, to which the proprietor 
of that barony was a party, dated in the i486, 26 years af- 
ter the death of James IT. where he is limply deligned " Go- 
" vane de Livlngjlone of that Ilk." 

About the beginning of the 16th century this eftate be- 
came the property of a family of the name of Hamilton. 
In the 1604 it was again acquired by the family of Linlith- 
gow. In the 1633 it was transferred to that of Murray, a 
branch of the Elibank family ; and in the 1704 it came into 
the pofleffion of the prefent proprietors. From the Hur- 
rays a fmall rivulet, which runs paft the houfe of Livingftone, 
received the name of the Eliburn, which it ftill retains. 

About half a mile north-eaft of the houfe of Livingftone 
flands thefarm-houfe of New- year-field ; partofafquare tower 
remained here till within thefe few years. Tradition fays 
that this was a royal hunting-feat, frequented by the kings

As it is probable, however, that the King and his patients

jfilent as to the cures that were performed. 

But there are relicks of antiquities in, or connected with, 

this parilh, of a different nature from thofe which have been 

mentioned. 

Stirling, where the river Forth becomes firft fordable, 
is the grand pafs betwixt the fouth and north diftrifts 
of Scotland, and therefore a pafs which was always keenly

difputed by contending armies. There are three rivers on 
each fide of this pafe, which, as they intercept the roads 
leading to it, the paflage of thefe alfo have, at various times, 
been contended ; on the north, the rivers Tay, Earn, 
and Allan; and, on the fouth, the Almond, the Avon, and 
the Carron ; each of thefe rivers have at different times 
been tinged with blood. 

The flat banks of the Almond, near Kirklifton and Li- 
vingftone, and the relative fituation of thefe two places, 
point them out as the moll likely for an army to attempt 
a paflage, in their way to or from Stirling. The firft is in 
the direct line betwixt Stirling and Edinburgh, or the eaft 
of Scotland, and England ; and the latter from the fouth of 
Scotland, through that remarkable gap in Pentland hills 
called the Caldftain Slap, towards Stirling. No hiftorianJ 
fo far as we know, has mentioned any battles having been 
fought at either of thefe places ; but two large detached 
ftones, (landing erect, one near Kirklifton-bridge, and the 
other near the New Bridge, at no great diftance from the 
former, evidently point out that bloody contentions h 
been here maintained; and if our hiflorians are in gener 
very inexplicit, their information is alfo often either evi 
dently erroneous, or very fufpicious. They tell us, that, to- 
wards the clofe of the xoth century, a battle was fought att 
Cramond, (the mouth of the water of Almond), betwixt 
Malcolm II. and Conftantine the Ufurper, and that, durin, 
the conflict, oneof the armies were much incommoded by the 
fand of the fea being blown in their faces by a violent wind. 
This {lory is at leaf! highly improbable. In the firft places 
The fteep banks of this river at Cramond precludes every 
idea of an army attempting a paflage here, in the face oi 
an enemy ; it was probably chofen as a Roman ftation, ow 
account of its fecurity from fuch an attack : and, fecondly

appeal to common obfervation, if, in fuch a fituation, fands 
ever acquire, in the interval of the tides, fuch a ftate of 
drynefs as to admit of being blown by the winds. 

We ftiall affign two reafons for conjecturing that this 
battle was fought further up the river, and at, or near, the 
New Bridge. Firft, From the name of the village at the 
imouth of this river ; it retains to this day, for a confiderable 
way up, the name of the Water of Cramond, which may of 
itfelf account for the miftake; but, fecondly, If there was 
really any blowing of fand, it was more likely to happen 
iat the place we have mentioned than at Cramond •, for here, 
! notwithstanding the long culture the foil has received, it is 
iftill extremely fandy and loofe, and, 800 years ago, it was 
;probably a mere barren fandy plain. 

At the paffage of the Almond, near Livingftone, vefti- 
ges have lately been difcovered, which Ihew, with ftill 
greater certainty, that this alfo has been the theatre of war. 
On the fouth bank of that river, immediately oppofite to 
Livingftone houfe, there are 4 pretty large irregular mounts, 
iwhich, till of late, were not fuppofed to be artificial-, upon 
: minute infpedtion, however, they appear to be fo, from the 
I ftill viable excavations of the earth near them, out of which 
they have been formed, the confufion of the materials of 
which they are compofed, and that a great number of ftone- 
coffins have been difcovered near the furface of two of 
them, fome of thefe containing the viable remains of hu- 
man Skeletons, which, upon being expofed to the air, crum- 
bled into duft. Thefe coffins were formed of rouo-h flaa. 
ftones, had no top or covering of {tone, and were in gene- 
ral not more than 5 feet long. Several other coffins, of the 
fame kind and dimenfions, have been dug up in this neigh- 
bourhood, but no where in fuch numbers as here. By the 
country people they are uniformly afcribed to the Fids ; 
and hence a vulgar tradition, that thefe people were of a

very diminutive ftature. They do not cQnfider, that a 
who is flain in the field of battle, and not ftretched, whe 
warm, to his full length, muft necefiarily occupy a ihorte 
grave than one of an equal Itature on whom this opcratio 
has been performed. 

We do not pretend to fay when, or by whom, this battl 
was fought, which was the occafion of railing thefe tumuli 
for the burial of their dead, and as monuments of the even 
Tradition fays, that, towards the end of the PictiQi king 
dom, a battle was fought betwixt the Picts and Scots ne 
Bathgate, not far from the fpot ; it is probable this battl 
happened about the fame time, and betwixt the fame par 
ties ; that it was decifive in favours of the Scots, and there 
fore that thefe coffins belonged to the Scots, and not to th 
Picts. About this period the Scots were uniformly victo- 
rious againft the Picls. The conquered army, being beaten 
off the field, had no opportunity of burying their dead ; and 
the victorious army never did it in this manner, unlefs th 
victory was fo complete, that they thought it entitled, an 
they had fufficient time, to erect fuch laborious monu 
ments. 

A conjecture arifes, that the principal carnage of the 
vanquilhed army having taken place upon a riling ground 
upon the other fide of the river, immediately oppofite to 
thefe tumuli, and the bodies being there left to corrupt in 
the open, air, that field may have acquired the name of th 
Maukes Hill, which it ftill retains. 

We have already gone out of the parilh, but merely for 
the purpofe of elucidating what we thought was connected, 
with its hiftory. We are now about to dive into the cen- 
tre of the neighbouring parilh of Mid-Calder, without ha-

portunity of feeing, we are no ftrangers to his abilities. 

The mound of earth near the foot of the town of Mid- 
Calder, now called the Cunnigar, and upon which, it is 

i faid, many of the poor unhappy people called the witches 
of Calder were burnt ; from its peculiar fituation, perfect 
fymmetry, and excavation of the earth on the fouth-wefr, 

I fide, now almoft imperceptible, it is unqueflionably artifi-

ed for the purpofe of holding provincial meetings of the 

| Bards and Druids, who held all their meetings, civil or re- 
ligious, in the open air, and upon mounds of earth natural 
or artificial. This conjecture, if not proved, is at leaft 

; ftrongly fortified, when we are informed, that, in the Celtic 

i language, the word Cadair fignifies a meeting of this kind *; 
the word Calder, the name of this place and parifh, is but a 
fmall deviation from the othtr, and is certainly derived 
from it. 

The fame authority informs us, that the perion who offi- 
ciated as crier or reciter at thefe provincial affernblies was 
called the Dadgeiniad, hence perhaps Dadridge, the name 
: of a place in the near neighbourhood, which might have

were heathens ; but we are not told that they ever defiled

<p>Name, arid Extent, &amp;c. 

THE parilh of Bolelkine, fo termed from a farm conti- 
guous to the Fall of Foyers, meaning Bail-o's-cionn 
in Gaelic, or the town hanging above the loch, was many 
years ago united with the parifli of Abertarf, fituated in 
the neighbourhood of Fort-Auguftus, and fo denominated 
from the confluence of two rivers, Tarf and Oich, which, 
difcharging themfelves into Lochnefs, forms the ground on 
which the garrifon now (lands to a beautiful peni'nfula. 
The date of this union, nor the particular lands compofing 
each of thefe parifhes, cannot be traced. The united parifh 



20 



Stati/lical Account 



is at leaft 24 miles in length, and in moft parts from ic to 
12 miles in breadth. — It formerly contained two glebes, 
one near Fort-Auguftus, and the other at Bolefldne ; and 
the latter place, though the north-eaft boundary of the pa- 
rifh, contained till lately the church and manfe. But this- 
having been found inconvenient, and the idea of religious 
pennance exploded, they were, about 30 years ago, remo- 
ved to a more centrical lituation at Drimtemple, probably 
deriving its name from having been anciently a place of 
worfhip ; Brim fignifying a ridge or height, and Teample 
what it bears in the Englilh language. At this time 
both the old glebes were annexed to the eftate of Lovat,. 
then under the management of the Commiffioners of forfeit- 
ed eftates, and an equivalent given to the minifter contigu- 
ous to the new church. This meafure relieved the clergy-" 
man from preaching in two different places of Stratherrick, 
as, when the church remained at Bolefldne, he was in ufe 
every fecond Sabbath, of performing worftup at a place 
called Bellaloin, about one mile diftant from Drimtemple. 

Ancient Hijlory. — The whole of this united parifti was,, 
previous to the 15th century, the property of the Lovat fa- 
mily ; but who previoufly pofleffed it can only be learned- 
from tradition. What leads to a belief that Abertarf was 
inhabited by the Cummins, a very powerful and warlike 
clan, is, that the place of Fort-Auguftus, only called fo from- 
the eftablifhment of the garrifon, is in the vulgar language 
called Kilichuiman, meaning the burial-ground of the Cum- 
mins. And an eminence on the hill to the eaft of Loch- 
tarf is called Sui-Chuiman, or Cummin's rejiing -place. 

Stratherrick, compofing the other part of this parifli, fo- 
called from the river Errick, rifing in the mountains of 
Strathdearn, and entering Lochnefs at Bolejhine, Strath fig- 

nifyinJ 



of Bokjkine and Abertarf. it 

iiifying a valley or plain betwixt two hills, was anciently 
)offeffed by the clan Grant ; whether they quitted it voiun- 
arily or otherwife, is immaterial as well as uncertain ; but 
t would appear they went from thence to Strathfpey, and 
jailed the names of their new poffeffions after thofe they inha- 
bited in Stratherrick. Thus we ftill find the names of Del- 
dapple, Garthbeg,and Garthmore,&amp;c.in both thefe coun- 
tries. Before the year 1545 the united parilb feems to have 
been occupied by the tribes called Macgruers, Macmemeirs, 
and Maftavifhes, then followers of the Lovat family, but the 
principal perfons of all thefe tribes having accompanied the 
Lord Lovat in his expedition to fettle the heir of the Clan- 
ronald family in his father's eftate, were almoft cut oft' in a 
bloody battle fought that year at the eaft end of Lochlochy, 
by the Clan Macdonald, who intercepted Lovat and his at- 
tendants in their return from the Hebrides ; this battle, call- 
ed Blar-kin, from the warriors on both fides having (trip- 
ped and fought in their fhirts, is recorded in the following 
piaurefque lines of Buchanan's hiftory of Scotland : " Fra- 
" ferii pauciores a pluribus victi, atque ad unum cccfi. Ita 
t* gens numerofiflima et ftepe de re Scotica bene merita 
" tota interierat, nifi divino (ut credi par eft) confiho, e: 
" familias principibus octoginta domi reliquiffent gravidas 
" uxores, quae fuo quoeque tempore mares peperunt lingulos, 
" qui omnes incolumes ad virilem pervenerunt sctatem." 
A few years before this period, a fon of Lovat had fettled 
at Foyers, and at fame time acquired the property of the 
lands of Aberchalder in Abertarf. And the lineal defcend- 
ant of another of Lovat's lon3 fettled at Farraline, fituated 
by a lake of that name in Stratherrick. — At the above con- 
Hie! Farraline was llain, and Foyers fo dangeroufly wound- 
ed, that he was carried from the field of battle by one Nor- 
man Gow, on his back, to the top of Suichuimain, about 

eight 



12 



Statijiical Account 



eight miles from Lochlochy ; but Gow having an arrow in 
his fide all the time, found himfelf unable to proceed far- 
ther, and there pulled out the arrow and expired. His de- 
fendants, in commemoration of this amazing effort of at- 
tachment, enjoyed a croft of land, rent free, from the family 
of Foyers till within thefe fixty years. Mr Frafer of Foyers 
having recovered from his wounds, was enabled, with the 
afliftance of the few c ommoners who had not accompanied 
their chief on this fatal occafion, to protecf the country from 
the inroads of the rival clan, who were much enfeebled by 
the effects of this fevere conflict. 

The numef ous offspring deicended of the Frafers killed 
in that battle, grew up, in procefs of time, to obliterate the 
depopulation thereby occafioned j and to corroborate the 
evidence refulting from the above paffage in Buchanan, 
it is a notorious facf, that the whole principal gentlemen 
now relident in Stratherrick do, (with a few exceptions), 
trace their defcent either from Mr Frafer of Foyers, or Far- 
raline above mentioned ; hence the country of Stratherrick 
for many years confided principally of two tribes, the one 
called Mac-mhic-ulliams, or Foyer's tribe ; and the other 
Sliochd-ion-mhic-aliftcr, or Farraline's tribe : and from the 
1545, till the forfeiture of the Lovat eflate in the 1746, the 
flate of the Highlands requiring much the attachment of 
vallate and tenants to their chief, Stratherrick was more 
confidered as a nurfery of men, than as yielding much pe- 
cuniary emolument to the Lovat family. Some of them 
received feu-rights of certain parts of the country, and all 
the younger fons, pofTefTed of any funds, obtained proper 
wadfets of their refpecf ive pofTeffions ; and in the general 
valuation of the county for afcertaining the land-tax, in the 
1 691, every wadfetter is rated in the fame manner with the 
heritors. 

In 



of Bolejkine and Abertarf. 23 



In all contefts betwixt the Lovat family, their neigh* 
bours, and others,, the Stratherrick tribes were ready upon 
the firft fummons to efpoufe the caufe of their chief; and as 
every tribe arranged itfelf under its particular leader, the 
county of Stratherrick exhibited a fpecies of military fu- 
bordination. If any difpute happened among individuals 
in the country, it was generally terminated by the ftrong- 
hand, or the baron-baillie placed there by the Lovat fami- 
ly, who was veiled with the extravagant jurifdiction of the 
times. As the wadfetters had the lands on very moderate 
conditions, the principal rent demanded by them from their 
fub-tenants and cottars was military attendance, and their 
(aid and affiftance in fuch agricultural and rural fervices as 
■was neceffary for the wadfetter's accommodation. 

Till the beginning of this century, the whole heritors and 
i wadfetters in this parifh, lived in houfes, compofed of cup- 
pie trees, and the walls and thatch made up of fod and di- 
Ivot ; but in every wadfetter's houfe, there was a fpacious hall, 
containing a large table, where he and his family and de^ 
pendants cat their two meals a-day, with this {ingle diftinc- 
i.ion, that he and his family fat at the one end of the table, 
and his dependants at the other; and it was reckoned no 
Idifparagement for the gentlemen to fit with commoners in 
the inns, fuch as the country then afforded, where one cap, 
and afterwards a fingle glafs, went round the whole com- 
Ipany. As the inhabitants experienced no want, and gene- 
rally lived on the produce of their farms, they were hofpi- 
talile to ftrangers, providing they did not attempt a fettle- 
ment among them. But it was thought then difgraceful for 
any of the younger fans of thefe wadfetters, to follow any 
other profeffion than that of arms and agriculture ; and it is 
in the remembrance of many now living, when the meaneft 
tenant, would think it difparaging, to fit at the fame table 
With a manufafturer. In progrefs of time, however, thefe 

prejudices 



2 4 



Statiflical Account 



prejudices gave way to ideas, more fuitable to an improved 
fiatc of fociety. — This country is naturally divided by ri- 
vers, hills, and moors, into a variety of fe&amp;ions, and each of 
thefe admitting of fome agricultural cultivation, have been 
computed by the inhabitants into davochs, half davochs, or" 
plough-lands, being the fourth part of a davoch, according 
to their extent-, each half davoch-land was again fubdivided 
into eight parts, commonly called aughten-parts, and agree- 
able to the regularity and order which the Author of Na- 
ture has obferved in all his operations. The whole coun- 
try, with two exceptions, confifts of a variety of half davoch- 
lands, each of which was let or difponed by the Lovat fa- 
mily or their chamberlain to a wadfetter or principal tackf- 
man, and had no concern with the fub-tenantry ; each fub- 
tenant had again a variety of cottars, equally unconnected 
with the principal tacksman •, and each of thefe had a num- 
ber of cattle of all denominations, proportional to their re- 
fpeftive holdings, with the produce whereof he fed and 
clad himfelf and whole family. As there were extenlivc 
fheallings or grafings attached to this country, in the neigh- 
bourhood of the lordfhip of Badenoch, the inhabitants in the 
beginning of fummer removed to thefe fheallings with their 
whole cattle, man, woman, and child ; and it was no un-j 
common thing, to obferve an infant in one creel, and a ftone 
on the other fide of the horfe, to keep up an equilibrium ; 
and when the grafs became fcarce in the fheallings, they 
returned again to their principal farms, where they remain- 
ed while they had fufficiency of pafture, and then, in the 
fame manner, went back to their fheallings, and obferved 
this ambulatory courfe during the feafons of vegetation ; and 
the only operations attended to during the fummer feafon 
was their peats or fuel, and repairing their ruftic habita- 
tions. When their fmall crops were fit for it, all hands de- 
fended from the hills, and continued on the farms till the 

lame 



of Bolejkine and Abertarf. 



Fame was cut and fecured in barns, the walls of which were 
generally made of dry ftone, orwreathed with branches or 
boughs of trees ; and it was no fingular cuftom, after harveft, 
for the whole inhabitants to return to their lheallings, and 
to abide there till driven from thence by the fnow. Du- 
ring the winter and fpring, the whole pafturage of the coun- 
try was a common, and a poind-fold was a thing totally un- 
known. The cultivation of the country was all performed 
in fpring, the inhabitants having no tafte for following 
green crops or other modern improvements. 

Alteration Jince 1746. — From the year 1746, the minds of 
the inhabitants feemed to have taken a different turn ; the 
wadfetters, finding no longer the importance of their fub-te- 
nants, cottars, and dependants, withdrew their former fami- 
liarity and protection ; and thefe thereupon imbibed a fpi- 
rit of independence ; and trailing to their own induftry and 
exertions, many of them quitted their native country, for a 
better mode of living ; and thofe who remained, being now 
obliged to pay money-rent in place of their former fer- 
vices, became more attentive to the cultivation of the foil. 
The wadfetters rights, having been all redeemed by the 
Crown, while in pofleflion of the Lovat eftate, became then 
fenlible of their precarious tenures, and exacted from their 
tenants an additional rent, proportioned to the value of their 
poflemons ; and it muft be acknowledged, that this change 
of fyftem made a great alteration on the appearance of the 
inhabitants ; they no longer were feen at church or market 
with garments the produce of their own Iheep, fpun by 
their wives and daughters, and the fimple fare of their an- 
ceftors entirely loft its relifti ; the labourer increafed his de- 
mand of wages ; and the principal tackfman, thereby find- 
ing the returns from his holding not to bear proportion to his- 
wants, bethought himfelf of a different plan of management,

and exchanged his former tenants and dependants for a ftock 
of foiuh country flieep. This ftcp, altho* it had the appear- 
ance of great rigour, has turned out much to the advantage 
of the tenantry, who thereupon retired to the town of In- 
vernefs ; and applying themfelves to indultrious labour in 
the two manufactories there, they thereby not only impro- 
ved their living, but were enabled to give education and 
trades to their children, fome of whom are now fending 
grateful remittances from diflant climes. The introduction 
of fheep, though it at firft had only the effect of banifhing 
the fmall tenantry, will, if fuccefcful, in a few years have the 
fame tendency towards the principal tackfmen ; and this 
once populous country will then exhibit the fame fcene of 
depopulation as we behold in the borders of this part of the 
united kingdoms : at fame time, the fuccefs of this new plan 
appears problematical, from the ftate of the climate, which 
we Ihall now attempt to defcribe. — But we muft here, in 
treating of this parifh, make a diftindtion betwixt the parts 
of it to the eaft of Suichuiman, and thofe to the weftward ; 
the latter mall be denominated Abertarf, and the former 
Stratherrick. 

Cli?7iate. — The country of Abertarf, containing an exten- 
five plain from the weft end of Lochnefs to the bounds of 
the parilh of Kilmanivaig, is hardly 30 or 40 feet above the 
level of the fea ; and owing to this circumflance, as well as 
to the temperature of the lake, it is very little addicted to 
any lafting mow ; but from its contiguity to the Weftern 
Ocean, much more liable to floods of rain than the eaftern 
part of the parifh. — Stratherrick, rifing gradually from the 
river Taif to an altitude of 400 or 500 feet above the level 
of the lake, with the exception only of the principal refi- 
dence of the famil3 r of Foyers, and fome other pofleffions 
on the banks of the lake, being nearly the central point be- 
twixt 



ofBoleJkine and Ahcrtarf.

twixt the eaftern and weftern feas, is not liable to inceflant 
rains ; hut, from its being furrounded with very high hills, 
it is not only accuftomed to an early fall of fnow, but it is 
in the remembrance of many perfons now in life, to have 
feen the country for 6, 8, and 9 weeks, in fuch a (late that 
not a tuft of heather was to be feen. It is true, this has not 
been the cafe for feven or eight years bygone,- but who can 
venture to fay that thefe feafons may not again recur ; and 
as the produce of the country in corn and bay could not 
fubfift its prefent immenfe flock of the woolly fpeoes for 
, one week, the queftion is, in that event, in what manner 
they can be preferved from ilarvation ? 

Soil. — The foil in this parifli is of different qualities ; that 
 in Abertarf confiits, in the furface, of light black mould, but 
landy in the bottom ; and in moft years, from the gtL-at 
moifture iffuing from the rains and vapours, to which that 
part of the parifli is generally liable, the growth of corn and 
I grafs is very abundant ; but except early crops, it is very 
feldom got fafely fecured. In Stratherrick, except in the 
few farms on the banks of Lochnefs, the foil is of a quality 
nearly approximating to mofs. On the fouth hde of the 
i country it is generally obferved that the furface is not above 
a foot or 18 inches from the chingle ; on the north, from 
two to three feet deep •, but as the whole united parifli is in- 
1 terfe&amp;ed by a variety of rivers, the lands on the banks 
thereof are frequently found to contain abundance of clay, 
which in many places is very near the furface ; and as thefe 
rivers are permitted to flow in their natural direction, with- 
out any interruption, they frequently inundate the neigh- 
bouring plains, and often lacerate and demolifli thofe parts 
thereof contiguous to them ; and when thefe overflows hap- 
pen in the winter or fpring feafons, before the crop is fown, 
the effeft thereof is greatly to ameliorate vegetation, and 

the

the confequence is a redundant crop of corn •, but when this 
happens after the feed is in the ground, it generally proves 
the deftrucfion of the crop ; but the portions of lands, conti- 
guous to rivers, always produce the mod exuberant crop of 
natural hay and pafturage. 

Agricultural Procefs. — Although no parifh is better fup- 
plied by nature with limeftone, there being abundance 
thereof in the lands of Foyers in Statherrick, and in Aber- 
chalder in Abertarf, it is with regret we mint mention, 
that the fame has proved of very little benefit to the inha- 
bitants of this parifh. We do not learn that any part of 
Abertarf has been tried with lime as a manure, although 
many of the farms are within a very little diftance of the 
quarr}'. It is true, Mr James Frafer, writer to the fignet, 
proprietor of the lands of Gortuleg, has, within thefe 5 or 
6 years, manured his ground with lime brought from the 
quarries of Mr Frafer of Foyers ; from the ruggednefs of the 
road, he is obliged to lead the lime-ftone on horfes backs to his 
farm, or places nearly contiguous thereto ; and as he has abun- 
dance of convenient fuel, he is enabled to burn them, in kilns 
built in the corners of his fields, with lefs expence than any 
of his neighbours -, and although the confequential returns of

ufual in that country, the great expence of procuring this 
manure, does not feem to afford fufficient encouragement, for 
his example admitting of imitation ; but probably the he- 
ritor of thiS quarry, may lay down a plan, for difpofing of 
the raw materials, at a moderate rate, for a fpecific number 
of years, and his neighbours may thereby be induced to 
make fufficient roads to the quarry, and thereby, with all 
local inconveniences, make a trial pf this fpecies of manure, 
eipecially as the country abounds in variety of moffes, 
which has now been found by experience to be an excel

lent fubjedt of improvement, when drained and fufficientfjr 
manured with lime. It Ihould not be omitted, that fome of 
the principal tackfmen in this country, have of late years 
been in the pra&amp;ice, of ploughing their ground, in the latter 
end of harveft, and beginning of winter ; but the generality 
of fub-tenants continue the old mode of labouring, which, 
fo far as we have been able to learn, was as follows: When 
:a field was 3, 4, or 5 years lea, and failed to produce any 
jgrafs, if calculated for bear, it received one ploughing as 
foon after harveft as was convenient, and in fpring it was 
:fpread over with a compoft of old divot, fod or turf, and 
.dung, and in the beginning of fummer the lands were a fe- 
cond time ploughed, and fown with bear, and afterwards 
(yearly with black oats, while it yielded any tolerable pro- 
duce: if unfit for bear, it was tauthed in the preceding 
] fummer, or covered with the fame compoft as above-men- 
tioned during the winter, and fo on fucceflively cropt with 
oats, every following year, in manner above fpecified ; and 
it was no uncommon pra&amp;ice, for a farmer to take 5 or 6 
fucccffive crops of oats from the fame field ; the reafon af- 
II figned for this frequency of crops is, that the feverity of the 
I winter ftorms rendering it neceffary for the inhabitants to 
! houfe their cattle, it was expedient, by every method, to pra- 
, vide the means of their fubfiftence. 

Produce. — The grain of this country, was anciently bear 
1 and black oats ; and before the introdu&amp;ion of fheep, the 
I country abounded in black cattle, and on them the tenants 
i chiefly relied for payment of their rents ; and we have been 
j affured, that the number of cattle annually fold from this pa- 
rifh, would exceed 800. In Abertarf, from the mildnefs of 
i the climate, thefe cattle were often difpofed of early in the 
year ; but in Stratherrick they were fo reduced during the 
pourfe of the winter, as not to be faleabletill the months of

Auguft or September. But as more than three-fourths of thi» : 
parifh is now covered with (heep, the number of black cattlejl 
is proportionably diminilhed ; and it may be fafcly compu- ' 
ted, that there are now fold annually from this pariih ironvj 
2000 to 3000 fheepand wethers. Within the lalt 30 years, 
the tenantry in general have run much upon potatoes, and ' 
in the country of Abertarf, this article of late years confti- 
tutes the principal part of their crop ; and in Stratherrick, 
although a hilly country, every tenant and cottar has a pro- 
portion of his ground planted with this valuable root ; and 
it fhould alfo be recorded, that two heritors of this country, 
having of late years been at considerable expence, in clear- 
ing their grounds of ftones, levelling the fame, by removing 
the banks or interftices, vulgarly called merins, which are 
now frequently to be feen in the unimproved part of the 
country, building dikes, &amp;c. have alfo introduced a rota- 
tion of crops ; the firft by fowing turnips, following that 
with bear and grafs-feeds ; and it is to be hoped, that thefe 
fuccefsful attempts will become hereafter an objecl: of imi- 
tation. — Mr Frafer of Gortuleg having about 4 years ago 
imported a fpecies of grain called red oats, brought from the 
neighbourhood of Edinburgh, he has had fuch profperous 
returns, that mod of the tenants in the country, to whom he 
is fo obliging as communicate what can be fpared of the 
produce, now prefer this grain to the black oats ufed by 
their anceftors, as it is not only found to produce a redund- 
ant crop of ftraw, but to ripen as early as the native grain 
of the country ; but it would appear from the trials made, 
that this grain deteriorates in two or three years trial, and 
therefore a triennial importation would feem proper and 
neceffary. Mr Frafer has alfo inclofed fever*! of his fields 
with thorn hedges, which are in a thriving condition. 

The natural wood of this country is chiefly birch, allar, 
^nd hazel ; but from the. great trunks found in all the

mofles, there feems no doubt, that the face of the country 
1 was anciently covered with fir and oak trees. The two 
labove-mentioned heritors, of late years, have much impro- 
ved the face of that part of the country where they refide, 
by large plantations of fir, larch, &amp;.c. &amp;c. 

So far as have been difcovered, there appears to have 
ibeen no minerals of any value in this country, excepting 
jthe lime-ftone quarries on the eftate of Foyers and Aber- 
chalder, as already noticed. 

This country, does net appear ever to have been an ob- 
ject, for any great man to fix his refidence in, and therefore, 
l we can trace no remains of any edifice worthy of obferva- 
tion. But it would be wrong to omit mentioning the cele- 
brated fall of Foyers, which is fituated in this parifh, and 
the beautiful ride from Invernefs to this cafcade, amidft a 
fmooth road, cut through tremenduous rocks, and fhaded by 
a natural hedge betwixt the fame and Lochnefs, which, to- 
gether with a variety of fcenery prefenting itfelf amidft 
the thundering noife of the cafcade, has frequently engaged 
the admiration of travellers. 

The garrifon of Fort-Auguftus, fituated at the weftern 
end of the loch, on a plain of no inconfiderable magnitude, 
having the river Tarf on the fouth-eaft, the river Oich to 
the weft, and on all fides furrounded with hills towering to 
an extravagant height, has often been admired for the va- 
riety of the landfcape ; and as it lies in the centre of com- 
munication betwixt the Weftern Ifles and the South, feems 
fufiiciently calculated for the eftabliftiment of a market, for 
the feveral produce of thefe countries; and it is hoped, that 
the one lately attempted there, will, in time, prove of much 
public utility. 

Were we to defcribe the various glens and valleys which 
are to be feen in this parifh, it would prove more a degree 
of partiality to our native country, than- any benefit and

amufement to the reader. But it would have been unpaw 
donable, to negledt giving a fhort defcription, of the pro*, 
du&amp;ive fhealling or grazing called Killin : It is totally con, 
cealed from the few ftrangers who are pleafed to vifit the 
inhabitants, being furrounded with hills of an immenfe 
altitude, and the accefs to it fo rugged, as frequently to en- 
danger the lives of infants, when tranfported thereto in 
manner above defcribed. It is bounded on the eaft by a 
lake, from whence ifl'ues the principal river compofing the 
Fall of Foyers; on both fides of this loch the recks defcend 
with fuch inconceivable gradation as hardly to be paflable j 
on the north fide it is fo fteep that it is denominated Eakin, 
or Neceffity, implying the great difficulty of palling that 
•way ; on the fouth-fide called Craggin, or Rocky j and not- 
"withftanding all the attempts by the inhabitants to render 
it paflable, it in fome parts only contains a path of two or 
three feet in breadth ; and if a horfe ftumbles, or is in the 
leaft affrighted, it tumbles down by a precipice into the 
deepeft part of the lake, and melancholy inftances of this 
kind have fometimes occurred. When we come to the end 
of this curious path we are flruck with amazement ; behold 
a valley covered with all fpecies of verdure, a computed 
mile in length, and a half mile in breadth, bifected by a rt-j 
ver flowing in a meandrous courfe, compofed of a variety 
of ftreams descending from the hills at the welter end ; and 
on all fides the ground, riling by imperceptible progreffion 
to the clouds, appears green to the very fummit. To this 
ihealling, the inhabitants, in ancient times, performed their • 
periodical migrations in manner above defcribed ; but fince 
the introdu&amp;ion of fheep, the fame has been moftly detach- 
ed from the former poflefibrs, and is now principally inha- 
bited by fliepherds and their flocks. 

This parifli abounds in a variety of lakes, viz. Lochfar- 
raline, Lochgarf, the two lakes of Knoky, Lochtarf, Loch--

killin, &amp;c. Sec. and abound in a variety of fifli, which has 
frequently proved the amufement, and a delicious repaft, to 
Grangers, as well as to the natives. 

The manners of the inhabitants of this parim have under- 
gone a material change within thefe 50 years; before that 
; period they lived in a plain fimple manner, experienced 
i few wants, and poffeffed not the means, nor had any 
defire, of procuring any foreign commodities. If they had 
i fait and tobacco, paid their pittance of rents, and performed 
their ordinary fervices to their fuperiors, and that their con- 
I duel; in general met their approbation, it feemed to be the 
1 height of their ambition-, but this chain of attachment having 
1 been loofed, if not difmembered, by the abolition of heri* 
! table jurifdiclions, &amp;c. which foon fucceeded the lament- 
1 able troubles of the. years 1745 and 1746, the better fort or 
principal tackfmen having become more indifferent about 
j their inferiors, this infpired them with a fpirit of independ- 
ence. But though they have fhaken off the prejudices of 
clanilh chivalry, the imprefllon of attachment to their na- 
tural fuperior is not totally defaced ; for upon a late occa- 
fion, when their young chief had a call for men, in loyal 
fupport of his King and Conftitution, it is a recent fact, that 
the heritors and principal tackfmen of this difhi£t held a 
meeting, and affeffed themfelves in men or money accord- 
ing to their feveral abilities : Their effort was abundantly 
fuccefsful, without any breach of law or good order, and 
their example tended much to accelerate the national levy 
thereby intended -, and if the heritors of this country, will 
but perfevere in treating their inferiors with the fame ten- 
dernefs, humanity, and fympathy, which they have hither- 
to experienced from the reprefentatives of the firfl family 
in this diftridt, we flatter ourfelves, that we fhall not fee a 
final period, to this fpecies of reciprocal fenfibility, which 
probably, in a greater degree, is to be found among the

Aborigines of this diftritt, than in that more eligible country 
in which, after quitting this panlh, they eftablifh their fet- 
tlement; and were it not reckoned a digreffion from the 
fubject of the prefent effay, we would exprefs our admira- 
tion, to behold the attachment the natives of this country 
bear to their natale folum ; that after wafting the prime of 
life in foreign climes, and in fervices honourable to thcm- 
felves, and ufeful to their country, they limit their ideas to 
that domeftic retirement, which has produced fo many 
fcenes of beauty and improvement, as in our vifit to that 
diftri6t, the eyes are conftantly ftruck with -, and when we 
are informed, that their tenures are by no means of a per- 
manent nature, protection, united with affability and com- 
placency on the one hand, and implicit confidence on the 
other, excites our wifhes that fuch principles were to be- 
come more general throughout the nation. 

Having already obferved, that in the days of old, the 
whole pafturage of this country, after concluding the har- 
veft, was a fpecies of common, we muft not forbear to 
mention, that in modern times the practice is widely diffe- 
rent ; every tenant now-a-days is attentive to prefcrve his 
own bounds j and as the principal farms were fome years ago 
granted under Jeafes of 19 years endurance, with a limited 
obligation to recompenfe the tenants for pertain improve- 
ments, this has produced feveral inclofures of various kinds ; 
and though we cannot but fidmire the tafte with which 
fome of them have been executed, they have a tendency to 
divert the eye from the native deformity of the furface. 
This emboldens us to fay, that if heritors in general were 
more liberal in their encouragement to thft tenantry, and 
were they relieved from thofe fetters which their ancestors 
had impofed upon them, frequently beyond their abilities, 
that we would foon obferve an exuberance of produce, and 

thofe 



of Bolejkine and Abertarf. 3 5 



thofe fcenes of beauty and urbanity, which ftrike us with 
pleafure and admiration in many improved diftricts of Scot- 
land. 

This parifh, being fituated in a part of the great opening 
betwixt the weft and the fea, denominated of old Glenn- 
more-na-h'alabin, or the Large Glen of Caledonia. It may 
not be impertinent to this fubjett, to notice, the evident pub- 
lic utility that would refult, by opening a communication, by 
water, betwixt the Murray Frith at Invernefs and the: 
branch of the Weftern Ocean at Fort-William. The Author 
of Nature feems to have intended this as a practicable mea- 
fure : the diftance, taken in a ftraight direction, does not much 
exceed 50 miles ; of this, Lochnefs, Lochoich, and Lochlochy, 
all fit for navigation, make up betwixt 30 and 40 ; and 
though we cannot venture to prognofticate, that the expen- 
diture of uniting thefe lakes would return an immediate re- 
compenfe, we muft beg leave to lignify our belief, that the 
employing the excreffive wealth of this country in fuch ope- 
rations, would, in proceCs of time, redound more to the na- 
tional advantage, than the fporting thereof in fpeculative 
fchemes on tranfalantic plantations, liable to the deftructive 
inroads of Charibs, &amp;c. &amp;c. 

We cannot entertain a doubt, that it muft be the blame of 
the heritors, if the tenantry of this parifti, fo near to inex- 
hauftible lime-quarries, will not, in time, imitate the fuc- 
cefsful experiments already made, of ameliorating the pro- 
ductive value of their feveral tenements. But whether this 
mode will be found to yield a greater revenue to the land- 
holders than covering the whole country with flocks of 
:hccp, is beyond our abilities to determine ; but we may 
with confidence affirm, that this mode can alone reftore the 
decreafe of population of this country, which falls in courfe 
of our plan now to be ftated. 

Formerly, Abertarf was inhabited by the numerous and 

hardy

hardy race of the names of Macdonald, Macgruers, Kenne- 
dies, and Frafers, and fome of the principal towns or farms 
poffeflcd by gentlemen of much eftimation in the country; 
but this part of the parilh having, within thefe 30 years, ex- 
changed its proprietors, it is now almoft totally under flieep, 
and hardly contains the tenth part of its former inhabitants; 
and fome parts of the country of Stratherrick, having been 
converted into flieep- walks, has confiderably reduced the 
number of its people : So that in exhibiting the following 
Itatement, taken from a late accurate investigation, we re- 
gret much to find it confiderably Ihort of the ancient inha- 
bitants it formerly contained. In Dr Webfter's report, 
anno 1755, the number of fouls is Hated at 1961. The pa- 
rilh at prefent contains 378 families, but of thefe at leaft 18 
are connected with the garrifon of Fort-Auguftus, and 70 
invalids, who all live in the fort ; and the number of inha- 
bitants, (including invalids), in the whole parilh, amounts 
only to 1741 ; making a decreafe of 220 fouls. From the 
number of men who have inlifted in his Majefty's fervice, 
in the courfe of the prefent war, it may be affirmed, that the 
proportion which the female fex, bears to that of the male, 
is from 3 to 2. 

School. — The only fource of education the inhabitants of 
this parilh have hitherto enjoyed, was a fchoolmafter efta- 
bliflied by the Society for Propagating Chriftian Knowledge, 
in the village of Fort-Augnftus, who has had frequently 
from 70 to 80 and 100 fcholars ; but, in refpeft there have 
not hitherto been any parochial fchoolmafter eftabliftted in 
this diflricl, that inltitution has lately been withdrawn ; but, 
as we underftand, that the whole heritors of this parilh, are 
unanimous in their wilh to have this defeft remedied, we 
hope foon to fee that uleful appointment revived under the 
patronage of the Honourable Society; and it may with con- 
fidence

fidence be aflerted, that no place in the north country frands 
more in need of fuch an inftitution. At prefent, fuch of 
the tenants as have ability, fend their children to diftant 
places, for the means of education ; but thofe of the poorer 
fort, mud neceflarily be void of any fpecies of literature. 

For what reafon we cannot aflign, but we do not find that 
there has been any regular baptifmal regifter, kept in this 
parifti, for many years paft. 

Rent. — The valued rent of this parifti, as appears from 
the general valuation-book, made up in the 169 1, amounts 
to L. 3295 : 3 : 4 Scotch ; but what the real rent of it may 
be, or how far the fame may admit of increafe, or be liable 
to diminution, a circumftance depending upon the prefent 
fpeculation of fheep-farming, is what we cannot take upon 
us to afcertain. 

Church and Manfe. — The prefent incumbent has a com- 
modious manfe, and a large church, -which would contain 
the whole of the inhabitants of this parifti, built and flated 
about 30 years ago. Thefe underwent a late reparation at 
a confiderable expence to the heritors ; but, from the ex- 
pofure of both thefe edifices to the violence of the ftorm v 
they will almoft require an annual repair, for which there 
was a fund eftabliftied at the laft prefbytery vifitatioa, 
which, if wifely applied, may in future relieve the heritors 
from a great expenditure, fimilar to what they were lately 
put to. 

Stipend. — So far as we can learn, the old flipend parable 
to the clergyman was L. 75 Sterling, including communion- 
elements ; but, by a late augmentation, it was increafed to 
L. 105 Sterling, and is all payable in money, there being no 
vi&amp;ual rent in this parifti. The minifter has no other farm. 



38 Statijiical Account 

in addition to his glebe, excepting a fmall grafing on the Lo- 
vat eftate, for which he pays a moderate rent. 

Cbara&amp;er. — The inhabitants of all ranks, are very regu- 
lar in their attendance on divine worfhip ; but we regret to 
mention our information, that the lower fet, art apt to af- 
femble in the evening at whilky-houfes : the late parliamen- 
tary prohibition to diftillation, has brought about a great re- 
formation in this refpeft, having almoft annihilated thefe 
nuifances of retail, and we hope never again to obferve, fiich 
frequent violation of morality and decency in this parifli. 

Heritors. — Befides the Lovat family, there are fix other 
proprietors, each of whom poflefles a feparate mill ; and 
there are three mills on the Lovat property in this parifli. 

Antiquity. — We do not know of any monument of anti- 
quity worth the mentioning, excepting that, on the eaft 
confines of this parifli, there is a towering hill of great alti- 
tude, and difficulty of accefs on all fides, which, in the Gae- 
lic language, is called Dunardile, on the fummit of which 
there appears the remains of an old fortification ; and we 
are informed that a fimilar tower is in the fame direction, 
contiguous to the houfe of Invergarry, in the parifli of Kil- 
manivaig •, and the tradition of the country is, that thefe 
hills were watch-towers for giving fignals upon the ap- 
proach of an enemy, which was done by large fires, com- 
pofed of wood and other combuftibles, and this feems to 
correfpond with the Gaelic etymology of the appellation, 
dun fignifying a hill, ard high, and dyil Carnochs, or fol- 
lowers of a tribe. 

Police. — We cannot conclude this narrative, without ob- 
ferving, that though few of the heritors refide in this pa- 
rifli,

rim, the principal inhabitants pay great attention to the 
police, fuch as eftablilhing conftables, holding regular meet-, 
ings of Juftices of the Peace, for conducting and repairing 
the highways, &amp;c. See ; and though it muft be acknow- 
ledged, that feveral miftak.es are committed in forming their 
plans, yet, if the fldll and experience of the gentlemen of 
this parifh was equal to their patriotic zeal, no diftrict 
would be better fupplied with thefe means of public accom- 
modation.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6407953">KILMADOCK OR DOUNE</name>, 



(County of Perth, Synod of Perth and Stirling, 
Presbytery of Dunblane). 

By Mr Alexander Macgibbon.</head> 



<p>Origin of the Names. 

T^HE ancient name of this parifh is Kilmadock. Thee 
word kil, is the fame with the Gaelic word cill, (the; 
«onfonant c, in the Gaelic, being founded hard, like k inn 
Englifh), iignifying a church-yard. Some make this wordJ 
to fignify a burying- place ; but the Gaelic word for this is:; 
cladh. The word cill, is, perhaps, the original of the Eng- 
lifh word cell., which lignifies the cave, or little habitation 
a religious perfon. 

But, whatever may be the true etymology, it is evident. ! 
that the fequeftered fpot known by the name KilmadochA 
had been once the folitary habitation of Saint Madock, 
(Saint Madocus), and, perhaps, was the place of his inter-; 
ment, as thefe pious fathers were commonly buried near t 
their recfcifive habitation. 

Thd 



ofKilmadock or Boune.

The church, or monaftery, it is to be prefumed, was, there- 
: fore, originally dedicated to this faint •, and hence the parifli 
1 obtained the prefent name. There are many other names of 
1 parifhes in Scotland from the fame origin. Such are Kil- 

martin, Kilmalie, Kilmarnock, &amp;c. 

Formerly, the church flood on the fpot jufl mentioned ; 

but having become ruinous, a new church was built in the 
 town of Doune, in the year 1756; lince which period, the 

parifh has been frequently called Doune. The origin of 
I this name will be explained under the title Doune Cajlle. 

Situation. — This parifh is part of the we Mem diftrifl of 
: Perth/hire, and comprehends a confiderable portion of the 
1 ancient ftewartry of Monteith. It is fituated in the prefby- 
jtery of Dunblane, and fynod of Perth and Stirling; and lies 
I very near the centre of Scotland. 

Both the ancient and prefent churches lie low. But the 
greateft part of the grounds in the parifh command a gi and 
view of Benlomond, and the neighbouring mountains, and a 
beautiful profpeft of the caftle of Stirling, and the fine coun- 
try that enriches the banks of the winding Forth •, nor is the 
fcenery rendered lefs beautiful, by the romantic banks of 
ithe Teith, which wafhes the fides of the ancient caftle of 
Doune, and rolls along the piclurefque groves of Blair- 
|Drummond •, and while the eye of the beholder is exhauUd 
by the endlefs variety of the objects in view, its fatigue is ge- 
neroufly relieved by the ftupendous hills of Tough, Gar- 
gunnock, and Kippen, that extend, in a noble ridge, from 
eaft to welt, for the fpace of 20 miles. 

Extent, Soil, Produce, — This parifh lies north and fouth 
and, like moft of the other parifhes in Scotland, is irregular 
in form. The neighbouring parifhes arc, Muthill on the 
north, and north-eaft ; Kippen on the fouth ; Dunblane, and

part of Lecropt and Kincardine, on the eaft; and Callander, 
part of Port of Monteith.and another pare of Kincardine, on the 
weft. It is feparated from Muthill, by a hill called Uuine- 
voir, (which is, properly, Uyigb-mor) ; and from the parifli 
ol Kippen by the river Forth •, and for a confiderable way 
north from this river, it intcrfecTts the parilh of Kincardine. 
The whole area of the parilh is fuppofed nearly equal to a 
fquare of 8 miles, or 64 fquare miles. 

The foil is various, viz. carfe-clay, till, loam, fandy foil, 
boggy foil, heath or moor, and mofs. The lands on the 
fide of Forth are rich carfe clay •, the riling grounds to the 
north comprehending the lands of Coldoch, Craighead, 
Spittalton, and Gartincaber, are moftly a rich garden mould; 
the fouth hanks of the Teith, are a mixture of till and loam; 
the north banks, and the grounds for, perhaps, a mile north- 
ward, are not fo rich, having a mixture of fand. In this 
diftridl, however, there are feveral farms of excellent quali- 
ty, capable of producing all forts of grain in perfection, par- 
ticularly, in the lands of Craigton, Annat, Argaty, &amp;c. 

The higher grounds of the parilh, extending to Uaigh- 
mor, are moftly wet boggy ground, and mofs and moor. 

The lands round the town of Doune, being occupied by 
the inhabitants, and enriched with the manure of the place, 
and the cattle-markets, are now rendered a fine garden 
mold ; and thofe to the eaft of the town, comprehending the 
lands of Newton and Row, are a ftrong rich till, perhaps, 
equally fertile as carfe clay. The quality of thefe lands, 
probably, gave rife to their name, Row, which is, likely, 
the fame with the Gaelic word ruadh, fignifying reddijli, 
thefe lands being of a reddifli colour. 

The various foils above defcribed, at the fame time, con- 
fill of various degrees, on account of their local fituation. 
The lands on the fouth fide of Teith, rife gradually towards 
Gartincaber, and, from thence, flope gradually to the level

carfe on the banks of Forth ; the whole forming a ridge, 
running from north-weft to fouth-eaft, and extending along 
the lands of Lochfield, the houfe of Gartincaber, &amp;c. where 
the foil is coldeft, and mod barren-, growing warmer and 
richer on each fide, as the grounds decline towards Teith on 
the north, and the Carfe of Forth on'the fouth. When an- 
cient Caledonia was covered with woods, the wood along 
this ridge would be called, the grove on the hill /ide, which, 
in Gaelic, is Garraii-cabhar \ and hence the prefent name, 
Gartincaber. 

The lands of Newton and Row are in the fame form of 
a ridge, and hence exhibit various degrees ; and as the 
grounds on the north banks of Teith rife, gradually, to a 
confiderable height, the foil, though of one general quality, 
grows colder, and more barren, as the rife increafes, the up- 
per farms being far inferior in fertility to thofe on the river 
fide. 

The produce, like the foil, is various, vi%. wheat, rye, 
oats, barley, beans, peas, clover, rye-grafs. and flax. The 
foil is alfo friendly to all kinds of roots, particularly the po- 
tatoe, and turnip, which grow in great abundance and per- 
fection. 

Mr Dougal Balfour, a {kilful farmer, in the year 1784, 
fowed 3 bolls of red oats, at Callichat, which produced no 
lefs than 48 bolls, yielding an equal quantity of meal. 

There is no wheat raifed, except in the carfes on the 
banks of Forth ; though the molt of the lands on the fouth 
fide of Teith, as well as the Rows, and Newton, are capable 
Of producing it. A potatoe crop it accounted better hulban- 
dry, where the grounds are free and dry. This root en- 
riches the land, in place of exhaufting it, like wheat ; and 
when the crop is drilled, fo as to admit horfe-hoeing, it is 
equal to a fallow. The potatoe is fucceeded by a crop of 

barley,

barley, with grafs-feeds, which is found to be an excellent 
rotation. 

Hills. — Although the grounds of the parifh rife from 
the level of the Forth, to a great height on the north 
boundary, yet they cannot, properly, be called hilly 
ground. The afcent is regular and progreffive, and carri- 
ages of all forts may be conveyed to any part, except the 
hill on the north. The proper name of this hill is Uaigh- 
mor, fignifying great cave, or den; there being a cave in 
the rock, on the fouth fide of the hill, which was formerly 
the haunt of robbers. Thefe were only extirpated about 
40 or 50 years ago. 

Woods. — There are very few plantations, or natural 
woods. The heritors of this parifti are extremely carelefs 
of planting. Nothing is more friendly to agriculture, in a 
cold climate, than warming the fields by woods, and ftripes 
of planting ; and the pleafures of the imagination are much 
refined by the profpect of romantic woods and groves •, be- 
lides, when fuch immenfe fums are annually remitted to 
Norway, 8cc. for timber, there is an abfolute necellity for 
attending to ufeful plantations at home. In fliort, the culti- 
vation of foreft trees, unites in itfelf economy, profit, and 
beauty. Yet, ftrange to tell, the whole of this parifh ap- 
pears almoft totally barren of planting. There is no diftrict, 
perhaps, in Scotland, that affords greater fcope for ufeful, 
as well as ornamental planting, than the parifh of Doune : 
Large tracks of moor, unfit for any cultivation, or for pro- 
ducing even grafs, which would raife all kinds of fir ; and 
there are multitudes of wafte corners, through the arable 
grounds, that might be ufefully employed in railing all forts 
of timber. In a very fhort fpace of time the grounds would 
wear a different afpect, and agriculture be much improved.

No gentleman has exhibited a more ftriking proof of the 
Tilth of the above remark, than the late Lord Karnes, in 
he wonderful difplay of his tafte and judgment on his 
:ftate of Blair-Drummond •, which, from a bleak barren 
*afte, without a fhrub, may now vie even with the molt 
Luxuriant fcenes of fancy. His Lordfliip has united art to 
lature, profit to pleafure, and judgment to tafte, in fuch an 
aftoniftiing manner, that one, while beholding the effecT: of 
improvements on this fpot, feels a fatisfa&amp;ion of enjoyment 
aot to be expreffed. 

It would be improper here to pafs unnoticed the fine 
drefled lawns of Cambufmore, where the verdant larix reara 
her lofty cone, to deck the dark fullen brow of the Gram- 
pian mountain •, and where the rolling ftreams of the Teith 
refound through the encircling grove. 

Nor is it here unpleafant to mention the charming po- 
licy of Newton, where the aged oak rears his majeftic 
boughs, to warm and protect the feeble ftem of the tender 
fprig. 

The Earl of Moray, who is proprietor of one-third of 
the parifti, has, of late, turned his attention to the improve- 
ment of his eftates here ; and there is no doubt of his 
Lordftiip's fetting a noble example to his neighbours, from 
the proof he has given of his tafte and judgment on his 
eftates in Fife. Lord Moray's lands are finely adapted for 
planting and inclofing •, and the revenues of this wealthy 
nobleman, can admit of thofe experiments, which fmaller 
heritors often feel a burden too heavy to bear, unlefs when 
they prove fuccefsful. 

Springs, Lakes, Rivers, Fijhiiig. — This parifh abounds 
with fine water fprings, from its peculiar fituation on the 
edge of the Grampian mountains. From the fides of 
Uaighmor a great number of fprings iflue; and at one place, 

near 



45 



Statijlical Account 



near the burn of Garwall, there is a very large fpring, burfU 
ing out of the folid rock, in the form of a fpout, the watenf 
whereof are fuppofed mineral, though no trial has been made 
tof their quality. 

The town of Doune is plentifully fupplicd with fpring* 
ef foft water, that never dry in the warmeft fummer ; and 
the banks of Teith abound with fimilar natural fprings. Irt 
fhort, the whole grounds are liberally fupplied with water, 
for the ufe of man and beaft. 

Below the hill Uaighmor, there is a confiderable lake* 
formed chiefly from the multitude of living fprings men- 
tioned above j called Lochmaghaig, which is a Gaelic wordy 
and means the loch at the level field — aig, being the Gaelic 
word for at, and rnagh, for a level field; fo the loch juft 
mentioned lies at the level below Uaighmor. This lake 
forms nearly a circle, and is about a mile diameter. The 
adjoining heritors are, the Earl of Moray, whofe grounds 
nearly furround it, and Edmonftone of Cambufwallace, It 
is of confiderable depth, but no exacl: founding has been 
made^ 

There is a fmall lake near Gartincaber, not near fo largs 
as Lochmaghaig. Except thefe, there are no other lakes 
within the parilh. 

The river Forth bounds the fouth end of the parilh, and 
has been already defcribed. It is navigable as far as the 
cruives of Craigforth, and could be eaflly rendered fo ail 
the way to Gartmore, by deepening one or two fords. 

The Forth abounds with falmon ; an account of the rim- 
ing whereof is given in the Statiftical Account of the pa- 
rilh of Stirling. The tract of the river above Craigforth is 
fo narrow and deep, that the net cannot be ufed with fuc- 
cefs.

akes, and falls into Loch Ludnich * a noble lake above 
Callander, furrounded with ftupenduous rocks and moun- 
:ains, totally inacceffible from the lake on the weft fide. The 
dream is confiderably increafed by this lake ; and, iffuing 
from the fouth-eaft end of the loch, it dailies over precipi- 
ces, rocks, and cataradts, till it reaches the romantic village 
of Callander, where it beautifully meanders round the mea- 
dows and arbours, as if unwilling to leave this delightful 
Fpot. Being at length forced to depart, it holds a rapid 
courfe for feveral miles, walhing the ancient chapels of 
Torry and Lanerick, the church of Kilmadock, and the 
iAdelphi cotton-works ; and, palling the bridge of Doune, 
at length approaches the caftle. From thence it moves 
gently along the folitary walks of Blair-Drummond, and 
the grotefque pleafure-grounds of Ochtertyre, and joins the 
Forth about 3 miles north-weft of Stirling. 

The banks of this river were frequently honoured with 
the prefence of the late Lord Karnes, whofe profound ge- 
nius, and refined tafte, has conferred fo much honour on 
Scotland. This great admirer of the works of nature, ha- 
ving wandered along the banks of this beautiful river, till 
he reached that fpot below the caftle of Doune, where the 
fcenery is remarkably piclurefque ; and being wrapt in ad- 
miration of the grandeur of the fcenery in view, refted him- 
felf on a feat erected in honour of a favourite friend, on 
which he immediately placed this infcription :

The river Teith abounds with excellent trout and fabl 
mon, which are caught chiefly by the rod and hook. There! 
is a cruive erected below Doune caftle, where great nuraJpj 
bers of falmon are caught ; but, owing to the expence off! 
keeping up dam-heads on this rapid river, which, in rainy 
feafons, fweeps every thing before it, there is no other 
cruive of confequence ; though, when manufactures increafeiJ 
and water machinery is erected on this river, cruives will! 
become common; and thus multitudes of fillies be taken alll 
the way towards Loch Ludnich. 

Befides the fifhing of the Teith, Lochmaghaig abounds 
with pikes and perches ; but no trout or falmon. The pikecj 
and perch in this lake are very large, and, when properly™ 
drefled, afford tolerable good food ; but, for want of boi ts, 
few are caught. 

There are a number of fmall rivers, or burns, that rum 
from the north into Teith, which are excellent for all kinds 
of water machinery, and afford very fine trout-fifhing, efpe» 
cially after rain. 

The largeft is Ardoch, which rifes from Lochmaghaigfl 
and is joined by the burn of Garwell, (a fmall rivulet thai-.j 
j-;fes on the eaft fide of Uaighmor), and, after runnings

through part of the parifh of Dunblane, (where it is called 
the Water of Kilbryde), joins the Teith below the cattle of 
Doune. 

The next in fize is Kelty, which bounds the parilh on 
the weft, and joins the Teith at Cambufmore, about a mile 
eaft of the village of Callander. 

The other rivulet of confequence is Annat, or Camhus, 
which is remarkable -for its beautiful cafcades, near the 
houfe of Annat, where, by the force of the ftream, in times 
of floods, it has formed a deep glen out of the folid rock. 
The houfe of Annat ftands on the brink of a grand cafcade, 
known by the name of the Caldron-linn, from the conftant 
boiling of the waters, like a feething caldron. This burn 
joins the Teith at the church of Kilmadock, rendering the 
fpot extremely delightful and romantic. 

Befides thefe, there are a number of other fmaller rivu- 
lets, that render the grounds pleafant as well as valuable, 
affording warm retreats to the cattle in ftormy weather, and 
a plentiful fupply of water in time of drought. 

Wild Animals and Bu ds. — The wild animals here, are 
the fame as in the neighbouring pariihes, hares, rabbits, 
foxes, badgers, otters, foumarts, or polecats. The braes on 
the north-eaft fide of Cam bufwal lace houfe have been long 
a receptacle for badgers and foxes ; but thefe mifchievous 
animals are now much baniftied. There are great numbers 
of otters to be found in the borders of Lochmaghaig ; and ' 
on the fides of Uaighmor, the ftag bounds along the heath. 

Partridges breed in great numbers, especially on the 
north fide of Teith. All kinds of moor-fowl are to be. 
found on the high grounds towards Uaighmor; and Loch- 
maghaig abounds with herons and wild-geefe. In the win- 
ter feafon, the geefe fly down in the morning to mofs Flan- 
ders, where they remain till evening, and then return to

the loch. It is very pleafant to behold thefe fagacious biid 
living in a beautiful firing, beating the air molt uniformly 
and regular, and keeping watch by turns, even on their 
journey. 

Roads and Bridge}. — The great roads from Edinburgh 
to Fort-William, and from Glafgow to Perth, pafs through 
this parifh, eroding each other at the town of Doune. Thefe 
roads are far from being in good order, but application is 
made for making them turnpike. The road to Fort-Wil- 
liam paries along the north fide of Teith. 

Except thefe two roads, there are no other roads, public 
or private, in the parifh, paflable in bad weather. 

The public are equally ill fupplied with bridge's, though, 
it is evident, from the preceding defcription of the rivers 
and burns, that communication mufl be much obflrufted in 
time of floods. There is no bridge over Teith, below Cal- 
lander, except one near Doune, called the Bridge of Teith. 
This is a ftrpng building of % arches, and has flood the tefl 
of 266 winters, though often in extreme danger, by the ra- 
pidity of the current, in time of thaw, after froft. This 
pfeful bridge was eredled by Robert Spittal,' tailor to King 
James V. about the year 1530, previous to which, there 
was only a ferry-bpat ; and tradition reports, that Mr Spittai 
coming this way, happened to leave his money behind ; 
the churlifh boatman refufed to ferry him over ; to refent 
which infult, the generous tailor immediately built the 
bridge, and fo punifhed the b oatman  by ruining his bufi- 
nefs. Rut, be this as it may, Mr Spiital was a man of a 
noble mind, and benevolent heart •, and the hofpital he 
founded in Stirling, for the relief of poor tradefmen, is ano- 
ther monument of his patriotic virtue. 



Climate, 



of Kilmadock or Doune. 



Climate, Difeafe, Longevity.— This parifh is an extremely 
healthful fituation. While the Grampian mountains pro- 
tect it from the nipping frofts of the north, it is finely ex- 
pofed to the Atlantic breeze, and heat of the fun. The 
rapidity of the river Teith, and the fmaller rivers, have 
likewife a ftrong tendency to fweep away thofe noxious va- 
pours that haunt the low countries. Being lituated in the 
centre of the kingdom, the climate is mild, and free of 
thofe raifts that drench the weftern coaft, and the piercing 
winds that blow incefTantly on the inhabitants of the ea- 
ftern borders. Hence, in this parith, there are very few 
difeafes. The inhabitants enjoy a clear healthful atmo- 
fphere, and live to a good old age. Several remarkable in- 
ftances of longevity have appeared in the parifh ; and, at 
prefent, men of 60, 70, and 80, are to be found in health 
'and vigour. 

The only fatal difeafes are, the fmall-pox among the 
children, and fevers and confumptions among the middle 
aged. 

The fmall-pox often makes dreadful havock among the 
children of this diftrict, owing to the practice of inoculation 
not being general. The country people conceive it highly 
improper to permit aay aft that tends to bring trouble or 
diftrefs on their helplefs infants. This extreme care and 
anxiety is a ftrong mark of parental fondnefs and love ; but 
experience is the ftrongeft argument, and nothing ought 
fooner to conquer ancient prejudices. The fmall-pox is 
evidently an epidemical difeafe; and, if it be true that the 
natural pox is much more deftruttive than the inoculate, no 
perfon fiiould hefitate in adopting the practice, h has been 
clearly fhewn, from the practice of many eminent gentle- 
men of the faculty, that, in the natural way, one in four or 
fi ve generally dies ; but, by inoculation, not one of a thou- 

fand ; 



UtatijUcLil Account 



land ; and fome can boaft of having inoculate ten thou- 
fand, without the lofs of a lingle patient. 

Fevers and confumptions are the confequence of hard la- 
bour, bad food, and colds. They are, therefore, molt pre- 
valent amongft the country people. The food of many of 
the people of this parilh is extremely poor. No attention 
is paid to the advantage of a kitchen garden. The houfes, 
too, are, in feveral places, wretched huts, fcarcely capable 
of iupporting the roof, and far lefs to defend againlt the 
ftorm and colds of winter. The roads are likewife deep, 
and impaflable ; and the infufficient clothing adds to the ge- 
neral train of caufes. 

It is therefore an object of great importance for the 
heritors to repair the roads and houfes- It cannot be ex- 
pected that a tenant, for 19 years, will make roads, or build 
houfes, to laft for, perhaps, 100. Hence, the poor tenant 
patches up a miferable rickle, with a damp earthen floor, 
more like a humble fheep-cote, than the rural habitation of 
the generous farmer. Unlets the farmer be ftrong and vigo- 
rous, the landlord cannot expect either a high or a well paid 
rent ; but, by making the tenants feel happy and comfort- 
able, he may depend on a thriving tenant, and an increafcd 
rental. 

A regifter of the weather will be inferted, among the ge. 
ncral tables at the end of this Report, along with a ftate of 
the feafons for fowing and reaping the various crops raifed 
in the parilh. 

Population. — In the year 1755, the whole number of 
iouls in the parifli, according to the report to Dr Webfter, 
were 2730 ; but at prefent they amount to 3209, including 
thofe employed at the Adelphi cotton-works. A particu- 
lar account of the population is given in the general tables, 
fhewing the number of families, farmers, tradefmen, &amp;.c.

•and of each particular age, fex, and religious perflation.- 
The Adelphi cotton-works being lately burnt, about 20 fa- 
milies left Doune. 

Language. — The language of the common people in this 
parifh, like many of the parifhes in the neighbourhood, is 
a mixture of Scotch and Englifh. This jargon is very un- 
pleafant to the ear, and a great impediment to fluent con- 
verfation. No language is more expreflive than the Scotch, 
when fpoken in perfection •, and, though the accent be fliort 
and unmufical, yet it is by no means difagreeable to hear 
two plain country men converting in the true , Scotch 
tongue; but, in this parilh, you feldom meet with fiich in- 
ltances. — In the quarter towards Callander, the generality 
of the inhabitants fpeak Gaelic; and this is perhaps flill 
more corrupt than even the Scotch, in the other quarters of 
the parifli. It is impoftible to conceive any thing Co truly 
offenfive to the ear, as the conversation of thefe people. 
The true Gaelic is a noble language, worthy of the fire of 
Oflian, and wonderfully adapted to the genius of a warlike 
nation ; but the contemptible language of the people about 
Callander, and to the eaft, is quite incapable of communica- 
ting a noble idea. 

It ought, therefore, to be earneftly recommended to the 
people of this parilh, and, indeed, to other pariflies in that 
quarter, to ftudy a more perfect ltyle; either to praftife the 
true Gaelic, the true Scotch, Or the true Engliih tongue. 

But all kinds of civilization in fociety go hand in hand ; 
and vvhen arts and fciences begin to fiourifli here, the lan- 
guage will gradually polilh and refine.

along the lawn, is quite carelefs of modern refinement, trust- 
ing his Succefs and profperity to the kind hand of provi- 
dence, and the faithful bofom of the earth. He is now, 
however, beginning to perceive, that man was not formed 
a frmple paflive being, but inquifitive, active-, perfevering, 
and induftrious. The genial warmth of religion, and the 
piercing, rays of philofophy, begin to expand his ideas ; he 
now perceives, with wonder and aftonifhment, the exten- 
sive powers of the human mind i and, like a man awake 
from a dream, he Starts at the recollection of thofe wild 
ideas of uncertainty that formerly employed his imagina- 
tion. Hence a fpirit of activity is faft Spreading among the 
inhabitants of this district ; and when once they are com- 
pletely awake from their paft (lumbers, it may be reafon- 
ably hoped they will foon excel in arts and Sciences. There 
are many laudable examples, of late, held forth by men of 
fpirit and enterprise among them ; the genius of commerce 
and agriculture appears to have vifited their borders ; and, 
Should they once be Sensible of their local advantages, no 
pariSh in Scotland will, perhaps, excel this, either in popu- 
lation or wealth. 

Towns. — The. only town in the parifh is Doune. The 
name originates from the town being Situated near by the 
ancient caftle known by that name, which will be explain- 
ed under the title Doune Cajlle. 

It is very probable this town is coeval with the caftle ; 
but while public worfhip was diSpenSed at Kilmadbck this 
town was very trifling ; and when the church at Doune was 
built, in the year 1756, there were very few houfes, except 
fome fcattered huts. Since that period, however, the va- 
cancies have been Supplied with neat buildings covered with 
Slate.

The town confifts of one ftreet, of a commodious breadth, 
running from the bridge of Ardoch, a confiderable diftance 
weft, to a point where the roads from bridge of Teith and 
Callander meet. On this point a very neat market-crofs 
is erected ; and, pafling the crofs, the ftreets divide with 
the road, each divifion continuing fo far as two bridges 
thrown acrofs a fmall rivulet that runs fouth to the Teith. 
The three ftreets, thus fituated, form exactly the letter Y- 

As formerly mentioned, the fituation of Doune is low, 
but it is very healthful and dry, being clofe on the banks 
of Teith, and upwards of 40 feet above the run of the wa- 
ter. This neat town ftands on excellent ground for build- 
ing. The foundation is hard channel, covered with a coat 
of rich earth for gardens ; and this continues a confider- 
able way north, and about a mile and a half weft, the banks 
of Teith, forming a neat level fpot, whereon ftand the two 
great cattle markets, held at Michaelmas and Martinmas 
annually. 

There is no public building in the town ; but a patriotic 
gentleman, one of the natives, lately propofed to erect a 
town-houfe for public occafions, with a fpire, a bell, and a 
clock, and a market-place behind. The plan is worthy of 
the gentleman who propofed it ; and, it is hoped, the people 
of the place will put it in execution. 

The village of Buchany lies on the Callander road, at the 
weft end of the plain mentioned above, and below the houfe 
of Cambufwallace, which ftands on the funny fide of a 
gentle rifing ground, commanding a view at once extenfive, 
pleafant, and delightful. From the top of Cambufwallace 
parks, the eye is prefented with an endlefs variety of pic- 
turefque objefts, comprehending the river Teith, the village 
and caftle of Doune, the policies of Blair- Drummond, and 
Stirling Caftle. 

Buchany 



Statijlical Account 



Buchany unites with another village at the burn of An. 
nat, (here termed the burn of Cambus) ; and if ever this 
were to turn a commercial diftricl, thefe villages and the 
town of Doune would very foon unite. 

There are no other towns or villages within the parilh. 

Doune Cajlle. — This is a very noble and extenfive edi- 
fice. It is romanticly fituated on a peninfula, at the junc- 
tion of Teith and Ardoch, to the fouthreaft of the town, 
commanding a full view of the Teith and bridge, and fur- 
rounded with groves and verdant fields. Nature has point- 
ed out this fpot as a place of ftrength, at leaft well fuited 
to the art of war in ancient times ; and, it is more than pro- 
bable, that, at an early period, this fpot was ocpupied by 
fome fortification, long before the prefent edifice was erec- 
ted. This is the more probable, when it is confidered, that 
the prefent caftle was built by one of the Earls of Mon- 
teith, at a time when Monteith was a lordfhip of regality ; 
It is natural to prefume, that the family would have called 
the edifice the Caftle of Monteith, after the lordlhip to which 
it belonged ; but having called it Doune, we may fuppofe 
that this was the ancient name of the fpot whereon the build- 
ing was ere&amp;ed. 

The word Douneis Gaelic, as moft of the names of places 
in this parilh are. It retains the exact found of the Gaelic 
word dun, which fignifies a round hill or riftng ground, the 
mark, over the vowel u fignifying that this vowel is found- 
ed long, which renders the pronunciation the fame with the 
prefent name Doune. There is no doubt of this being the 
origin of the name, for the caftle ftands on a beautiful 
mound, at the conflux of Teith and Ardoch, which, of 
c  rl would alwavs be called the Mound or Hill, (in Gae- 
lic Dun).

The cattle is a huge fquare building, the walls heing 40 
i feet high, and about 10 feet thick. The' tower is erec- 
; ted on. the north-eaft corner, and what remains of it is about 
( 80 feet in height ; but its maffy thicknefs detra&amp;s very 
1 much from its appearing lofty. The north-weft corner of 
the caftle has been the family-refidence. The ftrong wall 
; mentioned above inclofes a fpacious fquare, each fide where- 
of is 96 feet. The great gate ftands on the north, and the 
iron gate and bars ftill remain entire. There are feveral 
cellars and prifons on the ground-floor, on each fide of the 
entry •, and, after being introduced into the great area, you 
afcend to the tower and family-houfe by two outfide flairs, 
Handing over againft each other, that appear to have been 
once Ihaded by a roof fupported with ftone pillars, which are 
now in ruins. 

The welter flair leads up to a fpacious lobby, that divides 
the kitchen from the great hall. This hall is 63 feet long, 
i and 25 feet wide, and the roof has been covered with ftone 
or (late, but nothing now remains except the walls. The 
kitchen chimney extends from the one lide of the room to 
the other, being fupported by a ftrong arch ftill entire ; and 
the whole building, on this lide, has the remains of grandeur 
and magnificence. 

The eafter ftair leads up to the apartments in the tower. 
The firft is a fpacious room, with a pend roof, and a large 
chimney, containing a middle pillar. This room commu- 
nicates with the great hall at the north- weft corner,.. a»d was 
perhaps the family dining-room. There are feveral other 
apartments in the upper ftories : but the grandeur of this 
edifice is completely effaced by thofe terrible prifons it con- 
tains. 

From the fouth-eaft corner of the dining-room above 
mentioned, a narrow ftone ftair defcends, and leads, by a 
fubterraneous paffage, into a cell or dungeon, that lies below

except what it borrows from a little room above, through » j 
fmall fquare hole in the pend roof of the eel), left for the \ 
i purpofe of preventing fuffocation, and to let down the fcan- •] 
ty pittance of the captive. 

In this horrid pit was fhut up the unhappy victim of the 1 
baron's difpleafure, where he lingered out a miferable ex- 1 
jftence. 

O, defpotifm ! fure thy fway eludes the piercing eye 
Of gentle freedom, and the ray of glorious liberty ; 
And, in a cell remote and far from every focial right, 
Configns thy victims to defpair and univerfal night \ 

It is quite uncertain when this caftle was built, as no date j 
appears on any part of it. Being the family-feat of the 
Earls of Monteith, it muft have been built while this power- ] 
ful family had a fhare of the government. From its 
itrudture it appears to be very ancient; and, as the earldoms 
of Fife and Monteith were in feparate families till united 
in the perfon of Robert, fon of King Robert II. of Scot- 
land, the mod probable conjecture is, that this magnificent 
building was erected by one of the Earls of Monteith pre- • 
vious to the time of Robert. 

The firit Earl of Monteith (W alter Cummin) was crea- 1 1 
ted by Malcolm III. anno 1057, and this nobleman was af- 
terwards appointed Lord High-fteward of Scotland. This 
Walter was the grandfon of Bancho, who was murdered by 
Macbeth; and having, with the affiftance of Macduff (for- - 
merly Thane, now) Earl of Fife, quelled a rebellion that 
threatened Malcolm, and {lain the leader of the rebels, the* 
King immediately conferred this high dignity upon him. 
In ancient times an officer was appointed in each diftrict . 
for collecting the King's revenues, and administering jufticc, 
who was called a Thane, and the fuperior officer over the 

whole c 



of Kilmadock or Doune.

whole was called the Abthane. So the title Earl being in- 
troduced by Malcolm in place of Thane, the Lord High- 
fteward was in room of the Abthane. 

From this Walter, Lord High-fteward, the family of Stu- 
arts, that reigned fo long over Scotland arofe ; and though 
the re was no doubt a Thane of Monteith before the time of 
Walter, yet the high dignity conferred on this nobleman 
affords ample room to conje&amp;ure, that the prefent magnifi- 
cent caftle of Doune was begun, and perhaps finifhed, in 
his time. What ftrengthens this ftill more is, that Mal- 
colm and his four fons, Duncan II. Edgar, Alexander I. 
and David I. who reigned fucceflively over Scotland during 
a period of £7 years, cultivated the arts of peace, and fo af- 
forded leifure for fuch extenfive buildings as the caftle of 
Doune. David was himfelf a very great friend to archi- 
tecture, having built the noble church at Dunblane, and fe- 
veral others. 

Tradition, however, reports, that the Caftle of Doune was 
built by Murdac Duke of Albany, and Earl of Monteith 
and Fife. But, however much we may be difpofed to give 
credit to local tradition, yet the account of the life of this 
unfortunate nobleman leaves great room to doubt how far 
it was poffible for him to rear fuch an edifice. At that 
time, no doubt, the power of fuch a nobleman was great ; 
and, having his vaffals and dependants ready at his call, he 
•could make a ftrong effort to rear buildings in a fhort time; 
but fuch a vaft building as the Caftle of Doune could not be 
finifhed for many years. 

Murdac was ton of Robert, who was fon of Robert II. 
King of Scotland. Robert was created Earl of Monteith, 
anno 1370 ; and in 1398 he was created Duke of Albany ; 
and in 1406 he fucceeded to the government, on the death 
of his brother Robert III. and governed Scotland 15 years.

Statiftical Account 



In- the year 1401 Murdac was taken prifoner by the 
Englifh at the battle of Homelden, and detained till ex* 
changed for Percy, 141 1 ; and, on 3d September 1430, he 
iucceeded his father in the government; but, being of a flug- 
gilh difpofition, and fcarce fit to manage his own family, he 
was. obliged to refign the government in 4 years, and fo 
could have neither the time nor judgment neceffary for fuch 
a building 3s Doune Caftle. 

Perhaps it might be contrived by Murdac's father, who 
was a man of a bold enterprifing fpirit, generous and hu- 
mane, and much efleemed by all ranks of people, at home 
and abroad. But any account of the true date of the caftle 
can amount only to probability. 

The misfortunes of Murdac feem equal to his indolence. 
For alter being prifoner in a foreign country 10 years, he 
led a retired life until the death of his father, when he en- 
tered on. his fhort reign of 4 years, as Regent over Scotland, 
and foon became overwhelmed with the load of ftate affairs. 
His refignation was fuddenly followed by an accufation of 
high-treafon againft him and his two fons, Walter and 
Alexander, and Duncan Earl of Lennox, his father-in-law,, 
who were feized and carried prifoners to Stirling. Mur- 
dac was taken betwixt Doune and Dunblane, at a fmall ri- 
vulet, which was therefore called Murdoch's ford, and it re- 
tains that name to this day. 

In fummer 1423 the prifoners were tried and condemn- 
ed, and beheaded on one of the Govane hills, to the north 
of Stirling Caftle, about half-way from the caftle to the 
bridge. Ifabella, Murdac's wife, being carried from Doune 
Caftle to the Caftle of Tantallan in Lothian, the heads of 
her father, hufband, and children, were fent to her in the 
prifon, to try if, impatient of grief, lhe would reveal the 
fuppofed treafon ; but her anfwer was noble and elevated :

wo fons, are intombed in their family burying-place, in a 
fmall ifland of the Loch of Monteith, which lies near the 
Kirk of Port. 

During thefe lamentable tranfa&amp;ions the Caftle of Doune, 
is well as Falkland in Fife, were feized by the King, and 
-emained annexed to the Grown till the year 1502, when 
Margaret, the daughter of Henry VII. King of England, 
►vas married to, James IV. King of Scotland, and got fettled 
Dn her, in liferent, the Caftle of Doune, and certain lands in 
Monteith. After the death of James IV. fhe married Hen- 
ry. Lord Methven, a defcendant of Murdac. Duke of Alba- 
jy. This marriage took place in. the year 1528 ; and im- 
mediately thereafter the Queen, with confent of her fon 
King James V. and of her hufband Lord Methven, granted 
to James Stewart, a younger brother of her hufband Lord 
Methven, and anceftor of the family of Moray, the cuftody 
of the Caftle of Doune for his life ; and which right was a 
few years afterwards converted into a feu to him and his 
heirs by King James V. This office had been enjoyed by 
the family of Edmonftone of Duntreath, and occafioned a 
ideadly quarrel betwixt the families, which ended in the af- 
fafiination of the above James Stewart by Edmonftone of 
Duntreath. But James, the fon of the above James Stew- 
art, obtained full poffcllion of the caftle, and was afterwards 
created Lord Doune, by charter anno 1581. Since this pe- 
riod, the caftle has remained in the pofleflion of the Earl 
of Moray's family without interruption. 

Agriculture. — The variety of foil in this parilh opens a 
very wide field for agricultural ftudy. There is fcarcely a 
fingle farm but has a change of foil in it, and hence, by 
/kill and induftry, can be rendered fit for almoft every 
prop.

Statijtical Account 



It is rather beyond the limits of thefe Statiftical Inquiries 
to enter into the minutiae of an agricultural furvey ; but, as 
the ftate of agriculture is the mod important object, it may 
be proper to arrange the obfervations thereon under diftincl 
heads : 

jf. Draining. — The firft object of the farmer is to fee that 
the grounds be made fufficiently dry. It is in -vain to look 
for good crops while the ground is wet or fpongy. The 
feed generally rots, and, though it happen to take root, the 
plant never ripens. By this means, the farmer finda it loft 
labour to plough or fow thefe wet and fpongy parts of his 
farm. The parifh of Kilmadock abounds with fuch wafte 
corners, efpecially where improvements have not made any 
progrefs. Almoft in every part, even in Monteith and 
Rows, you fee round fields of corn, with the intermediate 
fpaces filled with wet, fpongy, and fometimes boggy ground. 
Thefe wafte places are pallured with cattle, attended by a 
hind, who, being always negligent, allows the field to be 
eat round the border, perhaps one, two, and in fome places 
three yards deep. This is a very ferious concern to the far- 
mer. Indeed his crop generally fails ; and, being thus abu- 
fed by the cattle, what remains will fcarce replace the feed, 
and pay the labour. A fingle drain would cure the evil. 
The places that thus lie wet are generally the richeft of the 
farm, and capable of railing the belt crops ; and, were they 
properly drained, the whole field would become arable and 
fit for inclofing. It is unneceffary to mention any particu- 
lar plan of draining, as this muft depend on the fituation of 
the field. There is, perhaps, one-fourth of the parifh of 
Kilmadock requiring drains, that is, prefently, almoft ufe- 
lefs ; but which, if drained, would be the moft valuable of 
the whole. 

-a. Levelling. — This is likewife an important article. The 
parifh of Kilmadock is very irregular in the furface. A 

few

few well dteffed fields are to be feen in the property of emi- 
nent improvers, but the rugged face of nature ftill covers 
the greateft part. There can be no, perfect hulbandry un- 
lefs the fields are regular. A Hope in a field is no difad- 
vantage •, but fudden hollows, intermixed with mounds, will 
never yield regular crops. Befides, thefe hollows are gene- 
rally wet, while the mound is parched, and thus the field ri- 
pens unevenly. Levelling and draining ought, therefore, 
to go hand in hand. Sometimes the levelling of a field will 
fupply the place of draining •, or draining may anfwer the 
purpofe of levelling. 

' While the grounds are neither drained nor levelled, it 
cannot be expected the farmer will perceive the advantage 
of inclofures. If you fuggeft the inclofing of a field, the 
anfwer is, that, by inclofing and fubdividing, the half of the 
grafs (meaning the places requiring to be drained and le- 
velled, and which are ufed for grafs) would then be loft. 
The farmers Ihould firft be taught the practice of draining 
and levelling \ and whenever the ufelefs corners of the fields 
are brought into culture, an inclofure Would become an ob- 
vious advantage. 

3. Clearing of Stones. — The grounds on the north fide of 
Teith are very much infefted with ftones, that obftrucr. and 
break the plough ; and feveral fields are wholly covered 
over with round bullets, giving the grounds a very wafte 
and barren appearance. 

It is unneceflary to mention the propriety of clearing the 
fields of ftones, efpecially thofe that obftruft the plough. 
Carrying ftones off a field is gaining fo much additional 
ground, for the trifling expence of carriage. Some farmers 
will gravely tell you, that the fields are the better of the 
ilones that lie on them. There never was a more miferable 
excufe for lazinefs. Stones lying on a field can furely be 
«f no ufe, except to occupy, perhaps, the half of the furface, 

which

which mould be covered with corn. Until the practice ofJ 
laying down fields with fown grafs was introduced, every 
farmer preferved the round bullets of (tones on his fields 
very facredly •, but, when they came to cut the hay, thefe 
fuppofed friends proved noted enemies to the fcythes, and, 
at length, drove the farmer to the neceffity of turning off 
the (tones to fave his inftruments ; and thus mere neceffity 
introduced the practice of clearing ground of (tones. Hence 
it may eafily be marked, in the parifh of Kilmadock, what 
fields have been under the culture of grafs, from the fmooth 
furface. 

4. Trenching. — The molt effectual method of draining, le- 
velling, and clearing of (tones, thofe fields that are wet and 
fpongy, is to trench the whole ; yet this ufeful art is not 
known here. Trenching, though expenfive in the mean 
time, is the cheapeft of all improvements in the end. The 
reafon that farmers foon tire of draining their fields is, 
becaufe they feldom happen to difcover the true fprings ; 
and, when they (till obferve the water overflowing their 
fields, they become difpirited, and never make another at- 
tempt. The fame is the cafe with ftony fields : Though the 
farmer one year clean the furface of (tones, the next plough- 
ing turns up as many ; and country people, being foon dif- 
couraged, give up the conteft. By trenching the field, the 
real origin of the fprings are difcovered, and every (tone 
that obftructs the plough can be taken out. In going over 
the field, the trenchers have no more to do than place a 
(take wherever they find a fpring ; aud, when the whole field 
is dreiTed, it can then be confidered where the common drain 
fhould be placed, fo as to communicate with the fprings thus 
difcovered. The bed drain for fuch fields is a ditch, filled 
half up with the round (tones taken out of the field, and co- 
vered over with a fuflicient depth of earth. A field thus 

dreffed

hreffed will produce excellent crops, and foon repay the la- 
bour. 

5. Straightening Marches and Burns. — There can never be 
any real improvements while the marches are crooked and 
irregular. As heritors have the authority of an acl: of Parlia- 
ment for compelling their neighbours to ftraighten marches, 
there is no excufe for allowing any to remain uneven. The 
irregularity of marches is always an obje&amp;ion againft in- 
clofing, and the fource of endlefs ftrife between the tenants. 

In the parifli of Kilmadock the marches are mamefully 
irregular. The eftate of Gambufwallace was lately inclofed, 
and the marches ftraightened, which has had a wonderful 
effect on the profperity of the farmers. By the advantages 
of inclofures and ftraight marches, the tenants are able to 
pay an advance rent, and live much better than when 
their rents were low, and the ground open and irregular. 

The ftraightening of fmall burns and rivulets is an impor- 
tant article. Thefe feeble ftreams are generally fond of 
wandering along a multitude of ferpentine windings, occu- 
pying an immenfe ftretch if lengthened out in a ftraight 
line. By calling a ftraight ditch in the centre, the whole 
ground occupied by the windings would be gained, and the 
links, formerly fanded and ufelefs, could be converted into 
arable land. Of all other foils thefe haughs are the richeft. 
They would produce all kinds of grain in perfection, parti- 
cularly flax; and, when laid down in grafs, no pafture would 
be equal, either for ftielter in time of ftorms, or for fuccu- 
lent food in time of drought. 

6. Dividing Run-rig Lands J and Commons. — There were 
feveral farms in this diftrict, run-rig, and large tracts of 
wafte common moors, not long ago, but thefe are all now 
exchanged and divided, which may be confidered the hap- 
py prelude of future improvements. 

Vol, XX, I 7. Inclofmg^.

7. Inclojing. — The fields being drained, levelled, cleared 
of {tones, and trenched where neceffary, the marches 
ftraightened, and interfperfed fields exchanged, inclofing 
then becomes an obvious advantage. 

There is fcarcely more than one- tenth of the parilh of 
Kilraadock inclofed and fubdivided, though excellent ftones 
for dikes could be got almoft every where, and hedges 
could be reared over three-fourths of the grounds. 

The grand objects of inclofing are, the fafety of the crop 
from cattle, and the eafe of the cattle while feeding j either 
of which advantages are alone fufneient to recommend a 
fence. It is a ferious matter for a farmer to have, perhaps, 
the breadth of one or two yards round his fields deftroyed 
by the cattle. It is a propofition in geometry, that the 
fmaller the area the greater is the circumference in propor- 
tion. Hence, the fmaller the field, the greater is the da- 
mage from the cattle. 

The parifli of Rilmadock, where wafte and uninclofed, is 
ploughed in detached fields, while the intermediate fpaces 
sire ufed for pafture. The confequence is obvious : That 
the circumference or border of each field is abufed by the 
cattle, or the grafs loft ; either of which is a very ferious 
difadvantage to the farmer. 

With regard to the eafe and fafety of the cattle, the dif- 
ference of open from inclofed fields is beyond calculation. 
A cow is an animal that is fond of eafe, and never thrives 
under the management of a hind. A cow, again, loves to 
crop the morning dew, and to reft at noon. The hind, on 
the contrary, cannot rife betimes, and is therefore under the, 
necefiity of feeding the cattle in the heat of the day, when 
they wifh to lie down and reft. A cow is likewife fond of 
Vying down at evening, without the fatigue of travelling far 
to her bed ; the hind, on the contrary, drives her home ta 
the ftall, where file is tied to a ftak.e like a criminal. In 

fliort, 



of Kihnadock or Doune.

ihort, the advantage of inclofures for cattle can only be rec- 
koned by experience. The ftrongeft proof of their excel- 
lence is this circumftance, that no grazier who once knows 
their value will ever after rent open uninclofed fields. 

8. Rotation of Crops. — There being few inclofures in 
Kilmadock parifh, rotation of crops has made very little 
progrefs. In the diftricl above the Teith, the abfurd prac- 
tice of having infield and outfield Hill prevails. This prac- 
tice is the ftrongeft mark of the imperfect ftate of hufban- 
dry in former times. When wheel-carriages were little 
ufed, and dung was the only manure, the farmers conftant- 
ly fpread it out upon the fields near the dwelling-houfe, and 
thefe fields were, on that account, commonly in tillage 
every year. The fields at a diftance received no ma- 
nure at all, except the produce of the pafturing cattle, 
and thefe were inclofed in temporary folds, in the middle 
of the day and during the night, erected on the arable out- 
fields, and moved (or, in the more emphatic term of the 
farmers, flitted) at the end of every week. Thefe fields, 
when thus manured, were ploughed the next year, and one 
or two crops more taken, and then allowed to fward for 
grafs. Here, in a peculiar manner, was felt the lofs of fown 
grafs. Independent of the want of a crop of hay, the field, 
from the dreary flubble, required two or three years to ren- 
der the grafs of any ufe for pafture. The cattle were ex- 
tremely food of the infant grafs, and conftantly poached and 
deftroyed its growth ; and thus the farmer generally loft the 
ufe of his grafs fields for at leaft 2 years in every 8 or 10. 
How very different their fituation under the new human- 
dry. By taking a hay crop, the farmer reaps more profit 
than from having the field in corn -, and, during the growth 
of the hay, the roots of the grafs fpread and cover the fur- 
face with a ftrong coat, capable of lupporting the feet of 
the cattle the following year, when the pafture is rich, frefli, 

and

and abundant. Of all improvements in hufbandfy theftj 
hundred years, fown grafs may be ranked among the moft 
Valuable. 

While it is generally acknowledged that plants rob the 
foil, it is at the fame time admitted, that they rob it in 
different degrees, fome more, and fome lefs, according to 
their nature, and manner of receiving food. Thefe evident 
truths at once fuggeft the idea of change •, as the farmer 
perceives it of importance to arrange his fucceflion of crops 
as may be leaft hurtful to the foil, and, at the fame time, 
moft profitable on the whole. Hence, the practice of rota- 
tion of crops. 

The advantages of this difcovery are manifold : Having 
a variety of crops, the farmer divides the labour of the 
year. He is in no rilk of the field not agreeing with the 
crop. And he can fupply the market annually with all 
kinds of proyifions. 

An account of the various rotations obferved in this pa- 
rilh will be given among the general tables. 

9. Size of Farms. — The farms in the parifli are of vari- 
ous fizes, as will be feen in the general tables. Formerly 
this parifli abounded with cottaries ; but thefe are now quite 
abolilhed, except a very few ; and, of late, the farms have 
been confiderably enlarged in many places, owing, partly, 
to the increafing independence of the farmer from his once 
miferable condition as a military bondman ; but the chief 
caufe is the introduction of the arts, whereby bodily labour 
has been fo wonderfully faved. The farmer, in ancient 
times, feldom reared any crop but oats, a little barley, and 
peas. With thefe he fowed his infield conftantly, and his 
outfield occafionally, when not in grafs. Hence, a fmall 
farm rendered him hurried in time of feed and harveft, and 
the manufacturing it occupied his whole labour during win- 
ter. In fummer he was literally idle ! In thefe enlighten- 
ed

*»d days the farmer is ploughing, fowing, and reaping* eve* 
ry month of the year. Wheat, rye, oats, barley, peas, 
beans, clover, and rye-grafs, flax, hay, potatoes, turnips, 
and other roots, are crops that afford work to the farmer 
in all feafons of the year, and hence he is enabled to manage 
a much larger portion of ground than under the old fyftem. 
And when the improvement of roads, implements of huf- 
bandry, mode of labour, &amp;c. are brought into the calcula- 
tion, it is at once plain how large farms have been introdu- 
ced. 

It is faid that large farms depopulate the country. This, 
however, is a conclufion that, can only be drawn from a 
partial view of the fubjedT:. There are two fpecies of la- 
bour, unproductive and productive. Unproductive, is that 
labour that barely fupports the labourer; productive, is that 
labour that fupports the labourer, and leaves a balance. 
The balance is produced to the commonwealth, and fo lef- 
fens the labour of others. If one year a man fupports him- 
felf only, and the next year he fupports himfelf and his 
wife, he doubles the population ; if he fupports himfelf, his 
wife, and a child, he triples the population, and fo on. 
Hence, the more labour produced by art or induftry, the 
greater is, or may be, the population. 

From thefe fads, it is plain, that if the enlarging of farms 
has not been owing to an increafe of labourers on thefe 
farms, but to art and induftry, that the population is there- 
by increafed. The population on the farms is indeed much 
diminiihed ; but the increafe of the provifions brought to 
market from thefe farms muft evidently be capable of fup- 
porting an increafe of population. If this increafe of provi- 
fions be exported for a fupply of luxuries, the art and indu- 
ftry of the laborious farmer, no doubt, difappears, and is 
wafted at the pampered tables of thofe who, in thefe days 
of vice, profligacy, and licentioufnefs, are falfely denomina- 
ted

ted the Great. That man alone can be called Great, who, 
having once produced the neceffarics of life in abundance, 
by art and induftry, deals them liberally around to feed a 1 
multitude. But he who fpends his time in (loth and idle- ' 
nefs, and fquanders and waftes the labours of the year in i 
riot and diffipation, is a being of all others the mod wretch. 1 
«d. 

When the population of the country happens to appear \ 
on the decreafe, it ought not therefore to be concluded, that 
the enlarging of farms is the caufe. We ought rather t« 
count the dilhes that now garnifti our table, and compare 
thefe with what graced the humble board of the fires of an- 
eient times.

io. Leafes and Rent. — The rents are now generally paid 
in money, and all perfonal fervices are abolifhed. The te- 
nants perform ftatute-labour on the high-roads, and pay all 
public burdens, fuch as cefs, &amp;c. 

The Earl of Moray frequently makes his rife-rent pro- 
greffive, at the end of 5, 7, or 10 years, of a 19 years leafe. 
This is an excellent method, and ought to be generally a- 
dopted. Towards the end of a leafe, where the rent has 
been the fame from its commencement, the tenant is difpi- 
rited at the profpe6t of a high rent, and when the rent is 
raifed, his ftock is exhaufted during the firft 3 or 4 years, 

and 



of Kilmadock or Boune.

I and it is a hundred to one if he is able to continue. But 
I when the rife-rent is progreffive, the tenant has no occafion 
| to dread the iflue of his leafe, becaufe, unlefs the improve- 
Indents be great, there is no variation from one of the com- 
Imon rifes in the progreffive fcale. Hence, he is always ac- 
Itive and induftrious, and aever defers improvements for the 
■ commencement of a new tack. 

As to the duration of leafes, various opinions have been 
Iformed. Without pretending to judge of a point fo uncer- 
tain, it may be noticed, that the duration of a leafe muft de- 
Ipend greatly on the fituation of the farm. If a grafs farm, 
I the only ufe of a leafe is to afford the tenant time for breed- 
ling the cattle, and difpofing upon them. Cattle thrive beft 
Ion the ground where they have been reared; and the un- 
I certainty of markets renders it dangerous for a grazier to be 
la tenant from year to year only. 

I As to arable farms, a variety of circumftances have to 
be confidered. I. The ftate of culture. 2. The manure to 
be ufed. 3, The rotation of crops. If the ground be 
wafte, and in need of improvement, the tenant mould have 
his leafe lengthened to encourage him. If the manure be 
quicklime, he cannot be removed fo long as the powers of 
the lime remain a&amp;ive. This may be from 6 to 10 years. 
Jf marl is ufed, the leafe muft be longer, as this manure 
lafts a confiderable while. If a rotation of crops be obfer- 
ved, the tenant cannot be removed during the rotation. 

From thefe circumftances, it is plain, that the duration of 
a leafe muft depend much on the nature of the farm, and 
the plan of management. 

11, Houfes. — The houfes are much improved of late. 
The tenants now begin to perceive the advantage of good 
houfes, and of living feparate frbm their cattle. 

On the fouth fide of Teith you meet with feveral 
very neat houfes, of two ftories, covered with flate, and

handfomely finiftied within. The offices ftand on each fide 
with tile-roofs, forming a rural fquare, at once pleafant, 
warm, and hofpitable. Farm-houfes of this conftruction 
are now becoming general ; yet, in many places, the houfe* 
are no better than what they were 30 or 40 years ago } ' 
cold, dark, footy huts; fcarcely a pane of glafs to be feen; 
roofs of thatch, nifties, heather, or broom; the cattle and 
people entering at the fame door ; earthen floors ; the 
fire on the hearth-ftone, and fcarcely a vent or chimney It 
is lamentable to behold the exalted character of the gene- 
rous farmer degraded by fuch miferable habitations. 

But the error lies on the fide of the matters. If a te- • 
nant's leafe is to laft only 19 years, he either builds no fen- • 
ces or houfes at all, or of fuch a nature as to laft little : 
longer than the leafe. Indeed, if he afted otherwife, he: 
would be injuring himfelf. In all tranfaftions, at home or* 
abroad, every thing ftiould be reduced to the teft of calcu- 
lation. It is manifeft injuftice towards a tenant to take him 
bound to erect dikes or houfes that ought to laft at leaft 100 1 
years, and give him only a 19 years leafe. None but fools,, 
madmen, or poor ignorant tenants, ftiuddering before theirrl 
laird, would bind themfelves fo abfurdly. The tenantt 
ought neither to improve, plant, nor build, without pay- 
ment. Neither ftiould he bellow manure, to laft longer r 
than his leafe, without a reafonable allowance at the iflue. 1 
All that the tenant, in juftice to himfelf, ought to do, is, to 
labour and ufe the land to the beft advantage, fo as not to 
leave it worfe or poorer than he received it. With regard 
to improving wafte ground, and building dikes and houfe9,, 
the proprietor ftiould pay the whole outlay, and charge the* 
tenant with a certain intereft annually. This plan was* 
pra&amp;ifed with the tenants of Cambufwallace fome years 
ago, And the example is fall fpreading over the parifti.

12. Roads. — The by-roads of the farmers, all over the 
parifli, are in a wretched condition, and abfolutely impaf- 
fable through the one half of the year. The carts and har- 
nefs are generally fhattered and broke in a few journies; 
and hence the horfes, carts, and harnefs, conftantly wear the 
marks of poverty, and, inftead of performing the work with 
vigour, both men and horfes foon languid) and decay. 

It is, however, pleafant to obferve the fituation of the 
farmer who ftudies improvements, who has d comfortable 
habitation, and good roads; the frefli bloom of contentment 
is feated on his countenance, his motions are fpirited and ac- 
tive, his implements of hufbandry appear as if frefli from, 
the hand of the painter, and his vigorous horfe is feeft paw- 
ing in the valley. 

13. Implements of hvjbandry . — While the lands were in- 
fefted with flones, the implements of hufbandry were ex- 
tremely meanV but good ploughs, and harrows of the bed 
conftruction, are now every where to be leen. Yet, where 
the grounds remain wet and ftony, the labouring utenfils are 
flill imperfect. What is termed the broad-plough is ftill 
ufed on the north fide of Teith. In this plough 4 horfes are 
yoked abreaft, with a goadman or driver placed before the 
horfes heads, with his face towards the ploughman ; and in 
this polition the driver walks backward, linking the horfes 
in the face to make them come forward { — The brake 
and cleaning-harrow are little known. The late Colonel 
Edmonftone of Newton introduced the new-invented turnip 
drill-plough ; but the farmers only looked and wondered at 
it, as they would at a rope-dancer. Several eminent far- 
mers have, however, fliewn noble examples of good hufban- 
dry, and are beginning to open the eyes of their neighbours,- 
from their farms appearing like fo many gardens, in the 
midft of a bleak uncultivated country.

Thrajlnvg-mill. — This is one of the mofl ingenious and 
mod ufeful inventions that has, perhaps, ever appeared in 
the world. 

The firit inventor was Michael Stirling, farmer in Craig- 
head, in the parifh of Dunblane, who died in the 89th year 
of his age, on the ift of February 1796. This venerable old 
man, when in the prime of life, had a ftrong propenfity to 
every curious invention and, after much thought and ftudy, 
he prepared and finimed a machine for thrafhing his corn in 
the year 1748, having employed tradefmen to execute the 
work under his direction. 

The axis of the thramlng-board, was placed perpendicu- 
lar, and was moved by an inner wheel, on the fame axis 
with an outer one that went by water. The men flood 
round about thefe boards like lint cleaners, each man with 
his fheaf, and performed the work with great rapidity. 

Mr Stirling's ignorant neighbours were, however, no way 
ftruck with the invention, but laughed at it, and called him 
a maggotty fellow. In fhort, like Noah with his ark, poor 
Mr Stirling was furrounded only with mockers, and at 
length he concealed his operations altogether. The won- 
derful powers of the machine, however, foon drew the at- 
tention of ftrangers, who came and picked up models, and 
fo were enabled to erect others, both in Scotland and Eng- 
land. Mr Stirling's machine, in one fhort winter-day, thrafh- 
ed 50 threaves of ftiff outfield corn, yielding 16 bolls of 
oats, which would have taken 16 days of one man to 
thrafh with the flail. This account was got from William 
Stirling, farmer in Craigforth, one of Michael Stirling's 
fons, who is a very refpe&amp;able man, on whofe report the 
public may rely. 

Mr Stirling's mill being perpendicular, was found rather 
inconvenient, and therefore Mr Meikle at Alloa, an inge- 
nious gentleman, conftructed a horizontal axis for the thrafh- 
ing- 



of Kilmadock or Bowie.

ing-boards, by adding another wheel, which had a wonder- 
ful effect, as the fheaf could be fpread fo as to be taken in 
and bruifed by rollers; and this likewife faved a number of 
hands, 

A particular account of the powers of this machine, and 
the faving to each farmer, will be given in the appendix. 

Manure. — There has been no limeftone or coal hitherto 
•difcovered in this parifh. The only local manure, there- 
fore, is dung, which is far from being fufficient for the 
lands •, and the farmers have to carry lime, as well as coal, 
■from Stirling, Sauchie, and other places, an average diftance 
of 12 miles to the parifh in general. Hence, the ground 
continues low rented, the time of the farmers being occupi- 
ed during fummer in carrying home lime and coal. A 
fmall navigable canal would be of the utmoft importance 
to the heritors, independent of the faving of carriage in ge- 
neral ; to fhew which, a general view of the expence and 
profit is given in the appendix. 

No manure is fuperior to the clay or mud collected in 
the bottom of rivulets and burns. Many of thefe run thro' 
this parifli ; and, were the farmers only at the pains to fpread 
the fcourings of thefe burns on their fields, they would find 
more benefit from it than even lime. It enlarges the flock 
of fertile earth, and mellows the foil. Yet few farmers 
think of this. Prejudice and cuftom rule every action of 
our lives ; and even thofe who have tafte and judgment to 
make experiments, are driven by the multitude into the 
practice of what is common. A little time, however, will 
ripen every improvement, and bring it to perfection. 

Drying.Kilns.^r^zrmg corns for the mill is an impor- 
tant article. Not long ago, the common praftice in tins 
parifh was for each farmer to have a kiln of his own. The 

market 



Statiftical Account 



market was therefore filled with bad meal, loft in the dry- 
ing, from the infufficiency of thefe rickles of buildings to 
perform the work. Befides, there were many melancholy 
accidents from fire. Thefe, and fome other caufes, have 
now made way for the introduction of brick kilns, which 
have become general. 

It would be a capital improvement to erect a kiln at eve- 
ry corn-mill, to be attended by an experienced dryfter, hi- 
red by the thirled farmers. The kiln might be fo placed that 
the grain could be conveyed from the kiln-head to the mill- 
happer, by having both on a level, and a loft from the kiln- 
head to the happer. Obferve the profit of fuch a plan. In 
the common way, the corn has to be put into facks, loaded, 
and carried to the mill; there unloaded, and carried up a 
flair, by ftrength of arm and back alone, All this labour 
would be faved by the plan above mentioned, befides ha- 
ving the corn immediately grinded when ready. 

Major Main of Powis Logie, an ingenious gentleman, and 
one of the moll eminent improvers of the country, has fa- 
voured me with a defcription of a drying-kiln of his own 
invention, erected at Ppwis, which is given in the appen- 
dix. 

Mills, and Sale of Grain. — The Deanfton cotton- mills 
will be mentioned under a feparate title. 

There are feven mills in the parifh for the manufacturing 
of grain, viz. Doune, Cambus, Candy, Lanerick, Cefiintub- 
ly, Auchlefhie, and Argaty, and there is an old corn-mill 
at Callichat, which has not been ufed for fome time. 

There is no object requires greater attention than the 
eftablifliment of proper corn-mills, becaufe here all the la- 
bour of the year centers. Yet no branch of police is more 
p-egle&amp;ed than proper rules between millers and farmers.

The evil arofe from the abominable fervitude of thirlage, 
and will continue fo long as this fervitude lafts. The land- 
lord binds his tenants to go to his own mill, and this mill 
he lets for rent, fuppofing, by this plan, to increafe his ren- 
tal. There never was a greater deception. The multure 
due to the mill is clafled with public burdens, and fo leflens 
the neat rent paid to the mafter; but were the tenant free, 
he would give a rife-rent double the amount of the rent 
drawn by the landlord of the mill. The reafon is obvious : 
being bound to one mill, the multurer grows infolent, gives 
bad fervice, and impofes on the tenants. Hence the multi- 
tude of law-fuits for abftracTied multures. Why am I well 
ferved by my tailor and Ihoemaker ? — Becaufe he is afraid of 
loling my cuftom. The fame is the cafe with millers ; and 
the fervitude of thirlage is faft wearing out. 

The common public places for the fale of grain are Stir- 
ling, Kippen, and Callander. Since the ereftion of the A- 
delphi cotton-mills, a considerable market has been opened 
in Doune. The average diftance to markets may be rec- 
koned 8 miles. An account of the fiars of Perth and Stir- 
ling fhires is given, among the general tables, in the appen- 
dix. 



Wages.- — The wages for all kinds of work may be rec- 
koned good. A principal man-fervant, for farming work, 
gets at prefent from L. 10 to L I2 ; an inferior one from- 
L. 8 to L. 10 j a woman-fervant from L. 3 to L. 5, befides 
bed, board, and warning. The labourers, in time of har- 
veit, are of three clafFes ; the fir ft are hired for the whole 
time of harveft ; the men receive L. 2, the women L. 1, 4 s. 
each, with bed and board •, the fecond clafs are hired by the 
day, a man at 1 s. a woman at 9 d. with victuals ; the third 
clafs are paid by the hour, a man 2 d. a woman ji-d. This

lad clafs are commonly the inhabitants of Doune, Buchany, 
and Burn of Cambus. 

An account of the various wages of other kinds of la- 
bour is given, among the general tables, in the appendix. 

Black-Cattle. — Owing to the want of inclofures, the black- 
cattle of this parifli make but a poor figure at the Doune 
markets. The whole cattle, including young and old, kept 
on the parifli are about 2243. Now, the whole area of the 
parifli being reckoned 64 fquare miles, or 40,960 acres, and 
fuppofing one-tenth to be heath and mofs producing no 
grafs, and another tenth to be occupied by roads, houfes, fen- 
ces, and ftrips of planting, there remains 32,768 acres ; one- 
third whereof (10,922) will be commonly in tillage, and 
the other two-thirds (21,845) remain for grafs. This grafs 
would be of various quality ; the beft might admit 1 cow 
on each acre, but other places might require 2, and perhaps 
3 acres to each cow. However, counting old and young 
beafts, 2 acres may be allowed on the average to each beafl. 
during fummer, whereby no lefs than 10,922 cattle might 
be iupported, were the grounds inclofed and fubdivided, 
and properly laid out. 

Of the cattle prefently on the parifli, one half are milch 

cows, the other half are young cattle. Now, valuing each 

cow's grafs at 20 s. and 10 s. for the feeding of each young 

beaft, we can draw the following comparative ftate :

Horfes. 



of Kilmadock or Bowie. 



19 



Horfes. The breed of horfes are much better now than 

formerly, though great room (till remains for improvement. 
Not long ago four-horfe ploughs were common over the 
parifh, each of which animals, though fcarce able to fupport 
their own weight, would eat as much as the horfes that now 
plough in pairs. 

The whole horfes at prefent in the paiiih are about 662, 
whereof about 577 are farm-horfes. Thefe laft will con- 
fume annually 4936 bolls and 1^ lippies of corn, allowing 
a lippy and a half to a horfe each day ; which, at 3 d. per 
lippy, comes to L. 3948 : 16 : ioi Sterling. So that when 
4 horfes were yoked in each plough, in place of 2, the num- 
ber would be double, and the expence L. 7897 : 13 : 9 Ster- 
ling. Were oxen ufed in place of horfes, the whole of the 
above corn would be faved, which would maintain 705 
men, allowing 7 bolls to each; and, taking the inhabitants 
of all ages, it would fupport double the number, being 
1410 perfons, which is one half of the prefent inhabitants 
of the parifh, which, at firft view, may furprife, but the cal- 
culation will hold good. 

If we reckon the inhabitants of the parifh of Kilmadock, 
exclufive of the people of the Adelphi, to be near 2800, 
and the horfes 570, there is about one horfe for every fifth 
foul, which is a ferious concern to the nation. In the pa- 
rifh of Kilmadock there are feveral farms with 4 horfes 
each, which, at L. 10 each horfe of maintenance, makes 
L. 40 each farm; and the average rent of each farm will 
not exceed L. 30. So if the heritor would recommend 
oxen in place of horfes, he might put the L. 40 in his poc- 
ket, and fave the expence of purchafing and upholding the 
horfes to his tenant, as oxen would live on grafs and turnip, 
and after 5 years labour would bring more money than their 
prime-coft.

Sheep. — There are no fheep in the pariih except about . 
1986, kept in the Braes of Doune, the moor of Lanerick, 
and in Cambufmore ; and even thefe do not thrive well. 
The grounds are better adapted for black-cattle than fheep. 

Markets, Price of Provifiom, ifc. — There are 6 annual 
fairs held in Doune, at the following terms, Martinmas, 
Yoole, Candlemas, Whitfunday, Lammas, and Michaelmas. 
The 2 at Michaelmas and Martinmas are large cattle mar- 
kets, little inferior to the famous tryfts of Falkirk. 

Provifions are cheaper here than at Stirling. Beef at 
44- d. butter 10 d. and cheefe at 3 d. per lb. and eggs at 4 d. 
per dozen ; while in Stirling market beef is at 5 d. butter 
1 s. and cheefe 4^ d. per lb. and eggs at 6 d. per dozen. 
Thefe articles rife and fall according to the feafons ; and the 
price of meal, barley, and others, is regulated by the price 
of grain, as dated in the annual fiars. 

Heritors and Kent. — The valued-rent of the whole parifh, 
as ftated in the cefs-books, is L. 9163, 14 s. Scots, and yet 
there are only 16 heritors, great and finall. The greateft 
heritor is the Earl of Moray, he being proprietor of about 
one-third of the whole parifh ; and the other heritors valu- 
ed-rent appears in a lift of the whole, ftated in the appen- 
dix. 

The real rent at prefent is about L. 7500 Sterling ; and 
a great number of the leafes being near expired, a confider- 
able rife will foon take place. The greateft advantage a 
parifh can enjoy, is to have all the heritors refiding on the 
fpot, becaufe, wherever thefe gentlemen take up their abode, 
there they fpend their money. 

The only refident heritors at prefent are, Murdoch of 
Gartincaber, Buchanan of Cambufmore, and Buchanan of 
Kirkton. The whole other heritors refide at a diftance,

band fo carry off annually very near fix-fevenths of the 
[ rents, very little whereof returns to the place. No won- 
kier, therefore, that the place is poor, wanting the prefence 
of the greateft heritors, and furniftiing fuch an immenfe 
bquantity of labour annually to ftrangers. 

Church, ifc The parilh church flood at Kilmadock till 

| the death of Mr Napier, about the year 1756, when a new 
[church was built in Doune. The firft incumbent of the 
[new church was Mr James Smith, a very meek and reve- 
Srend divine, who filled the paftoral charge for no lefs a pe- 
riod than 36 years, and then refigned it, with his life, amidft 
[the tears and forrow of his whole flock, among whom he 
Dived with that unity and mutual affection which alone con- 
stitutes the happinefs and profperity of any people. 

Though the church be removed to Doune, the moll of 
[the ancient families bury at Kilmadock, where the minifter 
[itill refides, with his manfe and glebe. The new fettlers 
[are, however, taking off layers at the new church-yard of 
Doune, and fo the burying-place at Kilmadock will foon be 
defer ted. 

There is a Burgher meeting-houfe at Bridge of Teith, 
[which was erected about 40 years ago. The affability o£ 
|Mr Smith kept the people together, fo much fo, that the 
whole parifhioners ftill adhere to the eftablifhment, except 
a few families who attend the congregation at Bridge of 
ITeith; and a few more who have joined the fociety of An- 
Itiburghers at Dunblane* 

There was formerly an Epifcopal meeting held in Doune, 
which was dropped on the death of Mr Rofe, the laft incum- 
bent. ,

tion, profecuted by the prefent minifter, the ftipend may, 
on an average, be reckoned L. 150 annually. The mini-. 
fler has alfo the manfe and glebe of Kilmadock, which con- 
tains fix acres of rich land, equal in quality to any within 
the pariih, as church-lands generally are. The manfe was 
lately repaired, and a very excellent fet of new office-houfes 
built by the heritors. 

Kilmadock manfe is a fituation exactly fuitable to religi- 
ons retirement, and is more centrical to the pariih in gene- 
ral than Doune, which (lands rather to the eaft fide. If the 
population increafe, a chapel of eafe, or a new erection will, 
be neceffary, when the church of Kilmadock may be re--; 
built, and the inhabitants thus well accommodated. 

Schools, i#c — The pariih fchool is held at Doune, and is 
generally well attended. Mr William Young, the prefent 
fchoolmafter, is a very indullrious teacher, and has kept the 
fchool with great fuccefs for a long period back. 

There are at prefent 70 fcholars, 45 at Englifli, 20 at . 
arithmetic and book-keeping, and only 5 at the Latin lan- 
guage. The fchool wages are extremely moderate, I s. 3 d*. 
for Englifli, and 2 s. 6 di for arithmetic, book-keeping, and I 
Latin, per quarter. The fchoolmafter has befides a freer 
houfe and garden, and his perquifites as ieffion-clerk and: 
precenter. His fixed falary was formerly only L. 100: 
Scots* but the heritors very properly augmented it to L. 2co 
Scots. The fees of proclamations, on 3 Sundays, are, 1 9.v 
8 d. to the poor, 2 s. to the clerk, and 6 d. to the officer ; 
on 2 Sundays, 2 s. to the clerk, 3 s. 6 d. to the poor, and 6 d. 
to the officer ; and on 1 Sunday, 6 s. to the clerk, ic s. 6 d. 
to the poor, and 1 s. 6 d. to the officer. There appears a4 
miftake in giving the clerk only 2 s. for 2 Sundays, when 
he gets the fame for 3. There are about 60 baptifms, anc 
24 marriages annually. The fees of baptifms are, 10 d. tc

the clerk, and 2 d. to the officer ; but thofe who attend 
Eridge of Teith, Noriefton, Dunblane, and Callander, from 
the parifh of Kilmadock, are not regular payers of the fees. 

There are feveral other private fchools in the parifh, for 
teaching Englifh and the rudiments of writing; but the 
boys in the country are in great danger of colds from bad 
roads. Foot-paths on the fides of the high-ways mould be- 
come general, which would be a great eafe to the children 
in bad weather. 

The Society for Propagating Chriftian Knowledge lately 
gave L. 10 of falary for a charity fchool at the weft end of 
the parifh, near Callander ; and Mr Buchanan of Cambuf- 
more, very much to his honour, prefented the fchoolmafter 
with a fchool and fchool-houfe, and garden, free. They 
are placed on the road from Callander to Craigton, about a 
Scotch mile eaft of Callander, on a gentle riling heath, that 
is quite dry and healthful, and finely expofed to the weftern 
breeze. There cannot be a finer lituation for a village ; 
and, were a proper road made along from Callander by the 
Heads, Craigton, Annat, &amp;c. to join the Dunblane road by 
Kilbryde, communication would be opened in the upper 
parts of the parifh, where, at prefent, no perfon can travel. 

Of all other objects of the legiflature, proper teachers, 
and proper parochial fchools, is the moft important ; and, 
with all refpecT: and deference to the office and dignity of 
our reverend divines, it is humbly fubmitted, if a diligent, 
fober, pious teacher of youth, be not an equally exalted cha- 
racter, and equal, if not more ufeful, towards the propaga- 
tion and eftablifhment of vital religion, morality, and vir- 
tue. The illuftrious King of Ifrael was deeply feniible of 
this, when he faid, 

Train up a child when he is young

And

And when he is old 

He will not depart from it. 

It is, therefore, much to the honour pf thofe who are at- 
tentive to the lituation of fchools. In general they are quite 
neglected ; the falaries of the mailers are Ihamefully fmall, 
and the fchool-wages too low. In place, therefore, of giving 
fuch liberal augmentations to the clergy, it had been more 
wife in the CommifTipners to have conferred part of it on 
the parochial teachers. 

Police. — Anciently the adminiftration of juftice was com- 
mitted to the Steward of Monteith, and his deputies, who 
held courts in Doune. In 1748 this heritable jurifdiction, 
along with the others within Scotland, was annexed to the 
Crown; and was valued at L. 1200 Sterling. Since this 
period the Sheriff of Perthlhire has held courts for this di- 
ftridt at Dunblane, which renders it very inconvenient for 
the inhabitants, that town being ntuated on the eaft fide of 
the diftridt. The Commiffary of Dunblane has likewife a 
jurifdiction over this parilh. Befides thefe two judges, the 
Jultices of the Peace take an active fhare in protecting the 
commonwealth. 

Poor. — There are no private donations, or hofpitals found- 
ed, for the poor of this parilh, neither have the heritors ever 
been affefied. They are, however, liberally fupported from 
the collections at the churches, and by private charity, and 
common begging is now almoft quite gone. 

The fituation of this parilh, with regard to the poor, is a 
llrong proof of the baneful confequence of overgrown hof- 
pitals. Innocent misfortunes are always mentioned as an 
argument^ in favour of hofpitals. It is no doubt an amiable 
virtue to relieve the dilheffes of a fuffering fellow-crea- 
ture but cafes- of this nature ought to be thrown on pri- 
vate 



of Kilmadock or Dome. 



vate charity alone, which ufually exerts itfelf in a moft ef- 
fectual manner •, and the common poor mould be provided 
by the public. It is an important matter to make charity 
command gratitude and induftry. Private charity effects 
this moft completely : The indigent perfpn knows that the 
eyes of the donor is upon him, and that if he is idle and in- 
folent the donation will be withdrawn. Hence, gratitude 
excites his induftry, and fear commands his refpeft. But, 
when a fet of gentle beggars are put on the roll of hofpital 
penfioners, they conceive themfelves only obliged to the 
public, that is, nobody. The funds, they fay, are their 
own, and they have none to thank. Hence, they forget 
their true fituation, and become ungrateful, infolent, and 
lazy. 

Let the parilh of Kilmadock rejoice that me is free of 
fuch nuifances ; let her cultivate fobriety, induftry, and vir- 
tue, and, while profperity fmiles on her borders, affluence 
will garnifh her table, and contentment gladen her heart. 

ManufqBures and Commerce,— This parifti may be faid 
Jo be wholly deftitute of any commercial traffic or regular 
manufacture, except the Adelphi cotton-work. A lift of 
the different tradefmen is given under the title population. 

For fome time paft Doune has been noted for excellent 
flaters, who have acquired fuperior reputation in that trade 
over all the neighbouring country, particularly Glafgow, 
Hamilton, Dunbarton, &amp;c. where they have been invited 
to contract for all kinds of modern buildings, in preference 
to the flaters of other places. They work in thefe towns 
during fummer, and return to their families during winter ; 
and fome of the more induftrious among them learn other 
trades, fuch as weaving, Ihoemaking, &amp;c. which they prac- 
Jife when the feafon will not permit the work of flating. 

The, 



Statijlical Account 



The fkinning bufinefs was once carried on in Doune, but 
it is now quite gone. 

In this town alfo was carried on, for fome time, the ma- 
nufacture of Highland purfes. That trade is alfo no more. 

The only remains of any of the ancient branches of trade 
is the making of Highland piftols. The reputation of 
Doune for this manufacture, about the time of the German 
war, was very great. 

This art was introduced to Doune about the year 1646, 
by Thomas Caddell, who, having been inftructed in his 
craft at Muthill, a village in Strathearn in Perthlhire, came 
and fettled in Doune. This famous tradefman poffefled a 
moft profound genius, and an inquilitive mind; and, though 
a man of no education, and remote from every mean of in- 
flruclion in the mechanical arts, his ftudy and perfevenng 
exertions brought his work to fo high a degree of perfec- 
tion, that no piftols made in Britain excelled, or perhaps 
equalled, thofe of his making, either for furenefs, ftrength, 
or beauty. He taught the trade to his children, and feve- 
ral apprentices, of whom was one John Campbell, whofe 
fon and grandfon carried on the bufinefs fucceffively with; 
great repute. While the ancient drefs of Caledouia, that 
is, the philabeg, belted plaid, piftols, and dirk, was wore, 
the piftols made in Doune excelled all others, and acquired 
fuperior reputation over France, Germany, &amp;c. A pair of 
piftols, fuperbly ornamented, were fabricated by a tradef- 
man taught in Doune, and, by the City of Glafgow, given 
in compliment to Marquis deBouille. The above Mr Camp- 
bell's grandfon, who has now given over the bufinefs, made 
piftols to the firft nobility in Europe, as Prince Ferdinand 
of Brunfwick, the Hereditary Prince of Brunfwick, the 
Duke of Cumberland, and others. The trade is now car- 
ried on by John Murdoch, alfo famous for his ingenuity ia 
the craft, and who has likewife furnifhed piftols to the firft 

nobilitj

nobility of Europe. Thefe piftols were fold from 4 to 24 
guineas a-pair. There is now very little demand for 
Doune piftols, owing, partly, to the low price of the piftols 
made in England ; but the chief caufe of the decline is the 
difufe of the dirk and piftol as a part of the Caledonian 
drefis ; and, when Mr Murdoch gives over bufinefs, the trade, 
in all probability, will become extinft. 

Adelphi Cotton-works.— -Thefe are very extenfive works, 
erected on the fouth banks of Teith, to the weft of Doune, 
for the fpinning of cotton-yarn. The great wheel is moved 
by the water of Teith. The mill is a large elegant building 
of feveral ftories, ere&amp;ed about 12 years ago by Mr John Bu- 
chanan of Carfton and his brothers, gentlemen of much en- 
terprife, who having removed to another work at Balfron, 
feveral years ago, the Adelphi mill was taken up by an 
Englifh company, and is now conducted by Mr Benjamin 
Flounders, a gentleman of exemplary character, and much 
efteemed in the place. 

This extenfive work has conftantly employed about 700 
perfons, for whofe accommodation all the ruinous houfes in 
Doune have been repaired and«rebuilt ; and Mr Murdoch of 
Gartincaber has built a ftxeet of houfes on the fouth fide of 
the Teith, with a convenient garden to each, now called the 
Newtown of Doune. 

The workmen are paid by the quantity and quality of 
their work, and hence they have become extremely dexte- 
rous, and fome hands will make about 2 guineas per week. 

The yarn fpun at this mill is efteemed very excellent, 
and finds a ready market every where. There is none of 
it weaved in Doune or the neighbourhood. 

The high wages earned at this work has affected almoft 
every other branch of bufinefs in the parifh ; and, for a 
while after it was commenced, the confequence was very 

diftrefling.

diureffing. So many people colkaed in one houfe refined 
each other in all manner of wickednefs. The duties of 
the family were neglefted ; the Sabbath was profaned ; the 
inftruction of youth was forgotten 5 and a loofenefs and 
corruption of manners fpread, like a fatal contagion, every 
where around. The alurement of high wages at this work 
raifed the price of all other kinds of labour ; and, what was 
worft of all, fervants became infolent,difobedient,and carelefs. 
The confinement of fo many people in one houfe rendered 
the air they breathed very impure ; the heat neceffary in 
preparing the cotton kept the workmen conftantly in a 
fweat, and extracted the nourifhing juices ; the noife of the 
machinery rendered them foon deaf ; and the flying parti^ 
cles of cotton, and conftant labour of the eye in watching 
the texture of the threads, weakened and deftroyed the 
light. 

The laudable condudr. of Mr Flounders, and the other 
managers of the work, has, however, wrought a very great 
reformation of thefe abufes, and in a great meafure provi- 
ded remedies to the evils mentioned above. The work- 
men are now fober and refpedtable, and the children are 
watched with vigilance and oare. 

The illuftrious Mr Dale of Glafgow, in his attention to 
the government of young perfons at his works, is a noble 
example to others. He employs a teacher, who overfees 
them at all times of the day, and, at certain hours, inftru&amp;s 
them in the principles of religion, and teaches them read- 
ing, writing, arithmetic, &amp;x. He prefides over them at 
table, and performs the office of chaplain ; the boys lit on 
one fide of the table, the girls on the other : and in this or- 
der he conduces them to church. Laws and rules are fra- 
med for their government, and rewards and punilhments 
annexed. In fine, this gentleman may be called the bene- 
volent

Pojl-office and Carriers.— There was lately eftabliftied a 
poft-office in Doune and Callander, with a runner between 
thefe towns and Dunblane every Sunday, Tuefday, and 
Friday, which is of great ufe. 

There is alfo a weekly carrier from Doune to Stirling, 
another to Callander, another to Dunblane, and fometimes 
one to Kippen. 

Antiquities. — The Caftle of Doune is the molt eminent 
antiquity in this diflridt. 

The ancient monaftery of St Madocus, now called Kil- 
madock, where the late church flood, is quite demoiiftied, 
and perhaps was pulled down to build the church. To this 
monaftery belonged fix chapels within the parifh. 

The firft flood on the fouth banks of Teith, at the end 
of the bridge, where part of the building is flill to be feen. 
The adjoining lands, now the property of Mr John Forreft, 
were annexed to this chapel, and hence received the name 
Dean's-town. 

The fecond flood on the fouth-eaft of the houfe of Row, 
alfo clofe by the north fide of Teith, part of the foundation 
whereof is ft ill vifible. 

The third chapel ftood on the weft brink of the glen of 
Annat, on a round hill, which flill retains the name cf the 
Kirk-hill, and the marks of graves are ftill vifible. The 
name Annat has its origin from this chapel; Ann or Annat 
meaning the firft fruits of every benefice; and the lands of 
Annat were perhaps at that time annexed to the chapel. 

The fourth was at Lanerick, and the remains of the 
building has been for a long period ufed as a burying-place

for the family of Lanerick. The chapel likewife ftands on 
the fouth banks of Teith. 

The fifth was on the banks of the fame river, at Torry, 
oppofite to Cambufmore, and the place is now covered with 
wood. 

The fixth was eredted at Walton, a little eaft of Thorn- 
hill. This laft is quite demoliflied, and not even the foun- 
dation to be feen. 

Some years ago feveral graves were difcovered below 
Rofshall houfe, in the eftate of Cambufwallace, which were 
inclofed with 4 ftones each, in the form of the ancient 
tombs of Caledonia, but no bones remained ; from which 
it is evident thefe graves are very ancient. It is remark- 
able, that, before thefe graves were difcovered, there was a 
tradition among the people of the place, that a battle was 
once fought near this fpot between the families of Rofshall 
and Craigton, and that feveral men were killed in the fray. 
The tombs difcovered were perhaps the graves of thefe 
chieftains. 

Natural Curiofities, — In former times, it appears, the MB 
ver Teith made a beautiful winding from Doune Caftle 
round the hill of Dairah ; but, having forced a way through 
to the river Ardoch, below the Caftle, deferted iis former 
channel, and the old track is now dry, and moftly covered 
with planting. It is this old water-track that forms the moil 
delightful part of Blair-Drummond policy. Tradition fays, 
that the Caftle of Doune was built from a quarry below 
the mound, and that the neck of land was thus cut away* 
whereby the river got through by its prefent courfe. This, 
account has very ftrong marks of probability, though we 
cannot vouch for its being certain. 

In the banks of the water of Goody feveraj oak trees 
project from the braes, about 20 feet below the furface of

the clay ; and, where this river joins Forth, one of thefe 
trees, covered with the fame depth of clay, projects near 
20 feet, and the trunk is near 6 feet diameter. Several 
fhells have likewife been turned up from the clay in this 
carfe. 

Mofs Flenders (part of which belongs to this parifti) 
abounds with natural curiofities. Some years ago feveral 
logs were found in the mofs, fquared, and lying along each 
other in the form of a float, and the marks of the ax was 
vifible on them. Here alfo was found a piece of a ftiip. 
A Roman caufeway has alfo been difcovered along the bot- 
tom of the mofs, running in a direction of fouth-eaft to 
north-weft ; but thefe particulars belong more properly to 
the account of the parifti of Kincardine. 

Advantages. — From the preceding obfervations it is evi- 
dent, that the parifti of Kilmadock has many advantages. 
1. It lies in the centre of Scotland, and has intercourfe with 
all the kingdom. 2. The two great roads pafs through it. 
3. It contains an excellent foil, affording fcope for all man- 
ner of agricultural ftudy and refearch. 4. The climate is 
healthful, mild, and friendly to cultivation. 5. It is expo- 
fed to the fun, and defended by mountains on the north and 
north-weft, and there is eafy accefs to all parts of the 
grounds. 6. It abounds with natural fprings, rivers, and. 
burns, and contains very fine lituations for cattle in time of 
ftorms. It enjoys the waters of the Teith for a fpace of 10 
miles, where multitudes of water machines can be erected, 
and hence is well adapted for commerce and manufactures. 
Above all, it commands a grand view of hill and dale, of 
mountains and vallies ; it has ample provifion for its poor, 
and is free of hofpitals and all fuch mortifications / it enjoys 
peace and contentment, and is not rent afraid er by civil or 
religious contefts. 

Difadvantages.

Hi/advantages. — It is alfo plain this pariih has many dif. 
advantages, i. It wants coal and lime. 2. It wants good 
roads and bridges. 3. The grounds, in many places, are too 
wet. 4. There are no plantations. 5. There are few in- 
clofures. 6. The tenants have bad houfes. 7. The whole 
parifh is fubjecled to the grievous bondage of thirlage. 

Propofed Improvements-Such being the advantages and ; 
difadvantages of this diftrict, the remedies become very ob- 
vious. Communication ought to be opened by new roads 
and bridges, and the old roads and bridges repaired. Coal 
and lime mould be brought from Stirling, &amp;c. by navigable 
canals. The wet grounds mould be drained and made dry. 
The barren ground and wafte places Ihould be filled with 
planting. The open grounds fhould be inclofed. 

The people would then be roufed to activity ; agricul- 
ture would fwell the fields with grains ; the cattle thrive and 
become numerous ; manufactures flourilh and profper ; arts 
and fciences polifh and refine ; the people become a multi- 
tude ; and religion, morality, and virtue, lock fociety fecure 
in the arms of affe&amp;ion and love.

(County of Orkney and Zetland, Presbytery of

<p>Ncune. 

^T^HIS miniftry is compofed of the united parifhes of 
Walls, Sandnefs, Papaftour, and Fowla. The origin 
and meaning of thefe names are more conjectural than cer- 
tain. They are fuppofed to belong to the Norfe, the ori- 
ginal language of the country. It is believed by fome au- 
thors, that the names of places ending with the fyllable 
wall, were places where courts of jultice were anciently 
held, fome of which might have been in this pariih. San- 
uefs, or Sandnefs, has probably its origin, from the lituation 
of the diftrict fo called, and from the nature of the foil. It 
is fituated in a nefs or headland, almoft furrounded by the 
fea -, and the foil is light and fandy. Stout; which ngniiies 
great, is annexed to Papa, to diftinguiQi it from other iilands

of this country, of the fame name, as being much larger 
than any of the reft. Fowla may have had its name from 
the very great number of fowls which frequented that 
ifland. But, as the names of places are chiefly of Danifh or 
Norwegian extraction, it is more likely that this ifland had 
its name from thence, and may have been anciently writ- 
ten Fule, a corruption of Tbule. That this ifland is the Ul- 
tima 'Ihule of the ancients, concerning which various con- 
jectures have been formed, is pretty evident, not only from 
the analogy of the name, but alfo a more undoubted tefti- 
mony. Speaking of Agricola the Roman general, when in 
Britain, regarding his victories, and the diftance to which he 
penetrated towards the north, Tacitus has thefe words, " in- 
" venit domuitque Infulas quas vocant Orcades, defpecta- 
" que Thule." Now, Fule, or Thule, which is lofty, is ea- 
fily feen, in a ferene day, from the north part of Orkney. 

Situation. — Thefe united pari flies are fituated in the (lew- 
artry of Orkney and Zetland, and in the prelbytery of the 
latter, which is compofed of 12 members, and whofe pro- 
ceedings are alone cognifable by the General Aflembly. 
Walls and Sandnefs lie on the moft weftern part of the 
mainland, and exhibit a triangular form, having the parifli 
of Aithfting and Sanfting on the fouth-eaft and eaft, as the 
bafe, and furrounded with the ocean on the other fides. 
There is a voe, or inlet, called Gruting Voe, 4 miles deep, 
which feparates Walls from Sandnefs, and poflefies a deep 
and fafe anchorage. Thefe pariflies of Walls and Sandnefs 
are in length 7 Scotch miles, and 6 in breadth. They are 
much interfered with voes. The furface of the ground in 
Walls is diverfified with fmall eminences. Papa is 2 miles 
in length, fomewhat more than 1 in breadth, and lies at 1 
mile's diftance from the mainland. It is flat, and extreme- 
ly agreeable in fummer. When the feafon is mild, it pro- 
duces 



of Walls and Sand nefs. 99 



duces very rich crops of bear, oats, and potatoes. Being 
partly fandy, it agrees beft with fea-weed for manure, the 
want of which has frequently reduced the place to fcarcity ; 
though in plentiful years it can afford a confiderable fuppy 
to other parifhes. The grafs it produces is remarkably 
rich. It labours, however, under two great difadvantages, 
the fcatald, or common, is very fmall, and the fuel is nei- 
ther good nor plenty; It has feveral fmall voes, which 
ferve as fecure harbours for fifhing (loops during fummer. 
Thefe floops, when the weather is favourable, leave the land 
on Monday, and Hay at fea upon the fifhing bank till Satur- 
day, when they put a-fhore the fifties they have caught. 
Each floop has generally 4 fix-oared boats that accompany 
it. They go to a very great diflance from the land. Here 
the Northumberland Company, for the Improvement and 
Extenfion of Fifheries, have had for fome years pad 3 or 4 
veffels ftationed for the catching of cod, tufk, and ling; but 
as their exertions were accompanied with greater expence 
than the Shetland fifhing, they feem to be giving it up. 
They have been equally unfuccefsful in their attempts upon 
the coaft for the lobfter fifhing. There are fome beaches in 
this ifland, in which the fifh are cured ; and convenient 
houfes have been lately erected by the proprietor, and let 
annually at a moderate rent. — Fowla is 3 miles in length, 
and 1 4- in breadth. It is fituated at the diflance of 18 miles 
from the neareft land. This ifland is very bold and fteep 
on the welt fide. The inhabitants are remarkable for be- 
ing active and alert rowers. There is only one landing 
place, called Ham ; it lies on the eaft fide, and is generally, 
during fummer, occupied by 16 fifhing boats, 11 of which 
belong to Walls. This ifland is inhabited by 26 families, 
who, although there is not fufficient land for fupporting 
them with provifions, yet, they are fo attached to the place, 
that they are unwilling to leave it ; rather choofing to put

up with its many inconveniences than to emigrate. The 
ifland has excellent and extenlive pafturage for fheep and 
cattle. Some of the inhabitants are very expert in catch- 
ing wild fowls in the rocks, for the fake of their feathers, 
which are fold at a confiderable price. This induces them 
to go to places almoft inacceflible ; and by which attempts 
fome have loft their lives. 

Soil, Climate, Difeafes. — Throughout the whole miniftry, 
the foil is rather thin and fharp ; and, being moftly cultiva- 
ted with the fpade, makes, in general, very good returns. 
In the inland parts of the parilhes a deep mofe prevails, and 
a fhort heath, affording pafturage for fheep and horfes, of 
which the latter go wild. The ground, towards the fea, is 
hard and verdant, and hither the fheep repair in the incle- 
mency of winter, as the banks are not fo deeply covered 
with ihow as in the interior of the country ; and they a- 
bound with fea-wreck, which, in a fevere ftorm, proves an 
agreeable moriel to the fheep. — This place, from its being 
much environed by the fea, pofleffes a moift air, which very 
foon corrodes iron ; but, being impregnated confiderably 
with faline particles, is not unhealthy. Here there are no 
pomplaints of the ague, which is not the cafe in dittricts a- 
bounding with fens and bogs, at a diftance from the fea. , 
Fogs are frequent in the months of July and Augult, but 
have no malignant influence. — The difeafes moft prevalent: 
are rhcumatifms and fevers, fuppofed to originate chiefly ' 
from heats and colds. Confiimptions frequently occur, and. 
are believed to arife from the fame caufe. Some of thele, . 
and other difeafes, may perhaps be more malignant, owing, 
to the difficulty and expence of procuring medical aid. Fe- 
vers, thereby, are more inveterate, and are very contagious. , 
Jn the ifland of Papa leprofy was very frequent in former i 
times ; and fo alarming was it, that collections were made 

in 



IV alls and Sand/icfs.

in feveral parts of the country for the fupport and cure of 
the numerous perfons affedted with it. The common belief 
is, that it was produced in confequence of the people having 
eaten too great a quantity of fifli, not properly prepared, 
i'ome wet feafons fucceeding, which kept the peats (their 
only fuel) from being fully dried. The lepers were kept 
in imall huts, erected on purpofe, apart from places inhabi- 
ted. Fuel and victuals were carried to the doors of their 
miferable hovels, and the perfons employed in this chari- 
table office avoided all intercourfe with them. Thus left to 
themfelves, and poorly fheltered, it is to be prefumed, that 
many became vidtims to this fhocking diftemper. Some 
perfons would, perhaps, be doomed to this folitary and 
wretched exigence, upon being feized with cutaneous dif- 
orders, which, with a little afliftance, might have been eafi- 
ly removed ; but which ignorance, and fear of infedtion 
united, might have judged proper to be thus feparated. Shut 
out from fociety, fequeftered from their friends, what a joy- 
fefs life mud they have dragged out ? Humanity, at the re- 
colledtion of this, drops a tear. Few inftances of this trouble 
have appeared within thefe laft 50 year?;. The feffion records 
mention, that a day of public thankfgiving was obferved in 
the miniftry, in the year 1742, when this difeafe was almoft 
extinguifhed. The fmall-pox have feldom vifited thefe pa- 
rishes, but at times have made' terrible havock. At the be- 
ginning of this century, the mortal-pock, as it is called, cau- 
fed great devaluation, carrying off whole families. In the 
ifland of Fowla, which contained a number of families, on- 
ly a few perfons were left, to perform the laft office of hu- 
manity to their brethren. Being averfe to inoculation, a 
very great number of aged perfons have never had the fmall- 
pox. The young people avoid infection, in the natural 
way, as mnch as they can ; and are not much inclined to 
inoculation, left they communicate the contagion to their 

friends

friends in advanced life. By this means the evil is eonti. 
nued. Many, however, lately fubmitted to this falutary 
operation, and only a few died. 

Lakes, and Sea-coajl. — There are a great many lakes 
throughout the miniftry, but none fo confiderable a3 to me. 
rit defcription. They are only ferviceable as refer voirg 
for the rain which defcends from the adjoining hills, affording 
water for fmall mills, erefted on them for grinding corn. 
Some eels and trout are found in them. Thefe fheets of 
water are hurtful to fheep, in time of deep fnow and froft, as 
they fometimes go upon them when frozen, to reach green 
holms, or fmall illands, in the middle ; and, when the thaw 
fucceeds, they are prevented from reaching their ordinary 
pafture. — From the almoft infular fituation of the miniftry, 
the fea-coaft muft be very extenfive ; but cannot eaftly be 
afcertained. A good chart of the coaft, and bearings, is 
laid down by a Captain Prefton. Not much kelp is made 
on thefe coafts. 

Fijh. — Various kinds of fifti are caught on the coaft, 
as ling, cod, mackerel, haddocks, hoes, or dog-fifti, fkate, 
pillocks, and fillichs, and fometimes herrings. Thefe laft 
are fluctuating and uncertain ; but are excellent in their 
kind, and, when well cured, fetch a higher price at market 
than thofe caught on the coaft of Scotland. Ling is the 
principal fifti caught here. They are Allied on a bank from 
30 to 60 miles diftant from the fhore. This bank is called 
the Haaff. To this miniftry belong 42 fix-oared boats, and 
16 of four oars each. The large, or fix oared boats, carry 
each 6 men ; and the fmall carry 3 or 4 men, who are ei- 
ther too young, or too old, for being er.-. ployed in the lar- 
ger fiftiing. The Haaff fifhing begins ab, ul the firft of June, 
and lafts till Lammas, when the night becomes too long for

Tides and Creefo. ~-The tides are very rapid on the coaftj 
and in Papa Sound the current is fo ftrong, that a boat, in 
crofiing, mud make a large curve, to prevent being carried 
eut of its courfe. In this Sound the Baas of Hogfetter, 
which are funk rocks, will often rife fuddenly, even when 
the fea is fmooth around ; and were they not carefully a- 
voided, would overwhelm any boat. Nay, it would be 

dangerous

dangerous for larger veffels to approach them too near. 
They lie on the eaft fide of the entrance of the Sound, from 
the fouth. The middle of the channel is perfectly fafe. 
There is a perpendicular rock that ftands in the fea, a little 
out from the ifland of Papa, very difficult of accefs, on which 
are the remains of a houfe, faid to have been built by a gen- 
tleman of property, when about to leave the country, with 
a view to fecure his daughter, who was in love with one in- 
ferior to her in ftation. But Cupid, defcending in a golden 
fliower, found admiflion, by bribing her guardians. — The 
chief creek is Vaila- Sound, in Walls, and has its name from 
an ifland fo called, lying at the entrance ; but may, more 
properly, be denominated a voe, as it runs about a mile 
within land. On this ifland John Scott, Efq; of Melbie, the 
principal heritor of the parifh, refutes. It is about a mile 
in length each way. 

Minerals. — Lime-ftone, free-ftone, and flate, are found in 
Sandnefs; but are of an inferior quality. Slates from Eif- 
dale have of late been ufed. 

Fowls. — Swans and wild geefe are feen in the fpring, pal- 
fing to the northward, in great numbers. They reft, for 
fome time, upon the fheets of water in the miniftry, and go, 
as is fuppofed, to Iceland, where they hatch, during the rum- 
mer ; and return in the autumn. Sea fowls are various and 
plentiful. 

Cave. — There is a large natural cave in the ifland of Pa- 
pa, and has three entrances, through which the fea ebbs and 
flows. It is fo wide as to allow a large boat to enter with 
the oars at full length on each fide ; and becomes gradually 
larger as one advances towards the centre, where it is beau, 
tifully arched. The direction being crooked, it is dark in

the middle, a circumftance which feldom fails to (hike with 
awe the mind of the beholder. The leaft noiie i loeafes 
the folemn impreffion. It divides into feveral apartments. 
Beyond the centre, there is a fmall aperture in the top, that 
admits a feeble light, for the direction of the boat. 

Population. — There is no account on record, within the 
parifh, of the number of inhabitants in a former period ; but, 
in a printed account, anno 1774, of the Society for Propa- 
gating Chriftian Knowledge, there is a Itatement of the po- 
pulation in the refpective parifhes, which, if it is accurate, 
Ihews the numbers to be increafed. Walls contained 756

In the lift of burials, might have been included 5 perfon 
that were drowned at fea. There are about 6 perfons at an 
average to a family. 

The parochial regifter, previous to the year 1788, was 
very inaccurately kept. Numbers of private baptifms were 
not inrolled, nor burials marked. 

The increafed population, within thefe 20 years pad, may 
be owing to the farms, originally fmall, being frequently 
fubdivided. A young man, inclining to marry, and being 
accuflomed to go to fea, his matter furnimes him with a rc 7 
fidence, by dividing a former tack. This place, and, indeed,, 
the country at large, is by far too populous, by which means; 
the inhabitants are kept poor ; there being no manufacture*: 
eftablifhed. One reafon why few young men remain uiu: 
married, is, becaufe, if not married, they are fure to be fixed, 
upon, by the landmauers, for the fervice of the navy, whenr 
a draft for that fervice is required from the country; and rav 
ther than be forced from their native foil, and ihe fociety of- 
their friends, they will fubmit to many inconvenienceSt- 
Many of the young men, however, lately inlifted for the navy r 
being inducedby the profpe.ct of obtaining prize-money, when: 
fighting againft the Spaniards, in the view of a war refpecVr 
jng Nootka Sound. Such as have at any time revinted 
their native country, bring with them a tafte for finery,? 
vvhich they introduce among their young acquaintance, by 
no means confident with their narrow circumftances. Many} 
of the young women, in the character of fervams, go to LA 
don, Edinburgh, &amp;c. in the Greenland fhips. 

Agriculture. — In plentiful feafons, there is as much cor 
raifed as fupplies the inhabitants, and they are enabled to af- 
ford fome affiftance to other lefs plentiful parifhes. Bear 
equally good with any in the north of Scotland, is raifed mi 
Sandnef?, and Papa. Oats are fown about the middle of

March, and bear in the end of April. Harveft in the be- 
ginning or middle of September. — Cabbages are produced 
in great plenty, and form a great part of the winter food 
of the lower people. They are confidered as a good cor- 
rective of fcorbutic habits. Kitchen-fluffs grow to great per- 
fection •, but, from being too near the fea, ihrubbery will not 
thrive. — A great number 0* horfes are reared ; but as the 
inhabitants, at lean: in Walls, do not in general employ them 
in drudgery- work, as in other parifhes, they are allowed to 
fun wild in the common. They are fo hardy, that they re- 
ceive no maintenance from the owners, even in the winter 
feafon. They live to a great age, when domefticated. 
They are fold in great numbers every year to Orkney- 
men, who come to this parilli, and other places in the coun- 
try, with quantities of linen, which finds a ready market. 
The horfes are fmall, as the people always imprudently 
fell the mod likely young ones, and do not preferve pro- 
per breeders, by which means the breed is much diminifh- 
ed in fize. Vaf.t numbers of fvvine are alfo produced ; but, 
as they go wild in the common during the fummer feafon, 
ihey are very injurious to the pafturage, by rooting and 
digging it up. They are often alfo hurtful, by feizing up- 
on young lambs, and eating them. But, owing to a com- 
plaint, lately lodged againft them, their number is greatly 
diminillied.— The meep were lately numbered by the tackf- 
man of the teinds, and were found to amount to about 
8000. 

Imports and Exports. — Houfehold-ftores, for thofe of bet- 
ter ftationS, are imported from Leith and Hamburgh : and 
fait, deals, boats, fifhing-lines, hooks and meal, are import- 
ed for the ufe of the feamen. The exports are the fame as 
in other parts of the country, fuch as ling, cod, tufk, oil, 

herrings 



IoS Statijlical Account 

herrings, butter, beef and hides : all of which, except the 
ling, are fent to Leitli. Formerly Dutch and Hamburgh 
merchants traded to this country, and carried off the pro- 
dufts, bringing fuch neceffaries as the people needed. 

Heritors, Rent. — There are twelve heritors, but feven of 
them hold very inconfiderable property. They all refide 
in the miniftry, except three. — The rent of the parifli cannot 
eafily be afcertwined; becaufe the tenants are obliged to fifh 
to their land matters, at a ftipulated low price, befides pay-* 
ing a fmall rent for the land they poflefs. No valuation 
has ever taken place in the country. The fifhing- farmer, i 
as he may be called, has his lands for about 5 s. or 6 s. 9,\ 
merk ; but being obliged to fifh to his landlord, and recei- 
ving from him a lower price for his fifti and oil than he 
could otherwife obtain, the proprietor thereby increafes his 
rent confiderably. But the quantity of produ&amp;s annually - 
being cafual, makes it ftill more difficult to eftablifh the 
juft rent. 

Church. — The living of the minifter is cafual, depend- 
ing annually on the Mate of the tithable fubjefts : but the : 
teinds have been let for L. 66 Sterling, including 7 merks I 
of glebe-land, which lies at a diftance from the manfe. . 
The half of the corn-teind of Papa, paid in ipfa corpora, . 
retained in the incumbent's own hand, and valued at L. 6 1 
Sterling, forms part of the ftipend. In all, it amounts to l 
L. 72 Sterling per annum. There is a procefs of augmen- • 
tation now (1797) pending before the Court of Seffion, 
for thefe nine years paft, and it is fuppofed will be de- • 
termined fooo. The vacant tithes, from which the aug- 
mentation will arife, are about L. 20 Sterling. The

■Poor. — There are a good many poor in the miniftry, who 
leive affiftance from the poor-funds, and who are ftationed 
■the fame time in their feveral diftricts, a certain number 
■families being affigned them for their maintenance. They

* 10 Statljlical Account 

Schools. — In the ifland of Papa there is a mortiflcatit 
of three merks of land, by a pioufly difpofed perfon, ft 
the purpofe of benefiting a reader in the church, who ci 
techifes the people there ; reads a religious book, on th 
Lord's day •, fings and prays, when the minifter cannot a 
tend for public Worlhip. — There is a parochial fchool eft 
blifhed in Walls, and the Rev. Mr Buchan modified 40s. p 
arm. befides the legal falary (L. 10 Sterl.) In the ifland 
Fowla there is a charity-fchool, with a very fmaH falary, 1 
only L. 3 Sterl. per aim. — Several itinerant preachers wen 
fettled in this and fome neighbouring iflands, who officiate 
a part of the year in each. Thefe iflands, Iving at the dii 
tance of feven or eight leagues from their refpe&amp;ive min 
ftries, were frequently deprived of the ftated ordinances  
worfhip. But, by rending a great part of the year amoijl 
the people, thefe itinerants were of much advantage t 
them. It is a long time fince they were withdrawn, an; 
the people have of courfe much degenerated in their moral 
and Chriftian knowledge ; at leaft this is the cafe wit 
Fowla ; for the minifter has been accuftomed to go only one . 
a-year, in mid-fummer, to that ifland, where he ftays eight o 
ten days : during which time he frequently preaches, cat 
chifes the inhabitants, and baptifes their childern. But 
his minifterial labours among them, in fo fhort a time, c 
be of fmall advantage for their information, and for guidin 
them in the path of duty. Now that the fociety is put ii 
a capacity, from the late acqufition of their funds, for ex 
tending their beneficence and humane influence, it wouk 
furely be fulfilling their pious aims in an effectual manner 
were an itinerant again appointed to thefe iflands. The cha 
rity-fchoolmafter reads, during the year, to the inhabitants 
every Sabbath-day, in fome religious book, furnifhed by the 
minifter.— There was a charity-fchool erefted in Sandnefs : 



of Walls and Sandnefs. 



in 



L the year 174a, with a falary of L. 7 Sterling per annum, 
l-hich continued a Ihort time, when the then fchoolmafter re- 
igned his office. Upon this event, application was made 
[the Society for the fchool being continued, and a young 
Kan was fent from this country, to be examined for that 
Id. Although he did not give that full fatisfa&amp;ion ex- 
ited, yet he was not reje&amp;ed, but was remitted for fur- 
fcer improvement. This has been lince laid before the 
■ociety, accompanied with a Prefbyterial reprefentation, but 
io appointment has taken place, (1793), though the young 
Ban officiated as teacher for fome time after his return, in the 
lope of being preferred. — The minifter, on account of his 
laving more than one place of worfhip, cannot preach above 
Lee a month in Sandnefs, even although his tours fhould 
We regularly performed ; but, through the inclemency of 
Be weather in winter, and other unavoidable caufes, he 
Innot be there above eight or nine times in the year. To 
■pply this deficiency, and to engage the inhabitants in a 
litable manner on the Lord's day, the charity-fchoolmaf- 
r was wont to convene them in the church, read a fermon- 
Qok, and catechife them, as they were at the diftance of 
e miles from the church of Walls. Should the Society 
e gracioufly difpofed to grant a re-eftabliftiment, it would 
reatly contribute to the intereft of religion, and good mo- 
lls ; as the people are too poor to have fchools of their own 
•e&amp;ed, and are now paying their proportion to the legal 
:hoolmafter in Walls. Now (1797) are two charity-fchools 
1 Sandnefs and Papa, with a falary of L. 10 Sterling per 
nnum from the Society, proportioned between the two 
:hoolmafters.

one, ere&amp;ed on a fmall ifland or holm, fituated within a loci 
called Burgo Water, very regular for thofe rude times, an

as it is fomewhat under water. Unacquainted with the me- 
chanic arts, it is furprifing how the ancient people convey- 
ed together, and erected, fuch large ftones as compofe thefe 
rude fabrics. As thefe buildings are not all fimilar, either 
in bulk or lhape, it is probable they were ufed either as 
forts or places of ftrength ; places of obfervation, or watch- 
towers ; or places of worlhip. When large, having a double 
or triple wall around, as is the cafe of fome fuch buildings, 
they may be denominated fortreffes, or places of refidence, 
whither the inhabitants retired for fhelter in times of danger. 
When thefe Pidtifh erections were meant as watch-towers, 
they were fmaller in fize, were only fingle walled, and were 
placed on eminences, from which fignals might be difplayed, 
and feen, when an invafion threatened the inhabitants. Such 
are alwsys in the view of fome other one. Others, that are 
fmall in bulk, and yet fo fituated as not to be feen by any 
other, were probably places where fuperftitious rites were 
performed. There is the vedige of one of thefe latter build- 
ings, that Hands on a piece of ground jutting into a fheet 
of water that lies contiguous to the manfe. It is furround- 
ed with the water, except in front, and has a fmall caufe- 
way leading to it. Eefide the circular building in the mid- 
dle, there is a range of large ftones, that runs acrofs the neck 
of land, and may have been intended to inclofe the fpot, as a 
place of burial, which the building does not occupy. — There 
is a ftone, very long, that lay time immemorial in the church- 
yard of Papa, but was lately built into one of the corners of 
the church, which flone has all the appearance of having been 
ufed as an anchor to a fnip, before iron anchors were ufed. 
It is about eight feet in length, and two in diameter. It 
has a groove, continued on each fide the whole length, turn- 
ing narrower towards both ends, in which a rope would be

placed, and to which the cahle would be fattened. If that I 
has been its ufe, it mud therefore be pretty ancient. — There i 
is a copper bafon, feemingly very ancient, belonging to the* 
church of this place, which is ufed at the time of baptifm. 
It is faid to have been given in a prefent by a Dutchman orr 
Bremener, together with a bell for the church, and a filverrj 
cUp of curious workmanlhip, originally ufed for holding the 
collection for the poor. The cup was enlarged, and is now r 
ufed as one of the communion cups : But the bafon remains 
as formerly, and exhibits the figure of our Saviour at an i 
altar; the form of a dove over him, emblematical of the? 
Holy Ghoft defcending on him : and an angel is repre- 
fented in the attitude of kneeling, and holding in one of *| 
his hands a fceptre, with a crofs on the top, (hewing him J 
to be an archangel, or fome dignity in the heavenly hie- - 
rarchy : In the middle there is the figure of a pot, with . 
two hands, having fomething like flowers growing out of j 
it; perhaps thefe are emblematical of the fruits of righte- ■ 
oufnefs, and the increafe of the Saviour's kingdom among ; 
men. A mutilated font is placed at a corner of the church- 
yard* 

Mifcellancous Obfcrvations. — Since the baron bailies were 
fuppreffed, by whom petty differences were cognofced, the : t 
rninifter is necefiarily much troubled with the auarrels that : 
arife among the people, who are at a diftance from the feat I 
of juflice, where they might obtain redrefs. The talk isn 
unpleafant, yet, fhould thefe differences be entirely over- -I 
looked, though of a civil nature, uncbriftiaa convention 1 1 
would more generally prevail. 

Where manufactures and ufeful employments are efta- 
blilhed, the populoufnefs of a country forms its riches and i 
ftrength ; but where thefe are wanting, too much popula-

, tion becomes its burden. It is like a Ihip's company redu- 
! ced to Ihort allowances. Such is the cafe with this coun- 
try. 

Befides, the farms are by far too final 1, many of them, 
I within thefe forty years being fplit into triple the number, 
j This has proceeded from the impolitic rage for profecuting 
j the filhing ; but it is accompanied with hurtful confequen- 
ces to the tenants, as the fmallnefs of their farms keeps 
(them in indigence. It tends only to enrich the landmafter 
jfor the prefent, as he takes the products at a much lower 
, price than would be given by a neutral merchant; he ha- 
lving the fame labour from one that has only a few merks 
jof land, that he had from the tenant when pofleffing, for- 
jmerly, a much greater quantity. Having little land, the te- 
Inant can rear few cattle to bring him ca(h to pay his rent, 
land procure luch things as he may need : Whereas, in former 
Itimes, by poffeffing more, and being allowed to remain there- 
Son throughout the year, without being forced to fifti for the 
[landlord, he was better able to pay his rent, and could live 
En' a more comfortable and fubftantial manner. From the 
jwant of leafes, and the tenant's being frequently obliged to 
liave recourfe to his landmafter for fupplies in his exigen- 
cies, it renders him fervile and obfequious. That manly 
Independent fpirit, which characterizes a free-born Bri- 
lon, and prevails among the peafantry in the fouth coun- 
tries, is here loft. — As the tenant has only a verbal tack, 
lie promifing to fifh for the hindmafter, and to give him all 
his products, and to remain upon the land during pleafure, 
this proves a bar to all improvements, as he knows not if 
lie will reap the benefit thereof longer than one year. 
Knowing that he cannot obtain the fame price from his 
barter for the articles he has to difpofe of, that another 

would

would give him, the tenant is often tempted to trefpafs 
his contract ; and, when found out, (which is mod fre- 
quently, the cafe), he is fined at difcretion, or has a fun 
mons of removal immediately executed againft him. This 
is fubverfive of every virtuous principle, and introduces: 
a low cunning and chicanery in the tranfadions of the 
people. 

Note — It frequently happens, that a cold north wind prevails in the montb: 
of May, which retards vegetation very much ; and in wet and moorifh ground* 
gives birth to the flag, or what is here called the Jlorey-nuorm, which u holly! 
deftroys the grain. Heat and moifture are extremely favourable in produr-ioe 
other reptiles ; but heat deftroys the Aug. It flirinks from the fun, if e vpo 
fed to its rays, and, if it cannot get itfelf buried again under the furfac e, fooip

<p>Situation. 

r F~HIS parilh is fituated on the fertile banks of the river 
-■- Karri, that gives name to the rich and beautiful ftrath 
through which it runs. It is probable that a considerable 
portion of this plain or ftrath was once covered by the 
water of the river, or by an arm of the fea, which, through 
length of time, was replaced by fand, mud and earth, car- 
ried down from the neighbouring high lands, in the fame 
manner that the carfes of Stirling and Falkirk, and fome 
others, had been originally formed. Forteviot ftretches not 
only acrofs this plain, but far into the Ochil-hills, and com- 
prehends fome of the diftinguiftxed fumruits belonging to

the northern divifion of that well-known ridge of moun- 
tains. It is bounded on the eaft by the parifhes of Aber- 
dalgie, Forgandenny, and part of Arngafk ; on the weft, by ■ 
Dunning, Findo-Gafk, and a part of Forgandenny that 
runs weftward between the Ochil part of this parifli and 
the reft of it ; on the north, by Tibbermor ; and on the ! 
fouth, by Orwell. It is computed to be eight miles in i 
length, by two in breadth. Hilltown and Mailler, another 
diftricl of the parifti, is alfo entirely cut off from the reft 
by two intervening pariftjes, at the diftance of about three 
or four miles. The improper fubdivifion of parifhes, with 
relation to one another, with refpecr. to their feveral 
churches, and the conveniency of their inhabitants, is fo 
general all over Britain, that it almoft ceafes to be viewed 
as an abfurdity. Our laudable veneration, however, for the 
indifputable wifdom, and mature judgment of our ancef- 
tors, in marking, with great precifion, the limits of thefe 
notable diftricls, and the irremediable confufion that would 
neceffarily follow, were any alteration made on them, 
fhouid effectually reftrain us from ever attempting to difturb 
their eftablilhed order. 

Name.' — The name of this place is generally written Forr 
teviqt. In Fordun and others, it is Fortheviot, Forthe- 
vioth, and Forteviach. This name is aflerted by foms 
authors to be a contraction of Forthuir-tabiaicht, Gaelic, 
from Foirthir, farther or remote j and tabachta, ftate or 
condition. This compound name may therefore mean the 
remote or diftant iituation or ftate, which, with refpeft to 
Stirling, Perth, or Abernethy, ancient feats of government 
and power, is very much applicable to the place. This 
etymology, however, is very doubtful. 



Heritor** 



of Forteviot.

Heritors. — The Earl of Kinnoul, Lord Ruthven, and Co- 
llonel Belches of Invermay, are the principal proprietors 
■in the parilh. 

I Rivers. — The river Earn or Ern flows acrofs the breadth 
■of the parilh, from weft to eaft. It frequently overflows its 
ijbanksj and is thereby the occafion of great damage to the 
■low grounds through which it runs. — The May is a rivulet 
Sthat takes its origin among the Ochil-hills, at the diftance 
■of about eight miles from the Earn, into which, after a 
iigreatly variegated courfe, it is loft, a little t» the eaft ward of 
cu ftone bridge of 6 arches, built about 30 years ago, very 
■near the place where the ferry-boat or coble formerly was. It 
Ibmetimes defcends from the hills with great rapidity, making 
lonfiderable devaluations on the banks and the adjacent 
■grounds. On thefe occalions, the pafiage to the church, from 
tome parts of the country, is rendered very circuitous and 
Bifficult. — Invermay, the refidence of Colonel Belches of 
■nvermay, is lituated a ftiort way from the church, on the 
Ranks of the May, in one of the molt romantic and plea- 
jant fpots in this part of Perthftiire. This is the place that 
I jave rife to the well-known ballad of the Birks of Inver- 
rniaj. The manfion-houfe, which is not of an old date, is 
meat and commodious, and makes a ftrikxng contrail with 
In old tower, which is permitted to remain, in its vicinity. 
(The banks are covered with wood, both natural and plant- 
id ; among which the birk (birch) holds x confpicuous 
|lace, and perpetuates the fcenery alluded to in the ballad 
Rlready mentioned. — The water and banks of the May ex- 
libit fome natural curiolities, that deiervedly attract the at- 
tention of ftrangers. The Humble Bumble, in particular, is 
ixtremely remarkable. This name is given to a narrow 
|ourfe which the water has cut for itfelf a confiderable way

through a rock, the fides of which meet almoft togethe r 
eipecially near the top. This paflage is both deep and 
dark. A rumbling noife, which the water makes in its 
paflage through it, is believed to have given rife to the 
name by which this remarkable place is known.. — A. little 
above the Humble Bumble is the Linn of Muckarjey , a . 
bout thirty feet perpendicular, which, when the water is 
high, and comes foaming from the hills, exhibits a beauti- 
ful cafcade. — The banks of the May, and feveral other 
places in the parifli, abound with plants not frequently to 
be met with, as the lithofpermum officinale, aftragalus ura-i 
lenjis, &amp;c. 

Proper Names. — Many of the names of places in thi* 
parifh are Gaelic, as Craigmor, Cairnmor, and Invermay,. 
&amp;c. As thefe are the names of hills and rivers, they may 
be confidered as very ancient-, not being fo liable to change 
as the names of houfes and farms. It is probable, there- 
fore, that they were given by the original inhabitants of 
the place, and confequently mult have been prior to the time 
when it was poflefled by the Picls ; for it is believed, that 
the original language of the Pi£ts and of the Scots was not 
the fame. It is worthy of obfervation alfo, that mod of 
thefe names, as ReJJie, Inver or Inner, &amp;c. are fuch as. 
abound in the weftern Highlands of Scotland, in places 
where the Gaelic has been the vernacular language of the 
inhabitants time immemorial. This, among many others 
that might be mentioned, affords a proof that the Gaelic 
or Erfe language, as at prefent fpoken in the weftern High- 
lands, was in reality the language that was anciently fpoken 
all over Scotland, and not a modern dialect of the Infh, 
brought from Ireland, and peculiar to the weftern diflricls 

of" 



of Forteviot. 



121 



of Scotland, as fome late writers in defence 6f Gothicifma 
groundlefsly fancy it to be. 

Population.— The number of inhabitants is 970. When 
this account was taken, about two years ago, the number of 
males in the parifli was lefs than that of females only by 
three. In 1755, according to Dr Webfter's account, the 
population was 1164, which makes a deficiency of 194. 
The accumulation of fmall into large farms is generally afcri- 
bed as the. chief caufe of this depopulation. 

Church. — The ancient church of Forteviot is faid to have 
been founded by Hungus king of the Pi&amp;s, who lived near 
the downfal of the Pictifh kingdom, and to whom this di- 
ftrict belonged. It was at an early period attached to the 
Abbey of Cambufkenneth, and was afterwards given to the 
College of St Andrews ; which college, and the family of 
Belches of In vermay, are patrons. The ancient pari fh of Muck- 
arfey was, many years ago, annexed to Forteviot. There is 
a place of worfliip at Muckarfey, and the ruins of another at 
Kirktown of Mailler, neither of which has for a long time 
been frequented ; but the burying-grounds adjoining tof 
them are occupied by the neighbourhood for burying their 
dead. — The Reverend Hairy Inglis is the prelent incum- 
bent, and enjoys a ftipend above L. 100 Sterling, befides 
manfe and glebe. He has long ferved in the paltoral charge 
of this parilh with great relpe&amp;ability and fuccefs. Of 
late, however, owing to old age and infirmity, he has been 
under the necefiity of keeping an aflillant, of which he has 
had feveral in fucceffion. The cuftom that prevails! in Scot- 
land, of fupplying a parochial charge by means of an affift- 
ant, when the minifter becomes unfit for the whole or a 
part of the duty, is highly commendable. Thefe affift- 

Vol. XX. Q ant* 



122 Statijlical Account 

ants are moftly young men, who being licenfed to preack, 
are candidates for the holy miniftry. They are paid, whet* 
afliftants, commonly by the minifter; but fometimes by 
the minifter and parifhioners, and in fome inftances by the 
parifhioners only. Their bufinefs,. as afliftants, is to preach, 
catechife, and vifit the people, at the defwe, and under the 
fole direction of the minifter. Some few of them, owing 
to the peculiar circumftances of the parifh, are ordained, or 
admitted to full orders, and in confequence may adminifter 
the facraments. They generally continue in office during 
the pleafure of the minifter : but fome of them, who have 
procured an intereft in the patron's favour, are, by the; 
confent of the minifter, ordained afliftants and fucceflbrs. 

School. — The parochial fchool, under the wife direction* 
and regular attendance, of Mr Gow, the prefent fchoolmafter,. 
is well frequented. The falary is L. 100 Scotch ; the pay. 
ing of a great part of which is laid on the tenants, and 
requires about lixty receipts to be given annually by the 
fchoolmafter, before even that fmall fum can be colle&amp;ed. 
The fchool-wages are very moderate, being i s. per quar- 
ter for Englifh ; is. 3d. for writing; is. 6d. for arith- 
metic; and 2s. for Latin, The proportion between the 
wages and the hours of attendance feems in no lefpecl: to-M 
be reafonable. The fchool begins, during fummer, at nine 
in the morning, difmifles at twelve at noon ; meets again at; 
two in the afternoon, and difmifles at five in the afternoon. 
It commences, during winter, at ten in the morning, and i 
continues, without intermiflion, till three in the afternoon. 
When the time of attendance is confidered, and efpecially ) 
the inceflant labour that muft be undergone in teaching * • 
parochial fchool, it will appear, that the eftabliftied fchoolmaf- 
ters in this diftrift, and generally all over Scotland, are but 

poorly

poorly rewarded. An application, a few years ago, was 
made to the lamied mterelt, by the parochial fchoolmafters of 
the kingdom, for a fmall addition to the;.r falaries j but it 
was oppofed with the utmoft vigour, and, in confequence, 
did not fucceed. It muft, however, be obferved, that many of 
the landed proprietors in Scotland, impreffed with a fenfe 
of the propriety of giving a little more encouragement to 
a clafs of men the moll ufeful in fociety, are fpontaneoufly 
offering their afliftancc in augmenting the falaries of pariflb 
fchools. 

Poor. — The poor upon the feffion-roll are ufually about 
fix or eight ; and are fupported by the collections at church, 
which being only about 3 s. 6 d. a-week, muft afford them 
but a very fcanty fupply. 

Agriculture. — As there is little or no manufacture in the 
parifli, the people are moftly employed in hufbandry, the 
mode of which has altered with the late introduction of 
agricultural improvements into Perthfhire. Not much of 
the parilh is inclofed ; a circumftance which indicates, 
that the farmers of this place have a great deal of pleafure 
yet awaiting them, in carrying improvements to a much 
greater degree of perfection than they have hitherto reached. 

Antiquities. — This parilh affords not a little matter for 
the inquiries of the antiquary. Here, it is faid, was the 
refidence of fome of the kings of the Pidts in remote pe- 
riods : and here King fcenneth, after the Pictilh kingdom 
was annihilated, departed this life, as thus narrated in the 
MSS. of Melrofe, and Andreas Vintonius, who wrote in 
the time of Robert Duke of Albany.

Standing-Jlane of Banhhead and Crufs of Dro/iocbv. Seve-

The mill of Forteviot, and the Coblehaugh, mentioned by

boat for ferrying over the Earn. The miller's daughter 
was mother to Malcolm Canmore. 

An account of fome of thefe, and other antiquities in the

and many charters are faid to bear date from it. Near to this place, Ed- 
ward Baliol encamped his army, 31ft July 1332, on the Miller's Acre, im- 
mediately before the bloody battle of Duplin. There is a ftone crofs, quite 
entire, a good way up the rifing ground (Bankhead) on the oppofite bank 
of the Earn, almoft ftraight north from the ford by which Ealiol's army 
-eroded the river, and another on the fouth of Forteviot, upon a rifiug ground, 
called Dronachy, lying broken over at the pedeftal, on which are many 
emblematical figures. About half-a-mile north from the firft of thefe, a 
Jarge tumulus or cairn was opened about thirty years ago, by the people re- 
pairing a road in the neighbourhood, and in it were found fome coffins 
formed of rough flat ftones, containing many fragments of bones, and 
fome trinkets in various figures, of a vitrified fubftance and blackifli colour ; 
and, a few years ago, fome urns were dug up at the well boundary of the 
parilli, when the road was repairing between Invermey and Dunning. 

The ruinous buildings on the Halyhillweie vifited as an object of cu- 
riofity, fo late as the reign of Charles I. ; but nothing now remains of thefe 
buildings, and only a part of the eminence whereon they flood, as the wa- 
ter of Mcy, by undermining below, is continually wafhing away lefs or 
more of the rubbifli. The King's Haugh, a little eaft from the -place, Itill 
retains the name. Tradition informs us, that fome houfes in the neighbour- 
hood have been built, or rebuilt, of the ftones of the palace at Halyhiil; and 
fome of thefe are eafiiy diftinguiflied by the antiquated figures cut there- 
on.

<p>HIS parifli, from the earlieft public records, was called. 



what it is to this day, Oriutl. From whence it deri- 
ved this name is entirely unknown. The various accounts 
from tradition, from whence it derived this name, are fo fa- 
bulous, as to exceed the belief of even the molt credulous 
antiquarian. 

This parilh is better known in the neighbouring pa- 
riflies, by the name of the village in which the kirk and 
manfe are fituated, viz. Millnathort, vulgarly called Mills- 
a-forth ; from mulean. a mill, and atbart, acrofs, or over ; 
both Gaelic words, and which are perfectly expreffive of the 
real fuuation of the town ; a mill being plaeed upon a rivu- 
let, which nearly equally divides the village. 

This parjfh, as mentioned above, is fituated in the fhire 
of Kuirofs, prefbvtery of Dunfermline, and fynod of Fife. 



Name, Situation, and Extent.

It 13 bounded by the parifhes of Amgalk and Forteviot oa 
the north j by Kinrofe on the fouth ; by Portmoack and 
Strathmeiglo on the eaft ; and by that of Fofiaway on the 
weft ; being between 5 and 6 miles in length from eaft to 
weft, and about 5 miles in breadth from north to fouth. 

It is 16 miles from the North Ferry, and 14 from Perth. 
The great road to Perth leads through the village of Millna- 
thort, in the centre of the parifli. 

Surface and Soil. — This parifli lies almoft perfectly flat ; 
north from the village it rifes gradually to the top of the 
high grounds called Kinrofs-brae, which braes are the termi- 
nations of the Ochil-hills ; the height of which, here, will not 
be above 760 feet above the level of the fea. There is not 
much of this parifli either in moor or mofs ; the far greater 
part of it confifts in excellent pafture for cattle, or in culti- 
vation. 

The foils are various. The farms which lie to the fouth of 
the parifli, bordering upon the ^ueegb \ , are a mixture of 
clay and fand, and yield about 5 bolls an acre. The farms 
fituated on the north of the village are of a light fandy foil, 
and yield about 6 bolls an acre. The lands about the vil- 
lage are reckoned as good as any in the (hire, and afford ex- 
cellent crops, and generally have an early harveft. 

Inclofures about the village rent at 40 s. per acre, and 
fome parks even at 50 s. per acre. Upon an average, the 
one-half of the lands of this parifli are neatly divided and in- 
elofed with good ftone-dikes and fences. For the produce 
and quantity of the crops fee the table. 

Minerals. — There is no coal in this parifli hitherto dis- 
covered ; but in the neighbouring pariflies there are plenty 
•f peats, which are ufed by the poorer fort of people.

There are 4 free-ftone quarries in this parifli •, 2 of which 
are upon thefe farms called Hattonburn farms, belonging 
to Mr Stein of Hattonburn : the other 2 are in the ea- 
ftern part of the parifli. The ftones of thefe quarries are 
of a grey and whitiih colour, fomething refetnbling the 
Ciaigleith, near Edinburgh, or thofe of the Portland Hones, 
in England. They are exceedingly good for building, either 
in rouble or in adder. The houfes built in Millnathort, of 
thefe quarries, have an elegant, light, and cheerful appear- 
ance. 

Roads and Plantations. — There are 2 excellent roads that 
run through this parifh : the one, leading from Perth to the 
North Ferry, is conftantly kept in the beft repair ; the 
other, leading from Stirling to Kinrofs, ftrikes off from the 
main turnpike at the bridge of Queegh, is naturally laid 
with channel, and is always good without much repair. 
There is little planting in this parifli, as yet, come to any 
maturity ; the only planting worth while of mentioning, is 
that in the eaftern part of the parifli, which furrounds the 
Caftle of Burleigh, the trees of which are very large, and 
fo old, as that many of them are grown bofs or hollow. This 
planting, with the caftle, belongs to Mr Graham of Kinrofs. 

Rivulets, Bridges, and Mills. — Only 2 rivulets glide thro' 
this parifh •, the largeft of which is called the Queegh, co- 
ming from the weft, and terminating in Loch Leven. This 
rivulet, upon an average, may be about 20 feet over, and di- 
vides this parifli from Kinrofs on the fouth, over which 
there is a good ftone-bridge, on the great turnpike-road 
from the Ferry to Perth. The other rivulet runs through 
the village of Millnathort, and ferves the inhabitants with 
water ; it is over this rivulet that the village of Millnathort, 
with the mills, are fituated, which gave rife to the name of 

the 



of OrweL 129 

1 the village. There are alfo feveral mills lituated upon this 
j rivulet, befides the mill in the village; 2 wauk-mills, 
I flour-mill, 1 thrafliing-mill, and 3 meal-mills, befides the 
i diftillery. Over this rivulet, alfo, there is a ftone-bridge, in 
I the middle of the village. 

Population — The population of this parifli has certainly 
increafed of late. The number of children born, com muni' 
ij bus annis, about 120 ; but, owing to the negligence of the 
j parents, in not regiftrating their childrens births, an accurate 
lift cannot be obtained. They feem to have paid more at- 
tention to this the end of laft century than they do at pre- 
fent. — The population in 1755, was 1891 fouls. 

The following tables will 'fhow, at one view, the popula- 
1 tion of this parifli for fome years pall, and which are meant 
j as a medium for the prefent and former years, viz.

fquare, furrounded by a wall of 10 feet in height, ; 
ditch, and a redoubt. It is furrounded, as already me 
ed, with a great number of trees, many of which an 
large, and bofs and hollow with age. 

One of them, in particular, (an am), about the difta 
20 yards from the caftle, has been bofs thefe 50 year 
Of this tree, tradition gives many accounts, which vv 
not infert, as fome of them feem doubtful *. Th 
caftle, with the lands annexed, was purchafed 30 yeai 
by General Irvin, and fold by him to Mr Graham o 
rofs, the prefent proprietor. 

This caftle is entirely a ruin ; fome part of its wall 
len to decay, and the ditch that furrounded it is in 
places filled up. 

Ecclefiaftical State. — The prefent kirk of Orwel, 
it is commonly called, the Old Kirk, in contradiftinft 
the Seceders meeting-houfes, which are called the 
Kirks, was built in the year 1729. It ftands upon ai 
nence above the village of Millnathort, about 200 
from the manfe ; it has, outwardly, a pretty decent a 
ance for a country kirk, and is tolerably well finiH 
wardly. The manfe alfo is lituated on an eminence 
the village; it is entirely new, being built in 1788

the fite of the old manfe ; its front is to the fouth, and 
the garden before it declines like a hot-bed ; the manfe U 
built in a temporary manner •, the walls being infufficient to 
hold out rain, confequently, the houfe is often filled with wa- 
ter, and the ceiling deftroyed. 

The fchool-houfe was built in 1769 : it confifts of only 2 
apartments •, the one is ufed as the fchool-houfe, the other 
as the fchoolmafter's room. 

The living of this narifh, at prefent, glebe, manfe, &amp;cc. 
included, will be about L. 120 Sterling. The glebe confifts 
of 8 Scotch acres, of a good rich foil, and is contiguous with 
the manfe. — The fchoolmafter here, as in many parifhes of 
Scotland, officiates as feflion-clerk ; his falary is L. 200 
Scotch, which, with fchool-fees and other emoluments, make 
his income confiderable ; as in winter there are upwards of 
100 fcholars, and in fummer there will be 60. 

There are few poor upon the roll, as the other 3 places of 
worfliip fupport their own poor. 

The fchool-fees are, Englilh 1 s. 6 d. ; writing, 2 s. ; arith- 
metic, 2 s. 6 d. ; and Latin, 3 s. 6 d. per quarter. Mr Gra- 
ham of Kinrofs is the patron. 

In the village of Millnathort there are no fewer than 4 
places, of worlhip, viz,, the Eftablifliment, the Antiburgh- 
ers, Burghers, and Reformers, commonly called Camero- 
nians. 

The primary caufe of there being Seceders in this parifh, 
was a Mr Mair, a minifter of the Eftablifhment, who, chan- 
ging his opinions, preached up the erroneous doftrine of uni- 
verfal redemption, and was in confequence of this difmiffed 
from his charge ; notwithstanding of this he ftill continued 
in the village} preaching this doclrine, till the day of his 
death, to his adherents, who were very numerous, and who 
built that lar^e chapel prefently occupied by the Burghers.

The exaft number of perfons, of each opinion in this pa- 
rim, has been already mown by the table. 

Thefe other meeting-houfes, however, befides accommo- 
dating the inhabitants of this parifli, alfo accommodate ma- 
ny hearers who come from the neighbouring parifhes. Many 
of thefe hearers come regularly every Lord's day, 8, 10, and 
even 14 miles, to hear their own minifter. Thefe people, 
male and female, travel, when the roads are bad, bare-foot 
and bare-legged, with their fhoes and ftockings in their 
hands : fo much regard have they for the word, to hear it 
preached in its purity and fimplicity. 

CharaEler and Manner of Living. — They, in general, are 
aftive and induftrious : they are naturally generous and fo- 
cial, and very fond of news. Drunkennefs in this parifli 
is ent rely unknown. They are very orderly and decent 
people •, and crimes of any confequence are feldomer com- 
mitted here than in many parifhes in Scotland of equal po- 
pulation. 

Religious CharaBer. — The religious character of the in- 
habitants of this parifh is various, according to their feci. 
Thofe of the Eftablifhment neither run into the extreme of 
fuperftition on the one hand, nor of fanaticifm on the other, 
but are of the calm, moderate, and mild caft, making no 
great noife or buftle about it, though they are very* regular 
in attending to its inftitutions. 

The Seceders, in general, are very quiet and peaceable, 
and live in good understanding with thofe of a different 
perfuafion. Upon the whole, the inhabitants attend re- 
gularly upon divine ordinances, both of a common, or of 
a more extraordinary nature ; and there are few families 
who do not keep up the worfliip of God in their houles,

evening and morning ; a divine inftitution, too much ne- 
gle&amp;ed, if not wholly laid afide, in many parifhes in this 
Mand. Upon a review of the religious character of the in- 
habitants of this parifh, we cannot but conclude with thefc 
words, as applicable to them, " They are a people dwelling j 
" alone *." 

Climate, Difeafes, and Longevity. — The inhabitants of this 1 
parifh juftly boaft of the falubrity of the air in which they 
breathe. Situated upon a dry foil, and bleffed with manyr 
pure fprings of water ; warned by the river Queegh on the 
fouth, and by a fmaller one juft running through the vil- 
lage i fenced from the blafts of the ftormy north by Kinrofs- 
brae ; and from the cold eaft winds by Lomond Hills •, 
they often enjoy a happy exemption from thofe difeafes 
which lurk in marfliy diftri&amp;s, and which frequently vilit 
and affeft parifhes at no great diflance. The inhabitants of 
this parifh are not only entirely free of all difeafes, but are 
flrong, robuft, and of a heal conftitution. Many of them^ 
live to a very great age. One woman f, in particular, may 
be mentioned, who, though upwards of 94 years, is in good 
health, and fupports herfelf by fpinning. She has childrer, 
grandchildren, and great-grand-children, in the fame village. 
There have been many buried of late in this church-yard, 
whofe ages have been faid to exceed that of this woman; 1 
but to all the accounts of longevity publifhed, or even rela- 
ted, we are by no means to give credit, as they are general- 
ly exaggerated. 

Fuel and Manner of Living. — It has formerly been obc 
ferved, that there is no coal in this parifh : the inhabitants 
get this article from Kelty, about 6 miles fouth of this pa 

rilh

rifli ; they pay is. 2d. for a fingle cart at the hill, and 3 s. 
for cartage, making the cart of coals amount to 4 s. 2 d. : it 
will weigh about 8 cwt. 

There are alfo peats to be had in the neighbourhood ; but 
thefe are only burnt by the poorer fort of people. 

Their manner of living is perfe&amp;ly plain and fimple, 
which muft greatly contribute to their health. The poorer 
fort have oat-meal pottage for their breakfaft and fupper, 
and broth made of barley and peafe for dinner, and this of- 
ten without flefh ; which, with bread baked of peafe-meal, 
and rolled thin, called peafe-bannocks, compofe the whole of 
their dinner. 

The better fort, however, live in a very different man- 
ner; moft of the farmers and mafter tradefmen keep as good 
a table as any gentleman of L. 500 a-year ; and their com- 
mon drink after meals is whifky-punch, which article they 
j have in this parifh rather better than what is to be found in 
many places of Scotland. It is diftilled here by Mr Stein 
j of Hattonburn. The village of Millnathort confumes a 
j great deal of this article, which may eafily be accounted for 
\ from the number of public-houfes in the village. The 
confumption is not fo much by the inhabitants themfelves, as 
by the great concourfe of paffengers travelling this road to 
11 Perth, and all the north of Scotland.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7563593">SORN</name>. 



(County of Ayr, Synod of Glasgow and Ayr, 
Presbytery of Ayr).</head> 



<p>HIS parifh, which lies in the fhire, fynod, and prefby- 



tery of Ayr, and diftrift of Kyle, is bounded on the 
eaft, by the parifh of Muirkirk ; on the fouth, by that of 
Auchinleck ; on the weft, by that of Mauchline ; and, on 
the north, by thofe of Galfton arid Strathaven. The church, 
which is nearly in the centre of the parifh, is about 3 miles 
diftant from Mauchline, the neareft poll town, 60 miles weft 
from Edinburgh, 30 fouth-weft from Glafgow, and 15 eaft 
from Ayr, 



By the Rev. George Gordon. 



Situation and Name. 




The 



of Sorn*, 



139 



The proper and, intended name* of the parifh is Dal- 
gain ; but the Cattle of Sorn, an ancient feat of the family 
of Loudon, happening to (land contiguous to the church, has 
infenfiblj communicated its own name to the whole pariih; 
infomuch, that the former name is now but little known or 
regarded. Both thefe names are originally Gaelic f. The 
[ former fignifies Sandfield, being compounded of dail, a 
1 field, and gain, fand ; a name exactly defcriptive of the 
ground about the gentleman's houfe from whofe eftate the 
glebe and church-yard were detached ; and a name, too, 
j which that eftate, now the property of Mr Stevenfon, (till 
i bears. To ascertain the precife meaning of the word Sorn, 
i is, it feems, a matter of greater difficulty. By thofe who 
j are Jkilled in the Gaelic language, I am informed, that, 
I among other meanings, Sorn fignifies a riling-ground of a 
ij frowning or unpleafant afpecl:. According to this etymo- 
| logy, the name may have taken its rife either fromthe rock 
I on which the caftle is founded, and which, at a confiderable 
] height, overhangs the river of Ayr} or rather, perhaps, 
I from the general afpecl: of the riling-grounds in the neigh- 
bourhood, which, at no very remote period, muft have been 
extremely bleak and dreary. 

Extent, Form, and Genera/ Appearance.* — Cutting oflTa tri* 
1 angular point of land, which runs beyond the general line of 

march, 

* By a ftrange typographical error in the Statiftical Account of Muirkirk, 
|ftli?parifli is called Lorn, which is well known to be a diftricl of Argyle- 
fhire, far remote from this part of the country. 

t As indeed are moft of the names of places in this parifh. Some of thefe 
I fliall here mention, with the explanation, which I have received from a 
friend in the Highlands. Glen-Jbamroch, clover vale ; Dal-cbarnach, the 
field of cairns ; Dal-darch, oak field ; Dal-diling, a field liable to be over- 
flowed ; Car-kith, a winding torrent ; Auchiri-cloich, ftone-field ; Barboicb, 
«omely grove ; Blur-kip, the field of archers ; Aitthmonnacb, hill-field.

march, at the fouth-weft extremity, and which may confift of 
about 3C0 acres, the form of this parifli is nearly fquare, whofe 
fide is 6^- miles. The river of Ayr, running from eafl ty 
weft, divides this fquare into two parts; the one on the north 
fide being fomewhat larger than that on the fouth. This 
river, which rifes in tlie adjoining parifli of Muirkirk, be. 
ing, a little before its entrance into this parifli, increafed by 
the Greenock and Garpel rivulets, and, in its progrefs thro' 
it, ftill further augmented by a number of fmaller ftreams, 
from both fides, forms, by the time it arrives at the weftern 
boundary, a confiderable body of water; which, during its 
whole courfe, runs with great rapidity on a bed of round 
ftones and gravel. It frequently attempts to fliift its bed, 
and to make encroachments on the adjacent holms. A 
gentleman, who has paid much attention to rivers, charadte- 
rifes it as the greatejl tyrant of the kind he has ever known. 
Its banks are almoft every where fteep and bold, and cloth- 
ed with natural wood on one fide or other, and very fre- 
quently on both. The fcenery on its banks, therefore, efpe- 
cially about Sorn Caftle and the manfe, is, in an uncommon 
degree, pidlurefque and pleating. 

The land, obferving the fame courfe as the river, is high- 
eft on the eaft-fide, and defcends gradually towards the weft; 
diverfified, however, by various inequalities on its fur face. 
The only confiderable hill is Blackfide-end, fituated in the 
rrorth-eaft corner of the parifli ; the height of which above 
the level of the fea is from 1500 to 1600 feet: It is the be- 
ginning of a ridge, which, with occafional interruptions, 
fweeps a great way towards the eaft and fouth. It com- 
mands a profpecf of almoft the whole extenfive county of 
Ayr ; the high lands of Galloway on the fouth ; the Irifh 
Channel, the rock of Ailfa, the ifles of Arran and Bute, on 

the- 



of Sorrt. 



the welt ; and part of th? fliires of Renfrew, Lanark, and 
Argyle, on the north. 

Natural Produ&amp;lons. — The moots and fields are pretty 
well flocked with the ufual kinds of game ; but I have ne- 
ver heard of any Angular or uncommon plant or animal in 
this parifh ; neither are there any lakes in it. It abounds, 
however, in peat, coal, lime-ftone, iron-ftone, and red free- 
flone, all of a good quality. Hard by Sorn Caftle there is 
likewife a beautiful kind of ftone, of a blue-grey colour, 
and of a clofe texture, which takes a polifh little inferior to 
that of marble, and is therefore admirably fitted for the pur- 
pofes of hearth-ftones, pavements, fteps of flairs, &amp;c. In a 
deep glen, too, in the upper part of the parifh, there are 
fymptoms of fpar and lead-ore. In the river of Ayr there 
was abundance of frefh-water trout, and fome falmon •, but 
it is here generally believed, that they have, of late, been 
much diminifhed in their numbers, by the iron and tar 
works of Muirkirk, and by the coal and lime works both 
in that parifh and the parifh of Sorn. Mod of the fprings 
are, more or lefs, impregnated with iron ; fome of them 
with lime, and fome with fulphur ; but, owing to the obfcu- 
rity of their lituation, in this remote corner of the country, 
none of them have hitherto attracted much attention. 

Soil and Climate. — As nearly as I can compute, without 
aclaal meafurement, this parilh contains about 23,660 Eng- 
lifh acres •, of which, about 3C00 acres confift of mofs; 7000 
«f hills, moors, and other pafture-lands •, about 200 are co- 
vered with wood, partly natural, and partly planted in belts 
and clumps; and the remaining 13,460 are arable, though 
not all at prefent in a ftate of actual cultivation. The mofs 
is diflributed through feveral parts of the parilh, and is, for 

the 



142 



Statiflkal Account 



the moft part, of the black kind. In fome places, however 
it is reddifh, particularly in Aird's mofs ; the weft or lower 
end of which begins in the fouth fide of this parifli, and runs 
up through it, and the parifli of Auchinleck, to the diftance 
of 8 or 9 miles. The moors and modes produce little but 
heath, bent, fprits, and rufhes. In feveral places, however, 
the foil, which yields thefe coarfe productions, is only about 
a foot in thicknefs, and below this covering there is a rich 
bed of clay. Such lands are, therefore, evidently capable of 
much improvement. Excepting te holms on the banks of 
the river, and on thofe of the larger brooks, which are of a 
light and gravellifli nature, the prevailing foil in the arable 
diftriclis is that of a reddifli clay, upon a bottom of blackifli 
till. This foil, under proper management, and in favour- 
able feafons, yields good crops of oats ; but, as it retains too 
much moifture, it is apt, when in pafture, to be foon over- 
run with mofs and ruflies. I have been informed by a gen- 
tleman, who had himfelf made the experiment, that the 
belt method of deflroying ruflies, or at leaft of keeping them 
in fo feeble a (late that they can do little harm, is to cut 
them early in the feafon, about the time when they begin 
to flower, and afterwards, if neGeflTary, in the autumn ; al- 
ways taking care not to allow them to run to feed. By 
this operation, repeated during two fucceflive feafons, he 
has completely cleared his pafture-lands of a very exhauft- 
ing and imperious weed. 

The climate is much the fame here as in the other pariflies 
of this county : Strong gales of wind, blowing direftly from 
the Weftern Ocean, and accompanied with frequent and 
heavy ftiowers of rain, conftitute the prevailing weather. 
Complete rainy days, however, are, I think, lefe common, 
here than on the eall coaft ; neither does fnovv fall in fuch 

quantities,

quantities, or lie fo long ; and we have feldom reafon to 
complain of fog. 

Difeafes.— Notwithstanding the prevalence of rain and 
moifture, the climate is found, by experience, to be remark- 
ably healthy. The ague is a difeafe altogether unknown 
here, and even the rheumatifm prevails much lefs than 
might be expected from the wetnefs of the foil and cli- 
mate. The exemption from this laft difeafe, in fo great 
a degree, is undoubtedly to be afcribed, in part, to the 
general ufe of woollen-clothes, and to the abundance of 
fuel j an article with which even the pooreft families 
are pretty well fupplied. The fmall-pox, indeed, com- 
mits the fame ravages here as in other places where in- 
oculation is not generally praclifed. The notions of abfo- 
lute predeftination, which are (till deeply rooted in the 
minds of the country-people, lead the generality of them 
to look upon inoculation as implying an impious diftruft of 
Divine Providence, and a vain attempt to alter its irrever- 
lible decrees. It is truly painful to think, that, in the 
courfe of laftfummer, (1796), and in my immediate neigh- 
bourhood, no lefs than fix children, from one to twelve years 
of age, have been cnt off by this deftruclive difeafe, all of 
whom might probably have been preferved by means of 
inoculation. Some of thefe children, too, were beautiful 
and promifing in an uncommon degree. Three families, 
however, wifer than their neighbours, inoculated their chil- 
dren in time, and the iffue was luch as might well have en- 
couraged others to follow their example. The cafe^ were 
all remarkably mild and favourable. It is to be hoped, 
that a few more examples of this kind, contra fled with the 
terrible, and often fatal, effects of the difeafe in the natural 
way, will at length open the eyes of the people at large,

and completely remove their prejudices ; efpecially as the 
pra&amp;ice of inoculation has, withiu thefe few years, become 
general in the village of Citrine. In this parifh, one man 
has, from his infancy, been dumb, deaf, and blind ; two men 
are blind from age, and two women in confequence of the 
fmall-pox. 

Longevity.' — A considerable number of both fexes arrive 
at 80 years of age, and fome even exceed 90. Within a 
very fmall diftance of the church, there are juft now living 
a fhoemaker in the 90th year of his age, and who ftill occupies 
the houfe in which he was born ; the church-officer, who is 
in his 85th year ; a gardener in bis 95th, and his wife, near- 
ly of the fame age * •, alfo the poffeflbr of a fmall farm, who 
is now in his 97th year. The laft of thefe is the mod vi- 
gorous of them all, and walks 2 or 3 miles every day. It 
is not a little remarkable, that all thefe aged perfons, ex- - 
cept the firft, were fervants to the late Countefs-dowager of 
"Loudon, who herfelf lived, at Sorn Caftle, till within 3 or 
4 months of her locth year. 

State of Property. — The valued rent of this parifh is 
L. 5416 Scotch ; and the real rent, including that of the 
lands occupied by the proprietors, may amount io about 
L. 4000 Sterling. This property is divided among no lefg 
than 27 heritors. Of thefe, Mr Tennent of Sorn, the mod 
confiderable proprietor, refides occafionally ; Mr Gray of 
Gilmillfcroft, Mr Campbell of Auchmonnach, and 10 fmall 
proprietors, refide conftantly 5 the reft do not refide at all. 
The non-refiding heritors, arranged in the order of their re- 
fpe&amp;ive vaa..tionSj are the following, viz.

Village of Dalgain. — Though there are feveral groups of 
houfes in the central parts of the parifh, on both fides of the 
river, inhabited chiefly by colliers and other labourers, yet 
the only one that can properly come under the denomina- 
tion of a village is Dalgain, fituated a little to the eaftward

©f the church, in a beautiful holm, having the river on the 
front, or fouth fide, and a winding bank, covered with natu- 
ral wood, on the north. About 16 years ago, the late Dr 
Stevenfon, phyfician in Glafgow, the proprietor, parcelled 
out this holm among feveral different feuers, for the pur- 
pofe of building a fmall village, at the rate of 4 d. per tall 
of annual feu-duty. Accordingly, a village foon arofe, 
built on the north fide of the road to Muirkirk, in one row, 
and with a good deal of uniformity. This village now 
confifts of 24 houfes and 43 families, befide 7 families who 
refide in houfes on the banks of the river, which, from 
the proximity of their fituation, may be reckoned a part of 
the village, though built long before it. Thefe jo families 
contain 191 fouls; among whom are 3 fhopkeepers, 3 inn- 
keepers, 3 mafons, 7 fhoemakers, j weavers, 5 tailors, 
4 feamftreffes, and 7 colliers ; the reft are labourers, aged 
widows, &amp;c. This village is, therefore, evidently the refi- 
dence of a large proportion of the tradefmen belonging to 
the parifh. It has not, however, added much to the popu- 
lation, as molt of the fame families formerly lived in cot- 
houfes, which are now in ruins. Moft of thefe families are 
provided with gardens, of various dimenlions, behind their 
houfes, which they cultivate with great care, and raife in 
them not only the common kinds of efculent plants, but al- 
fo ftrawberries, goofeberries, and currants, and occafionally 
flax and barley. Some of them, too, are very fuccefsful in 
the management of bees. 

Price of Labour. — About 10 years ago, when the village 
of Catrine began to be built, the wages of mafons and 
wrights were raifed to about 20 d. per day ; and at that 
rate they have continued ever fince, with little variation. 
In the courfe of the laft 7 years, however, the price of other 
kinds of labour has been confiderably advanced. Seven 

years

years ago, the wages of a labouring man-fervant was from 
L. 7 to L. 8 ; they are now (that is, in 1796) from L. 10 to 
L. 12; of women- fervants, the yearly wages were then 
from L. 3 to L. 3, 10 s. ; they are now L. 4. A tailor, when 
maintained in the families of his employers, then earned 
8 d. per day ; he now earns is. A labourer then earned 
10 d. a-day in winter, and 1 s. in fummer; he now earns 
15 d. or 16 d. a-day in winter, and 18 d. or 20 d. in fum- 
mer. 

State of Agriculture. — Agriculture is here ftill in a very 
imperfect, but, at the fame time, in a progreffive ftate. Few 
of the tenants poflefs more than a ploughgate of land, but 
a confiderable number of them poflefs much lefs. The 
leafes are ufually for 18 or 19 years, with fome reftriftions 
as to management. With refpeft to the rotation of crops, 
the general rules prefcribed are, that only one-third of the 
farm is to be ploughed at a time ; the two firft crops to be 
oats, the third bear and grafs-feeds, the fourth hay, and the 
next five years pafture ; or, inftead of this, the third 
crop may be peafe, the fourth bear and grafs-feeds, &amp;x. 
From the want of proper fubdivifions, however, and the 
abfence or inattention of the proprietors, thefe rules are fel- 
dom ftridtly obferved. Inftead of bear and grafs-feeds the 
third year, it is but too common a practice to take a third 
and even a fourth crop of oats, and then to leave the lands 
for pafture, without fowing any grafs-feeds at all. 

Within the laft 10 or 12 years moft of the farm-houfes 
have been rebuilt, with confiderable improvements, both in 
point of fize and accommodation. Several of the pendicles 
have been thrown into the adjacent farms, and about a do- 
zen of cot-houfes have been allowed to fall into rums, their 
inhabitants having repaired to the villages, (which have late- 
ly ftarted up in this parifti), where they find fufticient em- 
ployment, 



of Sonu 149 

ployment, and good wages, both for themfelves and their 
families. 

The ufe of oxen, for the purpofes of labour, is a thing al- 
together unknown, or at leaft never pracf ifed, in this part 
of the country. The wauk or fulling mill, and the three 
corn-mills, in this parifh, are all upon the river of Ayr. 
The feafons of fowing and reaping are much the fame here 
as in the neighbouring parimes. 

From the general poverty of the tenants, and other cau- 
fes, lime has hitherto been lefs ufed, as a manure, in this 
parifh than in fome of the neighbouring pariflies, which lie 
at a greater diftance from it. As their circumftances have, 
of late, been improving, however, they are now beginning 
to ufe it more, and, at the fame time, to cultivate their 
lands in a better manner, to pay more attention to their 
gardens, the breed of horfes and cattle, and, in ftiort, to 
every kind of rural economy and improvement. With the 
exception of thirlage to particular mills, perfonal and feudal 
fervices are almoft entirely aboliflied. 

According to the leafes of former years, the average rent 
of the arable lands was only about 5 s. per acre ; but as 
thefe leafes expire, the rent is from 10 s. to 12 s. and, in 
the immediate neighbourhood of the villages, from 20 s. to 
30 s. or even higher. 

In the courfe of the 3 laft years, the occupier of a pen- 
dicle of 5 acres, confiding moftly of mofs, has introduced a 
method of cultivating this kind of foil which bids fair to 
be productive of much general utility. He forms his mofs 
ground into beds of 9 or 10 feet wide, exactly refembling 
the lazy beds in which potatoes are fometimes planted. 
Between thefe beds he makes a trench, throwing its con- 
tents upon the beds, in fuch a manner that the upper fur- 
face may lie directly upon the under. This part of the 
work he executes in the autumn and winter, and then 

fpreads 



Statijlkal Account 



fpreads lime upon the beds. In fpring he fows them with 
oats, and then applies the harrow, if the ground will admit 
of it ; but if it will not, he, with a Ihovel, throws a cover- 
ing of loofe earth upon it from the bottom of the trenches. 
By means of this procefs, the firft year yields a crop of 
about 4 bolls per acre, and the fecond a crop of about 6, 
The fame kind of foil, under fimilar management, like- 
•wife produces excellent crops of potatoes. Other perfons 
have already begun to follow the example of this worthy 
and induftrious improver ; and we may now, therefore, in- 
dulge the pleafing profpeft, that the mofs grounds, which 
abound fo much in this parifh, and which have hitherto been 
of very little ufe, may be gradually converted into good 
corn fields, and excellent paftures. 

Stock and Produce. — The upper or moorland part of the 
parifh, confifts of feveral ftore farms, which, altogether, 
maintain about 5000 fheep. in the breed of thefe fheep 
there is nothing remarkable ; they are of the common 
black-faced kind, and of a file fomewhat larger than thofe 
in the fouthern diftricls of this county. In the enclofed 
farms, fheep are ftridtly prohibited, in order to preferve the 
young plantations and hedges. 

From the jealoufy and reluctance which moft of the te- 
nants dilcovered to give an accurate account of their ftock, 
I am unable to afcertain the precife number either ofhorfes 
or black-cattle ; but, from the beft information which I 
could procure, I have reafon to conclude, that the number 
of the former amounts to about 240, and of the latter to 
about 1470. Some of the horfes are ftill of the old dimi- 
nutive breed of the country ; but the greateft part of them 
are an improved breed, of a middle fize, hardy, and well 
adapted to the purpofes of agriculture. The farmers rear 
moft of their own horfes, and a few likewife for fale. The 

number 

( 



of Sorn. 



pumber of ploughs is about 80, and that of carts about 
160. 

The black-cattle confift partly of the fmall ancient 
breed, but moftly of a mixed breed between that and the 
Cunningham kind. About two-thirds are milch-cows, 
and the reft young cattle, rearing for the fame purpofe. 
Very few are reared or fed directly for the purpofe of 
flaughter. Several of the tenants have removed to this pa- 
rifb from the parifh of Dunlop, or its neighbourhood ; the 
art of making Dunlop cheefe is now, therefore, generally 
and well underftood. It is only within thefe 10 or 12 years, 
however, that this fpecies of manufacture was much prac- 
tifed in this parifh. The average produce of butter from 
each cow is 2± ftone, and of cheefe 8 ftone ; about two-thirds 
of which is of the fweet-milk, or Dunlop kind. From thefe 
data, a pretty correct eftimate of the produce of the milch- 
cows in the parifh may be eafily formed. This produce is 
fold partly to the fhopkeepers and private families in the 
neighbouring villages, and partly to thofe in Glafgow. With- 
in thefe few years, fome of the farmers have begun to feed 
a pig or two, with whey in fummer, and with potatoes and 
H little oat-meal in winter. As this kind of ftock is found 
to be profitable, it will probably foon become an object of 
more general attention. 

Potatoes conftitute a very large proportion of the food of 
the inhabitants. Almoft every family raifes them for its 
own ufe ; and the occupiers of land have lately begun to 
raife them alfo for the purpofe of feeding horfes and cattle, 
particularly milch-cows, a practice which is found to be 
highly advantageous. The inhabitants of the villages, and 
pthers, who poffefs no land for raifing potatoes, take a piece 
of ground from fome of the neareft proprietors or farmers, 
at the rate of 6 d. per fall, befide furnifhing a reafonable 
quantity of dung. Thefe pieces of ground they cultivate 

with 



Statijlical Account 



with great care and induflry, fometimes with the plougb, 
but more frequently with the fpade and hoe. The average 
produce of an acre is about 30 bolls; and about 100 acres 
are every year appropriated to the culture of this moft va- 
luable root. 

All who poffefs any portion of land, however final], raifet 
flax fufficient for their own domeilic purpofes, but very 
little for fale. About ao or 30 acres may be annually oc- 
cupied with this kind of crop, which, in general, fucctedV 
very well. About 250 acres are every year fown with . 
clover and rye-grafs. In fome cafes, a crop of wheat has* 
lately been tried upon holm-lands immediately after a crop 
of potatoes, and with very good fuccefs. There is little 
probability, however, that this fpecies of grain will ever be : 
much cultivated in this parifli. Oats and bear, efpecially 
the former, have hitherto been, and are ftill likely to con- 
tinue to be, the principal objects of attention. The average 
produce of an acre is about 5 Ayrfhire bolls, equal to as ma- 
ny Englifh quarters. The prices of grain, and of other pro- • 
vifions, need not be particularly fpecified here, being muchi 
the fame as in the other parimes in the neighbourhood.. 
There is no regular fair in this parifh; but for more than 50  
years there has been an annual race, in the month of March, , 
which draws a confiderable concourfe of people. A.s many 
of thefe meet for bufinefs more than for amufement, this 
race, in fome meafure, anfwers the purpofes of a fair. 

S 

Minerals.— Whatever may be its difadvantages as to foil 
and climate, this parifh has an ample compenfation in its 
minerals, particularly coal and lime. On the north fide of 
the parifh, Mr Campbell of Auchraonnach has a large field 
pf lime-ftone •, but, as it happens to be 3 miles diftant from 
the neareft coal, little advantage has hitherto been derived 
from it. As the demand for lime, however, is yearly in- 

creafing, 



of Sorn. 153 

creafing, he erefled a draw-kiln laft fummer, and now pro- 
pofes to curry on the work with fpirit. 

In the north-eaft diftridt of the parifli, adjacent to Black- 
fide-hill, there is an extenfive moor, part of the eftate of 
Sorn, in which there is a feam of excellent coal, about 5 
feet thick, within 4 or 5 feet of the furface, and of an un- 
known extent. This feam, it appears, had been partly 
wrought in former times, but had been fo much negle&amp;cd 
during the prefent century that its very exigence was for- 
gotten, till it was in a manner redifcovered laft fummer. 
In the fame moor and its vicinity there are great quantities 
of iron-flone ; fpecimens of marble and of black-lead have 
likewife been found there, and fome lime-ftone of an admi- 
rable quality. Were a communication opened with this 
moor, by means of a road of 2 or 3 miles in 4ength, it 
would probably, befide improving the farms through which 
it muft pafs, become a fource of great wealth to the pro- 
prietor, as well as of great accommodation to the furround- 
ing country. In this inftance, and in many others which 
have not yet been fufHciently explored, the bleak moors of 
Caledonia, and her hills covered with blue mills, will, 
doubtlefs, be found to contain fome of her moft valuable 
treafures. 

Fanner to the fouthvvard, but ftill on the north fide of 
the river, and about a mile diftant from it. there are 2 lirne 
quarries, on, the march between the Sorn and Dalgaiu 
eftates, one upon each of thefe eftates. The quarry on the 
Dalgain fide has been wrought for many years, and- both 
works are now carrying on together. Laft fummer 12 men 
were employed in quarrying and burning the lime-ftone, 
and the contractor had engaged to furnifti 12,000 bolls of 
fhells ; owing, however, to the wetnefs of the feafon, and 
the impoflibility of procuring a fulficient number of hands, 
this quantity was not fully completed. At the fame place, 

Vol. XX. U and

and on the Sorn fide, there are rich feams of excellent 
coal ; but us a fire-engine is neceffiiry for drawing off the 
water, and none has yet been ere&amp;ed, this coal has hitherto 
been, in a great meafure, inaccefiible. In another extenfive 
field, on the Sorn eftajte, and at a very fmall diftance from 
the Caftle, there are 2 feams of coal, each about a foot in 
jtbicknefe, with a (tratum of hard till, of about 2 feet thick, 
running between them. Thefe feams, it is true, are rather 
inconliderable ; but as they are only about 8 or 9 fathoms 1 
deep, and not in the fmalleft degree incommoded by water, 
they are wrought at very little expence. Nine colliers 
are a*t prefent employed at this work ; and the out-put per 
week is about 250 loads. As this coal lies nearer to the 
principal markets than any other in the parilh, the proprie- 
tor, takiitg advantage of this circumltance, has lately raifed i 
the price from 6 d. to 8 d. per load. Seven years ago, the 
price was only 4d. In other parts of the Sorn eftate there 
are rich mines of excellent lime (lone and in other parts, 
too, trials are at prefent making, for the purpofe of finding 
new feams of coal ; trials which promife to be attended with 
fuccefs. 

In a riling ground on the fouth fide of the river there is * 
a lime-work of long ftanding, the property of Mr Farquhar [ 
Gray of Gilmillfcroft ; and 2 collieries, one belonging to  
him, and the ether, contiguous to it, in the farm of Eurn- 
head, the property of Mr Logan of Logan. The former of 
thefe gentlemen has been pleafed to favour me with a fhortt 
account of thefe works, which I fhall take the liberty off 
communicating nearly in his own words. 

" The average quantity of lime raifed at this work, du- • 
ring the 18 years that I have been concerned in it, is* 
about 9000 bolls of fbells, each confirting of 5 Winchefter : 
bufhels ; but in fome particular years we have fold 14,000 
bolls. This was actually the quantity fold laft feafon ; 

and 



of Sorn. 



155 



and fo great was the demand, that, could it have been pre- 
pared, we could have fold double that quantity. We have 
contracted with workmen for raifmg 20,000 next feafon. 
As the quantity brought to market varies, the number of 
hands mull vary in proportion. A good workman will, in a 
year, raife 500 tons, equal to 2000 bolls ; but as little can 
be done in winter, you may reckon a man for every 1000 
bolls, befide thofe employed in bearing and in carting the 
lime and coals, to the draw-kiln. The bare, which, 18 
years ago, was only 15 feet, is now 30. This circumftance 
has, of late, obliged us to have recourfe to the expedient of 
mining the rock, which confifts of about 7 feet thick, in fo 
many beds} with a roof of hard till 18 inches thick. This 
ftratum of till, with 10 feet of blaze over it, makes a good 
roof, and allows us to work the mine from 16 'to 20 feet 
wide, leaving pillars about 18 feet fquare. When I enter- 
ed upon this work, the wages of the workmen, both above 
and below, were from 9 d. to 14 d. per day ; they are now 
from 14 d. to 2 s. This lime-ftone has been worked 80 
years. It is carried to the neighbouring pariihes of Auch- 
inleck, Ochiltree, Mauchline, and Stair, to the diftance of 10 
or 12 miles. 

" When I came to this place, there were only about 6 
men employed at the colliery; their wages 14 d. per day, 
and their out-put 10 loads per man; fold at 34- d. per load. 
Without including thofe employed in drawing to the bank, 
the number now employed at our colliery, and the adjacent 
one of Burnhead, will average about 20 ; their out-put^ 
from 12 to 15 loads per day, per man, fold at 6 d. Their 
wages are from 2 s. to 2 s. 6 d. The main feam is about 
8 feet thick, with 6 inches of fire clay in the middle. Im- 
mediately above this feam, there is a (tratum of the fame 
kind of clay, 18 inches thick; above this 18 inches of coal ; 
then 20 inches of hard black flate ; and over that near 3 feet 

of 



156

of coarfe coal. The former practice had been to work only 
the lower feam, leaving about 6 inches of it for a roof; but I 
have lately gone back, and brought away both that roof and 
the next 18 inches of coal. The field is irregular below, 
having many fteps, throwing the coal up and down, a cir- 
cumstance which increafes the expence of working it. Had 
we a fale for iron-ftone the cafe would be very different, as 
thefe fteps are compofed chiefly of that mineral. My pre- 
fent going pit is 30 fathom deep, driven by a horfe-gin. 

" By a memorandum in our charter-book it appears, 
that, ever fince the year 1623, the ftandard Gilmillfcroft 
coal-creel was 14 inches wide, 16 inches deep, and 30 
inches long within ■, price 2 d. Sterling. It further adds, 
that the coals had been wrought in the Burrow-lands fince 
the year 1497. We continue nearly the fame meafure for 
half a load, now fold at 3 d. of which about 7 load make 
20 cwt." 

The fame gentleman adds", M the whole of Sorn parifh 
above, and a confiderable fpace below, the church, abounds 
in coal, lime-fione, and iron-ftone •, and the White-ach iron- 
ore marches with the head of the parifh, and runs into it. 
There is alfo a firing of lead at Hollhoufe-mill ; and the 
fpar at the Burntlhiel-burn is promifing. In the river of 
Ayr there is water fufficient for any machinery, and abun- 
dance of fall every quarter of a mile." 

Roads and Bridges. — About 25 years ago there was no- 
thing, of any extent, in this parifh that could properly de- 
ferve the name of a road. Happily, however, the cafe is 
now very different. Befide half-a-dozen of private roads, 
made at the expence of the refpeclive proprietors, the parifh 
is now interfered by 3 public roads. One of thefe, leading 
from Glafgow to Dumfries by Galfton, paffes through the 
centre of the parifh, from north to fouth. This road is crof- 



of sorn. 



157 



fed by a others, leading from Edinburgh to Ayr, by diffe- 
rent routs. Separating a little on this fide of Muirkirlc, 
the one paffes through the village of Old Cumnock and 
Auchinleck, and the fouthern part of this parilh ; the other, 
on the north fide of the river, paffes through the village of 
Dalgain, and by the church towards Mauchline, where both 
meet again. In the original plan of this latter road, an un- 
fortunate error was committed ; inftead of being carried 
down the narrow vale, clofe by the river, as far as Sorn, 
which would have formed both a level and a beautiful line 
of road, it was carried through the higher grounds, at fome 
diftance, where there are two afcents of confiderable length 
and fteepnefs ; the one of thefe mull be encountered by thofe 
who go to Muirkirk, the other by thofe who return from 
it. So fenfible are the truftees of this error, that they were 
lately propofing to make this part of the road anew, and 
to carry it along the river •, but found that their funds were 
infufficient for this purpofe. They have it now in contem- 
plation to alter the line in one or two places, in order to 
avoid the fteepeft pulls •, and thus to palliate an evil which 
cannot be entirely removed. Thefe various roads, though 
not every where of fuch dimenfions, nor in fuch repair, as 
might be wiftied, may yet, upon the whole, be confidered as 
good, and highly ufeful. 

Befide a number of fmaller bridges, there are two acrofs 
the river of Ayr ; one of thefe is in the lower part of the 
parilh, on the fouth road from Edinburgh to Ayr ; the 
other, confifting of two arches, is clofe by the church, where 
the Glafgow road interfects the north road to Edinburgh- 
For this latter bridge the country is indebted to the Rev- 
erend Mr Steel, of whom I (hall more than once have occa- 
fion to make honourable mention. This bridge was built 
folely by means of contributions, which he collected in the 
parilh and neighbourhood.

Ecclejtaflical State. — This parifh, as well as that of Muir- 
kirk, was originally a part of the parifti of Mauchline, 
which muft have then refembled a little county more than 
a parifti. In the year 1636 the prefent church was built; 
but in the times of perfecution and diftra&amp;ion which fuc- 
ceeded, no fixed paftor was fettled till after the period of the 
Revolution. At length, however, in the year 1692, a mi- 
nister was ordained, a ftipend and glebe provided, a manfe 
and offices built, and this parifti completely and finally de- 
tached from that of Mauchline. The firft minifter who was 
fettled here was Mr Mungo Lindfay, who difcharged the 
duties of his ftation with exemplary diligence and fidelity, 
till the time of his death, which happened in 1738. Ha- 
ving no family, he bequeathed a legacy of 200 merks to 
the poor of this parifti. He was fucceeded, in due courfe, 
by Mr William Steel, whom I have already mentioned, and 
who, indeed, will long deferve to be remembered by his 
fucceflbrs, and even by the parifti at large. For he was not 
only diftinguiftied by his abilities as a preacher, and a 
fpeaker in church-courts, but alfo by his public fpirit, his 
zeal, activity, and tafte, in promoting every kind of rural 
improvement, at a time when fuch improvements were but 
little known in this part of the country. His character and 
■ talents, and the aftive part which he had taken in the caufe, 
recommended him to the choice of the General A.flembly, 
in the year 175 1, as one of their commiflioners, for the pur- 
pofe of applying to Government for a general augmenta- 
tion of the minifters ftipends throughout Scotland. This 
application was, however, entirely defeated by the warm 
oppofition of the landed intereft. On that occafion, Mr 
Steel and his fellow-commiffioners are faid to have commit- 
ted an error, which the Church of Scotland, and even the 
country in general, have reafon to regret. Though no aug- 
mentation, either in money or grain, could be obtained, yet,

it is. faid, an augmentation of the glebes might have been 
eafily procured ; but this advantage the commiffioners ne- 
glected to fecure. The value of land in Scotland was then 
fo low, that, under the chagrin which they felt from their 
failure in the main object:, they probably thought a fmall 
augmentation of glebe was a boon not worth foliciting, or 
accepting. How much are circumftances now changed ? and 
how differently would their fucceflbrs act in a limilar fitua- 
tion ? 

Mr Steel, unwilling, perhaps, to return to his native land, 
after the total overthrow of his favourite fcheme, readily 
accepted an invitation from the Proteftant Diflenters to be- 
come a preacher at Salter's Hall, London, where he foon after 
fell into a confumption, of which he died. He was fucceeded, 
in 1752, by Mr James Connel, a man of a refpedtable cha- 
racter, good fenfe, and moderation, who filled the charge 
till his death, which took place in July 1 789 ; and, in May 
1790, he was fucceeded by the prefent incumbent. 

Soon after his fettlement, Mr Steel, befide laying out a 
handfome garden of half an acre, and inclofing both it and 
the glebe with hedges, which ftill remain, for the mod part t 
in a thriving condition, likewife built, upon a very fcanty 
allowance from the heritors, and therefore, partly, at his 
own expence, a manfe, which, in point of ftrength, accom- 
modation, and neatnefs, was then hardly equalled by any 
thing of the kind in this county. The late Mr Connel, 
however, having a large family, added to the weft end of it 
a handfome wing of one floor, with a flated roof ; and, 
foon after the fettlement of the prefent incumbent, the heri- 
tors added another, at the eaft end, correfponding with 
it. Thefe additions, joined to the beauty of its fituation, 
and the interior repairs and improvements which it has 
lately received, chiefly at the expence of the incumbent, 
have rendered it both a commodious and a pleafant habita- 
tion.

tion. It affords, indeed, a ftriking inftance of the good ceo. 
nomy of building manfes, &amp;c. in a fubftantial manner, and 
upon a liberal plan, inftead of doing it, as too often happens, 
according to the loweft eftimate. While other manfes, 
within the bounds of this prefbytery, have been built and 
rebuilt, fome of them more than once, the manfe of Sorn 
has already flood firm and unbroken for nearly 60 years, 
and will probably do fo for many years to come. It like- 
wife ftill maintains a refpe&amp;able ftation among its neigh- 
bours, even in a country where the heritors have, of late, 
difplayed a commendable liberality in the building and re- 
pairing of churches and manfes. The offices are in a very 
indifferent condition, and will feon require to be rebuilt 
from the foundation. About 10 years ago, the infide of 
the church was repaired, and feated anew, and three gal- 
leries were erecled in it ; fo that it is now a very decent and 
commodious place of worfhip. 

In a fmall parilh in the neighbourhood of a town, where 
ahorfe and man-fervant can be difpenfedwith, a glebe can be 
let, and is therefore a real advantage, in proportion to the 
rent which it brings : But in a remote and extenfive parifh, 
where a horfe and man-fervant are indifpenfable, a fmall 
glebe may be confidered as a necejfary evil, becaufe the pro- 
duce is by no means equal to the expence unavoidably at- 
tending it. This was exaclly the ftate of the glebe of Sorn 
till the year 1793, when, upon a reprefentation of the cafe, 
the heritors and prefbytery readily concurred in granting an 
augmentation of 3 acres and 3 roods. In confequence of 
this augmentation, the glebe, which formerly confuted only 
of 5 acres 3 roods and 3^ falls, including the garden and fue 
of the houfes, now conlifts of 9 acres 2 roods and 3^ falls, 
which, when duly improved, will equal, or perhaps even 
a little exceed, the neceffary expence.

Ever fince the year 1757, when a fmall augmentation 
was obtained, the annual ftipend has confided of 31 bolls 
I0| pecks of meal, 16 bolls 4^ pecks of bear, and L. 44, 
c's. 7|d. Sterling, including L. 3 : 6 : 8 for communion- 
elements. A confiderable part of this ftipend is paid by 
the parilhes of Mauchline and Tarbolton ; and the whole is 
paid in a number of trifling articles, a circumftance which 
unavoidably occafions a good deal of expence and inconve- 
nience to the incumbent. William Temient, Efq; of Sorn 
is patron. 

School. — Exclufive of the fchool in Catrine, the parifh- 
fchool is the only regular and ftanding one ; but the inhabi- 
tants of the more remote diitricts occalionally unite, and 
employ teachers for the inftru&amp;ion of their own children. 
The parilh fchooi mailer has no garden, but he has a fchool 
and dwelling-houfe, both among the moft wretched that 
are to be found in any cultivated countfy. The late Mr 
James Bofwell of Auchinleck, the laft time he was in this 
country, declared his determination, to do every thing in his 
power, in order to redrefs this parochial grievance as foon 
as poffible ; but his death, which unfortunately happened 
foon after, prevented his doing any thing in the bufinefs, 
and it has not yet been taken up by any other perfon. The 
i fehoolmafter's falary is L. 8 : 6 : 8 ; and the fchool-fees are, 
- for reading 1 s. 8 d. reading and writing, 2 s. 6 d. ; writing 
i and arithmetic, 3 s. per quarter. Latin is not taught here. 
: The average number of leholars is from 25 to 30, and the 
; fehoolmafter's whole annual income, including his emolu- 
1: ments as feflkm-clerk, amounts to about L. 20.' The fchool 
is by no means in a flouriihing ftnte, and there is but little 
probability of its ever being fo, till better provirion is made 
! for the m after. 

f. Vol. XX. X Poor. 



Statiftical Account 



Poor. — In this parifli, it may truly be affirmed, that the 
poor are maintained chiefly by the poor. What the pro- 
prietors of land contribute for this purpofe, owing to their 
non-refidence, and other caufes, is but very inconfiderable. 
The poor are maintained in their own houfes ; and, befide 
occafional fupplies, the average number of penfioners upon 
the roll has, for feveral years paft, been about 22 ; who, ac- 
cording to their feveral neceflities, receive from 1 s. to 3 s. 
or 4 s. per month. The poor's funds are made up of the 
weekly colleftions in the church, fmall fines impofed on de- 
linquents, mortcloth-money, and the intereft of L. no, the 
remit of fome fmall donations, and of the favings of former 
years. Thefe articles, including one-half of the collections 
from the Chapel of Eafe in Catrine, (for it has been 
thought proper, in the infancy of that eftablifliment, to ap- 
ply the other half to different purpofes), amount altoge- 
ther to about L. 26 per annum. Thefe funds are under 
the adminiftration of the kirk-feffion, fubjed. to the occa- 
fional review of the heritors. The fum above mentioned, 
may appear to be a very {lender provifion, for the poor of 
fo extenfive and populous a parifli; but, in a country where 
the mode of living is ftill, upon the whole, fimple and fru- 
gal ; where fuel is comparatively cheap ; where there is fo 
much health, fuch abundance of employment, and fuch high 
wages for all defcriptions of people, the funds, inconfider- 
able as they are, have hitherto been found tolerably to an- 
fwer the neceffary demands. 

During the late feafons of dearth and fcarcity, no extra- 
ordinary exertions were made in favour of the poor, till win- 
ter 1795, when the greateft part of the refiding heritors, itti 
conjunction with the principal farmers and tradefmen, con- 
tributed a confiderable fum, for the purpofe of felling meal 
to the poorer families at a reduced price ; and Mr Steven- 
fon of Dalgain gave aprefent of L. 3, 3 s. to be difpofed

of by the kirk-feflion. Whatever may be the cafe hereaf- 
ter, the village of Catrine, from the variety of employment 
which its manufactures afford, from the friendly focieties 
eftablifhed in it, and from the circumftance of many of the 
families not having yet refided fo long in it as to conftitute 
them parifhioners, has hitherto been but very little burden- 
fome to the poor's funds. 

Progrefs of Improvement. — About the end of laft century, 
Mr Mitchel, then proprietor of the ellate of Dalgain, who 
had taken an active part in promoting the ecclefiaftical efta- 
blifhment of this parifh, planted an orchard * and a confi- 
derable number of foreft-trees, both which plantations fuc- 
ceeded very well. But the firfl perfon who carried rural 
improvements to any confiderable extent in this parifh, was 
the late Countefs-dowager of Loudon. This lady was daugh- 
ter to John firft Earl of Stair, and wife to Hugh Earl of 
Loudon. Befide her perfonal charms, which were very 
confiderable, fhe had acquired a large portion of thofe men- 
tal and liberal accomplifhments, which fo much adorned the 
brilliant courts of Queen Anne and George I. ; and poflef- 
fed, moreover, in a high degree, that dignity of character 
and deportment, and that vigorous and active fpirit, by 
which her brother, the celebrated ambaflador, was fo emi- 
nently diftinguifhed. After fhe took up her refidence at 
Sorn Caftle, which happened in the year 1727, this fpirit 
foon difplayed itfelf, in operations at once ufeful and orna- 
mental to the country. At that time the parifh was in a 
very uncultivated ftate, and the whole afpect of the country 

dreary 

* This orchard, by the fruit of which the tenant ufed to pay the rent of 
a confiderable farm, has, from age and negledt, gradually gone to decay, and 
is now almoft annihilated. Almoft all the other orchards in th&amp;diftridt of 
Kyle have undergone a fimilar fate.

dreary and uncomfortable. In a foil and climate where 
roads and flicker were peculiarly neceflary, not a Angle 
road or hedge, and very few trees, were to be feen. Not 
difcouraged by thefe unfavourable circumflances, (lie deter- 
mined to create a fcenc more congenial to her own talle, 
and more like the fecnes to which flie had been accuftomed 
in a better country. Accordingly, her Ikill and activity 
gradually produced an agreeable change. Bcfide enlarging 
and improving the garden and orchard, flie fubdivided an 
extcnfive farm which flie occupied hcrftlf, enclofed it with 
hedges and hedge-rows, and interfperfed it with belts and 
clumps of planting. Through the whole extent of her 
farm, flie likewife adorned the banks of the river and of the 
rivulets, with walks and plantations of various kinds of. 
trees. Thefe operations flie herfelf carefully fupei intended, , 
and many both of the fruit and foreft-trees were actually • 
planted and pruned with her own hands, and ftill remain i 
flately and pleafing monuments of her laudable induftry. . 
Thefe, her ufeful labours, did not pafs unrewarded. When 
flie firft fettled in this country, her conftitution and health . 
appeared to be entirely broken •, but, in the com fe of her r 
rural occupations, thefe were gradually re-eflablifhed, info- - 
much that, during the laft 50 years of her life, flie enjoyed! 
an uncommon fliai e of health and cheerfulnefs. After an ill- - 
nefs of a few days, flie died on the 3d of April J777, re- 
gretted by her friends and the induflrjous poor, to whom: 
flie had fo long been a benefactor. Had flie lived till the ■ 
4th of September the fame year, flie would have completed! 
the 100th year of her age. — While 1 walk through the' 
fcencs Which her tafte adorned, and under the fliade of the 
trees which her hands planted, I feel a peculiar pleaiure in. I

The example of this refpeclable lady, was afterwards fol- 
lowed fucceffively, by Mr Steel, Mr Farquhar of Gilmillf- 
croft, MrDunlop of Garnkirk, and others. Thefe improve- 
ments, however, were moitly confined to the vicinity of the 
river and the central parts of the pariih, but, in later times, 
they have been extended much farther, and in this exten- 
fion, all the more confiderable heritors have had their lhare. 
Some parts of the moorlands, and more than three-fourths of 
the arable lands, are now inclofed, in fome places with ftone- 
dikes, but for the moft part with ditches and hedges. It 
muft, indeed, be acknowledged, that, owing partly to the 
foil and climate, but much more to the want of proper at- 
tention and Ikill, few of the latter are in a thriving condi- 
tion, or fufficient to anfwer the purpofe of complete fences. 
A growing conviction of the importance of fuch fences, be- 
gins at length to excite more of the attention both of the 
proprietors and tenants, in order to procure and preferve 
them. 

In the prefent times, the moft diftinguilhed improver, be- 
yond difpute, is Claude Alexander, Efq-, §f Ballochmyle. 
The greater! part of his property, indeed, and of courfe the 
principal fcene of his improvements, lies in the parifli of 
Mauchline; where, in making roads, building bridges and 
fai-m-hcufes, planting foreft-trees, incloling, laying down, 
and ameliorating lands, he has proceeded with a rapidity, 
talte, and judgment, which have rarely been exceeded by 
a man of equal fortune in any country. In this pariih, be- 
fide highly improving his landed property, he has built the 
cotton-mills and village of Catrine, which have infufed new 
life and adlivity into this part of the country. Thefe various 
operations, he himfelf fuperintends with unwearied attention 
and activity. It is no more than juftice to acknowledge, 
too, that in every kind of public work, in which he has any 
concern, fuch as the building or repairing of churches, man- 

fes, 



t 



Statijlical Account 



fes, and fchool-houfes, he has uniformly difcovercd a laud, 
able zeal, to have every thing done in the mod fubftantial 
handfome, and liberal manner, even in cafes where the pria-; j 
cipal mare of the expence was to fall upon himfelf, 

Condition and Char after of the People. — About 7 years 
ago, poverty prevailed very generally among all claffes of 
people in this parifh, and they were not without the iaults | 
which are ufually found to accompany fuch a condition. 
Though the rents were by no means overftretched, yet veryr 
few of the tenants were able to pay them with punctuality j 
and eafe ; and very few of the tradeimen and labourers were?! 
in eafy circumltances, owing, in part, to the diffipation of 
too large a proportion of their incomes in alehoufes and I 
•whilky fhops. Since that time, however, both their condi- ; 
tion and character have been confiderably altered for the 
better. This agreeable change has been occafioned, partly ~ 
by the rife in the price of labour, and of all the produc- 
tions of agriculture, partly by the fcarcity and high price of 
fpiritous liquors, and partly by the ftrong incentives to in- - 
duftry, which the manufactures and ready-money of Ca- 
trine, together with various rural improvements, have af- 
forded. Though there are fti.ll fome exceptions, yet they r 
may now, upon the whole, be regarded as a peaceable, fo- ■ 
ber, and indultrious people, contented with their lot, toler- 
ably regular in their attendance upon public worfhip, and I 
attached to the principles of the Britifh Conftitution, by 
which they find their lives and properties fo well fecured. 
If there are any exceptions in this laft refpeft, I believe t 
rery few of them will be found among the farmers of any 
rank. Very few of the native inhabitants, have, at any time, 
inlifted into the army, and though there may have been oc- 
cafional irregularities among them, I have heard of no in- 
stance of any of them being punifhed, or even tried, for a

capital crime. The acceffion of profperity which they have 
lately experienced, feems to have hitherto proved benefi- 
cial in every view ; and if they have not yet attained that 
1 mediocrity of condition, which is moft favourable to rural 
felicity, they are daily and rapidly approaching to it. 

Advantages and Difadvantages. — From the particulars al- 
! ready ftated, it is manifeft, that this parifti poffeffes feveral 
very capital advantages ; advantages arifing from the falu- 
brity of its climate, the abundance of its peat, coal, lime, 
free-ftone, and other materials for building; from the num- 
ber of its roads and bridges, and the ready markets which 
the villages afford for its various productions. — On the other 
hand, it is fubjecled to confiderable difadvantages, by the 
wetnefs of the climate, the coldnefs and tenacity of the foil, 
the latenefs of the feed-time and harveft, and efpecially by 
the non-refidence of the greateft and wealthier!: part of the 
proprietors. I am likewife doubtful, whether I ought not 
to reckon among its difadvantages, the number of fmall 
properties, and fmall farms or pendicles, which are contain- 
ed in it. Certain it is, that, of the fmall proprietors, fome 
have lately, in "confequence of negligence and diffipation, 
been obliged, firft to mortgage, and then to fell, very fnug 
poflfeffions, of from L. 50 to L. 100 a year; while others, 
though men of fober and inoffenfive characters, yet difcover 
no fpirit of activity or enterprife. With very little exer- 
tion, they can make a fhift to exift, as their fathers did be- 
fore them, and they look for nothing further. Their lands, 
accordingly, are, for the moft part, worfe cultivated than 
thofe of the tenants, who pay a reafonable rent ; their ha- 
bitations are in fome inftances more wretched, and their 
mode of living in every refpect more uncomfortable. As 
to the occupiers of fmall farms or pendicles, they are nei- 
ther entirely farmers nor entirely labourers, and generally 

in,

in a worfe condition than either. As they are obliged to 
depend for ploughing their land, either upon hiring, ordl 
joining with fome of their neighbours, they frequently mifs ] 
the proper feafon ; and as the produce is ufually confumed 
by their families, they can feldom, without much difficulty, j| 
afford to pay even a very moderate rent. Thus they ftruggle J 
on from year to year, without either improving their pof- J 
feflions, or making any comfortable provifion for their fa- J 
milies. They contribute to the population of the country, jj 
indeed, but, in other refpecls, they contribute, I fear, but I 
little either to its happinefs or improvement. In the pof. .1 
feflion oPland, whether by property or leafe, it fhould feem, . 
that there is a certain medium which is moft favourable too 
the induftry and comfort of the poffeflbrs themfelves, and; 
to*the general improvement and produce of the country. I 
Though it be undoubtedly defirable, that there fhould be i 
both properties and farms of various dimenfions, yet the 
nearer the generality of both approach to this medium, the 
intereft of the community at large will probably be fo 
much the better fecured and promoted. Upon the whole, 
this parifli, in order to arrive at the higheft degree of rural I 
improvement of which it is capable, feems to have little 
more to do but to avail itfelf, to the utmoft, of its natural 
refources, and to extend and perfect thofe plans which are 
already begun and confiderably advanced. 

Antiquities. — On the northern, though not the higheft part 
of Blackfide-end hill, there is a large cairn of flones, with- 
out any mixture of earth, which, I think, is rather an un- 
common circumftance. At the bafe, this cairn is about 25c 
feet in circumference, and its height above the furface of 
the ground 10 feet. The ftones, which, as far as appears, 
are not large, have, with no fmall labour, been collected 
from the hill, and from the bottom of pretty deep chafms 

made 1

made by the rivulets which pour down its jGdes. Such of 
the ftones as are expofed to the weather, being over-crufled 
with grey mofe* remind me of the grey ftones fo frequently 
mentioned in the admirable poems of OlBan. At what 
time, by whom, and for what purpofe, this mafs of Hones 
was formed, it is now perhaps impoffible to difcover. It is 
not unreafonable to fuppofe, however, that under it lies the 
duft of fome mighty hero of ancient times, greatly and ex- 
tensively renowned in his day. 

The only other article worthy of notice, under this head, 
ii the Cattle of Sorn. By whom, or at what precife time, 
this caflle was built, I have not been able to afcertain ; but 
it was moll probably fome time in the courle of the 14th 
century, if not at an earlier period. The proprietors of 
this cattle, and their defcendants, Were once among the moft 
illuftrious families in the kingdom, as appears from the fol- 
lowing Ihort account, which has been obligingly communi- 
cated to me by a right honourable Lady in the neighbour- 
hood, not more diftinguifhed by her rank, than by her cha- 
racter, talents, and general information. 

" About the year 1406, the lands of Sorn, with feveral 
others in the diftrifit of Kyle, were acquired by Andrew 
Hamilton, third fon of Sir David Hamilton of Gadzow, an- 
celtor to the Duke of Hamilton. This Andrew Hamilton 
married Agnes, a daughter of Sir Hugh Campbell of Lou- 
don, Sheriff of Ajr, and by her had a fon, Sir Robert Ha- 
milton of Sorn and Sanquhar. Sir Robert married a daugh- 
ter of Sir William Crawfurd of Lochnorris j and Sir Wil- 
liam Hamilton of Sorn and Sanquhar, a fon of this marri- 
age, was one of the Senators of the College of Juftice, and 
Lord Treafurer to King James V. This Lord Treafurer 
married a daughter of the family of Caffiilis, by whom he 
had an heirefs, Ifobel Hamilton, who married George Lord 
Seton, and by him was mother to Robert fu'il Earl of Win-

ton, to Alexander firft Earl of Dunfermline, and Margaret 
the wife of Claud Hamilton, Lord Paifley, anceftor to the 
Earl of Abercom. The lands and Caftle of Sorn were fold 
by the fucceeding Earl of Winton to the family of Loudon, 
and after remaining in this family upwards of 150 years, 
they were fold to William Tennent, Efq; of Poole, in 
1782." ' 

There is a tradition well authenticated, that King James 
V. honoured his Treafurer Sir William Hamilton with a 
vifit at Sorn Caftle, on occafion of the marriage of his 
daughter to Lord Seton. The chair on which his Majefty 
fat on that occafion was always carefully preferved at the 
caftle till the i'ale of the eftate, when it was transferred to 
Loudon Caftle, where it is ftill kept as a relick of ancient 
times. It is a large chair of oak, curioufly carved ; and the 
arms of Sir William Hamilton are on the back of it in large 
figures *. 

Mr Tennent, befide repairing the old Caftle of Sorn in the 
completed manner, has lately built a large addition to it, 
neatly upon the fame plan. Among other apartments, it 
contains a very magnificent drawing-room, with a hand-

* The King's vilit at Sorn Caftk took place in winter ; and being hear- 
tily tired of his journey, through fo long a track of moor, mofs, and miry 
clay, where there was neither road nor bridge, he is reported to have laid, 
with that good humoured pleafantry which was a characleriltic of fo many 
of his family, that, " were he to play the Deil a trick, he would fend him 
from Glafgow to Sorn in the middle of winter." The trick now-a-days 
would not prove a very ferious one ; for Satan, old as he is, might travel 
very comfortably one-half of the way in a mail-coach, and the other half in 
a poft-chaife. Neither would he be forced, like King James, for want of 
better accommodation, to fit down, about mid-way, by the fide of a well, 
(hence called King's Well), and there take a cold refrefhment, in a cold 
day. At that very fame place he might now And a tolerable inn and a

forms at once a fpacious, commodious, and moft comfort- 
able manfion. This gentleman has very lately fold both 
the caftle and the eftate ; but as, from fome peculiar circum- 
ftances, it is ftill uncertain whois to be the future proprie- 
tor, it was not deemed neceflary to take any further notice 
of this change. 

Eminent Perfons. — If we except the perfonages already 
mentioned, I cannot learn that this parilh ever gave birth 
to any perfon eminently diftinguifhed in any Walk of life. 
This circumftance has not arifen from any deficiency in the 
natural talents of its inhabitants, (for in this refpecT: they 
are by no means inferior to their neighbours), but entirely 
from the want of proper means and opportunities of impro- 
ving them. Placed in a fequeftered, and, till very lately, 
a poor and uncultivated country i occupied wholly by the 
concerns of rural life, and far removed from the feats of 
learning and the fcenes of public a&amp;ion, it was but barely 
poffible that any of them fhould emerge from their native 
obfcurity, and make a mining figure in t,he world. 

" Chill penury reprefs'd their noble rage, 
" And froze the genial current of the foul," 

It may be proper, however, to mention, that Dr Mat- 
thew Stewart, late Profeffor of Mathematics in the Univer- 
fity of Edinburgh, fo well known over all Europe for his 
original genius and high attainments in geometrical fcience, 
though not a native, was an heritor, and lived many years 
in this parifh. — The ftatiftical writer, too, of fome future 
period, will, I doubt not, record, that one of the brighteft 
ornaments of the fame univerfity, and, at the fame time, one 
of the moft amiable men of the prefent age,.if not born in 
this parilh, yet paffed a great part of his early life in it, and

laid the foundation of thofe fpeculations, by which he is now 
enlightening and charming the minds of fo many of onr 
JBritifh youth. 

It will naturally be expeclcd, that, on this occafion, I 
Should take fome notice of Mr Alexander. Pedtn, a clergy- 
man of the laft century, who was a native of this parifh, 
where fome of his collateral defcendants ftill remain. He 
was deftined to live in the perilous and miferablc times 
which intervened between the Restoration and the Revolu- 
tion ; (times in which the rights of conscience were too 
little underftood and regarded by either party) ; and lie had 
an ample fhare in the fufierings in which the Prefbyterians 
of Scotland were th$n involved, by the cruel and mifgnided 
policy of the unfortunate houfe of Stewart*. In the year 
1663, he was fettled as minifter of the church and pariih of 
New Glenluce in Galloway, and after remaining about 
three years in this ftation, he was forced, by the violence of 
perfecution, to abandon it. He Ikulked about from 1666 
till 1673, when he was apprehended, and confined a prison- 
er, fometimes in Edinburgh, and fometimes on the Bafs, 
till December 1678, when he, together with feveral other 
perfons, were condemned to be tranfported to Virginia, 
and with that view were actually conveyed by fea to Lon- 
don. Soon after their arrival there, however, they were 
let at liberty, probably in confequence of the interpofition 

of 

* The profeflcd object of this policy was to eftablifh an uniformity of 
opinion and practice in matters of religion ; an object which it is utterly 
unpoffible ever to attain ; and which, if really attained upon any other 
ground than that of abfolute perfection in knowledge, would prove a curie 
to mankind inftead of a bleffing. Indeed, the conduct of men muft invari. 
My prove abfurd and pernicious, where it aims at ends which thwart the 
p.ftablifhed laws of providence. Their true wifdom mull ever eonfift in un- 
derftanding thofe laws, and making them the rules of their expectations and 
pf their conduct.

of fome powerful friends. But though thus faved from 
tranfportation to a foreign land, Mr Peden was by no means 
permitted to live in peace at home. He was ftill an objed 
of vengeance, and hunted about from place to place. He 
found a retreat fometimes in Ireland and fometimes in 
Scotland, till at length, in January 1686, death put a pe- 
riod to his fufferings and his dangers, in the 60th year of hi3 

But the fpirit of perfecution, whether Catholic or Prote- 
ftant, whether Epifcopalian or Prefbyterian, is feldom fatis- 
fied with the death of the obje&amp; which it purfues. It wilhes 
alfo to deftroy the foul in hell ; but, fecretly confcious of its 
inability to gratify fuch wifhes, it endeavours to fatiate its 
implacable fury by outrages on the body. This a&amp;ually 
happened in the cafe now under confideration. The body 
of Mr Peden, after being buried about fix weeks in the 
church-aifle belonging to the family of Auchinleck, was 
raifed from its grave, and, as a mark of ignominy, carried 
to the village of Old Cumnock, and there interred at the 
foot of the gallows. His fincere and fervent piety, his zeal, 
conftancy, and fufferings, in what was generally deemed the 
caufe of truth and liberty ; thefe virtues, joined to a good 
deal of fagacity in forming probable conjectures refpecling 
the future, and to fomething fententious and oracular in his 
manner and converfation, all confpired to gain him the re- 
putation of a prophet among the common people of this 
country, both in his own and fucceeding times; a diftinc- 
tion which he enjoyed in common with feveral others of his 
contemporaries and affociates. That the gracious Ruler of 
the world may, on fome particular occafions, impart to 
thofe who are fuffering feverely in a good caufe, previous 
intimations of future events, in which their own fate or 
that of their oppreffors is deeply concerned,- it would, I 
think, be rafh and unwarrantable pofitively to deny. In

general, however, the gifts of prophecy and of difcerning 
fpirits, which were fo fondly afcribed to Mr Peden an4 i 
fome of his fellow-fufFerers, will not eafily be admitted by 
thinking men in the prefent age ; efpecially when it is re. 
collected, that thefe gifts were fometimes exercifed in detec- 
ting and expofing witches. But whatever errors and im- 
perfections a more enlightened and peaceable age may dif- 
cover in the principles and conduct of this good man, and 
in thofe who acted and fuffered with him, they will always 
be entitled to the efteem and gratitude of their countrymen, 
not only on account of the high virtues which they poflef- 
fed, but alfo on account of the (hare which they had in pre- 
paring the way for the eflablifliment of our civil liberties 
by the Revolution, and in maintaining, at the expence of a . 
thouland hardftiips and perils, our Kcclefiajlical conftitution i 
a conftitution which, though like that of moft other Chri- 
ftiaB focieties, built perhaps upon too narrow a foundation, 
has, neverthelefe, at a very fmall expence, been in feveral 
refpects eminently ferviceable to the country. 

Though, therefore, this conftitution be not without its 
enemies, and though even the rock of poverty, on which it 
was faid, by a celebrated ftatefman, to be founded, be not 
abfolutely impregnable, yet it is to be hoped, that when its 
bafts is extended a little, it may ftill ftand immoveable for 
ages, and prove a rock of defence to folid learning, found 
morals, facred truth, and rational liberty, both civil and re- 
ligious.

ACCOUNT OF THE 

VILLAGE OF CATRINE. 



By the Rev. Mr Robert Steven Minijler. 



Village of Catrine, 

npHE village of Catrine takes its name from the lands 
-*- both on the north and fouth fide of the river of Ayr. 
It is fituated on the north fide of the river, and on the we- 
fterh extremity of the parilh of Sorn. Its fituation is ro- 
mantic and delightful. The banks on both fides being well 
wooded, defend it from almoft every wind that blows. Few 
places in the fame latitude, and fo far inland, (being 14 
miles from the feaport-town of Ayr), can boaft of a warmer 
elimate. It is generally a fortnight earlier than any other 
part of the parifh. The accefs to it is from the north and 
fouth. But as there is only a wooden bridge over the ri- 
ver, for the accommodation of foot- travellers, in time of 
floods it is inacceffible by horfes or carriages from that 
quarter. — The village is of an oblong form -, in the middle 
of which there is a fguare of 300 feet, with ftreets leading 

'from 



176 



Statijlical Account 



from it on the eaft, fouth, and weft ; and from which there 
are feveral crofs ftreets, at right angles #. 

Manufa&amp;ures. — Catrine is entirely a new creation, and 
owes its exiftence to the flourilhing ftate of the cotton ma- 
nufacture in Great Britain. In the year 1787, Mr Alex- 
ander of Ballochmyle, the proprietor of the village, in part- 
nerftiip with the patriotic Mr Dale of Glafgow, built a cot. 
ton twift-mill in the centre of the above fquare, with a fall 
of water, from the dam-head to where it returns again to 
the river, of 46 feet. A jeanie factory and a corn-mill are 
drove by the fame fall. It is likewife propofed to erect a 
waulk or fulling mill on this ftream of water. The twift- 
mill confifts of 5 fquare ftories, belides garrets ; and contains 
5240 fpindles, which are all going at prefent (December • 
1796). Three hundred and one perfon.s, old and young, 
are juft now employed, in carding, roving, and in fpinning, 
with an overfeer and two clerks : Clock-makers, fmiths, 
mill- wrights, and other mechanics, amount to 15 more. 
The women, who pick cotton in their own houfes, are at 
prefent 226. In all, belonging to the twift-mill, by laft re- 
turn, 445, Of thefe, 118 are under 12 years of age; 128 
are between 12 and 20 ; and 200 are above 20 years of age. 
The total amount of wages paid from October 30. 1795, 
to October 28. 1796, is L. 3193 Sterling ; and, as far as can 
be afcertained, the average quantity of cotton fpun weekly 
is 2660 libs. In the year 1790, the fame company built a 
jeanie factory, which contains 76 jeanies. The carding, 
roving, &amp;c are performed by the tail-water of the twift- 
mill. Here 200 perfons, including an overfeer, two clerks, 

and 

* The proprietor binds all thofe who feu in the principal ftreet, (which 
is 66 feet wide, with the tail-water of the twift-mill, running through thf 
centre of it), to build their houfes two ftories high, and to flate them*

and mechanics, find conftant employment, be fides 55 wo- 
men who pick cotton in their own houfes. Forty-three ate 
under 12 years of age ; 72 from 12 to 20 ; the reft are above 
20 years of age. The -wages per week are about L. 80 Sterling. 

Children are not admitted into the work under 9 years 
old ; and they all lodge with their parents or friends. It is 
but juftice to add, that both old and young enjoy uniform- 
ly good health. The different apartments are kept as clean 
and free of duft as poflible ; and ftated hours are allowed for 
amufement and exercife. The writer of this Report can 
fafely declare, that during his refidence here, (fince 1791), 
he has met with fewer difeafes of any kind than might rea- 
fonably have been expected among the fame number of 
people, engaged in any other employment. 

One caufe of health, among the people in thefe cotton- 
works, may be afcribed to a plan of farming, on a fmaM 
fcale, which Mr Alexander has judicioufly introduced. He 
makes the overfeer of his farm fet off annually from 15 to 
25 acres of ground, according to the quantity of dung the 
villagers may have faved in the courfe of the year. The 
dung or alh.es is led out at his expence ; and he ploughs and 
harrows the ground with his own horfes. On the land thus 
thoroughly prepared, they plant a fufficient quantit}' of po- 
tatoes for their winter's provifion. They pay him from 
4d. to 6 d. per fall, according to the quality of the ground. 
The dreffing of thefe potatoes is the employment of both 
old and young on the fummer evenings, after they are dif- 
miffed from the mills. The exercife, and fmell of the new 
turned-up earth, muft undoubtedly be beneficial to their 
health ; and their emulation to have the beft and cleaned 
crop renders them all very induftrious. It is an extreme- 
ly pleafant fight, on a fine fummer 's evening, to fee fuch a 
number of people fo ufefully employed. The proprietor of 
the lands, too, finds his advantage in it. 

Vol. XX. Z The

Statijlical Account 



The change which a few years have produced in the ap. 
pearance of the ground, in the vicinity of this manufacturing 
village, is truly aftonilhing. Some years ago, Mr Alexan- 
der made a number of fmall inclofures, in the immediate 
neighbourhood of the village, for the accommodation of 
thofe inhabitants who wilhed to keep milch-cows. He dref- 
fed them with potatoes on the above plan ; and, after ta- 
king a crop of beer or barley, with the fucceeding hay-crop, 
he let them out by the year in grafs, at L. i, 13 s. per acre. 
The fame land did not yield him formerly 10 s. per acre, 
on a 19 years leafe. Within thefe few weeks, he has fown 
down a field, of about 13 or 14 acres, with wheat, which 
produced a crop of potatoes laft fummer, dreffed by the vil- 
lagers. 

Mr Alexander retains a farm of fome hundred acres in his 
own hands ; but as it, and the moft of his landed property, 
lie in the neighbouring parilh of Mauchline, a defcription of 
his fpirited improvements, as a farmer, does not fall to my 
province. 

Weaving is only in its infancy here ; however, a hundred 
looms are erected, but they are feldom all occupied at the 
fame time. At prefent 91 are at work, and are chiefly 
employed by the cotton manufacturers in Glafgow and 
Paifley. The yarn fpurt here is fent to Glafgow weekly by 
the Company's carrier. 

A brewery was built in the year 1793, by the proprie- 
tor of the village, and let to a very refpedlable gentleman in 
Kilmarnock, with a view to introduce malt-liquor in place 
of whilky, which has fo baneful an effect on the morals of 
the people. It gives me pleafure to add, that this benevo- 
lent fcheme has, in a great degree, anfwered its purpofe ; 
for nearly 500 bolls of malt are brewed annually. The 
brewery is not completed ; fov only a part of the original 

plan 



of Sorn. 



179 



plan was at firft executed, from the uncertainty of its fuc- 
cefs. 

Population. — Catrine contains in all 1350 fouls — 650 
males, and 700 females. Thirty-feven of thefe are Anti- 
burgher, and 278 are Burgher Seceders, who attend divine 
fervice in their refpeftive churches, at Auchinleck and 
Cumnock. The number of births cannot be accurately af- 
certained ; for the Seceders here, as in mod other places 
through Scotland, do not regifter their childrens names in 
the fefTion-records. However, at an average, for the 4 pre- 
ceding years, 40 children belonging to the Eftabliuied 
Church have been annually baptized. No account can be 
given of the deaths ; for although it is part of the original 
plan of the village, as yet there is no churchyard here, and 
(he inhabitants bury in all the neighbouring parifhes. Ten 
couple are married annually. To account for the difpro- 
portion between the births and marriages, give me leave to 
add, that the great body of the inhabitants were married be- 
fore they came to refide in this place ; and many of the 
young people, of both fexes, marry in other parifhes. 

In the year 1793, the inhabitants confifled of 160 1 fouls; 
of courfe, the Company have, at prefent, a great many emp- 
ty houfes; for which, if they could find tenants, they and 
their families would be fully employed. — Exclufive of thofe 
engaged in the cotton manufacture, there are the following 
mechanics, viz. 3 blackfmiths ; 6 houfe-carpenters ; 7 ma- 
fons; 7 tailors ; 6 fhoemakers ; 1 dyer; 1 flaxdrefier; 1 ba- 
ker; 2 butchers; 91 weavers, including apprentices ; 2 faw- 
ers ; 1 corn-miller ; 3 brewers, including the clerk ; 15 day. 
labourers ; 7 fhopkeepers ; and 7 or 8 alehoufes. 

The prices of provifions, wages, &amp;c. are nearly the fame 
as in the country part of the parifh. 

Fexv 



1 80 Statijlical Account 

Few examples of fo rapid an increafe of population are 
to be found; lor in the year 1787, two or three thatched 
houfes occupied the place where this thriving village now 
{lands. 

Charafter of the People. — In fuch a multitude, collected 
from different parts of the kingdom, we may reafonably 
expect to find fome of very exceptionable morals. To pre- 
vent, however, the worthlefs, as much as poffible, from ob- 
taining an eftablifhment, certificates are required from the 
refpective parilhes in which they laft refided. The per- 
fons who work in the twin-mill and jeanie factory, are 0* . 
bliged to pay unwearied attention to their different depart- 
ments •, which, perhaps, has no fmall influence in counter? 
acting the bad habits they may have acquired in an idler 
fcene of life. Their fobriety is at leaft equal, if not fupe- 
rior, to their neighbours in the different villages. It may 
not, however, be improper to remark, that this regularity 
is chiefly owing to the indefatigable attention of Mr Alex- ; 
ander. He endeavours to learn the real character and cir- . 
cumftances of each individual ; and whilft he gives every 
encouragement to the fober and induftrious, he difmifles the 
riotous and idle, as unworthy to eat the Company's bread. 
Permit me to add, that fuperior penetration and prudence 
mark all the operations of this fpirited and truly patriotic 
gentleman. 

Church and School. — From this increafe of population, - 
the parifh church could not nearly accommodate the inha- 
bitants •, therefore, in the year 1792, a fubfeription for 
building a Chapel of Eafe here was fetonfoot. Its promi- 
iing appearance at firft, induced Mr Alexander to feu out 
ground for the fite of the chapel ; and he himfelf fubferibed 
for the mafonry of it. The building was accordingly ber 

gun 



of Sorn.

igun in the fpring of that year, and liniflied in the fpring fol- 
lowing. The houfe meafures 80 feet long, by 524- wide 
over the walls. It has alfo a large projection in front, for 
\L flairs to the galleries, and for the fteeple, when they lhall 
[be erected. Many of the fubfcribers failed to pay the amount 
of their fubfcriptions. There was not more than L. 80 Ster- 
ling of the whole collected. Mr Alexander, therefore, ad- 
vanced above L. 750 Sterling on the fecurity of the feat- 
rents, but has not, as yet, received a lingle farthing of either 
nprincipal or intereft. Had feuing gone on as brilkly as it 
;did previous to the year 1793, it is prefumedthis gentleman 
qwouid have been reimburfed in a few years for this great 
[joutlay ; but the fcarcity of hands, all over the country, has 
^put an entire flop to feuing. Indeed, the population of the 
Ivillage has decreafed confiderably lince that period, as men- 
jjtioned in another part of this Report. The feats erected in 
ithe area of the chapel, have never yet been completely fil- 
lllcd. When the galleries are put up, the chapel will con- 
tain above 1500 fitters. It is beautifully fituated on riling 
ground, which commands a view of the whole village and 
the furrounding banks. It is efteemed a great ornament to 
the place. 

The author of this Report, was ordained, by the Prefby- 
tery of Ayr, to ferve the cure, on the 12th of September 
1792. The living is only L. 60 annually, without manfe 
or glebe ; a fum perfectly inadequate to the neceffary ex- 
pences of a clergyman. The {lender funds of this infant 
eftablifhment, cannot admit of an augmentation of ftipend. 
If properly reprefented, the Company would probably al- 
low at leaft a free houfe. 

The Company pay a very laudable attention to the mo- 
rals and education of youth. They have built a large fchool- 
room, and appointed a fchoolmafter, with an annual falary 
of L. 1 j Sterling, and a free houfe, equal to L. 3, 5 s. more ; 

for 



i8z 



Statijlical Account 



for which he teaches the children employed in the work k 
from 7 to 9 o'clock in the evening. The emoluments of 
his day-fchool will amount to L. 15 annually. He is allow, 
ed an afliftant for the evening-fchool, who receives from the* 
Company L. 5 yearly. The afliftant is employed in thee 
twift-mill, during the day, as under-clerk. The teachers'- 
meet the children in fchool on Sabbath mornings, catechife t| 
them, and conduct them to church ; and the Company pay 
for their feats. 

Difeafes. — No difeafe is peculiar to the place. A few 
die of confumptions and fevers. It gives me pleafure to  
add, that inocculation for the fmall-pox almoft univerfally ?! 
prevails. 

Antiquities. — According to tradition a Popifh chapel 1 
once liood a little to the eaft of the village. It was proba- \ 
bly dedicated to St Cuthbert; for the furrounding field, (in 
the form of an amphitheatre), is called StCuthbert's Holm. 
At the upper end of this field, part of a ftreet is built, for 
the accommodation of the manufacturers. The fnppo- 
fed fite of the chapel and churchyard has, for years paft, I 
been under tillage. In removing a large cairn of ftones, at : 
a fmall diftance from the place, 7 or 8 large urns were 
found, full of human duft and bones : they fell to pieces on 
being expofed to the open air. They were formed in the 
rudeft manner, and had evidently been dried in the fun. 
Tradition fays, the plague was buried there. The proba- 
bility, however, is, that St Cuthbert's Holm was once the 
fcene of a very bloody battle, perhaps before the introduc- 
tion of Chriftianity into Scotland ; for the bones found in 
the urns, and every where in the cairn, had evidently been 
burned. 

Minerals. 



of Sow. 



Minerals. — In this holm there is alfo an inexhauftible bed 
lof free-ftone. It is eafily wrought, and is of a durable qua- 
lity. As lime is at a fmall diftance, building is perhaps as 
icheap here as in mod places in the kingdom. Several coal- 
jpits are wrought, at the diftance of a or 3 miles. Indeed, 
the village moft probably ftands on coal. 

Means of Improvement. — A Hone-bridge over the river 
of Ayr, to open the communication to the fouth, would not 
only be of great utility to the place, but to the public at 
large. It would alfo be much for the advantage of Catrine 
if it were erected into a burgh of barony, when there would 
be a bailie or magiftrate on the fpot, to decide petty caufes, 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — There is no market-day 
here. The farmers around fell the produce of their lands 
to the fhopkeepers, who fupply the inhabitants by retail. 
They, inftead of being obliged, as formerly, to carry the 
produce of their farms to Kilmarnock or Ayr, at the di- 
ftance of 12 or 14 miles, find a ready, and an equally ad- 
vantageous, market for it at their own doors. This is not 
only an immenfe faving of time, but alfo of the neceffary 
expence of carriage. Butter-milk, and whey, which were, 
before the commencement of the cotton trade here, of little 
ufe, now bring ready money to the farmer. In this view, 
manufactures muft prove highly beneficial to the public, and 
to the hulbandman in particular. Urged by the ftrongeft of 
all motives, gain, he will highly improve thofe fields which 
formerly lay neglected and barren. The lower clafles of 
people and their families, who, a few years ago, were idle, 
for want of employment, now find abundance of work, 
with good wages ; of courfe, they are well lodged, and fed 
and clothed in a comfortable manner. In fliort, thefe cot- 
ton-works 



184 Statijlical Account 

ton-works have infpired the whole country with induftry 
and exertion for feveral miles around. 

Although we have two butchers, little butcher-meat is 
killed in the place : at certain feafons, we are fupplied from 
Ayr and Kilmarnock. A butcher of knowledge, and a 
little ready money, would find this an advantageous fitua- 
tion for his profefiion. A mail-gardener is much wanted : 
greens and roots are brought on Saturdays from Kilmar- 
nock, at the diftance of 12 miles. There are feveral very 
proper places for a garden of this kind, in the vicinity of 
the village, and which Mr Alexander, for the good of the 
place, would let on reafonable terms to a man of character. 
There are 30 feuer6 in the village. From the commence- 
ment of the cotton -manufacture here, to the year 1789, the 
rate of feuing was 4 d. per fall, for a houfe and yard ; from 
that period to this, it has been 6 d. per fall. The feu is 
perpetual. — A room 16 feet by 14 lets at L. 1, 10 s. ; or, 
when finilhed in a fuperior ftile, L. 2 annually. The great 
road from Dumfries to Glafgow, by Sanquhar, Old Cum- 
nock, Mauchline, 8cc. paffes the village, in lefs than a quar- 
ter of a mile. Mauchline is the neareft poft-town, and di- 
ftant 3 miles. — Perfons accidentally hurt in the Company's 
fervice are allowed medical affiftance, and their full wage-, 
till they recover. 

On account of the importance of this new eftablifhmerit, 
and the attention paid to the health and comfort of its in- - 
habitants, it was thought proper to lay before the reader,

of the particulars therein contained.

PARISH OF <name ref="NA">KIRKOWEN</name>. 

(County of Galloway, Synod of Glasgow and Ayr, 
Presbytery of Wigton.) 



By the Rev. John Dickson, Minijltr.</head> 



<p>KIRKOWEN is evidently fo called from fome perfon of 
the name of Owen, to whom probably the church was 
originally dedicated. 

Situation and Extent.-— The parifh is fituated in the coun- 
ty of Galloway, and prefbytery of Wigton. It is forae- 
what of a triangular figure, and of very confiderable extent. 
Its length, from north-weft to fouth-eaft, is about 15 
miles. Its greateft breadth is between 6 and *j miles - r 
and its fmalleft breadth is not much above 1. On the north 
and eaft, it is bounded by the parifti of Penninghaip ; on 
the fouth and eaft, by the parilh of Kirkinner ; on the fouth 
and weft, by the parifties of Mochrum, Old and New Luce} 

and 



of Rirkowen.

and on the north and weft, by that divifion of Ayrfhire 
called Carrick. 

Riven. — The river Bladenoch runs along the north-eaflt 
fide of this parilh, and forms a natural boundary between it 
and the parifh of Penningham. This river rifes from a 
lake called Loch Macbeary, fituated moftly between the 
two parilhes of Kirkowen and Penningham; but a frmll 
part of it extends beyond the Galloway march, into Car- 
rick. There are feveral fmall iflands in it, upon the lar- 
geft of which are the remains of a confiderable building, 
and fmall garden ; but, at prefent, thefe iflands are famous 
only as the habitation of fome eagles, which have chofen, 
them as a place of fafety. The river, which has its fource 
in this lake, runs in a fouth-eafl: direction for about two- 
thirds of its length, after which it takes a more eafterly 
courfe, and empties itfelf into the Bay of Wigton. Its 
whole length, abftraclnng from the windings of the river, is 
about 24 miles. Tarf is another river, on the fouth-wefl; 
fide of the parilh, which rifes from a bog in Carrick, which, 
after a courfe of about 12 miles, crofles the parifh to the 
eaftward, and joins Bladenoch a little to the fouth-eaft of 
this church. 

Roads — The military road from Carlifle to Port-Patrick 
crofles the parifli, about 2 miles to the northward of the pa- 
rifh church. Befides this, feveral roads have been made 
fince an act of Parliament was paffed for converting the fta- 
tute-labour of the county into money. This act has alrea- 
dy produced very good effects, and, in time, will turn out 
ftill more beneficial. 

Soil. — The furface of this diftricT is various, confifting of 
moorlands interfperfed with plots of arable ; but the greateft 

part 



i88 



Statijlical Account 



part is moor. The foil of the arable land, in the north- 
weft end of the parifh, is cold and thin, and produces little 
other kind of grain than black oats. The arable land, in the 
fouth-eaft end of the parifh, is of a better quality, and bears 
a greater proportion to the pafture land than in the other 
end. In general, it is a light, dry, ftoney foil, which, after 
lime or dung, yields excellent crops of oats or barley. Lime 
has been bqt very lately introduced here as a manure ; but 
fince the improvement of our roads, very confiderable quan- 
tities of it have been ufed in this way. It is brought to us, 
in the ftate of fhells, from Whitehaven, and drawn to the 
land moftly in fingle-horfe carts. Some of the farmers have 
to carry it to the diftance of 10 or iz miles ; and the fmall- 
eft diftance of any of them to a fea-port is not lefs than 6. 
The grain raifed in the parifh is confiderably more than fuf- 
ficient to fupply the inhabitants. 

Cattle. — The horfe and cattle bred in this diftrift, require 
no particular defcription, as they are well known over a 
great part of the ifland by the name of Galloways, and are 
allowed every" where to be excellent of their kind. The 
number of horfes in the parifh is about 200 ; the black- 
cattle amount to about 1600 •, and the fheep to near 
10,000. Wedders of 3 and 4 years old, weigh from 38 to 
42 libs. Our wool is of different qualities ; but thafwhich 
is got from the fheep which feed upon the fells is reckoned 
the fineft. There are feveral of thefe fells in this parilb ; 
but none of them deferves a particular defcription. It is 
probable, however, that one of them, upon the Carrick 
march, has a greater elevation above the level of the fea 
than any other land in this county. 

Rent. — An account of the rent of this parilh was given in 
to the Court of Teinds about 36 years ago, when the fum fo 

flatci 



of Kirkowen. 



ftated was L. 820. The prefent incumbent, in 1792, ftated 
the rent to the fame Court at fomewhat above L. 2200. 
Since that time the rent has been confiderably advanced. 
The increafe of the rental, in the period above mentioned, is, 
no doubt, principally owing to the increafe of prices. The 
enlargement of farms, and the farmer's better manage- 
ment of his flocks, have likewife had their effect, in railing 
the value of lands in their poffeffion. The mode of ma- 
nagement among the farmers, for fome time paft, has been^ 
to keep fewer beafts, and to feed them better. The far- 
mer, no doubt, finds his account in purfuing this plan, and, 
of courfe, part of the profit will go to the proprietor. A 
fimilar obfervation will hold good with refpect to the en- 
largement of farms. The perfon who emplovs the greateft 
flock in trade can afford to deal upon the leaft profit. 

Population. — The population of this parifh has evidently 
decreafed within thefe 40 years. According to my prede- 
ceffor's account, about that time it amounted to 800 fouls. 
At prefent it is fomewhat below 700. The population of 
a village at the church has confiderably increafed during 
the period above mentioned ; of courfe, the decreafe of po- 
pulation has happened folely among the poiTeffors of landi 
This is eafily accounted for from the enlargement of farms. 
The fame farm which formerly contained feveral tenants, 
is now, in moft places, occupied by one only. Though our 
population has decreafed in the courfe of 40 years, yet for 
a conliderable time of the latter part of that period it ap- 
pears to have been ftationary. The average number of 
births exceed that of funerals ; but the furplus of our popu- 
lation goes to fupply or increafe the population of other 
places. The return to Dr Webfter in 1755, was 795 
fouls. 

Poor, 



190 



Statijlical Account 



Poor.—- There are no funds mortified for the poor of this 
parifh : they are chiefly fupported by the weekly collection 
at the church ; but when this fund falls fliort of the pur. 
pofe, they are further aflifted by other charitable donations 
from the people, who are always ready to liften to the calls 
of humanity. In this manner they are fupplied, according 
to their different neceflities, when in health, and properly 
taken care of when lick. 

Birds and Fijhes. — There are no birds here, either native 
or migratory, but fuch as are common to this part of the 
ifland. It only deferves notice, that groufe and black game 
abound both in tins and the neighbouring parifhes. The 
nfhes to be found here, are, falmon, trout, pike, eels, fome 
perches, and lampreys. The falmon come up our rivers 
when they are fwelled by the rains, and are chiefly caught 
in nets. They are not, however, taken in fuch quantity as 
to be cured for exportation ; but are partly confumed in 
the parilh, and partly fold in the neighbouring towns. 
Trout and pike not only abound in the rivers of Bladenoch 
and Tarf, but likewife in the lakes and dreams, of which 
there are a confiderable number in this parifh. Eels are 
not fought after, though it is well known that they might 
be caught in great numbers, when they come down from 
the lakes, in the latter end of harveft, to fpawn. Perches 
having been but lately introduced into Bladenoch, are as 
yet very fcarce. The lamprey is but a rare fpecies in this 
place, and rather avoided than fought after by the nlher- 
men, from an apprehenfion that their bite is fo highly ma- 
lignant as to be incurable. 

Tumuli, %£c. — There is a green tumulus in this parifli, 
about a mile diflant from the church. Thefe tumuli are 
generally now confidered as monuments raifed over the 

dead.

dead. Few, however, or almoft none, have been opened in 
the tfland, to afcertain this faft. I faw one in this county- 
opened, in which there was found a great number of hu- 
man bones. There were two white cairns opened in this 
parifh } in the middle of each there was found a grave, 
formed of flag-ftones, containing an urn with burnt bones in 
it. — In the tumulus, the bodj had been buried in the earth ; 
in the cairns, the body had been moftly confumed by fire 
before burial. 

To conclude, this parifh, after fupplying its inhabitants, 
affords a confiderable quantity of grain, great numbers of 
Iheep and black-cattle, and a confiderable quantity of wool, 
to be difpofed of annually in other markets. Befides thefe 
primary advantages, it affords abundance of amufement to 
the fportfman and the angler.

(County of Elgin and Forres, Synod of Moray, 
Presbytery of Forres.) 



By the Rev. John Dunbar.</head> 



<p>QlNCE the union of thefe parilhes in 1618, cuftom has 
*^ comprehended the annexed parilh of Moy under the 
name of the other, both pariOies now reforting to one 
church at Dyke. The feparate parifhes had their names 
from the villages where their refpedlive churches were firft 
erected ; and thefe being of Gaelic derivation, are fufficient- 
ly defcriptive of local circumftances. 

Names and their Derivation. — Dik, or Dyk, as it was 
written of old, is from Dig, a water-drain or ditch. Lefly 
Bilhop of Rofs, in the 9th book of his Hiftory, calls this 

village 



of Dyke and Moy, 193 



village a municipium ; but no traces of any municipal pri- 
vileges now remain. 

Moy is from Maigb, a plain ; which being remarkable 
for its fine level extent and fertility, is, by way of diftinc- 
tion, called the Moy, and formerly the Mey. In this plain 
were two diftincl contiguous eftates, now veiled in one pro- 
prietor, called the Eafter and Wefter Mey. Each of thefe 
had a village of its own name. In the village and lands of 
Eafter Moy * flood a prebendary church. The burial- 
ground around it is yet in ufe. 

Bearing and Situation. — This united parifli, by an obser- 
vation taken at the fhore, is in 57 0 26' 21" north latitude. 
It lies in the fynod of Moray, the prefbytery of Forres, and 
county of Elgin and Forres; being fituated on the foutli 
coaft of the Moray Frith, and on the weft fide of the river 
Findern, excepting only the lands of Upper and Nether 
Buchtalies, and the lands of Moy Carfe, on the right fide, or 
eaft of that river. It is the moft wefterly coaft parifh in the 
prefbytery or county to which it belongs ; being weft of the 

Vol. XX. B b parifhes 

• * Eafter Moy is one of thofe infulated diftricts which has been append- 
ed to a different county from that wherein it lies, and is fubject to the ju- 
rifdiction of the county of Nairn, becaufe it had belonged to the Thanes of* 
Calder while they were hereditary Sheriffs of Nairn. There are many in- 
ftances, both in South and North Britain, of particular fpots fo connected 
with diftant counties, that are in fome cafes very remote. Such appendages 
were made per annexationem, after the introduction of the feudal fyftem, 
to gratify the haughty fpirit of the feudal Barons, who would neither reiide, 
nor let their vaffals live, under any otlier jurifdiction but their own. If the 
act verting heritable jurifdietions in the Crown has not already made iuitabfe 
provision, exprefs or implied, for a more near and ready adminiftration of 
juftice, againft the inhabitants of lands alid tenements annexed to remote 

counties, tb^e aforefaid encroachments of the feudal fyftem, on the former di- 
vifions of the kingdom, may be productive, in fome cafes, of inconvei;iencies, 

not undeferving the notice of the LegiCatwe.

parifhes of Kinlofs and Forrefs ; north of Edinkellie ; and 
caft of the parifli of Auldearn and county of Nairn. It is 
an irregular four-cornered figure, running up the Frith for 
about 6 miles along more, from that corner oppofite to Fin- 
dern harbour, till it reaches the mouth of the Ellands Bourne, 
over againft the opening into Cromarty Bay. From thence 
another of its boundaries ftretches up through the eafter end 
of the Hardmoor *, in a foutherly direction, for a great way 
into another heath, called the Broad Shaw. This boundary, 
irom the fhore, feparates the barony of Brodie and Torre'f- 
try lands, in this parifli, from the lands of Inftiough, Bog- 
hole, and Moynes, in the parifli of Auldearn, and county 
of Nairn. The other boundaries are too irregular for de- 
fcription. 

Extent and Contents. — The fuperficial extent of this irre- 
gular figure may be about 21 fquare miles; containing- 
3697 Scots acres of corn-field, 1191 acres of natural and 
planted wood, and the reft in pafture, heath, and exhaulted 
mofies, with a fandy defert all along the fliore; which defert 
is a full half of the whole contents. There are evident marks' 
of an early population in different places of this extenfive 
and deferted track, which has been entirely flat, till over- 
whelmed by fand from the fea. Qn the outfide of this 
fandy defert there is a high bank, which may be traced al-

fomewhere a folitary fpot of clajic ground, unheeded here, but much re- 
nowned in Drury, for the Thane of Glammis's interview with the Wayward" 
or Weird Sifters, in what fome editions call the Harmore icene of the tra- 
gedy of Macbeth. Here the inventive genius of Shakefpeare, fo predomK 
nant in the fupernatural and fublime, catching the hint from old tradition, 
has conjured up a night-piece of infernal horror, well adapted to fuggeft" 
the hellilh purpofe, and forward the bloody work, that fet the Ufurpcr oai 
the throne.

moft to Invernefs. This bank has, in many places, limit- 
ed the inundation. 

Above this bank, to the fouth-eaft, there is another ex- 
•tenfive plain, of moorifli ground, which has been turfed to 
the gravel. Though unfit for culture, it is well adapted to 
the production of firs. It has been tried with fuccefs fince 
the commons were divided, and will now be enclofed and 
planted without delay. 

Surface. — In the eafter end of the parilh, the cultivated 
lands are uncommonly flat and fmooth ; but, upwards from 
the moor laft mentioned, the cultivated land, in the wefter 
end, rifes in a gentle acclivity toward the fouth. 

The furface of the cultivated parts, is agreeably diverfifi- 
■ed with flats and eafy Hopes, and beautified by the wind- 
ings of running-water, fkirted with natural wood. There 
are clumps upon eminences ; trees about farm-fteads -, gen- 
tle mens feats finely fituated, with gardens, orchards, and 
, "hedged inclofures around them ; and the whole is furround- 
ed with thriving plantations, rifing one above another, with 
a variety of made and profpeft, which gives the inland parts 
an appearance that may be called pidurefque. 

Soil.— The foil, which has been much exhaufted by an 
early culture, and a long continuance of inceffant cropping, 
is in fome places a brown, and in others a Iblack loam, ge- 
nerally light, kindly, and of eafy culture. At prefent it is 
more remarkable for fure and early crops of well filled 
grain, than for many returns of the feed, which is liberally 
bellowed at a boll or upwards per acre, to keep down 
weeds ; fo that the average of crops cannot be ftated at more 
than 3i or 4 returns. The ground is not enough retentive 
of moifture, and confumes dung quickly. Under fome of 
the thinner foils, there lies, about 6 inches from the fur- 

face, 



196 



Statiflical Account 



face, a tawny or brownifh coloured fand, which adheres in 
large maffes. It muft be carefully avoided by the plough, 
as deftruttive of vegetation A judicious ufe of lime, 
which could be had from Sunderland at 4 d. per meal firlor, 
would, by attracting the dews, bring a more copious fupply 
of nightly moifture ; and a plentiful ufe of the lighter clays, 
even in comport; dunghills, would give a firmer texture to 
the foil, to retain the moifture which it receives, and would 
enrich the ground that has been injudicioufly empoveriftied, 
by intermixing the barren furface of turfed moors, and by 
heaping on fand where there is already more than enough. 

Nature and Extent of the Sea Coajl. — The coaft, though 
it be every where flat, (hallow, and fandy, is feldom preju- 
dicial to ftiips, which, in palling up and down, can keep the 
deep water, under cover of the bold coaft and mountains of 
Rofs ; and Cromarty Bay is a harbour of fafety, which is 
never inacceffible. Here are no kelp rocks, nor is fea-weed 
caft out in any quantity for manure. The coaft, of about 
6 miles extent in this parilh, prefents no fituation for an har- 
bour ; nor does it afford productions of fponges, corals, or 
weeds, worth notice. 

At the back ftiore, behind Cullen, there are beds of 
cockles of the beft quality. They are the perquifite of the 
poor, who - rake them out of the fand at ebb of tide, both for 
tfuftenance and fale. The mufcles on this fide are confidered 
as property, and carefully looked after, being in requeft as 
bait for white-fifti. There was formerly a boat and crew 
for white-fifhiug at Hill of Findern, in this parifti, which 
was a great convenience, and often furniftied hands for the 
riavy. It was fupprefled by a former proprietor, and the 
filhers fet adrift, becaufe the coft of upholding the boat 
jfeemed to exceed the rent. But, at the increafed prices of 



of Dyke and Moy.

\ fifh fince that time, it might yet be an object for the new 
i proprietor, to fet the white-fifh bufinefs afloat again. 

It would alfo be a great convenience, if a quay were to 
] be erected on the weft fide of the river mouth, below Btnf- 
I nefs, where mips from Findern harbour might come over 
and lie to, for unlading lime and coals for the ufe of this pa- 
rifh, and for receiving the grain and wood wherewith it a- 
bounds. This would fave a long carriage round the Bay, 
and prevent the detention of corn mips by the fwells of the 
river, which wind raifes as well as rain, to be frequently im- 
pafTable. This might be done ; without any prejudice to the 
dues of Findern harbour. 

Lakes. — There are no lakes of any confide rable magni- 
tude. We have feveral fprings impregnated with iron ; but 
none of any remarkable ftrength or efficacy. 

Rivers and Streams. — Our only river is the Ern or Find- 
ern, not navigable, but of confiderable value for its fal- 
mon fifhings ; and there are four fmall dreams befides, that 
water the parifh, containing nothing but trout. 

IJlands, Rocks, and Caves. — There are no iuands, rocks, 
or caves ; but there are remarkable hills of fand, for which, 
and for the old bar, fee the Appendix. 

v Woods. — Few coaft parifhes are fo well provided With va- 
riety of natural and planted trees. The larger allars are in 
requeft for building boats and fmall floops. Birch finds a 
ready fale for peat-carts, and other implements of hufbandry 
of the cheaper kinds, to fupply the neighbouring markets. 
Am, elm, beech, plain-tree, and 4uch oaks as can be had, 
are taken off by water-carriage ; and firs, for roofing, fark- 
ing, and flooring of houfes, are fawn out here, and carried 

off

off by the like conveyance. Ships, with coals and lime from 
Newcaftle and Sunderland, may fliortly carry back cargoeg 
of fir-deal and flabs, for boxing the {hafts of mines. It has 
probably encouraged the plantation of wood in this parifb, 
that the Earl of Moray has a thriving beech at Earlfmil], 
that meafures 14 feet 7 inches; and an afli meafuring 14 
feet 10 inches in the girth. Experiments were made be- 
fore the middle of the laft century, of planting a few allies 
in the vicinity of great houfes ; but for the firft judicious , 
and fpirited exertion on a larger fcale, in planting and im- 
proving an eltate, this parifti and county has been much in- • 
debted to the example oi a Lady, of moft refpedlable me- 
mory, Mary Sleigh *, the wife of Alexander Brodie of that 
Ilk, Lord Lyon. 

Orchards, 

* This excellent Lady, who had full liberty to manage matters at home, 
while her hufband attended his duty in feveral different Parliaments, had ac- ; 
quired liberal and comprehenfive views of the benefit and mutual relations of 
agriculture, manufactures, and commerce. She had feen much of the world 
before fhe came here. When (he faw the fituation of the country, fhe pi- 
tied it; fhe knew the value of people on an eftate, and ftudied to make 
them induftrious, by contriving work, and giving them wages and bread 
for their fervices. The men fhe employed in levelling, trenching, draining, 
and raifing fences ; and trained the women to induftry, by eftablifhing a 
fchool for fpinning, and for difpenfing premiums. She raifed quantities of 
flax, encouraged her tenants to cultivate it, and built them a mill, for brui- 
fing and fcutching it. She enclofed and fubdivided an extenGve mains fub- 
ftai:tially ; trained up the hedges with uncommon care, and, further, (bet- 
tered the enclofures, with belts planted with great variety of trees. Her 1 
gardens, orchards, and nurferies, furpaffed every thing, but Dunkeld and 
Blair, benorth Tay. From thefe, fhe was fond of providing her neighbours 
gratis, who had a mind to make experiments in planting. She made new 
roads ; ftraightened old ones, planting them on both fides ; put trees in the 
gardens of every farm-ftead, and raifed fylvan fcenes all around her. The 
profit of this has been already realized, and will endure for many years to 
come. Planting has now become a favourite object. The Earl of Moray 
is doing great things, and has improved, upon her method. He intermixes 
all kinds of trees, with pines for fhelter. His plantations about Darnaway 
are uncommonly thriving. He cuts out the firs whenever they can be

Orchards. — There are 4 orchards in the parilh. The 
early blow is often blafted by eafterly winds *. The later 
kinds thrive belt. The crop of apples and pears are feldom 
plentiful. 

Air. — The air, which is dry and healthy, is not produc- 
tive of local diftempers. There are a number of old peo- 
ple, but no inftances of remarkable longevity. 

Difeafes. — The mod frequent diforders are vernal and 
autumnal fevers, which, here, as well as elfewhere, have 
Changed their nature, and become nervous and lingering. 
Though they be vifibly infectious, an ill-judged fympathy 
brings many young people into danger, who, while they 
cannot profit the fick by their perfonal attendance, do a pre- 
judice to themfelve3 and others, by carrying home the in- 
fection. The natural fmall-pox are lefs fatal, fince they 
have been lefs an object of folicitous care. Frefh air and 
cool regimen have faved the lives of many. Inoculation is 
not yet general, nor is it much relilhed, among the lower 
ranks. 

Climate. — The climate is not inferior to that of Lothian. 
By the fhelter of a wall it ripens apricots and peaches in 
the open air. Stone-fruit of every kind thrives better than 
in richer foils ; apples and pears not fo well. 

State 

rfifpenfed with. The weedings are a good fuccedaneum for peat-mofs, 
which is fcarce, by affording a comfortable firing, from 4 d. to 6 d. per 
load ; and trees will in time generate both foil and mofs where there was 
none, and make way for the plough at length, in places where it might 
have long laboured in vain. 

•* They fhould follow the plan here, adopted in Denmark, of covering 
the trees, in the fpring, during the day, and uncovering them at nighty 
•which keeps the bloflbm back, till the feafon becomes genial.

State of Property. — Having yet no falt-pans, lime-works, 
nor mines of coal or metals, the property confifis of lands 
woods, and falmon fifhings. There are ftell fifhings on the 
fea, and cobble fifhings on the frefli- water of Findern. Some 
of the frefli water fiilrings belong to the parilh of Forres. 
Such fifiiings as have been repeatedly aflefled with ftipends, 
I prefume, may belong to this parilh, and thefe are, the two 
halves of the Long-pool fifhings, one belonging to the Dal- 
vey eftate, in this parilh, and the other to a landholder of 
Forres parilh, who has no property but fifhings here. Two- 
eight parts of the Nether Water, i. e. two-eighths belonging 
to Dalvey, and two-eighths of the fame belonging to Birdf- 
yards, who has no lands in this parifh ; (the remaining four- 
eighths of the Nether Water belonging, as I prefume, to 
the parifh of Forres. All the frefli-water fifhings, as deri- 
ved, at fome period, from the Abbots of Kinlofs, and inde- 
pendent of the adjacent lands, have right to draw nets indif- 
ferently on either fide. The ftell fifhings fpecially men- 
tioned in the decreets of the minifters of Dyke, are, Eth 
, ftell, Elven ftell, the Sheriffs ftell, and the Eafter and We- 

fter ftells of Culbin. 
u 

Number of Proprietors, Rejtdent and Non-refident. — The 
number of proprietors, in the laft century, were at leaft 12 
or upwards. For jo years back, the greater part of the pro- 
perties have been rather fluctuating. The proprietors, ia 
1793, are but five ; four landholders, whereof two have fifh- 
ings in the parilh, two have no fifhings in it, and one has 
fifhings without lands. 

The refident proprietors are, James Brodie, Efq; of Bro- 
die, and Hugh Grant, Efq; of Moy. The Earl of Moray 
retains a family of fervants at Darnaway, where he occupies 
the Mains, and keeps his caftle in repair, for the fake of a 
ftiort refidence when his occafions call him to the north.

He keeps a fa&amp;or here for his riorthern properties, who re-

Mode of Cultivation. — The mode of cultivation is not yet, 
in the general practice, reduced to eftablifhed rules, or a re- 
gular fucceflion of crops ; and all attempts of binding down 
the mode of procedure upon tenants, by articles, are either 
fpurned at, or prove abortive. The general prepoffefiion is in 
favour of whatever mode of cultivation gives the quickeft re- 
turns, with leaft expence and trouble. Their practice (as it 
ought to be) is more the refult of obfervation and experience, 
than of theory * and fyftem ; yet it is gradually, though (low- 
ly, changing for the better. Nobody doubts any longer of 
the profit of fown graffes, with, or even without, enclofing. 
Small patches of grafs are fown, and enclofed with flakes or 
paling by the poorer fort ; and clover and rye-grafs, to great-

* Such proprietors as are bent on agricultural improvement, aie too apt to 
eomplain of the flow progress of new methods among their farmers, which 
they erroneoufly impute to Stupidity or obftinacy ; but, considering how ma- 
ny richer people have fuflfered deeply, by new experiments and Speculations 
in huibandry, it is a lucky circumftance for landlords that tenants are not Jo 
venterous as proprietors in thefe particulars. With a heavy rent hanging 
over them, and their living and credit at flake, it behoves them not only to 
fee before they believe, but to be fomewhat eafy before they hazard upon 
fchemes of enclofing, fallowing, and liming; and it is not to be expected, 
that they fliould haftily lofe fight of thofe cautious habits, which have ena- 
bled them to keep credit from the beginning. Perhaps the fpeedieft and 
moft effectual way, of introducing ufeful alterations in their method and ma- 
nagement, would be, for proprietors to make farmers of the moft judicious 
and thorough bred of their farm-fervants. When thefc could be obferved to 
profit by the new methods they had been bred and accuftomed to, hundreds 
would copy from a thriving farmer, who has no refources but his plough and 
. better management, for one that will venture to imitate a monied landlord ; 
whofe crops his tenants may admire, while they remain doubtful and fufpi- 
cious how far the profit will repay the expence.

cr extent, are fown in the open fields, which is bringing win- 
ter herding more into ufe ; and the quantity of ley -grafs is 
much increafed. 

After 3 years reft, they have 2 good crops of oats before 
barley, with the benefit of better fummer feeding for their 
cattle, an increafe of milk, and enlargement of the breed, in 
confequence of refting the ground. Potatoes were little 
known before the year 1745, and, when tried, yielded no 
crops but in lazy beds, or new ground that fent up no 
weeds. It was long before they learned to keep them pro- 
perly clean. Now, nobody miiles plentiful crops ; and they 
are the beft improvement in the cultivation of our corn 
fields, where, by fome, they are trenched down, with dung, 
by the fpade, but many have difcovered, at length, that, 
with clean keeping, the beft crops are after the plough. 
The farmers give ground to every cottager for his dung and 
culture, which has greatly leffened the confumption of grain, 
and is the chief fubfiftence of the labouring poor. The po- 
tatoe crop is fucceeded by wheat or barley, with fown grafe-, 
and where grafs is not fown in potatoe-ground, they have 3 
crops of oats after jhe wheat or barley; then they taki 
barley, peafe, and 2 crops of oats again. Flax is commonlyfl 
fown after barley ; and wheat fometimes after fown grafs, 1 
when broke up. 

The tillage is much better fince the introduction and ge- 
neral ufe of Englifti ploughs. There is one indifputable faft, 
which I can only afcribe to the potatoe culture, and increafe 
of grafs and refting, that the barley crops are not nearly fo 
much choked as formerly by the gool or yellow gowan, 
which is almoft banilhed here, in comparifon of former times.- 
But, with our fown graffes, we have got a plentiful importa-ij 
tion of ragweed.

Implements of Hufbandry. — All the implements of or- 
dinary hufbandry, are now made more fubftantial and com- 
modious than formerly. Box-carts are coming in ufe for 
kellochs, and Angle draughts are preferred to double, which 
ill fuit the ftrength of our fmall horfes. 

Manures. — There are no manures in common ufe but 
comport dunghills, in which they intermix earth, clay, or 
water- fond from the burns, with ftable-dung and allies : 

They now make, very little ufe of moorifli earth.

Seedtime. — Wheat and rye would moot before winter, if 
town as early in warm as in cold or fliff foils, and would not 
be eafily kept from cattle if they were not fown late ; they are 
laid down from Martinmas to the end of December. Oats 
and peafe from 12th March to 12th April. Oats are fhort, 
and peafe a poor cover, when early fown here, being too for- 
ward to have the full benefit of the July rains. Barley is 
fo wn from 10th May to 10th June. Of late, it has been 
fown in February and March, in dry feafons, and grounds 
in high order, which gives the weightier! grain ; but, in 
other cafes, the lateit is the thicker! and moll plentiful crop. 
Flax is fown in April, — and pulled ; and potatoes are moftly 
planted in that month.

and ftock on hand, and becaufe barley had been riling for feveral years.

* It is but a fmall proportion of the prefent rents that are paid in victual. 
The bolls have been moftly converted into money-rents, and thefe money- 
rents, at different times, augmented. But I have feen a computation of the 
land-rents and fiihings, made by the laft minifter, about 40 years ago, where 
the victual- rents are valued at L. 5 Scots, equal 8 s. 4 d. ; and the falted 
falmon at L. 33 Scots, equal £.2:13:4 Sterling per barrel, of 4 cwt. By 
this calculation, including but very little money-rent, the amount of the 
rents of the parifh are computed at L. 14,866 : 13 : 4 Scots money, or 
L. 1238 : 17 : 0-^5- Sterling. Since that time, till now, the rents, computed 
on a money fcale, appear to be more than doubled. But, computed on the 
fcale of produce, their increafe appears far lefs confiderable, in regard the 
number of bolls and fifhes then paid, would, according to their prefent va- 
lue, fetch the double of what they were then worth. And, in general, it is 
evident, that in corn pariflies along the coafts, where every foil fit for corn 
was brought under culture many centuries ago, the rents paid in kind, whe- 
ther of corn or fifli, being a proportion of the produce, muft have nearly 
reached their ultimatum at a very early period, fo as to admit of little rife, 
except it were on the money fcale. In fuch maritime parifhes whofe pay- 
»ents were made in produce, the rents would feem to have been heavier 
about 1633, than at any period fince that time. When the valuation of 
tithes was then introduced, the fubftitution of one-fifth of the rent, as an 
equivalent for one-tenth of the produce, feems to warrant a fuppofition or 
inference, that the proprietors (whom the Legiflature wifhed rather to eafe 
than to injure) had, in thofe days, to th.e amount of value of half the pro. 
dnce on account of rents.

ManufaBures.— Of manufactures there is nothing to fay, 
fut that the harn, tweeling, coarfe linen, and plaiden, made 
ijy individuals, are readily bought up at fairs by dealers, 
fior high prices, and carried away. The quantities of each 
■kind not known. 

I Articles of Commerce. — The chief articles of commerce 
Bare, grain, black-cattle, iced and barrelled falmon, linen- 
Byarn of the coarfer kinds, and wood. 

Grain.— The furplus of grain for export is very confider- 
able ; of wheat fometimes, of oats and barley always. Oats 
are fold at 5 firlots per boll, wanting only (according to 
Bald's Tables) 1 lippy and .5206 of an Englifh quarter. 
Bailey or farm bear, at 4 firlots, weighs from 17 to 19 ftoiit: 
Dutch, wanting 1 firlot 1 lippy and .579 of a lippy, of an 
Englifh quarter. A regulation for felling all grain by 
weight would do juftice to good farmers, make bad farmers 
better, and render purchafers by commiffion more fecure. 
It would be convenient, at the fame time, to regulate the 
weight of hay, wool, butter, and cheefe, and bring the diffe- 
rent counties to one ftandard, that buyers and fellers might 
have nothing to differ about, or fettle, but the price. 

Cattle. 



2o8 



Statijlical Account 



Cattle. — Runts, and yell 01' dry cows, are the chief articles 
in the cattle trade : we fpare fome of every kind, and ftots 
fell deareft ; yet they ought rather to be wrought out. It 
would be more profitable to carry on the farm-work alto- 
gether with oxen, which are fit for every work except ri- 
ding, are much more eafily maintained, are far lefs liable 
to fudden difeafes, and, in the end, fetch a good price for 
beef: when old, horfes muft be given to the dogs. Some 
have eftimated the difference of working a farm with hor- 
fes, and with oxen, to amount, all things confidered, to the 
value of the rent : the faving upon oats is great. 

Fijhings of Salmon. — Frefh falmon are fometimes fent to . 
London in ice ; but are moftly kitted at Findern. The 
trade has been much monopolized by an Aberdeen compa- 
ny, who took leafes of all the fifhings they could get I 
throughout the north, and bought up the fifli caught *by 
other leflees. The boil-houfe prices, allowed by that com- 
pany, were, in the firft of the feafon to the ift of May, 4 d. 
per lb. grofs weight ; from ift May to end of May, 3 d.; 
thence to the end of June 2i d. and while they continue to 
kit. Three fifties of 10 lib. fuffice for one kit; this, at the 
early price, comes to 10 s. The kit, boiling, and curing, 
with freight, and other cofts, bring up the charges to 13 s. 
per kit; which fetches, at London, from 18 s. to 31 s. 6d. 
The profit, therefore, on kitting fifti, bought at the above 
prices, runs from 94 to 135 per cent, nearly. 

In times of fcarcity, they kit as long as it is allowable to 
fifti. But, generally, after the ift of June, the raw Mi 
are cured in barrels, with one-half boll of foreign fait to 
each barrel. From 30 to 40 well fized fifli make a barrel,^ 
of 4 cwt. The fait and barrel coft from 12 s. to 13 s. The 
freight is 3 s. to London, and 4 s. 6 d. to Holland. The bar- 
rel,

rel, of 4 cwt. formerly fold for L. 4, and fometimes for L. 5, 
now it fetches only 50 s. 

Cod. — Cod are fometimes caught in great abundance, by 
Nairn and Findern boats, in the beginning of winter, when 
the weather cannot ferve for drying them. An adventurer, 
from this parifli, cured a quantity in barrels, like falted fal- 
mon, carried them to London, and made no lofs by the ad- 
venture, though they fold heavily, and muft have been but 
■unpleafant food. But had thefe cod been parboiled, and cu- 
red with vinegar at the boil-houfe, like ketled falmon, it is 
believed, fuch foufed filh would have excelled the falted, as 
much as the kitted falmon exceeds the falted, in quality and 
price. 

Seals. — There are alfo fea-calves or feals on the coaft of 
this parifli, whereof one man has killed 130 in a year, 
worth 4 s. apiece, for their oir and fldn. The matter of 
feal-fiftiing is the more deferving of attention, becaufe, be- 
fide the intrinfic value of feals, they lie in wait for falmon, 
and frighten them away from a (hallow coaft. 

Tarn. — The yarn-trade has fallen off greatly fince the 
ufe of cottons hath become almoft universal. There are yet 
3 yarn factors in the parifli, who buy up yarn fpun from 
home flax, and give out foreign flax to be fpun, from 2i d. 
to 3^-d. per hank. They were in ufe to expend about 
L. 500 a-year for the fpinning and purchafe of yarn; now 
they do not exceed L. 300 in whole. From the number of 
weavers in the parifli, I fuppofe the high prices for coarfe 
cloth makes the fpinners manufacture their own lint for the 
fairs. From 20 cuts to 2\ hanks is the common grift of 
^pinning here.

IV ood. — The wood market has already begun briflcly, 
and will fhortly be great. One heritor draws a hundred a» 
year, for 7 years, for the cutting of one fir park, which will 
be planted again when it is cleared. He has another ready 
for felling down, and feverals rifing in fucceflion. So that 
moderation in cutting, and diligence in planting again what 
is cleared, will bring the bufinefs to a very confiderable 
ftanding rent. 

Villages, Inns, and Still. — There are villages at Broom of 
Moy, Kintefak, and Dyke •, at which lafl there is an inn, 
near the poll road, and another inn at the Ferry Boat, on 
the eaft fide of the river •, and no other inns or alehoufes. 
One licenfed ftill, of 38 gallons, has fupplied this parifti ; I 
believe one of 30 might fuffice. 

Roads, and Statute Labour. — The roads being naturally 
good, there are no turnpikes, nor any need or wifli for them. 
The ftatute labour is exacted, which keeps the roads in to- 
lerable repair. Commutation was attempted, but it raifed 
difcontent, and was dropped. 

Bridges. — Three flout wooden bridges, floored acrofes, 
railed, and painted, have been built, at Moy, Dalvey, and 
Barley-mill, near the fords of the Beg-Bourne, at the coit of 
L. 114, 7 s. Sterling, out of 5^ years of the ftipends accruing 
at the laft vacancy. 

They admit no carriages, nor even the poft-cart •, but the 
liorfe and mail can pafs. Three fmall ftone bridges- were 
aifo built on the public road, out of the fame fund, for L.30, 

State of the Church. — A new and commodious church, of 
06 by 33 feet, infide, was built in 1781, at the expence of 
{he heritors, for the fum of L. 525, befide the carriages per-

formed by the parifli. It is neatly plaftered and ceiled, 
well lighted, paved in the areas, and regularly feated. It 
has a geometrical ftair in each end, with galleries quite 
round ; and none are allowed to bury in it. The plan has 
been adopted by other parilhes. 

Manfe. — The manfe and offices were completely rebuilt 
and flated in 1790, and garden- walls built, of (tone and 
lime, for L. 321 : 18 : 3, out of the above mentioned vacant 
ftipends. L. 101 : 8 : 7 of thefe ftipends went to the pay- 
ment of interim afiiftants, during the vacancy •, and the rem- 
nant, to other neceffary purpoCes within the parifh. — Oa 
the 19th January 1795, a (till fire broke out, near mid-day, 
with inextinguifhable vehemence, in a room that had been, 
deafened with ftraw and {havings of wood, inftead of clay, 
whereby the manfe, but not the offices, was rapidly confu- 
med. The walls remained entire, and the heritors com- 
pletely repaired the dwelling- houfe, for L. 170 . 18 : 3, i» 
1795-6. 

Stipend, Glebes, and Patronage. — The living, which had 
I fiot been augmented fince 1650, was made better in June 
\ 1795, by an addition of 16 bolls more barley, and about- 
\ L. 15 more money. It ftands now at 106 bolls 1 firlot bar- 
I ley, 7 bolls 2 firlots oat-meal, at 9 ftones, with L. 40: 15 : a 
M Sterling of money-ftipend, and L. 5 more for communion- 
9 elements. There is a glebe of 6 acres at Dyke, and a fmall 
1 one in the other parifh, for which the proprietor of Moy 
gj pays a rent of 6 bolls of barley. The mini Iter has L. t , 
i 13 s. 4 d. for grafs-money. The living, with its aceommo- 
tl dations, according to prefent prices, may be reckoned at 
L. 150.

Poor. — Affeffments for the maintenance of the poor have- 
never been attempted here. They are believed, and not 
without reafon, to encourage idlenefs and inconfiderate ex ; 
pences. The charity of the pariftioners would afford fuffi. 
cient aid to the parim poor, if it were not fo much fore- 
flailed by vagrant and ftrolling beggars, recommended, out 
of their own parities, to the public at large, by canting cer- 
tificates, deferving of no regard. 

The average number of enrolled poor, for the 7 years from 
1789 to 1795, inclufive of both years, is 61. Among thefe, 
the church-feffion difpenfes all the cam in hand by half- 
yearly diftributions ; the one in February; the other in

have a laudable fympathy for the poor, and give fupply

The collections, which are far from liberal, are but a 
fmall proportion of the charity given by houfe-holders. But, 
every one has a right to difpenfe his own charity to his own 
mind. 

The feffion has a right of recommending patients from 
this parilh, to be received gratis in the Infirmaries of Edin- 
burgh and Aberdeen, in confequence of a bequeft, by the 
above mentioned Henry Vafs, made upon that condition, 
to each of thefc charitable inftitutions . Every heritor has 
a right to a vote in the management of the poor's funds ; 
and the books are open at all times for infpe&amp;ion of all 
concerned. The accounts of receipts and expenditures, kept 
by the clerk and treafurer, are every year revifed and 
compared, and being found to agree, the treafurer is formal- 
ly acquitted of his intromiffions, by a minute entered into

Schools and Scholars. — There is another parochial fund, 
deltined for two fchools in the village of Dyke ; the one for 
boys; the other for girls. It confifts of the intereft of 
3500 merks, = L. 194 : 8 : io/ T 20 = L.9 : 14 : 5A- 
Sterling ; the intereft of 1000 merks, payable to the paro- 
chial or grammar fchoolmafter, =L. 2 : 15 : 6 T 8 T ; and the 
intereft of 2500 merks to the miftrefs of the woman-fchool t 
= L.6 : 18 : 10 A . 

The grammar fchoolmafter has alfo L. z out of the 
collections, and 16 bolls bear, one-half paid by the heri- 
tors, 



of Dyke and Moy. 



I tors, and the other half by the parilhoners. He teaches 
J Englifti and writing for is. 6 d. per quarter ; arithmetic 
| for i s. 8 d. per ditto ; Iiatin for a s. 6 d. per ditto ; menfu- 
i ration and land-furveying for 4 s. 6 A. per ditto ; geometry for 
j 7 s. 6 d. per ditto ; and book-keeping for 10 s. 6 d. and 15 s, 
j He receives 1 s. 6 d. for proclamation of bans; 6 d. for re- 
i cording baptifms; and 4 d. for extending certificates :^and 
j has 40 fcholars at an average. The falary and emoluments 
I amount to L. 33, befides, his lodging, in the fchool-houfe, 
I which was rebuilt and flared in 1785, with a floored fchool- 
I room, and % fmall chambers, for the mailer's accommoda- 
I tion. 1 

The woman's fchool is a joint foundation, in the year 
J1702, refting on a bequeft from John Anderfon, writer in 
lEdinburgh ; and a further deftination by James Brodie of 
I that Ilk, the truftee, who added 500 merks to Anderfon's 
I donation of 2000 merks, gave off ground, and built thereon 
a flated houfe of 2 floors, with garrets, for the accommoda- 
tion of the miftrefs and fcholars ; and gave alfo a garden at 
his own expence. His heirs, though conjoined with the he- 
ritors and feflSon, are managers Jine quibus non. The falary, 
at the beginning, in 1702, was 21 bolls bear, mortgaged for 
a capital of L. 138 : 17 : 9^ Sterling, or L. 2500 merks, 
belonging to this fchool. At the redemption of the mort- 
gage or wadfet, the falary was reduced to L. 6 : 18 : 10^- 
Sterling, the legal intereft of the capital. The fchool-houfe, 
though ftill in ufe, is ruinous, and in urgent need of imme- 
diate repair *. 

Averages 

* There was once a great refort from Caithnefs, Sutherland, Rofs, &amp;c. 
to this boarding-fchool, where young gentlewomen were taught reading, 
knitting ftockings, marking, plain and coloured feara, and mufic, by the mi- 
ftrefs ; and writing and arithmetic by the parochial fchoolmafter. Many 
daughters of men of property were educated here, without reforting for ac 
-cpmplifliments any where elfe.

Caufes of the Decline of Population. — The population of! 
this parifh, as far as can be guefled by multiplying the ave- 
rage of births by 314-, would feem, from the above Tables, 
to have been, in 1677, as high as 2200. From that period 
there are three vifible caufes of its fubfequent decline. 

I. One unavoidable caufe, was the overwhelming of the 
populous barony of Cnlbin *, by a violent drifting of fand 
from the Mavifton hills ; and, excepting a fmall remnant 

fartheft 

* The fand had been making great encroachments before it overwhelm- 
ed the mains and garden of Culbin. But that event, which completed the 
bufinefs, muft have happened confiderably earlier than the date afligncd in 
Shaw's Hiltory of the Province ; becaufe it is fpecially mentioned in the 
Act of Parliament, againft pulling of bent, pafied in 1695, intitled, for 
Preservation of Lands adjacent to Sand-hills, and is mentioned as one of tbc 
jeafons for palling that act, K. Wil. III. 1 Par. 5 Sef. Act xxx.

fartheft from the coaft, the depopulation of that barony 
was completed before the clofe of the laft century. 

2. Another caufe, affecling all the other eftates in the pa- 
rifh, is the change that has taken place fince the rebellion, 
1745, in the fize and number of farms. Formerly they 
were very fmall and numerous, running from 4 to 16 bolls 
of rent ; now they are larger, and not half fo numerous as 
they were. A multitude of fmall farms is very favourable 
to population; yet the enlargement of farms, to a certain 
degree, was needful in this parifti, where the grounds fo 
much needed reft, and where milk, butter, and butcher- 
meat were fo fcarce ; and, had there been manufactures 
fufficient to employ the hands fuperfeded from tillage, the 
enlargement of farms might have been favourable to agri- 
culture, without diminifhing the population. But this not 
being the cafe, 

3. The neglect of manufactures may be ftated as a third 
caufe, and the greateft of any, affecting the population of this 
pariih. The prefent pofleffors, finding that there are not 
fo many rooms as formerly for farmers, breed their chil- 
dren to handicrafts ; and thefe, not finding employment at 
home, pufh their way to Edinburgh, Glafgow, Paifley, or 
London, from whence they leldom find their way back to 
fettle here. This caufe affects moft of the northern diftricts, 
where manufactures do not meet with the attention and en- 
couragement that they deferve. This is what occalious 
yearly emigrations, during the feafons of fummer and har- 
veft work, to places where there is more employment and 
higher wages ; and thefe fhort excurfions frequently end in 
a removal to manufacturing towns at the laft. 

Remedies. — The remedies are pointed out by the caufes 
of emigration, or decreafc of people. 

1. To 



£22 



StatiJlicaJ Account 



1. To divide the larger farms when the leafes have run. 
and bring them into proper compafs. Evils are generally 
■corrected by their effects ; and wile proprietors begin to dif. 
cover, that fmall farmers make better payments than the 
great, efpecially when they pay in produce. It is beyond 
doubt, that a ore corn was raifed when farms were fmailer 
than at the prefem time. 

2. The introduction and patronage of manufactures 
■would not only prevent further depopulation, but would 
give new life and fpirit to agriculture, bring an increafe of 
people, by promoting and providing for marriage, and form 
a folid and fatibfadlory balis for iticreafing rents. If manu- 
factures were firft eftablifhed, rents would quickly rife of 
courfe, and the enlargement of farms would occalion no di- 
ftrefs. But it is a fhort fighred policy, that aims at an in-': 
•creafe of rent, by a decreafe of people, whofe labours can at 
once be made profitable to landlords, and comfortable to, | 
themfelves. A more timely attention to fifheries and ma- 
2iufactures, and particularly to the manufacturing of wool, 
in the Highlands of Scotland, might have prevented the 
emigrations to America, and even increafed the fources of 
public pi ofperity and national defence. It is a {peculation • 
equally mean and hazardous, to difpoffefs brave and attach- 
ed Highlanders, to make way for a population of fheep. 
The maxim, that it is lawful for a man to do what he will 
with his own, has already mifled too many ; it is fo far 
from being univerfally true, that it has its limitations in 
every kind of property. §uia interejl reipubliccs ne quis re 
fua male utatur : He who ufes his own to the detriment of 
the public, incurs juft blame and obnoxioufnefs. One's 
right to difpofe of his own money, does not extend to a 
right of melting down the current coin ; and more efpecial- 
ly, in all feudal tenures, there are refei ved rights of the 
Sovereign, as head of the community, whereby proprietors 

ftand

Hand amenable for fuch abufe of property as is prejudicial 
to the common- weal. For though ftatute law never has* 
and probably never will, intermeddle with a mbjecl fo deli- 
cate, complicated, and difficult, as fixing limitations on the 
ufe of property, it ought to be more generally underftood 
than it would feem to be, that malversations and abufes of 
power, in the ufe of property, iffuing in public detriment 
and alarming depopulation, have already been brought un- 
der the laih of the common law, at the inftance of the 
Crown, even in South Britain. A lawyer of the lail cen- 
tury, Mr Robert Powel, of Wells, publilhed a treatife, in 
1636, intitled, Depopulation Arraigned, where, at page 
84, he narrates a trial and fentence, at Michaelmas term, 
decimo Caroli, anno 1635. The judgment againft this de- 
populator, for converting fo much arable into pafiure, was 
accompanied with heavy penalties, and with circumftances 
of humiliating difgrace. Such as wifli to be more fully in- 
formed, may have recourfe to the records of the times, not 
omitting thofe of the Privy Council of England. 

Quarries. — There are 2 free ftone quarries in this parilh, 
both of the harder kind. And there is a limeftone rock on 
the weft fide of the river, at the Boat-pool, but, for want of 
fuel, it is more eligible to purchafe lime, than to burn it 
here. 

Fuel and Coals. — Peats are very fcarce, dear, and of 
little ftrength. The parilh would have been in uncommon 
diftrefs for want of fuel, long fince, had it not obtained a 
ieafonable fupply from the weedings of fir plantations, and 
an eafement of the duty upon coals, which begin to be ufed 
by the lower ranks, becaufe they afford light to fpin, 
Newcaftle coal are bought from 1 s. to d. to 2 s. per barrel; 

Antiquities*

Statiftical Account 



Antiquities* — At Darnaway, the feat of the Earls of Mo. 
ray, of the Randolph, Dunbar, Douglas, and Stewart race, 
flands an old caftle, nobly elevated, with great range and 
variety of profpecl, which has been built at different pe- 
riods, adjoining to a princely hall, that had been erefted by 
Thomas Randolph, Regent of Scotland, during the mino- 
rity of King David Bruce, for the reception of his nume- 
rous vaiTais. This hall is by much the oldeft and moft re. 
m;:rkable part of buildings, which are now altogether a 
venerable pile. After all the changes it has undergone, it 
is ftill a pleating monument of ancient hofpitality and mag- 
nificence. The length is 89 feet, and breadth 35. It has 
yet from 18 to 20 feet of fide wall, though it wants about 
12 of its original height, by reafon of a range of vaults con- 
ftrufted on its ground floor, for cellars, with a flone pave- 
ment above them. It has a battery in the outer end, and 
above that a mufic gallery, from fide to fide. There was a 
large chimney in the oppofite end, and another fpacious 
fire-place in one of its fides. 

The roof is fupported by diagonal couples and rafters of 
mafly oak, more fuperb than any modern ceiling, and re- 
fembles that of the Parliament Houfe of Edinburgh, and 
Guildhall of London. Earl Randolph's hofpitable board, of 
thick oaken plank, curioufly bordered and indented, ftand- 
ing on 6 pillars, draws out at one end to double length. 
His oaken chair, on which are coarfely carved the bearings 
of his office and arms, weighs about 60 libs, avoirdupois, 
and differs little from the coronation chair in Weftminfter 
Abbey. 

Coins. — In digging the foundation of the new church, be- 
hind the old one, a day-labourer found a depofit, as he was 
working alone, before the arrival of his companions, and, co- 
vering it up, contrived to employ himfeif and the others, 

till

till night, in digging the foundations in a different quarter. 
Before morning, he had fecured the contents of an earthen 
pot, of old coins, which, at convenience, were fold as bul- 
lion, for about L. 46. They were all of one fize, broader than 
a lixpence, and very thin but the filver was fine and unful- 
lied. Such as had been unavoidably fcattered, were found, 
by the teft of Auderfon's Numefmata, to be groat pieces ; 
with a rude impreffion of a head, hand, and fceptre, upon 
each. They had been ftruck, at many different places, both 
in Scotland and England, as appeared by the one fide ; on 
the other fide, they bore the impreffion and name of one or 
other of thefe contemporary princes, Henry II. of England, 
or King William of Scotland. Some, that had been ftruck 
at Striveling, had the words re villam •, Re being the Gae- 
lic word for King. I faw fome of both kinds. 

Records.— -The oldeft parifh record now extant, goes back 
as far as 16 10. It is very ill to read. In fome periods, the 
records feem very exactly kept ; in others, they are very 
much deranged and confufed. No record of burials has ever 
been regularly kept ; as there are two burial grounds, and 
two grave-diggers, it is the more difficult to be exact. At 
prefent, there are three records carried on at once. A re- 
gifter of baptifms and marriages ; a cafh-book ; and a book 
of difcipline, for recording the proceedings of the church fef- 
fion. This has frequent references to the cadi-book, and 
the caQi-book to it. All of thefe new records commenced 
in 1788. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — In the laft century, James 
Brodie of that Ilk, and his brother-in-law, Sir Robert Dun- 
bar of Grangehill, had each of them 9 marriageable daugh- 
ters, who were coufin-germans ; and 8 out of each family were 
married. — A rape, committed by a foldier, about 50 years

ago, was punilhed by his public execution. — A murder was 
committed, in 1780, on a ftrolling packman ; the perpetra- 
tor never was difcovered. 

Charatler of the People. — The people are, very generally, 
decent, quiet, and well affected to the religion and government 
under which they live. They are neither addicted to a fea. 
faring or military life; yet the frequency of recruiting par. 
ties reconciles them, when that bufinefs is accompanied with 
mufic, mirth, and drink. They can live poorly, to drefs 
neatly ; but few think of laying any thing up. On public 
occafions, there are not a few who will fpend, what they 
can ill afford, in v^ing to be neighbour-like, with others 
xvho are either more rich, or more inconfiderate than them- 
felves. In general, they are better fed and clothed, and 
have greater variety of convenient furniture, than they had 
40 years ago. But the ufe of tea makes rather an alarming 
progrefs among many, who need a better nourifliment, at 
lefs expence. 

Means of bettering their Condition. — The belt means to 
meliorate their fituation, would be manufactures, for which 
this paiifh, with fuch a foil and climate, and fo near the 
port of Findhorn, is no unpromifing fituation. Having plen- 
ty of flat grounds, well watered, and being very fit for the 
cultivation of flax, it feems by nature belt adapted for the 
linen manufacture, in all its branches, of flax-dreffing, fpia- 
ning, weaving, bleaching, and thread-making. 

Cotton manufacture is now going forward at Skibo and 
Spinningdale, where L. 4000 a-year is now circulated, in 
Sutherland, for which branch this parifli would be no lefs 
commodious. 

Of

Of woollen manufacture, knitted ftockings feems the: 
flbeft, as requiring moft manual labour, and affording the bed 
ijrecompenfe for it. 

I A ftone bridge over the Findern, and another over the 
■Big-bourne, on the poft-road, would be of great advantage 
to this parifh, for an open communication to all the villages 
Hand towns weft of the river, with Forres and Elgin. For 
flwant of this, the daily pofts are often long detained, lives 
lare frequently endangered, and fometimes loft. In 1781, 
Hi 1 were loft by the overfetting of the ferry-boat on the day 
■of a Forres market. On fuch occafions, there is no prevent- 
ing the people from overloading the boat. 
I The fervitude of thirlage, remains yet a dead weight upon 
jagriculture. It retards all improvements in the machinery 
land art of grinding, occafions great wafte of time, indiffe- 
Irent fervice, and vexatious debates and law-fuits, about ab- 
Iftracted multures. A converfion of all multures, and a con- 
sequent freedom to grind wherever people found themfelves 
Ibeft ferved, and the acceptance of an equivalent, for buying 
off the aftriclion of one heritor's lands to another heritor's 
mills, would bring every thing to rights, and make a gteat 
change for the better. This meafure, adopted by general 
content, would be a laudable conceflion to public utility j 
and, on fuppoiition of full indemnification, could do no pre- 
judice to any. This meafure was long fince adopted in the 
county of Clackmanan. Its happy effects were foon obfer- 
ved, in an emulation among the millers, to excel in then- 
machinery ,'and art, and promp fervice •, and the corn yield- 
ed conliderably more meal than ever it had formerly pro- 
duced, in confequence of an improved management. 

The fale of all grain by a common ftandard of weight, 
will be generally appro v en.

cumulation of a pure white fand, of the fmalleft grit. 
Doubtlefs the fea has, at fome time, fupplied the material ; 
but the winds have always been the arbiters of their form, 
fituation, and lize. They rife gradually on the fouth-weft, 
and are fteep on the fouth-eaft fide. This is the tradl of our 
ftrongeft winds here, which further appears, by the bent and 
falling of trees in the fame direction. The fmalleft parti- 
cles are always the firft fufpended, and the laft that are de- 
pofited by water, after which, they lie neareft to the winds, 
and are eafily fwept away, while ftones, pebbles, fhells, and 
fand of a larger grit, are left upon the beach. This ac- 
counts for the fhape of thefe hills, and for the finenefs and 

purity

purity of their £and. It muft have been a prodigious agita- 
ion of the ocean, that could fo affecl: an inland frith, as to 
throw out, within reach of the wind, fuch accumulations of 
fand, as are now contained in the parifties of Kinlofs, Dyke, 
and Auldearn. But the wide opening into the Moray Frith, 
from Buchan-Nefs to Dungfoay-Head, has made it liable, 
wherever the coaft was flat, to a wider inundation, and deep- 
er load of fand, through the confinement of a large body of 
water, forced up into a narrowing channel. But the vio- 
lent commotions of the German Ocean, are vifible on the 
coaft of Holland, and all along the eaftern coaft of Great 
Britain, from the Goodwin Sands in Kent, to the Fentland 
Frith. 

Though the era of the fand's arrival here, is beyond the 
reach of local tradition, hiftory takes notice of feveral inun- 
dations, when large quantities of fea-fand, might have been 
lodged, and augmented upon our flat and early cultivated coaft. 
The deluge, in later times, that feems moft likely to have 
had the greateft efFeft, in this way, upon our ifland, is that 
inundation of the German Ocean which fwept away the 
princely eftate of Earl Goodwin, in Kent, and left the Good- 
win Sands in its room. Such a commotion of the waters 
I as could produce that efFecl, muft have reached all the friths, 
9 on the eaftern coafts, as far up as the falt-water could flow, 
i and muft have affe£led the navigation, as well as the agri- 
I culture, of the coaft, upon that fide. 

The era of this calamitous event, was in the clofe of the 
J nth century, in the reign of King William Rufus of Eng- 
1 land, and near the demife of King Malcolm Canmore of 
\ Scotland. 

1. Trufsler, who has probably followed Blair's Chrono- 
! logy, and the Englifli hiftorians, in this matter, refers the 
j origin of the Goodwin Sands to the year noo.

i. To the like devaftation in Scotland, and the fupera- 
bundant lodgement of fand upon our coaft, Buchanan feems 
clearly to allude, at the end of the Life of Malcolm Can- 
more ; and though he avoids fpecifying the exadl: year of 
King Malcolm's demife, it is clear, from his defcription, and 
his ufe of the word prodigia, that he has, in this £ matter 
grounded on the authority of Boethius. The indefinite ex- 
preflions of Buchanan, " Inter prodigia hoc tempore nume- 
" ratur, maris Germanici tarn infolita inundatio, ut non 
" agros modo dimerferit, et arenis obruerit, fed et vicosjH 
" oppida et arces everterit." 

3. Boethius, according to whom King Malcolm died vtA 
1097, comes within three year's of Trufsler's date, and ex-'/ 
tends this commotion of the fea exprelsly to the Moray \ 
Frith. " Incidit Malcomi mors anno redemptions fupra

!B. vii. ch. 50. takes notice of the appearance of a comet, 
which feems, at leaft, to have much affected the atmofphere-, 
and poffibly its approximation to the earth, in its aphelion, 
might have occafioned an unufual fwell of tides, and contri- 
buted, in that year, to make the commotion of the waters 
(more violent and deftruaive. " Anno Dom. 1107, incepit 
" ordo Trinitatis, &amp; eodem anno, imperii Henrici Quarti

plicable to the clouds than to the fea, overwhelming the beft 
and warmeft cultivated lands on the coaft, beft adapted to 
the production of winter grain. For thefe two laft quota- 
tions, I am indebted to Profeffor Macleod, Sub-principal of 
King's College, Aberdeen ; and there feems to be no doubt, 
that all the above quotations relate to the era of the Good- 
win Sands. 

There is another pafTage in Fordun, B. x. ch. 22. quoted 
in Lord Hailes's Annals, that feems to relate to an after in- 
undation, about 1266, being more than 160 years later than 
the above dates. " Sed in profefto undecem mille virgi-

I have alfo been told, upon good authority, that there is

lying in the Advocates Library, at Edinburgh, that would

mentioned, provided there be no miftake about the date 
viz. that the whole laigh of Moray had been covered by 
the fea in the year ioio. A tranfpofition of the two mid. 
die figures, (which would be no furprifing flip of memory), 
would bring the year ioio, mentioned by my informer, to 
correfpond exactly with Trufsler's date of the origin of the 
Goodwin Sands, in noo. Such as have accefs, may have 
recourfe to that book. 

Many of the beft lands in this parifh, which, from their, 
lituation, could not efcape being overflowed in the nth cen- 
tury, ftill continue in fafety and great fertility. 

The effe&amp;s of the lodgement of fand then made, have-, 

fpread confiderably during the laft 700 years, and over- 

whelmed, with a deep cover of dry fand, many grounds 

which the fea had, at its reflux, left tolerably clear. The 

north corner of this parifh, in which was comprehended, 

with other lands, the large and populous barony of Culbin, 

-was, in the laft century, called the Granary of Moray ; but 

the depofited fand, which had been piled up by the winds 

into three enormous hills, and efpecially below Mavifton it 

Auldearn parifh, has long continued to affeft the neareft cul 

tivated lands. From this great refervoir, the fand has beer 

in a conftant progrefs, from the fouth-weft to the north-eaft 

and a very large proportion of the three Mavifton hills 

have, in my remembrance, been blown away, and lodged ii 

the north extremity of this parifh. The barony of Culbin 

lying neareft to the Mavifton hills, and mod in the trad 0 

the ftrongeft winds, was moft expofed, and for many years 

fuffered gradual encroachments, and diminutions of rent am 

population. It was only in the end of the laft century, tha 

the manfion-houfe and gardens were overwhelmed, by a'*| 

uncommonly violent drifting of the fand, and the mefTuage ^ 

houfe removed to Em-hill, a remaining corner of that-eftateH| 

quite out of the trad of the winds. Yet, fince that time 
u tb 



of Dyke and Moy. 233 

the lands of Drumreach, and Lake, and even fome part of 
Binfnefs, have been covered. But, from the trad of the 
winds, it can do little more damage in that quarter than has 
been done already. About 20 years ago, a march-ftone was 
placed on the top of a fand-hill, from 40 to 50 feet in 
height, to make it more confpicuous ; fome faid, the march 
would tumble down ; others, that it would fink out of fight, 
in the fand. But the ftone always remained vifible, finking 
gradually, with the hill, till the hill had entirely forfook it, 
and fled. From the north-eaft corner of this parifh, where 
the fand has been long accumulating, it is by ftrong winds 
carried into the fea, and fometimes is carried acrofs the river 
mouth. At the town of Findern, in a blowing day, one may 
feel the fand lharply ftriking on his face, from the weft 
fide. 

Another effect of the fand-hills, is a change made, in the 
laft century, of the bed and mouth of the river, which has 
now got a fhorter paffage to the fea, and occafioned an en- 
tire removal of the harbour and town of Findern, for more 
than half-a-mile down the frith. There is a narrow neck 
of land, belonging to the parifh of Kinlofs, and barony of 
Meurton, to which it lay contiguous, while it was on the 
right fide of the river. It ftretched up the frith, for about 
3 miles, towards the Mavifton hills. On this neck, now co- 
vered with fand and bent-grafs, and fit only for flieep pa- 
fture, and fummer hnts, for ftell fifliings, flood the town and 
harbour of Findern, three-fourths of a mile weft of where 
they now are. At the wefter end of this neck of land, now 
called 

The Old Bar, lay the mouth of the river, which then 
run between this bar ant! the eftate of Culbin, in the 
parifh of Dyke., The old bed of the river is yet vi- 
fible, and the old bar is yet infulated during the flood of 
fpr'mg tides, except at its wefter end, where the ground is

higheft, in a place where the river had formerly run. This 
fliews, that the river has been darned up by the drifting of 
fand; and that this had mod probably happened during the 
high winds in the laft century, which gave the finiftung 
ftroke to the depopulation of Culbin. As the river then en- 
tered the frith fo near to Mavifton hills, it is prefumable, that 
the fand had then choked and filled up the mouth and bed 
of the river, and this, with concurrence of the firft land fpet, 
has made the river cut its way through the eafter end of 
the flat and narrow neck before mentioned, fo as to leave it, 
with the old town and harbour, on the left fide. 

People alive 40 years ago, remembered to have feen the 
ftones of old Findern removed to the eafter fide of the new 
channel, and applied in building the firft houfes of the pre- 
fent town, on the Meurton fide, from which the old bar, 
now contiguous to the parilh of Dyke, had been completely 
disjoined. 

Since the former channel was deferted, both ends of the 
old bar have been confiderably waflied away and fliortened 
by the tides. Some of the ftones of the old town, which 
have fubfided, are yet to be feen at ebb of tide, in a clear 
day, lying at the bottom of the falt-water, when boats are 
paffing over them. And thefe remnants of the old houfes, 
are more than half-a-mile weft of where the prefent town 
ftands. 

But though the river forced a direft paffage into the ica, 
it has not been able to keep a clear channel into the deep 
water. A new bar, oppofite to its prefent mouth, is 
ftretching weftward, between which and the old bar, the 
fafeft accefs into the prefent harbour is from the weft.

years 1790, 1791, and 179a, there v tf re, at an average, 18 
births, 4 marriages, and 12 deaths yearly. So that popula- 
tion, in this panto, is gradually increafmg, which is owing, 
principally, to the encouragement given by the proprietor 
to farmers and tradefmen of every denomination. .There 
are 1 1 7 inhabited houfes, including one lint and one corn- 
mill. Two fmall villages lie at the foot of the hills, viz. 
Collace, fituated on a rivulet, and Kinrofiie, on elevated 
ground, not far from the church. 

Agricultitre, Wc- Improvements in agriculture are car- 
ried on, in this parim, with great ardour and fuccefs. A- 
bout 20 years ago, a confiderable proportion of it confifted 
of out-field, which, though very improveable, was held^ra- 
tis by the tenants, and, on that account, was negiefted. E- 
very farm was then compoled of detached fields, or feveral 
were blended together in run-rig ; which were effectual bars 
Xfi improvement. On his acceffion to the eftate, Lord Dun- 
finnan, fole proprietor of the parim, formed a judicious ar- 
rangement, which has been productive of the moft beneficial 
efft&amp;s. The lands are now divided into regular farms, and 
partly inclofed ; and a certain quantity of out-field is allot- 
ted to every farm. Handforae farm-houfes have been built; 
fome of them at the proprietor's expence, and others by the 
tenant. Seven- of the farm-houfes are built of ftone and 

: - " lime, 



Statijlical Account 



lime, and covered with (late •, and the reft, even thofe occtu 
pied by tradefmen, are fufHciently neat and commodious. 
A free houfe and garden is affigned to every aged and in- 
firm perfon, who is incapacitated for the duties of a&amp;ive life, 
and unable to procure fubfiftence by labour. 

Dunfinnan-houfe, the proprietor's refidence, is pleafantly 
fituated, in the north-weft corner of the pari/h, on a gentle' 
eminence, 7 miles from Perth, to the north of the turnpike 
road which leads to Cupar-Angus. It is well (heltered 
from the northerly wind, by a large and thriving plantation 
of foreft trees. The manfion-houfe is elegant, and the offi- 
ces are well built, handfome, and fpacious. 

In that neighbourhood, feveral extenfive tratts, formerly 
heathy and barren, are now enclofed, and in a ftate of high 
cultivation. 

In confequence of recent improvements, confiderable- 
quantities of fown grafs, turnips, potatoes, and flax, befides 
oats and barley, are annually raifed. Some wheat is fown, 
and yields moderate returns. The fcheme adopted by an 
intelligent and enterprifing tenant is as follows : His farm 
is fubdivided into feven parts. The firft is fallow, well 
prepared with dung, and a fufficient quantity of lime ; fe- 
cond, barley or wheat; third, turnip, potatoes* or peafe ; 
fourth, barley, with clover and rye-grafs; fifth, grafs ; fixth, 
grafs ; feventh, oats. The fuccefsful efforts of another te- 
nant, merit particular notice. His fmall farm, fome years 
ago, confined of fields, partly dry and ftony, partly wet and 
marfhy. This rude trad, he enclofed by a fix feet ditch, 
drained by means of rumbling fewers, and ploughed for two 
or three years. When thoroughly pulverifed, he applied 
lime, at the rate of 40 bolls of (hells per acre, with as much 
dung as he could procure. In every field, thus prepared, 
he fowed oats, and the year following, barley. The crops 
anfwered his mod fangume expectation, and were remark- 
ably 



of Collace. 



239 



eably luxuriant. His fuccefs directed the attention of other 
■farmery, to fields they had neglected, and incited them to 
■follow his example. Some of the tenants, indeed, are not 
ffufficiently attentive to a regular rotation of crops ; but all 
■of them are careful to extirpate noxious weeds, pulverife the 
■foil, and apply proper quantities of lime, which is purcha- 
sed at Perth, at the rate of 1 s. 9 d. per boll, of ftiells, if 
sbrought from Lord Elgin's kilns ; and 2 s. 4 d. per boll, if 
■imported from England. Two forts of bear, viz. barley 
land chefter, are promifcuoufly ufed by fome, and feparately 
fey other farmers. Dutch oats were lately introduced, and 
fihave two valuable properties, namely, they arrive fooner at 
■maturity, and yield a greater quantity of meal than the 
common oats. However, as they foon degenerate, and are 
lealily fhaken by the wind, it is not likely that they will pre- 
vail in this part of the country. 

Prices of Farming Utenji/s, Labour, and Provijions. — The 
jrices of farming utenfils, labour, and provifions, are nearly 
he fame as in neighbouring diftri6ls. There are 45 ploughs

Ecclcjiajlical State. — The few following facts will (hew 
the ecclefiartical ftate of Collace, as far a; it is necdTary to 
be exhibited in a work of this nature. The church, an old 
and indifferent fabric, ftands on a riling ground, about a mile 
weftward of Dunfinnan hill. The manfe and offices, neat, 
handfome, and commodious, were built A. D. 1778, on a 
new fite, nearer the church than the former manfe, which is 
in the village of Collace. The ftipend is 73 bolls victual, 
and L. 5 : 11 : x£ Sterling, with a glebe of 74- acres. The 
names of the minifters, fince the commencement of this cen- 
tury, are, Mr Smith; Mr Ramfay, fettled A. D. 17 13 ; Mr 
Faichney, 1739; Mr Kilgour, 1774; Mr Baird, 1778 ; Mr 
Macliefh, 1783. 

Poor. — In 1783, the poor's funds did not exceed L. 84; 
at prefect they are L. 141, 14 s. The poor are fupported 
by collections in the church, mort-cloth money, and fome 
feat-rents ; the annual amount of all which may be L. 1 j 
Sterling. 

Quarries and Roads. — A quarry, in the village of Col- 
lace, was fuppofed, for many years, to have been exhaufted; 
but workmen lately employed to explore it, found a bed of 
excellent free-ftone ; and appearances indicate abundance of 
the fame valuable article in other parts of the parifh. The 
great turnpike- road from Perth to Cupar traverfes this 
parifh, in an oblique direction. Other roads are repaired 
by ftatute-labour, converted into money, at the rate of 8 s, 
or 12 s. for every plough. 

Antiquities 



of Collace. 241 

Antiquities. — The moft noted remairfof antiquity, is Mac- 
beth's Caftle, on Dunfinnan hill, in the fouth-eaft corner-of 
the parifti. This remarkable hill is infulated, and of an 
oval form, with a flat and verdant fummit. The affent, 
from the village of Collace, on the north-weft, is gradual; 
and there fome veftiges of a winding road may ftill be tra- 
ced. On all other fides, the hill is fteep, and of difficult ac- 
cefs. It is feparated from a hill on the eaft, by a narrow 
valley, covered with verdure. The area on which the fort 
flood, being 168 yards in length, 100 in breadth near the 
eaft, and 55 near the weft extremity, was anciently envi- 
roned by a wall of ftone, without cement. The entrance 
into the fort was at the north -eaft corner of the area. Tho' 
no trace of the fort now appears, yet, it is probable, that 
the foundation is entire, as the building was confumed by 
fire. It muft, therefore, be the ardent wifti of every anti- 
quary, that this fpot were thoroughly explored. Several 
years ago, fome gentlemen, in digging a pit near the middle 
of the area, difcovered pieces of the bones of animals, brick, 
and burnt corn. At a remote period, this was, no doubt, 
one of the ftations whence fignals, on any alarm, were made 
by fire. The ftory of the Ufurper's defeat, flight northward, 
and death at Lumphanan, is known to every reader conver- 
fant in the hiftory of Scotland.

t not far from Dunfinnan-houfe, at a place called the Cape *, 
;] Macbeth, taking a fuperftitious turn, he applied to them for 
'I advice, and by their counfel, he built a lofty caftle, upon 
I the top of an adjoining hill, fince called Dunfinnan, which, 
! in the Gaelic language, fignifies " The hill of ants" implying 
.the great labour and induftry fo efientialry requifite tor col-

j itrong, as well as fortified by art, being partly defended by 
I high outer rocks, and partly furrounded by an outer wall, 
I which enclofed a confiderable fpace of ground, for exercifing 
. the men, &amp;c. There was alfo a foffe, which joined the wall 
i and outer rocks, and a high rampart which environed the 
I whole, and defended the caftle, itfelf large and well fortifi- 
I ed. From the top of the hill, there is an extenfive view 
J of above 50 miles every way, comprehending Fifelhire, 
I the hills in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, Glen-Almond, 
I Crieff, the hills in the neighbourhood of Blair- Athol, and 
Braemarr ; Strathmore alfo and a great part of Angus are 
immediately under view. In ftiort, there could not be a 
j more commanding fituation.

him to Birnam wood, where accidentally they were inclu, 
ccd, either by way of diftin&amp;ion, or from fome other mo, 
tive, to ornament their bonnets, or to carry about with 
them, in their hands, the branches of trees. The people in 
the neighbourhood ftated, as the tradition of the country, 
that they were diftinguiflied in this htuation by the fpy, whotM 
Macbeth had ftationed to watch their motions. He then began 
to defpair, in confequence of the witches predictions, whef 
had warned him to beware " when Birnam wood fhould 
" come to Duniinane and when Malcolm prepared to aci 
tack the caftle, where it was principally defended by theoute* 
rocks, he immediately deferted it, and flying, ran up the 
oppofite hill, purfued by Macduff; but finding it impoffiblo 
to efcape, he threw himfelf from the top of the hill, wa$ 
killed upon the rocks, and buried at the Lang Man's 
Grave*, as it is called, which is ftill extant. For the pur- 
pofe of giving a better idea of thefe circumftances, a flight 
and imperfe£t fketch, drawn up at the time, is annexed. 

Such were the traditions in the neighbourhood of Dun- 
finnan Caftle, in 1772; and the reader will naturally be 
ftruck, with the refemblance between them, and the celebra- 
ted play, which Shakefpeare founded on the hifiory of Mao- 
beth. There is every reafon, indeed, to helieve, that our 
great dramatift was upon the fpot himfelf, and was inipi- 
red with fuch uncommon poetical powers, from having 
viewed the places, where the fcenes he drew, were fuppo- 
fed to have been tranfa&amp;ed. In Guthrie's Hiftory of Scot- 
land, vol. viii. p. 358. it is ftated, that, anno 1599, King 
James defired Elizabeth to fend him, in that year, a com- 
pany of Englilh comedians, with which requeft Ihe compli- 
ed* 

* It would be worth while to examine this grave, as fome curious facls 
might be afcertained from it. It is proper to add, that not fur from it is the

rnurdered. See the annexed (ketch.

, ed, and James gave them a licence to act in his capital, and 
i before his Court. " I have great reafon," he adds, " to think 
\ » that the immortal Shakefpeare was of the number." And 
in the Statiftical Account of Perth, vol. xviii. p. 522. we 
: are told, that plays were actually exhibited in Perth, only a 
few miles from Dunfinnan, in 1589. It is extremely im- 
! probable, that the occurrences, as narrated by Shakefpeare, 
land the traditions of the country, could have borne fo ftrong 
a refemblance, unlefs he had gathered them upon the fpot 
Ihimfelf, or employed fome other perfon for that purpofe. 
The only material difference is, that, according to tradition, 
Macbeth threw himfelf from the top of a rock ; but it was 
I much more poetical, as narrated by Shakefpeare, his falling 
!by the hands of Macduff, whom he had fo greatly injured f. 
I About the period alluded to, anno 1772, 1 took much plea- 
fure in tracing the antiquities of Scotland, on the fpot where 
the different occurrences happened ; but was too young, (be- 
ing then only about 18 years of age), to do juftice to fuch in- 
terefting inquiries. I have been tempted, however, from 
the peculiar hiftorical importance of the cattle of Dunfin- 
nan, to flate the fubftance of the traditions I had collected re- 
fpedling it ; and perhaps it may not be improper to add, that 
I found the traditions regarding the battle of Luncarty, and 
other ancient events, much more diltincl: and accurate than 
is commonly imagined ; and, in general, authenticated by 

the 

f Iliftory narrates, that Macbeth was put to death at Lumphannan ; but 
the tradition of the country is, that he was killed and buried in the 
neighbourhood of his own caftle. It is angular that Buchanan, in his Hi- 
ftory, points out the ftory of Macbeth, as admirably calculated for the dra- 
ma. Did Shakefpeare take the firft hint from, or give it to, the Scottiflihi- 
ftorian ? The idea of Shakefpeare having been in Scotland, is rendered ftill 
more probable, by the number of Scottifli words and phrafes made ufe of in 
his plays, and alfo from his parody on ihe well known lines in the Scotch 
£allad, beginning, " In days when our King Robert rang."

County of Orkney, Synod of Orkney, and Presby 
tery of Kirkwall.) 



By the Rev. Mr Hugh Ross, Preacher of the GofpeL</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, and Extent. 

THE origin of the names of thefe united pariflies is un- 
known. They are fituated in the northern extremi- 
ty of the largeft of the Orkney iflands, commonly called 
the Mainland, in the prefbytery ot Kirkwall, fynod and 
county of Orkney. They are bounded on the north, by 
the ocean ; on the north-eaft, by a frith called Enhallow 
Sound, which divides Evie from the iflands of Enhallow 
and Roufay ; on the eaft, by the continuance of the fame 
found, feparating thefe pariflies from the iflands of Wier, 
Gairfay, and Sbapinfhay ; on the fouth, by a bay of the fea 
•ailed Damfay bound, feparating Rendaii from the pariOi

of Kirkwall and St Ollay, suid part of the parifh of Frith • 
and on the weft, by the parifhes of Harray and Birfay 
from which thefe united parifhes are feparated by a chain 
of hilly ground, wholly covered with peat-mofs and heath 
and a frelh water loch or lake, two miles long, and about 
one-half mile broad. Thefe parifhes lie wholly along the 
fea-fh ore. The extreme length, from the fouth-eaft point 
of Rendall, to the north-weft point of Evie, is about tea 
miles ; the breadth of the inhabited part,, from one mile to 
a mile and a half. There is a kind of earthen fence, called 
the Hill Dike, which runs along the whole length of both 
parifhes, and feparates the corn and grafs grounds from the 
hills, mofles, and moors, which lie betwixt thefe and the 
neighbouring parifhes, and which form an undivided com- 
mon. From this dike the cultivated ground generally 
lies in an eafy flope to the fea-fhore, which is low and flat 
till within about a mile of the north weft extremity of Evie, 
when it rifes into a bold rocky promontory called Coftay- 
head, which forms the fouth fide of the entrance to We- 
ftray Frith, the north fide of the entrance being formed by 
a fimilar promontory in the ifland of Weftray, at about five 
or fix leagues diftance. The ifland of Gairfay, feparated 
from Rendall by a ftrait of about a mile and a half broad, 
with three holms, or fmall uninhabited iflands, lie in thefe 
United parifhes. Gairfay is a green hill, of nearly a coni- 
cal figure, from three to four miles in circumference at the 
bafe, having a pretty large manfion-houfe, now almoft in 
ruins, and a tolerable farm, with four fmall farms, and fome 
cottages, lying on the fouth fide of it. It has alfo an excel- 
lent fmall harbour, called the Mill-burn, perfectly fecured 
on all fides by the ifland itfelf, and a fmall holm, which co- 
vers the entrance to the fouth, leaving a paffage on each fide 
of it to the harbour. 

Extent 



of Evie and Rendall. 



■ Extent ofCoaJl, Kelp, i$c— The whole extent' of coaft, 
tfsclufive of Gairfay and the holms, may be 13 or 14 miles ; 
and the fhores, being moftly flat and rocky, produce fea- 
weed or tang, from which kelp is made to the amount of 
70 tons at an average, yearly. The expence of manufa&amp;u- 
.ring which is from a' guinea to a guinea and a half per ton 5 
but the expence of .this, as well as every other kind of la- 
bour, is daily increasing. 

Soil and Culture Thefe parifhes are tolerably fertile, 

and produce pretty good crops, confidering the variable cli- 
mate and defective mode of culture. The foil, in general, 
is rather fhallow, an admixture of clay and fand on a rocky 
bottom, which renders it wet in winter, and liable to be 
poached by the cattle, as there is no winter herding, nor 
any inclofures. The corn lands have been kept in perpe- 
tual tillage for time immemorial, without fallowing, or 
any rotation of crops, except bear and fmall grey oats alter- 
nately. In Evie the principal manure is ware "or fea-weed, 
of which there is generally a fufficient quantity drove ori 
fhore during the winter and fpring. In Rendall, having 
little of this kind of manure, as its (hores are furrounded 
with iflands, they ufe a compofl: of earth and dung, and in 
fome places fea-weed of an inferior quality. To procure 
this earth, they pare off the furface of the grafs and pafture 
grounds, in many places to the totally impoverilhing the 
foil, and rendering it wholly ufelefs. The Orkney fide-* 
plough, with one ftilt, is univerfally ufed. It is drawn by 
three or four fmall horfes a-breatt, and though, to a ftranger, 
it feems a very aukward trifling machine, totally unfit for 
tillage, (as it certainly is in a ftiff foil), yet, where the 
ground has been in conftant tillage, with an experienced 
ploughman, it performs a great deal of vvork,.and in a man- 
ner far beyond expectation ; infoamch, that the prefent in- 

Vol. XX. I i cumbent, 



250 Statijlical Account 



cumbent, a llranger in Orkney, and much prejudiced 
againft this machine, affirms, that after repeated careful 
trials, he could difcover no difference betwixt the crops rai- 
fed after this plough, and the crops raifed after a very good 
two-fliked one. The returns of bear are from five to fix 
feeds ; of the oats three, or three and a half, feldom or ever 
four. The only improvement attempted in thefe parifhes 
is rearing potatoes. In 1769, there were none raifed in 
either pariffi, except a few in Rendall, in lazy-beds; and as 
late as 1784 there were none raifed in Evie. They are 
now univerfally cultivated with fuccefs, in fufficient quan- 
tities for the inhabitants, but very few for fale, there being 
no market for them. The only other vegetable raifed is- 
cabbage, which thrives exceeding well ; and the mini- 
frer's garden mews, - that all the other vegetables raifed m 
the north of Scotland, would thrive equally well in thefe 
.pariflbes. The ground in cultivation amounts to about 1200 
planks, of 40 fathoms, or 80 yards fquare, each •, all the 
other ground confifts of meadow, (from which fome hay is 
made), and fome very good natural grafs and pafture. By 
far the greater part of the rents are payable in kind, that is, 
in bear or malt, oat-meal, tallow, butter, poultry, peats, 
and but a trifle in money. The whole amounting, at the 
ordinary converlion, to about L. 800 Sterling. 

Size of Farms, Horfes, Cattle, i€c. — The farms are gene- 
rally very fmall, confifting of from 6 to 10 or 12 planks of 
arable land, belides grafs and pafture. There are indeed 
three or four tenants who rent tolerable farms ; but of thefe 
they fubfet a confiderable part. There are belides thefe 
a good number of cottagers, who have a fmall patch of corn 
land, with two or three black-cattle, and perhaps a fmall 
Shetland horfe. The number of horfes in thefe pariihes is 

fully £00, worth from L. 4 to L. 10 Sterling. This is per- 
haps

flaps double the number neceffary, owing principally to cuf- 
tom and the fmallnefs of the farms ; very few of them are 
bred in thefe parifhes, but are bought when year-olds from 
dealers, who bring them over from Caithnefs and Suther- 
land, and are fold again to the fame dealers, from four 
old and upwards, very few of them dying in the parifh. 
There are about 1300 black-cattle, principally cows and 
queys, all reared in the parifti ; the greater part of which are 
fold out of it at different ages, very few of them being con- 
fumed by the inhabitants. The prices of them are almoft 
doubled within thefe few years, being now, in 1797, from 
two to four guineas a head. Few or no oxen are ufed or 
reared. The number of fheep may be about 2000, though, 
as they all run wild, without any herd, it is impoffible to 
afcertain their number with any precifion ; very few fheep 
are fold, being either confumed by the owners, or allowed 
to die of old age, or perifh for want of care. No care 
whatever is taken of meliorating the breed of them, or of 
the black-cattle. The number of f wine may be about 400 
or 500, of a very diminutive fpecies. They are fold, when 
full grown, from 4 s. to 8 s. They go at large from the 
end of harveft till the month of May, and being never 
ringed, and getting no food from their owners, do incre- 
dible mifchief with their fnouts both to corn and grafs 
grounds. Every family rears a number of geefe and other 
poultry. 

Servants Wages. — The wages of a capable man-fervant 
are from L. 3 to L. 4, 10 s. Sterling per annum ,• of a wo- 
man 20 s. to 30 s. All fervants are maintained in the fa- 
mily. Men-fervants are rendered fcarce by confiderable 
•drains to the navy, the Greenland and herring fifheries, 
but above all to Hudfon's Bay. The making of kelp, alfo, 
fakes up a good many hands in the fummer months. —

1 here are different tradefpeople in the parifh, fufficient to 
ferve its purpofes ; but no manufactory carried on defer- 
ving the name, except that of linen-yarn ; a very confidcr- 
able quantity of which is fpurj for fale, befides what is 
wrought up into coarfe cloth for the ufe of the inhabitants 
and for annual exportation to Shetland, Newcaftle, &amp;c. 
There are alio fome woollen fluffs manufactured for fale, 
befides fluffs, coarfe blankets, and woollen cloths, for the 
ufe of the inhabitants ; but there is not one mill for cloth, 
nor a pet fon who can drefs it up after it is wove, in this pa- 
rid), nor even in the county. 

Boats and Fifi.nng. — There are about 30 boats in thefe . 
p.arifhes, from i| to 2 tons burden, with 4, and a very few 
with 6, oars each. The fifh caught are, excellent cod and 
ling, dogfifh and' a few fkate, hollibat and haddocks, all caught 
with hand-lines ; and faithe or colelifli of different ages ; alfo. 
loblters, and razor or fpout-fifh, and cockles. The filhing 
appears to be very much neglected. As there are no mere- 
ly profeffional filhers, and no ready markets, every man 
fillies for his own family ufe only, when he can fpare time 
from his other avocations. 

Bars to Impravcmmt. — Thefe are chiefly the intermix- 
ture of property and farms, want' of inclofures, fliort, or 
rather no leafes, and, above all, the habits and prejudices of 
the inhabitants. Owing to thefe, no material improvement 
can take, place in the mode of managing the fmall farms; ar£ 
no encouragement whatever is given by the proprietors to 
induce the farmers to attempt it. Almoft the whole of the 
arable land of thefe pariflies lay formerly in run-rig, as a 
fmall part of it Mill does. Above 30 years ago, a divifion 
took place, but fo injudicious, that even where there are large 
?nd very compact: fields belonging to a Angle proprietor, 



ofEvie and Rendall. 253 

t 

land divided into nine or a dozen farms, each farmer pofied 
:fes perhaps twelve patches of ground, of a plank each, feat- , 
tered over the whole. And though quarries of excellent 
iftone, and eafily wrought, lie every where near the furface, 
mo encouragement is given to inclofing ; and the people feem 
averfe to a mode that would impede what they think the 
natural liberty of themfelves and their cattle, to traverfe 
every field at pleafure during the greateft part of the year. 
The prefent minifter wifhed to inclofe at leaft part of his 
glebe, but met with every obftruclion, not only from his 
loweft and raoft turbulent neighbours, but alfo from the 
late £a£tor of his principal heritor. 

Were proper encouragement given, and prudent methods 
followed, to promote improvements in agriculture, there 
cannot be a doubt but that the value of thefe parifhes might 
je greatly increafed, both to the proprietors and communi- 
ty. There are 13 heritors in thefe parifhes. Only two of 
them are of any confequence, and both of them non-refi- 
dent, viz. Lord Armadale, and John Traile, Efq; of Wood- 
wick, who has but lately fucceeded to a very old and in- 
firm relation. The higheft rent of the other heritors is a- 
bout L. 12 Sterling, and the loweft 5 s. Almoft all the 
lands pay a feu-duty, and fome of them a very heavy one, 
to Lord Dundas, as reprefenting the Crown in the earldom, 
or as tackfman of the bifhopric of Orkney. 

Condition of the People and Poors Funds. — In the former 
jefpecl:, they differ very little from the neighbouring di- 
ftri£ts. None of them can be called rich, and but few of 
them extremely indigent. The poors funds are miferable 
indeed. The annual colleftions in both parifhes feldom ex- ' 
ceed L. 3 Sterling; and fines from delinquents, marriage^ 
and mort-cloth dues, amount to ftill lefis. Out of this, two 
precentors and feflion-clerk, and two kirk-officers, have hi- 
therto 



254 



Statiftical Account 



therto been paid, and formerly even the kirks thatched ; fo 
that very little remained to be diftributed, as there are no 
other funds. 



Population. — An accurate lift of the population of the* 
parifb.es was taken up in 1789, when the number of fouls 
was 1564. The lifts of baptifms and marriages, taken 1:0m 
the regifters, are as follow :

Owing to the diftance of Rendall from the minifter, 
change of clerks, and the people endeavouring to evade the 
trifling dues of regiftration, efpecially during the late tax 
on births, 8cc. no accurate lift of baptifms in that parifh 
could be obtained for the laft ten years, nor any complete 
lift of marriages ; and no regular regifter of burials has ever 
been kept in thefe parifhes. 

Many married men go to Hudfon's Bay, and fome to the 
navy, and leave their wives at home till their return. 

Thefe parifhes are tolerably healthy, and pretty free from 
contagious difcrders, nor are any particular local diftempers 
kjjown. 



Longevity. 



of Evie and Rendall. 



255 



Longevity There are four people now alive above 80 

years of age ; one of 86 •, but none have reached 90, at leaft 
fince the year 1769. 

Religion, Kirks, Manfe, Stipend, Glebes, and Schools.-— 
The people of thefe parifhes are in general decent and well 
difpofed : giofs crimes are unknown. They are free from 
profanenefs on the one hand, and, hitherto, from fanaticifm, 
on the other. — The kirk of Evie was fituated near the 
manfe, and near the middle of that parifh, 17 or 18 miles 
north-weft from Kirkwall. And the kirk of Rendall lies 
almoft in the fouth extremity of that parifti. They were 
both, originally, poor fmall houfes, thatched annually with 
ftraw. As far back as the year 1769, when the prefent in- 
cumbent came to Orkney, they were both in a very rui- 
nous lituation ; but as the late incumbent, who was fettled 
in 1725, was very old and infirm, and, for ten years^never 
went beyond his own garden, no fteps were taken by him 
to get them any ways repaired ; and the prefent incumbent, 
officiated in them, in that ruinous ftate, without a pane of 
glafs, or even a window-frame, as affiftant and fucceffor, 
from the year 1772. Upon the death of his predeceflor, in 
the year 1781, he applied to the principal heritors, and af- 
terwards, at their defire, to his prefbytery, when, after a le- 
gal vilitation, where the principal heritors aflifted, they were 
both judicially condemned as ruinous and irreparable ; and 
upon a petition from the principal heritors, in which all the 
reft of the heritors, as well as Lord Dundas the patron, (but 
who has no property in the parifh), acquiefced, the prefby- 
tery ordained a new centrical church to be built for the 
whole charge, in place of the two ruinous ones ; fixed the 
dimenfions, and gave a general decreet for the expence of 
building the new church, of L. 156 Sterling-, againft which 
ao objections were offered. The minifter continued, as u- 

fuaL 



Statiftical Account 



fual, to officiate alternately in thefe condemned kirks, till 
the year 1788, when the danger became fo confpicuous, that 
he fortunately deferted that of Evie, as the walls foon after- 
wards tumbled down on a Sunday, and the materials were 
fet up to au&amp;ion. The minifter then travelled every Sun- 
day to Rendall, and officiated in that ruinous houfe, (once 
with only 17 hearers), till October 1794, when, having loft 
his health by officiating there, and that houfe alfo beco- 1 
ming very hazardous, he was obliged, by the injunctions of f 
his phyiician, to defert it ; fo that, fince that period, there 
has been no public worfhip in this charge, except in the 
open air, in the church-yard. He has repeatedly applied to  
the heritors, or their factors, and the very hard cafe of this 
charge has been often and warmly recommended by his 
prefbytery and fynod to the General Affembly, but no re- • 
drefs has been obtained ; and thefe matters continue in this 
deplorable fituation at the prefent moment, September 
1797. 

After foroe litigation, and confiderable expence to the mi- 
nifter, a new manfe was built in 1784 j but was neither 
floored nor plaftered, (though the minifter was obliged to 
inhabit it), till 1786. It is neat and commodious, but ex- 
ceeding infufficient, receiving water at almoft every part of 
the walls and roof; having been built by two contractors 
from Edinburgh, whofe accounts are faid to be unfettled to 
this day. 

The ftipend was decreeted in 1759, and is L. 51 : 6 : 8 
Sterling, and L. 3 : 6 : 8 for communion-elements, all in 
money. There are three glebes, one near the kirk of Ren- 
dall ; a very good one near the manfe ; but, like the other 
farms, in detached parcels ; and a third in the north end of 
Evie, two miles from the manfe. Of this laft, the whole 
victual rent, (and for which the minifter is accountable), is 

payable

payable to Lord Armadale, in name of teinds. The yearly- 
value of all the glebes, and a lifpond of butter, (32 libs. 
Dutch), payable out of a fmall farm in the parifli of Bir- 
iay, is about L. 20 Sterling. There are alfo manufactured, 
on die ihores of the glebes, nearly two tons of kelp yearly. 

There is a very decent ienfible fchoolmafter in Evie, 
with a falary of L. 12 Sterling per annum, paid by the So- 
ciety for Propagating Chriftian Knowledge ; he is exceed- 
ingly well attended ; fometimes, in winter, by 90 fcholars, 
from whom, however, he derives little or no emolument. 
By his great care, diligence, and prudence, for near 46 years, 
in this office, he has been of the greater! advantage to this 
parilh. There are alfo a kind of two parochial fchoolma- 
Hers in Rendall, and on the confines of both parifhes, with 
&amp; falary of L. 3 each, with fome trifling fchool-fees, of about 
40 s. each ; but there are no tolerable fchool-houfes in either 
'pariih. 

Tides and Harbours. — A very ftrong tide runs along the 
ihores of thefe parifhes, from the Weftern Ocean at Coftay 
Head, to Damfay Sound, and Kirkwall Road; the tide of 
flood running from north-weft to fouth-eaft. Belides the 
harbour in Gairfay, there is another very good one for mo- 
derate fued veffels at Aikernefs in Evie ; and as, to the fouth- 
ward of Enhallow, the mores are all land-locked, and good 
anchorage, a veflel may ride in every bay. ,

(County of Orkney. Synod of Orkney, Presbyter* 
of Kirkwall.)

<p>Name, Situation, and Extent, 

'TT^HESE united parifties are fituated in the eaftera ex- 
tremitj of Pomona or Mainland, the largeft of the 
Orkney ifles ; in the prelbytery of Kirkwall, fynod and 
county of Orkney. St Andrew's, which is the principal i 
parifh, feems to derive its name from the tutelar faint o: 
S t' uid, to whom the church is dedicated. It is bounded  
on the weft, by the parifh of Kirkwall and St Olay ; on the 
north-weft, by Inganefs Bay ; on the north, by ShapinGiay I 
Frith; on the eaft, by Stronfay Fiith; on the fouth, and j 
fouth-eaft, by the Bay of Deerneis and the German Oceans 

ant :i

and on the fouth-weft, by the parifli of Holme. It is about 
fix miles long, and from one to three miles broad ; and is 
joined to the peninfula of Deernefs by a narrow neck of 
land, about a mile long. Tradition fays, that this peninfula 
was once frequented by deers, from whence the name 
Deernefs. In Gaelic, which may have been the language 
of the country under the Pictifh. kingdom, Dearncfs, or 
Durnefs, fignifies a peninfulated promontory. It lies fouth- 
caft from St Andrews, from which it is almoft feparated by 
Deer Sound ; and the reft of its mores are warned by the 
German Ocean. From the Mull-head to the Ifthmus, it is 
four and a half miles long, and varies in breadth from one 
*o three miles. 

Soil, Culture, and Crops.-~-The parifli of St Andrews is 
in general flat •, and the foil is loam and mofs interfperfed 
with (tones, upon a deep cold clay and tilly bed. Hence it 
is naturally wet and boggy in many places. It is ftifF to 
plough, and, in general, from the want of manure, is not 
very productive. Around the mores of Deernefs, fand 
prevails mod ; higher up, it is loam and clay ; and the 
middle of this parifli is extremely boggy and wet. The 
wafte lands and undivided common in both parifties, are 
of far greater extent than the arable land ; and, were fufE- 
cient encouragement given, or the people able, might be 
improved. Sea- weed or ware is the moft common ma- 
nure, and where it is fcarce, a compoft formed of ware and 
earth. The plough with one ftilt, was;the only plough ge- 
nerally ufed till within thefe few years, when it has given 
way to a wretched imitation of the Scots plough. Horfes 
only are employed by farmers in the plough, and thofe 
of the fmall Strathnaver and Shetland breed. Oxen are 
little ufed, except in carts. Till within thefe feven years, 
there were no carts in thefe parifties but what belonged to 

the '

the minifter, one'heritor, and two farmers. Now there afe 
about 40 in St Andrews alone. Mod of them are drawn 
by an ox, yoked in the fame way as a horfe. Harrows of 
two or three bulls, with wooden teeth, were formerly ufed 
but are now juftly exploded in moft farms, and thofe of two 1 
or three bulls, with fliort iron teeth, are ufed in their ftead. 
Even thefe feem too light, and the people much neglecl the 
brakeing their ground. The harrows are drawn fide-ways l 
by a train or fide rope, (like that ufed in a plough), fallen- . 
ed at each end ; which method of harrowing does great in- - 
juftice to the land. Rotation of crops is here unknown. A 1 
few potatoes, with oats and bear fown alternately, have, for : 
many years, occupied the fame fpot of ground. Rye-grals i 
and clover, have been tried with fuccefs, by the minifter and I 
one heritor. They have alfo tried peafe ; but, owing to I 
the frequent rains in the end of fummer, and the beginning 1 
of harveft, have fcarce got one good crop in feven. Turnips • 
thrive tolerably well in thefe parifhes, but are feldom ufed. 

Hill and Common. — The hill and common round thefe pa- 
rifhes, is black and heathy, affording fhelter for numbers of I 
moor-fowl, and fuch other birds as delight in this fort of 
foil. No wood, of any kind, can be made to grow here, or 
in any part of Orkney, where it has been tried ; and even 1 
the moll common fhrub cannot be raifed without the great- 
eft difficulty, though it is obfervable in many places, even 1 
under the fiat fea-beech, where the ftorms or other accidents I 
walh off the gravel or fand, that black peat-mofs, ftuck 
through with trees, feems to have been the original foil. 
Sometimes a whole tree has been found, and the fmalleft 
fibre fo ftrong as to bear lifting. And in a peat-mofs in 
Beernefs, at the depth of four feet, roots of trees and hazel- 
puts have been dug up, the nuts quite entire. This would 

feem,

feem to indicate, that the country was not formerly as it is 
now. 

Mines. — Small bits' of lead are fometimes found in the 
parifh of St Andrews ; but there is little appearance of a 
mine, neither have the proprietors hitherto made any trial 
3r fearch for one. A fmall holm, belonging to the parifh, 
3on lifts of a rock of fo black a colour, that coals were ex- 
pected near it. But though black ftones, with a mining 
;namel, are here found, they have little of the nature of 
:oal. For though they burn with a pretty clear flame while 
:he enamel lafts, yet, when that is confumed, there remains 
only a heavy lump of ftone. 

Antiquities, ifc. — There were formerly feveral genfle- 
nens feats in the parifh, but they are all now in ruins. One 
f them, which belonged to the Coventries of Newark, was 
milt by John Lord Kinclaven, Earl of Carrick. Another 
it Sandfide, the feat of the Buchanans, has, on a chimney- 
nece, this remarkable infcription, " Who can dwell with 
' everlafting burnings." On the top of the Mull or Burgh 
Df Deernefs, there is a fmall chapel, to which fuperftition 
las made even old age fcramble, through a path in many 
)laces fcarce fix inches broad, and where a lingle falfe ftep 
ed to certain death. The Corn-holm or Kirk-holm of 
Hopejnfhay, (an ifland about half a mile long, and which is 
oined to Copenfhay by a reef that is dry at half-tide), 
hath in it the ruins of a fimilar chapel, clofe by which is a 
leep well, built in the infide with large ftones, and having 
1 ftair to reach the water when low. At fome little di- 
ftance, are the obfcure foundations of fmall buildings, poffi- 
ily the cells of ecclefiaftics. In the fouthernmoft head of 
the holm, are feveral ruins of circular buildings ; and near 
the ruins a quarry of grey flate, of little ufe in building, 

but

but curious on account of the many beautiful figures of fea- 
weeds found between the plates. Thefe figures feem as if 
elegantly painted in a brafs colour, and many of them fo 
clear as torepiefent the fined fibre. Piftilh houXes and tumuli 
lie fcattercd over the whole face of the country. Near the 
end of the neck, of land which joins St Andrews to Deer- 
nefs, are the remains of a very large one, called by the 
country people Dingy's-how, or Duncan's-height ■ and be- 
tween it and Deernefs feveral hillocks of ftones, feemingly 
ruins of buildings. The only other ruin that attracts notice, 
is placed on a fmall neck of land jutting out into a frefh- 
water lake behind the minifter's houfe. Its form is now 
femicircular. The wall is nine feet thick, in which, there 
feem to have been no apartments, or if there have, they | 
are now filled with rubbilh. Some pieces of wall have beea I 
found on the outfide, but their ufe or form cannot be afcer- 
taincd. Bones and {hells of various kinds of animals, with 
peat-aflies, have been found in different apartments on the 
ouilide of the great wail. The minifter, who confiders mo- 
dern inclofures, as more ornamental and ufeful in a coun- 
try, than ancient ruins, has taken a great number of the 
ftones of this building for inclofing his glebe. 

Harbours. — Inganefs ;nd Deer Sound are excellent road* 
fteads, and bplong to this parifh. Inganefs Bay is bounded 
on the weft and fouth, by St Olay ; and by Deernefs on 
tl: eaft and fomh-eaft. The mouth of this bay, which is 
to I he north, is guarded by Shapinftiay ; and as it is quite 
free from ftmals, and the ground clean, being a mixture of 
ftrong clay and fand, it is a place of great fafety. Its ex- 
treme length -is two one-half miles ; its breadth one mile ; 
.and the depth from twelve to two one-half fathoms. The 
belt anchoring ground is about a mile from its fummit, m 
fix or fix one-half fathoms, and neareft to the wett fide of 

the 



of St Andrews and Deernefs. 



! the bay. Deer Sound lies nearly north-eaft and fouth-weft; 
ijit is about five miles long from the Mull-head; where it be- 
:gins to open ; and from one to two and a half miles broad. 
Being much land-locked, and good clean fandy ground mix- 
ed with elay, the greateft fleets can lie fafely in it. The pro- 
iper anchoring ground is three miles and a half within the 
nMull-head, three-fourths of a mile within the point of Nefs, 
jand about one-half mile from each fhore, in about four fa- 
tithoms water. It is not much frequented, exce'pt by a few 
ifhips bound for Davis's Straits, and thofe that go to Ice- 
land. They engage fome of their men here. Some years 
aago, the Iceknd fifhing floops amounted to about 20 or 30, 
cmoflly from England. They hired many of their fifhing 
jhands here, and on their return, bought from "the people 
ifrefh provifions, feathers, (lockings, gloves, linen, and white 
llworfled fluffs, &amp;c. This fifhing gradually declined till about 
ijthree years ago, when only four vcffels came ; and three of 
ithefe were taken by the French, and the failors carried pri- 
foners to France, from whence many of them never return- 
ed. The year after, no Britifh fifhermen ventured there ; 
and for thefe laft two years, there has gone only one veffel. 

Fijh and Fowl. — Deernefs is conveniently fituated for 
(fifh. The country people go out in boats, and catch coal- 

fifh in numbers ; they get fome cod, fkate, haddocks, 
ihallibut, dog-fifh, and a very few ling. The people of St 

Andrews get fkate in Stronfay Frith ; and in Deer Sound, 
•coal-fifh, vaft numbers of fmall cockles, and fome oyfters. 

On the fand and fhores of Deernefs are feen miriacls of plo- 
ivers, curlews, fea-larks, fea-pies, and a large grey bird with 

a hoarfe cry, called by the inhabitants Horra- Goofe. Thefe 
j appear only in fpring, in flocks of about 20c, but do not 

continue long ; and the lofty rocks of Copinfhay are eover- 

«d with wild-fowl of various kinds, without name, and 

without

without number. The taifte, or black guillemote, builds 
her neft in the cliffs ; the kittewakes are by themfelves, in 
the eaft end of the rock, the whole furface of which they 
render white, as that of the other end is mottled black and 
white, by the auks, the fcouts, the cormorants, the (hags, 
the gulls, &amp;c. &amp;c. which crowd upon every flielf. The 
people of this ifland get vaft quantities of fea-fowls, eggs, 
and feathers ; which laft they fell for 9 d. per lib. The me- 
thod of getting them is this : A boy, having a rope tied 
round his waift, is turned over the brink of the rock, quite 
out of fight of thofe who fupport him, by holding in their 
hands the end of the rope. The boy, as foon as he comes 
where the birds or eggs are, fecures them and, when load- 
ed, informs thofe above, by figns which they mutually un-^ 
derftand, how to direct the rope, when to lower, and when 
to pull up. He has a ftaff to defend him from the rugged - 
points and (helves. A human being, fufpended from the 
top of a cliff 50 fathoms high, is, to a ftranger, a dreadful 
fi^ht ; but the rockmen, as they are properly and fignificant-. 1 
ly called, walk on the very edges of the fhelves, in the very? 
face of the rock, with the greateft unconcern. 

Horfes, Cattle, i$c — There are few horfes bred in thefe 
parilhes, or in any part of Orkney, moft of them being 
brought from Caithnefs and Strathnaver, when a year old, 
and are then called Jlaigs. A ftaig cofts from five to twelve 
guineas, and after being employed in the farm, and kept at 
a confiderable expence for four or five years, is fold again 
to Caithnefs, at nearly the fame price he was bought at. The 
number of horfes in both parilhes may be from 650 to 670. 
The black-cattle are of a fmall and very unhandfome breed, 
and are all reared in the parifh. There may be of them 
from 900 to iooo. Sheep run wild on the moors and com- 
mons; they arc fmall, and much negle&amp;ed, and the number

1 ef them difficult to be afcertained. Moft families in the pa- 
I rifti rear fwine, which are generally of a black or reddifh co«- 
l| lour, *nd of a very diminutive fize. They do great mif- 
I chief to the fields with their fnouts. Their number is not 
I below 500. 

Population. — The return to Dr Webfter, in 1755, from 
I St; Andrews and Deernefs, was 1650 fouls. At prefent, 
9 there are in St Andrews 133 families, confifting of 675 per- 
I fons ; and in Deernefs, (including Copinmay, an ifland of a 
I mile long, inhabited by two families), there are 131 fami- 
lies, and 660 fouls. The baptifms in St Andrews alone, 
I for one year, are 30. Marriages 5 . There are no regifters 
I of the burials ke^pt in either parilh ; but, one year with ano- 
l-ther, there were about 8 burials yearly in St Andrews fince 
I the prefent incumbent was fettled. 

The population of both parifties, amounting to 1335, is 
I confiderably below the return made to Dr Webfter, and 
I alfo mnch below an enumeration made by Mr Scollay the 
laft incumbent, in 1772, when the inhabitants of Loth pa-' 
rifb.es were 15 15. The only caufe that can be affigned for 
fo great a decreafe, is the continual drain of men to the na- 
vy, to the northern fiftieries, and, above all, to Hudlbn's 
Bay. Before the year 1741, the Hudfon Bay Company's 
Servants were all taken from England, Ireland, or the Shet- 
land ifles. About 1741, or 1743, they began to get a few 
from Orkney, and finding them to be fubmiffive and indu- 
ftrious, they now take moft, or all, of their tradesfolk and 
contracted fervants from this country. Thefe, by the bed 
accounts that can be collected from the moft intelligent of 
the people who have been there, amount to about 1000 in 
all. Some of them are cut off by accidents every year i 
fome of them are rendered ufelefs by licknefs ; and many 
ef them, when their indentures are up, return home. To

fupply their places, about from 100 to 130 perfons go an, 
nually to Hudfon's Bay, from the Mainland and the other 
ifles. 

Servants Wages.— -To the fame caufes, and that many of 
the inhabitants are employed in making kelp during the 
fummer months, may be afcribed the great fcarcity offer- 
vants, both in thefe parifhes and all over the country. A 
man-fervant has from two to four guineas yearly ; and a 
woman-fervant from 12 s. to 20 s.; and herds in proportion. 
AH fervants are maintained in the family. A day-labour- 
er has from 6 d. to 1 s. per day, and when working in kelp, 
from 13 s. to 16 s. a-month, with four flones of meal. A 
woman-fervant, at kelp, has 8 s. per month, and three nones 
of meal. 

Church, Wc. — There are two churches belonging to this, 
charge, at which the minifter officiates alternately. The 
church of St Andrews was rebuilt about 40 years ago, but 
is now in a ruinous and dangerous ftate ; and though the 
prefent incumbent has repeatedly applied to the heritors tp 
get it repaired, and both his prefbytery and fynod have, 
year after year, ftated this grievance to the General Af- 
fembly, nothing has yet been done to leffen the danger, 
St Peter's church, in Deernefs, is now rooflefe. In 1789, 
it was declared by tradesmen, on oath, too fmall, ruinous, 
and irreparable ; a decreet was paffed by the prefbytery for 
a new one ; and this year, the heritors, after a long and un- 
accountable delay, have at laft paid a part of their propor- 
tions for erecting it ; fo that, it is hoped, it will be built and 
ffniihed next year. The church of Deernefs, is, by land, 
eight and a half miles diftant from the manfe, with a bad road. 
The manfe was built about 25 years ago, but fo fuperficial- 
ly executed, as to be fcarce habitable when the prefent in- 
cumbent 



of St Andrews and Dezrnefs. 267 



umbent was fettled. After a litigious and expenlive pro- 
cefs, it was completely repaired about three years ago, and 
is now the belt in the country. The glebe was, at the ad- 
miffion of the prefent incumbent, in value about L. 4 Ster- 
ling yearly. It is now conliderably better, he having, at 
his own expence, inclofed the whole, and fubdivided a part 
with fufficient ftone-dikes, (copped with fail or turf), of 
from three one-half to five feet high. The expence of in- 
clofing has been above 100 guineas. There is alfo a glebe 
in the parifti of Deernefs, which rents at between L. 4 and 
L. 5 Sterling. The ftipend of this charge, by a decreet of 
the Court of Sefiion, in 1729, was fixed at L. 500 Scots in 
money, and 10 meils of oat-meal, communion-elements in- 
cluded. The late Mr Scollay obtained a decreet of aug- 
mentation, for 8 meils 5 fettings of oat-meal, 14 meils of 
malt, and 5 barrels of greafe butter, in the year 1773 ; but 
it has never yet been locailed, nor the arrears paid up; The 
whole, including the allowance for communion-elements, 
does not exceed L. 75 Sterling. Lord Dundas is patron of 
this, and molt of the other charges in Orkney. The Socie- 
ty for Propagating Chrillian Knowledge have a fchool in 
Deernefs, with a falary of L. 15. The fchoolmafter, who 
is a fenfible man, and fuccefsful in teaching, gets no fees 
from his fcholars. He has brought up, in a decent manner, 
a family of 10 children. 

Poor. — The only fund for the relief of the poor, is the 
Sabbath collections, which amount to about 30 s. yearly. 
No quarterly afleflments are laid on in this parifh, or in 
any part Of the country. ^ The number of poor on the lift 
is 25. 

Rent of the Parifh. — The valued rent of the united pa- 
rishes, according to the original valuation, tatreh in 1653, is 

L-493I, 



Stattjlical Account 



L. 4931 : 15 : Oy Scots. And the real rent, as appears from 
a rental given in to the Court of Seffion in the year 1772, is 
barrels 50 lifpunds and j\ merks of butter, 938 meils 3 
fettings and 19 merks of malt, 35 meils 3 fettings and 18 
merks of oat-meal, and L. 1312 : 6 : ic£ Scots in money. 
The whole, at a moderate converfion, amounting to L. 5826, 
6 s. n-f d, Scots, or L. 485 : 10 : 7 Sterling. The yearly 
value of the great and fuiall teinds may be about L. 100 
Sterling, out of which the mimlrer's Itipend is paid. The 
lands in thefe parilhes pay a very high fuperior duty ; fo 
that, were it not for the confidcrable quantity of kelp ma. 
nuf tdtured on the mores, many of the eftates would be fcarce : 
worth holding. 

Price of Provifions.—- When Brand wrote his defcriptioa 
of Orkney, about the beginning of this century, a cow was 
fold for L. 4 or L. 5 Scots ; a fheep, for 14 s. Scots; a calf, 
for 5 s. Scots ; and a lamb at the fame price. Butter was 
then 2 d. Sterling the merk, (4. lib. Dutch, equal 3 merks), 
and a horfe, L. 12 Scots. About 10 years ago, a good cow 
was fold for 30 s. Sterling ; a fheep, for 2 s. 6 d. ; a lamb, 
for is. 2d,; a calf, for 1 s. Butter,, 4 d. per lib. ; and a 
horfe, for L. 4 or L. 5 Sterling ; a goofe, for 8 d. 5 a hen, for 
3 d. ; and eggs, at 2 d. per dozen. Now, cows are fold at 
from L. 3 to L. 4 Sterling; fheep, for 6 s. ; lambs, or calves, 
for 2 s. 6 d. each. Butter, 7 d. per lib. ; an ox, L, 5, 10 s.;. 
a horfe, L. 12 ; a goofe, 1 s. 6 d. ; a hen, 6 d. ; and eggs, 3 di 
per dozen. Beef, alio, which within thefe fix years fold fof 
i-L d. is now 3^ d. or 4 d. per lib ; and all other things in 
proportion. 

Bars to Improvement. — The principal bars to improve- 
ment, in this parifh, and throughout die country, feem to' 

be the fhortnefs of the kales, moft of them being only for 

three 



of St Andrews and Deernefs.

three years, and many from year to year ; the want of a 
ready market for their grain ; the poverty of the people, 
molt of whom, on taking a farm, are not able to ftock it 
without borrowing money ; their keeping more cattle on 
their farms than they can well maintain ; and, beyond air, 
the fhortnefs and uncertainty of the feafons, and the want 
of inclofures and winter herding, owing to which, all the 
cattle, horfes, fheep, fwine, geefe; &amp;c. go at large for about 
nine months in the year. As foon as any one tenant cuts 
and brings in his corn, the whole country becomes at once 
a common, and all his neighbours muft follow his example, 
or leave thek crops, ripe and unripe, to be trodden dowa 
and defiroyed. In the parilh of Deernefs, many of the te- 
nants go to fea, and neglecf their farms entirely. 

Proprietors and People. — There are five gentlemen pro- 
prietors in St Andrews, and five in Deernefs, none of whom 
refide in the parifh, which is manifeftly againft the im- 
provement of the land, and general advantage and comfort 
©f the people. Befides thefe, there are fix udelars in Deer- 
nefs, perfons whofe property, in fome parts of Orkney, is 
fo fmall, as, if let to a tenant, would Icarcely draw above a 
tub of bear, that is, about a firlot, of yearly rent. The in- 
habitants of buth parifhes, who are in general treated with 
great humanity by their landlords, are fober, regular, indu- 
bious, and being remarkably averfe to drinking fpiritous 
liquors, they are healthy, and live to the ordinary age of 
man. There are no inftances of- extraordinary longevity in 
either of the pan{hes»

.at is regular, being very little interfered by other parifhes. 
3t lies about 8 miles north of Coldftream 4 fouth-weft 
Jof Dunfe; 10 north-eaft of Kelfo; and about 15 from the 
ifea-ports of Berwick and Eyemouth. 

Rivers. — The river Blackadder, which runs through this 
jparifli, takes its rife out of fome mofly grounds in the pa- 
irifh of Longformacus, (hence its proper name Blackwater, 
[vulgarly pronounced Blackadder, or Blackatter). Soon af- 
jter its rife, it is joined by a fmall rivulet from the parifli of 
JWeftruther, about fix miles north-weft of Fogo. It enters 
ihe parifli on the weft end, and, running eaft, divides it 
pearly into two parts ; from thence continuing its courfe 
Itbout fix miles, falls into the Whitadder, which difcharges 
Eitfelf into the Tweed three miles above the town of Ber- 
wick. It abounds with a particular fpecies of trout, much 
larger than the common burn trout, of an excellent flavour, 
and remarkably fat. 

One peculiarity is obferved of the Blackadder, that no 
falmon can live in it ; and if any happen to enter, which 
they feldom do, even in the fpawning feafon, they are al- 
ways found dead, a little way up from the mouth of the ri- 
,ver, although the Whitadder, from whence they come into 
it, abounds with them from the Tweed, and carries them 
jmany miles above the place where it meets with the Black- 
adder. Every other ftream in this country, communicating 
with the Tweed, has the falmon in great plenty during the 
feafon. The above-mentioned fource, (the mofly grounds 
iof Longformacus), is commonly afcribed as the reafon why 

ithat fifli cannot freque t the river.

Soil.'*- .This is of two kinds ; the firft, a deep rich loatn, 
comprehending all the lands near the river, and for a confi. 
derable trad of the parilh ; the other, a light or moorifti 
loam, upon a tilly bed ; this laft is naturally wet, but pro- 
duces good corn and grafs in ordinary feafons. The whole 
parilh, is arable, excepting a few acres on fome of the banks 
of Blackadder, and fome marlhy or fwampy grounds. But 
thofe places that will not admit the operations of the plough, 
are not unproductive of good pafkire. The foil, rn general, 
feems equally adapted for grit or tillage. A. great pan of I 
the parilh is inclofed, although a coniiderable quantity it ill 
lies open. Since the year 1780, above 150 acres of land, 
nearly wafte, or approaching to it, have been brought into 1 
cultivation. About 1200 acres yet remain wafte and unin- 
clofed. Some of thefe are allowed thus to remain, chiefly 
on account of their bad quality,, as being fuppofed incapable 
of repaying any expence that might be laid out on their 
improvement ; but others are left in a ftate of nature, owing | 
more to the negligence of the poffeflbrs than to any other 
caufe. 

Produce. — The produce of this parifti is very valuable. 
The principal crops are oats and barley •, fome wheat and 
peafe, and a coniiderable quantity of clover and rye-grafc 
are fown, and fucceed well. Large quantities of potatoes 
are raifed, and conftitute no fmall part of the food of the in- 
habitants. Turnips are a valuable crop here, as they an- 
fwer the foil, and are extremely ferviceable in feeding cattle 
during winter : they are likewife much ufed for the keep- 
ing (lock. The courfe of cropping on a loam, incumbent 
on a retentive fub-foil, is ufually the following : I. Oats or 
barley. 2. Fallow. 3. Wheat. 4. Grafs-feeds. 5. Paf- 
.tore, commonly four years. The rotation on the moor-foil, 

or 



ofFogo. 



jor gravel is generally turnip, barley, or oats ; grafsfrom one 
jto three years ; oats. 

A confiderable number of horfes are bred in the parifli, 
J both for private ufe and fale. The black-cattle are of a 
jlarge kind, and many are raifed as well for the market as 
jfor private ufe. The number of fheep now bred in the pa- 
ijrifh is confiderable. Some of them are of the large Englifli 
jkind, but in general they are of a middling fize ; they produce 
la great quantity of wool, and of a good quality. It is a cuf- 
jtom to buy in a number of ewes about the month of Odlo- 
jber, from Northumberland, and fome from the weftern parts 
[of the county and Teviotdale, in the fpring, about March. 
IThefe, leaving the wool and lamb in fummer, are fed and 
Hold off towards the autumn. Upon the whole, the produce 
ds many times greater than what is neceflary for the con- 
sumption of the inhabitants. The larger! of the black- 
Icattle fed in the pariih, and the heavieft of the flieep, are 
lent into England; the fmaller and lighter kinds are fold in 
the markets at home. Moft of the corn is difpofed of in the 
| neighbouring markets, and what remains for fale is fent to 
•Berwick and Eyemouth. 

State of Property — The heritors of the pariih, polTefiing 
^properties above 20 acres, are Mortonhall, Harcarfe, March-- 
Ijmont, and Caldra : none of whom are refident except the 
.jlaft. The quantity of land occupied by thefe heritors can- 
pot be exactly afcertained, as a great part of it has never 
jbeen meafured ; but, from the belt calculation that can at 
ttorefent be formed, it appears to be 4127 acres; of which, 
(about 57 acres are under planting. — Number of tenants oc-' 
taupying above 20 acres is 15, of whom three are non-refi- 
fient ; but their farms are fuperintended by grieves or over- 
ifeers.

Rents. — The proven rental of the parifh, in the late prow 
cefs of augmentation, was L. 2180. 

Confiderable improvements have of late been made on 
the property in the parifh, as inclofing, liming, draining, 
&amp;c. One of the heritors, and one or two of the principal 
farmers, have made not a few improvements, but by far 
the greateft part of them have been done by the tenants at 
large. 

Roads. — In general, the parochial roads are not in the 
beft repair ; there are at leaftfix miles of them quite in dif- 
repair, and probably muft continue in that ftate, as the 
funds at prefent are not fufficient to keep in repair the 
roads that have already been made. 

Population* — The population of this parifh has of late 
been greatly diminifhed. The veftiges of old houfes are to 
be feen in every part of it. Several villages almoft to- 
tally demolifhed, occafioned by the monopoly of farms, now 
fo cuftomary in this country. There are inftances in this, 
and the neighbouring parilhes, of one perfon poffefling 
three, four, or fix, very confiderable farms, every one of 
which was formerly confidered as fufficiently large for one 
perfon to occupy. The population, in 1755, according to 
Dr Webfter's account, was 566 fouls. It may be now Ha- 
ted at 450. 

All the inhabitants are farmers and cottagers, with a few 
tradefmen, employed for the purpofes of hufbandry ; as three 
fmiths, and two joiners or wrights, with 45 labourers* 
There are no- manufactures in the parifh. But it is fupplied 
with three corn-mills. Thrafhing-machines are beginning 
to make their appearance, being introduced by one or two 
of the farmers. Since the year 1780, there have been re- 
built

built three farm or manfion-houfes, and three farm-fxead- 
ings, with manlion and cow-houfes. 

Church.— The walls and roof of the church were repair- 
i ed in 1775. The minifters of this parilh were, Meffrs Meth- 
tt ven, Methven, Pringle, Moodie, Home, and Home ; which 
I laft was, in 1785, fucceeded by Mr John Todd the prefent 
&amp; incumbent. The manfe and offices were rebuilt in 1787. 
I All the inhabitants are of the Eftablifhed church, except a 
Wfew DilTenters, molxly of the Relief ; and thefe attend the 
I parifh church occasionally. 

School. — The fchool-houfe is in good repair. The fchool- 
mafter's falary is L. 7 : 1 : I Sterling. 

Poor. — There are only four perfons at prefent on the 
poor roll ; fome others, from accidental circumftances, often 
receive a temporary fupply. The heritors and kirk-feffion 
generally meet three times in the year to make provilion 
for the poor for the enfuing four months, when they ad- 
mit on the roll, or increafe the allowance of thofe whofe 
neceffities may feem to require it. The number of paupers, 
upon a ten years average, preceding the year 1784, is five: 
and upon a ten years average, preceding 1794, is feven. 
The funds for the maintenance of the poor arife from the 
i weekly collections in the church, the intereft of fome mor- 
: tified monies belonging to the poor of the parifh ; and, for 
what more is neceflary, the heritors have recourfe to the 
1 legal method, and affefs themfelves according to the pro- 
portion of their valued rent. The yearly affeflments, upon 
the average of ten years, preceding 1784, were L. 11, 17 s. 
i| d. Sterling : and the average of ten years, preceding 
J794, were L. 23, 2 s. Sterling.

Statiflical Account 

All the teinds in the parifh are valued, from whence 
are paid the ftipend, which was lately augmented, the fchool 
falary, and the fums neceffary for repairing the church, 
manfe, offices, and fchool-houfe. The flipend is now fixed 
at L. 100 per annum ; the old ftipend was L. 77, 10 s. ; con- 
fequently there has been an augmentation of L. 22, 10 s. 

Antiquities. — The only mark of antiquity found in this 
parifh is at a village called Chefters, which has all the ap- 
pearance of an old Roman encampment \ but now very 
much defaced. 

There is an ancient bridge over the Blackadder, at Fa--, 
go, of great advantage to the neighbourhood, as in the win- 
ter feafon the water frequently cannot be forded. This 
bridge is kept in repair by the county, and is the only one 
in the parilh. 

Difadvantages.-— -This place and neighbourhood labour 
under the difadvantage of being at a diftance from coal, the 
only fuel ufed in the parifh. It is brought from North- 
umberland, at the diftance of about 12 miles. Lime is very 
fcarce and dear. To thefe circumftances, unfavourable for 
agriculture, and the comfort of the people, may be added 
the thirlage to mills.

NUMBER XIV. 

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2435784">TINGWALL</name>, 

(County of Orkney and Shetland, Synod of Ork- 
ney, and Presbytery of Shetland.) 



Drawn upfront the Communications of the late Rev. Mr 
William Mitchell, Minijter of the Parifh*.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, and Extent. 

r "T , HIS parifli is known by the name of Tingwall, but 
comprehends in it the united parifhes of Tingwall, 
Whitenefs, and Weifdale. All thefe names are evidently 
of Norwegian or Danifli extraction, languages at prefent 
unknown in thefe iflands. It is therefore impoffible for any 
native or inhabitant of Shetland to give any accurate expla- 
nation of them. It is probable, however, that Whitenefs 

means 

* Some parts of Mr Mitchell's communications were unfortunately loft 
in their way from Shetland, and by his death, the deficient information could 
pot be replaced.

means the White Promontory. It is Angular, indeed, that 
in almoft all languages, the words nefs, nofs, nofe, have al. 
moft the fame meaning. Thefe united parilhes are fituated 
in the Mainland of Shetland, and not far from Lerwick the 
capital. The parifh is about ten miles in length, and in 
fome places five in breadth, befides fome detached iflands, 
inhabited by fifhcrmen. Some of thefe iflands are four 
miles diftant from the main parifti, from which they are fe- 
patated by a dangerous fea, 

Pofiulatiou.—^By the return to Dr Webfter, in 1755, the 
population of the united parifhes amounted to 1412, of alt 
ages. At prefent there are 352 families, and the number 
of inhabitants ik 1786; of which 1431 are examinable per- 
fons. The population has therefore increafed to the amount 
of 374 fouls. 

Churches. — There are two places of public worlhip, at 
the diflance of three miles from each other, which are regu- 
larly attended by the minifter, and by the people in their 
refpe£tive neighbourhoods. It cannot be expecled, that in 
fo remote a diftricl, two churches in one parifii could be re- 
markable for their conftruclion. 

Manfv.— The manfe is fituated on the mod frequented 
road in Shetland, being a thorough-fare between the town 
of Lerwick and ail the weftern parts of Shetland, and the 
town of Scalloway and all the northern parts. It is the 
only manfe or gentleman's houfe in the country that is not 
ikuated near the fea, and, conlequently, it wants aH the ad- 
vantages of fifh and filhing-boats, of fuch effential confe- 
rence in fo northern a fituation. This, with the fcarcity 
of foeep-pafture in the neighbourhood, k a great lofs and 
inconvenience to the minifter. 

Stipend* 



of Tingwall. 



279 



|| Stipend.*— This remote parifh is celebrated in the Eccle- 
ilaftical Annals of Scotland, for its procefs of augmentation, 
An the decifion of which, in a great meafure, depended the 
income of the minifters of Scotland. The queftion was ve- 
By brifkly litigated before the Court of Seffion, and was af- 
terwards appealed to the Houfe of Lords, by whom it was 
Bedded favourably to the willies of the clergy ; in confe- 
luepce of which, the ftipend was finally modified at L. 578* 
■6 s. Scotch of money, and 108 lifponds of butter, with 
L. 40 Scotch for communion-elemertts. Each lifpond of 
lutter is computed at 30 lb. confequently, in all, there arc 
J240 lib. of butter payable to the minifter. The ufual 
[ponverfion is at the rate of L. 4, 16 s. Scots per lifpond. 

State of Property. — The beft account of the ftate of pro* 
jjberty in this diftrift, is to be found in the following proven 
rental, as afcertained in 1 791, in the courfe of the procefs 
)f augmentation.

.Inns. — There is no public-houfe in tlic whole parifli 
where any perfon of diftinition can have either entertain- 
ment or lodging. Bnt the want is abundantly made up by 
the hofpitality of the inhabitants. 

Inoculation. — The late incumbent, Mr William Mitchell 
finding that the common people declined to inoculate their 
children, in confequence of the expence attending it when a 
regular furgeon was employed, refolved to undertake it him- 
felf, without charging them any thing, and carried it on with 
greatfuccefs, having inoculated no lefs a number than 950, be- 
tween the years 1774 and 1793. As it requires no great 
Hull or dexterity, it is extremely defirable that his brethren, 
in other remote parts of the country, would imitate fo laud- 
able an example. Young ftudents of divinity might eafily 
acquire this branch of the medical art, when attending the 
different univerfities ; and midwives, when taught the prin- 
ciples of their profeffion, might alfo eafily be taught how to 
inoculate. 

Commerce. — It is impoflible to give the value of the ar» 
tides exported from, or imported into, this diftrict ; and in- 
deed all the parilb.es in Shetland are fo interwoven with 
each other, that the particular export and import of any 
one parifh feparately, could not be given, or even guefied 
at, with any tolerable accuracy. 

Shipwrecks. — It is well known that numbers of veiTela 
are loft on the mores of the Orkney and Shetland iflands, 
und many upon the coafts of this parifh, in a great meafure 
owing to the want of proper charts and directions. The 
late Mr Mitchell had formed a defign of giving to the pub- 
lic an account of the latitude and longitude of all the head- 
lands, and marks to know them j together with directions 



of Tingvball. 



for failing into all the principal harbours in the ifland. The 
following paper was drawn up as a fpecimen of that work, 
lit would have been an ufeful publication to mariners, but 
lit is believed that the author unfortunately died before he 
jhad completed ic. 

Wireclions for Sailing into the Harbour of Scalloway in Shet- 
land, which lies in 60 0 9/ North Latitude, and 31' of 'a 
Degree Weji Longitude. 

Mariners, failing from the fouthward, pafs Fair Ifle, 
which lies in the middle of the paffage between the Ork- 
ney and Shetland iflands, in north latitude 59° 24', weft 
longitude 41' of a degree; then they come up to Fitful- 
Head, the higheft land on the fouth end of the Main ifland 
of Shetland, lying in 59 0 48' north latitude, 37' weft longi- 
tude, which they keep on the flarboard fide, and fail along 
the coaft, about 11 miles, when they arrive at a little inha- 
bited ifle called Havra. Here they have choice of twd 
entries, called the South and the Weft entries to this har- 
"bour. In purfuing the fouth entry, they put the ifle of 
Havra on the larboard fide, and the high hills called Clifc 
Hills on the flarboard fide ; then fail through the middle of 
Clift Sound; fleering on the Kirk of Tingwall. If the wea- 
ther is clear, they will fee Fair Ifle a-ftern. When they 
come to the north-eaft corner of the ifle of Trondra, where 
they turn round wefterly into this harbour, they keep near 
the eafl fide, where the water is deepeft, though only three 
fathoms -, but the fhip gets no hurt though fhe mould touch 
the ground. When they have the weft entry open, then 
they fleer to the weft fide of the harbour, under the hill of 
Weftfliore, where they drop anchor, in five fathom water, 
and the beft ground. 

To fail into the harbour by the weft entry, they put the 
fore-mentioned ifle of Havra on the flarboard fide, and pafs

little inhabited ifle called Oxna *, where they get fight of 
the cattle of Scalloway, about four miles from the harbour, 
and fleer on it through the middle of the entry, keeping the 
ifles of Oxna and Papa, the Green Holm, a fmall uninha- 
bited ifle, with green grafs on the top, and the hill of Weft, 
more, all on the larboard fide •, and the ifles of Burra and' 
Trondra on the (larboard fide, till they fee all the houfes of 
Scalloway near the lhape of a half-moon ; and then turn

NUMBER XV. 

PARISH OF <name ref="NA">ARBNAMURCHAN</name>, I 

(Counties of Argyle and Inverness, Synod of Ar* 
gyle, and presbytery of mull.) 



By the Rev. Mr Alexander Campbell, Minijler.</head> 



<p>Origin of the Name, \£c. 

AIRD-NA-MOR-CHUAN, a headland well known to 
mariners, gives name to a large peninfula, and thence 
to the parifh. It fignifies, in the Gaelic language, Point* 

of 

* Scarce any local defcriptive name occurs fo frequently in Scotland, par- 
ticularly on the fea-coafts, as Aird, commonly wrote, and confounded with, 
Ard, high, a height. Applied to land, Aird fignifies a point or angle, both 
fides of which are bounded by water. A thoufand inftances might be fpe- 
cified, as Aird-nan-faor, on which Fort George Hands, &amp;c. In this parifli, 
Aird-nifh is a peninfula, three miles long ; and there are many letter points, 

called Aird, one of which is fo low, as to be overflowed by high tides. —

ters, &amp;.c.) 



of Ardnamurchan.

ijof the Great Seas, appofitely to its prominent fituation amid 
frhe larger Hebrides, which, with the peninfula, apparently 
iWivide the ocean into feveral feas. From a record in the 
liTeind-Office, it appears, that in the year 1630, this peninfula 
fiwas a feparate parifh, called Kilchoan, after the church of that 
(;name dedicated to St Coan ; and the remaining diftrids of 
'the prefent parifh of Ardnamurchan formed a fecond pa- 
.irifh, under the name of IllandFinan, a beautiful little ifland 
in Loch Sheil, then the refidence of the minifter, and fite 
lof the principal church, dedicated to St Finan ; but in more 
Hancient times, probably, the two moll northern diftri£ts were 
la third parifh, named Kilmaria, after the church, the walls 
iof which remain at Keppoch in Arafaig, dedicated to the 
■Virgin Mary ; and it will appoar, that each of the three 
Iwas of large extent. 

Situation and Extent. — The ~Ru, i. e. the extremity of the 
peninfula above mentioned, which is the fouth-weft corner 
of the parifh, is remarkable as the molt weftern point 
of the mainland of Great Britain, and the moft noted head- 
land from Cape Wrath to the Moil of Kintyre, between 
which it is centrically fituated *. The parifh is, on the 

fouth, 

* It is to be regretted, our beft maps and charts are fo inaccurate in re- 
fpedt to this remarkable headland, and ftill more fo, as to the coaft to the north 
thereof, at leaft in this parifh. Though fome attention has been paid to our 
own fliore.% in the prefent reign chiefly, it has edit the public infinitely more 
to explore the Antipodes. The true place and figure of net one, perhaps, of 
the Hebrides, is fo well afcertained and known as thofe of O-why-hee or 0- 
ta-heite. The beft delineation that has been publiflied, of any part of this or 
of the neighbouring parifties, is Bruce's map of the Parifh and Barony of Ard- 
namorchan, in 1733, publiftied by Sir A. Murray, that has been copied by 
Dorret. , It lays down the Point of Ardnamurchan in latitude 56° 58' north, 
and longitude 6" 13' weft. (Sea charts in prefent ufe make the longitude 
0° 3-')- A manufcript map of the fame, in the book after- mentioned, makes

fouth, feparatcd from Morvcrn by the Terpentine courle of 
Loch Sunart, and from Mull, by the north end of the found 
of that ifland. It is bounded, on the weft, by the Atlantic, 
which, penetrating deeply, forms on this fide a large bay, 
and five branches, refembling the hand and fingers •, on th e 
north, by Loch Mor'ir, and the river iffuing from it, feparat- 
ing this parifh from the diftricl: of north Mor'ir in Glenelg pa- 
rifh; and, on the eaft, by a range of ten moun tains, over whofe 
numerous fummits the boundary line paffes, by fo many al- 
ternate afcents and defcents, conterminous with the diftriets 
of Ardgower, Lochiel, and Locharkaig, parifh of Kilmalie 
and diflridt of Kingerloch, in that of Lifmore and Appin. 
It is alfo contiguous to Morvern parifh for about two miles, 
near the head of Loch Sunart, on the fouth. Within thefe 
limits are comprehended five feveral diltridts, or countries, 
as they are here called, iji, Ardnamurchan Proper, or pa- 
rifh of Kilchoan, l6 miles in length, and 44- in mean 
breadth : 2d, Sunart, 12 miles by 6 : 3^, Moidart, 18 miles 
by 7 : a,th t Arafaig, 16 miles by 6 : And, $th, South 
Mor'ir, 14 miles by 4. The two firft are in Argylefhire, 
and, joining at Tarbert a narrow pafs of two miles from 

Salen, 

the latitude of Mingary Caftle, which lies fix miles eaft from the point, 56* 
,6'. Vide Sir Alexander Murray of Stanhope's book, in the Advocates Lib- 
vary, Edinburgh, " The Interefts of Great Britain Confidered," &amp;c. in which 
are many intcrefting particulars regarding this country, and the Highlands at 
large, anno 1740. The manufcript map is in all refpedls inferior, except in 
lengthening the country by three miles. A late furvey, not published, varies 
greatly from both. Mackenzie's charts, though in need of amendment, are 
extremely ufeful in pointing out the tradl of coafting navigation ; but it be- 
longs not to fuch draughts to delineate the internal parts ; and even the out- 
line is often, as in this parilh, reprefented with the distortions appearing to tbe 
eye at fea, and according to tbe dangers to be avoided ; it being a rule to Shor- 
ten the distances from one headland to another, left veflels, in the daik, over- 
shoot their reckoning. Hence, with reipect to the land, fome parts" are over- 
extended, and others no lefs abridged. 



of Ardnamurcban.

Salen, a creek of Loch Sunart, to the weft end of Loch 
Sheil, extend, in one range, from eaft to weft; the others, 
in Invernefs-ftiire, lie parallel to each other and to Sunart, 
from which Moidart is feparated by the above lake ; the ri- 
ver Sheil, being the boundary between the north-eaft cor- 
ner of Ardnamurchan, and fouth- weft of Moidart, for about 
three miles, to its fall into the fea at Caftle Tioram. 
Straight lines drawn between the extreme points, would 
form the parilh into a figure of four unequal fides, the fouth 
being the longeft, the north ftiorteft, and the weft exceed- 
ing the eaft fide. From the above calculations, the beft that, 
for want of furveys of half the parifti, could be made, it 
may be reduced to a fquare of fomething more than 20 
Englifli miles of land and water, extending to 273,280 
acres ; of which, it is believed, above 200,000 are land. 

Surface, Soil, l#c. — Of fo large a fpace, a minute defcrip- 
tion will not be expected. It confifts, principally, of moun- 
tains, hills, and high moors, in general more rugged and 
precipitous than of great elevation; the higheft, being only 
of the third or fourth rate among the Highland mountains, 
2. e. probably not exceeding, in any inftance, 1000 yards j 
a height which four or five of them feem to approach. 
There are certainly many, in all the gradations, from 400 
to 900 yards. They are in general pointed at top, though 
none can be called regular cones *.

PARISH OF <name ref="NA">URQUHART</name> AND <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3108762">GLENMO- 

RISTON</name>, 

(County of Inverness, Synod of Glenelg, and 
Presbytery of Abertarf.)</head> 



<p>Boundaries, Extent, \$c. 

THIS parifh is bounded, 011 the north, by the parifties 
of Invernefs, Kirkhill, and Kiltarlity ; on the eaft, by 
Lochnefs, which feparates it from Stratherrick ; oil ;he 
fouth, by the united parifh of Bolefkin and Aberrarf and 
that of Kilmanivaig ; on the fouth- weft, by the parifhes of 
Glenfheal and Kintail, in Rof=-fhire -, and on the weft, and 
north-weft, by the diftrift of Strathglafs, which lies in the 
parifties of Kilmorack and Kiltarlity. 

The parifh is 30 miles in its greateft length •, tlie breadth 
is, in the greater part, from 8 to 12 miles. It contains 
the glens or vallies of Urquhart and Gienmorifton, which run 
nearly parallel, at the diftance of eight miles or thereby 
from each other, in a nearly wefterly direction from Loch- 
Vol. XX. P p nefs.

nefs. They are feparated from each other by a ridge of . 
mountains. 

It is called, in public regiflers, the parifii of Urquhart and 
Glenm'orifton, though no evidence appears of an annexa- 
tion or union, to afcertain whether or not they formerly 
were diftin£t parimes. It is probable, however, that they 
were fo in times of Popery. 

Etymology. — Nothing fatisfadtory can be determined re- , 
fpe&amp;ing the etymology of Urquhart and though the valley, 
in general, be fo ftyled, there is no particular place or farm 
called Urquhart. There are two other parilhes of the fame 
name, the one in Rofs-fiiire, and the other in Moray. In 
Gaelic, the general language of the country, Urquhart isy 
pronounced Urchudinn, w\&amp; this was formerly diftinguilhed by 
the name of UrchudinCill ma Chroffan, as being therefidence 
of Saint Croffan or Crofian ; latterly, it is more frequently 
ftyled Urchudin "Ihiarna Ghrant, or the Laird of Grant's 
Urquhart, by much the larger part of the valley having 
been, for fome ages, the property of the family of Grant. 
But though the etymology of Urquhart be uncertain, it is 
abundantly evident, that the names of all the places are 
pure Gaelic. Cffl r in its original acceptation, denoted a 
cell, or the feqneftered habitation of a religious perfon ; and 
from the circumftance, that the people, from reverence to 
the refidence of a faint, buried the dead near his habitation, 
cill came to fignify, in the common language of the people, 
a church-yard or burial place. There is in the valley of 
Urquhart two burial places ; the one called Cillmore, or the 
Great Burial Place ; it is at the lower end of the valley, 
where the parifn-church Hands : The other place, ft til ufed 
for fepulture, is at the head of the valley, in Corriuiony ; it 

is 



of Urquhart and Glenmorijlon. 299 

is called Claodh Churidan, which expreffes properly the bu- 
rial place of Curidan, There were anciently two other bu- 
rial places or cells, called Cillmbichael and Cillfantninian ; 
both thefe have long been difufed as places of interment. 
Thefe cells and burial places were named from reverential 
regard to the holy perfons or faints by whom they were 
confecrated. 

In the lower end of the valley, on the north fide of the 
Bay of Urquhart, oppofite to the ancient Caftle of Urqu- 
hart, there remains the veftige of a fmall religious houfe, 
which belonged to the order of the Knights of the Temple, 
or of St John of Jerufalem ; the place where it flood is ftill 
called the Temple. The order of Templars was ereded by 
the Pope, anno 1128. The Templars greatly increafed in 
numbers, riches, and power, over Chriftendom ; they were 
fuppreffed by Pope Clement the Fifth, in a council held at 
Vienna, anno 1312, and their lands were bellowed, moftly 
by the refpeclive fovereign powers, upon the Knights of St 
John of Jerufalem. Wherever there was a religions houfe 
erected, as belonging to the Knights Templars, it is to be 
prefumed, there were fome lands annexed to it. But there 
is no evidence remaining refpe&amp;ing any Temple-lands in 
this parifli. 

Heritors, and State of the Property and Rents. — Sir James 
Grant of Grant is the principal heritor in the parifti. The 
family of Grant have never had any place of refidence in 
this part of their property, their chief feat having been, 
lince the time of King Robert Bruce, at Caftle Grant, 
in Strathfpey. The proprietors of Corrimony were the 
only heritors defcended of the Grant family, who refided 
in the valley ,of Urquhart, fince the original grant of the 
lordftiip of Urquhart, from King James the Fourth to the 
family of Grant. 

It

Statijlical Account 



It appears, from the 41ft ac~t of the nth Parliament of 
James the Second, that among many other lands annex- 
ed to the Crown, the lordfhip of Urquhart was then in- 
cluded': " Item, The Houfe of Innernefs and Urquhard, 
" and the lordftiips of them ; and the lordlhips of A.berne- 
" thy, with the water-mails of Innernefs, together with the 
" baronies of Urquhard, Glenurquhane," &amp;,c. 

A general diuolution of the annexed lands to the Crown 
took place in the time of James the Fourth, by an act of 
Parliament, paffed in the 1503, cap. 90. by which it was 
made lawful " to his Hieneffe to fet all his proper lands, 
" both annexed and unannexed, in few ferme, to ony per- 
" ion or perioues, as he pleafis," &amp;c. In confequence of 
thib acl, three charters of the lordfhip and baronies of Urqu- 
hart paiTed in favour of John Grant of Freuchie and of his 
two fons. The barony of St Ninians and Kyle, compre- 
hending the greater part of the lands of Urquhart, and the 
valley of Strathchluani, lying between Glenmorifton and 
Gleniheal, was granted to John Grant of Freuchie, the 
chief of the Clan ; and the barony of Glenmorifton, com- 
prehending fome lands in Urquhart, was granted to his el- 
deft fon and to his younger fon was granted the barony of 
Corrimony, lying in the valley of Urquhart. Thefe char- 
ters all bear the fame date, in December 1509, 

In the weftern end of the valley, the grave of a Danifh 
or Norwegian prince is (hewn, it is called Uai Mhoni, that 
is, the Grave of Moni ; a field, near the margin of which 
the body was laid, is called Dahnhoni, and the circular val- 
ley at the head of the more extended valley of Urquhart, is 
called Coiramhoni, or the Valley of Moni. There is a beau- 
tiful rocky eminence lituated in the bottom, near the lower 
end of the valley, which is called Craigmbom, or the Craig 
or Rock of Moni. According to tradition, Moni here 
founded his horn, collected his followers, and made refin- 
ance 



of Urquhart and Glenmorifton. 



ance againft his enemies ; but he was difcomfited, purfued 
up the valley, and was killed at the head of it, and there 
buried. 

In Argylefhire, a tradition is preferved refpe&amp;ing a Nor-* 
wegian prince of the name of Moni, who came with a cons- 
iderable number of mips, to that part of the weftern coaft 
where the Crinan Canal is now carrying on. His follow- 
ers having difembarked, they penetrated the country, and 
after having poffefTed themfelves of all the plunder they 
could collect, in returning to their mips, they were attack- 
ed by the inhabitants of the country, by whom Moni and 
his followers were routed, and many of them killed, and 
himfelf, with a few of his followers, were preffed fo hard, 
that they could not regain their (hips, but fled northwards, 
towards Lochaber. The track of country through which he 
was purfued, in endeavouring to reach his mips, is precifely 
in the line of the Crinan Canal, and is known at this day 
by the appellation of the pafs of Moni, 

According to the tradition of the people in Urquhart, 
Moni was a Norwegian or Danifti prince, for he is always 
called Moni Mor, mac Ri Lochlinn ; that is, the Great Mo- 
ni, the fon of the King of Lochlin. 

Burying Places. — There are in Glenmorifton two bury- 
ing places, called Clachan an Inair, that is, the burial place 
of the lower part of the valley, where the river Morifton 
difcharges itfelf into Lochnefs ; and Clachan Merecheard, 
which is called after a Saint of the name of MerechanJ.. 
The name of Clachan, given to burial places, is derived 
from the word clack, which fignifies a ftone. Anciently, 
in Druidical times, places of worfhip, and alfo burial pla- 
ces, were rendered remarkable by a great collection of 
flones, fome thrown together in the fhape of cairns, others.

hence burial places continued to be expreffed by the word 
clachan. 

The family of Glenmoriflon, of whom Major John Grant, 
the prefent proprietor, is the reprefentative, have pofiefTed 
this part of the parim of Urquhart from the 1548, and 
was conveyed to John Grant of Culcabock, the anceftor of 
that family, immediately defcended of the family of Grant, 
by Grant of Ballendalloch, to whom it came, by progrefe, 
from the grantee of the Crown, in 1509. 

King James the Fourth gave and granted both the caftle 
and lordfhip of Urquhart, in feu-farm and heritage, for 
ever, to John Grant of Freuchie, the chief of the Grants, 
and anceftor to the prefent Sir James Grant of Grant, Ba- 
ronet, for his own and his predeceffors conftant, loyal, and 
ftedfaft adherence to his Majefty and his Royal Progeni- 
tors, and fince then this fort and lands have remained in 
poffeffion of the family of Grant. For fome time before 
the 1509, the Lairds of Grant were the Crown's Chamber- 
lains over thefe lands, for keeping the peace in thefe parts, 
and had the revenues of thefe lands as their falary, as the 
Governors of the Fort or Caftle of Urquhart had before 
them. 

Rent. — The valued rent of the parifh is L. zz 19, 5 s. 
Scots, and the real rent, including lands and woods, may 
be eftimated at L. 3000 Sterling ; but as one of the pro- 
prietors has the greater part of his eftate in his own poffef- 
fion, and another a considerable farm in his own hands, the 
rental cannot be accurately known ; but the above compu- 
tation may be efteemed pretty juft. Rents have been tri- 
pled within thefe 30 years, and it is comfortable to rcflecl, 
that the fituation of the tenantry is ameliorated at the fame 
time. This is owing to greater induftry in the people, 

the 



ofUrquhart and Glenmori/lon. 303 



Ithe advance of the price of produce, the gradual improve- 
jment of the country, and the fecurity of property. 

As almoft every farm has a proportion of grafs and pa- 
i^fture, it is difficult to fay what may be the average rent of 
fjarable land by itfelf ; but fome acres in the ftrath or low 
npart of Urquhart, fet as high as 20 s. per acre, without any 
■benefit of pafturage. 

Surface and Soil. — The furface of the parilh is extremely 
8 unequal ; in general it is a mountainous country, yet con- 
i lifts of a moft beautiful variety of hill and dale, rock and 
I wood. Both the Glens of Urquhart and Glenmorifton ex- 
fchibit to the traveller an uncommon and pi&amp;urefque view of 
[ what is beautiful, grand, and fublime in nature ; at the fame 
|| time that fome of the mountains prefent great tradls of 
I ftone and mofs, incapable of cultivation or improvement. 
Urquhart is divided into ftrath and braes, and is in gene- 
ral a rich, though not a deep loam, and uncommonly fruit- 
! ful. It produces abundant crops of white and black oats, 
bear, and rye. Wheat has alfo been tried with good fuccefs. 
Green crops, fuch as potatoes, turnips, clover, and rye-grafs, 
peafe, and lint, are alfo raifed to good account where the 
ground is properly prepared. 

The foil of Glenmorifton is very inferior to that of Ur- 
quhart, being commonly light and fandy, yet produces good 
crops of potatoes, black oats, a little white oats, and fome 
bear ; fown grafles alfo fucceed pretty well where the 
ground is properly managed. 

Moimtains. — The moft remarkable mountain in the pa- 
rilh is Meulfuarmhonie, which rifes on the weft fide of Loch- 
nefs, to the height of 3060 feet above the level of the fea. 
It is noted for being the firft land-mark with mariners 

after

after they pafs Kinnaird's Head, the entry to the Moray 
Frith. 7 

Rivers. — The largeft river in the parifh is Moriftoij 
which rifes in Glenlheal, and, paffing through Loch Cluaai 
falls into Lochnefs near the Houfe of Major Grant of Glen- 
morifton, where, a little above its entry into the Loch, it 
forms a grand cafcade. Here there is a falmon -nftring, 
which, in fome feafons, turns to pretty good account ; but 
owing to the rock over which the river fails, the fifh are 
prevented from getting up the country, and of courfe the 
fifhing is much lefs productive. 

Two rivers rife in the hills of Urquhart, the Ennerif. 
and Coiltie, and fall into Lochnefs near each other, % 
little below the church of Kilmore. In fpeats or floods 
fome falmon are found in them ; but the whole rivers, and 
alfo the different burns or rivulets, contain great plenty of 
trout. 

Lakes. — Lochnefs having been defcribed in the Statifti- 
cal Accounts of fome of the neighbouring parifhes, and be- 
ing an objecl: fo well known, it is needlefs to fay any thing 
regarding it here. 

The parifh contains, (as moft Highland countries do), a 
number of inferior frefh-water lakes, which abound with 
fifh, as trout, pike, &amp;c. Regarding one fmall lake, near 
the top of Mealfuarmhonie, a vulgar error has prevailed, 
that it was unfathomable; but its depth has been afcertain- 
ed by the minifter of the parifh and another gentleman, and 
found to be very inconfiderable. 

Loch Meikly, in the middle of the braes of Urquhart, is 
a beautiful fheet of water, about a mile long, and half a 

mile 



of Urqubart and Glenmoriflon, 



3°5 



mile broad. The woods, the finely cultivated fields, and 
the neat gentlemens houfes, which furround this lake, form 
a very pi&amp;urefque and romantic landfcape. 

Cafcades.— -Cafcades or waterfalls, fome of which are ex- 
tremely magnificent, are common in this part of the coun- 
try. The falls of Moral in Corrimony, and of Divach, 
near the lower end of the valley, are ftrikingly awful ; the 
latter wants nothing but a quantity of water, to make it 
rival any in the Highlands ; the burn falling down the rock 
from 90 to ico perpendicular feet. It lies at about a Scots 
mile fouth-weft of the church. 

Woods. — There ai'e conGderable natural woods, both on 
Sir James Grant's eftate in Urquhart, and in Glenmori- 
flon. They confift of Scots fir, birch, alfo a variety of hard 
wood, as oak, aih, elm, &amp;c. belides allar, roan-tree, poplar, 
and feveral other kinds, which have, from time to time, 
fetched the proprietors considerable fums of money ; and 
i being convenient for market, and in a very thriving condi- 
tion, will be ft ill more productive. The feats of the pro- 
prietors and fome of the gentlemen-farmers, are much em- 
j: belliflied by clumps and belts of Scots fir and other trees : 
lAnd in Rnifgich, on Lochnefs-fide, there is, perhaps, as 
i great a variety of trees as in any part of Scotland. 

Produce. — The produce of this parifli is various, confift- 
^ ing of grain, potatoes, lint, hay, timber, black-cattle, fheep, 
I horfes, goats, butter and cheefe, 8cc. 

Urquhart not only raifes grain fufhcient for the confump- 
tion of the inhabitants, but alfo fends a confiderable quanti- 
ty of feed-oats and meal to the neighbouring diftricls. The 
bear is generally diftilled into whifky, but it may be quef- 
1 tioned, whether the profit attending this branch of bufinefs 
Vol. XX. Q^q be 



3°6 Staujikal Account 

be not counterbalanced by a degree of idleuefs and difiipa. 
tion, with which the diftillcry of fpiiits is attended. At 
the fume time, it mufl be acknowledged, that there 15 
as little of this in the parifh as in mod fituations where 
whilky is manuf atturcd. Indeed, it is difficult to fay how 
the bear could be difpofed of to advantage in any other 
way than by diftillation, as the people are unacquainted 
with brewing it into beer, and that too many prefer whilky 
to ale or porter, though this be fortunately wearing out. If 
manufactured into meal, that meal would fcarceiy find fale 
among Highlanders, who never u£e it when oat-meal can 
be found : And, of courfei, bear would give a very inferior 
price to what is given by diftillers. One, and fometimes 
two licences, for frills of from 30 to 40 gallons each, are ta-\ 
ken out for Urquhart, when the quality of the bear is fuffi- 
ciently good for diftillation. 

Glenmorifton does now generally fupply itfelf with grain, 
but exports none; and it is only fince the general cultivation ' 
of potatoes that it could fupport itfelf. In Urquhart there 
are about 80c milch-cows, and double that number of 
yell cattle. In Glenmoriiton, fome more than 500 milch- 
cows, and yell cattle in a larger proportion. From both 
glens, a confiderable quantity of butter and cheefe is fold, 
befides what is confurrted by the inhabitants ; but more 
from Urquhart, in proportion to the number of milch-cows, 
than from Glenmorifton. The black cattle are generally 
of the Highland breed, and good of their kind ; Mr Grant 
of Corrimony's breed is particularly excellent, and inferior 
perhaps to none in the Highlands. Mod of the farmers 
keep fheep ; but there are no regular ffieep farms, except 
Corrimony's, and one in Glenmorifton, both of which turn 
out well. Among the fmaller tenants, the breed of Iheep 
has been much improved, by the purchafe of tups and* 

lambs 



of Urqubdrt and Gknmoriflon. 



H Jambs from the (beep countries to the wefhvari.1. There 
h are fcarcely To many horfes reared in Urquhart as the far- 
I mers require ; from Glenmorifton a good many are fold,

Goats are nearly extirpated from Urquhart, on account 
I of the hurt that animal does to young trees; but, in the 
I heights of GlenmorHton, goats are pretty generally reared. 
I The number of fheep, and goats, and horfes, is not pretend- 
I ed to be calculated. 

Ar.hnuls. — There are no wild animals peculiar to the pa- 

I rifli. The caper coille, or wild turkey, was feen in Glen- 

Imorillon, and in the neighbouring uiliricr. of Strathglafs,

and white hare, ptarmigans, &amp;c. 

Climate. — The climate is, upon the whole, moilt, yet 
wholefome ; the people are healthy, and live to a good old 
age. No epidemical difeafes are peculiar to the country. 
It is to be regretted, that inoculation for the fmallpox is 
not more prevalent, and which is unfortunately owing to re- 
ligious prejudice. 

Occupations, Agriculture, Farms, &amp;c. — The great body 
of the people live by cultivating the ground, either as te- 
nants, mailers, or fervants. There is a fufficiency of arti- 
fans for the accommodations of the country, and moft of 
them have a fmall piece of land, which yields them the 
comforts of a milch-cow. The farms are generally fmall, 
of from L. 5 rent, and even lefs, to L. 20 Sterling, though 
fome are confiderably higher •, and fome gentlemen farmers 
rent from L. 60 to L. ioo Sterling a-year. Leafes are ge-

nerally fliort, but in fotne inftances 19, 30, and even longer 
leafes are granted, with encouragement for inclofing and 
improvement. 

Improvements. — On gentlemens farms feveral handfome 
houfes have been built ? the fields inclofed, fubdivided, and 
limed, an approved rotation of cropping followed, grafe- 
feeds fown, and other improvements made, and their ex- 
ample has been followed with fpirit and fuccefs by fome of 
the common tenants. 

The old Scotch plough is moft generally in ufe, but in all 
well managed farms, the two-horfe, or Small's plough, has 
been introduced. Cart-wheels are now pretty common in 
Urquhart ; but in Glenmorifton, the ftate of the roads does 
not admit of them in general ufe. 

Nothing whatever has been of more advantage to this 
part of the country, than the general culture of pota- 
toes, which fucceed extremely well on every farm, and 
form a very great part of the food of the poorer clafs of 
people ; and, owing to this, fcarcity is hardly known among 
them. 

The proprietors are defirous of promoting improvements, 
both by premiums and example. Sir James Grant gives 
rye-grafs and clover-feeds to the fmaller tenants on his 
eftate gratis, which has greatly encouraged the culture of 
thefe moft ufeful plants. 

It has been already obferved, that lint is raifed with fuc- 
cefs, which is much owing to the liberal encouragement 
Sir James Grant gives to his people for its culture. His te- 
nants and mailers have lint-feed for new ground, and has 
built, at his own expence, a lint-mill for its manufacture. 
By this well-judged liberality, above 100 acres, on Sir 
James Grant's eftate, have been converted from the ftate 
of nature into arable field, within thefe 12 years. Induftry 
has been encouraged among the females, and both fexes

of Urqubart and Glenmorijlon. 



exhibit, on Sundays and holy-days, a much improved ap- 
pearance, from what they were wont to do formerly, by 
being now dreffed in linen of their own growth and manu- 
facture. 

Lime has conduced very much to the improvement of 
Urqubart. There is abundance of limeftcne on Sir James 
Grant's eftate, and to encourage its ufe, he not only gives 
his people quarry-leave free, but is at the expence of quar- 
rying the ftones for them. He alfo gives manufactured 
lime for new ground, as a premium to the induftrious te- 
nant and cottar, at the rate of from 60 to 80 bolls an acre. 
Lime is much ufed as a manure by all improvers in farm- 
ing, but it is to be regretted, that fuel is rather fcarce, 
which enhances the price of lime, it being fo high as 2 s. 6 d. 
and 3 s. the boll of {hells, and that boll only making from i-L 
to 3 bolls flaked lime, which brings the price to a fhilling; 
the boll. The boll meafures 96 Scotch pints. 

Something more than 20 years ago, Sir James Grant 
built a fmall houfe, in a beautiful fituation, in the Strath of 
Urquhart 5 but as he refides there but feldom, the houfe is 
occupied by the minifter, whofe manfe is in a ruinous ftate, 
The Houfe of Corrimony, fituated at the head of the glen, 
is a good commodious lodging, and the place has been much 
improved by the prefent proprietor, who has made many 
inclofures, and otherwife embelliftied his feat. On the 
north-weft bank of Loch Meikly, and eftate of Corrimony, 
a very neat houfe has been lately built at Crafgag, now 
Lakefield, by Captain Grigor Grant, who has greatly im- 
proved the farm, and decorated the place. On the ibuth' 
fide of that lake, are the places of Lochletter and Shogly, 
on the property of Sir James Grant, but held on long leafe 
by Mr Grant of Shogly, now of Redcaftle, and Mr Grant 
of Lochletter ; thefe gentlemen built excellent houfes on 
their farms, which they improved confiderably.

At all the above places there are good gardens, which 
in favourable feafons, yield abundance of excellent fruit 

At the foot of Glenmoriiton, on the banks of Loch, 
uefs, Invermorifton, the feat of Major Grant, is fu ua _ 
ted. Nature has done a great deal for the place, in the 
grand and fublime ftyle. The proprietor Ihews a dif. 
pofition to cultivate and improve this place as it de- 
ferves. There are excellent gardens at Invermoriflon, 
which produce as early and high flavoured fruit as is to be 
found in any part of the north of Scotland. About 40 
years ago, the Truftees feued a piece of ground at Invermo- 
riflon, on which they eredled buildings for eftablilhing a ma- 
nufadlure of linen-cloth, and inftrucling the youth of that 
Glen in induftry and the principles of literature. Artifans, 
as weavers and fpinners, with a fchoolmafter and miftrefs 
or governefs, were brought from the Low Country, and the 
management of the bufinefs committed to the deceafed Mr 
Shaw, a very refpe£lable and proper man for the truft, 
But, after feveral years trial, without much effect in pi j- 
moting the purpofe intended, the fcheme was finally aban- 
doned, and the feu refold to the family of Glenmorifton. 

Roads and Bridges. — The principal roads which go 
through Urquhart are, 1. That from Invernefs to Fort-Au- 
guftus, along the north-weft fide of Lochnefs. This road 
was begun foon after the year 1760, but on account of its 
extreme difficulty, and the narrovvnefs of the funds, was 
carried on but {lowly for many years ; however, by dint of 
perfeverance, repeated aids from the county of Invernefs, 
and feveral liberal fubferiptions from the proprietors and 
other gentlemen connected with the parifh, an excellent 
road is now made through the woods and rocks of Aber- 
iachan, as far as the Strath of Urquhart, where an exceed- 
ing good inn has been lately built by Sir James Grant, at 

J5 



ofUrquhart and Glenmorifton. 311 



1 c miles diftance from Invernefs, and nearly half way to 
Fort-Auguftus. From Iuvernefs to Drumnadreochid, where 
the inn is built, carriages of all kinds travel with fafety ; 
from thence the road is carried on to Fort-Auguftus. but 
[this part of it is not yet fufficiently broad for carriages. 
The road is continued from Drumnadreochid to Corri- 
tnony, at the head of the valley ofUrquhart: it is fit for car- 
pages, and kept in good repair. 2. Another great road 
from Beauiy to Fort-Auguftus paries through Urquhart, and 
meets the Invernefs road at Drumnadreochid. 

The road from Invernefs to Drumnadreochid was made 
it a very great expence, through the rocks of Aberiachan, 
.vhich in feveral places required to be blown and cut with 
ron tools. This was perhaps one of the greateft underta- 
kings ever attempted in the Highlands, by a private Socie- 
y, without the aid of Government. Two great roads pafs 
hrough Glenmorifton, viz. The military road from Fort- 
Auguftus to Bernera, which has for feveral years paft falien 
nto great difrepair, being totally neglected by Government. 
The other great road, is that from the foot to the head of 
jlenmorifton, which, for want of funds, has never yet been 
:ompleted, but is very paflable for travellers on horfeback. 
This parifh has to uphold, and keep in repair, above 50 
niles of public, befides crofs roads ; and the fund for this 
mrpofe arifes from the commutation of the ftatute-labour, 
t 2 s. from each male above 15 years of age, and which 
mounts to about L. 50, and an affeffment of one penny 
kerling in the pound Scots of valued rent, amounting to 
i. 9 : 4 : n : this fund is fmall, but being managed with- 
peat care and economy, does wonders. 

The road from Invernefs to Glenelg, along the weft fide 
)f Lochnefs, has been furveyed by order of Lord A.dam 
cordon, Commander in Chief in Scotland, and an eftimate 

of

of the expence made. As this road would open a commu- 
nication between the eaftern and weftern parts of this coun- 
ty, to the Hebrides, and a part of Rofs-fhire, it would be a 
great public benefit, but it is not expected that it will be ef- 
fected until the return of the bleflings of peace. 

Antiquities. — The Caftle of Urquhart, a venerable rem- 
nant of antiquity, is now fallen into decay. It (lands on a 
jutting out rock, on the weft fide of Lochnefs, 12 Scotch 
miles from the town of Invernefs, and as many from Fort- 
Auguftus ; a pleafant and romantic fituation, command- 
ing a moft agreeable view of Lochnefs, almoft from the one 
end of it at Fort-Auguftus, to the other at Bona, and alfo 
of the lands, woods, and hills, furrounding the loch on the 
fouth, eaft, and north. The loch wafties the eaft wall of it, 
and the other three fides were fortified with a ftrong rampart, 
a ditch, and draw-bridge. Within the walls were buildings 
and accommodation for 500 or 600 men. This caftle was 
a royal fort, and granted, as above noticed, by King James 
IV. in 1509, with the eftate and lordfhip of Urquhart, to 
the Laird of Grant, in whofe family they ftill continue. 
For fome time before this grant was made, the Lairds of 
Grant polRffed the caftle and lands of Urquhart as the 
Crown's chamberlains. Abercromby the hiftorian faj's, 
that King Edward I. of England reduced this fort in 1303) 
and bafely put to the fword Alexander Bois the governor 
and his garrifon, who had bravely defended it. In 1334, 
the fame author lays, that Robert Lauder, governor of this 
fort, maintained it againft the Englifh, then in the caufe of 
7. ard Baliol. 

2 ice of Labour and Provifion. — The price of labour has 
ir.cre ifed greatly fince the commencement of this war. Till 
then, labourers were fatisfied with 8 d. or 9 d. a-day, with- 
out 



of Urquhart and Gknmorijlon. 



lout victuals ; but now they are not to be had at lefs than a 
{hilling : and at piece-work a great deal more is made, efpe- 
cially at the manufa&amp;ure of wood, where 2 s. and a s. 6 d. 
are not unfrequently earned. The wages of unmarried 
men-fervants, formerly, feldom exceeded L. % Sterling in the 
half year, with victuals in the family, married fervants 
had generally L. 3 a*year, with fix bolls of meal, at nine 
ftone to the boll, a houfe, with a cow's grafs and fodder, and 
the liberty of planting as many potatoes as they could pro- 
cure manure for. Women-fervants, from 30 s. to 40 s. in 
the year. All thefe are raifed in the proportion of from 
a third to a fourth. The price of all kinds of provifions is 
much the fame as in the Invernefs markets. 

Church, School, l£c. — The parifh-church, which (lands at 
Kilmore, near the foot of the Strath of Urquhart, was built 
in 1630, and about 25 years ago completely repaired, and 
is a decent comfortable place of worfhip. The minifter of- 
ficiates two Sundays out of three here, and the third at 
Meikly, fix miles up the country, where is alfo a very good 
chapel or meeting-houfe. The duty, in Glenmorifton, is 
generally done by the miffionary minifter of Fort- Auguftus, 
who preaches in that glen once in three weeks; and where 
there are two tolerable meeting-houfes. Before the efta- 
bliihment of this million, the minifter of Urquhart had to 
fupply every fourth Sunday in Glenmorifton, which made 
the charge a moft troublefome and fatiguing one ; but it is 
now only expected, that he goes thither occafionally, except 
when there is a vacancy in the million; in this event, he 
goes there regularly once a-month. But, until Glenmori- 
fton has a miflionary entirely to itfelf, the people cannot be 
properly accommodated with the means of religion, having 
at prefent fermon only once in the three weeks, though it 
is admitted, that the fchoolmafter and catechift, after noticed,

are great aids. Glenmorifton feems a proper ftation for a 
fociety midion. The fervicc is chiefly in Gaelic, the pre. 
vailing language of the country; but in Urquhart, efpecial. 
ly in the 'iummer months, Englifh is alfo preached; bnt fel- 
dom in Gknmorirron. Sir James Grant of Grant, Baro- 
net, is patron of the parifh, which lies in the prefbytery 0 f 
Abertarf, and fynod of Glenelg. Till the year 1724, that 
the above fynod and prefbytery were ere&amp;ed, Urquhart 
belonged to the prefbytery of Invernefs, and fynod of Mo. 
ray, which would be much more convenient for the incunv 
bent than the prefent arrangement. 

The ftipend, by decreet in 1796, is L. 100, and L. 5 fof 
communion-elements. The glebe is about fix acres of 
good land. The manfe is ruinous, but the minifter refides 
in a comfortable lodging of Sir James Grant's, and the he- 
ritors allow him L. 2c a-year in lieu of a manfe. 

There are two fchools in Urquhart, the parochial, and 
one fupporud by the Society for Propagating Chriftian 
Knowledge. The parochial fchool is within half-a-mile of 
the church. The falary is L. 14 per annum, with a houfe, 
the emoluments of precentor and feffion-clerk, with the 
quarter-payments from fcholars, are about L. 10; total 
L. 24. — C^irar'tefly payments are, 1 s. for reading Englifli ; 
is. 6 d. for reading and writing; and 2 s. when arithmetic 
is taughc. There is no Latin taught. 

The Society fchool is in the Braes of Urquhart ; the fala- 
ry L. ic, with L. 4 more to the fohoolmatter's wife, as 8 
fewi'.ig-mirtrefs. Befules thefe, the country finds them in a 
houfe, garden, cow's grafs, and fuel, and a little is made of 
the quarter-payments; but, all put together, the encou- 
ragement is greatly too fmall. The Society intend erect- 
ing another fchool at Bunleoid, on the fouth fide of Urqu- ■ 

hart,

hart, as foon as the requifite accommodations are provided, 
which are in forwardnefs. 

About 40 fcholars attend the parochial fchool in fum- 
mer, and 60 in winter ; and 30 the Society fchool in fum- 
mer, and 50 in winter; but it is to be regretted, that they 
are generally very young children, who do not remain long 
enough at fchool to receive much permanent benefit. In 
Glenmorifton a Society fchoolmafter is employed, with 
L. 15 falary, befides the ufual accommodations. There are 
feldom above 30 fcholars at this fchool. The Society 
fchoolmafters teach Gaelic, and reading the Scriptures in 
that language, as well as in Englifh. 

The Committee for managing the Royal Bounty, give 
L. 12 to a catechift in this parifh ; and both he and the So- 
ciety fchoolmaflers are moft ufeful in meeting the people, 
efpecially fuch as are dittant from places of worfhip, parti- 
cularly on the Lord's Day, when they pray and read with 
the inhabitants, and inftrudt them in the principles of reli- 
gion. 

In Glenmorifton there are about 80 Roman Catholics, 
and a very few in Urquhart ; bnt they are moderate, and 
feveral of them come occafionally to the Eftablifhed Church. 
The reft of the inhabitants are Proteftants of the Eftablifh- 
ed Church. 

The number of inhabitants in the parifh of Urquhart, of 
all ages, are 2355 ; of which, in Urquhart properly fo call- 
ed, there are 1710; and in Glenmorifton 645. In 1755, 
the number was 1943' fouls; the increafe confequently 
amounts to 412. The baptifms, at an average, are 80 ; 
and the marriages 20, in both diftridls. The deaths cannot 
be afcertained, as there are not lefs than four burial-grounds, 
at a great diftance from each other. The number of mar- 
riages and baptifms have increafed for feveral years paft, 

owing 



3 1 6 Statijlical Account 

owing to the more regular behaviour of the people, and 
their being in more comfortable circumftances. A proof of 
■which is, that early marriages are very frequent, and which, 
naturally, prevent irregularities. Here, it may be obfer- 
ved, that 8o men were raifed in 1793, for the Firft Fen- 
cible Regiment ; and there are now in the parifh two com- 
panies of volunteers ; one in Urquhart, of 60, and the other 
in Glenmorifton, 01*40 men. 

Poor. — In Urquhart there are fcarcely any travelling 
poor. About 30 receive aid from the feflion funds, which 
are the ordinary collections on Sundays, penalties for tref- 
pafles, (which are feldom), and the intereft of L. ico of 
mortifications and former favings, amounting, in all, to 
about L. 15 a-year ; but out of which the feflion -clerk and 
kirk-officer are paid L. 2 : 4 : 6 ; the remainder is divided 
according to the feveral exigencies of the poor. 

The Glenmorifton poor beg more generally from home 
than their neighbours of Urquhart, and they are more in 
number, in proportion to the inhabitants. Their funds are 
the intereft of about L. 25 of mortifications and bequefts, 
nv.d the Sunday colleclions and fines, amounting, at an ave- 
rage, to L. 3, befides the intereft of the above L. 25. 

The funds of each glen are kept feparate, and the poor 
of Urquhart receive nothing from Glenmorifton, nor thofe 
of Glenmorifton from Urquhart. In Urquhart, a quarterly 
collection is ufually made for bed-rids, and other great ob- 
jects in diftrefs, when it is expected that every perfon will 
contribute according to their ability. The produce of this 
makes a part of the aggregate fund ; but bed-rids, &amp;o get 
a much larger proportion. In fevere feafons, and to objects 
of great diftrefs, the heritors and other gentlemen are ex- 
tremely liberal and charitable. In the noted 1782, fo much 
attention was paid to the fituation of the neceflkous, that

few endured, and none fuffered by, want. In the fevcre 
fpring 1795, Sir James Grant ordered 20 guineas to be di- 
vided among the poor in this quarter. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervatwns.—Bdore the years 1745 and 
174$, this parifli was exceedingly expofed to depredations 
from their neighbours in the Weft Highlands, who came 
and took up their cattle and other property without cere- 
mony, for which they made no compenfation. Now, by 
the exercife of the laws, and a well governed police, pro- 
perty is as fecure as in any part of the ifland. Formerly, 
there were no roads, no bridges, no comfortable communi- 
cation through the parifh, and, in ftiort, no attention was 
paid to any object of police, whether public or private. 
Now, Urquhart is not more remarkable for its improve- 
ment in the external than in the internal parts of police. 
The heritors and other gentlemen have taken an active 
concern to promote this laudable purpofe. Moft of them 
acT: as Juftices of the Peace, and in this office perform a duty" 
of importance to fociety in general, and to this diftricl in 
particular. The improved ftate of the roads and bridges 
has been already taken notice of. It is well worthy of re- 
mark, that all civil difputes which may have arifen among 
the people on Sir James Grant's eftate in this parilh, have, 
for 30 _ ears paft, been determined by Mr Grant of Loch- 
letter, a gentleman acting in the capacity of baron-bailie, 
one excepted, in which he declined to judge, being of too 
criminal a nature for his jurifdi&amp;ion. Except this fingle 
caufe, none, during this long period, has gone before the 
fheriff-court of Invernefs, or other tribunal ; and the baron- 
bailie's decifions are equally remarkable for their ability 
and juflice, as for that general fatisfaftion they give the 
contending parties. This has not only tended to fave the 
poor people a deal of money, but has crufhed, in a great 

meafure,

meafure, the fpirit of litigation, and conduced very much to 
their civilization. 

The inhabitants are attentive to their religious duties, 
and, upon the Whole, fober, induftrious, and virtuous. 

The country contains all the neceffaries, and many of the 
comforts, of life, in abundance. It has been conficierably 
improved already, and improvement is progreflive. The 
lituation of the people becomes daily better, their living 
and clothing are much meliorated, and by perfeverence in 
the fame line of conduct, which at prefent diftinguiflies the 
fuperior and inferior, their mutual intereft and comfort will, 
under Providence, be ftill further promoted and increafcd.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q54809">BANFF</name>. 

(County of Banff, Synod of Aberdeen, and 
Presbytery of Fordyce.) 

By the Rev. Mr Abercromby Gordon.</head> 



<p>Name. 

THE town of Banff gives name to the county and pa* 
rifh, in which it is lituated. Its etymology is vari- 
oufly ftated, and indeed feems of little importance to trace. 

By fome, the name is faid to be of Gaelic extraction, 
fignifying a place furrounckd with high ground ; but this 
nterpretation apears too vague and general, and cannot 
well be applied to a fituation partly open to the fea. 

Banff was a part of the ancient thanedom of Boin, 
whence the name feems to be derived. In fome old char- 
ts it is fpelled Boineffe and Baineffe. The diftrict of Boin 
las probably received its name from a confpicuous moun- 
;ain in the neighbourhood of Cullen, called the Binn. On.

his dwelling ; and it is well known that the forreftry and 
thanedom territory extended thence to the borough lands 
of Banff, divided only by the water of Boindie *• 

Situation and Extent. — The fituation of this parifii $ 
fomevvhat peninfular, being bounded by the river Dove- 
ran on the eaft, which divides it from the parifh of Game- 
ry ; and by the water of Boindie on the weft, feparating it 
from the parifh of that name. On the fouth, it is bounded 
by part of the parifh of Alva ; and on the north, by the 
Murray Frith. 

It belongs to the prefbytery of Fordyce, and to the fy- 
nod and commiffariot of Aberdeen. This parifh forms an 
irregular oblong figure, ftretching from north to fouth-weft 
above fix miles •, and in breadth meafures from one and an 
half to two and an half miles. It may contain about 1% 
fquare miles, and 7680 acres. 

Surface and Soil. — The furface is in general beautifully*) 
unequal, and rifes gradually to the fouth-weft. The nature, 
and quality of the foil are no lefs various. There are all 
forts, the rich fertile loam, the deep ftrong clay, the light 
fandy field, and the thin gravelly bottom. 

Sea-coajl and Rivers. — The fea coaft, for half-a-mile weft- 
ward of the harbour, is bold and rocky. 

Towards the water of Boindie it forms a fine fandy 
beach, adjoining which is the links f, affording an excel-

* The following etymology is hazarded: Boiny or Boindie is faitl, in the 
Gaelic, to fignify a little hill, and in this parifh there are a great number of 
knolls, mounts and rifing grounds.

The only river is the Doveran, which has its fource in 
Aberdeenfhire, and, winding through many fruitful and 
i highly cultivated plains, falls into the fea at Banff. 

State of Property, Valued and Real Rents. — The Earl of 
: Findlater, the Earl of Fife, and Lord Banff, are the princi- 
pal proprietors ; of whom, Lord Fife is the only rending 
heritor. 

The valued rent of the landward part of the parifii is 
L. 2313 Scots. The real rent, including the falmon-fifhing 
and town's lands, is eftimated at L. 4500 Sterling. 

Burgh. — The town is fituated at the influx of the river 
Doveran, on a fine declivity, opening to the eaft and fouth- 
eart; commanding various and delightful profpeefs^ From 
the floping road, on the oppofite fide the river, the varie- 
gated fcenery which opens to the view is highly gratifying, 
and never fails to attract the attention of ftrangers. 

The noble manfion of the Earl of Fife, the fpacious 
lawn and extenfive pleafure-grounds in his Lordfhip's park, 
the fmooth flowing Doveran, with its ftately bridge, the 
town and caftle of Banff, the bay, harbour and fhipping, are 
the flriking objects which at once prefent themielves to the 
eye, and charm every traveller of tafle. 

Banff is an ancient royalty, and the capital of the county. 
In conjunction with Elgin, Cullen, Inverury, and Kintore, 
it fends a Commiffioner to Parliament. 

At what precife period it was erected into a royal burgh 
cannot be afcertained. According to tradition, it was 
in the reign of Malcolm Canmore. It is, however, certain, 
that Malcolm IV. called the Maiden, was at Banff, A. D. 
1163.

William the Lyon gives a toft and garden in the burgh, 
of Banff to his chaplain Archibald Douglas, bifliop of Mo- 
ray, A. D. 1165 ; and fimilar gifts are made to him in the 
towns of Invernefs, Nairn, and Cullen, all royal burghs at 
this period. 

King Robert Bruce confirms the privileges of royalty, 
and King Robert II. 7th October 1372, alfo confirms the 
fame, and fuch other privileges and liberties as were eny . 
joyed by the town of Aberdeen. 

Thefe grants were followed by confirmations from King 
James VI. and Charles II. 

Municipal government, is'c. — -The town is governed by 
a provoft, four bailies and twelve counfellors. Eight of ; 
the old council are re-elected, and the new counfellors are: 
chofen annually out of the merchant guild-brethren. 

The annual revenue of the burgh amounts to L. 300 
Sterling, arifing chiefly from feu-duties, rents of lands, 
more-dues and petty cuftoms. 

Alienation of Lands and Fi/bings. — Such was the diftrefled 
iituation of the burgeffes, A. D. 1470, that, having no 
power to increafe their revenues but by leafe alone, the 
managers of the town, without fraud, and upon their great 
aith, with confent of all and fundry neighbours of Banff, let 
out to certain burgeffes, for 19 years, the whole of their 
falmon-fifhings, confiding of 12 nets, for the " infefting ; !

» fors, for all Chrittiane foules ; for the theikmg of the

I quhat the burgh has not fubftance." Similar leafes were 
probably granted until the year i 581, when George Ogi - 
vie of Dunlugas, provoft, and his coadjutors in office, revi- 
ved to feu to perpetuity. To this effect they obtained a 
charter from James II. of Scotland, dated May 9. 1581. 
The preamble bears, that, « for the advantage of the burgh *, 
« the council had been in ufe of granting leafes of their 
« property to the rending burgeffes ; that thefe leafes were 
« now expired, and that the nobility in the neighbourhood 
" feeing the fame, and hoping to acquire the profits, did 
" trouble and moleft the peace of the town, and gave no 
* reft to the people : therefore," &amp;c. &amp;c. 

This charter was renewed on the King's attaining the 
age of 25 years, mutatis mutandis. 

Having thus obtained a right to let out their property to 
perpetuity, the guardians proceeded to exercife their powers. 
John Baird, provoft, and the bailies of the town, (two of 
whom could not write), were among the commiflioners ap- 
pointed ad hunc effe&amp;um. Accordingly, A. D. 1595, " be- 
" caufe of the warres and troubles, the darth of the coun-

taxations for fupporting the warres, the public warkes, and

i*' rr.eid whereof, this empower to fet, fell and feu, the com- 
mon land and falmon-fi firings of the burgh, to merchant- 
I" burghers, and actual relidenters." 

Thefe magistrates and commiflioners, in confequenqe of 
their inftru&amp;ions, did accordingly let out to perpetuity, for 
ja fmall annual feu-duty, the greater part of their lands, and 
jthe whole of their falmon-filhings.

In the above-mentioned charter of 1592, the King, in ou 
der to preferve the government of the town pure from any 
mixture of orijlocracy, gives power to the council to di£. 
pole of their property to refiding hurgeffes and their heirs, 
viale only. Had this arrangement been cautioufly executed, 
the intentions of the original granters might have, been ac- 
compliflied ; but it is evident, that the ancient governors, if 
not too attentive to their own intereft, were at lead fome- 
what negligent of the advantages of future generations. 
Thus did the meafure defeat its own pnrpofe, and produced 
the confequences they wifhed to avoid ; for though the*] 
neighbouring nobility have not molefted the peace and quiet a 
of the inhabitants, they have got poffeflion of the property, 
as the Earl of Fife has purchafed near three-fourths of the. 
whole, and the Earl of Findlater and Lord BanfF a confider- 
able part of the remainder. It was the remark of Deana 
Swift, which the prefent fituation of this burgh ftronglyv 
confirms, that " great changes and alienations of property 
" have created new and great dependencies." 

Duff Houfe and Pari. — Duff Houfe, the principal feat oh 
the Earl of Fife, and the beautiful fcertery of his Lordfhip's 
park, are well known to the tourift, and defcribed in the 
journals of feveral celebrated travellers. 

The houfe- is a large quadrangular building, planned and* 
executed by the late celebrated Mr Adam. 

The architecture is iuperb, but the delign is not Jt&amp;i 
completed. The original plan, which is truly magnificent, 
may be feen in Wolf's Vitmvius. 

Duff Houfe contains feveral very elegant apartments, in' 
which is a great profufion of paintings, chiefly portraits. 
Thofe particularly noticed by Mr Pennant, are, France; 
Duchefs of Richmond, a full length, in black, painted in

The library is a fpacious room, near 70 feet in length, 
and extending through the whole breadth of the building. 
The books are numerous, and well feledted. In a fmall 
apartment adjoining, is a cabinet, containing an extenfive 
colle&amp;ion of Roman and Britifh coins, medals, &amp;c. 

Lord Fife's park and furiounding plantations meafure 14 
miles in circumference. 

The park is bounded by the two bridges of Banff and. 
Alvah, and contains within its circuit a part of two coun- 
ties, and four pariflies *. The pleafure grounds are laid 
out with much tafte and elegance. The walks are of 
great extent and variety, fome winding beautifully along 
the banks of the Doveran, and others leading off, in diffe- 
rent directions, to wide and diftant plantations. 

About three miles from the houfe, -where the river is 
confiderably narrowed by the lofty and impending craigs 
of A.lvah, a majeftic arch is thrown acrofs, which is highly 
pi&amp;urefque. Here the view which prefents itfelf is pecu-

Agriculture and Improvements. — The ftate of agriculture 
in this parifh continued ftationary for almoft a century pre. 
ceding 1754. 

This fatt is confirmed, by confidering that the land rent 
fuffered little or no change during the above period. From 
the proven renfal in the former decreet of {Upend, it ap- 
pears, that the lands belonging to the town paid no advance 
of rent from 1635 to 1729. 

The extenfive pafturage of the Gallow-hill, the property 
of the town, was then rented at the pitiful fum of 10 merks 
yearly. 

In 1754, the town-council feued out thefe grounds to 
the inhabitants at 10 s. per acre, with a referve to them of 
buying up the feu-duty at 25 years purchafe. 

Induftry, fuperior culture, the advantages of fea-weed, 
and vicinity to the town, have now rendered what was ori- 
ginally barren, fertile and productive. 

Thefe lands are regularly fubdivided, and inclofed with 
fubftantial ftone fences, may be let from L. 1 to L. 3 an 
acre, and produce excellent crops of all kinds. A few 
fields adjoining the town are rented fo high as L. 5 and 
L. 6 per acre. Thefe are chiefly occupied by gardeners, 
who raife pot-herbs and other vegetables for the fupply of 
the inhabitants. 

About 40 years ago, potatoes and turnips were cultivat- 
ed, as 1 are vegetables, in the garden, and were not brought 
tp market. Now, cattle are chiefly fed by turnip; potatoes 
are frequently given to horfes, and are fold in great abun- 
dance by the gardeners, and in the weekly markets, at 6d. 
and 7 d. a peck, of 32 lbs weight. 

It is a curious facT:, that on the introduction of this ufe- 
ful root, the great landholders were alarmed left it fhould 
be the means of depreciating the value of grain, the ftaple 

commodity 



of Banff.

commodity of the country. The elFecl, however, has been 
the reverfe ; grata of all kinds being, for fome years pair, 
in greater demand, and at higher prices, than at any former 
period. 

Prior to the year 1754, the practice of winter-herding 
was little known. No fooner was the harveft completed, 
than the whole country became one great common, and every 
farmer confidered he had an undoubted right to pafture his 
flocks on his neighbour's fields. In thofe days, even the 
belt farms were generally divided into what is called out- 
field and infield ; and both were wafted by an injudicious 
mode of cropping. From this torpid Mate the farmer was 
roufed by the fpirited exertions of the late Earl of Findla- 
ter, who happily introduced a new fyftem of farming in 
this country. His Lordfhip, during his refidence in the 
Caftle of Banff, having taken one of his farms into his own 
poffeffion, determined to cultivate it after the moft appro- 
ved methods then known in the kingdom. With this 
view, he engaged an adlive and experienced ov,erfeer from 
England, to whom he devolved the management of this 
farm, and in a few years improved it in a ftile and manner 
unknown in this country #. 

To conquer the power of habit, and eradicate ancient 
prejudices, is often a fruitlefs attempt, and is a talk pecu- 
liarly difficult in effecting agricultural improvements. Such, 
however, was the influence of his Lordlhip's eminent ex- 
ample as a farmer, joined to the judicious encouragement 
which he afforded his tenants, that, in a few years, a fpirit 
of induftry and enterprife pervaded all ranks of proprietors 
and farmers in this country, and produced a ftriking im- 
provement in the foil and appearance of this parifh and 
neighbourhood.

Statiftical Account 



Lord Findlater was alfo the firft who introduced, on a 
large fcale, the practice of fallow, and the ufe of lime, fow- 
ing grafs-feeds, turnip and other green crops-, improvements 
now generally adopted, and with great fuccefs. His Lord- 
fhip's improvements, with the general mode of farming 
pradlifed in this corner, will be found more fully detailed 
in the Agricultural Reports of this county. 

Farms. — The farms moft remarkable for beauty, extent 
and improvement, in this parifh, are, Colleonard and Boia- 
die Hills, belonging to Lord Findlater, and Blairfhinnoch, 
the property of Lord Banff. The firft of thefe was one of I 
Lord Findlater's experimental farms. It lies on a gentle 
declivity, opening to the fouth, and commands a variety of : 
pleafing profpe&amp;s. The fields are laid out with much tafte 
and judgment, inclofed and fubdivided with hedge-rows 
and belts of thriving wood. It bears a ftriking refemblance 
to a fine Englifh farm, and to thofe who remember its for- 
mer appearance, it feems altogether a new creation. The 
farm of Blairfhinnoch contains about 400 acres, and is ge- 
nerally a productive field. 

Boindie Hills is chiefly occupied as a fheep farm, and : 
proves a very lucrative poiTeffion to Mr Milne, affording 
excellent pafture to a flock of 200 to 300 fneep, chiefly of 
Englifh breed, and of the largeft fize. 

Nor, in this account, muft we omit the little farm of 
Cowden Knows *, diftant about a mile from the town, and 
juftly celebrated for its rural beauty. 

Attracted by its wild and fimple fcenery, the prefent te- 
nant has chofen this ferme ornee as a fummer retreat.

Prices of grain, b'C. at different periods. — Meal was fold, 
by contract for feven years, at 8 s. 6 d. per boll, commen- 
cing with crop 1758; at 9 s. for the fame period, commen- 
cing with crop 1764; and at 9 s. 6 d. from 1767. Ten 
millings was considered a reafonable price for a contract of 
feven years, commencing 1768. The medidm price of 
meal, for 20 years preceding 1782, was lis. 74- d. ; and 
from that year to 1795, about 13 s. 2 d. 

For fome years part, oats have been fold at 1 s. 1 d. and 
is. 2d. per ftone weight •*. Meal and barley have given 
proportionably high prices. Such was the alarming defici-

Owing to the late injudicious opening of the ports for importation, ami 
the threatening of a farther depreflion of the diltillerics, there is at prefent 
an extraordinary ftagnation in the falc of grain, which muft be attended: 
with the mod ferious confeqtiences to the farmer. 

In feafons of plenty, the impolicy of opening the ports for importation! 
muft be obvious to the humbleft capacity. When prices arc low, in con- 
fequence of fuch plenty, a bounty ought to be given upon exportation ; and 
that bounty ought to be continued until the price rifes to a certain height. 

t There muft be fomething very fecluctive, or very profitable, in the im- 
" portation of foreign grain ; for all the laws that have hitherto been madea 
" to prevent it, have been evaded ; and yet, except the importer, it is' 
" clearly againft the intereft of every other perfon in the kingdom : for it 
" is deftructive of our own agriculture ; and we have feen, from certain evU- 
" dence, that it raifes the priceof grain upon the confumer. 

" While the ancient laws laid the country open to the importation of fo. 
" reign grain, by injudicious duties or reftriitions upon our own produce,. 
" our farmers were difpirited ; a great part of the foil lay without culture; 
" the price of grain was confequentiy high ; and populatioa was reftraic- 
»« ed. 

" When the reftriflions were not only removed, but bounties given tipou. 
" the exportation of our excrefcent- flock,, by the acts of r6S8 and 1700^ 
" the happieft effects were immediately experienced : Thefe laws acted like- 
" magic ; our agriculture immediately rofe, as from the dead ; population in- 
" creafed; and inftead of eating the bread of foreign nations, we not only 
" maintained all our own people, at a lower rate than was ever known before,-, 
" but the kingdom received an immediate addition of riches and itrength, 

from the money brought in, from the increafe of ftrrpping, and from the 
" people employed in railing and exporting the furplus of our produce: 
" A ftate of profperity which continued without interruption for above- 
" half a century after the Union. No fooner was importation again en- 
t* couraged, than our agrirultur«flangui(ried, our exportation declined, and- 
* ! the prices of grain rofe." 

" Impcrtation of foreign grain acts like a mole under ground ; we know 
" nothing of its operations but by the heaps which its raifes; and w cn 
* thefe heaps co.re to cover ?.n 8th, an itfrb, or ev*n a 475th part ot our 
** own foil, it is high time to turn them dowr.''

Implements of Hufbandry. — In no branch of agriculture 
lias there been a more finking and eflential improvement 
than in the conftruction of the implements of hufbandry. 
Carts were not ufed in this parith till the year 1728, when 
Mr Duff of Corfindae, then rending , in Banff, introduced 
them, having procured two timber carts," at the price of 
5 s. each. The creel or curroch was then the common ve- 
hicle in ufe. Grain, meal, and lime for exportation, were 
brought hither on horfeback, from the mofl inland parts of 
the country. 

The only plough then ufed, was what is known by the 
name of the old Scottifh plough, in its rudeft form. Now, 
carriages, ploughs, harrows, and the various utenfils of huf* 
bandry, of the moft approved and modern conflrudtion, are 
-either imported from Lekh, or manufactured in this coun- 
try. Thefe are generally painted ; a practice which has 
both ornament and utility to recommend it *. 

Nurfery. — Adjoining the farm of Colleonard, there is a 
■nurfery of confiderable extent, conducted by Mr Reid, It 
was begun about 30 years ago, and has of late been greatly 

enlarged 

The above fa5b and obfervations are taken from " An Inquiry into the 
" Corn Laws and Corn Trade of Great Britain, and their influence on the 
" Profperity of the Kingdom ; by the late Alexander Diiom, Efq; of Muir- 
" efk." 

Mr Dirom was amply qualified for the inveftigation of thefe important 
fubjedts. He was particularly acquainted with the ftate of this county, ha- 
ving long refided in Eanff. 

» The ingenious Bifhop of Llandaff, in his Chemical Eftays, obfTve^, 
" Since the fame piece of wood has different weights, when dry, and when 
" foaked with water, the covering carts, ploughs, and other hufbandry gear 
" ufually made of afh, with a coarfe kind of paint which will keep out the 
" rain, is a pra&amp;ice full as ferviceable in leffening the weight of the im- 
« plement which is to be moved by the ftrength of man or horfe, as in

enlarged and improved. It occupies between 15 and 20 
acres, and contains all the variety of fruit and foreft trees, 
ever-green and flowering fhrubs, flower roots and plants, 
which are in demand in this climate. 

A gentleman in this neighbourhood, Mr Garden of 
Troup, in the courfe of three or four years, has planted 
from Mr Reid's nurfery, the immenfe number of one mil- 
lion nine hundred thoufand trees, befides what he procured 
from other quarters, and the greater part in a thriving 
ftate *. 

Woods, fac. — It is generally fuppofed, that a confiderable 
part of this parifh, towards the fouth-weft, has been covered 
with woods, and belonged to the ancient foreft of Boin. 
A fimple diftich, which tradition has handed down, con, 
firms this opinion ; 

From Culbirnie + to the fea,

There is ftill in poffeffion of a farmer in that quarter, an 
oak tree, 3c feet long, which was dug up in the neighbour- 
hood of his farm. 

Since the decay or demolition of that foreft, there were 
very few trees in this diltricL till the year 1756, when Lord 
Fife began his plantations. Thefe are now of great extent 
and variety, and in a flourifhing ftate. 

The woods on Lord Findlater's eftates in this parifti are 
likewife thriving, and of confiderable extent. 

All thefe plantations add greatly to the decoration of 
the country, to the comfort of the poor, and to the facility 
of every branch of indnftry.

Ecclefuijlical State. — From the public records it appears, 
that the kirk of Banff was rebuilt by the town-council in 
the year 1471, when Sir James Ogilvie of Defkford was 
provoft. They endowed a chaplain, with ten merks of 
ftipend, belides 51 living out of the common fund. Before 
this period, the chaplainry of St Mary, of the order of Car- 
melites, was the only other eftablilhment of worfhip in the 
royalty. 

The parifhes of Banff and Inverboindie continued united 
till the year 1634, when Mr Alexander Seton, then mini- 
fter of Banff, brought an aftion * of valuation and modifica- 
tion of the teinds againft the heritors, by which the union 
was declared void, and each holden to be a feparate parifh, 
and diftinc~t congregation. 

The firft minifter of this parifh, after its disjunction from 
Boindie, was Mr Alexander Seton. He died 1679, and was 
fucceeded by Mr Patrick Innes, minifter of Defkford, who 
died anno 1699. His fucceffor in office was Mr William 
Hunter, minifter of Tyrie. In 17 12, Mr Hunter being fu- 
fpended from preaching, upon his refufal of the abjuration 
oath, the church was fupplied by the brethren of the neigh- 
bourhood. The following year he returned to his charge, 
and died 1716. Mr James Innes was admitted in Decem- 
ber 1716, and died September 1753. ^ n December fol-

ftipend payable to each minifter, at 3-5- chalders 0/ victual, and 350 merks

Chair in the Univerfity of Glafgow. He was fucceeded by 
Mr Andrew Skene, minifter of Keith, who died at Bath, in 
December 1792. 

The prefent incumbent, Mr Abercromby Gordon, was 
admitted in Auguft 1793. 

The parilh church was built in the years 1789 and 1790, 
after the model of the new church at Dundee ; of which 
Mr Pennant fays, " It is built in a ftile that does credit to 
M the place, and mews an enlargement of mind in the Pref- 
" byterians, who now begin to think that the Lord may be 
" praifed in beauty of holinefs." 

The body of the church meafures 80 feet in length, and 
50 of breadth, within the walls. It is of proportionable 
height. Four Ionic columns fupport the galleries, which 
form five fides of an oclagon, and are high and fpacious. 
The church is elegantly finilhed within, and, exclufive of 
roomy pafiages, will contain 1500 perfons. The pulpit is 
perhaps raifed to an incommodious height, being an afcent 
of 21 fteps. Some of my brethren, accuftomed to a more 
humble roftrum, decline officiating in fo elevated a fitua- 
tion, and are ready to exclaim with the poet, 

— How fearful 

And dizzy 'tis, to caft one's eyes fo low ! 

— I'll look no more, 

Left my brain turn, and the deficient fight 
Topple down headlong. Shakespeare. 

The roof is a curious and mafly ftruclure. It has ten prin- 
cipal couples, whofe beams extend the whole width of the 
houfe, and fupport the cieling. The couples are ftrongly 
bound with iron, having 700 pounds weight on each. 

The fpire ftill remains in an unfinifhed ftate, which gives 
the whole building a heavy and awkward appearance. It 
is intended, however, to refume the work next feafon.

The church has already coft L. 2400. The old church 
was taken down only laft year, excepting an ancient vault- 
ed aifle, on the fouth fide, now a burying place of Lord 
Banff's family. 

By a late decree of augmentation, the minifter's ftipend 
is 60 bolls barley, 52 bolls meal, L. 63 Sterling money. 
In this are included the vicarage tithes converted, and L. 5. 
as the allowance for communion-elements. 

The glebe, which confifts of feven and one half acres, is 
a beautiful and fertile field, immediately adjoining the, 
town. 

The msnfe was fubftantially repaired about three years 
ago, and is a comfortable residence. For this purpofe, and; 
for rebuilding the garden-walls, the heritors molt cheerfully 
granted L. 250, with an annual allowance to the prefent 
minifter of L. 10, for upholding thefe repairs. 

The garden contains nearly half an acre of ground, and 
is. a moft productive fpot. 

The Earl of Findlater is patron. The Magistrates alfo 
claim the right of patronage, and have been in habit of for- 
mally protelting againft his Lordihip's prefentation. It is 
apprehended, however, that fuch proteft can be of no avail 
in preferving their rights, unlefs made before the prefenta- 
tion is received and fuftained by the prefbytery, a mode 
•which has not been attended to in this inftance. 

Banff is not a collegiate charge, though the numbers of 
ihe people would require, and the fuuds in the parifh are 
fufficient to endow, a iecond minifter. Befides the Efta- 
bliftied Church, there are three places of worfhip in this 
town, the Epifcopal chapel, the church of Relief, and a 
Roman Catholic meeting-houfe. 

From the ftatemcnt of the Reverend Mr Skinner, late 
minifter of St Andrews Chapel, the numbers in his charge 
amount nearly to 30c. Formerly they were divided, and

belonged partly to the communion of the Church of Eng- 
land, and partly to the Epifcopal Church of Scotland. But 
in the year 1792, when a bill pafied in Parliament, relie- 
ving the laity of the latter perfuafion from thofe forfeitures, 
penalties and difabilities, to which they had long been fub- 
jedled, both congregations, with a few exceptions, united 
under the fpiritual jurifdi&amp;ion of the Bifhop of Aberdeen. 

The chapel is conveniently fituated, neat and commodi- 
ous, and has a well-toned fmall organ. 

The poor are admitted to the benefit of the public funds 
of the parifh •, in return for which, an annual collection is 
made in the chapel on Chriftmas evening, which the cler- 
gyman diftributes indifcriminately to the poor of other per- 
fualiqns. 

The church of Relief was built in the year 1780, is fi- 
tuated in the Seatown, and is a very commodious edifice* 
The congregation, which is numerous, is compofed partly

Here is a fmall hofpital or bede-houfe, which affords lodg- 
ing to eight poor decayed women. It has no other endow- 
ment than what is derived from the parochial funds, and 
the donations of charitable individuals *. 

In few places are the poor iupplied with more liberality 
than in Banff. Hence the great number of this defcription 
who refort hither from neighbouring parilhes, and become 
ftationary. At the fame time, it may be remarked, that 
here, as in moft other towns, indigence is often marked 
with the appearance of greater wretchednefs than in coun- 
try villages, or the folitary cottage. 

Thofe who are entrufted with the management of the 
poor's funds, have too frequent caufe to obferve, and to la- 
ment, that our charitable contributions, intended as the re- 
ward of merit, or the refuge of misfortune, are fometimes, 
and unavoidably, bellowed on the indolent, the intempe- 
rate, and the undeferving, whether natives or ftrangers.. 
But, " to do the beft, (obferves an eloquent writer), can 
" feldom be the lot of man ; it is fufficient if, when oppor- 
" tunities are prefented, he is ready to do good. How

Here was a convent of Carmelites, or White Friars, 
confecrated to the Virgin Mary. This order of mendicant 
friars derived their origin and name from Mount Carmel, 
in Syria. St Lewis, King of France, returning from Alia, 
brought along with him fome of this feci, whom he 
eftabliihed in Paris. They were afterwards divided into 
33 provinces, of which Scotland was the 13th. They 
were denominated White Friars, from their exterior drefs. 
It feems probable, that a convent of thefe Carmelites was 
eftabliihed in Banff, by Alexander III. ; although the firft

Sir Walter Ogilvie of Denlugas, eager to acquire an ad- 
dition of landed property, laid in his claim, before the Re- 
formation, for a gift of this religious convent, and obtained 
a grant thereof, anno 1544 *. The family of Denlugas re- 
tained poileffion of thefe heritages till 1630, when they be- 
came the property of the Earl of Airly, and in 1690 
were purchafed by the Laird of Bracco, anceftor of Lord 
Fife. The fupericrity, with the feu-duties, were gifted 
by James VI. to the King's College of Aberdeen, and 
bought from them, in 1752, by the Earl of Fife. 

Two of the Carmelite cells are ftill to be feen, near the 
old church, in a pretty entire ftate. 

The beautiful green mount in Lord Fife's park, and ano- 
ther of inferior fize, fituated in the middle of the town, 
formed a part of the Carmelites territory. Thefe mounts 
appear to have been chiefly the work of art, and are fup-

Cajlle of Banff. — The Caftle of Banff was a conftabulary 
of old, fuch as Cullen, Elgin, Forres, and Nairn. It was 
a place of ftrength, and faid to be occasionally the refidenoe 
of the King, when vifiting this part of his dominions. Ia 
his Majefty's abfence, it was the mefTuage of the thane, 
flicriff, or conftable, and the feat where juftice was admini- 
ftered. 

By the public records it appears, that Walter de Leflie 
obtained a charter, dated at Perth, 1364, of many lands, 
among others, of Blairftiinnoch in this parifh, for furnifhing 
to the King a foldier to attend him, at three head courts: 
" Apud Caftrum de Banffe." The office of fheriff continued 
annexed to the caftle till 1636, when the fheriffdom was 
refigned by the Earl of Buchan to Sir James Baird of Auch.

fliop of St Andrew's. 

In 1683 Sir — — Sharp of Stonyhill difponed the Caftle

Bright till the abolition of heritable jurifdiftions in 1748. 

Part of the ancient wall is yet entire ; and the remains of 
the moat and intrenchments are ftill vifible. 

Excepting a fmall adjoining houfe, therefidence of Arch- 
biftiop Sharp's father, the caftle is now a plain modern 
building *. Its fituation is uncommonly pleafing and ro- 
mantic, and few dwellings can boaft of a greater variety of 
charming profpecls. 

In the caftle are fome good paintings and prints j parti- 
cularly a picture of the celebrated Jamiefon, by his own 
hand. He is reprefented fitting in his painting chamber, 
with his hat on, and his pallet before him. On the walls 
of his room feem carelefsly to be hung feveral productions 
of his various pencil. 

Near to the caftle was fituated the chaplainry of the 
Holy Rood, or San&amp;i Cruris, confecrated in commemoration 
of our Saviour's fufFerings. At what period, or by what 
founder, this chapel was erected, no information can be de- 
rived, either from tradition or ancient record. From an old 
regifter of the town-council, 1544, we learn, that this reli- 
gious houfe lay within the liberties of the burgh, and com-

The Caftle of Inchdrewer, on the cflate of Lord Banff, is 
fit:uated on a fine rifing ground, about four miles fouth-weft 
of the town. It is {till entire and habitable. By the ftile 
of its archite&amp;ure, it feems to have been built about the 
time of King James IV. or V. This is the opinion of the 
celebrated Grofe, who in his book of Antiquities has given 
a correct view of this caftle f . 

Two fields, near the confines of this parifh, are diftin- 
guilhed by the names of Arrdane and Swordane. Whether 
thefe have ever been the fcenes of battle, and derived their 
names from the arrows and fwords of the Danes, muft be 
left to more able antiquaries to explore and determine. 

Population — The writer of this report is not poflefled of I 
materials fufficient to enable him to afcertain, with precifion, 
the number of inhabitants in this parifti at former periods. 
It is obvious, however, that the great increafe of buildings, , 
in different parts of the town, has occafioned a proportion- 
able increafe of population. 

It appears from a lift drawn up by the late minifter, in \ 
the year 1782, that the numbers in the town then were 
3380. By a very accurate roll made up 1797, the num-

years — The writer of this Report baptized a child about 
18 months ago, whofe mother, grandmother, great grand- 
father, and great great grandmother, (five generations in a 
direel line), are all alive. 

Air, Climate, Difeafes, \£c. — If the fituation of Banff is 
conlidered with regard to thofe circum (lances which have 
an influence on the health of the inhabitants, there are m a- 
ny advantages in this view which it poflefles in an eminent 
degree. 

The town flands on a riling ground, and the houfes in 
general are built on a dry hard ftratum, in many places in- 
termixed with land. 

Such a fituation is certainly more favourable to a free 
circulation of air than a dead flat ; and the dry foundation 
of the houfes prevents thofe deleterious confequences which 
arife from breathing within doors a damp unwholefome at- 
mofphere. From the river, flowing immediately below 
the town, there are no fwamps in its neighbourhood •, nor 
in any direction around' it are there any ftagnating waters, 
whofe noxious effluvia might prove injurious tc health. 
Thus, from local fituation, are the inhabitants exempted 
from a fource of contagion, whence intermittents, and many 
low fevers, derive their origin. ' On the other hand, as the 
town lies open to the north and north-eafl, the cold -winds 
of thefe points, blowing immediately from the fea, renders 
the inhabitants of this place liable to rheumatifm, coughs, 
pectoral complaints, fore throats, and inflammatory fevers. 
The fevers of a different complexion, which fometimes pre- 
vail, are to be confidered, upon the mofl probable and ra- 
tional principles, as originating from irregularities in living, 
from contagion, and, among the lower clafs of people, from 

fmall, 



of Banff.

fmali, confined, and often crowded houfes, where the air 
breathed is foul and noxious, and from inattention to clean- 
linefs, particularly of bed and bed-clothes, which are too 
feldom warned, and very rarely ventilated. 

Such exifting caufes will, in all fituations, have an influ- 
ence in producing fevers of a malignant kind, or of altering 
the type of thofe which, upon their rirft attack, appear in- 
flammatory. 

A reformation in regard to the above particulars, as far 
as it could be effected, would prove of the moft beneficial 
confequences. 

The advantages' attending local iituation would be much 
improved, and rendered more complete, by conducting into 
the town, from fprings in the neighbourhood, a fufficient 
fupply of good wholefome water. This meature, though 
exp^nlive, is practicable, and its expediency is apparent 
from this circumftance, that the water in general, over the 
whole town, is more or lefs hard and brackifh. 

Proper regulations eftablifhed, enforced, and uniformly 
maintained, for keeping the ftreets perfectly clean, and free 
from all baneful and putrid i'ubftances, would be highly con- 
ducive to health and comfort. 

An infectious fever prevailed here, with unufual violence, 
about the year 1782. Un wholefome food, particularly an 
immoderate ufe of potatoes, (that year of a bad kind), were 
among the fecondary caufes to which this fever was aferi- 
bed. 

Mr Skene, the late mini iter of this parifh, a gentleman 
alike diftinguifhed by his great medical knowledge, and his 
humane gratuitous practice, wrote a fmall treadle on this 
fever, in form of a * Serious Addrefs to the People,"' &amp;c. 

This fhort addrefs, which Provoft Robinfon was at the 
expence of printing and publifhing, contained feveral plain 
fenfible inftructions refpecting the prevention and treatment 
of the difeafe, and points out the means by which health

may be preferved from every diforder of an infectious na- 
ture *. 

Inoculation. — The practice of inoculation for the fmall- 
pox is by no means become general among the lower ranks. 
The too tender confidences of the fuperftitious interpofe, to 
rob them of its falutary benefits. We tempt God, fay 
they, by voluntarily bringing on a difeafe which we might 
poflibly have efcaped : We throw ourfelves in the way of 
danger ; we diftruft the Providence of Almighty God, who 
is all-fufficient to deliver us. 

Thefe words have, indeed, the appearance and the voice 
of piety, but they have nothing elfe. There are few of 
the actions of life to which the objection might not more or 
lefs apply. Does not the man, for inltance, equally tempt 
God, who, apprehending a mortification in one of his limbs, 
fubmits to lofe it by the operation of a furgeon. Perhaps 
the dreaded mortification might not have taken place, and 
the patient facrifices his life to his timid caution. Yet no 
man of common fenfe will difpute, that the practice of am- 
putation is falutary on the whole, and is the means of pre- 
ferving many valuable lives to the community f. 

Mineral 

* Among other advices, Mr Skene ftrenuoufly recommends great atten- 
tion to cleanlinefs, wafhing the chamber of the fick perfon with foap and 
hot water, and, upon recovery of the patient, that his apartment fliould be 
white-wafhed with lime, frefh flacked, laid on hot, and the windows opened 
every clay.

Mineral Springs. — As a matter connc&amp;ed with the health 
of the inhabitants of this place, and, under proper manage- 
ment, beneficial to the public at large, it may be proper to 
mention a powerful chalybeat fpring, (the Well of Boindie), 
within two lhort miles of Banff. 

In chronic cafes, attended with debility and relaxation, 
where tonic medicines are admifiible, the water is ufed with 
manifeft advantage; but, unfortunately, this well is conli- 
dered by the country people at large as a Panacea, and re- 
forted to as fuch by great numbers, afflicted with difeafes 
very oppolite in their natures. The refult is what may na- 
turally be inferred ; many are cured or relieved, while 
others return not only difappointed of expected benefit, but 
fuffering under aggravated complaints. They fometimes, 
too, place as much dependence on the quantity, as on the 
quality, of the water. Having but little time to fpare to 
the fafhionable avocations of a watering-place, they are very 
diligent during their ftay, and are often known to fwallow 

three 

erne againft efcaping the infection ; and then there are only five chances in 
' favour of a perfon efcaping with life. - The whole chances in his favour* 
therefore, are but five and one-fortieth, or fix at moft ; whereas, by authen- 
tic accounts of fome late general inoculations, it appears, that out of 41S 
only one died. On other occafions the proportion has been one in 50c. A 
"ri(k fcarcely to be accounted for, when we confider what different conrti- 
tuf ions muft exift among fuch a number of patients, and the ftrong proba- 
bility of the death of fully that number, among fo many infants, from other 
difordcrs, if inoculation had been entirely out of the question. See an ad- 
mirable Sermon on the Lawftiinefs of Inoculation, by G. Gregory, F. A. S. 
author of Effays Hiftorical and Moral. 

A furgcon in the north, prefuming that felf-intereft has a ftronger hold on 
man than fuperftition, has lately opened a policy of infurance for the fmall- 
pox ! If a fubferiber gives him two guineas for inoculating his child, the 
furgeon, in the event of the child's death, pays ten guineas to the parent. 
For every guinea fubferibed, four guineas ; for one half guinea, Criro gui- 
neas ; and for a crown, one guinea.

Roads and Bridges. — The poft-road, as far as it extends 
through this parilh, is kept in excellent repair. The roads 
leading to the inland parts of the country, being lefs attend- 
ed to, are not in fuch good order. The propofed eftablilh- 
ment of turnpikes muft contribute much to the general 
improvement of this country. If the line is adhered to, 
which is already marked out in the furveyor's plan, the 
new road from Banff to TurrefF, though not much fhortened 
in point of diftance, will oft beguile the traveller of hit 
time, by the varied and beautiful fcenery which will occu 
py his attention. 

The former fine bridge over the Doveran was fwept a- 
way by a violent flood in 1768. Another has frnce been 
built, at the expence of Government, a little higher up the 
river, where it is fuppofed to be lefs in danger from the rife 
of the water. It is a handfome ftru&amp;ure, confuting of feven

Harbour and Shipping. — Of old, boats and trading veffels 
lay within the river, extending along the banks where the 
bulwark now is.

1625, weftward of the river mouth. The attempt was fre-

Banff, and reported, " That the trade appeared for years paft to increafe:

N. B. The great increafe in the quantity of coals imported 
in the year 1796, was occafioned by the demands front 
the country, where peat, the ufual fuel, had been much 
deftroyed by the rains of that feafon. 



Salmon fijhing — The Doveran is richly ftored with fal- 
mon and trout, and yields a very handfome revenue to the 
principal proprietor, the Earl of Fife. 

In the year 1757, the late Lord Fife entered into con- 
tract with a gentleman in Aberdeen, by which he fold the 
frefh falmon of the Doveran, from 29th September to 15th 
May, at three halfpence a pound. The pound of falmon 
now generally fells at fixpence, and early in the feafon at 
nine-pence.

Provoft Robinfon has long enjoyed the leafe of the fifti- 
ings, and generally employs from 80 to 100 men in the dif- 
ferent departments of the trade. 

The fifhing commences 30th November, and is given up 
29th September. 

The various expences attending the fifhing amount to a 
fum at leaft double of the yearly rent. 

The cruives are about a mile from the fea, and the whole 
extent of the river-fifhing, including its windings, does not 
much exceed four miles *. 

Manufaftures 

* The prcfervation of falmon feems very early to have attracted the at- 
I tention of the Legiflature. Alexander II. anno 11 14, enacted at Perth, 
1 upon Thurfday, " the feaft of St Margaret, that theftream lhallin all parts 
I " be fwo (fo) free, that ane fwine of the age of three years, well fed, 
I " may turn himfelf within the ftream round about, fwo that his fnout nor 
I " tail mall not touch the bank or fide of the water." Hence, probably, 
1 the firft conltruction of the cruives in Scotland. 

The falmon is faid to breed or call his fpawn in moft rivers in the month 
I of Auguft. They depofit their eggs or fpawn in a fafe place, in the gra- 
H vel, and then leave it to their Creator's protection. Sir Francis Bacon ob- 
I ferves, " the age of a falmon exceeds not ten years. His growth is very 
H " fudden, fo that after he has got into the fca, he becomes from a famlet, 
■ " not fo big as a gudgeon, to be a falmon, in as fliort a time as a gofling 
I M becomes a goofe." ,

ManufaEiures. — The thread and linen inanufa&amp;ures were 
carried on here, a few years ago, to a very great extent. 

For the thread manufacture alone 3500 mats of Dutch 
flax were annually imported ; which, at an average of L. 3, 
5 s. each, coft upwards of L. 1 1,000 Sterling. The opera- 
tion of milling aqd heckling employed about 60 men. 
When giyen out to fpin, it afforded employment for 4000 
individuals; yielded 150,000 fpindles of yarn, which ch 
culatetl about L. 1.0,000 among the fpinners. The doubling 
apd twifting the yarn, which was done in Banff, employed 
ybout 200 women and children, and at the bleach field, 
engaged the labour and attention of 40 people more. Thefe 
threads, when lent to Nottingham or Leicefter, were valued 
at L. 30,000 Sterling. 

This productive and ufeful branch has fince given place ■ 
to the flocking manufacture, which is alfo conducted on a . 
ytty extenliye fcale by Meffrs Robinfons. 

The ltockings are wove ou a highly improved frame, of 
which thefe gentlemen are the lole patentees. 

They have 150 of thefe frames, for the manufacturing 
of filk, cotton, and worfted ftockings. From the nature of . 
the work, and the advanced ftace of the mechanical arts, , 
which has neceflarily abridged human labour, this manu- 
facture does not offer employment to fuch numbers as the 
branch formerly mentioned. In the feveral departments of i 
the work, however, about 560 perfons of different defcrip- • 
tions are conftantly engaged. 

Young 1 

It is a curious circumftance, and perhaps but little known, that the chief 
ebtifumption of pickled falmon, when firft in feafon, and when prices are 
high, is by the loweft daftes of the people in London. The middle ranks, 
and thofe immediately above them, abflain generally from fnch indulgen- 
ces until the prices are moderate. See an admirable treatife on the Police 
of the Metropolis, by P. Colquhoun, Efq; L. L. D. late Provoft of Glas- 
gow, and now one of the lUiigiftratcs of the Police for London. 



of Banff. 357 



Young men, from 14 to 16 years of age, will fometimes 
make 40 pairs worfted (lockings in one week, and at the 
ufual hours allotted to labour. Thefe ftockings generally 
fell at 3 s. 6 d. a pair. 

The medium gain of the frame-worker may amount to 
1 s. 6 d. or 8 s. a week. 

The worfted is chiefly fpun on the two-handed Leicefter- 
flaire wheel. 

A woman who is a diligent and capable fpinner, will 
earn from 5 s. to 6 s. weekly. The average gains are from 
3 s. 6 d. to 3 s. 

A confiderable quantity of the ftockings are difpofed of 
in wholefale, to the ftiopkeepers in the town and country . 
but the principal market for the manufacture is London. 

The linen trade is ftill continued, though on a more con- 
traded fcale than formerly. This branch may now employ 
about 2c weavers. 

Soap and Candles. — A foap and candle work, belonging 
to a company in Banff, employs a manager and four men, 
and pays annually to Government L. 5 .10 Steiling. 

Brewery. — The brewing of ale, beer, and porter, is car- 
ried on here to a confiderable extent. The annual confump- 
tion of barley is generally 1200 bolls ; and the duty to Go- 
vernment L. 700. The number of hands employed amount 
to eight. The ftrong beer has long been in high repute, 
and in great demand, from various and diftant parts of the 
country. The porter, when kept in bottle about a year, 
is fufficien ly palatable, and has beeen known fometimes 
to deceive the tafte of a connoilTeur in that wholefome be- 
veridge.

A Rope and Sail Manuj'ablure has for fame time been car-

Brick and Tile Work. — The late Dr Saunders of this 
place, a gentleman of 'enterprifing fpirit, eftablifhed, feve- 
ral years ago, a brick and tile work on his farm, about two 
miles from the town. It is ftill carried on with fuccefs, 
(and on an extenfive plan), by his fon. The work poffefles 
great advantages from its local fituation, having the com- 
mand of a fmall harbour for the importation of coals, and 
for exporting part of the produce of the manufacture. Mr 
Saunders generally employs eight or nine men, befides an 
overfeer. 

A brickwork on a fmaller fcale has lately been fet on, 
foot in the vicinty of the town. 

In the various branches of mechanical induftry, this town 
can boaft of feveral eminent workmen ; but on this article 
the limits of a Statiftical Report do not allow of a minute

Markets. — There is a regular weekly market. It is held 
on Friday, and is well fupplied with provifions of all kinds. 
There are alfo in Banff three annual fairs. 

Pojl-Ojfice. — The revenue arifing from the Poll-Office 
has increaled fince the eftablifhment of a daily mail. Ic 
amounts to nearly L. 8op per annum.

Battery. — During the late war, a fmall battery was eredt- 
cd on the high ground near the harbour. It is nearly of 
the half-moon conftruction, with turf embrafures *, and 
mounts two 18 pounders, and four 12 pounders, belides two 
field pieces. 

On one fide of the gateway is fituated the ftore-houfe 
and powder-magazine, on the other a guard-room and ofli- 
cer's apartment. 

Having an extenfive command of the bay, this battery 
might afford protection againft the depredations of a fingle 
privateer •, but whether fuch works, chinly fcattered along 
the coaft, would prove of fubftantial fervice in the event of 
invafion, is a point fomewhat problematical -j-.

" Defence of Great Britain," &amp;c. obferves, " Indeed it is impoflible to 
" line the coaft of an extenfive country in fuch a manner with batteries, as 
" to protect it from an invading enemy ; for they can be placed in few li- 
«« tuations in which they may not be avoided : and if otherwife, the guns 
" in them are generally fo unwieldy and difficult to travene, that they rhav 
" be approached and ftormed without much danger to the affailants. Bat- 
" terics ought therefore to be erected with great caution, and perhaps on- 
" ly in fituations ftrong by nature, where they may not eafily be furprifed 
" or attacked on the land-fide."

arrangements in this academy were made, and the teachers 
recommended by Dr George Chapman *, formerly rector 
of the Grammar-fchool at Dumfries, and who for fome 
years fuperintended the eftablifliments for education in this 
place. . 

The plan of inftruftion which Dr Chapman laid down 
has been ftriftly adhered to by the different teachers, and 
has anfwered the expectations of all concerned. The femi- 
nary is at prefent in a flourifhing ftate. 

At the annual public examination in Auguft 1797, the

By the care and exertions of the late minifier, a charity 
fchool was founded fome years ago, for the poor children

To obtain the permiffion of unloading, the fhipmafter; 
after the dangers and fatigues of a fea-voyage, has generally 
to encounter, what, to a feaman, is often no lefs perilous 
and fatiguing, the labours of a land journey on horieback. 
Were a deputation granted from the Board of Cuftoms to 
two or more qualified perfons refiding in Banff, to tranfaft 
the neceffary routine of bufinefs, it would certainly tend to 
promote the trade and manufactures of this place, and of the 
country around. The expence attending fuch eftablifhment 
mult be truly inconfiderable, when weighed in the fcale 
with the advantages which would accrue from it. 

A few years ago, we had the profpecl of obtaining fuch 
a deputation ; but, it is believed, a premature and impoli- 
tic conteft, for the emoluments of office, fruftrated the de- 
fign. 

The jarring interefts of contending parties, it is hoped, 
will not in the fame manner interfere, to deprive us of the 
advantages of military barracks. 

The town-council have made an offer of ground for the

fraught with beneficial confequences to the community, as 
well as to the military who may be Rationed in this quar- 
ter. 

Toum-Houfe and Prifort. — Laft feafon were laid the foun- 
dations of a new town-houfe and prifon. The principal 
part of the work is nearly finifhed, and the whole promifes 
to be a mofl fubltantial and commodious building. The 
front of the town-houfe, including the fpire, extends 71 
feet. It contains, on the ground-floor, the fheriff-court 
room, and county record-office. On the fecond flat, are 

the

the town-council room and town-clerk's office. The third 
flat contains a county hall, 48 feet long, 27 feet in breadth, 
and 18 feet high. In the fame flat of the back buildings, 
are two drawing rooms, 19 feet wide, and 33 feet long. 
On the ground floor of the back buildings are two correc- 
tion houfes, 33 feet long, and t8 feet in breadth. The fe- 
cond flat contains two civil prifons, 19 feet fquare, and two 
criminal cells, 12 feet fquare. 

In the conltruction of the gaol, the judicious improve- 
ments of the benevolent Mr Howard have been attended 
to, in thofe elTential refpe£ls, air, water, and cleanlinefs . 

Farming Society. — The BanfF-fliire Farming Society w 
eflablilhed in the year 1785. This inftitution was defigned 
to forward improvements in agriculture, to reward indu- 
stry, and to produce unanimity and focial intercoufe be-

tual intereft and advantage can never be fo great as when 
they are infeparable. To have alfo under their confidera-

Such are the laudable and profefled defigns of this Society. 
It is compofed of the noblemen, and many of the refpecl- 
able gentlemen, and of the principal farmers, of this county. 

The prefident of the fociety is an honorary member of 
the national " Board- of Agriculture."

have three ftated annual meetings, generally held in the 
MafonHall of Banff. 

Friendly Societies.-— -Bendes St Andrews Lodge of Free 
Mafons, and the Operative Mafon Lodge, there are feveral 
friendly focteties eftabliihed in Banff. 

I. Solomon's Lodge, or the Gardener Friendly Society, 
•was inftituted in April 1778. It confifts of 500 members. 
Their funds are in a •flourifhing ftate. They are poffeffed 
of houfes and lands in the town and vicinity, which yield a 
yearly rent of L. 80 Sterling. To the widows of de- 
cayed brethren, iaft year, they paid upwards of L. 60 Ster- 
ling. 

II. The Grey-flone Friendly Society, was eftablifhed in 
the year 1792. The benefit of this inftitution is not con- 
fined to any particular defcription of perfons or profeffions. 
Their funds, it is believed, are in a progreffive ftate of im-

1638. Sir James Baird, High Sheriff of Banff, was much 
refpc&amp;ed for his abilities, integrity, and addrefs. In 1662 
he received feveral marks of the King's favour ; among 
others, the following honourable declaration and acquittal, 
for acting in the above office during the Ufurpation. 

" Whereas, We are certainly informed, that the office of

" Ufurper, put upon Our lovite Sir James Baird of Auch-

Sir James was einploj'ed by the Duke of Lauderdale, to 
draw up a rational plan for the union of the two kingdoms. 
He accordingly prepared fuch plan, which was fo highly 
approved of, that the King became defirous of carrying it 
into execution ; but it is believed the Duke of Lauderdale, 
Secretary of State for Scotland, was not a fincere friend to 
the meafure *. 

Of the fame family was the celebrated Bayardo, an Ita-

bits a melahcholy infhince of the furious and mifguided zeal 
of ancient times. He was the fon of Mr Sharp, SherifT- 
Glerk of Banff-mirc. His mother was a daughter of the 
Laird of Kininvy. He was born May 1613, in the Caftle 
of Banff. 

He gave early proofs of a fuperior genius, and excelled 
all his fchool-fellows in the rudiments of learing. 

Having completed his courfe of academical ftudy with 
great applaufe, at the Univerfity of Aberdeen, he took the 
degree of Matter of Arts, and was enrolled a Student of • 
Divinity. By the intereft of the Earl of Rothes, to whom- 
he was related, Mr Sharp was elected one of the Profeffors- 
of Philofophy in St Leonard's College, St Andrews, and 
foon after was appointed minifter of Crail. 

In that remarkable divifion of the Prefbyterians into two 
parties, Public Refolutioners and Remonftrators, he efpou- 
fed the caufe of the former. To fueh height were their 
difputes carried, as to induce the contending parties to lay 
their complaints before Oliver Cromwell, the Protector. 

Mr Sharp being chofen Refolutionary agent, on that oc- 
eafion acquitted himfelf with fo much temper and dexteri- 
ty, that Cromwell feemed convinced by the ftrength of his 
arguments, and was fo impreffed with his infinuating rnanr 
ner and addrefs, that he pleafantly obferved to ibme per-- 
fons near him, " This gentleman, to ufe a Scotch phrafe, 
" may well be {tiled Sharp of that Ilk." 

In May 1660, Mr Sharp, at the earned delire of General, 
Monk and the leading Prefbyterians in Scotland, went over 
to King Charles at Breda, to reprefent their condud, and to 
learn his Majefty's difpofition towards them. 

During his abfence, he was chofen Profeffor of Divinity 
in Mary's College, St Andrews ; and before he left London,

the King, as a mark of his royal favour, made him his 
jC napkin for Scotland, with a pennon of L. 200. 

In April 1661, he accompanied the Earl of Glencairn, 
Chancellor, and the Earl of Rothes, Prefident of the Coun- 
cil, to London, to lay before the King an account of the 
plate of affairs in Scotland. 

In a council held at Whitehall foon after, Mr Sharp was 
nominated Archbiflhop of St Andrews. A refolution ha- 
ving been formed to fill up all the other vacant fees, the 
choice of proper perfons was left to the new Archbifhop, 
who, (according to his inveterate enemy Bhhop Burnet), 
afted in this inftance with great moderation. One of his 
mrft official acts, after his preferment to the Archiepifcopal 
jSee, was, obtaining a proclamation prohibiting the meeting 
of clergymen in prefbyteries or other church judicatories, 
until the'Bifhops arranged a plan for their procedure. 

This, and fome other rigorous meafures, raifed againft 
him an hoft of enemies, feveral of whom bound themlelves 
by folemn vow to facrifice him to the fufferings of their 
party. They at length accomplifhed their horrid purpofe 
by affaffination, attended with circumftances of favage bar-

Jn their general conduft they are both " pitiful and cour- 
" teous;" deferving the praife of beneficence to the poor, 
and hofpitality to ltrangers. 

The author of this report has had frequent opportunities 
of remarking their liberal and ready fpirit to do good, and 
their willingnefs to communicate to every judicious and 
difinterefted charity. 

In their attendance on the ordinances of divine inflitution, 
all ranks are highly regular and exemplary. 

Such laudable attention to external obfervances, fo pre- 
valent here, and fo generally remarked in the different 
Statiltical Reports, though not a certain criterion, is at leaft 
a ftrong prefumption, of the exiftence of internal religion 
among us. It is a truth, for the confirmation of which we 
may appeal to living hiflory, and to the conduct of a neigh- 
bouring nation, that the decay of outward forms of worfhip 
precedes the decay of the more M weighty matters of the 
" law, juftice, mercy, faith," and leads to the diffolution of 
all the " charities of father, fon, and brother." 

In our prefent imperfect Itate, there is certain danger of 
religion gliding by degrees from the heart, unlefs invigorat- 
ed by external ordinances, by a due obfervance of the Sab- 
bath, by ftated calls to worlhip, and the falutary influence 
of example. 

That difagreement in religious opinions, which generally 
obtains in every numerous ibciety, is here attended with no 
perfonal hatred, or rancorous animofity. We differ quietly, 
and in general maintain that meeknefs and moderation 
which found reafon approves, and Chriftian charity com- 
mands.

the lower orders of the people, and it is to be feared, they 
are vices not altogether eradicated. 

But though the intemperate are ftill to be feen reeling 
from their nightly revels, and fometimes from their noon- 
day debauch, the ufe of ardent fpirits is not fo common as 
formerly. 

It is apprehended, however, that this partial reformation 
cannot be afcribed fo much to the change of inclination 
in thofe who were addicted to the practice, as to the falutary 
claufes introduced in the late diftillery laws. 

Although the great majority of the people are juftly ac- 
counted confeientious, and honourable in their dealings, 
there are known fome folitary inftances of perfons, who, 
availing themfelves of the ignorance or good nature of a 
neighbour, do not hefitate to over-reach him in a bargain. 

Notwithftanding our excellent eltablilhments for the edu- 
cation of youth, it mud be admitted, that the children of 
the poor are often fullered to follow, without controul, the 
bent of their own inclinations. The truth is, the care, the 
, vigilance, and the example of the parents, are nat always 
exerted to guide their youthful iteps. But this is chiefly to 
be underflood of the profligate poor. 

The violations of certain decorunti occalion too frequent- 
ly to the kirk-feffion a multiplicity of unpleafant difcuffion, 
which might be veiled with more propriety in the hands of 
the civil judge. 

Within thefe few years, one or two inflances of child- 
murder have occurred, although the unhappy mothers have 
hitherto efcaped detection. 

To this atrocious crime there is here no temptation, ari- 
fmg from the feverity of church difcipline. The difgrace 
of public penance has long fince been aboliflhed. The re- 
formation of delinquents is now fought by gentler methods, 
by mjld rebuke and admonition, while the feflion endea-

vour to render thele private vices of individuals, as much 
as poffible, public benefits to the poor. 

Among ranks higher in the fcale of fociety, there is per- 
haps too Uriel a conformity to the fafliionable cuftoms and 
manners of the age ; too much attention to the pleafures of 
the table, and too much of refinement in many things which 
adminiftcr to luxury. 

Although the limits which feparate harmlefs gaiety from 
blameful diflipation are feldom tranfgreffed, a grave mora- 
lift, perhaps, would venture to infinuate, that engagements in 
convivial feftivity are, at fome feafons, too inceflant and too 
laborious. He might even farther allege, that men, not al- ' 
ways contented with a little wine for their ftomach's fake, 
are fometimes perfuaded to increafe the quantity, in order, .1 
perhaps, to " remove the natural referve of their manner, i 
** and give a proper degree of eafe and fpirit to their con- \ 
" verfation." x 

Were honett Mr Umphraville to pafs the winter in this •{ 
northern burgh, he might occafionally have reafon to com- 'j 
plain, that the drawing-rooms, where, in his younger days, 
the ladies and gentlemen were accuftomed to meet each 
other, were.now almoil totally deierted ; and that, amidft 
the boafted refinement of modern manners, the gentlemen 
paid lefs attention to the ladies than they had done jo years S 
ago *. 

In politics, as in religion, there fubfifts among us fome 
difference of opinion, not tinctured, however, with the vi- 
rulence of party fpirit. Here, it is believed, there are 
very few who may be faid to belong to the order of modern - 
Tlluminati, or to the clafs of violent malecontents f .

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2188248">ABERCORN</name>. 



(County and Presbytery of Linlithgow, Synod or 
Lothian and Tweeddale.) 



By the Rev. Hugh Meiklejohn, Mmi/ler.</head> 



<p>Name. 

NOTHING more than probable conjecture can now be 
ftated with refpeft to the etymology and bonification 
of the name of this pariih. — The church and village of 
Abercorn are fituated upon an angular point, and from 60 to 
Bo feet above the level of the fea. At the point, about an 
hundred yards below the church, the Cornie and Midhope 
burns are united, and, after running nearly an hundred 
yards farther, between lands of equal elevation with that 
upon which the church and village are fituated, and which 
approach towards each other fo as to form a beautiful o- 
pening, they fall into the Forth. Aber, or Aeber, is faid 
to figniiy, in the ancient language of the country, the influx

Statiftkal Account 



of a ftream or river, or the point where the influx take* 
place ; and I have been informed that Cornie or Curnig, in 
the fame language, fignifies rotten trees. If this be the im- 
port of thefe words, Abercorn or Abercurnig, according to 
the ancient orthography, fignifies the point at the influx of 
the rivulet or burn of the rotten trees. 

Buchanan has offered a fingular conjecture concerning the 
origin of this name. He fuppofcs it may have been deri. 
ved from the Cornavii, who were placed by Ptolemy in 
Caithnefs and Cornwall. " In hoc traclu, (Cathanefia), 
" Ptolemaeus collocat Cornavios, cujus nominis adhuc vefti- 
" gia quaedam reliant. — Videntur et in media infula, ob- 
" fcura quidem ilia, fed hujus tamen nominis veftigia re- 
" manfifle. Valli enim Severi initium fcribit Beda non 
" procul abeffe a caenobio Aebercurnig, et monafterii qui- 
** dem illic nullum indicium in i Ills locis eft relidtum : ma- 
" net autem non procul illinc femidiruta Duglafliorum arx, 
u Abercornum nomine. Horum autem vocabulorum u- 
u trumque an alterum fit a Kernico corruptum, ledtori di- 
" judicandam relinquo *." It may be prefumed, few readers 
will judge favourably of this fanciful etymology. 

Situation and Extent. — The parifti of Abercorn, fituated' 
on the fouth bank of the Forth, is of a reclanguhr form, 
being in length, from eaft to weft, about four miles, and 
about three in breadth. It is bounded on the eaft, by Dal- . 
meny ; on the fouth, by Kirklifton ; on the fouth-weft, by 
a detached part of Dalmeny and Ecclefmachan ; on the weft, 
by Linlithgow and Camden ; and on the north, by the 
Frith of Forth. The centre of the parifh is twelve miles 
from Edinburgh, and between five and fix from Linlith- 
gow, the county town.

Xkfc p«ftifc exhibits a greater variety of furface 
than is ufualiy fgeo in the Iltme extent, though the nume- 
rous fwellings which produce it do not rife to any great 
height. Two of them only have obtained the appellation 
of bill. Einns Hill, the greater of the two, is fituated to- 
wards the weft end of the parifh. It is arable to the fum- 
mit, and cultivated with advantage for the various fpecies 
of grain, the foil being richer and deeper than in the low 
lands adjacent to it. From its fituation, on the banks of 
the Forth, though of no great altitude, it commands a 
moft extenfive view, along the river, from the Bafs up to Ben 
Lomond, in the immediate vicinity of which it has its fource. 
The other, Prieftinch Hill, in the fouth part of the parifh, 
ftands on an inch or flat, which was probably valuable in 
former times as grafs or meadow land. The height is in- 
confiderable, but as it rifes with a fteep afcent from a nar- 
row bafe, it readily ftrikes the eye. The fummit of it has 
been fortified with a circular wall, the remains of which are 
ftill vifible ; but by whom, or for what purpofe, is altoge- 
ther unknown. 

Rivers. — There is nothing in the parifh which deferves 
the name pf river, though it is plentifully fupplied with, 
imall ftreams. The Lynmill burn feparates it from Dal- 
trneny, on the eaft ; and Blacknefs burn from Carriden, on 
the welt. The Cornie and Midhope burns have their 
fcourfes through the parifh. It may be obferved of all thefe, 
Spat they are fmall rivulets, compared with fome of thofe 
ilreams called burns in Scotland, and that the courfe of none 
ifcf them exceeds three or four miles. 

Soil. — From the variety of furface which has been men- 
tioned, a confiderable variety of foil may be expeded, and 
sjn reality obtains through the parifh ; but of which, from 

Vol. XX. 3 G this

this very circumftance, it is hardly poflible to give any ge». 
neral character. The bottom, confifting of rotten whin,, 
lime-ftone, free-ftone, til], gravel, and fometimes of fand, is . 
as much diverfified as the foil which covers it. Notwith- 
ffcanding thefe circumflances, which wear an unfavourable- 
afpeft to the intelligent farmer, there is no reafon to com*, 
plain of want of fertility, in thofe lands which have bear 
properly cultivated. 

Farming. — There is at prefent but a fmall proportion of 
the parifh employed in railing, grain. Exclufive of the pro- 
prietors, who have generally fome fields in tillage for their 
conveniency, there are only about a dozen of farmers, who 
may employ about 20 ploughs, each drawn by two horfes. 
There muft have been formerly about five times the num- 
ber of farmers. The traces of many of the old farm-houfes 
can ftill be difcerned, and there were others of which no 
veftige remains. There is only one corn-mill at prefent; 
and one on a very fmall fcale would be fufficient for the 
bufinefs which the parifti affords. Formerly, however, 
there were four, the ruins of which are ftill vifible. It is 
probable there was never employment for that numbev. 
When corn-mills were new, every body erected them ; but tj 
the number gradually diminilhed to what experience ihew- 
ed to be neceflary. Farming appears to have met with 
confiderable attention in this parifti at an early period. It 
is not a great many years fince wheat was cultivated even 
in the more fertile diftridls of Scotland. It muft, however, 
have been a ftaplc article with the farmers here nearly two 
hundred years ago ; for a confiderable part of the rents wen- 
paid in wheat in the beginning of the 17th century, as ap- 
pears from decreets of valuation obtained by different heri- 
tors about the year 1630. It would be unneceffary to give 
any particular delineation of the fyftem of farming which is 

putfued 



of Ah er corn, .387 

purfued at prefent. The inftruments of agriculture, the 
method of dreffing the fields for different crops, and the ro- 
tation of cropping them, do not differ in any material re- 
ipeft from what obtains in the various diftri&amp;s of the Lo- 
thians. The drill-hufbandry, and the advantage of green 
and white crops alternately, are fully underftood, and prac- 
tifed as generally as circumftances will admit. 

Draining. — From the variety of furface, and the great 
diverfity of fubftances which form the bottom, draining has 
been experienced to be particularly neceffary here, as in- 
deed it has generally been in the arable diftricls of Scotlandi 
The bufinefs is well underftood, and though much has been 
done, chiefly by the proprietors, much ilill remains. The 
indifpenfable neceffity of draining wet lands appears every 
feafon, when they are in tillage ; but when they are in pa- 
sture, it does not appear in the fame ftriking and for- 
cible point of view. On the contrary, a certain proportion 
of wet land was formerly confidered as advantageous in 
pafture fields. This idea is now jufily exploded by intelli- 
gent farmers ; for though cattle, in the drought of fummer, 
fometimes do. betake themfelv.es to the coarfe grafs which 
grows on marfhy and wet fpots, it is only when the finer 
and more nutritive food on the dry land, which they al- 
ways prefer, becomes fcarce. Such corners, therefore, not 
only injure the beauty of pafture fields, but diminifh theic 
value. As the theory is improved in this particular, a 
correfponding change begins to obtain in practice ; and 
at is probable, the conviction that wet is as injurious to the 
valuable graffes as to corn, will foon extend that care to pa- 
tures, which has hitherto, with few exceptions, been confin- 
ed to lands in tillage. 



Grafs, 



S 38 



Statijlical Account 



Grafs.-~ -Though the whole parifh of Abercorn be arable, 
excepting what is rendered otherwife by planting, fully two. 
thirds of it are in grafs. The richeft crops of grain adorn 
the fields only for a few of the furnmer months, but when 
in grafs, they are covered with verdure through the whole 
year. This feems to be the reafon why noblemen and gen- 
tlemen do not choofe to have the lands in the immediate 
vicinity of their places in tillage, and accounts for fo great 
proportion of this parifh being in grafs. At the fame time, 
it may be obferved, that lands fuitable for pafture, and 
within a convenient diflance of Edinburgh, are nearly of 
the fame value as when under the plough. Some of the 
fields are diftinguifhed both by the quantity and richnefs of 
the. grafs which they produce, and h"ave been faid by intel- 
ligent graziers, though not fo early, to be equal in value, in 
the courfe of the year, to any in North Britain. Thofe 
let are generally employed in feeding beef and mutton for 
the Edinburgh market. They are confidered as too valu- 
able for breeding by thofe to whom profit is the only ob- 
jeft. 

Wood. — The natural beauty of the parifh is greatl; 
heightened by the quantity of land which is planted, and 
the tafte with which it has been done. There is at prcfent 
a confiderable proportion of the whole, perhaps about a 
fixth, covered with wood. From this circumftance, Aber- 
corn naturally ftrikes the eye from the oppofite coaft of 
Fife. Continued plantations, from the vicinity of Queens- 
ferry to Blacknefs, mark the bounds of the parifh, and ex- 
hibit a fcene rich and beautiful to the eye of the obferver, 
TVToft of the fields are furrounded with belts, and thofe which 
are extenfive are ornamented with clumps of various di- 
menfions. On the higheft land in the parifh, formerly the 
moor of Abercorn, the Earl of Hopetoun has a wood of 

very 



of Abercorn. 



389 



•f ery considerable extent. — Near the centre of this wood, a 
ajjoarfe grey ftone, apparently Handing on end, is faid to 
jjiark the place where meetings were held in ancient.times, 
ifind has probably been the witnefs of many tranfactions of 
okrhich there is now no memorial in the world. 

The beauty of thefe plantations is generally rendered ac- 
:eflible and eafily enjoyed, by lawns and alleys Skirted with 
hfubbery, which have been left for the purpofe. Some of 
hem contain all the variety of trees, native and exotic, 
vhich were known in this country at the times they were 
)lanted, and confequently afford an opportunity to the in- 
elligent obferver, of appreciating their merits, and of mark- 
ng the particular foils and expofures which are moft fa- 
vourable to their growth. 

Inclofures. — -From what has already been faid, it may be 
orefumed, that all the lands in this parifh are inclofed. The 
ences, confiding of ftone-walls, of hedges, and frequently of 
)Oth thefe, thus uniting their advantages, are generally 
ood. The hedges have, in fome inftances, fuffered from 
hofe caufes by which they are molt commonly injured. 
Thefe are, the planting trees, in thick hedge-rows, in the 
line with the thorns ; and the allowing the thorns to grow up 
tinto trees, which, however beautiful they may be in this 
tftate, renders them open below, and infufficient as a fence. 
IBoth thefe having been experienced in iome degree, are 
inow correcting, and will be guarded againft in time to 
icome. 

Minerals, Ifc is'c. — The information concerning the mi- 
nerals, &amp;c. in this parilh, mud be very limited, as they 
jhave hitherto been but very partially inveftigated. There 
is excellent free-ftone in different parts of it, capable of be- 
ing worked into the fineft arghitedture, of which the co- 
lumns 



30° Statiftical Account 

Jumns in the front of Hopetoun Houfe exhibit the moft fa, 
tisfadlory evidence. There are likewife very extenfive 
beds of lime-ftone, which is of a fuperior quality. Thefe 
were wrought to a confiderable extent in the beginning oi 
the laft century, and probably at an earlier period. There 
is Teafon to believe Abercorn was formerly the principal, 
market for lime on the banks of the Forth, probably before 
thofe valuable works on the oppofite coaft of Fife com- 
menced, which are now carried on with advantage to fo 
great an extent. It is faid the fortifications of Dunkirk 
were built with lime from Abercorn; and the old people? 
fpeak of the French veffels employed in carrying it. Lime 
continues to be wrought on the eftate of Duddingfton, bui 
only for a land fale. Ten men are ufually employed in 
quarrying and burning it; and about 10,000 bolls are fold:! 
annually. It is fold by the Linlithgow peafe meafure, and j 
at is. per boll. The boll of fhells produces two and ill 
a half, and fometimes very nearly three bolls of flacked 5 1 
lime. 

Hitherto no coal has been wrought in the parifli, this n&amp;jJ 
ceflary article being generally brought from the vicinity of ! 
Borrowftounnefs, which is between five and fix miles diftant. 
It is, however, by no means improbable, that there is coal, par- 
ticularly in the fouth-weft part of the parifli. There are cer- 
tain indications of iron-ftone in different places, and a fmall 
quantity has been gathered along the fhore ; but as it has 
never been wrought, it is impoflible to fay of what quality, 
and in what quantity, it might be found. There is fome- 
thing lingular in the lie or bearing of the metals. The 
dip is frequently fo great, that the ftrata appear almoft per- 
pendicular to the plane of the horizon. Such is the irregu- 
larity, that within the fame field they are often found to 
bear to oppofite points, and frequently contrary to what is 
their ufual bearing along the banks of the Forth, and in- 
deed

deed over the whole iflandi It mould have been mention, 
ed, that fhell-marl has been found in different places, and 
was once wrought, though to no extent. 

Horfes, Cattle, 13c— Horfes, black-cattle, fheep, with all 
the common domcfticated animals, are kept in this parilli. 
Befide thefe, the Earl of Hopetoun has an extenlive park 
well flocked with fallow deer. From what has been al- 
ready dated with refpect to the manner in which the lands 
are occupied, it will readily occur, that no accurate infor- 
mation can be given with regard to the number of each 
kind. This can never be done when grazing obtains in 
any confiderable degree, as the numbers will fluctuate not 
only every feafon, but frequently in the courfe of the fame 
feafon. 

Very laudable exertions have been made to promote the 
improvement of the different kinds of ufeful animals* 
Thofe in the more elevated ftations have very properly 
thought it a duty incumbent upon them,, to bring the molt 
approved breeds within the reach of thofe who have not 
the fame means of fele&amp;ion, wifely judging, that improve- 
ments of this kind mult be gradually made, but that thofe 
will ultimately obtain, which are really advantageous to 
the country. With this view, different fpecies of horfes 
and cattle have been brought from England by the family 
of Hopetoun. The horfes in the neighbourhood are faid to 
have been much improved, by being crofied with a breed, 
of Mr Bakewell's, introduced by Mr. George Henderfon in 
Craigton. The laudable exertions which began to be made 
fome years ago, for improving the breed of llieep, have not 
been without effedl. The value of the wool has been 
doubled, and even tripled, on fome paftures in this partus. 
The advantage of the Edinburgh market, and the richnefe 
©f the grafe, might be fuppofed to make the breed of milch- 
cows,.

cows, and the management of the dairy, objects of great I 
importance. Perhaps neither of thefe have met with that I 
particular attention, in this neighbourhood, which they un- J 
doubtedly deferve. It might be fuppofed, that ' improve- 1 
ment in that which is more or lefs the bufinefs of fo many, I 
and which materially r.ffecls their gain, would not be left 
to accident ; and yet, meliorations in things of this kind 
feem hitherto to have proceeded more from accident than 
any fettled purpofe. To improve the kinds of the ufeful 
animals, or the fpecies of grain which are commonly culti- 
vated, is a work of genuine patriotifm and extenfive bene- \ 
ficence. It is neither confined to place nor time, but fpreads ; 
in proportion to its utility, and is handed down from gene- 
ration to generation. 

Manufatlures. — There is no manufacture or great work 
carried on in the parim of Abercorn. There are, indeed, a 
few tradefmen, fuch as mafons, wrights, fmiths, fhoemakers, 
weavers, tailors, &amp;c; but in fome of thefe branches the num- 
ber is not fufficient for the accommodation of the inhabi- 
tants. There is neither furgeon, writer, nor merchant. The 
houfes in which fpiritous liquors and ale are fold are few ; 
and thefe, kept by fober and refpectable people, do not feem 
to have the injurious effects which alehoufes are general ; y 
faid to produce. 

Price of Labour and Provi/ions. — It is unneceffary to go 
into any detail with regard to the price of labour, as it is 
not materially different from what obtains through the ho- 
thians. The principal proprietors, who employ moft of the 
labourers, do not, perhaps, give the fame high wages which 
are to be procured elfewhere, efpecially at public works ; 
but the receivers are more than compenfatcd, by the affift- 

ance 



of Abercom. 



393 



ance which they regularly receive in their old age, and 
which is generally extended to their widows. From the 
daily intercourfc with Edinburgh, the prices of all kinds of 
provifions are regulated by thofe in the market of the me- 
tropolis, and are very nearly the fame with them. 

Population. — The return from Abercom to Dr Webfter, 
in the year 1755, was 1037 fouls. In the year 1792, a lift, 
completely accurate, was made up, in the courfe of parochial 
duty, by the writer of this account, and with a view to it, 
when the number was 870 ; and he has no reafon to think 
there is any confiderable alteration fince that time. There 
has, therefore, been a decreafe of 167 in the courfe of the 
laft 40 years. The regifter of baptifms begins fo far back 
as the ift of November 1585, and, though not complete, 
has been kept with tolerable regularity fince that time. 
From 1586 to 1592, both inclufive, the annual average is 
25. The average of ten years has been taken at many 
different periods, and is found to have been higheft towards 
the end of the laft century, being then nearly 39. Since that 
time it has gradually decreafed; fo that the average of the 
laft ten years wants a fraction of 20. Judging, therefore, 
from the evidence which the regifter of baptifms affords, 
the population of the parilh gradually increafed till towards 
the end of the laft century, being then above i6co ; fince 
which it has decfeafed nearly one half. There is no regi- 
fter of deaths before the beginning of the prefent century.

Property. — The whole parifli is valued at L. 6945, 3 s. 
Scotch, and is divided among four heritors. 

1. The Right Honourable James, third Earl of Hope- 
toun, &amp;c. one of whofe anceftors, John Hope of Hopetoun, 
purchafed the barony of Abercorn from Sir Walter Seton 
in 1678 ; and the family, at fubfequent periods, acquired 
Meidhope, formerly the property of the Earls of Linlith- 
gow, one of whom lived in the houfe of Meidhope in the 
beginning of this century, Philpfton, Stonehill, and Morton, 
formerly belonging to branches of the Houfe of Dundas* 
Duntarvie, for near two centuries a feat of the Durhams ; 
Craigton, and other lands in the parifh ; fo that his Lord- 
fhip's valued rent now is about two-thirds of the whole, being 
L. 4586, 6 s. Scots. 

2. David Dundas of Duddingftone, defcended from a 
younger fon of the Houfe of Dundas, who had originally the 
fmall farm of Prieltinch, and acquired the lands of Dud. 
dingftone by marriage, about the year 1530. Mr Dundas's 
lands are valued at L. 1416 Scots. 

3. Sir James Daly ell of Binns, defcended from Thomas 
Daly ell, who acquired the lands of Binns towards the end 
of the 16th century ; and whofe eftate in this parifli is va- 
lued at L. 733, 7 s. Scots. 

Thomas Dalyell of Binns, one of Sir James's anceftorc, 
was born in the parifh of Abercorn, his name occurring ire 

the 



of Abercorn.

the regifter of baptifms in the year 1615. He was com- 
mander in chief of the forces in Scotland, diftinguiihed by 
great fidelity to his King, and is recorded to have had many 
peculiarities of charader. He died on the 22d of Auguft 
J68J. See Grainger's Biographical Hiftory. 

4. James Dundas of Dundas, a minor, and chief of the 
ancient family of Dundas, has a fmall property in this pa- 
rifh, valued at L. 209, 10 s. Scots. His extenfive eftate of 
Dundas lies in the neighbouring parifhes of Dalmeny and 
Kirkliftoun. 

Church, &amp;c. — There is no place of worfhip within the 
parifh but the parochial church, which is attended by the 
great body of the inhabitants. The only diflenters be- 
long to the Burgher and Antiburgher focieties. Though 
they continue a connection which was formed by their fa- 
thers, and in which they were educated, it is but juftice to 
ftate, that they difcover nothing of the narrow prejudice 
and animofity which were but too apparent in the earlier 
periods of the feceffion. The parifli-church, remarkable 
for the beauty of its fituation, is an irregular building, fome 
part of which exhibits marks of considerable antiquity. 
The Earl of Hopetoun is patron. The minifter's flipend, 
as recently augmented, confifts of 64 bolls 2 pecks 2 lippies 
meal, 60 bolls 1 lippie barley, 4 bolls 2 pecks 2 lippies 
wheat, L. 49 : 16 : 5 Sterling of money flipend, L. 5, 17 5. 
3^ d. Sterling for providing communion-elements, with 
the ufual accommodations of manfe, offices, garden and 
glebe. The prefent incumbent was ordained and admitted 
minifter of the pariffi in the year 1 791. 

School — The parochial fchool is the only place of educa- 
tion. From the ability and very uncommon afliduity 
which have long been exerted by Mr Robert Murray the 
fchoolmafter, it has grown into high reputation, which is 

evident 



39 6 Statiftkal Account 



evident from the numbers who refort to it from ali parts of 
the country, many of them from a great diftancc. Nor is 
this preference ill founded ; for there are undoubtedly few 
fchools in which that education which prepares for bufinefs 
is better conducted, or with greater fuccefs. The whole of 
Mr Murray's emoluments, excepting the fchool-wages, 
amount to about L. 10 Sterling, which is made up of his 
falary, fees as feffion-clerk, and the intereft of L. 52 Ster- 
ling mortified for behoof of the fchoolmafter. Experience 
begins to fhew very forcibly, though happily not yet in 
this parifh, that the advantage which the youth of Scotland 
have long enjoyed, in point of education, will foon be loft, 
unlefs more adequate provifion be made for one of the moft 
ufeful claffes of men in the community. 

Poor. — The poor are chiefly fupported by the contribu. 
tions at the church-doors, which, with L. 9, 18 s. Sterling, 
the intereft of money belonging to them, have annualy ave- 
raged nearly L. 115 Sterling for thefe fix years. Such li- 
beral contributions can only be accqunted for from the very 
regular and exemplary attendance upon public worfliip of 
thofe in the higher ranks, particularly of the Hopetoun fa- 
mily. An annual distribution of meal has been made by 
the lame family, for a very long ,period, to the extent of 
feveral chalders. With fuch fupplies, it may be concluded, 
that there are few, if any parifhes, in which the hardships 
of poverty are fo much alleviated. 

Hopetoun Houfe, — The principal feat of the noble family 
of Hopetoun, cannot be palled over in the account of a pa- 
rifh, of which it is the greateft ornament. It is faid the fine 
Situation occurred very accidentally to Charles, firft Earl of 
Hopetoun, when he was going to build on another part of 
the eftate. The building commenced in the year 1696, un- 
der 



of Abercorn. 397 

der the direftion of Sir William Bruce of Kinrofs. Mi- 
Adam afterwards took up the plan, and completed it in 
the time of the fecond Earl. Confidering the wealth 
which has been employed, in the courfe of a century, and 
under the direction of excellent tafte, in beautifying a place 
pofleffed of fo many natural advantages, it is not wonderful 
the refult mould be general admiration. I forbear giving 
a detailed defcription of this princely feat, which is viiited. 
by all thofe who travel through Scotland, and fully celebrat- 
ed by every itinerant bookmaker. 

Ahercorn EJlate. — Abercorn appears to have been always 
a principal eflate in Linlithgowfhire. The flieriffmip of 
the mire belonged to it previous to the paffing of the jurif- 
dicrion aft. In the 13th century it belonged to the Gra- 
hams. Sir John Graham of Abercorn, the friend of Wal- 
lace, fell in the vicinity of Falkirk, righting for the liberties 
of his country againft Edward I. of England, on the 2 2d of 
July 1298. Since that time it has belonged to feveral 
noble and diftinguiflied families, the Douglaffes, Mures, 
Lindfays, and Setons, from whom it came to one of the 
anceftors of the prefent proprietor, as formerly mention- 
ed. Its extent was greatly diminilhed when fold by Sir 
Walter Seton ; but it has regained its original importance in 
the pofiefiion cf the family of Hopetoun. An authentic 
hiftory of fuch an eftate, for a long period, would be a cu- 
rious and interefting work, exhibiting its tranfitions from 
family to family, and the additions and diminutions which 
it experienced, according to the rife and fall of the fortunes 
of its poffeflbrs. 

Abercorn Wall. — The wall built by the Romans in the 
time of Antoninus, between the Friths of Forth and Clyde, 
has been called by fome hiftorians the Wall of Abercorn. 

It 



398 



Statifikal Account 



It is, however, more than probable this wall never extend-' 
ed to Abercom. The authority of the venerable Bede 
when we recolledr the age in which he lived, and the op. 
portimity of knowledge which, as a Northumbrian, he pof. 
fefled, has not been l'ufiiciently attended to upon this point, 
concerning which there has been confiderable inveftigation. 
" Incipit autem duorum ferme millium fpatio a Monafte-' 
V rio Aebercurnig ad occidentem, in loco qui fermone Pic- 
" torum Peanuahel, lingua autem Anglorum Penueltum 
" appellatur, et tendens contra occidentem, terminatur 
" juxta urbem Alcluith." Bed. Ecclcf. Hift. Gent. Angl. 
lib. i. cap. xii. The name given by both nations to the 
place where the wall began, implies a point, and the point 
of Blacknefs is precifely the diftance mentioned from the 1 
church of Abercorn, where, it is underftocd, the monaftery 
was fituated. 



Monajlery, ifc — The monaftery of Abercorn was one 
of the mod ancient in Scotland. It is feveral times men- 
tioned by Bede, though he gives no particular account ofj| 
it. Towards the end of the feventh century, it was the 
refidence of a bifhop Triumvin. At this period the terri 
tory of the Northumbrians extended to the Frith of Forth j 
but in the year 684, TEgfrid their king was defeated ant 
flain by the Picls, on which Triumvin left Abercorn * ; and 
from that time it is uncertain whether the monaftery con- 
tinued, as there feems to be nothing recorded in hiftory 
with refpecl: to it. To this old religious eftablifhment we 
muft refer the names of many places in the parifh, fuch as 
Prieftinch, St Serf's Law, Priefl's Folly, &amp;c. &amp;c. 

About the year 11 70, a difpute arofe concerning the pa- 
tronage of the church of Abercorn, between John Avenale, 

or 

# 3ed. HLft. lib. 4. cap. xsvi. 



ofAbercorn. 399 

or Avonale, Lord ofAbercorn, and Richard, fecond Bifhop 
of Dunkeld. The latter fucceeded, as was to be expected 
in thefe times of increafing church power. In the year 
1460, the whole lands belonging to the Bifhop of Dunkeld 
©n the fouth fide of the Forth, confifting of Abercorn, Cra- 
mond, Prefton, and Aberlady, were ere&amp;ed into one baro- 
ny, to be called the barony of Aberlady. 

Cajlk of Abercorn. — The Romans had ftations or forts, 
at equal diftances, between Antoninus's Wall and Cramond, 
the port which they frequented in the Forth, to preferve 
the communication, and to prevent the enemy from ma- 
king inroads, by croffing from the oppofite fhore. One of 
thefe was probably the original of Abercorn Caftle. There 
feems to have been another at Springfield, the remains., of 
which were lately employed in building the prefent houfe 
and offices, and another on the point of Munch Hill. The 
caftle was fituated on a point north-eaft from the church of 
Abercorn, and mult have been of difficult accefs, excepting 
on the eaft fide. During the power of the Houfe of Dou- 
glas it became a place of great ftrength, being one of the 
mod tenable fortrefles which belonged to the family. In 
the year 1454 it was befieged by King James II. the Earl 
of Douglas being then in rebellion. The King raifed the 
fiege, and went in purfuit of Douglas ; but it was recom- 
menced on the 8th of April 1455, anQ " the walls of the caftle 
being fhattered by the repeated fhocks of machines, it was 
taken by ftorm about the 8th of May following, and difmant- 
led. It was never repaired afterwards. Buchanan fpeaks of 
it as half demolilhed (lemidiruta arx) in his time. 

CharaEier of the People. — There is nothing particularly 
ftriking in the appearance or manners of the people of 
Abercorn. They are peaceable, fober, induftrious, and re- 
gular, 



4oo 



Statiftical Account 



gular, in an eminent degree. Lefs addicted to violent dif. j 
putation concerning the doctrines of Chriftianity than the I 
people in many parishes of Scotland, they have much more* 
of the practice of it. A better teftimony cannot be given* 
to the regularity of their condutt, than by dating, that a 
considerable number of years fometimes elapfes without! 
any individual being Subject to the cenfures of the church, . 
Perhaps there is no parilh, the inhabitants of which give : 
lefs uneafinefs and difquietude to their minifter. Though 
by no means in a fequeftered Situation, they are removed i j 
from the immediate taint of that liccntioufnefs which de- 
ftroys the lower orders in cities and great towns. They 
have not Suffered from the eftablifhment of manufactories or rj 
great works, there being none either within the parifh, or: 
in the immediate neighbourhood of it. While thefe have : 
enriched many diftrifts of Scotland, they have had the moft 1 
fatal influence upon the characters of the people. Thofe • 
who have enlarged views of their country's good, will not t 
rejoice in the acquifition of wealth, when it is accompanied : 
with the Sacrifice of the religious principles and moral con- - 
du£t of the inhabitants. It is not eafy to conceive how 
much the manners of the common people depend upon the 
higher orders who live among them, When the members  
of a great family are decent, regular, and uniform in their 
attendance upon the ordinances of religion, the benefit of 
the example is not confined to their domeftics, but extends 
further than any other kind of influence which they poffels. 
The parifh of Abercorn enjoys the full advantage of fuch i 
example, and it is obviotvfly productive of the moft Salutary t ! 
effects.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2570940">KILMORACK</name>. 



(County of Inverness, Synod of Ross, Presbytery 
• of Dingwall.) 



By the Rate. John Fraser.</head> 



<p>Origin of the Name. 

LIKE many other parifhes in the Highlands of Scot- 
land, this derives its name from having afforded bu- 
rial ground, either to fome reputed faint, or fome perfon of 
diftincfion ; Cill Mhorac lignifying the Cell or Chapel of 
Young Mary ; but from what family this lady fprung, can- 
not with certainty be afcertained, though it feems mod like- 
ly fhe was a defcendant of one of the Lairds of Chiiholm, 
who, long before the Reformation, was the principal reli- 
ding heritor in the parifli, and whofe family ftill continue 
to bury in it. 

Situation and Extent. — There is not probably in Scotland 
a parifh of greater extent, ftretching from Tarradale, (to 
Vol. XX: 3 E- the 



4^2 



Statiflical Account 



the eaftward of the village of Beauly), in a direction pretty 
nearly from caft to weft, till within a Ihort diftance of the , 
Cro of Kintail ; a tract of ground upwards of 60 miles in iJ 
length, by 10, 20, and even 30, in fome places, in breadth, j 
On the fouth, it is bounded by the Frith of Beauly, the pa- j 
rillies of Kirkhill- and Kiltarlity \ on the north and- eaft, by J 
the parifhes of Urray and Contin ; and on the weft, by the ji 

parilhes of Cro and Lochaiih. 

■ 

General /Ippccirancc. — From the account given above o£'( 
the extent of this parifti, it will naturally be fuppofed that 
its appearance cannot be very regular ; but though this muft- 
be allowed, the general face of the country it contains is 
very far from being unpleafant. At the eaftern extremity v 
we behold the Frith and the beautiful windings of the 
Beauly, extenfive fertile corn-fields, and feveral gentlemens 
feats, many of them highly improved. Here moft of the 
barren ground, and the hills almoft to their fummits, are co- 
vered with large plantations of Scotch fir, and a variety of 
natural wood. A few miles to the weft of Beauly, the 
traveller fees, what has ofcen been admired by the man of J 
tafte, the Falls of Kilmorack and Teanaffie, the pi£turefque 
icenes in the DreUm, and the ifland of Aigafti ; at one end . 
of which may be viewed, from the public road, three faw- 
mills, conftantly at work, furrounded with as romantick 
and delightful a fcenery as is to be met with in Scotland. 
Even in the remoteft parts of the parifti, bills and rocks of 
a very confiderable height appear, clothed and adorned 
from top to bottom with a variety of trees, Scotch fir, birch, 
common and mountain afh, poplars, fome oaks, hazel, &amp;c. 
&amp;c. 

Rivers. — The principal river is the Beauly, compofed of 
three lefler ones, the Farrur, Canich, and Glafs, that give 

names 




of Kilmorack. 4^ 

■names to as many glens ; thefe rivers interfeft the parifli in 
different direftions, at their conflux below Erklefs Caftle, 
the feat of Mr Chifkolrn-of Chiflxolm ; they form the Beau- 
ly, which runs about eight miles before it difcharges itielf 
into the Frith of that name, at the mod eafterly point of the 
parifh. This river, from the Frith to Beaufort Cattle, 
abounds in falmon, and the harveft floods fometimes enable 
a. few to get over the Falls of Kilmorack, and then they can 
with eafe fvvim upwards more than 20 miles, even to the 
•head of the Farrur, and a great way up the Glafs ; but this 
feldom happens, and the number is commonly fo trifling, 
that the proprietor very properly thinks, the value would 
jiot indemnify the expence and trouble that would attend 
the killing of them. A little below the Falls of Kilmo- 
rack is a ftream reckoned among the beft in Scotland for 
angling falmon ; from 20 to 30 have often been taken by 
one perfon in the courfe of a day. 

The late Lord Lovat, who, with pleafure, often vifked 
thefe Falls, once made a very uncommon and furprifing ex- 
periment. Alongfide one of them he ordered a kettle full of 
water to be placed over a fire, and a few minutes after, a 
large falmon leaped into it. Fabulous and incredible as this 
.may feem to thofe who never were at Kilmorack, it is what 
would undoubtedly fiappen a hundred times every feafon, 
were the experiment tried. In the months of July and-Au- 
guil, many .fifli lie at the foot of thefe Falls ; when a 
flood comes they all endeavour to get up the river, but as 
. the water in which they fwim is conftantly agitated and 
frothy, on account of the height from which it falls, they 
cannot fee before them, often miftake their direction, and 
leap on the dry rock. It is therefore a common praftice 
with the people , in the neighbourhood, to lay branches of 
trees along the fide of the ftream, to prevent the fiih tum- 
bling back into the .river. Twenty falmon, by thefe means, 

have 



Stntiftical Account 



have often in a morning been taken on the dry rock. Were j 
a kettle therefore fet a boiling where thefe branches are 
laid, a fifh, by accident, might plunge into it, as foon as 
tumble on any part of the furrounding rock. The falmon 
fifning of the Beauly is the fole property of the Honourable 
Mr Frafer of Lovat. For years part it has been let in leafe to 
John Richardlbn, Elq; of Pitfonr, near Perth, at upwards of 
L. 600 Sterling per annum. This gentleman, when he firft 
rented the fifliing, was but little known, and almoft an e*| 
tire ft ranger in this country ; but his obliging and engaging 
manners foon conciliated the good will and affe&amp;ion of all 
ranks of people in it. His laudable and amiable character^; 
fo generally known, and fo well eftablifhed, ought not tdl 
be mentioned but with approbation ; and the prefent irfil 
cumbent of this parifh cannot forbear, in this public roanVl 
ner, giving his teftimony to it. Mr FJ.chardfon has repeat^ i 
edly laid the parifhioners of Kilmorack, particularly the 
poor, under the greateft obligations. But his beneficence,! 
liberal, and well-timed charity to them, in the years 1781 
and 1783, will not be forgotten. They never fail, however, 
to make their kind benefactor the only return in their 
power, and what to him will be preferable to filver or gold, 
their fincereft wifh that the Welling c£ the needy, and thofe 
who were then ready to perifh, may come upon him. 

Laics. — -\n every diftrift of this extenfive parifli, from the ! 
village of Beauly upwards, even in the higheft hills, there are 
lakes, all plentifully flored with pike and trout. But there 
is one of them which deferves to be particularly remark- 
ed, on account of its being probably the only pheno- 
menon of the kind in Great- Britain. The name of this 
lake is Lochan Uain, or the Green Lake ; it is on the Chif- 
hblm's property, about 40 miles to the weft of Beauly, fur- 
rOunded by mountains as high as any in Scotland : The moft 
* foutherly 



of Kilmorack. 



405 



foutherly of thefe, and the higheft, is called Maum Shou- 
dhil. This lake is conftantly, both in fummer and winter, 
covered with ice j but in the middle of June, when the fun 
is vertical, a very little of the ice in the centre of the lake is 
diffolved. 

Climate. — In no refpe£t has this country undergone a 
greater change than as to climate. About 20 years ago, 
the farmers, without a coat upon them, were obliged to yoke 
their labouring cattle, even in the month of March, about 
three or four o'clock in the morning, as neither the plo:i; h- 
man nor cattle could ftand the heat of the day after fix or fe- 
ven. But how great the reverfe ; no fight more common 
now, in the latter end of April, and beginning of May, than 
a ploughman, with his body wrapt up in a great coat, and 
his hands muffled in worfted mitts, to preferve him from the 
frofty air. Showers of fnow and hail are not unufual in 
June, not even in the dog-days ; but though pur feafons 
have thus varied, we have upon the whole lefs frofl: and 
fnow throughout the year than formerly. 

Crops. — Otas, barley, peafe, rye, and fome wheat, are 
the crops generally raifed ; but the parilh, particularly the 
Highland part of it,' reaps more benefit from the culture of 
potatoes than from all the other crops. The great advan- 
tage accruing to Highlanders from paying a proper attention 
to the cultivation of this ufeful root, does not appear, per- 
haps, in any other part of the country, in a more ftriking 
and convincing point of view than in the parifh of Kilmo- 
rack. Within thefe 20 years, the Laird of Chifholm's te- 
nants, in the height of Strathglafs, were in the conftant 
practice of purchafing yearly oat-meal to the amount of 
about L. 500 ; but during the 12 or 14 years laft paft, they 
have paid fo much attention to their potatoe 1 crop, that they 

are 



406 



Statijlical Account 



are not under the neceffity of laying out L. 5 in the yeat 
for meal. New experiments are frequently made in the 
culture of potatoes, and many of them have (ucce^ded he- 
yond expectation. The prefent incumbent has had 11 fu C . 
ceffive crops from one field without a particle of manure, 
and all, except the laft, equally good. He has now the fa- 
tisfaction to fee many of his parifhioners following his ex- 
ample. The potatoes thus raifcd are, in number and fize, 
at leaft equal, and in quality far fuperior, to thofe laid down 
with the richeft manure. To the Honourable Prefident of 
the Board of Agriculture, his country, and all Europe, are 
indebted for his difinterefted and unwearied application, in 
endeavouring to promote whatever may tend to the good 
and profperity of mankind. The Highlanders of Scotland, 
from the attention he has hitherto been pleafed to pay 
them, have every reafon to expect, that he, and the Honour, 
able Board at which he prefides, will continue to embrace 
every opportunity of pointing out to them the mode belt 
-calculated for improving .the little field they have to go 
upon. 

Prices of Provi/ions and Labour.—- In this parifli there is 
no public market fqr provifions, of courfe, their price, or 
that of grain, cannot with any degree of certainty he afcer- 
tained. Meal generally fells from 16 s. to 20 s. per boll ; 
barley, from 20 s. to 25 s. per ditto ; potatoes., from 6 d. to 
8 d. per peck. Moft of the farmers employ hired fervants, 
to whom they pay from L. 3 to L. 5 Sterling of wages ; 
day-labourers receive from 8 d. to is. per day. 

Black Cattle and Sheep — In fuch an extent of country as 
this parifh contains, it is impoffible to afcertain the number 
of cattle. Though there are no fheep-farms, yet almoft 
every perfon who poffeffes a houfe has a few ; a great many 

black

black-cattle are annually fold for the fouth of Scotland and 
Englifli markets.

It is impoffible with any degree of exa£lnefs to afcertain 
the deaths, marriages, or births, in fo extenfive a parifh. 
Of the two former there are no regifters kept ; and there 
are fo many Papifts in the Highland part of it, that even 
the births cannot with any certainty be determined. 

Hints. — The valued rent of this parifh is L. 3810. 
Lovat's, 1830 ; Chifholm's, 1505 ; Struie's, 400; Aigafh, 
75. The real rent has conliderably increafed. By a proven 
rental taken in the year 1729, when the late incumbent 
applied for an augmentation of ftipend, the vidtual rent was 
only 302 bolls 3 firlots ; the money but L. 424 : 7 : 2-^. 
It is now 415 bolls victuals, and about L. 1397 Sterling 
money. 

Ecclejiajlical State of the Pariffj. — Mr Frafer of Lovat is 
patron of the parifh. On the Chifholm's property, in the 
Highland part of it, there are from 600 to 700 Papifts, all 
the reft of the inhabitants are of the Eftabliihed Church. 
There are three places of worfhip, but the incumbent only

preaches in the parifh church. There is a miffionary ap. 
pointed, many years fince, by the Committee for managing 
the Royal Bounty, for this and the neighbouring parifh of 
Kiltarliry. He lias - four different preaching places, in each 
of which he officiates alternately. — The manle was built 
fince the prefent incumbent was fettled, and is ftill in pret- 
ty good repair. — The church is new — In the parilh there 
is both a parochial and Society's fchool. 

ManvfaElures. — The only manufacture carried on in the 
parifh is that of wood. Many thoufand fir-trees are annual- 
ly cut in Lovat's, the Chifholm's, and Suuie's woods. Thefe 
are fawn into fquare timber, planks, deals, &amp;c. for the home 
and Englifh markets. At the village of Beauly there was 
lately launched a vefTel of upwards of 90 tons burden, built 
entirely of this wood and there are at prefent two more 
on the flocks, of at leaft an equal fize with the former. 
Thefe veflels are bought by the mercantile people of In- 
vernefs, and employed by them in the trade from thence to 
London. 

Pcft-Ojfice. — Long after the prefent incumbent was fet- 
tled, a runner was employed by a few gentlemen, to carry 
their newfpapers and letters, three times a-week, from In- 
vernefs, being the neareft poft town. Several years ago, 
Colonel Frafer of Belladrum, a gentleman ever attentive to 
what tends to the general good of the diftricl in which he 
refides, after much folicitation, got a poft-ofHce eftablifhed 
at Beauly, and became himfelf furety for the perfon ap- 
pointed to the management of it. This he did from the moft 
difmterefted motive, receiving all his own poft letters from 
Invernefs. At the commencement of this eftablifhment, it 
was generally thought that the office would not indemnify 
the public in the fmall falary of L. 5 aliened the poft-maUer ; 

but

but the circulation of correfpondence has fo furprifingly in- 
creafed, that the poft-oflice of Beauly returns annually to 
Government upwards of L. 90, clear of all expence. 

Antiquities.— In different parts of the parifh are to be 
feen many Druidical cairns or temples, and the ruins of 
fmall forts, built on the fummits of hills ; but what moft 
attracts the attention of the traveller, is the ruins of the an- 
cient Priory of Beauly. The greater!: part of its walls are 
fti'l (landing. It was founded in the year 1230, by James 
Biflet of Lovat. The terms of its foundation were, " ut 
" pro ipfo, dum viveret, Orarent Monachi ; pod mortem, 
" funus corpufque exciperent, atque animam de corpore 
" abeuntem, per continua facrificia et opera pietatis profe- 
" querentur." His charter is confirmed by Pope Grego- 
ry III. Rom. Julii. Pontificatus fui, anno 4to.

I. Of Dunkeld. 



Name. 

THE name appears to have undergone, in the courfe oS 
ages, a confiderable change. In ancient records it 
is frequently written Dunkelden, and there are ftrong rea- 
fons for believing, that it was alfo written fometimes Dune' 
chcdd, or Durtechalden\. Indeed, from confulting etymolo- 
gy 

* Though Dunkeld and Dowally are now commonly conlidered as form- 
ing one parifh, yet the ftatiftical circumftances of each are fo completely 
different, that it has been thought proper to give an account of them in dif- 
ferent papers, 

f Lord Hailes, in his Annals of Scotland, quotes the following paflage 
from Simeon DunelmenCs : " Ulfum Haroldi quondam regis filium, Dunc- 
chaldumque regis Malcomi filium, efc cuftode laxatos et armis militaribus 
honoratos, abire permifit." Now Malcolm had no fon of the name here 
mentioned ; but his fon Ethelred was abbot of Jiunkeld, and hence, moft 
probably, the appellation, An. of Scot. p. %t. Svo. Edin. 1707. 



of Dunkeld. 



gy, we are led to confider the latter as bearing a clofer re- 
femblance, both in orthography and found, to the words 
from which they are derived, than the former. This is 
equally true, whether, with one clafs of Gaelic etymolo- 
gifts, we confider the name as derived from Lun-ghaeU 
dbun, " the Fortrefs of the Gaels of the Hills," or, with 
another clafs, from Bun-chalden y " the Hill of Hazels." 

Situation. 

Dunkdld is fituated 54 miles north from Edinburgh, in 
the county of Perth, and on the north bank of the river 
Tay. The fcenery which furrounds it has long been a. 
■fubject of admiration, as romantic and delightful. It is one 
of thofe places which every foreign tourift haftens, on his 
arrival in Scotland, to fee, nor does he return difappointed. 
Nature has been liberal in producing and combining fine ob- 
jects in the landfcape, and the improvements of the Duke 
of Atholl, conducted on an extenfive fcale, and with great 
tafte, have given much additional ornament to the whole. 
,It now prefents a variety, and a degree of picturefque beau- 
ty, which is feldom equalled, and is, perhaps, (within the 
fame compafs of ground,) no where furpafied. So often, 
indeed, has that beauty been defcribed and praifed, that ic 
is unneceflary to lengthen this account by defcanting upon 
it. It is impoffible, however, to refill the defire of inferting 
the defcription of one who was an exquilite judge, and who 
has fele&amp;ed, very happily, the objects which give its charms 
to the neighbourhood of Dunkeld. Mr Gray (the poet) 
paid a vifit to the Earl of Strathmore at Glammis Caftle, 
during the fummer of the year 1766. At that time he 
made an excurfion to the Highlands, and he thus exprefles 
himfelf, in a letter addrefied to Mr Walpole, afterwards 
Earl of Orford : « The road came to the brow of a fteep 

defcent, and, (the fun then fetting), between two woods 

" of

" of oak, we faw, far below us, the river Tay come Sweep- 
ing along, at the bottom of a precipice at lead 150 feet 
" deep, clear as glafs, full to the brim, and very rapid in 
" its courfe ; it feem'd to iffue out of woods thick and tall, 
" that rofe on either hand, and were overhung by broken 
" rocky crags of vaft heighth ; above them, to the weft, 
" the tops of higher mountains appeared, on which the 
f e evening clouds repofed. Down by the fide of the river, 
" under the thickeft fhades, is feated the town of Dunkeld: 
" in the midft of itftands a ruin'd cathedral, the towers and 
ff fhell of the building dill entire ; a little beyond it a large 
" houfe of the Duke of Atholl, with its offices and gar- 
V. der: , ext. uds a mile beyond the town; and - as his 
M grounds are uiterfecled by the ftreets and roads, he has I 
M filing arches of communication acrofs them, that add tq \ 
i' the fcenery of the place *." 

Boundaries. 

The boundaries of Dunkeld, viewed as a parilh, are not I 
extenfive, but they are not hitherto diftin&amp;ly afcertained. 
As it was theTeat of the bifhop, and the fervice of the ca- 
thedral was performed either by his chaplain, or by fome 
of the tlergy who had fixed benefices in other quarters of 
the diocefe, it was not neceffary at that time to confticute it 
formally a parifh, and to mark its limits. In facl, it does 
not appear that this was ever done. It is not entered as a 
parifh in the cefs-books of the county, and none of the old 
title-deeds of the proprietors defcribe the property as lying 
within the par but within the city, of Dunkeld. What 
is now therefore the parilh, includes only what was former- 
ly within the boundaries of the city. Thefe, in the courfe 

of 



* Gray's Poems and Memoirs, p. 3. vol, iv, Mafon's edition, 



of Bunkdd. 



of the prefent century, have been confiderably altered ; for 
during the commotions of 16S9, the greateft pare of the 
houfes were burnt by an irritated and licentious foldiery, 
and fuch of them as had flood to the weft and north-weft of 
the cathedral were not rebuilt. The ground which they, 
and the gardens which had lain intermixed with them, oc- 
cupied, is fuppofed to have extended to about five acres, 
and this fpace now forms a part of the Duke of A th oil's 
lawn and policy. But as the boundaries of the town reced- 
ed on one quarter, they ftretched out on another. Several 
new houfes were built on the flope of the eminence which 
rifes to the eaftward of the town. Thefe are uniformly de- 
fcribed in the title-deeds as lying in the parifti of Caputh. 
That parifh indeed completely furrounds Dunkeld, (except 
where it is fkirted on the fouth by the Tay), and in for- 
mer times had reached, it thus appears, clofe to the lite of 
the buildings. Stipend is paid to the minifter of Caputh 
from a piece of ground lying but a few yards from the ca- 
. thedral. 

Population. 

The numbers returned to Dr Webfter, in 1755, were 
1298. By an accurate lift taken in 1789, (and there is no 
reafon to believe that they have either increafed or dimi- 
nifhed materially fince that time), they amounted to 1086 
fouls. Of thefe 589 were males, and 497 were females. 
Though no regular and authentic lift of the births and bu- 
rials has been kept, yet by evidence on which great reliance 
may be placed, the number of the former is calculated to 
be, on an average, 36 annually, and of the latter, 27. Of 
marriages, the average annual number is 9, The propor- 
tion of births thus annually, to the total number of inha- 
bitants, is as I to 3c ; of deaths, as 1 to 40 ; and of marri- 
ages, as 1 to 120. The proportion of births to marriages 



Statijlical Account 



is as i to 4. Of the 36 births annually, there occur in ge- 
neral three inftances of children ftill born, and one inftance 
of twins. 

The inhabitants are not liable to any particular local di- 
ftemper, and many of them arrive at a very advanced age. 
One died a few years ago aged upwards of 100, and a friendly 
company occaiionally met, which was ftyled the Eighty-four 
Club, where no member was admitted till they attained the 
number of years mentioned in the title. In proof of the fitua- 
tion of Dunkeld being healthful, it may be mentioned, that 
it is frequently recommended by phyficians as a fummer 
refidence for their consumptive patients. The oftenfible 
reafon of fuch recommendation, is, no doubt, the opportu- 
nity of obtaining goat-whey *, which it affords. But it is at 
the fame time underftood, that the purity of the air coming 
cleared and frefhened from the hills of the Highlands, toge- 
ther with the comforts of the fociety, and the charms of the 
fcenery, (inducing the invalid to regular and gentle exer- 
cife), form not the leaft powerful and beneficial medicines.

Ecclesiastical State. 

I. Stipend of the Minijler\. — There sre feveral peculia- 
rities in the ftate of the provifion made for the minifter of 
Dunkeld. There is no manfe ; there is no afcertained 
glebe ; there is no allowance for communion-elements, and 
but a fmall pittance, of the very inadequate ftipend, is 
drawn from either Dunkeld or Dowally. 

During feveral years after the Revolution, a chaplain, 
who was employed and paid by the Duke of Atholl, per- 
formed here the fervices of religion to the people ; and it 

was 

* This is the man to whom the following paragraph, in the Scots Mar 
gazine for October 1746, refers, in detailing the trials of the Rebels at Car- 
lifle. " John Ballantine acted as a piper in Captain James Stewart's com- 
pany. But feveral witneffes depofed that he was forced into the fervice 
" by a party of the Rebels, who took him by violence out of his bed, threat- 
" ened to ftab him if he did not go with them, and did not allow him 
*" time even to put on his clothes; and that afterwards they placed a guard 
" over him, to prevent his efcape. When the jury returned their verdict, 
" Not Guilty, the poor fellow was in fuch a tranfport of joy, that he threw 
" his bonnet up to the very roof of the court, and cried, ■ My Lords and 
" Gentlemen, I thank you. Not Guilty! Not Guilty ! Not Guilty! Pray 

God blefs King George for ever ; I'll ferve him all the days of my life 
" and immediately ran out to the caftle-yard with his irons on, took up » 
handful of channel water, and drank his Majefty's health."

was not till the beginning of this century that a regular mi. 
nifter was fettled, and an official ftipend fixed. In 1704 
the Duke made an application to Queen Anne on the fub- 
jeft , in confequence of which, a grant was iffued of the fol- 
lowing tenor : " Confidering, that now the cathedral-church 
u of Dunkcld, wherein was the bifhop's feat, by removing 
" the bilhops from their benefices, is deftitute of a compe- 
** tent ftipend ; whereby the people of that town, and other 
" adjacent inhabitants, are deprived of the Word and Sa- 
" craments : Therefore, as coming in place of the bifhops, 
" and having right to the tithes and emoluments of the 
" church and parilh of Meigle *, do, in our pious and mo- 
" therly care, grant and allocate, as much of the parfonage 
" and vicarage, teinds and feu-duties, as make up a ftipend 
" of 9 chalders of vicinal, or 100 merks for each chalder, 
" if the parfonage teinds do not extend to the faid quota in , 
" victual, over and above the quota fixed for the minifter 
" of Meigle." In confequence of the alternative left in the 
grant, 100 merks for each chalder, was paid to the minifter 
for a confiderable time f. In 174c, the incumbent claim- 
ed 

* Meigle was a nienfiti kirk of the biiriop of Dunkeld, who had a right 
to the whole teinds of the parifh. 

•f It appears, that in 1709, Mr William Chalmers, then minifter of Dun- 
keld, prefented a petition to the General Affembly, ftating the hard/hip of 
his fituation. in having neither manfe nor glebe, and being unable to reco- 
ver the full quota of vidua 1-ftipend allocated on the parilh of Meigle. And the 
Affembly having inquired into the ftatements of the petition, " did humbly 
*' and earneftly beg of his Grace, her Majefty's Commiflioner, that he 
" would interpofe with her Majefty," that the minifter of Dunkeld might 
receive relief. And " his Grace was pleafed kindly to undertake to lay this 
" matter before her Majefty." In 171 5, however, we a fecond peti- 
tion from Mr Chalmers. " Notwithftanding (he fays) the recommenda- 
" tion of the Aflembly, 1709, for an augmentation of ftipend to him, yet

cd the vi&amp;ual, refuting to accede longer to the converfion 
into money. A. long litigation enfued betwixt him and the 
heritors of Meigle ; and the Court of Seffion decreed that 
they fliould pay as follows, L. 26 : 6 : 8 in money, and 45 
bolls 3 iirlots and 2 pecks of oat-meal, and 22 bolls 1 firlot 
and 3f pecks of barley. Befides what was thus payable 
from Meigle, the minifter is entitled to L. 13 Sterling year- 
ly, as one-third of the deanery duties of the cathedral of 
Dtinkelrl, granted, in 1744, to the minifters of Abernyte, 
Dunkeld, and LifF; but of this fum he receives no more 
than L. 8, 14 s. as fome of the lands from which the duties 
Ibould be drawn cannot be traced. Of feu-duties in Dun- 
keld he receives 3 s. 4 d. and of ufe and wont contribution 
from Dowally, L. 8 : 6 : 8. The average amount of the 
ftipend, as made up of thefe particulars, does not exceed 
L. 95 Sterling per annum; a fum furely, in a place from lo- 
cal circumftances uncommonly expenfive, and when there 
is neither manfe, glebe, nor allowance for communion-ele- 
ments, forming but a fcanty provifion. Did the ftate of 
the teinds of Dowally admit of an ample augmentation, the 
minifter would not have long to complain ; he would have 
no fear of relief,' from thole liberal ideas which his patron 
is known to entertain as to the endowments proper for the

fion enjoined to give him their affiftance in the matter *. Though fome addi- 
tional grants by the Crown have been given fince that time, there is Hill 
room for a third petition to the General Affembly, were this the competent 
channel for obtaining relief. 

Mr Chalmers, with his laft petition, gave in a memorial, containing an 
account of the ftate of his parifli. The compiler of this article regretted to 
karn, on inquiry, that it has not been preferved in reter.tis among the 
papers of the Church. It would have afforded him, probably, favourable 
materials for a ftatiftical comparifon of the circumftances of Dunkeld, ar 
two very diftant periods.

clergy, and that progrefiive increafe of allowance to which 
they are entitled amid the progrefiive improvement of the 
country. It is hoped, however, that the Crown, who by a 
former grant have acknowledged the fact of its being necef- 
fary to provide for the minifter of Dunkeld out of the bi- 
fliop's rents, will, by an additional grant, do that for him, 
which the equity of heritors, and the juftice of the Court of 
Sefiion, are doing for fo many of his brethren. 

2. Cathedral. — The quire of the cathedral is now con. 
verted into the parifh-church, and forms a decent, and not 
incommodious place of worfliip •, though, from the height 
of the walls, and the want of ceiling, it is not only bare and 
meagre to the eye, but is liable to be uncomfortably cold 
to the congregation during winter. 

In 1762, James, Duke of Atholl, finding the roof had 
gone to decay, obtained from Government L. 300 Sterling 
for renewing it, and accomplilhing fuch other repairs as 
were neceflary. This fum, together with the price of the 
old materials, and about L. 80 paid by different perfons for 
purchafing fpace on the ground of the area for feats, was 
employed ill putting on the prefent roof, and in completely 
new-feating the body of the church. Two galleries have 
fince been erecled, at the expence of ,£wo lodges of Free 
Mafons belonging to the town, who draw ttje rents paid for* 
them. In front of the pulpit, there is a fpacious and hand- 
fome feat fitted up for the family of Atholl-, and it fliould 
be known to their honour, that while they are at Dunkeld- 
Houfe, the feat is feldom empty during Divine fervice. 

The quire was founded by Bifhop Sinclair, and finilhed 
by him in 1350. As a memorial of his having done fo, he 
placed a crofs ingr'aille, (part of the arms of his family), on 
the top of the eafiern gable, where it ftill remains. In the 
middle of that gable there i^ to be feen a part of the 

old-

old wall of the Abbey of Culdees, which had flood there. 
] The windows, which were originally built in the Gothic 
t form *, yere modernifed in i 762, when the church was 
repaired. Several monuments were erefted to bifhops who 
1 had been buried in the quire. But thefe were either defa- 
jced at the Reformation, or were removed, or are covered 
I from view by the prefent feats. A fquare flab of blue 
J marble, which lay on the grave of Bifliop Sinclair, is ftill to 
be feen in front of the Duke of Atholl's feat, upon the 
i floor. In the fouth wall, on the well fide of the pulpit, 
i there are the arms of bifliop Alexander Lindfay, and on a 
lilone below them an infcription, bearing, that the roof had 
sbeen put on the quire by Stewart of Lady well. This muft 
(have been about 1600, for he died in 1636, in the 66th 
I year of his age. 

A monument which is now placed at the north fide of 
a the door which leads from the quire into the nave, re- 
\ quires more minute mention. It flood originally in the 
■ middle of the quire, and was erefted to the memory of 
I Alexander Earl of Buchan and Badenoch. He was third 
■fon of King Robert II. and from his ferocious and fangui- 
nary difpofition, was called the " Wolf of Badenoch." The 
bifliop of Moray excommunicated him on account of fpme 
predatory outrage againft his ecclefiaftical poflfeflions. In 
I revenge, the Earl, with a band of his retainers, ravaged 
3the diocefe, and burnt the town of Elgin, with its hofpital

dral feems more perfect than it is at prefent. With a ftrange inattention

of Maifon Dieu, and its magnificent cathedral ». For this 
facrilegious mifdemeanour, he was compelled by his father 
to appear, barefoot and in fackcloth, at the doc* of the 
Black Friars church in Perth, and afterwards to promife, at 
the high altar, where the King and Nobles were affembled, 
indemnification to the bifhop of Moray. He died in 1394. 
His monument confifts of his effigies recumbent, in armour, 
and large as life ; and is fupported by a row of ornamented 
pillars, intermixed with figures, The following infeription 
is upon it : " Hie jacet Dominus Alexander Senefcallus 
" Comes de Buchan, et Dominus de Badenach, bene memo- 
" rice, qui obiit 20 die menfis Februarii, anno Dom. 1394." 
This monument remained entire till the Revolution. A 
party of Angus' Cameronians, ftationed at that time ia 
Dunkeld, mutilated and defaced it. Stiil, however, it is in 
tolerably complete prefervation. 

Near it, a plain ftone, fixed in the north wall, bears an 
infeription facred to the memory of the late commiffary 
Thomas Biffet. It contains a well expreffed eulogy on the 
ilric~t integrity and blamelefs manners of the man, and is 
one of the few inftances where a tombftone fpeaks nothing 
but the truth. 

! On the north fide of the quire is the chapter-houfe. It 
was built by Bifhop Lauder in 1469, and is ftill, as defcribed 
by Abbot Mill, « a fine firm fabric." In a vault below it is 
the burying-place of the family of Atholl. The upper 
room, to which one afcends by a narrow flair, is occupied 
by the Duke as a charter-room.

lis the ftyle of the architecture. The pillars are round ; two 
jrange of arches, (feven in the length of the range), and 
tiabove them a range of windows, (equal in number), rife on 
leach another in the walls of the nave. At the weft end of 
jit, the remains of a magnificent window meet the eye. In 
(the wall of the fouth aifle, there is a monument which has 
cjbeen erected over the grave of one of the bifhops. A figure of 
la biiliop, with his Epifcopal ftafF and drefs, ftill lies in the niche" 
bwhich had been cut out for it. 

The area of this part of the building is employed as bu- 
yrying-ground by the inhabitants. On the day on which 
ithe Sacrament is difpenfed in the church, a tent is erected 
iin it, and fermon delivered ; — a finking picture of the mu- 
tability of human opinions, and human things J 

The porch of the fouth gate of the cathedral, built by Bi-, 
Ifhop Lauder, is mentioned by Abbot Mill * to have been a 
handfome piece of architecture, and " beautified with ieve- 
" ral fine images." The images have been long fince de- 
ftroyed, and the'whole wears the appearance of decay. 

One cannot ceafe looking at the nave and aifles of the 
cathedral, without lamenting as he fees them ftand rooflefs 
and in defolation. While he mufes, he mourns with regret 
over the blind and hafty zeal, which, in the ardour of chan- 
ging a creed, demolifhed a building, nor fpared, in its ha-

ing the dues payable to the chaplain of St Ninian, of which 
he obtained a grant. Thefe conlift of 20 merks Scots, 3

dwelling-houfe officially, and has in general a£ted as feffion- 
Clerk. His emoluments, as fuch, may amount to from 
L. 3 to L. 4 per annum. The number of fcholars is 80 in 
winter, and 60 in fummer ; all of them, whatever branch 
of education they are taught, pay as. 6d. per quarter. 
There is an annual examination of the fcholars in the

the patronage of the late Jane, Duchefs of Atholl. The 
Regulations, approved of by her Grace, for conducing it, 
are fubjoined * , The fees of the matter fhe determined as 
follows : L. 1, 1 s. to be paid yearly by herfelf, as patro-

II. That every meeting of the fchool begin and clofe with a prayer, by 
the mailer. 

III. That before the laft prayer, fome verfes be fung from the Pfalms, 
or from the Paraphrafes and Tranftations of Sacred Scripture. 

IV. That the fcholars be catechifed on the firft principles of religion. 

V. That a portion of the Bible, or a printed fermon, be read at every 
meeting, and that the matter, in the courfe of proceeding, make fuch re- 
marks as may explain and enforce what is read. 

VI. That on Sunday the fcholars walk in regular order, with the mailer,

family have always, when in the country, honoured the public 
examination with their prelence ; and fo liberal has the col- 
leclion proved, that it has been abundantly adequate to the 
object in view. At the firft of thefe examinations, which 
took place about three months after the commencement of 
the fchool, there were almoit incredible proofs given of ap- 
plication and memory. Several of the fcholars could re- 
peat the whole book, of Pfalms, and the whole Paraphrafes 
and Tranflations, befides many chapters from the Old and 
New Teftament. Hitherto, indeed, it has continued to 
fiourifh, with a fuccefs which has never been exceeded by 
any fimilar eftablifliment, and which reflects credit on the 
teacher, the fcholars, the parents, and the memory of Her 
whofe benevolence and piety gave rife to it. The be- 
nefit of fuch inftitutions is incalculable. 

3. Female School*. — This fchool, alfo, was inftituted by 
the late Jane, Duchefs of Atholl. Her Grace gave an annual 
falary to a perfon properly qualified, to teach the different 
branches of female education, fuch as fewing, tambouring, 
&amp;c. and paid the ufual rates for a certain number of fcho- 
lars, whom me nominated. The miftrefs, at the fame time, 
was allowed to receive and teach other fcholars, additional 
to thefe. All of them continue the practice of reading a 
leflbn in Englifii daily. 

Poor. 

1. Number. — There are no begging poor belonging to the 
parifh ; 17 receive a fupply in their own houfes, at the rate 
of 6 d. or 1 s. weekly, in proportion to their necefiities-, and 
occafionally not lefs than 50 partake of the benefit of the 
funds. 

2. Funds. 



* The prefent Duchefs of Atholl patronifes this and the Sunday fchool.

2. Funds. — Thefe amount to not lefs than L. 80 Sterling 
per annum. They confift of the collection at the church- 
doors, which are equal yearly to L. 26 ; of fees for procla- 
mations, ufe of the mort-cloth, &amp;c. L. 3 ; of the intereft of 
ftock in the hands of the feflion, nearly L. 4 •, of L. 28 Scots 
paid in confequence of a mortification by one of the Dukes 
of Atholl * ; and of the funds of the hofpital of St George, 
which are, at an average, L. 45 Sterling f. 

Befides thefe permanent funds, great exertions never fail 
to be made for the relief of the poor, when any extraordi- 
nary emergency calls for them. In 1782, the Duke of 
Atholl bought jco bolls of meal, drove it at his own ex- 
pence to Dunkeld, and fold it at a reduced price to the 
poor of the town and its neighbourhood. And his Grace, 
in 1796, fubfcribed L. 50, which, with the fame fum fub- 
fcribed by the inhabitants, was employed in purchafing 

meal. 

* The Duke of Atholl, with confent of the minifter, names the •bjects 
,of this charity. It is paid, " in full contentation and fatisfaclion of all that 
" the poor of the city of Dunkeld can afk furth of the Croft called the 
" Chancellor's Croft, by Andrew Burt his deed of mortification." Burt's 
deed of mortification is given in Dallas' Styles, p. 840. *' as a good ftyle, 
f that may be a rule to the like." He gives the fubjects mentioned " in pu- 
" ram eleemofynam et in manum mortuam pro precibus et fuffragiis of the 
" poor, in the moft ferious, pious, and devout manner, for his MAjESTTTs 
" facred perfon, and his lineal and lawful fucceffors well-being, health, 
" wealth, profperity, and happy peaceable reign, over this his Majejly's an- 
" cient kingdom, and all other his Majejly's kingdoms, dominions, and 
U territories, (-whiles fun and moon endureth in the finnamcnt ), and for 
." crowning them with an everlafing crown of glory hereafter." 

[ This hofpital, according to Abbot Mill, was founded by Bifhop Brown, 
It was deftined for the fupport of feven old men, who were each to have a 
free houfe, and to receive five bolls of meal, and five merks Scots yearly. 
Prior to 1750, the hofpital houfes were low ruinous cottages ; at that time 
they were pulled down, and fubftantial buildings raifed on their fite. Ths 
ComrnuTary has the folc adminiftration of the hofpital and its funds.

meal. This the poor received at 1 s. 2 d. for oat-meal, and 
8 d. for barley-meal, per peck ; which was at leaft 7 d. be- 
low the current market price at the time *. 

In 1755, the number of poor fupplied weekly was 14 ; 
: and of thofe fupplied occafionally, 5. The colleftion 
i amounted to only L. 6, 10 s. per annum, and the ftock in the 
1 hands of the feffion was L. 43. 

There are fome Societies which have been eftabliftied for 
, the benefit of the poor, and of which the good efFefts are 
extenfively felt. 

1. The Cor diners Society. — This fociety originated many 
years ago, but was new-modelled in 1774. It confifts 
of 50 members. Each pays ios. 6 d. of entry-money, 

J and 6 d. quarterly. From this fund 3 s. weekly is allow- 
ed to members that are fick or fuperannuated, and L. 1, is. 
I for the burial of each member, in whatever circumftances 
jhe may be, 

2. Weavers^Society, — Was inftituted in 1785, by the jour- 
■neymen weavers. The number of members is already 
1 160. Several gentlemen, friendly to fuch inftitutions, have 
1 enrolled their names, and pay the ufual contribution, which 
] is the fame with that fixed by the Cordiners. The fame al- 
lowance is alfo made by them to the fick and fuperannuat-

ed; and they, further, give occafxonal relief to the widows 
and children of members. 

3. Mafon Lodges. — Of thefe there are two in. Dunkeld, 
One is No XVI. in the roll of the Grand Lodge of Scot- J 
land, and the other No CCII. Though thefe were not in- | 
ftituted for the immediate purpofes of charity, yet a great.; 
portion of their funds are applied to them. Indeed, the lat- 
ter have ingrafted a box on their Mafonic funds, from which 
they allow 3 s. weekly to a member in diftrefs, L. 2 for his 
burial, and L. 1 for the burial of his wife. 

Trade and Manufactures. 

1. Yarn.-^— This is the ftaple commodity of the country 
above Dunkeld, and the merchants here deal in it exten- 
lively. Not lefs than 200,000 fpindles are bought annual- 
ly. The price varies greatly in different feafons, according , 
to the ftate of the flax crop, and of the linen market. 01 
late, however, it has been progreflively rifing. In 1776, it if 
was from 1 s. 8d. to 1 s. 10 d. per fpindle. In 1796, it wasJi 
from 3 s. to 3 s. 3 d. The yarn which is bought in Dun- 
keld, but not manufactured there, is fold to Perth, Du«4li 
fermline, or Glafgow *. 

2. Linen. — This manufacture is carried on, by fome fpirit-ti 
ed individuals, to a very conliderable extent. They employ 
not only fuch weavers as they can find accommodation foi

comparative trial was made betwixt the quantity and quality of the yarn ! 
which could be fpun on this improved wheel, and one of the old form. The 
refult was, that with greater eafe to the fpinner, nearly one-third more, and

3. Tanning, — There are tanned here annually, at an ave- 
rage, of horfe Ikins, 22o^and of ftieeps, 2100, The fitua- 
tion is favourable for the manufacture. Oak-bark is near, 
and, comparatively with its price in places more diftant, 
cheap. Some years ago it was bought at 8 d. per (tone ; it 
cofts now 1 s. 3 d. Birch-bark has been fometimes em- 
ployed as a fubftitute, but is found to be much weaker in 
its effects. It fells at half the price of the oak-bark.

Fairs 

f The increafc of trade in Dunkeld, for the laft 12 years, may be infer- 
red from the increafe of the Pott-Office revenue. For the year 17S6, it was 
L. 138 : 16 : 4 ; and for the year ending 5th January 1798, it was L. 279, 
11s. id.; an increafe (allowing for the additional rate of poftage lately 
im\'oftd) of L. 50 at had per annum.

Fairs and Markets. 

There are fix yearly fairs in Dunkcld. They are hel^ | 
on the ift of January, and Candlemas day, chiefly for the 
fale of yarn ; on 25th of March, for yarn and horfes; on 
9th June, (St Columba's day), for coarfe cloths and other 
goods ; Hallow-Day, for black-cattle, fheep and goats ; and 
on the 8th December, for yarn. At thefe fairs a guard, 
paid by the Duke of Atholl, and provided with arms, is 
always in readinefs to preferve the peace, and apprehend 
any offenders who may be detected. 

There is a weekly market every Saturday. On thefe, 
and the intervening days of the week, there are fold annu- 
ally 130 carcafes of beef; 144 of veal; 800 of mutton; 
and 20 of pork. Calculating from the average weight of ; 
each of thefe refpe&amp;ively, and the price at which it is fold : 
per lb. the total amount of the butcher-meat fold will be 
above L. 2000. There are two butchers who refide in the 
town, and two who attend the weekly market of Saturday. 

The Duke of Atholl has a right to draw cuftom for the I 
various articles brought to thefe fairs and markets for fale. 
The rate charged is fmall. The rent paid by the tackfman 
is L. 1 2 per annum. 

Chapmen Society. 

This is a very ancient inftitution. The original char- 
ter was from James V. of Scotland, and it was renewed by 
James, Duke of Atholl, as High Sheriff of Perthfhire, 
about 1730. There is one general meeting of the Society 
yearly, which, till 1776, was held always at Dunkeld, but 
now alternately at Dunkeld and Cupar of Angus. At 
this meeting the office-bearers for the enfuing year are cho- 
fen ; the laws are enacted or repealed ; complaints of mem- 
bers heard, and offenders fined ; and affiftance given from 

their

•their funds to indigent members. The meeting is ftyled a 
Court '*. All members coming to the market are obliged 
to attend it. They are fummoned by one of the office- 
bearers, who, to enforce their attendance, goes round to the 
different booths, in open market, and takes from each a 
piece of goods, or 2 s. 6 d. as a pledge for his appearance. 
Each muft produce his meafures and weights, which are 
compared with ftandards kept for the purpofe f . If they 
are found deficient, he is fined at the difcretion of the 
court. He muft produce alfo, under a penalty, a copy of 
the Bible, with his own name written upon it. After the 
court (which meets on the day after St Colm's) is clofed, 
the members dine together ; and, to prevent that intempe- 
rance to which focial meetings in fuch fituations are fome- 
times prone, they fpend the evening in fome public compe- 
tition of dexterity or {kill. Of thefe, " riding at the ring," 
(an amufement of ancient and warlike origin), is the chief- 
Two perpendicular polls are erefted on this occafion, with, 
a erofe beam, from which is fufpended a fmall ring : the: 
competitors are on horfeback, each having a pointed rod in 
his hand ; and he who, at full gallop, paffing betwixt the 
pofts, carries away the ring upon his rod gains the prize. 

Planting. 

Within the laft 50 years, very extenfive plantations have 
been made around Dunkeld ; and both in point of beauty 
added to the landfcape, and of value to the foil, there is 
ample remuneration made to the proprietor.

The prefent Duke of Atholl has planted upward., of 
4000 acres. The principal fpccies he cultivates is the la-

them. 

It is to be regretted, both by the naturalift and the land- 
holder, that fo few regifters have been kept or publiuitd 
refpefting the growth of trees. In truth, fuch regifters it 
muft: at all times be difficult to procure, from the length of 
time to be pafled in amafling fads, before any ufeful deduc- 
tion can be drawn. No man loves to enter on a train of

In the foregoing Tables, there are two material defefls, 
which they who keep fimilar tables in future ftiould avoid,- 
viz. that they neither defcribe the foil on which the diffe- 
rent fpecies were planted, nor mention the age of the trees 
at the date of their firft meafurement. Still, however, ufe- 
ful inferences may be drawn from them, particularly when 
compared with fuch others as are on record. For the pur- 
pose 



of Dunkeld.

pole of fuch comparifon, the following is given, Rating the 
increafe of fome trees in a plantation belonging to the Mar- 
quis of Lanfdown. They were planted in 1765, and mea. 
fured in 1786, at the heighth of 5 feet from the ground.

3. Chefnut, - - 29 

4. Scots fir, - - 2, 10 

5. Spruce, - -22 

6. Larix, - - 3 10 

The fame objections lie againft this Table as the two 
former, and it has this in addition, that only one tree of 
each fpecies was meafured. In looking at Table I. and IL 
remarkable differences may be obferved betwixt the growth 
of different individuals of the fame fpecies. In this, there- 
fore, as in other cafes, where it is wiflied to found a gene- 
ral conclufion, the induction of particular cafes mould be 
extenlive. A thoufand accidental circumftances may acce- 
lerate or retard the growth of one tree, which may not oc- 
cur to any other in the whole plantation ; but if the mea- 
furement is taken of many, the hurtful and the favourable 
circumftances fo counterbalance each other, as to produce a 
fair average refult, on which the planter may rely. 

The important general conclufion from thefe Tables is, 
that the planting of timber-trees, if the proper fpecies is 
chofen, is a profitable mode of cropping ground, if not very 
valuable for the plough. It is one which accumulates 
yearly in value, without an yearly outlay of expence, and

will fully repay, at the time of cutting it down, the origi. 
ml coil, with intereft for the fum, and rent during the time of 
growth. Of all the kinds particularly fpecified in the 
Tables, the larix appears, on the whole, to increafe in fize 
mod rapidly. Its other qualities make it very valuable. It 
is fit for every purpofe almoft of the carpenter, is very hardy 
as a plant, and very lafting when in ufe. By a fingle experi- 
ment of Sir Thomas Beevor *, it feems not fo lafting as the 
fpruce i yet experiments innumerable fhew it to have a 
ftrong claim to Pliny's appellation of immortale lignum. In 
Venice, and on the borders of the lake of Geneva, it has 
been found to refill, much longer than any other wood, the 
alternations of wet and dry. The Duke of Atholl caufed 
one of the boats at the ferry here to be conftru&amp;ed of the 
larix wood ; and a plank of oak, from a tree 30 years old, 
was put in for a tell of the comparative durability of each. 
The oak has decayed, and the larix continues found. Next to 
the larix, the elm, the birch, the fpruce, and the oak, feem 
to claim the preference from the planter, due attention be. 
ing always paid to foil. The larix, birch, and fpruce, 
thrive on the fame foil ; and from the variety of their co- 
lours have, particularly in the winter-feafon, a beautiful 
appearance to the eye, when mixed in the fame plantation. 

Of the Lucombe oak, 25 were planted here in 1774. 
This fpecies was firft cultivated near Exeter, by a gardener 
of the name of Lucombe, and very flattering accounts were 
given of the amazing quicknefs of its growth, and the value 
of its wood f. The experiment in Table I. does not jufti. 
fy thefe accounts. It is faid to be much cultivated in So- 
merfet and Cornwall.

In the plantations round Dunkeld, fquirrels are nume- 
rous. Attempts have been repeatedly made to propagate 
a breed of pheafants, but always in vain. When firll fent 
out, they are tame and fluggifh, and fall an ealy prey to 
I the foxes, polecats, &amp;c, which abound here. All the birds 
common to Scotland are here, and fome of kinds that are 
rare have been feen. Since the larix (on the cones of 
which they live) has been cultivated, the Crofsbill (Loxia 
curvirojira) has appeared. Occafionally, too, the rofe- 
coloured Ouzel, (JTurdus rofeui); the alb-coloured Butcher- 
bird, {Lanius excubitor) ; the golden -crefted Wren, (Mola- 
cilia regulus); and the green Woodpecker, (Piais vzrz'dis), 
are found* 

Gardens, 

The gardens of the Duke of Atholl lie to the north-weft 
of the houfe, on a Iharp light foil, with a fouthern afpejcT:, 
and are well Iheltered, Experiments on different plants 
have been made in them. In 1770, fome feeds of the true 
Rheum Palmatum, were fent from Peterfburgh, by Dr 
Mounfey, to his Grace. They were planted, and conlider- 
able attention was paid to the culture of that root. Rhu- 
barb, to the value of L. ?6o Sterling, was fold in one fea- 
fon, to a London druggift, at the rate of 8 s. per lb. 
In fhort, full proof was afforded, that rhubarb may be raifed 
and dreffed in Britain, equal, in all its qualities, to what is 
now, at fo high a price, imported from the Eaft Indies, and 
from Ruffia and Turky. 

The Truffle, (Lycoperdoji Tuber of Linnams), was plant- 
ed here, but was not found to thrive*.

In a corner of the old gardens flands Stanley Hill, a co- 
nical mount, chiefly artificial, raifed by James, Duke of 
Atholl, about the year 1730. On the north, it is co-v 
vered with tall trees; and on the fouth-weft, with flnubs. 
Broad walks, rifing fucceflively above each other, run round 
it. Several cannon are placed on the fummir, which fire oc- 
cafionally afeu de joye *. 

The gardens of the inhabitants of Dunkeld lie partly on 
the fouth fide of the town, ftretching from the houfes to the? 
fide of the river, which waflies the bottom of the wall. 
They lie partly, alfo, on the face of the abrupt rifing 
ground that overhangs the town upon the north-eaft. Rent 
for a fmall fpot is paid for by each family, at the rate of 
L. 4 per acre. From its precipitous fteepnefs, in fome 
places, great art and induftry are necefiary to labour it with . 
fafety or profit. A late author, in attempting to heighten 
the probability of introducing horticulture with advantage, 
into the bleak and high regions of the weft coaft of Scot- ! 
land, refers to the gardens of the inhabitants of Dunkeld i 
as a cafe in point, to refute the objection, that the expofure 
and elevation are unfurmountable objections to his plan. , 
The objection may be groundless ; but thefe gardens do not

CoMMONTY IN A HlLL. 

Dunkeld being the feat of a bilhoprick, and hence or 
the dignified clergy, moft of the lands around it belonged 
to them, and had feveral peculiar privileges. Thefc 
privileges have, of courfe, defcended to thofe who pur- 
chafed the lands. They are thirled to no mill ; they pay no 
cuftom;.and there is a right of commonty attached to 
them, in a hill which lies to the northward of the Duke of 
Atholl's policy. The hill is extenfive, but rocky and fle- 
rile. Some of the inhabitants, however, fend their cows 
to graze upon it in fummer, and a few peats are at times 
dug from its moffes. They collect, too, ftones on it, for the 
purpofes of building. It is cuftomary to ride the marches, 
occasionally, fo as to preferve in the memory of the people 
the limits of their property. 

Bridge. 

It appears from the hiftory of Abbot Mill, that a bridge 
began to be thrown acrofs the Tay, " partly of wood, and

" partly of ftone," fo early as 1469. But there is no evi- 
dence of its having been ever completed, and no veftige of it 
now remains. The foundation of a fecond bridge was laid 
in 15 13, by Bifhop Brown, " near to his own palace," and 
it was continued and completed by Bifhop Gavin Dou- 
glas *. A part of the arch which fprang from the north 
bank is flill entire, and when the river is low, the piles, on 
which the pillars of the fecond and the third arches were 
fupported^ are vifible. No account has been tranfmitted, 
of the time at which it was demolished or fwept away, but 
its lofs is daily felt, and loudly complained of. To the ca» 
fual traveller, a new bridge would be obvioufly a defirable 
accommodation, and to Dunkeld, and the large diftricl con- 
nected with it, a moft important acquifition. The river 
(which has been known to rife 17 feet at the ferry above 
its ufual level) is often fo fwelled, as to render the paffage 
by a boat either impracticable, or highly perilous ; and the 
general wafte of time, and danger to carriages which is ex- 
perienced, (however Ikilfully or alertly the boats are ma- ■ 
naged), often prompts thofe who wouli have otherwife pre- 
ferred Dunkeld as a market-place, to proceed to Perth. An 
eftimate, by an engineer of talents and experience, calcu- • 
lates the coft of a bridge, of three arches, to be built oppo- 
lite to the church of Little-Dunkeld, at L. 12,000 Sterling.

Miscellaneous Facts. 

Houfes, in Dunkeld, fell at 20 years purchafe. The 
real rent of the town is nearly L. 1000 Sterling. The va- 
lue, therefore, is nearly L. 20,000. Several new houfes 
have been lately built. 

A committee of the inhabitants fix an yearly affeffment, 
which amounts, at an average, to L. 8 Sterling, for repair- 
ing the ftreets and avenues of the town. 

In 1648, Sir James Galloway, Mafter of Requefts to 
James VI. and Charles I. was created Lord Dunkeld *. 
His grandfon James was attainted at the Revolution, and 
dying at the beginning of this century, the title became ex- 
tinS. 

Dunkeld is a barony, and its only magistrate a baron- 
bailie, appointed by the Duke of Atholl. Charles II. of- 
fered a charter of ereftion into a royal borough. The offer 
was refufed.

Advantages and Disadvantages. 
The advantages are, I. Being, in the language of that coun- 
try, " in the mouth of the Highlands," it muft always 
command a great proportion of the trade with the extenfive 
diftridt beyond it. 2. Yarn and oak-bark are to be obtain- 
ed, in any required quantity, in the immediate neighbour- 
hood. 3. Wages and houfe-rents, though high, and rapidly 
rifing, are yet lower than in places nearer to the centre of 
population and luxury. 4. Not being a royal borough, it 
is thus free from corporation reftrictions, and from election 
canvaffing ; a canvaffing which, by holding out the profpect 
of pleafure without expence, and of gain without labour, 
feduces the difiblnte and the lazy, and is followed, too of- 
ten, by general intemperance, corruption, and ruin. 5. The 
refidence of the Duke of Atholl's family. Their con- 
sumption increafes its trade; their improvements employ 
its labourers ; their benevolence affifts its poor ; and their 
patronage is ready to promote the comfort and good of the 
whole. 

The difadvantages are, 1. The length of land-carriage. 
It is 15 miles from Perth, the neareft fea-port, and the de- 
lay and hazard of a ferry, over a large river, is to be en- 
countered by the way. 2. The dearnefs of fuel. Coals are 
never under 1 s. per cwt. and they have been occafionally 
as high as 2 s. 3. The extravagant price of ground, and the 
fmall extent, even at that price, which is, or can be expect- 
ed in the market. 4. The want of water-falls : this, com- 
bined with the laft, renders the erection of machinery on a 
large fcale impracticable. 

Hints for Improvement. 
1. The Hill Commonty mould be inclofed and planted, 
or exchanged, (if the Duke of Atholl is. favourable to the 

tranlaftion), 



44 6 



Statijiical Account 



tranfa&amp;ion), for his Grace's right of drawing cuflom at fairs 
and markets. The rent of thefe would be a permanent 
and regular fund, applicable to the wants of the poor, or 
the improvement of the town; while the privilege of the 
commonty has long been felt but of very precarious and 
fcanty benefit. 2. A Female Friendly Society mould be 
eftabliflied, on the fame principle with the Cordiners and 
Weavers Society. Deftitute women have always formed 
the mod numerous lift of claimants on the public charitable 
funds. In 1755, when 14 perfons were fupplied weekly 
by the feffion, there were 10 women in the number; and 
there was no lefs a proportion than 40 women, out of 5a 
perfons, fupplied at an occafional diftribution, in 1790. 
4. A public well fhould be dug; the want of foft water be- 
ing at prefent a great inconvenience. A lefs fum than has 
been expended (L.60 Sterl.) by a fpirited diftiller, on one for 
the ufe of his own works, and which might eafily be raifed 
by contribution or affeffment, would procure a copious 
fupply for the whole town. 5. Were it poflible to eftablifh 
in the neighbourhood a brewery, a bleachlield, and thread 
manufactory, for the latter of which, particularly, circum- 
ftances are favourable, the advantage to Dunkeld would be 
great. 

Character of the Inhabitants. 

In their character there is much more to approve than to 
cenfure. They are active, induftrious, and fpirited. Equal- 
ly obfervant as their neighbours of the forms of religion, 
they are not inferior in the fruits of its fpirit. Sufficiently 
enlightened as to the extent of a fubject's privileges and 
claims, it is believed that not one native of Dunkeld is fe- 
ditious in principle, or difpofed to turbulence in conducL 
Their fympathy for the diftrefled is peculiarly prompt and 
lively ; and they practice eminently the good deeds of cha- 
rity, 



of Dunkeld. 447 

rity. They are diftinguiflied by a frank and open-hearted 
civility to Grangers. No one ever reforted to Dunkeld, 
whether as an invalid, for the recovery of his health, or as 
a traveller, on an excurfion of amufement, without experi- 
encing that they were a hofpitable and obliging people. 

This tribute is due equally to the Epifcopalians and Glaf- 
fites, as to the members of the Eftablifhed Church. It may 
be viewed as juft with the greater confidence, that it is paid 
by one who, having refided among them for feveral years, 
Js qualified to decide ; and being now difconnecled and di- 
ftant, has nothing either to hope from their favour, or to 
fear from their refentment. 



To the Memory 
OF JANE, LATE DUCHESS OF ATHOLL, 

This Account (in which fome of her deeds of good are no- 
ticed) is inferibed by the Compiler ; it is inferibed, in the 
recollection of her virtues, and her kindnefs, with a refpecl 
and gratitude as heart-felt as ever imprefled any human 
being.

APPENDIX 



TO THE 



STATISTICAL ACCOUNT OF DUNKELD. 



THE Compiler of the preceding Account ftudioufly confined it to cxijl- 
ing Statiftical facts. He confidered thefe, and not antiquities or hi- 
Jlory, as forming the proper object of his paper. Indeed, had he attempted 
to detail the paft hiftory of Dunkeld and its inhabitants, he muft have de- • 
tailed the national hiftery of Scotland, as the Bilhops of that See, and the 
Reprefentatives of the family of Atholl, filled, in general, a confpicuous 
part in the public tranfaclions of their times. It feems, however, due to 
the feat of a Billioprick, which was for centuries fo eminent both in dig- 
nity and influence, that fome notices fliould be prefented of the Prelates 
who prelided in it. In this Appendix, therefore, a catalogue fliall be 
given of the Bifhops of Dunkeld, accompanied by occafional oLfervations 
relpecting the moft remarkable individuals of the feries. 

St Colnmba is faid, by fome authors, to have founded a church in Dun- 
keld, fo early as the 6th century, (Dr Smith's Life of St Coluinba, p. 151*9 
and we are afiured, that after the incurfions of the Norwegians and Danes 
had ravaged and ruined Iona, where that Saint and his followers had flou- 
rillied, Dunkeld became the head of the religious eftablifliment of both the 
Scots and the Picts, {Ibid). — By other authors, however, and particularly 
by Abbot Mill, the eccleliaftical hiftory of Dunkeld is not traced higher 
than the year 729. In that year, we are informed, that Conftantine HI.

'Fang of the Picts, by the perfuafion of Adamnanus, a difciple of St Columba, 
■inftituted a convent there, and filled it with that order of monks which 
were denominated Culdees. " In quo quidem Monafterio impofuit veros 
" rcligiofos quos nominat valgus Kelidcos, aliter Colideos, hoc eft colentes 
» Deum." (Mill). The etymology of the name of this clafs of the Mo- 
naftic orders, given by the Abbot, and generally adopted, feems to be erro- 
neous. The word Kolidei, is, in fart, merely the Latinized Gaelic phrafe 
Cillc Be, which iignifies " Famuli Dei," or, " Servant of God." (Life 
of St Columba, p. 162,) Many obfeure and angry difputations have been 
carried on reflecting their rules and tenets. The Prelbyterians, and thofe 
who are partial to the order of Bifliops, each claim the Culdees as belong- 
ing to their party. There are facts in their hiftory which tend to prove, 
that they affected to be Independents. (Hailes's Annals of Scotland, 

-vol. 1. p. 107.) Their convent at Dunkeld was dedicated to the Holy 
Trinity. (Sir James Balrymple^s Colle€tions, p. 247.) 

In 1127, David I. King of Scotland converted the convent into a cathe- 
dral, and in order, as it would appear, to induce the Culdees to an union 
with the Romifli Church, he guaranteed to them during life the rights and 
the poffeffions which had formerly belonged to their convent, and he nomi- 
nated their Abbot to be the Bifliop of the new See. (Dal. Col. p. 247. 

• and 387.) 

1. GREGORY was the name of this firft Bifliop. After his confecration, 
he was made a Privy Counfellor, and obtained liberal grants from the So- 
vereign. He died in 11 6g. ' (Mill, and Cart. Melr. as quoted by Keith uz 
■his Catalogue of B if] ops, p. 46.) 

2. RICHARD DE PREBENDA. (Fcrdun, lib. viii. c. 13.) calls 
him " Capellanus Regis Willelmi." He was one of the Commiflloners for 
Scotland in negotiating with Henry IL in 1 1 74, for the releafe of King 
William, at that time a prifoner in England, (Fcedera Anglice, t. 1. p. 39.) 
and in 11 76 he attended William to a council held at Northampton, by 
Cardinal Huguccio Petrileonis, the Pope's Legate. (Hoveden, 550.) Mill 
and Keith think he died in 1 173 ; but the facts mentioned prove this to be 
•a miftake. Fordun (lib. viii. r. 13.) fays he died in 1178. 

— WALTER DE . BIDON. He was one of the Clerici Regis, and 
•nfterwards Chancellor of the kingdom. Though elected te the See of Dun- 
keld, he died before his confecration, and cannot therefore be numbered as 
■ one of its Bifliops. 



3. JOHN SCOT. This Prelate was, in n 77, elected Bifliop of St An- 
drews, by the Chapter. " Electus eft (Fordun, lib. vi. c. 35.) Rcge

" Willdmo totis viribus renitente ;" that Monarch paffionately exclaim. 
i')g, when the election was announced to him, " By the arm of St James 
John Scot fliall never be Bilhop of St Andrews." The Pope, however, 
Supported the pretenfions of John, and a controverfy enfued, which agitated 
Scotland, and embroiled William with the Head of the Church for fcveial 
years. It was terminated at laft by the nomination of John Scot to the 
diocefe of Dunkeld, with liberty to retain the emoluments belonging to 
him as Archdeacon of St Andrews, an office which he previoufly held. 

{Ford. lib. vi. c. 35, 38.) This Bilhop had great influence with Pope 

Alexander III. " eura in quamlibet partem quam vellit ratione tamen 
" prxvia inclinavit." {Ibid.) That Pope, at his requeft, conftituted Ar- 
gyle, which till his time was a part of the diocefe of Dunkeld, a feparate 
See. John Scot* died in 1203, and was buried in the north fide of the 
quire of the Abbey-church of Newbottle, " ubi (fays Fordun) claret mira- 
«« culis." 

4. RICHARD DE BREBENDA. He was confecrated in 1203, died 
at Cramond in 1210, and was buried in Inch-Colm. Fordun, lib. viii. c. 64, 
et c. 78. 

5. JOHN OF LEICESTER, died in ^214. Mill and Ford. lib. ix. 
c. 27. 

6. HUGO DE SIGILLO. He was a monk of Arbroath. Fordun 
{lib. ix. c. 47.) calls him " vir manfuetiffimus qui dicebatur pauperuiq 
" Epifcopus." The date of his death is uncertain. 

— MATHEW SCOT, at that time Chancellor of the kingdom, was 
elected, but died before his confecration. Fordun, ibid. 

7. GILBERT. He had been chaplain to his predeceflbr Bifliop Hugh. 
He appears as a witnefs to a deed of Alexander II. in 1227. A copy of 
this deed was publiflied in 1771, by the late John Davidfon, Efq; along 
with fome other curious papers, all of which have been annexed as an Ap- 
pendix to The Annals of Scotland. Though it proves that Fordun {lib, ix.

not fix the date of that event. He died in 1236. 

7 . GALFRID LIVEBfANCE. He reformed the cathedral worfliip in 
imitation of the Church of Sarum, and the mufic according to the Grego- 
run manner. (MM.) According to Fordun (lib.ix.c. 63.) he died at 
Tibbermuir, in 1249, and was buried in the Church of Dunkekl, " quarn 
" pnediis &amp; pofieffionibus dotavit, quarn regulis et inftitutis informavit, 
" quarn veflibus &amp; ornamentis decoravit, quarn fele per omnia exaltavit." 
His epitaph was, 

Hac, Dunkeldenfis cleri decus, aegis &amp; enfis 
Gaufridus tumba paufat, fub patre Columba. 

Fordun tit fupra. 

After Galfrid, Abbot Mill places Richard, who was, he fays, " Chancel- 
" lor to the King." But as there was no Chancellor of that name about 
that period, Mr Keith feems to be right in conjecturing, that the Abbot 
has here fallen into a miftake. Catal. ofBijl). p. 50. 

Mill has been guilty of another miltake, in omitting to mention 

DAVID. He was eledled in 1150, but never was confecrated. Ca- 
tal. ofBifi. p. 50. 

8. RICHARD OF INVERKEITHING. He Was one of the Regents of 
the kingdom during the minority of Alexander HI. Feed. i. 566. Cardinal 
Ottobonus de Fiefchi, in 1266, came as Legate from the Pope to Scotland, 
and required a contribution from the Church to defray the expence of his 
vifitation. The King, with the advice of the Clergy, forbade it to be le- 
vied. The Legate called a council, and Richard was deputed by the Bi- 
fliops to attend it : " Ne quid, ipfis abfentibus in eOrum prejudicium ftatu- 
" eritur." Fordun, lib. x. c. 24. He died in 1272, " vir (fays the fame 
M author, lib, x. c. 30.) magnae maturitatis Sc gravitatis, qui fuit fidelifli. 
" mus regis &amp; regni cbnfiliarius &amp;. juftitia inflexibilis." 

9. ROBERT DE STUTEVILLE. He was Dean of Dunkeld. Ac- 
Cording to Mill he died in I300j but hiftorical fadts difprove this. For, 

ro. MATHEW was eledled in I295 earl ier. In that year he ap- 
pears as one of the Commiflioners fent to France to negociate with Philip 
an alliance, by the marriage of the daughter of the Count of Anjou with

A Eifhop of Dunkeld, moft. probably Mathew, was one of the ten Scot- 
tiih Commiflioners, who, in concurrence with twenty from England, met at 
Perth in 1305, immediately after the death of William Wallace, and by 
order of Edward, eftabliflied regulations for the government of Scotland.

11. WILLIAM SINCLAIR. On the death of Mathew, John de Leek 
was elected by the chapter, and Edward applied to the Pope and the Col- 
lege of Cardinals, {Feed. t. iii. p. 164, 165.), earneftly urging the confirma- i 
tion of his election; but the partizans of Robert Bruce, who favoured the 
election of William Sinclair, brother to the Laird of Roflin, prevailed • 
Leek was in 1311 appointed Archbifhop of Dublin. In a letter of thanks- 
for this appointment, written by Edward to the Pope, he is ftyled, « Jo. ' 
" hannis de Leek capellanus nofter kariflimus, nuper Dunkeldenfis ecclefis: 
" electus." Feed, t. iii. 258. Sinclair then was confecrated without op. £ 
pofition to the See of Dunkeld. Robert I. ufually called William Sinclair 
" his own Bilhop." This appellation he got on the following occalion. 
In 131 7, an Englifli fleet arrived in the Forth, and fome troops which they, 
landed at Dunebriflel, near Inverkeithing, began to ravage the country. 
The Sheriff of Fife collected haltily 500 men, and marched to oppofe them, 
but intimidated by the numbers of the invaders, he fled with precipita- 
tion. William Sinclair was then at his neighbouring refidence of Ochter- 
tool, and hearing of this ihameful flight, he battened to meet and rally the 
fugitives. Leading them again to the charge, he drove the Englhh to their 
fliips with confiderable lofs. Abbot Mill, in his life of this Prelate, thus 
narrates this occurrence, tranferibing pretty clofely from Fordun, lib. xii. 
c. 25. " Epifcopus fe cito ornavit, equum afcendet cum fexaginta fuis ad 
" praslium dotis et cito obvium habuit vieecomitem- cui Clara voce dixit. 
" Cur tarn vecorditer revertitis ?" Relpondet Vicecom?s " Quia' ( Angli

miti, " prior i" led " Sequere," quern fecuti, et cum Iioilibus congrcfli, viclo- 
« rift Hint feliciter potiti." Fordun exprefTes the latter part of the dcfcription 
thus : " Ad pauca, viifloria meritis, verbis, et verberibus hujus inclyti prx- 
" fnlis funt potiti." Barbour, p. 344. fays of the Bifhop, " He was right 
« hardy, meikle, and ftark." It has been alibi-ted, that in 1332 he aflilted 
at the coronation of Edward Baliol, at Scone ; and that his fignature is 
found at that difgraceful inftrument, by which the Scottifli Parliament held 
at Edinburgh in 1333, furrendered the independence and liberty of their 
country to the Englifh Monarch. Lord Hailes {An. of Scot. v. ii. p. 172, 
and iSS.) is of this opinion. Yet it feems probable, that William Sinclair 
died before either of thefe tranfaclions took place. For Keith {Catal. of 
Eijb. p. 52.) proves that Walter was Bifhop of Dunkeld fo early as 1324. 
At the fame time, as the fignature of William, as Bilhop of the See, appears 
at different public deeds, from 1325 to 1337, we mull conclude that Wal- 
ter died in the end of 1324, or the beginning of 1325, and that another 
Wiiliam fucceeded before the end of the lalt-mentioned year ; and it will 
then be this William, and not William Sinclair, who, deferting the intereil 
of the King who called him his own Bifhop, crowned Baliol ; and who 
acceded to the humiliation of his country, in order to gratify Edward in 
1333. Catal. ofBi/b. p. 52. 

According to this opinion, the nest Bifhop to be reckoned in the order of 
fuceeffion is, 

ix. WALTER. 1 

13. WILLIAM. He died in 1337. 

14. DUNCAN. Abbot Mill fays that he died in 1363. But in this he 
was miftaken. He died before 1356. 

15. JOHN. In 1356 he was prefent in the Parliament which met at 
Edinburgh, and agreed to pay 100,000 merks to the Englifh for the ranfom 
of David II. Feed. t. vi. 39, 40.' In 1369 he was a witnefs to the treaty 
for a truce between England and Scotland, for 14 years. Feed. t. vi. 632. 
Abbot Mill has omitted this Bilhop.

arid died in 1376. Mill.

was he who drew up the celebrated adl of Parliament which recognifed 
the title of Robert II. to the throne of Scotland. He died in 1396. 

18. ROBERT DE CAIRNEY. He (hewed great zeal and afliduity in 
adorning the cathedral, and improving the revenues of his diocefe. Till his 
time the Bifliop's palace confided of feveral long houfes, of two floors only, 
and covered with thatch, in the Highland form. He built in their place a 
fpacious edifice, fit for defence as well as accommodation. It contained, 
Mill particularly informs his reader, " Granaries and a larder." Although 
no veftige of it remains at prefent, its fite is (till called M the Cajlle Clofe." 
He acquired the lands of Cramond in excambion for Cammo. Catal. of 
Bifi. p. 53. The chartulary of Cambulkenneth, as quoted {Ibid.) men- 
tions that this Bifhop was excommunicated for refuting to comply with the 
formalities of ecclefiaftical procefl'es required by the Pope. He was one of 
the hoftages for the redemption of James I. Toed, t. v. p. 125. He died iu 
1436. It is this Bifhop's monument which is mentioned, p. 421. of the pre- 
ceding Statistical Account, as in the fouth aifle of the cathedral. 

19. DONALD MACNAUGHTAN. He was Dean of Dunkeld, and 
elected by the chapter on the death of Robert ; but King James oppofing 
his appointment, he took a journey to Rome to obtain confirmation from 
the Pope. On this journey he died. Nifbet {Heraldry, p. 419.) gravely 
fays, " Donald Macnaughtan was by James II. raifed to the Epifcopal See 
" of Dunkeld, where he exercifed his Epifcopal function till his death, as 
" in Spottifwood's Hi/lory of the Church of Scotland." It happens unfor- 
tunately for the credit of Mr Nifbet's accuracy, that Spottifwood, in the 
paflage referred to, fays, as already mentioned, that " James oppofed this 
" Bifhop's election, and he died on his way to Rome." Spot. p. 100. 

ao. JAMES KENNEDY. He was the fon of Sir James Kennedy of 
Dunure, by Mary, younger daughter of Robert III. and Queen Annabel. 
In 1440 he was tranflated to St Andrews, became a Privy Counfellor, and 
Chancellor of Scotland, and afterwards one of the Regents of the kingdom,

M. JAMES BRUCE, formerly Rector of Kilrncny in Fife. He became 
Chancellor of the kingdom, and was promoted to the See of Glafgow, but 
died before his tranflation. 

— WILLIAM TURNBULL, was nominated in 1447 to fucceed James 
Bruce in the See of Dunkeld ; and on the death of that Bifliop he was pro- 
moted to be his fucceflbr in that of Glafgow. 

23. JOHN RALSTON, Dean of Dunkeld, and Secretary to the King. 
He was raifed to the See in 1448 ; was afterwards created Lord High Trea- 
furer, and employed in feveral foreign embaffies. Feed. t. ii. p. 242. In 
his zeal to finifli the aifle of the cathedral, which had been begun by Bifliop 
Robert de Cairney, he went daily himfelf, and took with him his occafional 
guefts, to aflift in preparing the {tones for the building. Abbot Mill fays, 
" cum uno vel alio procerum fecum habitantium, folebat certa lapidum 
M onera extra lapicidinam ferre quotidie." This writer adds, that Bifliop 
John died about 1450; but it was in 1452. 

24. THOMAS LAUDER fucceeded. He had been Mailer of the Hof- 
pital of Soutra, and tutor to James n. He got the lands of the Bifhoprick 
which lay on the fouth fide of the Forth erected into a barony, by the name 
of the Barony of Aberlady ; and the lands on the north fide into a barony, 
by the name of the Barony of Dunkeld. Abbot Mill, who lived in Bifhop 
Lauder's time, fays of him : " This venerable Prelate had fuch acquaintance 
f with divinity, that he himfelf preached the faith to his people " Dr 
Bijfefs tranflation, M. S. He died in i43r, having in 1476 refigned the 
See on account of his advanced age. After his resignation, he was ftyled 
" Epifcopns in univerfali ecclefia," 

25. JAMES LIVINGSTON, Re&amp;or of Forteviot and Weem. He 
erected a chaplainry in honour of St Columba, in the church of St Giles in 
Edinburgh. He died in 1483. 

— ALEXANDER INGLIS was next elected by the chapter, but the 
Pope annulled the election. 

— ROBERT appears as Bifliop ef Dunkeld in 1485. Catalogue of Ei- 
Jhops, p. 56. This fact it is difficult to reconcile with the hiftory of Mill, 
who lived at the time, and docs not mention a Bifliop of that name.

26. GEORGE BROWN, Rector of Tynnyngham, confecrated, uj 
cording to Mill, in 1484, at Rome, by Pope Sixtus IV. He was flrift i n 
enforcing ecclefiaftical difciplinc, and active in advancing the temporal in. 
tereit of his Biflioprick. He built the church of Dowally ; and died at his 
houfe on the ifland in the Loch of Cluny, in 15 14.

tor of Heriot, and Provoft of the collegiate church of St Giles in Edin- 
burgh, was preferred by the Pope, and in 15 16 obtained pofleffion of the 
See. He holds an eminent place in the literary hillory of his age. He was 
a profound claflical fcholar, a well informed antiquarian, and an elegant 
poet. Ke wrote, Aurex Narrationes, Comedies aliquot Sacra ; De Re. 
bus Scoticis ; but none of tliefe works have defcended to our times. His 
Palace of Honour, and his Tmnjlation of the JSLneid of Virgil, however, 
ftill remain, and prefent very honourable monuments of both the correct- 
nefs of his tafte, and the vigour of his imagination. Living in dark and 
turbulent times, he enjoyed not the felicity of indulging his genius in fecu- 
rity and repofe. He was involved in the agitations and hazards, of thofe 
commotions with which the difputes of the Queen Mother and the Duke 
■of Albany, and of Arran and Angus, embroiled the kingdom. To avoid 
•ihefe, he retired to England, when he bectme the intimate acquaintance of 
Polydore (Virgil). He died in London of the plague, in 1522, and was 
buried in the Savoy. 

28. ROBERT COCKBURN. In 15714, this Bilhop, with the Earl of 
Caflilis and Abbot Mill, went as Ambafladors from James V. to Hen-

fiaftical conltitution. This agreement was ratified , as an interim regula- 
tion, at a future Aflembly, which met foon after at Perth, In confequence 
of this regulation, James Paton was appointed to the See of Dunkeld.

DOWALLY, 

(County of Perth, Synod of Perth and Stirling,

II. Of Dowally. 



Name. 

THIS parifli is known in the Gaelic language by two 
different names. Dubh-alein, " the Black. Meadow," 
is the word from which the Englifti name Dowally is deri- 
ved ; and Dail-a-Charne, " Haugh of the Cairn," is that by 
Which it is at prefent generally denominated in converfa- 
tion. It is thought to have received the former appella- 
tion, which is now gone into difufe, from the black, heath 
with which the furface of the low grounds was once cover- 
ed

Situation and Extent. 

Dowally was originally a part of the parifh of Caputh, 
and though it is now confidered as uni'ted to Dunkeld, there 
is no evidence exifting of any formal annexation having ta- 
ken place. It is fituated to the weftward of Dunkeld, from 
which it is feparated by an interjected portion of Caputh ; 
and the main-body of it ftretches along the north bank of 
the Tay, in the fhape of a parallelogram, beginning about 
a mile and a half above Dunkeld, and extending fix miles. 
At the upper extremity, the parifh. of Logierait occurs ; and 
a fmall ft ripe of it pafling acrofs Dowally, divides the 
main body mentioned from the barony of Dalcapon, which 
is an appendage belonging to it. This barony lies on the 
north bank of the Tumble, in length three quarters of a 
mile. The breadth of the parifh is uncertain. For as the 
fide of it which is moft remote from the river, confifts en- 
tirely of high, barren, and uninhabited hills, it has never 
been thought of importance to afcertain its line of limit with 
minutenefs. 

An able furveyor, who is well acquainted with the coun- 
try, computes the extent of Dowally, in Scotch acres, as 
follows : 

* When this cairn was removed, it was found to confift entirely of land- v 
llones, and to have in the centre a fingle ftone-coffin, 6 feet in length, and. 
4 in breadth, with a quantity of rich black earth, but no bones within it. 
The cairn was 30 feet in diameter, and about 6 in heighth.

Surface and Soil. 

The rocky hills of King's Seat and Craigy Barns rife orr 
the lower boundary of Dowally. They prefent a very pre- 
cipitous and picturefque appearance towards the eaft. Their 
front has every where been covered with trees, where trees 
could find earth in which to fix their roots ; but the bare 
and bold crags are often feen jutting out, and here and there 
are interfperfed patches, covered with heath. A cottage 
has been built in the midft of a fmall green field, near the 
fummit, in a hollow of the hill, which, catching the eye 
of the traveller, contributes to the pleafing efie3 of the ge- 
neral landfcape. 

King's Seat fprings with a very fudden and fteep afcent 
from the brink of the river ; and the road, which pafles 
through Dowally, and leads to Atholl, has been cut with 
great labour and expence along the bottom of it. The 
road overhangs the river lb clofely, and at fuch a height, 
that the timid traveller, who looks over the wall which has 
been built to fupport it, is difpofed to halten on his way ; 
but as a fange of tall and thick trees intercept the view, 
they conceal the terrors of the fcene, while they add, at the 
fame time, to its fingular beaut}'. When the traveller has 
journeyed upward about two miles from Dunkeld, he 
leaves the Duke of A^holl's policy, and though 110 longer

meeting with planting, he finds natural woods every where 
Ikirting the road, which runs along the declivity. Below 
the road, feveral level haughs run out in different places, to 
fill up the meanders of the river ; and above it, lie fome 
gently Hoping fields, which reach nearly to the fummit of 
the hill. The declivity of the hill is frequently feamed by 
pretty deep ravines. Bridges are thrown acrofs them. Of 
thefe, there are 27 within the length of the parifh of Dow- 
ally. So rapid is the afcent of the declivity, that, in fome 
cafes, while the wall of one fide of the bridge is not 3 feet 
above the furface, the wall of the other is above 30. 

The foil of the haughs is light and fandy ; that of the 
higher fields, upon the brow of the hill, is deeper and 
ftronger, with a flight mixture of clay. The hill is compo* 
fed of fchiftus intermixed with pyrites, and contains fome 
fcattered grains of copper ore. 

Inhabitants. 

Numbers and Age. — By a very accurate lift of the inha- 
bitants, taken in 1790, it appeared that they were in num- 
ber, and of age, as follows : 

Number of fouls, - 687 * 

- males, - 307 

————— females, - 380 

Under 10 years of age, - 172

* In the Statiftical Account of Dunkela* it is faid, that the population 
in 1755 amounted to 1298 ; but this number included the population alfo 
of Dowally, at that period. At prefent, the population of the united pa- 
riflies is 1773. There is an excefs therefore of 475 beyond the population 
of 1755- 



of Dowally. 



4^3 



The whole inhabitants may be confidered as employed 
in agriculture ; for though there is a fmith, two Wrights, and 
two tailors in the parifh, yet all of them, to fome fmall ex- 
tent, are concerned in labouring the ground. There are 
no feparate manufactures yet eftablifhed here. The num- 
ber of inhabitants, compared with the number of acres in 
the parifh, allows 1 to 17 acres. 

Baptifms. — The regifter of baptifms has been kept, and 
with unufual regularity; and from that regifter it appears, 
1, That during a period of 76 years, preceding 1797, there 
have been born 687 males, and 572 females. 2. That 
while the population continued nearly the fame, the num- 
ber of births in different years has differed very widely. In 

1711, 17116, and 1752, the total number was 6; and in 

1712, 1725, and 1751, the years immediately adjoining to 
thefe, they were refpectively 13, 16, and 20. In fome 
years they amounted to 24 ; but the average number may 
be rated at 16. This average number is at the rate of 1 
birth to 43 perfons. 3. That in different years the propor- 
tion of male and female births alfo differs widely. In 1780 
there were 16 males born, and 6 females ; while, in 1782^ 
there were 10 female, and only 7 male births. 4. That, as 
the number of families in the parifh amounts to 164, and 
the number of births annually is 16, there is 1 annual birth 
for each xo families. 

Twins. — From the regifter of baptifm it alfo appears, 
it. That of 1225 children born in this parifh, 34 were 
twins; therefore 1 twin child for every 34 born. 2. That 
of the 34 twins, 23 were males, and 11 females. 3. That 
though it has been concluded from obfervations made in 
other places, that the number of males prevailed in thofe 
years in which male twins were born, and that of the fe- 
males 



4H 



Statiftical Account 



males in thofe years in which female twins were born, yet 
no fuch coincidence appears here. In 1766, 2 twin male 
children were born •, and in that year there were n female, 
and only 10 male births : and in 1794, the number of male 
and female births was equal, and there were 2 twins male, 
and no females born. 

Marriages. — There is a regular regifter of the marriages 
in this parifh for 80 years; from which it appears, 1. That 
the total number of marriages recorded during that period is 
544 •, making the average annual number about 7. 2. That 
there is 1 marriage annually for 98 inhabitants. 3. That 
whether the proportion of baptifms and marriages is taken 
for the whole period, or for any 10 confecutive years, in- 
differently fele&amp;ed, the marriages are lefs than a half, but 
more than a third, of the baptifms. 

Deaths. — Of thefe no regular record has been kept. 

Ecclesiastical State. 

Minifter and SeJJion.' — In the account of Dunkeld the ec- 
clefiaftical ftatiftics of the united parifh.es have already been 
ftated. It is only farther to be mentioned, refpe&amp;ing the 
ftipend of the minifter, that in 175 1, when the General Af- 
fembly authorifed a petition to Parliament for a general 
augmentation of the ftipends of the Clergy of Scotland, they 
fpecified the ftipend of Dunkeld, as one, among others, 
which, from its fcantinefs, furnifhed reafonable grounds for 
their application. It was then ftated at L. 66 : 19 : 9 by the 
Committee of the Affembly ; and even by thofe heritors 
Who oppofed the petition, calculated at no more than L. 79, 
10 s. 7 d. *— The minifter preaches here one diet on the af-

This parifh has a-feffion, a feffion-clerk, and regifler, fepa- 
rate from thofe of Dunkeld, and the poor's funds are kept 
diltind from thofe of the other; 

Church. — It is a long, narrow, inelegant ftni&amp;ure, and 
Tery incommodioufly fe.ited; It was built by Bifhop Brown 
in the year 15CO. " Upon information that the Irifh was 
" fpoken in the Highland parts of the parifh of Caputh, the 
** Bilhop built and endowed a church in honour of the bleff- 
" ed Mother, St Anne *, among the woods of the Church- 
f* lan is of Dowally f." In 1755 it had become ruinous, 
and was then repaired and new-feated at the expence of the 
tenants. 

School. — There is no falary allotted for a parifh fchool- 
xnafter here, by confequence there is no parifh fchobl. For 
many years the Society for Propagating Chriftian Know- 
ledge fixed one of their fchools here, and the good effects of 
it were confpicuous ; but lately they have withdrawn it, 
and at prefent the only fchool in the parifh is taught by one 
of the inhabitants, who is at the fame time a farmer. The 
parimioners lately built a commodious fchool houfe for him, 
and the Duke of Atholl, by giving him his little farm ori 
eafy terms, affords him fuch encouragement, as with the 
fchool-fees, induces him to undergo the labour of teaching.

days when there is no fermon in the church of Dowally. 
Then the parents of the fcholars alfo attend, while the 
fchoolmafter, by examining the young by reading the 
Scriptures, and by prayer, inftru&amp;s and edifies the meeting. 
His merit, both in the eftablifhment and conduct of this 
fchool, is high. He has now taught it for above two yeare 
without falary from any quarter, and almoft without any 
remuneration whatever. 

Poor, and their Funds. — There are no begging poor who 
belong to this parifh, and none who receive a regular perio- 
dical allowance from the feffion.- The people, indeed, from 
a refpeclable pride of fpirit, have a ftrong reluctance to ap- 
ply for aid from the public charity ; and in cafes where ne- 
ceffity compels any individual or family to do fo, it is cufto- 
mary for fome of their neighbours to requeft the authority 
of the feffion for a general collection, to be made for the 
fpecific cafe. The only diftribution of funds that takes 
place, is made annually at the beginning of the winter fea- 
ibn. The feffion then meet, and each elder reports the 
ltate of the moft indigent refiding in his diftrict of the pa- 
rifh. Relief is ordered on the occafion in proportion ro the 
degrees of neceflity ftated ; but there are many inftances of 
the fums fo ordered being refufed. 

The funds of the poor amounted, in 1787, to L. 4 Ster- 
ling. By the accumulated produce of the collection at the

. In 1 783, the inhabitants of Dowally partook of the bene- 
fit of the bounty of the Duke of Atholl, who, (as men- 
tioned in the Account of Dunkeld), bought that year 500 
bolls of meal, and fold it at a reduced price in this diftricl: 
of the dukedom. His Grace, at the fame time, purchafed 
300 bolls of oats, and a large quantity of hay, which was 
difpofed of in a fimilar manner, and proved a molt accept- 
able and beneficial accommodation to many, who bad fuf- 
fered feverely from the inclemencies of the preceding fea- 
fon. He brought alfo feed potatoes from England, and di- 
stributed them gratis to his tenants. Inhabitants of Dow-

Horfes. — The number of horfes in the pari£h is 197. 
They are of a mixed breed, on an average, 12 hands high ; 
and at the ufual rate of fale for fome years paft, may be va- 
lued at L. 12 Sterling. Hitherto, the parifli has not reared 
a fufficient number for its own fupply. The practice of 
rearing foals has now, however, become frequent, and it is 
probable, that in a few years the farmers will be able not 
only to furnifh this fupply, but to afford fome horfes for 
fale.

Black Cattle. — Their number amounts to 506. Their 
average weight, when fat, is about 16 Hone; and their pric« 
from L. 510L.6 Sterling. '1 hey give 5 pints of milk a 
day. Few are reared for fale. Cm Ives, fold at 3 days old 
bring 6 s. ; unci if kept for 3 weeks, from 15 s. to L. 1 Ster- 
ling. When rearing, they are allowed 4 pints of milk a 
day; and at times get a fmallef quantity of milk, and in 
lieu of the remainder fome hay tea. 

The breed of black-cattle here requires improvement ; 
but while the practice of overftouking prevails, and there is 
a deficiency of winter and fpring food, this improvement is 
impracticable. Both of thefe obftacles will, it ii hoped, foon 
be removed. As a proof, however, that they flill operate, 
and check the fpirit which fhould adluate the farmers, it 
was found, that no bull was fent from this diftricT: as a com- 
petitor for the premium allowed by the Highland Society, 
to the proprietor of the beft bull which mould be produced 
there. 

Sheep. — There are 2350 fheep in, the parifh, of a fmall 
white-faced breed. The time of their introduction into this 
part of the country is uncertain ; but from tradition it ap- 
pears to be remote. They are faid to have prevailed before 
the black-faced fheep were brought into the north of Scot- 
land. When fat, their mutton is delicious. Their wool is 
fhort and fine ; fells from 16 s. to L. x Sterl.^r ffone. The , 
wedders and aged ewes are fold at an annual fair held at 
Kilmorich, a village in the parifh, and bring about J s. No 
cheefe is ever made here from ewe milk. The whole fheep 
belonging to the parifh feed promifcuoufly on the hill. 
They are driven to that pafhire at the beginning of fummer, 
and are brought back to the low grounds after harveft, 
where they have been permitted, from the want of inclo- 
fures, to wander at large through the woods, and over the

arable fields, during the winter and the fpring. Some of 
them, indeed, are houfed at that time in the night, and thefe 
the tenants do not fmear. They fmear, however, all thofe 
which are not houfed. The latter are feldom fubjeft to that 
difeafe c.dled by fheep-farmers the poke, (a fwelling under 
the jaw), or to the fcab ; but the former are frequently vi- 
fited by both. The poke, particularly, often proves fatal. 
Hitherto no rate of proportion has been eftabliOied betwixt 
the number of arable acres which a tenant pofTeffes, and the 
number of fheep he may keep upon the common pafture. 
Each keeps as many as his convenience or inclination 
prompts. The poflefibr of 8 acres has fometimes in the hill 
fheep to the amount of double the number of the poffefTor 
of 16 acres. Sheelings are lefs numerous and lefs frequent- 
ed than formerly, becaufe the milch-cows are notfent there, 
as they once were, in fummer with the fheep. All the 
lambs in this parifh are reared for fale as ewes or wedders. 

Swine. — Many families fatten one or two fwine in au- 
tumn with potatoes, and with, at times, a fmall mixture of 
oats. Thefe they kill and cure for ufe, during the labours 
of the fpring. They are of a hardy, but a fmall-fized breed, 
feeding to about 9 {tone weight on an average, and may be 
valued at L. 1, 10 s. 

Poultry. — No attention is paid to poultry, as an article 
0/ food or of fale. Some geefe are reared, which in June 
are fent to Loch Ordie, a lake amid the hills, in the back 
parts of the parifh, where, without any perfon to protecl: or 
feed them, they live till the end of harveft, and then are 
brought back to fatten on the ftubble fields. They are fold 
at 2 s. 6 d.

Red Deer , — (Cervus elaphus), appear in this parilh of 
late, during the hard frofts and deep fnovvs which in winter 
drive them from the high mountains, where they pafture in 
fummer. The multiplication of this fpecies of deer, fince 
the Duke of Atholl has fo particularly protected them, ac- 
counts for their being feen here more frequently of late 
years than formerly. His Grace has a tract of 100,000 
acres referved chiefly for them, and it is computed that not 
lefs than 4000 feed there conflantly. The fize of the deer 
has increafed with the improvement of their pafture. Some 
have been {hot which weighed above 18 flone. It would 
not be difficult for the Duke to furnifh a royal hunt, more 
fplendid than that given by one of his predeceflors in for-

vived for a few days only. One, however, lived two years. 
It was kept in general with the fallow deer in the park at 
Atholl Houfe, but was alfo led, at times, to the fummit of 
the higheft mountains in the neighbourhood, where the li- 
chen, which forms the favourite food of the fpecies in their 
native regions, is found in plenty. This lichen is the //- 
chen rangiferinus of Linnaeus, or the rein deer liver-wort. 

Rabhits. — There is a rabbit warren in this parifh. It is. 
in a low fandy haugh, two miles to the weftward of Dun- - 
keld, and has been let at L. 25 Sterling of rent. On an 
average, 125 dozen were killed by the taekfman yearly. . 
The Ikins may be valued at 6 s. a dozen, and the body fells . 
at the rate of 5 d. per pair. To prevent the rabbits from . 
injuring the plantations near them, by ftripping the bark in 
a fevere winter, branches of trees were lopped off and 
thrown into the warren. This precaution had the defired 
effeft. 

Hares abound here. The lepus variabilis, as well as the 
lepus timidus, is to be met with, though in general this fpe- 
cies prefers the tops of the higheft mountains.

Crops and Culture. 

Till within thefe few years, the ftate of agriculture in 
this pariih was extremely rude. Four horfes were often 
feen working abre.ut in the fame plough, and the driver in 
front of them, walking backwards. The plough was of a 
clumfy construction, with unwieldy wooden mould-boards. 
The farmer, whatever the ftate of the weather was, obfti- 
nately adhered to the immemorial practice of beginning to 
plough on Old Candlemas Day, and to fow on the 20th of 
March. Summer fallow, turnip crops, and fown grafs, were 
unknown; fo were compoft dunghills, and the purchasing of 
lime. Clumps of brufhwood, and heaps of ftones, every 
where interrupted and deformed the fields. The cuftomary 
rotation of their general crops was, I. Barley, 2. Oats ; 
3. Oats; 4. Barley; and each year they had a part of the 
farm employed in raifing flax. The operations refpecting 
thefe took place in the following fucceffion. They began 
on the day already mentioned to rib the ground, on which 
they intended to fow barley, that is, to draw a wide fur- 
row, fo as merely to make the land, as they termed it, red. 
In that ftate this ground remained, till the fields affigned to 
oats were ploughed and fown. This was in general accom- 
plished by the end of April. The fanner next proceeded 
to prepare for his flax crop, and to fow it, which occupied 
him till the middle of May, when, he began to harrow, and 
dung, and fow, the ribbed barley land. This laft was fome- 
times not finilhed till the month of June. 

It was not difficult for an enlightened obferver to trace 
the caufes which produced and had perpetuated this rude 
ftate of agricultural practice. Where there are burdenfome 
fervices to be performed by the tenant ; where there is no 
inclofing, and no winter herding ; where leafes are fhort, 
and where the farm of one tenant confifts of difconne&amp;ed 

patches, 



o/Dowally.

patches, lying interfperfed with the patches of other tenants, 
it is impoffible that in any cafe agriculture Ihould advance 
in improvement*. Some of thefe obftacles exifted in Dow- 
ally, and the Duke of Atholl, who is the fole proprietor of 
the pariflj, faw, and fought to remove them. It is pleafing 
to add, that his Grace's plans for this purpofe have been 
fuccefsful, and that while his rent has been confiderably 
heightened, both the face of the country, and the condition 
of the tenantry, have been at the fame time fenfibly melio- 
rated. 

The new arrangements reflecting the crops and the cul- 
ture of the parifh, drew their efficacy from the five follow- 
ing rules, which they eftabliftied : x. That each tenant mould 
have the fields of his farm contiguous to each other, and be 
encouraged to inclofe them : 2, That all burdenfome fervices 
fhould be abolilhed : 3. That fheep Ihould be excluded from 
the low grounds in winter : 4. That leafes of due length 
fhould be granted : And, 5. That a proper rotation of crops 
fhould be prefcribed. 

In confequence of thefe rules being adopted in the laft 
leafes, each farmer now feels himfelf at liberty to cultivate 
his little pofleflion, fafe from the rifk of interference or dif- 
pute with his neighbours, or from the hurt of being poached 
by their catttle. He has no fervice to perform to the pro- 
prietor, but the eafy one, of driving 12 cwt. of coals from 
Perth to Atholl Houfe for each ploughgate yearly. He has 
a leafe, (extending to 19 or 21 years), which allows and en- 
courages 

* The Highlander labours under other general difadvantages in this re- 
fpecl. Having little intercourfe with the low country, he has few op- 
portunities of feeing the improved modes of culture pra&amp;ifed there ; and 
even when he does cafually fee them, his ignorance of the language of 
the improver prevents his gaining any minute or beneficial acquaintance 
with them.

courages brrn to apply all his fkill and capital to the culti- 
vation of his farm,' from the confidence it gives him, that he 
will have -in opportunity of enjoying the fruits of their ap- 
plication. In confluence of the lad rule particularly, he 
has the produce of his white crops materially increafed, and 
what he never had before the command of, winter and 
fpring provender £or his cattle. 

The rotation of crops which theory might (hew would be 
the mod perfectly fuited to the foil, cannot be reduced to 
practice from the fmallneis of the farms. But the beft law 
of rotation has been given them which they are able to 
bear. It is ftipulated as the leading regulation, that one- 
rifth part of each farm mail be always in clover and rye- 
grafs, and another in fummer fallow, or fome green crop. 
The reft of the ground is left to white crops and flax. 

The tenants were themfelves aftoniflied at the Unking 
cfleo; of the alteration in their mode of culture, and they 
became zealous to profecute the advantages prefented by 
their leafes. Stones, brufliwood, wet, and wafle fpots, 
wMch had exifled for ages, to the reproach of the farmer, 
and the lofs of the public, began to difappear ; and it is not 
now to be doubted, that a few years will fee them com- 
pletely fwept from the face of the country. A greater 
lfre'tch of improvement has taken place during the laft 15 
years, than during a century preceding. 

The light fandy foil of the haughs bears plentiful crops of 
turnip. Potatoes yield in general 30 bolls per acre, and 
oats, which yielded formerly not more than 4 bolls, yield 
now 8. Birley may be eftimated at nearly the fame rate 
of produce. From a peck of flax-feed fown, there are, on 
an average, 3 ftones (Dutch weight) of drefi'ed fl3x. Each 
tenant of a half plough gate fows 3 pecks of flax-feed yearly. 
They begin now to -keep their own feed far fowiug, and

Their crop of it is always beft after grafs. 

No great proportion of the oats and barley raifed in the 
parilh are fold. The rents are paid almoft exclufively from 
the price of the yarn fpun by the women during winter *. 

When the farmer is not employed in the culture of his 
crop, he is employed through a great part of the fummer in 
providing fuel. After the fowing of his barley is finifhed, 
which happens generally in the beginning of June, he goes 
to the mofs, with the whole men, women, children, and 
horfes, of the farm •, nor is it before the middle or end of 
July that he is able, (though the time depends much on the 
nature of the feafon, as favourable or unfavourable to the 
drying of the peats), to prepare and lead home a fufficient 
quantity. Their moffes are not at a great diftance, and the 
roads to them are tolerably good, yet ftill this is found a 
laborious, inconvenient, and, after all, a very precarious 
way of obtaining fuel. It feems probable that the farmers 
will foon fee it for their advantage to drive coals from 
Perth, for a part, if not the whole, of the fuel they re- 
quire f.

f In wet feafons the fanners are unable to procure a due iupply for their 
own family confurnption. This failure is felt in Dunkeld as well as here; 
for the poor there rely, in fome meafure, for fuel in the winter on the peau 
which are occafionully for fate from the farmer's furplus flock ; and when 
peats are fenrce, they laid coals too extravagantly high-priced for their {len- 
der finances. It would- be of great benefit to. the poor o'i Dunkeld, if a fc- 
ciety were formed fur purchafing coals in fummer, when they are at the 
lowed price in Perth, and for laying them up, and felling them at the ori- 
ginal colt in winter. This would be great charity zl fmall cxpence.

When the peats of the year are ftored up, the hay-harveft 
begins. By the middle of Auguft, or earlier, the flax is 
ready to be pulled, and the ripling, watering, and preparing 
it for the mill, occupies all hands till the 15th or 20th of 
September, when the barley is ripe for cutting. The la- 
bours of reaping and houfing their crops now commence, 
and they proceed till they are clofed by the railing of the 
potatoes, in the end of October or beginning of November. 
From this time, till they begin to rib the ground for their 
barley crop in fpring, the men have no feverer employment 
than thrafliing for daily ufe the fcanty quantity of ftraw 
which the cattle require, and for carrying to them what 
other provender their improved cultivation has enabled 
them to preferve for that feafon. 

Excepting the barony of Dalcapon, all the lands in the 
parifh are thirled to the mill of Dowally. The multure 
paid is 6 lippies of (heeling for the boll, and 1 lippie befides 
to the miller. 

Oak Woods. 

The computed extent of the oak woods has been already 
ftated. The Duke of Atholl caufes his woods to be cut 
every 25 th year only. Other neighbouring proprietors cut 
theirs every 20th year. The value of oak woods has in- 
creafed of late very rapidly. In this parifh there is a re- 
markable inftance of this. The wood of Gauy, at 3 fuc- 
ceflive fales, within a period of 50 years, reckoning from 
the date of the firft to the date of the laft fale, was difpofed 
of by roup at the following prices: iff Sale, L. 166 - r 
2d Sale, L. 551 ; and 3d Sale, L. 1262. In fome cafes, the 
price has been equal to L. 54 per acre ; but the average 
price per acre may be rated at L. 40. This affords a high 
rent for the ground, even for every year during which it 

has

has been unprodu&amp;ive. At the laft fale of Gauy, this rent 
was not lefs than L. 2, io s. per acre. 

The cutting of oak woods begins about the middle of 
May, and is finifhed by the middle of July. Old trees are 
peeled before they are cut down, to prevent the lofs of 
bark, which might otherwife happen in the a£fc of cutting. 
Men employed in peeling have I s. a day, and women 7 d. 
The bark in this neighbourhood, after fupplying the tan- 
yards in Dunkeld, is fold to Perth, Forfar, and Dundee. It 
fells fo high as 1 s. 3 d. a ftone *. 

River and Loch. 

The rent of the falmon-fifliing in the Tay, oppofite to 
this parifli, may be rated at L. 27 Sterling. The falmon 
caught here are fold to Perth, and from thence are fent to 
the London market. The following are the prices paid, of 
late years, for them per lb. viz. early in fpring, 8 d. ; in 
April, 6 d. ; in May, 4 d. ; and during the remainder of the 
feafon, 3 d. The average weight of a Tay falmon here is 
18 lb. Dutch weight. One, however, was caught which 
weighed 63 lb. 3 oz. 

Some years ago, mtijfels were gathered in the bed of the 
river in confiderable numbers, for the fake of the pearls 
they contained. Crowds of people were feen daily wander- 
ing in fearch of them. But a London dealer, who had pur- 
chafed the pearls, becoming bankrupt, with the price in his 
hands, the fpirit of this traffic was damped, and has not 
again revived. Several pearls then found were fold for 
10 s. 6 d. and one brought 13 s. 

Loch Ordie abounds with trout and eel. It is a favourite 
refort of anglers from Dunkeld, who have often agreeable 
reafon to remember the amufement which its banks afford.

Price of Wages and Produce. 

The price of butchers meat, and other articles of provi- 
fion, may be reckoned at the fame rates here as in Dun- 
keld, it being the only market for them to which the pa- 
rifhioners can go. Of grain, the prices per boll are, for 
barley, 15s.; for oats and for peafe, 14s.; for meal, 15 s. 
Wool is fold at different rates, from 6 s. to L. 1 per ftone ; 
peats at 1 s. 3 d. per cart. Of wages, the rate is for a man- 
fervant from L. 8 to L. 10 per anmi?n  ; and of a woman, 
from L. 3 to L. 4 ; of a mafon, 1 s. 6 d. a-day ; of a tailor, 
6 d. with his meat ; of a man during harveff, 1 s. ; and of a 
woman at that time, 6d. both with their meat. 

Progress of Manners, &amp;c. 

In 1778, there were not 4 houfes in the pariffi where tea 
was ufed ; now, (in 1798) it is ufed in every houfe. 
Then, there was not a hat worn by any of the tenants, or 
their fervants ; now, there are many. Then, there was not 
one black cap; now, all the women wear them. Then, 
the gowns of the women were camblet, and their aprons 
woollen; now, the gowns are of printed linen, and the 
aprons of white muffin. Then, many of the men wore the 
philibeg ; now, there are none who do fo. Then, all of 
them had tartan hofe ; now, all have ftockings. Then, in 
fhort, the whole articles of the drefs of the peoph were 
home-made, excepting their bonnets, and a few flioes ; now, 
they are all bought from the merchants of Dunkeld. 

General Remarks. 
It may be thought that the fize of the farms in this pa- 
riili might be enlarged with advantage to the proprietor, 
for that fewer, both of men and horfes than are at prefent 
employed, would be equal to the cultivation of the foil, and 

that 



of Dow ally.

that a reduction of their number would permit a greater 
quantity of rude produce to go to market, and by confe- 
quence a higher rent to be paid. But there is a miftake ia 
this thought. The prefent rent is paid, not from the faje of 
rude produce, but from the fale of a part of that produce, 
manufactured by houfehold labour. If the fize of the farms 
was enlarged, there is no doubt that from the confequent 
depopulation, an increafed quantity of rude produce would 
be fent to market, but then the quantity of manufacturing 
houfehold labour would, from the fame caufe, be diminifh- 
ed. Now, it is apprehended, that the gain from the former 
' circumftance would not do more (if it did fo much) than 
compenfate the lofs fuftained by the latter. For the manu- 
facturing labour, it will be found, adds fo great an increafe 
of value to the rude produce, as will not only fupport the 
expence of the greater number of individuals who exert it, 
but alfo the want of the price of that increafed quantity of 
produce which would be raifed by their removal. In the pre- 
fent ftate of things, therefore, no material rife of rent could 
be expected by the proprietor, from the enlargement of the 
fize of farms in this parifh. 

As to the Highlands in general, for it does not refpedt 
Dowally, the public, as well as the proprietors, would de- 
rive fignal advantage, not fo much from the enlargement 
of old farms, as from the formation of new ones. Immenfe 
tracts of ground in fome diftricts, and fmall patches in 
others, may be found, which never felt the impreffion of 
either the fpade or the plough. Every where let thefe be 
cultivated. Perhaps the plan which would fecure this cul- 
tivation of thefe wafte grounds moft fpeedily and univerfal- 
ly, would be for proprietors to offer portions of them, of a 
proper extent, in leafe, free of rent for fome years, and af-

tenvards at a rent gradually riling, to fuch as would engage 
to cultivate them according to prefcribed regulations. 
Were the leafc made of confiderable length, and transfer- 
able by the tenant, after he had improved the ground, on 
his taking a new lot, the plan would not fail to be eagerly 
embraced ; and if it were fo, great and manifold benefits 
would refult ; emigration would be prevented ; the popu- 
loufnefs of the Highlands would increafe ; the value of 
cltates would be railed, (and this not merely in proportion 
to the increafed value of wafte ground made arable, but in, 
proportion to the increafed value which pafture grounds 
would receive, from the additional winter food for cattle, 
which would be obtained) ; a greater quantity of fubfiftence 
would thus, too, be produced for the community*. 

Hints for Improvements in Agriculture. 

The ftipulations mentioned formerly as inferted in the 
leafes, are all judicious ; it would be beneficial to add the 
following : Si That a fpecified extent of ground fhould be 
well inclofed, and regularly and carefully cultivated as a 
kitchen-garden. In this the tenant could make, on a fmali 
fcale, experiments, to be afterwards, if fuccefsful, applied to 
his fields. The produce of it would greatly improve the 
diet of the people. 2. That no ft raw fhould be employed

* Under this article, refpecling improvements in agriculture, it ought to 
be mentioned, that the Duke of Atholl has inftituted on his eilate plough- 
ing matches, where premiums in money, or medals which were itruck for 
the purpofe, with appropriate emblems and inferiptions, are bellowed on 
the fuccelVYil competitors. This is the beginning, merely, of an extenlive 
fcheme which his Grace has formed, for encouraging funilar competitions 
of (kill and itiduftry in all the branches of agricultural occupations both in 
the boufe and the neld.

in thatching houfes. Thatching with it Waftes the fupply 
of provender which they have for their cattle. Flax is a 
more durable material for this purpofe, when properly ap- 
plied to the roof, and ultimately lefs expenfive. The Sta- 
tistical Account of Kilmarnock, publifhed in this work, con- 
tains fome ufeful information on this point. 3. The trifling 
fervice to which the tenants are bound, and the cafualties 
they pay in kind, fhould, at their option, be commutable 
into money. The propofal for this commutation proceeds 
on a principle which ought never to be forgotten or depart- 
ed»from, viz. that every tenant mould poffefs the conftant 
arW the unfettered command of his time, labour, and 
flock. 

The diff.incT.ion of outfield and infield fhould be abolifhed. 
The following plan promifes to effecT: this abolition fpeedi- 
ly, and not only without lofs during the time of executing 
it, but with great gain afterwards. Let the infield be em- 
ployed folely in railing green horfe-hoed crops, and let the 
manures made on the farm, or purchafed, be applied to the 
outfield. On the latter, as it is in general overrun with an- 
nual weeds, and in bad tilth, the farmer fhould begin his 
train of culture by fumrner-fallowing. This fummer-fallow 
he fhould lime. Then, in fucceeding years, let him adopt 
this courfe of crops : i. Oats ; 2. Peafe, or potatoes, or tur- 
nip, which muft be horfe-hoed ; 3. Barley and grafs feeds; 
4. Hay; 5. (And if poflible 6.), Pafture. In this courfe 
there is no expenfive outlay, and the lofs of one crop, on 
fuch proportion as in any one year may be fallowed, will 
be amply compenfated by the meliorating influence the fal- 
low produces, not on the firlt crop only which fucceeds it, 
but oh feveral crops to come. A Swedifh gentleman, of 
great agricultural experience and fkill, told the compiler of 
this paper, that after many trials refpefting the mofl bene- 
ficial

ttcial mode of cropping his grounds, he had reformed to the 
practice of fallowing his fields every fecond year. This 
practice, he added, not only had enabled him to fubdue the 
tendency of the ground to be covered with annual weeds, 
(a tendency which, in Sweden, is peculiarly ftrong), but 
gives him, at an average, a better return from the one crop 
which he takes, than any of his neighbours have, on equally 
good foil, in their two crops without fallow. 

Change of feed could not fail to be highly beneficial as 
an improvement in the farming of Dowally. In the 
change of feed, the farmer mould attend particularly to this 
consideration, that that new feed will thrive beft with hife, 
which he gets from a climate and foil oppofite in nature to 
his own. 

As foon as his white crops are removed from the fields 
to the barn-yard, he ought to begin to plough them. By 
this plan he will find the labours of the fpring made more 
eafy, and the ground will be reduced to a finer tilth, and at 
the fame time fertilized by the erlfefts of the winter's frofts. 
Often, in the Highlands, the ground receives but one fur- 
row, after lying unploughed till March or April. This 
happens even if the ground is lee. Where this is the prac- 
tice, no one need be furprifed to fee it in bad tilth, prolific 
of weeds, and yielding a more abundant crop of grafs than 
of the grain that happens to be fown on it. In very fteep 
grounds, indeed, autumnal tillage Ihould not be attempted, 
as the violent winter rains would warn off the foil. In eve- 
ry other cafe, it will not fail to be beneficial, and to increafe 
the quantity of produce. 

The time of fowing the different grains ought to be more 
early in the feafon than it is at prefent. Able agricultu- 
rists are of opinion, that little hazard would attend oats 
or barley, even if they were fown in autumn. They 

are 



of Dowally.

are thought to be fufficiently hardy to withftand the feveri- 
ties of the winter. But whatever folidity may be in this 
opinion, (which might and ought to undergo the teft of ex- 
periment), it feems certain, that they would be fafe if fown 
in February, or early in March. If they were fown at that 
early period of the fpring, one great advantage would refult, 
they would ripen at an earlier period of autumn, and thus 
the inconveniences and lofles of a late harveft would be 
avoided. Befides, long and general experience has proved, 
that the grain of a crop which has been early fown and ear- 
ly ripened, is better than that of a crop which in both thefe 
refpecls has been later. 

The Blainflie oats, the Friefland, which ripens 3 weeks 
earlier than the Blainflie, but is fliaken more eafily, and the 
Tartarian, which, though rather later than the other two, 
is more prolific than either, and relifts the moft fhaking 
winds •, thefe oats ought to be preferred to all other for feed 
in this climate and foil. 

Four rowed barley, and the 6 rowed where it can be pro- 
cured, are fuperior to the double-rowed, for Dowally ; and 
winter rye fhould be fown in place of fpring rye. The for- 
mer yields the richeft crop, the grain is better, and the 
ftraw ftronger. 

Wheat fhould not be attempted in this foil. 

Vetches may be fown on a barley or oat-ftubble, if the 
field can be prepared for them by the middle of September. 
They will afford a convenient fupply of green provendefl, 
at a time when it is much needed, and if turnip follows 
them, the farmer, in the courfe of two years, will have from 
the field three crops. 

Ruta baga, or Swedi/h turnip, ought to be introduced, as 
a moft valuable plant. It thrives with the fame culture as 
the common turnip. Being a biennial, it never flowers the

firft year. It is heavier, and the fame quantity of confe- 
quence goes farther as food. It ftands the fevereft froft 
without injury, and in February, March, and April, never 
fails to be in found order for ufe. The foliage makes a 
good fubftitute for greens to the table, till the plant flowers 
in the fecond year, and even after it has fhot, the root re- 
mains folid and palatable. Lad winter (1797-8) the com- 
piler of this paper pulled a number of thefe turnips, and left 
them expofed in the open air till the month of March, and 
found them perfectly uninjured. What were allowed to 
remain in the ground threw out a luxuriant foliage early) 
and the roots, even till the beginning of May, retained their 
firmnefs and tafte. 

Mangel-wurzel, or root of fcarcity, promifes alfo to be a 
ufeful green crop. It is a variety of the garden beet, but 
preferable to them as an article of food for cattle. Laft fea- 
fon a quantity of the feed of this plant was fown in drills, 
la the middle of thefe, a fingie drill of red beet, and another 
of white beet, was planted, and it was evident that they and 
the mangel-wurzel were plants of the lame clafs. The 
leaves of the latter were cut four times in the courfe of the 
feafon, and were mod greedily devoured both by pigs and 
milch-cows. In autumn, the roots, though lefs than thofe 
of fuch as had not been cut at all, were ftill of confiderable 
lize. They do nor ftand a fevere froft. 

Red yams, which yield large crops in almoft every foil, 
and in all climates, ought to be tried. If planted in April, 
they may be raifed in October. Cattle eat then? with fuch 
voracity, that it is not fate to give them a full feed of them 
at once. Cow-feeders, in Edinburgh, prefer them to almoft 
every other food for their milch-cows. 

Potatoes it is unnec^ffary to recommend. Their value is 
already fully felt. It may be hinted, however, that the

practice of railing them by lazy beds ought not to be em- 
ployed, when they are to be planted on new or wild ground. 
The fpade reclaims fuch ground better than the plough, and 
if the furface is rough with herbage, the expence of dung i s 
faved. 

Irrigation, or the watering of pafture and heath grounds, 
mould be tried, wherever it is practicable. The operation 
is eafy, not expenfive, and will have certain fuccefs in im- 
proving grafs and extirpating heath. The Dowally farmer 
fees proof of this fuccefs before him. On the eaft end of a 
little ifland, near Kilmorich, there is always a better and 
more luxuriant fward of grafs than on any other part of it, 
and the obvious caufe of the fuperiority is, that that end is 
occafionally overflowed by the Tay, which happens to 
form, from the fituation of the place, when the river is 
high, a meet of (till water upon it. It is no objection to 
the plan in queftion, that the Tay and the Tumble often 
overflow part of the haughs near their banks, and ioftead of 
improving, defolate them, by depofiting the gravel they 
have torn from the mountains. The plan does not recom- 
mend the' employment of torrents for its purpofes. It re- 
commends the making water to fiagnate, for a time, on le- 
vel grounds, and to draw furrows along grounds that flope, 
in which the water may be led in very {lender ftreams, and 
which it may be made to overflow at fuch points, and in 
fuch quantity, as, without breaking it, to irrigate or moiften 
the whole furface %

voir, out of which they mould be carefully, from time to 
time, thrown upon it. Putrid water from ftagnant pools 
and ditches, and the weeds growing in them, mould be mix- 
ed with peat-earth and lime, into a comport. If whins, 
heath, ragwort, thirties, docks, coarfe grafs, and all that mul- 
titude of ufelefs and injurious weeds which are feen by eve- 
ry way-fide, and along every hedge, are cut, and burnt in 
clofe jires, it will be found that the afhes of them are va- 
luable for the fame purpofe. So is fpent tanner's bark, de- 
cayed vegetables, foap-ley, and many other articles which, 
becaufe each fingly feems of a trifling moment, are neglect- 
ed by the farmer, though the beft effects would arife from 
the mafs of manure which the whole, when carefully mix- 
ed, would form, in addition to what is cuftomarily produced 
on the farm. Ex minimis maxima.

The farms are in general overftocked with horfes. Many 
of thefe might be difpofed of, and oxen fubftituted, to the 
number neceflary, in their ftead. Oxen are fit for all the 
operations of a Dowally farm, would be lefs expenfive to 
keep, and would not fall off in value during the years it 
might be proper to work them.

There is frequently a want of milk for the rearing of 
calves in fpring. No fubftitute can be found fo nutritive as 
this natural food to the young animal, but any fubftitute 
which will help to preferve the life of fome who might 
without it be loft, or which will fave milk, to the family, 
when neceflary for making butter or cheefe, is valuable. 
Hay tea, or a ftrong decoclion of hay, anfwers this purpofe 
better than any other. In fpring 1796, the compiler of this 
paper reared 10 calves; and in fpring and fummer 1797, 
he reared 21, chiefly by the ufe of hay-tea, with fuch a pro- 
portion of milk as could be fpared from the produce of two 
cows, (which were all he had, and from which his family 
were fupplied, at the fame time, with cream and butter. 
To a calf of the largeft Lothian breed, he generally began 
by giving from 3 to 4 pints a-day of milk, with as much 
hay-tea as it was difpofed to take. This was continued for 
8 days ; for the next 8 days, the quantity of milk daily gi- 
ven with the hay-tea, was reduced to 2 pints ; and for a 
third fpace of 8 days, to 1 pint, after which it received 
hay-tea only. To a calf of the Highland breed, a fmaller 
proportion of both milk and hay-tea would be required. 
For the hay-tea, the proportion of ingredients was 5 lb. 
good hay to 6 pints of water. Thefe were boiled, (for 
boiling is to be preferred to fteeping it), tiil the decoftion 
amounted to about 4 pints. 

As the Duke of Atholl, by his new arrangements, ftipu- 
lates that the fheep fhall remain during winter in the hill, 
it will be neceffary to improve the prefent breed, or to in- 
troduce a new one, ftronger and more hardy. Perhaps the 
former is moft advifable. The v prefent ftock is habituated 
to the climate and the pafture, and their fize may be increa- 
sed by a careful attention to feleft the bed of them as 
breedersj

Hints for Improvement of Oak Woods. 

The great body of the woods fhould be furrounded with 
a ftone dyke, and no cattle ever permitted to enter them. 
This, at leaft, is a good general rule, and ought never to be 
departed from, except in cafes where circumftances render 
the purchale of paflure, however expenfive, abfohitely ne- 
ceffiiry. All vacant fpaces fhould be planted with woods 
fuited to the foil. If this is done, and the ftool of oak is of 
due clofenefs, the pafture in the wood muft indeed be at 
leaft but infignificant. 

Probably 20 years is nearly the belt period at which to 
cut oak woods. When at that age, the ftocks, on an ave- 
rage, are about 14 inches in diameter, and then they ceafe 
to fend out young fhoots. If the bark, therefore, is the 
principal ingredient in the value of the wood, a fmall in- 
crease only in its quantity is to be expe&amp;ed after this, and 
permitting the trees to ftand longer, cannot be confidered as 
profkableo 

Miscellaneous Facts. 

The Gaelic language is fpoken univerfally in this parilh, 
though all the people, at the fame time, underftand more or 
lefs perfectly the Englilh. It is a curious fact, that the hills 
of King's Seat and Craigy Barns, which form the lower 
boundary of Dowally, have been for centuries the fepara- 
ting barrier of thefe languages. In the firft houfe below 
them, the Englifti is, and has been fpoken ; and the Gaelic 
in the firft houfe, (not above a mile diftant), above them. 

The valued rent of the pariflx is L. 1390 : 2 : 2. The 
real rent may amount to about L. 500. As the farms are 
of fmall fize, not exceeding from L. 5 to L. 1 j each of rent,

the tenants are very numerous. But it is equally honour- 
able to them and to their landlord, that for a long tract of 
years there have been no arrears on the day of payment. 

In a land bank, by the fide of the river, fome particles 
of gold-duft have been difcovered. A few fmall trinkets were 
made of it ; but the quantity of gold is fo fmall, and the ex- 
pence of extracting fo great, that no attention is paid to the 
difcovery. 

Near the village of Dowally, there are three large Hones 
Handing, which appear to be the remains of a Druidica! 
circle. There are no other antiquities in the parifh. 

There is at prefent here a girl who was born deaf, and is 
dumb. One cannot look at her without being furprifed, by 
that extent of knowledge fhe feems to have acquired, and 
without lamenting, at the fame time, that public benevo- 
lence has not yet, amid all its works of charity, erected a 
feminary, where the poor of that unfortunate clafs of our 
fellow creatures to which me belongs, may receive the blef- 
fings of inftruction. She is at prefent fupported by the cha- 
rity of an excellent and refpectable inhabitant of the parifh, 
to whom the helplefs and the miferable never applied in 
vain. 

Character of the People. 

The people are hardy, laborious, temperate, and fenfible. 
They are regular and devout in their attendance on the 
ordinances of religion ; cheerful in their intercourfe with 
each other; and humane to the needy. 

In a letter from the Reverend Mr Niven of Dunkeld, it 
is faid, " I have this day (17th May 1798) remitted above 
f L. 100 Sterling to the Bank, as a voluntary contribution 
" from Dunkeld and Dowally for the. fupport of Govern- 
f ment. I think," he adds with a natural and an affectionate

<p>Introduction. 

HAVING concluded the Statiftical Account of Scot- 
land, with the hiftory of my native parifh, namely, 
that of Thurfo, in the county of Caithnefs, I have thought 
it proper to throw off fome extra copies of that work, to be 
diftributed among my friends. It was my intention, in- 
deed, to have drawn it up as a model for parochial reports, 
■fhould a general ftatiftical furvey, be ever again undertaken, 
in this, or in any other country. But, unfortunately, my 
time has been fo much occupied with a variety of public

avocations, that it has not been in my power, notwithftand- 
ing the valuable affiflancc of Major Rofe, of the Thurfo Vq. 
lunteers. of Mr Nicolfon, the minifter, of Dr John William- 
fon, and of feveral other gentlemen, to collect all the matt- 
rials necefiary for fo extenfive a work. The reader, how- 
ever, will ealily perceive, from the following /ketch, what I 
confider to be the bell plan of arrangement, for the flatiftical 
account of any parifh, more efpecially where a town and a 
country diftrict arc united. 



CHAP. I. PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS. 

SsCT. I. Origin of the Name. — To trace the origin of 
the names, by which particular places are diftinguifhed, is 
undoubtedly more a matter of curiofity, than of real ufe. 
At the fame time, as fuch inquiries tend to throw light on 
the former ftate, and the ancient hiftory of a country, and 
at any rate, yield a pleafing 'and innocent fource of literary 
amufement, they ought not to be neglected, in the flatiftical 
account of a diftrict ; and indeed no country of the fame 
extent, furnifhes a more curious field of inveftigation, in this 
rtfpect, than Scotland, in confequence of the variety of lan- 
guages, from which the names of places have been derived ; 
a coloured map explanatory of which, would give, at one 
glance, fome idea of the great diverfity which prevails in 
this part of the ifland. Many of the names are undoubtedly 
modern Englifh ; but in the fouthern part of Dumfries-ftiire, 
and on the coaft of the Lothians, they are principally deri- 
ved from the old Saxon. Through the greater part of the reft 

of 



of Thurfo. 



495 



of Scotland, they are of Celtic extraction ; but along the fea- 
coaft of Caithnefs, and throughout all the northern and ma- 
ny of the weftern iflands, they are evidently Danifh, Nor- 
wegian, or Icelandic, different dialeds of the fame tongue, 
which was fpoken by a variety of tribes or nations, who, in 
ancient times, difturbed by their predatory attacks, and af- 
terwards held in their poffeffion, all that part of Scotland. 

The derivation of Thurfo, or more properly Thotfaa, as 
it is fpelt by the Icelandic hiftorians, is ealily afcertained. 
In that language, an fignifies a great river, and it was in 
this parifh, that the principal river in the neighbourhood, 
to which they had prefixed the name of their great deity 
Thor, flowed into the fea. From the river, the fame name 
extended itfelf to the town, which was built at its mouth, 
to the neighbouring bay, and to the furrounding diftncL 
In the Gaelic, the town is called Iner, or Liver Thurfo, 
from its being fituated at the mouth of the river. 

Sect. II. Situation and Extent. — The town of Thurfo 
is fituated, on the north- weft fide of the coaft of Caithnefs, 
at the top of a fpacious and beautiful bay, where the river 
Thurfo runs into it. The figure of the parifh is irregular, 
as will appear from the annexed map. The great body of 
the parifh is bounded by the parifh of Olrig, on the fouth- 
eaft ; by Halkirk, on the fouth, and fouth-weft ; by the 
ocean, to the north, and eaft ; and by the parifh of Reay, 
on the weft. There is alfo a feparate diftrift, called Dora- 
ry, which, though at a confiderable diftance from. Thurfo, 
forms a part of the parifh. The fhape of the great body 
of the parifh will appear from the annexed map. 

Sect. III. Scenery in the neighbourhood Trie fcenery 

round Thurfo is truly grand and picturefque. On one fide,

Statiflical Account 



a fpacioire bay, formed, on the eaft, by the bold and lofty 
promontory called Dunnet-Head ; and on the weft, by Hoi- 
burn-Head ; both which cover the bay from the tremendous 
waves of the Pentland Frith. Thefe, with ftorms of wind 
from the weft, or from the north, beat with dreadful vio- 
lence againft thofe head-lands, and prefent an awful profpect 
to the eye. On the oppofite fide of Pcntknd Frith, in view 
of Thurfo, at the diftance of eight leagues, the Hoy Hills 
in Orkney, rifing gradually from the fummit of a range of 
rocks, of tremendous height, which overhang the fea, rear 
their majeftic heads, and contribute greatly to the grandeur 
of the profpect. 

At the bottom of this beautiful bay, where the river 
Thurfo falls into the fea, the town ftands. Between the 
town and Holbnrn-Head, in the weftern fide of the bay, is 
the anchoring ground, known by the name of Scrabfter- 
Road, which is lkirted by a beautiful green bank, in form 
of a crefcent, extending from the town to the extremity of 
fhe point of Holburn-Head. The country to the weft, fouth, 
and eaft of the town, rifes, by a gentle acclivity, to the 
extent of fome miles ; and the intermediate fpace prefents a 
rich profpedr. of well cultivated fields and pleafant villas- 
Thurfo Eaft, anciently called Thurfo Caftle, once the refi- 
dence of the Earls of Caithnefs, now the feat of Sir John 
Sinclair of Ulbfter, Baronet, ftands on the eaftern fide of the 
river, nearly oppofite to the town, which, with the improve- 
ments, which are extenfive, and Harold's Tower, (landing at 
the north-eaft extremity, gives a pleafant variety to the fcene. 

Sect. IV. Sea-Coajl. — The coaft, in general, .through- 
out the parifli, is rocky ; but Thurfo Bay, towards Scrab- 
fter, is fandy. Near Scrabfter, below flood-mark, there is 
abundance of freeftone of excellent quality. The rocky 
part of the coaft is whinftone. Which, in many parts, may

be raifed in blocks of any dimenfions, and fo regular in 
fbape, that when ufed in building, they refemblg, aider 
work, of freeftone. 

Sect. V. Climate. — The air, for about eight months of 
the year, is keen and piercing, but pure and healthy. The 
fummer months are pleafant, and in June, there is fcarcely 
any darknefs, the reflection of the fun in the Atlantic, be* 
ing vifible for the fhort period he drops below the horizon. 
Even at midnight, one with tolerable fight, may read 
without candle-light. The weather in general is dry, un- 
lefs when the wind blows from the eaft, or the fouth-weff, 
which frequently brings rain. No regular table of the 
weather has, unfortunately, been kept in the neighbourhood. 

CHAP. II. HISTORY AND STATE OF THE TOWN. 

Sect. I. Origin and ancient HiJlory.—^Tht ancient hi- 
ftory of the town of Thurfo, cannot now be traced with any 
degree of certainty ; but it appears from the Icelandic au- 
thors, who are amongft the moft ancient, and the mod au- 
thentic, of the northern hiftorians, that it was a place of ve- 
ry confiderable trade and confequence many centuries ago ; 
though, from its being fo much expofed to the depredations 
of the Norwegian and Danilh pirates, it muft have often 
fuffered from their attacks. There is reafoh indeed to be- 
lieve, that the commerce of the county of Caithnefs in ge- 
neral, and of Thurfo in particular, was formerly of much 
greater importance than at prefent. It appears from 
Skene's Account of the Aflize of David King of Scotland, 
that the common and equal pondus Cathaniae, or the weight 
of Caithnefs, was ordered to he ohferved in buying or felling 
over all Scotland, which cculd not have been the cafe, had 

not 



1 



49 s Statijlical Account 

not Caithnefs, in old times, been diftinguiihed for the ex- 
tent o#its commercial tranfa&amp;ions, of which Thurfo was 
probably the centre. Its happy fituation, indeed, at the 
mouth of a large river, diftinguiihed for its valuable falmon- 
fifhery, with a natural harbour for fmall veflels, and fur- 
rounded by a fertile country, muft have rendered it, as foon 
as the province in which it was fituated came to be well in- 
habited, a place of confiderable moment. 

Sect. II. Modem Hijlory. — Thurfo was never erected 
into a royal borough, nor even into a borough of barony, 
fo far as it can now be traced, until a royal charter was 
granted for that purpofe, in the year 1633, by " whiph it 
" was entitled to all the privileges, immunities, and ju- 
u rifdi&amp;ions, belonging to a free borough of barony in 
" Scotland." No particular event, conne&amp;ed with the hi- 
ftory of this town, deferves to be commemorated, with the 
exception, perhaps, of one or two incidents which are nar- 
rated in the fucceeding fcclion. 

Sect. III. P. emarkahle Occurrences. — There are few re- 
markable occurrences handed down by tradition. In the 
reign of Charles I. the Earl of Montrofe vifited Thurfo, ha- 
ving landed in Orkney, and the houfe where he lodged, 
now a ruin, is ftill pointed out. 

In the fpring of 1746, foon before the battle of Culloden 
was fought, a party of the rebel Highlanders, under the 
command of Lord Macleod, marched into Caithnefs, in the 
hopes of acquiring fome addition to their force. But the 
gentlemen of property, nobly refolved to preferve their 
loyalty to the reigning Monarch, and, except a part of the 
land-tax, which the rebels compelled the landholders to pay 
to them, they gained nothing by coming to Caithnefs. For 
this, too, they paid dearly on their return ; for being at- 
tacked 



of Tburfo. 



499 



tacked near Dunrobin Caftle, when the men and officers 
were feparated, at eroding a ferry near that place, mod of 
the latter were obliged to furrender theinfelves prifoners of 
war. 

Sect. IV. Public Buildings.— -The. church is the only 
public building in the town. It is built in the Gothic dyle, 
in the form of a crofs, and though not large, it is a fubdantial 
and commodious building. In the fouth aide, is the burying- 
place of the family of Sinclair of Murkle. The north aide 
belongs to the town exclufively. The red; is pofleffed by 
the country heritors and their tenants, but very unequally 
indeed, and a divifion of the church is very much wanted. 

Sect. V. Private Houfes. — The number of private in- 
habited houfes in Thurfo, is from 320 to 350 ; and of thefe, 
above 20 houfes have been built within the laft 5 years, fome 
of them rather in a ftyle of elegance for a country town. But 
it is to be regretted, that though the town appears to have 
been originally deligned on a regular plan, yet it was early 
departed from, and the houfes, for the mod; part, are placed 
in the mod confufed manner. Sir John Sinclair, however, 
now propofes to feu off a tract of ground on the fouth fide 
of the town, which will give ample fcope to the inhabitants 
to extend the town, and muft prove an ornament to the 
place, as the feuars, in the new town, are to be redridted to 
build according to a fixed plan. The propofed fituation is re- 
markably pleafant, extending along the banks of the river, 
which at dream-tides is navigable for veflels of 50 or 60 
tons burdens, the full length of the ground appropriated for 
building. Of courfe, the new town will pofiefs every ad- 
vantage for trade which the old town enjoys, while, at the 
fame time, it will be lefs expofed to encroachment from the 
fea.

CHAP, m, CONSTITUTION AND GOVERNMENT. 

bECT. I. Conjlitutlon of the "Town. — The town holds of 
Sir John Sinclair as immediate fuperior. It was originally 
ere&amp;ed into a borough of barony by King Charles I. in the 
year 1633, by a charter granted in favour of John, Mafter 
of Berrydale, " Giving, granting, and difponing to the bo- 
" rough, all and fundry privileges, immunities, and jurif- 
" diclions, belonging to a free borough of barony ; with 

full power to the faid John, Mafter of Berrydale, and 
" his heirs, &amp;x. to appoint and create bailies, counfellors, 
" and other officers needful, within the faid borough, for 
" the ruling and governing thereof ; and ficklike, with the 
" power of holding weekly markets in the faid borough on 
" Saturday ; with five free fairs yearly, viz. the firft on the 
*' feaft of the Blefied Virgin, commonly called our Lady's 
" Day, on the 25th day ; and the next on the feaft of St 
" Peter's, commonly called St Peter's Day, on the 29th of 
" June ; the third on the feaft of St Michael, commonly St 
" Michael's Day, on the 29th of September; and the 
** fourth on the feaft of commonly called St 

ft Day, on the day of 

" Each of the faid fairs to continue and endure for the 
M fpace of three days •, and to collecl:, exacf, and intromit 
*' with, and uplift the cuftoms of the fame, and to apply the 
" fame to their own ufes," &amp;c. 

The weekly markets are held on Friday, inftead of Sa- 
turday, the day appointed by the charter of erection ; and 
of the ftated yearly fairs, that on St Peter's Day is the only 
erne which is kept ; but the want of the other three is fully 
compenfated, by a great fair called the Marymas Market, 
which begins about the latter end of Auguft, and continues 
for ten days. Merchants, fhopkeepers, and chapmen, from 

various 



of Tburfo. 



5oi 



various parts of Scotland, refort to this fair, with goods to a 
large amount. It is alfo a market for horfes, butter, cheefe, 
linen-cloth, and yarn, and other commodities of the growth, 
produce, and manufacture, of the country. But, of late 
years, fince the merchants in the town have extended their 
trade, and enlarged their {hops, and increafed the number 
of articles they deal in, this market has not been fo much 
frequented by ftrangers as formerly. 

Sect. II. Corporation and Magijlrates. — The town was 
formerly governed by three bailies, and twelve counfellors, 
appointed by the fuperior ; but, for many years paft, the 
magistracy has been confined to two bailies and twelve 
counfellors. Thefe are not elected annually, but continue in 
office during the fuperior's pleafure. Perhaps it were bet- 
ter, that the magistrates were annually nominated by the 
fuperior, from a leet prefented to him by the burgeffes and. 
inhabitants ; at any rate, in terms of the charter, the num- 
ber of bailies ought to be increafed to three. 

Sect. III. Awnorial Bearings. — There are none ex- 
tant -, but there is a town's feal, which is a St Andrew with 
his crofs. 

Sect. IV. Taxes and Revenues. — The town is valued in 
the cefs-books of the county, at L. 666 113:4 Scotch mo- 
ney ; and the feuars pay a proportional part of the land- 
tax, correfponding to that valuation. They alfo pay cer- 
tain feu-duties to the fuperior, chiefly in tallow. Thefe, 
with the public -taxes, are all that the inhabitants are fub- 
jecred to. As a corporation, the town has no revenue. 
The cultoms of the public markets and fairs, are let for a 
fmall yearly rent, which belongs to the fuperior.

CHAP. IV. POPULATION; 

Sect. I. Former State of Population — There is an account 
of this parifh, in Macfarlane's manufcript Geographical Col- 
lections, preferved in the Advocates Library, in which the 
number of examinable perfons, in the town of Thurfo, is fta- 
ted at about 900 ; and in the whole parifh at 2200. The 
return to Dr Webfter, in 1755, was 2963 fouls. As the 
inhabitants now amount to 3146 perfons, there is confe- 
quently an increafe of 183 in the whole diftricl. That in- 
creafe, however, has taken place entirely in the town, the 
population of the country part, by an augmentation of the 
iize of farms, without which no improvement could have 
taken place, having confiderably dimjnifhed. 

Sect. II. Prefent State of Population.— -The prefent (late 
of the population of this diflrict, will appear from the an- 
nexed Statiftical Table. It is fatisfa&amp;ory to add, that the 
population of the town, has not only increafed of late, but is 
likely to be rapidly augmented. This can hardly fail to 
be the cafe, in a place fo happily fituated, and where encou- 
ragement is given to the extenfion of its commerce and ma- 
nufactures, and to every fpecies of improvement. 

Sect. Ijl. Difeafes. — This diftrift is not afflicted with 
any peculiar diftempers, by which its population can be af- 
fected. The principal, undoubtedly, is the fmall-pox, which, 
chiefly affecting thofe, who are in an early flage of life, de- 
ilroys the very fource whence additional numbers may be 
expected. The following obfervations upon that fubjeci, 
and on other difeafes to which they are liable in this neigh- 
bourhood, drawn up by Mr John Williamfon, furgeon to 

the 



of Tblitjo.

the 2d Battalion of the Rothfay and Caithnefs Fencibles, 
merit particular attention. 

" In December 1796, the confluent fmall-pox became 
highly epidemic and fatal in this county ; in Thurfo more 
particularly, the epidemic was almoft general, and, by my 
calculation, one in four fell a victim." 

" Both in this town, and in the county, the mortality be- 
came fo general and alarming, that I conlidered the fuggcft- 
ing a plan of general inoculation, a duty incumbent on me, 
as a practitioner in the place : in this I had to encounter 
many difficulties, as the peafantry held a religious prejudice 
againft inoculation, and the prevalence of the natural fmall- 
pox, prefented another objection not readily overcome." 

" In order effectually to overcome the unfortunate pre- 
judice, that inoculation for the fmall-pox was a provocation 
to Divine Providence, the clergy frequently inculcated in 
public, that, on the contrary, it is a kind interpofition of 
Providence, to mitigate the ravages of a moil fatal diieafe." 

" In order to remove the general idea, that the epidemic 
then prevailing, and the inoculation might co-operate, and 
be conjunctly received into the fyft'em, and thus produce a 
doubly inveterate affection, I obferved, that from the nature 
of the fmall-pox, the one affection being receis T ed, prevented 
the influence of any other being communicated to the fy- 
ftem." 

" After much difficulty, when with the affiftance of the 
clergy, I had overcome any unfortunate religions prejudice, 
I recommended their collecting the inhabitants of a diftrict 
to one place, and thus in one day, feldom lefs than 20 Were 
inoculated. Indeed, when not prevented by particular bufi- 
nefs, I have arrived at the number of 120 in a fingle day. 

" In the courfe of fo general an inoculation, the dangerous 
epidemic then prevailing, induced me to perform, on many 
patients, then in habits of body very unfavourable: however, 

in 



Statijlical Account 



in the fituation of the county, it was lefs hazardous than the 
epidemic." 

" The county practice here is mod fatiguing to a medical 
practitioner ; the roads are bad, and, considering the extent 
of the county, it is thinly inhabited attendance, however, 
on my young patients became the more neceflary, as the 
hot temperature, and fuch internal phlogiftics, as pure 
whiiky, is generally adopted." 

" By an accurate journal, from October 1796, to July 
1797, my numbers amounted to 645." 

" Under the difad vantages I laboured, of the numbers in- 
oculated, bad roads, a propensity to the oppofite treatment I 
inculcated, inoculating children of improper habits, from 
fear of the fatal epidemic, it is furprifing that but two chil- 
dren, whom I had a ftrong reluctance to inoculate, were 
the only victims." 

" It is lingular, that notwithstanding the general inocula- 
tion in every other parifti, none, unlefs gentlemens children, 

ere at that time inoculated in the parifti of Latheron." 

" Deducting the parifti of Latheron, the population of 
Caithnefs does not exceed 21,000 fouls. I am inclined 
therefore to believe, that there has not been fo general an 
inoculation in Scotland, during fo ftiort a period as eight 
months." 

" I am well Satisfied, from attentive observation to prac- 
tice, that any feafon is fuited to a favourable event of inocula- 
tion. The warmth of lummer is urged as a material objec- 
tion to inoculation at that feafon. I am fearful, that the 
refrigerant plan is very generally carried fo far, as in many 
cafes to be productive of bad effects ; and I have no doubt, 
that the temperature of our patient's room, may be reduced 
to the cool degree, needed at any feafon." 

" In the Weft Indies they rarely have the choice of feafon, 
as inoculation is feldom practifed ; but when a veflel has ap- 
peared, with the difeafe on hoard, then- a general inoculation 

takes-

takes place in the idand, and fuccefsfully, at whatever fea- 
fon." 

" While the alarming epidemic raged, feveral gentlemens 
children were inoculated, by their particular defire, about 
five days after birth. Having been taught to confider ino- 
culation, at that period, hazardous, for reafons founded on 
theory, I was very reluctant to attempt the experiment  
but from the many fHecefsful cafes I have had at that age, 
I muft conclude it a commendable practice in all healthy 
fubjects •, they are at that age free of any difeafe from, 
teething, or its confequences, which very commonly adds 
feverely ta the critical fymptoms of fmall-pox by inocula- 
tion." 

" I am farther convinced, that early inoculation proves a 
more mild difeafe, from the following circumftance : A mid- 
wife, laft winter, who attended perlbns under delivery who 
were my patients, had her own children under the natural 
fmall-pox, and to many young- ones after birth, the conta- 
gion clearly appeared to be given by her ; in every cafe the 
affection was favourable in the event.-" 

" I have thus far continued to give my opinion, collected 
from practice, with the fole view of introducing the molt 
favourable mode of inoculation, and to preferve, from fo 
fatal a difeafe, many of a valuable race (the Highlanders of 
Scotland.)" 

" Puifuing this view, which I flatter myjEelf, in this coun- 
ty, I have fuccefsfully attained, I cannot confidently omit 
taking notice of a pamphlet which fell into my hands, 
addrefled to the Clergy of Scotland, recommending general, 
but domeliic, inoculation •, i. e. every family to inoculate 
their own, without the aillitance of a medical practitioner." 

" It mull readily appear, that inoculation is not lb far un- 
derwood by every head of a family, as to convince them 
they ought to adopt Dr Brown of Edinburgh's plan. A 
propenfir.y to the hot treatment, fo general in the High- 
hinds 



Stntijlical Account 



lands of Scotland, evinces the bad tendency of domeftic in- 
oculation/' 

" The previous preparation neceflary to inoculation, in 
moll cafes, evinces the bad tendency of domeftic inocula- 



tion." 



" In juftice to the more ignorant of my countrymen, me- 
dical people have their own predeceflbrs to blame, for the 
propenfity raoft people in the Highlands hold, to hot treat- 
ment in the fmall-pox ; it was ftrongly inculcated by old 
phyficians, and, no doubt, the new treatment, cannot for a 
time be generally received." 

" Should this brief account of inoculation, in the courfe of 
eight months, be deemed any acquisition to the Statiftical 
Account of this town and neighbourhood, I beg what may 
be confidered interefting, with the view to prevent an un- 
fortunate decreafe of population by the epidemic fmall-pox, 
may be extrafted as may feem mod ufeful. I am fo much 
engaged in bufinefs, that my time has not permitted that at- 
tention to the account which may perhaps be neceflary. 
My obfervations reft on practice, and the following rules, if 
received, and fan&amp;ioned by medical authority of longer ex- 
perience than mine, may tend to promote general inocula- 
tion." 

" i. That whenever the epidemic prevails, inoculation 
mould immediately be performed, on thofe not yet affedied." 

" 2. That every one of influence, more efpecially the 
clergy, ought, as good members of fociety, to advife general 
inoculation." 

" 3. That all feafons, in Britain, may be adapted to ino- 
culation." 

" 4. That healthy children, paft four days of age, may be 
fafely inoculated." 

" 5. That domeftic inoculation, mull, in general, be dan- 
porous." 

"6. That 



of Tburfo. 



" 6. That previous preparation is moft commonly necef- 
fary." 

" I cannot help noticing, that the population of Scotland, 
has frequently been fo diminifhed by the fmall-pox, as to 
call for an effectual remedy. We have it in inoculation, 
and yet the ancient fatal fuperftition is fo little overcome, 
that many parts are either unacquainted that fuch a benefit 
exifts, or little pains are taken to recommend it. As the, 
Highland Society is fo diftinguilhed for its patriotic exer- 
tions, would it not be a moft laudable effort in them, to 
adopt meafures for promoting general inoculation, by al- 
lowing prizes to the furgeons who are moft ufeful in that 
line." 

The following obfervations are drawn up by the fame 
gentleman, refpecting the difeafes to which the people of 
this county are ufually fubjedt. 

" The difeafes are occafionally very alarming. Fevers, 
generally defigned nervous and putrid, are common, and 
very fatal, arifing, in fome degree, from the marfliy efflu- 
via; there is, however, a more general caufe." 

" From Wick, along the eaftern and northern coaft, to 
Dunnet, farmers depend on fea-ware for manure j to render 
it more effectual, the putrefactive procefs is promoted, by 
collecting it into considerable heaps. In that putrid ftate it 
remains during fummer, when collected, to the fpring en- 
fuing. It is particularly fatal during fummer and harveft, 
when the wind blows from the weft to the eaft, the putrid 
effl uvia being fent over a confjderable extent of country. 
To give a fiiort account of the refult, in many cafes I have 
had under my eye, and from what information I could col- 
lect, the common fymptoms of low nervous fever has thence 
appeared : in two days after, violent delirium, and inceffant 
vomiting ; the event of which, between the fourth and the 
$fth day, was commonly fatal." 

" The 



•5=8

" The flux is a very common difeafe, and generally aft 
■attendant fymptom of the nervous and putrid fever." 

" The peafantry are more liable to difeafe, than the more 
-wealthy farmers and landholders, which may be eanly ac- 
counted for ; the dwelling of the peafant is clofe, confined, 
and dirty ; during the day he has been expofed to the wea- 
ther, and rheumatifm is of courfe become a very common 
complaint among them." 

" The more wealthy, have well ventilated houfes, good 
diet, and every neceffary requifite to preferve health ; their 
difeafes are few, and they are not arrived at that ftate of 
luxury, neceffary to generate many, which are not unufual 
in other places." 

Sect. IV. Longevity. — There is now living in this pa- 
rifh, a man of 105 years of age, who travels about the coun- 
try. A gentlewoman in town died a few weeks ago, aged 
98 ; and one of the heritors of the parifh, now in the 93d 
year of his age, exhibits an uncommon inftance of old 
age, retaining the full poffeffion of all his faculties. The. 
people in general live to a good age, and are remarkably 
healthy. 



CHAP. V. ECCLESIASTICAL STATE. 

SECT. I. State of the EJlabliJhed Church. — By far the 
m oft numerous part of the inhabitants belong to the Efta- 
blifhed Church ; and though almoft all the pariftiioners un- 
derftand Englilb, a fermon is preached every Sunday in the 
Erfe or Gaelic. The Reverend Mr Patrick Nicolfon is 
the prefent incumbent : his predeceffors were Alexander

Sect. II. Ma/ife, &amp;?:.— The manfe was built not many 
years ago, in a ftrong and fubftantial manner. The glebe is 
not large, but the land of which it confifts is extremely va- 
luable. The ftipend was formerly 5 chalders of victual, 
half meal and half bear ; 700 merks of money, and 100 
merks for furnifhing communion-elements, which has fince 
been augmented. In the procefs of augmentation, the fol- 
lowing fcheme was given in of the rent and ftipend of the 
parifti, as it flood anno 1793.

gcther with loo merks Scotch money for communion- 
elements ; which laft allowance was afterwards increafed to 
L. ioo Scotch, according to which the ftipend is directed to 
he localled. 

Sect. III. Patron. — Sir John Sinclair of Ulbfrer is the 
patron of the pariCb. 

Sect. IV. Diffenters. — The difTenters from the Efta- 
blilhed Church, are feceders of the feet, called Antiburghers. 
They have had a meeting houfe and a clergyman in Thurfo 
for 26 years paft. Their numbers, of late years, has rather 
been declining, and at prefent there are not above 70 people 
of this defcription in the town and parifli. 



CHAP. VI. CHARITABLE FUNDS AND INSTITUTIONS. 

Sect. I. Poor. — There are a great many beggars and 
indigent people in this parilh, not only natives of it, but 
perfons who, falling off in their circumftances, refort to the 
town of Thurfo, from the difbricls in the neighbourhood. 
The poor's funds are very trifling. They arife from the 
annual collections at the church-door, the fines or penalties 
occafionally impofed by the kirk-feflion on delinquents, and 
the intereft of L. 50 left them fome years ago by Dr Arthur 
Sinclair, who died in the fervice of the Eaft India Company. 
The whole may amount, at an average, to about L. 25 per 
annum. It is divided by the kirk-feflion amongft the poor, 
as their refpedtive circumftances may feem to require. 

Sect. II. Propofed Hofpital. — The county will at all 
times probably have one or more regularly educated fur- 
geons, by which the health of the upper ranks will be pro- 
9 perly 



of Tburfo. 



perly attended to when neceffary. But the peafantry and 
fervants are fometimes much negle&amp;ed at prefent, infomuch, 
that on a fervant's being feized with any contagious difor- 
der, they are fometimes turned out to find quarters where 
they beft can } and in confequence of their being placed in 
that unfortunate fituation, many muft fuffer. 

It has therefore occurred to Mr Williamfon, that it would 
be advifable to have an hofpital in Thurfo, for perfons thus 
circumftanced ; and it is propofed to have, as a meafure of 
great humanity, and likely to be generally ufeful, one 
erected by the fubferiptions of the merchants in the town,, 
and the gentlemen in the neighbourhood. 

CHAP. VII. EDUCATION. 

Sect. I. Schools for Boys. — In the town there are two 
public fchools, \iz, the parochial or grammar fchool, and a 
charity fchool, upon the eftablilhment of the Society for 
Propagating Chriftian Knowledge in the Highlands and 
Iflands of Scotland. The firft is not in fo flourifhing 
a ftate at prefent as could be wifhed ; but the other is doing 
well, under the management of a faithful, attentive, and 
diligent teacher. Befides thefe, there are fome private 
fchools, at which children are taught reading; and from the 
beft account which could be obtained, the number of fcho 
lars in the different fchools is as follows :

Sect. II. Propofed Academy. — A plan has been fuggeft- 
ed for eftablilhing an academy in Thurfo, where young 
men might be educated in a fuperior manner, than what a 
common fchool ufually admits of, and it is certainly defir- 
able, that fuch an inflitution mould take place, where about 
250 young men annually receive that education, on which 
their future fuccefs in life muft in a great meafure depend. 
The number would alfo certainly increafe, if fuch an cfta- 
blifliment were to take place. It is to be hoped that fuch 
a plan will be brought to bear, when the conclufion of the 
prefent war will admit of more attention to the internal 
improvement of the country. 

Sect. III. Female Education- — It is much to be regret- 
ted, that there is not in Thurfo a boarding- fchool for girls, 
where they might be taught needle-work, mufic, and the 
other branches of education fuited to the fex. Some at- 
tempts have been made towards eftablifhing fiich a femina- 
ry, but for want of public fpirit, and public aid, thefe have 
hitherto proved ineffectual ; nor will any thing of the kind 
fucceed, until there is a fund eftablifhed for paying a cer- 
tain falary, and providing a free houfe for the accommoda- 
tion of an accorriplifhed fchoolmiftrefs, which might be ea- 
fily done, were the gentlemen of the town to turn their 
thoughts ferioufly to this important fubjecT:. 



CHAP. VIII. REVENUE DEPARTMENT. 

Sect. I. Cujlomhoufe The eftablifhment at the port of 

Thurfo confifts of a collector, a comptroller, a land-furveyor, 
a land-waiter, two eftablifhed tidefmen, and one extraordi- 
nary tidefman ; in all feven officers, whofe falaries together 

amount 



of Tlmrfo. 



5*3 



amount to L. 170, which, with houfe-rent and other 
incidental charges, make the annual expenditure about 
L. 200. 

The duties of Cuftoms colle&amp;ed at the port, communibus 
annis, are not fufficient to defray the expence of the efta- 
blifhment ; the goods exported to foreign parts, being fuch 
as are duty-free, and the imports being chiefly fir-fpars and 
deals from Norway, of that defcription which pay only a 
low duty. The revenue, however, is increafing, and the 
eftabliflvment of a cuftomKoufe at Thurfo, is eflential for the 
convenience of its trade, and the commercial tranfadlions of 
the neighbourhood. 

Sect. II. Pojl- Office.— The pofhnafter of Thurfo's al- 
lowance for falary and expence of runners to and from 
Dunbeath, is L. 47, 4 s. yearly. After defraying this ex- 
pence, he remitted to the General Poft-OrEce at Edinburgh, 
for the year ending 1796, the fum of L. 220, 19 s. of clear 
revenue, exclulive of the poftages of letters fent in bye- 
bags. At prefent there are only three polls in the week to 
and from Thurfo; but the gentlemen of the town and coun- 
ty have it in contemplation to apply for a daily poll, which 
has been lately extended fo far north as Dornoch, in the 
county of Sutherland. 

Sect. III. Excife. — The prefent efiabliffiment of the 
Excife department at Thurfo, including the county, confute 
of a collector, who likewife officiates as fupervilbr for the 
county, and five officers. Under the management of Mr 
Campbell, the prefent collector, the revenue has been more 
productive than at any former period. In the year from 
the 5th July 1796 to the 5th of July 1797, the grofs

amount of the duties of Excife collected within the county 
of Caithnefs, was - - L. 1708 7 9^. 

Officers falaries, and other expences of ma- 
nagement within the fame period, was 599 6 14. 

Remains of clear revenue, L. n 09 1 8 

The laft additional duty on the Highland diftillery will 
add confiderably to that branch of the revenue in Caith- 
nefs. Since July 1797, there has been paid quarterly, from 
licenfed ftills in the county, at L. 6, 10 s. per gallon, the fum 
of L. 934 : 7 : 6. 

Sect. IV. Stamps. — The diftributor of ftatnps for 
Caithnefs, who refides in Thurfo, remitted for laft year to 
the Stamp-Office at Edinburgh, the fum of L. 207, for 
ftamp-duties, after deducting the L. 10 per centum allowed 
for his own trouble. 

CHAP. IX. MILITARY AND NAVAL DEPARTMENT. 

SECT. I. Military Spirit of the People of Caithnefs. 

The people of Caithnefs have long been remarkable for 
their attachment to the military life, and are allowed to 
make excellent foldiers, eafily trained to arms, fit to under- 
go fatigue, and fteady in ac~lion. No county in Scotland, 
of equal extent and population, has furnifhed half fo many 
men for the regular forces as Caithnefs has done. It is ob- 
fervable, at the fame time, that of late the people mew lefs 
inclination to the fervice than they did formerly, owing, it 
is believed, to their growing more induftrious, and confe- 
quently finding their fituation at home more comfortable 
than was the cafe fome few years before. From this cir- 
cumflance, and from the numbers that had previoufly gone 

into 



aj Tburfo. 



into other corps, it was not without the afiiftancc of other 
parts of the kingdom, that three battalions of fencibles were 
raifed in the county, namely, the Rothefay and Caithnefs 
Fencibles, of two battalions, commanded by Sir John Sin- 
clair ; and the Caithnefs Legion, of one battalion, com- 
manded by Sir Benjamin Dunbar. 

Sect. II. Volunteers. — This county has likewife given 
ample proofs of its loyalty in the railing of volunteer 
corps. There are now nine companies embodied, each con- 
fifting of lixty privates, with the ufual number of officers, 
non-commiffioned officers, and drummers, attached to each 
company; making in all an effective force of 640 men, in- 
cluding officers. Of thefe, five companies have offered their 
feryice in any part of the united kingdom. Nine additional 
companies were lately offered to be raifed, but the offer has 
not been accepted. 

Sect. III. Seamen for the Navy. — Before the Amrican 
war, the people of Caithnefs were very little inclined to en- 
ter into the navy ; but during that period, and lince, this 
county has furniftied a good many feamen for the navy. 
The colle&amp;or of the Cuftoms at Thurfo, in the courfe of 
three years, engaged upwards of 70 men for that fervice ; 
and if the naval regulations would admit of paying bounties 
to feamen upon their enliftment, inftead of requiring their 
being firft muttered on board (hip, there would be no diffi- 
culty in finding men in Caithnefs to enter for the fea-fervice 
. upon any emergency. 

CHAP. X. MANUFACTURES AND TRADE. 
Sect. I. ManufaBures of various forts in the Town and 
Pari/h. — In the town there are the following tradefmen, 
who find conftant employment, viz. : 

Weavers,

Befides thefe there is a cart and plough manufactory, 
which employs 13 wrights and 4 blackfmiths. There is a 
tannery doing remarkably well ; and in the neighbourhood 
©f the town there is a bleachfield, which, if properly attend- 
ed to, will likewife turn out to advantage. The tannery and 
bleachfield were fet on foot by the exertions of one of the 
proprietors, affifted by the public fpirit of feveral gentlemen 
of the county, and merchants in town, who fubfcribed for 
the purpofe. In order to encourage a public brewery, very 
much wanted, the fame gentleman has difpofed of a part of 
bis property in town, on the mod moderate terms, to one 
of the inhabitants, willing to undertake iuch a work ; and 
the buildings requifite for the purpofe are now erecting on 
an extenfive fcale. There is every reafon to expecT: that the 
brewery will prove a profitable concern to the proprietor, 
and an ufeful work to the public ; that it will leflen the 
confumption of fpirits, and fupeifede the importation of 
London porter, which has of late years been growing to an 
estenfive height.

The weavers are principally employed in the manufac- 
ture of linen cloths, but they alfo work coarfe woollens and 
plaiding, of coarfe wool, carried from the ports of Leith and 
Invernefs. None of the finer wool, produced from the 
Cheviot breed of fheep, kept on the farms of Langwall and 
Armadale, is manufactured in the country. In the year 

1796, the quantity of wool brought coaltwife to the port of 
Thurfo, was 151 cwt. 19 qrs. and 5 lb. 

There is another fpecies of manufacture, which, though 
it employs a great many hands, is not of much real benefit 
to the country ; and that is the fpinning of flax for the fouth 
country manufacturers. It appears by the Cuftomhoufe 
Books, that for the three years preceding the ill of January 

1797, the average amount of drefled flax which was brought 
coaftwife to the port of Thurfo, was 84,583 pounds weight 
per annum. This quantity of flax would produce 53,1 14 
fpyndles of yarn. The fpinners are paid at the rate of 1 s. 
■per fpyndlej and the agents or factors employed to give out 
the flax, and take in the yarn, have 2 d. per fpyndle for 
their trouble. So the fpinners, for their labour, receive 

2655 per annum; and the factors, for their trouble, 
L. 443 being, in all, L. 3098 per annum. But how infe- 
rior this to the profit which would accrue to the country, 
if the above quantity of flax were made into fewing threads, 
or manufactured into cloth in the country ; and how fmall 
a confideration for the lofs which the farmers fnftain by the 
want of the labour of the women, employed in fpinning, 
which might be more beneficially applied to the purpofes 
of agriculture. It is true, that fome proportion of the above- 
mentioned quantity of flax is made into cloth in the country, 
but it is, comparatively fpeaking, a fmall lhare, fcarcely de- 
fcrving of any notice.

Sect. II. Coajling Trade. — The coatting trade of the 
port of Thurfo has been gradually increafing for the laft ao 
years, and is now pretty confiderable. It employs about 
11,50c tons of lhipping, including the repeated voyages of 
the different veflcls. Of thefe, 6000 tons, or thereby, are 
employed in the carriage of goods coaflwife /torn the port, 
and about 5500 tons in carrying goods coaflwife to the 
port. 

The goods exported, or fent coaflwife from the port, may

Of late years, the quantities of corn and meal exported 
from the port of Thurfo, have been lefs than formerly, 
which may be imputed to three caufes. In the firji place, 
To the increafe of inhabitants, which,- in the whole county, 
fince the year 1755, amounts to 2587 fouls; idly, To the 
confumption of bear in the country by diftillation, lince 
fmall Mills in the Highlands have been allowed by law ; and, 
%d/y, To the increafed confumption of -oats for horfe-corn. 
Formerly the farmers ufed fmall horfes or g'arrons, which 
feldom or ever got any corn ; but now they have got into 
the ufe of larger horfes, and thefe, in winter and fpring, are 
regularly fed with oats. Neither are oxen fo much em- 
ployed in agriculture now as formerly. The county was 
in ufe to export, rather above than below, 25000 bolls of 

oatmeal 



5 20 



StatiJIical Account 



oatmeal and bear, or bigg, yearly ; whereas now the ave- 
rage does not exceed 18000 bolls ; one-third of that quan- 
tity being bear, and two-thirds oatmeal. 

But what may be loft to the country by a decreafe in the 
exportation of corn, is fully compenfated by the increafe in 
the exportation of fj(h, as to which, a more particular de- 
tail will be given in the next chapter. 

Sect. III. Foreign Commerce. — The foreign trade at the 
port of Tliurfo is very inconfiderable, efpecially in war 
time. In times of peace, when bear and meal were low in 
price at home, conliderable quantities of both, particularly 
of bear, were exported to Norway •, in return for which, 
the vefftls employed in this trade imported cargoes of wood 
and fait, and fometimes French wines, but of an inferior 
quality. This, with now and then a cargo of fifti, confti- 
tuted the foreign commerce of the port ; but lince the com- 
mencement of the prefent war, there has been no foreign 
trade at all, a few cargoes of wood only excepted. 

Sect. IV. Navigation and Shipping. — There are at 
prefent belonging to the town and port of Thurfo 16 deck- 
ed veflels, (eight whereof belong to the town folely) •, whofe 
tonnage together amounts to 858 tons. Thefe are all em- 
ployed in the coafting trade and the herring fifhery. 

The number of boats within the diftrict may be about 
130 ; and allowing 6 men to each boat, being the ufual com- 
plement, there are 780 filhermen along the coaft. But then 
it is to be obferved, that of the above number, only 6 boats 
and about 40 men, (and thefe refide at Thurfo), are con- 
ftantly employed in fiftiing ; the reft are farmers, tradefmen, 
or day-labourers, as well as occafional fiftiers ; and, unlefs 
in the fummer, during the herring- filhing feafon, fiftiing to 
them is but a fecondary objeft.

Sect. V. Harbours and Dues. — The harbours of Thurfo 
and Wick are the only places defer ving of the name on the 
coaft of Caithnefs ; and even thefe, in their prefent Hate, 
are but indifferent harbours, though capable of being made 
good ones at no great expence, particularly that of Thurfo. 
In its prefent ftate, it admits veffels of 10 feet draught of 
water at ftream-tides, and after getting in over the bar they 
lie in perfect fafety ; but for want of a pier or breaft-work 
of flone, they can only load or unload with low-water. 

The fhore-dues at Thurfo are only i s. 6 d. for each vef- 
fel. Ships belonging to the town pay no fhore-dues ; their 
owners, in lieu thereof, being at the expence of upholding 
poles for making the mips faft in the harbours. For each 
fliip that puts a rope afliore at Scrabfter Roads, the proprie- 
tor of Holburn-head is entitled to a merk Scots of ring- 
dues, for which he keeps iron rings fixed in the rock, to 
which the {hips fallen their hawfers. 

Sect. VI. State of Freights — The freight paid for 

the carriage of goods to and from Thurfo, are as follows, 
viz. 

For each barrel-bulk to or from Leith, L. o 2 6 

For ditto from Thurfo to London, o 3 6 

For ditto from London to Thurfo, 046 

For each ton weight to Leith, - o 10 o 

For ditto to Newcaftle, - 0150 

And fo in proportion to and from other places, according 
to the length of the voyage. 

Sect. VII. Banks.— -The firft Banking Company that 
eftablimed itfelf at Thurfo, was the Commercial Company 
of Aberdeen ; who began giving credits on cafh-accounts, 
sad difcounting bills, in June 1790, and who, it is believed, 

carried 



5 2 2 S tatijlical Account 

carried on a profitable conne&amp;ion with the county of Caith. 
nefsj but being obliged, on the breaking out of the prefent 
War, to curtail the number of their branches, withdrew 
from Thurfo in September 1793. Fortunately, however 
a branch of that rcfpedlable and public-fpirited Company, 
the Bank of Scotland, has taken place in its room, un- 
der the management of the fame gentleman who had aded 
as agent for the Aberdeen Commercial Bank, and it now 
does a confiderable deal of bufinefs. The branch there anfwers 
not only for the county of Caithnefs, but alfo for Strathna- 
ver and the Orkneys ; and whilft there is every reafon to 
hope, that it will be attended with profit to the Bank, muft, , 
at the fame time, contribute materially to the profperity 
and improvement of the northern parts of Scotland. 



CHAP. XI. FISHERIES. 

Sect. I. Salmon-Fifhing. — There are lix rivers in Caith- 
nefs where falmon is caught : Thurfo, Berrydale, Langwall, 
Wick, Torfs, and Dunbeath. The three firft of thefe are 
the exclufive property of Sir John Sinclair, Baronet •, but 
the river Thurfo is of greater value than all the reft, and 
rents for L. 300 per annum. It has frequently produced 
from 150 to 200 barrels of falmon in a feafon ; and it is a 
faft well attefted, that in the year 1736, 2560 falmon were 
taken in the courfe of a day, upon one pool on the river of 
Thurfo. The falmon-fifhing at Thurfo commences in No- 
vember, and ends in Auguft. For many years paft, the 
greateftpart of the fifh taken in this river, which are allow- 
ed to be of the belt quality, have been boiled and kitted, 
and carried on board fmacks to London, where they fell for 
a hij;h price. Twelve hundred kitts have been fent from 
the river Thurfo in a feafon, and the general average is 

from 



of Tburfb. 



from 700 to 800 kitts. This, of courfe, leffens the quan- 
tity of pickled falmon packed in barrels, and fent to foreign 
markets ; but ftill there are about 250 barrels of falmon 
{hipped annually at Thurfo, which, however, includes the 
falmon taken in fome rivers on the northern coaft of the 
county of Sutherland. Until the laft feafon, the Thurfo 
falmon were all boiled and kitted at Wick, after being car- 
ried 20 miles over land on horfeback. The expence necef- 
farily attending fo long a carriage was incurred to avoid 
the navigation of the Pentland Frith, which the fmack- 
mafters, until of late years, confidered a hazardous under- 
taking ; but now they make no account of it, and the fifh 
are boiled and kitted in a neat and commodious boil-houfe, 
lately eredted on the river fide, on the eaft fide of the har- 
bour of Thurfo. 

Sect. II. White Fijhery. — It has been fhewn in the 
preceding chapter, that fifh conftitutes a principal part of the 
export trade of the port of Thurfo, in the account of which, 
the amount of fifh annually exported is fet down at an ave- 
rage of L. 13824, 10 s. The calculation is made from the 
quantities of the different kinds of fifh exported, taken from 
the books kept at the Cuftomhoufe, and the forefaid aggre- 
gate fum is compofed of the following particulars : 

L. s. d. 

ift, Salmon barrelled and kitted, valued at 1610 o o. 

2d, Herrings, white and red, at 9914 10 o 

3d, Wet cod and ling, at - 1200 q o 

4th, Dry cod and ling, at - 1100 o o 

In all, as before, L. 13824 10 o 

Nor can this calculation be thought exaggerated by any 
means, when it is confidered, that on an average of the laft 

nine 



5^4 



Statijlkal Account 



nine years, from the ift of January 1789, 7436 barrels o( 
herrings have been caught and cured yearly at the port of 
Thurfo. Of this number two-thirds, or 4958 barrels, are 
cured as white herrings; and one-third, or 2478 barrels are 
cured as red herrings. The white herrings are valued at 
L.i, 5 s. and the red herrings at L. 1, 10 s. per barrel, 
which is not by any means an over rate. Both kinds are 
in general fent coaftwife from the port of Thurfo to the 
port of London •, whence the white herrings are for the moll 
part exported to the Weft Indies ; and the red herrings are 
there entered for home confumption. 

The average of cod and ling is taken at 800 barrels of 
wet cod, being what is caught in the winter and fpring fea- 
fons, and 55 tons of dried fiih, being what is caught and 
dried in the fummer and harveft months. Thefe alfo find 
their market in London, and are partly exported from 
thence, and partly entered there for home confumption. 

Befides the aforefaid herrings, cured and packed into bar- 
rels at the port, there is feldom a feafon in which there are 
not fome cargoes of herrings in bulk fent to the ports of 
Dunbar and Berwick, where they are afterwards packed 
into barrels, or fold for immediate ufe to the country people. 
The herrings fent annually in this way, would, if packed, 
fill 1000 barrels at the moft moderate computation. 

Before the year 1770, the herring-fifhery on the Caith- 
nefs coaft never amounted to 900 barrels of cured herrings 
in one feafon. That year the quantity cured was 1853 
barrels ; and from that period the liming increafed gradu- 
ally for a few years ; but afterwards fell off again, and did 
not revive with fpirit until the year 1788, fince which pe- 
riod it has continued to be carried on with good fuccefs. 

It appears, that early in the prefent century, there was si 
very confiderable cod-filhing carried on at the port of 
Thurfo, in which fome of the firft proprietors in the coun- 
ty 



of Tfmrfo. 



try were concerned ; but after being carried on fome years, 
it was difcontinued, and entirely neglected for near 50 
years, when the Houfe of Charles and Robert Fall of Dun- 
bar*, in the year 1780, entered into contract with all the 
fifhermen in the county, to take, at certain fixed prices, all 
the cod and ling they could catch. Curers were ftationed 
at different places round the coaft, who received the fifh the 
inftant they were brought on more ; and thus encouraged, 
the fifhermen again began to feek for cod and ling, and 
their fuccefs exceeded their moft fanguine expectations. But 
frill there is room for confiderable extention and improve- 
ment in this branch of the fifhery. 

Sect. III. Lohjler FiJJiery. — Very little has hitherto 
been done in lobfter fifhing in Caithnefs, although there can 
be no doubt but that the coaft abounds with that fpecies of 
fifh. In Thurfo Bay, and at Mey, it has been tried with 
pretty good fuccefs, but not to that extent as to make it an 
object of attention to the London filhmongers. 

Sect. IV. London Smacks. — Before the commencement 
of the prefent war, a London cod fmack never was feen in 
Pentland Frith. Being driven from the Dogger Bank, by 
the annoyance of French and Dutch privateers, they ven- 
tured to explore, the northern coafts of Caithnefs and Su- 
therland, in fearch of cod ; and now, as a proof of their fuc- 
cefs, and that they find no danger in the experiment, it is 
no uncommon thing, to fee fve and twenty London fmacks 

Vol. XX. 3 X at 

' * It was principally at the instigation, and by the encouragement of Sir 
John Sinclair, that the Meffirs Falls engaged in this undertaking. The confe- 
quence was, that great numbers of men, were fo muchaccuftomed to the fea, 
as to be little inclined to enter into the military fervice, when he raifed his 
two battalions of Fencibles. Hence it maybe inferred, that when agri- 
culture, commerce, manufactures, and the fiflieries, are eftabliflied all over 
the Highlands, the military fpirit will of courfe fubfide, and the military 
itrength of the country muft be diminiflied.

at once lying at anchor in Scrabftcr Roads. They cotnt 
upon the coaft in September, and continue until March ; and 
no fooncr carry one cargo of live filh to market, than they 
return for acothcr. For the molt part, they fifh in Pent- 
land Frith, through the day time, and in the evenings re- 
turn to Scrabfler Roads, to lie during the night. But fome- 
timcs they run. as far to the weftward as Cape Wrath, and 
■when they do not find it convenient to return to Scrabftcr 
Roads, they take fhelter in Loch Eribol, or Erripool. 

Our native fifhermcn, do not bear the London fmacks the 
befl good will ; they complain that they carry off the fifii 
which they fbould catch ; and it is certain, that when our 
Thurfo fifhers catch few cod, the London fmacks pick them 
up in abundance ; but the reafon is obvious, the fmacks fifh 
with mufcles or whelks for bait, which are far fuperior to 
the limpet, always ufed by the Thurfo fifhers. 

That the fmack cod-fiihing, might be carried on to advan- 
tage by ourfelves, can admit of no doubt, unlefs we were 
to fuppofe it poflible, that the London fifhmongers, would 
confider it as interfering with their trade, and combine to 
difappoint us of a market for our fifh. One thing is cer- 
tain, that we could fifh at lefs expence than they do, by em- 
ploying the country fifhermen, who would be content with 
lower wages, and cheaper provifions, than is given on board 
the Englifh fmacks. Thefe now employ occafionally fome 
of the Thurfo fifhers, as extra hands, and pay them 12 s. per 
week of wages, and allow them all the fmall filh they 
catch to themfelves. The Englifh fifhers receive 18 s. per 
Week. 

CHAP. XII. POLICE AND SUPPLY. 

Sect. I. Fairs. — It was obferved, in chapter 3, that 
by the charter of erection of the burgh, power was grant- 
ed for holding weekly markets within the fame, with 

four 



of Thurfo. 



5^7 



four free fairs yearly ; but that of the yearly fairs, only two 
are in ufe to be held, viz. one on St Peter's Day, and one 
commencing in Auguft, and ending in September. 

Sect. II. Markets. — The weekly markets are held re- 
gularly every Friday, and afford to the inhabitants a hire 
and regular fupply of butcher-meat, fifh, poultry, and gar- 
den fluffs. Not many years ago, thefe articles were to be 
had at very moderate prices ; beef and mutton fo low as I d. 
or if d. per lb. weight ; but now a pound of beef or mutton 
cannot be bought under 4 d. and the fmalleft quantity of 
beef that can be purchafed, is a quarter ; fo that, in fact, the 
confumer pays equal to 5 d. or 6 d. per lb. for choice pieces. 
Other articles of provifions have advanced in the fame pro- 
portion. A goofe, which fold for 8 d. now draws 1 s. 6 d. or 
is. 8 d. ; and a barn-yard fowl, which fold currently for 
3d. now gives 5 d. or 6d. Fifh has nlfo inxreafed two or 
threefold in price ; but ffill it is not unreasonably high, and 
always to be had in abundance, that is, cod, haddocks, flat 
fifh, great quantities of a kind of fifli here called cuddies, 
and, at certain feafons, myriads of a fmall fifh here called 
fellocks. Thefe two laft, befides affording a cheap diet to 
the lower claffes, yield a good deal of oil from their livers, 
which gives a cheap light to the manufacturers and trades 
people. 

Sect. III. Co?ifumption of Cattle, Fifh, and other Ar- 
ticles. — It is not eafy to afcertain, with correftnefs, the num- 
ber of black cattle confirmed annually at Thurfo, but it 
runs from 200 to 300 head. There is a very ccnfiderable 
number of flaughtered fheep and fvvine, likewife bought and 
fold in the weekly markets, but the number cannot be af- 
certained with any degree of precifion ; and to hazard even 
a guefs at the quantity of fifh brought to market, would be 
ftill more precarious and uncertain.

SECT. IV. Supply of Fuel. — The fuel mod generally ufe J 
in Thurfo is peat and turf ; but, of late years, coal has become 
the favourite fire with the better fort of people, and every 
}-ear increafes the importation of coals to Thurfo •, and though, 
notwithstanding the exemption from duty, it ftill fells as 
high, nay, higher than when the duty was paid, yet fuch 
is the advanced price of peats, that fuch of the inhabitants 
as ufe coal, find it the cheaper firing of the two •, and in all 
probability, a few years more, will bring coals into general 
ufe in town. It fhould feem ftrange, that the taking off the 
duty on coals, reckoned fo heavy a grievance to the nor- 
thern parts of Scotland, fhould afford the confumer no ac- ' 
tual relief in the price of the commodity. But fuch is the 
cafe, at leaft in Caithnefs, where, in facl, the price of 
both Englifh and Scotch coals are higher than when the 
duty was exacted. The merchant pleads the advance of ] 
freight and feamens wages, in confequence of the war, and 
the time which veffels fent to load coals in the Frith of 
Forth, muft lie at the works, before they can get their car- \ 
goes, owing to the additional demand. But allowing to * 
both thefe confederations their due weight, yet ftill x6s. or 
17 s. per ton for Scotch coals, and 20 s. or 21 s. per ton for 
Englifh coals, is certainly too high a price. 

Sect. V. Prices of Labour. — As the prices of provi- 
fions have advanced, fo have the prices of labour hkewife.

CHAP. XIII. MANNERS AND CUSTOMS. 

Sect. I. Public Amufements.-—T\\Q people in general 
are remarkably fober, regular, and attentive to bufinefs. 
Their favourite, and indeed only public amufement, is dan- 
cing, in which they are excellent proficients. 

Sect. II. Societies and Clubs. — They have no clubs, but 
there are four friendly focieties in town, each of which has 
its peculiar rules and regulations, and a fund for the re- 
lief of indigent members, &amp;c. Thefe are, the Society of 
Weavers, Fifliers, Trades, and United Craftfmen. The 
laft is only lately eftablifhed, but promifes to be the richeft 
fociety of the four. 

There is a lodge of Free Ma&amp;ns, both numerous and re- 
fpettable, called Thurfo St John's, which ftands No 45. in 
the roll of Scotch lodges. On feftival days, from 50 to 60 
Brethren commonly attend, and fuch is the ftate of their 
funds, that they have it now in contemplation, to build an 
elegant lodge-room, which they propofe to add to the new 
town-houfe. 

Sect. III. Inns. — There are two very good inns in 
town ; and the one having been lately fet up, in oppofition 
to the other, has begot an emulation, and a fpirit of rival - 
fliip in both, which operates favourably to the traveller and 
the public. Mr Morrifon, the fenior innkeeper, is juft now 
finilhing a large affembly room, which he has added to his 
houfe, which will furpafs any thing of the kind to the north- 
ward of Invernefs. The dimenlions are 37 feet long, by 
187 feet wide, and 16 feet in height. This innkeeper is 
deferving of encouragement from the public, and he meets 
with it.

CHAP. XIV. ARTS AND SCIENCES. 

Under this branch, all that can be looked for in thefe 
hints, is, to enumerate the number of perfons, of each profef- 
fion, reiident in Thurfo, or connected with it. 

Sect. I. Law. — There are a greater number of limbs of I 
the /aw in Thurfo, than in many places of much greater extent. 
There are no fewer than eight public notaries, five of whom 
are meffengers at arms ; and there is, befides, one mefienger 
who is not a notary. For the credit of the country, how- 
ever, it is fair to add, that leis than one half the number of 
this profeffion, would be fully adequate to the bufinefs both 
in town and country ; and that the fpirit of litigation, for 
which the people of Caithnefs were too long diftinguifhed, 
in the records of the courts of law, is now happily begin- 
ning to fubfide. 

Sect. II. Phyjic. — There are now three furgeons fet- 
tled in Thurfo, all active young men, which indeed their 
iituation requires them to be ; for, in the winter feafons, the 
practice of Caithnefs is peculiarly trying to the conftitution 
of this clafe of the community. Thefe are the only medical 
perfons in the country who have received a regular educa- 
tion. 

SECT. III. Divinity. — There is but one clergyman of 
the Eftabliflied Church in Thurfo. 

There is a feceder chapel in town, but it is at prefent va- 
cant, by the death of the laft incumbent, Mr Dowie, who ' 
was an inofFenfive and well-meaning man. 

The followers of Meflrs Haldane and Aikman, are col- 
lecting fubferiptions for building a Kirk of Relief, and pro- 
viding a ftipend for a minifter, from among the Miflionarian

tribe ; but how far their endeavours may ultimately prove 
fucce&amp;ful, feems at prefent doubtful. 

Sect. IV. Mufic— The violin, and Highland bag-pipe, 
are the only mufical inftruments, played on by profeffional 
men in Thurfo. The Highland reels are played particular- 
ly well, on both thefe inftruments, in Caithnefs ; but the 
proper flow bag-pipe tunes and marches, are not given in 
that perfection here, which feems almoft peculiar to the 
Weft Highland pipers. 

Sect. V. Painting. — In the department of painting, 
Thurfo has to boaft of giving birth to an artift of confider- 
able merit as a portrait-painter, in the perfon of Mr Macin- 
tosh, whofe father was parifli-fchoolmafter of Thurfo. His 
fon, at an early period of life, difcovered a natural genius 
for painting. He afterwards ftudied at London, and is now 
an eminent portrait-painter at Mofcow in Ruflia. 

Under this head, it may be proper to take notice, of two 
young ladies, (the Mifs Liddles), natives of Thurfo, now 
in Edinburgh, who poflefs a great turn or genius both for 
mufic and painting. There are miniature pictures drawn 
by thefe ladies, fome taken from the life, and others copied, 
which would do no difcredit to the pencil of the firft ar- 
tifts. 

Sect. VI. Poetry. — The celebrated Highland bard, Ro- 
bert Donn, alias Mackay, was a native of Strathnaver, not 
far diftant from Thurfo. His poems and his fongs are no 
flranger to the amateurs of Gaelic verfe ; and, considering 
that the author had none of the advantages of education, in- 
deed that he could neither read nor write, the force of his na- 
tural genius has juftly excited admiration, A clergyman of

Sutherland, lately deceafed, was at fome pains to collect 
Robert Donn's works, and commit them to writing, with 
a defign to have them publifhed. Th« manufcript, was 
lately laid before the Highland Society of Edinburgh, un-. 
der whole patronage, they will foon, it is hoped, be given 
to the public. 

There is a gentleman of the fame name, (Mackay), a native

jj^that line, by no means amifs. He is Adjutant to the Thur- 
fo Volunteers, and as .a fpecimen of his poetical abilities,

Sect. VII. Eminent Men. — The Ofwalds of Glafgow, 
who have long been eminent merchants, derived their ori- 
gin from Thurfo. Their anceftor was one of the Bailies of 
Thurfo, in the laft century. Richard Ofvvald, late mer- 
chant in London, and one of the Plenipotentiaries from the 
Court of Great Britain at fettling the peace of 1783, was,

CHAP. XV. MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. 

Sect. I. Antiquities. — The antiquities to be taken no- 
tice of in this diftricl, are the following, namely, ijl, An 
arch, at Thurfo Eaft, the feat of Sir John Sinclair; 
idly, The burial place of Harold Earl of Caithnels ; and, 
%dly, The Pi&amp;s houfes, as they are called, which formerly 
abounded in this part of the kingdom. 

x. The arch at Thurfo Eaft, or Thurfo Caftle as it is fome- 
times called, was built in the year 1665, and perhaps is the 
moft ornamental piece of architecture in the north. The 
contract between George, Earl of Caithnefs, and Donald 
Rofs, mafter mafon, for the building of that arch, is ftill on 
record ; from which it appears, that the agreed price was 
600 merks, a considerable fum in thofe days. The arch 
has been lately repaired, and promifes to laft for many years 
longer. 

2. The earldom of Caithnefs was formerly pofleffed by a 
family of the name of Harold, fome account of whofe hi- 
ftory is given by Torfaeus, the Danifh hiftorian, extracts of 
which may be feen in Mr Pennant's Tours. One of thofe 
warriors was killed in the neighbourhood of Thurfo, and 
the ftones, marking the place where his body was buried, 
were well known by tradition. The late Mr Alexander 
Pope, minifter of Reay, who was the greateft antiquary in 
the north, knew this circumftance well, and being anxious 
to have that ancient monument preferved, drew up the fol- 
lowing 



of Tburfo.

lowing petition, in the name of Earl Harold, and fent it to 
the Author. 

" Earl Harold the Younger to the Laird of Ulbster. 

** Know, Sir, that I was {lain in battle, about the year 
" 1 190, near your park of Kirkwall, and buried within that 
f* piece of ground, and had an elegant chapel ere&amp;ed over 
" m y grave, the ftones whereof are built now in your inclo- 
" fure in that place. I had once a right to half of Orkney 
" and Zetland, alfo to the half of Caithnefs, and an eftate 
" in Sutherland, where I was born. My right to Ork- ' 
" ney and Zetland, I derived from the King of Norway, 
" and to Caithnefs, from King William the Lyon of Scot- 
" land. I loft my life in battle, endeavouring to recover 
" my property out of the hands of a wicked and daring ty- 
f* rant, Earl Harold the Eider, juftly ftyled Wicked Earl 
" Harold. Be pleafed to inclofe my grave in a decent 
" manner, fo as not to become the refting- place of animals, 
or that my bones be not ploughed up. My grave is now 
" all my eftate, which ought to be held inviolable. By fo 
" doing, you fliew a noble example to others, to honour the 
" memory of the brave, though unfortunate ; you make re- 
" ftitution, as my chapel is now carried away ; you give a 
" caution to others, not to violate the fepulchres of the 
" dead ; and it will yield you the moft manly and fenfible 
" pleafure, to have done an a£tion commendable in itfelf, 
" and which will perpetuate your memory to pofterity. 

" Farewell, and pro/per." 

In confequence of this application, the author was tempt- 
ed to erect a monument to Earl Harold, an engraving of 
which is annexed, and which has proved a confiderable or- 
nament to the neighbourhood.

3. It is well known, that the northern parts of Scotland, 
were formerly inhabited by the Pidtifh tribes, and many 
cpnftrudtions of a fingular nature, known under the name of 
Pitts Houfes, are fcattered over the county of Caithnefs. In 
the courfe of carrying on his improvements, the author was 
led, feveral years ago, to examine one of thefe buildings, 
and he drew up, at the time, the following hints, refpecling 
their nature and conftru&amp;ion. 

The foundation of the houfe was laid with clay, but they 
feem to have been totally unacquainted with the ufe of lime 
as a cement ; nor was even clay itfelf made ufe of in the 
upper part of the building. 

Many of the ftones were of an enormous fize, and evi- 
dently brought from the more, though the diftance is not in- 
confiderable. They could neither be carried there, nor af- 
terwards made ufe of, without great ftrength, or ingenious 
mechanical inventions. 

Some earthen ware was difcovered, very rudely manu- 
factured, a fufficient proof ap how low an ebb the arts were 
in the Pidtiflt nations. 

A few fmall copper coins were found in the ruins, but 
much defaced, and the letters engraved illegible. 

From the number of horns and fhells found in the houfe, 
it is probable that the principal food of the inhabitants con- 
iifted of venifon, and the fhell-nfh called limpets. The bones 
of cattle were alfo difcovered, which proves that pafturage 
was not wholly unknown. 

The Picls feem to have been acquainted with the ufe of 
iron, for a knife was found calculated for taking*the lim- 
pets off the rocks, and fuch as is in ufe to this day. 

Some fingular articles made of bone were difcovered, the 
nails by which they were fixed were of bone alfo, but the 
ufe of them is unknown. 

The

The entrance into the houfe was low and winding, and 
tradition fays, when the men went out a-hunting, that their 
wives and families were rendered inaccefiible, by large 
itones placed both within and without, to exclude beafts of 
prey, or more dangerous enemies. 

On the whole, the Pifts as far as we can judge from 
thefe buildings, feetn to have been a rude nation, poflefled 
of flrong bodies, but of untutored minds, and living in fuch 
a ftate, that the pooreft peafant now enjoys better food, and 
more comfort, than the mod powerful chieftain could boaft 
of in thofe days of barbarifm. 

Sect. II. Mines. — Many appearances of a mineral na- 
ture have been found in this parifh and the neighbourhood; 
in particular, anno 1797, fome very rich pieces of lead-ore 
were got, oppofite to the bleachfield, but it would feem, 
from their appearance, the edges being much worn and 
rounded, that they mull have come from a higher part of 
the river. In 1796, the Author had fome correfpondence 
with a Lead Company, (No. 9. Martin's Lane, Cannon 
Street, London), and on that occafion drew up the follow- 
ing propofals, which it may not be improper to preferve. 

Propofals tranfmitted by Sir John Sinclair to the Lead 
Company, for letting a Leafe of the Mine of Skinnet, 
in the County of Caithnefs, North Britain, anno 1790. 

The Hill of Skinnet is about four Englifli miles from 
the town and harbour of Thurfo, in the county of Caith- 
nefs. It is the property of Sir John Sinclair of Ulbfter, and 
an idea being very prevalent, that fome mines exifted in that 
place, Sir John was led, in the courfe of the year 1787,10 
endeavour to difcover the nature of the ore which might be 
found there ; and in tracing the courfe of what is called in 

. that 



53§ 



Statiflkal Account 



that country a hum (or rivulet), he accidentally hit upon 
a fmall vein of yellow mundick, of about 3 inches in 
breadth ; and upon digging a little deeper, he met with a 
great mafs of white mundick, feveral cart-loads of which 
were dug up without the fmalleft difficulty. 

Upon mewing fpecimens of thefe articles to perfons 
ikilled in mineralogy, particularly to fome Cornifli miners, 
they told him, that the mundicks he had found, however 
brilliant, were in themfelves of no real value ; but they in- 
formed him, in their technical language, "that mundick, in 
" fuch quantities, was a good Cgn of more valuable veins : 
*' That the white mundick, in particular, was a good horfe- 
" man, and always rode on a good load." And, in fliort, 
prefled him to make further trials and inquiries. 

Mr Rafpe, a German mineralogift, having come into the 
county of Caithnefs laft autumn, (anno 1789), was employ- 
ed by Sir John Sinclair to make trials in the fame place ; 
and not far from the mundick, he difcovered a regular vein 
of heavy fpar, mixed with lead and cryftals, three feet in 
breadth, and very near the fpot where the mundick was 
found. No further progrefs was made, than merely to as- 
certain the fize of the vein, and the nature of the metal 
which it contained. 

Sir John does not propofe to work this mine himfelf, and 
is very well difpofed to give every reafonable encourage- 
ment to any refpe&amp;able Company that would undertake it. 

The Company would have feveral advantages in carry- 
ing on this mine. The miners and other workmen, and 
any tools that might be neceflary, might be tranfported by 
fea to the town of Thurlo, within four miles of the vein. 

Any additional workmen that might be required, might 
be "ot at an eafy rate, labour not being very dear in the 



country 



The 



of Thurfo. 



539 



The road, at prefent, from Skinnet to Thurfo is not very 
good, but it might be completed at a fmall expence. 

Peats or turf, for fuel, are fcarce, but of water there is 
abundance, and coals may be tranfported by fea to Thurfo. 

The value of the mine might be tried at a fmall expence, 
as it lies on the fide of a hill, gently Hoping about half-a- 
mile higher than the river Thurfo ; but with fuch a defcent 
to the river, that no engine would be neceflary for clearing 
off the water. 

Were this mine not to anfwer, there are many other ap- 
pearances on the eftate of Sir John Sinclair, and on the pro- 
perty of other gentlemen in the neighbourhood, which 
might be well worthy the attention of the Company. 

After fome correfpondence upon the fubjeft, the plan 
was dropped, the Company refufing to fend their agent to 
view the premifes, unlefs the proprietor was to be at the 
whole expence of the furvey. There are certainly, how- 
ever, fome valuable mines in that neighbourhood, either in 
the parifli of Thurfo, or that of Halkirk, which, it is to be 
hoped, will, fome time or other, be worked to advantage. 

Sect. III. Quarries. — In every part of the parifli there 
are quarries of whin-ftone, and in fome places of grey flate, 
which are frequently ufed in covering the roofs of houfes. 
In the fliores of Scrabfter and Pennyland, there is, as for- 
merly obferved, a good free-done quarry below flood-mark, 
but acceffible and eafily wrought at low-water. 

Sect. IV. Natural Curiofties. — The rocks which bound 
the coafl; from Holburnhead to Brims Caftle, exhibit various 
fcenes of natural grandeur. The Clett is an infulated rock 
of great height, feparated from the land by a deep channel, 
not above 80 yards acrofs at the broadeft part. The rock 
itfelf is perpendicular on all fides, and may be about 160 

yards 



5-P 



Statiftical Account 



yards long, and half that breadth. Its height is fuppofed 
to be about 400 feet above the furface of the fea. It is 
well worth the vifking, particularly in the months of May, 
June, and July, when it is frequented by immenfe flocks of 
fea fowl, chiefly gulls, cormorants, and marrots, which come 
there to neftle. The marrots range themfelves in regular 
lines on the (helves of the rock, and being rather a filly 
unfufpedting bird, they frequently fall in dozens to the fliot 
of the cruel fportfman, who reaps no other advantage from 
his prey, except the favage pleafure of deftroying it. Thefe 
birds have an excellent plumage, and their feathers might 
be turned to good account ; but as yet no attempts to that 
effecT: have been made. Their flelh is eat only by the fi- 
fhermen, who indeed value it fo much, that, with a toler- 
able markfman, they will pafs a day at the Clett mooting, 
without alking any other confideration for their trouble. 

Sect. V. Mineral Springs. — There are no mineral 
fprings of any note in the parifh, nor indeed within the 
county, except near Wick, where there is a copious mine- 
ral fpring, the waters of which feems to partake of the na- 
ture and qualities of the Peterhead Waters. 

Sect. VI. Natural Hijiory. — Nothing remarkable oc- 
curs in this department.

Sect. I. Live-Stock. — In an account taken in March 
1797, of the live and dead flock of the county of Caithnefs,

■ ■■ — hogs, - - 280 



Sect. II. Produce. — It would be difficult to afcertaia 
the produce of the parifh with perfecl accuracy, the lower 
clauses of farmers being always very unwilling to divulge 
what they fow, or what they reap, from their farms ; but 
from the beft calculation of which the cafe is capable, the 
annual produce may be taken in the following proportions : 

Oats, - * 1x998 bolls. 

Bear, - - 41 13 

Potatoes, - - 918  

Turnips, - - 15 acres. 

Meadow hay or natural grafs, 3000 ftones.

SECT! IV. Mills. — There are ten corn mills, one flax 
mill, and two fnulF mills in the parilh ; but not well fup- 
plied with water, excepting in the winter feafon. 

Sect. V. Gardens. — In the immediate neighbourhood 
of the town there is a public garden, containing feven acres 
of ground, which, with the garden of Geife, fupplies the 
town plentifully with vegetables. There are a few private 
gardens in the parilh, but thefe are indifferently attended 
to. 

Sect. VI. Woods and Plantations. — There is no natu- 
ral wood in the parilh, and the few attempts made in the 
planting way have not been fuccefsful. It is in contempla- 
tion, however, to plant foreft trees along the banks of the 
Thurfo, which, there is little doubt, will thrive, and prove 
equally ufeful and ornamental. 

Sect. VII. Commons. — There are large tradTs of valu- 
able commons in the parilh, very capable of cultivation, and 
hitherto, nothing has contributed fo much to their lying fo 
long in a ftate of nature, as their remaining undivided. 

Sect. VIII. Rural Improvements. — The lirft ftep to- 
wards improving thofe commons, muft be a divifion of the 
property, fo as to afcertain each proprietor's fhare and inte- 
reft therein. This being once effefted, he would be blind in- 
deed to his own intereft. who did not fet to work with 
heart and hand, to cultivate and improve his portion of fuch 
wafte lands. 

For fuch improvements there are many natural advan- 
tages, by the facility with which lime may be imported, 
by the fea-ware driven upon the coaft, and by the fea-fand, 
which can be had in any quantity, and which the people 

of 



of Thurfo. 543 



of Cornwall, at the other end of the ifland, find fo produc- 
tive and valuable, that they carry it, on the back of horfes, 
for many miles, and, with its affiftance, raife wheat on the 
moft barren moors *. 

CONCLUSION. 

Sect. I. Peculiar Advantages of Thurfo in its prefent 
State. — in its prefent ftate, Thurfo is well fituated for trade, 
manufactures, and fiflieries. It has ready accefs to the na- 
vigation of the Atlantic and German Oceans, and its pro- 
ductions are well calculated for the trade of both. Situs ted 
in a country where provifions are cheap, manufactures of 
various kinds might be carried on to advantage ; and in few 
places on the coaft of Scotland, can fifheries be profecuted, 
with greater certainty of fuccefs, than on the coaft of Caitli- 
nefs. In fhort, nothing feems wanting except an increafe 
of capital, and the example of a few enterprifing merchants 
and manufacturers, to make Thurfo a flouriming and an 
opulent place. Without thofe aids, it is already advancing 
rapidly towards improvement, merely through the indu- 
ftry and exertions of a few individuals, of moderate capi- 
tals. 

Sect. II. Improvements fuggejled. — The harbour may 
be improved at a fmall expence •, and a pier at Scrabfter 
could be erected for lefs than L. 2000, which would be of 
great public utility. The depth of water, the vicinity of 
excellent ftone for the purpofe, are advantages which that 
place pofleffes in a peculiar degree. 

It is peculiarly well calculated, for a ftation to the Britifh 
Fiftiing Society, if a plan for that purpofe could be arranged 
among the parties interefted. 

It

It mull be acknowledged, that the police of the town ad- 
mits of great improvements indeed. The ftreets are in a 
molt wretched ftate, though the inhabitants would cheer- 
fully contribute to new- pave them, if a plan for that pun- 
pofe were fet on foot. As an inducement to them to aflefs 
themfelves for that purpofe, the fuperior intends to allow 
the cuftoms of the public markets, to be applied fpr a limi- 
ted time to that purpofe. 

The want of a bridge acrofs the river is a great inconve- 
niency, both to the town and the furrounding county ; but 
without public aid, there is little profpect of getting that in- 
conveniency removed. 

Two plans have been propofed for erecting a bridge over 
this river; one of timber, and the other of ftone. The tim- 
ber bridge was intended to be 363 feet long, and the efti- 
mate of the expence was L. 211, 16 s. A plan of the 
ftone bridge was drawn up by that excellent engineer, John 
Rennie, Efq-, of New Surrey Street, London, and the fol- 
lowing was the eftimate he drew up : 

To 30 roods of mafon-work in the wing walls and fpan- 
drills, at L. 7 per rood, - L. 210 o 9 

To 15 roods in piers and abuttments, at 

L. 8, 8 s. - - 126 0 o 

To 6588 cubic feet of (lone- work in arches,

arches, - - ^4 10 o

The want of a prifon is likewife a ferious evil. It 
weakens the hands of the magiftrate, however willing he 
may be to do his duty. For at prefent the fmalleft mifde- 
meanor cannot be punifhed by imprifonment, without fend- 
ing the offender to the county jail of Wick, at the diftance 
of 20 miles from Thurfo, which necefiarily occafions a hea- 
vy expence to the profecutor, public or private, and, of 
courfe, is the caufe of mapy offences paffing with impunity, 
which would otherwife meet their due punifhment. 

Sect. III. General Refult. — We have thus exhibited, 
what appears to us, a model, well calculated for drawing up 
the Statiftical Account of a diftricl:, where the commerce 
and other circumftanpes connected with a town, are the fole, 
or even the principal objects meriting attention. In a coun- 
try diftrict, however, a different arrangement muft be fol- 
lowed, and the number of heads or articles will of courfe be 
fewer. 

On the whole, in regard to this diftricl:, it muft furnifh 
the reader, who refides at a diftance from it, with no incon- 
fiderable degree of fatisfadtion, to have thus laid before 
him, fo minute an account, of fo remote a parifti ; and to 
fee, that a foundation is there laid, for promoting the im- 
provement of the country, and the comfort of its inhabi- 
tants *. — What important effects, it may be added, may not 
be expected, fhould a fimilar fpirit be excited in, and fpread 
over, every other part of the kingdom ? It would foon ren- 
der Great Britain, not only the richeft and moft powerful, 
but alfo the happieft country in the univerfe., 

* It was the. fuccefs which attended the Author's agricultural purfuits, 
in fo remote a part of the kingdom, which firft imprefied him, with a full 
conviction, of the improvements that might be made, in a better climate, 
and where other advantages were attainable. Hence, in a great meafure, 
proceeded, the eftablifliment of a Board of Agriculture, and all the advan- 
tages which will probably refult, from that important ioftkution.

Oh/ovations on the preceding "talks. 



It is evident, that the quantity of ftock, the amount of annua! produce, 
and the value of each, are articles' liable to perpetual fluctuation. But 
though minute accuracy cannot be expected, yet it is extremely deniable, 
Jo have fome general ideas of fuch important particulars ; and when the cal- 
culations are grounded on furficiertt data, and relate to an extenfive diftridl, 
(a county for example), the average refult will probably be very near the 
truth, the errors of the fubdivifions in the diftrict, balancing each other. 

It appears from the table of annual produce, that there arc in the parifh 
of Thurfo, about 4,000 acres of arable land, and that die value of live-ftock 
is 9,144, or about L. « : 5 : 6 per acre. But as part of that ftock is paftu- 
red upon commons, the whole produce of the cultivated land will not ex- 
ceed L. 8000, or about L. 2 per acre. It alfo appears, that the total pro- 
duce of the land, amounts to about L. 8,626. The land-rent is ftated at 
L. 4,714 : 5 : 6 ; which multiplied by 5, would amount to L. 8,570. It is 
evident therefore, that the produce is equal to more than 5 rents, which 
mult always be the cafe, where farms are fmall, and where the produce pt* 
acre is inconliderable.

On the celebrated draught of Salmon in the River Thurfo. 



Jn the preceding Statistical Account, Chap. II. Sect. I. mention was 
made of the celebrated draught of falmon in the river of Thurfo, when no 
lefs a number than 2560 were caught. That circumftance has been often 
mentioned, but feemed incredible to many, who were not acquainted with 
the circumstances attending that event With a view of having the fact 
afcertained, the following certificate was given by three perfons, who wit- 
nefled the tranfaction, and are of unquestioned veracity. 

" We, George Paterfon, now bailie of Thurfo, George Swanfon, fhoema- 
ker there, and Donald Finlayfon fenior, filher there, do hereby certify and 
declare, That upon the 23d day of July, Old Style, we think in the year 1743, 
or 1744, there were caught, at one haul, in the Cruive Pool, upon the water 
above the town of Thurfo, two tboufand Jive hundred and fixty falrnon. 
Thefe fifh were caught by a large net, beginning the fweep at the cruives, 
and coming down the ftream to a ftem at the low end of the pool. The 
net was carried down the water by from 18 to 20 men, with long poles in 
their hands, keeping down the ground rope, and the fifli were afterwards 
taken afhore, by degrees, in a finaller net. Each man got a fifh and fome 
whifky for his trouble. We farther certify and declare, That we were per- 
fonally prefent when thefe fifh were caught.

Qbjcrvatiqru on Scrabjler Road, or "T/jurjo Bay. 



X HE following obfeivations, drawn up by perfons of great intelligence in 
the fea faring line, and of much experience in the navigation of the neigh- 
bourhood of Thurfo, are particularly recommended to tiie attention of thofe, 
who navigate veflels in the northern fens, by adverting to which, many vef- 
fels may be faved from deftruction. 

OBSERVATIONS on Scrabfter Road, or Thurfo Bay, near the Pcntlann 
Frith, in Scotland, particularly recommended to the attention of Vffi'eh 
in the Baltic, Dutch, or Hamburgh trades, failing from Ireland or the 
weltern ccafts of Scotland or England. 

Since Mr Murdoch Mackenzie has navrgated and furveyed the Pentland 
Frith, it is found by experience, to be the fafeft and heft channel to fail 
through, n orn the Weftern Iflands of Scotland to the German Ocean, or the 
jeverfe ; and at prefent the greateft part of the ibips from Liverpool, 
Whitehaven, Ireland, Solvvay Frith, and Frith of Clyde, in the Baltic, 
Dutch, and Hamburgh trades, frequently pafs and repafs through that 
Frith. 

Mr Mackenzie has furveyed, with great accuracy and exactnefs, the 
coaft of Orkney, ai.d given proper directions for failing into the different 
harbours there; but he has neglected to take notice of Scrabtter Road or 
Thurfo Bay, on the coaft of Caithnefs, and this iliameful negligence, of late 
years, has been attended with the molt fatal confequences, by the lofs of 
many valuable live? fhip.% and cargoes, betwixt Dunnet Head and Cape 
Wrath, (about 10 leagues diftant from each other) ; for when fhips are 
caught with a hard gale of wind from N. N W. to N. N. E. the com- 
manders, knowing of no place of fafety from the main land, are at laft re- 
duced to the necelfity of running the fhip afhore, to favc, if poffible, the 
Jives of the crew. 

From a love to mankind, and the good of commerce, Sir John Sinclair 
pf Ulhfter, Earonet, de fired us William Lines, fhipmafter in Thurfo, and 
John Dunnet, fliipmafier there, and Branch Pilot, from the Trinity Houfe 
pf NeWcaftle upon Tyne, to found, furvey, and give proper directions, for 
qStfhbVth* in Scrabfter Road or Thurfo Bay. .As the knowledge of this 

place. 



Appendix. 

place is of the utmoft importance to commerce, we obeyed with all the at- 
tention and accuracy in our power, Sir John's orders, and have annexed the 
following directions to failors. 

From Dunnet' Head to Holburn Head, failing up the Bay to Scrabfter 
Road, the courfe is W. S. W. diftance 8 miles. Holburn Head fliore is quite 
clean-, and- about 14 fathoms deep within half a cable's length of the" fliore. 

From Holburn Head, to a low green point commonly called the Little 
Head, the courfe is S..W. a little more than a quarter of a mile diftant. 
After paffing the Little Head, you will obferve, on the ftarboard hand, a 
large houfe, with three chimney tops. 

The proper anchoring place for large fliips, is by keeping the above- 
mentioned houfe of Holburn Head above the land, and to bear N. by W. to 
keep Holburn Head on the point of the Little Head, the Houfe of Scrabfter 
bearing W. by S. and the eaft end of the town of Thurfo S. by E. There 
you may anchor in fix fathom, good ground, two cable's length from the 
fliore. 

But fmall craft are to fliut in Holburn Head on the Little Head, and to 
come fo near the fliore, as only to fee the chimney head of the above houfe, 
where they may anchor in 4 fathom water, and moor to Tings fixed in the 
rocks, where they ride in great fafety with winter ftorms. The fliore is 
fteep on both fides, and no invifible rocks in Thurfo Bay ; and any rock 
grounds which exift, are no ways dangerous to fliipping, as there are no lefs 
than 7 fathom water on them at low fpring-tides ; but with ftrong gales of 
wind at N. and N. N. W. the fea breaks on them. They lie E. from 
Holburn Head near two miles, and Dunnet Head bears from them E. by N. 
1 leagues; Hoy Head N. N. E. 10 leagues; the town of Thurfo S. W. 
by S. 3 miles ; but in running for Scrabfter Road, with hard gales of wind 
from N. and N. N. W. the Holburn Head fliore fliould be kept clofe on 
board, and to anchor with the wind off fliore where the fmall craft are di- 
rected ; but after going a fweep of cable, to moor to the S. E. agreeable 
to the directions given to large fliips. 

N. B. The above bearings are laid down by the common magnetic eom- 
pafs, and pilots may be expected either from Thurfo or Scrabfter, in hard 
gales of wind,- At the town of Thurfo alfo, veffels may be fupplied with 
provifions p nil other articles they may ftand in need of, at reafonable rates.

On the Northern Light-houfes. 



IT being a material queftion to the navigation of tlie northern parts of 
Scotland, to have light houfes erected in the fitted places, it was thought 
proper to preferve, the following obfervations, by Captain John Dunnet 
upon that interefting fubject, tranfrnitted in a letter to the Author, in 
December 1793. 



M I beg leave to lay before you, the following piece of information, as to' 
the northern light-houfes. I have failed from Thurfo, in the county of Caith- 
nefs, upwards of 25 years, andalmoft the whole of the above period, I have 
had the command of a veflel. By which means, it may be reafonably fuppofed, 
that I have obtained a complete knowledge of the navigation of the Pent- 
land Frith, fetting and velocity Qf the tides, Sec. Sec. I have it from un- 
doubted authority, that a light houfe is to be erected at the entrance of the 
Portland Frith, either on the largelt Pentland Skerry, near the coaft of Ork- 
ney, or on Duncanibay Head, on the coaft of Caitluiefs. This light-houfc, 
if built in a proper place, muft prove highly beneficial to the numerous 
veflels that palies and repaffes through this well frequented channel. 

I am likewife informed, that the Pentland Skerry is the place pointed out 
by feveral gentlemen, as the moft proper fpot to build the light houfe upon, 
which furprifes me not a little, as, in my opinion, a light houfe built on 
the Skerry, might be productive of bad confequences to ftraHgers, and of no 
real advantage to thofe who are well acquainted with the navigation of the 
Pentland Frith. For this I give the following reefons : 

ift, 



Appendix. 553 

at, The only foul or rocky ground in the entrance of the Frith, lies to 
Ae eaftward of the Skerries. A ftranger, running for the Skerry light, 
if it fliould happen to be obfcured by mift or otherwife, may be a ground 
on the rocks before he is aware of his danger. 2d, If the mafter of a fliip, 
with a clear night, fliould run to make the Skerry light, and makes the 
light, bearing W. N. W. by the compafs 3 leagues or 9 miles diftant, and 
the tide of ebb running, if the fhip fliould happen to be becalmed, (he rum 
a great rifle of being carried on the Skerry, or the rocky ground adjacent, 
by the velocity of the tide, which runs 9 knots or 9 miles an hour in fpring- 
tides. 3d. Amitting that the above mentioned fliip fliould get clear of the 
rocky ground with the tide of ebb, and is carried by it as far as the N. E. 
point of the ifland of Swinna, if fhe happens to meet the tide of flood, the 
calm continuing, flie muft inevitably be hawled on the Skerries, as the tide 
runs exactly in that direction. 

More objections might be pointed out againlt placing a light houfe on 
the Skerry. But as I have been already tedious, I fliall now go on to make 
my remarks on the great advantages that ihipping muft derive, by having a 
light houfe on Duncanfbay Head, as follows : 

ift, Nofs Head, on the coaft of Caithnefs, has fuch a near refemblance of 
Duncanfbay Head, that fhipmaftcrs, ftanding in for the land, particularly in 
evenings, or in foggy weather, have been fo fatally deceived, that after paf- 
fing Nofs Head, they have altered their courfe, and, fuppofing themfelves 
to be in the Pentland Frith, have never difcovered their miftake, until they 
have found themfelves inibayed or faft a-ground in the Bay of Keefs, call- 
ed by failors Sinclair's Bay. This capital miftake would be effectually re- 
moved, by a light on Duncanfbay Head, which bears by the compafs 
N. E. by N. from Nofs Head about n miles diftant. ad, Duncanfbay 
Head is bold and clean. No out-lying rocks on the coaft. If the light 
Ihould be obfcured by fog or otherwife, if a fliipmafter fliould be within a 
cable's length of the light before he perceives it, he is in no danger if it 
fliould prove little wind and an ebb tide, it will carry the fhip in the proper 
fair way betwixt Stroma and Swinna ; and if the fliip be caught with the 
tide of flood, while becalmed, there will be no danger of the fhip being 
carried by the velocity of the tide on the Skerries, or any rocky ground 
whatever. 3d, A fliipmafter, making the light on Duncanfbay Head with 
a clear night, 10, 6, or 4 miles diftant, but finds the tide of ebb running, 
and is unwilling to be carried through the Pentland Frith in the night- 
time, he has it in his power to keep the fliip in flack tide, by ftanding into 
the fiiore, until he brings the light to bear N. N. E. and off, till it bear.-; 
N, N. W. The wind muft be fuppofed to be from the fouth and welt 

quarter ; 



554 



Appendix. 



quarter; here he is in no danger of being carried through the Frith, as the 
tide does not run with one-third of the velocity as it does on" the Skerries. 
A great deal more might be faid on this fubjedt, with directions to ftran- 
gers in the management of their fhips with the winds in different arts in 
the Pentland Frith and the entrance of it. But I muft conclude, leaving you 
to make any ufe of this letter that you pleafe ; and if it fhould be made 
public, I flatter myfelf that thot'e who are baft acquainted, and has molt ex- 
perience of this navigation, will coincide with me in opinion."

* Although, in Tome inftances, the fame parifli lies in two or three diffe- 
rent counties, it was judged expedient, in the following Table, to ftate the 
total population of all pariflies in that fituation under only one of the 
counties to which they refpectively belong, as no diftinction was made in 
the returns. It is alfo to be obferved, that where the population of pa- 
riflies in the following Table differs from that in the Statiftical Returns, 
it was occafioned by corrected ftatements of the number of inhabitants ha- 
ving been received fubfequent to the publication of the account of each 
fnch parifh.
