I- — Topography and Natural Histoky. 

Aberdeen, a city of considerable size and extensive com- 
merce, is situated along the left bank of the river Dee, near its 
mouth, extending about a mile from east to west, and stretching to 
nearly an equal distance northward from the river. 

Name. — Various conjectures have been formed respecting the 
etymology of the name of this city, of which the two following are 
the most worthy of notice : 

Mr Kennedy, in his Annals of Aberdeen, says, on the autho- 
rity of the late Mr Maclachlan, Rector of the Grammar- School of 
Old Aberdeen, that " the Gaelic name, Obairreadhain, pronoun- 
ced Oherrayn, signifies the town situated on the bank or space of 
ground near the entrance of two rivers ; and is composed of Ahair 
or Aher, a well-known word, and Da-ahhuinn, Da-aioin, two 
rivers, namely. Dee and Don. This analysis is exactly descrip- 
tive of the local situation of Aberdeen, which in former ages was 
almost at an equal distance from the mouths of both rivers, although 
about a century ago the channel of the Don, near the town, was 
altered, and the stream diverted straight into the sea, about a mile

further northward than its ancient efflux;" and he endeavours a 
note to give further probabiUty to this etymology, by sayuig, pro- 
bably at some very remote period, Don had -"J--/;/--- 
course still further southward down the hollow of the hnks, tdl it 
united with Dee in the harbour, and both together would form one 
stream into the ocean. Such conjecture .s m some measure con- 
firmed by the works of Ptolemy and Richard of Qrencester, 
tW being no such river as Don dehneated in then- maps m- even 
:el:d'in their tables, while Di.a Dee and Oha 
in the district of the Taixali, are particular y noticed le ear 
lier records of the burgh, the river Don is distingmshed solely by 
the name of Aqua Borealis."  

The conjecture advanced by Mr Then, in lus H,story of Aber- 
deen, is expressed in these words : " The name Aberdeen is com- 
posed of the Gaelic A-lar, and dun, which s.gn.fies the h,l m 
fh marsh. Mer, spelt Mar in Gaelic, is a -mpound owo

far-fetched to derive a part of the name of the city either from the 
supposed junction of two rivers, or from the word signifying a hill, 
when the name of the river that runs close by it supplies the syl- 
lable that is wanting, without requiring to undergo any change. 

Ptolemy places the river Diva in the territory of the Taixali, 
who occupied the most easterly part of Albion, and he mentions 
the city Devana as being in the same province. These, then, cor- 
respond with the situation of the river Dee, and of some city near 
it. The exact site of the Devana of Etolemy has been disputed ; 
" General Roy," as Mr Thom observes, " having placed it at Old 
Aberdeen, and the laborious author of Caledonia somewhere in the 
parish of Peterculter;"f the former being about a mile north from 
Aberdeen, and the latter about seven miles south-west of it, on 
the banks of the Dee. 

That the Romans adopted and Latinized the name of the river, 
seems probable from this consideration, that while in very many 
cases the Roman names given to rivers have no analogy with those 
by which they are now known, we find in several districts of the 
Celtic territories, rivers whose present names, though apparent- 
ly not of Latin derivation, are almost identical with the names 
under which they occur in the writings of Ptolemy and other an- 
cient authors, for example the Dee, in Galloway, mentioned by 
Ptolemy as the Deva in the country of the Selgovii, the Dee in 
Cheshire, called by him the Deva in the territory of the Cornabii, 
and the Deba in Guipuzcoa, which is noticed by him under the 
name of Diva in the country of the Caristi. It need not excite 
wonder that we find no vestige of the name Devana given to the 
settlement of the Taixali by the Romans, except in the writings of 
the ancients, for although the Romans adopted from the natives 
the name of the river, there was no reason why the natives should 
give up the name by which the town placed on its banks had 
previously been known to them, in order to copy from their in- 
vaders the name which they chose to affix to it. It seems in a 
high degree probable that the ancient name of the city among the 
natives very nearly resembled the one which it bears at this day, 
though, perhaps, Camden goes too far when he charges Ptolemy 
with having put Diva and Devana for Dena and Denana. t 

Mr Kennedy observes, that in old records the name is variously 
spelt— Aberdaen, Aberdon, Abirden, Aberdene, and Abyrdene;—

and in Latin writings it generally occurs in the form of Abredonia; 
but Buchanan, while he uses the name Abredonia as apphcable 
both to Old and New Aberdeen, says of the latter " Hanc cite- 
riorem invenio vetustis monumentis Abredeam appellatam."- 

The noun " Abar," is stated by Macleod and Dewar in their 
Gaelic Dictionary to denote " a marsh, a bog, a fen," and used 
as a verb « to join together," hence " a place where two or more 
streams meet." On a reference to the situation of the numerous 
places both in Scotland and Wales whose nan.es begm with this 
word, it will be seen that they are all with one or two questionable 
exceptions, viz. Abergeley in Flintshire, and Abernyte m Perth- 
shire, situated either, 1., at the influx of a stream into the sea; or 
2rf, on the confluence of two streams; or 2d, in the immediate 
neighbourhood of a stream ; a very few only presenting the anomaly 
of being on the sea coast, where there is no river or stream of any 
notable magnitude, such as Abermenai in Caernarvonshire, Aber- 
dour in Fife, and Aberdour in Aberdeenshire. 

If, then, it can be admitted that the Celtic name of the river was 
Dee or as Mr Thorn asserts,t " Deabhadh pronounced Devay, or 
soml similar word, the origin of the name of the city seems easi y 
deducible from « Abar" or « Eabar," a marsh or fen, and it i 
worth notice that the common people pronounce the name as it it 
were spelt Ebardeen, compounded with the name of the river, so 
that it signifies " the marsh of the Dee."  

Topography, c- The parish of St Nicholas, in which Aberdeen 
is situaM, lies on the north side of the river Dee, adjacent to its em- 
bouchure, and along the contiguous sea coast. Its shape isirregular y 
quadrangular. It is bounded on the -t\-e, by the river ab g

of a mile, till it meets the south boundary at the place where that 
burn falls into the basin of the harbour. The superficial contents 
of the parish may be eslimated at about 1100 imperial acres, of 
which rather more than one-half including the whole of the west, 
the greater part of the south, and nearly one-half of the north 
sides, is occupied by the city of Aberdeen, and the village of Fut- 
tie, which lies along the river towards the east end of the south 
boundary. By far the greater part of the remainder along the east 
side is occupied by the links, and a range of low sand hills by which 
they are separated from the sea coast. Along the north side, from 
the Broad Hill to the point where the buildings of Aberdeen be- 
gin, the ground is laid out in market gardens, nurseries, and bleach- 



greens. 



The origin of the name of this parish is enveloped in obscurity. 
The great church of Aberdeen was, in former times, dedicated to 
St Nicholas, though whether it was to. Nicholas, who was Bishop of 
Myra in Lycia in the fourth century, and who is the patron saint of 
the Russian empire, or to some one else of the same name, that it 
was dedicated, is a problem that probably cannot now be solved. The 
name derived from this dedication, however, has by long use ex- 
tended to the whole parish ; but in ordinary language it has of late 
years been less generally used, — the name of the city which occu- 
pies so large a portion of the parish being employed instead. 

With the exception of that part of the Broad Hill which is com- 
prehended within the hmits of the parish, the surface of the whole 
of the east and north parts is nearly level, and but very slightly 
elevated above the sea ; but in the south and west parts, the ground 
is more broken, rising into several eminences of small height, one 
of which, the Heading Hill, may be said to lie beyond the limits of 
the town on the east side, although a few houses are built on it, 
and on the adjacent grounds to the north, while the others, known 
by the names of the Castle Hill, St Catherine's Hill, the Port Hill, 
and the School Hill or Woolman Hill, are occupied by the streets 
and buildings of Aberdeen. 

On the south side the boundary of the parish is also the boun- 
dary of the district of Mar and of the county of Aberdeen ; and the 
adjacent parish in the county of Kincardine is Nigg, in which the

small fishing village of Torrie lies directly opposite to Futtie on the 
south side of the Dee. On the north and west sides, the parish of 
St Nicholas is completely inclosed by the parish of Old Machar, 
which contains the town of Old Aberdeen, lying about a mile north- 
ward from Aberdeen, the manufacturing village of Woodside, at 
the distance of about two miles to the north-west, and the village 
of Ruthrieston, about two miles distant towards the south-west. 
In this parish are also situated the suburbs of Broadford on the 
north side; Gilcomston, along the north end of the west side; the 
Windmill-brae and College Street near the south end of the same 
side; Holburn about a mile off towards the south-west; and Dee 
villaae about half a-mile off on the bank of the river. Besides these, 
the new streets which have of late years been added to Aberdeen, 
and in which many of the best houses are situated, are within the 
limits of the parish of Old Machar, lying between Gilcomston and 
the river, and extending westward nearly three-quarters of a mile. 

Soil — The soil of the parish is on the east side principally 
sandy,'derived from its vicinity to the sea, the beach being here com- 
posed of fine sand, with occasional beds of small stones. The upper 
grounds in the other parts consist generally of gravel, and the lower 
grounds shew in several places extensive beds of peat moss lying 
under and mixed with the remains of former buildings or artificial 
soil There is reason to conclude that the whole of the parish 
rests on a bed of rock of the nature of granite, and this rock may 
be seen in some parts of the Broad Hill cropping out to the surface. 
It has been found, however, in those parts of the town and neigh- 
bourhood, where boring for water has been practised that the rock 
lies at a depth of nearly thirty feet under the moss and gravel which 

form the subsoil. . . . „f Mr 

According to the most recent determination, that ot Mr 
George Innes, which has been approved by the engineers employ- 
ed in the Government survey, the latitude of the observatory on 
the top of Marischal College, which stands not very from the 
centre of the parish, is 57° 8' 57.8" north, and its longitude is 2 
W 41 56" west from Greenwich. .

The fluctuations of the barometer are not in general either very 
great or very sudden. It scarcely ever rises above 30.5 inches, or 
sinks below 28. The effect of the east wind in raising it, or in 
preventing its fall on the approach of rain, is very frequently to be 
observed. In the following table Mr Innes has collected the 
monthly mean for the last seven years— the barometer being 
placed at the height of 45 feet above half flood, and observed night 
and morning.

No series of observations with the hygrometer has been record- 
, nor indeed are such very satisfactory when they are made. 
The principles of the various instruments of this kind that are in 
use are liable to several fallacies which it is not easy to remove, 
and nearly impossible to make due allowance for. Some of them

is obvious that there is therefore a great and a variable quantity ol 
moisture contained in the air to which such instruments are exposed, 
of which they give no indication. Others are formed on the prin- 
ciple of estimating the quantity of water which the air under given 
circumstances, is capable of dissolving, m addition to the unas-

in producing those indications must be admitted ; but such 
changes, at the same time, produce a change in the relations of 
•. the air to moisture, which often the most sensible hygrometer will 
fail to indicate, but which the lapse of a few hours proves to be 
not the less real on that account. 

The sensible proof that the air is saturated with moisture seems 
to be obtained by the falhng of rain ; but even here it is not suf- 
ficient to find that rain has fallen in order to justify the conclu- 
sion, that the air was overloaded with moisture, or to find that 
no rain has fallen, in order to warrant the inference that the quanti- 
ty of moisture contained in the air was less than it was capable of 
dissolving. Sudden changes in this respect often take place, which 
are not by any means always proportioned to the changes of tem- 
perature, and sometimes are even altogether unconnected with 
them, and which it is extremely difficult to take any accurate ac- 
count of. It is true that rain often falls from a considerable height 
in the atmosphere, and we are therefore unabletojudg-e accurate- 
ly of the circumstances of that stratum of air from which it is pre- 
cipitated ; but this is not always the case, and rain is sometimes 
produced as it were before our eyes, while the previous indication 
of the thermometer and of the hygrometer gave little information 
regarding it. The rain-guage may thus occasionally become a use- 
ful addition to both of these ; though it is obviously not capable of al- 
ways indicating the actual quantity of moisture separated from the 
air in any given situation ; 1st, because it will catch a consi- 
derable portion, and indeed the greater part of what it does catch, 
is probably to be considered as derived from this source, of what 
is separated from strata of air at a considerable but very variable 
heigTit above the place of observation; 2d, because the circum- 
stances of the various strata of air through which the rain falls 
before reaching the guage, are liable to such endless variety, that 
the quantity of water collected by the guage may be either very 
considerably greater, or very much less than the actual quantity 
precipitated in the form of rain ; and Sd, because when rain is 
produced from that stratum of the air in which the rain-guage is 
placed, much of the amount of its indications will depend on the 
situation which the guage occupies, as that which in the upper 
parts of the stratum is but a drizzle or small rain, may sometimes 
be found to be a very heavy shower, if observed in a situation 
only a small number of feet lower. An observation of this 
kind was made on one occasion by the late Dr Copland, Professor 
oi Natural Philosophy in Marischal College, wlio found the rain

small anil by no means thick on the top of the Observatory, while 
in the court below it was heavy and in large drops. The follow- 
ing table, therefore, showing the rain collected by the ram-guage 
on the top of the observatory, at the height of 74 feet from the 
surface of the ground, cannot be looked on as perfectly satisfac- 
tory. Yet perhaps the objections to which it is liable, are though 
of a different kind not on the whole stronger than those that 
micrht be urged against the indications of any similar mstrument 
however placed. Mr Innes, with the view of removing these ob- 
iections in as far as they are capable of being removed, has taken 
measures for observing the fall of rain in future at two additional 
stations in the vicinity of Aberdeen ; the one in a garden about halt 
a mile westward from the boundary of the parish, where the guage 
is placed seven feet above the surface of the gr.ound, and the other 
at the light-house on the Girdleness, about a mile south-east from 
the extremity of the parish, where it is placed at the height of three 
feet above the ground.

Generally speaking, the wind does not blow with any great 
violence, and it cannot be said that there is any particular quarter 
from which a violent wind may be expected to come, rather than 
any other ; though, perhaps, on the whole, the north wind may be 
said here to be oftener a violent wind than that which blows in 
other directions. 

The average rise of the tide at the mouth of the Dee is 13 feet 
at spring tides, and 8 feet at neap tides, and the former takes place 
when the moon is about thirty-six hours past the full and change, 
— the latter about thirty-six hours after the first and last quarters. 

The magnetic variation is at present 26° 43' westward. It was 
a few years ago somewhat greater, having been stated by Mr In- 
nes at 26° 45' during the years 1830-31-32-33, and 34. 

The aurora borealis is sometimes seen here in great splendour, 
exhibiting a corona of every conceivable' colour, and of very great 
brilliancy from its rapid and constant changes. The hissing or 
crackling noise which so many have heard accompanying this me- 
teor, while many others have denied that any such sound has ever 
been heard, apparently for no better reason than because they 
have not themselves heard it, and cannot account for it, has been 
occasionally observed by several persons in Aberdeen and the 
neighbourhood, among whom the late Mr John Ramage may be 
mentioned, as well as the writer of this Account, who also had an 
opportunity once of confirming the observations made by Captain 
Back during his sojourn in the Polar regions, that the cause of 
this meteor, whatever it may be, is not always at so great a distance 
from the surface of the earth as is commonly supposed, for he saw 
the beam of light distinctly pass between his eye and a small cloud, 
while it passed behind another small cloud, which evidently hung 
lower in the atmosphere. The splendid phenomenon of a huni- 
nous arch, about 1° 30' broad, stretching across the heavens nearly 
m the direction of the magnetic equator, and slowly moving to- 
wards the south till it becomes more undefined, and at last breaks 
up when it has passed a little beyond the zenith, has been of late 
years several times observed here. Nothing can be founded on 
the frequency or unfrequency of a phenomenon so irregular and so 
httle understood as the aurora borealis ; but it may be mentioned 
by the way, that after having been for several years very seldom 
observed, it has of late become much more frequent, and during

last winter scarcely a night passed in which it was not seen in a 
greater or less degree. 

Thunder storms are by no means very common in this parish, 
and when they do occur they are scarcely ever very violent, and 
it is not above once in two or three years that any injury is done 
by lightning to either buildings or hves in Aberdeen or the vicinity. 

Springs, Wells, 4c.— There are few springs of any consequence 
in the parish, and although a supply of water can be got in most 
places by digging from ten to thirty feet, it is generally rather 
hard, and therefore comparatively of little value. Close by the 
boundary of the parish, on the west side, are two springs closely 
contiguous, which have been long known under the name of the 
Well of Spa. Both of these springs, but especially the least co- 
pious one, are impregnated with carbonate of iron, and they have 
been noted as medicinal on account of this quality. In A615, an 
account of the properties and powers of these springs was published 
bv Dr William Barclay, under the title of " CaUirrhoe, comrnonly 
called the Well of Spa, or the Nymph of Aberdene." A building 
which at that time protected the spring having fallen into decay, 
was repaired by the celebrated painter, George Jamieson, but was 
not long after demolished by a flood of the Den-burn, which runs 
close beside. In 1670, another building was erected over the 
sprino-, which still remains, consisting of a stone enclosure with 
sieps°or benches, and an entablature bearing these inscriptions :- 

« As heaven gives me, so give I thee. 
« Hoc fonte derivata salus in Patriam populumque fluat. 

» Spada Rediviva, lovU. . 

These springs have disappeared and been recovered several 
IeTwitLn 'the last t«o centuries but 'f 
beate virtues seem to have been always retained. W.thm these 
few years, however, in digging on the adjacent f"' ''; 

Hndations of the west wing of the New Infirmary, .t would seem 
asTf the course of the water had been disturbed, or some other 
change produced, the consequence of which is that now the larger 
t ng s areely appears to possess any clmlybeate .mpregnaUon, 
j L smaller one is much weaker than it formerly was. 
It ge"eX concluded among geologists, that where grange 
, r  ' th/bed of a district, the attempt to obtain water bj

ao-o, made the experiment at their manufactory, in the lower part 
of the town, and with the result of obtaining an abundant supply 
of water. In sinking this well, they cut through about thirty feet 
of mossy soil and gravel before coming to the rock, into which they 
made a bore of eight inches diameter, which was successively con- 
tracted to six inches, and at the bottom to four inches. The depth 
to which this bore was carried through the rock was 150 feet, and 
in the course of the operation they found the matter cut through 
mostly granite, though of different degrees of hardness at different 
depths. The water thus obtained, which probably comes from seve- 
ral fissures in the rock, rose to within about eight feet of the surface, 
but on putting in a pump the supply was found to be copious and 
capable of increase. On first using the pump a good deal of air 
rose alongf with the water, but in about a month this ceased, and 
it was then found that, by increasing the power of the pump, a 
larger supply of water accompanied, however, by a renewal of the 
escape of air might be obtained. The supply thus acquired is 
now equal to nearly 180 gallons per minute, but the quality of the 
water is hardish, so that it cannot be used except for condensing. 

They have more recently sunk another well about 100 feet dis- 
tant from the first, and this they carried to the depth of 220 feet, 
the bore throughout being eight inches wide. Here they found 
the water rose only to within about fifteen feet of the surface, and 
on applying a pump the supply was by no means so great as from 
the first, not exceeding fifty gallons per minute, of the same qua- 
hty as the other, and apparently derived from the same fissures, — 
for the yielding of the first well is so much diminished by the 
working of the second, that both together scarcely give more water 
than the first did alone, before the second was made. 

Messrs Richards and Co., on hearing of the success which had 
attended the attempts of Messrs Hadden, began to bore, and after 
cutting through 18 feet of moss and black earth, 14 feet of gravel 
and small stones, 4 or 5 feet of reddish clay, and, below that, about 
6 feet of loose sand and clay, they reached the rock, through which 
a bore of 8 inches diameter was driven to the depth of 132 feet, 
making 175 feet in all from the surface. The rock was of varia- 
ble hardness, but mostly granitic. At the depth of 115 feet, a 
layer of sand was met with, accompanied by much water, and there 
IS reason to believe, that the principal supply of water which was 
obtained came from this bed of sand. Below this the rock was 
very hard. The boring was continued for 60 feet further, but 



14

witliout any change in the nature of the rock, or any notable ad- 
dition to the quantity of water. The spring rose to the surface of 
the earth, and flowed over in small quantity, but on putting in a 
pump, the supply was found to be equal to about 45 gallons per 
minute, and of excellent quality, being, though not absolutely soft, 
yet not by any means materially hard. 

The only other attempt of this kind which has been made is by 
Messrs Fisher and Son at the Devanha Brewery, about a mile 
south-west from the boundary of the parish, where a bore of six 
inches wide at the top, but diminished to three inches at bottom, 
was driven to the depth of 140 feet. Nearly the whole of this was 
through a red granite rock of variable hardness, and the supply of 
water, which was obtained after boring about 35 feet, not having 
been materially increased, the attempt was then given up. The 
water rose to within two feet of the surface, and the quantity ob- 
tained by applying a pump amounted to about 12 gallons per mi- 
nute ; but it was so strongly impregnated with carbonate of iron as 
to be altogether useless for the purposes of the brewery. 

Zoology.— It cannot be expected that the natural history of a 
parish which is nearly altogether occupied by a large city should 
present many objects of rarity or interest. In regard to quadru- 
peds, the only circumstance that occurs as being worthy of notice, 
is, that the black rat, which formerly used to abound over all Scot- 
land, has for many years been altogether expelled from this pa- 
rish by the large brown rat, which is commonly said to have been 
imported from Norway. The swallow and martin commonly make 
their appearance here about the end of April, and depart a little 
before the autumnal equinox. The beautiful bird, the Bohemian 
jay, is sometimes seen here, but seldom. The other birds found are 
those which occur in other similarly situated parts of the north of 
Scotland. The sea in the neighbourhood yields considerable va- 
riety of fish, of which those principally caught are the haddock, 
whiting, cod, skate, and flounders of various kinds, as plaice, &amp;c. 
Ling, halibut, soles, and mackerel are occasionally caught, and 
there is no reason to doubt that an abundant supply of some of the 
finer kinds of fish, as turbot, might be obtained, if the fishermen 
' were in the habit of using decked boats, in which they could ven- 
ture to go 15 or 20 miles out to sea. An attempt was made some 
years ago by some fishers from Hartlepool to introduce the tur- 
bot fishery here, but they did not meet with the encouragement 
which they had hoped for. Herrings are occasionally caught m

abundance along this coast, but it was not until about two years 
ago, that, by the exertions of the late Provost Blaikie, a vigorous 
attempt was made to establish a herring-fishery at Aberdeen. 
There are at present about thirty boats employed in this way, and 
the success which they have had has been highly encouraging, so 
that it may be hoped that this department of the fishery is likely 
to be prosecuted henceforth with advantage. The salmon-fishery 
is carried on to a very considerable extent both in the sea and in 
the river Dee, and the rents accruing to the magistrates of Aber- 
deen, and to various private individuals from this source, are to a 
considerable amount. A statement of the actual quantity of sal- 
mon caught in the Dee and on the beach adjacent cannot be given, 
because these fishings, being in the hands of persons possessing si- 
milar fishings in other situations, it has not been deemed of im- 
portance to distinguish the fish of each particular river or station. 

Occasionally considerable quantities of shrimps are caught in 
pools left by the tide on the sands ; and the fishermen who reside 
in Futtie use as bait great quantities of sand-eels, which they 
collect by turning over the sand after the tide has receded. 

In consequence of the sandy nature of the beach, it afibrds no 
resting place or shelter for shell- fish ; and the shells which are 
found on the beach are, therefore, brought by the sea from other 
situations, and generally the fish have decayed before the shells 
are washed ashore. Sometimes after a storm, a few Echini and 
Medusae are found on the beach, but this is by no means frequent. 
The same observation applies to several kinds of small Corallines, 
and to various kinds of marine plants, none of which are properly 
speaking the produce of this coast, nor ever found on it in suffi- 
cient quantity to be of any importance either as manure, or for 
the purpose of preparing kelp. 

Botany. — The botany of such a parish is equally devoid of in- 
terest or variety as its zoology. The plants and trees which thrive 
well are necessarily of the more hai-dy kinds, and there is none of 
which it can well be said, that either the climate or the soil are 
so peculiarly suited to them, as to render them specially the pro- 
duce of this parish. Forest trees of the various ordinary kinds, 
as fir, larch, spruce, ash, elm, beech, birch, plane, mountain-ash, 
service, &amp;c. &amp;c., are reared to a considerable extent in the nursery 
grounds in and adjacent to the parish. The oak seems scarcely 
to thrive now in this part of the country, although in executing 
the improvements which have lately been carried on in the har-

bour of Aberdeen, the trunks of a good many oaks of large size 
have been dug up, in such situations as to lead to the conclusion 
that thev had not been brought down by the river, but had grown 
where they were found. One of these, which, when entire and 
covered with its bark, must have exceeded 15 feet in circumference, 
is set upon the Inch or flat ground between the basm of the har- 
bour and the bed of the river Dee. , • • i 

No great variety of plants can be said to belong to this parish, 
but by the industry of the inhabitants, to which the establishment 
of a Horticultural Society about ten years ago, has not a little con- 
tributed, a great many of the natives of other districts, and not 
a few exotics, both esculent and ornamental, have been success- 
fully cultivated, and may be said to be almost or altogether natu- 

ralized here now.  a ur. 

The mineral productions of the parish are not less hm.ted than 
those of the other departments of natural history. The east parts 
ot the parish lie altogether on a bed of sea-sand; and the low

instances of longevity, protracted sometimes to nearly a century, 
are by no means of more unfrequent occurrence in Aberdeen, 
than in most of the other towns in Scotland. 

II. — Civil History. 
It would be useless to attempt to trace the origin of the town 
of Aberdeen, as, in the total absence of records, nothing but con- 
jecture could be offered. It seems likely, that, whether the pre- 
sent town can be identified with the ancient Devana or not, there 
would be at a very early period a village or fishing-station near 
the mouth of the Dee, and this may be supposed to have stood 
where the most ancient traces of inhabitation in Aberdeen have 
been found, viz. along the south and west sides of St Catherine's 
Hill, where the Ship-row and Putachyside now are. Hector Boece 
says that it was erected into a city by Gregory about the year 
893, but of this no record has been preserved. The earliest 
document extant relating to the town is a charter by William, 
granted at Perth, the date of which is with probability supposed 
to be 1179, and from this time the rise of Aberdeen as a place of 
note may be dated. 

It had its share in the troubles and misfortunes of the succeed- 
ing reigns, and in 1272, according to Boece, it was reduced to 
ashes by the fires caused by a tempest which devastated a great 
part of Scotland, and which is mentioned also by Fordun, thouo-h 
he does not speak of the destruction of Aberdeen by it.f In 
1298, the town was garrisoned by the English ; but about ten 
years after, the citizens took possession of the castle, and mas- 
sacred the garrison ; having taken part with Bruce, who, in testi- 
mony of their patriotic exertions, granted them permission to bear 
as the arms of the town, " gules,-three towers triple towered, within 
a double tressure counterflowered argent, supported by two leo- 
pards proper, the motto in a scroll above ' bon accorb,' " that 
having been the watchword on the night when they rose against 
the English; and soon after he confirmed and extended the pri- 
vileges formerly possessed by the .citizens. In 1336, when Ed- 
ward III. had ravaged a great part ofthe north country, he de- 
solated Mar on his way south, and burned Aberdeen, killing a 
great number of the citizens, J in revenge, apparently, for the

death of Sir Thomas Roslyne, who had fallen in an attack on the 
town the year before.  The town yas within a few years rebuilt, 
and seems at this time to have received the designation of New 
Aberdeen ;-not in contradistinction to the K.rktown of beaten, 
which is now called Old Aberdeen, but simply because it was 
then a newly built town. It seems certain that Aberdeen was a 
town of some note long before Old Aberdeen was any thing more 
than a hamlet with a church. 

Subsequent to this time Aberdeen was repeatedly honoured by 
the visits or the prolonged residence of the Scottish King, and a 
mint was estabhshed in the town, from which coinages were issued 
both by David and Robert III. . 

The records of the town council now extant commence in the 
vear 1398, but nothing requiring notice in this summary occurs 
for a good many years. During the captivity of James I. and the 
minolty of James IL, the troubled state o the country obliged 
the inhabitants of each town to provide for their own security, and 
the citizens of Aberdeen were ordered to arm, the town was pro- 
ted Ih walls, the gates being carefully shut atJgK

Either could claim the victory.f Among those who fell on he

Aberdeen, who joined him at the head of a band of citizens. His 
body was brought to the town and entombed in the Church of St 
Nicholas, where its remains were discovered when the church be- 
came ruinous about the year 1740. In consequence of the death, 
in this manner, of Provost Davidson, it is said that an act of the 
town-council was soon after passed, prohibiting the chief magistrate 
from quitting the town in his official character ; but Mr Kennedy, 
though he mentions this, and though he refers constantly to the 
council records, does not quote any authority for the statement, 
and the writer of this has been unable to find any notice of such 
an act in the council register. 

In 1462, the magistrates entered into a bond of manrent for 
ten years with the Earl of Huntly ; he engaging to protect them 
in their freedom and property, and they promising to give him ad- 
vice when required, to keep his counsel, to receive him and his 
men into the town when he pleased, and to take part with him if 
he should be attacked within the burgh, saving always their alle- 
giance to the King.f In the course of the next year he called on 
them for assistance, but not strictly in terms of the bond, for he 
required them to meet him at the Cabrach, about forty miles from 
Aberdeen; but they excused themselves, first because they could 
not obtain horses, the whole country having been summoned at 
the same time to repress an incursion made by John Lord of the 
Isles; and secondly, because they had been ordered by the King 
to guard the town against the English, who were said to be on the 
coast. 

James III. having been killed in 1488, Lord Forbes and some 
other nobles came to Aberdeen in the course of the next year for 
the purpose of stirring up the people to assist in rescuing the younff 
Kmg from the party who had led him into rebellion; and to aid 
the.r object they paraded the town, exhibiting the bloody and torn 
shirt of the ate King on the point of a spear.j The appeal was 
notin vain, but the citizens seem to have limited the expression 
01 their loyalty to certain resolutions which they passed on the oc- 
casion. In 1497, a blockhouse was built at the entrance of the 
harbour as a protection against the English, and in 1514, besides 
the gunners stationed there, two men were placed at the bell-house 

L ttri-rn with orders to raise a fire as soon 

asthe English fleet appeared in sight, while other two on the

twenty-nine successive years, from 1547 to 1576. These abuses 
continued till 1591, when the matter having been challenged, and 
coming under the notice of King James, his Majesty issued one of 
the most singular rescripts, perhaps, that ever passed the privy seal, 
in which he ascribes the flourishing state of Aberdeen to the council 
continuing in office "unalteritorchangeit be the space of forty or fifty 
yeiris;" — says the town would become a monopoly instead of an open 
burgh, if they were changed annually according to act of Parlia- 
ment ; — and therefore directs the council then' in office to continue 
during life, re-electing themselses annually ; " renunceand and 
dischargeand all actioun and persute competent to us or our suc- 
cessors twitching the contraventioun of our said act of Parliament." 
This, however, did not give satisfaction, as indeed it could not be 
expected to do ; and next year the matter was referred to certain 
umpires, who pronounced a decree-arbitral naming the magistrates 
and council for that year, and " enjoining the acts of Parliament 
concerning the election of magistrates, council, and office-men 
within boroughs, to be precisely observed in all time coming." 

In 1594, three Popish priests having been apprehended by the 
magistrates, as abettors of the Popish Lords Huntly, Errol, and 
Angus, who were then in a state of rebellion, these barons forci- 
bly rescued the prisoners, and denounced fire and sword against 
the town ; a threat which would probably have been executed, had 
they not been soon after subdued, or rather starved into subjection. 

James VI. paid several visits to Aberdeen, viz. in 1582, 1589, 
1592, 1594, and 1600, and, generally speaking, these royal visits were 
expensive affairs to the citizens, both in entertainments, and in pre- 
sents of money given to his Majesty, according to the custom of the 
time. About this time, the crime of witchcraft was supposed to be 
prevalent in Aberdeen as well as in other parts of the kingdom, and 
many poor old women were sacrificed to appease the terrors which 
the behef in it was calculated to excite. Few of the individuals 
who were suspected were allowed to escape from the hands of their 
persecutors ; several died in prison in consequence of the tortures 
inflicted on them, and, during the years 1590-97, no fewer than 
22 were burnt at the Castlehill. 

In 1639, the town having, at the instigation of the Marquis of 
Huntly, taken part with the King, Montrose and General Leslie 
came north, and after harassing the citizens for a time, and re- 
ducmg Huntly to the necessity of dispersing his troops, returned 



22 ABERDEENSHIRE. 

southward. Soon after the Viscount of Aboyne resolved to pub- 
lish at Stonehaven a proclamation, issued by the King, against the 
Covenanters, but he was repulsed, and pursued by the Earl 
Marischal, who, coming to the bridge of Dee, found it fortified, 
but defended by a small number of men only. These he over- 
powered, and, coming to Aberdeen, entered it without resistance. 

In 1645, the town having mostly acceded to the covenant, Mon- 
trose, who had embraced the royal cause, having crossed the Dee 
about ten miles up, marched down to within two miles of Aber- 
deen, and sent a drummer with a summons to surrender. Ihis 
was refused, and the messenger dismissed; but as he as return- 
ing, he was killed either accidentally or by design, on which Mon- 
trose advanced, and being met by Burleigh's troops and the citi- 
zens at the Crabestone, about half a mile from the town, a bloody 
conflict ensued, in which Montrose overcame, and, pursumg his 
victory, he took possession of the town, which he gave up to pil- 
lage, putting many of the inhabitants to the sword. 

The reigns of Charles II. and James were noted for the cruel per- 
secution of the Presbyterians, and for great distress among the 
people generally, from which Aberdeen was not exempt. Among 
the arbitrary acts of the latter, may be noticed his having on seve- 
ral occasions controlled the election of magistrates, which was not 
restored to its former freedom till 1689. 

Some time previous to this probably at the tirne 'n the dis- 
turbed state of the country rendered it unsafe to dwel without the 
walls a double row of houses was erected, apparently at first ot 
wood in the middle of the Broadgate, by which that street was 
reduced in breadth from about thirty-five paces to its present 
breadth of about fifteen or eighteen paces, and the west side ot it 
known by the name of the Guestrow, or as it is called in some old 
writings, the « vicus lemurum,"t thus became a separate street, 
Ind, about the beginning of the eighteenth centui, the magi 
trates, anxious to deprive marauders of the shelter afforded th 
by the forest of the Stocket, gave permission to such the at 
ins as chose to take wood from it for that purpose add b I 
conies to the front of their houses, V'''' 
to the street, viz. to the extent occupied by the oute stai s and 
thus the streets were considerably narrowed, and the town en 
trid less healthy. One or two of the houses thus altered still re-

main, having- a wooden front, behind which, at the distance of 
about ten feet, is the original stone wall of the house. 

In 1715, the Chevalier de St George was proclaimed at Aber- 
deen by the Earl Marischal, and soon after the Earl of Mar sent 
to demand a contribution of L. 2000 from the town, for the sup- 
port of the Pretender's army, but of this only about one-half was 
paid. In December of the same year, the Pretender having 
landed at Peterhead, passed through Aberdeen on his way to 
Fetteresso, where he was met by several of the nobles attached to 
his cause. Although the magistrates at this time were on his side, 
the town's people generally seem to have been afraid to commit 
themselves, and he received no effectual aid from Aberdeen. 

About 1740, some individuals in Aberdeen engaged in the' nefa- 
rious trade of kidnapping such young men as they could entice or 
compel, to go to the plantations in Virginia, and though many were 
thus decoyed or forced away from thieir friends, it continued for a 
good many years little regarded, and a house in the Green is spoken 
of as having been used for confining those who were refractory 
until they could be shipped off. Several of the principal citizens 
appear to have been concerned in this villany, and it was not until 
one of their victims, Peter Williamson, unexpectedly re-appeared 
in Aberdeen in 1758, for the measures taken to prevent their re- 
turn, or communicating with their friends, were in general success- 
ful, that any check was given to it. He had written a pamphlet, 
giving an account of the manner in which he had been kidnapped, 
and of the hardships he had sustained, and this he sold in Aber- 
deen on his return. For this libel he was summoned before the 
bailies, and was fined 10s., ordered to beg pardon of the magis- 
trates, and thereafter to be banished from the town, and the ob- 
noxious parts of his book were torn out and burnt at the cross by 
the hangman. Williamson afterwards went to Edinburgh, where, 
meeting with some benevolent persons to espouse his cause, he 
raised an action against the magistrates, which was terminated by 
these worthies being sentenced to pay him L. 100, with all the ex- 
penses of the suit. 

In 1745, Prince Charles having landed in the West Highlands, 
Sir John Cope marched with the royal army to Inverness to oppose 
him, but he having gone southward, Sir John returned and cam§ 
to Aberdeen in September, from whence he took shipping ; and in 
November Lord Lewis Gordon, the Prince's Lord Lieutenant for 
Aberdeen and Banff, came to Aberdeen, and took possession of the

town. Soon after, the Laird of Macleod was sent by tbe Earl of 
Loudon with about 200 men to drive the rebels from the town, but 
he was defeated in a skirmish near Inverury, and the town con- 
tinued to be occupied by the rebels until February 1746, when it 
was evacuated on the approach of the royal army under the Duke 
of Cumberland. His Royal Highness reached Aberdeen on the 
27th February, and remained in the town till the 8th Aprd. A 
part of the royal army returned to Aberdeen after the battle of 
Culloden; and the citizens not being so alert in illuminating their 
houses as some of the officers thought they should have been, they 
ordered the soldiers to break the windows, which was accordmgly 
done ; but the magistrates resented this aggression, and imprison- 
ed one or two of the officers. Ultimately the matter was accom- 
modated by the officers paying about L. 60 for the damage done. 

In 1767, the harvest being unfavourable, and the price of meal 
consequently high, the populace broke open and robbed one of the 
meal cellars in town, and threatened to hang its owner, under the 
impression that he had wilfully raised the price beyond what was ne- 
cessary. In order to quell this riot, the magistrates were obliged . 
to call in the aid of the military, and it was not till one of the 
rioters was killed and several wounded, that the mob was dispersed. 

In 1782, the alarming deficiency of the crop led the citizens to 
adopt precautions to avert the threatened famine, and accordingly 
a subscription was opened, and a committee appointed to purchase 
corn to be distributed to the inhabitants. By their accounts it ap- 
pears that,, up to the end of July 1783, they had imported 2205 
sacks of various kinds of meal, 619 quarters of barley, and 9082 

bolls of grain. ... 

Attempts were made in 1786 to redress certam abuses connect- 
ed with the administration of the funds of the Scottish burghs, and 
in these attempts several of the citizens of Aberdeen took a princi- 
pal «hare ; but the bill which was introduced into Parliament tor 
thispurpose was thrown out in 1789. These attempts were re- 
newed in 1792, and a select committee of the House of Commons 
was appointed to report on the matter. This report was present- 
ed in June 1793 ; but the odium which was cast upon reform by t le 
democratic principles of the " Corresponding Society and the 
" Scottish Convention," induced the prudent abettors of burgh re- 
form to discontinue their exertions. 

The harvest of 1799 was extremely unfavourable, and the utmost

exertions of the magistrates were required in order to prevent fa- 
mine. But though the prices were very high, and much distress 
was suffered in consequence, no serious disturbance took place. 

In 1802, the celebration of the anniversary of the King's birth- 
day terminated in a melancholy and fatal manner," in consequence 
of some of the officers of the Ross and Cromarty Rangers, at that 
time quartered in the barracks, having become intoxicated while 
drinking the King's health in the town-house. On their appearing 
ii; this state in the street, they were pelted by some idle boys, on 
which they immediately ordered out the regiment, and fired on the 
crowd assembled in the Castle Street, four of whom were killed and 
a good many wounded. It was found necessary, in order to avert 
further evil, to remove the regiment from the town next morning. 
The officers and some of the soldiers who' were most immediately 
implicated were apprehended, and soon after ordered to be sent to 
Edinburgh for trial, but about two months after, the Lord Advocate 
declined to prosecute any of them. The citizens, much dissatisfied 
at this, raised a subscription for the purpose of prosecuting them at 
the instance of those whose relatives had been killed, and three 
officers and two sergeants were brought to trial, but after a trial of 
two days, two of the officers were found not guilty, and the vetdict 
was not proven as regarded the two sergeants ; the other officer did 
not stand his trial, and was outlawed. 

One of the most melancholy shipwrecks that have ever occurred 
on this coast took place on the 1st April 1813. The Oscar whale 
ship left the port that morning along with four others, the weather 
being fine ; but appearances of a gale coming on, the Oscar and 
another weighed anchor, in order to stand out to sea. The Oscar 
was detained by one of her boats having been sent for some of the 
crew who had not come on board, and the gale coming on from the 
north-east, she was driven ashore about 11a. m., in the Greyhope, 
immediately behind the breakwater at the south side of the har- 
bour, where she quickly went to pieces, and out of a crew of forty- 
four, only the first mate and one seaman were saved. The same 
place proved fatal in 1815 to the Caledonia and the Thames, which 
were both wrecked in one day, and the crews of both perished. 

In 1817, it was found that the expenses into which the magis- 
trates had been led in the execution of various improvements in the 
town, the harbour, and the roads leading to the city, had so drained 
the treasury, that it became necessary to declare the town insol- 
vent. The amount of debt for which the security of the town was

pledged was L. 225,710, to meet the interest on which an income 
appeared of L. 10,042, while the value of the property belonging 
to the town was L. 139,440, exclusive of the value of feus in the 
new streets, estimated at L. 106,851 ; so that time only appeared 
to be required to enable the treasury to overcome its difficulties. A 
committee of trustees was appointed, and, by careful management, 
his object was attained in a few years ; and the last yearly accounts 
just published show a revenue of L. 20,452, with an expenditure 
of L. 17,084. About the same time attempts were made to open 
the set of the burgh, and the subsequent election of magistrates 
having been informal in some respects was set aside, and certain 
individuals were named by the Court of Session to act until the 
next day of election. Since that time the Burgh Reform Act has 
been passed, and the election of the council is now placed pretty 
much on the same footing as it originally was,— the magistrates be- 
ing chosen by the council thus elected out of their own number. 

Eminent Men.— li would not be easy, and perhaps it is not ne- 
cessary, to draw the line very nicely between those men of talents 
and celebrity who have lived in Aberdeen, and those who have 
been principally connected with Old Aberdeen. The notice here 
given can only embrace a few of the principal, and must necessarily 

be very brief. . . , , i 

John Barbour was born in 1330, and is said to have been the 
son of a citizen who lived in the Castlegate. He is known by his 
office of Archdeacon of Aberdeen, and as the author of the me- 
trical history of Robert Bruce, which, as Mr Kennedy .a..e 
remarks, " has not yet lost its reputation," adding, « the style 
of his composition is regarded by the learned of both kingdoms as 
an ornament to our language, and not inferior to that of his con- 

temporary Chaucer." i 
David Anderson of Finzeaudi, commonly known b, the appel- 
lative of " Davio do a'-thing," was noted for his mechamca gemus, 
Ind in the vear 1618 promoted the improvement of the harbour 
removing a large rick which lay in the middle of the channel

Church, two pieces of tapestry worked by Mr Jamleson's daughter, 
Mary, representing Jephthah's Vow, and Susannah and the Elders. 

James Gregory, the inventor of the reflecting telescope, was 
born in the neighbourhood of Aberdeen in 1638, and educated at 
Marischal College. He was afterwards Professor of Mathematics, 
.first at St Andrews and then at Edinburgh. 

Edward Raban is worthy of note, as having been the first printer 
estabhshed at Aberdeen, where he settled in 1621. 

Mr Alexander JafFray, the son of a citizen of Aberdeen, oc- 
cupied the civic chair in the years 1641 and 1649,  and was 
highly beneficial to the community, by the judgment and mo- 
deration which he exhibited in the direction of the affairs of the 
town in very difficult times, as well as by the zeal which he dis- 
played for the promotion and maintenance of the true religion, 
though in his latter days he shewed a considerable want of steadi- 
ness, and ultimately became an adherent of the Society of Friends. 

James Gibbs was born in Aberdeen in 1688, and studied ar- 
chitecture in Italy, after which he settled in London, where he 
acquired both reputation and fortune. It is to his taste and talent 
that the design of the Church of St Martin in the Fields is said 
to be due ; and he gave the plan also for the West Church in Aber- 
deen. 

John Gregory was born in Aberdeen in 1724, and, having 
studied medicine, became Professor, first in King's College and 
afterwards in Edinburgh, where, on his death, he was succeeded 
by his son, the late eminent Dr James Gregory, who also was born 
in Aberdeen. 

John Ramage, who was a currier and leather-merchant in Aber- 
deen, deserves notice here on account of his devotion to scien- 
tific pursuits, and his great practical acquaintance with the con- 
struction of reflecting telescopes ; one of which, made by him, is 
placed in the Royal Observatory, and, though considerably infe- 
rior in size, is said to be nearly equal in power to Herschers 40 
feet reflector. 

Connected with Aberdeen, we must mention Dr Robert Hamil- 
ton, formerly Professor of Natural Philosophy, and afterwards of 
Matliematics, in Marischal College, the author of an Essay on the 
National Debt, which has often been referred to as one of the 
ablest and most perspicuous elucidations of the principles of the 

be IhttSf'"' 5" and 1638, is generally supposed to

Sinking Fund; and Dr Patrick Copland, who was Professor in 
Marischal College, at first of Mathematics and afterwards of Na- 
tural Philosophy, who enriched the collection of apparatus there 
with a crreat variety of models, made under his own.eye, and many 
of them with his own hand, so that at his death the apparatus- 
room of Marischal College contained a collection probably supe- 
rior both in extent and accuracy to any other collection in Scotland. 

It is not necessary to do more than mention the names of such 
men as Dr Thomas Blackwell, Dr George Campbell, Dr Thomas 
Reid Dr James Beattie, Dr Gilbert Gerrard, and Dr William 
Laurence Brown, all of whom were either natives of Aberdeen or 
for a considerable portion of their lives resident m it. Neither 
would it be seemly in closing this list to say more than that Dr 
John Abercrombie is a native of Aberdeen, and that Sir James 
Macgrigor received the first elements of his professional education 
as the pupil of a medical man in Aberdeen. 

Ecclesiastical State.-Uii\e precise information can be given re- 
warding the early ecclesiastical state of Aberdeen, except that, for 
two or three centuries preceding the Reformation, there w-ere in 
the town, houses of Dominican, Franciscan, and Carmelite Friars, 
and a monastery dedicated to the Holy Trinity, as well as a parish 
church dedicated to St Nicholas ; and that there is no reason to 
doubt that in Aberdeen, as in other parts of Scotland, " the form 
of Popery which prevailed was of the most bigotted and illiberal 
kind, and its superstitions and absurdities had grown to an extra- 

vao'ant height."  _ ,i i 

Malcolm having gained a victory over the Danes at Mor tlach, 
in Banffshire, in 1010, founded a bishopric there which was trans- 
ferred to Aberdeen in .1139. The bishop fixed his residence at 
Seaton, on the right bank of the Don, about half a mile from its 
mouth and, in consequence of this, the cathedral church was 
erected there.f The church of St Nicholas, as being a depen- 
dencY of the bishopric, was served by a vicar who was generally 
the sixth prebendary of the cathedral, together with a cm.te 
chaplains, the number of whom was twenty-two in 1491, but in 
1519 they were restricted to sixteen. 

The influence of Protestant truth seems to have early begun to 
ma"self in Aberdeen; for, in 1521, Mr John Marshall,

master of the Grammar School, was summoned before the magis- 
trates for contempt of the Church of Rome. He answered bold- 
Iv that he did not consider himself amenable to the court of Rome. 
But two years afterwards, he expressed his coivtrition lch as 
Mr Kennedy observes, " probably saved him frona the dreadful 
punishment which generally awaited the enemies of that church. 

In 1525, the principles of the Reformation had made such pro- 
gress in Aberdeen, that the King sent orders to the -SherifF to 
search for and punish those who had in their possession heretical 
books, it being alleged that several strangers and others within the 
diocese of Aberdeen were busied in .propagating the errors ot 

Luther. , , 1 r 11 • 

Ultimately, however, the truth prevailed, and the following ex- 
tract from the council records, of date 4th October 1560, shews 
the zeal and cordiality with which the cause of the Reformation 
was at that time embraced by the magistrates : " The haill coun- 
sell present for the tyme oblist thaim faithfuUie to assist and coun- 
cil with the Provost and Baillies, obey and fortifie the same in ex. 
Pcutione of all actis and statutis devysit and mayd be the counsell 
for the comound weiU of this burgh and mantenans of Chryste's 
religioune, at thair uter power ; and peyne to be imputt alsweill 
upoiine the said counsell as upoune thesaidis Provest and Baillies for 
observans of the present statute, that is to say, under the paine of 
deprivatione of thair offices, gouns, and dignities, and tynsell of 
thair fredorae to be att thie counsells will." 

The parochial charge of the town was committed to Mr Adam 
Heriot, who had been an Augustinian friar, but who having re- 
nounced the errors of Popery, had joined himself to the Congre- 
gation, and the time of his admission to the office seems to be near- 
ly fixed by the following entry in the council records of the same 
date with the preceding : " The counsell ordains the thesaurer to 
pay Adam Heriot, minister of the towne, the soume of twa hun- 
dreth pounds, usuall money of Scotland, for his ministratione and 
preching for the space of ane zeir nixt and immedyately following 
the first day of November nixt to cum." 

In January 1561-2, the silver and brass work belonging to the 
church, which had in the meantime been entrusted to the care of 
a member of the council, was sold by public roup for the common 
good ; and the magistrates about the same time resolved to abolish 
the monasteries, and to raise forty men for the service of the Con- 
gregation. They seem, however, to have been partly induced to 



30 



ABERDEENSHIRE. 



this resolution by a visit which they had shortly before received from 
some of the Reformers of the south. 

In 1567, the Provost of Aberdeen, writing to excuse his non-at- 
tendance at the General Assembly called for the 26th of July, 
expresses the mind of the town as follows : " It shall please your 
wisdomes understand and most assuredly beheve us, professors of 
the Evangell of the Kirk within the burgh of Aberdeen, to be of 
ane minde, and be the grace of God to continue, to the mamte- 
nance of the furthsetting of the glory of God, teaching of the 
true Evangell, and sustentation of the ministers, with help unto 
the poore, and unto the tyme your wisdomes with the nobilitie find 
ane order universall for the ministrie, we shall, for our own part, 
God willing, sustaine our minister, so that of reason he shall have 
no cause to plaint, and to the poore after our power doe semblablie 
as uther burroughs shall take order." 

At the commencement of the Reformation in Aberdeen, a mis- 
sionary or assistant to the minister seems to have been employ- 
ed, as may be gathered from the following entry in the council re- 
cords of 11th October 1560: " The counsell ordanis David Mar, 
thesaurer, to deliver Johne Brabaner ane garmound of cleithing of 
Frensche or Flanders blak, that is to say, bonnet, goune, coitt, 
hoiss, and doublatt, for his labours, cair, and diligens taine in tymes 
' bygaine, in preching, teching, and administratione of the sacra- 
mentis, without ony recompens." 

Mr Heriot was greatly respected for his worth and usefulness, 
and on his death in 1574 he was succeeded by Mr John Craig, 
who had been for nine years the colleague of Knox in Edinburgh, 
and afterwards minister at Montrose. 

In 1579, Episcopacy was introduced into the Church of Scot- 
land, and David Cunningham was installed the first Protestant bi- 
shop of Aberdeen. In the struggles which aftersvards took place 
for the abolition of that form of church government, as well as m 
the opposition made by the country to the ecclesiastical proceed- 
ings, in general, of James and his descendants, the citizens of 
Aberdeen, influenced by their feelings of loyalty, and under the 
guidance of their teachers, seem generally to have been less zeal- 
ous than their countrymen in other quarters. Stevenson havmg 
irientioned, in his History of the Church and State of Scotland 
the prevalent feehng in favour of the Covenant, makes the follow- 
ing exceptions :-"ls, Papists; 2d, Courtiers who had no

will to displease the King ; and 3d, Clergy, of whona the chief were 
the Doctors of Aberdeen." He goes on to say that the town, be- 
ing much under the influence of the Marquis of Huntly and the 
Doctors, viz. Dr John Forbes, Dr Robert Barron, Dr William 
Leslie, Dr Alexander Scrogie, Dr. James Sibbald, and Dr Alex- 
ander Ross, refused to subscribe the Covenant, which, with a view 
to their concurrence, had been sent to them in April 1638, by the 
hands of a commission from the Tables, consisting of the Lairds 
of Dun, Morphy, Balmain, and Leyes, Mr Alexander Wedder- 
burn, Clerk of Dundee, and Mr Robert Barclay, Provost of Ir- 
vine. A short time before this, Aberdeen had been appointed 
as the place of residence or exile of Samuel Rutherfurd, when he 
was ejected from his parish of Anwoth, and Dr Barron undertook 
the task of conferring with him, and bringing him to alter his views 
on the question which then agitated the church and the nation. 
The result of these conferences is stated by Rutherfurd in one of 
his letters, in his usual homely but expressive manner, " Twa 
yokings laid him by." On the 20th of July 1638, another com- 
mission, consisting of the Earls of Montrose and Kinghorn, the 
Lord Cowper, the Master of Forbes, the Lairds of Leyes and 
Morphie, with Messrs Alexander Henderson, David Dickson, and 
Andrew Cant, ministers, came to Aberdeen, and though at first 
some difficulty occurred with the magistrates, and the covenanting 
ministers were refused access to the town's pulpits, yet about 500 
subscribed after public worship in Earl Marischal's Close, of whom 
several were persons of the best quality in the place.f But though 
considerable progress had been made among the citizens, the doc- 
tors continued adverse to the Covenant, and were both active and 
successful in their efforts to gain others to their opinions, and to 
repress the zeal of their covenanting fellow-citizens ; in conse- 
quence of which proofs of their " good afFectioune to his service," 
they received from Charles I. various communications expressive of 
his " hartie thanks," and assurances that " when anie thing that 
may concerne « your good shall occurr we shall not be unmyndful 
of the same.'" This promise the monarch performed not long after,

by granting a new Royal charter to the burgh, confirming in the 
most ample manner all their ancient rights, privileges, and immu- 
nities. In the latter part of this troubled reign, the citizens of 
Aberdeen seem to have become more generally favourable to the 
cause of the Covenanters, the C9nsequence of which was, that they 
had now to endure the etactions of its enemies, as they had for- 
merly suffered from the hostile attacks of its adherents. Yet it 
may be doubted whether many of them were not influenced rather 
by the success which attended the Covenanters, than by any well- 
grounded persuasion of the goodness of their cause. On the acces- 
sion of Charles II., and there-establishment of Episcopacy, "the 
Synod of Aberdeen distinguished itself by an humble address to 
his Majesty's High Commission and the High Court of Parliament, 
in favour of Episcopacy, dated at King's College, 18th April 1661, 
in which they strongly reprobate their own former conduct;" and 
this seems to have been the beginning of a course of time-serving 
compliance, by which they contrived in a great measure to escape 
from the exactions and persecutions to which the Presbyterians 
were exposed during that and the subsequent reign. At length 
the Revolution brought these persecutions to a close, and led to 
the establishment of Presbyterianism, as at present existing in the 
country ; but while the people of Aberdeen gave way to those who 
had power to enforce their commands, considerable numbers of 
them continued attached to the Episcopal forms, and the Pres- 
byterians of Aberdeen were by no means remarkable for their zeal 
in maintaining the doctrines of the Confession of Faith. The Ar- 
minianism which, during the last century, infested the church of 
Scotland to so lamentable a degree, may be said to have had one 
of its strongholds in Aberdeen ; and about the middle of the cen- 
tury, Mr John Bisset, minister of the West Church, who continu- 
ed faithfully to preach the doctrines of the church to which he 
belonged, was excluded from his own pulpit by the provost, who 
locked the church door against him. 

It was not until about the beginning of the present century 
that a better spirit began to manifest itself in the pulpits of Aber- 
deen. 1 1 f 
Since that time, a brighter day has dawned on the Church ot 
Scotland in general. The churches in Aberdeen have partaken 
of its light, and the doctrines of the Confession of Faith have now

some as staunch supporters in the town and its neighbourhood, as 
are to be found in any other part of the country. 

The old parish of St Nicholas had, from an early period, three 
churches, the East, the West, and Grayfriars, the two former of 
which had been, for a period of at least 150 years, collegiate charges, 
and the town, though constituting but one parish, was divided 
into districts under the special charge of each of the incumbents. 
As the population increased, additional church accommodation 
became requisite, and several chapels of ease were at various times 
erected, as is noted below more particularly. By a decree of the 
Court of Teinds in 1828, the parish of St Nicholas was divided 
into six parishes. By a subsequent Act of the General Assembly, 
the chapels of ease were each connected with a parochial district 
quoad sacra ; the effect of these two measures was to increase the 
number of parish churches to ten ; and within the last few weeks 
a congregation of Original Burgher Seceders has been received 
back into connection with the Church of Scotland, and is about 
to have a parochial charge quoad sacra allotted to its minister. 
By this division of the town, a very important object has been 
attained, inasmuch as parochial superintendence is not now so 
completely out of the power of the ministers as it formerly was, 
though still the population of most of the parishes is so great as 
to prevent that close and intimate connection between the minister 
and his people, which the parochial system, if properly followed 
out, should produce and maintain. And when it is considered 
that each minister, in addition to the parochial charge of an al- 
lotted district, must also have a congregational charge, in conse- 
quence of many of his hearers not being resident within that dis- 
trict, it will be at once admitted that there is both room and cause 
for a still further division. 

The places of worship in Aberdeen in connection with the Es- 
tablished Church are the following:—]. The West Church, 
which stands on the site of the old church of St Nicholas. This 
builduig having become ruinous and unsafe, was disused as a place 
of worship in 1732. The present church was founded in 1751, 
and opened for Divine service in 1755. It ceased to be a colle- 
giate charge on the death of the Rev. Dr Brown. 2. The East 
Church stands where the quire of St Nicholas formerly was. It was 
erected m 1834,— the quire, which had been till then used, hav- 
ing become so ruinous, that it was judged necessary to pull it

Reformation, a chapel in Futtie, dedicated to St Clement, but th.s 
having fallen into decay, there was no Protestant church erected 
in its place till 1631, when a contribution was made for the pur- 
pose of building one, and a catechist was settled there. The pre- 
sent church was erected on the site of the old one, but considera- 
bly enlarged in size in the year 1828. 6. The South Church

desired that the way might be opened for receiving back into the 
Estabhshment. 

The other places of worship in Aberdeen are as follows : — 3 cha- 
pels belonging to the Congregational Union ; 3 chapels connected 
with the United Associate Synod ; 1 chapel in connection with the 
Relief body ; 2 chapels belonging, the one to the Scotch and the 
other to the English Baptists ; 1 chapel belonging to the Wesleyan 
Methodists ; 1 English Episcopal chapel, with two clergymen ; 1 
Scotch Episcopal chapel, with a bishop and a curate ; 1 Roman 
Catholic chapel ; 1 chapel which is called the United Christian 
Church. 

In addition to all these, there are also in Aberdeen small num- 
bers of Friends, Glassites, Irvingites, and Unitarians, which have 
each their own place of worship. 

The following table gives a summary view of the ecclesiastical 
state of the inhabitants of Aberdeen, as ascertained by surveys

There is too much reason to fear, that, although the surveys on 
which this table is founded were made with every possible care, 
there are many included under the heads both of the Establish- 
ment and Dissenters who are little, if at all, in the habit of fre- 
quenting any place of worship. And it must be remembered, too, 
that the strongest attachtient to the forms of a professing church 
is unhappily too often found to be compatible with an utter disre- 
gard or even a deliberate rejection of the saving truths of the Gos- 
pel.

The extent of church accommodation provided in Aberdeen at 
the time of the survey was reported to the Commissioners to be as

1 are held responsible, if the seat rents, &amp;c. do not suffice for that 
purpose, the sum drawn from the common good to make up the 
deficiency is regarded as a debt incurred, or rather as so much 
lost, seeing there can be little prospect of repayment. The fal- 
lacy of this view will be obvious, if the following statement, which 
was made by the Rev. James Foote to the Royal Commissioners, 
be considered : " The expenditure on the churches was L. 2124, 
15s. lid. : the mortifications amounted to L. 285 ; the rental of 
the East Church for the year 1837, and the average collections in 
that church for five years, amounted to L. 950, 10s. Id.; and the 
rental and collections of the West Church amounted to L. 917 ; 
making in all L. 2152, 10s. Id. ; so that there was here a surplus 
of L.27, 14s. 2d. beyond the whole expenditure, and, whatever was 
produced from the other chfirches, there was a clear gain to the 
public from these two churches alone, which of themselves produced 
more than the whole expenditure on all the town's churches." 

In another respect, too, a mistake of no small moment has been 
fallen into, viz. in stating the expense incurred in the erection, or 
by contributing to the erection, of several of the parish churches, 
as a debt against them in the town's accounts. The common 
good being destined for the advancement of the welfare of the com- 
munity, ought to be held as much liable for the expense of erect- 
ing churches for the maintenance of that form of worship which is 
by law established in the country, as for the cost of other public 
buildings, whose purpose it is to benefit the community in a secular 
point of view, such as court-houses, jails, colleges, &amp;c. Each of 
these in its own department tends to advance the welfare of the 
community, and in doing so, they amply repay the sums laid out 
on their erection. The churches of the Establishment are assured- 
ly not less conducive to the good of the citizens than these build- 
ings, but, on the contrary, much more so, in as much as they are 
erected and maintained for the promotion of that righteousness 
which exalteth a nation ; it must therefore be an erroneous and 
improper view of the matter, to regard the expense of these erec- 
tions as a debt due to the community, while that of erecting the 
other buildings named is looked on as a useful and necessary out- 
lay of the public money .-f- 

" The debt due by the kirk charge, amounted at 15th October last, exclusive of 
the expense of building the East Church, to L. 18,580, 12s. 2d., which may also be 
considered as a debt against the treasury." Town's Accounts for 1838.

Although a statement of the population of the town, as divided 
into ten parishes, was presented to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, 
and is given under the head of the Ecclesiastical State, — yet that 
document not having been accompanied by the requisite classifi- 
cations, it becomes necessary to fall back on the result of the cen- 
sus of 1831, taken when Aberdeen was divided into six parishes 
only, and when there were in the city

Educational State. — In 1607, a school for instruction in writing, 
arithmetic, and book-keeping was instituted by the magistrates, 
the master of which had a small salary allowed to him in addition 
to the fees of the scholars, and this salary has continued ever since 



40 ABERDEENSHIRE. 

with little addition. In 1672, a school for English grammar was 
established on a similar footing, and both of these schools have al- 
ways maintained a high character. 

Besides these, a school pretty much on the parochial plan has 
been for a considerable time supported by the magistrates and 
kirk-session jointly at Futtie. The school-house there having be- ■ 
gun to decay, was rebuilt and enlarged a few years ago, and the 
plan of education, which is purely elementary, was a good deal ex- 
tended. 

The incorporated trades have a school for the ordinary branches 
of education, and there are free schools founded and endowed by 
various benevolent individuals, viz. Bishop Gerrard's, Mr James 
Thain's, and Mr George Davidson's. 

In 1815, a society was formed in Aberdeen for the erection and 
maintenance of schools on the system of Joseph Lancaster, and 
they supported for a good many years a school for boys, at which 
the average attendance was about 450. About eight or ten years 
ago they were enabled, by the bequest of L. 1000 from the late 
Mr Hogg of Shannaburn, to erect a school for a similar number 
of girls ; but other schools having been about the same time erect- 
ed in various parts of the town, the attendance of girls scarcely 
exceeded 200; and Mr Robertson, the highly talented teacher of 
the boys' school, having been induced to accept the office of teacher 
of Dr Bell's school, the attendance of boys in -the Education So- 
ciety's school fell off, in consequence of which the society has 
deemed it advisable to give up one of their schools, and to divide 
the other into two apartments, capable of receiving about 200 each. 

A school for girls, capable of receiving about 100, and which is 
generally well attended, is supported by the Seamen's Friend So- 
ciety. They formerly had a school for boys also, but within these 
few years it has been converted into a parochial school for Union 
Parish, the society retaining the right of recommending boys, the 
children of seamen, for instruction in it. 

Dr Bell of Madras left L. 10,000, 3 per cent, consols, to the 
Magistrates and Council of Aberdeen, two-thirds of which were to 
be appropriated for schools in Aberdeen, and the other third for a 
similar purpose in Old Aberdeen. Accordingly, two schools were 
erected in Aberdeen, the one for about 400 boys, and the other 
for about 300 girls. 

Dr Anderson of Jamaica also bequeathed certain funds to trus- 



ABERDEEN. 



41 



tees, for the support of a school in Aberdeen, as did also Mr Do- 
naldson of Orchardtown. 

There are besides these partly endowed schools, a considerable 
number of private schools of diiJerent kinds, and four or five board- 
ing-schools, where young ladies are received and instructed in the 
various branches of useful and ornamental education. 

About nine or ten years ago, the Rev. A. L. Gordon published 
an address to the inhabitants, on the necessity of establishing 
schools, especially for the "poorer classes, on the sessional sys- 
tem, in the various parishes into which Aberdeen had then recent- 
ly been divided, and on the funds applicable to their support. The 
subject was brought under the consideration of the Presbytery, who, 
" impressed with a sense of the importance of the suggestion, re- 
commended to the ministers of Aberdeen, to consider and devise 
such means as may seem best for accomplishing the object, and to 
report.'' A memorial was soon after presented by the Presbytery 
to the Magistrates and Council, engaging to erect the necessary 
buildings, if, in order that the fees might be made sufficiently low 
to meet the circumstances of the poor, the city authorities would 
grant a small salary to the parochial teachers out of the common 
good. A similar memorial was soon after presented to them by 
the synod, but both were unsuccessful.  Notwithstanding this, 
the church courts encouraged the ministers to persevere, and the 
consequence has been, that, by private subscriptions, aided by 
grants of assistance from Government, besides two parochial 
schools in the adjoining parishes of Woodside and Bon Accord, 
two schools have been erected in John Knox's Parish, two under 
one roof in Trinity Parish, one is now building in the North Pa- 
rish, and funds have been raised for the erection of one in the East 
Parish where, as well as in Grayfriars and Union Parishes, tempo- 
rary schools have been for some time in operation, and in the 
South Parish, and measures are in contemplation for obtaining pa- 
rochial schools in the remaining parishes of Aberdeen. That 
schools, connected as these are with the parish church, will be 
placed in circumstances most likely to promote their usefulness in 
the parishes, will be readily admitted by all who are not blinded 
to the advantages of maintaining an intimate connection between 
the religious instruction of the people, and the education of their

children. Besides the security thus obtained for the soundness of 
the instructions given in the schools, the sympathies of the people 
will be enlisted in their favour ; and the teachers will be sustained 
by knowing that the ministers and elders take a lively interest in 
their success. 

The following is an abstract of returns which were made in 
1833, to queries issued by the Magistrates and Council, with a 
view to ascertain the state of education in Aberdeen. In these re- 
turns, all sorts of schools were embraced. Various changes have, 
to be sure, taken place since that time, and allowance must be 
made for those pupils who attend, at the same time, two or more 
schools for different branches, as well as for those who, hving in 
Old Aberdeen, attend schools in town, and vice versa ; but taking 
it as a whole, it may be looked on as giving a pretty accurate view 
of the present state of education in Aberdeen : Schools, 37 ; 
teachers, 49; pupils, 3664; males, 2546; females, 1118. 

At the greater part of these schools, the fees vary from 2s. to 
5s. a quarter. Some, as already noticed, are free; and at others 
scholars are occasionally taught without fees. 

The following abstract exhibits a view of the branches taught : 
English, 2792 ; writing, 1887; arithmetic, 1567; Latin, 208; 
Greek, 60; mathematics, 74; geography, 281; navigation, 15; 
music, 333 ; elocution, 67 ; sewing, 429. There is no return of 
French and the other modern languages, because they are almost 
exclusively taught by private teachers. , , , 

Besides these, there are also week-day evening schools esta- 
blished in a good many of the parishes, for the benefit of those 
who cannot attend school during the day, and of these the ol ow- 
ing return was made in 1833: Schools, 9; teachers, 16 ; scholars, 
699 ; males, 331 ; females, 368. 

An association was formed about two years ago under the 
title of" The Association of Teachers of Sabbath Schools, under 
Superintendence of the Kirk-Sessions of St Nicholas and Old 
Machar," which promises to be very useful, and which a ew 
m nths'ago had in the parish of St Nicholas 19 -hools ..th 149 
teachers, and upwards of 1800 scholars ; besides which, the Abei- 
deen G atis Sabbath School Society, which has been m operation 
for about forty years, has in the parish and neighbourhood, 20 
schools, attended by about 1000 scholars

and practice of the duties of their office, has been for some time 
strongly and generally felt, and in 1835, the General Assembly's 
Education Committee, in their report, dwelt at considerable length 
on the benefit to be expected from such institutions. The As- 
sembly approved of the views taken by their Committee, and ac- 
quiesced in their recommendation of Aberdeen as a suitable place 
for the establishment of a normal school. In April 1836, a pub- 
lic meeting was held in Aberdeen, at which it was resolved to erect 
a school of this description in the town, and a committee was ap- 
pointed for the purpose of carrying this resolution into effect. Se- 
veral of the neighbouring counties, as well as the Presbytery of 
Aberdeen, nominated committees to co-operate with this one, and 
the Trustees of Dick's bequest have expressed their strong appro- 
bation of such an institution, and their desire to assist the other 
bodies in securing for the North of Scotland the benefits that 
might be expected to arise from it. The expectation, that the 
Committee of the House of Commons on Education in Scotland 
will take up the subject of normal schools, and the hope that 
Government may make some acceptable proposal for their esta-- 
blishment, with other causes of a less general nature, have hither- 
to retarded the operations of these committees ; but there is every 
reason to expect, that in no long time a normal school will be 
estabhshed in Aberdeen. 

Grammar ScJiooL~The history of this school can be traced 
back as far at least as 1418, when Andrew de Syves, Vicar of Ber- 
vie, who had been master of the school for some years, died. 
Little is known about it, however, at this early period. In 1479, 
the salary attached to the office was L. 5 Scots. About fifty 
years after, it was raised to 10 marks, and certain perquisites were 
also allowed to the master. Twenty years later, the salary was 
fixed at 50 marks, and 2s. quarterly assigned as the fee of each 
scholar. In 1670, the rector, or head master, had 600 marks, 
and there were under him three ushers, each of whom had 200 
marks and tlie fees arising from his own class, the rate of pavment 
being at this time 13s. 4d. quarterly. The number and status of 
the teachers continue the same at present; the fees are 10s. 6d. 
quarterly, and the salaries are L. 90 to the rector, and L. 45 to 
each of the ushers. 

The funds from which these salaries are provided, arise from 
benefactions bequeathed at various times for the purpose— the 
t"ost important of which was by Dr Patrick Dun, Principal of 



44 ABEllDEENSIllRE. 

Marischal College, who, in 1634, mortified the lands of Ferryhill, 
in the neighbourhood of Aberdeen, for the maintenance of four 
masters in the grammar school. These lands were feued in 1752, 
at L.164 Sterling, half of which, in terms of Dr Dun's deed, is allot- 
ted to the rector, and the other half equally divided among the 
other three masters. It is provided by Dr Dun's deed, that any 
scholar bringing a sufficient testimonial of poverty shall be taught 
Latin gratis; that all of the name of Dun, and the sons of tenants 
on the lands of Ferryhill, " and haill remanent lands to be con- 
quiest for the use foresaid," shall likewise be taught gratis ; and 
in case of a vacancy in the office of any of the masters, a person 
of the surname of Dun, or a tenant or tenant's son on the lands 
of Ferryhill, if found qualified, shall be appointed « without anie 
contestatione." 

The course of teaching followed in this school occupies five 
years ; and commencing with the elements of Latin, the pupils are 
led on through a series of classical reading and themes, and of 
late years, the elements of the Greek language have been taught 
to the more advanced pupils. 

The regular business of the school occupies the hours from 9 
to 12 and from 3 to 5 four times a-week, with three hours on 
Wednesday and two hours on Saturday, besides which arithmetic 
is taught at an extra hour. 

Until lately it was the practice for all the pupils to assemble 
every morning for prayer in the public school, but this has been 
discontinued, and instead each master opens his class with prayer 
in his own class-room. It is to be regretted that, with the excep- 
tion of this, and the prescribing in the two higher classes, ot what 
are called sacred lessons on Saturdays if they deserve the name 
of exceptions, neither master nor pupil has leisure to spare, troin 
the communication and reception of classical knowledge, to attend 
to the much more important concern of religious and moral cul- 
ture  In this respect, however, the Grammar School ot Aber- 
deen is probably not more to be complained of than most other 
public classical schools, especially those on old foundations. 

The number of pupils attending this school is generally, about 
200 ; and there is an examination annually held in presence of the

trates, are awarded to the most deserving ; and the appearance 
which is generally made at this examination is such as to warrant 
the assertion, that, in as far as regards the communication of a 
knowledge of Latin, the Grammar School of Aberdeen, under the 
rectorship of Dr Melvin, is inferior to none in Scotland. 

Gordon's and Simpson' s Hospital — Robert Gordon, a descendant 
of the family of Straloch, having acquired a competent fortune as 
a merchant in Dantzig, returned to his native place about the be- 
ginning of the last century. Subsequently to this, his habits gra- 
dually became extremely penurious, and he almost denied himself 
the necessaries of life. Previous to his death, which occurred in 
1732, he executed a deed, by which he conveyed all his property 
to the Provost, Bailies, Town Council, and the four Ministers of 
Aberdeen  in trust for the erection and maintenance of an hos - 
pital for the reception and education of boys, who are sons or grand- 
sons of decayed burgess of guild ; and, \st, relations of the founder 
of the surname of Gordon ; 2d, relations of the founder of the sur- 
name of Menzies ; Qd, relations of the founder of any other sur- 
name ; 4:th, not related to him, but of the surname of Gordon ; 
bth, not related to him, but of the surname of Menzies ; Qih, not 
related to him, and of any other surname; 1th, sons and grand- 
sons of decayed tradesmen members of any of the incorporated 
trades ; Qih, sons and grandsons of dyers and barbers ; and, 9/, 
sons and grandsons of inhabitants of Aberdeen generally. 

Mr Gordon had, during his lifetime, purchased the ground 
formerly belonging to the Dominican Monastery in the School- 
hill, and on this site his trustees erected, at an expense of L. 3300, 
a handsome edifice, according to the design furnished by Mr James 
Gibbs, architect, which was finished in 1739. The expense of the 
building had, however, materially encroached on the funds in their 
hands, the amount of which was originally L.l 0,300, and, owing 
to this and the disturbed state of the country, in 1745 and 1746, 
the house remained unoccupied except that it was used as bar- 
racks by the Royalist troops in 1746, till 1750. By that time, 
the funds had accumulated to L. 14,000, and the hospital was 
opened. Thirty boys were then admitted, and the number has

since been gradually increased, until in 1838 there were 130 on 
the foundation. 

In 1816, Alexander Simpson, Esq. of CoUieliill, devised to the 
Principal and Professors of Marischal College and the four Minis- 
ters of Aberdeen in trust, the lands of Barrack, in the parish of 
New Deer, and Crickie, in Old Deer, subject to the liferent of 
certain of his own relatives, after whose death it became applicable 
to the purpose of educating boys in Gordon's Hospital, the sons and 
grandsons of decayed burgesses. The buildings of the hospital 
being, however, insufficient to accommodate more than eighty boys, 
the number then in the house ; and a considerable surplus of re- 
venue having accrued, the Governors of Gordon's Hospital, in an- 
ticipation of the bequest of Mr Simpson, added two wings to the 
hospital, connected with the centre building by a neat colonnade, 
after the designs of Mr Smith, architect, at an expense of about 
L.14,000. These alterations were completed in 1834, and fifty 
additional boys were soon after admitted; and in 1838, Mr Simp- 
son's trustees paid over to the governors L. 2000, in consideration 
of their being entitled to have twenty-six boys accommodated in 
the hospital in the same manner as the others, their maintenance 
and education being defrayed out of Mr Simpson's trust-funds at 
the annual average rate ; and in May 1838 they nominated four 
to be received, so that the whole number now in the house is 134. 

The age at which boys are admitted is from nine to twelve. They 
are clothed in a suit of blue cloth with flat bonnets. The average 
period of their remaining in the house is five years, it being a rule 
that no boy shall remain after he is sixteen years of age. On leavmg 
the hospital they are generally apprenticed to various trades and 
professions in Aberdeen, and at the end of the first year of their 
apprenticeship, they receive in name of apprentice-fee the sum of 
L. 8, 6s. 8d., and on the expiry of their apprenticeship the further 
sum of L.5, provided they have conducted themselves to the sa- 
tisfaction of their masters. If a boy can satisfy the governors that 
he has favourable prospects by leaving the country, he is allowed 
L.IO as an outfit, in full of all demands on the hospital. 

By a special clause in the charter of foundation, it is declared 
that young men educated in the hospital, who may afterwards ac- 
quire or succeed to a fortune equal to 4000marks L.216, 13s. 4d., 
shall be obliged to refund to the institution the whole expense of 
their maintenance and education. But although several indivi- 
duals, who had received the benefit of this institution, have attain- 



ABERDEEN. 



47 



ed to competent and even affluent circumstances, only two small 
donations have been made to it by those -who in early life had ex- 
perienced its benefit. 

The boys are under the care of the master and two teachers, 
by whom they are instructed in English reading, grammar, and 
elocution, writing, arithmetic, geometry, geography, book-keeping, 
French and Latin. They are also taught drawing and music by 
masters not resident in the house. By an agreement between the 
Governors and the Professors of Marischal College, four boys 
from the hospital may be recommended by the former to the ma 
theraatical and natural philosophy classes, to which they are ad- 
mitted without payment of fees. The religious and moral train- 
ing of the boys is superintended by the master, and a portion of 
one of the galleries in the West Church is rented by the hospital 
for their accommodation, and that of the master and teachers. 

Mechanics' Institution. — This institution was commenced in 
1824, soon after similar institutions had been established in seve- 
ral of the manufacturing towns of England and Scotland. At first, 
the plan adopted was to communicate instructions to mechanics by 
means of courses of lectures at a cheap rate, on natural philosophy, 
chemistry, &amp;c. and the attendance on these lectures was for a 
time numerous; but after a year or two it fell off so considerably 
that it was found necessary, in 1830, to discontinue the lectures, 
and if the projectors of the institution had not wisely vested a 
considerable part of the subscriptions originally obtained in the 
purchase of books, by which means with the help of numerous do- 
nations obtained, a valuable library was formed, the institution 
would have been extinguished. 

The library, however, which consists of about 1100 volumes on 
practical and scientific subjects, being the best selected, and the 
richest, perhaps, of the collections possessed by similar institutions 
m Scotland, proved a rallying point, and a few subscribers, who 
were sensible of the advantages to be derived from having ready 
access to the best writers on the subjects in which they were inte- 
rested, continued to supply the funds necessary for keeping it up. 
In this dormant state, the institution continued till 1835, when an 
attempt was made to remodel it after the pattern of the School of 
Arts m Edinburgh, by the establishment of classes at low rates in 
various branches of science and literature. These have been since 
continued, and with a considerable degree of success. In order to 
give regularity to the studies of the members, these classes were 



48 ABEllDEENSHIRE. 

arranged into a curriculum extending over three sessions, and they 
embraced instructions in English grammar and composition, French, 
geography, mechanical and architectural drawing, sketching, antl;i- 
metic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, mensuration, logarithms, 
&amp;c., mechanical philosophy, and chemistry. The most strikmg 
feature, however, of the new arrangements is the " Mutual Instruc- 
tion Class." As its name imports, the members instruct each 
other, and this is done by one reading a short essay or lecture on 
a subject previously intimated to the class, and approved of by it; 
after he has finished, a conversation takes place on the subject of 
the essay, in which the opinions advanced are impugned and de- 
fended, and additional information communicated. There is little 
method and no restriction as to the subjects chosen, except that 
controversial theology and politics are peremptorily excluded. 
This class has met with considerable encouragement, the number 
of members being during the winter season from 100 to 120; and 
individuals not members of the institution are admissible to it, the 
fees beincT 3s. annually from them, while those already belonging 
to the institution pay a fee of 2s. The fees of the other classes 
are 5s. for each class, except the drawing, which is 7s. ; and the 
price for the use of the library is 4s., the payment of which con- 
stitutes a member of the institution ; while attendance on the classes 
is entirely optional, and open to persons not using the hbrary it 
they incline it. The number of members of the institution at pre- 
sent is about 130. , 

United Fund.-' The Poor's Hospital was opened on the last 
day of October 1741, for the reception of such idle and strolling 
vagrants as should be found in town, and the poor inhabitants who 
had no visible way of earning their bread ; also for boys and giris, 
the children of poor inhabitants, and for destitute orphans who 
had no relations\o take care of them. Every person in the house 
.s to be employed in work or labour of some kind, according to 
Their St ength'and capacity; the children to attend the school in 
b se for certain hours every day ; the boys to be taught re 
no- writin.., arithmetic, and instructed in the principles of Chri.t. 
iaf kTow ledge, and bound to trades when they came to a cer ain 
; he girls to be taught knitting of stockings, and other rance

ties and persuasions." The revenue of tlie hospital appears to 
have consisted of a bequest left by Mr John Kemp in 1713, for 
maintaining a free school for educating poor children, together 
with four quarterly collections in the churches of the Establishment 
and several of the Dissenting chapels, and occasional donations 
. from individuals. To these were soon after added the proceeds of 
one-half of the residual estate of Mr Rickart of Auchnacant, be- 
queathed in 1741 towards endowing a workhouse in Aberdeen. In 
the year 1768, a system of out- door relief was deemed preferable 
for the adult and aged inmates of the hospital, and in order to 
constitute a fund for this purpose, as well as generally for the sup- 
ply of the parochial poor, without putting an end to the hospital as 
an educational establishment for orphans and destitute children, an 
agreement was entered into, whereby the kirk-session of St Ni- 
cholas engaged to pay L. 241 annually, being the estimated sur- 
plus of their hands after defraying certain settled charges ; the ma- 
nagers of the Poor's Hospital undertook to give L. 100, being the 
surplus remaining with them after meeting the estimated expense 
of maintaining and educating twenty-five boys ; and the managers 
of St Paul's Chapel agreed to contribute for one year, but it was 
annually continued for a considerable time, the sum of L. 30. 
By the union of these three, « the United Fund" was established, 
which was " to be distributed among the poor, and applied to all the 
charitable purposes at present provided either by the session or by 
the directors of the Poor's Hospital."t It was also resolved that 
the fund should be managed by all the session, together with ma- 
nagers chosen by the directors of the Poor's Hospital, and by the 
managers of St Paul's Chapel, in numbers proportioned to the ex- 
tent of their contributions. The foundation being thus laid of a 
fund for the support of the parochial poor, considerable additions 
were from time to time made to it by the donations and bequests . 
of mdividuals, and for nearly fifty years the money thus placed in 
the hands of the managers was found sufficient with strict econo- 
my for this purpose; but as the town became more populous and 
more commercial, the number of the poor increased; and in the 
year 1818, the desire to rid the streets of a number of beggars, by 
whom they were infested, and at the same time to avoid the impo- 
sition of a legal assessment for their maintenance, led to the col- 
lection of a voluntary contribution to meet the increasing demands

on the United Fund. At first, this plan was attended with success, 
the sum obtained being nearly L. 1000 ; but after a few years, the 
trouble of collection and other circumstances occasioned a gradual 
faUing off, so that in 1835 scarcely L.400 was obtained ; in con- 
sequence of which, it became unavoidable to attempt »™ "ther 
means of raising the requisite sum. Accordingly, in 1836, at a 
head court of the inhabitants, a resolution was entered into to raise 
the sum of L. 1700 for that year by an equitable self-imposed as- 
sessment on heritors and tenants, on a principle similar to ha 
which had been for some years acted on in Dundee and othei 
places. It was, however, found impossible to collect this assess- 
Ct without resorting to law, and in 1838 the 
obliged to interpose their authority and ="f"='= W""'' "s-

carefully distributed by the trustees of Mr Burnett, in accordance 
with his directions, among the aged and infirm, " with a preference 
to such persons who are known to have lived soberly and religious- 
ly;" but these, the most necessitous as well as the most deserving 
class of the parochial poor, are now merged in the general mass, 
and receive a supply simply and barely according to their necessi- 
ties, without reference to their previous character ; and the amount 
of this relief given to them forms an addition to the sum to be as- 
sessed on the inhabitants. 

The relief of the parochial poor is placed under the direc- 
tion of a committee consisting of delegates from the general kirk- 
session, the magistrates, the Dissenting congregations which con- 
tribute to the United Fund, and individual donors, together 
with a proportionate number of gentlemen appointed on behalf 
of the inhabitants at the time of commencing the self-imposed 
assessment. This committee meets in the beginning of every 
month to receive and determine on applications for rehef, which it 
is to be regretted is regulated much more by the means at their 
command, than by the necessities of the applicants, being, on an ave- 
rage, certainly not more than at the rate of 4s. a-month.

Boijs'' Hospital— In pursuance of the agreement entered into 
in the year 1768, respecting the relief of the parochial poor, the 
adult mmates of the work-house or Poor's Hospital, and the girls 
mam tamed there, were pensioned out of the United Fund, and the 
hospital was thenceforth devoted to the maintenance and education 
of boys only. The number of these was at first 25, and until the 
year 1795, when it was increased to 40, no addition was made to 
this number. The cause of this may be supposed to have been, 
that the United Fund necessarily occupied prominently the atten- 
tion of the managers, in consequence of the continual recurrence 
01 meetings regarding it, and the number and variety of the trans- 
actions connected with it; by which means, in the course of time 
a system of keeph.g the accounts of both institutions came to bj

introduced, by which the hospital was represented as subsidiary 
to the United Fund, and dependent on It for a considerable yearly 
sum, towards defraying its expenses. This, however, was not the 
case and on a careful scrutiny and separation of the various 
sources of revenue belonging to both, which was made in the year 
1828 it wa found that the income accruing to the Poor's Hospital 
vas abundantly sufficient for all its wants, and since that tmie the 
accounts have been kept entirely distinct. The house which had 
been occupied since 1740 by the hospital being found to stand in 
the way of projected improvements in the jail and court-house, 
was purchased from the managers, and the hospital was removed 
in the year 1818, to a house in the Gallowgate, which they bought 
Subsequently to this, the managers wished to increase the number ot 
the inmates, but the accommodations being inadequate, they, in 
the year 1829, purchased a house of larger size m the Upper 
Kirkcrate, and since then, fifty boys have been maintained and edu- 
catedn the " Boys' Hospital - and as there is still a certain sur- 
plus of funds, proposals have been at various times entertamed tor 
Sfurther extending the institution. The age of admission in o 
this hospital is from eight to ten, and the boys received into t are 
a gh the ordinary branches of education,-i.ading, writmg 
arithmetic, church music, and the prmciples of religion. The

paupers, in 1829. The encouragement given to it by the public 
was such, that next year the managers were enabled to increase 
the number to thirty, and in 1835 ten more were received. The 
ages within which these girls are admitted, are from six to nine ; 
the branches of education taught are, reading, writing, arithmetic, 
church music, sewing, knitting, and house-work, with instructions 
in the principles of religion, and they continue inmates of the hos- 
pital generally till they reach the age of fourteen.

House of Refuge. — The establishment of a House of Refuge in 
Aberdeen had been several times agitated, but it was not until 
1836 that sufficient funds for the purpose could be obtained. The 
munificent donation of L. 1000, then given by George Watt, Esq. 
surgeon, for the purpose of commencing this useful charity, was 
speedily followed up by a general subscription in the town and 
neighbourhood, and the sum of L. 3000 was raised in the course of 
a few months,— annual contributions to the extent of L. ISeTbeing 
at the same time subscribed for, and the institution was commen- 
ced, a body of directors chosen, and regulations laid down at a 
public meeting of the inhabitants. 

A suitable house having been hired and fiirnished, the House of 
Refuge was opened on the 5th September 1836. The mode of con- 
ducting the details of its management has been principally borrow- 
ed fnom the House of Refuge in Edinburgh ; and though many 
and great difficulties occurred in the outset, as indeed was to be 
anticipated, there is abundant reason to know that not a little 
good has been done by the institution, especially in regard to great 
numbers of neglected children, who are furnished with that educa- 
tion which their parents either could not or would not give them 
and that at an extremely moderate expense. 

Under the judicious care of the present superintendant, Mr Ed 
ward Keid, who had for some time officiated as chaplain and

schoolmaster before his appointment to be superintendant, and who 
still miites the duties of these two offices to those of the superin- 
tendant, the system of domestic management of the establish- 
ment has now been carried on for nearly two years, and the extent 
as well as the nature of the benefits derivable from the institution 
become more justly appreciated and more sensibly felt. 

In the first outset of any institution, a considerable expense must 
necessarily be incurred for furniture, &amp;c. ; while, on the other 
hand, the income of an infant institution is generally short consi- 
derably of what it afterwards reaches, when the public have become 
aware of its claims on their support. Hence, the expenditure of 
the House of Refuge during the first seven months was L. 725, 
while its income for the same period was only L. 191. Smce that 
time, two complete years have now elapsed, and the foUowmg is a

House of Industry and Magdalene Asylum. — Within these few 
months, the same benevolent individual whose liberality was the 
means of establishing the House of Refuge, has conveyed to trus- 
tees, named by himself, along with the directors of the House of 
Refuge, the property of Oldmill, situated about four miles west- 
ward from the town, which yields about L.164 of yearly rent, for 
the purpose of erecting and maintaining a House of Industry and 
a Magdalene Asylum. The necessary arrangements are not as 
yet completed, but there is no doubt that every possible diligence 
will be used, and that these beneficial institutions will be opened 
in the course of a very short time. 

Deaf and Dumb Institution. — This institution was opened in 
1819, a fund having been raised for the purpose by contributions 
gradually collected for a year or two previously, and the direction 
and instruction of its inmates were entrusted to Mr Robert 
Taylor, who had been sent to Paris to receive the necessary in- 
structions under the celebrated Abbe Sicard. In consequence of 
the insufficiency of the funds to provide for the entire maintenance 
of the institution, it was found necessary to adopt a rule that one- 
half of the board of the pupils only should be defrayed by the in- 
stitution, the other half being required to be advanced from 
some other source; and although the rate of board charged be on- 
ly L. 16 per annum, this rule has in several instances prevented 
the admission of children whose parents were unable to raise the 
required sum ; though, on the other hand, those who have used 
exertions, and made application either to public funds or to bene- 
volent individuals, have seldom been disappointed. 

Another class of boarders is also received under the charge of 
the teacher, who do not draw on the funds of the institution for 
any part of their maintenance, and the teacher, whose salary is 
only L. 60, is thus enabled, with advantage to the institution, from 
the increased number of pupils, to earn a comfortable livelihood. 



56 ABEHDEENSHIRE. 

I 

The branches of instruction taught in the institution are, the 
knowledge of objects, Enghsh reading and writing, arithmetic, 
geography, and the principles of religion. 

In 1834, Mr Taylor, having resigned the direction of the insti- 
tution, Mr Matthew R. Burns, himself deprived of hearing at a 
very early age, was appointed in his room ; and his sister, Miss 
Burns, was appointed housekeeper. At the time, some of the di- 
rectors felt a doubt whether Mr Burns's deafness might not prove 
an obstacle to his usefulness, while others were rather of opinion 
that, by placing him more closely on a par with his pupils, it would 
be an advantage. 

Respecting the result, it is unnecessary to say more than that, 
by his ability, zeal, and unwearied diligence, the pupils have been 
benefited in no conunon degree, and the character of the institution 
which depends entirely on that of the teacher, has been raised 
to the level of those excellent and more extensive institutions of the 
same kind in Edinburgh, London, and Dublin. The period of a pu- 
pil's continuance in the institution is usually about five years. The 
number at present receiving aid from the funds is 12, viz. 9 boys and 
3 girls. The expenditure is provided for by annual subscriptions, 
occasional donations, the sale of work done in the institution, and 
by the proceeds of an annual public examination of the pupils ; and 
the sums thus obtained have been sufficient, with great economy, 
to provide for the maintenance of a limited number of pupils ; but 
the institution is very far from meeting the necessities of the north 
of Scotland, as was contemplated at its original establishment. 

The following table shows the income and expenditure, with 
the number of pupils whose board was partly paid out of the 
funds, for the last seven years.

Burnett's Fund.— In the year 1783, Mr John Burnett of Dens 
died, bequeathing the bulk cf his property to the following cha- 
ritable purposes : Two-thirds of the rents of Kinnadie for the sup- 
port of aged and diseased poor persons in Aberdeen, with a spe- 
cial reference to their previous respectability and moral character. 
This distribution the amount of which was about L.250 annually 
was directed to be continued as long as there should be no legal 
assessment for the support of the poor of Aberdeen ; but m the 
event of an assessment being levied, then, durmg each year oi 



ABEUDEEN.

the continuance of such assessment, the money was directed to 
be applied by the managers of the Infirmary, one-half to' defray 
the expense of a physician to attend the sick poor of Aberdeen, 
who are not proper objects to be received into the infirmary, and 
the other half to the maintenance of pauper lunatics belonging to 
the town and county of Aberdeen ; and this alteration in the des- 
tination is declared perpetual if the assessment shall continue to 
be levied for seven successive years. The other third part of the 
rents was directed to be accumulated, for the purpose of yielding 
at the end of every forty years, reckoned from 1774, two prizes, 
of L. 1200 and L. 400 respectively, to be given to the authors of 
the two best essays on the following subject, " that there is a Being 
all-powerful, wise, and good, by whom every thing exists"; and 
particularly to obviate difficulties regarding the wisdom and good- 
ness of the Deity ; and this, in the first place, from considerations 
independent of written Revelation ; and in the second place,from 
the Revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ ; and from the whole to 
point out the inferences most necessary and useful to mankind." 

The decision of these prizes he directed to be by a committee 
of three individuals, chosen by his trustees and the Professors of 
King's and Marischal Colleges. 

The term of forty years prescribed by Mr Burnett, expiring in 
1814, the first adjudication of the prizes took place in that 
year : the three judges appointed by the trustees and the profes- 
sors were, the Rev. Dr Gilbert Gerrard, Professor of Divinity 
in King's College; Dr Robert Hamilton, Professor of Natural 
Philosophy in Marischal College ; and the Rev. Dr George 
Glennie, Professor of Moral Philosophy in Marischal College; 
and the first prize was by them adjudged to the Rev. Dr William 
Lawrence Brown, Principal of Marischal College ; and the se- 
cond to the Rev. John Bird Sumner, the present Bishop of Chester. 

Any surplus of this fund that may remain after the payment of 
these prizes is directed to be laid out in the purchase of lands, 
the rents of which are to be added to the other two-thirds. 

From the time of Mr Burnett's death until last year, the former 
destination of these two-thirds has been acted on by his trustees, 
and about 160 of the most deserving of the poor in Aberdeen have 
been supplied by the distribution of these funds in small monthly 
payments. An assessment having, however, been found altogether 
unavoidable, this source of supply to the poor has been cut off, and 
the pensioners on this fund have been transferred to the parochial

funds. The managers of the Infirmary, seeing that it would be ut- 
terly impossible for one physician to attend the sick poor who are 
not fit for reception into the house, now that the town is increased 
to upwards of four times the population which it contained at the 
time of Mr Burnett's death, and that the General Dispensary is 
well adapted to carry out the spirit of Mr Burnett's intentions, 
but is very insufficiently supported by the subscriptions raised 
for its benefit, — have resolved that the half of the fund placed under 
their direction for this purpose, shall be given for the present to 
that institution ; its application to be under the direction of a com- 
mitee, consisting of an equal number of Managers of the Infirmary, 
and Directors of the Dispensary ;— the other half they retain in 
their own hands, to be applied for the maintenance of pauper luna- 
tics from the town and county of Aberdeen in the Lunatic Asylum. 

Pauper Lunatic Fund. — In 1820, a fund was instituted for the 
purpose of defraying the expense attending the maintenance, in 
the Lunatic Asylum, of lunatic paupers belonging to the parish 
of St Nicholas. 

The sources from Avhich its support is derived are, collections 
formerly annual, but which have been discontinued for the last 
two years, in the churches of the Establishment and in several 
Dissenting churches, together with occasional donations and le- 
gacies, and its management is entrusted to a committee, consisting 
of the Established and other clergymen, with a few other gentle- 
men annually elected.

deeds dated in 1815, bequeathed a certain part of his property to 
trustees for distribution to various charitable objects, some of 
which were specified, and others left to the discretion of the trus- 
tees Among those specified by Mr Gordon, was one respecting 
M he expresses himself as follows:-" WUh regard to the 
sums bequeathed for the purpose of establishmg lectures on prac- 
ical religion at one or both universities, it may be proper to add 



ABERDEEN. 



59 



a few words explanatory of my design and intention in that be- 
quest. The effect of early impressions on the youthful mind is ge- 
nerally admitted. These lectures, therefore, if properly conduct- 
ed and pressed home, may, by the blessing of God, be the means 
of laying the foundation of an early piety in the youthful mind, 
and thus give God the first possession of the heart. Whilst al- 
most every branch of useful knowledge is ably taught in our Bri- 
tish universities, it is matter of regret that so little provision is 
made for the instruction of our youth in the more important duties of 
religion. In apportioning the sums of money for charitable purposes 
under this deed, I would, therefore, beg leave to recommend to my 
trustees, to give a decided preference to all charitable institutions 
having for their object the education of the rising generation, more 
especially where due attention is paid to their instruction in the prin- 
ciples of religion. In doing this, they veill best fulfil my intentions." 

The trustees accordingly, in the exercise of the powers devolv- 
ed on them, have annually paid L. 100 to lecturers on Practical 
Religion in King's and Marischal Colleges ; L. 150 to aged fe- 
male servants; L. 150 to Sunday schools; and set aside L. 300 as 
a fund for the establishment of an hospital for orphan and desti- 
tute girls; and the residue they have apportioned in annual or oc- 
casional donations to various institutions, such as the Deaf and 
Dumb Institution, the Sick Man's Friend Society, the Female 
Society, the Coal Fund, the Clothing Society, the Dispensaries, &amp;c. 

Carnegie's Fund.— In 1835, Mr John Carnegie bequeathed a 
sum of between L. 7000 and L. 8000 to certain trustees, for the 
purpose of establishing an hospital for female orphans, which will 
probably be conjoined with that portion of Mr Gordon's bequest 
which his trustees have set aside for a similar purpose. 

Orphan Girls' Hospital— In the year 1836, Mrs Elmslie, a 
widow lady, residing' in London, devoted a sum of L. 26,000 to 
the erection and endowment of an hospital at Aberdeen for orphan 
and destitute girls. This sum she believed that her husband, had 
he lived to execute his intention, would have applied for this pur- 
pose. Accordingly, a site having been selected on the west side 
of the town, the building was commenced, and is now very far ad- 
vanced towards completion. 

Shaw's Fund.—ln 1807, Alexander Shaw executed a deed, 
vesting his property in trustees, with directions that it should be 
allowed to accumulate till it should be sufficient to build and en- 
dow an hospital for 5 boys and 5 girls, either orphans, or desert- 



60 ABEllDEENSlllRli. 

ed and destitute ; these children to be admitted between the ages 
of two and four ; to take the name of either Shaw or Davidson ; 
and to be taught Enghsh, and a little French, writing, and arith- 
metic, the girls also to be taught needle-work. The boys to 
continue in the hospital till they are twelve years of age, and to be 
allowed L. 6 of apprentice fee, and to receive L. 10 when their 
apprenticeship is out ; the girls to continue in the hospital to the 
age of thirteen, and to get L. 10 if afterwards they remain five 
years in the families with whom they are placed as servants. A 
clause is also inserted in the deed, directing that any boy of supe- 
rior genius is to be retained in the hospital till he is twenty-one 
years of age, to study the French language diligently, and to be 
permitted to learn any profession for which he may be fitted and 
most inclined. As yet the trustees have not been in a condition 
to carry this deed into full effect, but they have within the last few 
months rented a house in the Gallowgate for the purpose of carry- 
ing into execution the benevolent designs of the founder. 

Miss Cruickshank's Fund.— M\ss Elizabeth Cruickshank, who 
died in 1818, bequeathed the bulk of her property to trustees, for 
the purpose of accumulation until it should be sufficient to found 
and support an asylum for the blind in Aberdeen. These trus- 
tees were three in number, but two of them having died, the sur- 
vivor, by virtue of a power contained in the deed, assumed, in the 
year 1832, several gentlemen to act along with him in the dis- 
charge of the trust. 

Various difficulties occurred in regard to the disposal of some 
parts of the property, and it was not until very lately that any fur- 
ther steps were taken towards carrying Miss Cruickshank's bene- 
volent intentions into effect, than taking a census of the number of 
blind persons in the city of Aberdeen and its neighbourhood, with 
their ages and circumstances. Within the last few weeks, how- 
ever, a plan of the intended building has been approved of, and its 
erection will be proceeded in forthwith. 

United Coal J'mwJ.— Bequests had been at different times made by 
variousindividuals for the purpose of supplying the poor of Aberdeen 
with coals during the inclement weather in winter, and in 1801, by 
an agreement among the trustees appointed over four of these be- 
quests, viz. those of Mr Alexander Robertson, Mr Andrew Robert- 
son, Mr John Smith, and Mr John Cushnie, they were united.into 
one fund for this benevolent purpose. The fund thus obtamed 
amounted to L. 1000, and by various donations and bequests.since 

3

added, it has now reached to nearly L. 2900 ; the interest of which, 
alono- with occasional donations, and sometimes, in cases of necessity, 
a small portion of the principal, is annually expended in the purchase 
of coals in summer, which are distributed during winter, in por- 
tions of one-fourth of a boll or one-sixteenth of a ton to each fa- 
mily. The fund is placed under the management of twenty-one 
gentlemen chosen from the kirk-session, the magistrates, the ma- 
nagers of the Poor's Hospital, and the contributors or their trus- 
tee's. The quantities of coals distributed for the last seven years 
have been as follows : — 

1832, - 175 tons. 

1833, - 185i

Ladies' Working Society. — It is little more than a year since this 
society was instituted for the purpose of providing industrious fe- 
males with the means of support, by supplying them with needle- 
work, mostly of a plain and useful kind, and by exposing the fruits 
of their industry for sale at a moderate price. It may be regarded 
as a useful assistant to the Clothing Society, and as serving, in 
some degree, to lessen the demands on the funds of the Female 
Society. It is managed by a committee of ladies, and depends 
for its funds entirely on the contributions of members, and the sale 
of the work done for the society by its objects. 

Clothing Society. — This society was commenced in 1817, for the 
purpose of supplying articles of clothing to the industrious poor. 
It is managed by a committee of ladies, who superintend the mak- 
ing of the clothes, and personally investigate the cases recom- 
mended before any supply is given. 

The funds arise entirely from the contributions of members, 
with occasional donations and legacies. From deficiency of funds, 
the society has been unable, in general, to make a distribution of 
clothes oftener than once in two years, when articles, to the value 
of about L. 300, have been given to nearly 1000 individuals, each 
article being previously stamped with the name of the society. 

Within the last year, the plan ofthe society has been modified 
m several particulars, the chief of which is, that the clothes dis- 
tributed shall not be considered as given, but as lent to the per- 
sons receiving them, — a measure by which the society will be bet- 
ter enabled to guard against the abuses to which they were for- 



62 ABERDEENSHIRE. 

merly subjected by individuals pawning or selling tbe articles which 
had been furnished to them. 

Sick Man's Friend Society. — This benevolent society was 
instituted in the year 1792, and its object is, the relief of the 
indigent sick, by affording them such aid in money from time 
to time as the funds will bear, and the circumstances of the objects 
seem to call for. The town is divided into thirty-two districts, which 
are allotted to visitors, whose duty it is personally to investigate the 
cases recommended for assistance, and to direct the amount of 
relief to be given, which is in payments of Is. each, monthly, fort- 
nightly, or weekly, according to the necessities of the case. 

The amount distributed annually has been, for some time, nearly 
L. 320, the whole of which arises from the annual contributions of 
members, donations, and occasional legacies. 

Female Society. — This society was commenced in 1805, for the 
relief of aged and indigent females. Its funds are derived from 
the subscriptions of its members, and occasional donations and be- 
quests It is managed by a committee of ladies, who personally 
investigate the cases recommended befpre giving relief. The dis- 
tribution is in sums of Is. 6d., 2s. 6d., or 3s. twice a quarter, and 
in this way about L. 250 are distributed annually. The number 
of regular pensioners on the society's books is at present about 
230, besides a good many receiving occasional supply. 

Bible Societies.— In 1811, a society was instituted in Aberdeen, 
auxiharytothe British and Foreign Bible Society, and its operations 
were carried on with considerable zeal and success, and besides 
supplying considerable numbers of Bibles to the surrounding dis- 
tricts, contributions to a large amount were sent by it to the so- 
ciety in London. The disputes that arose in 1826 in consequence 
of the distribution of the Apocrypha by the London Society, and 
. other practices that were by many felt to be wrong, led in 1827, 
to the formation of another Bible Society, whose surplus funds have 
generally been devoted to aid the operations of the Edinburgh 
Bible Society. 

Previous to this, a society had been instituted in Aberdeen for 
the purpose of supplying Bibles at prime cost to the sailors trad- 
ing at the port, which, after issuing in the course of nine years 
upwards of 2300 Bibles, was, in 1827, joined with the Auxiliary 
Naval and Military Bible Society, then recently instituted, the 
object of which is the same with that of the similar societies m 
London, Edinburgh, &amp;c. viz. to supply Bibles and Testaments at a 
reduced price, generally about two-thirds of the prime cost, to 



ABERDEEN.

soldiers, sailors, bargemen, fishers, and pensioners. The surplus 
funds of this society, which, however, can never be large, in con- 
sequence of the terms on which the supply is afforded, are re- 
mitted to the Naval and Military Bible Society in London. 

In the following table a view is given of the income of each of

Missionary and other Religious Societies. — There are many as- 
sociations of these descriptions in Aberdeen, some of which are 
supported exclusively by the members of the Established Church, 
others by various Dissenting bodies, and some indiscriminately by 
both. As, however, they are all without any permanent funds or 
vested property, it has been too often found that after being sup- 
ported with spirit for a time, they have been liable to languish, 
while new ones are instituted or old ones revived from time to time, 
as occasional impulses are given. Their existence and efficiency 
are thus rendered so precarious, that it becomes not easy to say 
how many of them are at any time in active operation. 

The following is, however, given as a tolerably correct list of 
the principal ones : 

Two Religious Tract Societies,— the one, instituted in 1797 and 
revived in 1811, has distributed about 1,500,000 tracts, partly gra- 
tuitously, and partly sold at low prices ;— the other lately instituted. 

Eight Missionary Societies, of which three are supported by 
members of the Church of Scotland, and five by Dissenters of va- 
rious denominations. 

One Gratis Sabbath Evening School Society, established in 
1797— supported by Dissenters— has at present about twenty 
schools, attended by nearly 1000 pupils. 

One Seamens Friend Society, instituted in 1823, has a chapel 
and a school for girls, the male children being received into the

Union Parish Parochial School. At first, the chapel was sup- 
plied by ministers of the Established and Dissenting churches ; 
but the Voluntary controversy having put an end to this, the sup- 
ply was found too burdensome for the parochial ministers alone. 
A chaplain was therefore appointed, but the funds could not long 
bear the expense of his salary, and the chapel has been for some 
time shut up. An effort has lately been made to clear off the 
debt affecting the chapel, and this being now nearly effected, there 
is reason to hope that a small parochial district will be allotted, 
and a minister settled in it in a short time. 

One society for promoting Christianity among the Jews; one 
for promoting the Religious principles of the Reformation ; one 
Antipatronage Society; one North American Colonial Society; 
one Temperance Society ; one for Promoting Education in the 
Highlands and Islands ; one for promoting Female Education in 
India ; two for promoting the total Abolition of Slavery ; one for 
the Defence and Extension of the Church of Scotland; one for pro- 
moting Education and Reformation among the Prisoners in the Jail. 

Harbour.— T\\e river, as it approaches the sea, passes through 
a wide basin which formerly extended from the foot of the Castle 
Hill, on the north side, to the lands of Torrie on the south, and 
the harbour of Aberdeen consisted merely of a channel near the 
north side of this basin, separated from the course of the Dee by 
the Inches— low sandy islands, generally covered at high water. 
For the accommodation of shipping in this harbour, the quayhead 
was erected at what period is not known opposite to the place 
where the weigh-house now is, and access was obtained to.it from 
the town by the Shore Brae. The entrance to this harbour was 
bad, owing to a bar at the mouth of the river, the depth of water 
in which was often not more than two feet at low water. The 
earliest attempts to effect any improvement were by the erection 
of a bulwark on the south side of the entrance, in 1608, and the 
removal, in 1618, of a large stone, which lay nearly in the middle 
of the river. Between 1623 and 1658, the quay was extended 
eastward towards Futtie, by which means a considerable portion 
of ground was redeemed below the Castle Hill, and this is now 
covered with buildings. In 1755, an additional quay was built a 
good way farther down, opposite the village of Torne. In 17/0, 
further improvements were projected, and on a report from Mr 
Smeaton, recommending the erection of a pier on the north side 
of the entrance, by which the influx of sand frorn the north might 
be prevented, and the removal of the bar effected by coufinmg the

water of the Dee within narrower bounds, the work was commen- 
ced in 1775, and finished in 1781. The length of this pier was 
1200 feet, and it terminated in a round head, whose diameter was 
60 feet. Owing to a departure from Mr Smeaton's plan, the pier 
having been founded too far to the north, it was found that a 
heavy swell entered the harbour, — to obviate which, it was found 
necessary to project a bulwark from the pier, about one-third across 
the channel. By these means a considerable improvement was ef- 
fected, but as the trade of the city increased, inconvenience was 
still felt from deficiency of water on the bar, and, in 1810, Mr Tel- 
ford, having been consulted on the means of remedying this, recom- 
mended that the pier should be extended, and that wet docks 
should be formed in the harbour. These works were undertaken 
forthwith, and the pier was completed in 1816 to the extent of 
900 feet beyond the head of Mr Smeaton's pier, where it was 
finished with a round head. This, however, was destroyed by the 
sea in the following winter, but being rebuilt with a slope towards 
the sea, it has since stood without very material damage. A break- 
water, extending to the length of 800 feet, was also built on the 
south side, by which the mouth of the channel was narrowed, and 
the entrance protected from the south-east storms. Wharfs were 
built along the harbour on the south-west side of Futtie— the pier 
formerly built opposite Torrie was enlarged, and more lately the 
quay has been extended westward from the old quay-head, and by 
raismg embankments on the Inches, a considerable range of quay- 
room has been obtained there, which is connected with the town 
by a swivel bridge opposite the foot of Marischal Street. By means 
of all these improvements quay-room has been provided to the ex- 
tent of about 4000 feet, and a tide harbour has been formed in 
which the depth of water at spring tides is about 1 ] feet at the west 
end, gradually mcreasing to about 15 feet, where it joins the course 
ot the river, and the depth of water on the bar has been increased 
to about 1 9 feet. 

The wet docks planned by Mr Telford not having been execut- 
ed, a plan for completing the harbour, not very materially different 
trom his, was lately recommended by Mr Walker, and a Bill found-' 
ed on this plan was last session introduced into Parliament, but it 
was thrown out in committee, in consequence of the opposition 
made to it by many of the merchants and shipowners, to whom it 
appeared that it would have the effect of greatly curtailing the ex- 

abeudeS' '''" ''"y """' compensation

by the increase of accommodation, which it was proposed to pro- 
vide in the docks,— while n very serious addition would be made 
to the debt by which the harbour funds are already encumbered. 

Shipping, Ship-huildinff, and Trac/e.- Ship-building is carried 
on in Aberdeen by several firms with considerable spirit, as the 
subjoined table of the vessels and tonnage built here for the last 

seven years will evince :

Within the last year, the building of iron vessels has been com- 
menced in this port, and a very large one of this description is 
now nearly ready for being launched. • r v, r 

In 1836, the harbour trustees furnished a patent slip for hauling  
up vessels requiring repair. The cost of this was L. 3337. t 
has been extensively employed, and the sums paid for its use wi 1 
abundantly compensate for the expense incurred m procurmg it, 
while great facility is thus given to the repair of vessels. 

The number of vessels and the amount of their tonnage, regis- 
tered as belonging to the port of Aberdeen for the last seven 
years is as follows :

The introduction of steam navigation at Aberdeen took place 
in 1821, when the Velocity of 256 tons burthen, and furnished 
with two engines of 110 horses' power, began to ply between Aber- 
deen and Leith. Another vessel was soon after put mto the same 
trade, and more recently, other two with more powerful engines 
were added, and these now run during the greater part of the year 
between Leith and Aberdeen, making also stated voyages to Ler- 
wick and Kirkwall, and to Wick and Inverness The amount of 
steam power at present employed in this trade is 640 horses 
power, and the tonnage of the vessels is 1360 tons. 

In 1827, a steamer of larger size than any of the.e, the 
Queen of Scotland, of 550 tons, began to ply eUeen Lon- 
don and Aberdeen, and soon after, another was put into the 
sle tl de. A third, still larger, was more recently added, 
Xn opposition having been attempted by --her comjn 
a junction was soon after effected in consequen e of wl ich a 
fo irth steamer was employed. These vessels sail 
Aberdeen and London ; but it is cause of regret to many that the 



ABERDEEN, G7 



time fixed on for their sailing is the evening tide of Saturday, by 
which means they are necessarily at sea on the Sabbath ; and 
when any detention occurs from weather or other causes, they 
most improperly leave the port on the Sabbath day. Attempts 
have been made to put an end to this abuse, but they have not as 
yet been successful. The amount of steam power in the vessels 
in this trade is 860 horses' power, and their tonnage is 2410 tons. 
One of these vessels makes weekly voyages to Hull. There is 
an inconvenience attending the use of these large vessels, that, 
from their draught of water, they are unable to enter or leave the 
harbour, except at the top of the tide ; and sometimes when the 
tide is small, detention takes place from their not having sufficient 
water to float them if they are heavily laden, especially as there is 
a bank formed where the basin of the harbour joins the channel 
of the Dee, which it has not as yet been found practicable com- 
pletely to remove, and on which they sometimes get aground ; 
so that, on the whole, it seems preferable, at least in the present 
state of the harbour, to employ vessels of a smaller draught of 
water. 

Besides these, there are two steamers which sail between Dun- 
dee and Aberdeen, and one between Aberdeen and Peterhead 
dunng the summer season. A small tug steamer is employed for 
hauhng ships into the harbour, and taking them out when required. 

Several steamers have been built and wholly fitted up at Aber- 
deen ; and the making of marine steam-engines is carried on bv 
two firms to a considerable extent. 

The extent of the shipping trade of Aberdeen may be, in some 
degree, estimated by the following table drawn up for the last five 
years by Mr Riddell, the clerk of the Shore Dues' Office, which 
exhibits a view of the shipping actually arriving at the port in the 
course of each year, terminating on the 1st July :

Canal —In 1793, tl.e formation of a navigable canal for barges, 
to connect the harbom- of Aberdeen with the river Don at Inverury, 
was projected, and in 1796 an Act of Parliament was obtamed, by 
ILh the projectors were empowered to ra.se by the sale of shares 
L 20,000 for this purpose. Of this sum only L. 17,700 was raised, 
and it was found necessary to apply for another act .d.ch ..s 

obtained in 1801, empowering t-P-P-JVVTo 000 f' this 
additional by the creation of «ew shares. Only L.10,000 of t us 
:vas lained, but not long after other L.10,000 was ra.ed by 
mortjrao-e, and the canal was opened m 1807. 

Its enith is a little more than 18 miles. Us average bi;eadth . 
abo t 2 feet at the surfxce of the water, and the depth .s 3 feet 
9 inles. It has 17 locks, one of which is 10 feet uj he.ght, U 
f f M ..K-h and one is 3 feet. The line chosen for it .s not, 
Tt f n'o le, the most advantageous that migbthave 
be obtained, as it throws the greater number of the locks to tl e 
W end, witliin threeor four miles of Aberdeen, m consequence of

which the delay and expense of shoi't carriages are rendered con- 
siderably greater than they would have been otherwise, and the 
inducement to the transport, for example, of stones from the large 
granite quarries in the neighbourhood of the town, is much lessen- 
ed. Nevertiieless, the trade on it has not been inconsiderable, 
though hitherto not sufficient to pay off the mortgage debt, and 
therefore, as yet, altogether unproductive to the holders of either 
the new or the original shares. 

In 1832, the holders of the mortgage, being sensible of the great 
advantage which would accrue to the trade of the canal from its 
being connected by a tide-lock with the harbour, agreed to fore- 
go their dividends for a time, in order to permit this to be elTected, 
and the tide-lock, whose height is 6 feet, was accordmgly executed 
in 1834, at an expense of about L.1500. 

By this means, the canal barges can be loaded and discharged 
at the ship's side, and can enter the canal readily at half-tide ; by 
which, the intercourse on it has been greatly facilitated and the 
trade consequently increased. The dues charged on articles con- 
veyed by the canal are from d. to ld. per ton per mile, accord- 
ing to the nature of the goods. 

The following tables shew the quantities of the principal ar- 
ticles transported by the canal for the last seven years : —

The increase in the quantity of grain is to be in part ascribed 
to the introduction of covered barges, by which the cargo is effec- 
tually protected from rain on its passage. 

A Fly or passage boat was, at an early period, established on the 
canal, and for some years it was carried on with considerable suc- 
cess ; but the establishment of numerous coaches on the adjoin- 
ing turnpike road, presenting the advantage of quicker travelling, 
though at a higher rate, had the effect of diminishing the profits 
of the fly-boat very materially. With the view of obtaming a re-

newal of the encouragement formerly given to it, an iron boat was 
lately procured, and the rate of going was increased from about four 
to eight or nine miles an hour. The experiment cannot be, by any 
means, said to have failed, but the effect has not hitherto been so 
favourable as might have been anticipated. 

Flax Manufacture. — The manufacture of flax is carried on to a 
considerable extent in Aberdeen by three firms, all of which carry 
on the several branches of spinning, bleaching, and the manufac- 
ture of linen of every quality, from the coarsest floor-cloth and 
Osnaburghs, to the finest shirting, and one of the houses is exten- 
sively engaged in the manufacture of sewing thread. 

The aggregate power employed by them consists of steam to 
the extent of about 460 horses' power, and water used in the 
mills on Don side, about two miles from Aberdeen, to the extent 
of about 250 horses' power.' 

The number of persons employed in these branches of manu- 
facture is about 7600, of whom nearly two-thirds work in the mills, 
and the, remainder are employed at the bleachfields, or as out-door 
weavers. 

The amount of wages paid by these houses weekly is about 
L. 2600 or L. 2700, at rates varying from 2s. 6d. to 8s. to girls, 
and from 7s. to L. 1 to weavers. 

Cotton Manufacture.— branch of manufacture is carried on 
at Aberdeen by four houses, all of which are employed as spinners, 
and one of them also in power-loom weaving. 

Two of these houses have their works on Don side, about three 
miles from Aberdeen. The other two are in town. The ag- 
gregate of. power employed by these firms is about 600 horses' 
power, of which 260 are obtained by water power, the rest being 

The number of hands employed in this branch is about 2000 
or 2200, and the weekly amount of wages paid is from L. 700 to 
L.800. 

Woollen Manufacture.— There are in Aberdeen and the neigh- 
bourhood two large houses engaged in the woollen trade, and four 
or five small ones. They are principally occupied in making of 
worsted carpets and liosiery. One of them is also employed in the 
manufacture of broad cloth. 

' During the sumnier season, there is often a deficiency of water in the river, and 
sevevS steam engines have heen put up for the purpose of mectn.g th.s exigency. 
This applies iilso to the flax-mills on the Don.

The extent of the power used by them is about 320 horses' 
power, of which 150 are obtained by water, the rest being steam. 

From 2200 to 2500 persons are in the employ of these houses, 
and the weekly amount of wages paid is about L. 1000. 

Stone Trade. — The trade of Aberdeen in stones is very consi- 
derable, as will be seen from the table of exports. The principal 
part of this trade is in paving stones sent to London ; but there 
have also been, at various times, large quantities of building stones 
exported ; and some of the bridges over the Thames are in great 
part built of, or faced with, Aberdeen granite. Some of the largest 
blocks that have been exported, were those sent, not many years 
since, to the docks t;t Sheerness. The extreme beauty of the 
granite when polished is well known ; but its very great hardness 
formed an almost insuperable bar to its general introduction, while 
the work of polishing it was carried on only by manual labour. 
Within these few years, however, Mr Alexander Macdonald has 
contrived, by several very ingenious adaptations of machinery to 
this purpose, and by some very considerable improvements in the 
tools used, to effect a very great reduction in the expense of the 
process, insomuch that ornamental articles of polished granite, 
such as slabs, chimney pieces, pedestals, and vases may now be 
procured from his manufactory here, for about one-third of the 
price which formerly they cost 

Iron Manufacture.— The quantity of iron annually worked in 
Aberdeen is very considerable, and it is daily increasing, in con- 
sequence of the introduction of new branches of the manufacture, 
or of the extension of those formerly existing in the place. It is 
not many years since the making of spinning machinery, and of 
steam-engines, was altogether unknown in the town, and there are 
now eight or ten machine-makers, of whom five are engaged in the 
making of steam-engines; and three, to a considerable extent, make 
both land and marine engines. Iron ship-building, too, has been 
introduced here within the last two years, and there is at present 
a vessel of this description on the stocks, of the burden of 550 
tons by measurement, being, it is believed, the largest sailing ves- 
sel that has yet been constructed of iron. 

There are in Aberdeen and its immediate vicinity eight founde- 
nes, at most of which the heaviest castings can be executed. One 
of the firms engaged in this trade has a forge hammer and a rol- 
ling mill ; and there are three establishments at which the hea- 
viest anchor-work is performed. There arc also two houses 



en- 



72 ABERDEENSHIRE. 

gaged to a considerable extent in chain-making; and five or six of 
the firms are employed in boiler-making. 

The nmnber of men employed in this trade may be about 1000. 
It is difficult to state the average rate of wages with any degree 
of confidence ; perhaps it may be from 18s. to L. 1, 5s. weekly ; 
and the annual amount of wages paid is probably not under 
L. 50,000. 

Paper-making. — The first paper-mill in this neighbourhood was 
erected at Peterculter about the year 1770. Others were sub- 
sequently set agoing in other situations ; and there are now four 
in the vicinity of Aberdeen, viz. at Peterculter, belonging to 
Messrs Arbuthnot and M'Combie; at Mugiemoss, Charles Da- 
vidson and Sons ; at Waterton, Thomas Jaffray ; and at Stony- 
wood, Messrs Alexander Pirie and Sons. Of these, the three 
first make only coarse paper ; the last makes writing and printing 
papers. 

The power employed to drive these mills is altogether by water, 
and cannot be reckoned at less than 250 horses' power, and the 
number of persons directly occupied in the manufacture may be 
from 300 to 400. Within the last five years, the quantity manu- 
factured has been doubled, and there is a prospect of a still increas- 
ing production. The material for the coarse papers consisting of 
rags, ropes, and mill waste, is mostly collected in this and the 
neighbouring counties. For the finer kinds the chief supply is from 
abroad, though considerable quantities of rags are collected here. 

By the last returns of the Excise from which we can derive 
local information, the duty upon the paper manufactured in the 

neighbourhood of Aberdeen was, for the year ending 5th January 

1835, 

1st Class paper, paying at that time a duty of 3d. per lb., 

1 014 768 lbs . - • • • J-.. iz,o5-t i- " 
2d Class paper, paying a duty of ld. per lb. 245,537 lbs., li 

L. 14,219 4 H 

We have no certain ground to go upon in regard to the quan- 
tity produced last year ; but it is probable that the duty paid at 
the equalized rate of Hd. per lb. amounted to nearly, if not fully, 
L. 12,000. 

Bope and Twine-maJdng.— There are in Aberdeen eight rope- 
making works of considerable extent, besides several small ones; 
and of these, three are chiefly employed in the manufacture ol 
cordage for ships, the others being principally engaged in rope- 



ABERDEEN.

making for agricultural and general purposes, and in the making 
of twines for fishing and for manufacturers. The number of men 
and boys employed in this branch of manufacture is rather above 
than under 200. It is not easy to give any statement of the amount 
of wages paid, as some of the manufacturers hire their men by the 
piece, and others do not; but it cannot probably be much under 
L. 6000 annually. 

Comb-making. — This branch of industry was introduced into 
Aberdeen as far back as 1788, but it was carried on in a very small 
way only till 1830, when the firm of Stewart, Rowell, and Co. 
commenced on a larger scale than has been done in any other part 
of Scotland, and they were the first in Scotland to apply steam- 
power to this department. 

The number of workmen employed by this firm is at present 
245, the weekly amount of wages paid by them about L. 90, and 
the number of combs of all kinds finished in this manufactory 
amounts to about 43,200 weekly, which, in consequence of the im- 
provements recently introduced in the methods of manufacture, 
can be sold now at a price not more than one-sixth of what they 
cost nine years ago. 

Fisheries. — It is probable that there have been fishers settled at 
the mouth of the Dee, both in Futtie and at Torrie, on the south 
side ever since Aberdeen became a town of any noticeable mag- 
nitude. The fishers who now inhabit these villages are, like those 
along most of the east coast of Scotland, evidently of a race dis- 
tinct from the other inhabitants, and from their aspect, features, 
and other circumstances, it seems probable that they have come 
from the opposite coasts of Denmark and Sweden. 

They occupy a village consisting of two squares of houses, which 
were erected by the town some twenty years ago, at the south-east 
extremity of the parish, and immediately adjacent to the entrance 
of the harbour. Each house consists of a but and a ben, with oc- 
casionally a small apartment between. The magistrates designed 
to have made the houses of two stories, but the fishers refused to 
live up stairs, and they also refused to have any other than an 
earthen floor in their houses. In both of these, though there may 
have been some superstition afid a good deal'of prejudice, there 
was also some reason,— for it would have been next to impossible 
for them to have kept a wooden floor clean, while an earthen one, 
if not clean, at any rate does not show the dirt so much, and it 
would have been very inconvenient for them to lug their long lines 



74 ABEHDEENSIilllE. 

and their heavy baskets up stairs. On the whole, their houses are, 
generally speaking, as clean and comfortable as the nature of their 
occupation will admit of. 

From the circumstance of most of these fishers being employed 
as pilots, and from their immediate connection with the harbour, 
and constant intercourse with the inhabitants of Aberdeen, there 
is in them a greater degree of civilization than is observable m 
most of the other fishing communities. At the same time, their 
double employment as fishers and pilots is by no means favourable 
to their religious, moral, and domestic habits. 

The unavoidable want, of regularity in their hours, the general 
practice of giving allowances in drink for any particular service, 
and their custom of dividing the pilotage money among the boat's 
crews generally on Saturday evening, all tend to lead them to the 
public house, where sometimes a large portion of their earnings is 
spent. Yet drunkenness, though prevalent among them, is by no 
means universal, and the number of exceptions seems to be increas- 
ing of late. 

A fisherman who is a pilot will earn as much as L. 1, 10s. or 
even L. 2 per week during summer, but not half so much during 
winter. On an average, however, they can make fully as much as 
any other labourers in the same class of society, and of this money 
the husband has the possession and command, while the wife re- 
tains possession of all the money arising from the sale of fish. It 
is not often that either party manages these gains to the best ad- 
vantage. 1 1, i. 

The fishers are a hard-working people and extremely honest, 
and they deem it the greatest possible reproach to cast a doubt on 
their honesty, which they are the more easily enabled to maintain 
unimpeachable, because all their bargains and transactions are lor 
ready money. 

They seldom marry with persons not of their own community, 
except in a few instances where the daughters of fishers have mar- 
ried with seamen and ship-carpenters. This may arise not so 
much from any dislike to form connections out of their own cratt, 
as from the fact that, on the one hand, a fisherman would find a 
woman of any other class wholly incapable of giving him any as- 
sistance in this occupation, and unable to perform the hard work 
devolving on the fisherwomen ; and, on the other hand, a hshei- 
woman, from the irregularity of her occupation, and want of le.sme 
and opportunity to attend to her daughters, unless when they fol- 



ABEHDEEN. 75 

low her in her fishing employments, cannot educate them so as to 
be useful wives to persons of any other class. 

A free school was established some years ago by Mr John Da- 
vidson, goldsmith, exclusively for the white-fishers, and it has been 
the means of doing a great deal of good among them. It is taught 
on the plan of the sessional school, and its effects are manifest in 
the decided and progressive improvement of the manners and ha- 
bits of the fishers. The children who attend the school re -act on 
their parents, and, as it were, shame them out of their indifference 
to useful knowledge and habits. 

The fishers are, generally speaking, a long-lived people and 
very healthy, and, notwithstanding the dangerous nature of their 
occupation, there are few accidents of serious consequence among 
them. 

Like most other fishermen, they have a good many superstitious 
ideas and practices, and they have implicit faith in many traditions, 
and in various omens. Thus they reckon it very offensive for any 
one to count a boat's crew, or a company of them returning from 
market, and it is not less so to tell how many fish they have caught. 
If a fisher be turned back when he is going out to fish, he will on 
no account go out that day, and is very much provoked. Often, 
too, things, which any one but they would esteem mere trifles, can- 
not be spoken of without interfering with some omen, whose influ- 
ence they would hold it sinful to doubt. 

It is at the same time to be noticed, that the fishers of Futtie 
have less superstitions than those that live in the fishing-villages 
along the coast, both to the north and south, where they live al- 
most entirely secluded from intercourse with the inland agricultu-- 
ral population. 

ffhale-Fisking was first introduced into Aberdeen in the year 
1753, and the success which attended the first attempts induced 
others to embark in the same trade, which, for a time, was very 
profitable. Accordingly, the number of ships from Aberdeen en- 
gaged m whale-fishing gradually increased, till, in 1820, there were 
titteen, which, on an average, had about fifty ha.ids each. The 
greatest tonnage of oil brought home by these vessels in one sea- 
son was HI 1823, when fourteen vessels brought 1841 tons. Of 
ate years, however, from various causes, such as the withdrawing 
01 the Government bounty, the reduction of the duty on foreign 
seeds Irom which oil is made, the diminished demand for oil ''of 
' '«"«eq»ence of the introduction of gas as a means of ob-

taining light, and the want of success in the fishery, several ves- 
sels having repeatedly come home clean, the trade has been, in a 
great measure, given up, and there are only two vessels at present 
engaged in it from this port. 

Salmon-Fishing.— branch of trade has been long carried 
on with considerable spirit, and generally with good success, at 
Aberdeen, and the rents of the fishings in the river Dee form an 
important item in the revenue of the town, and of several private 
proprietors. Of late, too, the fishing has been carried on to a 
considerable extent by stake-nets on the beach. 

At present, the number of men employed in salmon -fishing here 
may be about 200, and the annual amount of wages paid about 
L. 3000. In an average season, the quantity of fish caught may 
be reckoned at 20,000 salmon, averaging ten lbs. each, and 40,000 
grilses of four pounds each, of which by far the greater part is pack- 
ed in ice, and shipped for the London market, a very small part only 
beincr put into tin cases for exportation. It is now about thirty 
years since the mode of using ice for preserving the salmon fresh 
was introduced in Aberdeen. Previous to that time, the fishers 
were under the necessity of boiling it and preservmg it with vuie- 
gar but this mode is now almost altogether disused. The average 
price obtained for the salmon and grilses sent to London is about 

8d. per lb.  i • i u 

Herring-Fishing.-\Jnix\ within the last few years, this branch 

of industry was not prosecuted to any extent in Aberdeen. The 
late Provost Blaikie used his endeavours to establish it, and, to a 
certain degree, these endeavours were successful. The number ot 
boats employed in it has been annually increasing; and last year 
there were about 60 thus engaged during the season, and their 
success has hitherto been such as leaves no room for doubting, that 
this fishery will continue to be prosecuted, probably to a greater 
extent than it has hitherto been. 

uvvlv of Water.-kher two ineffectual attempts in the course 
of the seventeenth century, measures were at last taken in 1706 or 
introducing a supply of spring water into the town, and at first a 
Tcrle well was splied in Castle Street ; but soon af er, _others 
added in different parts of the town. The supply having be- 
l ripouate from the increased population, additional sprmgs

was more pure than what came from the upper and more distant 
springs ; but both the low level and the'smallness of the springs pre- 
vented the whole of the town being supplied from them. The average 
produce of the lower springs in ordinary seasons was about 75 gal- 
lons per minute, and of the upper springs about 55 ; but both were 
hable to considerable diminution in dry seasons. The demands of 
the city having increased with its population, and considerable in- 
convenience having been experienced on several occasions by the 
deficiency of the supply, it was resolved in 1830 to bring a supply 
of water into town from the river Dee, and for this purpose a steam- 
engine was erected at the north end of the bridge of Dee, about 
a mile and three-quarters distant. The water is brought to tiiis 
engine by a tunnel about a quarter of a mile long, which does not 
communicate directly with the river, but receives the water by fil- 
tration through a bed of sand. There are two single stroke en- 
gines used, each of fifty horses' power, which are wrought alternate- 
ly for about twelve hours per day, and by these the water is forced 
into a cistern situated at the west end of Union Place, and elevated 
130 feet above the engine, being placed at the height of 40 feet 
above the street, by which means sufficient elevation is obtained to 
permit the water to be distributed abundantly to all parts of the 
town. The size of this cistern is 50 feet by 30, with a depth of 9 
feet, and it is capable of containing 84,375 gallons. The quan- 
tity of water raised by these engines in twenty-four hours is about 
900,000 gallons, and it is distributed through the town to supply 
both the public wells and private service pipes to the inhabitants, 
through pipes, the aggregate length of which is nearly eleven miles 
and a-half. The number of public wells is at present 92, and there 
are 909 private service pipes. The expense of procuring and main- 
taining this supply is defrayed by an assessment of 9d. per pound 
on the rent of the houses; shops, warehouses, &amp;c. being charged 
4s. annually in place of this. These persons who wish to have a 
supply for their own use are charged additional 6d. per L, 1 of rent. 

The management of the supply of water is vested in the Com- 
missionerg of Police, on whom falls also the care of lighting, pav- 
ing, cleaning, and watching the streets, and for these purposes the 
expense of paving any street for the first time being borne by the 
proprietors of the houses in the street a police assessment is le- 
vied, of 2s, per pound on the rent if above L. 3 and under L. 7, and 
2s. 3d. if above this. The number of pubhc lamps is 1130, of 
which 996 in the principal streets are lighted with gas, the rest 
bemg oil lamps. The number of men employed in cleaninr  he

streets is 40, and there are 47 watchmen employed in patrolHng the 
streets during the night. 

Gas-Lighting. — At an early period in the history of gas light- 
ing, one or two individuals in this city and neighbourhood erected 
small apparatus for the supply of their own establishments ; but 
until the Gas Company was set on foot in 1824, this mode of light- 
ing was resorted to by a small number only, and was regarded by 
most rather as a curious.philosophical toy than as an advantageous 
means of obtaining light. On the first establishment of the Gas 
Company, the preference was given to oil over coal gas, and they 
continued to manufacture oil gas for about four years, which they 
supphed at first at L. 2 per 1000 feet. They found it necessary 
to raise the price to L.2, 10s. but afterwards reduced it to L.2, 5s. ; 
but-the very limited encouragement which they received from the 
public rendered it an unprofitable speculation, and in 1828 they re- 
solved to give up the manufacture of oil gas, and to distribute coal 
gas. This change was necessarily accompanied with considerable 
expense, both from the change of apparatus, and because the laying 
down of larger mains than had been required for the oil gas, be- 
came indispensable. The price at first charged for the coal gas 
was 15s. but it has since been considerably reduced, and is now 10s. ; 
with discounts of from 5 to 25 per cent, according to the quan- 
tity used. Since the introduction of coal gas the success of the 
company has been steadily progressive, and from the increasing de- 
mand, it became necessary, a few years ago, still further to enlarge 
" the size of the mains, which are now 12 inches in diameter. The 
length of iron pipe the smallest size of which is about 2 inches 
diameter laid in the streets, including Old Aberdeen and several 
manufactories on Don side, to which gas has lately been conveyed, 
is about forty-eight miles. 

The coal which is used in these works for the production of gas 
is the best parrot coal, which, reckoning the average of the stock at 
present on hand, costs them about L.l, 8s. per ton laid down at 
the works. At one time they were able to procure the same coal as 
low as 13s. per ton, but in the latter part of 1836, owing to a scar- 
city of this coal, they were under the necessity for a time of usmg 
Wicran coal, which cost them not less than L. 1, Ib's. The parrot 
coat is capable of yielding 6 feet of gas per lb., but in these works 
it is scarcely ever pushed beyond 4| feet, which is worked off m a 

' A considerable extension of the suj.ply of gas has very recently taken place, 
pipes ha",7b en laid, within the last few weeks nearly as far out as tlurd n 
stone on the Invcrury road, for the supply of the populous villages of Cotton and 
Woodside.

four hours charge. The retorts employed are partly iron and part- 
ly of fire-brick, the former cylindrical or kidney-shaped, the latter 
flat, elliptical, or D shaped. The number fitted up is at present 
about sixty-four, some of which are heated by coal and coke, but 
a good many are worked off entirely by the tar of former distilla- 
tions ; and generally about one-half of the retorts are in operation 
at once during the winter, but in summer from four to ten are suf- 
ficient. The gas produced is first subjected to atmospheric cold 
in an extensive series of condensing pipes, and afterwards purified 
by being passed first through a vessel containing lime diffused in 
water, and then through several trays filled with dry lime ; after 
which it passes into a meter, to which Mr Massie, the present su- 
perintendent of the works, has ingeniously adapted a clock, bearing 
a pencil attached to the minute hand, which marks, on a card that 
revolves with the meter, the quantity of gas produced in each hour. 
The gas then passes into the gasometers, whose contents are at 
present about 93,000 feet, but another, capable of holding 61,000, 
is just erected, and almost ready for use. 

The works are conveniently situated in the lower part of the 
town, and the whole of the arrangements are well contrived. The 
Company have hitherto been always careful to employ the best qua- 
lity of coals only, and to this and the intelligence and activity of 
their manager is greatly to be ascribed the high degree of success 
which has attended the speculation ; the gas produced at these 
works being, it is believed, fully equal, if not superior in quality to 
that made in any other part of the kingdom. 

Mr Massie, not content with simply producing and purifyino- eras 
according to the methods usually received, has applied his ingenuity 
to the contrivance of various means for testing the purity and value 
of the gas, with a view of detecting and obviating any occasional 
failure, amongwhich may be noticed an instrument for detecting the 
presence of sulphuretted hydrogen by meansof a jetof gas thrown on 
a revolving disk moistened with a solution of acetate of lead, and 
a contrivance for testing the illuminating power by the number of 
plates of colourless glass of uniform thickness and texture through 
which the light from a flame of a given size can be discerned. 

The consumpt has been gradually increasing since the use of 
oil gas was relinquished, and at present the nightly distribution is 
about 140,000 feet in winter, and about 18,000 feet in summer 
1 he consumers may be thus classed : manufactories and weavino-I

churches, 27 ; schools and lecture-rooms, 50 ; public institutions,

' Brideiccll was erected at a cost of nearly L. 12,000, and open- 
ed in October 1809. It is situated in the centre of a square space 
of ground, measuring nearly two Scotch acres, on the outskirts of 
the town. It contains 109 cells, each 8 feet by 7, with a height . 
of 7 feet 8 inches, besides two infirmaries and eight small sleeping 
apartments adjoining. It is warmed in winter by steam, and the 
whole building is lighted by gas. The governor's house and other 
accommodations are in a building behind the prison, but attached 
to it. The officers employed are a governor, matron, two turn- 
keys, a watchman, and a porter. A chaplain, teacher, and surgeon, 

. also attend regularly. 

The male and female prisoners are kept m distmct parts ot the 

building. . n i , j j 

On the committal of a prisoner, he is stripped and bathed, dres- 
sed in the prison uniform, and conducted to his cell; the regula- 
tions are explained to him, and he is set to such work as he is con- 
sidered to be capable of executing. 

Each prisoner is kept entirely separate from every other, i he 
kinds of work in which the prisoners are employed are, weaving 
linen and shoe girth, picking oakum, making door-mats, teasmg, 
carding, and spinning hair, picking and carding wool, shoemakmg, 
tailor-work, and blacksmith and carpenter-work. A regular ac- 
count is kept of the work done by each, and when his earnings ex- 
ceed his maintenance, &amp;c. one-third of the surplus is given to him 
at liberation, one-third at the end of three months,on producing a 
certificate of his honesty and industry since dismissal, and the re- 
mainder after other six months on a like certificate being produced 
The amount of the prisoners' earnings during the year from 1st 
Sentember 1837 was L.409, being the largest sum, in proportion 
to the number of prisoners, realised in any prison in the kingdom 
during a-year. The hours of labour are in summer from 5 .. m. 
o 8 r M and in winter, from 6 a. m. to 8 p. m., with the nece.- 
arv int";. s for diet. The governor is empowered to punish for 
d bed ence, idleness, &amp;c. by withholding a part of the allowan 
0 food by confinement in a dark cell, by restricting the diet to 
bread a'nd wLr, or by putting in irons; but during the last yeai

out of 281 prisoners, only 71 were punished in any way,— a small 
proportion, considering the character and dispositions of the in- 
mates. 

Every prisoner who can read is supplied with a Bible, and all 
are visited at least once a week by the chaplain, who exhorts, 
catechises, and prays, vith each separately. Those who conduct 
themselves well are allowed to read the Scottish Christian Herald, 
Chambers's Edinburgh Journal, and the volumes of the Kildare 
Street Library. 

The teacher attends for three hours and a-half daily to give in- 
structions in reading, writing, and arithmetic, to the prisoners who 
require them, each in his own cell, and the governor examines, 
and reports their progress monthly to the commissioners. 

The surgeon attends daily, but there is very little sickness in 
the establishment. Only four prisoners have died in the house 
since it was opened. Of these two were ill when committed, and 
lived only a few days; one was liable to epilepsy, and was found 
dead in his cell in the morning ; and the fourth was a woman 
about ninety years of age, who had passed the greater part of the 
last twenty years of her life in prison. The expenses of the es- 
tablishment are defrayed by an assessment on the heritors of the' 
city and county, half being borne by each. The amount collect- 
ed has been for some years L. 900; of which about L. 600 are 
required for the annual expenses, the remainder being applied to 
the reduction of the debt, whose present amount is L. 4300. ■ 

In consequence of the majority of the prisoners being confined 
for short periods, little permanent improvement of their morals 
can be expected; for that system of discipline must indeed be adl 
mirable, which could in thirty or sixty days eradicate bad habits 
and implant good ones ; nevertheless, there can be no doubt, that 
the discipline of Bridewell has had a salutary effect on many of 
those who have been committed, in the first instance, for long pe- 
'••ods, as only a small proportion of these have returned a second 
time and some of them are known to be now engaged in honest 
employment. 

It is not possible to say to what extent the fear of this prison 
aas operated on the criminal population of the district; but it is 
'vorthy of remark that, although the general population is rapidly 
ncreasing, the number of criminals is apparently rather decreasing

The following statement will give some idea of the state of edu- 
cation, &amp;c. of the persons generally committed to the Bridewell : 
During the year from 1st January to 31st December 1838, the 
number of individuals committed was 252 ; of which were recom- 
mitments, 32 ; making the number committed for the first time, 
20 Of these 220, there were 42 who could not read, 76 could 
reld with difficulty, and 102 could read easily ; 124 could not 
write, 82 could write a little, and 14 could write easily ; 83 attend- 
ed no place of worship, 103 attended church occasionally, and 34 
had been in the habit of attending regularly. 67 were natives of 
the town of Aberdeen ; 40 of the county of Aberdeen ; 40 of the 
counties north of Aberdeen ; 48 of the counties south of Aberdeen ; 
14 of England ; 9 of Ireland ; and 2 were foreigners. 

Of the whole 252 commitments, there were attributed to intoxi- 
cation, 131 ; idleness and bad company, 78; want, 10 ; uncertain, 

denied their guilt, &amp;c. 33. , . , , j „ 

prison —The old prison, which was situated in the tower under 
the steeple in Castle Street, was in every respect mismted to its 
object, being neither properly ventilated, sufficiently capacious, 
nor secure. In 1 829, the foundation of a new prison was laid im- 
mediately behind the Court-house, and it was first occupied in 
JuIy 1831. It contains sixty cells and ten day-rooms, one ot 
which is appropriated for debtors ; the other nine have lately been 
converted into work-rooms. There are six yards withm the pre- 
cincts of the prison, four of which are used by the male prisoners, , 
and one by the females, the remaining one being connected with 

the debtors' room. 

The criminal prisoners are not permitted to hold any intercourse 
with each other, and they are kept apart as much as possible, i hey 
are all employed, tried as well as untried, in such wois as pick- 
ing oakum weaving, tailor-work, &amp;c., and for the females knitting 
and sewing, and an account is kept of the produce of their labour 
Ld their 'earnings are giVen to them on leaving the prison T y 
. are allowed access to the yard one at a time, for about two hours 
each, daily.

A teacher attends in the prison daily from 10 a. m. to 1 p. m. 
and the chaplain visits five times in the week, exhorting, catechis- 
ing, and praying with each prisoner separately. The female pri- 
soners, who are under the care of a female assistant to the jailer, 
are also visited every lawful day, except Saturday, by the mem- 
bers of the " Ladies' Association for promoting the Reformation of 
Destitute Females." 

The diet of the prisoners is of the plainest kind, but wholesome 
and in sufficient quantity ; and the introduction of every kind of 
luxury into the prison is strictly prohibited. 

Untried prisoners are permitted to be visited by their relatives 
in the presence of the keeper of the prison, once a week, but after 
conviction this liberty is allowed only once a month. 

The expense of maintaining the prisoners, and of keeping up 
the necessary establishment, as well as the repairs of the building, 
is defrayed out of the rogue money ; the city and county bearing 
each a share proportioned to the number of prisoners from each. 

The debtors are not subjected to the same restrictions as the 
criminal prisoners, being permitted the free use of the yard and 
day-room of their ward from 6 a. m. to 9 p. m. daily. 

The average number of prisoners during 1838 was about 57; 
the greatest number at one time being 86, and the smallest, 39. 

The gross expenses including salaries, repairs, &amp;c. of the es- 
tablishment was, during the year 1836, L.670; 1837, L. 611; 1838, 
L. 901. No sufficient return has been obtained of the numberof com- 
mitments, unless for the last year, when they were, males, 386 ; fe- 
males, 124 : total, 509. By a return made for one year previous 
to August 1838, it appears that there were in prison during that 
period.

Medical Society. -In the year 1789, twelve young men, 'ho 
were engaged in the study of medicine in Aberdeen formed them- 
selves into a society for their mutual improvement, by meetmg o 
discuss questions connected with medical science. Ot these only 
four are now alive, viz. Sir James M'Grigor, Bart the present ac- 
tive and enlightened Director-General of the Med.cal Department 
of the Army ; Dr John Grant, who has been or some years resi- 
dent at Forres ; Dr Colin Allan, at present settled m Nova Scotia , 
and Dr James' Moir, who has been long established as a practi- 
tioner in Aberdeen. u ii oPthp 
Their meetings were, for a good many years, held tn one of the 
class-rooms of Marischal College, and subsequently m apartments 
it d for the purpose; and the additions made Jo their numbers 
by the accession of new members, both increased t useu Ine 
the society and testified the advantages that were derived from t e 
discussions and examinations held at their meetmgs. In 1791, the 
mmencementwasmadeofa library devoted to medical htera- 
u" and by donations from the members and their friends, as well 
a by le purchase from time to time of such works as their funds 
e ab  hem to procure, the collection gradually increased so tha 
it became necessary, in order to protect their books, as well as that 
t:,"L. convenient apartments to hold their meetings in, 
0 endefvour to obtain the means of erectmg a house for the pui- 
poses o the society. A subscription for this purpose was accord- 

commenced in 1809, and by the unremitted exertions of S 
James M'Grigor, very considerable additions were -ade o this 
fund durinc. tl subsequent years. It was not, however, till 18 8 
fhat the society found themselves in a condition to undertake the 
wol of erectiJg the Medical Hall in King Street, which was com- 
r 'ed u 1 820,\nd has been since that time occupied by the meet- 
• flp soc etv, and the library and museum belonging to it.

sional information — and the other consisting of students of medi- 
cine, who hold weekly meetings for mutual examination and the 
discussion of medical questions. 

The number on the roll of the ordinary members is at present 
44, and the number of junior members is 10  There are, besides, 
a few honorary members — distinguished men, foreigners and others, 
principally, though not exclusively, of the medical profession. 

The number of volumes in the society's library, to which the 
members have every facility of access, is about 3000, and there 
was formed, a few years ago, a collection of valuable works of refe- 
rence, &amp;c. which the members may consult at the society's hall, but 
which are not permitted to be lent out. A regulation has lately 
been introduced by which the library has been rendered accessible, 
under certain restrictions, to students not attending the meetings 
of the society. 

The society's museum is not as yet of any great extent, but 
it contains some valuable anatomical and morbid preparations, as 
well as a good many specimens in various departments of natural 
history. 

Medical Classes. — Besides the medical lectures instituted within 
the last twenty years in connection with the universities, the ac- 
count of which is omitted here as being more properly to be taken 
in along with the account of these bodies, there have been others 
lately set on foot by various individuals desirous of advancing the 
cause of medical education in Aberdeen. These have been at- 
tended with a degree of success probably as great as their pro- 
jectors anticipated, though, of course, the limited number of stu 
dents at Aberdeen has been a bar to any splendid success on the 
part of either them or the university lecturers.

with the universities were delivered last season : —

• At the time when the society was instituted, and for many years after, there were 
no medical classes m Aberdeen, and the Medical Society furnished almost the only 
means by which the students could with advantage prosecute their studies, by adopting 
asystem of mutual instruction. Of late years, in consequence of the establishment of

Infirmary.— kxnox\g the Institutions for the relief of the sick poor, 
the first and most important is the Infirmary, which was establish- 
ed by a subscription begun in the year 1739, in consequence of a 
proposal to that effect made by the magistrate.s, who granted a 
sum of about L. 36 annually towards its support, and also gave a 
plot of ground for its site. The plan adopted was one which ad- 
mitted of being executed in parts, and the central portion, capable 
of acc-ommodating40patients, was erected in 1 740-41, atan expense 
of L 584. The funds subscribed being exhausted in the building, 
« the directors were obliged, from the very first, to borrow money 
for furnishing the house, and fitting up the apartments properly 
for the reception of patients." H In the year 1746, the patients were 
displaced, and the Infirmary was filled during the greater part ot 
the vear with sick and wounded soldiers belonging to the army un- 
der ihe command of the Duke of Cumberland. This interruption 
to the charity having ceased, and the number of applicants for re- 
ception continually increasing, funds were gradually provided by 
the donations of various individuals, collections in the neighbour- 
ing parishes, and bequests, and in the year 1753, it was deter- 
mined to build the east wing of the house, which was done at an 
expense of L. 495, and by this means room was obtained for 16 
additional patients, and "various other accommodations; and m 
1760, the west wing, capable of receiving 32 patients, was added, 
at an expense of L.477. No further addition of much conse- 
quence was made until the year 1820, when two new wards, ca- 
pable of accommodating 22 cases, were added, the cost of which 
was L. 583, for the reception of fever patients, which, of course, 
permitted the wards previously used as fever wards, to be added 
to the apartments destined for the reception of ordinary cases. 
But, in 1833, the managers finding a necessity for increased ac-

commodations, both for fevers and other complaints, resolved on 
erecting a new building on an enlarged scale, and with the various 
improvements in its construction, which have been suggested by 
experience and the judgment of those conversant with the requi- 
sites of hospitals ; and in the course of the next year, the west 
wing of the new house was erected, at an expense of L. 5300. 
Sixty beds were thus obtained for the reception of fever cases. In 
pursuance of the plan, a contract was entered into in the latter part 
of the year 1835 for the completion of the building, at an expense 
of L. 8500. The principal part of this erection is now finished, 
and has been occupied for several months. The arrangements 
cannot be completely carried out until certain buildings be erected 
in the rear of the house, on the site of the old building; but when 
this is accomplished, the whole number of patients that may be 
received into the bouse will be 210. The wards are of large size, 
lofty and well aired, in number twenty, with eleven smaller apart- 
ments for the reception of cases requiring to be treated separately, 
and with every convenience that is to be found in the most ap- 
proved hospitals in the island. 

When, by the liberality of the public, and by means of nume- 
rous donations and bequests, the managers of the Infirmary found 
themselves not merely possessed of the funds necessary for carry- 
ing on the institution from year to year, but able to accumulate a 
surplus to meet future exigencies, it became of importance that 
this property should be secured by giving a permanent character 
to the body in which it was vested. Accordingly, in 1773, a 
Crown charter was obtained, by which certain of. the magistrates, 
the Professor of Medicine in Marischal College, and the Modera- 
tor of the Synod of Aberdeen, all for the time being, together 
with individual donors to the extent of L. 50, and persons named 
by those bequeathing a like sum, were appointed to be the direc- 
tors, to whom were added, as annual directors, donors to the ex- 
tent of L. 5, artd fourteen persons to be chosen out of the various 
bodies and classes of inhabitants in Aberdeen, according to a 
scheme laid down in the charter. 

The details of the management of this institution are, in accord- 
ance with a resolution of date 28th November 1821, entrusted to a 
committee of sixteen chosen annually, which divides itself into four 
sub-committees, each of which takes the duties for three months 
in rotation. These sub-committees hold weekly meetings, and re- 
port monthly to the committee, whose proceedings are laid before 

general body of managers at their quarterly meetings. Spe-

sion renders them necessary.

The medical officers of the Infirmary are 5 in number, viz. 2 
physicians, 2 surgeons, and a house-surgeon, who is resident. 
There is also an apothecary employed to compound the medicmes 
prescribed, and, since the removal of the establishment into the 
new house, two wards have been appropriated to the reception of 
ophthalmic cases, and placed under the charge of the surgeon at- 
tached to an eye institution in town. 

By a recent resolution of the managers, one of the physicians 
and one of the surgeons are appointed to deliver courses of lec- 
tures on Clinical Medicine and Surgery to the students attending 
the hospital, and from the number of cases annually treated in the 
institution, it has become of much importance, as an auxdiary, to 
the school of medicine lately established here by the authority ot 
the Universities, and by the exertions of several private indivi- 
duals The number of students frequenting the wards of the 
Aberdeen Infirmary has for many years been considerable, and as 
a certificate of attendance on its practice is received by the various 
public boards connected with the service of the country, there is 
evefy probability, that, while the opportunities and advantages pre- 
sented to students by Aberdeen remain undiminished, there will 
be no material or permanent diminution in the number of students. 
During the last two years a considerable falling off has been expe- 
rienced, but neither is Aberdeen the only medical school where 
this has taken place, nor is the medical profession the only one m 
which the number of entrants has been of late considerably di- 

""'lltsthown by the table, that, during the last year, the number 
of out-patients has been considerably diminished; and there is a 
probability that, in future years, it will be still -'- f-J/" 
Lnt having been, in the course of the last year, entered n o by 
the managers of the Infirmary, who had become possessed, 
trustees, of a fund left by the late Mr Burnett of Dens, for the

supply of medicines and medical attendance to such of the sick 
poor of Aberdeen and the suburbs thereof as are not fit objects to 
be received into the Infirmary." It was agreed that this money 
should be paid over to the funds of the General Dispensary, on 
condition of that institution affording the necessary attendance 
and medicines to those persons belonging to the town a d suburbs 
who used to be supplied as out-patients at the Infirmary. Those 
persons who reside in the country are still received and attended, 
as formerly, as out-patients. 

Dispensaries. — The practice of giving advice and medicines at 
the Infirmary to persons who could not be received into the house 
necessarily began almost from the very commencement of that in- 
stitution, and it was probably not very long after, that persons be- 
gan to be received as out-patients who had no wish to be admit- 
ted. No separate account, however, of these cases appears to have 
been kept until the year 1764, when the number of out-patients was 
1332, and from that time they went on increasing, and thus en- 
tailing a heavy additional duty on the medical attendants, and 
causing a considerable expense to the house. 

In 1781, in consequence of a memorial presented to the ma- 
nagers of the Infirmary, they resolved to institute a Dispensary 
in connection with the Infirmary, — at first as an experiment for 
one year, but afterwards they continued it by an annual vote, — a 
part of the expense being borne by the Infirmary, and the rest de- 
frayed by subscriptions. This source of income having declined, 
however, the new institution became more burdensome to the In- 
firmary, and it was deemed necessary to take steps for reviving the 
interest of the public in the Dispensary by making collections at 
churches, &amp;c., and, at the same time, to withdraw the aid which it 
had hitherto received from the funds of the Infirmary. In 1788, 
the managers of the Infirmary agreed to defray the expense of the 
medicines used in the Dispensary, provided the sum necessary to 
meet the salary of the physician were raised by subscription ; but 
two years after, they again deemed it necessary to disunite the Dis- 
pensary from the Infirmary altogether. Subsequently to this time, 
as the population of the town increased, other institutions, with 
the same benevolent design of providing advice and medicines for 
the sick poor at their own houses, were successively established, to 
the number of five,— three of which embraced the city generally, 
while the other two were chiefly intended for the districts of Fut- 
tie and Gilcomston. 
In 1823, these five were incorporated into one, called the Ge- 



90 ABEHDEENSIIIUE. 

neral Dispensary ; the five medical men previously attending con 
tinued to officiate, and, in fact, the only changes consisted in the ; 
establishment of a single depot of medicines, the election of a ' 
single set of managers, and the allotment of the town and suburbs 
into five districts, of which one was assigned to each of the medi- 
cal attendants ; lately a sixth medical attendant has been added, 
and a district has been assigned to him by a new division of the 
town. 

For several years, there was a midwife attached to each district, 
to whom was assigned the care of all ordinary cases, for which a 
small allowance was made according to the number of cases, the 
medical attendants giving their assistance when cases of difficulty 
occurred ; but in 1834, the low state of the funds compelled the 
managers to discontinue the allowance, and since that time the 
medical attendants have taken charge of all the midwifery cases 
applying at the institution, which, however, have been of late com- 
paratively few. 

In 1831, the small-pox being very prevalent in Aberdeen, it 
appeared to the medical attendants of the dispensary, that in vi- 
siting among the poor, they possessed peculiar facilities for en- 
couraging among them the practice of vaccinating their children, 
which was too generally neglected. .It was therefore resolved to 
give attendance weekly at the dispensary for the purpose of vac- 
cinating children. 

Mr John Burnett had by his will, dated 1783, bequeathed a 
sum of money to be applied for the prevention of small-pox, and 
on the promulgation of Dr Jenner's discovery, this sum was ap- 
propriated to defray the expense of an institution for vaccination. 
For a good many years, the numbers who were benefited by this 
institut;ion were considerable, but in consequence partly of the in- 
creasing prevalence of the custom of midwives vaccinating the 
children at whose birth they had assisted, and partly of the ne- 
gligence of parents to avail themselves of the means of avoiding 
a disease whose ravages were become much less formidable than 
they had formerly been, the Vaccine Institution declined very 
much, so that at the time when the medical attendants of the 
General Dispensary began to vaccinate, the office of the Vac- 
cinator had become little better than a sinecure, and medical men 
often experienced great inconvenience from the inadequate supply 
of lymph that could be obtained at the Vaccine Institution. These 
circumstances, and the success which had attended the attempt to 



ABERDEEN. 



91 



induce parents to bring their children for vaccination to the Dis- 
pensary, led to a proposal to incorporate the two institutions to- 
gether, and this was accordingly done in 1837, by the appoint- 
ment of the Vaccinator as one of the medical attendants of the 
Dispensary, having charge of a district of the town in addition to 
his duties as Vaccinator. The number of children vaccinated at 
the institution previous to its junction with the General Dispen- 
sary was 6543. 

The only permanent income which the General Dispensary 
possesses, except the annual income arising from Mr Burnett's 
bequest which continues to be received by the Vaccinator as his 
salary, is the interest of a bequest of L. 400 by the late Mr J. 
Cushnie, which was left in 1793 to the two Dispensaries at that 
time existing in Aberdeen. Excepting this, the whole support of 
the institution rests on voluntary subscriptions, and an occasional 
collection at some of the churches. Subsequently to the esta- 
blishment of the General Dispensary, two others have been set on 
foot in Aberdeen. One in the lower part of the town, whose ob- 
ject is principally to provide speedy assistance in the numerous 
accidents which happen on board the ships and in the various 
works about the harbour, and the other in the western part of the 
town, and altogether beyond the limits of the parish. The ex- 
penses of both of these are borne entirely by voluntary contribu- 
tions, and they amount together to about L.60 annually. 

The subjoined table shows the income, expenditure, and num- 
ber of patients treated by all the institutions of this sort in town

Lunatic Asi/hm.~ Connected with the Infirmary of Aberdeen, 
m so far as it is under the management of the same body of di- 
rectors, IS the asylum for the reception of lunatics— an institution 
which was begun in the year 1799. Previous to that time there 
was no attention paid to the comforts of this unfortunate class in 
Aberdeen, and but very little provision made for their safety ; the 
only accommodations provided being a few miserable cells on the

ground floor of the Poor's Hospital, and one or two equally 
wretched among the cellars of the Inttrmary. In the year just nnen- 
tioned, a building was erected by subscription, capable of receiving 
about 50 patients, on a site nearly a mile out of town. The ex- 
pense of this, including that of the ground, was L.a484, of which 
the magistrates, as trustees of a bequest by Bailie Cargill, con- 
tributed L. 1130, on condition of having right to admit 10 pauper 
patients, gratis, to the institution. In 1819, in consequence of a 
great deficiency of accommodation having been experienced, and 
especially the impossibility of properly classifying the patients, 
either according to the varieties of their disorder or their station 
in life, a piece of ground adjoining to the asylum was purchased, 
and an additional building erected on it at an expense of L. 13,135, 
which the managers were enabled to defray by the munificent be- 
quest of L. 10,000 from the late John Forbes of New. In this 
building about 70 additional patients can be accommodated, and 
the general attention which had in the interval been paid to the 
construction and arrangement of lunatic asylums, enabled the ma- 
nagers to avail themselves of many improvements, by which the 
comfort and restoration of the patients might be promoted. 

In 1836, the number of patients having continually increased, 
and a considerable proportion of them being in a situation which 
rendered them capable of being employed, with benefit to them- 
selves in out- door work of various kinds, for which there had 
hitherto been very httle facility, a portion of ground adjoining, 
of the extent of about 11 acres, was purchased at tbe price of 
L. 3000, which, being laid out in various kinds of useful crops, &amp;c. 
affords employment to a good number of the patients ; and some 
additional apartments have been erected on this ground with work- 
shops, &amp;c. Considerable benefit having been found to arise from 
the regular performance of divine service in the asylum, which Jor 
some years past has been done twice every Sabbath day, and is 
generally attended by upwards of half the patients in the house, 
it is intended that a chapel shall be erected soon in a suitable 
situation. It used to be remarked, that Sabbath was commonly 
a very troublesome day, in consequence of the cessation of the 
usual occupations of the patients, no object of interest being pre- 
sented to them instead ; but since the establishment of the practice 
of having worship regularly twice on that day, the patients are 
generally as quiet on Sabbath as any other day of the week.

devise the means of employing actively all the inmates who are 
capable of engaging in any sort of work, and the males, besides 
the out-door work which the late acquisition of additional ground 
has given opportunity for, are employed in such other work about 
the house as they can assist the servants in ; and it is hoped that 
in a short time the introduction of basket -making, weaving, &amp;c. 
may be effected with advantage. The females are employed' in 
assisting the servants, and in sewing, knitting, spinning, &amp;c. 

The details of the management of this institution are entrusted 
to the same committee annually appointed, who superintend the 
Infirmary, and the general body of managers meet twice a-yeai 
specially for the business of the asylum, besides holding occasional 
meetings when requisite. The funds of this institution having 
been derived entirely from voluntary subscriptions and bequests, 
the heavy expenses incurred in the purchase of ground, and the 
erection of the buildings, have hitherto rendered the managers un- 
able to make the rates of board at which patients are received, so 
low as they would have wished, especially in regard to the class of 
paupers, 10 of whom, as already mentioned, are maintained gratis 
in terms of the agreement with the magistrates on commencing 
the institution. Another is received without board in terms of a 
bequest by the late Mr Innes of Balnacraig. Other paupers 
coming from parishes within the county of Aberdeen are received 
at L. 15 per annum. Paupers from other places pay 8s. 6d. per 
week, and the higher rates are adjusted according to the accom- 
modations, &amp;c. required by the friends of the patient.

Incorporations.— It is not necessary to inquire into the origin of 
those societies among craftsmen, which are unquestionably of con- 
siderable antiquity, and which have given rise ultimately to the 
various incorporations in burghs protected by certain statutes and 
enjoying certain privileges. The corporations of Aberdeen at the 
earliest period of which correct information can be obtained, were 
the Litsters, the Hammermen, the 'J'ailors,. the Skinners, the 



94 A15ERDKENSH1RE. 

Cordwainers, the Fleshers, the Barbers, the Wrights, including 
the Coopers and Masons, and the Bakers. It is uncertain at 
what period these corporations were formed into a jomt society. 
The first mention of the deacon-convener is in 1587, when the 
person holding this office was appointed, along with others, to ar- 
bitrate between the craftsmen and the burgesses. 

About the year 1610, the Joint Society of Incorporated Trades 
instituted a fund for the rehef of decayed members; and in 1632, 
Dr Guild, one of the ministers of Aberdeen, founded an hospital 
for poor artificers, in the place formerly occupied by the monks of 
the Holy Trinity. The corporations of Hammermen, Bakers, 
Tailors Wrights, Cordwainers, Weavers, and Fleshers contribut- 
ed to the establishment and support of this hospital. The objects 
of rehef are not now, as formerly, received into the Trades Hos- 
pital, but relieved as out-pensioners, and the building is used for 
the purposes of meetings of the trades, and as a school for the 
children of tradesmen of both sexes. 

The fund for distribution has, by various bequests, and by the 
rise in value of land purchased in the close vicinity of the town, 
increased considerably, so as to enable them, of late years, to dis- 
tribute about L. 600 annually, among about 130 decayed members. 

By the deed of Dr Guild, who was one of the prmcipal lound- 
ers of this fund, « None shall be admitted to its benefit but those 
who shall be of good fame, and not reduced to poverty by their 
own vice or drunkenness or intemperance ; and therefore that none 
receive the fruits of the said mortification but good, holy, and so- 

Twidow's Fund was instituted in 1771, a small payment from 
entrant members being reserved for this purpose   he a 
proceeds of this fund now yield L. 5 each to about 150 widows 

In 1816, a supplementary Widow's Fund was projected by 
Convener John Leshe ; and in 1828, it had so far accumulated as 
to be available, and since that time the proceeds of it have been 

the general funds of the trades for dis- 
tribuLnmounted to L. 1 102, whereof L. 572 were distributed to 
it uperannuated members; L. 490 were apportioned .nog 
150 widows ; and L. 40 were paid as bursaries to students at Ma-

revenues, appropriated to the relief of decayed members, widows, 
and orphans immediately connected with it. 

These funds, during the year 1837, amounted to L. 2622, which 
were distributed according to rates fixed by each corporation in- 
dependently of the others, among 154 superannuated members, 
150 widows, the same who received the benefit of the general 
fund and of the widows' funds, and 156 orphans.

Society of Advocates. — We find the practitioners of the law in 
Aberdeen recognized by the title of" Advocati," as early as 1633, 
and under that title they received a charter from the Crown in 
1774, and again another of a more extensive nature in 1799, in 
which they are styled, ' the President and Society of Advocates 
in Aberdeen." 

The chief object of the society is to maintain, by the contribu- 
tions of its members, a fund for the purpose of giving allowances 
to indigent members, and to the widows, orphans, and nearest re- 
latives of deceased members. This fund was instituted in 1685 ; 
the allowances which they have been able' to give from it have' 
been at different times augmented, but it is believed that they 
have never yet found it necessary to diminish the rate. At pre- 
sent the annual allowance to a widow is about L. 40. The So- 
ciety also possesses a valuable law-library, which is kept up by the 
contributions of the members, and by fees from entrant appren- 
tices. This library is open to the free use of all the members of 
the Society. It contains about 1900 volumes, and was begun to 
be collected in 1786. 

The Society has lately erected a spacious Hall for the purpose 
ot their meetings, with suitable accommodations for their library, 
&amp;c. in Union Street. 

Society of Shipmasters.~Th\s association was formed in 1598 
and was chartered in 1600, with a right to levy a tax on all ship- 
pmg entering the port, but this right was annulled in 1784. The 



96 ABEliDEENSHIRE. 

Society was re-chartered in 1801, by the title of " the President 
and Society of Shipmasters of Aberdeen." Their funds, which  
formerly arose from the tax which they were entitled to levy, and 
which now are derived from the contributions of the members, are 
applicable to the purpose of pensioning indigent members, and 
the widows and orphans of deceased members, and the sum distri- 
buted by them is above L. 600 annually, in allowances varying from 

L. 16 to L. 20. , -1 J f 

Post OfRce.-Yov a good many years, the south mail used to 
arrive in Aberdeen at 6 a. M., and the various north and inland 
mails fmm half-past 12 to 2 p.m., and the hours for despatching the 
south mail was 50 minutes past 2 p. m. ; the others being made 
up partly at 7 and partly at 8 a. M. 

In consequence, however, of the acceleration of the mails 
through England by means of the railroads, &amp;c. various alterations 
.have been introduced since November 1837. There are now two 
mails daily from Edinburgh, the one arriving at a fl'V'' 
A M. and the other at 6 p.m., and the hours of despatch for the south 
a;e at present quarter-past 7 a. m. and half-past 3 p. m. The va- 
rious country mails arrive about an hour previous to the afternoon 
despatch of the south mail, and they are despatched at 7 a. m., and 
to one or two places also at 10 p. m. 

The increase in the size and trade of the city has of course 
been attended with a corresponding increase m the revenue and 
business of the Post Office. By the statement of the Potmaster 
the Post Office revenue of Aberdeen has been for a considerable 
number of years steadily on the increase, and is at present from 
L. 9500 to L. 10,000. . 

Stamps.-'Yhe amount of bill stamps annually made use of m 
the Aberdeen district, which comprehends Aberdeen and K.nar 
dineshires, on an average of the last three years, is L. 49o5. 1 
lo nt 0 stamp duties collected in the district in the same ave- 
Te of three years is L.18,802 ; while the unstamped duties levied 
nnnuallv have on the same average amounted to U » i.-i- . 

sl'clAe.-As maybe supposed, the number of these is 
liable to great fluctuation, some being started as a speculation on

Banks. — A bank on a small scale was established in Aberdeen 
in 1752, but it did not succeed, and was soon given up. Soon 
after, the Thistle Bank of Glasgow opened an agency here, and 
received great support. In 1767, another attempt was made to 
establish a bank in this city, by the formation of the " Banking 
Company in Aberdeen," with a capital of L. 72,000. At first it 
met with great opposition from the Glasgow agency, but ultimate- 
ly it drove the Thistle Bank from the field, and since that time has 
continued to experience a degree of prosperity unequalled by any 
similar establishment, in so much that an originalshareof the stock, 
for which L. 150 was paid, sells now for about L.3000. 

It may be worth notice here that this bank had adopted the plan 
of using paper for their notes, bearing in watermark a waved line, 
and the amount of the note expressed in words, along with the de- 
signation of the company ; but about forty years ago, a gentleman 
connected with this part of the country brought this paper under 
the notice of the Bank of England, in consequence of which they 
adopted it, and procured an act of Parliament to be passed prohi- 
biting the use of paper so marked by any provincial bank. 

In 1788, the " Commercial Bank of Aberdeen" was established, 
which experienced on the whole considerable success, but was ulti- 
mately given up in 1833 in favour of the National Bank of Scot- 
land, whose agency here is doing a good deal of business. 

In 1826, the " Aberdeen Town and County Bank" was project- 
ed with a paid up capital of above L. 100,000, and it is amply 
proved that the increasing wants of the commercial community re- 
quired such an addition to the banking establishment, by the fact 
that the share for which L.75 was paid, now sells for L. 145. 

The » North of Scotland Banking Company" was instituted in 
1836, with a paid up capital of L. 200,000. The partners in this 
concern are numerous, and it has experienced great success. 

All of these establishments appear to be conducted with great 
propriety and liberality, and they have in a very material degree 
benefited the city as well as the surrounding country, in various 
parts of which they have established agencies. 

The Bank of Scotland, the Commercial Bank of Scotland, the 
ntish Linen Company, and, as already noticed, the National Bank 
Scotland, have thriving branches in Aberdeen, some of them for 
many years past.

Savings Bank.-ln the year 1815, the judicious and benevolent 
plan of the Rev. Dr Duncan of Ruthwell, by which labourers and 
others may be enabled to lay up their small savmgs n. security 
and to receive interest on them, was introduced m Aberdeen, and 
the regulations under which the savings bank was estabhshed were, 
that sms from 2s. to L.5 should be taken m every  
tween 9 and 10 o'clock ; that interest at the rate of 5 per cent, 
should be allowed on sums exceeding L.l, excludmg, however, 
any odd shillings and pence, after they had been deposited for one 
"onth; that thbank should not hold more thaiV L 30 from any one 
depositor; and that the whole or any part of the deposit might be 
withdraw at any time on giving a week's notice. Twentyjni 
gentlemen undertook the office of directors, attending two at a time 
for a month in rotation, to receive and give out the money ; and at 
first the necessary expenses were defrayed by subscnptions obtain- 
ed among the inhabitants. The surplus interests of the odd sums 
on the accounts soon enabled the directors to carry on the esta- 
blishment without a continuance of the subscriptions, and this was 
further facilitated by a fortunate purchase of 3 per cents, made by 
the directors a few years after, in consequence of which the auxili- 
ary fund was at once increased to nearly L. 1200. 

In the infancy of the institution, it was greatly indebted to the h- 
berality of the Aberdeen Banking Company, who for several year 
allowed 5 per cent, interest on the sums lodged m that bank by 
Ihe savings bank. Afterwards the rate of interest having been re- 
duced generally, and the savings bank being fully established, and 
its advantages sufficiently appreciated by those for whose benefit it 
was intended, this favour became no longer necessary, and conse- 
nuentlv the rate of interest allowed to depositors has since theu 
fluctuated; at present it is 3| per cent., having been recently ad- 
vanced from 3. The funds of the bank are vested in bonds and 
other heritable securities, and an idea may be formed of the benefits 
nrisinff from this institution, and the confidence reposed in it by the 
iabouHngclassesfromthefollowingtableofthenumberofdeposvtors, 

and the amount ojsh dositejth nce yea83.

The Ily improper advantage which, as far as is known has been 
.t any time taken of this bank is, that occasionally societies hav 
le;Jited their funds with it, dividmg them "to small sun., v- 
have been deposited in the names of different individuals. Thi. the 



ABERDEEN. 99 

directors have endeavoured to discourage, but it has not always 
been in their power to discover it in time to prevent it. A great 
inconvenience had been felt from the number of depositors, 
rendering it impossible to transact the weekly business without 
causing a loss of time to the applicants and to the directors, that 
could be ill spared from their other avocations ; and to remedy this 
a set of premises has recently been fitted up, the office was pre- 
viously in the office of the United Fund, where attendance is 
given at 9 a. m., and 7 p. m,, on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. 
The expense of conducting the business will be thus considerably 
increased ; but the state of the auxiliary fund is such as to enable 
the directors to meet it without difficulty, and without any neces- 
sity of reducing the interest to depositors. 

No savings bank on the national plan has yet been established 
in Aberdeen. It has been proposed to do so, but the advantages 
possessed by the present one are so fully appreciated by the depo- 
sitors, that there is no reason to suppose that it would be mate- 
rially affected by this should it take place. 

Insurance Offices.~ln the year ISOI, a company was formed in 
Aberdeen for msurance against damage by fire, which for a time 
was carried on successfully, but after continuing for about thirteen 
years, it was dissolved, it being found that the principal business 
of this kind continued to be engrossed by the agencies of various 
companies, both English and Scotch. 

About 1803, a company for insuring lives and granting annuities 
was formed, and seemed likely to prove profitable, but the part- 
ners probably imperfectly acquainted with the principles on which 
such a concern should be based became alarmed apparently with- 
out sufficient grounds, and abandoned the speculation after it had 
been continued about ten years. 

In 1817, a Marine Insurance Company was set on foot, but it 
was unsuccessful, and was abandoned in a few vears after the loss 
of the greater part or the whole of its capital. " 
Notwithstanding the fate of all these companies, in 1826 the

however, they were unsuccessful, and the paper is accordingly 
merely a Conservative journal, which in Church politics favours 
the moderate party. Its weekly circulation is about 900. At first 
it was published on Saturday, but, in consequence of recent changes 
in the time of arrival of the mails, it has for some months past been 
published on Friday morning in town, a second edition being publish- 
ed in the evening for country circulation, embracing the intelligence 
that used formerly to be brought by the mail of Saturday morning. 

Public Lih-aries. — Besides the libraries belonging to the Uni- 
versity, the School of Divinity, the Medical Society, the Society 
of Advocates, and the Mechanics' Institution, there are several 
subscription Hbraries in Aberdeen, the principal of which are those 
belonging to Messrs A. Brown and Co., D. Wylie and Son, and 
W. Russell. 

The number of volumes contained in these libraries may be 
about 10,000 or 12,000; they are chiefly in the lighter depart- 
ments of literature, but there are many also of more permanent 
interest, and of a more important character. 

The terms of subscription vary from 15s. to L. 1, lis. 6d. per 
annum, according to the number of volumes borrowed at a time, 
and, generally speaking, these libraries are tolerably well supplied 
with the new pubhcations, at least with those by authors whose 
reputation is already established : in regard to works of less ge- 
neral interest, either as respects their subject, or the name of their 
author, it cannot be supposed that the proprietors of such libraries 
should be desirous of accumulating them'on their shelves ; and, 
indeed, there is often great difficulty in getting a sight of them in 
any other way than by purchasing them, for the booksellers in 
Aberdeen do not often choose to incur the risk of ordering books 
that are not already in some degree regarded as standard works, 
unless m consequence of receiving an order for them from an in- 
tending purchaser. 

Markets.— Theve is a weekly market on Thursdays for meal, 
and on Fridays for grain, butcher-meat, and other provisions. 
Within the last few years several butchers' shops have been opened 
m different parts of the town, where a supply of meat may be ob- 
tained on any day of the week. 

There is a market of fish daily, unless in tempestuous weather ; 
ana a supply of cured fish, including the well known « Findon 
haddocks," may be had daily. 

A market for the sale of liuen is held in the Green on the last 



102 ABERDKENSHIRE. 

Wednesday of April, and a wool market is held there in the last 
week of June, and the first two weeks of July, on Thursday and 

Friday. , , 

The timber-market, for the sale of tubs and other wooden ar- 
tides, is held in the Castle Street on the last Wednesday m August. 

The feeing-market for the hiring of farm-servaiits is held in the 
vicinity of the meal-market at Aberdeen, on the second Friday of 
May and November. 

Besides these markets held in Aberdeen, there are several mar- 
kets for horses and cattle, held in the close vicinity of the town, 
as follows : 1. At bridge of Don, on the first Tuesday of each  
month; 2. at Mannofield, on the Dee side road, on the second i 
Monday of each month; 3. at Ruthrieston, near the Bridge of 
Dee, on the third Monday of each month ; 4. at Old Aberdeen, 
on the last Thursday of April, and on the Wednesday after the 
last Tuesday of October. 

Inns and Jlehouses.-Theve are in Aberdeen no less than 193 
inn-keepers and vintners, including six principal inns, viz the 
Royal Hotel, the Union Hotel, and the Aberdeen Hotel in Union 
Street, the Lemon Tree, in the Huxter Row, Gruickshanks Inn, 
in the School-hill, and Macdonald's Temperance Hotel in Queen 

Street. . , • 

Pawnbrohers.-li is between twenty and thirty years since this 
lucrative but not commendable occupation was first introduced m- 
to Aberdeen, and there are now six of them established and in 
full occupation. The capital invested in this trade may be about 
L 10,000, which is generally understood to be turned five times 
in the course of a year. About nine-tenths of the articles pledged 
are redeemed within the legal period, and, unquestionably, much 
. occasional relief is afforded in seasons of temporary distress by 
their assistance, though, at the same time, it is to be feared that 
the greater part of their trade arises from the improvident and the 

"''Srli— Less than half a century ago, the only approaches to 
Aberdeen were, from the south and west by the Windmillbrae 
and the Green, and from the north by the Gallowgate, and the 
streets in general were inconvenient, from their narrowness and 
the badness of the pavement, which consisted mostly of irregular 
causeway or round stones. About the end of the last century a 
street was opened from Broad Street to North S ree , which fe- 
cihtated the entrance from the north, as North Street runs along

lie foot of the Port Hill, over which the Gallowgate passes. 
Soon after, Marischal Street was opened from Castle Street to 
the Quay, and it was the first street in Aberdeen that was pav- 
ed with dressed stones; but its steepness renders it inconve- 
nient. 

About the beginning of this century, a turnpike road having 
been made to Inverury, a new line of approach to the town was 
obtained, by opening George Street, through the middle of what 
had in former times been a loch or pool of stagnant water. But 
the grand improvement of Aberdeen in this respect was not effected 
until several years later, when a new approach was made from the 
south by the opening of Union Street, and from the north by 
means of King Street, both of which are spacious streets, which 
pass right into the middle of the town, both opening into the 
Castle Street. And it cannot be looked on as the least of the 
benefits which Aberdeen derived from the opening of these streets, 
that, in order to their formation, it was necessary to remove a 
considerable number of houses, which were huddled together in 
a manner that renders it difficult to conceive how the town could 
be ever free from pestilential disorders. In order to avoid the 
inconvenience and danger of the steep descent of the Windmill 
Brae, and the equally steep ascent of the Shiprow or Nether Kirk- 
gate, the hollow through which the Denburn flows was spanned 
by a magnificent bridge of three arches, one of which has a span 
of 132 feet, while the others which are concealed by being built 
over are of 50 feet each. Union Street, which is carried along 
this bridge, is also carried over two of the old streets of the town, 
viz. the Correction Wynd and Putachy side,  and by the opening 
of St Nicholas Street, which connects it with George Street, the 
access is rendered easy and direct from the north into the centre 
of the town. 

Public Buildings. — There are a good many public buildings in 
Aberdeen, some of which are in no- small degree ornamental to 
the town. To enumerate them all here would be tedious and im- 
proper, but it may be right to notice some of the principal. 

The Barrack, which stands on the Castle Hill, was erected in 
1796, and is capable of accommodating 600 men. The situation 
is airy and healthy, and the design of the building good. 

The intervening space till it reaches St Catherine's Hill, part of which was 
removed ni opening the line, being filled up by embankment, so that Union Street 
Ls considerably raised above the Green, which lies alongside oi"it.

Gordon's Hospital, with the additions lately made to it, forms a  

highly ornamental building. , , 1 

The Court House, which was erected in 1818, from a plan by 
J Smith, Esq. is commodious; but, from its situation, it is com- 
pletely hid, as is also the prison, which lies behind it, and which ; 

was built" in 1830. , 

The County Rooms were erected in 1820, on a plan given by 
A. Simpson, Esq., and form one of the most striking ornaments 

of the principal street. , ,  . , 

The North Church was planned by J. Smith, Esq., is an elegant 

building, and forms a very conspicuous ornament in Kmg Street. 
The Lunatic Asylum and the Infirmary, both planned by A. 

Simpson, Esq., are exceedingly handsome buildings, especially the 

The East Church, an elegant building in the Gothic style, was 

planned by A. Simpson, Esq. ■ -u- u .1.0 

The Bridge in Union Street, over the valley m which the 
Denburn runs, is a very elegant structure, shewing a single arch 
whose span is 132 feet, and the height to the top of the parapet 

56 feet. , . , 

The Cross is an elegant octagonal structure, having a column 
risina- from the centre surmounted by a unicorn bearing a shield, 
and surrounded with medallions of the monarchs of Scotland from 
James I. to James VI. It is remarkable as having been the work 
of a stone-mason, from the village of Old Rayne. 

The Orphan Hospital, just finished, is a handsome bmlding, 
without any superfluous ornament. 

Marischal College is not yet finished, but is fast advancing, and 
when completed will be both commodious and ornamental; but it 
is not well situated, being much hemmed in by the surrounding 
buildings.

Addenda. — When the note on page 17 was penned, the writer 
had not seen Boece's Lives of the Bishops, and at first sight a dis- 
crepancy seems to exist between this work and his History of 
Scotland, on the subject of the destruction of Aberdeen by Ed- 
ward. In the latter work, he says, " Moraviam omnem incendio 
ferroque late praeter sacra devastat, ac per Marriam rediens non 
minus eam populationibus afflixit. Aberdoniam urbem regiam 
habitatore exhaustam solo aequat." And the time of this expedi- 
tion, though not distinctly stated in the passage itself, is proved by 
previous dates given, to have been about 1336. In the latter 
work the statement given is as follows : " Per id tempus, triginta 
naves Anglicanae in statione portui Aberdonensi proxima jecere 
anchoras, unde expositae copiae in terram, pene Aberdoniam prius 
sunt ingressse quam cives eas advenisse senserant. 
Angli . . complures Aberdonensium trucidant ; urbem 
simul atque pontificis et canonicorum sedes omni supellectili popu- 
lates incendunt. Arsit Aberdonia, sex dies lugubre intuentibus 
spectaculum. Pepercere hostes templis, pietate moti, religiosorum 
quoque Abbatis. . . Fuit annus quo Aberdonia funes- 
tam hanc cladem accepit, a Christo incarnate tertius supra mille- 
simum tercentesimum tricesimum." 

While it must be admitted that one of these accounts refers to 
an invasion by land troops, and the other to an attack made by a 
naval expedition, it must be remarked, that it is exceedingly im - 
probable that, if they were different attacks, Boece should 'have 
only mentioned one of them in each of his works ; and by a refe- 
rence to Fordun, the difficulty is in part, at least, removed, for he 
says, " totam Moraviam igne, consumens, usque Elgyn pervenit. 
Et progrediens inde, salvis ecclesia et canonicorum aedificiis de 
Elgyn, flamma universa devorante, villam de Abirden solo coquavit. 
Hac tempestate contigit piratas Angligenas de navibus suis de- 
sceodere, et universa maritima. cis fluvium de Forth usque ad 
montes de Hochel sine resistentia crudeliter devastare." So that 
while Edward came with his army from Moray, there seems to 
have been an attack made by English ships about the same time, 
fordun, to be sure, does not state they came so far north as 
Aberdeen, and perhaps they did not ; and the mistake of Boece 
may have been in ascribing the burning of the town to them, in 
stead ot the army, not recollecting what he had said in his His- 
a2' t . clear, but the evi-

PRESBYTERY OF ABERDEEN, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. JOHN STIRLING, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The latter part of the name of this parish is variously 
•written, Coulter and Culture ; in the oldest register of the pa- 
rish, it is uniformly rendered Culter. Some think that this word 
is a Gaelic compound consisting of Cul, the back, and ti', the 
country ; i. e, the back country, the parish being situated on 
the north side of the river Dee. Others account for the name 
by. what they suppose to have been the original orthography of 
the parish, viz. Petri Cultiira. When Popery was the esta- 
bhshed religion, chapels were erected on the opposite sides of 
the river, and dedicated to the respective Saints Mary and Peter. 
To these saints were consecrated not only the chapels, but also 
the nearest wells, the one called St Mary's, and the other St 
Peter's well. At a small distance from the church there is a high 
steep bank called Peter's Heugh. 

Extent and Tojpograpliical Appearances. — From the east, on 
which it is bounded by the parishes of Banchory- Devenick and 
New-hills, this parish extends south-west and west nearly 7 miles. 
Between these extreme points, on the western boundary, it is in- 
dented by the parish of Drumoak ; so that its mean length does 
not much exceed 5 miles. It is in several places nearly 5 miles 
broad, its mean breadth, however, does not exceed 4 miles. Its 
figure is so very irregular, that it would be difficult to compute its 
superficial contents. It is bounded on the south by the river Dee, 
with the exception of the small farm of Insch, which lies beyond 
the river. The surface of the parish is very rugged and uneven. 
It is divided by the burns of Leuchar, Culter, and Murtle, into 
several distinct parts, and it has numerous slopes, and hollows, 
rocky hills, marshy and mossy flats interspersed. 

The southern division, with the exception of a small district of 



106 ABERDEENSHIRE. 

flat haugb, rises in a gentle slope from the banks of tbe river, and 
contains the mansion-houses of Culter, Murtle, Bmghill, Coun- 
tesswells, and Bieldside, with their respective grounds, gardens, 
and woods. The situations of these are most beaut.tu , and the 
exposure excellent. The farms in this district are m a high state 
of cultivation. There is almost no waste land. The soil is m gene- 
ral of a sandy early nature. In some places, there are fields of loam 

with sandy subsoil. , 

As we retire from the river towards the centre and back of the 
parish, the land becomes high, hilly, rocky, and exposed, large 
tracts remain waste, covered with furze, broom, heath, and moss. 
Considerable improvements have of late years been effected, more 
especially towards the west, on Upper and Nether Angustown. 
The soil in this western division still continues of an early, tlnn, 
sandy nature, with a bottom of gravel and rock ; but on the north- 
ern back district, it partakes more of moss and clay. 

Climate, 4-c.— The banks of the Dee are noted for their salu- 
brity of air, and many places on them have of late years become 
favourable retreats for invalids during the summer season. In this 
parish the variation of climate is considerable. On the banks ot 
the river the southern exposure, the thin, dry, sandy soil, the shel- 
ter afforded by the numerous enclosures and small plantations,-- 
all combine in giving effect to the rays of the sun, in rendering the 
temperature high, the air most salubrious, and the climate remar- 

kablv genial. , . \  

In the garden of Murtle, beautifully situated in a sheltered den, 
the peach ripens every year in the open air, and the crops are as 
early here as in any part of the county. 

In the higher and back districts of the parish, the reverse is 
the case ; the situation is more bleak, the land in many places 
damp and marshy, the temperature low, and the l-ate propor- 
tionably more unfavourable; the crops are consequently later, Uie 
snow is often deeper, and frost more intense than on the r m s d • 
On the 4th of August 1829, the river Dee which is every sea 
son subject to great and sudden floods was Aof/

parish, though enclosed by embankments of extent and treng 
iuffcint for the usual rises of the river, were covered to the depth 
of many feet: the soil and growing crops were seriouslydamaged, 
and great quantities of hay in cocks were floated away.

Geology Mineralogy, Sj-c. — In many places large projecting 
rocks, and immense blocks of irregular, hard, irony stone are to 
be met with on the surface. These are considered fit for nothing 
but for building fences. In the south-west and west divisions, 
granite is found, both on the surface and in quarries. In the latter 
division, there is a quarry of considerable extent, from which for- 
merly stones were driven to Aberdeen. This trade is now discon- 
tinued. 

In the mosses, the traces and remains of forests are met with. 

Wood, §c. — Large tracts of the parish are under wood. The 
late Colonel Duff of Culter, and the late Mr Gammel of Countess- 
wells, planted a great extent of surface on their respective estates. 
These plantations are very thriving, and consist chiefly of the 
larch and Scotch fir, to which the soil seems most congenial. 
Around Culter House there is a cluster of beech, chestnut, oak, 
ash, plane, and pine trees, — perhaps the oldest, largest, and most 
beautiful that is anywhere to be m"et with in this or in any of the 
neighbouring counties. One of the beeches measures round its 
trunk 14 feet, rises between 80 and 90 feet high, and spreads its 
branches 75 feet. A few of these trees have been lately cut 
down. 

Along the avenue to Countesswells, here is likewise a double 
row of remarkably fine old spruce trees. In the garden of Murde 
there is a line of Athenian poplars, and one of Arbor vitcB worthy 
of notice for their unusual size ; being planted about thirty-five 
years ago. The old and large trees around the mansion-houses 
are principally hard-wood : the later and more extensive plantations 
consist chiefly of the fir tribes ; the former are in general remark- 
ably large ; the latter are very thriving and promising— so it may 
be concluded that the soil is well adapted for both. 

11. — Civil History. 
 Parochial Registers.— Hegular registers of the baptisms, mar- 
riages, and deaths are kept, the earliest of which commences in 
the year 1674. 

Proprietors.~The parish is now held by eight proprietors. For- 
merly about two-thirds of it belonged to Col. R. W. DufFof Culter. 
,Part of the Culter estate, called Cantlaw, comprising nearly 1000 
acres, is now held by the heirs of the late Mr Symmers of Cults. The 
remainder of this estate, being si ill more than a-half of the parish, 
belongs now to Mr Robert Dufi; son and heir to the late Colonel 
• The estate of Countesswells, now possessed by Mr 



108 ABERDEENSlUlUi. 

Andrew Gammel, contains considerably more than a-sixtb part of 
the parish. The greatest share of the barony of Murtle, former- 
ly belonging to the town of Aberdeen, comprised the remammg 
sixth part. This property has been divided into several lots or 
feus. That part still called Murtle has passed througi severa 
hands, and is now possessed by Mr Thurburn. The lot of Bmghil 
belongs to Captain Kyle,-that of Bieldside to Mr Corbet, and 
that of Oldfold to Mr Anderson ; part of the farm of Miltown ot 
Drum lies in this parish, and belongs to Mr Irvine of Drum. 

Mansion Houses.— The mansion-houses of Culter and Countess- 
wells are large and commodious structures. The former is a very 
old antiquated building ; it has no date upon it, but is believed to 
be about 200 years old. The latter is of more modern architec- 
ture Neither of them is inhabited bye proprietor. They are 
both occasionally let to families from Aberdeen. The house of 
Countesswells is presently occupied by Mr Hadden. 

The mansion-house of Murtle, the residence of Mr Thurburn, 
is of modern architecture, and of considerable elegance, in the Cere- 
cian style ; it stands on a commanding position, having a dehghttul 
view of the river Dee, the surrounding scenery along its banks, 
the more distant Grampians, including Lochnagar, &amp;c. 

On the properties of BinghiU and Bieldside, the present pro- 
prietors have built neat substantial country seats, at which they re- 

'Antiquities.— The remains of the military work mentioned in 
the former Statistical Account of this parish are now almost en- 
tirely obliterated ; a small part of the dike and ditch still remains, 
and forms part of the fence of an adjoining field. This work is 
usually called in popular tradition the Norman dikes. In the for- 
mer account of the parish, its erection is attributed to the Danes 
or to William the Norman ; but late investigations of the work have 
exploded this idea. See Chalmers's Caledonia, Voh i. Chap,

In one of the plantations on Binghill, there is a Druid's tem- 
ple enclosed with a common stone dike ; and near to it there is 
a large tumulus, which is said to have been once the burying-place 
of the family of Drum, a property in a neighbouring parish, where 
the descendants of that family now reside.

The increase of the paper manufactory, to be afterwards men- 
tioned, having attracted to it 60 work people with their families, 
may account in part for this small increase in population. Other 
local causes are likewise assignable, such as the reclaiming of waste 
lands, &amp;c.

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — Though it is impossible to estimate exactly owing 
to the want of recent measurements and plans of the various 
estates, the number of acres of cultivated and uncultivated sur- 
face in the parish, as well as the number under wood, yet the 
following statement has been prepared with considerable care, and 
may be taken as near the truth : 

Number of acres cultivated, - - 5686 Imperial, 

uncultivated, - - 2404 

under wood, planted, - 1600 

Rent. — The rent of land varies very much from 15s. to L.3 per 
Scotch acre, the average may be from L. 1 to L. 1, 1 5s. per 
Scotch acre. The average rent of grazing a full-grown ox or 
cow and keep during the year is about L, 6. 

Live-Stock. — The common breed of black-cattle is a cross of 
the Aberdeenshire with the polled Angus and Galloway breeds. 



no ABERDEENSHIRE. 

There are no sheep, with the exception of a few of the English 
breeds kept for domestic use, chieQy on account of their wool. 

Hushandry.—T\ie system of husbandry pursued in the lower 
parts of the parish is a five years, and in the higher parts a seven 
years rotation. 

The crops raised are oats, barley, hay, turnips, and potatoes;. 
There is very little wheat raised, the soil being in general too thm , ■ 
It has, however, of late years been cultivated at Murtle with suc- 
cess after ley. ,, j . j u 

The breadth of turnips, for which the soil is well adapted, has 
been increasing every year since the introduction of bone dust as 

a manure. . 

A great deal of waste land has been brought under cultivation 
within these last twenty years, and improvements are still making 
in trenching, ditching, and draining low-lying land— a consider- 
able breadth of which is still susceptible of being reclaimed. 

The leases are of nineteen years' duration ; in some cases they 
are granted for twenty-seven years, when waste land is required 
to be improved during the lease. 

Farm-buildings are in general substantially built of stone and 
lime, and belong exclusively to the proprietors, being held by the 
tenants on dead inventory. The cottages are neat and comfort- 
able ; and the fields are inclosed with stone fences. 

Fisheries.— The salmon-fisheries on the Dee, since the intro- 
duction of the stake-nets at the mouth of the river, have greatly di- 
minished in value, barely remunerating the labours of the fisher- 
men, though formerly they yielded a considerable rent to the pro- 

"prolwce.— The average gross amount and value of raw produce 
yearly raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, may 
be as follows: • • i t 10422 10 0 

1895 acres of oats and barley, at L. 5 Os per acre, nper.al, . L. 1022 10 0 

948 ditto turnips and potatoes, at i.. / per acre, .  q 0 

948 do. hay, at L. 4 per acre, • • • • 2842 10 0 

1893 do. pasture, at L. 1, 10s. per acre, • • • _ 

Total amount. • L. 23,093 0 0 

Manufactures-HhB manufactories in the parish are three in 

"Ti' On the burn of Culter, near its junction with the river 
Dee, is situated a snuff-manufactory, be onging to Williain 
M'Combie, Esq. of Easter Skene. It is a small low square tnatcl ed 
building. The internal machinery is driven by a water-wheel of 



PETEllCULTEH.. 



eight horse power. About three hundred weight of siiufF are 
ground per week. The services of only one man are required. 

Id. Several hundred yards farther up the burn-side is situated 
the large paper manufactory of Messrs Arbuthnott and M'Combie, 
who purchased it about two years ago. This establishment was 
the first of the kind in the north, being begun in 1751 on 
comparatively a small scale, and has ever since been in ac- 
tive operation. The present proprietors entered with it in 
1821. They have very materially enlarged the work, and ad- 
ded the new improvements in their branch of manufacture, so 
that, in proportion to its extent, which is not exceeded in many 
instances in Scotland, it is not inferior to any for the same pur- 
poses. It consists of a large chaste pile of the necessary build- 
ings, in excellen repair ; its internal machinery is of the most 
approved modern description. The necessary movements in the 
machinery are produced by two large powerful water-wheels — the 
one placed a httle above the other — and both turned by the same 
stream, brought from an artificial reservoir by a wooden aqueduct. 
The papers made at this work are browns, cartridges, and all 
sorts of wrapping papers, &amp;c. It yields a large revenue to Go- 
vernment, and gives employment to upwards of 60 people, whose 
comforts are in every respect attended to, and in general they ap- 
pear sensible of this. This mill is beautifully situated on a flat 
haugh of several acres, surrounded on the west, north-west, and 
north, by a very steep hill, the front of which seems to consist of 
the segments of diflferent circles ; the steep appears almost per- 
pendicular ; it is in some places nearly 400 feet high, and is co- 
vered with young wood. On the east and south the ground is 
not so high. There are large projecting rocks or crags on each 
side of the burn, both above and below the flat where the mill 
stands, at both of which places there is a bridge thrown across 
between the opposite rocks— the one on- the old, the other on the 
new line of road to Aberdeen. 

The reservoir contains one of the largest artificially collected 
bodies of water any where to be met with. It is confined in the 
den above the bridge by a large dike at its mouth, between its 
opposmg rocky sides. When full, it is nearly 20 feet deep, and 
extends m length nearly half a mile. Above the surface of the 
water the braes are steep and inaccessible, except by artificial 
wa ks, and are covered with wood. When the burn is flooded, 
aiid the water runs over the top of the dike, the cascade down its 
iront IS beautiful. The aqueduct from this reservoir to the mill 



112 ' ABERDEENSHIRE. 

wheel is a work of considerable extent, and deserves notice. It 
is composed of wood, is 700 feet long, 7 feet wide, and 2 feet 
deep, and is supported on stone pillars neatly built, with iron and 
wooden pillars between. It passes below the bridge crossing the 
burn, about 10 feet above its surface, and conveys a large body 

The beauty of the situation and scenery of this establishnrient 
is much admired. The extent of artificial works, the large pile of 
buildings on the left, the spacious reservoir on the right, with an 
occasional cascade over its dike; the aqueduct, supported in the 
air, with its large column of rolling water passing imder the spa- 
cious bridge, with the surrounding rocks and woods,-all at this 
point burs upon the eye of the traveller, and present to his view 
a combination of the beauties of nature and the works of art in a 
variety and to an extent seldom if ever to be met with in so nar- 

row a compass. , 

Sd Nearly a mile farther up the hollow, on the burn of Leuchar, 
in 1831, a mill was erected for carding and spinning wool, and tor 
manufacturing coarse woollen cloth. This estabhshment is m- 
creasing. It at present gives employment to 16 persons, 
v.— Parochial Economy. 
Market-Toion.Onvueavest market and post-town is Aberdeen. 
Means of Communication.-The Dee side turnpike one ot fhe 
best public roads in the north, runs through the southern district 
of the parish nearly four miles. The mail-coach to and from 
Aberdeen and the Castletown of Braemar passes daily, with one 
other pubhc coach, which runs between Aberdeen and Banchory 
in summer. These are principally employed by visitors from Aber- 
deen to the various favourite residences on Dee e, more especial y 
to Ballater, near to which place are the famous wells of Pannanicl . 
The Sken turnpike runs through the back part of the parish about 
a mile. The cross accommodation roads are sufficiently good. 

Ecclesiastical State.-The parish church was built in 1779 . 
contains 550 sittings; is a neat substantial buidmg, --Jme 
state of repair ; is situated on the bank of the river,  
of the southern boundary of the parish ; and is very at end 
The manse is 150 years old, and has undergone considerable le 
pairs and alterations. In 1826, an addition f /wo rooms 
made to it, which makes it sufficiently comfortable and comm d 
ous. The offices are old and thatched, but in an ordinary state 
of repair. The glebe, including the garden and the stance 



PETERCULTEll, 



manse and offices, contains the legal number of acres, along with 
nearly an acre of pasture. The stipend by the last augmentation 
in 1812 is in meal, 54 bolls, 2 firlots, 2 hppies ; in bear, 51 
bolls, 3 firlots ; and in money, L. 1 13, 8s. 2d. All the people are 
of the Established Church, with the exception of five families. 
The average number, of communicants in the Established Church 
is 500. 

Education. — There are 4 schools in the parish, all of which are 
well attended. The parochial school is a very handsome, com- 
modious, and expensive building, capable of containing upwards of 
120 scholars, and is numerously attended. The salary is L.28, with 
what annual allowance the Trustees of the late James Dick, Esq. 
may judge proper to allocate for this parish, and some small mortifi- 
cations for the education of poor children and for teaching a Sab- 
bath school. The amount of fees varies from L. 26 to L. 29 per an- 
num. Thebranchestaughtare, English, writing, arithmetic, English 
grammar, geography, mathematics, Latin, and Greek. In the other 
schools, the same branches are taught, with the exception of ma- 
thematics, Greek, and Latin. In all of them the scholars receive 
religious instruction on. Sabbath. Small mortifications were be- 
queathed for the support of three Sabbath schools in this parish 
by the late Mr Gordon of Murtle. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— CoWectiom at the church for the 
poor amount to about L. 35 per annum. The number of poor on 
the roll is 30, and each receives about L. 1, 10s. from the collec- 
tions and interest of money.

I_T0P0GBAPHY AND NaTUUAL HlSTORY.  

KiNELLAK is situated in that division of the couMy called Mar. 
Mav is considered as consisting of four divisions, Braeniar, C o- 
Midmar, and Mar the most easterly portion. It is in tl.s 
Lt par; where Kinellar is situated, at the distance of nine mile, 
from Aberdeen, and ten from the German Ocean. 

Boundaries and E.tent.T\.e parish has Dyce and Newhil b 
or. thTeasf Skene on the soyth; Skene and Kintore on the wes ; 
and Fintray from which it is separated by the Don on the nord. 
Its lenl from south to north is rather more than four miles and 
S ire 1 from east to west nowhere much exceeds two. It con- 
Sns about 4000 acres, on - undulating s 

rises very high, or sinks very considerably. The gieater part o 

the Padlh IS much exposed to wind and storms, not having any 

shelter tn. woods or neighbouring hills, except a httle from 

Tyrebagger on the east. 

Il._ClVII. HiSTOllV. 

«hW«.- There is an extensive heathy common between , 
Kinetaf and Kintore, in which are a great number of tumul|,. 
StadLte it to have been, at some distant per.od, the prmc.- 
tne of a most sangninary conaict ; but at what .,me and be- •

od bones, placed on beds formed of clay, hardened by fire, and 
the hillocks made'up of soil from a distance. The stones Cairn- 
a-veil being removed a few years ago, it was found to contain a 
stone coflSn, about six feet long, of six flags, holding neither bones 
nor ashes, but some black dust. The churchyard has been the 
site of a Druidical temple, several stones of which, of great size 
and weight, though fallen, yet remain above ground, and others 
have sunk in the earth. It is matter of surprise by what process 
uch weighty masses have been transported from such distances as 
they must have been. Cairn-semblings occupies an elevated spot 
on the hill of Achronie, and is visible over a great extent of coun- 
try to west and north. Near to this place is a large stone on which 
Irvine, the much redoubted Laird of Drum, sat, and made his testa- 
ment, on his way to the battle of Harlaiu, where he fell. 

Parochial Registers. — The oldest register begins in 1640, con- 
taining the texts and discipline ; but no separate register for mar- 
riages, baptisms, and burials was kept till a dozen years ago. An 
unwillingness to register baptisms is but too prevalent among pa- 
rents. The following entry appears, under date " May 4th 1684, 
This day was read from pulpit an act of his Majesty's Council, for 
a solemn and religious fast, upon account of the rigour of the last 
winter, the coldness of the present spring, and the great mortality 
of bestial, to be observed on Wednesday the 7th." It is men- 
tioned in a note, that the snow and frost continued without any re- 
laxation eighteen weeks. 

Land-owners.— The proprietors are, Mrs Brebner of Glasgow 
Forest, valued rent, L. 315, 2s. 2d.; Dyer Society, Kinellar, 
L. 152, 6s. 8d. ; Incorporated Trades of Aberdeen and Glasgoego, 
L. 133, 6s. 8d, ; William Tower, Kinaldie, L. 127, 13s. 4d.; 
Mr Crombie, Auchronie, L. 107, 13s. 4d. ; King's College, Cairn- 
tradlin, L. 100; Dr Ewing, Tartowie, L. 84, 13s. 4d. 

III. — Population. 
The population is smaller than that of any parish within the sy- 
nod. For a considerable number of years previous to 1777, the 
number of persons exceeded 400 ; but from that time to the census 
m 1831, it was considerably less. In 1821, 359; in 1831, 449; 
218 males, and 231 females. -The increase betwixt 1821 and 
1831, was owing to a large distillery being set on foot at Black- 
burn, and an attempt to raise a small village, neither of which have 
succeeded.

' Farm-houses and steadings have been ol" hile very much improved, 
and, in general, are comfortable and commodious. Most leases 
extend to nineteen years, which is in the tenants' favour ; one or 
two are of long duration, and except in these, all the rents are 
by far too high. Some very good land lets at L. 3 per acre, and 
the average rent is L. 2. 

- Waffes. — Good ploughmen get from L. 5 to L. 7 half yearly ; 
next class from L. 4, 10s, to L. 5, lOs. ; boys from L. 2 to L. 3 ; 
females from L. 1, 10s. to L. 2 in winter, and L. 2, 10s. to L. 3 
in summer, — all with victuals. The connection between farmers 
and their servants is now very different from what it was forty or 
fifty years ago. Most servants then i-emained with the same mas- 
ter till they married and got possessions ; they thus became attach- 
ed to the master and the farm, and felt an interest in every thing 
about the town. Now, they rarely engage but for a half year, and, 
delighting to move from place to place, they contract little attach- 
ment either to persons or places. This roving disposition is much 
fostered by the great number of feeing-markets, which promote 
idleness and dissipation. 

Bent, Sj-c. — It is scarcely practicable to state with accuracy the 
real rent of the parish. It may be about L. 3000. Its valued rent 
is L. 1020, 15s. 6d. Scotch. 

Turnips are universally sown, and their management well under- 
stood. The turnip fly is often very destructive, but the writer has 
never lost a crop, by sowing seeds of several years growth, — a prac- 
tice which, on his recommendation, has been followed by many 
with advantage. By this plan, as the seeds of the diflferent years ve- 
getate at different periods, and as the fly does not continue long, 
a crop may be depended on. Where the manure raised is defi- 
cient, it is easily procured from Aberdeen, and bone-dust is getting 
into use. There is very little rutd laga sown. The scythe is 
universally employed to cut both oats and bear, and a month fre- 
quently finishes the harvest. Six years shifts of crops are most 
general ; and every farmer has a thrashing-mill. There is only 
one flock of sheep, and the number of black-cattle varies every 
month with the markets. A disease called red icater has lately ■ 
appeared among new-calved cows, which, in many cases, proves 
fatal. A great improvement in the breed, both of cattle and horses, 

encountered the Danes. This supposition receives confirmation from thecircumstance, 
hppn F ground referred to, which lies nearer to Kinaldie, tlicrc have 

is thpT"rr' ™nt«i»i"g urns, &amp;c. It has also occurred to the writer ihit this 
most likely way of accounting for the origin of the name Kinaldie.

has taken place within the last twenty years, which is encouraged 
by many local associations bestowing premiums. 

v.— Parochial Economy. 
Kintore, at the distance of two miles, was the post-town tdl 
1837, when an office was established at Blackburn. The nearest 
market-town is Inverury, distant seven miles, where there are twenty 
fairs yearly. An excellent turnpike from Aberdeen to the north-, 
west, divides the parish into two equal parts, from east to west. 1 
Besides the mail, three stage-coaches from, and as many to Aber- 
deen, run every lawful day, whose fares are very moderate. Lhej 
cross-roads, except one, which leads to a single farm, are in verj 
bad order ; part of the most frequented one, as leadmg to th 
church, has not had a farthing of the parish money expended on ifi 
for twenty years. A small canal, made in 1797, runs from Aberj 
deen to Inverury, at about a mile north of the church; on whict 
is a passage boat, and other boats, which brmg coals, lime, anc 
manure from Aberdeen to the country; and take gram, slates, 
wood, &amp;c. from the country to Aberdeen. Though it has not ye 
been a profitable concern to the proprietors, it has been of consi- 
derable advantage to a large tract of country. _ 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church was built in 1801 ; it is not 
centrically placed, being only a mile from the Don on the north 



side, and nearly four from the southern boundary of the parish. 
It is in tolerable repair, and may contain nearly 250 sitters, it 
well attended by all, except one Roman Catholic family, ih 



communicants vary from 194 to 210 in number. 

Kinellar, during Popery, was a vicarage belonging to the parson- 
age of Kinkel, along with Kintore, Kemnay, Dyce, Skene, and 
Drumblade. The patronage and tithes of all these were bestowed 
by Archbishop Sharpe on the Dean of the University of St An- 
drews, to present to them with consent of the Archbishop. Attet 
the abolition of Episcopacy, the university exercised this right till 
1761, when these patronages being all sold, Kinellar, with tour 
others, was bought by the Earl of Kintore, w-ho is now patron. 
The manse was built in 1778, is in tolerable repair 
modious. The glebe is 5 acres in extent, very good 1', and he 
minister receives a trifle above L. 60 from the Exchequer, to uiake 
his stipend L. 150. He has L. 20 Scots for  
equal sum for moss-money, there being no moss m the P-i h. 
 Education.-Th. school, built a few.years ago, is pretty come 
niently placed ; the salary L. 26, with house and garden. All tbe.

ordinary branches, with Latin and geometry when wanted, are 
taught, and the fees are very moderate, — 2s. for Enghsh, 3s. for 
arithmetic, and 3s. 6d. for Latin, all per quarter, and book-keep- 
ing, 10s. 6d. per course. The fees amount to about L. 13 per 
annum. The average number of scholars may be 25 in summer, 
and 45 in winter. The schoolmaster, who is also session-clerk and 
a preacher, derives benefit from Dick's liberal bequest to the pa- 
l ochial schoolmasters of the counties of Aberdeen, Banff, and Mo- 
ray, which the heritors reckoned upon when the salary was fixed. 
There is also a Sabbath school, with a small library attached to 
it, and a general desire for instruction prevails. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number on the poor's 
roll is 6, of whom some get 10s. and some 25s. quarterly, as their 
circumstances and the times require ; but many others occasion- 
ally receive relief. The annual collections and penalties average 
from L.12 to L.15; and it is to be remarked that this comes from 
the farmers, cottars, and servants, — for the heritors, not residing, 
contribute very little ; so that the weekly collections demon- 
strate the benevolent dispositions of the parishioners. Most of 
the poorer class are rather shy of applying for, an'd need to be 
sought out and offered, assistance. During the present incumbency 
L. lOO have been added to a small sum previously at interest for 
behoof of the poor, obtained by savings and two small mortifica- 
tions ; and a small sum is also kept in a bank, to be ready in case 
of any sudden emergency. The parish has twice received its pro- 
portion of a legacy left by Mr Burnett, a merchant in Aberdeen, 
to every parish within the shire. The least sum given to any 
parish is L. 20, and the greatest L. 50. The management is un- 
der trustees, and the inspection of the synod, and the suras paid, 
are proportioned to the various circumstances strictly inquired in- 
to of the respective parishes. The order in which the several 
presbyteries receive their allowances, was at first determined by 
lot.

PRESBYTERY OF ABERDEEN, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. W. R. PIRIE, MINISTER. 



I TOVOGRAPHY AND NaTURAL HlSTORY. 

Situation, §-c.-The parish of Dyce lies from five to eight me 
north-west of Aberdeen. The origin of its name is unknown. Va- 
rious suggestions have been proposed on this subject, but none ot 
them sufficiently probable to deserve notice. It is bounded by 
Newhills on the south and south-west ; Kinellar on the north-west ; 
Fintray on the north ; New Machar and Old Machar on the east. 
Its length is about six, its greatest breadth about three miles. 

The figure of the parish is nearly oval, slightly curved at the 
narrower extremity, and lying from north-west to south-east. The 
north-west or broader end of the oval is formed by a low-hill, 
called Tyrebagger, which extends downwards to the south-east 
nearly three miles, or half the extreme length of the parish, alter 
which, rapidly descending, it merges in the adjacent plain. 

Climate.— climate is salubrious, though variable, which 
probably, in some measure, accounts for the prevalence of rheuma- 
tic complaints. Scarlet and typhus fever also, occasionally prevail, 
but can generally be traced to infection. 

Hydrography. -The river Don bounds the'parish on the north 
and east. It rises in Strathdon, and, ■ after a course of about sixty 
miles in a south-easterly direction, falls into the German oceaii 
two miles east of Aberdeen. The haughs or low grounds along 
the banks of this river are exceedingly valuable. They are ricn 
alluvial deposit, and grow crops of remarkable 1"""'";; 
may also be noticed, that the Don is much more apt to be flood- 
ed Ihan formerly, in consequence of the rapidity with which the 

. It is said ia a forme- Statistical Account of ,Ue. 
tore, that " Dyce was in tbe earliest tune called 'Jf ° , „arsl. 

Foetach." The authority for tins statement t that Dyce, as 

in the neighbourhood, called Moss " js chapels or vicarages con- 

well as several adjoining parishes, were in L-atUoiic time i 
rectcd with the Cathedral of Old Machar.

rain water flows into its channel by means of those multitudes of 
drains which of late years have been cut in every direction. 

Geo/o.— Granite is the only species of stone found in consi- 
derable quantities through this parish, of which, however, the rocks 
seem almost inexhaustible, extending over a greater proportion of 
the hill of Tyrebagger. A quarry of it has been opened on the 
south-east corner of that hill, in which direction also lies the dip 
of the strata. Quartz chiefly preponderates in this granite. It is 
considered of fine quality, and a large quantity has been exported 
to London for the erection of public buildings. Other granite 
quarries have at diff"erent times been opened on the same hill, but 
hitherto unprofitably, chiefly in consequence of their difficulty of 
access, and comparative distance from Aberdeen. In consequence 
of the very hmited demand for stone in the London market, how- 
ever, few of the quarries in this neighbourhood have been worked 
to any extent, for a very considerable period of time. 

Zoology. — There are a few roe-deer and blackcock in the plan- 
tations of Tyrebagger, with plenty of woodcock, which are occa- 
sionally found to hatch there. Before these barren hills were 
planted, there were some grouse, which have now nearly disap- 
peared. There are hares, partridges, snipe, wild-duck, and rab- 
bits in the low grounds. Trout-fishing is excellent during March 
and April. 

U. — Civil History. 
Land-owners. — There are six land-owners, viz. Dr Heiiderson of 
Caskieben, author of a well known and ingenious work on wines ; 
Mr Gordon of Pillurg ; Mr Bannerman of Kirkhill ; Sir John For- 
bes, Bart, of Fintray ; Mr Elmslie of Pitmedden's family ; and 
Mr Tower of Kinaldie. Each of these gentlemen has a larger 
rental in this parish than L. 50 per annnm. Sir John Forbes 
and Mr Gordon reside within a few hundred yards of the parish, 
and by their zeal in promoting the improvement of their estates, 

 The writer has been informed by a very intelligent individual , who worked for 
several years in these quarries, that, besides being used for crib, pavement, and cause- 
way stones, and for house-building, the stones from Tyrebagger have been employ- 
ed in raising the following works : the Bell-rock Lightliouse ; Shecrness Quay wall ; 
Deptford Quay-wall ; West India Docks ; and Sheerness Docks. Stones from the 
same quarry were formed into pillars for the groins of the London Custom House, 
and were dressed for the long steps and coping of St Catherine's Docks; and for the 
niost prominent parts of the new Bridge of Don. They were likewise used in build- 
ing the new London Bridge, and from the same place was that fine block of granite 
selected which encloses certain urns and other memorials of the present age, and 
terms the foundation stone of that magnificent structure. In these quarries also a 
tew specimens of dolomite have been found.

as well as the general prosperity of the district, amply prove the 
benefits resulting from personal residence of proprietors  

Parochial Bepsters.— The parochial registers commence with 
August 1645, and are regularly kept up to January 1676, with 
the exception of eight months previous to December 1646. Af- 
ter 1676 there is a hiatus of fifty years. From January 1726, 
they are regularly kept up to the present time. From the most 
ancient of these records, a considerable amount of mformation 
might be obtained in reference to the then existmg state of society. 
Indeed, the facts which they contain render it highly probable, 
that a collation of such session records commencing with a. d. 
1638, as are still preserved throughout the kingdom, would ma- 
terially tend to illustrate a most important portion of our ecclesi- 
astical history, which at present chiefly depends for its authority 
on the conflicting narratives of persons whom we know to have 
been avowed partizans of opposite and inveterate factions. 

Antiquities.-On a gentle acclivity at the south side of Tyre- 
bagger, and commanding a beautiful view of the sea-coast and ad- 
jacent lowlands, is found a Druidical temple, formed by ten rough 
granite stones, arranged in the figure of a circle. They are about 
eight feet distant from each other, the highest of them measuring 
ten, the lowest five feet above the surface of the ground One 
of these stones, fronting due south, is of much greater breadth 
and depth than the others, and now appears crushing through the 
low and decayed pediment on which it had been originally raised 
Probably it was the site of an altar, or station of the presiding 

Hn'the church-yard, and forming a part of its wall, stands a 
larse oblong stone curiously carved., Some have believed it o 
be a Runic monument, but Ihe cross which can still be distinc ly 
traced, pervading that mass of varied sculpture -"J;Vll 
inscribed seems to render this suggestion inadmissible. In al 
probability it must have constituted an ornament of some formei 
church, subsisting during the times of Catholicism 

;::'t- Jtount, to commemoe t|;e de

bv which it might be distinguished, and the origin of its name is 
entirely unknown. 

There are tumuli in various places throughout the parish, usu- 
ally on small eminences. Bones have been found in some of them, 
inclosed in urns of pipe-clay, nearly resembling common flower- 
pots in shape, but no tradition has retained a single trace of their 
history. 

III. — Population. 
From the records of baptisms, marriages, and burials for some 
time subsequent to 1646, it would appear that the population of 
Dyce then must have been not less numerous than at the present 
dav, and double its amount when the last Statistical Account was 
published, 150 years afterwards. This curious fact cannot be as- 
signed to any merely accidental or temporary cause, since these 
records, for nearly twenty years in the seventeenth century, are 
preserved ; during which time there does not appear any one year 
to have been a material diminution of the births and marriages. 
The burials are not quite so accurately recorded. From the li- 
mited number of places where births and marriages are mentioned 
as having occurred, there seems some reason to conjecture that se- 
veral small villages had then existed in the parish. Probably these 
villages were mostly in the neighbourhood of farm-buildings, where 
the servants and others- resided for the sake of convenience and 
mutual protection. This would account for farm-steadings being 
always called " towns" in this district of Scotland. Some of them, 
as Kirkton, Bedlieston, &amp;c. still retain the syllable in their pro- 
per names, after every vestige of a " town" in their neighbourhood 
has disappeared. After the year 1677, there are no data by which 
we could form even a probable conjecture as to the population of 
this parish, till the return made to Dr Webstqr, 1755, which gives 
it at that time 383. By the last Statistical Account, 1795, we 
find the population still on the decrease, being then stated at 352, 
at which time, however, it would appear to have sunk to its minimum, 
having since rapidly and steadily increased, till, in 1831, it had 
reached 620. During the last ten years, however, it may be re- 
marked, that the population in this parish has been perpetually • 
fluctuating, in proportion to the demand for quarriers. It has not 
been uncommon to find an increase or diminution of 50 or 60 in 
the course of a few weeks. The permanent population, which ap- 
P'' steadily increased as has been mentioned up to 
otl, when it probably amounted to something more than 500, 
'may now be considered as diminishing. This is chiefly owing to

the gradual removal of crofters from the more highly cultivated 
porttons of the parish, either to Aberdeen, where they are employ- 
ed by the manufacturers, or to some other country district, the 
barren patches which these persons have improved being as their 
leases expire incorporated with the adjoining farms.

By a very accurate census taken in 1833, the population of this 
parish was found to have decreased to 485 persons, chiefly in con 
sequence of the proprietors having ceased working the quarries. 
Of these, 178 were under fifteen years of age. By a census taken 
in 1839, the population was found farther decreased to 416. 

Character of the Feople.-The people, in general, possess a great 
deeree of sound sense, and perhaps even something of that sarcas- 
tic shrewdness which has sometimes been ascribed as a characteristic 
to the natives of Aberdeenshire. At the same time, they rarely m- 
■ terfere with subjects unconnected with their own private interests 

and domestic duties. 

That they are a religious people is most satisfactorily ascertain- 
ed by the moral respectability of their private conduct. Crimes 
cognizable by the civil authorities are unknown. Drunkenness is 
rare Charges of bastardy may at present be averaged at three in 
aboiit two vears, and these are not unusually cases of relapse on 
the part of Ae females,-a striking contrast toform- times Dur- 
in. the short space of eleven weeks at the end of the year 164 
lout the very date which some have been pleased to esteem the 
lolden era of Scotland's religious history, we find from the parish 
fe ords more crimes of a licentious character, occasionally accom- 
Tied by heavy aggravations, charged before the kn-k-session and 
:ld\y thi ponies, than have occurred dunng the las t u. 
The contrast is little less striking when we compare the

state of crime at the present time with that in any other portion of 
our parish history during the courseof the seventeenth century. The 
superstitions which, from the same authority, we find to have then 
infected both clergy and people, are now generally ridiculed. If 
any trace of superstition still remain, it is rather practical than 
speculative, as in observing festival days, or concealing a child's 
name until the baptism, and seems rather the result of habit than 
of any religious prepossession. 

Poaching in game prevails to a considerable extent, but much 
more among quarriers and manufacturers than the permanent inha- 
bitants of the district. There is no poaching on the salmon-fish- 
eries, which in this parish are of very little value. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture.— There are 2910 acres, standard imperial measure, 
of cultivated land in the parish ; 581 acres of waste land, of which 
perhaps 237 or thereby might, with a profitable application of ca- 
pital, be added to the cultivated land. There are 1176 acres un- 
der wood, amounting to rather more than a third of the whole pa- 
rish. Indeed, the hill of Tyrebagger, with the exception of a 
narrow rim round its edge, is unfit for any other purpose. The 
plantations are wholly Scotch fir and larch. In some places they 
are thriving ; but on the extensive level forming the top of the 
hill, they have hitherto made but little progress, chiefly in conse- 
quence of the poverty of the soil, and their exposure to the sea 
blast. 

Eent of Land. — The average rent of arable land is L. 1 Ster- 
ling per imperial acre. The average rent of grazing is at the rate 
of L. 2, 10s. Sterling per ox or cow, grazed during the summer 
season. Turnips during winter amount to about the same sum. 

Wages and Rates of Labour. — Ploughmen get about L. 10 per 
annum; women from L. 2 to L. 4; day-labourers, with victuals, 
from lOd. to Is.; harvest men from L. 1, 10s. to L. 2, 5s.; har- 
vest women from L.l, 5s. to L. 15s. ; carpenters and masons from 
Is. 3d. to Is. 6d. per day, with victuals; a smith receives for all 
the iron-work on a farm of two horse labour price of iron includ- 
ed L. 4, 10s. Sterling per annum. Smiths are never employed 
here by the day. 

Prices. — A double horse cart costs from L. 8 to L. 10 Sterling ; 
plough for two horses L. 2, 10s. to L. 3 Sterling; harrows 12s. 
each ; mason-work from L. 1 , 5s. to L. 2 per rood ; best park 
timber from 8d. to lOd. per cubic foot. 



126 ABEllDEliNSIlIRE. 

Husbandry.— Thirty years ago there were several flocks of sheep 
in the parish, although there are now only a few kept by private 
famihes for home consumption. This change is to be attributed 
partly to the extent of land which has of late years been reclamied 
from waste and pasture, and partly to the multiplication of planta- 
tions and enclosures. It is the general opinion, that the old 
Aberdeenshire breed of cattle is best adapted for a greater pro- 
portion of the soils in this parish. Some have occasionally tried 
the short-horned, but it seems now universally admitted that these 
can only be profitable on land of superior quality, and m a high 
state of cultivation. From a fashion of crossing these breeds, 
which now extensively prevails, there is some reason to dread that 
the pure Aberdeenshire will gradually diminish, or even may 
wholly disappear. Should this really occur, it is the opinion ol 
some superior judges, that considering the quahty of a large pro- 
portion of the soil a most serious blow would be given to the pros- 
perity of agriculture in this county. It appears, at any rate, a 
subject worthy the attention of land-owners and agricultural asso- 
ciations, were it only from the great respectability and skill of the. 
individuals with whom, in this district, the above opinion is under- 
stood to have originated. . 

The usual system of cropping is by a rotation of five, six, and 
seven years, viz. for a five-shift, grain after lea; turnips; bear 
and sometimes oats laid down with clover and rye grass ; hay or 
pasture; pasture. For a six years shift, the same, with an addi- 
tional year of pasture. For a seven years shift, two gram crops 
before turnips; in other respects the same as the former. 1 le 
ereater proportion of land in this parisli is best adapted for a rota- 
Tion of six years instead of five, which is by far the most common 
system, although the farmers, in general, cannot afford, unde 
the present depressed prices, to sacrifice a direct and immediate 
profit for the sake of a probable ultimate advantage. 

Leas.5.-The usual duration of leases is nineteen years. On an 

improving farm, however, this term is by much too f Jj J 
tenant can have no sufficient time to recover his capital and the n 
terest sunk upon it, still less to gam a fair remuneration foi his

risk and labour. On an improved farm especially where the soil 
is of unequal quality leases should be granted not arbitrarily, but 
to correspond with a suitable rotation of cropping. 

Farm-Buildings. — The farm houses are in general substantial, 
and several on the estates of Caskieben and Dyce are built in a 
very ornamental style, usually that of the cottage ornee. The 
steadings attached to these are very complete, arranged in the figure 
of a square, slated, and with thrashing-mills attached. Most of 
the farms in this parish are inclosed, and several of them thorough- 
ly and substantially, with stone walls four feet high. The expense 
of these inclosures is from 4d. to 6d. an ell, excluding the mate- 
rials. At the same time, there are considerable exceptions to these 
favourable statements. In some parts of the parish farm-buildings 
and inclosures are very indifferent, in a few instances, even little less 
wretched than they are in general found commodious and substan- 
tial. It need hardly be mentioned, that the latter description ap- 
plies chiefly to small farms where the soil is of very inferior qua- 
lity. It is only fair to add, that even in these cases there seems at 
present a decided tendency towards improvement. 

Improvements. — Little, comparatively speaking, remains to be 
done in the way of reclaiming waste land. During the last twenty 
years, six or seven hundred acres of barren soil have been improved. 
On the north and west all that can be done has already been ac- 
complished, and if the extensive improvements now in progress 
through other parts of the parish be carried into effect with the 
same energy and perseverance as they have hitherto been pursued, 
all the barren land which has the smallest chance of being culti- 
vated with success will be reclaimed in the course of a very few 
years. Mr Hervey, who holds the farm of Bedlieston from William 
Gordon, C. S., Esq. has raised a very extensive embankment for 
the protection of his valuable haugh land against the inundations 
of the river Don. It has hitherto proved effectual, with the excep- 
tion of a few cases when the river has risen to a very unusual ex- 
tent, as in August 1829. There are no obstacles to improvement 
m any way peculiar to this parish. The low price of grain, high 
rents, short leases, bad roads, and incessant agitation of the corn 
laws, are of course severely felt here as in other places. The pay- 
ment of miln multures, which seems to have been considered a se-

Means of Comwnnication.-T\v turnpike from Aberdeen to In- 
verness, or great north road, forms the boundary o the parish on 
the west for a distance of two miles. The turnpike from Aber- 
deen to Banff crosses it near the other extremity, where it is scarce- 
ly a mile in breadth. The canal from Aberdeen to nverury also 
passes through this parish. This canal is believed to be a vei; in- 
d ffer nt speculation in respect to profit, but is found exceedingly 
tnvenient'by those living near it, for the conveyance of coa s 
,d lime at a reasonable rate. Passage boats also ply from Abei- 
deen to Inverury twice a-day during the summer. 

Ecclesiastical State.-\e church is situated at the northern ex- 
tremity of the parish, on a rocky promontory formed by a winding

work was executed in a very substantial manner. The glebe mea- 
sures a little more than 5 acres, and may be of the yearly value 
of L. ] 0 Sterling. 

The teinds amount to L. 1 13 Sterling per annum, and the ba- 
lance of stipend is supplied from the Exchequer allowance. 

Notwithstanding the nearness of this parish to Aberdeen, by 
which it is placed completely within its vortex of agitation, not a 
single Seceder is to be found in it, and only three Dissenters of 
any description,— one female who is a Roman Catholic, and an 
aged pair who are Episcopalians, but occasionally attend / the pa- 
rish church. 

The average number of communicants is 230. The average 
amount of church collections for all purposes is about L. 32. 

Education. — The parochial Js the only school in the parish. 
The branches there taught are, reading, writing, English gram- 
mar, arithmetic, and Latin. All the pupils are daily examined on 
the principles of religious truth. The schoolmaster's salary is 
L. '26 Steriing, and the school-fees average about L. 8 Steriino- 
per annum. The schoolmasters of this district are, however, now 
receiving a large addition to their salaries from a fund left for that 
purpose by the late Mr Dick, a gentleman from Morayshire. 
The school-fees are, reading, 2s. ; reading and writing, 2s. 6d. ; 
readmg, writing, and arithmetic, 3s. ; mathematics, 6s. ; Latin,' 
4s. per quarter; they are, on the whole, regularly paid. 

The people in general are fully alive to the benefits of edu- 
cation, and there are extremely few in this parish who cannot 
read, and do not avail themselves of the opportunities they eniov 
for educatmg their famihes. The west and north-west districts of 
the parish are from three to four miles distant from school. Va- 
rious attempts have been made to remedy this inconvenience, but 
hitherto unsuccessfully. The population of these districts is very 
considerable.

THE REV. JOHN LESLIE, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — Udny derives its name from a family, which, for many 
centuries, has possessed the barony of Udny, on which the kirk 
stands. The etymology of Udny is not known. It was erected 
into a parish by act of Parliament, passed 1 9th December 1597, 
entitled " Ratification— Ane Act anent Christ's Kirk of Udny" 
being separated from the parishes of Ellon, Tarves, Logie Buchan, 
and Foveran. The lands taken from Ellon and Logie Buchan still 
pay small sums out of the teinds of these lands to the ministers of 
Ellon and Logie Buchan. 

Extent and Boundaries, c— The parish is almost circular, ex- 
cept on the north-east, where it juts out to a considerable extent. 
It is supposed to contain about 16 square miles. It is situated in 
the district of Aberdeenshire called Formartin, and is bounded 
on the north and north-west, by Tarves ; on the west, by Bour- 
tie ; on the south-west, by Keithhall ; on the south, by New 
Macharand Fintray; on the south-east, by Belhelvie; on the 
east, by Foveran ; and on the north-east, by Logie Buchan and 
Ellon. 

Three small streams run from west to east till they terminate in 
the river Ythan, about six miles distant. Two of these streams 
bound the parish,— the one on the south, the other on the north. 

Abundance of granite, and a vein of limestone, runs from south- 
west to north-east in a zig-zag direction. In many places the vein 
IS covered with a stratum of grayish slate, and the lime-rock is all 
more or less mixed with the slate, which injures the quality of the 

Lime-works have frequently been started ; but are never work- 
a to any extent, as the water breaking in upon the quarry, and 
the inferior quality of the lime, render them a losing concern.

About 60 acres may be supposed to fall to Hillbrae, in the 
parish of Udny, of an undivided common between Udny, Belhelvie, 
and Foveran, called Faichside. About 270 acres are planted, 
chiefly with fir. x\bout ninety years ago. Mains of Udny, being 
the. lands about Udny Castle, were tastefully laid out in square 
fields, averaging about 16 acres, and divided by lanes, all planted 
with four rows of beech and elm, and a hawthorn hedge next the 
fields. The hedges are all decayed, and the two inner rows of 
trees were cut down about forty years ago. The outer rows have 
attained a considerable size, and give the place, at a distance, the 
appearance of a close wood, and the castle appears to advantage 
in the centre. 

ieK.— The rent of land is a trifle under L.l Sterling an impe- 
rial acre. 

Live-stock.— attention has been paid of late to the im- 
provement of cattle, by importing breeds from Kirkcudbright and 
Durham; but the Aberdeenshire breed, mostly black without 
horns, suit the country best, as they thrive upon inferior keep. 
Uearmg cattle is more advantageous than raising grain. 

Drairnng.—ThouXx much has been done by draining, vet no 
branch of improvement has been less attended to. The drains 
are seldom cut deep enough. This is principally owing to the 
open ditches, or water tracks, not being cut to a suflicient depth 
10 admit the water from the drains on either side of the ditch, 
e domare either the ditches or drains cut deeper than three feet, 

mree leet and a half, whereas the ditches should never be less 
tnan seven feet, and the drains about five feet and a half deep.

The butter and cheese, especially the former, made in this pa- 
rish, are considered of superior quality. This is owing to most of 
the land being on an open or rocky bottom, producing fine grass. 

The land is managed generally under a six or seven shift. In the 
former case, which only answers with the better land, one-half of the 
farm is under grain, one-third under grass, and one-sixth under tur- 
nips and potatoes. There is little clay land in the parish, and con- 
sequently little fallow. All the farmers have small gardens for rais- 
ing vegetables for their families. In many of them are raised 
gooseberries and currants, and a few apples. 

At Pitmedden, the seat of Sir William C. Seton, is one of the 
finest and best laid out gardens in the north of Scotland. It was 
made at a great expense, about the middle of the seventeenth 
century, and produces apples and pears, especially the former, 
superior to any in Scotland. ' 

V. — Pauochial Economy. 
Means of Communication.— K post-office was established in the 
centre of the parish about three years ago, by the influence of the 
Earl of Aberdeen, who does everything his Lordship can for the 
good of the country. There is a daily post from Aberdeen. A 
turnpike from Aberdeen leading north, and another from New- 
burgh, the nearest port, distant seven miles, leading west, cross 
each other m the centre of the parish. The line of turnpike be- 
tween Aberdeen and Meldrum passes through the west part of 
he parish, nearly parallel with the road from Aberdeen throua-h 
the centre of the parish. A public coach passes and repass'es 
daily on both the turnpikes from Aberdeen. All the streams 
Which public roads cross have excellent stone bridges

The stipend is 16 chalders of victual, half meal half barley-

About 280 families in the parish, and, in general, between oUU 
and 600 persons attend the Established Church every Sabbath 

There are 8 families of Episcopalians, and 7 of Seceders m the 

'''' The Established Church is remarkably well attended. Within 
the last seven years, the number of communicants has mcreased 

from 527 to 598. , ,

on the teacher's own adventure. The latter receives small sums from 
some of the heritors occasionally as a reward, --y f— 
school is L. 32 ; amount of fees of each school about L. 20 a yea . 
The parochial schoolmaster has the legal accommodation. School 
fees per quarter, 2s. for English; 3s. for English -jtrng; 4s Jo

' ter fell into bad health, when it was given up, an academy was kep 
at the parochial school for nearly fifty y' f   V'Tlon 
to 30 gentlemen's sons, at L.30 a-year for board and education 
The academy was the means of giving better education to the 
parishioners than any of their neighbours had an opportun 
obtaining. Many of the younger farmers belongmg to the parish, 
tZecM theh- education at the Udny Academy, attended se- 
vera sessions at the Aberdeen universities.  Some o the pa- 
rishioners' sons became professional men, who, had it not been for 
the academy, would have been in humble life. 

There is not a person in the parish above fifteen years of age 

who cannot read and write. i • i 

Poor and Parochial Funds.-hhout 31 receive parochial aid, a

more ; and when they once receive relief, it too frequently breaks 
the spring of industry, and renders them quite dependent. 

Fairs. — Three fairs are held at Green of Udny, chiefly for dis- 
posing of black-cattle. The fairs are well attended. 

Ijijis. — There are 7 inns, by far too many, as they have a very 
bad effect on the morals of the people. 

Fuel, — Formerly peats were the only fuel, procured at a great 
waste of time and labour, though little or no money was laid out for 
it. Now, about one-half of the fuel is coals, bought at Aberdeen 
and Newburgh, at about 4s. the imperial boll of 36 stones. Coals 
are much cheaper than peat. 

Miscellaneous Obsehvatioks. 
At the time of the former Statistical Account, forty-six years ago, 
a great proportion of the parish was covered with broom, whins, and 
bulrushes. These are now extirpated, and the eye meets with nothing 
but cultivated and mostly enclosed fields. Fewer hands are now 
employed in agriculture than were formerly, in proportion to the 
extent cultivated. The improved method of working, especially 
the thrashing-machines, as every farm above fifty acres has a thrash- 
ing-machine, has greatly diminished human labour. The conse- 
quence has been, that many of the labourers have repaired to 
Aberdeen, or where they could find employment, which accounts 
for there being more births than burials in the parish. About 
forty years ago, there were ten meal mills in the parish. The 
spare grain was all milled and sold in Aberdeen. There are now 
only three meal mills in the parish. These have not constant em- 
ployment. The farmers mill little more than what is sufficient for 
their families. It is found more advantageous to sell grain than 
meal. 

In the parish are 8 blacksmiths, 8 shoemakers, 5 tailors, 5 
Wrights, and 3 masons. Most of them work by the piece. There 
are 2 gardeners, who work at Is. 6d. per day, with victuals. Farm- 
servants compose the chief body of the people. They are sober, 
industrious, and trustworthy. Some of the tradesmen are dissi- 
pated. There are 6 merchants in the parish upon a small scale. 
They all retail groceries and coarse cloth. Most of them sell 
spirits, which circumstance has a strong tendency to hurt the mo- 
rals of the people. The farmers take most of their groceries from 
Aberdeen. Many of the cottars and small tenants barter their 
butter and eggs with the country retailers, for groceries. 

A few weeks before Whitsunday and Martinmas, markets are 



138 ABERDEENSHIRE. 

held in different parts of the country for engaging farm-servants. 
The best sign of the times is, when the servants are scarce, and 
wages high.

PRESBYTERY OF DEER, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. JOHN MORISON, MINISTER. 



I. Topography and Natural History. 

jVae.— The word Deer, which gives name at once to the pa- 
rish, to the village that lies contiguous to the parish church, and 
to the presbytery of the bounds, appears, on a review of ecclesias- 
tical and other records, to have been spelled differently at different 
periods, but always to have been composed of letters which, when 
spoken according to the ordinary rules of pronunciation, would 
have invariably produced the same sound. The intelligent author 
of the last Statistical Report of the parish traces the origm of the 
name Deer to a Gaelic word signifying the worship of God ; others, 
acxain, have traced its etymology to a Saxon word signifying hollow 

or valley. • . 

Extent, 4-c. — The parish is situated about the centre ot 
the district of Buchan. It is not less than 11 miles long m its 
greatest dimension from south-east to north-west, and from 3 to 6 
miles broad, where it is widest. At an average, it may be com- 
puted as being 9 miles in length, by 4i miles in breadth ; thus 
containing upwards of 40 square miles of surface, or about 25,000 
imperial acres. Mr Robertson, in his map of the counties of Aber- 
deen, &amp;c. estimates the extent of the parish in Aberdeenshire at 
22 940 acres, and in Banffshire, 2777 acres ; an estimate which 
agrees pretty nearly with that above given. The less portion is 
generally supposed to be a detached part of a great barony, the 
body of which constitutes the parish of St Fergus, that belonged 
to a family of the name of Cheyne, once hereditary sheriffs of the 
county of Banff, who had their castle or principal residence at In- 
verugie. These lands came into the possession of the Manschal fa- 
mily, in consequence of an alliance by marriage of one ot the 



OLD DEER.

Keiths with the heiress of that house, about the middle of the four- 
teenth century. The parish is of an irregular shape, and in many 
places without any distinct or natural boundary, bearing some re- 
semblance to the usual form of a cross tree, a sort yoke that em- 
braces the neck, and stretches over the shoulders, — from the ends 
of which, persons, for the sake of ease and convenience, often sus- 
pend and carry water buckets or such like burdens. The space 
corresponding with the cavity that receives the neck is on the east 
side, and belongs to the parish of Longside ; and the site of the 
parish church is in the line of that encroachment, little more than 
a mile from the junction of the two parishes, and about 10 J miles 
by the public road from the nearest sea-port, at the parliamentary 
burgh and market-town of Peterhead. 

Topographical Appearances. — The surface is undulating, present- 
ing to the eye of a spectator, placed on an elevated situation, a 
group of eminences of various sizes and forms, separated from one 
another, and in some instances altogether surrounded by rivulets or 
rills. Many of these eminences, the highest of which it is probable, 
thouoph no exact measurement of their altitude has been taken, 
does not exceed between 200 and 300 feet above the level of the 
sea, are cultivated to the top ; and most of the interjacent valleys 
are now brought under tillage, to which great encouragement has 
been given by several proprietors, particularly of late, in cleaning 
and straighting water-courses, so as to facilitate the means of 
drainage, and prevent flooding. 

The peninsular situation of Buchan, at least the distance it 
stretches into the sea, and its general want of shelter from hills or 
woods, render the climate upon the whole rather humid and chil- 
ly, although it is no doubt undergoing an improvement by the re- 
moval of stagnant, water and marshes, and the increase of plan- 
tations and quickset hedges.  Yet the number of individuals 
of both sexes that reach a very advanced period of life, and the 
rareness of epidemics or any prevailing ailment, would warrant 
an inference, that the locality is rather salubrious than other- 
wise. Of late, however, to whatever cause it may be owing, the 
stone and urinary complaints seem to be on the increase. In- 
stances, too, of natural small-pox, owing most probably to the omis- 
sion or improper application of vaccine matter, have become much 

' In the beginning of the year 18.37, when this Accountas drawn up, there 
ore living m the parish no fewer than five persons, each above ninety- five years of 
SK, and one of them just approaching the end of a century.

more frequent of late than they used to be, though rarely fatal. 
Much credit is due to the medical practitioners, who not only be- 
stow gratuitously upon the sick poor their skill and attendance 
when required, but also often supply them with medicmes and cor- 
dials at their own expense.

Hydrography. — There is no natural lake of any considera- 
tion in the parish. But within the park or pleasure-ground of 
Pitfour, the seat of George Ferguson, Esq. Captain R. N., 
there is an artificial one in front of the house, covering more 
than 25 acres, tastefully designed, abundantly stocked with 
tench, carp, and Lochleven trout, and crossed in its branches by 
three neat stone bridges, one with three arches which open ap- 
proaches to the mansion. This irregular piece of water, made by 
means of a deep embankment on one side to fill a winding hollow, 
is skirted nearly round by large trees or young thriving plantations, 
and has had lately erected on its brink, at the place where the flow 
lU- spare water escapes, a very elegant small temple, constructed after 
the plan of that of Theseus at Athens, and surrounded by thirty- 
four granite columns. The interior is neatly fitted up as a cold bath. 
This lake, besides supplying a peculiar and beautiful object in the 
landscape, and serving as a breeding-place or depot for fresh wa- 
ter fish, has become the constant habitation of a colony of tame 
swans, and, at particular seasons of the year, it may be seen occa- 
sionally almost covered with flocks of wild ducks. 

The only streams of any considerable size that pass through the 
parish, are the south and north branches of the Ugie, which blend 
their waters in the parish of Longside, and flow into the sea toge- 
ther scarcely a mile N. W. of Peterhead. Owing to the small accli- 
vity of the ground, and the numerous bends or turns of the valleys 
through which they pass, they make in general a very sluggish and 
meandering course ; and where pains have not been taken to deepen 
and straighten their channels, or raise proper embankments, they 
are apt to overflow after falls of rain, and, unless in particular 
spots, or in very dry times, to keep wet the flats on each side. 
Containing as they do a plentiful supply of black or burn-trouts, they 
afford abundance of what is called sport to the angler ; but very 
few of the salmon tribe, beyond mere fry, are to be found at this 
distance from the sea. The principal stream, where it passes the 
ehurch, has not run, perhaps, above ten miles from its source in 
New Deer, and the surface from which it collects the water that 
sprmgs from and falls upon the earth, does not exceed fifty square 
"iiles. There are several tributary streams of less size, rising in 
he parish, and some of them driving machinery as they pass along. 
' Jost parts of the parish are well supplied with pure spring water ; 
lut there are a few situations ill accommodated in this respect, 
lere pits have been dug in vain forty feet deep. Chalybeates,

stones built rudely into something like the form of a cube, 5 feet 
on each side, four of these measures, or 500 solid feet, being esti- 
mated to yield 100 bolls of lime. 

Within two furlongs of the lime quarry, on the lands of Annochie 
also, are numerous large blocks of pure white quartz, some lying on 
the surface and others imbedded in the earth. Towards the 
south side of the parish, and in several other detached districts, 
such rocks and stones as are found partake chiefly of the silicious 
character, and can with difficulty be forced, by the hammer or any 
instrument into proper shapes for building. The high ground 
south of the house of Kinmundy, and the top of the hill of Skel- 
muir, fully more than one mile and a-half to the westward, and se- 
parated from the other by a pretty deep and broad valley, are 
overspread with nodules and fragments of flint. The heart of 
most of these nodules, when they are broken, contains a cavity, 
and discloses the impression of a sea shell. 

In di gging gravel pits to find materials for making roads, the 
constituent parts of granite, felspar, quartz, and mica are often met 
with ; all regularly disposed, and exhibiting, till touched, some- 
what of a rocky appearance, but without the least cohesion among 
the particles. Phenomena of this kind, and well marked symptoms 
of stratification, may be traced at different elevations, in some in- 
stances from one side of a valley to a corresponding level on the 
opposite. 

There have been, at some period, immense fields of peat moss 
occupying the low ground, and filling up cavities where there was 
stagnant water in more elevated situations. But in consequence 
of the heavy demand that has been long made upon it for fuel and 
other purposes, and the little care taken to promote its growth, 
there are but few places now where it is not altogether or almost 
exhausted, and the spots where it existed either left an unseemly 
waste, or reduced to tillage. Nor is the destruction of this sub- 
stance much to be regretted ; for it manifestly tends to deteriorate 
the cHmate, by reason of the facility with which, like a sponge, it 
receives and retains moisture and frost. And if due allowance be 
made for the time, money, and labour consumed in procuring this 
commodity, when the place where it is found lies several miles dis- 
tant from that where it has to be used, the same quantity of heat 
may be obtained at less cost from sea-borne coal, provided a horse 
can go by a tolerable road to the port, and return with a load the • 
same day. Boles or logs of hard-wood trees, principally oak, rarely

if ever fir, some of them considerable as to girth, but of no great 
length, are found now and then in a tolerable state of preservation 

in the mosses. , . , 

Soil— The soil, as might naturally be expected in such a 
varietj of surface, is far from being uniform. In some cases, the 
clave, or argillaceous, and in others the sandy, gravelly, or s.licrous 
ingredients prevail. Small, indeed, is the quanUly that can be re- 
lated as alluvial. In several flats and braes, or hiU-sides, such 
fof as th re is seems to have been torn »ith ditBculty from a hght 
coarse sward overlying a mass of ferruginous matter, rmperv.ous to 
water, and next to impenetrable ; or from an mert ochrey and 
which it is scarcely possible by any means to nnpart l.fe and far- 
It seems ultlrl, beyond the power of man to make a g od 
0 profitable subject of such materials as these, although the mlro- 
duction of bone-dust as a manure, and one that appears from use 
p uLly well suited tor a situation like this, grves the tenant ofc 
r rv and hazelly field an advantage which he d,d not prevously 
p„ ess. It is a pity, however, to see a farmer bestowmg a more 
[han due proportion of culture and cost upon ground where, though 
tts easy to make the plough pass, he can expect no adequate e-

wi h nothin.. but stunted heath, appear to have been culttvated at 
lie former period. There are still visible upon them the marks 
of cro ked ridges, which in all probability were success.velygathe d

earth as they could lift, to form with the animal manure dropped 
in winter, and peat-ashes, a compost for deepening and enriching 
by turns the fields which were destined to constant aration. This 
plan of management served to impoverish one part of the farm, 
while it benefited another, and was the cause of a distinction which 
is still observable and spoken of, between injield and outfield, not- 
withstanding a long-continued attempt to bring them nearer to a 
state of equality by a different and improved system of husbandry. 

Botany. — The following is a list of a few plants culled by a 
scientific friend, which he reckoned as being of the rarer species 
in the district, viz. — 

Peplis portula Listera cordata Subularia aquatica 

Parnassia palustrjs Trientalis Europaea Botrychium Lunaria 

Menyanthes trifoliata Veronica scutellata Hippuris vulgaris, &amp;c.

It is not saying much to state, that there is more growing wood 
HI this parish, and much of it in a more thriving condition, than 
IS to be found in any other district of Buchan of an equal, or even 
of a much greater extent. The late James Ferguson, Esq. of 
Pitfour was at great pains and cost in forming plantations : and 
the present proprietor, while he attends carefully to thinning, 
pruning, and nursing the woods that he found upon the estate] 
has done a good deal to extend their limits. It is to be regretted' 
however, that much of his labour and money are lost, as the greateJ 
luimber of the plants put into the ground are either totally de- 
stroyed by deer, hares, and rabbits, or so much injured as to leave 
little hope of their ever coming to be trees. About 1100 acres 
of the property m this parish are occupied by plantations. 

The father of the present proprietor of Aden was also at sin- 
gular pams in raismg forest trees, and ornamenting his place or 
•nanor. When he succeeded to the property it was rather naked; 
I'tit he left on the portion of it immediately attached to the do- 
"lain, a great many acres of thriving wood, not short of 300 acres, 
should suppose, m masses, clumps, belts, and hedge-rows. 
Mr Ferguson of Kenmundy is not much indebted to his an- 
cestors for the care they took to enrich and beautify the estate he 
nhented m this way; but since he came to have the command of

might have led them to prefer, while they saw no person, they 
heard a voice thus accost them : 

" It is not here, it is not here, 
That ye're to big the Kirk o' Deer, 
But on the tap o' Tillery, 
Where many a corpse shall after lie." 

A church accordingly was built on a knoll or small mount, em- 
braced by a semicircular bend of the Ugie, and, as was customary, 
a piece of ground around it was set apart for a burial-place, so that 
the weird is fully verified, in the great number of interments that 
have taken place, during the lapse of centuries, in a wide and po- 
pulous parish. 

There are visible proofs still remaining that this parish was for - 
merly the scene of warfare, occasioned by family feuds, civil strife, 
or the invasion of the country by foreigners. On the top of the 
hill of Bruxie, and at Den of Howie, near Fetterangus, there are 
traces of fortifications and encampments; and near the foot of 
Arkey-brae, there is a cluster of tumuli, pointing out the graves of 
warriors who fell in a bloody contest reported to have taken place 
between Edward, the brother of King Robert Bruce, and Gum- 
ming, the Earl of Buchan, with their followers and clansmen. 

In the insurrection of 1745-6, there were risings in behalf of 
the exiled Stuarts, many of the heads of families being attached 
to the Jacobite interest. That rough partizan of the fallen cause, 
Gordon of Glenbucket, instead of attaching himself to the main 
army, extended his barbarities into the lowlands ; and as the 
Laird of Kinmundy was known to favour the opposite side, he 
shewed some of his rude civilities to that house, particularly to the 
lady, who was left in command of the garrison. 

Present State of Properti/.— The three principal landholders re- 
side in the parish. Captain Ferguson of Pitfour ; Mr Ferguson of 
Kinmundy; and Mr Russell of Aden. There are six others who 
have estates here, viz. the Honourable William Gordon of Ellon, 
proprietor of Skelmuir; the Rev. J. S. Burnett has Dens and 
Little Crichie ; Mr Buchan of Auchmacoy, Knock ; Mr Gordon 
of Nethermuir, Kidshill and Greenbrae ; Lord Lovat a portion of 
SkiUimarno, at the north extremity of the parish ; and Mr Forbes 
Irvine of Schivas, the pendicle of Cairncummer. Besides what 
belongs to these individuals, between a fifth and a sixth part of the 
whole parish, estimated according to the valued rent, is mortified pro- 
perty, appertaining to various charitable trusts. Clachriah, &amp;c. pur- 
chased lately from Pitfour, belongs to the Trustees of the late Mr Gor-

ground plan, yet marked by the remaining fragments of walls, to 
have been originally a very extensive though rude piece of mason- 
ry, was in a great measure dilapidated for the purpose of con- 
structing houses and dikes in the neighbourhood, and till a late 
proprietor of Pitfour took the trouble of clearing away part of the 
rubbish, and repairing some of the principal walls, according to 
the original plan of architecture, if the phrase may be used in re- 
spect to so plain a style of building, — the form and dimensions 
of the edifice could not be ascertained. The church, situated on 
the north side, hasJoeen of considerable size, built in the form of 
a cross, with chancel, nave, and transept, in fair proportions. The 
greatest length, taken internally from east to west, is 150 feet, and 
the greatest breadth, where is the transept, 90 feet. The roof of 
the nave, itself 38 feet wide, appears to have had, besides the 
support of the walls, that of a row of stone pillars, the bases of 
which are still visible, extending from end to end about 17 feet 
distant from one another, and considerably nearer the north than 
the south side of the building. This religious house was founded 
about the beginning of the thirteenth century, by one of the Cum- 
mings, then Earl of Buchan, and first occupied by a colony of Cis- 
tertian monks from the Abbey of Kinloss, in Moray. A name- 
sake of the founder was the builder. Not many years ago, a lin- 
tel over a door in the ruinous castle of Inverallochy, parish of Lon- 
may, was removed, which is said to have had on it this inscription, 
or words to the same effect : 

" I, Jordan Cummin, indwaller here. 

Got lands of Inverallochy for building Abbey Deer." 

The abbey was suppressed at the Reformation, and erected in- 
to a temporal lordship in favour of Robert, the Earl Marischal's 
second son, created Lord Altrie. The newly created peer dying 
without issue, the title became extinct, and the estate was incorpo- 
rated with that of the head of the family. The revenue of the in- 
stitution, as appears from the collector's books, still or lately ex- 
tant, is stated at L. 572, 8s. 6d. of money ; 65 chalders, 7 bolls, 1 
firlot, Specks of meal; 14 bolls of wheat; and 14 chalders 10 
bolls of bear. If we advert to the extent of territory set apart for 
the support of the house, and to the rents which the lands may 
be supposed to yield to their proprietors at the present day, the 

annua income of this monastic establishment must have been con- 
siderable. 

Among the ancient erections we ought to include the Druidical

temples, or circles, as they are commonly called. These appear 
to have been more than usually numerous- here, although vest.ges 
only of four or five now remain. The rest have been destroyed 
for the sake of the stones, or to clear the way for cultivating the 
ground they occupied. The one that is most entire and best ex- 
posed to public view, is on the top of the hill of Parkhouse. The| 
principal or altar stone, placed as usual on the south side, and ly- 
ing with its ends east and west, is 14 feet long, 5 feet broad, 
and 41 feet deep. If a third part of the solid contents or measure 
which'these dimensions would yield, be deducted for defects or in 
equalities in the stone, the gross weight of it, at 11 cubic feet pel 
ton, would still exceed 21 tons. The stone belongs to the primi- 
live trap. The diameter of the space inclosed, or comprehended 
by the circle, is 48 feet. Only four of the upright stones remain, 
and are about 14 feet asunder. 

- At the distance of 500 yards, on the north side of the sanie 
hill," observes the author of the last Statistical Account of the 
parish, « were not long ago the ruins of a small village, supposed 
to have been the residence of the Druids," but commonly called 
by the country people Fights' or Picts' houses. " A number of 
mtle yards were to be seen all around it " every vestige of which 
is no; obliterated by the process of culture. « It eons sted of 
50 or 60 mossy huts, from 6 to 12 feet square, irregularly hud- 
died together. Hence it got the name of the bourachs. The wals 
were built of stone and clay ; the floors were paved with stones. 

Modern Buildings, State of the Population §'c.-The three re- 
sident heritors have neat, commodious and, for the ex ent of th 
estates, sufficiently spacious houses, with suitable court so office 
either entirely built, or extensively repaired and greatly enlarg d 
by themselves. The mansion of Pitfour, including furnitu , and 
what has been laid out in constructing its various useful and or 
namental appendages, improving the park and policies mak g 
approaches, &amp;c. has cost the present owner, acc-d"ig to lus own 
admission, and that of his men of business, nearly L. 80,000.

riid cot'tagers in spots which used to -

increasino- ratio. The only other collection of inhabited houses 
entitled to the name of a village is that of Old Deer, contiguous 
to the parish church. This village contained, at the time the 
census of the other two was last taken, '211 persons of all ages, 
and has received little increase or alteration for a long time. 

In the year 1787 or 1788, a careful census was taken of the 
people, distinguishing the different religious denominations, with 
a view to ascertain what accommodation it would be expedient to 
provide for those belonging to the Establishment in a new church, 
which was then about to be built. The gross population at that 
time is reported to have been 3267, of whom 962 are set down 
as being Episcopalians, Papists, or Seceders, amounting together 
to considerably more than one-fourth of the whole people. Ac- 
cording to the census made by order of Government in 1831, the 
number of inhabitants had grown to 4110, and in 1836, it would 
appear, from a careful investigation oi the matter, to have then 
increased to no fewer than 4428 individuals. The number of 
religious sects or persuasions is much greater than it was in 1788, 
and, if the investigation alluded to be correct, the proportions among 
such sects as then existed have been greatly altered ; but the ratio 
which the various Dissenting bodies now bear to the Establish- 
ment, seems to remain much the same, since the total number of 
full-grown persons presently in full communion with the Esta- 
blished Church appears to be 1708, and of those in the same state 
belonging to all other denominations of Christians, 645. 

As no register of burials is kept, and parents, particularly those 
belonging to Dissenting communions, are far from being punc- 
tual in getting their children's baptisms or ages recorded, an ac- 
count to be depended on cannot be given of the number of births 
and burials that happen annually. But the average number of 
marriages for the last seven years, counting a marriage only when 
the female belongs to the parish, is 26. There are 259 families 
in the three villages, and 725 in . rural situations, thus giving on 
an average in the former case nearly 4, and in the latter somewhat 
less than 5 individuals to a family. Of these families, reckoning 
by the religious persuasion of the person who is at the head of 
each, there are 714 belonging to the Established Church; 83 
Episcopalian; 157 of the Original or United Secession; and 30 
of different Dissenting bodies, chiefly Congregationalists. 

Only one person, a boy, is known to be altogether deaf and 
dumb; but there are 4 totally blind. No fewer than 10 persons

ly possessed of disordered or weak understandings, two of whom 
are violently insane, and the rest fatuous or imbecile.

It were much to be desired that more attention were paid t 
cleanhness and cheap comforts by the common people, than is the 
case But, upon the whole, we think that even the lowest of the 
peasantry are not in this particular a whit behind those of the 
same class throughout the district. 

IV. — Industry. 
State of Agricullure and Manufactures.— is the general 
state of agricultural knowledge that most farmers, and even 
crofters, are disposed, as they are usually bound by their tenures, 
to observe, from beginning to end of their leases, a regular plan o 
tillage A five-course shift was the one that for some time till ot 
late was most in vogue, viz. first year, oats from lea ; second tur- 
nip,' potLoes, and, when the manure failed, naked fallow ; third, 
Sey, oats, or sometimes wheat, with a due quantity of clover and 
rye-grass seeds ; fourth, hay or pasture ; and fifth, pasture. Sonie 
tenants had, besides these lots, another section, at least, paddock 
«11 field, in perpetual grass. This short station, l.wev. 
b-is been found by experience, particularly on loamy and open 
s n t 't canifot L persisted in with profit, because the fre- 
;t;t7oughings and croppings it requires have a tendency to

exhaust the land, and render it too open and loose ; and it 
has, in general, been deemed expedient to lengthen the se- 
ries to six, seven, or eight years, that the land, from getting more 
rest, as it is called, may become more consolidated and produc- 
tive. How far the evil that arises from loosening the soil to ex- 
cess, is remedied by the agricultural instrument lately invented and 
called a compressor, is yet here only the subject of experiment. The 
ground, whether naturally dry or wettish, is still laid out in flat, 
straight, and narrow ridges, from sixteen to twenty feet broad. 
Furrow-draining, — although stones in general are pretty plentiful, 
— is not practised to great extent ; but some trials of it have been 
made with good effect. Enclosing fields by stone dikes, deep 
ditches in wet land, and shallow ones in dry situations, with a 
mound on one side cropped with stones, where stones are not easily 
provided, or little or no allowance is granted by the landlord for fen- 
ces, — has become very common of late. — Cattle are found to thrive 
better when they are allowed to eat, drink, roam, and rest at plea- 
sure, free from the control of a herd, and the confinement of a 
house or pen during the heat of summer ; and more of them can 
be kept within the same bounds enclosed than open. — Hedges of 
hawthorn, beech, or other wood plants suitable for the purpose, are 
rare, unless near gentlemen's seats, on account of the expense of 
rearing them, and the difficulty of making them by any care suffi- 
cient fences in this climate. It would be judicious, however, to 
encourage the growth of them, at least, to a certain extent, for the 
sake of shelter, in conjunction with other means of enclosure. 

Several persons, the resident heritors especially, have laid out a 
considerable quantity of land, not under 600 or 700 acres, in per- 
manent pasture, which they let annually at a rent, it may be stated, 
varying from L. 1, 10s. to L. 4per acre, to cattle-dealers, graziers, 
and farmers, who can keep a greater stock of bestial in winter than 
summer on the produce of their farms, when they are kept in the 
ordmary course of rotation. Both the soil and climate are thought 
to be better suited for oats, turnip, and pasture, than for wheat or 
barley. The last two species of grain are on that account sparingly 
sown. The varieties of oats in most common use are of an early 
kind, such as white or English barley oats, early Angus oats, po- 
tato oats, &amp;c. In dry and warm soils, liable to be affected by 
jought, recourse is usually had to those of a later quality, such as 

e or gray Angus oats, Kildrummy, or what is considered the na- 
oat of the county, Hopetoun oats, &amp;c. The usual quantity 



154 ABERDEENSHlllE. 

of seed is from six to six and a half bushels per imperial acre; 
and the returns may be stated, taking an average of seasons, on 
a good farm, from five to six and a half ; on a bad one, three 
to four; and on those of a mixed or indifferent quality, at the va 
rious intermediate degrees. From an after statement it wdl ap- 
pear that the average return is rather above than below four and 
a half. Since the turnip husbandry has been fully established, 
and bone-dust could be purchased at a moderate price, from 2s. 
2d. to 2s. 6d. a bushel, to supply the deficiency of home manure, 
—the o-rowth of peas has been almost discontinued. 

It isloncT since farmers used to fatten a part of their winter stock 
of cattle for the home consumption. That demand, however, was 
very limited. But of late, the practice of conveying cattle alive m 
good condition bv steam or sailing vessels to London, where a 
much better price is commonly obtained, has induced many to keep 
the stots or full-grown animals, which they used to dispose of in 
some of the summer markets, to English or south country dealers; 
and, when they are fully stall-fed, either to send them directly from 
themselves, to be sold for their behoof by a commission-agent in 
the southern metropolis, or to pass them into the hands of a 
dealer at home, who traffics in that commodity. It is not unusual 
for country graziers or dealers to continue their trade through the 
winter, and to bargain with farmers for what they can spare of 
their turnips at so much, from L. 6 to L. 10 per acre, to be con- 
sumed upon the farm, receiving therewith house accommodatn. 
and a competent quantity of straw for fodder and bedding. No 
thine, for many years, back has contributed more to improve h 
ondhion of th'e fanning interest in this part of the -rid than die 
discovery and general use of bone manure for the raising of tnr 
nins and the easy transport of cattle fattened by them to a distant

dition, would in all probability have placed both the owners and 
the occupiers of the soil, with many others who depend upon them, 
•directly or indirectly, in a new and perilous situation. Tenants 
ordinarily are not possessed of much capital beyond what they have 
invested in stocking and improving their tenements, to enable them 
to bear up under a heavy and protracted pressure ; and unless 
their rents could be so adjusted by reference to the current prices 
of what their farms chiefly yield, so as to rise and fall with the 
fluctuations in the value of produce, there is a risk of a series of 
cross seasons obliging them to relinquish their places and voca- 
tions ; and if this should ever unfortunately be the case, to any 
considerable extent, it may be difficult to find another set of men 
possessed of capital, skill, and enterprise to succeed them. It 
would, therefore, be wise in landlords and tenants to make such 
arrangements with one another, as may enable them to meet, so 
far as a prudent foresight can avail, without any serious shock, 
this, to say the least of it, not very improbable contingency. Ad- 
verting to the ordinary course of seasons and events, and taking, 
moreover, into account, how the agricultural, like other great na- 
tional pursuits is liable to be afl'ected by the unsettled and restless 
state of legislation, which has for some time perplexed and discon- 
certed many classes of the community, we have no right to pre- 
sume on a lasting continuance of even such prosperity as that with 
which the country has been for some time providentially favoured. 
Besides such clauses in leases as those to which I have just refer- 
red, it would be politic, as well as just in land-owners, to encourage 
their tenantry, by assisting them to execute all substantial and 
costly improvements wanted, such as roads, water-courses, ditches, 
drains, fences, &amp;c. because they thereby put them into a better 
state for settling with themselves at term time, and, happen what 
may, provided the occupier pays a due proportion of the expense, 
these improvements, if judiciously planned and properly executed, 
must add, beyond what they have cost them, to the value of their 
property. Indeed, it properly belongs to the proprietor, who either 
has of himself, or by concert with his neighbours, may get the 
command of a district, to project and execute many improvements, 
which, m order to be effectual, require to be extended over a wider 
space than the limits of a single tenement. Farms, commencing 
with such as occupy a pair of horses, and are in the hands of one 
individual, vary in size from 30 to 500 acres. There are about 
nve scoreof tenements that can be managed with greater or less

ease by one plough; above thirty that requu-e two ploughs ; seven 
or eight that cannot be wrought by fewer than three ploughs, at 
least ; and two that furnish sufficient employment for five, s ix or 
seven. Several of the others, although they have a less field tor 
their operations, are entitled, we doubt not, to a proportional share 
of credit ; but the occupiers of the two largest farms, both gentle- 
men, well educated, of public spirit, and possessed of some funds, 
have, in the course of a few years, effected an admirable change, 
both as to appearance and value, in the land under their manage- 
ment  Besides the tenements above-mentioned, there is a very 
considerable number of small possessions, the holders of which 
continue with one horse either to associate with a neighbour simi- 
larly circumstanced, or to mount a yoke of their own, by providing 
an ox, a stot, or even sometimes a cow, to go alongside his horse 
in the spring season. Most villagers, and some with small crolts 
in the country, hire for labouring their lots of ground, or doing 
other similar services, the ordinary charge being at the rate ot 
Is. 6d. to 2s. for a horse per yoking. The total number of ploughs 
presently required, or rather actually used in the parish, is asl- 
lows, viz. 244 drawn by a pair of horses ; 25 by a pair of oxen ; 
and 27 by a horse and a nolt animal of some description for a fel- 
low. It is utterly impracticable, for obvious reasons, to furnish an 
accurate statement of the amount or value of agricultural stock ; 
and yet this, if it could be procured, appears to be a very import- 
ant matter, as it would afford data for comparing the state of e 
country at one period with that at another, and marking the 
change for the better or the worse that takes place during the in- 
terval. As a near approximation to the truth, however the fol- 
lowing may be given as the gross amount of live-stock, of all ages 
vhich have been usually kept, summer and winter, or a few y ars 
back throughout the parish, taken f-om hsts -refully t«ade up by 
different individuals acquainted with the several districts, uz. 
434TbLk cattle, 721 horses, 1019 sheep, and 216 swme An 
•xttempt was made at the same time to ascertain the qanUty of 
tin sown and grown yearly on the several possessions. Owing 
' i a to th'e irregularity of seasons, there is still greater chfl.- 
ely in aLertaimng the fact here than in the former case. 1 he 
following, however, may be stated as the result:

Rent of Land. — The rent of land, as noay be readily supposed, 
is still more various than its quality. Some acres in the immediate 
vicinity of a village let as high as L.3, 10s. There are farms of a mo- 
derate size above L.l, 10s. per acre at an average ; and there are 
others, fully a worse bargain, under a third of that charge. Rent 
is now generally paid in money, at two terms. In a few late agree- 
ments for leases, a limited portion, not exceeding a half, is allow- 
ed to fluctuate according to the fiar prices of victual. Servitudes, 
once very common, are now rarely exacted ; and what used to be 
a great and general grievance, when almost every estate was thirled 
or astricted to a particular mill, and obliged to pay a heavy as- 
sessment, usually from an eleventh to a sixteenth part of the 
whole grain crop with the exception of an allowance for seed and 
horse-corn, whether the produce was sold or ground, — is now hap- 
pily removed, the last of the multures having been converted Vast 
year. There are eight meal-mills, six of them with, and two of 
them without, drying kilns attached. Several of these, lately built, 
are on a pretty large scale, with granaries, large meal girnals, and 
a separate machinery for dressing pot-barley, so that the tenants 
of these mills are enabled to lay themselves out, not merely for 
working to the sucken and others who may require their services, 
but also for speculating a little themselves in the purchase of grain, 
and converting it into meal at their convenience, for a home or 
distant market. Instead of the miller receiving for workmanship, 
as was the practice till lately, a specified portion of the produce, 
the ordinary charge for drying and grinding oats is now sixpence 
per boll of meal. The only fuel employed to dry the grain is the 
sids or husks of what has formerly gone through the process. 
This, compared with the old usage, when all dried their victual 
at home, and were obliged to keep a kiln on the premises for the 
purpose, is a very economical arrangement in several respects. 

Agricultural Live-StocL—'No one has any thing like a flock of 
sheep, unless it be the proprietor of Pitfour, who has generally 
from 200 to 400 of various kinds, which are pastured upon the 
lawn and some contiguous grass fields. What the family do not 
require for their own use, are usually sold fat to butchers. There 
are a few Merinos and Bakewells ; but the ordinary animals to be 
tound about farm towns, or in the custody of crofters, are of mixed 
and miscellaneous breeds. The prevailing species of black-cattle 



[59 ABERDEENSHIllE. 

for vhich the district has obtained some celebrity, is dodded or 
humble, of good symmetry, rather above the middle s.ze, and upon 
the whole good milkers. Within the last dozen of years, the 1 ees- 
water has been introduced and propagated, pure  crosses to 
lonsiderable extent. The blending, of the two breeds has tended 
"uch 0 increase the size, though some allege to deteriorate the 
Zality of the stock. Of this, however, there is scarcely any 
doub that a great increase of carcase and value may be obtamed 
■ tot lnuJ fron a judicious mixture, and vah

Tu hw rdi removed, ax.d they can be sent direct to London oa

Xced to warrant any practical conclusion as to tle -.ablens

of the other, at Aden, are chiefly restricted, manufacture, on their 
own adventure, considerable quantities of the coarser sorts of 
woollen cloth, and of yarn for stockings. The number of hands 
of both sexes and of all ages, usually employed in the different de- 
partments of the work is about 30, receiving from 12s, to 13s. 
weekly of wages. This larger establishment has a dye-house and 
a waulk or fulling-mill. There are other two dyers in separate 
-tations possessed of similar mills, who tind pretty steady "and 
abundant employment from the country. 

Connected with manufactures, there are, in addition to such as 
work almost exclusively for people in the country, no fewer than 
about 47 persons, some male, some female, presently employ- 
ed, for the most part, in the village of Stewartfield, weaving 
linen yarn of different degrees of fineness, for the large house at 
Broadford, Aberdeen, which was erected by Mr Maberly, and now 
belongs to Messrs Richard and Co. As the hands are paid by 
the piece, they are not obliged to labour any precise number of 
hours a day. An expert and active individual would earn at the 
present rate of prices, about 6s, or 7s, in the space of ten or 
twelve hours. Were any change of circumstances to remove or 
greatly diminish this employment, many a poor villager and cot- 
tager, who derives from it a moderate livelihood, would be at a loss 
how to earn their bread. The state of the country, especially as 
it affects infirm or aged females, is altered much for the worse, 
by the introduction and extensive use of machinery for spinnino- 

No farther back than the beginning of 
the present century, any woman could have found more work in this 
way than it was in her power to accomplish, and, if she was tolera- 
bly acquainted with the business, could have won with ease, and 
ly a species of work well suited to the sex, from 3s. to 4s. a-week. 
Now, it requires no small interest to find even occasionally some- 
thmg to do in that line, and the allowance is scarcely a third of 
Nvhat it then was. This cause alone, though it stands not alone, 
might account for the increase of pauperism, and the proportion- 
ate demand on public charity. If those in better circumstances 
' ould devise means for procuring employment, and giving mode- 
 ate remuneration, to such as need and could profit by it, relief 
udmmistered in this form would be incomparably more serviceable 
than a dn-ect alms of the same value. It would do much to keep 
alive that honourable spirit.of industry and independence, so far 
" Independence consists in a desire not to be burdensome to others,

which has long adorned our peasantry, and been a fair feature of 
our national character. Associations of benevolent and patriotic 
individuals formed with this end in view at Elgin and m other 
places, are said to do much good at little expense.

1788, and the manse in 1832. The offices are of different ages. 
The stipend, as settled and modified by the proper court in 1824, 
consists of 16 chalders of victual, one-half barley Linlithgow 
measure, and the other half oatmeal, paid according to the fiar 
prices, which, whatever be the cause, are almost invariably for the 
county of Aberdeen, the lowest by far throughout- Scotland. The 
glebe is considerably above the statute and common size ; and, 
owing to the improvements it has received from the present in- 
cumbent and his predecessors, though in all probability the greater 
part of it some time ago was a profitless waste, might be let, si- 
tuate as it is, at from L. 40 to L. 50 a-year. 

A neat chapel, capable of containing about 700 sitters, was built 
in 1834 in the south-east extremity of New Deer, by which a por- 
tion of this parish lying to the south is so far accommodated, as 
well as part of New Deer, Ellon, and Tarves, comprehending al- 
together a population of at least 1500 souls, the nearest of whom 
to any other place of worship connected with the Establishment 
is distant between three and four miles. The expense of erec- 
tion was defrayed by subscriptions from the heritors and tenants 
of the district, collections from most of the churches belonging to 
the presbyteries of Deer and Ellon, and a liberal grant from the 
General Assembly's Committee on Church Extension. There 
is no debt upon the building; and the four clergymen whose pa- 
rishes are accommodated have agreed, with the assistance of a 
licensed preacher, to have in it every Sabbath the regular order 
of public service, until some better provision than a small sum 
arising from seat rents, the only revenue at present, can be ob- 
tained for the settlement and support of an ordained clergyman 
specially invested with a pasto'ral charge. The collections are 
appropriated to the benefit of the poor. 

Another chapel was contracted for and built in 1837, on the south 
extremity of Lonmay, and near the north boundary of this parish, 
from resources similar to those above specified, for the accommo- 
dation of the most remote inhabitants of Strichen, and of the 
other two parishes just named.

aiid four miles distant from the others. The two last established, 
at Shannas and Clochcan, had for a few years a teaching apart- 
ment and other accommodations provided for them voluntarily by 
the heritors and people, and a small salary each from the General 
Assembly's Committee on Highland Schools. The land-owners, 
however, much to their credit, at the last adjustment of salary in 
terms of the Act 1802, not only agreed to give the maximum sa- 
lary required, in the case of there being more schools than one 
established in a parish, L. 51 and odds, but have since, of their 
own accord, very generously assessed themselves for L. 20 more, 
in order to bring the two worst provided teachers within reach of 
getting the benefit of the Dick Bequest. The original, and what 
may be considered as the principal, teacher, from the site of the 
school being at Old Deer, has L. 31, 6s. 7d. of yearly salary, and 
each of the other two L. 20. The number of scholars fluctuates 
accordmg to the season of the year and other circumstances, from 
40 to 100 at each. The school-fees actually collected average 
about L 30, and the teachers have hitherto received nearer L. 30 
than L. 20 from the Trustees of the late Mr Dick. There are 
other two parochial schools, the one at Mintlaw in Longside, and 
the other at Denhead in Lonmay, that lie contiguous to, and 
accommodate, certain districts of this parish. There is also a 
teacher, whose school is well attended and well taught, settled 
some years ago, with a small salary furnished by the representatives 
of one of the heritors, and some of the principal tenants, on the 
west boundary between Old and New Deer, about one-half of the 
scholars being from this parish. And in the village of Stewartfield, 
there is seldom wanting a person who keeps a school on his own 
adventure, without receiving any other remuneration for his services 
than what arises from fees. Different females, here and there, 
receive girls and children to be taught needle-work with reading:

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Upon the whole, we conceive, that within the last forty years, 
great improvements have been made upon the value, comfort, and 
aspect of the country. In course of that period, the two great 
lines of communication by turnpike roads have been opened up, 
several other useful roads have been formed anew or greatly re- 
paired, — much barren land has been brought into cultivation, — a 
greatly improved system of husbandry introduced,— mill-multures 
with thirlage to mills abolished, — more attention paid to the selec- 
tion and breeding of live-stock, — leases of moderate duration sub- 
stituted for liferent tenures, — a greater facility of market provided 
for farm produce, — and a more liberal allowance granted by pro- 
prietors generally to their tenants for houses, fences, and drainage, 
— while they themselves, in consequence of improvements made by 
themselves or their tenantry, the changed value of money, and an ex- 
cessive competition for tenements, when encouragement or opportu- 
nity is afforded for it, — have had their rent-rolls greatly increased. 
The actual state of the different properties in the parish in this re- 
spect, at present, has not been ascertained; but, reasoningfrom known 
facts, there can be little doubt that, if the ground in the natural oc- 
cupation of the heritors were fairly let, the gross rental would exceed 
by about a half in sterling money, the old Scotch valuation of 
L.7127, 16s. 8d. Nor is there a less marked alteration in the 
dress, diet, furniture, and manners of almost every class of the 
people. Whether the real piety, virtue, and happiness of the com- 
munity have progressed in the same ratio, may well be questioned.

yearly increasing patches of arable land. In the north district of 
the parish, the soil is much better, and there are several well cul- 
tivated farms. 

Live-StocL — A great number of cattle chiefly of the Aber- 
deenshire breed are reared and fed in this parish, many of which 
grow to a very considerable size. There are also some fine horses 
reared. Scarcely any sheep are reared ; and few are fed, except 
on the lawns of Fintray House and Disblair. 

Zoologrj,—¥ovmev\ the river Don abounded with salmon and 
very fine trout ; but the cruives and dam-dikes, erected by manu- 
facturing companies in the parishes of Old Machar and Newhills, 
have almost ruined the fishings; and have given rise to many dis- 
putes between the upper heritors and manufacturing companies. 
Hares and partridges are in abundance ; but no rare species of ani- 
mals are found. 

Fw«rf.— Upwards of 600 acres of the surface of the parish are 
covered with wood, of various ages and kinds, and all in a thriv- 
ing condition.

Heritors.~The principal heritor of this parish is Sir John For- 
bes, Bart, of Craigievar, who is patron of the parish, proprietor 
of somewhat more than the half of it, and the only residing heri- 
tor. The other heritors are, the Earl of Fife ; Mr Ramsay of 
Barra; and the Rev. Dr Morison of Disblair,— who have lands of 
considerable extent and value; also General Benjamin Forbes of 
Balbithan ; and William Gordon Gumming Skene, Esq. of Pit- 
lurg and Dyce, who have small properties in this parish. The 
rental of the parish is supposed to be nearly L. 5000 Sterling 
The valued rent is L. 3007, 8s. 4d. Scots. 

Antiquities.—TiQre are two cairns in the parish, but their ori- 
gin IS unknown. The present minister when improving his glebe 
dug up the foundations of some buildings, supposed to have be- 
longed to the Abbacy of Lindores, in Fife ; a branch of which is 
said to have stood where the principal burjing ground of this pa- 
rish now ,s ; m which burying ground, a vault of extraordinary 
strength was built a few years ago by the parishioners, to se- 
cure dead bodies from resurrectionists; from whence, after re- 
gaining perhaps three months or more, the bodiesare removed

ombankments, which had been erected a few years before, some of 
which withstood, while others yielded to the impetuosity of the tor- 
rent, the whole crop on the most valuable lands in the parish must 
have been completely destroyed. A great part of the haugh-land is 
now protected by embankments, on the lands of Fintray and Wester 
Fintray, extending to upwards of 6000 ells in length, and pro- 
tecting from 200 to 300 Scotch acres of very fine rich land, from 
the river floods. 

Parochial Eeffisters. — The oldest record belonging to the kirk- 
session begins on 25th May 1662 ; but only fragments thereof 
remain, scarcely legible, and all in loose sheets. With the ex- 
caption of the register of baptisms, which appears to be pretty com- 
plete since the year 1728, the registers of this parish are rather 
defective. Minutes appear to have been keptj, but seldom en- 
tered in a bound book, previously to the year 1795 — since which 
time regular records have been kept. 

III. — Population. 

In 1790 the population was 920 
1811, by the census, 892 
1821, . . 996 

1831, . . 1046— viz. 519 males, 527 fetiiales, 
1839, . . 1012 

The decrease between 1790 and 181 1 seems to have been owing 
to two or more small farms having been occasionally thrown into 
one. 

The average number of births in this parsh for the last seven 
years is 26 per annum ; of deaths, 13; of marriages, 13. The 
, number of families, by census of 1831 was 225 ; inhabited houses, 
215 ; fatuous persons, 2. 

Number of illegitimate births during the last three years 6. 
_ Character, Sfc. of the People.— The people, in general, are ac- 
tive and industrious, and, with a very few exceptions, they are tem- 
perate. They enjoy, in a moderate degree, the comforts and ad- 
vantages of society. 

IV. — Industry. 

Number of imperial acres in the parish, cultivated or occasionally in 

tillage, betwixt . . . 50OO and 6000 

never cultivated, and remaining constantly 

waste or in pasture, about , , 800 

» J TIT "nder wood, betwixt . . 600 and 700 

Produce.—Move than three-fourths of the population depend 
tor employment and subsistence on agricultural concerns. The 
chief productions of the parish are oats, bear sometimes barley 
pease, hay, potates, and turnip, of which latter crop a very con- 



170 ABERDEENSHIRK- 

siderable breadth is sown annually, the soil being particularly 
adapted to turnip husbandry. , „ , . 

iens.- Arable land rents from 15s. to L.2, 15s. per acre, ac- 
cording to its quaUty ;-average about L. 1, 5s. per acre. 

There is a very considerable extent of barren ground in the 
lands both of Fintray and Wester Fintray, which -'gt be -n- 
dered useful by being either cultivated or planted. A".'' 
dicious improvements of draining and inclosing, which Sir John 
Forbes has introduced on his lands, and which are being earned 
on partly by himself and partly by his tenants, will, it is to be hop- 
ed', cause the barren district of the parish to present a more cheer- 
ing aspect at no distant period. For, notwithstanding the clamours | 
of agricultural distress, improvements were never carried on here 
with greater spirit than at present. 

Fafm-houses and offices have been greatly improved in appear- 
ance within the last forty years, and the occupantsare much better 
rlnthed. and fed, and lodged. I 
TJal -The general duration of leases is nineteen years-a 
space too short for encouraging an enterprising tenant to lay out 
hi capital on improvements, with any reasonable prospect of ad-j 

"Sto the agricultural population may be mentioned trades- 
men of various crafts, who reside in the parish, such as 4 black- 
Tmiths- 4 masons; 8 carpenters; 4 tailors ; 6 shoemakers ; o 
m llers 2 sawyers; 1 watchmaker or mechanic, and 4 shopkeepers : 
loun ting in all to about 36, independently of their families. 

Zn./L....-The only manufacture this parish is that 
fine woollen cloth, by the Messrs Crombie, Cothal AWls, . 
was begun about the year 1798, under a different --l 
been carried on since that period without intermission. Mr John 
cTmbie has conducted it since 1806. It produces, on an ave- 
, " fL 7500 to 8000 yards per annum, of the value of from 
Us to 24s. per yard. This branch of business, princpally owing 

ThpL difficulties have been overcome here, by encouraging Eng

in 



perform the operative parts. The advantages which attend the 
manufacture of cloths here, are a plentiful supply of excellent 
water, and a powerful waterfall, which saves the expenses of steam- 
power. Wages are also lower here than in manufacturing districts 
where provisions are high. Considerable encouragement has been 
given to this manufactory by the Board of Trustees for the En- 
couragement of Manufactures in Scotland, who have annually 
given considerable premiums, in the gaining of which the Messrs 
. Crombie have been very successful. 

Since the year 1836, a branch of manufacture has sprung up 
in the south of Scotland, which has had the effect of considerably 
decreasing the consumpt of fine cloths throughout the kingdom. 
The article alluded to is plaid, or what is now more usually de- 
nominated " tweed." The managers at Cothal Mills, finding that 
their clothing machines were particularly well adapted to the ma- 
nufacture of this article, by working finer wools than were gene- 
rally used for these goods, soon produced stuffs that found a ready 
market in London as well as in Scotland. The consequence has 
been, that, from the steady demand, they have been enabled to 
double their production, and of course the number of hands has 
been increased. 

V. — Parochial EcoNOMy. 
Market- Totvi, c-c— Fintray is distant from Aberdeen, the 
nearest market-town, from eight to thirteen miles; from six to 
seven of which miles are turnpike, and the rest good commutation 
roads. The road from Keith-hall to Aberdeen divides the parish 
into nearly two equal parts. 

Ecclesiastical State.~The present church of Fintray was built 
m 1821, and is neat, substantial, and commodious. It is the only 
place of worship in the parish. It is about equally distant from 
the east and west boundaries of the parish, but much nearer to the 
south boundary than the north. It would accommodate nearly 
800 persons, having been purposely built large, to meet an increase 
of population. It is divided among the heritors in the proportion 
of their valued rents ; the heritors subdivide it among their tenants, 
and no seat-rents are demanded or paid. The average number of 
communicants is about 450. The congregation, on an ordinary 
babbath and favourable day, may be reckoned a full half of the 
gross population. There are only a few Dissenters in the parish, 
='nd not one of these is a native of the parish ; almost the whole 
i them belong to the Cothal Mills' Manufactory. 



172 ABERDEENSHIRE. 

The present manse was built in 1804. The glebe measures 
nearly 6 acres, about two of which were reclaimed by the pre- 
sent incumbent from barren ground ; and the greater part of the 
glebe both old and new is land of inferior value. 

The stipend consists of sixteen chalders of victual, the one-half 
meal, the other half barley, payable by the fiar prices of the county, 
together with L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. 

Schools -There are two schools in the parish, besides two Sabbath 
schools, one of them conducted by the minister, viz. the parochial, 
which is well situated for the southern the more popoulous district 
of the parish ; and a school, built and endowed by the proprietor 
of Disblair, for the accommodation of the northern district. The 
parochial teacher enjoys a school-house, with two small rooms or 
his own accommodation, a salary of L. 28 Sterling and a quarter 
of an acre of garden ground. Average number of scholars from 
60 to 70, and school-fees may amount to L. 20 per annum The 
teacher of the other school receives as salary, the interest of L. 200, 
mortified for that purpose by the Rev. Dr Morison, proprietor of 
Disblair, together with a school-house, dwelling-house, and gar- 
den for a nominal rent of 5s. per annum. Number of scholars 
from 40 to 50. School-fees may, perhaps, amount to L.lo or 
L.16 per annum. The teacher officiates as precentor, and re- 
ceives L. 3 per annum. , • , i i .j 
The branches usually taught in the parochial school are lead 
ina - writing, arithmetic, Latin, now seldom reqmred, English 
.rlmmar, geography, mensuration, mathematics and sometimes 
foolkeeping. Most of the above branches are also taught at the 
school at Disblair. School-fees vary from 2s. 6d. to 5s. per quai- 
er according to the branches taught, but they are often not re- 
The Dick bequest to the parochial school mas ers

wife, who had practised the begging trade in Aberdeen before her 
marriage, he preferred the latter. The average number of persons 
receiving parochial relief, may vary from 20 to 25, receiving from 
L. 1 to L. 3, 10s. per annum. The annual amount of funds 
under the management of the kirk-session may be reckoned from 
L. 60 to L. 65 per annum, burdened with the expense of the ses- 
sion, precentor, beadle, &amp;c. in all about L. 5, arising from week- 
ly collections in the church, L. 40 to L. 45, interest of L. 220 ; 
donations from non-residing heritors, pall-dues and other casual- 
ties. Besides the weekly collections for the ordinary poor, annual 
collections, of very considerable amount, are made for the Infir- 
mary and Lunatic Asylum at Aberdeen ; and a collection was late- 
ly made in aid of the Indian mission. 

The poor of this parish owe a large debt of gratitude to Sir 
John and the Honourable Lady Forbes of Craigievar, who, of late 
years, have given several donations ; among which may be men- 
tioned one of L. 20, and another of L. 10, for the immediate re- 
lief of the poor, besides their very liberal collections in the church 
on ordinary Sundays: and well-judged supplies of clothing, coal, 
meal, and other things, to the more necessitous, during the incle- 
ment season of the year. 

It is but justice to the poor of this parish, to say, that few ap- 
ply for parochial aid, before they stand in actual need of it; and 
in some cases, it has been necessary to press it urgently and repeat- 
edly before it was accepted. At the same time, it cannot be de- 
nied, that some few have been found of a contrary disposition. 
Subscriptions are sometimes successfully made for an individual, 
or family, who have met with any misfortune. 

A blacksmith, who died in this parish some years ago, be- 
queathed to,the kirk-session, L. 70 Sterling ; the interest of L.40 
to be applied to the education of poor children ; and the interest 
ot L. 30, towards the clothing of aged and indigent females belono-- 
ing to and residing in the parish. These small funds are useftil 
at the present time. And another blacksmith, in like manner, dis- 
poned to the kirk-session, feu-duties to the annual value of L.IO 
13s. 6d., for charitable purposes in this parish; to take effect, un- 
aer the eye of the kirk-session, upon the death of certain persons 
named m the disposition. Poor rates are happily unknown and 
unnecessary here,

PRESBYTERY OF DEEK, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. JAMES WELSH, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — New Deer was originally a part of the ancient parish 
of Deer, from which it was disjoined not long after the Revolution. 
It is termed in the ancient records AucUreddy, from the name of 
the land in which the church is situated. This name is engraved 
on the communion cups and plates, with the date 1694. Like 
other Scottish names, it is of Gaelic origin, as are many other 
names in the parish, such as Auchoach, Auchmaliddy, Auchna- 
gatt, Atichmunziel. 

Extent, Sfc. — It is one of the largest parishes in the county of 
Aberdeen. Its greatest length from north to south is upwards of 
14 miles. Its greatest breadth from east to west upwards of 8 
miles. Its contents upwards of 50 square miles. 

Boundaries. — It is bounded on the north, by the parishes of Stri- 
chen, Tyrie, and Aberdour; on the west, by the parishes of King 
Edward, Monquhitter, Methlic, and Tarves ; on the south, by the 
parish of Ellon ; on the east, by the parish of Old Deer. 

Topographical Appearances.— W\th the exception of the hill of 
Mormond, New Deer is the highest ground in Buchan. No part 
of U, however, rises higher than 200 or 300 feet above the level 
of the sea. From the hill of Culsh, in the neighbourhood of the 
village, may be seen in a clear day the spire of Peterhead, about 
, eighteen miles distant to the eastward. And, looking west, may 
be seen Bennachie, about twenty-five or twenty-eight miles off 
the Foudland Hills, the hills in the neighbourhood of Banff and 
buln and Benrinnis, in the county of Moray. The elevation 
't the hill of Cross Gight is rather higher than that of Culsh 
gdrographg.-Theve are no streams that deserve the name 
ot rivers ,n this parish, the country being in general flat and all 
■auie. It will give some idea of its elevation to .mention that 



]76 ADERDliENSIIiaE. 

branches of three rivers, running in three different directions, take 
their rise in the north part of this parish, not far from each 
other. One of tUem flows eastward towards the Ugie, passnig Old 
Deer, and entering the German Ocean north of Peterhead. 
Another flows westward, and joins a stream that ftdls into the De- 
veron, which empties itself into the Moray Fnth at Banff. A 
thn-d flows south-westward, and joins the Ythan near G.ght, wluch 
falls into the German Ocean at the Newburgh. All these three 

are but small streams. . , 

Thomh New Deer is in the centre of a circle seventeen or eight- 
een mile distant from the sea on three sides, yet from its elevation 
the cTi mate is cold ; the snow lies long, and often delays the opera- 
t ons of husbandry. The south and west winds 
thev are more violent than the east or north. ";'S»."";'' 
mate is cold, it is dry and healthy, and the inhabitants hve to a 
meat age, many exceeding eighty or ninety years. 
 Thfp evading distempers are inflammatory complaints, arising 
probably from the people using too much oatmeal. Scrofula, too 
fs ery com-on, as also are consumptions and .g--lhsh comphnnt . 

Soil -The soil in general, vith few exceptions, is light and shal- 
low It would answewell for agriculture it U were not for the ch- 
mite and the subsoil. A great proportion of the parish rests on a 
tod rocky pan of from 6 inches to 2 feet thick, which prevent 
A surface water from sinking into the earth, and keeps the sod 
let tn the sun evaporates the moisture. This pan prevents trees 
Tom thriving and cLing to any size. Attempts have been mad , 
and in some'cases successfully, to break up this pan, and give the 

"trrpaL-'S:: coarse day, on otl.rs it is 

rr,h fcoarse granite. Lime of indifferent quality is found in 
r nd of Ban'rck' The farmers quarry it for themselves, and 
'burn it either for building or tor putting - J,  'w,,,,.

II.__CiviL History. 
The materials for the history of this parish are very scanty. 



NEW DEER. 



77 



inhabitants are a primitive race of people, and in many respects as 
far advanced in civilization as their neighbours. They have but 
small encouragement for improvement, as there are no resident heri- 
tors to set them an example. Dr Mavor, a celebrated compiler of 
voyages, travels, &amp;c. was a native of this parish, being born in the  
land of Culsh. 

Heritors. — There are nine heritors; of these only two have 
houses in the parish, and reside there occasionally. The heritors 
are, The Earl of Aberdeen ; Mr D. Dingwall of Brucklaw ; Mr Gor- 
don of Cairnbanno and New Deer ; Mr Gordon of Nethermuir, 
Mr Dingwall Fordyce of Culsh; Captain Ferguson of Pitfour; ' 
Mr Forbes Irvine of Schivas ; the Trustees of Mr Gordon of 
Murtle ; and the Trustees of the late Mr Simpson of Colleyhill. 
The proprietors of Brucklaw and Nethermuir have residences in 
the parish. 

Parochial Registers.— The session records commence 1705. A 
portion of them, from 1727 to 1734, is lost. Since that period they 
have been regularly kept; and the old practice is still continued 
of entering each Sunday the text and the name of the minister 
who preaches. 

Antiquities.— Theve are, or rather there were, many remains of " 
Druidjcal temples and funeral monuments, to be seen in the parish 
One of them, about a mile north of the village, still retains the name 
of the Standing Stones of Culsh, though the stones stand there no 
longer, havmg been taken away, about seventy years ago, to build the 
old manse. There are occasionally found many tumuli, which, when 
opened, contain urns of baked clay, filled with human bones and 
ashes. Not long ago, a farmer in the neighbourhood of the vil- 
Jage, in improving a piece of ground, dug up six of these. These 
urns had neither top nor bottom. They were like chimney cans 

bLefand asC ' "

rate now a complete ruin. Nearly all the best stones have been

IV. — Industry. 

The parish is entirely an agricultural parish, and all the inhabi- 
tants are in some way or other engaged in this occupation. The farms, 
in general, are small ; many of them mere crofts ; and consequent- 
ly, they are managed by the farmer's family. 

The contents of the parish in imperial acres are as under, be- 
longing to the respective heritors.

The first column contains the nine heritors ; the second and third 
columns, the land always in regular crop ; the fourth column is pas- 
ture, partly green and wet, and partly heather and dry; the fifth 
column IS moss or heather, and has once been in cultivation, as ap- 
pears from the marks of ridges throughout it. The sixth column 
IS the moss used for fuel, which, when not broken up, is pastured. 
The seventh column is young planted wood, generally larches and 
Scotch firs. The only part of this that appears to be thriving is 
some planted fifteen years ago near Brucklaw. The fifth and sixth 
columns are diminishing by being taken into cultivation.

The above items of produce were obtained by actual inquiry at 
the respective farmers. Of the 179891 quarters of oats, not 
more than one-fifth can be reckoned as of first quality — that is, 
there are 3597 quarters of oats of first quality, the remainder, 
14392 quarters, are of second quality. The land of Krucklaw to 
the extent of 1 00 acres is laid out in grass, and let for pasture. In 
Artamford there are 55 acres of similar description ; in Nether- 
muir 40 acres ; and in Little Auchreddy 40 acres. Rent about 
L.2, 5s. per acre.

It lies on the ridge of a hill, and the fields decline to 
the el f and to the west of the street. It is situated nearly at an 
Pnual distance from Banff on the north-west ; Fraserburgh on the 
Xh-eS Peterhead on the east; and the Newburgh on the south. 
It is distant from Aberdeen nearly north thirty miles. 

Means of Communication.-Theve is a daily post from Aber- 
deen, through Methlic, and the communication is earned on 
to Strichen, Peterhead, and New Pitshgo, and Banff. There 
are nearly 100 miles of roads in the pansh ; a good road 
reat pa t of the way from New Deer to Ellon, distant thirteen 
mile .' The turnpiklroad from Peterhead to Banff crosses thj 
pa Ih ; and a mail-coach regularly travels from Peterhead t 
BaTff, and returns the same day. There is a stage-coach tW 
a-week from Aberdeen to New and Old Deer and Strichenj

To accommodate the people at the south of the parish, and 
parts of the neighbouring parishes of Old Deer, Ellon, Tarves, 
and a small portion of Methlic, a chapel has been erected at the 
cost of about L. 700, calculated to seat 700 persons ; but no mi- 
nister has been yet appointed for want of funds. It is regularly 
.supplied with divine worship by the ministers of New Deer, Old 
Deer, Ellon, Tarves, and Methlic. 

There are three Dissenting meeting-houses belonging to the 
United Secession in the parish. They were all established there 
before the time of the present incumbent. The ministers are paid 
by voluntary contribution, some of them L.70 or L.80, and some- 
times less. 

In the north part of the parish those who are at a distance from 
the parish church are accommodated at the chapels of ease at New 
Byth and New Pitsligo.

Education.~Thevere three parochial schools, endoved wlth the 
minimum salary each. The parochial school m the K.rktoyn is 
in very bad repair, and the heritors will donothmg to renew it not 
conceiving themselves obliged by the late act of Parhament. The 
branches taught in the three parochial schools are, readmg, writ- 
ing, arithmetic, book-keeping, Latnn, Greek, mathematics. Some 
of these are but rarely required. The salary of each o the school- 
masters is L.21, 7s. 9d. The amount of the school-fees of all 
three is L. 62, 9s. lOd. One of them as session-clerk has in per- 

''Thereafe' also six private schools on the teachers' own adven- 
ture, two of them taught by females. The common branches of 
education are taught in them. 

In addition to their other emoluments, the three parochial 
teachers derive from L. 20 to L. 30 each annually from a mortifi- 
cation made by the late Mr Dick of Forres.

tolerable manner. The people in general wish to earn, but their 
poverty compels them to remove their children during the busy 
season from school, and put them to labour. 

Lihrarv.-ThexB is a library kept in the village; the books are 
in circulation among the members, and exchanged once a month. 

Poor —There are between 70 and 80 persons on the poor s roll, 
and every prospect of the number increasing. They receive from 6s 
to L. 1 a quarter, and some of them 2s. 6d. a-week. The fund to 
supply this expense arises from the interest of L.700 stock and tl 
weekly collections, the latter amounting to upwards of L. 50 per 
annum. There are other incidents, as the proceeds of a mort- 
cloth, and occasional contributions from some of the heritors, and 
other individuals. I am sorry to see that the disposition among Ue 
poor to resort to parochial relief is increasmg. The Dissenters 
contribute little or nothing to the support of the poor. A change

of the law compelling them to support their own poor would be very 
desirable. 

Fairs. — There are five fairs held in the village annually. One 
in April ; a feeing market in May ; and a market in June ; one in 
October, and a feeing market in November ; at all these, horses, 
cattle, sheep, &amp;c. are exposed to sale. 

Inns. — There are three inns in the village. Two of them prin- 
cipal ones. Spirits are also sold by most of the retailers of tea and 
tobacco. These, however, through the whole parish, do not ex- 
ceed eight or nine. 

Fuel. — The fuel principally used is peat, procured from the 
neighbouring mosses, at the cost of about Is. 9d. a cart load.

PRESBYTERY OF DEER, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. JAMES ANDERSON, A. M. MINISTER. 



I.— Topography and Natural History. 
Name.—Tnis parish was formerly named Langley, and ori- 
ginally Inverugie. It assumed its present designation in the year 
1616; but for what special reasons cannot be accurately ascertain- 
ed, though it would, appear to have been intended as a compliment 
to the memory of its ancient patron saint. 

_ Situation, Boundaries, Exteni.-TUs parish, though locally 
situated m Aberdeenshire, belongs to the county of Banff, to which 
It was annexed at a very early period by an act of Legislature, ob- 

amed through the influence of the Cheynes, the ancient proprie- 
tors, who, bemg the hereditary sheriffs of Banff, were naturally 
very desirous to have their own domains placed under their own 
jurisdiction. But its connection with the county of Banff is now 
recognized m no other way than by the payment of the ordinary 

K ''°""'r '' Ccean; on the 

outfi, by the river Ugie; on the north, by the parish of Crimond • 
and on the west, by the parish of Longside. Its extreme length is 
Its greatest breadth 3 miles. Its superficial extent 
aoout 12 square miles. 

Topographical Appearances.The sea beach is flat and sandy.

It forms, as 'justly described in tlie fornner Statistical Account 
« two segments of a circle-the one, beginning at the raou h of 
the Ugioera.i„ates at Scotstown Craig, and the other extends 
from there to Rattra,-head." A strong natural J-P °« 
connected clay hills, elevated by the accumulat,on of dnft sand 
and thickly covered «ith,bent grass, d.v.des the shore from he 
knd and is of vast consequence in provent.ng the blow.ng of the 
stnd by strong easterly winds. Along this Ime, but of var,o,,s 
Teadth, uns a plain of the finest downs or links perhaps tn Scot- 
hnd affordin.. excellent pasture tor sheep and young cattle and ca- 
p i al'gt nd for the golf-player, though perhaps rather too level for 
T lovers of a hazardous game. The lower part of the parish, to 
the extent of a mile from the shore, presents a flat appearance, 
tnr whence it gradually rises in elevation towards the western ex- 
mfny beajtifu, undnlations. There is no elevatron 
in the'parish which merits the designation of a h 11, it we except 
an emiLnce of inconsiderable height in the vicinity of Inverugie 
CastTe, known by the name of the Castle-Mll. Though naked ,n 
wfnt r from the general absence of trees, the parish presents to the 
lee the strang'er entering it from the south, m —'f' 
Iv and inviting aspeet-by exhibiting one ""f =" PJ °'

Tad, Ire the only land which has not yet yielded to the conquest 

°' :tt-CU.aU.-fr. its proximity to the .a, and the 
retentive quiditj of the soil, the climate of this pa ish is ratter 
cand damp.' Of late years the springs been ess ™ld nd 
the winters less severe, than they are reported to have b en in o 
mer times. Here it may be truly said m the language of the poet, 

" Spring is but the cliild 

Of chudish winter in her froward moods _ 

Discovering much the temper of her sire. _ 

The mean range of the thermometer in summer is from 52 to 
1 he mean rang Fahrenheit's scale ; and that 

57°, and m wmter from 38 to 48 on ra  . 

of the barometer, in summer, from 29.49 to 29 a 
from 29.40 to 29.47. The autumnal f-sts for jl  
years have not set in so early or with \er 
Ihat period. Formerly, the growth S' 'I'l' \ .e 
was generally lost in winter; the ten «  ow

quent alternations of the weather, it does not appear that there are 
any diseases which may strictly be called endemic in the parish, 
nor are the inhabitants less healthy than in the more inland parts 
of the country, though strangers coming to reside in it with a pre- 
disposition to rheumatic and stomach complaints are generally 
backward to bear testimony to the salubrity of its climate. There 
were twenty-four individuals lately living upwards of .eighty years 
of age; and one man, in his eighty-eighth year, is able to attend 
to the business of a small farm, and to walk to church almost every 
Sabbath from a distance of more than two miles. One man died in 
1835 aged ninety-six. The writer's maternal grandfather, who 
died in 1810, aged ninety-three, officiated as an elder at the dis- 
pensation of the Lord's Supper in this parish in that year. The 
oldest person now living in the parish is a woman aged ninety-two. 

The prevailing winds are, the north, north-east, and north-west. 
The north -west is of all others to which we are exposed the most 
destructive to vegetation. It would tend much to meliorate the 
climate, and to ensure an earlier and less precarious vegetation, if 
the west and north-west boundaries of the parish were skirted with 
a broad selvage of planting. It is needless to hint what an acqui- 
sition this would be to our tame scenery,- and, whilst it gave a 
more imposing aspect to the landscape, it would impart additional 
value to the soil. It is to be hoped, when the opportunity of en- 
tertammg this proposition is afforded by the expiry of the present 
leases, that it will meet with due attention in the proper quarter. 

Hydrography.— The Ugie is the only stream of water in the 
parish which deserves the name of a river. It consists of two 
branches called the North and the South Ugie, which unite in 
the parish of Longside ; from whence it flows in one channel alono- 
he south boundary of St Fergus to the ocean. In the upper dist 
tricts 0 the parish, in dry summers, there is often a scarcity of 
water for cattle. In the lower district there are several excellent 
perennial springs. A few are chalybeate, but none of a very 
strong impregnation. About forty years ago, a canal was cut at a 
great expense along the south side of the parish. The then pro- 
prietor had contemplated its extension to Peterhead, in order to 
open up a water-carriage from that port to different parts of his 
extensive estates in Old Deer, Longside, and St Fergus; but 
meeting with some difficulties in effecting the necessary arrange-

At era" Ewen, granite of a binary compound predominates, w. h 
very 1 Me quartz, and where there is a vein cutting the native bed, 
whfoh are'y occurs, it is of a compact felspar of a very deep red, 
occasionally manifesting a great tendency to decomposition. 
Thp soil in the neighbourhood is clayey. 

The rocks at Scotstown Head, which are only accessible at low 
water consist of granite, gneiss, trap, quartz, and primitive lime- 
Tton The gneiss and granite appear frequently in close and 
loarable union. The granite varies in appearance as rt comes

cent origin. It contains the remains of oak, hazel, and birch 
trees, which the greatest care cannot now induce to take a liking 
to our soil. Some pieces of oak, dyed black by the oxide of iron, 
and susceptible of a beautiful polish, have occasionally been dug 
up, and aiplied to ornamental purposes. About thirty years ago, 
several antlers of large and full-grown stags were found imbedded 
in a bank of .moss. It is quite evident that the lower part of the 
parish had at some distant period been submerged by the sea. 
The substratum of the soil consists of sand intermixed with the 
remains of marine testacea. There are indications along the 
coast that the land has been gaining upon the sea. 

Zoology. — Qiiadrupeds. There are no rare animals found in 
this parish. About three years ago, the hedgehog  Erinaceus 
EuropcBus,J which was not before known to have had a locum te 
liens in this district, was discovered in St Fergus, on the farm of 
Nether Hill. The otter has long had a home on the banks of 
the Ugie. Rabbits are of late introduction, but they have mul- 
tiplied to a prodigious extent in the Links, and do incalculable 
damage to the crops in the neighbourliood. Indeed, the increase 
of the common hare is here found to be a serious evil to the 
farmer. 

Birds. — Under this section the parish presents little that could 
be peculiarly interesting to the naturalist. Within these few 
years, and in consequence, as is supposed, of the persecution to 
which he was exposed in his ancient domicile at Pitfour, the rook 
{Corvusfrvgilegus has sought and found an asylum in St Fergus. 
He has paid a compliment to the trees at Lunderton, sufficiently 
flattering to the gentleman who planted them, by the institution 
. of a rookery there, and, from this circumstance, has perhaps ex- 
perienced greater forbearance than his intrusion was otherwise 
entitled to. If it be true, however, as has been often averred, 
that what a cat is to a housewife, the rooks are to the farmer, by 
destroying worms and insects, it may yet be problematical on 
which side the balance of obligation lies. 

At Lunderton, also, may be seen, in a state of partial domesti- 
cation, the water hen {Fulica cliloropus. There are two, some- 
times four or more, birds. They frequent a marsh in the vicinity 
during the season of incubation, but mingle at other times with 
the common poultry in the court-yard, and partake of their fare. 

Fishes — In the neighbouring ocean are to be found turbot 
{ fleuronectes maximus ; sole {Solea vulgaris. There is reason

to believe that these are abundant, but, having no nets proper fof 
the purpose, the fishermen seldom catch them. Lmg  Molva

Raia hatis; haddock  Morhua JEcjhfinm; whitmg  Merlangus

Scomber vulgaris; common cod  Morhua vulgaris At Rat- 
tray Head, at the extremity of the coast belongmg to this parish, 
a variety of the common cod is caught, well known by the pro- 
vincial name of the Rattray cod. It is of a reddish colour, and is 
prized as a great delicacy by those who are fond of fish Among 
the rocks at'Scotstown and Craig Ewen the parten crab Cancer 
pagurus is plentifully found. In the Ugie are the salmon  Salmo 
salarj- bull-trout C -b'a/mo mox;, very rare ; fiuuock {Salmo albus ; 
sea-tro'ut f Salmo trutta ; common burn-trout Salmo fario ; 
minnow  Leuciscus phoxinus ; common eel {Anguilla vulgaris ; 
fresh water flounder {Platessa Jluviatilis. In the Ugie the pearl 
mussel  Mya margaritifera is abundant, but the pearls found are 
seldom of much value, being of a dark hue and only partially t.-ans- 
parent.- British pearls must have been in great impute at one

Insects, Sj-c. — The insects most destructive to vegetation in this 
parish, so far as the observation of the writer extends, are the 
Limax agrestis, or grub-worm, the Papilio napi, the Tipula tritici, 
and common caterpillar ; seldom a summer passes in which the 
gooseberry bushes do not suffer severely from the ravages of these 
larvse. The only remedy which has been found efficient in this 
neighbourhood, is to water the bushes in the evening, and imme- 
diately after to dust the under part of the' leaves with hot lime 5 
but this must be done as soon as the eggs are discovered. There 
is a disease called seggirig or bushing, to which the braird of oats 
in this parish is very liable on highly cultivated land ; and which 
is evidently occasioned by some insect, though its distinctive charac- 
ter has not been ascertained. . The Curciilio pini; from the rava- 
ges of this insect, and the clay subsoil, the larch tree has never 
thriven in this parish. The Curculio pyri is often seen on the 
wall trees in the manse garden. 

Botany.— In a parish where the plough holds such an extensive 
dommion the Flora cannot be expected to be very interesting. The 
followmg is a list of such plants as seem deserving of being enu- 
merated in a work of this kind. 

_ Anemone nemorosa, only in one location, on the banks of the 
Ugie, nearly opposite to Raven's Craig; Arenaria peploides ; 
BotrychiumLunaria; Chrysosplenium oppositifolium ; Corijdalis 
claviculata; Drosera longifilia, rare, the only location with which 
the writer is acquainted is in the moss lying between St Fergus 
and Crimond; Echium vulgare, very rare, only one plant having 
been discovered some years ago on the farm of Ednic. which had 
most probably been introduced among seed corn from England,' 
Juphrasia officinalis, most abundant; Gentiana amarella and 
campestns, the latter very abundant; Geum urhanum, rare, found

Maps and Plans.— There is an unpublished map of the parish,

Papers and Documents.~The writer is not aware of the existence 
of any thing under this head which would tend to illustrate the 
history of the parish, with the exception of some old leases granted 
by the last Earl Marischal, from which no other fact of importance 
can be gathered, but that wheat was more generally cultivated in 
bt Fergus at that period than it is now. There is also an old 
paper m the session- chest, under the hand of the same nobleman, 
authorizing his chamberlain to repay the kirk-session, out of his 
rents from the lands of Fortree in Longside, the money advanced 
by them for causewaying a part of the public road. There are 
other documents too in the same repository, which shew that in 
former times small bridges, which facilitated access to the church 
were bu.lt and repaired out of the funds under the management of 
the kirk-session, even when no guarantee for repayment was 
granted either by the proprietor or parishioners

rochial register of births and baptisms is the 1st May 1688. This 
register consists of three foho volumes, but till within the last fif- 
teen years does not appear to have been regularly kept. Parents 
formerly were often very negligent in recording the births of their 
children; but registration is now enforced. The records of the 
kirk-session begin on the 1st January 1749, and, as far as regards 
the management of the poor, seem to have been carefully kept 
from that time. To the res gestcB of discipline less attention had 
been paid during the two last incumbencies; but from. 1749 to 
1772, the details are very minute, and very interesting, as illus- 
trative of the habits and character of the people, though certainly 
not calculated to confirm the impression, that « the former times 
were better than these." A register of deaths has been kept for 
several years, but hitherto unaccompanied with a nosological table 
Antiiiuities.-Ox, the banks of the Ugie, and on the most interest- 
ing site that could have been selected in the parish for such a build- 
ing, are to be seen the ruins of Inverugie Castle, once a splendid edi- 
hce, and the principal residence of the Earls Marischal. One of the 
towers, called the Cheyne's Tower, is of great antiquity; but the 
greater part of the fabric is supposed to have been built bv 
George, Earl Manschal, the founder of the Marischal Colle/e 
in Aberdeen. Tradition reports, that Sir Thomas Learmont the 
Rhymer visited this place, and poured forth his vaticinations

III. — Population. 

In 1755, according to Dr Webster's tables, 1271 

1775, . . , 1254

1831, .... 1334 

For the decrease of population from 1775 to 1793, the writer is 
not furnished with the means of assigning any adequate cause. 
The increase from 1793 to 1801 is accounted for by an influx of 
strangers employed in cutting the canal, which was in progress 
during the later part of that period, and that from 1801 to 1811 
by the number of labourers from other parishes being engaged in: 
making the turnpike road. The decrease from 1811 to 1821 
was doubtless owing to a bleachfield having been given up durino- 
the interim, and that from 1821 to 1831 may be traced for it 
cause to a deficiency of employment in ditching and other agri 
cultural improvements— the tenants being less able to lay out 
money for that purpose, and also to the circumstance of several of 
the farms having fallen into the occupancy of bachelors.

upon divine ordinances, and many of them give evidence of sin- 
cere piety. It is to be regretted that, in several families, there is 
reason to believe that the duties of domestic instruction and de- 
votion are either neglected or very carlessly discharged, and that 
some households exhibit the unseemly aspect of two distinct com- 
munities living under|,the same roof, and having no religious in- 
tercourse with each other — a wall of entire separation in this re- 
spect being reared between the master and his servants. To this 
as the prime cause — to the early period of life at which the child- 
ren of the peasantry engage in service — and to the mode of fee- 
ing half-yearly in markets, and the migratory habits generated by 
this system, is to be traced the moral deterioration which has be- 
come so visible in the class of farm-servants. The evil, is, indeed 
as yet, less apparent here than in more populous parishes. Many 
of the servants in this parish are remarkably intelligent, fond of 
reading, and moral and religious in their deportment ; but they 
belong almost entirely to that section which are stationary in the 
parish, and not to that floating portion of the class who change 
their parochial residence every half-year, and upon whom pastoral 
inspection, and other salutary and controlling influences can rarely 
be brought to bear. In adverting to the character of the popula- 
tion, I should be guilty of an unpardonable omission, if I did not 
state, what is well known to be the fact, that they are very temperate 
in the use of spirituous liquors. The vice of drunkenness is con- 
fined to a very few individuals, who are not in communion with the 
church. How long this may continue to be said with truth of the 
parishioners of St Fergus is rendered very problematical by the 
strong temptations to which they are exposed in four shops, now 
opened amongst them, for the retail of spirituous liquors. This is 
an evil, the fearful increase of which here and in other places, 
deserves and demands the serious attention of all who possess the 
means of mitigating or repressing it. Smuggling is entirely dis- 
continued, and from the vigilant and vigorous measures taken by 
the principal proprietor for the protection of the game, poaching does 
- not prevail to any noticeable extent. For several years there have 
been no complaints lodged against persons for poaching for salmon 
m the river; and it is believed that the misdemeanour, once very 
common, is now seldom if ever committed.

Rent of Land. — The average rent of the whole arable land in 
the parish is about L. 1, 2s. 7d. per Scotch acre, or 17s. 9:|d. per 
•imperial measure. 

The valued rent of the parish in Scots money, is L. 3000 
The real rent in Sterling money, about . L. 5720 

In 1761, the yearly rent of the parish was L. 902, 4s. 4d. Ster- 
ling. In 1766, the whole parish was let for eleven years certain, 
and a lifetime of the individual tacksmen, at the yearly gross rent 
of L. 141b, 19s. 5d. Soon after the expiry of the certain period 
of tack covenanted upon, the liferenters began to drop off; and 
when the farms which they had occupied were large, they were 
subdivided, and the rents raised and apportioned among the sub- 
tenants previously resident on the farms. Others were allowed to 
remain at the former rents, when the immediate heirs of the de- 
ceased tacksmen succeeded ; and where there were no heirs wish- 
ing to succeed, the farms were allowed to go to, and remain in 
grass, until almost the whole of the liferents expired, in order 
to allow the proprietor the means of straighting the marches, and 
making other necessary arrangements for an improved method 
of tillage. In 1803, the whole parish was let at a gross rental 
of L. 3000; and again, in 1822, on a nineteen years' lease now 
current, at L. 5720. It is worthy of being recorded, that the late 
James Ferguson, Esq. M. P. made the valuations, and let the 
■lands at the three periods above-mentioned ; and that the whole 
•rise of rent accrued to him.self, and that within a period of less 
•than sixty years, -f- 

Husbandry. ~\t may be interesting to trace the progressive im- 
•provements made in the mode of cropping. By the leases granted 
m 1766, the tacksmen of the larger farms were bound to sow 
yearly one acre with grass seeds ; half an acre with turnips ; and 
to fallow another acre ; and to lay on at least thirty bolls of lime 
not shells upon their land. They were inhibited from taking 
more than four white crops, besides green crop after the lime, be- 
tore laymg their fields down in grass. By the leases of 1803 they 
were restricted to the mode of cropping which then obtained in 

fromwhth'i'Jr'V-'' levelling system commenced, which operated one bad effect, 
soT JlfiH u r P'' ' '"ti-ely recovered. The best of the 

Sis 't. old method of tiih.ge, had been carefully gathered to the top of

white crop. This was much complained of, as the lea crop was 

u'raestroyed b, the grub ; and as -- 
to brino the soil so soon into a proper mould for turnips. But Irom

improvement, of which the soil in all parts of the parish is suscep- 
tible, would appear to be : 1. Easy access to each farm by roads 
serviceable at all seasons of the year. 2. Keeping the main ditches 
'in good order so as to prevent flooding in winter. 3. Having small 
ditches around each field communicating with the main ditches, 
and open furrows so as at all times to let the surface water escape. 
4. Trying the effects of furrow-draining. A manufactory of tiles 
for this purpose might easily be established at Inverquiny in this 
parish. There is abundance of brick clay, a ready supply of water, 
and saud at a short distance. Furrow-draining seems to hold out 
the only prospect of ensuring a turnip crop on the clay lands, and 
of rendering bone manure available for that purpose.  5. A very 
liberal application of lime, either mixed with earth as top-dressing, 
or ploughed or harrowed into the turnip mould. 6. Converting the 
money rent either wholly or in part into a grain rent, payable by 
an average of the fiar prices for a certain number of years. 7. Ex- 
tending the leases in conformity with a seven course shift to 
twenty-one years, and arranging the fielding so as to secure on 
each farm a field of grass in seven years rest. 8. A more care- 
ful attention in sowing down grass lands, to the predilection of the 
different grasses for their peculiar soils.f 9, Encouragement given 
by the proprietor to trench those parts of the Link lands, about 
Blackwater and elsewhere, which are found to overlay a rich sub- 
soil of black mould. 

The farm buildings have been much improved within the 
last forty years. They belong, in general, to the tenants. Where 
the tenant builds, he is allowed one half-year's rent at the com- 
mencement, and another at the expiry of his lease, for walls. The 
outgoing tenant is paid by the proprietor or incoming tenant for 
the roofs, according to the valuation of tradesmen mutually chosen. 
The dwelhng-houses on the principal farms are most of them 
slated, and the offices tiled. 

„f thf"c.J' absence of furrow-drainage, tlnrecan be little doubt but the introduction

Harvest fees are, for a man, L.2, and for a female reaper, L.l, 10s. 
with maintenance. A wooden plough fully mounted costs L.3, 3s. ; 
a good cart with wheels, L. 10; a harrow with tines, L.2, 8s. 
Masons work here generally by the day at Is. 6d. with victuals ; 
tailors by the piece at from 5s. to 7s. for a coat, according to the 
quality, Is. 6d. for a vest, and from Is. 6d. to 2s. for a pair of

of men's shoes ; blacksmiths work at the rate of 4d. per pound of 
iron, the price of the material being included : peat-casters in the 
season are paid by the leat of foity cart-loads, at from 17s. to L. 1 
per leat, including the labour of spreading and setting the peats. 
There are a few poor women who are employed in knitting stock- 
ings and mits at from 2d. to 3d. per cut of worsted. Others of 
this class earn a subsistence by making brooms or heather besoms 
at one halfpenny each. This latter trade affords a convenient 
opportunity for poverty to plead its wants without assuming 
the character of the professed mendicant, and in this way it yields 
a competent income to the few who are engaged in it. 

Produce. — The following estimate is the nearest approximation 
that the writer can make to the average amount of the annual 
gross produce of the land in this parish. There are 5061 acres 
in cultivation on a seven course shift, of which 

723 acres in green crop, at L. 4 per acre, will amount to L. 2892 0 0

Mills. — There are three mills in the parish, but to none of these 
are any of the farms astricted or sucken, though the tenants on 
Pitfour's property are bound by their leases to have their meal 
made at some one of the mills on the proprietor's estate. At the 
Stone Mill a large quantity of meal, flour, and pot-barley is an- 
nually manufactured by the tacksmen, the Messrs Clark, on their 
own account. In 1836, 1508 sacks of meal of 2 cwt. each 
were sent to the London market, 314 do. to Shetland, and 200 do. 
were sold at home. In the same year 613 sacks of flour, and 100 
do. of pot-barley, were made and sold for home consumption.

and memorial ought not to perish. In October 1773, Mr John 
Craigie f was ordained minister of St Fergus, and upon his trans- 
lation to Old Deer, Mr William Anderson, minister of Evie in 
Orkney, was translated to this parish in 1798. The present in- 
cumbent was admitted assistant and successor to the former minis- 
ter on the 7th March 1822, and on the 5th March of the follow- 
ing year succeeded to the full possession of the benefice. 

Church, Sfc. — The church, which was built in 1763, is convenient- 
ly situated. It is in good repair, ceiled, and furnished with three 
galleries. On the gallery fronting the pulpit is an excellent clock. 
In the year 1836, the parishioners, of their own accord, and at con- 
siderable expense, without any aid asked or received from the heri- 
tors, painted the interior of the church, walls, and wood-work, and 
fitted up the pulpit, precentor's desk, and front of the galleries with 
crimson cloth, and the windows with painted screens, so that it is 
now one of the neatest country churches any where to be seen. It 
is seated for 610. All the sittings are free, with the exception of 
a small portion of the area, including the pew originally appropri- 

" " 1772, Nov. 7. Died the Rev. Mr Robert Garden, minister of this parish, 
much regretted, who for many years had been afflicted with palsy, which made his 
life altogether sedentary, yet so well did he bear up under that infirmity, that he 
discharged the duties of his office with wonderful alacrity to the last. And though 
he had been obliged, on account of asthma and weakness of his limbs, to give over 
preaching himself, yet after sermon he always addressed his congregation with that 
cheerfulness and warmth which flowed from a real regard for their spiritual concerns, 
exhorting, admonishing, and instructing with the greatest earnestness. He was a 
cheerful companion, a warm hearted friend, and a zealous minister. His attachments 
were firm, his reproofs severe and undissembled. Though his passions were quick 
and often hurried him into extravagances which in the latter part of his life was ral 
ther the effect of his disease, which deprived him of the power of composino- his pas- 
sions, and for which he was touched with real concern when they had subsfded  vet 
his enemies could not but acknowledge that he was an honest man and a Christian 
tie was the poor man's friend ; he was no mans enemy ; he had his foibles, which 
IS only to say he was a man, but he had his virtues too. In him the deportment of 
the gentleman and the decent gravity of the Christian were united. He abhorred 
to stain the latter in order to act the former. He had his natural pride, but it was 
always pointed to its proper object. It was what was base and unbecoming that he 
scorned. He loved virtue even in rags. In his confinement books were his amuse-

session is composed of five members and a session-clerk. Each of 
the elders has a separate district assigned to him, and reports, as oc- 
casion may require, on the moral and religious state of the people, 
and on the condition of the poor under his inspection. 

Education. — The parochial is the only endowed school in the pa- 
rish. For several years past an individual, who had received an 
education sufficient to qualify him for being a clerk, but who has 
been prevented by disease from prosecuting his original intentions, 
has opened a school in his own house for reading, writing, and 
arithmetic. The average number of his scholars is 15 per quar- 
ter. He is a member of the Established Church. The salary 
of the parochial teacher is L.34, 4s. 4id.; and his school fees 
may amount to L. 20 per annum. There are several small 
schools in different parts of the parish, taught by females, at which 
children learn the elements of reading, and in two of these knitting 
and sewing are taught. It is much to be wished that the heritors 
would grant a house and garden, or some such encouragement, to 
induce a competent female teacher to settle in the parish. The 
average number of children attending the parish school is 32 in ' 
summer, and 54 in winter. The branches taught are, English 
reading, English grammar, writing, arithmetic, book-keepintr, La- 
tm, geography, and mathematics. The books used are the Bible, 
M'Culloch's Lessons, first and second series ; Lennie and Rae's 
English Grammars ; Stewart's Geography; Gray, Joyce, and In- 
gram s Arithmetic; Mutton's Mathematics; Morrison's Book-keep, 
ing; Emitter's Etymological Spelling- Book, and Wood's Etymolo- 
gical Uuide. Poor people find it difficult to furnish their children 
with the requisite school-books, and there is no common fund out 
ot wmch this deficiency can be supplied. The teacher endeavours 
as far as possible, to meet this exigency; but it is still matter of re- 
gret that some provision should not be made for supplying poor 
children with the requisite apparatus for prosecuting their educa-

the Sabbath. It is intended for the benefit of servants of both 
sexes, of young- people who have left the Sabbath schools, and of 
all who propose to offer themselves as candidates for admission to 
the ordinance of the Lord's Supper. It is well and willingly at- 
tended. The great drawback upon its beneficial operation is 
that most reprehensible practice which obtains among servants of 
a certain class, of changing their parochial residence every half 
year. 

Library.— k. parish library was instituted in 1829. It com- 
menced with a capital of about L.30, raised by shares of 5s. each, 
and a few donations. In addition to the above sum, the com- 
mittee of management afterwards borrowed L. 10. It is now in 
a very prosperous condition. It is managed by a committee of 
ten individuals, annually elected or re-elected by the shareholders, 
and the minister of the parish, who is ex officio preses. The 
shareholders pay Is. per annum for reading ; persons not share- 
holders, Is. 6d. The shares were originally 5s. j they are now 7s. 
If a shareholder does not pay Is. annually for reading, he forfeits 
his mterest m the library. The annual income is upwards of L. 6, 
of which L. 1 is paid to a librarian, who attends on the first Mon- 
day of every month to take in and give out books, and who is re- 
sponsible for the state in which the books are kept; the rest is 
applied to the purchase of new books. The number of volumes 
IS upwards of 300, but many of these are expensive works. The 
books are well selected, and consist of historical, biographical, 
scientific, literary, and religious publications. Novels, political 
pamphlets, and books of a professedly controversial character, are 
expressly excluded by the regulations. 

. The taste for reading, inspired and gratified by this institution, 
IS yearly increasing in the parish ; and while the rising generation 

tltio'n '\ '''' of knowledge, it is matter tf congra- 

ulation that they are here furnished with its ripe and wholesome 
truit, and not tempted to pluck that which k green and poisonous.

one, the plan is impracticable. But what calls loudly for such a 
mode of distribution, is the well ascertained fact, that several of the 
paupers are in the habit of expending the greater part of their 
quarterly receipts from the parish funds on tea and tobacco, and 
other luxuries, while they calculate on the bounty of the charitable 
for the necessaries of life — thus aggravating, by the means intend- 
ed to mitigate, the evils of their condition. It is matter of hearty 
regret that that spirit of independence which disdains to subsist on 
any other exertion than its own, and which was formerly the boast 
and ornament of our peasantry, is now far less characteristic of the 
class — and to receive parochial relief is consequently not consider- 
ed so humiliating and degrading as it was in a bygone generation. 
The writer has, however, witnessed many cases of the utmost un- 
willingness to receive the aid, which was but too manifestly needed, 
and where the greatest delicacy was required in the ministrations 
of charity, not to injure the fine feelings which had survived the 
withering influence of the most desolating poverty. There are 
no travelling beggars belonging to the parish, but some of the 
more necessitous of the paupers on the roll make frequent appli- 
cations for meal, and milk, and other necessaries to their better 
conditioned neighbours. The sympathies of the people are daily 
besieged by sturdy beggars from other parts of the country, who 
drain off, by their importunity, much of those supplies which would 
more properly be made to refresh the habitations of our indwelling 
poor. Various attempts have been made to rid the parish of this 
nuisance— but that which seems to promise the only complete re- 
medy would be the employment of a sufficient number of constables 
to perambulate the parish. This was partially attempted, but fail-- 
ed from the want of funds to keep up an adequate vigilance. From 
the interest which the landed proprietors, in general, have in the 
mamtenance of the parochial funds, and the means of their increase, 
It might be an experiment worth their trial .to assess themselves, 
in their several counties, according to their valued rent, in an an- 
nual sum, to be augmented by parochial contributions, for the pur- 
pose of organizing a constabulary of competent force to put down 
the evil. '  

Inns and Alehouses.—Theve are no prisons and no fairs held in 
the parish, and it were most desirable that the same negative re- 
ply could be returned in regard to alehouses; but of these, besides 
a small mn, which affords accommodation to travellers, there are

dustry. At the time the last Statistical Account was written, the 
number of the poor on the roll was 30, and the fund at interest 
for their behoof was only L. 120 ; the number is now on an ave- 
rage 56, but the funds bearing interest amount to L. 800. At 
that period there was only one thrashing-machine in the parish, 
now there is scarcely a farm, or at least very few, without one. 
In short, the extension of cultivation, and an improved mode of 
husbandry — the formation of the turnpike road— -the planting of 
trees — the erection of a new and commodious school-house — the 
practice lately introduced of exporting cattle — and the institution 
of Sabbath schools, of a library, and savings' bank — maybe referred 
to as indicative of very important alterations.

I- — Topography and Natural History. 

iV/izwze.— The name of the parish, from the oldest records, ap- 
pears to have been Lonmey,— an appellation, it is presumed, of 
Celtic etymology, and, perhaps, descriptive of the flat super- 
ficial character of the parish, and more especially of its northern 
half, where the church has always been situated. 

Extent, cS-c— It extends about 9 miles from north north-east 
to south by west; its breadth varies from miles to half a mile • 
Its superficial contents amount, at least, to 23 square miles. It is 
bounded on the east and north-east, by the German Ocean which 
begins here to trend westward, forming the great estuary of the 
Moray Frith ; a streamlet divides the parish on the east north- 
east from Rathen, with which it is also conterminous on the 
por h and north-west and west ; on the west also, and west-

riy.— The estuary of the Moray Frith may be said 
to commence on the eastern boundary of this parish, as the land 
trends to the north-west and west north-west to nearly west, and 

by north. . , . , n 

Perennial springs are not numerous, either m the north or south 
ends of the parish. A good deal of the water is of a brownish co- 
lour, as it passes through sand intermixed with iron ores : where 
vock is found which is prevailingly sienite or greenstone, there, 
and wherever clay is met with between the upper soil and bed ot 
the spring, the water is pure, cold, and excellent. Towards the 
southern extremity of the parish, wells are dug to the depth of 

30 feet through shingle and broken slate-stones of a red colour. 
There are various mineral springs— chalybeates. ' 
ja/ies— There is only one considerable lake, viz. the loch ot 

Strathbeff, covering, as is said, about 550 Scotch acres of which 
le than three-fou;ths are in this parish, and the rest of it with.n 
the parish of Crimond. The average depth of its water is abou 

31 feet: its greatest depth does not exceed 6 Th s lake, as 
stated in the former Statistical Account, was originally formed by 
reans of the sands being drifted by the wind so as to block up 
The outlet of the stream called the burn of Strathbeg, which flowed 



LONMAY. 



219 



some 200 years ago into the sea, near the village of Rattray in 
Crimond, which was also overwhelmed with sand. But there is 
no legitimate basis whereon the gigantic calculation might rest 
which was proposed by the ingenious writer of the account now 
referred to, and whereby he proposed to prove " that the evapo- 
ration from the Caspian sea is sufficient to counterbalance all the 
water poured in from the rivers which empty themselves into it." 
It is believed, however, that till of late years there was little ap- 
parent outlet of the water of this lake into the sea ; but then a 
constant filtration was visibly taking place, occasioning deep and 
dangerous shifting quicksands. For some years past, a distinct 
watery line can be traced by the eye through the sandy beach, 
along the margin of which the sand is saturated with the oozing 
water ; and to this additional means of escape is to be attributed 
the fact of the comparative diminution of the waters of Strathbeg. 
In the year 1817, the water was four feet higher than it now is at 
a gangway placed near a boat-house, built by the present proprietor 
on the west side of the loch in 1809. It is matter of observation to 
old persons, as well as of tradition, that the sea has receded con- 
siderably, and left a much greater extent of sandy beach on the 
eastern boundary of this parish. In 1796, the number of Scotch 
acres of sandy ground between the sea and the links is stated, on 
the plan of the estate of Lonmay, to be, per measurement, 398, ex- 
clusive of bents. There is now found to be 1 126 acres 5 roods': 
and, allowing for any httle inaccuracy in either of the measure- 
ments or both, the increase is doubtless great. An attempt was 
made by a Mr Sellar, forty-four years ago, to drain this loch : Seve- 
ral thousand pounds were spent in'this attempt, which'proved a com- 
plete failure. The open canals which he constructed were soon 
blocked up by drifting sand. It would seem that any after operation 
of this kind, to afford the probability of success, must be conducted 
by covered conduits, and, after all, perhaps, the expense would be 
more than commensurate with the profits to be drawn from culti- 
vating the present bed of the loch. This bed consists, for the 
most part, of sandy soil, enriched somewhat by the decomposition 
of fishes, by the shells of the large mussel, and also by the alluvial 
deposits conveyed during occasional swells of the stream which con- 
stantly flows into the lake. Indeed, it seems unlikely that any pro- 
prietor of taste would choose to pai-t with a natural object of consi- 
derable interest in the landscape, as well as a source of many days 
of summer amusement in pleasure-boat sailing and fishing, for all

the pecuniary advantage which, at a distant period, his heirs might 
come to enjoy. There are a few islets on the loch, but there has 
been much neglect in leaving these, as well as the ground wh.ch 
skirts the margin of the lake, unadorned with plantmg A smal 
patch near its edge was tried a few years ago, the rapid growth of 
which will, it is hoped, encourage the proprietor to proceed on a 
more extended scale. The scenery at present around the loch 
can- scarcely be termed picturesque. It is bounded on the east 
bv a line of benty sand hillocks : to the north there is a fine 
grassy extent of downs or links, covered with cattle for six months 
of the year, and affording constant pasturage for sheep. _ 

Geology and Mineralogy. -The prevailing rock withm the parish 
is sienite and greenstone. There is a vein of limestone in the north- 
east end of the parish, on the estate of Craigellie, which runs west- 
ward through Rathen to Strichen, &amp;c. ,  u a 

Rolled blocks of granite are occasionally found. Gravel abounds 
in one of the ridges intersecting the estate of Kinninmonth in the 
south end of the parish, as also occasionally on the estate of Craigel- 
lie Clay of fine quality abounds as subsoil on Cairnglass, along the 
north-west bank, near "'the sea; and also from the surface to a con- 
siderable depth along the ridge which divides the upper from the 
lower part of Crimonmogate. In other parts of the parish, occa- 
sionally a thin laver of coarse clay is found, mixed with coarse sand, 
about six or eight inches from the surface. Bog iron ore abounds 
on the estate of Lonmay, and peat in larger masses in the exten- 
sive mosses in Crimonmogate and Kinninmonth ; and in these 
mosses are many remains of oak, common and black. Of the las 
some fine specimens have been preserved, and made into cabinet 
furniture by Mr Bannerman of Crimonmogate. There are hke- 
vise found many remains of birch trees, hazel-nuts, alder, and fir. 
Almost everywhere decomposed roots of plants in great variety are 
found, below the till or pan which abounds in the flat part of the 

The upper soil of this parish is, for the most part, a dry, light, 
black, sandy soil, very slightly cohesive resting on a coarse 
hard bed of red sand in the north plain of the parish. This red 
sand is full of iron ore, and is so hard as to require repeated blows 
of the pick-axe to pierce it, and thereby it is detachable in large 
massesfrom the finerwhite --b-eatb- The clay s.

of Park, Blairmtorraond, and Kinninraonth. There is, however, a 
very small portion, indeed, of a loamy nature, and little or no marl 
has been found. There are no mines of any kind within the 
parish. 

Fishes. — The loch of Strathbeg abounds with trout, both red 
and yellow; with perch, first introduced by the present proprie- 
tor from the late Mr Ferguson of Pitfour's pond ; also with fresh- 
water flounders, and eels of great size and in great numbers. The 
sea affords on this part of the coast the finest cod, both white andr 
red ; ling, and sometimes tusk, haddock, whiting, skate, holi- 
but, turbot, sea-trout, flounders, including plaice and soles, which 
last, for want of the trawl-net, are but rarely caught. Cat-fish 
and John Dories, both of fine quality, are occasionally taken, 
though rarely. Herring are met with, but the fishing ground is 
chiefly within the Moray Frith. Shoals of dog-fish are seen dur- 
ing the herring-season, and the whale called Finner; also the 
grampus and porpoises in considerable number. The coal- fish 
is in swarms, and in two of its first stages of growth is tolerably 
good food. 

Botany. — The writer of this is indebted for a very extensive, 
and, it is believed, correct hst of the indigenous plants proper to 
this parish, to a medical practitioner residing in this neighbour- 
hood, Dr Cow, who is proposing to publish a work on this sub- 
ject, comprehending the district of Buchan. There are 237 plants 
mentioned in this list, but, as the greater portion of them are com- 
mon to all parts of the country, and none peculiar to the parish, 
it is not thought necessary to insert it. A few specimens of the 
sea holly have been found by the above-mentioned gentleman. 

Forests and Plantations. — Although the soil in this parish, when 
disturbed to any depth, almost universally aff'ords proof of the con- 
tinuity of the forest here in olden times, yet there were not forty 
trees to be seen above ground within its bounds, fifty years ago. 
There are now 222 Scotch acres under wood, a large proportion 
of which has been planted within the last twenty years, and a good 
extent within the last three or four years. Scotch firs were first 
tried, being thought best adapted to the soil and climate; but 
experience has proved that idea erroneous, where there is but little 
previous shelter. Alders, willow, elder, and poplars, sho uld be first 
planted, and thickest on the outer borders of the plantation. The 
other kinds proper for this parish are found to be larches, ash, 
elm, and especially beech, which last- is unquestionably the tree 



222 ABERDEENSHIRE. 

of Buchan. It has the following peculiar advantages over others 
-its roots pierce more readily and effectually through the hard 
iron sand, and agree with the under soft sand ; it grows free of fog or 
tree fungus; thrives under the drop and branches of other trees ; it 
puts out a number of leading shoots, and these are se dom or ever 
blighted,-uot being so early as to suffer from the cold and often 
frosty winds of spring. The beech, moreover, is feathered with 
branches from top to bottom, and in the course of thirty years 
overtakes all other trees in height. Where there is previous shel- 
ter, pines of various species may be planted with advantage; and, 
after being three years in the ground, push rapidly and assist by 
their shelter the growth of their neighbours. Oaks also thrive 
well, and have been too sparingly planted here. The sycamore, 
ov pseudo-vhtanus, and the rowan or mountain-ash are both hardy 
trees, and are said to be indigenous. The birch thrives well, but 
is not a lofty tree here. Limes look healthy, and come to tole- 
rable size. The horse-chesnut does well where sheltered. Most 
flowering shrubs and evergreens which have succeeded north of 
the Tay, seem to agree with our light soil, but require most of 
them protection from the climate, especially from the cold wmds 
of March and April. But, above all others, May is our trying 
month, which « brings down many wounded by her.'

The first sentence following the title is worthy of attention . 
« 1709, Sept. 24, This congregation having for near two years 
been without an Established minister since the death of Mr Hous- 
ton late Episcopal incumbent here, the people and heritors seve- 
a 't mes endeavouring to have a gospel minister among them, but 
stm differirg and dMdrg in their choice of the person : at length

appointment both of synod and presbytery, preached, &amp;c. where- 
upon the presbytery did legally and orderly call the said Mr Gor- 
don to be minister." 

The entries made in the session record are very full during Mr 
Gordon's incumbency, which ended at his death in 1743. Be- 
sides the ordinary account of poor's money and matters of disci- 
pline, there are some notices of a miscellaneous character, which 
serve to illustrate times past. Collections are reported for repair 
of roads, bridges, the harbour of Bantf ; in 171 8, for the distressed 
Protestants in Lithuania; in 1726, fasting and humiliation on 
account of scorching drought; in 1723, thanksgiving for deliver- 
ance from pestilence raging in foreign countries, and especially 
in France.  Inquests on the bodies of murdered persons seem 
sometimes to have been left to the kirk-session. 1727, April 9, 
the minister reported that " he understood there was a design 
among the heritors of this and the two neighbouring parishes of 
Rathen and Crimond to erect ane Episcopal meeting-house near 
to this church, as yt place most centrical to them all; and it was 
found by the unanimous sentiment of the session that this designed 
meeting-house was promoted from very malice and splen to the 
established government of church and state, and to instil into the 
people of this corner, principles of rebellion against the Govern- 
ment, and favour for a Popish Pretender ; and as they were per- 
suaded of this from weighty reasons, which are not proper to be 
insert here so particularly from this consideration, yt all the com- 
mon people of these three parishes, and especially in this, had 
always been most punctual and precise attenders upon, and par- 
takers, of all gospel ordinances dispensed by yr respective minis- 
ters, had frequently signified their satisfaction with yr ministers, 
and resolution to adhere to yr ministry, unless they should be 
compelled as they feared to attend a worship pinged with cere- 
monies by yr respective masters," &amp;c. And it was found that 
the principal promoters of this division, and intenders to have the 
meeting-house near this church, were " Mr Eraser, present heritor 
of the barony of Lonmay, who was engaged in the late rebellion, 
and still continued in yt same strain against the Government and 
Gospel ministry ; and also William Cruden, one of the Fraser- 
burgh posts, a nottour Bourignian in his principles," &amp;c. &amp;c. 

• In 1737, Provincial Synod of Aberdeen appoint a day for humiliation on ac- 
count of aunding sin, and particularly bloodshed, under whicli this province groans. 
In 1741, King and Cliurch appoint a fast on account of threatened famine.

173-2, Dec. 10, The minister reported " that qun the fore wall of 
the church was taken down, yr was a little cut stone above the 
bi door, containing an account qun and by qum yr church was 
built, with ye ministers' names and entry there ui office : and yt 
ye cuttino- of the sd stone was very bad, and so defaced yt it was 
scarce legible, and yrefore he had caused buy, cut, colour, and 
set up another stone, containing what was written on the former. 
This stone is built into the present church-yard wall, and con- 
tains what follows ; " This house was built for the worship of 
God by the parish of Lonmay, 1607-Mr Thomas Rires being 
minister then, and three years before at the old church After 
him Messrs William Rires, James Irvine, and John Houston 
were ministers successively-next, Mr Thomas Gordon was or- 
dained minister of the Gospel by the Presbytery of Deer, with 
consent of all concerned in the parish, September 24, 1709, &amp;c. 

The last mentioned minister died in 1743. His successor, Mr 
Sim died in 1752; and Mr Lundie, the third Presbyterian mi- 
ni=te'r from the Revolution, died in 1807, May, after being five 
years pastor of the parish. Mr Shearer, the fourth in order, died in 
1810 February, and the present minister was settled in May

Antiquities.-\iexe are no antiquities in the parish, unless we 

mention a Druidical circle, which is very entire at Newark in Cn- 
monmogate. Th centre stone is of great size, and as well as se- 
veral oLvs composing the circle must have been brought from 
a great distance. We may also mention the site of an old castle, 
called the Castle of Lonmay, in the Links thereof near the sea, 
from which all the stones have been carried off, and employed m 
building farm-houses, &amp;c.; but, except the name, all tradition re-

&amp;c. Fish are, however, occasionally used, especially skate, and 
at the approach of winter, a fat small-sized ox or heifer often of 
the Shetland breed, bought for the purpose, is not unfrequent- 
ly shared between three or four families. Undoubtedly the people 
are disposed to be content and satisfied with a very moderate sup- 
ply of the humbler comforts of life ; but for some years past, diffi- 
culties have increased in the way of their procurement. There is 
little or no capital left amongst them, owing to the deterioration of 
the value of agricultural produce, including cattle, and which is 
wholly disproportioned to any reduction which has taken place in 
the cost of rent, labour, and other farm charges and expense of ne- 
cessary articles of consumption. Depression of circumstances has 
more and more prevailed in the case of those who were moderate- 
ly provided with the means of life, and the reduced state of each 
class acting disadvantageously on its inferior, has occasioned the in- 
crease of poverty to be felt in rather an alarming manner, so that

preceding 1830, were in great demand, and indeed still bear a high 
price in the southern markets, and the top price in London. 
The short-horned cattle, however, are beginning to supplant our 
own Buchan breed. A considerable difference of opinion prevails 
as to their comparative merits. One disadvantage belongs to the 
large short-horned ox, that he is too heavy in the carcase for driv- 
ing to a distant market. His superiority consists in his feeding 
to a greater weight, and coming sooner to the home-market for 
the flesher. 

Sheep. — The sheep of this country are the produce of a mixed 
breed. They carry a weighty and tolerably fine fleece, and their 
tnutton is well flavoured, but inferior to the black or the white-faced 
Highland six year-old wethers. These last are imported annually, and 
fed for the table. Mr Bannerman of Crimonmogate has imported 
some South Down and Lincolnshire sheep, and has a large stock 
of fine half-bred English sheep in his lawn. 

Horses. — Great attention has been paid for some years past to 
the rearing of horses. There is a very striking change in this 
respect between the present strong, fine built draught horses, 
ploughing in pairs, and the dwarfish small-boned beasts, six or even 
eight of which used to be seen, forty years ago, attached to the clumsy 
plough then in use. Every year, prize stallions, both draught and 
blood, travel through this and the neighbouring parishes. General 
Gordon of Cairness, six years ago, brought three fine Arab stal- 
lions from Greece, two of which have got stock in the parish, 
which promise well for the saddle. ' 

Pigs.—Yigs are raised in considerable number, and of a good 
kmd, bemg improved by a mixture of the Bedford and Westpha- 
lia, Orkney and Chinese. The close-hoofed kind have been also 
tried, but have been given up on account of the redness of their 
flesh. 

Husbandry.The husbandry in this quarter deserves a very 
difi-erent character from that bestowed on it in the former Statis- 
tical Account of the parish, being in general both laboriously and 
skilfully conducted. Neither does it owe its advancement, as the 
writer of the first account supposes, to the introduction of lime as 
a manure, which in general does not suit, the soil being sandy ; but 
bone dust has been applied for the last five or six years, with very 
great success both for green crops, for which it is chiefly used, and

beech. The farm steadings have been much improved ; but there 
still remains a good deal to be done in that department. 

Improvement. — What may be termed the grand improvement 
introduced of late years, is trench-ploughing, with four oxen or 
four strong horses, once in the rotation. By this operation a 
greater depth of soil, and fresh soil has been procured, and by 
this means the growth of plants has been in many places favoured 
by the pan or till being pierced. By trench ploughing, greater 
moisture is obtained in dry seasons, for the roots of plants are thus 
allowed to descend, and, on the other hand, in rainy seasons the 
surface water is not kept up, but is speedily absorbed by the finer 
and softer sand subsoil. 

Obstacles to Improvement. — Want of capital is the crying griev- 
ance, and its effects are felt yearly more and more. Small farms, 
in consequence of this and the deterioration in the value of pro- 
duce, cannot afford profits, after payment of rents, sufficient to 
maintain the occupiers and their families. It is truly wonderful 
how any of them can continue on their present footing. They 
work bard, and live with the utmost frugality ; and they contrive 
to appear in decent clothing at church, and to give their children 
Christian education. I am sorry to say, their comforts, which 
were visibly increased, are again reduced. 

Fisheries. — We may mention three kinds : the cod-fishing, salt- 
cured, and sold wholesale. The fish is sold in retail from house to 
house for food. St Combs is the only fishing station in the pa- 
rish. The St Combs fishermen go with their herring-boats to 
Fraserburgh.

Average gross amount of raw Produce.— Ir'ici accuracy is hardly 
attainable in furnishing information on this head. Few agricultu- 
nsts in this part of the country make regular entries of returns of 
produce in their farm accounts, or of sales, so as to furnish an ave- 
ijage valuation thereof, and the same holds true of their live-stock. 
Uetails of profits cannot be obtained, so as to enable us to treat

miles distant from the north-east boundary of the parish. Peter- 
head is about eioht miles from the south-east boundary. 
■ Means of Communication. — One receiving-house for letters and 
newspapers, about one-quarter of a mile west of the western boun- 
dary of the parish, at Cortebrse. One turnpike-road from Peter- 
head to Banff, by Fraserburgh, traverses the p.arish for a mile and 
half; another from Fraserburgh to Aberdeen, by Mintlaw, ex- 
tends from north to. south nearly six miles through the parish. 
One daily mail-coach runs from the south to Fraserburgh, and 
one stage-coach from Peterhead to Banff, by Mintlaw, three times 
a week. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated within two 
miles of the north-east boundary, and upwards of seven from the 
south end. From the south end much inconvenience, amounting 
in many cases to absolute hindrance from attending any place of 
worship, has long, too long, resulted from this arrangement. In 
March 1836, a petition was given in to the presbytery of Deer, 
and signed by 103 heads of families, which describes so graphically 
the spiritual wants of the people that it is here inserted : " The 
petition of the householders in the southern district of the parish 
of Lonmay, comprehending the whole of Kinninmonth, part of 
Belfatten in Crimonmogate, and of others residing on the bor- 
ders of the contiguous parishes of Strichen, Old Deer, Longside, 
and St Fergus, — Humbly sheweth. That your petitioners labour 
under the grievous disadvantage of want of opportunities of pub- 
lic worship, and of adequate pastoral superintendence, by reason of 
the great distance which intervenes between their places of resi- 
dence and their parish churches, aggravated by the impractica- 
bility of accommodation in others less remote. Adhering to the 
Church of Scotland, your petitioners cannot but feel distressed 
that they are themselves so frequently, and the young, the aged, 
and in6rm of their families, almost entirely, deprived of the means 
of attendance at the house of God ; and all of waiting on the mi- 
nistry of a pastor residing among them : That your petitioners 
inhabit a district not less than from six to eight square miles in ex- 
tent, so disadvantageously situated in the respects above shewn, 
that no less than 78 families, consisting of 416 souls, in Lonmay 
alone, and upwards of 60 other families, adhering to the Church 
of Scotland, are from four to seven miles distant from their re- 
pective parish churches. These families nave, moreover, many

of tliem, no seats in any other church of the Estabhshment, others 
but one sitting, and a considerable number have even taken sit- 
tings in a place of worship, belonging to a body not only uncon- 
nected, but disagreeing, with the Church of Scotland ; having often 
no choice between this occasional departure from their own church, 
or absenting themselves wholly from a place of worship. That the 
number of Dissenters in this district from the Established Church 
is, at present, exceedingly small, but will undoubtedly mcrease de- 
plorably, unless an additional church shall be forthwith erected in 
connection with the Church of Scotland. That your petitioners 
have, therefore, joined together in subscription to contribute to 
the expense of erecting a suitable building, capable of containing 
from 350 to 400 persons." &amp;c. &amp;c. By means of the aid afforded 
by the Church Extension Committee of the General Assembly, 
amountingtoL. 150, and local contributions, L. 250 and upwards, a 
church has been built ; the whole expense defrayed ; and a preacher 
located having a neat cottage hard by the church ; and the gratifjnng 
spectacle may now be seen of groupes of families every Lord s day, 
passing thickly to and from this additional house of God. In the ori- 
ginal parish church every vacant sitting is taken, and thisnewchurch 
is filled, illustrating in this part of the country the benefit of church 
extension. The present parish church was built on a new site in 
1787 The old church stoodon the present burial-ground smce 1608, 
previous to which the parish church was by the sea-side, hard by 
■ where the village of St Combs now stands. It appears to have 
been of small dimensions. The present church is in good repair 
All the public buildings are annually inspected by competent 
tradesmen, and defects supplied, in consequence of standing reso- 
lutions of the heritors. The church was originally seated for 860. 
There are once every year SOOpersons within its walls. Seatswere 
allowed by the heritors to be fitted up in the centre of the area 
at the expense of the kirk-session, by whom they are annually let 
for sums of from Is. to 4d. each, for behoof of the poor. A good 
many of the tenants are accommodated with seats free of rent. 
Others, I understand, are charged by their landlord a sma 1 sum 
perseat,_a practice which ouht to be discontmued, for obvious 

"present manse was built in the year 1824 and has already 
undergone some overhauling, and will soon probably require more, 
as is common with cheap manses. 

The glebe consists of 13 acres, two of which have been reclaim 



LONMAY. 



233 



ed by the present incumbent from whinny moor-land. An ex- 
cambion took place in 1810 of the old glebe at St Combs, for 
some additional ground adjoining the present glebe. The stipend, 
by decreet of the Lords Commissioners, was modified in 1814 to 
13 chalders of victual, half barley, half meal. 

There is one additional church at Kinninmonth ; the preacher, 
Mr C. Cordiner, is resident there, and visits and catechises in his 
district. There is one Dissenting chapel, viz. an Episcopalian, 
the minister of which is paid by seat-rents, which make up a very 
small salary to him. There is no Popish chapel, and only one 
person of that communion in the parish. 

The two Established Churches are both well attended. The 
number of communicants has been yearly on the increase. The 
average for the last three years is about 780. Since Kinninmonth 
church was built the communicants exceed this number conside- 
rably. The number of families who belonged to the Established 
Church in 1837 was 336; of persons of all ages, 1621. In the 
parish attending the Dissenting Episcopal chapel, 33 families, 
and 154 persons ; of Seceders attending meeting-houses in other 
parishes, 5 families, and 23 persons. Total, 1 798. 

Education. — Total number of schools in the parish, 6; of pa- 
rochial sphools, 3 ; of unendowed or private, 1 ; of dames' schools 
for girls, sewing, &amp;c. 2. Branches of education taught are English 
reading, English grammar, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping; 
also additional at the first parochial school Latin and mathematics 
and navigation, which last is also taught in the St Comb's school. 

Salaries of Schoolmasters. — Of the 1st, or Lonmay estate school, 
L.28; of the 2d, or Kinninmonth school, L. 13, 6s. 7d. ; of the 
3d, or St Comb's school, L. 10 : Total paid by heritors, L. 51,

Amount of iees.— Latin per quarter, 5s.; mathematics and 
geography, 6s. ; arithmetic, 4s. ; English and writing, 3s. ; English 
reading alone, 2s. ; all paid at the end of the quarter, and the 
total amount per annum of said fees to each schoolmaster is re- 
ported by them to be : For first school, paid to the assistant the 
schoolmaster being superannuated, and allowed to retire upon his 
salary L. 21, 16s. The heritors also subscribe L. 4 per annum 
to said assistant during the life of the schoolmaster. Second school,

vate school, said to be only L. 8. For the first school there is suffi- , 
cient acommodation provided. The Kinninmonth school was built 
by general subscription, and the teacher rents a house and small 
piece of ground. The St Comb's school and schoolmaster s 
apartments were built by the proprietor, General Gordon, at us 
own expense. The ordinary expense of education is shown by the 
foregoincr statement of fees, to be from 8s. per annum or children, 
to L.-l,°4s. per annum for scholars learning Latin and mathema- 
tics There are only four or five persons between six and ten 
years of age who have never been at school, and these will be 
educated at the public expense. There are some old persons who 
cannot read or write. As a proof how much alive the people are 
to the benefits of education, we shall state in addition, the num- 
ber of scholars now in attendance at the several schools in the pa- 
rish : — ,

When the present incumbent came to his pastoral charge here 
about twenty-three years ago, there was but one school attended 
on an average by 47 or 48 scholars yearly. The heritors in 
1820 having complied with the supplication made to them and 
additional means of education having been provided, the schools 
were no sooner opened than they were fild with scholars and 
the private schools followed thereafter. Then was afforded the 
Toresent happy result, well worthy of the observation of every well- 
'wller to the'interests of Christianity and of general civihzation, 
who has it in his power " to go and do likewise. 

Friendhj Society.-There was a Friendly Society -titu ed a 
St Combs. Considerable trouble was taken in forming it ; but 
after the fishermen had almost all joined, and the infant institution 
was advancing prosperously, came the iU -judged gis atrve in or- 
ference proposed by Mr Kennedy, M. P., which upset this useful

scheme, along with a hundred others throughout Scotland ; and 
it is feared no persuasion will be available for their re-construction. 

Poor and ParocJiial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid for the last four years, 44 ; total funds, 
including collections at church, penalties, and interest of about 
L.250 lent out, and voluntary donations from heritors, L. 66. — 
Charge upon the funds : session-clerk and officer, doctor's bill 
and coffins, say L. 10, 10s., leaving L.55 amongst 44 persons, 
L. 1, 5s. each. 

The munificent bequest of the late Mr Burnett of Aberdeen 
to the kirk-session of the several parishes in the county of Aber- 
deen for behoof of the poor, affords a payment to each parish 
once in about eight years. This has been employed by the 
kirk-session of Lonmay as a floating fund to meet exigencies. 
Very few applications are made personally for aid. Support is 
professedly not the system, and relief is afforded in as quiet and 
efficient a manner as possible, so as to go hand in hand, without 
interfering, with private charity. The field, however, we are 
sorry to observe, has for some years past been growing more ex- 
tensive, and difficulties are sensibly felt in dealing prudently with 
the evil. There is now introduced a very guarded observance of 
the law of settlement, which has occasioned a great watchfulness 
of the characters and regard to the circumstances of new comers, 
both on the part of the kirk-sessions and heritors. 

Fairs. — There are two held annually on the same ground, one 
in spring and the other in autumn, for cattle and sheep, and also for 
feeing farm-servants. 

Inns, Alehouses, §-c.— Of petty public houses there are few. Yet 
these, and the licensed whisky shops, five or six in number, are to 
be considered an evil in the parish, and they are in general truly a 
curse to the country, affording temptations to intemperance, which 
are by no means withstood. 

iwe/.— Peat moss is used generally for fuel, brought from the 
estates of Crimonmogate and Kinninraonth. The tenantry on the 
other estates purchase it at a price which the proprietors have been, 
from time to time, advancing; so that, if along with the present high 
pnce of this article, its carriage also was to be estimated at its pro-

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The principal changes in the state of this parish smce the last 
Statistical Account was published, consist, I In the great extent 
of agricultural improvements : 1st, On waste land rec aimed : 2d, 
Wet land drained : 3d, In very extensive and substantial inclosures : 
4th, In an improved system of cropping, of breeding stock, and ge- 
neral management : 5th, In additional plantations, which now begm 
highly to adorn the face, especially of tte northern half of the pa- 
rish - eth. In the increased value of the land, the total rental being 
nearly treble of what it was in 1796. II. In the provision made 
for the intellectual improvement of the people, which is vastly m- 
creased III. In the additional accommodation for the worship o 
God, by an additional church and preacher. IV. In the external 
comforts of the people, as to lodging, neatness of dress, and others 
which meet the eye. But then, on the other side of the picture, is 
to be noted, straitened circumstances of late years, and want ot ca- 
pital. The tide of prosperity is at present ebbing, and credit is de- 
creasing as well as cash. There is a decreased currency, and low 
prices for produce,-but high rents, high charges for labour and 
implements, and a heavy charge for wear and tear on the farm 
accounts. Great industry and the greatest possible frugahty are 
requisite to obtain the means of bare subsistence.

PRESBYTEKY OF ABERDEEN, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. JAMES ALLAN, MINISTER. 

L — Topography and Natural History. 
The parish of Newhills, in former times, was a part of the 
then extensive and incommodious parish of Saint Machar, or 
Old Machar, whose church is situated in Old Aberdeen. The 
distance betwixt the church and the remote confines towards the 
west was so great, that it was hardly possible for the people resi- 
dent there to assemble at Saint Machar for worship, and for other 
religious purposes. This circumstance had excited, it appears, the 
notice and sympathy of a pious and humane individual, Mr George 
Davidson, of Pettens, a burgess of Aberdeen, — and who had amas- 
sed a considerable fortune, and risen entirely by his own industry. 
This man, having no family to provide for, and feeling that he 
could not better dispose of his property than by applying it " in 
better providing" as he himself expressed it for the spiritual 
wants of the people with whom he was connected, and in whose 
salvation he took a deep interest, — mortified for the endowment of 
a resident clergyman in this western part of Saint Machar the lands 
of " Keppelhills," consisting of nearly 700 Scotch acres, which he 
had previously purchased from the town of Aberdeen. He also 
caused a church to be built upon these mortified lands, about five 
miles distant from Saint Machar ; and all at his own expense, in 
the year 1663. 

This property he disponed and made over to the officiating 
clergyman at the time, the Rev. George Melville, and to his suc- 
cessors in office in all time coming. The place of worship, there- 
fore, was originally a chapel of ease, and had continued to be so 
for about three years. 

This benevolent individual also built a large stone bridge over 
the Buxburn, in the line of the old road to Aberdeen, for the ac- 
commodation of travellers in the lower end of the district ; and 



238 ABEUDEENSHIRE. 

mortified the lands of Bogfairlie and the lands of Pettens in Bel- 
helvy, to Saint Nicholas Church in Aberdeen. 

The death of Mr Davidson did not prevent the mcorporation of 
the new church with the Established Church ; for in 1666 the 
persons interested in the concern, and authorized to act, applied 
to the Lords Commissioners for Planting Kirks for a disjunction 
of a certain district of Saint Machar around the church budt by 
Mr Davidson, and its erection into a parish ; which application, 
having the consent of all parties, was successful, and the de- 
creet of the Lords Commissioners accordingly was obtained that 

since that time the parish has continued separate and distinct, 
and possesses all the privileges and rights which belong to the other 
parishes of the Established Church of Scotland. 
 Name.-lt appeared to have been the desire of the applicants 
to give to this newly erected parish a name in some degree resem- 
bling the name of the mortified lands of « Keppelhills, and hence 
it was denominated " Newhills." 

Ecctent—The extent of the parish is very considerable, it is 
reckoned to contain about 30 square miles, being about 6 miles 
in lencrth, and 5 in breadth. It is of an irregular form, and is 
bounded on the east by the river Don ; towards the south, by the 
parish of Peterculter and Nether Banchory ; towards the north, by 
the parish of Dyce and Kinellar; and towards the south-east, by 
Saint Machar, from which it was originally disjoined. 

n.— Civil History. 
Mansion Houses.-Some of the heritors have beautiful seats, 
particularly Mr Forbes of Springhill, and Mr Robertson o Haze 
Lad. The places of Sheddocksley, of Fairley of Cradston of 
CloghiU, of Gateside, of Waterton, and the Place of NewhilL, 
the sea; and property of the minister, which has been very much 
improved by him, are all of them much admired. 

Ill —Population. 
There is a considerable part of this parish, especially westward 
of a hilly nature, some of which is covered with wood, and pa 
only with heath and stones; but, notwithstanding of this, there 
g ei; and increasing population. In the year 1775 the amo 
of the population was only 959, and in 1792 it was 1153 , bu at 
St ceni, it was found to be 2Q55. i-e that time, it has ni b 
increased ; and this has been owing to the feumg J 
the improvements which have been made along the three gre

turnpike roads which pass through the parish, and which lead to 
the oreat and tlonrishing- town of Aberdeen. 

In general, throughout the parish there are very comfortable 
dwellings ; and the people, upon the whole, with the exception of 
some casual residenters, are very quiet, well disposed, and indus- 
trious.

Soil, Produce, Manufactures, Sfc. — The lands of this parish are 
in general not of the best quality. The soil is commonly of a 
black colour, and of a light quality, and is placed upon a hard pan 
or retentive subsoil, which, in wet seasons, is very injurious to the 
growth of corn, and turnips, and grasses, the agricultural produce 
of the district. In some parts, however, there are fields of a very 
superior quality, and yielding most abundant crops. These princi- 
pally are the property of Lord and Lady James Hay, the value of 
whose lands is about five-sixths of that of the whole parish. Upon 
their grounds, there are immense quarries of blue granite stone, 
which are extensively wrought, and yield them an annual rent of 
about L. 250; in these, there are generally employed about 260 
men. Stones from these quarries are prepared and sent to Aber- 
deen, London, and elsewhere. 

Manufactories.— There are also upon this property, which is 
bounded by the river Don, three paper manufactories. One of 
them at Waterton, belonging to Mr Pirie, has two large machines, 
which form, dry, size, and press the paper, and all in one operation. 
The paper is generally a fine printing paper; but sometimes also 
for writmg. The number of persons generally employed is about 
150. The machines throw off an immense quantity of paper, 
and they are wrought day and night. The other two manufectories 
have also each a machine. They work in the manufacture of wrap- 
ping-paper,andaconsiderablenumberofhandsareemp]oyedateach. 



240 ABEIiDEliNSIIlllE. 

Besides this, there is on the same property, a large manuractovj. 
of worsted, wherein there are about 67 persons employed. 

'L'here are also a brewery of eonsiderable extent and 10 
mills for the manufaeture of snuff. There are no fewer than 
five meal-mills, and two flour-mills, some of whrch manufacture 
.rain to a grat extent, for the supply of Aberdeen and the 
"adioining country. On other properties m the pansh there are 
th ee other meal-mills, two of which carry on a very extensive 
ride It may be said, therefore, of Lord and Lady James Hay's 
operty n Z east end of the parish, that it is of a very supenor 
value, and that there are few places where such numerous and 
extensive manufactories are carried on, withm such a hm.ted space. 

These manufactories and stone quarries give to th,s part of the 
narish a bustling and very interesting appearance. 
' ifthis parish there ae very few of what may be cal ed large 
farms There Ire 35 heritors and feuars, and most of the feuars

short distance from Aberdeen, and the large "' rea n' 

in the vicinity, they pay more attention to this than to the rearing 
of youno cattle, and they turn it to very great accoun . 

ifV-The lands, in some cases, are pretty high rented,- 
sonfe teraging L. 3 and upwards per Scotch acre ; but the com- 
mon rate of rent may be stated at from L. I, 10s. to U A 

In this parish, theJe is still a great extent of barren uncultivated 
ground ; but, of late years, a very great change has been eflc 
Improvements are going on ; and are encouraged by the nea. ness 
Se mTrkets, and the'plentiful supply of all kmds of manure. 
V —Parochial Economy. 
EccUsiastical State.-The present church was built by Ae hen- 
i.,.s of the narish in 1830, is centrieally situate, large, and com

improvements. Another reason is, that these mortified lands are 
alike liable, with the other lands in the parish, to all public burdens 
and assessments, and have to pay a certain feu-duty to the town 
of Aberdeen. It is thus difficult to state what may be the ave- 
rage amount of stipend, as it varies from year to year. 

The heritors pay the usual allowance for communion elements, 
and a trifle in name of stipend, as part of the unexhausted teinds. 

There are only a few Dissenters in the parish, and two small 
families of the Popish persuasion. 

Education. — There is one parochial school, to which is attach- 
ed a salary of L. 33, 7s. 6d. There is an excellent school-house, 
and superior accommodation for the scholars ; and all the branches 
of education are taught which are required in any country school. 
The teacher's fees may amount to L. 25 per annum. 

There are other two schools in the parish, built by subscription, 
but they are unendowed, and the teachers, having no salary, are de- 
pendent on the school fees. 

Poor. — The average number of persons receiving parochial aid 
is 52; the average sum allotted to each per quarter, 10s.; the 
average annual amount of contributions for the poor is L. 104, — 
whereof L. 40 is from church collections, and L. 64 from alms or 
legacies.

some places, small hills of trap rise to a considerable height, per- 
haps several hundred feet, above the level of the rivulet. The trap 
contains in it all the variety of minerals usually found in similar 
seams. On the south-west side of the trap seam, the rocks and 
outlayers of stone are almost entirely of granite. On the north- 
cast side almost no granite rocks, not even outlayers or water-rol- 
led pieces of granite, are to be found. They are all of the coarsest 
varieties of rock, scarcely fit for any useful purpose, except for 
building dry stone dikes. There are no quarries or mines 
wrought, nor fossil organic remains or ores, in any noticeable 
quantity, found in the parish. The alluvial deposits are a rich 
clay loam and clay, mixed with rolled blocks of stones of all sizes 
from the size of a walnut, to that which weighs several tons, gra- 
vel and fine sea or river sand. It is probable that in many places, 
especially in a line from north to south, about a mile from the 
sea, these alluvial deposits are very deep, for no rock or solid strata 
have been found even where pits have been sunk to a considerable 
depth. 

There is a great quantity of peat moss in the parish. Some of it 
near the coast is considerably under the level of the sea, and is 
covered to the- depth of 10 or 12 feet by sea sand. It is probable 
that this moss extends a considerable length out to sea, and that 
there is a submarine forest somewhere in this bay at no' great dis- 
tance. For on Christmas 1799, when there was perhaps the 
most dreadful tempest that any person remembered to have seen 
on this part of the coast, several cubical blocks of peat moss 
were cast by the sea upon the sandy beach, some of them contain- 
ing upwards of 1700 cubic feet. Pieces of wood, like branches 
of oak trees, apparently converted to a consistence like moss, pas- 
sed through these blocks, in every direction. Both moss and wood 
were perforated by a number of Auger worms of a large size, and 
most of them were alive in their holes. The moss was of a much 
harder consistence than any found in this part of the country. 
Such large blocks could not have been carried to the sea by any 
of the neighbourmg rivers, for they were not swelled at that time, 
but were all firmly bound up with ice. In general, when any thing 
like a tempest occurs at sea, a considerable quantity of peat moss 
of ihe same kmd ,s cast upon this sandy beach ; but no person re- 
members to have seen it in so large masses as at Ghristmas 1799.

quantity of land in this parish at present under cultivation is fully 
one-third more than in 1791, and the whole is much better culti- 
vated. There are no townsor villages in this parish. The po-

Character of the People.~The people may be said to be intel- 
lectual, sober, moral, and religious. There can hardly be said to 
be poaching of any kind practised among them, and smuggling, 
both foreign and domestic, is completely suppressed. ■ 

IV, — Industry. 

Affriculture.— Omng to the irregularity of the boundaries of this 
parish. It cannot be said to contain more than 19,000 standard 
acres. Of these 5000 are in waste land, sea-beach, peat-bog, 
and wood ; 14,000 are cultivated, of which 9000 have been under 
cultivation for a long time, and 5000 have been lately reclaimed 
from moor ground. 

There is also a small piece of undivided common in the north- 
west corner of the parish. 

Almost all the growing timber in this parish has been planted 
lately, and generally in hedge-rows, so that the number of acres 
cannot easily be ascertained, but they certainly are not many, 
ihe kinds of trees that thrive best are the ash, plane, elm, alder, 
ind wiHow. 1 J J  

JlentofLand.--The rent of the old cultivated land averages 
Irom 10s. to 5s. Sterling. There are no permanent pastures ; bu 



24G ABEUDKENSHIRE. 

grass laid out for summer pasture lets at from L.2, 10s. to L.2 

per standard acre. 

j:i7;e-StocL--Very few sheep are kept m this parish, and hey 
are mostly of the black-faced kind. , A great many cattle are bred 
and fed in this parish for the London market. They are pnnci- 
nlllv of the iniproved Aberdeenshire breed. Their bones are 
small, they carry a great deal of flesh, are easily fed, and are soon 
fit for the market. The farmers, in general, depend more upon 

raisins: grain than cattle. i u' 

A °reat deal of waste land has been reclaimed of late, and much 
drainfng has been required, which has been executed successfully, 
and on good principles. 

Leases are generally for a term of nmeteen years. 
The farmers' houses are now much improved, and comtortaDie. 
The fields in general are enclosed with dry stone dikes or sunk 
fences All these improvements have been executed by the people 
oenerally, and not by a few individuals. The principal, if not the 
only bar to greater improvements is want of capital among the 

affricultural classes. . . , 

iri,/«-n.,.-Salmon is the only kind of fishery, and it is carried 
op entirely by stake-nets. The success has been - 
it is impossible to say how much rent is drawn annually or the s x 
miles of sea coast occupied by a very great number of stake-nets , 
but the rent must be very considerable. 

This parish contains about 19,000 acres, 5000 of these are not 
yet cultivated; 14,000 are under cultivation, of which probably 
ioOO, good or bad, are in grain crop ; 10,000 in turmp, potatoes, 
hay, pasture grass, &amp;c. The average produce of grain on th 
- good 'and bad soils, perhaps, may be 3  
in whole 15,000 quarters. But though - 
been bestowed to ascertain the quantity and value o the - 
agricultural produce of the parish, the reports given by d ffeient 
persons are so various and so discordant, that it is thought best to 
say nothing on the subject. 

v.— Parochial Economy. 
Means of Commmicatlon.-Tsso turnpike roads pass througl 
the miSh each about six miles long. On each, the mad is cam d 
Jly d toh the parish; but there is no post-office m the par.h. 
ThL puUic coaches pass and repass daily on these two roads

middle between its south and north extremities. About fifty years 
ago, its situation may have been the most convenient for the largest 
proportion of the inhabitants, because the western side of the parish 
was little cultivated and thinly inhabited.; but at present, the eastern 
side is let in large farms, and thinly inhabited, while the western 
is let in small farms, and contains a great many inhabitants, so 
that a considerable number of the "parishioners live at five miles 
distance from the church. The church is in good repair at 
present. The church contains 519 sitting-rooms, giving the 
legal measure to each ; but it is often or commonly packed to 
contain between 600 and 700. The seats were divided among 
the heritors by the Sheriff of Aberdeen in the year 1790, and the 
heritors have again divided them among their tenants, and some 
of the heritors receive from Is. to 2s. for each sitting-room. 
There are no free sitting-rooms ; and many say they would re- 
gularly attend at church if they had a seat. The manse was 
built in 1768, and is in a good state of repair at present. The 
glebe contains 5 acres of good land, which may be valued at 
L. 3 per acre. The stipend is L. 53, lis. '2d. money ; 106 bolls 
of oatmeal, at 8 stones per boll, old weight, equal to nearly 10 
stones per boll, imperial weight ; and 42 1- quarters of bear. 

There is one chapel in the parish belonging to the United As- 
sociate Secession Church. The minister's stipend is paid by sub- 
scriptions and seat-rents, and amounts to L.70 annually. The 
whole number of Dissenters of every denomination in the parish is 
about 200 ; consequently, those who belong to the Established 
Church amount to 1400. The average number of communicants 
for several years past has been 550. The average amount of 
collections for behoof of the poor at the church has been L. 57 
per annum. 

Education—There are four schools in this parish. 1. The 
parochial school, where the teacher receives all the legal emolu- 
ments. The amount of his school fees may be L. 12, 10s. per 
annum : and he has L.25 a year from Dick's Trustees. His salary 
payable by the heritors is L. 27 per annum. The branches taught 
are, Greek, Latin, geography, mathematics, navigation, arith- 
metic, writing, reading, English. There is one school endowed 
with a few acres of land ; and two schools, the teachers of which 
depend entirely upon the school-fees. There are about 120 scholars 
attending these four schools. Very few persons between the age

receiving parochial aid is 30 ; of these few receive more than L. 2,

PRESBYTEEY OF DEER, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. JOHN GUMMING, MINISTER. 



1. — Topography and Natural History. 
Situation. — This parish is situated upon the east coast of Scot- 
land, in that part of Aberdeenshire called Buchan; and the town of 
Fraserburgh is eighteen miles to the west of Peterhead, and 
twenty-one miles by the old road, but twenty-six miles by the new 
one, eastward from Banff, the next town of any consequence 
upon the coast. 

Name. — From records of an old date, it appears, that the name 
of this parish was originally Philorth ; this being the name of the 
estate of the patron and principal proprietor. A town and har- 
bour, however, having been built early in the sixteenth century, 
and the town erected into a burgh of regality in October 1613, 
it was called Fraserburgh, no doubt in honour of Sir Alexander 
Fraser of Philorth, who obtained the charter. 

Extent, 8fc. — The parish is at an average about 3 miles broad, 
and nearly 8 miles long : the land gradually rising from the coast 
to its most distant and elevated district. Owing, however, to one 
of those irregularities, which were fallen into in the division of many 
parishes, the upper part is intersected for the space of nearly an 
English mile by the adjacent parish of Rathen. According to mea- 
surement, it contains a little more than 10,000 acres, and though 
the soil, like that of other parishes upon the coast, is in many places 
sandy and light, yet in others it is partly clay and loam. The rest is 
more gravelly, and interspersed with a few mosses and moors. It ex- 
tends along the coast about 4 miles, nearly two of which to the 
south of the town are low and sandy, bounded by hillocks, over- 
grown with bent. The rest is rocky and flat, except Kinnaird's 
head, a high land projecting into the sea, which is generally be- 
lieved to be the « Promontorium Taixalium" of Ptolemy, being 
the turning point into the " iEstuarium Varariie," or Murray Frith. 
From Kinnaird's head the land trends due west on the one hand, 



2fj0 ABERDEENSHIRE. 

and on the other makes a curve to the south-east, forming th 
bay of Fraserburgh. The sea has receded from the land m som 
places, and encroached on it in others. Westward of Kmnajrd s 
head, is a stony beach, evidently thrown up by the sea. Many 
of the benty hillocks, which skirt the bay, stand upon moss or 
clay ; and in 1760, a tree with roots and branches, and a stem 
twenty feet long, was found entire under the sand withm the h.gL 
water-mark. By a strong south-east wind, the sands on this shore, 
if dry, are drifted ; and, were they not intercepted by the bents, 
would overspread the adjacent fields. Bent therefore, ought to 
be carefully preserved, especially that kind of it which grows m 
the hay here, resembling the river-bulrush in length of joint, thick- I 
ness of reed, and largeness of leaf and top, and which is seemmg- 
ly upon increase. It would appear that this parish at one time 
aboimded with .-ood. Large roots of tres, mostly oak s til re- 
main in the mosses; and about Philorth House, the seat of Loid 
Saltoun, is some old timber, to which several plantations have 
been added. But owing to the marine atmosphere, and the strong 
winds which sometimes blow here from north and the east 
trees and hedges are reared with no small difficulty. The only 
of any magnitude in this district is that of Mormond covered 
mosJand\eath, standing 810 feet above the level of the sea 
and is the more conspicuous, as the surrounding country is to a 
considerable extent low and champaign. In various parts of the 
mrith are mineral springs of a chalybeate nature ; one of which 
n the soXastLnerof -hich has been deemed 

usefu l as a tonic for weak stomachs, and over which a well has been 
e ted for the more convenient use of those, who choose to avail 
TemLlvesofit. From the upper end of the town a bed of lime- 
iTe ns to the south, out of which a. quarry has been dug, and 
- stones obtained for building the houses of the town, and the pier, 
of the 1 a bour. There is'also abundance of gramte in the uppe 
pa of r parish, and ironstone of a good quality also abounds 
am nt the rocks on the coast, but which has been seldom wrought

the interior of the country, and snow, wiien it does fall, soon 
dissolves. Hence it is, perhaps, that we are seldom visited with 
any epidemic distemper, and escaped the cholera, when it was 
prevailing- elsewhere. Upon the south side of the parish flows 
the water of Philorth, which takes its rise in the upper district, 
and, increased in its course by a few tributary streams, discharges 
itself into the sea. The bay, to which we have already adverted, 
is the most interesting- natural object at Fraserburgh. It is about 
three miles long, and attracts the notice of every stranger as he 
approaches the town from the south, and exhibits to him a beau- 
tiful and delightful scene in a fine summer day, when there is 
clear sunshine and a profound calm, and many vessels are there 
riding at anchor. 

II. Civil, HlSTOKY. 

Antiquities. — There are in this parish the ruins of two chapels, 
one of which was probably a seminary of considerable repute, as 
it is called the College, at which some of the monks of the Abbey 
of Deer resided. Near this is a well, where the superstitious 
practice of leaving some trifle, after drinking of its waters, obtain- 
ed for a considerable time j but which now seems to be given up. 

At the west end of the town is an old quadrangular tower of 
three stories, which formed part of a large building originally in- 
tended for a college by Sir Alexander Fraser of Philorth, who, in 
1592, obtained a charter from the Crown, in which powers were 
given to erect and endow a college and university, — to appoint a 
rector, a principal, a sub-principal, and all the professors for teach- 
ing the different sciences they should think proper and necessary, 
— and to make laws for the preservation of good order, with autho- 
rity to enforce them. Every immunity and privilege of an univer- 
sity was granted for it, as appears from the following words of the 
charter :—" In amplissima forma, et modo debito, in omnibus 
respectibus, ut conceditur et datur cuicunque collegio et univer- 
sitati intra regnum nostrum erecto seu erigendo." In 1597, the 
General Assembly recommended Mr Charles Frame, at that time 
inmister here, to be principal ; but owing to some cause, which has 
not been sufficiently explained, most probably to the want of funds, 
the matter here stopped, for nothing farther was done in it. 

On Kinnaird's Head another old tower remains, called the Wine 
Tower, most probably so called because it was the wine-cellar of 
tho.se who at one time resided in the adjoining house, which is now 
the hght-house. Under this tower is a cave, penetrating into the 
ock more than 100 feet. 



252  ABERDEENSHIRE. 

In this parish there are also some ruins of Danish or Pictis| 
houses, as they are usually called. These are about 10 feet 
sauare with a door and hearthstone evidently marked with fi e; 
aTd" hie though insignificant in themselves, serve to show that 
the inhabitants of this part of Aberdeenslure were at one tune of 
Scandinavian origin. 

III. — Population. 
According to the census of 1791, the population amounted to 
22V6 of 1811, to 2271 ; and of 1831, to 2964: and bj a census 
lalw tken at Ae request of the General Assembly's Commmee 
tf cI Extension, it was found to be 3080 ; of »l,on, there 
te 700 under twelve jears of age. It appears that the pnnc - 
Z increase was from 1811 to 1831, v,hich is to be ascnbed chref- 
V to the herring-fishery, which began to be prosecuted upon an ex- 
tensive scale in'lSlS. The fishermen also marry at au early p - 
riod of ife. The number of marriages is, at an average, about 
36 and births, 60. But no register of the number of deaths 
h; been hitherto kept, though the people have been called upon 
to av themselves of it. There is reason to behave, however 
thaTthese do not exceed 60. During the hemng-fishery, which 
crTencesln July, and closes in September, there ,s an n,orease 
„f r nonulation o no less than 1200, so that, owmg to the actrvr- 
t Ind bust which then prevail, the town and the harbour have a

lie roup, they are always advertised for letting, — the former te- 
nant generally receiving a preference, when his offer is within ten 
per cent, of the highest ; and in unfavourable seasons Lord Sal- 
toun makes liberal deductions to his tenants. The soil here is 
well adapted to green crop, and produces all kinds of grain ; so 
that this parish not only supplies itself with all kinds of provisions, 
but annually exports a large quantity of barley, oats, and potatoes, 
of good quality. The distinction of infield and outfield has long 
ago ceased, and a regular rotation of cropping is now followed. 
For that purpose there is here abundance of manure. Besides an 
inexhaustible store of shell-sand, and a constant supply of sea- 
weed or ware, the farmers avail themselves of fish refuse for ma- 
nure, of which there is also a large quantity during the herring- 
fishery. Bone-manure is also successfully applied to dry soils. 

Wages. — The wages for male farm-servants are from lu 3 to 
L. 6 Sterling, and for female from L.l, 5s. to L.'i, 10s. in the half 
year. 

Live-Stock. — The rearing of cattle for the market has always 
been a principal object of concern with the farmer; but, ow- 
ing to the admission of all kinds, the Buchan, or native breed, 
which is deservedly esteemed, has been considerably diminished. 
There are, nevertheless, many of good size and quality ; and some 
farmers have of late introduced the Teeswater, by which it is ex- 
pected the breed will be improved. The price of cattle has risen 
of late, and a new market has been opened for them by exportation 
to London, which has hitherto brought a profitable return. There 
are no sheep-farms in the parish — a few only are reared upon 
ground of inferior quality. 

Though many of the fields are inclosed, yet it is much to b 
regretted, that the system of inclosure is not universally follow- 
ed out, and that the tenantry are still without sufficient accommo- 
dation as to dwelling-house and offices. When any alteration to 
the better in this respect is effected, it is generally by the tenant's 
laymg out the money himself, with consent of the proprietor, who 
agrees to deduct it at the expiration of the lease; or then still 
evades the expense, by requiring of the incoming tenant to repay 
It under the designation of " dead inventory ;" an expedient which 
IS no less unfavourable to the interests of the proprietor than to 
those of the tenant. 

The Toton and Civil History of the Parish.— The town is situated 
upon the south side of Kinnaird's Head, and is nearly of a square 



254 ABERD-EENSlilUE- 

figure; most of the streets crossing eacli other at right angles ; . 
the lower part of it adjacent to the harbour he bay A 
considerable number of new houses have been bud withm these 
few years; and new openings are making and new streets are laid 
off, according to a plan, which was resolved upon about twenty-five 
yers ago. There are now 180 tenements, each of which contains 
from 20 to 22 falls. The price of each lot is fmm L- '0 to 33 
Sterling, besides an annual feu-duty of 4d. per fall. 1 he old tol- 
booth, town-house, and cross, were erected by Sir Alexander 
Eraser, the superior, and disponed to the feuars by the charr of 
erection. The cross is reckoned a fine structure. It is a hexa- 
.on with three equidistant angular abutments; the area of the 
base is 500 feet ; by nine intrenchings the top - eon racted to 23 
feet, on the middle of which is raised a stone pillar 12 feet high 
The British arms, surmounting the armorial coat of Frasev of 
Philorth, adorn the summit. The jail, though still remaining, is 
falling into ruins, and is of no use. Fraserburgh is one of the old 
burghs of regality, Slaving its government vested in Lord Saltoun, 
the superior, two bailies, a dean of guild, a treasurer, and a coun- 
cil His Lordship has the right and the authority of provost, with 
power to nominate and appoint yearly the new magistrates and 
council, with the advice and consent of the old. By the charter, the 
feuars and incorporated brethren of the guild have liberty to exercise 
all kinds of trade and merchandise. Those, who are not freemen, 
niay be debarred this privilege ; but, for a long penod this exclu- 
sion has not been insisted on. The feuars are obliged to uphold 
the public works of the town ; but, for doing so, the market cus- 
toms were granted them; and in lieu of some privileges which 
■ they possessed over commonable lands, they have obtained others 
from Lord Saltoun, which now rent at L. 58 Sterhng per annum. 
These funds have been hitherto applied to repairing the streets, 
and opening new ones, but chiefly to bringing water mto the town 
or domestic use, of which its inhabitants stood in g-at need and 
of which there is now an ample supply. It is not improbable, how- 
ever, that this burgh will soon undergo such a change in its con- 
stitution, as has been lately effected in others. 
'' tHs Harlour and Trade.s seamen were won to seek f 
shelter to their vessels upon this coast at an early per.od, a ha bou

east, a northern pier, of about 300 yards in lengtli, was begun to 
be built in 1807, and was completed in 1812. It was soon found, 
however, that the sea here, though repelled, found its way into 
the harbour in a way no less detrimental to the shipping, by a cir- 
cuitous run into it at the extreme point, which, passing along the 
interior, produced an agitation to the vessels, against which no 
mooring could afford proper security. There was, therefore, much 
dissatisfaction with it and complaint ; and in order to remedy that 
evil, and for enlarging and improving the harbour, an application 
was made for an act of Parliament, which was obtained in 1818. A 
south pierwas accordingly built, of correspondingextent to the north 
one ; and since then, a middle pier has been erected, broader and 
even superior to the other two, within which vessels lie in perfect 
safety during the most violent storms. The expenditure upon the 
whole, since 1807, has been about L. 30,000 Sterling, and when the 
contemplated improvements are completed, it will be the best tide- 
harbour on the east coast of Scotland, between it and Burntisland, 
according to the report of an eminent engineer, Robert Steven- 
son, Esq. of Edinburgh. The area enclosed as a harbour is up- 
wards of six Scotch acres, nearly one-half of which has been exca- 
vated along the piers and jetties as birthing- places. The harbour 
is of easy access, having a depth of about six feet water at the 
piers' head at low water, and of twenty feet at high spring tides. 
Being situated at the immediate entrance to the Moray Frith, 
and at the northern extremity of a deep and extensive bay, 
which affords excellent anchorage for ships of every size, it is of 
great importance to the shipping interest in general. There are 
eight vessels from 45 to 1 55 tons burthen belonging to the port, 
and 220 boats engaged in the herring fishery. The exportations 
for 1835 of grain, namely of wheat, barley, oats, pease and beans, 
were 12,000 quarters ; of potatoes 6000 bolls ; of fish, dried and 
pickled cod, to the value of L. 2000 Sterling, and of herrings 
about 16,000 barrels; the herring-fishery giving employment to 
1600 people. The articles imported are chiefly timber, coals, lime, 
tiles, brick, salt, and goods for shopkeepers, of whom there are 30 ; 
and, including innkeepers, there are 28 who have spirit licenses. 
The harbour dues were originally only L. 65 per annum, but they 
now amount to L. 1 100 Sterling per annum. Coals are now import- 
ed here at the rate of 4s. 4d. per imperial boll, from Newcastle and 
Sunderland ; but though this be a high price for them, they are 
considered to afford to those who reside in the town as cheap fuel

as peat, which costs about L. 5 Sterling per leat, including all ex. 

The manufacture of kelp has been so much affected by the 
prevaihng use of barilla, that the shores here, which at one time 
it for L.150 Sterling, for that purpose, do not now bring above 
. L.15 Sterling per annum. Rope and sail-making are also carr.ed 

on to a small extent. 

V —Parochial Economy. . 
Ecclesiastical State.-There are tlu-ee clergymen ; the minis er 
of the Established Church, that of the Scotch Episcopal Church, 
and that of the Independent congregation Of aopu 
there are belonging to the Establishment, 2703; and 377 who are 
Dissenters The parish church, which stands about the middle of 
t" near the'cross, was rebuilt in 1802, and is a plain good 
structure and capable of containing 1 000 sitters. Part of the sit- 
t ; a" ree, and the rest are all nearly let at f;.m Is. to 4s. per 
stinc. The church has a spire with a bell, which was built by sub- 
scription, and cost about L. 300 Sterling. A new manse was built 
n I'sis/upon a new site, at the south end of the town upon a 
Piece of rising ground, beside the road leading to Aberdeen and 
Peterh ad. It is a good plain house, but not so large as other 
manses which have ben more recently built within the bounds of 
the presbytery. The stipend is 16 chalders of victual, one-half meal, 
and the other half barley, with L. 10 Sterling for commumon ele- 
ments The glebe, including the site of the manse and garden adjoin- 
L is only a little more than four acres and a quarter in extent, and 
theVreater part of it land of inferior quality. The attendance upon 
religious ordinances is considerable, and there are mcreaing symp- 
oms of religious improvement. One of the great evils with which 
eligion has had to contend here, as elsewhei., is the excessive use 
of spirituous liquors ; and not until the labourmg classes themselves 
come to see the folly and madness of expending their earmngs m 
he" use, will the evil be overcome. Various regulations have been 
aid dTwii for restraining their use, particularly during the herring 
fishery but these have hitherto been only partially observed 
Salln,s Bank.-A savings' bank could not be established here 
HI 1 flio • nor did the labouring classes seem to have at first 
r confid;nc in its utility to which it was entitled. But it. is now 
' 'leding ; the amount of the deposits having been nearly doubled 
in the course of the present and the preceding year. 

Societies.-Theve are two societies for the diffusion of 



FRASERBURGH. 



257 



ligioiis knowledge at home and abroad, and one of these has a pa- 
rochial library, containing such books only as are calculated to pro- 
mote that great object. 

Education. — The parochial school is attended by about 100 
children, and of these there are generally from 20 to 30 girls. 
The salary of the teacher is L.29, 18s. lOd. Sterling. The amount 
of fees is about L. 50 Sterling- per annum, and as he has the bene- 
fit of Dick's bequest, and is session-clerk, his income altogether 
may amount to L. 130 Sterling per annum. The branches taught 
at the school are, the English, Latin, Greek, and French lan- 
guages ; writing, arithmetic, algebra, mathematics, geography, and 
navigation. The books used are, Wood's English Collection; 
Lennie's English Grammar; Simpson's History of England and 
Scotland; the Latin classics; Moore's Greek Grammar; Greek 
New Testament; Dalzel's Greca Minora; Porquet's Parisian 
Grammar; French Fables and Telemaque; Morrison's Book-keep- 
ing; Bonnycastle's Algebra; Davidson's Mathematics ; Hamilton's 
Arithmetic; Norris's Navigation ; Scott's Beauties; M'Culloch's 
Progressive Exercises in Science and Literature ; and the Assem- 
bly's Catechism with Scripture Proofs. The interrogatory or in- 
tellectual system was adopted by the present schoolmaster, and 
continues to be prosecuted with much advantage to his pupils, 
and credit to himself. Besides the parochial school, there are 
nine others, all upon the teachers' own adventure ; four of 
them by male, and five by female teachers. It is usual for parents 
to place their children' when very young under female teachers, 
both to preserve them from accidents, to which they might be ex- 
posed, by being allowed to roam in the streets without any one to 
look after them, and to prepare them by instruction in the ele- 
ments of education for afterwards going to the parochial, or other 
schools, where the higher branches are taught. By returns lately 
obtained, it appears that there are about 500 children throughout 
the parish receiving education at its schools. There are eight 
Sunday schools, attended by about 300 children. 

Poor and Parochial Funds — The number of the poor upon the 
roll is 80, who are relieved, according to the old system, by collec- 
tions at the door of the parish church, which amount to about 
L. 100 Sterling per annum; by the greater part of the dues for 
proclamation of banns ; and by the interest of a fund of L.700 Ster- 
ling. The fund is made up of bequests from wealthy and gene- 
rous mdividuals, who belonged to the parish, or who had previous-

Iv resided in it foi- a considerable time. The annual amount Jis- 

tributed has been generally about L. 160 Sterling; b"' '' 

it was nearly L.200 Sterling, and there .s no appearance at pre- 

sent of its diminution. 

MiscELlANEOUS Observations. 
From the foregoing statement, it appears that the town and pa- 

rish ot Fr'serburghhave participated in the general .mprovement 
f the count; since the publiea'tion of the 'o-r S— 1 

eount • that its population has had an mcrease of 865 souls, w.th a 
responlg e'nlirgement of the town; at a new capac 
secure, and excellent harbour has been erected, nd 'he herring 
fishery and other branches of trade, have been earned on to a con- 
•table extent, and with much success; ''at -avmgs bank ha 
been established, which is now prospering ; and that great attention 
t naid to the proper education of the young. Various o her im- 
Iv m nts are iu contemplation, which, by the favour of Dmne 
CXce, and the spirit of enterprise which now exists, will, ere 
long, be accomplished.

sea coast; but it is more probable that, at the time the parish was 
erected, they formed a separate estate, belonging to the then pro- 
. prietor of Aberdour, who would naturally wish to have all his land- 
ed property in one parish. At the rate of 640 imperial acres to 
each, the whole extent of the parish contains about 24 square miles. 

Boundaries, Sfc. — The parish is bounded on the north by the 
shores of the Moray Frith ; on the east, by the parishes of Pitsligo, 
Tyrie, Fraserburgh, and Strichen ; on the south, by New Pitsli- 
go, which forms part of the parish of Tyrie, New Deer, and 
King- Edward ; and on the west, by the burn of Nethermill, which 
separates it from Gamrie, and which forms the boundary between 
the counties of Aberdeen and Banff. 

Topographical Appearances. — There are, properly speaking, no 
high mountains in the parish, but the whole estate of Auchmedden, 
which forms the west side of it, is elevated 200 or 300 feet above the 
level of the sea ; while the estate of Aberdour, or eastern divi- 
sion, is comparatively flat and low, with little inequality of surface. 
The mosses, moors, and barren land bear a very great proportion 
to that which is under cultivation. The soil of the farms along the 
coast is, in many places, good, consisting of a strong loamy clay, 
and producing, when properly managed, excellent crops of grain. 
It may be proper to remark, that the estate of Auchmedden is 
intersected by several dens, or deep ravines, which have a roman- 
tic appearance, and afford a rich field for the botanist. There 
are various caves along the coast, having their entrance from the 
sea. The most remarkable is that called Cowshaven, on the farm 
of Ironhill, at the north-east corner of the parish, and which served 
as a hiding-place to the late Lord Pitsligo after the battle of Cul- 
loden. The interior of this dungeon is now of difficult access, 
the mouth being choked by the earth falling from above, or by 
sand and pebbles thrown up by the sea. In the centre of this 
apartment is a well, cut out of the solid rock, by the hands of the 
Noble Lord himself, during his confinement in this subterranean 
cavern. The mother of my informant, then a girl of sixteen years 
of age, procured him tools for this purpose, and supplied him with 
food and other necessaries of life ; but at last he was compelled 
to quit his prison-house, his dreary abode having been discovered 
by her footsteps in the snow. The whole of the sea coast is bold, 
picturesque, and rocky, particularly to the westward of the manse, 
about a mile from which, upon the estate of Auchmedden, is Pit- 
jossie, a stupendous natural arch, through which the tide flows at

dark mossy water beino- in some places of considerable depth, and 
frequented at certain seasons by great flocks of geese and ducks. 
This is the only loch or lake of any description in the parish. 
There are no large rivers, and almost all the small streams or ri- 
vulets discharge themselves into the Moray Frith, which forms 
the northern boundary of the parish. 

In the Den of Dardar, near Pitjossie, there is a cascade, which 
sometimes in the winter season, and after a heavy flood of rain, 
has rather a grand and striking appearance. The water dashes 
from the top of a rock into three successive basins, and upon 
reaching the bottom, glides smoothly into the Moray Frith, at the 
distance of about 100 yards. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The geology and mineralogy of this 
parish would afford materials for a small volume, and the task 
could only be undertaken by a scientific man, after visiting and 
minutely examining the localities. The rocks which bound the 
shore are highly interesting, of stupendous height, and various 
formation. A coarse sandstone prevails along the coast, often 
passing into conglomerate of various degrees of coarseness, and 
connected with a greywacke slate. This sandstone, I am inform- 
ed, is accounted at present of the oldest secondary formation, 
and is destitute of all traces of organic remains. This is the 
case also with the slate. The outlying blocks of loose stone, 
or boulders, are primary trap or granite. A few years ago, in 
the neighbouring parish of Gamrie, there was an accidental 
developement of fossil Jish, imbedded in rolled masses of clay or 
limestone ; and it is the opinion of an eminent geologist, who 
has favoured me with a communication upon the subject, that in- 
teresting facts might be brought to light, by searching the dens 
or deep ravines which run inward from the coast in this parish, 
and in which it is not improbable that something similar might 
be discovered. With these brief remarks we shall leave the sub- 
ject to those who are capable of doing it justice. 

Zoology. — At one period, there was a pair of eagles that regu- 
larly nestled and brought forth their young in the rocks of Pen- 
nan, but, according to the tradition of the country, when the late 
Earl of Aberdeen purchased the estate from the Bairds, the for- 
mer proprietors, the eagles disappeai'ed, in fulfilment of a pro- 
phecy by Thomas the Rymer, that there should he an eagle in the 
Crags, while there was a Baird in Auchmedden. But the most re- 
markable circumstance, and what certainly [appears incredible, is, 



262 ABEIIUEENSHIRE. 



that when Lord Haddo, eldest son of the Earl of Aberdeen, mar- 
ried Miss Christian Baird of New Byth, the eagles returned to the 
rocks, and remained until the estate passed into the hands of the 
Honourable William Gordon, when they again fled, and have never 
since been seen in the country. These facts, marvellous as they 
may appear, are attested by a cloud of living witnesses. What is  
called the Aberdeenshire or Buchan breed is almost the only spe- 
cies of cattle reared in this district. Some attempts have been 
made to introduce the short-horn or Teeswater breed, but to cat-  
tie of this description neither farmers nor graziers appear to be at 

TheMoray Frith abounds with a vast variety of fish of the best i 
quality. Those taken by the fishermen of Pennan, according to 
their wn statement, are the following : Haddocks, cod-fish, hng, 
tusk, skate, mackerel, whiting, cole-fish, turbot halibut sole grey 
flounders, spotted flounders, herrings, dog-fish, cat-fish, horse- 
mackerel, hake, thornback, guard-fish, black brim, lump-fish, sea- 
sow gurnet. Blind Harry, miller's thumb, sharks, kettock, lobsters, 
crabs, conger-eels, &amp;c. A few salmon are sometimes seen at the 
mouth of the fresh-water streams which run into the sea, but, owing 
to the scantiness of their number, and the rocky nature o the 
coast, there never has been, and in all probability never will be, 
any regular salmon-fishing. The produce would not defray the ex- 
pense. There are countless myriads of cockles, hmpets, &amp;c which 
the fishermen catch, not so much as an article of ood as for bait 
to their hooks. For some years back, in the months of July, Au- 
gust, and September, the herring-fishery has been prosecuted to 
Lat extent along the shores of the Moray Fnth, to the irn- 
poverishment and demoralization of the fishers, and with but little 

advantage to the curers. 

The caterpillar, green fly, and that insect, whatever its name 
may be, which causes the disease in fruit trees, called American 
blight, are the great scourges of the gardens, and the tory, or grub- 
worm, of the corn fields. , r o:, riinrlps 
Botany -The dens of Auchmedden, the property of Sir Charles 
Forbes, Bart, are perhaps the richest field for botany in the united 
kingdom. Here, in the summer months. Flora pours forth all her 
treasures. Besides the plants common to almost every part ot 
rberdeenshire, here are to be found, within the compass of a mile 
t'Zt Zy of the rarest species. The following are a few spe- 
cimens, in the order of the sexual system laid down by Lmnaus.

This last is considered a very rare plant, and not to be found, so 
far as is known to the writer of this report, in any other station in 
Aberdeenshire. The above are a few species selected almost at 
random from the different classes, — for the variety in the dens is 
so great, that the bare enumeration of them would occupy more 
space than can be afforded in a statistical account. 

About fifty or sixty years ago, as I am informed, the medical 
men from the Infirmary at Aberdeen were in the practice of paying 
annual visits to the dens of Auchmedden, for the purpose of col- 
lecting plants for medicinal purposes, and their labours, no doubt, 
were richly rewarded. 

- At the commencement of the present century, there was not a 
tree to be seen in the parish, with the exception of a solitary moun- 
tain ash upon the glebe, below the old church ; but there is now 
a considerable plantation upon Sir Charles Forbes's property, in a 
tolerably thriving state, consisting of Scotch firs, larch, spruce, 
alders, ash, plane-tree, &amp;c. Throughout the greater part of Buchan, 
wood is of very difficult growth, the country being flat and bare, 
and destitute of shelter. 

II. — Civil History. 
• There is no reason to believe that there is any ancient or mo- 
dern history of the parish, either printed or in manuscript, extant, 
the former Statistical Account excepted. The parish has been

repeatedly surveyed, and there are plans of the separate estates in 
the possession of the respective proprietors. The estate of Aber- 
dour was surveyed about twenty years ago, when it was purchased 
by Mr Dingwall of Brucklay from Mr Gordon, the, former pro- 
prietor ; and Auchmedden was surveyed in 1610, and again in 
1 839. There are only two heritors in the parish, John Uutl Ding- 
wall, Esq. of Brucklay, proprietor of the estate of Aberdour, com- 
prising three-fifths of the whole, and Sir Charles Forbes, Bart, of 
Auchmedden, proprietor of the two remaining fifths. 

Parochial Register. -The parochial register of this parish was 
supposed to be the oldest in the Church of Scotland, but by some 
unaccountable accident, the most ancient part of it was lost about 
the Year 1815, and what now remains commences at the year 
1698 It is very regularly kept, but the baptismal register is very 
defective, owing to the extreme negligence of parents in getting 
their children's names inserted. It is hoped that this evil will soon 
be remedied by legislative enactment. ■,   i , 

Antiquities.- a place called Chapelden, in the land of Auch- 
medden, the ruins of a Roman Catholic chapel are still to be seen, 
on a haugh opposite the Toar of .Troup. The walls are completely 
demolished, and nothing remains but a heap of stones, which have 
been held sacred by the husbandman; for although in the midst o a 
cultivated field, they have never been touched by the plough, i he 
only fort, or castle, in the parish is that of Dundargue for a par- 
ticular description of which, reference is made to the former Sta- 
tistical Account. In addition to what is there stated, it may be 
proper to observe, that when Edward Baliol came to claim the 
kingdom of Scotland, Sir Thomas Beaumont accompanied him, 
and took and garrisoned the Castle of Dundargue m right of his 
wife, she being the eldest daughter of Cummine, Earl of Buchan, 
who had no male issue, and to whom the castle belonged. 

There are numerous cairns and tumuli scattered through the 
parish. Such as have been opened have been found to contain a 
rude stone coffin, enclosing the bones or ashes of  -- ' 
A cairn on the farm of Towie, on the estate of Auchmedden, cal- 
led Brodies Cairn, deserves particular notice. My "f'-" f ' 
members three cairns of the same name, but with regard to tb s 
Tne in particular, the tradition is as follows: A farmer o he 
name ofBrodie murdered his mother, whose body was brough to 
the gate of the church-yard of Aberdour, and every individua m 
the parish called upon to apply the hand to the naked corpse.

under the superstitious belief that the blood would guah upon the 
murderer. It was observed, that during the time this was going 
on, her son carefully kept at a distance, and showed great reluc- 
tance to approach the body, and that, when recourse was about to 
be had to compulsion, he confessed the murder. The tradition 
farther states, that the murderer was drawn and quartered, and 
that his four Hmbs were buried on the sides of four roads lead- 
ino- to the church of Aberdour. So much for ancient supersti- 
tion. 

Modern Buildings.— There are no modern buildings of any note 
in the parish, with the exception of the church and manse, of which 
afterwards. The meal mill at Aberdour was lately new roofed and 
slated, and there was a mill of the same description lately erected 
at Nethermill, for the accommodation of the tenants on the estate 
of Auchmedden. They are built partly of granite, and partly of 
a sort of red rock or sandstone, which abounds in the parish, and 
which, when harled, is very durable. 

III. — Population. 
At a remote period, the parish must have been very thinly 
peopled, as is evident from the extensive tracts of waste and un- 
cultivated ground at the present day, notwithstanding the stimulus 
given to improvement by the high price of agricultural produce 
during the last war. Some hundred years ago, there is reason to 
believe, that the land upon the sea coast alone was cultivated, 
and that what may be called the back-settlements of the parish, 
-was little better than a barren wilderness. The population has 
progressively increased since the commencement of the present 
century. This increase is partly to be attributed to the erection 
of the village of New Aberdour, in the year 1798, and which 
contains 300 inhabitants; but arises chiefly from the annual num- 
ber of births exceeding the deaths by more than one-half. Last 
year 1834 the number of births was 44, of deaths, 20. Deduct- 
ing from the gross population in 1831 the inhabitants of New 
Aberdour, amounting to 302, and those in the fishing village of 
Pennan, which may be stated at 180, there remains 1066 as the 
sum total of the population residing in the country. There being 
no regular and complete register of births, deaths, and marriages, 
. it is impossible to ascertain, with perfect accuracy, the annual 
average for the last seven years. The following is near the truth : 
births, 40; deaths, 18; marriages, 14.

30 and 50, 343 
50 and 70, 209 
upwards of 70, 91 

Total, 1646 

Thus it appears, that if the last census was accurately taken, 
which is very doubtful, there is an increase of nearly 100 since 
1831. 

The number of unmarried females above 45 is 

men and bachelors above 50, 
widowers upwards of 60, 
widows, - - - 

The only person of independent fortune residing in the parish 
is William Gordon, Esq. the former proprietor of the estate of 
Aberdour, and who still occupies the family mansion and manor 
farm.f There are two proprietors of land of the yearly value of 
upwards of L.60, both non-resident. The average number of 
children in each family may be about 3. 

Character of the People. — The people, for the most part, are 
of the middle-size, muscular, and well-proportioned. There is 
no insane person in the parish, only two of rather weak intellect, 
two partially blind, and none deaf. 

The language spoken is the broad Buchan, or real Aberdeen- 
shire, and this dialect is much the same as it was forty years ago. 
There is nothing peculiar in the popular customs, games, and 
amusements which prevail in this district. The habits of the 
people are sober and industrious, and, as far as their circumstances 
will admit, cleanly in the highest degree. In their style and manner 
of dress, there has been of late years a marked improvement. The 
principal food of the peasantry consists of bread made of oatmeal, 
pottage, brose, milk, and potatoes. Scotch kale or cabbage, which 
at one period constituted an essential part of the food of the lower 
orders, is not now in very general use. The people, notwith- 
standing the pressure of the times, are contented and happy, 
of a social and obliging disposition, shrewd and intelligent, re- 
gular in their attendance upon pubhc worship, and the ordinan- 
ces of religion, as well as in the performance of the duties of 
life. Strangers to that fanaticism which acts as a nurse to sedi- 
tion, and that pharisaical hypocrisy which serves as a cloak to the

most heinous sins, their maxim is, " to fear God, honour the King, 
and not meddle with those that are given to change." 

There is Uttle scope for poaching in the parish, as game is very 
strictly preserved, and . the only persons accused of violating the game 
laws are the fishermen, almost all of whom are possessed of guns, 
ostensibly for the purpose of killing sea-fowl, for the sake of the 
oil and feathers, and who may, perhaps, occasionally take a shot at 
a hare or a partridge. Smuggling, at one period, was carried on 
here to a great extent; the almost inacessible rocks and caves on 
the shores of the Moray Frith affording peculiar facilities for this 
species of traffic. Since the establishment of the Preventive Coast 
Guard, however, it has been completely suppressed, there being no 
such thing as an attetnpt ever made to land a single anker of 
brandy, a keg of gin, a box of tea, or a bale of tobacco.

The wood generally planted consists of Scotch fir, spruce, 
larch, alder, ash, elm, plane-tree, and mountain- ash. In the hol- 
lows and sheltered situations, it is in a very thriving state, but upon 
the high grounds, where it is more exposed to the sea blast, the 
plants are extremely stunted, and making little or no progress. It 
is much to be regretted that due attention is not paid to thinning, 
pruning, and filling up the vacant spaces with fresh plants. It is 
only by patient perseverance, and supplying the deficiencies as 
they occur, that wood can ever be raised in a country so bare and 
exposed, as is the greater part of Buchan. The average rate of 
grazing for an ox or cow may be stated at L. 2, and for a full- 
grown sheep per annum at 15s. 

Rate of Wages. — Servants are almost universally engaged for 
six months, and the rate of wages for a first-rate man servant is 
about L. 6 ; for a second rate servant, L. 5 ; and for a third rate, 
L. 3. The wages of the women vary from L. 1 to L. 3, according 
to their qualifications. Artisans are chiefly paid by the piece. 
Masons, when employed by the day, receive about 2s. ; and carpen- 
ters much the same, without victuals. Smiths are always paid by 
the piece. 

Hnshandry, — There is nothing very peculiar in the style of hus- 
bandry pursued in this parish. The best land in it yields a yearly 



2G8 ABEllDEENSI-llUE. 

rent of from L. 1, 10s. to L.2, 10s., and the inferior quaUties from 
10s. to L. 1. The average may be considered about L. 1 Sterhng. 

Leases.— The leases in this parish, and, indeed, throughout the 
whole of Aberdeenshire, are generally granted for a term of nme- 
teen years. A lease for a shorter period would certauily be very 
much against the interest of both landlord and tenant, as it would 
operate as a bar to improvement, and, consequently, to any mcrease 
in the value of the land. 

The only inclosures in the parish are upon the manor farm ot 
Aberdour, Coburty, Ironhill, and Powburn, -there being a great 
deficiency of stones for building dikes, and little encouragement 
given for inclosing. The steadings upon the principal farms are 
tolerably good, for the most part covered with thatch or tiles, and 
but few of them slated. So long as farm produce afforded a re- 
munerating price to the agriculturist, the spirit of improvement, 
which was so conspicuous during the war, was kept alive, and a 
great deal of waste land brought into cultivation, but unless the 
rents are greatly reduced, now that the agricultural capital is ma 
great measure exhausted, land of inferior quality, of which there is 
a great proportion in this parish, must be allowed to go to heather 
Between twenty and thirty years ago, the late Mr Dingwall of 
Brucklay purchased the estate of Aberdour, containing three- 
fifths of the parish, and found every thing connected with agricul- 
ture and rural economy in a most backward state There were 
scarcely any roads, bridges, or fences, and the arable land was in 
many places intermixed with, or surrounded by, bogs, mosses, and 
moo'rs. Any drains that had been cut were very inefficient, in 
consequence of there being no open ditches, or leading drains to 
receive the water. The fields were laid out in a very irregular 
manner, and no proper rotation of cropping was observed Mr 
Dingwall's first object was to open up the communication by re- 
pairfno- such lines of road as were capable of repair, and mak- 
ing new roads where wanted, and this indeed was everywhere 
Bridges also were built where necessary, and open ditches and 
water-courses executed at his expense. The general aspec of 
the whole property has undergone a change greater, perhaps, than 
any one in the district. But the value of this estate has been 
:hiefly enhanced by a new hue of road of upwards of seven mil , 
which runs through the whole property, from one end to the othe , 
planned and executed in the most judicious manner. The um 
Lgement of this estate has shewn; in the most convincing mannei , 



ABERDOUR. 



2G9 



that the Interests of landlord and tenant are the same, and that the 
only way of promoting the former is to cherish and give encourage- 
ment to the latter. The neighbouring estate of Anchmedden, the 
property of one of the most honourable and kind-hearted landlords 
in existence, affords a striking contrast to this. 

The obstacles to improvement arise chiefly from the low price of 
agricultural produce, the want of capital, the high rents, the 
trifling allowance given for building, inclosing, and draining, and 
with regard to the estate of Auchmedden, in particular, the non- 
residence of the proprietor, and the consequent gross neglect and 
mismanagement of the estate. 

Quarries. — Besides several quarries of granite and sandstone, 
there are two millstone quarries in the parish ; one upon the estate of 
Aberdour, called the Quarry of Coburty, which is not now wrought, 
and one in the rocks of Pennan, the stones taken from which are 
said to be the best in Britain. Formerly twelve able-bodied men 
were employed in cutting the millstones from the rock, the base 
of which is washed at high-water by the sea, but of late it has 
greatly decayed, in consequence of the high price put upon the 
stones. At one period the Pennan stones were sent to the south 
an.d west of Scotland, the demand being universal, but now there are 
only four or five men employed, who can scarcely earn a livelihood, 
as a single cargo, shipped to Aberdeen, may be said to be the whole 
annual produce of the quarry, although the rock is inexhaustible. 
L.6 Sterling is now charged for a stone 14 inches thick, nearly 
double the former price. The rent of the quarry is L. 50. 

Fishery. — There is a white-fishing at the sea-town of Pennan, 
on the estate of Auchmedden, consisting of six boats, with a com- 
plement of four men each, employed in taking the several species 
of fish already enumerated. Five long-boats have for some years 
gone to the herring-fishery at Macduff, Banff, and other stations 
upon the Moray Frith, there being no harbour at Pennan, and no 
proper accommodation for curing herring. The six white-fishing 
boats pay a rent of L. 20 Sterling to the proprietor, besides some 
dried fish annually. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of the raw produce of the 
parish, so far as the same can be ascertained, is as follows : — 

130 acres potatoes, . . L.780 0 0 

629 turnips, . . 1258 0 0 

200 bear and barley, with fodder, 900 0 0

The sizes of the farms are, 2 of 200 acres ; 4 of 150 do. ; 8 of 
1 00 do. ; 12 of 60 do. ; the remainder varying from 5 to 40 acres. 

Husbandnj.-The rotation generally followed in the parish is 
the seven-shift course :-l. fallow and turnip ; 2. barley or oats ; 3. 
grass, partly cut for hay, and partly for green food ; 4 pasture ; 
5 do. : 6. oats ; 7. oats. In two or three instances the follomng ro- 
tation is adopted : 1. fallow and green crop ; 2. oats and barley ; 
3. grass; 4 pasture ; 5. oats; 6. oats. Both of these rotations 
are in the opinion of some practical farmers, liable to objections, 
particularly the latter. In the village lands of New Aberdour, 
the four-shift course is sometimes followed, but the glebe is the 
only land in the parish farmed upon the favourite five-shitt course. 

Manufactures.— There is scarcely any manufacture in the parish 
that deserves the name. The making of kelp from sea-weed, 
which was formerly carried on along the whole breadth ot the 
shore, from east to west, is now almost entirely abandoned,-the 
price of kelp, in consequence of taking off the duty rom Spanish 
barilla, having fallen so much, that it would not yield a fair remu- 
neration for cutting, drying, and burning the ware, to say nothing 
of rent for the shores. This manufacture, previous to the repeal 
of the foresaid duty, afforded employment, during the spring and 
summer months, to about twenty individuals, who are now reduced 
to the necessity of betaking themselves to other occupations, for

v.— Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town, Sc.-Theve is, properly speaking, no market- 
town in the parish ; the nearest is Fraserburgh, distant 8 miles 
New Aberdour, the feuing of which commenced about forty years 
ago, and the sea-town of Pennan, are the only villages in the pansh 
'kans ofCommunica.tion.-The only means of ication 
enioyed by the inhabitants is a post-runner, who goes for letters 
and newspapers three times a-week to Fraserburgh, to which there 
is a d S ll-eoach from Aberdeen. He receives a pei.ny for 
ea httlr carried to and from office, and also an all 
forparcels. The turnpike road from F-serburgh to Banff touche 
the parish of Aberdour at two points, namely, Bridgend, at the

eastern extremity, and Cowbog at the western, but would be of 
little advantage to the parishioners, were it not for the great junc- 
tion road made by Mr Dingwall, already mentioned, and which 
is equal to any turnpike. 

Ecclesiastical State.— T\iQ parish church stands at the northern 
extremity of the village of New Aberdour, fronting the High 
Street, and is very conveniently situated for the greater part of 
the population. There are several farms in the moors, at a con- 
siderable distance from the church, some of them not less than six 
or seven miles, but the families upon these farms attend other places 
0 worship that are less distant, and to which they will soon, in all 
probability, be annexed quoad sacra. The church was erected in 
1818, and is in good repair. It was built to contain 800, but will, 
if well packed, accommodate 1000. The sittings are all free. 

The manse was built in 1822, after a lengthened litigation 
with the principal heritor, who maintained, inter alia, that, by the 
Act 1663, a minister was entitled to no more than L.IOOO Scots, 
or L. 83, 6s. 8d. Sterling, for building a manse, offices, and garden 
walls. The House of Peers, however, were of a diflferent opinion, 
and affirmed the decision of the Court of Session, ordaining the 
heritors to build a competent manse and offices, the expense not 
exceeding L.IOOO Sterling, exclusive of the old materials. The 
benefit of this decision, however advantageous to the church at 
large, was in a great measure lost to the present incumbent, in con- 
sequence of the Procurator and Agent for the Church, over whom 
the minister had no control, as the cause had been taken up by the 
church, to be conducted at their expense, having sanctioned a 
plan, which was executed for about L.600, and allowed the clergy- 
man, after eight years' delay, and a triumphant victory, to put his 
hand into his own pocket, and furnish himself with about one-third 
of the accommodation which was absolutely necessary for his com- 
fort. 

The glebe, including grass ground, and the site of the houses, 
is between 7 and 8 acres, and may be considered worth about 
L. 2 per acre. The stipend is 15 chalders of victual, half meal, 
half barley, paid according to the fiars, with L. 8, Gs. 8d. for 
communion elements. There are no chapels of ease. Govern- 
ment churches, missionaries, catechists. Dissenting or Seceding 
chapels. Episcopalian chapels, or Catholic chapels within the pa- 
rish. There are a few individuals, scattered through the parish 
belonging to other persuasions, but, with the exception of one wea- 



272 ABERDEENSI-llUE. 

ver and his household, almost every family in the parish attends 
the Established Church. The only sectarians are about halt-a- 
dozen of Seceders, two Scotch Episcopalians, and one Roman 
Catholic. In short, the population may be said to be who ly Pres- 
byterian. Divine service at the Estabhshed Church is well attend- 
ed, and the average number of communicants is about 600. 1 he 
probable average amount of church collections for religious and 
charitable purposes is about L. 39 per annum. 

Education.-ln addition to the parochial school, there is a school 
on the lands of Auchmedden, chiefly for the accommodation of the 
children of the fishermen in the sea-town of Pennan. Tlie teacher 
receive, from the church-session the sum of L. 2, Is. 8d. Sterling, 
out of the interest of money mortified for that purpose, by a Lady 
Jane Hay, a daughter of the Earl of Kinnoul, of which mortifica- 
tion the church-session are constituted trustees. There are seve- 
ral other elementary schools in the parish, some of them taught 
bv unmarried females, and which are very useful for preparing 
children for the parish school ; but none of these schools are en- 
dowed, and the teachers depend solely upon the trifling fees paid 
by the scholars. Reading, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, na- 
vigation, English grammar, and Latin are taught at the parochial 
I lool, and also at the school of Auchmedden. The salary of the 
parochial schoolmaster is L. 32 Sterling, and the fees may amount 
-to L. 15 yearly. He has, besides, an excellent house and garden. 
The fees per month are. reading and writing, Is ; arithmetic s. 
4d • reading only, lOd. ; Latin, Is. 6d. : book-keeping, L I for 
a whole set. All betwixt six and fifteen years of age can read, and 
: lonsiderable proportion can also write. All abo fifteen yea 
of age can read, and the greater part can also write Thepeop e 
in general are very much alive to the benefits of educatioi. and 
end their children regularly to school. There are several ami- 
ies at the distance of five or six miles from the parochial school 
but their children attend schools in the adjoining parishes whic 
they can do without much inconvenience. It would be of much 
advantage if the school of Auchmedden were regularly endowed, 
and t Ideciuate salary provided for the teacher as the c d.u 
of the fishermen depend upon it alone for education.

Friendly Society.-The.e is one Friendly Society in the parish,

ABERDOUU. 273 

instituted on the 15th August 1815, for affording relief to aged 
and indigent members, and also for the benefit of the widows and 
children of the deceased. The number of members is 75. The 
money is invested in a chartered bank, in terms of the act of Par- 
liament, and amounted in 1835 to L. 279, 12s. 7d. 

There is no savings bank in the parish. The nearest is in the 
parish of Strichen, about seven miles from New Aberdour. It 
was established about six years ago, and is said to be in a flourish- 
ing condition. As yet, the transactions with this bank consist chief- 
ly of investments of money by farm-servants, of both sexes, and 
also by crofters and tradesmen. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons re- 
ceiving parochial aid is 36, and the average annual allowance to 
each is L. 1, 4s. ; the contributions for the relief of the poor 
arising from church collections, L. 39, 14s. 6d. ; donations, L. 5 ; 
interest of money, L. 6, 4s. 9d. ; penalties, L. 3, 10s. ; average an- 
nual amount of poor's money, L. 54, 9s. 3d. The poor scarcely 
ever apply for parochial aid until compelled by dire necessity, ma- 
mfesting a laudable spirit of independence, and a desire to sup- 
port themselves by the fruits of their own industry. 

Fairs.There are 4 annual fairs lately established at the village 
of New Aberdour, for cattle, merchandise, and engaging servants, 
but they are not well attended, as the place where,' they are held 
is within a mile of the margin of the sea. Two of' them are held 
at the two terms of Whitsunday and Martinmas, one in the middle 
of April, and another in the middle of August. There is also a 
fair, called Bytli market, held twice a-year, in the months of May 
and October, upon a moor in the southern division of the parish, 
where a few cattle are bought and sold. 

_ Inns and Alehouses.— Theve are 5 licensed ale and spirithouses 
m the parish, three in the village of Aberdour, and two in Pennan 
and there is also a gin-shop or two, of inferior note, in the more 
remote corners. 

Fuel—The fuel chiefly used is peat, of which there is an inex- 
haustible quantity in the parish. The expense varies according to 
the distance; but it costs at an average, before it can be laid down 
on the stack-hill, about 2s. per cart load. Considering the ex- 
pense of cuttmg, spreading, setting, and driving, it is very xloubt- 
ful whether the people would not be gainers by using coal in- 
stead of peat.

rest. The farthest extremity of this disjoined part, which com- 
prehends the estate of Montcoffer, lies within half a mile of the 
town of Banff, and is about four miles and a half from the parish 
church. The distance of the manse from Aberdeen, the county 
town, is forty miles. 

Topographical Appearances arid Climate. — This parish is of an 
oblong, irregular figure. It is diversified with high and low 
grounds, though there is no hill of any eminence within it. 
The temperature in the western part is rather milder than in the 
eastern. In the eastern quarter, however, the climate has of late 
been much improved by extensive draining. Snow seldom lies 
long on the banks of the Doveran, or in the valley in which the 
church is situated. The eastern part abounds in mosses, which 
considerably affect the temperature, — in consequence of which the 
different kinds of crops are rather later in coming to maturity than 
in the western. The north-west wind is . the coldest which blows 
here; the east wind is generally accompanied with rain, which is 
pretty frequently predicted by clouds thickening in the west. 

The climate, as has been stated, varies a little in the opposite 
ends of the parish, but, upon the whole, it may be said to be 
healthy, as instances of longevity are not rare. The late minis- 
ter, Dr Duff, held the living for sixty years. An old woman on 
the estate of Eden died in 1833, at the age of 108 ; and her eldest 
son, who at the time of his mother's death was aged 88, died last 
winter at the age of 93. An old woman also died here last win- 
ter, who was supposed to have reached 100. Consumption and 
rheumatism are the diseases to which the inhabitants are most 
liable. 

Hydrography. — The parish is intersected by a considerable 
number of rivulets. The river Doveran, which flows into the sea 
at Banff, runs along the western boundary of it for several miles. 
There is a fine large stream, named the Burn of King-Edward, 
which runs from east to west along the valley of King-Edward, 
and joins the Doveran about a mile to the west of the church. 
The source of one of the branches of it is near the church of 
Gamrie, within a mile and a half of the sea, and about eight miles 
and a half from its junction with the Doveran. The point of junc- 
tion is about five miles from the mouth of the river. The parish 
iSjupon the whole, well supplied with excellent springs. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — In so extensive a parish, as may be 
supposed, there is a great variety in the nature of the soil. In

nccted with the family of Craigston, if lie did not reside in this pa- 
rish, seems to have taken an interest in it, for the inscription on 
the massive silver communion cups shews that they were a joint 
present from Dr Guild, Sir Thomas Urquhart, and John Urqii- 
hart of Craigfintrie, the former name of Craigston. 

Sir Whitelaw Ainslie, M.D., the author of" Materia Indica" and 
other works, for a considerable number of years before his death, 
used to spend the summer months in this parish. His remains are 
interred within the church. 

Land-oioners.— Thehcntors of the parish are, the Earl of Fife, 
William Urquhart, Esq. of Craigston ; James Grant Duff, Esq. of 
Eden ; Beauchamp Colclough Urquhart, Esq. of Meldrum, who. 
is proprietor of Byth, in this parish ; Mrs Duff Mackay of Bal- 
maud ; and James Taylor, Esq. of Mill of Balmaud. 

Parochial Registers.— date of the earliest parochial regis- 
ter is 1704, when the first Presbyterian minister was settled. The 
register was kept with considerable attention for some years, but 
for a very long period there were no entries in it. The register of 
baptisms commences in 1728, and the register of marriages in 1784. 

Jntiquities. — The ruins of the castle of King-Edward stand 
on a rocky eminence, on the east side of the Turriff and Banfif 
turnpike, about a mile and a quarter south-east of the church. The 
castle belonged originally to the Cumines, Earls of Buchan. The 
castle of Eden has also been long in ruins. Craigston Castle, the 
residence of William Urquhart, Esq. of Craigston, was built 
about the beginning of the seventeenth century, by John Ur- 
quhart, commonly called Tutor of Cromarty. It is a,fine old build- 
ing, and the grounds about it are much embellished. Byth 
House is also an old building, but has been much enlarged and 
improved by the present proprietor. The grounds about it are 
tastefully laid out, and ornamented with thriving wood. 

The church seems to have been built during the incumbency of 
Dr Guild. His initials are engraved on a stone above the west 
door. From the date 1621, on an arched gateway leading into 
the church-yard, of the same style with the church, it would ap- 
pear that the church had been erected about the same time. 

Within, and on the north wall, near the east end of the church, 
is a monument with the following inscription : " Joannes Urqu- 
hart, hoc in honorem Dei, et matris suae Beatricis Innes, domino: a 
Cromertie memoriam erexit opus, anno 1599. The inscription is in 
relief on a tablet of freestone, within a semicircular arch, around

in their attendance at church, where they appear dressed in a very 
respectable and becoming manner.

of the land lets at about L.2, 10s. an acre. 

Plantations.— Scotch firs, which form the principal part of 
the plantations here, have all been planted. We have, besides, the 
ash, the beech, the larch, the spruce fir, the oak, the plane, and 
the chestnut. 

Rate of Wages. — Ploughmen from L. 5 to L. 7 in the half-year; 
maid-servants from L. 1, 10s. to L.2, 10s.— all including lodging 
and maintenance. A mason has 16s. a-week in summer without 
board ; a wright from 8s. to 9s. a-week with board ; a tailor, Is. a- 
day with board. 

The average rate of keeping a cow may be about L. 3 in sum- 
mer, and L. 2 in winter ; and a sheep may be kept all the year for 
about 7s.  

Live-StocL — The Aberdeenshire or Buchan breed of cattle ge- 
nerally prevails here, though of late years the Teeswater or short- 
horned cattle have been introduced into the parish. Many, how- 
ever, entertain a great prejudice against the latter. They require 
to be kept in a very superior manner, and the quality of the food 
is reckoned inferior to that of the Aberdeenshire breed. " Mr 
Grant Dulf of Eden, however, who began to introduce the im- 
proved short-horned cattle from Yorkshire about five years ago, 
and has since continued at intervals to import animals of the 
highest pedigree, incUnes to the same opinion as Captain Barclay 
of Ury, in Kincardineshire, who asserts, as the result of his longer 
experience, that these cattle are more easily maintained than the 
Aberdeenshire breed. Mr Grant Duff has no hesitation in saying 
that, as far as he has tried them, they are sooner brought to ma-

turity, have a greater aptitude to fatten, are much better milkers, 
and that such as are bred in tins country are remarkably healthy, 
and as hardy as the ordinary cattle of the district ; but that no ac- 
curate judgment can be formed of the short horns, ess greater 
attention be paid to the purity of the blood, and care be taken to 
cross only with superior males."  r ■ , u Ao 

The sheep are generally of the Highland and Leicester bieeds. 
« Some of a superior quality are kept on the estate of Eden. They 
are strong hardy sheep, and chiefly a cross between the Leicester- 
shire and Cotswold, from Gloucestershire." 

Husbandry.-The rotation of cropping observed, is generally the 
folbw g: i turnips; 2. oats or barley laid down with grass 
seeds ; I grass for hay ; 4. grass for pasture ; 5. grass for pasture ; 
6 oats • and 7. oats. One of the heritors, howe.er, requires his 
tenants'to follow a five course shift, allowing only one grain crop 
Xr the land has lain in grass for two years. This mode o crop- 
pinc. is thought to be less encouraging to the growth of weeds than 
the°former. There is very little wheat sown in the parish. 

The tenants here have introduced many of the late improve- 
ment« in agriculture. They are every year bringing into cultiva- 
tion wasteland, and in many cases their improvements have amply 
repaid them. On the estate of Eden, within the last twelve years, 
a 1 the ' productive land has been either reclaimed or planted ; 
belts and dumps of trees have also been planted both for ornament 
and shelter ; an extensive moss has been dramed and brought mto 
cultivation, by which the climate in the neighbourhood has been 
.twprovld, theproperty has been fTl 
and laid off in properly proportioned fields most of hch lJ 
already been enclosed with stone fences and hedge . The sum 
1 I out in improvements already greatly exceeds the value of the 
property at the time of their commencement, and it is to be hoped 
that the yearly value has also been more than doubled Draming 
has been carrLd on annually to a great extent, and the frequent 
dr in s stem had suggested itself to the proprietor, -d been pi.c- 
tised by him before he was aware of the experiments of Mr Smith 
nrrpanstoun Mr Grant Duff's furrow drains are from 30 o 
. 0";, varying in width from 10 to inches, 
built with an eve or conduit in the bottom, and filled w'lth small 
:lt\liJl5 or 16 inches of the top. His large 
carrying off springs in bogs and mosses, are from 5 to / feet deep, 
filled wlh stones' to within  or 2 feet from the surface. He

uses no tiles, and gives the preference to stone drains, none of 
which have even been choked, or gone materially wrong." 

" Trench ploughing was also introduced into this neighbourhood 
upwards of twelve years ago, by a proprietor in a neighbouring pa- 
rish, Mr Leslie of Dunlugas, and was immediately adopted by Mr 
Grant Duff, who has trench-ploughed about 700 acres of his estate, 
and, in every instance, when the land has been sufficiently drained, 
the deep ploughing has been very successful. Even on a gravelly 
soil, apparently of depth not admitting of an ordinary furrow, and 
apparently most unfit for such an experiment, this system has been 
pursued, and attended with results highly satisfactory." 

" The subsoil plough, although not uncommon in the neigh- 
bourhood, has not yet been adopted in this parish, although there 
is much soil which might be greatly ameliorated by its introduc- 
tion. Oxen, yoked three abreast, with two powerful horses in 
front, make an efficient strength for a trench plough in the stiffest 
soil, and will generally plough half an acre to the depth of 14 
inches in five or six hours." 

Enclosures are also going on in the property of the Earl of Fife. 
We have stone fences and hedges from Danshillock, skirting the 
turnpike all the way to Banff, a distance of five miles, which, with 
the exception of those on the estate of Eden, were executed by his 
Lordship about three years ago. The farms are generally held 
under leases of nineteen years. 

Quarries. — There are quarries of greywacke occasionally wrought 
in the western quarter of the parish, and in the eastern quarter 
there are quarries of red sandstone. 

Fisheries. — The principal salmon-fishing on the Doveran be- 
longs to the Earl of Fife. His Lordship is proprietor of both 
sides of the river, and the rent derived from it is L.1600. It might 
be difficult to say what proportion of it might fall to this parish. 
There is also a salmon-fishing on the estate of Eden, and another 
on the property of Craigston. The former, which is now in the 
hands of the proprietor, used to let for L. 20 a-year, and the latter 
may be worth about L. 5. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
The only village is Newbyth, which is situated in the eastern

There are in it several shopkeepers, and two nns There is also 
a distillery. A chapel in connection wuh the Estabhshment was 
erected here, about forty-seven years ago. Mr Urquhart of Mel- 
drum, who is proprietor also of Byth, is superior. The number 

of inhabitants is 302. i. i

weekly to Aberdeen. There is a penny post-office ,n the v,l age 
If Nelbyth, in connection with Turriff. The "ff™"

pasture. The garden, manse, and offices may occupy about one 
acre. One part of the glebe, of about 5 acres, called Bogburrie, 
was mortified in 1617, to Dr Guild and his successors in office, 
by Arthur Lord Forbes, who had at that time lands in this parish ; 
and in 1626, another part of it called the Kirkhill, was mortified 
by Patrick Meldrum of Eden, to the same worthy individual and 
his successors. The yearly value of the glebe may be about L.15. 

The stipend is 16 chalders, one-half meal and one-half barley, 
payable by the fiars prices of the county, and L.IO for communion 
elements. The Crown is patron. 

The minister of the chapel at Newbyth, the Rev. Gilbert 
Brown, receives L. 40 a year from the Society for Propagating 
Christian Knowledge, and a like sum from seat-rents and collec- 
tions. His hearers supply him with peats for fuel. He has also 
a good manse and a glebe of about 9 acres. The managers of the 
chapel, by the liberality of Mr Urquhart of Meldrum, who is pro- 
prietor of Byth in this parish, hold the glebe at a very low rent. 

About six miles east of the church is an Independent chapel, 
seated for 200, the minister of which is, I believe, paid from seat- 
rents, collections, &amp;c. In 1835, when the census of the parish 
was taken for the Royal Commissioners, the whole number of 
souls in the parish connected with this body was 127. There is 
also a house in the village of Newbyth in which the Catholic ser- 
vice is occasionally performed. The bishop resides at Priestholm, 
in the parish of Rathven. 

Persons belonging to the Estabhshed Church, 1863; Episcopa- 
lians, 81; Independents, 127; persons belonging to Associate Synod, 
19 ; persons not known to belong to any Christian community, 50 ;. 
Roman Catholics, 15; Baptists, 5. — Total 2160. ' 

Divine service at the parish church and also at the chapel at 
Newbyth is well attended. The number of communicants at both 
about 880, being 470 at the church, and 410 at the chapel. There 
are two extraordinary collections at the church yearly, one for the 
Infirmary of Aberdeen, which averages about L. 2, and the other 
for the General Assembly's India Mission, which may average from 
L. 3 to L. 4. The average amount of collections for the poor at 
the parish church is about L. 38 a-year. The collections at the 
chapel of Newbyth go principally to the general purposes of the 
chapel. 

Education. — Besides the parish school, there are other two schools 
in the parish, — one in the village of Newbyth, and the other a Fish-

ene. The branches taught at all the three are nearly the same, v.z. 
Enalish reading, English grammar, arithmetic, geography, Latm, 
practical mathematics, and book-keeping. The salary of the pa- 
rish schoolmaster is L.34, 4s. 4id., with a house and garden He , 
has also the benefit of the Dick bequest. The salary of the . 
teacher at Newbyth is about L.6, paid by the heritors ; and that 1 
of the teacher at Fisherie, about L.5, arising from subscriptions. 
Each of them has a house and garden. The fees at the parish | 
school may average about L. 10. Besides the above there is a 1 
school lately, erected at the northern extremity of the parish o 
Turriff, supported by subscription, and a small sum from one of 
the heritors, which accommodates a considerable number of young 
people belonging to this parish. AH these seminaries are regu- 
larly visited. The means of instruction are now within the reach 
of all the young people in the parish. 

There are also two Sabbath schools here, one under the super- 
intendence of the minister of the parish, and the other under that 
of the minister of the chapel at Newbyth, both of which are pretty 

well attended. . . i„f„K,

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Since the publication of the former Statistical Account m 
1793, a crreat improvement has taken place in the system ot hus- 
bandry. Aoriculture is well understood, and the tenants are m 
general ready to adopt every improvement. Bonemanule is now 
extensively used in the raising of turnips ; and lime is also judi- 
ciously applied. The land here is likewise much benefited by 
manure and herring refuse, which are brought from Banff and 
Macduff. The houses of the tenants have also undergone a great 
improvement within the last forty years. Many of them are now 
slated, and in other respects are both convenient and comfortable. 

The Turriff and Banff, and the Banff and Buchan, turnpike- 
roads have been productive of much benefit to this parish. The 
roads in the interior have also been made much better of late 
years ; and the great improvements which have been carried on 
have been the means of giving steady employment to the labour- 
ing classes, whose comfort has thereby been much promoted.

PEESBYTEKY OF TUURIFF, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. GEORGE DINGWALL, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History, 
Name. — The name of the parish is derived from a Gaelic word, 

signifying a cultivated field on the side of a hill. The locality of the 

parish and the nature of the soil seem to favour this interpretation. 
Extent, c. — The parish extends about 8 miles in length, and 

nearly 4 in breadth, and is of an irregular oblong figure. It is 

bounded on the north by Inverkeithny ; on the east, by Turriff; 

on the south, by Fyvie and Rayne ; and on the west, by Culsa- 

mond and Forgue. 

The temperature is generally mild, particularly in the interior 

df the parish.

Hydrography.— The Ytlian is the only stream- of consequeiu c 
in the parish. It takes its rise from two springs in the upper di - 
trict of Forgue, about a mile from the boundary of Auchterlc.s. 
It flows through the vale in a north-easterly direction, and dis- 
charges its waters into the German Ocean below Ellon. 

Geology.— k formation of clay-stone slate runs through the whole 
of this parish, nearly from north-east to south-west, and through 
the neighbouring parish of Turriff, till it reaches the sea at Mel- 
rose, in'Oamrie. The rock lies too deep to be worked for slate 
quarries, but it is available for this purpose in the neighbouring 
parish of Culsamond. It was formerly worked both in Turriff andj 
Inverkeithny, but is now abandoned for the superior quality of slates 
in the hills of Foudland. 

■ The soil is of a gravelly description, based on a clay-slate. It 
is almost uniformly dry, and varies in depth from three to twenty- 
four inches, averaging about seven inches. • 

II. — Civil History. 
Land-owners.—Mv Duff of Hatton and Mr Leslie of Badenscoth ; 

are the chief land- owners. 

Parochial Registers.— The registers of marriages and baptisms 
commence in 1680, and have been regularly kept ever since, with 

some trifling exceptions. , . 

Antiquities.— The most remarkable remnant of antiquity con- 
nected with this parish is a camp on the farms of Buss and Logie- 
Newton, commonly supposed to have been of Roman origm. A 
great part of what was formerly included within the walls is now 
improved. The south and west dikes only are entire. Near the 
remains of this camp, and upon the causeway leading westerly 
through Forgue, an urn was ploughed up, containmg black ashes, 
and decayed animal matter. This relic of antiquity is now in the 
possession of Sir Thomas Dick Lauder, Bart. On a farm in the 
neighbourhood were found a great many heads of darts, commonly 
called elf-shots, that had been used in war before the introduction 
of metal in the forging of fire-arms. 

In the immediate vicinity of the church, there is a small artifi- 
cial eminence, of an oval shape, surrounded by a ditch, which is 
"ow in many places very much filled up. It still retains the naiiie 
of the Moat-head, and was formerly the seat of the baronial court 
The gallow-hill, where the criminals were executed and buried, s 
in its neighbourhood, and confirms the general opmion of the on- 
ginal purpose to which the moat-head was applied. 



AUCIlTEllLIiSS.

There is a well at the distance of fully a mile east from the 
church, supposed to have been dedicated to the Virgin Mary. 
Within the recollection of some of the oldest inhabitants, money, 
and other articles, were deposited on Pash Sunday by those whose 
superstitious feelings led them to frequent the well, in expectation 
of some benefit to be derived from drinking the water dedicated to 
the Holy Virgin. Close by this fountain are the remains of a place 
of worship, to which had been attached a burying-ground, where 
several families of distinction were interred. The old chapel had 
been used, as is thought, for a bead-house during the times of 
Popery. 

The remains of Druidical circles are pretty numerous in diffe- 
rent parts of the parish. By far the most remarkable of these is 
situated on a considerable eminence on the farm of Logie-New- 
ton, overhanging the Roman camp, and called the Kirk-hill, pro- 
bably from this cause. Three concentric circles may be distinctly 
traced; the stones are very large, and of a white colour. A trench 
of several hundred yards length, terminating about half a mile from 
the camp in a north-west direction, called Cumine's trench, is still 
distinctly to be marked, the ditch being in many places four feet 
deep. This was probably one of the stations of the Cumines be- 
fore their defeat at Strathbogie, where Adam o' Gordon, who led 
Robert the Bruce's troops, obtained a decisive victory, and laid 
the foundation of the future greatness of the Noble family of 
Gordon. 

On the front of the old castle of Towie Barclay, the property 
attached to which is chiefly in this parish, we find this inscription 
neatly cut in stone : " Sir Valter Barclay foundit the Tollie Mills 
1210." This corroborates the common opinion, that corn-mills 
turned by water were introduced into Scotland by the Saxon fol- 
lowers of Malcolm towards the end of the eleventh century. 
For, had corn-mills previously existed in the country, this would 
not have been thought an achievement worthy of recording. And 
as the ancestor of the family John Berkely, son of Lord Berkely 
of Gloucestershire, was one of the followers of Queen Margaret, 
and obtained a grant of this estate for his son Alexander about 
1100, this goes far to establish the fact, that they had been intro- 
duced by the Saxons. About the thirteenth part of the grain 
over Scotland and England was considered a fair multure or re- 
muneration for grinding the corn with machinery. This shows 
that the labour of doing it with the quern or hand- mill formerly 



288 ABERDEENSHIllE. 

used must have been very great. Immediately above the door 
of the old castle of Towie Barclay is the following inscription : 
« Sir Alexander Barclay, foundator, decessit, 1 136." The estate 
remained in his family till it was sold by the Honourable Charles 
Maitland, brother to the Earl of Lauderdale, who niarned the 
last heiress in 1752. From this family was descended William 
Barclay an eminent civilian at the court of Lorrain, and the still 
more celebrated John Barclay, from whom the late gallant Rus- 
sian General, Field Marshal PrinceBarclay de Tolly, was lineally 

descended. , ., i- e 

Modern Buildings.— Theve are few modern buildings ot any 
consequence in the parish. The church was built in 1780-is in 
ffood repair, and contains 650 sittings. A handsome school-room 
was erected by the heritors in 1829. One of the proprietors 
built an elegant mansion a few years ago. The two prmcipal 
heritors are non-resident, and have excellent modern houses on 
their other properties in Turiff and Fyvie. Many of the farmers 
have substantial houses of two storeys high, with neat and com- 
modious steadings. 

III. — Population. 
The population of the parish in 1755, the earliest period at 
which we have any correct information on this subject, was 1264. 
In 1801, it was onlv 1120. In 1811, 1257 ; and m 1821, 1538. 
According to the census of 1831, the population had mcreased to 
1701 One principal reason for the increase was the number of 
subtenants or crofters, attached to the large farms, into which a 
great proportion of the parish has been, for many years, divided. 
This system of subletting has prevailed very much of late. These 
subtenants are useful to the farmers as labourers, and when they 
• have their possession on moderate terms, are generally able to sup- 
port themselves and their families respectably. Unhappily, from 
the great increase of population, the competition for these smal 
possessions has raised the rents so high, in many instances, that 
several of the subtenants threaten to be a serious burden on the 

parish funds. . . . , 

There are no towns nor villages of any extent m the parish. 
What is commonly called the Kirktown consists of ten dwelling- 
houses, with a population of 38. At fully two miles distance 
soul of the chu 'chis the small straggling village of Gordonstown, 
consisting of about thirty-five houses, with a population of 100. 
Both of these villages are inhabited partly by families occupying 



AUCHTERLESS, 



289 



crofts varying from 5 to 30 acres, and partly "by tradesmen of va- 
rious descriptions. None of them have any permanent fens. 

The average of births for the last seven years was 45 ; and 
that of marriages, 11. No register of deaths is kept. This pa- 
rish has been famed for the longevity of several of its inhabitants. 
A few instances of longevity may be noticed. Peter Garden, a 
farmer in this parish, died about sixty years ago, at the very ad- 
vanced age of 132. He retained his fticulties to the last. He 
lived under ten sovereigns ; Charles I. ; Oliver Cromwell ; Richard 
Cromwell; Charles H. ; James H. ; William and Mary; Anne ; 
George I., H., and HI. He was a page to Ogilvie of Banff, before 
that gentleman was raised to the peerage, and was one of the garrison 
in theoldcastle of Towie Barclay, when Montrose defended it against 
Argyle. He recollected having been sent, when a boy, to the wood 
to cut boughs for spears in the time of the civil wars. In his latter 
days he used to describe Montrose, " as a little black man, who 
wore a ruff as the ladies do now-a-days." He was married to his 
second wife when 120 years old, she being eighty, and danced with 
great glee on that occasion. Margaret Leslie, who resided in the 
Kirktown, died about the beginning of the present century, aged 
112. George Paterson,also in the Kirktown, died in the year 1808, 
aged 107, and William Andrew, in Little Cushnie, died in 1817, 
at the same age. 

There is only 1 blind person in the parish, and 3 insane. 

Number of illegitimate births in the course of the last threeyears, 
11. 

Within the last forty years, the language usually spoken has 
been gradually improving. The habits of the people are in gene- 
ral cleanly. The higher classes five well, using animal food. The 
common fare of the peasantry is meal, milk, and vegetables. The 
people are generally respectable as to intelligence, morality, and 
their observance of religious duties. Smuggling never prevailed 
to any extent, and since the commencement of legal distilleries is 
altogether unknown. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The parish contains about 16,000 acres, nearly 
one-third of which remains uncultivated. There are about 500 
acres under wood, all planted, almost entirely with larches and 
Scotch firs. A great deal more might be profitably employed in 
planting. The greater part of the woods is young, partly well cared 
for, and partly neglected. It is difficult to ascertain the averao-o

vent of arable land per acre in this parish, as naany of the best fanns 

are on old leases; and much inferior land has been la ely brought 

into cultivation. Perhaps it might average about L. per acre ,f 

it were to be let at present. Few grass parks are let ; but the 

ivorap-e rate of grazing an ox is from L. 2 to Lv. I, lUs. 
aveiage la e or g " number of cattle in the parish has 

1 • 1 rnf Hp mav now be estmiated at upwards otzULU, 

greatly increased. Cattle may now ut; ' , 

and horses from 300 to 400. There are only about 600 or 700 sheep, 
genera l y of the Cheviot or black-faced kind. The cattle of this dis- 
fnct were crossed with the old Fife breed about sixty yeas ago and 
these produced the far-famed Aberdeenshire stock. There have 
been various unsuccessful attempts to improve this species, first by 
the Lancashire, and afterwards the Galloway. Efforts are now mak- 
t to ve it by means of the short-horned. Whether these wil 
It Le Lccessful time only can show. The quality of horses ha 
been much improved of late years. The general character of the 
Sandry in th'is parish is excellent. The old system o pl- 
ith a number of oxen has been long disused. Four of them are 
AX sometimes employed for the purpose of tearmg m rough 
ground covered with heath and whins. 

In 1791, the first thrashing-mill was erected in the parish. At 
mesent, almost every farm of 50 or 60 acres in extent has one. As 
Te gr und gently risL from both sides of the hollow, and as many 
tributary rills fall into the Ythan, an opportunity has been afforded 
„ almo Jt every case of turning these by water, so that although there 
„ aboul thirty machines in the P-' -7-" :; 
five of these are driven byhorses. Along with the system of flowmg 
and cleaning the land, was introduced that of liming. The whole 
;aHsh has feen substantially limed oftener than once, and as ge- 
nerally got as much calcareous earth as it requires, so that at pre 
sei t les lime can be used. Placed at a distance from arge towns 
r en considerable villages, the great desideratum 1 
get manure. For this purpose alluvial earth from the baik 
L Ythan and smaller streams has been taken m great quan tie. 
for forming compost dunghills. Lately, bone manure has been 
ZXZI Given at the rate of 25 to 30 bushels per acre, it ha. 
rouced1plendidcropsofturnips,andthus,byinc 
ofkeepingUtle, has in some degree increased  - 
promises to contribute materially to the progressive ""P 
of the country. A mill for bruising bones has been lately erected 
• b an inte I gent farmer in this parish forhis own accommodation,

and that of the neighbourhood. Upon the whole, few parishes in 
the country are at the present moment in a higher state of culti- 
vation. 

Rate of Wages. — The rate of labour has lately fallen much. 
Labourers generally get Is. a-day in summer, and 8d. in winter, 
with victuals. The wages of masons and carpenters from 2s. to 
2s. 6d. in summer, and about Is. 6d. in winter. Labour, on ac- 
count of the pressure of the times, is sometimes below the rates 
mentioned above, and few labourers can get at all times full em- 
ployment. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

There is no market-town in the parish. Turriff, which is six 
miles distant from the church, and is also the post-town, is the 
nearest. The turnpike-road leading from Aberdeen to Banff 
runs along the eastern extremity of the parish for nearly three 
miles. Two stage-coaches pass every lawful day. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is nearly three miles 
from the north-east -extremity, and about five from the south-west, 
and is conveniently situated for a large proportion of the inhabi- 
tants. It was built in 1780, and repaired in 1832. The church 
contains legal accommodation for 650. An aisle was added in 
1885, capable of containing 180. There are no free sittings. 
The manse was built in 1769, and was put in complete repair in 
1814. The glebe measures about sis acres, and at an average 
may be valued at L. 2 per acre. The present stipend is 14 chal- 
ders, half meal, half barley. There is an allowance of L.8, 6s. 8d. 
for communion elements, and of L. 1, i3s. 4d. for grass money. 
There is no chapel of ease, or other place of worship of any de- 
scription in the parish. Most of the families are regular in their 
attendance at the parish church. About twelve families frequent 
the Scotch Episcopalian chapels in the neighbouring parishes; 
and one family attends an Independent meeting in Culsalmond. 
The number of communicants is generally about 830. The ave- 
rage amount of collections for charitable purposes is nearly L.45. 

Education. — There is one parish school, with five unendow- 
ed schools. In the parish school the usual branches are taught, 
such as Greek, Latin, mathematics, arithmetic, English reading, 
grammar, geography, and writing, &amp;c. In the other schools En- 
glish reading, writing, and arithmetic are taught. In one of the 
unendowed schools Latin is taught, and in two others sewino-. 
The parish schoolmaster has the maximum salary, and the legal

accommodation. He has the benefit of the Dick bequest. The 
fees in the different schools vary from L. 10 to L.25 per annum. The 
average expense per quarter is from Is. 6d. to 5s. All upwards of 
fifteen years of age can read. A few cannot write. The people 
are, in general, alive to the benefits of education, and even the 
poorer classes show a laudable anxiety to have their families in- 
structed in the common branches. There is only one corner so re- 
mote from the parish school as to be inaccessible to their children. 
Their distance, however, from the school of Culsamond is only 

about two miles. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The number of persons presently 
receiving parochial aid is 38, and each at an average is allowed 

about lOd. per week. 

The sums arising from church collections amount to about 
L.40 per annum; and from other sources about L.8. There is 
still a general reluctance among the people to seek parochial aid ; 
but this disposition is neither so common nor so strong as formerly. 

MarkeL— One market, called Donan Fair, is held in the Kirk- 
town in the month of April, for the sale of sheep, cattle, &amp;c. 
The market derives its name from Donan, formerly the tutelary 

saint of the parish. v , , j 

Alehouses.— Theve are 7 alehouses, but these have little bad 
effect on the morals of the people, as the individuals licensed are 
decent and respectable characters. 

Fuel—ei and turf are the only kinds of fuel to be got m the 
parish. English coals are a good deal used by many of the inha- 
bitants. They are driven from Banff and Macduff, about eighteen 
miles distant. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The most striking variations betwixt the present state of the 
parish, and that which existed at the time of the last Siatistical 
Account, are to be found in the improved mode of laying out and 
enclosing the fields ; in the great increase of turnip husbandry, 
and the consequent fattening of a number of cattle for the home 
and London markets; in a stricter attention to the- rotation ot 
crops; and in the general superiority of the various cross-roads, 
thereby affording increased facilities for agricultural improvement.

PRESBYTEEY OF DEER, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. WILLIAM COCK, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

The parish of Rathen is said to be one of the most ancient in 
the county of Aberdeen, and at one time contained within its limits 
the greater part of the parish of Strichen, and a part of the parish 
of Fraserburgh. The church and teinds, it is said, were at an early 
period appropriated to the Cathedral of the diocese, the incumbent 
of the benefice becoming the stipendiary of that establishment, till 
its dissolution at the Reformation. 

Extent, 8fc. — The parish is 3 miles distant from Fraserburgh, and 
extends upwards of two miles along the sea -coast betwixt that town 
and Peterhead ; from thence it runs inland, in a south-west direc- 
tion, to the extent of seven miles. The average breadth is 2 miles. 

There is a vein of limestone on the estate of Auchirus, yielding 
lime of excellent quality for building or manure, which is occupied 
by an industrious tenant, who has generally a great demand for the 
lime, chiefly for building. 

The few plantations in this parish have made a rapid advance 
during the last fourteen or fifteen years, to which it is the opinion 
of the writer of this report the early seasons we have enjoyed since 
1817, have not a little contributed, by the young shoots coming to 
a degree of maturity before winter. The north-west wind seems 
to be the most noxious in this district,— the few trees we have, when 
in exposed situations, being bended towards the south-east. 

II. — Civil History. 

Antiquities. — The few antiquities in this parish are, I. a Druid 
temple on the estate of Cortes, from which that property is said to 
derive its name; Cortes meaning a circle in the Gaelic language. 
2. The three cairns of Memsy, described in the former Statistical 
Heport, one of which only now remains, is composed of small round 
stones; the cairn is about 60 feet in circumference at the base and 
.about 15 or 1 6 feet high. In the foundation of one of the fo'rmer 



294 ABERDEENSUIUE. 

cairns, there was discovered an urn of peculiar shape, containuig 
calcined bones. There were also found several human skulls, and 
a short sword with an iron handle. The latter, with the urn, were, 
a few years ago, presented to the Society of Antiquaries at Edin-  
burgh, by Mr Gordon of Cairnbulg. The foundation of one of 
these cairns exhibits a large mass of vitrihed matter, resembhng 
what is found in vitrified forts. On a rising ground east of the 
church, there have been found at various times urns of different 
sizes, containing calcined bones. In one of these, a large boar's 
tusk was discovered about twelve years ago, which is now m the 
Museum of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. 

On the boundary of this parish with that of Lonmay, there is a 
well called the Rood Well ; but regarding it, there is no particular 

tradition.  

" There are also two mounds, or hillocks of earth, near the 
church, and not a mile asunder, that seem to have been formed 
by the hands of men. They are nearly circular, and slope to- 
wards the top, forming there an horizontal plain, somewhat cir- 
cular also, of about 30 yards diameter. Both are pretty steep all 
around; except that access to the top is tolerably easy on one 
quarter of each, by means of the rising ground adjoining. Ihe 
one is called Trefor Hill, and the other St Oyne's. Some think 
they have been old encampments. 

« There are two old castles in the parish both in rmns— Cairn- 
builg and In-veraliochie, which seem to have been places of consi- 
derable strength, especially Cairnbuilg,-the walls of which are 
almost entire, and of prodigious thickness. It was the family seat 
of Lord Salton's predecessors, and called Philorth, till sold by 
Sir Alexander Eraser in 1613 to Eraser of Durris, when its name 
was changed to Cairnbuilg : And Sir Alexander then transferred 
its former name to another house that belonged to him, about a 
• mile to the westward, which it still retains, and has been the seat 
of the Saltoun family ever since.  • , -i 

« Inverallochie appears to be inferior in strength to Cairnbuilg. 
No date is seen about either of them. Till of late, a stone above 
the entry to Inverallochie bore, with the Cumines' arms, the fol- 
lowing inscription : " I, Jordan Cuming gat this house and land 
for bilging the abbey of Deer." Old Statistical Account. 

Bidldings.-m Gordon of Cairnbulg, about thirty years ago, 
built a mansion-house on the estate of Cortes, which then belonged 
to him, but is now the property of James Strahan, Esq. the only 



RATHEN. 



295 



resident heritor : it is surrounded with very thriving plantations of 
different kinds of wood, and ornamented witli ponds of water. 

The estate of Memsy was sold by the late Colonel Eraser to 
Lord Saltonn, which estate is said to have been the property of 
Colonel Fraser's ancestors for upwards of three centuries. The 
mansion house of Merasey is occupied at present by Mrs Leslie, 
widow of Charles Leslie, Esq. M. D. who died in 1839. Auchiries 
belongs to Mr Chalmers Hunter of Tillery. Colonel Fraser of 
Inverallochy built a cottage lately with suitable offices on his es- 
tate of Inverallochy, favourable for sea-bathing, no doubt, for the 
occasional residence of his family; his principal residence is at Castle 
Fraser, a property belonging to the Colonel, situated in the parish 
of Cluny, in this county. 

Heritors.— The parish is divided among the following proprie- 
tors : Right Honourable Lord Saltoun, the patron ; John Gordon, 
Esq. of Cairnbulg ; Colonel Fraser of Inverallochy ; William C. 
Hunter, Esq. of Auchiries; Thomas Gordon, Esq. of Cairness ; 
John Lumsden Sherifs, Esq. of Rathen ; William J. Anderson, 
Esq. of Mains and Mill of Forrest ; and William Shand, Esq. of 
Craigellie.

 The population in 18il, was I088 

1811, 1734

Number of acres, standard imperial measure, in the pa'rish, which are either cul- 
tivated or occasionally in tilla'ge, about . . • 4800 

Number of acres which never have been cultivated, and which remain constantly 
waste, or in pasture, about . . • 1400 

Number of acres in a state of undivided common, 0 

Number of acres under wood, whether natural or planted, . _ 112 

It is supposed that a few acres might be profitably added to the land in cultivation. 

Several substantial farm-houses have been lately built in the 
parish, some of them covered with slate and others with tiles. On 
the farms of considerable extent, thrashing-machines have been 
erected ; which are considered a much more effectual method of se- 
parating the grain from the straw than the old mode, and a great 
saving of labour to the farm-servants. Agriculture is conducted, as 
in the neighbouring parishes, by a regular rotation of crops of sown 
grass and grain, the fields being previously prepared by fallow,

crops pf turnip, potatoes, or beans. A considerable addition has 
been made to the quantity of arable land in the parish, since the 
Statistical Report of 1793. 

Fishings. — The estates of Cairnbulg and Inverallochy are the only , 
lands in this parish which extend to the sea-coast. On these es- 
tates there are fishing villages very contiguous, containing by the 
census of 1831, 820 inhabitants. In 1801, there were only 404 
inhabitants in those villages. During the herring-fishing at 
Fraserburgh, which commences in July, and generally continues 
to the end of September, the fishing villages in this parish are 
almost deserted, as the fishers who are able to be employed at that 
fishing remove to Fraserburgh with their families. 

On the shores of these estates, there is often abundance of sea- 
weed, affording additional supply of manure to the lands. Till of 
late, when the season and weather permitted, a great part of the 
sea-weed from the rocks, or drifted ware, was manufactured into 
kelp, in some seasons, it is said, to upwards of 80 tons. The re- 
duced value of kelp, within these .few years, has caused the mak- 
ing of kelp to be almost discontinued on this coast. The estates 
of Cairnbulg and Inverallochy are very valuable when compared 
with their extent, the abundance of sea-weed affording a great 
additional supply of manure, by which means the occupiers of the 
lands are enabled to keep their farms in a high state of cultivation. 

Bent— The real rent of the parish is supposed to exceed L. 5000 
Sterling ; the valued rent is L. 3520 Scots. 

This parish is separated from the parish of Fraserburgh by a 
small stream called the water of Philorth or Rathen, which has 
its source in the upper part of the parish of Tyrie. Trout of con- 
siderable size and various kinds are caught in it ; but it does not 
appear at present to be frequented by salmon. The writer of this 
report is informed by the proprietor of Cairnbulg, that he has a 
grant of salmon-fishing in that stream from the Crown, of a remote 
date,— which would lead to the conclusion, that at one period it 
had not been entirely destitute of that description of fish, 
v.— Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication.— The turnpike-roads from Aberdeen 
and Peterhead to Fraserburgh form a junction in this parish on the 
estate of Cortes. The cross roads have of late been much improved. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church is old, and inadequate to the 
population. The minister's stipend is L. 100, 3s. 9id. includ- 
ing communion elements allowance ; 39 bolls 2 firlots bear ; and 



DRUMBLADE.

44 bolls, 3 pecks, and  lippy meal. The glebe consists of 5 
acres. The manse was built in 1803. The number of families 
belonging to the Established Church is 400 ; of Dissenting or Se- 
ceding families, 40, 

JEducation— There is at present only one parochial school in 
the parish, and two private schools ; but the parish would require ad- 
ditional schools, which it is hoped will soon take place. The pa- 
rochial schoolmaster's salary is the minimum, but he receives a 
share of the donation bequeathed by the late Mr Dick to the 
schoolmasters in the counties of Aberdeen, Banff, and Moray. 
His fees may amount to betwixt L. 24 and L. 32 per annum. 

Poor. The average number of the poor of all classes in the 

three years preceding 1838, 77; average on the permanent roll, 
24| ; average of those not on the permanent roll, 43. Average 
amount distributed among poor on the permanent roll, L. 46, 19s.; 
average amount distributed among poor not on the perlanent roll, 
L.14, 16's.; average amount distributed for support of lunatics, 
.L.14. Average amount from church collections, L. 55 ; from other 
voluntary contributions, L.li, lis.; from mortifications, mortcloth 
dues, &amp;c. L.24, 10s.

PRESBYTERY OF TURRIFF, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. GEORGE R. DAVIDSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

lame. — The ancient name of this parish seems to have been 
Drumblait, which signifies in Gaehc, hills or braes covered or 
fledged. The modern name is written DriimUade, 

Boundaries, Sfc. — It is bounded, on the north and east, by the 
parish of Forgue ; on the south, by Insch and Gartly, in a glen 
called Foudlin, in which, though of small extent, no fewer than five 
parishes meet; on the west, it is bounded by the river Bogie, 
which in that point separates it both from Huntly and Gartly. 

Extent, Sfc. — The parish is considerably diversified by small hills, 
mostly cultivated, and gently sloping valleys, with one flat on the 



298 



ABERDEENSIilRi:. 



north and west of large extent, so level, that the draining of it 
hitherto has not been very complete, from the want of proper fall 
for the water. This flat is still called the Knightland Moss, 
though it has long ceased to possess that character, being now either 
under the plough or in pasture. The length of the parish from 
north-east to south-west may be 7 miles ; greatest breadth between 
5 and 6 miles; in some places, however, the breadth is less than 
2 miles. 

Meteorology.— T\\e temperature in general may be described 
as moderate, and the atmosphere wholesome, and the draining ' 
through the parish being now very extensive, and for the most 
part effectual, the climate must in consequence be greatly supe- 
rior to what it had been in former years. The north-west wmd 
is perhaps the most prevalent. 

Hydrography.— only stream of any consequence m the 
parish is the Bogie, which divides it on the west from the town 
and parish of Huntlv. There are other insignificant streamlets or 
burns in the parish, and dividing it in part from neighbouring pa- 
rishes. Of these, the burn which on the east divides the lower 
part of the parish from Forgue, is to be mentioned,— and the 
Knightland Burn, which again divides part of the north district of 
the parish from Kinore, once a separate parish, but which is now 
united to the other old parish of Dumbennan,— they forming to- 
gether the more modern parish of Strathbogie, or, as it is more 
generally designed, Huntly. 

There are some mineral wells in the parish— none, however, ot 
note. Their quality is chalybeate. There are others that are 
called saints' wells, and which are still distinguished by the saint's 
particular name, or a corruption of the same— as one at Burnside, 
in the neighbourhood of the church, called Teller's Well, an evi- 
dent corruption of St Hilary's. The time has been when peculiar 
virtues were attributed to these, not from any mineral properties 
which they were supposed to possess, but from the blessing of the 
saint whose name they bear ; but these and other similar supersti- 
tions have, from the greater enlightenment of these Protestant 
times, now very properly died away. 

There are no lakes or lochs in the parish. A few years ago 
there remained a small specimen of such at Silverhillock, the wa- 
ters of which, it has been affirmed, ebbed and flowed like the tide, 
but, as may be supposed, on no kind of evidence that can be sub- 
stantiated. Within these few years, by the application of proper 



DRUMBLADE. 



•299 



draining, it has disappeared, and hardly any trace of it can now 
be observed. 

Geology and Mineralogy.— TXeve is nothing very remarkable 
to state under this head. Besides blocks of common whinstone 
greenstone that are found in many parts of tha parish, there are 
likewise rocks both of limestone and granite— the former, however, 
of a description so inferior, as not to be used for its mineralogical 
property. The granite, again, of which there is a considerable 
quarry on the farm of Corvichen, within a short distance of 
Huntly, is of good quality, and not inferior, it is believed, to the 
well-known granite so extensively worked in the vicinity of Aber- 
deen, and equally beautiful. When newly dissevered from the 
parent rock, it is softer, and much more workable than after it 
lies for a time exposed to the action of the air— which renders it 
peculiarly adapted for building purposes, where durabihty is of 
first rale consequence. The granite rock in this place is covered 
almost exclusively with small gravel of a granular kind — consist- 
ing, in fact, in a great measure, of the same elements with the 
granite itself beneath, though of a yellower and somewhat dirtier 
colour, showing that it is the same in a state of decomposition. 
The subsoil throughout, in this part of the parish, is of a gravelly 
kind, consisting of yellow sand and round stones, of a colour that 
would indicate the presence and action of iron or other metallic 
influence. 

Fossil Oi-ganic Eemains. — It may be mentioned, that hazel-nuts, 
in a state of great preservation as to external appearance, have 
been found deeply imbedded in moss, with roots and branches of 
the parent trees from which they sprung. In the moss of Tlio- 
mastown, in particular, now under cultivation, when drains were 
cut to the extent of several feet, these were found in considerable 
quantity, and in such preservation without, as to indicate almost 
the possibility of some remaining freshness within them. 

On the tarm of Cocklarachy, in the year 1833 or 1834, an oak 
of large dimensions was discovered about five feet below the sur- 
face, imbedded also in moss — about 100 yards above the bridge 
that crosses the Bogie toward the Huntly and Rhynie turnpike, 
about the same distance from this river, and not much above its 
level. It was nearly black, and the bark for the most part rotted 
off. Being very heavy, the thick part of the trunk was raised in 
two pieces — one about 10 feet long and the other 12 — the ave- 
rage girth was about 7 feet, and the two pieces contained from 



300 



ABEllDEENSHIRE. 



60 to 70 cubic feet of timber. The top of the tree was not raised, 
so that its full size was not ascertained. These solid parts were 
sent to Gordon Castle, where, after having been left for a time 
to dry gradually, they were cut up for cabinet purposes. The ex- , 
tremities of several such oaks may still be seen sticking out from 
the bank of the burn, a little below the church and glebe of Drum- 
blade, on the farm of Baggry Mill, parish of Forgue. 

Soil, Si'c. — The soil in this parish, though presenting consider- 
able variety, may be said in general to be of a superior kind, con- 
sisting, for the most part, of a deep rich loam, capable in favourable 
seasons of yielding abundant crops, and if the climate still suscep- 
tible of great improvement, were more attention paid to hedging and 
planting, were equal to the soil, it would, it is believed, be found 
particularly adapted for wheat culture, which has begun of late years 
to be somewhat attended to. There is at the same time in many 
places a coldness of subsoil, which is not very encouraging, arising, 
perhaps for the most part, from a still imperfect drainage, which 
the ordinary system practised does not seem fully to overcome, not 
only from the soil being unusually stiff and retentive, but from a 
hard crust often found beneath, which, it is hoped, the trench, or 
subsoil plough, now begun to be introduced, may do much to re- 
move. While the greater part of the parish consists of this stiff 
heavy soil, there is yet a very considerable difference between the 
western district, to the south and west of the Aberdeen and Huntly 
turnpike, and the other districts. The former being of a lighter 
and sharper description, with a subsoil consisting generally of loose 
sand and gravel, and somewhat earlier than the other parts. 

II. — Civil History. 
Historical Events.— The most interesting event that falls to be 
noticed under this head, is the circumstance of King Robert Bruce 
having lain encamped here during a time of severe sickness, while 
he kept in check at the same time Commyn, Earl of Buchan, who 
had followed him hither, and who was then and long before one of 
the most powerful of the Scottish barons. This seems to have been 
just before the battle of Barra, which was fought between the same 
parties in the year 1307. 

History and tradition have pretty uniformly pointed to Shach m 
this parish as the place so distinguished,— a certain height upon 
which is called Robin or Robin's Height at this day. Indeed, this 
point seems never to have been disputed until within the last few 
years, when Mr Tytler, in general, the most accurate and philoso- 



DRUMBLADE. 



301 



phical historian of our country that has yet appeared, has been 
pleased to transfer this honour from Sliach in Drumbhide, to 
Slains, a bleak and rocky district on the Buchan coast, but with- 
out stating any authority for the change. 

It is certain that tradition, universally prevalent here, as well as 
what can be gathered from the metrical historian Barbour, are both 
against him. For although the name given by the latter Slanach 
is not the same as either, yet there are circumstances detailed in 
his narrative that render it not only extremely improbable, but 
quite inconsistent, that Slains should be the place referred to. 
King Robert, that historian relates, had come over the " Mounth" 
to inverury : — at Inverury he was taken sick. It was not judged 
expedient by his adherents to meet the enemy while he lay in 
this condition, and, instead of continuing, therefore, exposed in the 
plain, they resolve to betake themselves to some place of strength, 
and for this reason the Slenach is preferred. Experiencing there, 
however, some want of provision, and having daily to encounter the 
archers of Earl Buchan in their endeavours to supply it, they de- 
termine to carry the king in a litter to Strathbogiey now Huntly, 
which, in spite of all opposition, they accomplished accordingly. 

Now, taking Mr Tytler's account, there is not only the improba- 
bility to contend against of the king's being carried so far in a lit- 
ter as from Slains to Strathbogie in his present infirm condition, 
but Earl Buchan, as appears, seeing the intrepidity of the king's 
party at their very outset, lost courage, and " went back to Buchan," 
which leads to this farther inconsistency, that, had Slains been the 
place, he and his men were in Buchan already. 

Antiquities. — On the same height above-mentioned, there were 
some years ago entrenchments to be seen, said to have been 
the remains of a Roman camp. The probability is, however, that 
these remains were connected with Bruce's encampment above re- 
ferred to, or with the strength or fortress which probably then 
existed upon it. Immense masses of large stones lie at the foot of 
this hill, and some have been found, it is said, with inscriptions 
upon them, none of which, however, are now to be seen. 

' Vide Barbour's Bruce by Jamieson, Vol. i. pp. 169-70-71, wliere tlie above view 
seems to be confirmed. 

The traditions current here are completely accordant with this account by Bar- 
bour, who, It IS to be remembered, wrote his history of " The Bruce," at no distant pe- 
riod after the event took place, and whose work Fordun describes as perspicuous and 
elegant. The hill on Sliach, as stated above, is still called Robin or Robin's IIciL'ht 
Ibe king's sickness was flux, as local tradition has it, and a well in the vicinity is 
still pointed out, the water of which is represented as having been instrumental to 
wards his recovery. ~ o 



302 ABIiRDEENSHIRE. 

In the same vicinity, stand three tumuli, the largest at the base 
of Robin's Height, called MeethiUock, and the other two at no I 
great distance, and on the same level ground below. It is conjectured i 
that these tumuli were raised by Bruce's army as posts of communi- 
cation for his soldiers. None of them have been opened. So far 
as the plough can yield information, there is every appearance of 
their being°artificial. From the examination of one of them, the 
second in°size, called Tarry Duncan, on the farm of Cairnhill, ex- 
cepting about four inches of black mould in the surface, the sod 
beneath appears quite soft, and without any stones. From observ- 
ing that the ridge on which it stands has little on its surface but 
clay, it would seem that the mould from it had been cleared away 
to form this tumulus. 

The third mentioned is indeed beyond the boundary of the pa- 
rish, but still so near the others, that they have all evidently been 
connected in their origin. It is on the farm of Causeway End, 
Kinore,— this farm being so called, it is said, because here ter- 
minated a Roman causeway, which, running through the old moss 
called Knightland moss, connected this place with Sliach. 

Another tumulus, at one time, stood at the north-east end of 
the same range of high ground that forms at the west extremity, 
Robin Height, and nearly two miles distant from it. Many still 
remember it. When opened, a number of great stones, placed in 
a circular form, were found within ; but it is not reported that any 
of them bore inscriptions. The stones were used for fencmg the 
plantation which now covers this ridge, and all trace of the tumu- 
lus seems to be removed. A little way below this, and between 
the properties of Newton Garry and Lessendrum, the head of a 
spear or javelin, of large size, was found some time ago, as have 
hkewise been smaller ones, like arrow-heads, in other parts of the 

There is another hill in the parish, and not far from Huntly, 
denominated the « Battle Hill," that deserves notice as the scene 
of a conflict said to have taken place at a later period between the 
Cummins and Gordons. Hardly any thing connected with it has 
been handed down beyond the name. It stands not far from Cor- 
vichen, a farm on the Gordon property, once a separate domain, 
where a strong house or castle appears once to have stood. Some 
remains of its foundation are still to be traced On the opposite 
side of the hollow, and standing over against the Battle Hill, Cor- 
vichen, is the Ba Hill, taking its name very probably from a game

once common, that of foot-ball, at which large parties would often 
meet, and eagerly contend together for the palm of victory. 
Parochial Registers. — The oldest parochial register commences 

1702, and ends 1738. It is simply a register of births and bap- 
tisms, containing no details. The second, commencing 1743, is 
much fuller, and contains, along with such register, a record of 
the session's discipline and diligence down to 1790. From that 
time to 1821 the record had again passed into a simple register, 
with session's collections and disbursements for the poor, and the 
names merely of those subjecting themselves to discipline, set over 
against the money-penalties which had been exacted from them. 
With the exception of deaths and burials, of which there has been 
no register kept, the record has lately been much more full, and 
contains now a general entry of all that is ordinarily transacted in 
the session. 

There are four silver communion-cups, two of them gifted by 
George Chalraer, a minister of the parish in the times of Episco- 
pacy; the other two by Mr Abel, also minister, who died in 1794. 
There is also a hand-bell of considerable antiquity, with the name 
George Biset upon it, 1504. 

There have been in all eight ministers of this parish, from the 
period of the Revolution, or rather from the death of the last 
Episcopalian incumbent, to the present time. The first Presby- 
terian, Mr John Turing, ordained and admitted 16th March 

1703, died 1st February 1733; Mr John Stuart, translated from 
Longbride, and admitted at Drumblade 1st February 1734, died 
January 1743; Mr George Gordon, translated from Bourtie, and 
admitted at Drumblade, 19th October 1743, died 8th December

• Among the family papers at Lessendrutn, there is still extant an old and curious 
deed of surrender, by which Walter Byset makes over his whole lands to the Pope's 
Legale, to be held by the Holy See. It is drawn up by Willermus Lenix, clerk of the 

diocese of Brechin, and runs as follows:—" In ye name of ye Lord, Amen In ye 

year after ye incarnation 1379, on the 14th day of July, in ye 2d of ye indiction, 
and in ye 1st year of ye Pontificate of ye most holy Father in Christ, Clement, by 
Divine Providence, Pope 7th of that name. In the presence of my notary," &amp;c. &amp;c. 
The original is in Latin, and written on vellum.

the former was acknowledged by England, but the latter by Scotland. '

ber 1827; Mr George Ramsay Davidson, the present minister, 
was ordained and admitted 8th May 1828. 

At one time, there was evidently a chapel or religious house in 
the parish besides the church. There are now no remains of the 
building; but the form of a burying-ground is still seen, now fenced 
and planted, and a well called the Chapel Well.  

Land-owners.— There are altogether five heritors, viz. the Duke 
of Richmond, who now inherits the Gordon property, and posses- 
ses exactly half the valued rent of the parish ; William Bisset, Esq. 
of Lessendrum ; Archibald Duff, Esq. of Drummuir, lands of 
Dummuies ; John Humphrey, Esq. of Comalleggie ; and John 
Lawson, Esq. of Chapelton. 

Modern Buildings.— The only mansion-house in the parish is 
that of Lessendrum, William Bisset, Esq. who is the only residing 
heritor. It is partly an old and partly a modern building, it hav- 
ing recently undergone a very extensive addition and repair at the 
hands of the present proprietor. 

III. — Population. 

According to Dr Webster the population amounted in 1750 to . Ja 

5 in 1790 It was reduced to bob 

of whom 427 were males ; and 459 females. „ , t- • 

Therwere then belonging to the Established Church, 812 ; Seceders, 40; Epis- 
copalians, 30 ; Papists, 4.

Character of the People.-The people are, for the most part, 
open, frank, and intelligent. They are hospitable m their man,

ners ; and their charity, not always discriminating in regard to wan- 
dering poor, seems to be dictated pretty much by a simple feeling 
of humanity. Though not inferior, it is believed, to the other 
districts around, the standard of religion and morality cannot be 
rated very high. Impurity and intemperance, though both, it is 
hoped, are on the decline, are still not unfrequently to be met with. 
In the class of farm-servants, the former vice particularly has 
been very prevailing. The ordinances of religion, and the services 
of the sanctuary, are generally well attended, as also those of a 
more private or local kind, on week-days. 

The practice of advertising sales, &amp;c. by proclamation at the 
church-doors, after divine service, is now abolished, as also all 
fines or penalties formerly levied by the session in cases of disci- 
pline, — this being left to the civil magistrate. 

IV. — Industry. 

The inhabitants of this parish, with very few exceptions, are 
employed in agriculture, as farmers, crofters, labourers, or farm- 
servants. The only considerable works of a public kind carried 
on in the parish are a distillery, bleachfield, and two potato-flour 
manufactories. At the distillery there are 13 persons employed, 
and there are annually sent from it upwards of 40,000 gallons of 
superior spirit, made from malt only, and thus yielding to Govern- 
ment about L. 10,000 a-year in duty. There are also two meal- 
mills, a barley-mill, a lint-mill, and two wool-mills in the parish. 
Mills had at one period been more numerous, as the names of se- 
veral farms still denote where no mills now exist. 

Of handicraftsmen, &amp;c. there are only 2 masons, 1 square- 
wright, 1 cooper, 1 weaver, no tailor, 5 shoemakers, including 3 
workmen, 3 blacksmiths, including 1 workman, 1 baker, 4 mer- 
chants or shop-keepers, one of whom retails spirits; 4 publicans 
and 1 maltster. There are thus not more than from 60 to 80 
individuals, reckoning both parents and children, that are not 
either directly employed in agriculture, or have their depend- 
ence chiefly upon it — and of those even here set down as ar- 
tisans, many of these cultivate a small croft besides attending to 
their other business. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — The superficial extent of 
the parish may be estimated at 6400 acres Scots, 5000 of which 
are arable, 1000 unimproved, and about 400 under plantation, 
consisting for the most part of larch and Scotch fir, with occa- 
sionally an intermixture of spruce and beech. Of the unimproved

ground, there may not be above 100 acres now rem-aininp that, 
with any profitable application of capital, could be added to the 

cultivated land. „ . , , . . i  t i

nuaind with the district. Such instances, however, cannot be 
rl mil many-but the evil that operates most extens.vely

is not favourable, one would think, to the promoting of active ha- 
bits, and is a material drawback upon their education ; however 
were it not for the trifle so gained at this part of the season, they 
might, perhaps, from want of means, be deprived of it, to a still 
greater extent. 

The principal crops raised in the parish are oats, viz. potato, 
early Angus, and what are called sandy oats : — these last, which 
are neither so late nor so tender as the potato, and produce, be- 
sides, a greater bulk, it is said, of straw for fodder, and a good 
mealing oat, seem now to be much in favour. There is also the 
Hopetoun oat, which, however, does not appear to have taken here, 
though still sown partially ; and bear or bigg, of which there is ge- 
nerally a proportion after green crop, and a few parcels of wheat, 
which it wants climate only to bring into more extensive culture. 

Prices of Provisions. — These are not high. Fresh butter from 
5d. to 6d. the imperial pound ; eggs 3d. to 4d. a dozen ; fowls 
Is. 8d. to 2s. a pair; chickens 8d. to lOd. ; beef and mutton 5d. 
and 5jd. a pound ; veal seldom to be had either in the parish or 
neighbourhood. 

Husbandry. — The ordinary husbandry pursued is the five and 
seven-shift coui'se, particularly the latter, being three grasses and 
two white crops for the seven, and two grasses and one white 
crop for the five, — which in dry land is found to answer very well, 
while in wet or clay land, the third year's grass becomes inferior. 

Live-Stock. — This being very much a rearing district for cattle, 
these fall particularly to be mentioned. The breed is for the 
most part Aberdeenshire, mixed with highland. Some few of the 
short-horned have lately been introduced. As they have not yet 
been long or extensively tried, they cannot be so decisively pro- 
nounced upon. They seem, however, to promise well, giving 
greater strength of bone, which was much wanted, and shewing a 
tendency to feed sooner. The returns arising from cattle may not 
be stated at less than from L.3000 to L.3500 annually within the 
parish ; and the amount arising from dairy and poultry produce 
may be stated at something between L.1700 and L.2000. 

Improvements. — During the last thirty years, the improvements 
that have taken place in reclaiming waste lands have been very con- 
siderable, almost doubling, perhaps, in that time the whole cultiva- 
tion, and, at all events, the produce of former years. They have 
been accomplished for the most part by draining and liming, ear- 
ned on chiefly by the occupiers themselves, and at an expense on

their part of not less, it is considered, than L.12,000 These 
seem to have been begun by tenants taking advantage of the march 
ditches formed by the proprietors, by directing dms.on d, ches, 
&amp;c. into them, and which giving good promise o " ''"y - f 
ried to a larger extent, the people began generally to adop the f 
nractice and have certainly, withont much encouragement other- 
Ce need very consideible industry and judgrnent m carrymg 
forward, in almost all cases at their own expense, the work of ,m- 1 
Irovement and with undoubted benefit both to themselves and the 
rorrZ . B, one farmer alone there have been 150 acres .m- 
Z d, fo which the Highland Society awarded b,m the.r gold 
Ledal some years ago,-and by another there have been tmproved

Arts and Manufactures, to a proprietor in th,s pansh, for p antmg 
forest trees to the extent of 235 acres, on a property consisting al- 
ZL of 67 1 acres. This gentleman deserves credit also for 
other improvements, and for the enlightened encouragement he 
gave to his tenants at a time when such stimulus was much wan - 
S He began by casting drains with the view of improving his 
tperty ; for th/se on the boundaries he charged his tenants 
noZX but for the drains through the fields he charged them o 
™ cen ., by which the, were considerable gamers, and were en- 
abled to paj their rents more easily, while the property at the same 
:e was m .1, improved. The drains proving effectual, the ad- 
V Ige of hming soon became apparent, but the times being then 
er Xkward for tenants in general, he advanced money for .ha 
Purpose to those having leases, at 5 per cent, ; and to those just 
 te°,n' he agreed to furnish a certain quantity, taking the va ue 
rkelv to be received into consideration, and charging according- 
' all which proved most beneficial to proprietor and tena t 

and praiseworthy in every condition oi hte

quarters, with a due proportion of green crop, according to the 
husbandry, consisting of potatoes and turnips, for cattle and for do- 
mestic uses. Of the grain there may be 6000 quarters exported. 

The ordinary duration of leases is nineteen years, and the rents 
are paid generally in money, or with a small proportion, perhaps, 
in meal. The paying of rent by the fiar prices, with a maximum 
and minimum, which many think would be the fairest plan, has not 
yet been introduced here. 

Farms vary in extent from 250 to 20 acres ; but there is a num- 
ber of crofts, besides, considerably smaller, and this variety does not 
seem to work unfavourably. 

Farm- Buildings. — The farm-houses and offices and the former 
more especially are not in general in proper keeping with the value 
of the farms to which they are attached, nor with the amount of 
capital of which the occupants must necessarily be possessed in 
order to carry them on, owing to the very limited encouragement 
generally given for this purpose. 

It may be mentioned that the system usually practised is, that 
the whole burden of the houses falls upon the occupant, for which 
he is allowed a certain return at the end of his lease, provided they 
shall then be declared of that value, and whatever additional build- 
ings in the course of his lease his growing industry may require, he 
may erect the same if he please, but it is entirely at his own risk 
iand responsibility, the landlord holding himself bound to no more 
than the certain modified sum originally specified, whatever now 
may be their additional value. Here it is evident the terms are un- 
equal. Should dilapidation ensue the tenant may get less than the 
sum agreed upon at entry, but should the value be never so much 
increased by additional or improved accommodation, that allowance 
becomes no more. The tenant's interest in the buildings accord- 
ingly being thus limited to the duration of his lease, with the ex- 
ception of the small sum above referred to, which seldom, it is be- 
lieved, nearly covers his outlay, he has no encouragement either to 
make them substantial, or even to build them to an extent equal to 
his requirements ; and thus, in fact, there is a constant building 
and patchwork going on, of the most inferior and unsubstantial 
kind. There is a twofold evil manifestly arising out of this system. 
\st. The general inferiority of the farmer's accommodations ; and 
2f, The circumstance that a certain portion of his capital should, 
through the full currency of his lease, be made to lie thus wholly 
unproductive, which, were the necessary accommodations aiforded 



310 ABEUDEENSHIRE. 

by the landlord, whose interests in the property are permanent, 
and a moderate per centage merely charged upon them, he would 
have had freely in hand, to lay out in improving and enr.chmghis 
iarm. In other words, the practice, while straitenmg to the tenant 
from the very outset, appears to be favourable iu the end neither to 
him nor to the landlord; and here, without doubt, the entail sys- 
tem operates in a way that is by no means favourable to the march 

of improvement. _ .  u- i, 

£ncZo5wre5.-Notwithstanding the extensive improvements which 

have taken place in cultivation, there is still much wanted in the 
way both of plantation and enclosures. Belts of tlie former more 
generally interspersed, and hedges, with ditches, would be both or- 
namental, and would increase greatly both convenience and shel- 
ter • and were due encouragement given by proprietors to this end, 
much would undoubtedly be done, and many corners now lying 
waste would be profitably and ornamentally occupied. 

V. — Pahochial Economy. 
Market-Town.— There is no market-town nor village in this pa- 
rish The nearest town, and that on which the inhabitants are 
mostly dependent both for post and market, is Huntly, which is 
four miles distant from the church, but considerably nearer to the 
ereat bulk of the parishioners. There is no post or regular course 
of conveyance from the post-office in Huntly to this parish, if we 
may except an individual who passes on foot once a-week to Forgue, 
carrying letters and newspapers to those in his immediate line of 
road at a moderate charge. 

Means of Communication.- k regular post conveyance or run- 
ner from Huntly to Turriff, with receiving-houses at different 
stages, would be a vast convenience to the inhabitants of that large 
and in many respects important inland district, a great part ot 
which is at present very badly situate in this respect. Letters 
from this to Turriff and neighbourhood, a distance of twelve miles, 
put in at Huntly, usually go round all the way by Aberdeen above 
seventy miles, before they reach their .destination. The other 
towns with which this parish maintains considerable communica- 
tion, are Banff, Macduff, and Portsoy, eighteen and nineteen 
miles distant, and Inverury, which is about twenty These, 
particularly the two first, are the towns to which the g a m s 
chiefly carried for export. There is considerable e-" °f of 
pike road within this parish, say ten miles, six of which consist of 



DRUMJ3LADE.

the Aberdeen and Huntly or Inverness great post-road, and four 
the Huntly and Banff turnpike. 

Tliere are three coaches, the Mail, the North Defiance, and 
Duchess of Gordon, that pass through the parish north and south 
daily. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The division of this and the neighbouring 
parishes is as preposterous as can well be imagined. The church 
is placed within a few yards of the boundary on one side, though 
four and five miles from the opposite point, while the people resi- 
dent there, in order to attend their parish church, have to travel 
three or four miles farther, than they would have to attend one in a 
neighbouring parish — nay, have actually to pass the one at a very 
short distance, to get at the other, with which they are parochial- 
ly connected. The consequence is, that the strictly parochial sys- 
tem is broken in upon, and that beautiful reciprocity of interest and 
of feeling which ought ever to subsist between a minister and his 
own people to a certain extent impaired. Besides the west end of 
the parish, which has already been stated as five miles distant from 
the parish church, there are other points three and four miles 
distant, and nearly two-fifths of the population are at a distance of 
two miles and upwards. Were an arrangement entered into of 
giving and taking, with some of the parishes adjoining, a very im- 
portant improvement to all would be effected ; indeed, were a ge- 
neral revision of parishes to take place, and some great Legisla- 
tive measure founded upon it to be introduced, the benefit result- 
ing therefrom would be almost universal. 

The church was built in 1 773, and received some improvements in 
1829, and certain additional sittings have been made out since. There 
is accommodation for between 500 and 600 persons. The sittings 
for the most part are portioned out to the occupiers of the land, who 
pay something for them at entry on a lease, to the outgoing ten- 
ant. They may all be said, therefore, in a sense to be paid for, 
though the payment, it is believed, is not large. It would be of 
some consequence at any general re-letting of farms on a property, 
that the right and extent of church room attached to each should 
be revised, and a new arrangement made where necessary ,• both 
as considerable changes are from time to .time occurring in the 
disposal of families, and because the leaving of this important 
matter to private settlement between outgoing and incoming 
tenants, has frequently led to great irregularities in this respect. 
-In some instances seats have been improperly transferred altooe-

ABEKDEENSHIRK. 



ther from the farms with which they originally stood connected, and 
a general indistinctness and confusion prevail otherwise upon the 
subject. The session let upwards of 100 sittings at from 1 s. to Js. 3d. 
each, and there are some lately erected to which they admit gratis. 
These consist of forms wherever there was space to admit them, 
and may accommodate upwards of twenty persons. They are 
chiefly occupied by old people and children attending the Sabbath 
school. There are no seats unlet that are set apart for letting, 
and these and others are in general fully occupied. 

Mortifications.— Tvo benefactions of L.lOO each are upon re- 
cord, one inthe year 1793, by the Rev. George Abel, some time 
minister of the parish, and another by his widow, several years sub- 
sequent ; also a share in common with the other parishes m the 
synod, of what is called Burnet's Mortification. L.20 has been 
the portion hitherto received by this parish, and as it goes from 
presbytery to presbytery in turn, it comes to be paid in each pa- 
rish once in a number of years. 

The manse was built in 1824, is quite near to the church, and 
in good repair. The glebe, one-half of which is beside the 
manse, the other at some distance, consists of nearly 10 acres, and 

is all arable. 1 1 r 

The stipend of Drumblade amounts in all to 84 bolls, 1 2 hppy 
of oatmeal; 9 bolls, 3 firlots, 2 pecks, 3 lippies of bear, mostly 
paid in kind; and L. 41, 17s. 7d. in money, paid by the heritors 
from the teinds of the parish ; and L.51, 9s. Ud. paid by the Ex- 
chequer, to augment the same to the annual value of L.150. 

There is no other place of worship, either Chapel of Ease or 
Dissenting, within the parish, besides the parish church. There 
are, however, a few preaching stations occupied by the parish 
minister for week-day services, and which continue to be well at- 
tended. ■ ., 1 J r 1 • 

There are in all 1 7 1 families or householders, male and lemale, in 
the parish, 152 of which belong to the Established Church, and 19 in 
all to the various classes of Dissenters. Reckoning the whole popula- 
tion at970, which, though somewhat less than the return made at the 
last Government census, is all that have been found atthisdate, there 
are belonging to the Established Church, 856 ; Episcopalians, oO 
United Secession, 20; Independents, 40 ; Roman Catholics, 4. 
The average number of communicants parishioners in the parish 
church is from 340 to 350, and, including non-parishioners, may be 
about 60 more. The sacrament of the Lord's supper is now dis- 

4

pensed twice a-year, and all communicants who request such pri- 
vileo-e here for the first time, however frequently they may have 
communicated before in other parishes, are strictly examined anew 
when they bring their testimonials, previous to their admission — 
which practice has been found to be attended with most beneficial 
effect. 

There is an association instituted for religious purposes — deno- 
minated the Drumblade Bible and Missionary Association, the con- 
tributions to which have hitherto been gradually increasing, and the 
sum now raised annually is from L. 24 to L.25. This sum has been 
divided among the home and foreign objects now carried forward 
by the Church of Scotland; the Edinburgh Bible, and the Scot- 
tish Missionary, Societies. 

Library. — There is also a parish library, the contributions to 
which are likewise on the increase ; and, though yet of no great 
extent, it is still in a promising condition. The books appear to 
be pretty extensively read, and the institution appreciated. 

There are usually three Sabbath schools in the parish, — one 
taught by the parish minister, and three assistant teachers under 
his superintendence, and two in other parts of the parish, taught 
by respectable Dissenters. 

Education. — There may scarcely be said to be any school with- 
in the parish but the parochial — one female teaches a few child- 
ren sewing and knitting. The numbers attending the parish 
school vary from 46 to 72 — the former being about the num- 
ber in summer, the latter in winter. The branches taught 
are, reading, writing, English Grammar, arithmetic, geography, 
Latin, and mathematics, including mensuration. The school- 
master's salary amounts to L.30; probable amount of school 
fees, L.24, 10s.; emoluments arising from the Dick Bequest, in 
common with the other parochial teachers in Aberdeen, Banff, 
and Morayshires, session-clerkship, &amp;c. may be stated at L.35. 
The school fees are by no means expensive, and the advantages 
of education are generally secured more or less by all classes of the 
• community. There are none brought up in the parish who cannot 
read, and few of the rising generation under fifteen years who 
cannot both write and account. Persons have occasionally been 
met with from other parishes unable to read, and, with some ex- 
ception, these have not been found in general much disposed to 
undergo the labour of overcoming that deficiency. There are 
many parts of the parish inconveniently distant from the parish 



314 AHERDKENSHIllE. 

school, yet this is in general so far supplied by their proximity to 
others without the bounds. A respectable female or girls' school 
for branches not exclusively elementary, would be an important 
improvement. The improved methods of education have been ge- 
nerally introduced, and, whatever may be the result in point of 
morals or otherwise, nothing can be more apparent than that the 
youth of all classes now enjoy advantages and facilities for acquir- 
ing information, intellectual and spiritual, far beyond what was 
common in former times. 

Poor and Parochial Funds— T\\e average number of paupers 
actually on the roll does not exceed five or six, though as many 
others, perhaps, as poor householders, are in the way of receiving 
occasional supplies. The maintaining of a lunatic, however, m 
the asylum at Aberdeen, has of late been a considerable burden 
upon the funds. The ordinary mode of keeping up the fund is 
by church collections, the average amount of which for the last 
five years has been about L.'27; the rest is made up from cer- 
tain sums lying at interest, and from church seats let by the ses- 
sion, and, were it not for the heavy charge above -mentioned, would 
be amply sufficient for maintaining the small number, both of the 
ordinary and occasional poor. 

The reluctance to fall upon a parish fund is not, perhaps, what 
it once was; yet, on the whole, that laudable spirit of independence 
may not be said to be lost in this quarter ; and it is certain, that, 
looking back to former records, the number of poor receiving re- 
lief had been considerably greater than now. 

Pair. There is scarce any market or fair now held in the parish, 

if we except one which has not hitherto gained much notice, on 
the Saddlehill, in place of Sliach Market, formerly well known 
and much frequented. The new station not appearing to take 
well with the country, one has been got up in Huntly at the same 
time, to which the business formerly transacted at Sliach has been 
for the most part transferred, and from the additional accommo- 
dations and conveniences there afforded, the change, it is believed, 
is not felt to be anv grievance to the public. 

7„„s._The number of inns or other places for the sale of spi- 
rituous liquors in the parish is unquestionably too great, -there 
being no fewer than five. 

Pud —Fuel is not abundant in the parish. There is a very small 
extent of peat moss, and that mostly of an inferior description. 
Neither- is turf extensive. The tenants, however, in Lessendrum

have a servitude, or right of casting peats over some part of the 
extensive moss of Foudlin, in the parish of Forgne, where they 
have an abundant supply. English coal carted from the port of 
Banff or Macduff is also a good deal used. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Looking to this parish as a whole, and marking the many 
changes which have taken place in it since the date of the 
former Statistical Account, it may safely be said, that it has 
not been behind others in the march of general improvement. 
Agriculture, in particular, has made wonderful progress, and 
that, not more, perhaps, in the greater extent of ground culti- 
vated, than in the superior management and direction, exhibit- 
ed in every department of farming details. Many bars to hus- 
bandry have been removed — new roads have been cut — mill mul- 
tures, at one time very heavy, amounting to one-seventeenth part 
when work was done, and to one-twenty-first independent of any 
work, have now for the most part been extinguished. The standard 
of comfort among the people has become elevated, their' ideas less 
contracted, their knowledge and information more extensive, and 
their manners and habits more refined ; and it is hoped that, in 
matters still more important and sacred, improvements also have 
taken place.

PRESBYTERY OF TURRIFF, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. JOHN MANSON, MINISTER. 

I. — Topography AND. Natural History. 
Name, Boundaries, c. — Fyvyn is the name given to this parish 
in most of the old charters and public writings connected with it. 
It is of Gaelic etymology, and derived from Fia Chein, signifying 
. Deer-hill. There is a hill in the parish which still goes by the name 
of Deer Hill, and the names of several of the estates and farms have 
also been clearly traced to Gaelic original. Fyvie is one of the 
largest parishes in Aberdeenshire. Its extreme length from north- 
east to south-west is 13 miles; and its extreme breadth 8 miles; 



316 ABEIIDHENSIIIUE. 

the extent of surface may be stated at 42 square miles. It lies 
about half-way between Aberdeen and Banff, and the public road 
between these two places passes through the breadth of it for se- 
veral miles. It is bounded on the east, by the parishes of Methlick 
and Tarves; on the south, by Meldrum and Daviot ; on the west, 
by Rayne and Auchterless ; and on the north, by Turriff and 
Montquhitter. 

Topographical Appearances.— There are no mountain ranges m 
this parish ; smaller hills rise up in different parts of it, and in ge- 
neral there is a very pleasing variety of surface. The hill of Eas- 
tertown, towards the south boundary, is the principal elevation. It 
is connected with, and may be considered a continuation of the 
ridge of the hill of Bethelnie, in the adjoining parish of Meldrum, 
which is said to be the highest land over which the turnpike road 
passes between Edinburgh and Inverness. In the neighbourhood of 
the hamlet of Woodhead, there is a district which goes by the name 
of the " Windy Hills ;" a small ridge of hill, along the bottom of 
which on the north there is a tract of moss, and some patches of 
moss also on the south side. The ground in this quarter bears 
marks of having been for a long period under water. Beds of quartz 
similar to those found along the sea shore lie in every direction, 
The substratum of the hill consists of decomposed sandstone. 
No organic remains, however, so far as I have heard, have been 
found in the locality. 

Soil, Climate, Diseases, Sfc— There is great variety both of soil 
and climate in this parish. Along the banks of the Ythan, and 
more particularly in what is called the Howe of Fyvie, where 
the parish church and Fyvie Castle are situated, the soil is early 
and fertile. A substratum of gravel runs along the whole vale, co - 
vered in most places with a sharp rich loam. The climate here 
alo is very mild, and the harvest about a week earlier than in the 
countrv generally in this quarter. In the north district of the pa- 
rish there are large tracts of moss. Here the climate is colder, 
and the soil in general poorer than in the middle and southern 
parts, and the crops used frequently to suffer a good deal from 
frosts ; but, frotn judicious drainage and the selection of early seeds, 
much less damage has been sustained in this way than formerly 
was the case. The north-east is the quarter from which we have 
most frequent storms. In general, the air of the parish is pure 
and healthy ; and I am not aware of any disease to which it is pe- 
culiarly liable. By a table which I have subjoined under the head

population, it will be seen that a fair proportion of tlie people have 
attained to an advanced age. Cases of fever occasionally break 
out, which the imprudent, though well meant attentions of neigh- 
boiirs to each other, often tend not a little to propagate. 

Hydrography.— The small river Ythan, which rises eleven miles 
westward in the parish of Forgue, and, after a farther easterly 
course of about twenty miles, falls into the sea at Newburgh, a village 
in the parish of Foveran,— divides this parish nearly into two equal 
parts. It possesses some statistical interest from the circumstance 
of pearls being frequently found in it.. In the years 1762-63, 
some were found of considerable value. There are two salmon- 
fishings on this river, one at the mouth of it, the other at the 
village of Ellon, about three miles from the coast. The Ythan is 
very 'slow and smooth in its course ; from the extensive system of 
drainage that now prevails, it rises more rapidly, and overflows its 
banks to a greater extent than formerly. From the point of its 
entering this parish, it runs through a long extent of flat ground, 
and, previous to certain recent improvements, the haughs on each 
side were rendered in a great measure useless by it ; but, by form- 
ino- a new channel, much valuable land has been reclaimed, partly 
above, through, and below the private grounds of Fyvie Castle, 
and for the farther accomplishment of this object extensive works 
are now in progress. The parish abounds with copious and salu- 
brious springs. Several of the wells still retain the names of those 
saints to whom they were dedicated in Popish times. On the 
south side of the hill of Eastertown, there is St Paul's well, which 
was long much resorted to by the people of this and the surround- 
ing parishes, and the favour of the saint sought in the usual man- 
ner, by casting a small off"ering into the well, and a subsequent free 
use of the waters. In a field upon a farm on the estate of Min- 
nonie, which still retains the name of St John's Well, there are 
other two sainted springs, one dedicated to St John, the other to 
St Catharine ; and a Uttle northward of where the parish church 
stands, there is St Peter's Well. None of these springs possess 
strong mineral qualities, and are remarkable only for the purity 
and sweetness of their waters. 

Mineralogy. — There is abundance of whinstone in the parish 
well adapted for building. Upon the farm of Cammaloun, on the 
estate of Fyvie, there has also been found sandstone of the same 
quality and appearance as that obtained in the extensive quarry at 
Delgaty, in the adjoining parish of Turriff". A few years ago, a 



318 



AnKUDEENSlIIIlE. 



quarry was opened there, but from the great dip of the stone, and 
the consequent difficulty of working it, a few blocks only were ex- 
tracted for a special purpose. A vein of this stone is supposed to 
run from the coast through the intermediate parishes. It is found 
in abundance in Turriff and Montquhitter and partially in the 
coast parishes of Gamrie and Aberdour. None has been met 
with, as I have heard, farther west than the point above referred 
to at Cammaloun. There is also at Petts, on the estate of Gight, 
a quarry of whinstone, valuable for the large slabs obtained from 
it. Some of these have been extracted 10 feet long by 2 broad, 
and 6 feet by 4. They are used in the country for various pur- 
poses, and are remarkable for strength and tenacity. 

Zoology and Botany.— The following is a list of wild animals 
which are to be found in this parish :— Of quadrupeds there are, 
roe-deer, hare, rabbit, fox, badger, polecat, stoat, weasel, hedge- 
hog, otter, water-rat, and all the common varieties of the smaller 
vermin, as the mole, rat, field-mouse, &amp;c. Of land birds there are,

The districts of the parish most favourable for the researches 
of the botanist are, the Braes of Gight, the Den of Rothie, and 
the old wood near Fyvie Castle. The most extensive plantation 
in the parish is that of the Den of Rothie, belonging to Mr Gor- 
don of Fyvie. It runs west from the hollow of Fyvie, a distance 
of about two miles and a half. It consists chiefly of fir, and pro- 
duces considerable revenue. In the parish altogether it has been 
calculated that there are 1735 acres in wood. A great part of 
this was planted by the late General Gordon of Fyvie, and his 
example has been followed by the present proprietor. A good 
deal has also been done in this way by the present Mr Leslie of 
Rothie, and by the former proprietor of Littlefolla ; but still there 
are considerable tracts of hill land, which in their present state 
are bad objects in the landscape, and are lost in a great measure 
as a source of revenue to the proprietors. It is much to be desir- 
ed that these were clothed with wood. There is every encourage- 
ment to this from the thriving state of all the plantations within 
the parish, and the higher value to which wood must soon at- 
tain, in consequence of the rapid consumption of moss throughout 
the country, and the distance of this locality from the coast.

II.— Civil History. 
No separate account of the parish is known, previous to thac 
contributed by. the late incumbent, the Rev. WiUiam Moir, to the  
old Statistical Account; but various interestuig noticed, especia- 
Iv in relation to' the church, the priory, and the chapel of St liule 
at Folia, are contained in the " Chartularies of Arbroath and ■ 
Aberdeen " in the Advocates' Library of Edinburgh ; in the Char- 
tularv of Aberdeen, and Chaplain's Register, in the Library of _ 
King's College; and in a view of the Diocese of Aberdeen, ma- . 
nuscript, in the Advocates' Library, supposed to be written by Sir 
Samuel Forbes of Foveran.  

Historical Events.-ln the year 1296, the Castle of " Fyvin 
appears to have been visited by Edward 1. of England m his 
progress through Scotland, t In 1395, the " Castel of Fivy 
which must have then been a place of considerable strength, was 
defended by the " gud lady" of Sir James Lindesay, though as- 
segit straitly" by her undutiful nephew, Robert de Keith, son ot 
the Marischal, till her husband came to her relief, and « quyte 
discumfyted" the said Robert and his adherents near the kirk ot 

7nT6l4, Montrose took possession of Fyvie Castle; but not 
thinking it tenable against the superior force of Argyle, he retired 
to an eminence a little to the north-eastward, which he defended 
vith great bravery for several days, and then marched by night to 
Strathbogie. The entrenchments are still distinctly to be seen 
and the ground goes by the name of Montrose Camp. One ot 
Argyle's'encamp'ments also on the lands of Ardlogie is still cal- 

led the Camp-fold. 

Papers and Charters.- KWnsxon has already been made to some 
documents in the Chartularies of Arbroath and Aberdeen, con- 
nected with the parochial history of Fyvie. Of these one relates 
to a perambulation held in 1325, in virtue of a bfteve rom King 
Robert Bruce, to fix the marches between the King s park of 
" Fvvin," and the lands of Ardlogie, belonging to the Abbey of 
Arb oath. Several others refer to a dispute between the Bishop 
of Aberdeen and the husbandmen of Formartine, in 1382, about 

. rornuch that is contained in the dei-« "/

payment of the second tithes ; and a considerable number are oc- 
cupied with the affixirs of the church and priory. At Fyvie Castle 
the series of charters is numerous and extensive, beginning towards 
the close of the fourteenth century, and descending in an almost 
unbroken chain to the present time. The original charter of Sir 
Henry Preston, obtained from Robert III. in 1390, is lost, but 
an. official extract is preserved. There are also preserved an 
extract of the appointment of Alexander Seton, Lord Urquhart, 
to be President of the Court of Session, in 1593; the charter of 
erection of the barony of Fyvie into a lordship, with all the privi- 
leges of a Peer of Parliament in his favour, in 1597; the sig- 
nature under the hand of James VI., with the commission 
under the Great and Privy- Seal constituting him Chancellor of 
Scotland in 1604; and the commission and patent of his creation 
as Earl of Dunfermline in 1605; with his appointment cis Keep- 
er of Holyrood Palace in 1611. There is also an interesting set 
of about thirty documents relating to the public transactions be- 
tween 1640 and 1770, in which Charles, the second Earl of Dun- 
fermline, bore a part. Of these may be specified the Conference 
at Ripon, 1640; the General Assembly at St Andrews, 1642, to 
which Dunfermline was commissioner, and to which refers an order 
of the English Parliament to the Assembly; the instructions 
of King Charles I. to Dunfermline, the commissioner; two let- 
ters from the King to Dunfermline, and one from Dunfermline 
in reply, during the sitting of the Assembly ; the gift of the Privy 
Seal of Scotland to Dunfermline ; the King's leaving Holden- 
by, 1647; the negociations between Charles II. and the Com- 
missioners of the Estates of Scotland, at Breda, 1650; and the 
meeting of the Scottish Parliament, 1661. It may also be stated, 
that at Fyvie Castle, there is a considerable number of paintings, 
both by ancient and modern artists, and an excellent hbrary, in 
the departments particularly of Scottish antiquities, history, bio- 
graphy, topography, and poetry, well stored. 

Proprietorship. — At one period the barony of Fyvie had the 
alias designation of Formartine, and the proprietorship can be sa- 
tisfactorily ascertained from an early date; but the term Formar- 
tme is now applied to the second of the five divisions of the 
county of Aberdeen, while it also gives the title of Viscount to the 
Earl of Aberdeen. The ancient barony of Pormartyn or Fremax- 
tyn formed three-fourths of this district, the other one-fourth con- 
stituting the . barony of Belhelvie. The term Fyvie is now re-

stricted to the parish, and that part of it, amounting to a full , 
third, which forms the property of Mr Gordon. The old ortho- 
graphy was " Fyvin," in correspondence with the etymok,gy al- 
ready assigned. It seems to have been a royal P-k down to 
the Le of Robert II., and the castle was - tJ  ,

Eminent Characters.-Beginald le Chen or Cheyne.--T\ns dis- 
tintished person was proprietor of the lands of Ardlogy and 
Leuchendy, which he gU to the Priory of Fyvie, m connection 
.Uh the Abbey of Arbroath, in 1285. He is generally styled 
Pater to distinguish him from his son of the same name He was 
BarJn of Inverugie, StrabrocU, &amp;c. and Great C amb. 
Scotland from 1267 to 1269. He was one of  
Scotia who concurred in settling the succession to the crovNU 
on Margaret of Norway, grand-daughter - Alexander H in 
1284. He was one of the barons who addressed Edward . 
on the subject of a marriage between the young Queen Sf Scot- 
W and tL Prince of Wales, with the vie.v of uniting the king 
doms in 1289. He made his submission to Edwaid 1., at Aber 
deZ' n he 17th July 1296, and his name is found m the Rag- 
tn Roll. Of this ancient family of Cheyne of —0 came 
Henry le Chen or Cheyne, Bishop of Aberdeen from 1281 to

involved in dispute with the Bishop of Aberdeen, about the pay- 
ment of the second tithes. In 1383, he quarrelled with Sir John 
Lyon of Glammis, Chamberlain of Scotland, and son-in-law of 
the King, and slew him in single combat. In 1385, his share of 
the French subsidy was 2000 livres. In 1388, he fought with 
the Earl of Douglas at Otterburn. In 1395, as already mention- 
ed, he raised the siege of Fyvie Castle, which his lady had brave- 
ly defended. He died 1 397, without male issue, and was succeed- 
ed as Lord of Crawfurd by his cousin, Sir David Lindesay of 
Glenesk, while the Formartine property fell to his brother-in- 
law. 

Sir Henry Preston. — He was of the family of Preston of Craig- 
millar, shared in the subsidy of 1385, and fought at Otterburn, in 
which battle he appears to have been the captor of Raiph Percy, 
as he had for his redemption a grant from Robert III., in 1390, 
of the lands and barony of Formartine, on the resignatipn of his 
brother-in-law. Sir James Lindesay. Sir Henry was a commis- 
sioner to treat with the English in 1390 and 1391, and he died 
about 1433, leaving, according to the most probable accounts, twp 
daughters co-heiresses, one of whom married Forbes of Tolqu- 
hon, and the other Meldrum of Fyvie, thereby endowing their 
husbands with these respective properties."}- 

Sir George Meldrum. — The Meldrums possessed Fyvie for 
about a century, and a-half. Sir George, who lived about the 
middle of the sixteenth century, seems to have been the only one 
among them known in a public capacity. He is termed by Lesly 
" ane vailyeant and wyse gentleman," while he relates that, in 1544, 
Sir George was sent by the Governor of Scotland on an embassy 
to the King of England, then personally engaged in the siege of 
Boulogne in France. His instructions were," to commoune upon 
certane abstuonce, to the effect that Commissioners should meit, 
quhilk was aggreit qntill his returning in Ingland in the moneth 
of August thairaftir." X 

Alexander First Earl of Dunfermline. — He was third son of 
George Sixth Lord Seton, and brother of Robert first Earl of 
Winton, and became proprietor of Fyvie by purchase from the Mel- 
drums in 1596. In early life he studied at Rome for the Church, 
but the establishment of the Reformed Faith in Scotland led him to 
turn his attention to the law. He was in great favour with James VL

and successively attained the dignities of Prior of Pluscardine in 
1585; Lord of Session, by the title of Lord Urquhart, lo87 ; Pre- 
sident of the Court of Session in 1593 ; Treasury Commissioner, 
■ 1595; Peer of Parliament by the title of L' Jy" 
Commissioner to-treat of the Union .vith England in 1604 ; Lord 
High Chancellor of Scotland the same year ; Earl of Dunferm- 
line in 1606 ; aud Commissioner to the famous Parliament of 1612 
vhich confirmed the proceedings of the Glasgow Assembly of 
1610, and rescinded the act establishing Presbytery of 1592. 
He continued Chancellor till his death at Pinkie, near Mussel- 
burffh, in 1622, and was succeeded by his son,  . 

Charles Second Earl of Dunfermline. -This nobleman took 
an active part in the transactions of the momentous period of our 
history from 1622 till his death in 1672. In 1639, he was twice 
sent from the Scottish Parliament to the King on missions of im- 
portance. In 1640, he was named a Commissioner to the treaty 
at Ripon, and in 1642, he was Royal Commissioner at the Gene- 
ral Assembly of St Andrews. In 1649, he went abroad to Charles 
II. and accompanied him in his unsuccessful attempt to assert his 
rights in 1650. At the Restoration he was made a P"-"""- 
cillor- in 1669 an Extraordinary Lord of Session; and m 1671, 
Keeper of the Privy-Seal. He died in 1672, and was succeeded 
by his son Alexander, third Earl, who survived but a short time, 
and the property fell to his younger brother, f 

James Fourth Earl of Dunfermline.-Ue served m early hfe 
under the Prince of Orange in several memorable expeditions, but 
returned home on the accession of James IL in 1 684. He joined 
Dundee in 1689, and fought at KilUecrankie. He is celebrated 
by the Jacobite author of the « Prlium Gilliecrankianum, as 

" Nobilis apparuit Germilodunensis 
Cujus in rebelles stringelatur ensis 
Nobilis. et sanguine, nobilior viriute 
Begi devotissimus intus et in cute;" 

and his consequence and military reputation were such, that after 
the death of Dundee he would have received the cominand, but 
for the unwelcome commission produced by Jolonel Cameron.. 
He was outlawed in 1690, and died at St Germains m 1694 with-

FYVIE. 325 

Gight—The estate of Gight in this parish, now the property of 
the Earl of Aberdeen, formerly belonged to the maternal ancestors 
of the late Lord Byron. It was sold soon after the marriage of his 
mother, who was the heiress. The burial-place of the I'arndy of 
Gordon of Gight is in the parish churchyard. Formerly it was 
within the old church, and upon the new church being built, my 
predecessor acquainted the Honourable Mrs Byron of the altered 
situation in which it stood, as being now exposed, and put in her 
view the propriety of raising some protection around it, but with- 
out success. It is to be regretted that the application had not 
been renewed to the Noble poet himself, as, amid all his difficulties, 
it was one of such a kind as probably would have excited his in- 
terest, and both had the desired effect, and called forth from him 
some beautiful epitaph. 

About the middle of the churchyard there is a more humble 
grave, but one possessed of a certain romantic interest, that of 
the heroine of the pathetic Scotch ballad called " Tiftie's Bonnie 
Annie." The original tombstone having become decayed, Mr 
Gordon of Fyvie, a few years ago, caused a new one to be placed 
upon it, a fac-simile in every respect. The name of the unfortu- 
nate damsel, the story of whose love is so finely told in the ballad, 
was Agnes Smyth. The common pronunciation of the Christian 
name was Nannie, which in the ballad is farther metamorphosed 
into Annie. On one of the turrets of Fyvie Castle there is a 
stone figure of the renowned trumpeter sounding his horn towards 
Mill of Tiftie.  

Land-Owners. — The following are the present land-owners of 
the parish, with the names and valued rent of their several pro- 
perties in Scots money: Lordship of Fyvie, William Gordon, 
Esq. L.2618, 10s. 8d. ; lands of Gight, Crichie, and Minnonie, 
Earl of Aberdeen, L. 2005, 9s. 4d. ; lands of Rothie and Mid- 
aple, George Leslie, Esq. L.685, 14s. 8d. ; lands of Muirs of

ParocUal Registevs.-lhe early parochial registers are very 
imperfect, and do not extend far back. The 6rst entnes of bap. 
tisms and marriages are in 1685, and the register of d.sciphne 
commences in 1721. There are chasms m both till about 1760, 
from which period they are regular. The accounts of the collec- 
tions and disbursements for the poor are kept m Scotch rnon y 
till the year 1763. While some of the entries are curious, the only 
poi t of'pubhc interest which could be gathered "rom them, is the 
great difference which they show to have taken place in the value 
of money within the last half century. 

Antiluties-Priory.- was a ee l ey of A - 

broath said by Spotswood to have been founded along with a pa- 
vbh church, by Fergus, Earl of Buchan, in 1179, whose donation 
of it to tl.; Abbey was afterwards confinned by his daughter 
Margaret, Countess of Buchan, and wife of Sir William Cmrjming. 
In another accom.t, the foundation is ascribed to King William 
the Lion ; and in a deed of date 1285, Rgmaldle Cheje is sa d 
to have founded the religious house on the lands of Ardlogy, that 
s he priorv, while it appears from another deed, tha he bestow- 
ed on his house his lands of Ardlogy and Leuchendy the same 
year.t The truth may be, that the house was originally founded 
bythl Earl of Buchan; thatthis was confirmed by King Wdham; 
and that a re-endowment was made a century later bythe Baron of 
Inverugie. The site of the priory was on the north bank of the 
Ythan, about a mile below the castle, and the outline of a part o 
il aid to have been the chapel, is still distinguishable on t 
0 a gentle eminence, about 150 yards north-east of the present 
bridge of Lewes. In the memory of persons still living, a good 
Bart of the ruin was standing. 

In 1285, Reginald le Cheyne gave to the priory, as above-men- 
tioned, the lands of Ardlogy and Leuchendy ; and the same .ar. 
Henry Bishop of Aberdeen, at the instance of the abbot and con- 
vent of Aberbrothock, granted a deed, -d-mg that tl. e 
ments of the vicarage of Fyvin, then vacant should belong henc - 
forth to the priory, provided that 100 shillings were annually 
given to a perpetual chaplain, who should go about the parish and 
dispense the sacraments to the parishioners.

In 1323, Albertinus was appointed to the cure and keeping of 
the House of Fyvin, and in 13'25, a letter was addressed to him 
by Bernard, Abbot of Aberbrothock, for the maintenance of disci- 
pline, and enjoining him with that view, " to hold a chapter regu- 
larly three times a week, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, 
to correct the irregularities of his brethren ; to reform the divine 
worship on Sabbaths and festivals ; to keep the fasts according to 
the rule and canonical institution ; and if any of the brethren 
should be found drunken, noisy, abusive, rebellious, and disobe- 
dient, to reclaim him, if possible, by good counsel, otherwise to 
punish him by silence, and bread and water, in a place of confine- 
ment beyond the access of the seculars, and if still refractory, to 
transmit him, with a statement of his delinquencies, to the parent 
institution." 

In the chartulary of Arbroath, various notices are contained re- 
garding succeeding priors of Fyvie, and of leases granted of the 
lands which belonged to the priory. In 1470, one Alexander 
Mason is Prior, of whom it is stated that he exerted himself great- 
ly for the increase and repair of the buildings connected with the 
establishment ; that he rebuilt the chapel; added offices, and en- 
closed the garden with a wall. The prior of Fyvie is frequent- 
ly mentioned in the Rolls of the Scottish Parliament. A little 
before the Reformation, the possessions of the priory are said to 
have been much dilapidated, though the lands which belonged to 
it in the neighbourhood rented L. 200 Sterling in 1792.f 

Parish Church. — The parish church of Fyvie, near to which the 
priory was situated, was dedicated to St Peter, the memory of 
which is still preserved in the name of Peterswell, in the immediate 
vicinity. William the Lion gave to the Abbey of Arbroath, the 
church of Fyvin, with the chapels, lands, tithes, oblations, pastu- 
rage, and other pertinents, between 1187 and 1200.]: 

In 1382, the husbandmen of Formartine, including the whole 
parish of Fyvie, and part of Tarves, having incurred the penalty 
of excommunication by Adam, Bishop of Aberdeen, for non-pay- 
ment of the second tithes, were obliged to repair in a body to the 
Bishop's chapel at Rayne, headed by John de Camera, bailie of 
Formartine, where, in presence of William de Spyny, cantor of 
. Moray ; William de Ormys, kirk-treasurer of Aberdeen ; Wil- 
liam Garland, sub -dean of Moray ; William Lang, vicar of Fyvie,

and Thomas de Nory, sheriff of Aberdeen ; having professed 

penitence, they were absolved by the Bishop, and solemnly sworn 

to obedience in future. 

The patronage of the church of Fyvie, of course, belonged to 

the Abbey of Arbroath, in consequence of King William's gift, 
and in the cliartulary of that establishment, there are accounts of 
several presentations to it. In 1G16, Alexander, Earl of Dun- 
fermline, had a charter from James I. uniting the rectorage and 
vicarage of Fyvie into one benefice, and conferring on him the 
advocation, donation, and right of patronage of the parish church ; 
since which time, the patronage has gone with the Fyvie pro- 
perty.f 

Chapel of St Rule at Folia or Folla-rule. — This was founded 
at Folia or FoUach, a Celtic term, signifying a place surround- 
ed with mosses, in 1376, by Adam Pyngil, burgess of Aberdeen, 
with consent of Marjory Blackvatyr, his spouse, in connection with 
the cathedral church of Aberdeen. It was endowed with the lands 
of Folethrowle, which the founder acquired in 1364 from Hugh 
de Ross, Lord of Philorth, and brother of William Earl of Ross, 
and with the mill and multures of Folethrowle, and the founda- 
tion was confirmed by a charter of Robert II. in 1379. It is stated 
by Orem in his description of the chanonry, &amp;c. that in his time 
the vestiges of the chapel were to be seen in the " town-land" of 
Meiklefolla ; and that the chaplainry having been annexed to the 
King's College, the heritor paid L. 40 Scots of feu-duty to the 
College for the said land. J 

Besides the religious houses already mentioned, there were also 
in different directions, and towards the extremities of the parish, 
other chapels, connected, no doubt, either with the church or 
priory. The vestiges of one are still to be seen on the farm of 
Eastertown, beside St Paul's well, already noticed ; of another on 
the farm of Fetterletter, on the estate of Gight, and probably 
there was one on the farm of St John's Well, on the land of Min- 
nonie, although no traces of it now remain. 

Chaylainry of St Ninian, in St Nicholas' Church of Aberdeen. 

This was connected with Fyvie by endowment and patronage. 

In 1490, William Meldrum, who became patron, granted by 
charter to the altar of St Ninian, and to Robert Leys, the chap- 
lain, a perpetual annuity of L. 2 from his lands of Waterton

■Sf Ellon L. 1, Os. 8d. from the lands of Ordefork, and L. 2 from 
tenements in the Gallowgate and Green of Aberdeen.— Fy vie 
Chart. In this parish, indeed, the external machinery for the sup- 
port of the Roman Catholic faith, appears to have been very com- 
plete, as there had, at least, been six or seven places of worship, 
or other Popish endowments connected with it. While, of late 
years, we have experienced a share of the great benefits of the 
scheme of Church Extension, on which the Reformed Presbyte- 
rian Church of Scotland has now so happily entered, on the whole, 
as compared with former times, we have to remark a serious Church 
Contraction here. 

The earliest Protestant incumbent of Fyvie whom we have seen 
mentioned is Mr George Sharpe, 1651 to 1663. Since that pe- 
riod the following have been ministers : — Mr "William Jaffray, 
from 1654 to 1676; Mr George Seton, 1678 to 1684; Mi- 
George Dalgardno, 1685 to 1717; Mr Robert Hay, 1st May 
1718 to 1st July 1719; Mr Thomas Scott, 13th July 1720 to 
Sd July 1748 ; Mr William Moir, 27th April 1749 to 19th March 
1794; Mr John Falconer, 3d December 1794 to 19th December 
1828. John Manson, the present incumbent of the parish, was 
ordained July 7th 1829. 

Burgh of Fyvie. — In course of the recent search among the 
papers at Fyvie Castle, a rather interesting discovery has been 
made, bearing upon the early history of the parish, of certain do- 
cuments relative to a burgh of Fyvie. Tradition concerning it 
•had been lost, nor can the site of it now be distinctly fixed, but 
from an early period mention is made of it. In the Brieve of King 
Robert Bruce in 1325, for fixing marches, already referred to, the 
rights of the burgesses of " our burgh of Fyvie," in the peat-moss 
of Ardlogie, are directed to be ascertained ; and the finding of the 
assize refers to the privileges of these burgesses in the time of 
Reginald le Chen, between 1250 and the end of the century. 
From 1390 downwards, the " Villa seu burgum de Fyvie," with 
its customs, tolls, and burgh-mails, is regularly found in the char- 
ters of the Fyvie property. It has been supposed to have been a 
royal burgh, but no charter of erection is known, though, from the 
circumstance of the Fyvie property continuing a royal demesne till 
towards the close of the fourteenth century, and the king being 
thus the immediate superior of the burgh, perhaps it may have 
some claim to the above distinction. It, however, unquestionably 
became a " Burgh of Barony," of which the proprietors of Fyvie 



330 



ABHUDEENSHIRE. 



were superiors. There exists a charter granted to Alexander 
third Earl of Dunfermline in 1672 or 1673, reciting in the pre- 
amble, that his father, and grandfather, and their predecessors, had 
the privilege of keeping a weekly market on Thursday, and three 
annual fairs on the lands of the manor-place of Fyvie, one on 
Fastings -even, called Shrove-Tuesday ; another on St Peter's day, 
the first Tuesday of July ; and the third on St Magdalene's day, 
the last Tuesday of July ;— stating that Fyvie is at least twelve 
miles distant from any royal burgh, and a convenient place for 
trade and merchandize ;— ratifying all previous gifts, and erecting 
the Lordship of Fyvie into " ane free Burgh of Barony," to be 
called the " Burgh of Barony of Fyvie," and granting power to 
the said Earl and his heirs, to nominate and choose bailies and 
magistrates for the government of the burgh ;— to possess and use 
"ane mercat cross;" and to admitmasons, baxters, brewers, skinners, 
and all other craftsmen and artificers, to hold the above weekly 
market and three annual fairs ; and for punishing and imprisoning 
malefactors and transgressors of the laws ; to have and make a 
" tolbuith" in the said town ; and to call, accuse, and execute jus- 
tice on all committers of murder, and theft, and other crimes, 
within the said burgh limits; and annexing the said burgh of bavony 
of Fyvie to the lordship and barony of Fyvie in all time coming. 
The weekly market and annual fair on St Magdalene's day have 
been long in desuetude, but the other two annual fairs are still re- 
gularly held and well frequented, as will be afterwards noticed. 

Ancient and Modern Mansion-Houses. — Gight Castle. — This 
ancient seat of the family of Gight is now a ruin, but, with its sur- 
rounding scenery, a very beautiful and picturesque one. It stands 
on the north bank of the Ythan, about four miles and a-half east 
of the parish church. The valley of the river on both sides is 
clothed with fine wood; on the north bank with natural wood of 
every variety of foliage ; while the associations connected with the 
spot, as having belonged to the family of one who, during his short 
career, shed around him such a bright display of genius and fancy, 
for himself and for the sake of mankind, it is to be deplored, so 
unhappily directed, give to it an additional interest. 

Fyvie CasZe.— This extensive and venerable pile stands on the 
north-east bank of the Ythan," within a fine park, with the sur- 
rounding eminences on every side covered with beautiful and thriv- 
ing wood. It has been built at diflferent periods, but the original 

• Fyvie Chart. 



FYVIK. 



331 



style is very happily preserved, and it combines now the imposing 
magnificence of a feudal age with the internal comfort and elegance 
of modern times. It consists of two sides of a square of turreted 
architecture. The south-east wing, still called the Preston Tower, 
must have been erected about 1400. The south wing has in front 
a tower called the Seton tower, with the arms of that family cut 
in freestone over the gate. The old iron door still remains, con- 
sistino- of huge interlacing bars, fastened by immense iron bolts 
drawn out of °the wall on either side ; and in the centre of the arch 
above the door-way, a large aperture called the " murder hole," 
speaks plainly of the warm reception which unbidden guests had 
in former times to expect. The south-west part of the castle is 
called the Meldrum Tower, in the bottom of which is an inaccessi- 
ble chamber, with neither door nor window ; its only known or 
supposed use being that assigned in an old plan, of a conceal- 
ment for arms. The west wing is terminated on the north by a 
tower, erected by the late Honourable General Gordon, on the 
site of the ancient chapel, which had become ruinous. The whole 
buildings are in good repair — the present proprietor has greatly 
improved both the castle and grounds. In every direction the 
views are very beautiful. There is an extensive lake within the park, 
well stocked with fish, and altogether this is one of the finest seats 
in this county. 

About three miles west of the parish church, stands the mansion- 
house of Rothie, the residence of George Leslie, Esq. It is a 
modern building, pleasantly situated on a rising ground overlook- 
ing a little valley. The view is not extensive, but varied and beau- 
tiful. The house was built by the former proprietor, and the pre- 
sent one has laid out plantations around it with much taste, and 
added many improvements. 

About one mile farther west is the House of Kinbroom, occu- 
pied by a member of the family of Rothie, a desirable residence, 
encompassed with thriving young wood, and commanding a fine 
view. There is no mansion-house on Monkshill, the estate of the 
other resident proprietor. 

Cairnchedly. — There is-a cairn on the outskirts of the farm of 
St John's Well, known by the name of Cairnchedly. It is greatly 
reduced now from its former dimensions, in consequence of most 
of the- cottages in the neighbourhood having been built out of it. 
In digging about it, small earthen urns are frequently found. They 
have been cast up in all directions for a considerable- distance. 



332 



AIJERDEENSHIRK. 



There is no appearance of lime or building of any kind about the 
cairn, nor does tradition, nor any record to which I have had ac- 
cess, tend to throw light upon what may have been the cause of its 
original formation. The common belief, in which I am disposed 
to acquiesce, is that some hostile encounter had taken place in the 
neighbourhood, at a period of remote antiquity. There would 
appear to have been a line of cairns in that part of the country. 
In the adjoining parishes of Tarves and Methlick, the names of 
many of the farms have either the prefix or affix of cairn. Within 
a distance of about ten miles there are several thus designated, as 
Cairnbrogie, Cairn-nortie, Conchercairn, &amp;c. &amp;c. 

III. — Population. 
I have not been able to ascertain much concerning the ancient 
population of the parish ; but within the last half century, it has 
greatly increased. By the Government census of 1831 it was 3252 ; 
males, 1586; females, 1666 ; and there is a farther increase since . 
that period. It is pretty equally spread over the country, and not 
concentrated in any quarter in a town or village ; the chief cause of 
the increase is the reclaiming of waste land and the formation of 
new settlements. The yearly average of births for the last seven 
years is 93 ; of marriages, within the same period, 21. There is no 
register of deaths kept, but for the last six years a register has 
been kept of burials within the parish churchyard, the yearly ave- 
rage of which during that period is 51. Several of these came 
from the neighbouring parishes ; but it is probable that about an 
equal number of persons who died in this parish were buried out of 
it, so that the above may be held as a fair average of deaths. 
The following table of the ages of the present population is 
drawn up from notes taken in course of a pastoral visitation in 
1836. 

Under 15. Between 15 and 30. Between 550 and 50. Between 50 and 70.

' It often happens that only one of the parties proclaimed resides i'in the pa- 
rish. In the above estimate two such proclamations are accounted equivalent to one 
marriage.

Of illegitimate births, including cases of antenuptial fornication, 
for the last three years, the average is 9. 

All the heritors are proprietors of land of the yearly value of 
L.50 and upwards. As already noticed, three of them only are 
resident. 

Character of the People. — The people generally are hardy, fru- 
gal, and industrious. They do not use much flesh at ordinary meals, 
the common food of the whole labouring class consisting of milk, 
meal, and a few varieties of vegetables. In consequence of the high 
duty on malt, and the excise restrictions of late years on private 
malting, many of them have been deprived of an indulgence which 
they formerly enjoyed of beer. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture is that branch of industry in which the great body 
of the people of this parish are engaged. By the returns made to 
the Government census in 1831, it appeared that there were in the 
parish : 

Heritors, professional and other educated men, . . 12 

Males engaged in agi-iculture, including farmers, crofters, labourers, and farm- 
servants, ... ... 800 

Males engaged in retail trade and handicraft, as masters, apprentices, &amp;c. 135 
Labourers not agricultural, .... 24 

Number of male servants upwards of 20 years of age, . . 246 

under 20 years, . . . 184 

female servants of all classes, , . . 237 

Total number of serats, . . 667 

Rental. — The present real rent of the parish, according to returns 
kindly furnished to me for the purposes of this account, by the se- 
veral proprietors or their factors or other agents, may be stated at 
L. 10,000 per annum. The following statement, made up from 
the same sources of information referred to above, shews the pre- 
sent scale of farm holdings : Number of crofts at and under L. 5 
Sterling yearly rent, 130; between L. 5 and L. 10, 107; L. 10 and 
L. 20, 76. Number of farms between L.20 and L.50, 57 ; L.50 
and L. 100, 41; L. 100 and L.150, 13; L. 150 and L. 200, 4; at 
L. 200 and upwards, 4 ; total 432. 

To this statement I desire to append the remark, that I con- 
sider the variety which it exhibits in the scale of possessions as fa- 
vourable both to the temporal and moral interests of the commu- 
nity. The new improvements in agriculture, which are readily in- 
troduced by occupying proprietors or the higher class of farmers, 

 Most of those engaged in retail trade and handicraft also possess small holdings 
of land, and might thereby be properly added to the list of males engaged in agricuU

soon find their way also among the more humble crofters, while 
the families of the latter, scattered pretty equally through the pa- 
rish as they are, furnish a supply of native and hardy servants, 
whose early associations attach them to the district, and who are lo- 
cated often, during the first part of their service, at no great distance 
from the parental roof. The system pursued in some parts of the 
country of throwing large tracts of land into the hands of«a few in- 
dividuals, to the exclusion, in a great measure, of the smaller far- 
mers, is, 1 conceive, in every point of view, of very doubtful advan- 
tage, and in some respects a positive injury. From the same 
sources of information already referred to, together with the assist- 
ance of a few experienced farmers within the parish, the following 
table, shewing the present state as to cultivation, farm-stocking, 
&amp;c. with the value of the gross annual produce, has been made up 

with much care.

It is supposed that 3000 acres might be added to the present cul-

Of the principal species of stock there are : cattle, 4400; horses 
employed in farm-work, 500; carriage, saddle, and young horses, 

100; sheep, 1600. 

There are 7 corn-mills and 80 thrashing-mills, of which forty- 
five are driven by water, and thirty-five by horses. 

Hushandr/,— As appears from the preceding table, the crops 
usually cultivated are sown grasses, oats, bear and barley, turnips, po- 
tatoes, and to a small extent may be added tares, pease, and flax. The 
rotation most prevalent is a seven course shift, of which three-sevenths 
are in first, second, and third grass, one-seventh in green crop, one- 
seventh in bear or oats, with grass seeds, and two-sevenths in oats 
. after lea. A five-shift is also common, but chiefly on land of good

quality, and under that rotation only one white crop is lalien after 
lea, and the grass land is broken up at the end of the second year. 
Two consecut ive white crops, as in the case of the seven-shift ; — while 
it is a system but little followed in the southern and more improved 
districts of Scotland, yet, where the soil is not deep, and adventitious 
manure cannot be procured, the opinion of many experienced far- 
mers is in favour of the system. They hold that the three years 
rest given to the land in the state of pasture, and the less frequent 
tillage of the ground, than under a quicker rotation, more than 
compensates for the apparent exhaustion by two succeeding crops 
of oats ; and, indeed, it is often the case that the second, or what is 
provincially termed the " yavel crop," is better than the first. Na- 
ture, however, would seem to tire of any uniform system when pur- 
sued for a great length of time ; and farmers occasionally allow 
part of their land to lie four in place of three years in grass, or 
take an intervening crop of pease or vetches, and plough them 
down, thus to some extent converting the seven into an eight 
course shift. Some farmers also take but one crop of corn after 
three years grass ; a system well calculated to ameliorate and reno- 
vate the soil. How far the valuable discovery of bone-dust as a 
manure may make such experiments unnecessary, it is needless to 
conjecture. Uquestionably the application of this new stimulant is 
operating powerfully in the amelioration of the soil ; already it may- 
be said to have come into general use ; and it is a remarkable fact, 
and given upon good information, that the value of bone-dust con- 
sumed in this county during the present season has not been under 
L. 30,000. Animalized carbon, a recent Danish discovery, has 
also been tried, but it is believed with indifferent success. 

Leases and Rent. — The ordinary endurance of leases in the pa- 
rish is nineteen years. A large portion of the land is held by the 
proprietors under strict entail, but the usual effect of that tenure 
is not perceptible, either in the conduct of the tenantry or the con- 
dition of the farm-steadings. The rent of land is extremely va- 
rious. Favoured spots bring as much as L. 2, 10s. to L. 3 the 
Scotch acre; old infields are generally rated at about L. 2; but 
the average of the whole arable land is supposed to be from 12s. to 
14s. Upon some of the estates a part of their rent is paid nomi- 
nally in meal at the fiars of the year, in the proportion of from one- 
fourth to one-third of the whole rent, but more generally wholly 
at a fixed money rent, and always so in the case of crofters and 
small tenants.

horned and dodded or hummel breed. Of late years the Teeswater 
has been introduced as a cross; and it is the opinion of some of the 
principal farmers, that the best stock are produced in this manner. 
Perhaps the advantages of the change have not yet been thorough- 
ly tested by experience. The chief superiority of the nevr breed con- ' 
sists in their coming sooner to maturity ; but their introduction 
upon any farm must be regulated by the keep which it furnishes. 
Horses are reared chiefly for draught, and the breed of late years 
has been much improved. 

Roads,— Uke all other inland parishes, Fyvie has to contend 
with the disadvantage of long carriages of produce and manure. 
The nearest harbours are Macduff to the north, and Aberdeen and 
Newburgh to the south, the distance varying according to the lo- 
cality of the different parts of the parish, but on an average bemg 
aboJt twenty miles. The roads, however, are good, and in addi- 
tion to the harbours already mentioned, Inverury, situated at the 
termination of the canal to Aberdeen, has lately started into im- 
portance as a mart for all farm produce, and for lime, bone-dust, 
coals, &amp;c. The commutation road-money of the parish, about 
L. 123, is expended at the sight of the heritors and their factors, 
under the direction of the district trustees, and the account of the 
outlay submitted to and sanctioned yearly by the general county 
trustees ; but, in addition to the assessment, the tenants very readily 
contribute the aid of their horses and carts in driving materials; and 
many useful roads have been made by the heritors for the general 
accommodation of the parish, without any assistance from the com- 
mutation funds. 

Labour.— 'T\ve corn crop is almost universally cut by the scythe 
in place of the sickle, and the regularity and perfection of the 
work is the admiration of all who see it for the first time. The 
additional quantity of straw obtained by the scythe is of great im- 
portance, but perhaps the chief advantage, besides saving of ex- 
pense, is the economy of time in an uncertain climate, as it is now 
well established, that, " owing to its being less compressed in the 
sheaf," the crop is ready to be carried to the corn-yard in a much 
shorter period. The farm-servants are very rarely married men, 
the system of having hinds being scarcely known in Aberdeenshire; 
and their wages vary from L. 5 to L. 7 in the half-year, besides 
victuals. They are generally hard-working men, and qmte as good 
ploughmen as are to be found in other parts of Scotland, i he 
common wages of women servants are L. 3 in summer, and L. 2 in 



FYVIE. 



337 



winter. Men engaging only for the harvest obtain from L. 2 to 
L. 2, 10s. besides victuals ; women engaging in the same manner, 
L. 1, 1 5s. A good deal of field-work is also performed by women 
in the hay and turnip seasons, for which they receive about 9d. per 
day, with victuals. 

The thirlage system in respect of the manufacture of grain is 
now done away, and while the expense of milling is still paid by a 
certain proportion of meal for every boll- of grain manufactured, it 
may be thus stated in a money charge, for drying and grinding per 
boll, 6d. ; grinding alone per boll, 4d. 

The following are the prices of the ordinary implements of 
agriculture : A one-horse box cart and wheels, with iron axle, 
is bought for, from L. 7 to L. 10 ; a cart and plough harness per 
set, from L. 3 to L. 5 ; an iron plough, from L.3 to L.4, 4s.; a 
wood plough, from L.2, 15s. to L.3, 15s.; harrows mounted per 
pair, about L.l, 15s. of best material and construction; but the price 
of this last article varies much. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Town, c. — This parish is altogether rural. There is 
no village or market-town within it, nor manufacturing establish- 
ment of any kind.. The nearest market-towns are Old Meldrum 
and Turriff, the former distant from the parish church seven and 
a-half miles, the latter nine miles. 

Means of Communication. — There is a post-office about a quar- 
ter of a mile from the church, and we have" the advantage of a 
daily post. A stage-coach also runs daily between Aberdeen and 
Banff. The only turnpike road at present within the parish is 
that portion of the Aberdeen and Banff turnpike which intersects 
it. A new line, however, is in course of being formed, leading 
from the parish of Forgue to the burgh of Inverury, and which is 
to cut through the western district of this parish. Another new 
line is projected, to lead from Aberdeen to Banff by Methlich, 
the village of Cuminestown, &amp;c. which will run along the north- 
east boundary of this parish for a short distance, and tend much 
to facilitate communication in that quarter. 

In the neighbourhood of the parish church the cottages are 
very neat ; most of them have a small garden attached, and all the 
necessaries of moderate comfort ; and throughout the parish the 
buildings are equal to those of most rural districts of this county, 
and an improvement is going forward. 

Ecclesiastical State — The great majority of the people of this

parish belong to the Established Church. There are four places 
of worship within it, two of them in connection with the Esta- 
blishment, and two with the communion of Scotch Episcopalians. 
The parish church was built in 1 808. It is a large and commodious  
structure, well situated for the parish generally, and contains suf- 
ficient accommodation. The former unwieldy extent of this pa- 
rish is now greatly improved by the erection, in the year 1833, of 
a new church at Millbrex, in the north-east quarter of it, and the 
annexation of a considerable portion of territory to it : Besides 
this there are two small annexations, quoad sacra, of portions of 
this parish to adjoining parishes, one on the south to the parish 
of Daviot, with a population of about 70, one on the west to the 
parish of Rayne, with a population of about 40. The gross po- 
pulation of the district that still remains under the charge of the 
parish minister is about 2500. The people are regular in attend- 
ance upon public worship. The average number of the congrega- 
tion in the parish church may be stated at 1000. 

The manse was built in 1830, and offices in 1831. They are 
very complete and commodious, and bear evidence of a liberal 
spirit in the heritors, and a desire on their part that the clergy 
should partake of the higher measure of comfort that now obtains 
in society. The present stipend is 161 chalders of victual, one- 
half in meal, the other in bear, converted at the fiars' prices, with 
L.8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. The glebe is small but 

fertile. ' , 

The church of Millbrex, built in 1833, enlarged m 1836, and 
eontaining about 500 sittings, is placed so as to accommodate the 
northern quarter of this parish, with a portion of the adjoining pa- 
rish of Montquhitter. There is a population annexed to it of nearly 
1000 souls, viz. from Fyvie, 739 ; from Montquhitter, 250. The 
Earl of Aberdeen, the principal proprietor of the district where 
it is situated, gave the handsome donation of L. 100 towai-ds its 
erection, together with a site for the building, an allocation ot 
land as glebe for the minister, and a privilege of fuel; and the 
people of the two parishes of Fyvie and Montquhitter contributed 
liberally. In the year 1835, a manse and office-houses were built 
at Millbrex, also by subscription, within the two parishes interested, 
with the assistance of the presbytery of Turriff. They are particu- 
larly the former, substantial and commodious. The whole ex- 
pense of the buildings, &amp;c. connected with this establishment may 
be stated at L. 600. It is entirely cleared, with the exception 



FY VIE 



339 



of a small sum now in course of liquidation. The Church 
Extension Committee of the General Assembly transmitted a 
grant of L.70 towards this object. Millbrex is a mission sta- 
tion of the Committee for managing the Royal Bounty in Scot- 
land. The present emoluments of the minister consist of an 
allowance of L.20 per annum from that Committee, the seat rents 
of the church, amounting at an average to L. 40 per annum, with 
his manse and glebe. He is ordained, and performs the pastoral 
duties within the district assigned to him, and the establishment 
forms a valuable addition to the ecclesiastical provision for this 
parish. It is to be hoped that, through the favourable interfe- 
rence of Government in behalf of the new churches, the Presbytery 
of Turriff may soon be enabled to perfect the status of the mi- 
nister of Millbrex, by recognizing him in every way as a parish 
minister. Of the two Episcopalian chapels in this parish, one is 
situated at Woodhead, about one mile and a-half north-east of 
the parish church, the other at Meiklefolla, within a few yards of 
the southern boundary of the parish. The former has but a small 
congregation connected with it; the latter is one of the largest 
country congregations in connection with the Episcopal commu- 
nion in this county. It is supplied from the neighbouring parishes 
of the district of Garioch, together with the western division of 
this parish and the adjoining parish of Auchterless. From notes 
taken at the visitation already referred to in 1 836, the respective 
numbers of the different religious denominations were found to be: 
Established Church, 2838 ; Episcopalians, 430 ; Associate Sy- 
nod, 34 ; Roman Catholics, 3. The number of male heads of 
families upon the communion roll of the parish, as made up at 
the dispensation of the sacrament of the Lord's Supper in Au- 
gust last, was 276 ; this exclusive of the Millbrex portion of the 
parishioners. In noticing the state of religion in this quarter, 
while there are many grounds of discouragement, I am of opi- 
nion, on the whole, that the spiritual standard of the community 
is rising. There is an improved observance of the Sabbath ; the prac- 
tice of family worship, once so pleasing a feature in the social con- 
dition of Scotland, is gradually being introduced again. May the 
Lord hasten the time when the incense of a pure offering shall 
ascend unto him, as of old, from the family altars, throughout 
the length and breadth of the land. 

Education. — The total number of schools in the parish is 8 ; 
one of them only is endowed, the parish school, situated a little 



340 \BEIIDEENSIIIUE. 

to the north of the church. It was improved and enlarged a few 
years ago, and, with the schoolmaster's accommodations, is now 
in good repair. The branches taught are, readmg, writing, 
arithmetic, Latin, English grammar, geography, with the ele- 
ments of mathematics and Greek, and the principles of reh- 
o-ion. The schoolmaster's salary is the maximum. The schoo 
fees may amount to L.25 per annum. He is also session-clerk, and 
enjoys he benefit of the Dick Bequest. Four bursaries be- 
long to this school, bequeathed by the late Mr John Mather of 
Madras, by deed of testament, February 18th 180 The va- 
lue of the bursaries is L. 6, 5s. per annum during attendance at 
College; and L. 2, 10s. per annum at school The magistrates 
of Aberdeen are trustees of the fund, and the selection of the 
young men is committed to the ministers of the parish. Several 
individuals, now fiUing with credit respectable stations in society, 
have enioyed the benefit of this fund, and when its resources are 
fullv developed, which is dependent on the death of a certain party, 
it wUl prove a valuable boon to this parish, and should tend not a 
little to give the school a footing as a classical semmary, and 
to promote its efficiency in other branches of parochial educa- 
tion. The unendowed schools are generally taught by individuals 
in humble circumstances, but assiduous and pains-taking. 1 hese 
schools labour under many disadvantages ; but of late years, 
there has been an improvement in the manner in which they 
are conducted. In a large parish like this, they  
necessary, and a great advantage to the community. The branches 
usually taught in them are, reading, writing, arithmetic, mensura- 
tion, and the catechisms of the Church. One of them is a gin s 
school, where,alongwiththeotherelementarybranches,needle-work 

also is taught. A small endowment is very much wanted for these 
schools, so as to give the teachers some measure of that com- 
fort to which the important duties which they fulfil to society en-

able to read more or less perfectly, and almost all boys, and the 
vreater number of girls between the same age, have been taught, 
or are now learning to write. The fees at the parish school are 
per quarter,— reading, 2s. ; reading and writmg, 2s. 6d. ; elemen- 
tary arithmetic, 3s. ; higher branches of arithmetic, 6s. ; Latm, 5s. ; 
course of kook-keeping, 10s. 6d. In the unendowed schools they 
are much about the same rates. 

There are five Sabbath schools, attended at present by about 
250 children. One of these, the most numerous, meets m the 
parish church immediately after public worship ; another in the 
church of Millbrex in the same manner ; the rest are spread over 
different districts of the parish, and generally under the superin- 
tendence of the elder of the district where they are situated. As 
a stimulus to home instruction, and as initiating children in early 
life to a careful perusal of the word of God, and reflection upon 
its truths, and as leading them also to a more regular and atten- 
tive waiting upon the public services of the sanctuary, I have seen 
benefit from these schools. They are farther important in bring- 
ing the youth for a considerable period more directly under 
the eye of the Church, and thereby forming a bond of mutual 
interest between them and the pastor, which, in the intercourse of 
the latter with them, when they have attained to a naore full status 
in society, will, I conceive, through the blessing of God, tend not 
a httle to render his labours effectual. Measures are proposed to 
be taken as soon as possible to get a school on the parochial foot- 
ing in connection with the church of Millbrex. 

Charitable and other Instiiiitions. — A Savings Bank has lately 
been established with every prospect of success. It is upon the 
old principle of these banks, and under the patronage of the heri- 
tors. The Aberdeen Town and County Bank have also lately 
opened an agency here, which will prove a great accommodation to 
the parish and surrounding district. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — There is a heavy poor's roll in this 
parish, — the average number receiving supply being from 60 to 65. 
More than three-fourths of these are females, most of them aged 
or infirm, and a few widows of farm-servants, whose husbands died 
young, leaving them with families wholly unprovided for. These 
last receive a supply according to their necessities, till the young- 
est of their children has attained the age of twelve years. Few 
occasional sujlies are given from the poor's funds ; nor are they 
applied for except in peculiar cases of family distress, arising ge- 



342 ABEUDliENSHIIVE. 

nerally from long-continued sickness. When this or other domes- 
tic calamity occurs to a poor family, it is due to state the kindly 
spirit in which it is uniformly met in the neighbourhood. A lo- 
cal subscription is set on foot. In aid of this a small sum .s ge- 
nerally given by the kirk-session, and the individual members of 
it I have known three or four such subscriptions in course of a 
season, and sums realized at each of them of from L. 6 to L. 11 
It is thought no degradation to receive aid in this way Several 
have done so, who on no account would accept the regular bounty 
of the parish. There is still a good deal of the true feeling of in- 
dependence here in regard to coming upon the poofs funds ; but 
I have observed that the desire of parties once admitted is to get 
all they can. The annual amount of disbursement to the poor 
for the last five years has been about L.120. Except in two cases 
where there is mental incapacity, and one in which there is another 
peculiarity, the highest allowance to any upon the roll, and this 
only to such as are bed-ridden, is L.2, 16s. per annum. The 
greater proportion of those upon it is at the rate of from L.l to 
L.1, 10s. per annum, and some are under L.l. 

Collections, Sfc.-The subjoined table shews the annual amount 
of the ordinary collections made in the parish church for the sup- 
port of the poor during the several years to which it refers. t .s 
drawn up at intervals of twenty and ten years for the last halt 
century : 

LIflB, L.3T4 L.efl5 L..f&amp;i 
And within the last two years the annual amount of the ordinary 
collections has been upwards of L.80 Sterling. In aid of the fund 
thus raised, there are mortified monies to the amount of L. 400 
Sterling, left by benevolent individuals connected with the parisb,. 
under the management of the kirk-session, the interest of which 
only they may apply, and L.lOO more at their full disposal. Oc- 
casionally a legacy of a few pounds isleft. Mortcloth dues, &amp;

been given by the three principal heritors. The collections at the 
church of Millbrex are also liberal, averaging L. 25 per annum.

The whole of this may be considered reclaimed funds, since the 
collections at the parish church stand as high as when the parisli 
was entire. In consequence, the kirk-session, in the meantime, 
allow the whole sum with the exception of an annual collection 
for the poor to go to the benefit of the new church. After pay- 
ment of a few necessary expenses connected with it, the rest is ap- 
plied to the liquidation of the debt. An annual collection is made in 
the parish church for the benefit of the Aberdeen Infirmary, so as to 
give the parish a title to send patients to it. A few are generally 
sent every year. The chief cause of pauperism is the greatly redu- 
ced rate of female domestic labour. The occupation in which the 
class of females on the poor roll are principally engaged, and the 
only one almost of which they are capable, is knitting. I am in- 
formed that, by their utmost exertions in this branch of employ- 
ment, they would only be able to earn about 9d. per week; while 
it is in the recollection of many persons that the same class would 
formerly have had no difficulty in realizing at the same occupa- 
tion the sum of 3s. 6d. per week. Under these circumstances, 
unless some more profitable channel is provided for the labour of 
the above class, I apprehend that we have no reason to look for- 
ward to a diminution of the burdens of pauper support. 

Fairs. — Two fairs are annually held within the parish, both on 
the estate of Fyvie, by right of ancient charters. The proprie- 
tor within the last few years has greatly improved the stances 
where they are kept, and gives the farther indulgence of levying 
no custom. One of these fairs is held at Eastern's E'en, and is 
principally for the sale of horses. It has long been much fre- 
quented for this object. Fat cattle and cows also are now brought 
to it, and it is increasing. The other is held in the month of 
July, and is chiefly for the sale of small stock, such as calves, 
sheep, and young cattle, and for engaging servants for harvest 
work. Most of the farmers in this neighbourhood depend on en- 
gaging some extra hands for the harvest at this fair. 

 From inquiries which I have made, I find that there are no fewp.r than forty 
fairs held annually within ten miles of the parish church, for the sale of farm stoclc 
and produce, or engaging servants ; and by extending the radius a little, say to twelve 
or thirteen miles, a distance often travelled to a fair, there are upwards of 60. It is 
extremely questionable how far this great multiplicity of fairs is of ndvantage even to 
the temporal interests of the community ; and as to their higher interests there can 
be no doubt that the effect is injurious. I have heard with much pleasure that 
there is some intention on the part of those who have influenpe in these matters, to 
bring about a new arrangement of the whole market system of the country. It would 
be worthy the serious attention of such parties whether the number of fairs might not 
be advantageously reduced.

/nws, Alehouses, §-c. — A small inn lias long been kept at Lewes 
of Fyvie in this neighbourhood. Nine persons hold licenses for 
the sale of spirits within the parish. These do not all keep ale- 
houses, some of them only retailing spirits along with other ar- 
ticles of merchandise ; but their number might be reduced with 
advantage to the community. 

p'ul — The ordinary description of fuel used here is peat, the 
principal supply of which is obtained from the mosses in the north 
quarter of the parish. In consequence of our distance from the 
coast, coal is very expensive the price of carriage being nearly 
equal to the original cost.

PRESBYTERY OF DEER, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. WILLIAM DONALD, MINISTER. 



L — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The ancient name of the parish was Peterugie, aris- 
ing, perhaps, from the rocky headland or promontory near the mouth 
of the Ugie. A small island between the town and sea is called 
Keith Inch ; the town in the charter of erection, in 1593, by 
George Earl Marischall is named Keith Inch, alias Peterhead ; 
and since that time the name of the whole parish and town has 
been Peterhead. In old charters, the name is Petri promontorium 
and Petri polis ; for other etymologies the reader is referred to 
the former account of the parish. 

Extent, §-c.— This parish extends along the coast in a straight 
line about four miles, bending along the sea shore about five miles, 
and from east to west it extends from three to four miles. It is 
bounded on the south, by the parish of Cruden ; on the west, by 
Longside ; on the north, by Saint Fergus ; and on the east, by the 
German Ocean. 

The area of the parish is about 9085 imperial acres, or nearly 

• Drawn up by Roderick Gray, Esq. Peterhead. 



i 



PETERHEAD.

15 square miles. The bounding line on the south, and partly on 
the west, is elevated, and is denominated the StirhnghiU, the hill 
of Invernettie, BlackhiU of Peterhead, and hill of Cowsrieve. 

Topoffvaphical Appearances.— The Stirlinghill rises 282 feet 
above the level of the sea; the highest part of the Blackhdl is 
about the same elevation ; the . other parts of the range are some- 
what lower. The MeethiU, on the estate of Invernettie, which is 
of a conical shape, and rises from 150 to 200 feet above the level 
of the sea, is a deep mass of clay resting upon granite, and is not 
connected with the above-mentioned range. The other parts of 
the parish are not much elevated above the level of the sea ; the 
surface, however, is diversified by eminences alternately with hol- 
lows, and exhibits a connected state of regularly cultivated fields. 
The Stirlinghill, which terminates at the village of Boddam, forms 
the well known promontory of Buchanness. Between the parish 
of Cruden and the fishing village of Boddam, in this parish, the 
sea is bounded by high cliffs of granite and other primitive rock, 
forming mural precipices ; and this part of the coast is indented 
with many chasms, fissures and caves, and these in some cases di- 
vide the granite from the trap rock. Opposite to Stirlinghill is 
the small green island of Dundony, where, in former times, it is 
said, there was a salt pan. Opposite to the- village of Boddam is 
another small island, upon which the Buchanness Light-house is 
erected. From Boddam to the Bay of Sandford, the coast is low 
and rocky. The Bay of Sandford, extending some distance inland, 
is bounded by a flat sandy shore, intermixed with pebbles. The 
point of Salthouse-head bounds the bay of Sandford on the north, 
and the bay of Peterhead on the south. The bay of Peterhead 
extends nearly a mile inland, from the outer point of Keith Inch, 
by which, and the town of Peterhead, it is bounded on the north.. 
The shores of this well known bay are flat and rocky, terminating 
in sand and pebbles towards the west. The town of Peterhead 
is built on a peninsula or flat rocky headland, the coast on the 
north side receding inland until it reaches the mouth of the Ugie, 
a small river which forms the boundary between the parishes of 
Peterhead and St Fergus. The sources of the Ugie are in tho 
upper part of the district, where it has two branches, the North 
and South Ugie, which unite in the parish of Longside.

The climate is variable, but has been much improved in conse- 
quence of extensive drainage. Within the last thirty years, the 
crops, partly from the improved state of the land, and partly from 
earlier sorts of grain being sown, come to maturity from ten days 
to two weeks earlier than formerly. 

Hydrography.— 'Peterhead was much resorted to as a watering- 
place for a period of two centuries. The principal mineral well 
is a chalybeate, situate in the town, near the sea; there are, how- 
ever, other wells near the town, especially one a little to the north 
of it, which is much resorted to in summer; these are also strong 
chalybeates. Dr Laing found upon analysis that the mineral 
waters of Peterhead held in solution aerated and muriated iron, 

• In reference to the want of any observations of the atmosplierical pressure in the 
months of June, July, and August 1835, it may be ment.oned that he barome ter 
kept at the Light-house was then broken, and was not replaced by another during 
that time.

muriate of lime, Glauber salt, common salt, and were impregnated 
with fixed air. Under proper regimen the mineral waters oi Peter- 
head were found by Dr Moir to be deservedly in repute for gene- 
ral debility, disorders of the stomach and bowels, flatulencies and 
indicxestion, nervous complaints, &amp;c. In almost every part of the 
parish, but especially in StirlinghiU and Blackhill, there are qopious 
springs, strongly impregnated with iron, which are found to possess 
the same medicinal qualities as those in Peterhead and its vicinity. 
The cool and salubrious air on the sea coast, the excellent accom- 
modation for sea-bathing, and the variety of mineral springs, ren- 
dered Peterhead, in former times, the resort of invalids during the 
summer months. Until lately the town of Peterhead was not 
supplied with good spring water ; but the country part of the parish 
has always been well supplied with spring water of excellent qua- 
lity. The Ugie is the only river in the parish. There is an excel- 
lent stone bridge of two arches over the Ugie, at the distance of 
two miles from the town of Peterhead. This bridge was budt m 
1686, by virtue of an Act of Parliament, at the joint expense of 
the shires of Aberdeen and Banff, and is still in good repair. 

The tide off Peterhead flows from Rattrayhead, in the parish of 
Crimond, south and south-east, and ebbs north and north-west. 
During spring-tides it runs three and a-half miles an hour. There 
are, however, considerable variations, in consequence, it is sup- 
posed, of the adjoining headlands. The sea at Peterhead is very 
salt, and the temperature is never so low as in friths, or in the 
vicinity of large rivers. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The whole of the parish of Peter- 
head is upon primitive rock. In the StirlinghiU, Blackhill, and 
Hill of Cowsrieve, the granite or syenite rises to the surface. 
Along the coast, and in other parts of the parish, it is covered 
with clay, supposed to be diluvial, and other matters to a greater 
or less depth. Upon the StirlinghiU, the granite rises to the sur- 
face, or nearly so, over an extent of from 100 to 150 acres. In 
every place where the syenite or granite is laid bare, imbedded 
masses, veins or dikes of primitive trap, gneiss, quartz, and com- 
pact felspar are alternate with, and run through it. In some cases 
one-half of a block is granite and the other primitive trap in com- 
plete cohesion, and often passing into each other. At the old 
Castle of Boddam, the rock is separated by a fissure or chasm, 
one side of which is granite and the other primitive trap. This 
chasm runs east and west, the granite being on the south and the 



348

trap on the north, with a considerable angle to the horizon. Near 
the Buchanness Lighthouse, there is a pretty extensive bed of • 
hornstone-porphyry, also a rock resembling clinkstone-porphyry. 
The rock along the coast, from Buchanness to the mouth of the 
Ugie, may be seen at low-water mark, and consists of granite, 
primitive trap, syenite, gneiss, compact felspar, felspar-porphyry, 
and quartz, variously associated with each other. The bed or 
cleavage of these rocks, as they lie in the quarry, is;;generally 
from east to west ; and in granite, the laminae of which it is com- 
posed, and it appears generally to be so composed, are to be 
seen in the same direction. The beds of pebbles along the shore, 
and the boulders are very extensive, and embrace fragments of 
rocks and minerals which are seldom to be found upon the land in 
the neighbourhood. Agates and jasper are to be found ; flints 
are also abundant, and are not unfrequently found, on being broken, 
to contain impressions of sea-plants, shells, &amp;c. The Meethill is 
covered with a deep mass of diluvial clay ; at the brickwork, which 
is about fifty yards from the beach, and where the clay has been 
cut to the depth of from thirty to forty feet, it exhibits various 
strata, which appear to have been deposited at different times, from 
their differences in quality and colour ; some of the deposits are 
not above an inch in depth, while others are several feet. The 
skeleton of a bird was lately dug out of the clay here, at the depth 
of 25 feet from the surface, and about 15 or 20" feet above the 
level of the sea. From the Meethill, embracing the lands of 
Clerkhill, Grange, Windmill of Peterhead, Blackhouse, Balmoor, 
Mountpleasant, and Alehousehill, to Downiehills, the surface is 
covered to a considerable depth with clay, mixed in some parts 
with rounded pebbles. The links of Peterhead, part of the braes 
between the links and brickwork, and some fields near the Kirk- 
town, form an exception, being covered with sea-sand to a con- 
siderable depth. Below the sand there is generally clay, but in 
some instances moss and vegetable remains. The Stirlinghill is 
separated from the hill of Invernettie by a deep morass. There 
are very few flints on Stirlinghill; but on the hill of Invernettie 
and the Blackhill, the surface is almost covered with rounded 
flints, many of which, on being broken, are found to contain animal 
and vegetable remains, chiefly the impressions of sea-shells. These 
shells embrace considerable variety of the Echini family, occasion-

allv entire, but more frequently only snnall portions of the impres 
sions of these shells are found. Single spines frequently occur, 
■uid are distinctly marked. The Inoceramus, Pectens, and Tere- 
bratulse are very abundant. In the parish of St Fergus, near the 
mouth of the Ugie, in the limestone, the Corjiua ammonis and 
mussels of a distinct variety from those now existing are found. 
The same range of high ground, which commences at Stirhnghill, 
passes into the parishes of Cruden, Longside, and Old Deer, and 
along the whole range, which rests upon granite, or other primitive 
rocC the same kinds of flint have been found containing remains, 
chiefly of shells. The locality of these flints has attracted the 
attention of geologists. In the granite quarries there is, in the fis- 
sures of the rock, gravel mixed with oxide of iron ; and in situations 
where the soil is gravel, or clay mixed with gravel, there is an 
incrustation of iron between the soil and subsoil, —the latter is 
in consequence rendered impervious to water until the incrustation 
be destroyed. 

Extensive fields of granite are found in a state of decomposition. 
When these fields are laid open as gravel pits, the vertical section 
has much the appearance of sound granite in the quarry, exhibit- 
in o' the outlines of blocks of various sizes, divided from each other 
by fissures filled with clay and other matters, coloured by oxide 
of iron. Upon examining some of these apparent blocks, parts 
of them are found to be in an undecomposed state, while the other 
parts are found from one gradation of decomposition to another, 
until the decomposition is so complete as to form a mass of clay 
and gravel, fit for forming a soil capable of cultivation. In some 
cases the decomposed granite is almost white, while in others it 
is of a darkish red. A considerable part of the parish of Peter- 
head had been covered with peat moss, consisting chiefly of the 
roots and branches of trees, which compose the first stratum ; 
the second stratum is not unfrequently composed of the coarser 
grasses ; the third of heath, and the upper of fog. The remains 
of wood found in the mosses are, oak, alder, birch, &amp;c. ; and there 
are also masses of bog-iron ore. At no very remote period, the 
low grounds, commencing at the sea near Buchanhaven, had been 
covered with moss. This moss had nearly joined the one called 
Megg's Moss, which again passed through the lands of Auchty- 
gall and CoUielaw, and joined the moss of Faichfield in the parish 
of Longside. Excepting in those places already mentioned which 
are covered with diluvial or alluvial clay, the other parts of the parish 



350 ABKUDKIiNSHIRE. 

had been covered with heath or moss, and the subsoil had been 
separated from the soil bv the iron incrustation ah-eady described. 
In these situations the soil is various, being in most cases clay and 
gravel, sometimes the one and sometimes the other predominating, 
arising chiefly from the decomposition of granite and flint inter- 
mixed with remains of moss. The deposits of gravel, flint, and 
clay, mixed with rounded stones or pebbles on the hills, have evi- 
dently resulted from the action of water, as they exhibit all the 
appearances of similar deposits on the shores ; and these deposits 
are separated from one another by incrustations of iron, lying at 
various angles, and not uufrequently inclosing the deposits of gra- 
vel, &amp;c. by curved lines. The matters of the separated strata 
are often very different, as clay, gravel, flint, &amp;c. The plants 
which had grown on the mosses and moors were chiefly heath, 
bent, and the coarser grasses. Upon penetrating, however, into 
the subsoil, and mixing it with the top soil, after complete drain- 
ao-e, clover and some of the better sorts of grass make their ap- 
pearance. 

ZooZoy.— Notwithstanding the very little shelter from wood, 
there is considerable variety of wild animals found in this parish. 
The domesticated animals are not diff'erent from those found in 
other parts of the country. Among the feathered tribe, the com- 
mon hen, duck, goose, turkey, peacock, and pigeon, are reared in 
abundance. Among quadrupeds there are swine, sheep of the 
Cheviot and Highland breeds, and occasionally goats, as well as 
many varieties of the dog and cat. Of the larger animals there 
are horses, and black-cattle of the Aberdeenshire breed. These 
last are well known as the cattle of the district, and have been i 
long esteemed for various good qualities as the polled Buchan 
breed. The Teeswater or short-horned breed has lately been m-- 
t reduced. The long-horned are occasionally to be seen, and many 
Orkney and Shetland ponies and black-cattle are imported. The 
latter are generally fed, and the beef is superior to that of the na- 
tive breeds. Asses are occasionally employed for the carriage of 
milk and other purposes. Of game, the hare, rabbit, moorfowl, 
partridge, and snipe are the most common.

head, and other animals found in its vicinity during the last ten

may be so designated, of submerged algae. Tliese are so different 
in their external characters, and of such variety, that awide field 
is presented for investigation and classification. A few of those 
best known and most abundant may be named, viz. 

Fucus vesiculosus Fucus digitatus Fucus piiinatifidus

serratus esculentus

Fungi — Of these there are many species growing on the links 
and by the sides of dikes. The Agaricus campestris, or common 
mushroom, is very abundant, and is gathered for catsup sauce. 

Lichens and musci are also to be found in great variety upon 
the rocks and shrubs, and in the mosses ; and afford an ample 
field for investigation to those already acquainted in some degree, 
or desirous of becoming acquainted, with this branch of natural 
history. 

II. — Civil History. 

Peterhead is mentioned in various acts of the Scottish Parlia- 
ment. The original charter of erection has been published. It 
is a very distinct deed, and shows the commencement of the burgh 
of barony, and the vocations of the original inhabitants. 

Account of the Parish. — The late Dr William Laing, of the 
Episcopal chapel of Peterhead, published, in 1793, " An Ac- 
coiintof Peterhead, its mineral wells, air, and neighbourhood." 
The Statistical Account of Dr Moir was published in 1795. 
In 18] 5, the late James Arbuthnot, Junior, Esq. published 
" An Historical Account of Peterhead, from the earliest pe- 
riod to the present time, comprehending an account of its trade, 
shipping, commerce, and manufactures ; mineral wells, baths, &amp;c. 
with an Appendix containing a copy of the charter of erection," 
&amp;c. In 1819, Mr Peter Buchan published " Annals of Peter- 
head," containing the same information as Mr Arbuthnot's account, 
with such additional matter as he had been able to collect. 

Historical Notices.— The Earls Marischall had their chief resi- 
dence at Inverugie Castle, on the opposite side of the Ugie, in 
the parish of St Fergus ; but a large portion of the parish of Pe- 
terhead was embraced in their estates. It would be out of place 
here to enter into a historical account of that ancient family, which 
will be found in the general history of Scotland. The founder of 
Peterhead was also the founder of Marischall College, Aberdeen. 
The last Earl forfeited his estates in 1715, in consequence of his 
adherence to the fVxmily of Stuart. The Pretender landed at Pe- 
terhead m December 1715. The inhabitants were attached t„

the Marisc.hall family, and in general embraced their views ; and, in 
consequence, they on that occasion espoused the claims of the 

house of Stuart. 

There have been six Presbyterian ministers since the Revolu- 
tion, viz. Mr Guthrie, Mr Brown, Mr Farquhar, Mr Walker, Dr . 
George Moir, and the present incumbent, Mr Donald. Two of 
them, Mr Brown and Mr Farquhar, left Peterhead, and were set- 
tled, the former at Belhelvie, and the other at Chapel of Garioch. 

Land-oicners.—The present heritors of the parish are, the Go- 
vernors of the Merchant Maiden Hospital of Edinburgh ; Mrs 
Gordon of Boddam and Sandford ; George Skelton of Invernet- 
tie Lodge ; George Arbuthnot of Invernettie ; William Arbuth- 
not of Dens and Downie-hiUs ; Dr Cruickshank of Little Cock- 
law '; George Mudie of Meethill ; Thomas Arbuthnot of part of 
Meethill; James Sangster, part of Invernettie; Kenneth M'ln- 
tosh, part of Invernettie; Charles Brand, part of Invernettie; 
William Donaldson of Cowhills; William Gamack, part of Inver- 
nettie; Robert Arbuthnot of Mount Pleasant and Blackhouse; 
George Walker of Balmoor ; Mrs Walker's Trustees, part of Bal- 
moor; Robert Walker, Senior, Grange; Robert Walker, Junior, 
Richmond; Alexander Stuart, CoplandshiU; the Heirs of James 
Hutchison of Richmond ; the Trust-Disponees of Mrs Hay Mu- 
die of Meikle Cocklaw; the Trustees of the late Peter Hay of 
Hayfield; James Shirras of Berryhill; Robert Mavor of Windy- 
hills; the Heirs of James Reid of Ellishill ; and Roderick Gray, 

part of Blackhill. . 

Antiquities.T\ieve are two old castles in the parish, Ravens- 
crao- and Boddam. Ravenscrag, in the barony of Torterston, 
is slid to have belonged to the family of Keith, who afterwards 
acquired the lands of Inverugie by marriage. It is a hne ruin 
and specimen of an old baronial castle. The walls are in some 
places eleven feet thick. It is supposed to have been bui t m the 
eleventh or twelfth century. Boddam Castle was the residence of 
a branch of the Marischall family ; but it is not so ancient as Ka- 
venscrao-. Within the last twenty years various antiquities have 
been discovered within the parish of Peterhead and its immediate 
neighbourhood. On the estate of Cairngall, in the adjoining pa- 
rish of Longside, two oak coffins or chests were discovered on re- 
Iving a tumulu's of moss. One of them was entire, tlie other was 
not. Thev had been hollowed out of solid trees, and measured 
each sevenVeet by two feet. The sides were parallel, and the

ends were rounded, and had two projecting knobs to facilitate their 
carriage. The bark of the trees of which they had been formed 
remained on them, and was in the most perfect state of preserva- 
tion. No vestige of bones was found in either of them. They 
had been covered over with slabs of wood, and lay east and west, 
which indicated they had been used as coffins ; but the absence of 
bones or other human remains is difficult to be accounted for. In 
the parish of Cruden, in a little hill, about four feet below its apex, 
a stone crypt or sarcophagus was discovered, containing a consi- 
derable portion of two human skeletons ; the one that of an adult, 
the other of a young person, perhaps of twelve or thirteen years of 
age; and also part of the skeleton of a dog; two clay urns, a 
larger and a lesser one, rudely ornamented with bars or hoops 
scratched around the outside of them ; seven flint arrow points ; 
two flint knives, one of them considerably worn ; a polished stone 
about four and one-fourth inches in length, neatly drilled through 
its four corners, and slightly concave on the one side, and convex 
on the other. It is probable the polished stone had been applied 
to the centre of the bow, to secure a more accurate discharge of 
the arrow. A neck chain and battle-axe were dug out of a tumu- 
lus near to the place in the parish of Cruden, where it is supposed 
that Malcolm II. and Canute fought a severe battle, and where 
many tumuli were formerly to be seen. The neck chain is form- 
ed of jet and amber. The jet beads retain their original polish. 
The lower bead measures about four inches, the others from two 
and a half inches to one inch. These beads were separated from 
one another by little formless masses of amber, covered with a 
brown crust ; but otherwise the amber was unchanged, unless that 
it may have been more brittle. The battle-axe is formed of 
black flint. It is about seven inches long, and is less heavy than 
those generally found ; most of which are formed of granulated 
stones, and are larger and weightier than the one above alluded to. 
The necklace had no doubt adorned the person of some Scan- 
dinavian chief. 

A pewter flagon, of no inelegant shape, and capable of holding 
nearly a Scotch pint, was discovered in cutting a deep water course 
through a peat bog. The metal was considerably oxidized. From 
the form of the flagon antiquaries suppose it to have been in use 
about the time of James IV. or V. of Scotland. A small shot of 
malleable iron was dug out near the base of Ravenscrag Castle. 
It is one inch and three-quarters in diameter, and is the second 



356 AUEllDEENSHmE. 

one found near the same place. It is supposed that it had been 
discharged from a wall-piece, and that the wall-piece had been 
tired from the Castle of Inverugie, on the opposite side of the ri- 
ver. These antiquities are noticed here in consequence of hav- 
ing been investigated by Mr Arbuthnot, and a record of them 
preserved in his musuem. 

Upon the top of Meethill, about a mile and a quarter from Pe- A 
terhead, there was a tumulus which had been allowed to remain 
for ages untouched ; and tradition assigned to it the place where 
justice had been administered, and where the ashes of some chief 
reposed. 

The inhabitants of Peterhead received the promise of a perpe- 
tual right to this tumulus, and about a quarter of an acre of ground 
around it, in order to build a tower upon it, in honour of Earl 
Grey and his political principles. In digging for a foundation a 
stone crypt was found, containing an urn, or what had been used 
as such, very different in shape, however, from common urns, be- 
ing long and broad, and much in the shape of a bowl or dish. 
Around the mouth, it was ornamented 'by a band of circular im- 
pressions, in depth nearly one-eighth of an inch, and in field ra- 
ther larger than a shilling. The human remains found were very 
few, being only a fragment or two of the leg or thigh bones, and 
part of the lower jaw, with the teeth still adhering. These re- 
mains were placed in a glass case, and exhibited to the public, at 
one shilling ahead, and the proceeds applied towards the expense 
of the tower ; which, however, still remains in an unfinished 
state. 

On the north side of the Den of Boddam, in a deep morass, 
there are various pits, generally known by the name of the Picts 
Camps; but they are with greater probability supposed to have 
been an encampment of the Danes, when they made landings on 
the east coast of Scotland. 

Public Buildings.— The Town- House, situated in Broad Street, 
was built in 1788. It consists of two floors and a ground area. 
The ground floor is used for shops, the first floor is occupied for 
school-rooms, and the second is used for public business. It is 
surmounted by a handsome spire of granite, 125 feet in height 

The parish church is situated at the entrance of the town ; it 
was built in 1803, and is calculated to contain upwards of 1800 
sitters. It also has a spire built of granite, 118 feet m height. 
The building of this church gave rise to an important question, 



PETERHEAD. 



357 



viz. whether the feuars in the town were obhged to bear a share 
of the expense along with the landward heritors, which was liti- 
gated in the Court of Session and House of Peers. It was finally 
decided that the building of the church was a parochial burden, 
and that the heritors and feuars were liable in this burden accord- 
inT to their real rents. The church is in good repair, and has 
lately been lighted with gas. 

The Episcopal Chapel, in Merchant Street, is a very neat 
building, having a Gothic front of axe-dressed granite. It was 
built in 1814, and is calculated to contain 800 sitters. 

The present Cross was erected in 1832, partly by voluntary 
subscription, on the occasion of the inhabitants obtaining the pri- 
vilege of voting for a Member of Parliament. It is a Tuscan 
pillar of granite, surmounted by the arms of Earl Marischall, the 
founder of the town. 

There are various public halls in the town for the accommoda- 
tion of those who require them : a reading-room, a billiard-room, 
and hot and cold baths. 

The houses, both in the town and parish, are in general built 
of granite, of excellent quality and colour, found in the neighbour- 
hood. Many of the fronts are ashlar, pick-dressed, while others 
are axe-dressed and closely jointed. 

Other Buildings There are two mills within the town, one im- 
pelled by wind and the other by steam, for sawing timber. There 
are also two mills in the parish for manufacturing grain, chiefly 
for the London market ; one at Ravenscrag, and the other at In- 
vernettie, both of which carry on a considerable trade. On the 
estate of Boddam there is a spinning and carding-mill, impelled 
partly by water and partly by steam. 

III. — Population. 
Although there does not appear to have been any official record 
of the population previous to the year 1764, Dr Moir, from data 
contained in the charter of erection, estimated the inhabitants at 
that time, 1593, to amount to 56. From an anonymous manu- 
script, he found that in 1727 they amounted to 900.

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture.— The whole surface of the parish, exclusive of that 
' part on which the town of Peterhead is built, extends to 9006 im- 
perial acres, as nearly as can be at present ascertained ; about 
8266 acres are under cultivation ; about 72 are planted ; about 
544 may still be brought into cultivation, including what is under 
moss servitude ; the remainder of 124 acres can only be partially 
cultivated, in consequence of rock rising to the surface. 

Planting.— Vlantmg on the east coast of Scotland, especial- 
ly near to Peterhead, has hitherto been attempted only to a li- 
mited extent. The attempts which have been made have suc- 
ceeded better than was anticipated. Near the sea hard-wood, 
chiefly ash, elm, birch, beech, mountain-ash, plane, alder, and 
willows have been planted. The first trees which had been 
planted in this parish last century were at ElhshiU and Inver- 
nettie, and, notwithstanding the little extent and want of shel- 
ter, they have risen to a considerable size, and are still thriving.

The late James Ferguson, Esq. of Pitfour, planted some small 
clumps and corners on the estates of Balmoor and Richmond ; 
these have made considerable progress, and continue in a healthy 
state. The Governors of the Merchant Maiden Hospital planted 
a small belt around a piece of ground about half a mile from Pe- 
terhead, intended to be a public garden. This belt continued to 
thrive for some years, and the trees made rapid progress ; but for 
two or three years in succession, owing to north-easterly storms, 
the leaves were destroyed about the month of May ; and, in con- 
sequence, a considerable number of the trees died. The blanks, 
however, have been filled up with young plants, which are thriving. 

George Arbuthnot, Esq. of Invernettie, has planted about seven 
and a half acres. The plants which he used were, ash, elm, plane, 
Dutch alder, birch, lime, horse-chestnut, and mountain-ash ; and 
he mentions that the alder, ash, plane, and elm have succeeded 
best. He also tried some of the fir tribes, which did not succeed 
at first; but he now finds that the white American spruce and sil- 
ver firs are making strong and healthy shoots. 

At some distance from the sea, and where the elevation above 
it is greater, about forty acres have been planted with Scotch fir, 
larch, and spruce, by the Governors of the Merchant Maiden Hos- 
pital. Whether the wood may come to be of value remains to be 
seen. On the east coast, the young trees are often destroyed by 
the north-easterly storms, from which they require to be sheltered, 
by being planted very thick, especially on the side exposed to the 
sea. Early pruning seems very detrimental, if not performed spar- 
ingly. 

Rent. — The rent of the arable land within the parish may be 
stated at from 5s. to L. 6 per acre, according to the quality and 
situation. 

Live-Stock.—T\\e cattle raised are chiefly of the polled Buchan 
breed. Of late the Teeswater short horns have been partially in- 
troduced, and crossed with the native breed. Differences of opi- 
nion are entertained regarding the Teeswater cattle and the cross 
breeds from them, — some being of opinion that the Teeswater 
come much sooner to maturity at not much more expense for rear- 
ing, and yield equally good milk and beef ; while others think that 
the native breed is more easily reared, yielding better milk and 
flesh, and, with equal attention, would come to the same weight, 
although not in the same time. Both breeds are allowed to be ex- 
cellent of their kind, and farther experience can alone determine 



360 



ABEIIOEENSIIIIIE. 



whether the one is destined to supersede the other ; or if both 
should be retained, and kept distinct or crossed. 

Sheep are not reared in sufficient numbers to deserve any par- 
ticular remarks. The horses are also of the native breed, and are 
well fitted for the cart or plough. The following is nearly the 
number of the live-stock in the parish in February 1837, viz.— 
horses, 417 ; stots or oxen, 554 ; cows, 775 ; calves, 181 ; sheep, 
108; swine, 99. 

Htisbandry— In the immediate neighbourhood of the town, the 
lands are let in small lots to the inhabitants on leases of eight years, 
and the following rotations are followed :— A four-shift course, con- 
sisting of one division in turnips or potatoes ; one division in bear or 
oats, sown with grass seeds ; one division in grass ; and one division 
in bear or oats, after grass; or potatoes from two years old grass; oats 
or bear after potatoes or turnips with grass seeds ; first year's grass 
and second year's grass. In some instances, the lots are nearly all 
in grass, in consequence of the rents received from fishermen em- 
ployed in the herring fishery, who pay from L. 2 to L. 6 per acre 
for the use of the ground to dry their nets. Upon the farms in 
the parish, the rotation is generally either a five or a seven-course 
shift. The five-course shift consists of two grass crops in two suc- 
cessive years, one white crop after lea, a green crop or fallow, and 
then another white crop. The seven course shift consists of three 
grass crops in three successive years, two white crops after lea, a 
green crop or fallow, and then another white crop. 

Within the last thirty years, the improvements in agriculture 
have been very extensive ; the whole lands in the parish have been 
drained, and roads have been made for the accommodation of the 
farms. A regular system of farming has been adopted ; the fields 
have been laid out, and, in many cases, enclosed to answer the im- 
proved system of cropping ; and an extent of waste land, not less 
than 1500 imperial acres, has been brought into cultivation. Much 
benefit has been derived from deep ploughing, so as to mix 
the subsoil with the topsoil, and to destroy the ferruginous incrus- 
tation or pan, which in many places divided the one from the other, 
and rendered the soil impervious to water. By attending to the 
improvements already effected, and adopting, when necessary, the 
same means, much may still be done to increase the value of land 
in this parish, as there are many facilities of obtaining manure 
from the town of Peterhead, which do not exist in more remote 
parishes.

Improvements.— It may not be out of place here to mention 
shortly the progressive improvements of the parish, and the means 
by which they have been effected. At the time of the last Sta- 
tistical Account, the alternate system of husbandry had not been 
adopted, and the state of agriculture had not been much improv- 
ed for a very considerable period before. The late James Fergu- 
son, Esq. of Pitfour, was the first who introduced the alternate 
system of husbandry. He gave an example of the great benefit 
resulting from good farming upon the estate of Balmoor, by drain- 
ing, inclosing, dividing into regular fields, planting clumps of wood, 
faflowing, Uming, green-cropping, and laying out in grass. A con- 
siderable part of this estate remains in grass, as laid out by Pit- 
four, and returns high rents. The estates of Peterhead, Clerk- 
hill, Auchtygall, and Torterston, belonging to the Merchant 
Maiden Hospital of Edinburgh, and the estates of Invernettie 
and Boddam, were the next which began to be improved. The 
tenants were bound to a regular rotation of cropping, roads were 
made, the old fences were levelled, open ditches and drains were 
formed, hedges were planted, the old ridges levelled, and the 
land divided into regular fields to answer the rotations agreed 
upon. The same means were resorted to upon the other estates 
in the parish, and the fields soon exhibited a very improved ap- 
pearance, and became of much greater value, both to the proprie- 
tors and- tenants. 

The improvements on the estates of the Merchant Maiden Hos- 
pital have been extensive; — 8851 ells of old feal dikes were 
pulled down and levelled ; 28,285 ells of open drains or ditches 
have been cut; 11,146 ells of covered drains or sewers, built on 
both sides, and covered with granite, were made ; 26,900 ells of 
double ditch and sunk or mound between the two ditches, plant- 
ed with double hedges of hawthorn, and 3786 ells of double stone 
dikes have been formed and built; and 13,155 ells of roads have 
been made for the accommodation of the tenants. 

While the already cultivated land was thus under progressive 
improvement, the waste and hitherto uncultivated ground was 
not neglected. Considerable progress was made by trenching with 
the spade and mattock, on the estate of Invernettie, and the other 
estates in the parish ; but this mode was too expensive to afford 
a reasonable return for the capital expended. It was afterwards 
Ibund that it was possible to improve these lands by the plough, 
and th is method was adopted very extensively on the estates of the 



3j2 



ABERDliENSHIUE. 



Merchant Maiden Hospital, and is now very generally followed on 
other estates. It is shortly as follows : Firsts To remove the 
stones from the surface, and from the soil in so far as they can be 
seen; and this is done more easily, and at less expense, while 
the surfixce has not been broken. Second To drain the land ef- 
fectually ; and it has been found that one very deep drain, proper- 
ly placed, supersedes the necessity of many others. Third, If the 
upper soil is worthless, to plough it slightly, and burn the heath and 
dead moss, which may be done at a very trifling expense in dry 
weather. Fourth, To plough the land with a very strong trench 
plough, drawn by four steady horses or oxen, taking care to keep 
the plough below the moorband, where such exists. The first 
ploughing with the trench plough should be done when the land 
is wet; during the dry season, in most cases, it would be impracticable. 
Fijth, After the land has been trench ploughed, the stones that 
have been ploughed up are also removed, inequalities in the soil 
are made up by a levelling box, and the land is regularly fallowed, 
dunged, limed, and cropped according to the nature of the soil. 

By the means which have now been mentioned, 407 acres on 
the Blackhill of Peterhead, belonging to the Merchant Maiden 
Hospital, have been brought into cultivation, which had been re- 
ported upon by the late Mr Alexander Low of Berwickshire as 
follows : " The hill is very worthless, and bids defiance to the ope- 
ration of the plough for improvement." This hill is now nearly 
all under a regular system of cultivation and yields crops nearly 
equal to the formerly cultivated lands in the neighbourhood. In 
improving this hill, roads have been made to the extent of 3780 
ells; earth fences, 3621 ells; open and covered drains, 5312 ells; 
and stone dikes, about 4000 ells. 

Rental— At the time of the last Statistical Account, the ren- 
tal of the parish amounted to L. 3000 ; in 1803, it was L. 4094 ; in 
1837, it amounted to L. 10,136.

Produce. — It is somewhat difficult to approximate very near to 
the truth, in estimating the gross value of the produce of this pa- 
rish, owing to the produce of the lands in the immediate neigh- 
bourhood of the town being of considerably greater value than 
that of those parts of the parish lying at a distance, and the great 
difference in the rents of the one from the other ; but the follow- 
ing may be taken as being not very far from a fair estimate. 

The cultivated land is 8309 acres. The rotations are seven, 
five, and four. Assume a five shift rotation, viz. — 

i of 8309 acres ='1661 acres in grain crop, at L. 4, 5s. per acre, L. 7039 3 0 

 = 3322 in do. at L. 4, 10s. 14949 0 0

X =1661 in 2d do. at L.l, 15s. 2406 15 0 

L. 30,228 10 0 

It has been generally held that the value of the gross produce 
of land should be about equal to tlirice the amount of the rental,, 
thus

Qtiarries. — There are extensive quarries of granite in the parish. 
From Stirlinghill, stones have been taken for the building of various 
public works, including the Naval Docks at Sheerness, bridges, pe- 
destals, the pillar at the Horse Guards, Carlton Gardens, to the me- 
mory of the Duke of York, &amp;c. Blocks of large size may be raised 
and the granite is of excellent quality, resembling, perhaps, nearer

than any other rock in this country, the Egyptian granite o 
syenite. It admits of being finely polished, and is now extensivel, 
used for that purpose by Mr Alexander Macdonald of Aberdeen, 
who has erected a steam engine for polishing granite, and has pro- 
duced very fine specimens of his work, in chimney-pieces, pillars, 
pedestals, vases, &amp;c. As granite can be polished at less expense 
and in a more perfect manner, by steam than by manual labour, it 
is likely to come into general use. The granite of Peterhead is 
not inferior to that of Stirlinghill, while it is clearer in colour. 
At Salthousehead is a quarry of beautiful gray or white granite of 
excellent quahty, but the rock is covered with a thick mass of clay. 
The quarries on the Blackhill are extensive, and afford blocks of 
large size ; the colour is somewhat different from that of the Stir- 
linghill or Peterhead rock, but it is equally durable and more 
easily wrought in the quarry, being generally of large sizes 
with open joints, and admitting of being easily squared by the 
hammer. The granite of Blackhill, in one quarry, is similar to 
that of Salthousehead.

from February 1817 to January 1822:—

From the inexhaustible resources arising from these quarries, 
the excellent and durable quality of the rock, and their proximity 
to the harbours of Peterhead and Boddam, there can be little 
doubt, that, in the execution of public works of importance, the 
working of them will afford employment to many labourers, and 
tend to the improvement of the neighbourhood.

Fisheries. — The fisheries of Peterhead have always been of great 
importance to the town. The whale-fishery was for many years 
of the first importance ; of late it has not been attended with its 
former success ; but there are still ten vessels employed in that 
trade, and it is not improbable that it may again become more suc- 
cessful, as the late failures have been occasioned more by bad sea- 
sons anvl an altered state of the ice at the fishing ground, than by a 
decrease in the number of the whales. 

It may be interesting to trace the success of the vessels belong- 
ing to Peterhead, employed in the Greenland and Davis' Straits 
Whale Fisheries since the commencement of that trade in 1788 
to the present time. With this view the following account of l«he

The altered state of the whale fishing has been made up in a 
great measure to the community by the success which has of late 
attended the herring fishery. Notwithstanding the Dutch had 
from time immemorial carried on a successful herrinsr fishery on 

1 • o „ 

the coast opposite to Peterhead, it is not many years since this 
fishery was prosecuted to any extent at this place. It commenced 
in 1820, at the suggestion of the writer of this account, by the gen- 
tlemen of Peterhead, who entered into subscriptions with him to 



AnEUDKENSniliK. 



give it a fair trial, and it has gone on increasing gradually and 
steadily. Last season 26-2 boats were employed, and upwards of 
40,000 barrels of herrings were caught. It is supposed that Pe- 
terhead, being farther east than any other point in Scotland, must 
at all times be one of the best stations for carrying on the herring 
fishery, as, if the fish pass along the coast, they must pass very 
near to this headland ; and as the tides are strong, the best fish 
can only make head against them. In point of fact, the curers 
acknowledge that the herrings caught at Peterhead are of supe- 
rior quality. 

The shoals of herrings are followed by spout whales, and an 
attempt, not without success, was last season made to catch these 
whales. The necessary apparatus was invented by Mr Robert 
Hutchison of this place ; and there remains little doubt that, in 
the present season, he will be able to establish the practicability of 
-whale fishing on our own shores ; and thus introduce a trade which 
may be of no small consequence to the country. Mr Hutchison's 
object is to kill the large finners. Last season he succeeded in 
killing three ; but in consequence of their having sunk, he after- 
wards lost them. When they had lain some time at the bottom, 
they again floated, in consequence of the expansion of gases gene- 
rated in them, and were afterwards found. He thinks, however, 
that this season he will be able to keep hold of them by the lines. 
The cod, ling, haddock, and whiting, are to be found in great 
abundance on this coast, and are caught and exported in their 
seasons. Besides these, flounders of all kinds, roughback, plaise, 
sole, halibut, turbot, skate, dog, and catfish, and a great variety 
of others, including the lobster, mackerel, and crab are to be found. 
All these afford ample means for the extension of the white fish- 
ery, and a mine of wealth yet remains to be explored as a reward 
to the exertions of those who may embark in the fisheries at Peter- 
head. 

Manufactures.— There are no extensive manufactures of woollen 
or cotton goods in Peterhead ; there are, however, experienced 
and well employed tradesmen and mechanics in every department 
usually found in larger towns. It is to be regretted that manufac- 
tures have not hitherto been introduced. Peterhead seems well 
adapted for such establishments ; for although there are not 
sufficient waterfalls near the town, there are such in the parish. 
There is a sufficient quantity of water in the town for workmg by 
steam, and the harbours afford facilities for exporting and miport- 



PETliUIIEAD. 



367 



ino- As has been before-mentioned, a carding and spmnmg-mill, 
on"a small scale, has lately been erected on the estate of Boddam ; 
and if the projector of it shall be successful, others may be mdu- 
ced to commence works of a similar nature, a sufficient quantity of 
water could be accumulated as a moving power, and there are va- 
rious falls unoccupied. , , , n 

From the increase of population in Peterhead, the excellence 
of the harbours, the highly cultivated district adjoining, the con- 
sequent abundance of provisions, and the excellent and cheap ma- 
terials for building, found in the neighbourhood, it ni'y be pre- 
sumed that those having a knowledge of manufactures would hnd it 
their interest to settle at Peterhead. 

Brick-ioorL— The Invernettie brick-work has been in operation 
for about forty years. It is now within the Parliamentary boundary 
of the burgh, and is situated about a mile to the south of the town. 
The bed of clay is wrought to the depth of thirty to forty feet. 
Building bricks and tiles of excellent quality are made at this work ; 
and, besides what are required in the district, a very considerable 
quantity is exported annually, chiefly to the Moray Frith. The- 
proprietors have lately erected a small harbour in the immediate 
vicinity of the work, for the accommodation of their trade. 

Rope-ioork. — A rope- work is carried on, on the west side of the 
turnpike road, between the town and the brick-work, and another 
in the town. The business done is considerable, chiefly in mak- 
ing ropes for ships belonging to Peterhead, or frequenting the port. 

Gas-work. — In 1833, a joint-stock company was established in 
Peterhead for the manufacture of gas. The buildings are situated 
in Longate, and the business is conducted by a board of directors 
and a manager. 

Kelp or Sea-ware. — The kelp shores in this parish during the 
late war were of considerable value, yielding a rental of upwards 
of L. 120 per annum. They are now unlet, as it has been found 
here that kelp will not yield more than the expense of manufac- 
turing it ; it is, therefore, of importance to find out any other use- 
ful purpose to which the sea-ware or fuci can be applied. It will 
be found that the kelp-ware may be cut, dried, and carried to a 
considerable distance at less expense than the wet ware cast on 
shore by the violence of the sea ; and a single cart-load of dried 
ware is equal to six cart-loads of wet ware, — for example, a cart- 
load may be cut and carried on shore for 6d. and dried for 3d., 
which is equal to 4s. 6d. for a load of dried ware ; and as six loads 



368 



ABERDEENSHIRE. 



of wet ware are only equal to one of dry ware, and the expense of 
carrying- a load of wet ware to a distance of four miles is 2s., 
the carriage of the six loads would be 12s., while an equal quan- 
tity of dried ware would only cost for cutting and drying 4s. 6d. 
and carriage 2s., in all 6s. 6d., leaving a balance of 5s. 6d. in fa- 
vour of the dried ware when carried an equal distance, supposing 
it, in either case, to be got without any other price than the ex- 
pense of cutting and gathering. It will also be found that the ware 
does not lose any of its powers as a manure by being dried. The 
ware maybe used, 1st, mixed with earth or peat-moss, by which it 
is decomposed ; Qd, mixed with stable yard dung ; 3d, as a litter 
for cattle or horses ; 4th, sls fodder in part for cattle, it having 
been found that cattle will feed upon it. The three first of these 
uses have been experimented upon with success in this parish. 
The last suggestion, that it might be used for the purpose of feed- 
ing cattle, would require to be more fully put to the test of expe- 
rience before any thing can be asserted with confidence regarding 
its qualities in that respect. During the last season, it was, in 
• a few cases, used for the above purpose, and said to be relished by 
the cattle. The best mode of using it would, perhaps, be to cut 
it along with the straw, and mix both together. It is probable, that 
it might be improved by being steamed before being used. It may 
be added that the species of ware most esteemed by kelp-makers, 
called black ware, will be found to be more powerful as a manure 
than the red ware cast upon the shores during storms. In both cases, 
whether used as a manure or for feeding cattle, it is an object well 
worth the attention of agriculturists near the coast ; and it is to be 
hoped that experiments may be made, and the result communicat- 
ed to the public. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Town of Peterhead. — The town of Peterhead stands upon a pe- 
ninsula projecting into the German Ocean, and forming the most 
easterly point of land in Scotland. The isthmus which connects 
the town and country part of the parish is about 800 yards in 
breadth. Dr Moir states that the town, which had then been only 
a small fishing village, with the adjoining lands of considerable 
value, belonged to the abbey of Deer in 1560, and that, in that 
year, Queen Mary appointed Robert Keith, son of William fourth 
Earl Mariscball, commendator of Deer. Peterhead was erected 
into a burgh of barony by George Earl Marischall in 1593. It 
continued a part of the estates of the Earls Marischall until the

attainder of the last Earl, in consequence of his accession to the 
Rebellion in 1715. It was then purchased by the York-Buildings 
Company, who sold it to the present proprietors, the Governors of 
Maiden Hospital, founded by the Coaipany of Merchants of the 
city of Edinburgh and Mary Erskine, in 1728. 

The original inhabitants appear to have been 6shers, and the 
chief trade carried on at Peterhead, for a long time after it became 
a burgh of barony, was the white-fishing, in which the proprietor 
had an interest by drawing teinds of the fish caught. The fish- 
ermen were taken bound to assist in the erection of a harbour, 
which they did, and which still remains under the name of Port 
Henry. By the original charter in 1593, the Earl Marischall esta- 
blished a municipal government in the town in the following terms : 
" For gyding and rewiling of the quilk brugh, the said Erie and 
his foresaidis sail elect, nominat, and chuse baillies, clerkes, and 
otheres officeares, necessares and meit for the governement of the 
samin, of the nichbouris, and fewares of the said brugh, actuall in- 
duellers for the time, within the same, the said Erie alwyse and 
his foresaidis remaning proveist or sd baillie yairof," &amp;c. And 
this system of municipal government continued until the passing 
of the Parliamentary Burgh Reform Act. By this act the muni- 
pal government has been vested in twelve councillors, who, from 
their own number, choose a provost, three baillies, and a treasurer, 
and the boundaries of the town have been defined and considera- 
bly extended, embracing part of the lands qf Black House and 
Invernettie, beyond the limits of the barony of Peterhead. The 
barony of Peterhead, besides the estates of Peterhead proper, 
embraces the lands of Clerkhill, Auchtygall, and Collielaw. The 
lands of Torterston are erected into a separate barony, under the 
name of the Barony of Torterston. 

The town of Peterhead has been much extended, and the num- 
ber of its inhabitants has greatly increased since the last Statistical 
Account was written. The ground now occupied by the town ex- 
tends to about 70 imperial acres, of which about 20 are occupied 
by streets. The length of the streets is about 4 miles 5 furlongs 
and 148 yards. The number of inhabited houses is about 1000. 
The rental of houses and warehouses in the town is about L.7500. 

Ronheads. — The Ronheads is situated within the burgh, oppo- 
site a ridge of rocks on the north side of the north harbour. It 
is inhabited chiefly by fishermen, who supply the town with fish, 
apd act as pilots. Some of these at least may be reasonably sup-

posed to be descendants of the original inhabitants. They have 
hitherto got the stances of their houses rent free, in consequence 
of being bound by the original charter to pay teind fish to the 
proprietors of the ground. Owing to the fishermen being also 
pilots, and some of them seamen and shipmasters, they do not pay 
that attention to the fishing which its importance deserves. The 
original harbour, built in 1593, and named Port Henry, is occu- 
pied by the fishermen's boats. 

Buchanhaven.— This village is also now within the Parliamen- 
tary boundary of the burgh. The inhabitants are employed in 
the white and herring fisheries. Five herring boats, and five white- 
fishing boats belong to it. A small harbour has been erected for 
the accommodation of the fishermen belonging to the village. 

Community of Feuars. — Certain properties and privileges of 
commonty and common pasturage, fuel, feal, and divot were grant- 
ed to the original feuars of Peterhead, by Earl Marischall in the 
charter of erection. In 1774, these properties and privileges were 
confirmed by the Governors of the Merchant Maiden Hospital, 
who agreed to divide the commonties, and they accordingly con- 
veyed those parts of them which fell to their feuars, to certain of 
the feuars, for themselves, as feuars of the town of Peterhead, and 
as trustees for and in name of the haill other then feuars there- 
of, and of all such persons as should at any time thereafter be- 
come feuars of the said town or lands, and the heirs and succes- 
sors of all the then present and future feuars, to be improved 
and applied as a majority of the said feuars, at the time, and from 
time to time, should think fit, for the public good and utihty of the 
said town. In the charters subsequently granted a share of these 
properties and privileges is conveyed to the individual feuars. The 
rental of the feuars' properties now amounts to about L. 260 per 
annum. These properties are claimed by the magistrates, in vir- 
tue of the Burgh Reform Act ; and this claim has been resisted on 
the part of the hospital and their feuars, on the ground that the same 
are private property, arising out of legal deeds between superior 
and vassal. In order to have this point decided, mutual actions 
of declarator have been raised, and are now depending in the Su- 
preme Court. These actions, it is probable, would not have been 
necessary if proper inquiries had been made before the act was 

passed. . .

tains subjects and specimens connected with the various branches 
of natural history, mineralogy, geology, &amp;c. There is also a col- 
lection of antiquities, a portion of which is rendered particularly 
interesting, as they have been found in our own country, and some 
of them in our own immediate neighbourhood. The museum em- 
braces likewise a valuable and interesting collection of coins. The 
English coins embrace the whole period from the time of Edgar 
to that of William IV ; the Scotch, from William the Lion to 
James VI. The Grecian coins consist of those of the pruici- 
pal petty states ; of Philip, King of Macedon, and Alexander the 
Great. The Roman coins comprehend not only those of the Em- 
perors, but also of the consuls, coadjutors, and usurpers. The mu- 
seum is always accessible to the public. 

Police.— The town of Peterhead obtained an act of Parliament, 
in 1820, for supplying the inhabitants with water, and for paving, 
lighting, and otherwise improving the streets. Previous to the 
passing of this act, the inhabitants were supplied with water from 
the roofs of their houses, or from wells dug in. the neighbourhood 
of them ; and in either case the supply was precarious, and the 
water of bad quality. Considerable expense had been incurred 
in searching for good spring water within a moderate distance 
from the town, but without success. At length, in draining upon 
the estate of Auchtigall, a very copious spring was found, yielding 
upwards of forty gallons of pure spring water per minute. This 
spring is now conveyed to the town, a distance of 2 miles, 5 fur- 
longs, and 10 yards; and the inhabitants enjoy the comfort of an 
adequate supply of excellent water fit for every domestic purpose. 
Before the Police Act was obtained, the streets had been much 
improved by removing obstructions and inequalities, and substi- 
tuting metalling for rough undressed stones, with which they were 
paved. Side paths were laid off, and paved either with dressed 
granite, or crib and pebbles. 

The expenses incurred in bringing water into the town amount- 
ed to L.3167. The annual rate of assessment has hitherto been 
Is. 9d. per pound, which is applied to pay the interest of the 
money borrowed, and for lighting the streets and executing the 
other purposes of the act.

Turnpike Roads.— T\xQ turnpike roads are, the south road to 
Aberdeen, the west to Banff, and the north to Fraserburgh, 
amounting altogether in length to about nine or ten miles withm 

the parish. .in v, i 

Coac/ies.— There are four coaches connected with FeterheaU : 
the Mail to and from Aberdeen daily ; the Mail to and from 
Banff daily; the Defiance stage-coach to and from Aberdeen 
daily ; and the Lord Saltoun stage-coach betwixt Peterhead and 
Fraserburgh every alternate day. 

The Harbours.— These harbours, from their peculiar situation 
at the termination of the most easterly promontory of land in Scot- 
land, and the great resort to them, deserve particular notice. 

The earhest notice taken of these harbours is in the charter of 
erection of the town of Peterhead, by George Earl Marischall, in 
1593. In that charter the Earl binds himself to " build ane bul- 
wark in the mouth of the haven called Port Henry." This bul- 
wark was accordingly erected by his Lordship, and is the same for- 
merly noticed as being used by the fishermen in the Ronheads tor 
landing their boats. The bulwark is built in a very rough man- 
ner, with masses of undressed granite. It has never required to 
be repaired, and the original pieces of oak timber used as moor- 
ing posts, are still in a serviceable state. This harbour is capable 
of holding from six to eight vessels, not exceeding 100 tons bur- 
den; but is seldom used except by the fishermen for their boats. 

It does not appear at what time the south haven or harbour had 
been erected, but it does not seem to have been of much import- 
ance at the beginning of last century ; for in 1702, the whole re- 
venue arising from it was only L. 71, 6s. Scots, and it was ca- 
pable of containing a very few vessels of small size. It would seem 
that at this time the pier of the harbour had fallen into decay and 
was in need of repair. In the year 1 705, in consequence of the 
great public utility of these harbours, an act of the Pnvy-eouncil 
of Scotland was passed, authorizing a voluntary contribution tor 
repairing the harbours of Peterhead, to be made throughout the 
three Lothians, and all north of the Forth. No collection, how- 
ever, was made in consequence of this act, the Earl Marischall 
having been of opinion that he would be able to obtain more effi- 
cient assistance from the British Parliament ; but in consequence 
of his being engaged soon after in the Rebellion, the matter was 



PETERHEAD. 



373 



never by him brought before ParUament, and the harbour conti- 
nued in the same ruinous state at the time of his forfeiture in 17J6. 

The estate and harbours of Peterhead, after Earl Marischall's 
attainder, were purchased from Government by the York-Build- 
ings Company; but this company adopted no measures for repair- 
ing the harbours, although a petition was presented to the mana- 
gers, pointing out the urgent necessity of having them repaired. 
In 1726, the estate was sold, along with the harbours, to the Oro- 
vernors of the Merchant Maiden Hospital of Edinburgh, wlio stdl 
continue superiors of the town and harbours. At that time, from 
the limited extent of the harbours, and the state of repair they 
had fallen into, the revenue amounted only to L. 12 per annum ; 
and only three small vessels belonged to the port. In July 1729, 
an act of the Convention of Royal Burghs was obtained in favour of 
the town of Peterhead, for a voluntary contribution throughout all 
the burghs of the country for repairing these harbours. It does 
not appear what the extent of the contribution obtained was, but 
it would appear it had not been adequate to the repairs, for, in 
1730, the ship-masters of Leith, and merchants of Edinburgh 
gave an attestation of the great public utility of these harbours ; 
and the town-council of Edinburgh authorized a collection to be 
made in all the churches of the city and its neighbourhood, which 
was made accordingly, and amounted to L. 240, 14s. 6d. Sterling; 
and so much anxiety was evinced for the repairs of these harbours, 
that, in February 1740, an assembly was held in Edinburgh in aid 
of the other collections for this purpose. 

From the year 1740 to the year 1771, it may be supposed that 
the trade of the town had not made rapid progress ; — the follow- 
ing being the annual amount of the harbour duties at different pe- 
riods in that interval ; in 1741, L.20,8s.4d.; 1751, L.30; 1761, 
L.0, 15s. ; 1771, L. 59, 10s. 

In 1771, it would appear that the south harbour had again fal- 
len into disrepair, and, with the aid of contributions from the royal 
burghs, from the superiors, from private individuals, and from 
money raised upon the security of the property belonging to the 
community of feuars, the harbour began to be again repaired. 
About this time the plan of the present south harbour was obtain- 
ed from the late Mr Smeaton, engineer, and the building of it ac- 
cording to his plan commenced in June 1773. The construction 
of the old south harbour was just the reverse of that of the new 
one. The old harbour was enclosed by two curved piers towards 



374 ABtiRDKENSHIttE. 

the sea, having an opening for the mouth, and the effect of this 
was, that the harbour was not quiet within. The present south 
pier is concave towards the sea, so as to make the waves run along 
it from each end until they meet in the centre, when they destroy 
each other and are thrown off seaward. The west pier is nearly 
at right angles with the south pier, and is covered by it, and the 
former has a jetty running eastward, parallel with the south pier, 
which protects the interior of the harbour from the seas which may 
yet get round the end of the south pier. 

By a contract entered into between the governors of the hospital 
and their feuars in 1774, the latter acknowledged that the har- 
bours, quays, anchorages, shore-dues, and petty customs, and 
emoluments arising therefrom, were disponed, and belonged to 
the hospital as part of their estate. Nevertheless, the governors, 
for the encouragement of their feuars, and for promoting the pub- 
lic good and utility of the town, agreed that the rents and profits 
of these subjects should be received and applied by their feuars 
for the time being, or the majority of them, for enlarging, build- 
ing, repairing, and upholding the harbours, piers, shores, and 
other public works within the town, in time coming, but always 
under the inspection, and subject to the control of the governors, 
or such person or persons as they should appoint, from time to 
time, for that purpose. The piers of the south harbour were 
completed in 1781, and cost- L. 3256, 6s. lOd. ; but even after 
that expenditure, the harbour was only capable of contammg about 
twenty sail of small vessels. The rock and other stuff continued 
to be excavated from the interior of the harbour, in consequence 
of which the accommodation to vessels was rendered greater, and 
the trade and revenue increased, as will be seen from the following 
account of the annual revenue, at different times, from 1772 to 
1807 :

At the latter period the harbour had been so much enlarged 
as to be capable of containing 50 or 60 sail of vessels ; but even 
this increased means of accommodation was found uiadequate to 
the trade of the place ; and the late Mr John Rennie, engmeer, 
was applied to for a plan and estimate for extendmg the south 
harbour, and for building a new north harbour; and an act of 

3 



PETERHEAD.

Parliament was applied for and obtained, for the further improve- 
ment of the south, and the erection of the north harbour. boon 
after this, 50,000 cubic yards of rock and other stulf were ex- 
cavated from the bottom of the south harbour,— the jetty of the 
west pier was extended 40 feet,-a quay, extendmg 300 ieet in 
length, was built upon the east side of the harbour,— an addition ot 
about 200 feet in length was made to the west pier, which cost 
about L. 13,800, including a grant of L. 3900 obtained from the 
Commissioners for Highland Roads and Bridges out of the For- 
feited Estates' Fund. By these improvements the south harbour 
was rendered capable of containing from 100 to 120 vessels in 
complete safety. The rock and other stuff taken from the hot- 
torn of the south harbour, was deposited in the direction of a 
small rocky island, called the Greenhill, so as to connect it with 
the south, and form the boundary of the north harbour; and 
this stuff was protected from the sea by a bulwark. The trade 
and shipping still continued to increase ; and in 1815 it was found 
that additional accommodation had again become necessary. Un- 
der these circumstances, the governors of the hospital and the 
trustees of the harbours again appUed to the Parliamentary Com- 
missioners for Roads and Bridges, and made offer to find security 
for one moiety of the expense of erecting the north harbour, and 
building a graving dock, which had become very necessary, in 
consequence of many vessels being, stranded, and sustaining da- 
mage during the winter season upon the coast near to Peterhead. 
The Commissioners having agreed to grant one moiety, ordered 
a survey and estimate to be made by the late Mr Thomas Telford, 
civil- engineer. Mr Telford accordingly gave in a report and 
plans for the works. The harbour was begun to be built in 1818 ; 
but, owing to the exposed situation of the breakwater or great pier, 
and its having to sustain the great force of the sea from the east 
and north, when in an unfinished state, and in consequence un- 
protected, it was totally destroyed by a tremendous storm which 
occurred in October 1819. Upon being applied to, the Com- 
missioners agreed to bear one-half of the expense of rebuilding 
the pier, which was immediately set about ; and the north har- 
bour, according to Mr Telford's plan, was finished in September 
1822, at an expense of L. 25,194, 2s. 3d. This harbour, being 
unprotected on the north side, the trustees soon after commenced 
to build a pier in that direction, which is now to be completed,

The first Act of Parliament for the improvement of these har- 
bours was to continue for twenty-one years, and, therefore, it be- 
came necessary to apply for a new act ; and accordingly, in 1827, 
an act was obtained with additional powers to the trustees and un- 
limited in duration. 

The effects produced by the improvement of the harbours of 
Peterhead will be seen from the increase of shore dues from 1807 
to the present time, 1st March 1837.

The area of the south harbour is 6.6 imperial acres. The area 
of the north harbour 10.86 imperial acres. The length of the 
south quay of the south harbour is 480 feet, its greatest breadth 
is 42 feet, the height from the base to the top of the parapet 40

The number of vessels which entered the harbours during the 
same period was 832, and their tonnage 48,136. The number 
of ships belonging to the Port of Peterhead on the 1st January 
1837 was 82, and their tonnage 11,022. 

The number of wind-bound vessels which have entered the har-

which shows of what importance these harbours are to the general 
trade and shipping interests of the country ; and this importance 
will be greatly increased, when the pier now under execution is 
finished, as the harbours will then be capable of affording accom- 
modation to steam vessels.

house, but hitherto without effect. Of late, the officers have been i 
reduced in number, while their duties have increased. 

Village of Boddam. — This village is situated about three miles 
to the south of Peterhead, on a projecting point of land, a little 
to the north of Stirlinghill. It has a south and north boat har- 
bour, the latter being also capable of receiving ships of moderate ■ 
draught of water ; these harbours are only separated from each 
other by a beach of small rounded stones. The light-house at 
Buchanness is situated on an island, separated from the mainland 
and the village by these harbours. Population of the village 460. 

The number of herring boats belonging to Boddam will amount 
for this year to 23. The annual produce of the Boddam herring 
fishery may be fairly stated at L. 100 per boat on an average of 
seasons. 

There are three principal fishings, called the summer, the her- 
ring, and the winter fishings. The summer or haddock fishing, 
which occupies from March to July in catching, preparing, and 
going to market with the produce, is carried on in 22 smaller sized 
boats, manned with four men each, and generally a boy, who has 
a small share. From 25,000 to 30,000 fish are considered a fair 
fishing, and they generally bring from L. 3 to L. 4 per thousand, 
according to their size and quality. 

The herring fishing occupies the months of July, August, and 
September : after this the fishermen go for their bait, and occa- 
sionally go to sea, or prepare for the winter or cod fishing. This 
last is carried on in twelve boats, of a size between that of a her- 
ring boat and common fishing yawl, each boat being manned by 
six men. From 1200 to 1800 cod fish to each boat is considered 
an excellent fishing, and these bring 4d. to 6d. each, according 
to size. This fishing ends at Candlemas, when the fishermen 
again go to supply themselves with bait, and thereafter prepare 
for the summer fishing. 

The common kinds of fish caught here are, the cod, the had- 
dock, and whiting, with occasionally the turbot, ling, and skate. 
The fishing is made at no very great distance off the coast. Un- 
til a market was found in summer for haddocks, which is the time 
they are in poorest condition, the fishermen were in the habit of 
going to what was called the deep sea fishing, at a bank, a long 
way off the coast, where they were very successful in catching ling, 
cod, turbot, skate, and flat fish of different kinds ; but for some

granted to Peterhead.

years back this Bshing has been entirely gwen up, as the sumnier 
dHed haddocks have proved more profitable. From the local ty 
0 Boddam, extending into the German Ocean, and nearly as far 
St as Pet'erhead, th haddocks are always w.thm he reach of 
the fishermen. These haddocks, when taken from tle oa , a e 
split up, carefully washed, and salted m heaps upon the bead 
after lying a sufficient time, they are earned to the rocks and 
X'out, one by one, great care being taken to P-e-  
from occasional rain. They are every mght gathered mto heaps, 
nd again spread out in the morning. After bemg suffioen ly 
dried, and in condition for preserving, they are taken home and 
stored up. Previous to being taken to market, they are smoked 
on spits with peat smoke, which gives them a fine colour and an 
ao-reeable flavour. They are then put into one heap, and strongly 
pressed down, which gives them a fine marketable appearance 

The fish from Boddam obtain a decided preference m the 
market,-partly from the great care taken upon them, by the people 
themselves, but in a great measure owing to the rocks a ong the 
shore on which the fish are dried, and which are quite clean and 
free from sand. 

The average value of the last five years' fishing has been nearly 
as follows : — 

The crews of 21 boats ynth four men each, say at L. 25 each man, L. 2100 0 0 
The fishing of 12 boats with six men each, say at L. 8 each man, 51b U u

The Yearly value of the fish used by the fishermen, and of oU made by 
them, and of the dog -fish, and refuse sold for manure, may be esti-

which, divided among 80 families, gives nearly L. 80 to each. 

It would be improper to overlook the outlay incurred by the 
fishermen, which is considerable. Each boat while at the herring- 
fishing requires to have a hired man, whose wages are equal to one- 
eighth part of the price of a crane of herrings. Female servants are 
engaged, not for the half year, but during the fishing, perhaps for 
three months, and their wages are from L. 2 to L. 2, 10s. A 
considerable quantity of salt, bark, hemp, hair, &amp;c. are necessary 
for the general fishings, and the boats used are of the best quality, 
and are never kept above seven or eight years, when they are dis- 
posed of to less wealthy fishermen, and replaced by new ones. A

summer line costs L. 3, and a winter one L. 4, and many of these 
are annually lost. 

All the haddocks caught during the past winter have been sold 
to curers in Peterhead, and the haddock- fishing in winter has now 
become a new branch of industry ; formerly the cod-fishing was 
the principal winter fishing, in the course of which the fishermen 
generally caught a sufficient supply for their own use and the 
home market ; since this opening has occurred, however, they have 
thought it worth their while to prosecute the haddock-fishery, and 
during last season they have been benefited to the extent of about 
L. 2 each man. The winter is the season when the haddocks are 
in the best condition ; and it is supposed, that if the finest of these 
were packed with ice, in the same manner as salmon, they could 
be conveyed to the most distant market in fine condition. 

Boddam has greatly increased within a few years. It has derived 
much benefit from its proximity to the Buchanness Lighthouse, 
affording as it does a land-mark to the fishermen. If a harbour 
were erected it might soon be expected to become a large trading- 
place. With the exception of Newburgh there is no other place 
between Aberdeen and Peterhead where a harbour could be erect- 
ed. It is thought that an outlay of from L.1500 to L.1800 would 
make a most commodious little harbour. There would always be 
a greater depth of water there than in the present harbours of 
Peterhead, and an entry could be made from the south or north. 

Many of the fishermen appear, both from name and remaining 
habits, to be of Dutch extraction ; they are doubtless the descen- 
dants of those fishermen who were brought over by King William, 
and planted along the east coasts of Scotland and England. They 
retain a good deal of primitive simplicity. There are now few of 
the young men who cannot read, write, and cast up accounts in a 
very creditable way. Like all others of the same occupation, 
both sexes generally live to an advanced age ; they marry young, 
and have in general large families. 

Buchanness Lighthouse—In the year 1819, a petition was pre- 
sented to the Commissioners of the -Northern Lighthouses by the 
merchants, ship-owners, ship-masters, and others interested in ship- 
ping, representing the dangers of the coast from Girdleness to 
Buchanness, and from thence to Kinnaird's head, and pointing 
out the advantages that were likely to result from the erection of 
a lighthouse upon the Buchanness, not only to the shipping in-

erected.

terest, but also to those engaged in the herring fishery. A se- 
cond petition was presented in 1822 to the same effect, detading 
some shipwrecks which had then recently occurred; and in Janu- 
ary 1824, the commissioners resolved to build a lighthouse at 
Buchanness, and it was soon afterwards completed. It is about 
1 18 feet in height, and built of granite from Stirlinghill. The 
light afforded is what is called a flashing light, which in every five 
seconds of time emerges from a state of partial darkness, and ex- 
hibits a momentary light, resembling a star of the first magnitude. 
It is visible at the distance of five or six leagues, and lesser dis- 
tances, according to the state of the atmosphere. It has answer- 
ed all the good purposes anticipated, both in regard to the ship- 
ping interest generally, and those engaged in the herring-fishery 
at Peterhead and along the coast. 

Burnhaven.— Besides Boddam, Burnhaven is the only village in 
the parish not now included within the Parliamentary boundary of 
the burgh. It is a small fishing village, which has lately been 
erected. under that name, on the north side of the bay of Sand- 
ford, by George Mudie, Esq. of Meethill. The houses are near- 
ly on a level with the high water-mark at the bottom of the sea 
braes, and near the mouth of the burn of Invernetlie— hence its 
name. There have been already built 23 houses, and six more 
have been contracted for. Seven herring boats belong to this vil- 
lage; three of which are to fish this season at home, and four at 
Peterhead. A small harbour or landing place for. the accommoda- 
tion of these boats has been erected by Mr Mudie, at an expense 
of about L.300. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church has already been de- 
scribed as standing at the entrance into the town from the south 
and west. It is about three miles and a half distant from the ex- 
tremity of the parish. It was built in 1803, has repeatedly under- 
gone repairs, and is at present in excellent condition. It is capa- 
ble of containing nearly 2000 sitters. There are twelve free sit- 
tings appropriated for the elders. A new manse was built soon 
after the last Statistical Account was written. The glebe consists of 
upwards of nine Scots acres of good land, which is worth annual- 
ly about L. 50, and the gardens extend to about one acre and a 
quarter, the manse being situated in them. The stipend was last 
mo'dified in 1821. It is 18 chalders of victual, half meal, half bar- 
ley, payable at the highest fiar prices for the county, and L.IO 
for communion elements, which was afterwards extended by the

heritors to L.20, in consequence of the sacrament heing dispensed 
twice a year. 

East or quoad sacra Parish Church. — This church was opened 
as a preaching station in connection with the EstabUshed Church in 
October 1834. The Rev. James Yuille was inducted minister in 
1 835. The church is seated for 700 persons, and the number of 
communicants February 1837 was 415. The stipend is L.120 
per annum, and, in the event of the revenue amounting to L.200, 
the stipend is to be augmented to L.150. There is an endow- 
ment of L.IO in aid of the revenue. 

Episcopal Chapel. — The present church was erected in 1814. 
It is seated for 800 persons. The number belonging to the con- 
gregation is from 1400 to 1500. 

United Associate Congregation. — The church belonging to this 
congregation is calculated to contain about 450 sitters. The late 
Mr John Robertson, farmer in Collielaw, in this parish, mortified 
some property, for behoof of the Seceders in Windmill Street, 
which, since that congregation ceased to exist, has been transferred 
to this congregration. The property yields about L.80 per an- 
num, of which L.IO is apphed to charitable purposes, and the re- 
mainder towards payment of the clergyman's stipend. 

Independents. — The place of worship of this congregation, for- 
merly belonging to the Secession, is not quite so large as that be- 
longing to the United Associate congregation. The number of 
persons belonging to this congregation has not been ascertained ; 
but it is believed that it has rather been on the decrease of late. 

Methodists. — There is a place of worship belonging to this sect, 
capable of containing about 200 persons. They are supplied with 
a preacher once a fortnight from Aberdeen. The congrega- 
tion is understood not to be equal to the extent of accommodation 
in the church. 

Members of Established Church. — The number of families at- 
tending the parish church has not been precisely ascertained ; it 
probably amounts to 1000, — the whole number of famiUes in the 
town and parish being about 1700. The number of persons of 
all ages connected with the Established Church is not less than 
5000, the gross population being reckoned 8000, which must be 
very near the truth ; for, adding to 6695, the population according 
to the census in 1831, 1000 as the number of seamen who were 
not included, and 305 as the probable increase for the last six 
years, we have 8000. 

Here the practice of exacting seat rents universally prevails 



PETEllHEAD. 



383 



Sums varyino- from 2s. to 6s. are charged and paid for each sitting. 
The sacrament of the Lord's supper, since 1822, has been dis- 
pensed twice a year, previous to which period the number of com- 
municants was as high as 1900, and there has without doubt been 
an increase since that time. The number of communicants in 
both the Established Churches at each celebration now varies 
from 1200 to 1500, and as the seafaring part of the population is 
for the most part absent at the summer sacrament, and many of 
those in the country part of the parish cannot conveniently attend 
in winter, the number of those belonging to the Established 
Church, who communicate at least once a year, cannot be less 
than 2000. 

Education.— 'Ihe parish school has for upwards of forty years 
been taught in a room in the town-house, which is vested in the 
community of feuars, and for which the landward heritors pay a 
small sum of yearly rent. Of late the room has been found to be 
inconvenient, in consequence of the noise arising from apartments 
immediately below it, these apartments being used as market-places, 
and from the market stance being immediately in front of the 
town- house. The present schoolmaster, in consequence of these 
circumstances, has applied to have a school and school-house 
erected in terms of the statute; and this has led to an inquiry 
whether the landward heritors are bound to erect such a parish 
school as is required for the town and parish of Peterhead ; or 
whether the erection of a parish school and school-house is not a 
parochial burden, to be borne, the same as the erection of the pa- 
rish church, by both the heritors of the parish, and the feuars of 
the town according to their real rents. In order to avoid the ad- 
judication of this point in a court of law, the principal heritors 
lately agreed to assess themselves in the sum of L.400, if the feu- 
ars and inhabitants would raise L.300 by voluntary contribution, 
and the Governors of the Maiden Hospital, with their usual liberali- 
ty, agreed to give a site for the school and school-house, gratis, to 
the extent of a quarter of an acre. A near prospect was thus af- 
forded of having such a parish school and school-house as the ex- 
tent of the parish of Peterhead seemed to require. But in the 
meantime, a delay has taken place in consequence of one or two 
of the smaller heritors having refused to contribute their share of 
the L.400, and in consequence of some individuals wishing to su- 
persede the parish school, by the establishment of an academy on 
a larger scale, to be conducted, as has been held out by some of 



384 



ABEUDEENSHIRE. 



the projectors, independently of the supervision of the clergy of 
the Established Church, while others of the supporters of the 
academy scheme are decidedly against the voluntary principle, and 
there can be little doubt that these will form a large majority. 

It is not to be expected that an academy could supply the place 
of a parish school, although it might with advantage be joined to 
it, and, therefore, it may be anticipated, that, at no distant period, 
the heritors and feuars will be able to carry into effect their deter- 
mination to have a proper and suitable parish school, and at the 
same time avoid the expense of a litigation to ascertain their legal 
liabilities. 

At present the parochial schoolmaster has the maximum salary 
of L.34, 4s. 4d., and an allowance of L.13 for a dwelling-house 
and garden, besides participating in the Dick bequest. 

Another school is taught in the town-house, in a room afforded 
gratuitously by the feuars. This school has been denominated 
the Town's School. The present teacher received his appointment 
from the baron bailies and the feuar's managers ; and he was ap- 
pointed to teach seven poor children, for which he receives L.IO per 
annum, in terms of a bequest by the late Mr William Rhind, baker. 

There is a Lancasterian school under the superintendence of 
the clergyman of the Episcopal chapel, the master of which receives 
a salary of L. 20 per annum, from funds mortified by the late Dr 
Anderson of St Christophers. There are besides, in the town, two 
schools conducted by ladies, in which the higher branches of fe- 
male education, such as Music, French, Drawing, &amp;c. are taught 
by experienced and well qualified instructors. 

Besides these, there are six other schools in the town, and two 
in the country part of the parish, chiefly for the ordinary branches 
of education, viz. reading, writing, and arithmetic. 

The branches taught in the parish school not only embrace 
English from its lowest stages, Grammar, arithmetic, and Latin, 
but also the various subdivisions of mathematics, geography, his- 
tory, Greek, and French ; and this renders additional accommoda- 
tion the more necessary, and which, it may be expected, will, ere 

long, be obtained. 

At a former period, the schools in the town-house were con- 
ducted so as to confine each to a particular department, the pa- 
rochial schoolmaster taking the languages, and the other writmg, 
arithmetic, and mathematics. This arrangement, it is believed, 
was conducive to the interests of both, as well as to the abridge- 

4 



PETEUIIEAD. 



385 



ment of the labour of the teachers, and it may again prove advan- 
tageous, if adopted. 

The number of scholars attending the different schools through- 
out the year may probably exceed 700. 

Although the people in this parish are generally alive to the be- 
nefits of education, yet there can be no doubt that some of them 
are brought up without receiving an adequate education, and that 
ample room remains for the endowment of a charity school, where 
the poorest children might be educated at very reduced fees. 

The extreme distance from the parish school is four miles, that 
is, to the south and west of the parish. The children in these 
districts attend either the school at Boddam or the school at 
Miekle Cocklaw; and it is a question worthy of consideration, 
when the proper time arrives, whether these schools should not be 
erected into parochial schools. 

Sabbath ScJiools— There are several Sabbath schools, both in 
connection with the Established Church, and with other denomi- 
nations. These schools are numerously attended, particularly by 
females ; and they appear to have effected much good. The school 
under the superintendence of the church-session has lately been 
much extended, and is now taught within the church. There is 
also a numerous Sabbath school taught in the East or quoad sacra 
Parish Church. 

Literature. — There is no library connected with the parish 
church ; but it is understood that there are several small libraries 
belonging to the religious congregations in the town. 

Connected with the quoad sacra parish church, more particularly, 
there is a library supported by congregational subscription, consist- 
ing of 240 volumes. There is also another library, consisting of 
106 volumes, belonging to a religious instruction class, vvhich is 
taught by the pastor, and meets every Monday evening. 

The principal library in the town is that belonging to the Read- 
ing Society, instituted in 1808. This Society is managed by a 
committee of its own members elected annually. The members 
pay a yearly subscription of a guinea, and none but members are 
entitled to the use of the books. The library consists of about 
1500 volumes of standard works, embracing the Bridgewater Trea- 
tises ; the seventh, edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, now pub- 
hshing ; the Edinburgh, Quarterly, and London and Westminster 
Reviews ; the New Statistical Account of Scotland, now publish- 



 There is now a library in cnnnection with the parish church.

ing ; Sii- Waller Scott's works ; Alison's History of Europe ; the 
philosophical works of Reid and Stewart, Hume, Beattie, &amp;c. 

Another library was instituted in October 1836, under the name 
of the " Peterhead Mechanics' Library." It already contains 
upwards of 200 volumes, consisting of religious, historical, and 
scientific works. 

Scientific Association.— The only scientific society here is the 
« Peterhead Association for Science, Literature, and the Arts." 
This Society was established in 1835. At its monthly meetings 
there are occasional lectures, and the Society is in the course of 
fitting up a museum, to which various donations have already been 
made of shells, minerals, antiques, &amp;c. 

News-Room. — The news-room is supported by the annual sub- 
scription of a guinea from each of the readers. There are received 
three London daily papers, a daily shipping list, an Edinburgh 
paper thrice a week, and the Aberdeen Journal. 

Friendly Societies. — When the last Statistical Account of this • 
parish was written, there were nine friendly Societies in the town; 
subsequently several others were formed, and the greatest num- 
ber at any time was seventeen. After the passing of the Act 10 
Geo. IV. which made it imperative on Societies to remodel their 
rules, and adopt tables founded on the scheme of mutual assur- 
ances, a general panic arose among the members of nearly all these 
Societies. Few of them could be convinced of the advantages 
which the Legislature had in view by the alteration which was thus 
forced upon them, and so averse were they to adopt the scheme 
proposed, that they refused to make that inquiry into the state of 
their funds which time had rendered necessary. 

No fewer than ten friendly Societies in the town of Peterhead 
were entirely broken up in the course of a year or two, and their 
funds divided among the members. This was the more to be re- 
gretted, as the greater part, if not the whole of these Societies 
were possessed of very considerable funds, and, up to the time of 
their dissolution, had continued to pay annuities to the widows and 
children of deceased members, and to members in old age, the 
want of which, particularly among a certain class of the commu- 
nity, has since been severely felt; and although in some instances 
it m'ight have been found on investigation, that a reduction in the 
amount of annuities would have been necessary, in order to put 
all on an equal footing, and secure the stability of the institutions, 
yet, in every case the funds were in such a state that great advan-

387 



tages would have resulted from the Societies beiug kept up. An 
instance of this extraordinary spirit has recently shown itself among 
the members of the Seamen Friendly Society, formerly the 
Pilot Society. The funds of this Society amount to about L. 1 500 ; 
both the contributors and those receiving relief are comparatively 
few in number, and many of the former are in the better ranks of 
life. In the course of the present year it has been resolved to dis- 
solve this Society, and divide the funds.

members, exist in the tcnvn : —

None of these Societies have as yet availed themselves of the 
information collected and published by the Highland and Agri- 
cultural Society, and prepared tables of the rates on which the 
members ought to be admitted and contribute to the funds accord- 
ing to their ages ; although some of them adopted the means of 
ascertaining the state of their funds a few years ago, and altered 
the amount of their annuities accordingly. 

The Farmer Society has within these few years adopted a gra- 
duated scale for the admission of new members ; but it does not 
appear to have been prepared according to any correct data, nor 
with the view of the present state of the society's funds. By this 
scale each member of 25 years of age and under pays on admis- 
sion L.5. Those above 25 and under 41 years of age pay 10s. 
additional for every year their age exceeds 25 ; and those of 41 
years of age and upwards pay L. 2 for every year exceeding 40. 
When the age of a, member on admission exceeds by ten years 
that of his wife, he pays L. 2 additional of entrant dues for every 
year above ten that his wife's age is under his own. When the

difference in the age does not exceed ten years, there is no addi- 
tional payment required. , , 
Savings Bank.-h Savings Bank was estabUshed in Peterhead 
in May 1824. It has been attended with very considerable bene- 
fit to the working-classes. The treasurer and one of the directors 
attend every Tuesday night to receive deposits. The accounts 
are audited once a year, and have been found to be kept with the 
greatest accuracy. On the 9th of March 1837, there were 295 
depositors, and, including periodical interest, the sum deposited 
amounted to L.2095, 7s. 2d. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The number of persons receiving pa- 
rochial aid is from 270 to 280, and the average allowance to regular 
paupers is about 15s. per annum. The annual average amount of con- 
tributions for relief of the poor is L.252; of which from L.160 to 
L.170 arises from church collections, including the proportion of the 
collections from the East or quoad sacra Parish Church ; L.20 to 
L.25 derived from the fees for the proclamation of banns, certificates, 
registration of births, &amp;c. appropriated to that purpose by the ses- 
sion at the appointment of the present clerk ; L.22 to L.26 inte- 
rest of L.650 from 3 to 4 per cent. ; about L. 10 a year from pe- 
nalties exacted in cases of church discipline, and for the use of 
the mortcloth ; and from legacies and donations, which, of course, 
are variable, being seldom under L. 5, and more rarely exceeding 
L.50. No other mode of procuring funds for the poor has hither- 
to been adopted ; but, from the increased number of claimants 
within the last few years, arising in part from the dissolution of 
friendly societies, it is probable that some other means must soon 
be resorted to. 

Coal Fund. — This fund was established about sixteen years ago. 
It is supported by voluntary contributions made annually about the 
beginning of the year, and is managed by the representatives of 
the congregations of every religious denomination in the town. 
The managers meet together and examine the claims of all appli- 
cants, and admit such cases as they know to be fit, whether the 
parties have made application or not. 

The objects of the charity are the poor belonging to the town ; 
and it has only been in a very few instances that parties in the 
country part of the parish have been allowed to participate in the 
benefits, in consequence of particular recommendation. 

The amount of donations has varied during the last sixteen 
years from L. 53, 16s. 6d., the lowest, to L. 68, 2s., the high- 



390 



ABEKDEENSHIRE. 



est. The number of poor supplied with coals has also varied from 
287 to 342, the average number throughout the whole period 
having been 311, and the quantity of coals given to each has been 

equal to 4 cwts. 

As soon as the annual contributions are collected, the coals are 
distributed at that season of the year when the poor are in the 
greatest want of them. The whole management reflects the 
greatest credit on those who have undertaken it, it bemg con- 
ducted gratuitously, and has given great satisfaction. ■ 

The managers of the fund have received several small legacies, 
some of which they are left at liberty to apply to the purposes of 
the fund, and others are under the restriction, that only the annual 
rent shall be so applied. From the liberality of the public the 
managers have been enabled to reserve the whole amount of le- 
gacies, only applying the annual rents. These they have lent out 
on good security to the amount of L. 100, besides a small sum in 
the bank; and they intend, if circumstances permit, to act on the 
same laudable principle in regard to other legacies which may be 
left them by benevolent individuals. 

Pauper, Lunatic, and Orphan Fund.— An association was form- 
ed in 1827, under the name of the Peterhead Pauper, Lunatic, 
and Orphan Fund. It is supported by an annual collection from 
each of the congregations in the town, and by donations and be- 
quests. The objects entitled to relief from the fund are orphans 
and lunatics having a legal claim on the parish. This institution 
is managed by delegates appointed by the session and managers of 
the different churches. The present number of objects is ten lu- 
natics and ten orphans. The receipts and expenditure average 
from L. 60 to L. 80 per annum. 

This fund has been judiciously administered, and of the greatest 
advantage to the public; and has, to a considerable extent, miti- 
gated the sufferings of those for whose benefit it was established. 
It is to be regretted that more ample means have not been placed 
at the disposal of the managers.

Female Society, — This Society was instituted in 1819. Its ob- 
ject is to assist deserving poor females, who are not in the practice 
of receiving weekly charity ; but in cases of sickness this condition 
may be dispensed with. It is under the management of three 
ladies, viz. a president, treasurer, and secretary, and a committee 
of twelve ladies, all elected annually. Two of these ladies in ro- 
tation visit the poor, and distribute the charity every month. The 
number of poor receiving aid from this institution is limited to 85. 
Young widows left with children receive aid until the youngest ar- 
rives at the age of six. From L. 70 to L. 80 are annually distri- 
buted by this institution. It has fully realized the benevolent in- 
tentions of its projectors, and is well deserving of the patronage ' 
and support of the public at large, which it has hitherto received. 

Fairs. — The weekly market here is held on Fridays, and is well 
supplied with all sorts of provisions and garden stuffs. There are 
two half-yearly markets, chiefly for the feeing of servants, held re- 
spectively on the first Tuesday after Whitsunday, and the first 
Tuesday after Martinmas. These markets are of very long stand- 
ing, having been established in 1669 by authority of an act of 
Charles II. passed in that year, in favour of William Earl Maris- 
chall. 

Inns, c. — There are 46 licensed public-houses, and 28 licensed 
spirit-dealers in the town. The new inn, kept by Mr D. Fraser, 
is the principal one, where the daily coaches arrive and depart. 
The inn is large, commodious, and neatly fitted up ; and, under 
Mr Fraser's management, affords every comfort at a reasonable 
expense. Mr Fraser has a lease of the Mason Society's Cold 
Baths, and has lately added to his establishment a handsome bil- 
liard-room. 

Fuel, — About twenty or thirty years ago moss found in the 
neighbourhood was very generally used for fuel ; but this has been 
now almost superseded by coal, which is the common fuel through- 
out the town. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The improvements which have been effected in this parish since 
last Account was written are considerable. Some of these will be 
seen by the short comparative view subjoined of the state and cir- 
cumstances of the parish before the time of Dr Moir and the pre- 
sent time. This will serve a double purpose, in presenting and 
preserving a statement of the more prominent parts contained in Dr 
Moir's account relative to the then state of the parish ; while, at 



PETERHEAD. 



393 



the same time, it will exhibit, in a condensed form, and of easy re- 
ference, much of the information contained in th.s acconnt. 

Population.-ln' Moir's time, the population t own 
amounted to 2550, and in the landward part of the parish to 1141; 
oUl 3691. By the census of 1831, the popu ation m the town 
amounted to 5112, and in the landward part of the parish to 1583 
total 6695. To which add the estimated number of seamen, 1 000, 
and the probable increase since that time 315, which gives as the 

present population, 8000. . , , ■ . r i 

In Boddam, separately, there were 192 inhabitants; houses and 
families, 49. The population of Boddam is now 460 ; houses and 

families, 99. . 
The average number of births per annum was 105 ; it is now 

270. ■ . . 

The average number of deaths was 68; it is now 144. 
The average number of marriages was 28; it is now 51. 
«rMMr..-The extent of the parish is stated by Dr Moir 
to be 7000 Scots acres, of which there were under cultivation 
5000. It has been ascertained that there are 7087 Scots acres, 
or nearly so, in the parish, of which there are now cultivated 6505 
Scots acres, = 8266 imperial acres. 

Turnips and grass were only partially cultivated. Turnips and 
grass now form an essential part of the rotations of cropping fol- 
lowed here, and are very extensively cultivated. 

The arable land was interspersed with bawks or patches between 
the ridges of waste and uncultivated land. The haioks have now 
been cultivated, the land drained and partly enclosed, and laid off 
in regular fields to answer the rotations agreed upon. 

The implements of husbandry were in general very inferior. 
The ploughs formerly in use here, called Scotch ploughs, were, 
according to Dr Moir, often drawn by two horses with a cow or 
young steer. " I have even seen," he says, " a plough with on&amp; 
horse, a cow, and a young steer." The implements of husbandry 
are now greatly improved in their construction and increased m 
number, embracing all those which have been found useful in other 
districts of the country. 

There were no thrashing-machines, and but few fanners. There 
is now no farm of any importance to which there is not attached 
a thrashing-machine ; and fanners are possessed by the crofters. 

The average rent in the country part of the parish was 12s. per 
acre. Near the town it was from L. 1, 10s. to L. 4, 4s. The 



394 



ABERDEENSIIIllE. 



gross rents of land in the parish amounted to from L. 2800 to 
L. 3000. The wages of male servants were from L. 5 to L. 8 ; 
maid-servants from L. I to L. 1, 10s. The average rent of land 
in the country part of the parish is now about L. 1, 2s. ; near the 
town it is about L. 4, 10s. The rents now amount to L. 10,136, 
19s. 8d. as near as can be ascertained. The amount of servant's 
wages may be fairly stated to be at least doubled. 

The building of earthen fences cost from 2d. to 3d. per yard ; 
faced with stones, 6d. ; complete stone fences, Is. Earthen fences 
now cost from 5d. to 7d. per yard; faced with stone Is. to Is. 6d. ; 
complete stone fences, 2s. to 3s. 

Dr Moir complains that the roads were kept in bad repair ; and 
that there were no turnpike roads. Turnpike roads were made in 
1812, and other roads leading to and from the various possessions 
in the parish have been much increased in number, and are kept 
in good repair. 

Trade and Shipping, -c— The number of taverns was 30. 
There are now 46. 

The post-otfice revenue was L. 280 per annum. The post- 
office revenue has amounted to L. 817, 16s. per annum on an 
average of the last seven years. 

There were two bank agents. There are now four. 

The number of ships belonging to. this place was 26, and the 
tonnage of these 3000 tons. The number of ships is now July 
1837 85, and their tonnage 11,429 tons. 

There was one ship sent to Greenland. There are now ten 
ships employed in the whale fishing. 

There were no London traders. There are now five vessels 
regularly employed in the London trade. These find ample em- 
ployment in conveying cattle and other produce of the district to 
the English market, and supplying the merchants and traders of 
this place with goods. 

There were exported on an average of the five years from 1789 
to 1794~of beans and pease 186 bolls; of bear 1173; of oats 
771 ; total 2130. The quantity of grain exported in 1836 was 
27,164 quarters; and this is about the average amount. 

The meal exported from 1789 to 1794, on an average of the 
five years, was 9216 bolls. The meal exported in 1836 was 

14,424 bolls. , , u 1 

The harbour dues amounted to L. 94. The harbour dues 
amounted for the year ending at 1st March 1837, to L. 2879.

Manufactures.— k thread manufactory was at one time earned 
on in this place. The manufacture of thread has been disconti- 
nued, but there is reason to beUeve, that it might be again earned 

on with advantage, r . j rp. • 

Woollen cloth was rather extensively manufactured. Ihis 

business is now carried on only to a very limited extent. 

There was formerly a distillery of whisky. There is now no such 

distillery. i c i.- -i 

Fishmq.—BoM2.m and Ronheads were the only fishing vil- 
lages in the parish. The village of Boddam has been greatly 
enlarcred. The Ronheads remains the same as when the last Ac- 
count" was written. Other two villages have arisen-Buchanhaven 
and Burnhaven-at both of which the different fishings are earned 
on to a considerable extent. 

There was then no herring-fishery. This is a new and most 
extensive branch of industry, of which a short account has already 

been given. rpiu- j 

There was no light-house on this part of the coast. 1 his de- 
fect has now been remedied, and a short account of the Buchan- 
ness Light-house has also been given. 

Salmon sold at from 2d. to 24d. per lb. Salmon now sells at 
from 6d. to Is. 

The salmon exported yearly amounted to from 50 to 60 barrels. 
There are not now so many exported,— the Ugie salmon-fishing 
having fallen olf considerably. 

The rent of the Ugie salmon-fishing was L.IOO. The rent of 

it is now only L. 45. 

Stipend, -c— The stipend was 5 chalders meal, 3 chalders bear, 
and L.41, 13s. 4d. in money, and L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion 
elements. The stipend is now 18 chalders, half meal, half bar- 
ley, at the highest fiar prices for the county, and L. 20 for coiHt 
munion elements. 

The number of those receiving parochial aid was from 70 to 80. 
There are now from 270 to 280 receiving parochial aid. 

The schoolmaster's salary was 13 bolls and 2 firlots of meal, 
and L. 3, 6s. 8d. in money. The schoolmaster now enjoys the 
maximum salary of L. 34, 4s. 4id., besides what he may receive 
from the trustees of the late Mr Dick. 

The town was not supplied with spring water. The town is 
now supplied with excellent spring water, and in sufficient abun- 
dance for every purpose.

The streets were ui want of repairs. The streets are riow kept 
In good repair. Side paths with crib paving have been made — 
obstructions have been removed — and the town protected by bul- 
warks from the sea. 

The streets were not hghted in winter. They are now lighted 
with gas.

PRESBYTERY OF DEER, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. EDWARD HUME, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The name of this parish was derived from the estate 
of Lord Pitsligo, of whose lands it was originally composed, and 
signifies in Gaelic " Hollow Shell" 

Extent Sc. — This parish contains about 9 square miles, is of the 
figure of a trapezoid, and one of the most compact in Buchan. The 
extent of coast is about 4 miles. The shore on the eastern half, 
extending from the burgh of Rosehearty to the confines of the pa- 
rish of Fraserburgh, is partly sand and partly rock, loose and flat ; 
the western half, extending from Rosehearty to the confines of the 
parish of Aberdour, consists of high and bold rocks, full of fissures 
of great extent and depth. 

The parish is bounded on the north by the Moray Frith for a 
distance of four miles. It abounds in springs of the best qua- 
lity, and also in mineral springs- highly impregnated with iron. 

II. — CivjL History. 
Eminent Men. — The oriy individuals of any note connected 
wih this parish, were the celebrated Andrew Cant, and the last 
Lord Pitsligo. The former was tutor, it would appear, in the fa- 
mily of the first Lord Pitsligo about 1 630-33, and was the first 
minister of this parish after its formation in 1634. He was after- 
wards translated in 1639, to the parish of Newbattle, and thence 
to the West Church in Aberdeen, in 1641,— which cure he serv- 
ed till his death in 1663. His tombstone is to be seen in the west 
side of that churchyard. Mr Cant must have been a man of some 



PITSLIOO. 



397 



consequence during his incumbency at Pitsligo, as the church still 
retains his name, being called " Cant's Kirk" by the fishermen 
He was distinguished as a defender of the Covenant, and was said 
to be " a mortal enemy to the bishops." 

Althouc-h there are neither session nor presbytery records ot this 
date, it is° more than probable that Cant was succeeded by Mr 
Duncan Forbes, of whom mention is made in the presbytery records 
of date 8th November 1649 ; a person held in high esteem ; and, 
in August 1650, he was unanimously " nominated" minister of Fra- 
serburgh, by " the whole elders and other gentlemen and honest 
men present;" but the synod refused his "transplantation." In No- 
vember of the same year he was desired to accept a charge in Aber- 
deen ; but this matter seems to have been afterwards dropped. " In 
1651, at a visitation of Deer, this same Mr Duncan Forbes having 
preached on Mat. ii. verses 7, 8, 9, is approven by all as having 
preached powerfully to the conscience, and pertinently to the 
times." 

Wodrow, in his Church History, Vol. i. p. 329, Burns's edition, 
states, that the same Mr Duncan Forbes was one of the seven in this 
presbytery who were tyrannically cast out of their parishes after the 
Restoration of Charles II. The kirk-session record of 26th May 
1665 states, " the which day Mr Alexander Swan was ordained mi- 
nister in this parish." The presbytery record of date 170 1 alludes 
to a Mr William Swan as being incumbent in Pitsligo ; but as 
both parochial and presbyterial records are very defective about 
this period, nothing farther can be ascertained than that they 
were brothers, and Episcopal clergymen ; the latter of whom 
was deposed in 1716, with several others, for their nonjuring prin- 
ciples and irregular conduct. 

The last Lord Pitsligo wrote a small work entitled " Thoughts 
concerning Man's Duties in this Life, and his Hopes in the world to 
come ;" prefixed to a late edition of which is an interesting biographi- 
cal sketch of his Lordship by LordMedwyn. Alexander, fourth Lord 
Forbes of Pitsligo, the only son, succeeded his father in 1691, took 
the oaths and his seat in Parliament 24th May 1700 ; adhered to 
the Duke, of Athole's protest against the Union, 25th December 
1705; and did not attend the Parliament in 1706-7, when that 
treaty was settled. He engaged in the Rebellion in 1715; but 
no notice seems to have been taken of his defection. He publish- 
ed, in 1734, essays, moral and philosophical ; engaged in the Re- 
bellion 1745, after the battle of Preston, and, being considered 



398 



ABERDEENSHIRE. 



by his neighbours as a very prudent man, his example drew many 
into the same course. He was attainted by the title of Lord Pit- 
sligo, and his honours and estate were forfeited. He claimed his 
estate before the Court of Session on account of the misnomer, 
his true title being Lord Forbes of Pitsligo, and that court gave 
judgment in his favour, 16th November 1749. But on an appeal 
it was reversed by the House of Lords, on 1st February 1750. 
He died at Auchiries, in Aberdeenshire, on 21st December 1762. 

La7id-oivners.— The only heritors are. Sir John Stuart Forbes, 
Bart. ; John Dulf Dingwall, Esq. of Brucklaw and Corsindae ; 
and Lord Saltoun. 

Parochial Registers. — The earliest date of the parochial register 
is 1676: it contains an account of session matters only. From 
1720 the entries are more regular. No register of deaths was ever 
kept, and that of births is very irregularly kept. 

Antiquities. — The only ruins of any note in this parish are the 
Castles of Pitshgo and Pittulie, both situated on the property of 
Sir John S. Forbes, and overlooking the sea. The former had 
evidently been a strongly built castle, the walls being from six to 
seven feet thick, and probably reared nearly three centuries ago. 
The ground around is planted with young wood, and the garden 
still yields some of the finest fruit to be found in the county. The 
latter castle, it is supposed, must have been built by the Saltoun 
family, as their coat of arms, carved in stone, is still legible on the 
original part of the building : it was, however, afterwards enlarged 
by the Cummings, in whose possession the property long was.; 

HL — Population. 
The ancient state of the population cannot be accurately traced.

The increase may be ascribed, in a great measure, to the more 
extensive prosecution of the fishing trade, especially the herring- 
fishing, which, until thirty years ago, had never been attempted on 
this coast. In the landward part of the parish, the population for 
some time back has rather decreased, in consequence of many

Rosehearty is a burgh of barony, created by Royal charter, of 
date 13th July 1681 ; of which John Duff Dingwall, Esq. of Bruck - 
law and Corsindae is superior. It contains about 600 souls. 
It has a weekly market on Saturday, with a regular post-office and 
daily runner to Fraserburgh. The revenue of its harbour amounts 
to about L.70 per annum. 

There is erecting at Sandhaven, the most easterly point of the 
parish, by Sir John S. Forbes, Bart, of Pitsligo, and the Fishery 
Board, a new fishing harbour, which, it is considered, will be of 
great benefit to this coast. The fishing village of Pittulie, on the 
property of Sir John S. Forbes, Bart., lies a quarter of a mile 
north-west of Sandhaven. It contains about 200 souls. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture.— The agriculture of this parish stood long in a 
backward state, compared with the husbandry of the south of Scot- 
land ; but since the conclusion of the American war in 1782, im- 
provement has proceeded with singular rapidity ; and while the 
rent-rolls of proprietors have been much augmented, the circum- 
stances of the tenantry have been anieliorated in a proportional 
degree. Almost the whole of this parish is enclosed by substantial 
stone dikes, and there is ample material for enclosing the remainder, 
which is progressing rapidly. 

The late Sir William Forbes, grandfather to the present Sir 
John S. Forbes, set the first example in this respect, not only by 
enclosing many fields on his own estate at his own expense, but by 
introducing a clause in the general articles of his estate, — " that 
all his tenants should be entitled to payment of sixpence per ell 
of stone dike as soon as an enclosure was completed, the remain- 
der of the value to be paid at the expiry of the lease." The con- 



400 



ABERDEENSHIRE. 



sequelice is, tliat nearly the whole of his valuable property in this 
parish is now well fenced. 

The other proprietors in the parish soon followed the example, 
and gave liberal encouragement to their tenants in regard to en- 
closing and building houses. 

The number of acres, standard imperial measure, in this parish, which have been cul- 
tivated or occasionally in tillage is - - - - 3920 

susceptible of improvement, _ _ - 200 

in roads, houses, &amp;c. ... - 280 

Total acres, - 4400 

The commons were divided about twenty-five years ago. 

Planting. — The parish is very destitute of wood, having only 
about eighteen acres of planting, chiefly belonging to Sir John 
S. Forbes. The late Sir William planted most of it. Ash, 
elm, and larch seem to be the only wood congenial to this soil 
and climate. The first great difficulty in rearing of wood in 
this part of Buchan, is to get a barrier against the prevailing north- 
erly gales, which have a blighting, withering influence ; that diffi- 
culty once overcome, neither the chmate nor soil seems to be ad- 
verse to the growth of hard-wood. 

Of the eighteen acres of planting alluded to, eight only are 
worthy of notice, the other eight being scattered, neglected, and 
exposed to the storms. The eight thriving acres are in one en- 
closure, not far from the church, and every attention is paid yearly 
to thinning, pruning, &amp;c. 

Eent The average rent of the arable land is about 19s. 6d. 

per acre ; while the pasture or unimproved land is scarcely worth 
any thing in its present state, which can only be reclaimed by 
draining and trenching, at an expense of not less than from L. 8 
to L. 12 per acre. 

The great obstacles to the improvement of low-lying land is the 
wantof leading water runs, particularly in marshes, or wherever there 
is a strong current; an improvement which ought to be effected at 
the proprietor's expense. It would enable the farmer to drain and 
prevent damage from inundation. 

Wages.— The winter wages of good ploughmen are fi-om L.5 
to L.6, 10s. ; foremen and very superior servants realize a little 
more; boys and other supernumeraries, from L.l, IDs. to L.4. 
In the summer half-year, men's wages generally advance from 
5s. to 10s., and again retrograde in the winter half-year. Wo- 
men's wages range from L. 2 to L. 3 in the summer half-year, 
and from L. 1, 10s. to L. 2 in the winter half-year, according

to their character in the country. Labourers get Is. per day ni 
summer with victuals, and Is. Gd. without victuals. In wmter, la- 
bourers' wao-es may be stated at from 8d. to lOd., with two meals 
p r day ; but they are generally very ill employed durmg the vn- 
Lr months. Squire Wrights, who work by the day, charge s. 6d. 
lith victuals; masons, 2s. 6d. to 3s. per day without victuals; 

slaters the same. , „ 

Live-Stock.-'Nhat is called the pure Aberdeenshire breed ot 
cattle has been propagated in this parish from time immemorial. 
About five years ago, a few farmers joined and introduced a short- 
horned bull. The crosses with the Buchan cows have given every 
satisfaction. The cross breeds, which have been fed at the same 
stall from the birth with Buchan stock, have generally realized 
more money at the end of the third year. The pure Here ord 
cattle were introduced to this parish two years ago. 1 he yearling 
crosses promise well, but nothing decided can as yet be said about 
them. The farmer's object now is to procure a breed of cattle, 
unitino- early maturity with propensity to fatten. 

The xeneral system of farming here is alternate cropping, either 
upon a five or seVen-shift. The fifth shift is adhered to in small 
possessions, while the seven shift is more common on the large 
farms The fifth shift is, 1. turnips or potatoes ; 2. barley or oats 
with grass seeds ; 3. hay ; 4. grass ; 5. oats. The seventh shift 
is, 1. turnips or potatoes; 2. barley or oats with grass seeds; 3. 
hay ; 4. pasture ; 5. pasture ; 6. oats ; 7. oats. 

Soils.— The parish has a diversity of soils, viz. clay or loam, light 
black soil and moss : these are so interspersed, that almost every 
farm has a share of each, the light soils being at least in the propor- 
tion of four to one. 

Mariure.— The farmers on the sea coast have the advantage of the 
drift sea-ware, which enables them not only to top-dress their leas, 
but to have a crop of barley instead of oats, on what is here pro- 
vincially called yavil, or the second crop after grass. Farmers two 
or three miles from the sea shore have a substitute for sea-ware 
in the article of herring refuse, which is to be found at Fraser- 
burgh and Rosehearty. It is mixed up with earth, and has a won- 
derful effect. As much may be had for L. 1 as will completely 
top-dress an acre. Farmers still farther removed from the coast 
make use of bone-dust for the additional manure they require. 

Leases.— The common duration of leases is nineteen years. Far- 
mers complain that proprietors do not inform them, two years before 

ABERDEEN. C C

the lease expires, whether or not they will renew it. This is of more 
consequence to the tenants than the proprietors are aware of. 

Practical farmers agree that the average crop of the whole pa- 
rish does not exceed three and a half quarters per acre of oats and 
barley. Wheat husbandry does not suit the climate. As near as 
can be ascertained, the quantity of ground planted with potatoes 
in this parish is 120 acres. The crop is supposed to average twen- 
ty bolls of 5 cwt. per acre ; perhaps from 1000 to 1200 bolls are 
annually exported to Yorkshire for seed. Reds are principally 
planted. Kidneys have gone into disuse. 

Manufactures.— The only article manufactured in the parish is 
kelp ; which, however, of late years, has been little attended to. A 
little'is still made on the property of Sir John S. Forbes, more for 
the purpose of giving people employment than for realizing a profit. 
Twenty or thirty years ago, it was an article of considerable im- 
portance, giving employment to upwards of seventy people. The 
quantity made in 1838 was only twenty tons. Twenty or thirty 
years ago, the quantity made was generally about 140 tons. 
When the duty was taken off Spanish barilla, a.severeblow was in- 
flicted upon the labouring classes throughout Scotland, engaged 
in the kelp manufacture. 

Machinery is superseding manual labour, wherever it can be 
introduced with propriety. Fourteen thrashing-mills are now m 
this parish ; six are propelled by water ; seven by horses ; and one 
bv wind. A sowing machine has also been tried this season, and 

much approved of. , 

Fisheries.— This parish has two good fishing stations, viz. Kose- 
hearty, which has a very good harbour for vessels not exceeding 
70 tons burden ; and Pittulie. At Rosehearty a considerable her- 
ring fishery is carried on, commencing about the middle of July, 
and ending about the first of September. In 1838, forty boats 
here prosecuted the herring-fishing with success equal to that 
of any other place in the Moray Frith ; each boat manned with five 
„:,en or four men and a boy, and seven vessels were constantly 
employed attending the fishing. Three vessels belong to this 
port The fish caught at Rosehearty and Pittulie are cod, ling, had- 
docks, skate, and small black fish, commonly called cole, saith, and 
poddlies. Thesurplusis generally exported to London, Edmburgh, 
and Glasgow. Several of the Rosehearty herring-boats set out 
about the first of March, to prosecute the cod and ling fishing off 
the Island of Tvree : they carry the produce of their fishing to 



PITSLIGO.

Glasgow and return home before the comiiiencenient of the her- 
ringfishing, bringing along with them a cargo of coals 

The rocky shore of Pitsligo does not supply the whole quantity 
of bait required by the fishermen ; but the deficiency is made up 
by what is procured from Tain, Dundee, or elsewhere along the 
coast. The fishermen in Rosehearty pay the superior of the burgh, 
John Duff Dingwall, Esq. of Brucklaw and Corsindae, L. 1 per 
man for the privilege of landing their fish, gathering bait and bed- 
dincr their muscles. At Pittulie the fishermen pay L. 1, 5s. for 

to 

the same privileges. 

"V. — Parochial Economy. 

Means of Communication.— The parish is intersected in the 
centre by the Old Banff road and the Strichen road, the former 
running from east to west from Fraserburgh to Banff, the latter 
from north to South, leading from Rosehearty to Strichen, which 
divide the parish into four nearly equal parts. The parish is 
otherwise well accommodated with roads ; and a turnpike line lead- 
ing from Fraserburgh to Banff winds its way through the south- 
east corner, skirting as it were about two miles and a half of its 
boundary, and is of great importance to that side of the parish. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church stands in the very 
centre of the parish, where the Strichen and old Banff roads in- 
tersect each other. It was built in the year 1 634, and is at pre- 
sent in good repair, having been lately tastefully embellished. 
The church spire, and the carved work in the aisle, are much 
admired. 

The land north of the church slopes to the sea, in a fall of 
about 300 feet, from which circumstance the church is seen at 
a great distance, and hence it is sometimes called " The Vi- 
sible Kirk," as well as « Cant's Kirk," from the distinguished 
• individual of that name who was the first minister, and whose 
likeness, carved in stone, with his initials, is seen on the east 
end, outside. The church is said to be seated for 504, but 
it will hold, including the aisle, when crowded closely together, 
fully 600. The number of communicants on the parish roll is 
550, and at all times the church is well attended. The manse was 
built about seventy years ago, and was last repaired in 1836. The 
glebe extends to about 10 acres, exclusive of the garden and ground 
in front of the manse, and if let would rent probably about L. 18 
per annum, being enclosed. The stipend is paid partly in money, 



404 



ABERDEENSHIRE. 



«ncl partly in kind, viz. in money, L. 170, with 21 bolls of barley, 
and 38 bolls of meal. The Crown is patron. 

There is only one Dissenting chapel in this parish which is in con- 
nection with the United Associate Synod. The stipend is paid from 
seat-rents, collections, and partly from the Congregational Union 
Fund, and amounts to about L. 80 per annum. The number of 
Dissenters in the parish is 205, viz. 161 Seceders and Independ- 
ents, 34 Episcopalians, 1 Baptist, and I Roman Catholic. 

On the 19th February 1717, Mr John Forbes was ordained 
Presbyterian clergyman at Pitsligo, first after the Revolution ; but 
two years afterwards, he was translated to Old Deer. On the 22d 
September 1720, Mr William Mercer was ordained minister. On 
the 4th May 1768, Mr David Stephenson was ordained minister: 
he died in January 1786. On September 21, 1786, Mr James 
Greig was ordained : he died on 15th October t803. On the 
13th June 1804, Mr Alexander Farquhar was admitted: he died 
26th March 1834; and on 25th September 1834, the present in- 
cumbent was admitted. 

Education. — The school-house lately underwent a thorough re- 
pair, and the school-room, erected last year, at an expense of.no 
less a sum than L.300, is of excellent workmanship, and much ad- 
mired. It is seated to hold about 120 scholars, and it can be en- 
larged without inconvenience to hold 150. The design was fur- 
nished by Mr Smith, architect in Aberdeen. 

There are six schools in this parish besides the parochial, — 
five of which are taught by females : two of the females have 
small salaries from the proprietors on whose properties they are 
situated. The pupils attending each of these six schools average 
about 30. The branches taught, are English reading and writing.. 

The branches taught at the parochial school are, English read- 
ing and grammar, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, practical ma- 
thematics, bv which term is meant mensuration of surfaces and 
solids, &amp;c. geography ; — Latin and Greek when called for, which, 
however, seldom happens,— together with the elements of religious 
knowledge. The salary amounts to L. 34, 4s. 4id. with an allow- 
ance of L. 2 for a garden. Amount of fees in 1835-6, paid and 
unpaid included, L. 35, 2s. 2d. The teacher has the legal accom- 
modation. 

There are few, if any persons, in the parish who cannot read 
and write. None of the families are too distant from the parish 
school ; and no child capable of going to school need be absent

<p>
PRESBYTERY OF ALFORD, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. JAMES REID, A. M. MINISTER. 

THE REV. WILLIAM REID, A.M. Assistant and Successor. 



1. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, c. — The parishes of Auchindoir and Kearn were united 
by the annexation of Kearn to Auchindoir in 1 8 1 1 . Previous to this 
period Kearn was in union with Forbes ; but circumstances of local 
conveniency having led to a disjunction of these parishes, Forbes 
was united to Tullynessle, and Kearn annexed to Auchindoir. 
The name Auchindoir, by which both these parishes are now 
usually designated, is of Gaelic origin, and is said to signify the 
" field of pursuit." This derivation is supported by the historical 
fact mentioned by Buchanan, that " Luthlac, son of Macbeth,, 
was slain by Malcolm in the valley of Bogie." Tradition refers 
to several tumuli on an extensive moor now improved, about two 
miles south of the » church, as the scene of battle where Luthlac 
was defeated, and also points out the spot, about four miles north- 
east from this, in the parish of Rhynie, where he was overtaken 
and slain. The circumstance of his being pursued through the 
valley of Auchindoir to the place of his death, may have given rise 
to its present appellation. Kearn is understood to be a corruption 
of cairn, there being a remarkable cairn or tumulus in that pa- 
rish ; but of the history of which there is no tradition. 

Extent, 4-c.— These united parishes form an irregular figure, the 
length of which is about 7 miles, and the breadth about the same 
extent. They are bounded by Kildrummy on the south ; Rhynie 
on the north ; Cabrach on the west; and Clatt and Tulleynessle

'"r-The climate of Auchindoir and Kearn is, on the 
wh" brious. The heights, indeed, are cold a-d axposedj 
but the lower grounds in both parishes are m.ld, sheltered and 
d The distLe from the sea, not less in an, part than thirty 
mllesl and the interception of the easterly winds, by fre- 
lent ranges of hills, exclude those vapours, which bestow, too 
ru , the character of dampness, on the climate of the west 
coast of Scotland. On the other hand, the westerly winds are 
Xn boisterous and stormy, and the frosts somewhat early, and 
frequently severe. Snow falls in abundance, and sometimes 1, s 
lon» • still the climate of these parishes ma, be denominated heal- 
th,: 'at least if longevit, be the best crilerion,-of which there.are 

many unquestionable instances. , ■ j- . • . ov 

Hydrography.-The quality of the water in this distnct is ex- 
cellent, and its quantity sufficient for all the necessary purposes of 
human life and industry. There are no medicinal springs, Foperly 
so termed, although there are various rills tamted with u-on; but nei- 
ther their strength nor virtues are such cas to merit particular notice. 
The burns of Craig and Corchinan, which unite and form the 
Bogie near to the Manse, take their rise in, and for a considerable 
space run through, mossy ground, from which they derive a strong 



408

antiseptic quality, the effects of which have been frequently ascer- 
tamed. This is particularly obvious in the preservation the report- 
er may almost say the partial restoration to firmness of salt water 
fish brought from a distance, and deposited, in wicker baskets, under 
the running stream for twenty-four or forty-eight hours after their 
arrival. It may be mentioned, however, as somewhat singular, that 
this effect is not perceptible on what are usually termed flat fish. 
The Bogie is a beautiful little river, meandering through a fine valley 
until it joins the Doveron at Huntly, about eleven miles from its for- 
mation. The Burn of Craig, its original principal constituent, is ra- 
pid and impetuous. The course of this brook, from its source to its 
junction with the sister stream at the commencement of the Bogie, 
is not more than five miles; but it presents all the characteristics of 
a mountain torrent, suddenly rising to a great height, and as 
quickly falling to its ordinary level. In passing through the Den 
of Craig it forms several beautiful cascades ; one in particular is 
very fine, where it is seen leaping from rock to rock in a zig-zag 
direction, and finally dashing down a precipice of considerable alti- 
tude. The scenery here is of a romantic description. It may be far- 
ther mentioned that at this place, in the ftir-famed flood of 1829, the 
burn was proved by measurement to have risen 18 feet perpendicu- 
larly. The only other rivers connected with this parish are the Don 
and Mossat. The Don forms its boundary for about two miles on 
the south-east, after receiving the Mossat, a small stream which 
divides it from Kildrummy on the south. 

Geology, ic. — Freestone of a very fine quality abounds in 
one particular stratum in this parish. It first presents itself in 
the adjacent parish of Kildrummy on the south, then passes 
through Auchindoir, and reaches the confines of Rhynie on the 
north, where it dips and disappears. The common whin or 
moorstone is also found in huge blocks and immense quantity 
on the estate of Craig. Limestone is to be had both on the es- 
tates of Clova and Craig, but its purity is not remarkable, and at 
any rate, the distance even from imported coal is so very great, 
that it has not been found expedient to work the quarries to any 
noticeable extent. The asbestos is also found on Mr Gordon's 
estate; but in one place only, a ravine in the bosom of a moun- 
tain, and in no great quantities. There are also serpentine, 
mica-slate, and a coarse laminated marble, in the hills of Tow- 
en reef and Correen. On the estate of Druminnor there has 
i{itely been discovered a rather singular quarry, afl'ording a hard

and heavy stone, somewhat resembhng granite in external ap- . 
pearance, but unlike granite susceptible of being split into slabs 
of o-reat thinness, and of alnaosf.any length or breadth. These form 
excellent pavements for footpaths around farm offices, or for the 
floors of kitchens or cellars. The soil of these parishes is various ; 
towards the hills mossy and poor; but in the lower grounds sharp, 
dry, and productive. Where the upper soil is incumbent upon free- 
stone, it presents a rich fertile alluvial loam. Clay is found in many 
places, sometimes in a pure state, but for the most part mixed with 
sand and small stones, in different stages of decomposition. In the 
mosses, which are extensive, in the western quarter especially, there 
is plenty of peat of an excellent quality, and in these mosses 
there are not unfrequently found the remains of imbedded trees 
of considerable size, chiefly firs, and sometimes oaks and alders. 

Zoploffi/.— These parishes afford roe-deer, grouse, partridges, 
snipes, and woodcocks ; hares and rabbits. Blackcock and ptar- 
migan are sometimes seen. There are also foxes, polecats, wea- 
sels, and occasionally badgers ; hawks, wild pigeons, and singing 
birds of all the varieties known in the north of Scotland. The 
breed of cattle is mostly the pure Aberdeenshire ; of sheep the 
Scotch black-faced and Cheviot kinds. The insects most common- 
ly injurious are the wasp and caterpillar. The former are usually 
destroyed, by cutting the nest at night and letting it drop into hot 
water, or by blowing it to pieces by a large charge of gunpowder. 
The latter are never effectually removed but by regular hand-pick- 



ing-

Botany. — The writer of this article is not aware of any of the 
rarer plants having been found in these parishes ; but he has reason 
to affirm that the mountains of Auchindoir and Kearn, and the 
plantations and glens within their bounds, contain all the Scottish 
varieties that are usually met with. 

The plantations are extensive. On Mr Leith Lumsden's pro- 
perty of Clova, there are several plantations of thriving Scots fir 
and larch, and there remain a few specimens of the former 
tree in a comparatively low situation, of which the size is large, 
and the quality understood to be good. On Mr Grant's es- 
tate of Druminnor there are also promising plantations, though 
of a lesser age; and in that part of the parish which belongs 
to the Honourable Walter Forbes of Brux, there are similar 
young woods. Mr Forbes has planted over a very wide sur- 
face, but mostly in the adjoining parishes, which do not fall

within the present report. The most noticeable plantations in 
this district belong to Mr Gordon of Craig, because these and 
especially the romantic Den already alluded to exhibit forest 
trees and hard-wood of considerable variety, and demonstrate how 
much may be done, by care and perseverance, in the rearing 
of valuable wood, even under the opposing obstacles to be met 
with in a highly elevated country. Of the sorts which have been 
successfully cultivated at Craig, the beech, the oak, the ash 
and elm, the chestnut, the lime, the sycamore, the silver-fir, 
the black spruce, and the larch, are conspicuous. Mr Gor- 
don affirms that, next to first nursing, the whole art of raising 
wood consists in thinninff ; that wherever forest trees or any 
sorts of trees are raised either for cutting or for decoration, it is 
in vain to expect success unless a steady, regular, and unsparing 
coui-se of thinning is maintained. It is this which enables the 
ground to bring to maturity a certain number of plants ; it is 
this which alone contributes to the indispensable admission of light, 
and the free circulation of air ; and it is the neglect of this prac- 
tice which exhibits in many plantations, which otherwise would 
have been valuable, stunted and unhealthy trees, covered with 
moss, disfigured in appearance and ruined in value. The conge- 
niality of the soil in this district is decidedly in favour of the larch 
in thin dry land ; and of beech, oak, ash, elm, and lime, in richer 
situations. The pinaster, the Weymouth pine, the balsam or balm 
of Gilead fir, and the holly, do not succeed here. In all the planta- 
tions in this part of the country, three facts are observable, 1. that 
the portion which fronts the north thrives the best, at least in the ear- 
lier stages of growth ; 2. that trees planted on sloping banks prosper 
better than those on a flat ; and 3. that trees of different sorts in- 
termixed, succeed better than when masses of the same descrip- 
tion are planted together. If there be any exception to the last rule, 
it is in the case of the oak. 

There are few trees of remarkable age, size, or figure in these 
parishes, if we except two yenerable sycamores near to Mr Grant's 
house of Druminnor, and a few old ashes round the garden at 
Craig ; one of these of large stem, and of which the tradition is 
that it' was planted in 1688, showed evident symptoms of decay 
about fifteen years ago, the tops fading and the trunk spoiling in the 
heart. To save it if possible, the proprietor pollarded the tops, 
and caused the opening in the stem to be carefullj covered over 
with sheet lead, in order to exclude the rains. The consequence has 
been that this ancient tree is again in vigour. 



AUCHINDOIU AND KEARN. 



11. — Civir, History. 

Eminent Men. — One may be mentioned, whose talents, learn- 
ing, and accomplishments seem to have been considerable, from 
the terms addressed to him, in a Latin poem of great power and 
beauty, by Dr Arthur Johnstone in his " Parerga," published in 
1642. This was John Gordon of Craig, born in 1607, the seven- 
teenth in descent from the principal stem of the family of Gor- 
don, — a man who appears to have been held in great estimation 
at the Court of James VI. 

Antiquities. — The prominent objects of antiquity are the old 
parish church, the moat or mount on which the ancient Castruvi 
Auchindorice, mentioned by Boethius, seems to have stood, and the 
houses of Craig and Druminnor. The old church, now a ruin, is 
extremely venerable, and every justice is done to its ivy-mantled 
walls, by the proprietor on whose estate it stands, in order to exhibit 
this impressive object with effect. The fine Saxon gateway or prin- 
cipal door ; the carved representation of our Saviour on the cross, 
with the letters j. n. r. j. ; the recess for the elements, &amp;c. with the 
inscription immediately over it, Hie e. corp. d. n. j. c. v. m., Hie 
est corpus Domini nostri Jesu Christi, Virginia Mariae ; the stone 
vessel at the entrance for the holy water, &amp;c. are the clearest in- 
dications of its once having been a Roman Catholic Chapel, though 
at what precise period it was converted into the Presbyterian pa- 
rish church cannot be ascertained. The oldest date is on the 
north gable, and bears 1557. 

The Houses of Craig and Druminnor, still habitable even in 
their more ancient portions are of considerable antiquity, and ex- 
hibit many of the characteristics of remote times ; the oldest date- 
at Craig is 1518 ; that at Druminnor which was the ancient Cas- 
tle Forbes, once the chief seat of the Forbes family, is 1577. Of 
modern buildings it seems unnecessary to say any thing farther 
than that on all the principal properties, the owners have, by mo- 
dern erections or additions, given comfort and embellishment to- 
their several residences. The proprietors are five in number; Mr 
Leith Lumsden of Clova ; Mr Gordon . of Craig; Mr Grant of 
Druminnor; the Honourable Walter Forbes of Brux now Mas- 
ter of Forbes ; and Mr Gordon of Wardhouse. The three first 
named are the principal heritors ; and reside either wholly or for 
a considerable portion of the year within the parish.

Within these few years there has sprung up a village in the pa- 
rish, named Lumsden, of which the population at this time is 243. 
The creation of this village has led to the sudden increase of the 
population, by attracting individuals, who resort to it from all parts 
of the country. At present there is something of a counterba- 
lancing decrease in the population, by the disposition to emigrate, 
which for two seasons has prevailed, especially among the young 
men. 

IV. — Industry. 

These parishes have never been entirely surveyed, and, conse- 
quently, their precise arable extent cannot be stated ; but it is pro- 
gressive both in measure and in manner ; both in the reclaiming 
of land heretofore barren, and in an improved style of operation. 
The appearance, comfort, and substantiahty of the houses and 
cottages are much improved within the last twenty years. 

Leases.— The usual duration of the leases on good farms is 
nineteen years ; on farms more pastoral than in tillage, seven, 
nine, and eleven years. 

The people are almost all employed in agriculture and the 
rearing of cattle. In Lumsden village there are a few traders 
and handicraftsmen ; and blacksmiths, carpenters, masons, and 
tailors, are distributed through the different estates ; but the mass 
of the population is agricultural, and the people are sober, frugal, 
and industrious in their habits. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Town. — The nearest market-town, with the exception 
of the village of Rhynie, is Huntly, distant at an average twelve 
miles. The road is turnpike, and excellent from the church on- 
wards. This turnpike runs in whole about seven miles through 
the parish. There is a stage-coach which passes through the pa- 
rish to and from Aberdeen on every alternate day. 



AUCHINDOIU AND KEAUN. 



413 



The only village in the parish is Lumsden, already mentioned. 
The reporter can hardly say that it is as yet marked by the more 
striking features of great prosperity. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church is, on the whole, not 
inconveniently situated. It was built in 1811, and its only fault 
is that it is too small for the existing population. It contains ac- 
commodation for 450 sitters only. There are in these parishes 
10 individuals belonging to the United Secession ; 8 Indepen- 
dents; and two Roman Catholics. The members, also, of one 
family of the resident heritors are Episcopalians ; but the mem- 
bers of this family regularly attend the parish church, there being 
no Episcopal place of worship in the neighbourhood. 

The present incumbents of the parishes under notice are, the 
Rev. James Reid, and the Rev. William Re.id, assistant and suc- 
cessor. The former of these clergymen was inducted in 1785, 
and the latter in 1834. The manse was built in 1764 : it is in- 
commodious, and in very bad repair. The stipend of the united 
parishes is L. 160. The proper glebe of Auchindoir is 8 acres 
in extent; and a compensation or excambion for the glebe of For- 
bes affords a rent of L. 8, 2s. 6d. 

Ediication. — There is only one parochial school for both pa-- 
rishes, with two or three unendowed schools. The schoolmaster's 
salary is L. 30 ; the average amount of school-fees, L. 21. He 
has theiegal accommodations. The branches of education taught 
at the parochial school are, Latin, English, mathematics, geo- 
graphy, arithmetic, and writing. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of poor per-, 
sons receiving parochial aid is 22. The annual amount of parish 
church collections for their relief is about L. 32, with about L. 14 
additional from two mortifications and other sources. The whole 
of this is divided among them, and, small as it is, yet it seems 
sufficient for supplying their necessities. There is a manifest re- 
luctance on their part to be indebted to parochial relief, which 
leads to industry and economy. For many years, there has been 
no strolling beggar belonging to these parishes. 

Fairs. — Four cattle markets are held in the parish during the 
year. 

Inns. — There are one inn and three ale-houses. The latter 
cannot be described as a blessing. 

Fuel. — The fuel in general use is peat. Coal is extremely ex- 
pensive. The carriage of it from the coast is more costly than the 



414 ABEllDEICNSHIUE. 

article itself on the shore : and even if sent for by private carts, 
the loss of time and labour, together with expenses for men and 
horses, raises the price of this best description of all fuel, to a very 
heavy amount. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The most prominent variation between the present state of 
these united parishes, and their condition at the date of the former 
Statistical Report, arises from the improved state of husbandry ; 
the tillage of waste land ; the superior style of cultivation ; and 
the adoption of many of those advantageous changes, both in 
cropping and in the implements of husbandry, which have been 
equally recommended by the precept and example of eminent agri- 
culturists. 

Next in order may be mentioned the less essential, but cer- 
tainly not the unimportant improvements in cleanliness, dress, and 
modes of living. The becoming regularity, decency, and atten- 
tion of the attendants in the parish church of Auchindoir could 
not have been improved ; it has always been noticeable, praise- 
worthy, and exemplary. 

The most crying evil here was the overwhelming concourse of 
travelling beggars, to whom a mistaken liberality afforded the temp- 
tation to come among us, but whose visitations were in many ways 
prejudicial to the parishioners. This burden was considerably les- 
sened about two years ago, by a general resolution not to give alms 
of any sort to stranger lieggars, but to confine our parochial chari- 
ty to our parochial poor ; and the recent institution of a rural po- 
lice has added to our security and protection. 

The mischiefs of absenteeism are luckily little felt in these pa- 
rishes The presence of certain heritors for the greater part of 
the year affords, in the first place, the facilities of the magistracy, 
and what is of not less moment, it sets an example in the way of 
improvements; it leads to the employment of tradesmen, to the 
extension of charities, and to the reciprocities of kindness and 
confidence between dissimilar ranks.

<p>

PRESBYTERY OF ALFORD, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. ADAM SMITH, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

JSfame. — The name of this parish is derived from the Gaehc word 
Twaic/A, signifying northjornorth-lyingland, — probably in reference 
to the district by which it is bounded on the south, namely, Cro- 
mar. The ancient name was Kilbartha, or Bartha's cell or chui'ch. 
The parish is now known by the name of Towie Kinbattoch, — 
the latter being from Khan, signifying the head, and Battoch, grove ; 
and in the cess-books of the county it is denominated Totoie Brux, 
having at one period belonged principally to the family of Forbes 
of Brux, in whom the patronage was long vested. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish is of an irregular figure. 
The extreme length from north to south is about 10 miles, and from 
east to west about 5. The medium inhabited length is about 4, 
and the breadth 2 English miles. It is bounded on the south, by 
Tarland and Migvie ; on the west, by Migvie and Strathdon ; on 
the north, by the Cabrach ; on the north-east, by Kildrummy ; and 
on the east, by Cushnie. 

Topographical Appearances. — The parish is almost surrounded 
by hills ; those on the south-east, called the Soccoch, are about 
2000 feet high. They were said by Gilderoy and his Katterin, 
who made frequent predatory visits to this quarter, to be the cold- 
est they ever lodged amongst. The surface of the hills is unbroken, 
undulating, and covered with short heath. There is no level arable 
land, excepting the haughs on the banks of the river ; and on some 
farms, the land is very steep, and consequently causes an extra 
expense of time and strength in the tillage. The river Don divides 
the parish into two nearly equal parts ; it makes several beautiful 
serpentine bends, as it winds its course through Towie ; but as the 
current is rather rapid, and the channel gravelly, it is very apt to 
cut the banks and shift its course. The aspect of the parish, par- 
ticularly towards the south, is rather bare and bleak, having little 



416 



ABERDEKNSHIRE. 



or no wood to relieve the eye, except in the north-western quar- 
ter. 

Soil — The soil is a light friable loam with a gravelly subsoil ; 
and in a very few instances the soil is clayey, with a hard retentive 
subsoil ; but in general, there is no great depth of soil. 

Hydrography. — The Don, as already noticed, flows through the 
parish, and is the only river in it. The stream or water of Descry 
bounds the parish for about a mile on the west ; it flows al- 
most due north, and then bends away toward the north-west, 
and empties itself into the Don. In the north-western quar- 
ter, the water or burn of Kindie separates Towie from Strath- 
don, and flows in a south-west direction till it meets the Don. 
There are three or four smaller streamlets, which rise in the south 
and south-east quarters of the parish, and flow all in nearly a north- 
eastern direction to the Don,— one of which, called the burn of 
Towie, has a course of upwards of two miles, through a beautiful, 
secluded, and deep ravine. 

Springs.— The parish is generally well supplied with springs of 
excellent water. There are also some mineral springs ; but as they 
have never been analyzed, an account of their properties cannot 
be given. 

Geology and Mineralogy.— Limestone of a very hard and inferior 
quality has been occasionally wrought in diff"erent localities, for 
agricultural purposes. Granite rock is known only in one place, 
where, however, it is surrounded by plantations. There are 
pretty certain indications of freestone about a quarter of a mile 
south from the church ; but, being in a low wet situation, it is 
doubtful whether a quarry could be profitably opened. On the 
farm of Glencui, too, there are indications of serpentine, although 
it has never been employed for any useful or ornamental purpose. 

11. — Civil History. 

Eminent Men.— The most distinguished individual connected 
by birth with this parish is the Rev. Duncan Mearns, D.D., Pro- 
fessor of Divinity, King's College, Old Aberdeen. 

Land-oioners.—T\\e land-owners are, Harry Leith Lumsden, 
Esq of Auchindoir; John David Gordon, Esq. of Wardhouse; 
Sir Alexander Leith, K.C.B. of Freefield; the Hon. tie Master 
of Forbes; Sir Charles Forbes, Bart, of Newe and Edinglassie; 
none of whom have any seat or residence in the parish. 

Parochial Begisters.-The register has been always regularly 
kept: the earliest entry in it is dated 1751. 



TOWIE.

Antiquities,— The most conspicuous object of antiquity is, the 
ruins of the Castle of Towie, of which a square tower is almost all 
that now remains. In November 1751, Sir Adam Gordon of 
Auchindoir sent Captain Ker with a party of foot to the Castle 
of Towie, to summon it in the Queen's name. Alexander Forbes, 
its possessor, was then absent, and his lady, whose maiden name 
was Margaret Campbell, not only refused to surrender, but also 
poured on Captain Ker a torrent of abuse, and from the battlement 
took a deliberate aim and fired at him ; but the ball only " grazed 
his knee," whereupon, transported with rage, he ordered his men to 
set fire to the castle, when the lady, her children, and domestics, 
in all thirty-seven persons, perished in the flames. The remauis 
of the lady were interred in the church-yard, at what is now called 
the farm of Nethertowie, where a white stone long marked her 
grave. This catastrophe gave rise to a ballad, which commemo- 
rates the particulars. 

There are ruins of chapels at Nethertowie, Kinbattoch, Belna- 
both. Ley, and chapel of Sinnahard. At Kinbattoch is a doun or. 
artificial mound of earth, which appears to have been surrounded 
with about ten feet of water; but no vestige of any fortification that 
may have been there, now remains. The tumuli on the farm of 
Kinbattock were opened in 1750, in which were found several 
Mstivaen, containing urns, trinkets, bones, Roman medals with in- 
scriptions, &amp;c. 

At Fechley is a mound upwards of 60 feet high, and surround- 
ed by a fosse, partly natural and partly artificial, breadth from 
12 to 41 feet, and depth from 8 to 35 feet. The breadth of the 
mound on the summit is 127 by 200 feet; on which are the vitri- 
fied remains of a tower. 

On the Glasschill or Grayhill are large tumuli, one of which com- 
memorates the defeat of the Lord of Athol and 200 Englishmen 
at arms, who came to take the castle of Kildrummy from Robert 
Rruce's family, when Edward Longshanks had possession of al- 
most all the rest of Scotland. They were repulsed here principally 
through the valour of the Forbeses, who pursued and almost total- 
ly annihilated them in the forest of Kilblean. 

In the churchyard is a large stone, six feet in length, sculptured 
with hieroglyphics. 

In a field on the north side of the river, near the present bridge, 
is a stone of unhewn granite, standing upright, height, about seven 
feet above ground, supposed to be of Druidical origin.

Modern Buildings. — There are no buildings of any note. The 
church, a plain substantial building, was erected in 1803. The 
Masonic Society here built a lodge, in which there is a spacious 
hall, in 1821. It stands almost close to the turnpike road, and 
is kept as an inn, which is well frequented.

There are 3 persons insane, and 1 deaf, dumb, and blind. 

Character Manners, Sj-c. of the People. — The people generally 
are industrious, and neat and cleanly in their houses and in their per- 
sonal habits, and enjoy a reasonable portion of the comforts and ad- 
vantages of society. Vocal and instrumental music, particularly 
the violin, form the most prominent amusements of the people in 
the winter evenings, and it is believed that few parishes in Scot- 
land can boast of so many good Strathspey players, who are also 
temperate in their habits, and industriously employed in their 
other avocations. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture.— number of cultivated acres may be comput- 
ed at upwards of 2400. About 100 acres more might be brought 
under cultivation ; but the doing so would be attended with a heavy 
expense, and uncertain profit. A rotation of seven years is uni- 
versally adopted. 

B,ent of Land. — The average rent of land may be stated at 
18s. per acre. The duration of leases is usually nineteen years. 
The farm-buildings are, with few exceptions, substantial and com- 
modious, having for the most part been built by the tenants, with 
an allowance at the expiry of lease seldom exceeding a year's rent; 
a sum in most cases not equal to one-third of the cost of erection. 
The native limestone has never been generally used ; and on ac- 
count of its inferior quality, and the difficulty of obtaining fuel, 
it is now almost eptirely abandoned, and is obtained from Cor- 



TOWIE.

gaif, Glenbucket, and Ardonald lime-works near Keith. Moss 
is obtained only from the hills adjoining the Cabrach, and the dis- 
tance proves a serious drawback on agricultural improvement. 

RateoJ Fa7e5.— The wages of ploughmen per the half year, 
exclusive of board and lodging, are from L. 5 to L. 7 ; women ser- 
vants from L. 2 to L. 3; labourers Is. per day with victuals. 

i/j7/5._There are two meal-mills, one barley-mill, one flax-miU, 
one potato-farina-mill, one saw-mill. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Means of Commiinication.— i\m-i\i\ke road from Aberdeen 
passes through the parish on the north side, and the old country 
road from Aberdeen passes from east to west on the south side. 
There are about two miles of turnpike roads, and about ten of com- 
mutation roads. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church, though not exactly centri- 
cal, is as nearly so as. the locality admits of: it is situate on the 
south or right bank of the river. The manse is situated near the 
top of an acclivity of about sixty feet, at the bottom of which, and 
between it and the river, was a small haugh, part of the glebe land, 
about fourteen yards wide, and six feet higher than low water. This 
haugh was almost entirely carried away by a late flood. The glebe, 
previous to this flood, contained about four acres, and was worth 
L. 8. The manse was built in 1819, and consists of three stories, 
and is pretty commodious.. 

The stipend, including allowance for communion elements, is 
L. 132, 8s. 7d. Sterling, in money, and 26 bolls, 1 stone, 10 lbs. 
meal, and 7 quarters 1 peck of bear. 

The whole parishioners belong to the Established Church, with 
the exception of two families of Roman Catholics. The average 
number of communicants is 462. 

Education. — There is only one school in the parish, namely, 
the parochial school. The teacher has the legal extent of garden 
ground ; a house of four rooms, including the kitchen, and a spa- 
cious school-room attached ; and a salary of L. 28 Sterling. The 
branches of education usually taught by him-are, Latin, English 
reading and grammar, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, mathe- 
matics, and geography. The amount of school-fees is about L.20. 
The teacher is entitled to the Dick bequest, and has hitherto rank- 
ed above the average allowance from that fund. 

Literature. — A public library was instituted here by voluntary 
subscription in 1827, and consists of upwards of 500 volumes in 
history, religion, science, and general literature. 



ABERDEENSHIUE. 



Friendly Society. — There was a masonic society instituted here 
in 1814, and denominated St Andrew's Lodge of Glenkindic 
Free Mason Friendly Society, which usually distributes among 
its members to the amount of L, 30 per annum. 

Poor and Parochial Funds — The average number of paupers 
receiving regular aid is 15; the average sum allotted to each is 
about L. 2, 16s. per annum ; the annual amount of contributions 
for their relief is about L. 43 Sterling, of which L. 30 arises from 
church collections, . and about L. 13 from interest of funds, &amp;c. 
Ale-houses. — There are two hcensed ale and spirit-dealers. 
Fairs. — There are two cattle trysts held annually at the Glen- 
kindie Mason's Arms Inn ; the one lately altered to the first 
Monday after Trinity Muir in April, and the other on the first 
Saturday after Keith in September. There are also two feeing 
markets held at the same place, on the day after the Whitsunday 
and Martinmas terms, unless the same shall happen on Sunday, 
when they are held on the Monday following. These are well 
attended ; but it is generally acknowledged that the feeing mar- 
kets have a demoralizing effect upon the labouring classes. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
In comparing the former Statistical Account of 1791 with the 
present, it appears that gravel was then a very prevalent disease, 
in consequence of some families, in which it was thought to have be- 
come hereditary, intermarrying. Very few cases of that malady have 
occurred for many years past. By the former Account, the number 
of ploughs was 43, each drawn by eight or ten small oxen ; now the 
number of ploughs is about 78, each drawn by a pair of horses, many 
of which are strong and active. Roads have been much improved 
of late, but are still susceptible of great improvement, especially the 
bye-roads to many of the farms. There are three wooden bridges 
across the Don for foot-passengers, which are often rendered use- 
less by the flooded state of the river, — much inconvenience being 
thereby occasioned to all classes, and danger to the children attend- 
ing school. 

The greatest obstacle to improvement is, that, mostly all the 
estates being held under entail, the common allowance for build- 
ing is one year's rent, which may be reckoned two-thirds too little 
for the ordinary conveniences of a farm-steading ; and seldom is 
any allowance granted for enclosures, drains, or the reclaiming of 
waste land.

PRESBYTERY OF GARIOCH, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER CUSHNY, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

]Jame. The name Rayne was sometimes written Rame ia 

the records of the seventeenth century, but more frequently Rain, 
the orthography which is still retained in Old Rain, the post-town. 
It was probably derived from a Gaelic word of similar sound, Raon, 
signifying a field of good ground,— a term sufficiently appropriate 
to'this parish, which consists of open and continuous fields, gene-- 
rally of good soil, and under productive tillage. 

Extent, §-c. — This is a landward parish, of moderate extent and 
compact form, beingaboutSi miles in each direction, "and contain- 
ing 11 square miles. Its figure is not perfectly regular, but approach- 
ing to a square : it is bounded on the south side by the parish of 
Oyne, and divided from it by the water of Ury ; on the west, by 
that of Culsamond ; on the east, by parts of Daviot, and Chapel 
of Garioch ; and on the north, by parts of Fyvie and Auchter- 
less. It forms the northern boundary of an inland district 
of Aberdeenshire called the Garioch, which is divided from 
that of Formartine, by the hill of Rothmaise in Rayne, about 
850 feet above the level of the sea. With the exception of this 
hill, the parish consists of undulating fields, and gentle acclivi- 
ties, with a long tract of peat-moss or bog, towards the north side, 
reaching from the west boundary to the east, where Daviot be- 
gins. 

Climate, t-c— The temperature is of a moderate range, and 
on the whole remarkably equal, the mean height of the thermo- 
meter being in 1837.

there being no mountains of sufficient magnitude to attract the 
clouds and vapours, which are drawn towards the higher ridges of 
Bennachee on the south-west, and Foudland on the north-west ; 
so that while the summits bf these are frequently enveloped in 
dense mists, and copious showers of rain and snow are precipitated 
along the sides of them, little of the falling moisture, comparative- 
ly, reaches this lower level ; and sometimes the air continues quite 
clear and dry. 

Hydrography. —The springs of water are perennial, but not 
very abundant ; there are no lakes within the parish, nor any 
considerable mountain streams, the Ury only bounding it for two 
miles on the south side. 

Geology and Mineralogy.— The stones which prevail here are 
of the species usually called whinstone, of a deep blue colour, hard 
texture, and great weight. They are found of various sizes and 
qualities, according to their 'situations, sometimes detached and 
near the surface, and sometimes in large and continuous masses 
under ground ; which last, being split by means of gunpowder and 
wedges, and squared with the hammer, form the chief material of 
the country buildings, and are very durable. There is no granite 
here, although it is abundant both in quarries and outlayers on 
Bennachee, a mountain three miles southward ; neither have slates 
been discovered in the bounds, though they are found in a hill 
three miles northward ; but it is probable that there is slate iu the 
hill of Rothmaise, which appears to be a continuation of the Foud- 
land and Culsamond hills, in which are many bush-quarries of 
valuable slates. The chief alluvial deposit is that of peat moss, 
of which there is an extensive flat, already mentioned, above three 
miles in length, varying in breadth and depth, and comprising 
above 500 imperial acres. In one part of this flat, peats were 
found about sixty years ago, containing a large portion of adipose 
or fatty matter, and having a white and unctuous appearance on 
the surface, and which when ignited emitted a flame and light as 
bright as those of a tallow candle. On this account they were 
commonly called « creeshy clods," i.e. greasy small peats ; and 
were burned sparingly, as a cheap sort of light, in the winter even- 
ings by all who could procure them. But the quantity of this pe- 
culiar kind of peat appears to have been small, and has been long 
exhausted. The chief remains now found in the moss are pieces 
of hazel, birch, oak, &amp;c. which indicate that this tract had once 
been covered with natural wood, and trees of goodly size.

The soil of the best fields is loam on a bottom of clay, more or 
less mixed with gravel, and which, with good culture, bears abun- 
dant crops; the residue is a poorer soil, of less depth, and on a 
harder bottom, in some parts of till, and in others of rotten rock, 
here called chad. But this ground also, when manured, produces 
grain of fair quality, though in much smaller quantity than the 
former; and the green crops and herbage raised on it are found 
to be less succulent and nutritious than those which grow on the 

rich infield grounds. 

The soil and climate cannot be called favourable to the larger 
species of fruit, being neither a carse, nor a mountain-sheltered 
strath ; and few fruit trees are planted here, except in the gardens 
of proprietors; but a taste for growing gooseberries, and currants 
for preserving, is gradually advancing among the tenantry; and 
these small fruits are produced of very good quality. There are 
no rare species of wild plants in this locality, nor any forests of 
natural wood; but there are a few enclosures of moderate com- 
pass planted with larch and Scots fir, which last grows rapidly 
in the early stages, but begins to show symptoms of decay after 
the fortieth year. Ash and elm, beech and plane trees, which are 
here planted in belts and rows, and around gardens, grow to a 
goodly size, and yield timber of excellent quality. 

II. — Civil History. 
Eminent Men. — One native may be mentioned on account 
of the eminence which he attained abroad, viz. William Leslie, 
second son to William, the fifth laird of Warthill, in this 
place. Born in 1657, he got a classical education in the pa- 
rochial school, and, having completed his academical studies 
at one of the universities in Aberdeen, became schoolmaster in 
the parish of Chapel of Garioch for some years ; but, being there 
persuaded by Count Leslie, a member of the Balquhane family, 
and his own cousin-german, to embrace the Romish faith, he went 
to Rome with the Count in 1684; and there became so noted for 
his learning and piety, that, at the age of thirty-three years he was 
chosen to be Professor of Theology in the College of Padua, and 
was afterwards made Bishop of Laybach in Carniola, and a Prince 
of the German empire, which honour, along with others, he retain- 
ed through life : he died at his see in 1727. During his long 
residence abroad, he faithfully corresponded with his brother Alex- 
ander, the sixth laird of Warthill, and sent him at one time an ori- 
ginal portrait of himself, esteemed a good picture, and which, with 



424 



ABERDEENSHIRE. 



many of liis letters, is still in possession of William Leslie, Esq. 
the present proprietor of ibe family estate. 

Land-moncrs. — In 1674, there were fifteen land-owners in this 
parish ; but in less than a century after, they had decreased in 
number to seven, afterwards to five, and now there are six, viz. 
Sir Robert Dalrymple Horn Elphinstone, of Old Rain and Logie-- 
Elphinstone, Baronet; Sir Alexander Leith, of Freefield and 
Cushiestown, K. C. B. ; William Leslie of Warthill and Tocher, 
Esq. ; Alexander Gordon, of Meiklewarthill.and Loanhead, Esq. ; 
Alexander Forbes, of Rothmaise and Blackford, Esq. ; John Gor- 
don, of Kirktown and Lentush, Esq. 

Parochial Registers. — The Session records commence in 1672, 
and amount to ten volumes, comprising accounts of the poor's funds, 
church discipline, and register of births and marriages, but none 
of deaths. The baptismal record has been regularly kept during 
the last twenty years ; and that it was not so previously, was ow- 
ing to the negligence of the parents. 

Antiquities. — In the south-east part of the parish is a conical 
hill, called a law, on which, according to tradition, trials were held 
of old, and doom pronounced, and at times, perhaps, summarily 
executed. This .little hill, of which the top is now covered with 
fir trees and furze, has given the name of T.aioesk now Louesk 
to the adjoining farms, extending to several hundred acres. 
About a mile westward from it was a well, called St Lawrence 
Well ; and, at the distance of another mile west, is the village of 
Old Rain, where is held an annual market, named Lawrence Fair. 
On a small rising-ground in the middle of this village, and which 
was surrounded by a moat, there was once a house of residence 
for the Bishop of Aberdeen, who, upon the union of the Episcopal 
sees of Mortlach and Aberdeen in 1137, received from King 
David, in grant to himself and his successors, the lands of Old 
Aberdeen, Sclattie, Clatt, Kildrummie, Daviot, and Raine, by 
which the see was greatly enriched. It is recorded, " that Alex- 
ander Kinninmonth, who was made bishop in 1329, passed the 
winter in Mortlach, the spring in Aberdeen, and the summer and 
harvest at Fetternear and Raine, that he might the ntiore com- 
modiously discharge his office in every part of his diocese." 
And he it probably was, that built the residence referred to, the 
foundation of which was discernible in the last century, but has 
since been effaced, and the ground brought under tillage. Here 
also is a market-cross, consisting of an upright pillar of hewn gra-

nite, raised on a pedestal of circular steps, and measur ug neady 
12 eet from the ground to the top. Above the middle of th.. 
pillar is an iron staple withhnks, the remams o the.«., m which 
£d ers were wonf to be exposed to public shame; and half of 
he iron collar which clasped the neck of the delmquent remamed

cross was probably erected in the end of te seventeenth 
century, when John Horn of Westhall, superior of Old Rain, was 
empowered by charter to constitute it a burgh of barony, with re- 
gular markets and bailie courts,_which last were held according- 

]y in the eighteenth century. , , . .„ • -j- i 

Four hmrdred yards eastward from this village, is a Druidical cir- 
cle or temple ; and at the like distance from this to the north- 
east, in the line of the church road, is part of an ancient cairn, 
called Drum's. Cairn, said to mark the spot , where Irvme of 
Drum was slain, while pursuing Donald, Lord of the Isles after 
the battle of Harlaw, 141 1. Another tradition bears that he was 
slain nearer to the field of action, about four mdes to the south- 
east and buried at Drum on Deeside, the seat of that ancient fa- 
mily; a discrepancy which may be reconciled, by supposing that 
he was wounded near Harlaw, but able to pursue the enemy to 
this place, where, from exhaustion, or fresh wounds, he fell. The 
cairn was opened and partly removed eight years ago, on the road 
being widened at the place ; but nothing was found confirmatory 
of the above tradition ; and though a field in the near vicinity is 
named " Drum Fauld" it may have acquired that name from its- 
round and convex form, various other places of the like appear- 
ance being also called Drums. Half a mile eastward from Drum's 
Cairn is another small one, in the Moor of Rayne, called Tilly 
daff's Cairn, as marking the place where Tillydaff, laird of Mains 
of Warthill, was killed in 1530. Having assaulted a neighbour- 
ing land-owner, Leslie of 'Warthill, second son of Wardhouse, in. 
Lawrence fair, he was pursued by Wardhouse and his other son&amp; 
for several miles, and fell by their hands at this spot ; now a small 
green mound, which does not appear to have been opened.. 
A third cairn, of larger dimensions than either of the former, is 
found near the summit of the hill of Rothmaise, now called the 
Black Cairn ; but of the origin or intention of which there is no 
tradition extant. About fifty years ago, it was partially opened, 
and removed by the then proprietor, when a stone-cofiin was found, 
and a key of rude workmanship. Another Druidical circle is seen 



426 



ABlillDEENSIIIUE. 



on the east side of the same hill ; and on the top of it are two large 
stones, not far apart, called the Crighton Stone, and the Fede- 
raught Stone, which are probably commemorative of some feud, 
or fatal encounter betwixt the Crightons of Frendraught in For- 
gue, and the family of Federaught in Deer. The west of this 
hill looks to one about a mile distant, in the neighbouring parish 
of Culsamond, called Caiiithill, whereon are several cairns or 
barrows ; by which passed a Roman road, leading, as is supposed, 
from the large encampment south of the river Dee, to the camp 
of Glenmellan near the Ythan, {castra ad Ithunum and with 
this latter the Black Cairn may have been in some way connected. 
At Freefield, a mile southward from Cairnhill, is an artificial grassy 
mound of 60 yards in circumference, and 18 feet in height, pro- 
bably a signal post, having relation to the supposed Roman 
way, above-mentioned. Near the church is a large flat-head- 
ed rock, called Bowman Stone, where archers may have met 
in ruder times to practise with the bow ; as at the Bowbutts in 
other places. Half a mile east from- this, is a rising ground nam- 
ed Saint Andrew's Hill, on which fetes may have foraierly been 
held in honour of the patron saint ; and a mile eastward from 
that, is a round knoll or eminence on the lands of Meikle Wart- 
hill, called the Earl of Marr's Reive or Ree. 

Modern Buildings, — The church is a plain structure, erected 
in 1789 forL.350 Sterling. The mansion-houses are those of Free- 
field and Rothmaise, built in the last century ; and that of Wart- 
hill, in the present century. Freefield is surrounded with ash, beech, 
larch, and pine trees, of great height and beauty, and also with 
some Spanish chestnut trees, which blossom but do not bear fruit. 
There are five meal-mills in the parish, of which three are slated ; 
and forty-four thrashing-mills for grain, of which ten are moved 
by water, and the rest by horses.

society, without extravagance. They are not addicted to poach-

ceptions, attentive to their moral and religious duties.

Four-fifths of the whole superficial content, of this parish are cultivated, and unr

The valued rent of the whole lands is L. 2544 Scots. The real 
rent, consisting partly of grain, commuted at the county fiars, is 
variable; but that of the best ground or old infield may average 
per imperial acre L. 2 Sterling ; and that for outfield, varying ac- 
cording to the quality, from 12s. to L. 1, 4s. per imperial acre ; 
and the latter, comprising about four-fifths of the land in tillage, 
while the former is only one- fifth, reduces the average rent to 
something less than L. I Sterling per arable acre; and makes 
the gross rental of the whole, L. 5650. There are no grass fields 



428 



AUEIlDUENSIIIllE, 



let in the parisli ; and the rales of grazing cannot be correctly 
stated. 

Wages. — The farm-servants are engaged for six months, and, 
being chiefly unmarried, they lodge and eat in their masters' 
houses, and receive, besides, in money-wages half-yearly, for 
ploughmen, L. 5 to L. 7 ; for lads, L. 3 to L. 4 ; and boys for 
herding cattle, &amp;c. L. 1, 10s. to L. 2, 10s.; women servants re- 
ceive in winter, L. 2, in summer, L. 3 ; labourers working by the 
day, earn 2s. or Is. 6d. with meat; masons earn 3s. per day; 
carpenters, 2s. 8d. ; and all other tradesmen charge by the piece 
of work done. 

Live-Stock. — A great many black-cattle are reared here, as in 
all the inland districts of Aberdeenshire, principally of the country 
breeds, horned and bald ; but some breeders are crossing this kind 
with the Teeswater or short-horned cattle, and thereby adding 
greatly to the size and weight of the carcase, when fed, but not, 
it is thought, to the fineness of the quality and grain of the meat. 
The number of milk-cows, kept by the crofters solely for dairy 
produce, and by the farmers for that and breeding, exceeds 500 ; 
and that of other cattle of all different _ages, from calves to oxen of 
four years growth, 1300. Very few oxen are here yoked in the 
plough, though in the end of the last century it was the general 
custom to have ten of these ploughing on each of the principal 
farms. Most of them are now fed at three and four years' old, 
and sold to the butchers and exporters, weighing from 6 to 9 cwt. 
Our horses, though much larger than those of the country breed 
of former times, cannot be called heavy ; but they are hardy and 
active, and fit both for ploughing in pairs, and carrying the grain 
to market in single carts, at the rate of four quarters to each horse. 
Of these the number used solely for husbandry is 220 ; as pleasure 
horses and ponies, 20 ; young horses bred for sale or use, 40 ; 
making of this kind, 280. There being no extensive range of hill 
or moorland pasture, the number of sheep kept is very limited, not 
exceeding in all 440 ; viz. of the Scots black-faced breed for feed- 
ing, 200 ; and of a large cross-breed, for wool for home use, and 
raising lambs, kept in small lots, 240. 

The system of agriculture pursued in this parish, and generally 
through the district of Garioch, may be reckoned good, when viewed, 
as it ought to be, in relation to the soil and climate, the distance 
from sea poi'ts and grain markets, and other local circumstances. 
One peculiarity to be noticed is the great variety in the size of 



IIAYNE. 



429 



the firms from that of two horses labour to that of six horses; 
besides which, are numerous small crofts for tradesmen keeping a 
cow, and other possessions, of eight, twelve, and twenty acres, oc- 
cupied in lease by industrious tenants, labouring with their own 
hands, and usually tilling with a horse and ox yoked together. These 
multiplied subdivisions of the ground, into portions so small, may 
no doubt be adverse to the adopting of new and improved modes 
of culture, on a large' and uniform scale; but this disadvantage 
has Ion., appeared to the writer, to be counterbalanced by the 
powerful encouragement thereby afforded to the practice of honest 
industry and prudence, among the labouring classes of the com- 
munity. In counties that are under a different management, and 
which have no gradation of possessions betwixt the cottar's acre 
and the grain farm of 100 acres, or the sheep farm of 1000 acres, 
the man who begins life as a farm-servant, day-labourer, or trades- 
man, how diligent and economical soever he may be, is almost 
precluded from the hope of bettering his condition, by the occu- 
pancy of a small farm, suited to his means and industry, and must 
limit his views to the cottar's croft, realizing, in most instances, 
the English adage, « once a hind, always a hind." But in Aber- 
deenshire, which has been sometimes called " the poor man's coun- 
try," a farm-servant or labourer, after having estabhshed his cha- 
racter by activity, temperance, and economy, has little difficulty in 
getting a possession proportioned to the amount of his savings, on 
which, by exertion and foresight, he may live comfortably, and 
bring up a family, in the like industrious, peaceable, and inde- 
pendent way. And, in proof of the efficiency of this stimulus 
there are at present within the bounds of this small parish, many 
instances of persons, who, from very humble beginnings, have gra- 
dually risen, by their own exertions, to be thriving and intelligent 
agriculturists. And though the small possessions are proportion- 
ally higher rented than the large ones, they have always more 
competitors for occupying them ; and if there be less capital in- 
vested, in curmdo, for carrying on expensive improvements, which 
is doubtful, there are more of the necessary sinews of industry 
employed in comparison, and much more caution, sobriety, and 
contentment, exercised in bad seasons, which tend to secure equal 
and regularly' paid rents to the land-owners ; consequently, on well- 
managed estates in this place, arrears of rent are of rare occur- 
rence, and small amount. 

The leases are usually granted for nineteen years ; and as wheat 



430 



ABERDEENSHIRE. 



is not much cultivated, the turnip husbandry, with oats and bear, 
hay and pasture, is generally followed, under the various rota- 
tions of five, seven, and six years. Of these, the last may be con- 
. sidered the best, for keeping the ground both rich and clean, and 
also producing most luxuriant crops; having three-sixths of the 
whole possession in grass, two-sixths in grain, and one-sixth in 
turnips, which are uniformly drilled and hoed. The manure 
chiefly employed is animal dung, with the addition of bone dust 
when required; and it is now very customary to give the outfield 
lands a top-dressing, with a compost of earth and lime, or earth 
and dung, on the pasture grass, before ploughing it for a crop of 
oats. 

The farm-houses are plain substantial buildings, mostly of one 
floor, and thatch-roofed ; but a few of them lately erected have 
two floors and slate roofs, and as there are slate quarries in the 
neighbouring parish, it may be hoped that both the dwelling- 
houses and offices hereafter built on the principal farms will be 
slated. Very few of the fields are enclosed, either with hedges 
or dikes ; from the difficulty of watering the enclosures sufficiently 
for grazing cattle, and of procuring good stones for dikes at a 
moderate distance and expense. The only uncultivated ground 
likely to repay the cost of improvement, is the area of the moss 
that has been exhausted of peat, and which, on being dried and 
tilled, bears luxuriant crops in ordinary seasons ; and of this kind of 
ground lying along the sides of the moss, 400 acres have been 
broughtinto cultivation since the beginning of the present century, 
adding so much to the dimensions and value of the respective estates. 

Produce. — It is not easy to give a correct statement of the 
amount or value of the whole yearly produce, as that of many 
small possessions is in great part consumed by the occupiers and 
their families, and no account thereof regularly kept. But, com- 
puting the annual returns of oats and bear big to be Q\ quar- 
ters from each acre of infield land in crop, and 4 quarters from 
each acre of outfield in crop, which are fair estimates for ordi- 
nary seasons, the gross yearly produce of these crops is 10470 
quarters, yielding at the average of L. 1 each, L. 10,470 Sterling; 
cattle reared and sold from the parish, viz. oxen of three and four 
years old, 400 at L. 10, L. 4000 ; butter, cheese, and eggs, &amp;c. 
sold, L. 1500; total, L. 15,970. Of the corn produced, there 
are required yearly for seed, 1800 quarters ; for food to 1500 per- 
sons, at 30 stones of meal to each, 3200 quarters ; leaving for 



IIAYNE. 



431 



malt, horse-corn, sale, nad all other purposes, 5470 quarters, 
= 10 470 quarters. From the gross value pf cattle sold, a de- 
duction should be made for grass parks rented by the _ tenants 
annuallv, amounting to about L. 400. But this outlay is much 
more than compensated by hay sold, and potatoes and other farm 
and dairy produce consumed at home, but of which the value Can- 
not be ascertained. 

The cheese made here is mostly from skim -milk, and does not 
brino- a higher price in the market than from 3s. to 4s. per imperial 
stone. But' butter is made in great abundance and of good quality 
by the farmers, and also by the crofters, who have little other pro- 
duce to spare for the market. It is bought up by the country mer- 
chants at 7d. to 9d. per imperial pound ; salted in casks and sold 
in Aberdeen, for city consumpt, or exportation. The annual value 
of butter, cheese, and eggs, sold from the rural parts of this county, 
was estimated some years since at L.90,000 Sterling ; of which con- 
siderable revenue it may be affirmed that Rayne, with its nume- 
rous small possessions, drew an adequate share ; it being ascer- 
tained, that, on farms of L. 80 rent, the yearly value of dairy 
produc'e sold has been L. 20, or one-fourth thereof. 

The corns throughout this whole county are now cut down with 
the scythe, which is found to be much more expeditious for oats- 
and bear than the sickle, and consequently, more profitable, by 
preventing the hazard from over-ripening and shaking. The 
thrashing, on all farms of two horses' labour and upwards, is ac- 
complished by machinery, or thrashing-mills, which are now very 
numerous. Formerly, the oats were milled, and the meal sold in 
the Aberdeen market ; but now the greater part is sold in grain 
and carted to Invevury, whence it is conveyed by the canal barges 
to Aberdeen for being milled or exported. 

Manufactures. — Almost the only manufacture carried on here, 
is the knitting of woollen stockings, &amp;c. with wires, as mentioned 
in the Statistical Account of 1794. All the women and some old 
men were employed in knitting coarse stockings for the Dutch 
.• market, and thereby brought into the parish about L. 400 Ster- 
ling yearly. This easy and lucrative manufacture was for a time 
interrupted, and nearly annihilated, by the war with France, and 
Holland under its sway ; but through the persevering enterprise of 
a few eminent capitalists in Aberdeen, it was succeeded by one of 
a similar kind, viz. the knitting of coarse worsted vests or under- 
jackets, for seafaring persons, and of blue woollen bonnets, com- 



432 



A13ERDENS1I1UE. 



monly worn by labouring men and boys, wbich are also knitted 
with wires, and afterwards milled. This is the common employ- 
ment of all the aged, and many of the young women in the dis- 
trict of Garioch ; and at the rate of 3d. to 4d. for knitting a 
jacket, and Id. to 2d. for a bonnet, it will yield, with some 
coarse stockings, to those of this parish alone, about L. 600 per 
annum. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Town. — There is no market-town within the parish, 
and the one nearest to it is Inverury, a small royal burgh about 
eight miles distant, on the turnpike road to Aberdeen, 

Means of Communication. — There is a post-office in Old Rain, 
two miles from the church, and the Royal Mail from Aberdeen to 
Inverness passes and repasses near to it every twenty-four hours, 
as does also another daily coach, on the same road, so that tra- 
vellers are well accommodated. A new line of turnpike was late- 
ly opened, from the Huntly road at Garden's mill, to Old Mel- 
drum, joining the line from that to the port of Newburgh. This 
turnpike is made through Rayne, about three miles from west to 
east, and though not yet much frequented, it may, from its vici- 
nity to the slate quarries, become very beneficial to the country. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is situated most conveniently 
for the parishioners, being nearly in the centre of the parish, and 
not more than two miles distant from the extremities of it. It was 
built in 1789, and made to contain in the area and two galleries 
i500 hearers, a number too limited when the population exceeded 
I ] 00 ; and though by the addition of two other galleries, the sit- 
tings have since been augmented to 700, they are still too few for 
the parishioners, now above 1500, besides about 30 persons an - 
nexed quoad sacra from the large adjoining parish of Fyvie. All 
the seats in the area being divided among the land-owners, in 
proportion to their valued rents, are by them apportioned to their 
tenants, free of charge, according to their real rents ; and a few 
sittings are set apart for the poor gratis. Three of the galleries, 
having been erected by the curators for the poor, are annually let 
by them to the parishioners, at the very moderate rate of Is. each 
sitting, and yield above L.14 Sterling yearly to the poor's funds, 
besides affording some free sittings to those who require them. 

The manse was built in 1751 for L.IOOO Scots, and was last 
repaired and enlarged in 1826. The arable glebe contains six 
imperial acres of good ground, and there are above two acres of

arass olebe, with 18s. Sterling in lieu of the residue of grass. 
The stipend was last augmented in 1823, when the heritors sur- 
rendered their whole teinds, amounting in Sterhng money to 
L 167 lis. 8d.; meal, at 10 imperial stones to the boll, 65 
bolls, 3 pecks, 2i lippies ; bear, in Aberdeenshire measure, 12 
bolls, 3 pecks, 04 lippies, the victual of both kinds bemg made 
-payable, with consent of the present incumbent, at the highest 
fiar prices of the county. 

There are no Chapels of Ease, Government churches, mission- 
aries, or catechists, nor any Episcopalian, Catholic, Seceding, or 
other Dissenting chapels within these bounds; but m the parish 
of Fyvie, and about three miles from hence, there is an Episco- 
pal chapel, with a numerous and respectable congregation. Thirty- 
four families in Rayne, comprising 100 persons of all ages, attend 
there ; 14 persons grown up attend various Dissenting meet- 
ings at a distance; and all the other famihes, amounting to 276, 
and comprising about 1400 persons, attend the Established 
Church, where the average number of the congregation is 700 
persons, and of the communicants, 750. The amount of 
annual collections for the poor on the roll has risen to about 
L.48, 10s.; and of extraordinary collections for the Aberdeen In- 
firmary, the Pauper Lunatic Fund, and the General Assembly's 
Schemes, about L.14 yearly. It is but justice to add, that the 
church contributions of the householders form only a small pro- 
portion of their alms, as they are daily bestowing meal and provi- 
sions on their indigent neighbours, and also on many wandering 
mendicants. 

Edncatio7i.— Besides the parochial school near the church, there 
is one in Meiklewarthill unendowed, and another in Old Rain, un- 
endowed, and presently taught by a Dissenter. In the latter two, 
the ordinary branches of reading, writing, and arithmetic are 
taught, which yield of yearly emolument to each of the teachers 
scarcely L.20. In the parochial school, Latin, Greek, and ma- 
thematics are taught, when required, in addition to the ordinary 
branches, and for which the teacher has the minimum salary of 
L.25, 13s. 4d. ; school fees and other dues, L.30; allowance from 
Mr Dick's Trustees, L.28 ; total, L.83, 13s. 4d. ; also a house 
with the legal accommodation, and an enclosed garden of one- 
fourth of a Scots acre. 

The quarter fees, payable at entry, are very moderate, viz. for 
reading and writing, 2s. 6d. ; with arithmetic, 3s. 6d. ; Latin,

Greek, or mathematics, 5s. The parents are generally anxious to 
give their offspring an education suitable to their station ; so that 
there are few young persons above six years who have not had an 
opportunity of learning to read, write, and cypher. None are pre- 
cluded by distance from attending the parochial school ; but as it 
was built thirty years ago, and for only eighty scholars, it 
could not accommodate the number of youth who now apply to 
education during the winter months, or from the close of harvest 
to the seed-time, being above 200, or one-seventh of the popula- 
tion: hence the success of the two unendowed schools in the villages, 
each of them about two miles distant from the parish school, and 
equally well filled with it. 

There is no parish library, strictly so called ; but a reading so- 
ciety was formed about eight years ago, by thirty members, which 
affords the means of instructive and religious reading, at a very 
trivial expense, to all who desire it; and may tend also to increase 
the number of readers in the rising generation. 

Friendly Societies. — Of several Friendly Societies formed here, 
only one remains, called The Freefield Ploughmen Lodge, which 
remodelled its rules agreeably to the Act of ParUament, and seems 
to flourish. 

Savings Bank.— A District Savings Bank, on the security of 
the national funds, was opened in Inverury at Whitsunday last ; 
and the industrious classes in this and other surrounding parishes 
have availed themselves of the means of providing for the wants of 
age ; the deposits in six months, chiefly by male and female ser- 
vants, being about L.1500, and in two years amounting to nearly 

L. 6000. . 

Pool' and Parochial Funds.— Oi poor persons on the parish roll, 
the average is 40, and the amount distributed quarterly in sums 
from 8s. to 15s. according to their relative circumstances, is L.20 
or L.80 per annum. The yearly amount of church collections is 
L. 48, 10s. ; rents drawn for seats of three galleries, L. 14, 5s. ; 
interest of poor's funds lent, L. 7, 10s.; donations, legacies, and 
other casual ' supplies, L.12 ; total, L.82, 5s. There is one fund 
for the poor of all the parishes in the county and synod, 
except those in Fordyce, and two others which have assessments, 
which deserves to be recorded, in memory of the benevolent do- 
nor, the late John Burnett, of Dens, Esq. a citizen of Aberdeen, 
who bequeathed a considerable part of his residuary estate for 
this charitable purpose. This having been realized and mvested 



RAYNE.

in land, yields an annual rent of L.400, which is managed by the 
provincial synod, and distributed through the several presbyteries 
in rotation, in sums from L.20 to L.50 to each parish, accordmg 
to the relative numbers and necessities of their poor. And from 
this fund the poor of Rayne have received three distributions dur- 
ing the last twenty-three years, amounting in all to L.82. 

The first applications for rehef from the poor's funds are gene- 
rally made with reluctance ; but aid being granted chiefly to the 
aged and infirip who have no relations able to support them, and 
widows with helpless children, the feeling of shame is in them 
gradually overcome by the fear of want. 

Fairs.— The principal fairs in the parish are the Tryst of Wart- 
hill, a large cattle-market held annually about Whitsunday N.S.; 
Lawrence fair, at Old Rain, also a considerable market, held yearly 
at Lammas ; a new market in the same place in October ; and 
Andersmas fair at Kirktown, after Martinmas O.S., besides two 
feeing markets for servants, held near Old Rain, before Whitsun- 
day and Martinmas respectively. 

Alehouses. — There are at present four alehouses licensed to sell 
spirits ; a number much greater than is requisite for the accom- 
modation of the parishioners and lawful travellers. 

Fuel. — The fuel most used is peat, dug from the extensive bog 
or moss already mentioned, about Whitsunday, dried there for six 
weeks, and carted home and built in stacks in July. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

The chief variations betwixt the present state of the parish, and 
that in 1794, are \. The increase of population from 1173 to 
1510 ; 2. The rise of rent from L.1300 to L. 5650. 

Better parish roads, leading to the several turnpikes, would be 
a valuable means of improvement here.

<p>

PRESBYTERY OF ALFOllD, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. ROBERT SCOTT, MINISTER. 



1. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — This parish derives its name from two Gaelic words, 
glearm, a glen, and buidhe, signifying yellow, or from the stream of 
Bucket, which intersects the glen, taking its rise among the lofty 
mountains ; separating Glenlivat and Glenbucket, and which falls 
into the Don below the venerable castle, the seat of the 
ancient Gordons of Glenbucket. The castle stands in a com- 
manding and beautiful situation, totally neglected, and fast falling 
into complete ruin. 

Extent. — The average breadth of the parish is about one mile 
arable, and, including the mountain ranges, about 2 miles ; its 
length arable about 6 miles, — including the mountains, 10 miles. 

The parish is almost surrounded by Strathdon : for a small 
space to the north-west it adjoins Cabrach and Glenlivat. But 
from these, it is separated by a regular range of lofty mountains. 

A narrow and romantic pass leads into the parish from the east, 
commencing at the confluence of the rivers Don and Bucket, be- 
low the castlel 

Craigenscore is the highest hill in the parish ; it lies to the north, 
and rises about 2000 feet above the level of the sea. Benneaw 
is the next highest, and is 1800 feet above the level of the sea, 
The castle is built on the acclivity of this hill. 

Climate. — The climate is severe. In the summer months it is 
sometimes excessively hot ; in winter, north winds, deep snows, 
and keen frosts prevail, which frequently continue long, and make 
late and bad spring months. 

Geology.— The rocks are generally primitive. There are to 
be found, hornblende, felspar, gneiss, mica-slate, granite, and pri- 
mitive limestone in great abundance, which contains about seventy 
per cent. lime. It is worked to great advantage by the tenants, 
both for their own use and for sale. 



GLENBUCKET.

■ Zoology.— T\\e breeds of cattle, horses, and sheep, have been 
much improved within these few years, and bring annually a con» 
siderable sum of money to the glen. The wild animals are, foxes, 
hares, common and alpine; roe and red-deer frequent Glen- 
noughty. Birds; eagles, hawks, black-game, grouse, ptarmi- 
gan" snipes, dotterel, plover, partridges, &amp;c. and a great variety 
of small birds. Fish ; salmon, trout, and eels are found in the 
Don and Bucket. 

II. — Cjvil History. 

The barbarous feud that took place betwixt Mowat of Aber- 
geldie and Cameron of Brux, is recorded by the celebrated Pre- 
sident Forbes in the CuUoden Papers. 

The ancient Gordons Lairds of Glenbucket were long one 
of the most powerful feudal families in this county, a gallant and 
handsome race of men. The last laird had a distinguished com- 
mand under the Stuarts, in the bold, rash, and unfortunate en- 
terprizes of 1715 and 1745. It is said that George II. having 
the greatest horror at the name of the dread chieftain of Glen- 
bucket, often dreamed of him, starting in his sleep, and exclaim- 
ing in broken English, " De great Glenbucket be coming." The 
fact was, however, that very few gentlemen in the times in which 
he lived were more accomplished, humane, and brave. He made 
his escape to France a very old man after the fatal battle of 
Culloden. 

The Earl of Fife is sole heritor of the parish, as well as superior 
of the estates that once belonged to the ancient and powerful Earls 
of Mar. 

Parochial Registers.— The parochial registers, of late years, 
have been kept correctly. 

This summer, an excellent porter's lodge has been built by 
the Earl of Fife's orders at Badenyon, which will be of great be- 
nefit to that remote and celebrated spot. 

III. — Population. 

Beyond the year 1775, there is no report of the population of 

this parish. 

In 1775, the population was 430 
1801, . 420 

1811, . 443 

• 1821, ' 479—246 males— 233 females. 

1831, . 339—282 —257 

Population has increased in this parish, in consequence of the 
increasing cleanliness of the people, greater attention to children

in extreme infancy, vaccination, but, above all, the annihilation 
of smuggling. The improvements in every respect, since illicit 
distillation has been happily put down, are truly astonishing. 
Falsehood, swearing, drunkenness, and other immoral practices, 
although they linger with a few of the old and hardened, are fast 
disappearing ; and in their place are progressing, good manners, 
cleanliness, sobriety, exemplary attention to their moral and reli- 
gious duties, and diligence at their different avocations. The 
people are generally hardy, active, and intellectual; and since 
smuggling has come to an end, manifest a strong desire for read- 
ing and general information. The establishment of a library in 
the neighbourhood has been of great use. 

IV. — Industry. 
The inhabitants are all employed in agriculture, as farmers, 
crofters, and farm- servants, with a few mechanics. The soil is 
generally very good, and were the farms properly arranged, and 
leases of proper endurance given, great improvements would cer- 
tainly take place. There is excellent limestone, easily wrought, 
yielding upwards of seventy per cent; and inexhaustible peatmoss, of 
superior quality. Draining, enclosing, and planting would greatly 
amehorate the climate; and, although the humane and truly be- 
nevolent proprietor, the Earl of Fife, gives very little encourage- 
ment here, yet the people are farming, notwithstanding their many 
disadvantages, on the most improved system of agriculture, raising 
good crops of turnips, potatoes, hay, bear, and oats. The Mains 
farm at the castle is perhaps as well managed in every respect as 
any in Scotland. Roads are much wanted. It is to be wished 
that the Noble proprietor may soon turn his attention co the im- 
provement of this beautiful but still much neglected part of his 
princely estates. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Ecclesiastical State. — About twenty years ago, there were from 
twenty to thirty Ronian Catholics in the parish. With the ex- 
ception of two old people Roman Catholics there are no Dis- 
senters of any denomination from the Established Presbyterian 
church. Divine service in the church is well attended. The 
number of communicants is about 300. The stipend from teinds 
exhausted is L. 33, Os. 8d.; from Government, L. 125; in all, 
L. 158, 6s. 8d. The glebe is worth about L. 10 annually ; and 
the manse is in excellent condition. 

Poor. — The average annual collections for the benefit of the 

4 



TULLYNESSLE AND F01113ES. 



439 



poor amount to about L.U Sterling annually, which with a 
small fund from savings, furnishes the only means by which the 
poor are supported. There are 18 on the poor s roll. 

Edncatiol-Theve is a parish school, having the medium le- 
aal salary ; the school fees, a good house, excellent garden, and 
small croft of land of three acres, at a very moderate rent, support 
a duly qualified teacher. The people are particularly anxious to 
have their children educated, and there is not an individual but 

can read and write. , , , i • 

There is a small but useful adventure school kept during 
winter and spring, in the remote part of the parish, on the cele- 
brated classical spot where John of Badenyon lived. A proper 
teacher and salary at this station is much wanted.

PHESBYTERY of ALFORD, synod of ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. JAMES PAULL, A. M. MINISTER. 



I. Topography and Natural History. 

][ame. Tullynessle is understood to be a word of Gaelic 

extraction, and is descriptive of the situation of the church and 
manse. They stand upon a slightly elevated bank at the junction 
of two burns, which descend from neighbouring glens. The name 
of one of those burns is the Esset, and it is the opinion of some 
that Tullyn-esset is the proper and more ancient spelling. Tally 
is said to signify a dwelling, and Esle a sloping bank. The latter 
part of the name may be, therefore, either from Esset or Esle. In 
the one case the derivation would mean a house on a slightly ris- 
ing ground ; in the other, a house on the banks of the Esset. Of 
the origin of Forbes there is no satisfactory account. That the 
original parish of this name derived its appellation from the noble 
family, who have been proprietors of it for several centuries, there , 
is no doubt ; but, to the curious in names, there is here no solu- 
tion of the difficulty. 

 A k-gcnd, which the writer has often heard, if it fails to instruct, may at least 
amuse. The family of Forbes carries three boars' heads in its arms, and llic reason

AliEUDEENSHIRE. 



Boundaries and Extent, — Tullynessle and Forbes became a 
united parish in the year 1808; and it is one of those unions 
against which it would be difficult to raise any objection. Forbes 
had previously been, from the year 1722, joined to Kearn, from 
which it is separated by the range of hills which bound the dis- 
trict of Alford in that direction ; and the minister, whose residence 
was in the former parish,' preached, the one Sunday at Forbes and 
the other at Kearn. The parishioners of Forbes now enjoy the 
public ministrations of religion every Lord's-day. A great pro- 
portion of them are nearer to the church at Tullynessle than they 
were to that at Forbes ; and none have a greater distance to travel 
than about three, miles and a half. At the same time, the united po- 
pulation is not too large for the pastoral superintendence and labours 
of the minister. The length of the parish is about 7 miles, and its 
breadth 4 miles. With the exception of a single farm, and the 
part of Caille-var belonging to it, which lie on the opposite side, 
the river Don forms the southern boundary, separating it from the 
parish of Alford ; and the parish of Keig is the east boundary. 
On the west, it is bounded by Auchindoir ; and on the north, by 
Leslie, Clatt, and Rhynie. In these two last directions, it is se- 
parated from the parishes mentioned, by a mountainous range, of 
considerable elevation, at several points. As to their exact height 
above the level of the sea, the writer is unable to speak. Caille- 
var, on the opposite side of the river, is about 1850 feet above the 
level of the sea, and the points of Coreen, which is the general 
name of this chain, at Lord Arthur's Seat and Lord Forbes's 
Cairn, are probably about the same height. 

Takino- the river Don as a line which intersects the district of 
Alford from north-west to south-east, and viewing the district 
in the circular form which has been given to it by the shape of its 
mountainous boundary on all sides, Tullynessle and Forbes, with 
the part of Keig lying on the same side of the river, constitutes 
the northern portion of the circle. The parish is intersected by 
various ridges of hills, which descend from the boundary-chain in 
a south-easterly direction towards the river. 

Meteorology and Hydrography. — There is little to be said upon 

assigned for this by Sir Samuel Forbes, in his " View of the Diocese of Aberdeen," 
MS. is, " because the first of this family slew a wild ravenous boar near Castle For- 
bes, where, at this day on a stone, the figure of that boar, though rudely carved, is 
still seen." According to the prevailing story, the actor iu this bold exploit was de- 
sirous to give proof of his undaunted courage to the young and beautiful heiress of 
the Castle, whose name was Bess; and, having received her hand, as his reward, very 
properly assumed a name commemorative of his valour — " For-Bess" 



TULLYNESSLE AND FORBES. 441 

the first of these subjects, which would not equally apply to the 
.hole district. The climate naturally good, owuig to the sod 
and there being little clay bog in the par.sh, no do. b n 
considerably improved by plantu.g and drauung It vanes „ d.f- 
fevent parts of the parish. The crops upon those --j- - 
wards the river and have a south exposure are about ten days 
Ilier than the others which look towards the north, or are con- 

fined within the hills. , 

The harvest of 1837 will ever be gratefully remembei;ed by he 
inhabitants of the north of Scotland. From its conclus.m. o tbe 
8th day of January following the weather remained unusually fane 
There'was no snow, and so little rain fell that several of the 
springs which had been open in summer became dried up. pon 
that day we had a heavy fall of snow, which experienced a si ght 
diminution by means of a thaw that took place about a week after- 
wards, and continued about twenty-four hours. But this was im- 
mediately followed by an additional fall, and, for some tmie, scarcely 
a day passed in which there was not some increase. Until batur- 
dav, 24th Februarv, the weather continued calm ; but, on that day, it 
blew a dreadful hurricane, which was accompanied with a heavy 
fall of additional snow. The roads which had been partly cleared, 
were once more completely blocked up, and, in many cases, the 
cottages and farm-steadings were nearly invisible. For many 
weeks, nothing green out of doors was to be seen, but the tops ot 
the fir trees. The sufferings of the sheep with those of wild ani- 
mals and fowls were very great. Wood-pigeons and partridges 
have been nearly exterminated. The thermometer, on more than 
one occasion, stood as low as 12° below zero. Calculating from 
the rain-guage, and allowing a foot of snow for an inch of water, 
there must have fallen, in whole, snow to the depth of six feet over 
all. In duration and severity, there has been no season to com- 
pare with it since 1795. Sowing in favourable situations did not 
take place till about the 12th of April, and in many cases, even 
then, portions of a field behoved to be left, owing to the remaining 



snow. 



The parish ' is abundantly supplied with excellent water. 
Its springs are numerous; and some of them, in consequence 
of the strata through which . they issue, are more or less ina- 
pregnated with iron. There is a very good chalybeate of this, 
kind in the garden of the writer. No fewer than six burns de- 
scend to the River Don from the glens extending into the moun-

ARERDEENSIIIRE. 



tainous range already mentioned. The largest of these is the 
Esset. Its course, after reaching the cultivated part of the pa- 
rish, and before it discharges itself into the river, is only about 
two miles and a-half ; and in this short passage, it works three 
meal-mills, one flax-mill, and six thrashing-machines. On two 
occasions, viz. in 1829, during the great flood in the north of 
Scotland, and in 1835, owing to a water-spout near its source in 
the hills, it became flooded to a degree almost incredible: the 
inmates of a cottage upon its bank, in the immediate vicinity of 
the manse, were, on both occasions, so sudden was the irruption 
of the overwhelming torrent, with difficulty extricated from their 
perilous situation. Were Tullynessle and Forbes nearer to Aber- 
deen than it is, or to any great manufacturing city, the value of 
its burns, as a substitute for steam in driving machinery, would 
be very great. In many respects, they are highly advantageous 
to the farmer, and, in particular, by enabling him to thrash his 
grain without the labour of horses, they save this most valuable 
part of his stock from the most tearing labour to which they can 
be put. 

Geology and Minej'ulogy. — Under this head little can be said, 
as the substances to which it relates, are in this parish probably 
few in number, and little varied in their nature. The rocks, it is 
believed, are all of a primitive character : granite, with its allies, 
gneiss and mica-slate. The second is .not often to be seen in its 
most characteristic stratified form ; and the most prevailing rock 
may be said to be one intermediate to gneiss and mica-slate. 
Perfect enough specimens of mica-slate are, however, to be met 
with, both in its common form, and in that of the undulated and 
slaty varieties of Jameson. There are two quarries of this na- 
ture, which are worked to a considerable extent, for the purpose 
of furnishing pavement to halls and kitchens. The slabs found 
in them, more particularly in the one situated in Coreen, can fre- 
quently be procured of a very large size. One or two porches to 
farm-houses, which the writer has seen, and where each of the 
side walls consists of a single slab of about five feet in breadth, 
and nearly double the height, with a pavilion roof of the same 
material, have a very light and handsome appearance. The slabs 
are often used in place of wood for the water-courses of thrashing- 
mills, and sometimes in byres for the cattle's stalls. There is 
likewise a granite quarry upon the Forbes property, near the ri- 
ver, of excellent quality, which has been wrought for several years ; 



TULLYNESSLE AND FORBES. 43 



and in the immediate vicinity of a town, would yield a handsome 
revenue to the Noble proprietor. Some attempts were made 
about two years ago,- to open in Corinne a quarry of roofing-slate, 
but although appearances were favourable, they were given up, in 
consequence of the expense. Limestone is to be met with here 
and there are the remains of a kiln for burning it upon one of 
the shanks of the hill, which goes by the name of the L.mei- Shank; 
but the quantity of the lime does not appear to be such as would 
remunerate the manufacturer. Close by the public road which 
leads to Huntly, where it has been found necessary for the level 
to make a cut of several feet, there is to be seen, towards the foot 
of the northern range of hill, a small vein of silicious sand, ex- 
tending into the hill, seemingly of decomposed quartz, but ren- 
dered unavailable for the purposes which it would otherwise serve, 
owing to a small admixture of iron.' 

Botany.— The following vegetable species are natives of the 
parish, and may deserve to be mentioned, viz.— 

Potamogeton pusiUum Vaccinium Vitis-idea Cardamine amara 
CamTanulalatifolia Arbutus Uva-Ursi Fumana claviciaata 

Trientalis Europa Pyrola rotundifolia Habenana albida 

The writer may perhaps mention that Habenana bifoha, though 
common enough throughout the kingdom, occurs but sparingly in 
this parish, and, according to better information than his own on 
this subject, has scarcely been observed in any other part of the 
vale of Alford. It likewise appears somewhat remarkable, that 
common water-cress grows here in but small quantity, and is sel- 
dom or never observed in any of the adjacent parishes ; and it is 
worthy of notice that in the river Don, upon the west border of 
the parish, Enanthe crocata esteemed one of the most poisonous 
plants in Britain occurs in one or two spots, being probably trans- 
planted from the Den of Kildrummy, where it is to be met with in 
considerable abundance. The most interesting feature, however, 
in the vegetation of the parish, is LinntBu borealis, which was dis- 
covered at no great distance from the manse in 1826, by the late 
Dr A. Murray of Aberdeen, in whose recent death the science of 
medicine, as well as of botany, has suffered a heavy loss. The 
patch where it grows is small, but the plants are numerous, the 
Linnceahemgmixedmth faccinuim Vitis-Jdea, Arbutus Uva-Ursi, 
and the whole overtopped with common heath. The Linncva is 
understood to be found in Scotland either in old woods or in al- 
pine places, but the station mentioned is not greatly above the

level of the parish, and, though rather shaded, no wood appears 
ever to have existed there. 

Forests and Plantations. — Upon this subject the writer feels 
happy in being able to communicate the following valuable in- 
formation, with which he has been favoured by the Honourable 
the Master of Forbes, who is proprietor of the lands of Brux, 
which are situate in this and the neighbouring parishes. Since 
the year 1816, he has planted or sown above 2000 acres, 
and the following is the result of his extensive experience. — " The 
larch, spruce, and Scots fir are thriving well both on Coreen and 
Caille-var, and on the lower parts of those hills, oak, ash, elm, 
Spanish chestnut, plane, and gean-trees, grow rapidly. Although 
occasionally nipt by the climate in winter, they average annually 
a valuable increase of wood, both in height and circumference. I 
do not think that the raising of oak and Spanish chestnut from the 
seed, without transplanting, has had a sufficient trial in this part 
of the island. It seems to me that it would answer better than 
planting seedlings from a nursery. Those that I have raised 
from seed, in land not broken up from heath, have succeeded 
well ; the higher parts of the hills have, after burning the heath, 
been very successfully sown with larch and Scots fir ; but the 
larch raised in this way, as well as those which have been trans- 
planted, are not free from the general disease so common to this 
species of wood in this quarter." It may be remarked, that, if the 
common etymology of the name " Caillevar" be correct, viz. 
" Caille," a wood, and " Var," a hill, i. e. " the hill of wood," it 
has once more, through the spirited exertions of the proprietor, 
become entitled to its ancient appellation, being at the present 
moment a thriving forest. It may be here added, that, along the 
banks of the Don, there is a considerable quantity of alder, with 
some birch, and on the Forbes part of the river, a little hagberry, 
 Prunus Padus J. Upon the estate of Whitehaugh, some hun- 
dred acres of full-grown park wood, chiefly larch and fir, have for 
the last twenty years added considerably to the annual revenue 
of the property, and the size of many of the trees, all of which 
were planted by the grandfather of Colonel Leith, the present pro- 
prietor, holds forth a strong encouragement to improvements of 
this description ; and this encouragement has not beei lost upon 
the latter. 

Zoology. — The wild animals to be found in this parish are, it 
is believed, common to most other parts of Scotland, similarly 



TULLYNESSLE AND FOllBES. 445 

situated. In the hills are to be found, grouse, black-game, 
where the hills have been planted, hare, plover, and during 
the breeding-season, some wild-ducks near the mouths of the 
springs, and upon the banks of the streamlets issumg from them. 
Theie is likewise a superabundance of the enemies of game, viz. 
the fox, raven, and hawk. The most destructive of this last men- 
tioned enemy is what is here called blue-sleeves. It is 
much larger than the sparrow-hawk, and considerably smaller than 
the buzzard. The Alpine or white hare, is, sometimes met with. 
There are plenty of roe-deer in the woods ; and during a severe 
winter they do much injury to the trees by stripping them of their 
bark. A red-deer is sometimes seen, but only as a bird of pas- 
sage. 

Owing to the obstructions to their passage up the river, occa- 
sioned by the stake-nets near its entrance into the sea, the cruives 
and cruive-dikes, at some distance above, and the abstraction of a 
great portion of its waters for driving the machinery of a large ma- 
nufactory in the vicinity of Aberdeen, the number of salmon in 
this part of the Don is very small. There is, however, an abun- 
dance of very fine trout, some of them of very large size. The 
writer has more than once killed them of the weight of nearly five 
pounds, and has heard of instances where they weighed conside- 
rably more. It is, however, but very seldoni that the angler meets 
with such prizes ; but, in favourable weather, during the season, if 
possessed of the requisite knowledge of his craft and patience, he 
will find no difficulty in filling his basket with some dozens of a 
smaller size, from one-half to one and a-half pounds weight. The 
•flesh of the larger sized ones, when in good condition, is of a co- 
lour betwixt that of salmon and the smaller trout. The par and 
small-trout are very plentiful in the Esset, as well as in the river. 
October and November are the months in which the salmon gene- 
rally ascend the river for spawning ; but some of them make their 
appearance for this purpose much later. They return in Decem- 
ber, and the beginning of January; Several of them, however, 
remain so late as the beginning of the month of March. 

II. — Civil Histouy. 
Estates. — A short notice of the estates in this parish, and their 
present proprietors, will in a great measure supply what has 
to be said on this head of its statistics. They are, 1. The Jands 
of Forbes, which belong to the Noble family of the same name. A 
small portion of these lands were, about twenty years ago, sold to the 



446 



ABEHDEENSHIRE. 



Honourable the Master of Forbes, in consequence of their conti- 
guity to his property of Brux, and, more especially, to the roman- 
tic situation upon which he has, since that time, built a comforta- 
ble house. All the rest belongs to the head of the family, James 
Ochonchar, Lord Forbes, who is Premier Baron of Scotland, a 
General in the army, and Knight of the Royal Sicilian Order of 
St Januarius. By far the greater part of the life of this amiable 
and distinguished nobleman has been spent from home in the ser- 
vice of his country ; and his conduct in the various important situa- 
tions he has filled, as weW as the deep interest he has uniformly 
evinced in the welfare and prosperity of his tenantry, clearly pro- 
nounce him to be a worthy descendant of one of the oldest and 
most distinguished families in Scottish history. 

2. The estate of Terperse or Dalpersie formerly belonged to 
a cadet of the house of Gordon. The fate of the last of this fa- 
mily who inherited the lands, may be mentioned as one of the nu- 
merous acts of barbarous severity which were exercised upon the 
unfortunate rebels of 1745. Having escaped death in the bloody 
field, Mr Gordon had contrived to elude detection for a conside- 
rable time, by concealing himself in the hills close to his house. 
But anxious, as it would appear, to obtain for one night a more 
comfortable repose than could be afforded by his mountain-cave, 
he imprudently repaired to his mansion for this purpose, and, in 
consequence, no doubt, of information, was apprehended by a party 
of the King's troops. There being some doubt regarding the iden- 
tity of their prisoner, the party endeavoured, but in vain, to have 
it solved, by carrying him before the minister of the parish ; but 
they were more fortunate, upon repairing to a farm upon the other 
side of the hills, which was rented by Mr Gordon, and where his 
wife and family then resided. For his children, on seeing their 
father, came running towards him, exclaiming, " Dady, dady," 
and, unwittingly to themselves, became aiding in consigning their 
parent to the block. His property was forfeited, and came into 
the possession of the York Company. It was purchased from tliem 
by a gentleman of the same name with the late proprietor, and 
connected, it is believed, with the same family. The present pro- 
prietor is James Adam Gordon, Esq. 

There is upon the property an old mansion-house, inhabited by 
the farmer who rents the surrounding grounds. It is in the old 
castle style, bqt of small dimensions, and there is nothing about it 
worthy of particular notice. 



TULLYNESSLE AND FORBES. 



447 



'. 3. Whitehaugh, the property of Lieut- Colonel J. J. F. Leitli, 
H. E. I. C. S., who is a regular descendant of the ancient family 
of the Forbes's of Tohon. , 

The first of this family, who succeeded to this estate through 
the female branch, and adopted the sirname of Leith, was John 
Forbes Leith, whose history is well entitled to a short notice in a 
work of this description. He had received an university educa- 
tion at Oxford, and resided chiefly in England until about the 
year 1735, when he came to reside upon his property. A man- 
sion-house nearly in ruins, and a tenantry, not only ignorant ot 
the improved modes of agriculture, but wedded to old practices, 
must have been considerable discouragements to an Oxonian, and 
a gentleman accustomed to the comforts of a more advanced state 
of'' civilization : but in place of flying from, he determined to re- 
move them, and lived to enjoy the fruits of his resolution in a 
comfortable mansion, with suitable garden, a well improved per- 
sonal farm, several hundred" acres of thriving wood, and an in- 
creased and increasing rent-roll. His son and successor more 
than followed up the example which had been set him. He took 
under his own management a large portion of the estate, which 
had been before a number of unproductive possessions, and con- 
verted it into one beautiful farm of regular fields, tastefully laid 
out, and fenced with hedge-rows, and the whole surrounded by 
thriving wood. His labours now yield to his successor a hand- 
some rent. His attention was particularly directed to the im- 
provement of the breeds of cattle which, in his time, were in this 
quarter of a very inferior description ; and at a very considerable 
expense he brought from a distance, and was the means of in- 
troducing amongst his tenantry, and throughout the district, ani- 
mals of a much better kind. 

: It may be mentioned that a considerable portion of this estate 
at one time belonged to the Knights- Templars. One field of the 
farm which has been particularly noticed is called Temple Close, 
and another St John's Close. Although the Templars, we be- 
lieve, had but one settlement in Scotland, viz. the Hospital of St 
Germains in Lothian, they enjoyed the funds of several churches, 
and houses in various parts of the country. 

Modern Buildings.— In this class may be mentioned the very 
handsome mansion which is now being finished at Whitehaugh. 
The proprietor has, with equal good taste as feeling, retained the 
very substantial, and for the time splendid dwelling of his an- 



448 



ABEIlDEENSHlilE. 



cestor, and, by adding two large wings of a corresponding charac- 
ter, has contrived to give to the whole a very imposing efiect. We 
have already noticed the mansion of the Honourable the Master 
of Forbes, proprietor of the lands of Brux and others, which is 
likewise situated in this parish. It stands near the river Don, 
and is completely surrounded with his thriving plantations. Cal- 
lievar rises in solemn majesty before it on. the south, and Lord 
Arthur's cairn raises its head immediately behind it on the north. 
The pubhc road which introduces you through this mountainous 
pass from the higher country to the vale of Alford, winds by the 
banks of the river, and the mansion, both in its character and lo- 
cality, corresponds well with the other romantic beauties of this 
short drive. 

Parochial Registers. — The session are in possession of a regis- 
ter belonging to Forbes. Its earliest date is 1729, and the latest 
1752. Another of the same parish is in the hands of the minis- 
ter of Auchindoir, which, it is believed, relates to the period from 
1752 to 1808, when Forbes was annexed to this parish, and 
Kearn to Auchindoir. The register of TuUynessle commences 
in 1760, and comprehends Forbes since the date of the junction. 
It appears to have been tolerably kept. 

Eminent Men.—The Rev. Walter Syme. Of this gentleman, in 
as far as his own character and talents are concerned, it is sufficient 
to say that both were good ; but it is not perhaps generally known 
that the present Ex- Chancellor, Lord Brougham, is a near de- 
scendant of his. His Lordship's history will obtain a conspicuous 
place in the annals of his day. Whatever may be the general 
verdict awarded him by posterity, the meed of unrivalled ora- 
torial powers will, without doubt, be unanimously conceded ; and 
it is with a feeling somewhat akin to pride, that the writer gives 
the following account of his Lordship's relation to a predecessor in 
the manse of TuUynessle. The eldest son of the Rev. Walter 
Syme, now mentioned, named James, was a short time mmister 
of Alloa, and married a daughter of Principal Robertson of Edin- 
burgh. The only daughter of Mr James Syme, named Eleanora 
' Syme still alive, was mfWied to Henry Brougham, Esq. of 
Brougham Hall, Westmoreland, and is the venerable mother of 
the present Lord Brougham and Vaux. 

Maps.— There is a recent map of the county, which was exe- 
cuted by a Mr Robertson, at the request of the county gentlemen. 

• The lady is since dead.

TULLYNESSLE AND FORBES. 



449 



Of its correctness the writer is unqualified to pronounce 
iud-ment; but, according to his present recollection, there were 
objections made upon this score, when it was completed, to the pay- 
ment of the sum which had been promised to Mr Robertson for 
the work. In regard to the height of several mountams where Mr 
Robertson has diflfered from the late Dr Keith, in his county sur- 
vey, the labours of the gentlemen employed by Government in the 
great trigonometrical survey of the kingdom have confirmed the 

accuracy of the latter. . . 

Antiquities.— Near the river, and in the immediate vicinity ot a 
small village, named Mongarry, there is the site of General 
Baillie's encampment on the night previous to his defeat by Mon- 
trose, in the battle of Alford, 1645. 

Before the improvements, which have taken place in agriculture 
within the last thirty years, there were several remains of Druidical 
temples, as they have been called, but, with the exception of one, 
they have all been removed. The following account of the appear- 
ances which presented themselves to the workmen who were em- 
ployed in trenching and levelling the site of one of these with the 
surrounding ground, has been communicated by the gentleman 
who then rented the farm on which it was situated, and carefully 
watched the operations. The upright stones were mostly gone ; 
but it was evident that they had enclosed a circle of about fifty 
feet diameter. The ground on which the temple stood was slop- 
ing, and within the circle it had been levelled by removing the 
earth on the upper side, so as to present on this part of the circle, 
a bank nearly perpendicular, of not less than five feet, gradually 
decreasing to the east or lower part, when it became level with the 
natural surface. The upright stones were on the top of the bank. 
From the circle in a south-east direction, an artificially paved road 
could be traced to the distance of at least six hundred yards 
through a bog, which, at the farther end, was about six yards wide, 
but near twenty yards when it approached within fifty yards of the 
circle, and here the paving was covered with ashes. The stones 
of the pavement were not squared, but very neatly fitted into each 
other. On the upper or north-west side of the circle, although 
the ground here was very dry, there was likewise a considerable 
size of pavement, not under one hundred yards long by about forty 
wide. The greater part of the stones of this latter pavement had 
evidently been brought from a hill about three miles distant. 
There was no pavement within the circle. About fifty yards

above the circle, there were found two stone ladles, lying not far 
from each other. The handle of one of them had been broken 
off; that of the other was about nine inches long, with a knob at 
the end of it, evidently for the purpose of preventing it, when used, 
from ftvUing into the vessel, by laying hold of its edge. A similar 
stone ladle was, a considerable time ago, found when clearing out 
another Druidical circle on the farm of Whiteside. 

III. — Population. 

In the year 1811, by Government census, the populafSon was 540 
1821, by Do. Do. . • 643 

18iJ],by Do. Do. . • 778 

1837, by an account taken by the writer, 783 
Of whom there were under 15 years . 250 

betwixt 15 and 30, . 253 
30 and 50, . 157 
50 and 70, . 99 
above 70, . • 24 

There are of inhabited houses in the parish, 136. Uninhabited none. 
The average number of births for seven years is 12f 
of marriages, . 4f 

of blind, . . 1 

The population, according to Dr Webster, in 1755, was, for 
Forbes and Kearn, 436 ; for Tullynessle, 269. The writer has 
not the means of ascertaining how many of the first number be- 
longed to Forbes, and how many to Kearn, and, consequently, is 
unable to show distinctly the great increase of population which 
has, since that period, taken place in the now united parish of Tul- 
lynessle and Forbes. 

There is only one resident proprietor, viz. Colonel Leith of 
Whitehaugh. The mansion-house of Little Wood Park, belong- 
ing to the Honourable the Master of Forbes, the only other pro- 
prietor's house situated within the parish, is at present rented by 
the gentleman who farms the neighbouring grounds. 

The whole population may strictly be said to be agricultural. 
There are no doubt wrights, smiths, shoemakers, masons, and 
tailors located over the parish, but in no greater numbers than what 
is required for its -wants; and they generally rent a small posses- 
sion. Besides the resident proprietors, there are two or three gen- 
tlemen in possession of farms, whose income does not wholly de- 
pend on the produce of the ground. It is to be hoped that their 
agricultural occupations yield them profit as well as pleasure. 

Character of the People.— The character and habits of the 
people, are both good. Generally speaking, they are active and 
persevering, temperate, honest, and charitable. In every commu- 
nity, there will be exceptions to any tribute of commendation to 



TULLYNKSSLE AND FORBES. 



451 



which the bulk of that community may be entitled ; but it is be- 
lieved, that the number of exceptions in the present case, if not 
smaller, does by no means exceed what will be found m any agri- 
cultural population, of equal extent, throughout Scotland. 

Habits.— Within the last thirty years, great improvements have 
taken place in the modes of living and dress. The houses of 
tradesmen and crofters are much more comfortable and clean ; 
while those of the farmers are commodious, in general suitable in 
size to the extent of their farms, and such as their industry and 
enterprize well entitle them to possess. Slates are now the com- 
mon roof for form-houses, and those of tradesmen. It may be 
with truth affirmed, that although at times, in consequence of a 
numerous family, and unforeseen disaster, exposed to considerable 
privations, the crofter and labourer now enjoy luxuries, if they may 
be so called, to which even the farmers were fifty years ago entire 



strangers 



The anti-agriculturist would make you believe that the farmer 
has reached a stage of comfort and external show to which he is 
not entitled, and, in place of enabling him to maintain his present 
status, by means of due protection, would reduce him to the drud- 
gery and spare living of last century. We perhaps touch upon a 
forbidden topic, but one passing remark may be allowed. Let the 
persons of whom we speak be impartial, and advocate a similar 
descent in the case of the merchant and manufacturer. Their 
rise is still greater than that of the farmer. In the case of all of 
them, it is the fruit of increased intelligence and enlightened enter- 
prize. They are now, in as ftir as present prosperity is concern- 
ed, indissolubly linked together, and you cannot harm the one with- 
out injuring the other. 

From the general dryness of the soil, and the improvement in 
climate, which has no doubt been superinduced by the recovery of 
waste land, draining, and planting, the parish is favourable to 
health. We have our share of diseases common to the north of 
Scotland, but no disease peculiar to the parish. In the last Sta- 
tistical Account for Forbes which now forms part of this parish, 
it is mentioned that there prevailed almost universally among the 
parishioners a species of latent scurvy ; and Malthus, in one of 
the editions of his work on population, has, according to the in- 
formation of the writer, noticed the circumstance as one of the 
checks interposed by Providence to counteract the great tendency 
which population has to exceed the means of subsistence. The 



452 ABERDEENSHIRE. 

.V, 

learned Professor would have been somewhat astonished to have 
been told the truth, viz. that this destructive, and, according to the 
description, most loathsome disease, in as far as Forbes was concern- 
ed, existed only in the writer's diseased imagination. The latter, 
who was otherwise a sensible and well-informed person, happened, 
at the time he wrote the account, to be labouring under severe 
hypochondria, which is abundantly evident from the note append- 
ed, in which he hypothetically mentions his own case. 

IV. — Industry. 

No. of acres in cultivation in the whole parish, . . 2681 

in pasture on the lands of Forbes and Whitehaugh, 889 

in roads and burns on said properties, . . 175 

in hill on do. do . . . . 3321 

in plantations on do. do. . . . . 1063 

The survey and measurements of Forbes and Whitehaugh, 
from which the above table was taken, were made about ten years 
asro. Since that time, considerable additions have been made to 
the extent of cultivated ground in the parish. With the exception 
of the arable land there has, to the best of the writer's knowledge, 
been no exact survey of the Torperse estate. The late proprie- 
tor stated to the writer the amount of acres in hill pasture, roads, 
and burns to be about 2000. There are a few acres in wood round 
the old mansion-house. 

The soil is in general good, and exceedingly grateful for kind 
treatment. Upon the rising grounds, more especially along the 
Braes of Forbes, which include the greater part of the Forbes es- 
tate, it is thin and stony ; but being dry, and on a good bottom, 
produces crops excellent in quality, and not deficient in bulk. 
The corn and bear grown here, and in most other parts of the pa- 
rish, is generally superior in weight to the produce of the same 
kinds in most other parts of Aberdeenshire. It deserves to be 
mentioned, perhaps, that, upon the slopes of some of the interject- 
ed rising grounds, the depth of soil is very considerable, and that 
upon the very tops of some of the hills you meet at times with a 
considerable extent of table- land of the same description. The 
elevation, however, and consequently the want of climate, with 
the difficulty of access, forbid cultivation. 

Husbandry. — The following is the mode of cropping which is 
generally followed, viz. two successive crops of oats, followed by a 
cleaning crop of turnips and potatoes. Then a crop of oats or 
bear, when the ground is laid down with grass-seeds; which, the 
first year afterwards, is cut and made into hay, and then pastured 



TULLYNESSLE AND FORBES. 



453 



for the two following years. A shorter rotation has been partially 
adopted by one or two individuals ; but the result of their expe- 
rience has not obtained many imitators. It is beheved by many 
intelligent and experienced farmers, that, with the soil and cli- 
mate of Aberdeenshire in general, the consequence of a short ro- 
tation, and the over -excitement which it requires, is a state of ex- 
haustion almost irreparable. 

Oats, and bear or big with a little barley, are the kinds of 
grain upon which the farmer depends. He may at times sow a 
patch of wheat for family use, which in good years answers re- 
markably well ; but there is no chance of its coming into general 
cultivation. With almost no exceptions the grounds throughout 
the parish are remarkably well adapted for turnips, which, with 
potatoes, are used for a cleaning crop. The latter are chiefly cul- 
tivated for family use. In some cases, they are given to horses, 
and sometimes, in winter, when the snow is deep, or in spring, 
when an early vegetation has rendered the turnip useless, they 
serve the farmer in great stead for enabling him to carry on his 
feeders, or to bring his rising stock of cattle in good condition to 
the grass. But hitherto they have not been grown to such an extent 
as to serve as a staple article for either of those purposes. Bone- 
dust is now used very generally where there happens to be a short 
coming in the quantity of animal dung, and answers remarkably well. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce may be 
stated as follows : — 

Oats and bear, reckoning six returns, and calculating, according to the ave- 
rage fiar-price of last seven years, - , - - - L. 3102 
Turnips and potatoes, at L. 4, 13s. per acre, _ . - 1818 
Hay, at L. 3, 10s. per acre, . - . - - 1340 
Pasture of arable ground, at L. 1, 10s. per acre, - - , - ■ 1149 
Pasture not arable, at 3s. per acre, ... - 202 

On many of the farms, the average return hei'e adopted would 
be very much exceeded ; but, taking the inferior ones into the 
account with the croft-lands, which are not always the best ma- 
naged, it is believed to.be a pretty correct approximation to the 
truth. The price of seed has to be deducted from the amount 
stated. For several years past, the breadth of land sowu with bear 
has been gradually diminishing. In the above statement, it has 
been taken at one-third of what is laid down with grass seeds 
after turnip. 

The great improvements which have taken place in the ma- 
nagement of the ground, within the last twenty years in particular, 



45 V ABEllDliENSIIIRE. 

have been followed by a corresponduig advancement in the size 
and quality of both horses and cattle. The Aberdeenshire breed 
of the latter at one time held nearly the exclusive possession of 
all the grass in the parish ; but recently a valuable cross-breed, 
betwixt the pure Aberdeenshire cow and Tees-water, or short- 
horned bull, has been introduced by several farmers, and their 
example promises to be very generally followed. Now that feed- 
ing for the London market has, in consequence of the facility of 
conveyance by steam-vessels, become common, the great object 
is to select such breeds as promise, in the shortest time, both on 
account of size and fat, to bring the highest remunerating price. 
But the Aberdeenshire, after a certain age, is, in respect of qua- 
lity, very generally allowed to be superior to all others ; and the 
different agricultural Associations throughout the country, while 
they give due encouragement to such crosses as are likely to prove 
profitable to the farmer, ought to pay particular attention to the 
due preservation of the pure Aberdeenshire breed. 

The rotation of cropping which has been mentioned, clearly 
shows that the farmer has much dependence upon his cattle. 
For a considerable time past, owing to the generally low price of 
grain, the profits arising from them have mainly contributed to- 
wards the regular payment of his rent. - It is chiefly for the rear- 
ing of young stock that cows are kept. At the same time, the 
returns from dairy produce and the poultry yards are very consi- 
derable ; but any attempt to give an exact statement of their an- 
nual amount, as confined to this parish, would only lead int 
error. A great proportion of the butter, cheese, and eggs, is 
purchased by our only shopkeeper, Mr Wilson, at Waterside of 
Forbes ; and he has stated the average of money paid by him on 
this account, for some years past, at L. 650 per annum, notwith- 
standing the scarcity of pasture last season. But, on the one hand, 
Mr Wilson deals with the surrounding parishes ; and, on the other, 
several of the inhabitants of Tullynessle and Forbes are in the 
habit of selling to other merchants, who have regular appoint- 
ments for this purpose with their customers at stated places, ge- 
nerally once every fortnight. 

Leases.— The usual length of leases is nineteen years, and, in ge- 
neral, a reasonable allowance is made for houses and fences. The 
common terms for the payment of rent are Whitsunday and Mar- 
tinmas. In the opinion of the writer, Candlemas and Lammas 
, would, in several respects, be more advantageous for the farmer. 



TULLYNESSLE AND FORBES. 



455 



By the present arrangement, he is frequently obliged, in order to 
meet the Martinmas demand, to thrash out a greater quantity ot 
orain than would be requisite for procuring the necessary fodder 
for his cattle. The straw, before being used, is thus rendered 
much less vakiable, and the grain, more especially in late seasons, 
is carried to market in a state of damp, which renders it unfit or 
shipninc. In like manner, should the spring prove unfavourable, 
he is of°en obliged to prepare for the Whitsunday rent, by selling 
his cattle at a time when, owing to want of keep, the prices are 
low ; whereas, by making the rents payable at Candlemas and 
Lammas, both these evils would be obviated ; and this additional 
advantage would likewise be gained, that, as servants' wages are 
due at Martinmas and Whitsunday, the burdens of the farmer 
would be better divided over the year. 

There is an Agricultural Association, comprehending all the pa- 
rishes within the district of Alford, which has been established for 
several years. It is warmly supported by the landed proprietors ; 
and Lord Forbes, the president, with his son, the Master of Forbes, 
has evinced a deep interest in its success. It is not one of the 
least of the good effects of such Associations, that landlord and 
tenant are thus brought into friendly contact with each other, and 
the bond of union, which is so essential to the prosperity of both, 
greatly strengthened. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Towns.— Aberdeen is our principal market-town, and 
is twenty-six and a-half miles distant from the bridge of Forbes, 
where the turnpike-road enters this parish. A considerable quan- 
tity of lime is brought from the quarries at Ardonald and Grange. 
The former is about eighteen miles distant, and the latter nearly 
twenty, and the road to both passes through Huntly ; but almost 
the whole of the grain is carried to Aberdeen. During the winter 
and spring months, there is a monthly market, in the neighbouring 
parish of Alford, for this and fat cattle, which is well attended. 
Two stated fairs for cattle of all descriptions are held annually 
during the summer at the same place. 

Means of Communication. —There is a post-office near the 
bridge, where the Mail-gig arrives daily about three hours after 
leaving Aberdeen. The Lord Forbes stage-coach runs the one 
day to Aberdeen and returns the next. Very considerable addi- 
tions have been made to the Bridge-Inn this season, which, when 
completed, will render it one of the most comfortable to be met

ABERDEENSHIRE. 



with in a country district, with the command of excellent fishing-, 
' beautiful scenery, and a healthy climate ; and placed where the 
northern roads from Huntly to Kincardine, and then through the 
Grampians, crosses that from Aberdeen into Strathdon, it pro- 
mises to become during the summer months a favourite place of 
resort. 

The bridge is a most substantial piece of mason work. It re- 
ceived some injury in 1829, which was immediately repaired. 
About three miles above it, there is a very neat wooden structure 
thrown across the river by the Master of Forbes, directly opposite 
to the mansion-house, which is in character with the surrounding 
scenery, and adds to its beauty. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is neither old nor incommo- 
dious according to its size ; but, owing to the increase of popula- 
• tion, it does not afford sufficient accommodation for the parish. 

An application is about being made to the heritors on the subject, 
to which the writer, judging from the deep interest they have 
always shown in whatever was likely to promote the people's good, 
anticipates a favourable result. Upon one of the stones in the 
belfry, which, from its workmanship, clearly shows that it must 
have originally belonged to a more ancient structure than the pre- 
sent, there is the date 1604. 

The manse was built about thirty-four years ago, and has since 
received some addition. It is both substantial and commodious. 
There is a glebe of about 9 acres, and the stipend, by a recent 
decision of the Court of Teinds, is 16 chalders, half meal, and half 
barley, payable according to the fiars of the year. There is like- 
wise the usual allowance for communion elements, viz. L. 100 
Scots. 

We have no Dissenters of any description in the parish, and the 
people are exemplary in their attendance upon the ordinances of 
religion. It may be mentioned that in the parish there is only 
one church, one school, one inn, and one shop. 

Education. — The school and school-house, which are separate 
buildings, were erected about ten years ago, and do credit to the public 
spirit of the heritors. The schoolmaster's salary is the maximum, 
and the amount of his fees, although low, may, in consequence of 
his zealous attention to the duties of his office, be stated at about 
L.25 per annum. In addition to this, he enjoys the emoluments of 

" The writer's anticipations have, since the time this account was written, beea 
lealizcd.

the session clerkship, which are, however, trifling. But the school- 
masters in this and the two neighbouring counties of Banff and 
Moray have, within these few years, received very considerable 
addition to their incomes, by a noble bequest from a Mr Dick 
of London, whose parents resided in or near Keith. The benefit 
of the fund which he established for this purpose, with a view, as 
he himself states, of raising the standard of literature, and advan- 
cing the comfort of this useful, and meritorious class within the 
three counties mentioned, and which is under the management 
of a certain number of writers to the Signet at Edinburgh, 
is confined to the parish schools. The annual division of the in- 
terest of the fund has hitherto been regulated by an attention 
to other circumstances, besides that of the number of schools, 
such as the number of scholars at each school, success of the 
teacher, &amp;c. The revenue, if equally divided, would afford, 
it is believed, from L.25 to L. 30 Sterling per annum to each 
schoolmaster. 

It is with much pleasure that the writer bears witness to the fa- 
vourable state of education in the parish. There prevails on the 
part of parents a sincere wish to avail themselves of the important 
benefits for their children which are placed within their reach. 
Where the parents are poor, care is taken to remove, in a way 
the least hurtful to their feelings, the obstacle which inability to 
pay the customary fees might otherwise oppose to the attendance 
of their families at school. It has now become the practice to 
commence their education at a more early period of life than be- 
fore, and thus there is time for instruction in the common branches 
of reading and writing, with perhaps a little arithmetic, before the 
children are able to do anything for themselves. Here, and it is 
to be hoped that a similar declaration can with justice be mad&amp; 
in reference to every other parish-school in Scotland, the great 
truth is ever kept in view, that education, to be useful, in rearing 
good and virtuous citizens, must be based on religion. 

A juvenile library has recently been established for the use of 
thescholars, and promises to be attended with much good. There 
are in the parish two female teachers of sewing and dress-making. 
Neither of them enjoy any salary. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number for the last 
five years, of those who have received regular aid, is 8 ; but in ad- 
dition to these, considerable numbers have received occasional sup- 
plies. Of collections at church, the average annual amount for 



4G8 



AUlillDEENSllIRt:. 



the same period is L. 22, 7s. 5d. This is exclusive of collections 
for particular purposes ; such as the Destitution in the High- 
lands, and the four Assembly Schemes ; the average of which 
for the five years is L. 7, 17s. 3d. The session are in posses- 
sion of funds to the amount of something more than L. 300 
Sterling. L. 100 of this sum was left them about twenty years 
ago by a journeyman bookbinder in London, in gratitude for the 
education he had received at the parish school here ; and, as he 
himself states in his latter will, " to be an example to others." 

The pour receive aid partly in meal and partly in money. 
When sick, they are attended by the district-surgeon, to whom 
the session are in the habit of giving a slight compensation for his 
trouble. For some years past, it has been the practice at the com- 
mencement of winter, to purchase for the necessitous and their fa- 
milies, whether on the poor's roll or otherwise, such articles of 
clothing and bedding as they stand most in want of. 

Of itself, our aid would do little towards the comfortable support 
of those who need it. But our poor are pretty equally divided 
over the parish, and around each of them there is a charitable 
circle, which readily supplies the deficiency. In cases of unlook- 
ed for disaster or severe affliction, when requisite, there are always 
in the neighbourhood some benevolent individuals, who are ready 
to start on the errand of mercy through the parish, and never fail 
in procuring the necessary relief. At present, the parochial ma- 
chinery for the care of the poor is in full and undisturbed opera- 
tion. Long may it continue so.

PRESBYTEKY OF GARIOCH, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. ROBERT FORBES, MINISTER. 

T —Topography and Natural History. 
Name.-TnB parish of Monymusk is thought to have been_ so 
named from twoGaelic words monauh, high or h.lly, and mou.ck 
n signifies low and marshy ground ; and this conjecture wouM 
eem to be justified by the appearance of its surface. I extends 
Tout seven miles in length from east to west its greatest breadth 
from four to five. In some places it is much narrower,_which 
makes it of very irregular figure, so as to contain only about twenty 

''Txtentlc.--lt is bounded on the east and south, by the 
parishes of Kemnay and Cluny ; on the west, by the parish ot 
Tough • and on the north-west and north, by the parishes ot 
Keig Oyne, and Chapel of Garioch. It is separated from the 
parish of Tough on the west, and partly bounded on the north, by 
hills of various, and some of them of considerable, though not very 
remarkable, height,— Cairnwilliam, which is the highest, being 
about 1400 feet above the level of the sea. 

Rivers.— The river Don, which rises in the mountains of Cor- 
garfF, and, after an easterly and winding course of about sixty miles, 
falls into the sea at Old Aberdeen, runs through the parish, and 
divides it into two unequal parts, leaving about two-thirds on the 
south, and one-third on the north of its banks. Its mean breadth 
within the parish may be about 35 yards, and depth 2 feet ; ve- 
locity about H mile per hour. 

Rocks.— The rocks of which the hills are composed are chiefly 
granite, of which there is abundance of excellent quality through- 
out the parish, many large blocks of which were quarried some 
years ago by a company in Aberdeen, and removed to London for 
the colonnade of the new market-place in Covent Garden. 

In the last Account of this parish, it is stated that an iron mine 
had been discovered, many years ago, in a hill about a mile distant 
from the church to the north-west, the ore of which had been found 



460 



ABERDEENSHIRE. 



to yield 13-20tli of iron, but that it had never been wrought on ac- 
count of the scarcity of fuel in this part of the country. The work- 
ing of it has never yet been attempted, probably for the same reason. 

In the same hill was discovered, some years ago, a quarry of fel- 
spar, which was wrought for some time by an agent of one of the 
Staffordshire potteries, but has been abandoned on account, chiefly, 
it is said, of the great expense of the land carriage to Aberdeen, 
a distance of twenty miles, from which the stones, broken small and 
packed in large casks, were conveyed by sea to England. . This 
quarry was searched for and discovered, according to the agent's 
account, in consequence of a specimen of the spar, marked Mony- 
musk, having been observed in the British Museum. 

Zoology. — The wild animals found in this parish are of the same 
kinds with those common in the north of Scotland, such as deer, 
roes, hares, rabbits, foxes, &amp;c. Besides the birds more common 
to the country, great numbers of the woodcock and blackcock 
are to be found in the woods and young plantations, as also phea- 
sants in considerable numbers, which, having been lately introdu- 
ced by the proprietor, are now thriving at large. 

The cattle and horses are, upon the whole, of a good breed, to 
which the farmers, in general, are careful to pay- some attention ; 
but there is nothing remarkable in their quality or size to distin- 
guish them from those of the neighbouring parishes. Sheep, of 
which vast numbers were formerly kept in this parish, are now al- 
most entirely banished, being injurious to the young plantations on 
the sides of the hills where they formerly pastured. 

The river Don abounds with salmon and very fine trouts, and 
contains also some pike. The salmon are observed here to come 
up for spawning about the end of September, and to return towards 
the sea about the beginning of April. Their progress depends a 
good deal on the state of the river ; but they are all down by the 
end of the month. 

Forests or Plantations. — There are several extensive woods and 
plantations in the parish, chiefly of fir, to which the soil in general 
appears most congenial; but on the lower grounds, the harder woods, 
such as oak, ash, elm, beech, and plane, birch, alders, and hazel, of 
all which there are considerable quantities, thrive well, and nnany of 
them come to large size. In the old and once beautiful garden of 
Paradise, laid out in 1719, and now forming'part of what is called 
Paradise Wood, there is a number of large spruces and larches 
by the river side, upwards of a hundred years old, several of which

measure from 10 to 11 feet in circumference at the lower part of 
the trunk, and were found, from actual measurement in 1826, to 
be from 90 to 103 feet of extreme height, and to contain from 170 
to 190 cubic feet of timber. The highest and largest of these is 
a larch. One of the trees, a spruce, which separates into two 
equal stems at five feet from the root, where it is 11 feet 2 inches 
in circumference, each rising to 9' feet in height, measures 212 
cubic feet. 

II. — Civil History. 

Land-oioner. — The whole parish is the property of one heritor. Sir 
James Grant of Monymusk, Bart., lineal descendant of Sir Francis 
Grant of Cullen, who was knighted by Queen Anne in 1705, and 
afterwards appointed one of the Senators of the College of Justice 
by the title of Lord Cullen. That gentleman sold the estates of 
Cullen, Eden, Down, and fisheries in Banffshire, and purchased 
the whole lands of Monymusk in 1712, for L. 116,000 Scots, from 
Sir William Forbes, Bart., ancestor of the present Sir John Stu- 
art Forbes of Pitsligo. 

Eminent Men. — Among the eminent characters connected with the 
parish, Lord Cullen deservedly holds a distinguished place, as having 
been a gentleman of the highest respectability, both in private life 
and in his professional capacity. The most profound erudition, un- 
remitting application, and the most inflexible integrity are known 
to have adorned his character, both as an advocate and a judge. 
He manifested through life a deep and lively sense of religion, 
the only true foundation of all real excellence in character ; and 
the fruit of his pious benevolence and parental care for the best 
interests of the successively rising generations on his estate of 
Monymusk, are enjoyed by the parish to this day, in the perma- 
nent provision which he made for facilitating the education of the 
poor, and of those at an inconvenient distance from the parish 
school. 

His eldest son. Sir Archibald Grant, was the first proprietor 
in the north of Scotland who planted upon an extensive scale, and 
introduced turnip husbandry in Aberdeenshire. He also exerted 
himself greatly for the improvement of the public roads throughout 
the district, and took a deep interest in the welfare, both temporal 
and spiritual, of his tenants, as appears, among other things related 
of him, particularly from an address which he had printed and 
circulated among them, entitled " Memorandum to the Tenants 
of Monymusk, January 1756," which contains most excellent ad- 



4G2 



AnERDEENSHlRE. 



■vices and directions as to the management and improvement of 
their farms, with offers of pecuniary assistance, besides premiums 
in carts, and tools, and seeds, to encourage and enable them to 
carry on such improvements as might tend to their prosperity ; and 
in which, after pointing at some of their prevailing vices, he strongly 
recommends and urges on them a virtuous conduct as one great 
mean of success, by drawing down a blessing on their endeavours. 
Nor did his improvements regard the soil alone. It was he who 
first introduced at Monymusk those improvements in sacred mu- 
sic which have since been so generally adopted, having procured 
a qualified teacher for the congregation, and taken an active and 
leading part among the singers himself; whence this, like his 
improvements in agriculture, gradually overcoming the prejudices 
of the people, soon made its way through the surrounding country. 
His successors have also been found indulgent landlords. 

Lord Cullen's second son, William, was also a distinguished 
ornament of the Scottish Bar, and held successively the various 
offices of Procurator to the Church, and Principal Clerk to the 
General Assembly ; of Solicitor- General, and Lord Advocate ; 
was raised to the Bench by the title of Lord Prestongrange, and 
afterwards became Lord Justice- Clerk. 

Another remarkable character connected with the parish, of 
date anterior to the above, was George Lesley, a Capuchin Friar 
of the earlier part of the seventeenth century, whose life and mar- 
vellous adventures were first published in Italian by the Arch- 
bishop of Fermo, and dramatized at Rome in 1673. His bio- 
grapher represents hinti as the son of James, Count Lesley, and 
Jean Wood, his wife, by whom he was early instructed in the 
doctrines of the Reformation, and relates wonderful stories of his 
being miraculously converted to the Roman Catholic faith, while 
abroad at his education, on which he assumed the name of Arch- 
ano-el; of his mother's great giief at the intelligence, and her 
disowning of him in consequence ; of his returning after many 
years to the Castle of Monymusk, leading the people to an ad- 
joining mountain, and converting thousands of them to the true 
faith, and at last the old lady herself, with the other members of 
the family, and the whole establishment of the castle ; with many 
other marvellous deeds and adventures, more like romance than 
true history. 

The only other eminent character of whom the parish has to 
boast as a native, is the late Rev. Dr Alexander NicoU, canon of 



MONYMUSK. 



463 



Christchurch, and Regius Professor of Hebrew in the University 
of Oxford, whose reputation as a general scholar, and a linguist of 
the very highest order, is well known among the learned through- 
out Europe He was born in the village of Monymusk, 3d April 
1793, and received the first rudiments of classical literature at the 
parish school, under Mr Duff, the late schoolmaster. His in- 
tense application to study is supposed to have been a mean of 
shortening his days, which terminated 24th September 1828, in 
the thirty-sixth year of his age. 

Parochial Rec/isters.— There are six volumes of registers belong- 
ing to the parish, of discipline and baptisms, &amp;c. including those 
now running, the oldest of which commences with the admission 
of Mr John Burnett, late minister of Culross, to be minister of 
Monymusk, 18th August 1678. The oldest register of baptisms 
commences 27th May of the same year, and extends to 3d May 
1685, from which time till 19th October 1706, there is no record 
of baptisms. It is also interrupted at some other periods, owing, 
as is recorded, to the loss of notes by some of the clerks. The 
register of baptisms is not very regularly kept at present, owing to 
the neglect of parents in not having their children's names record- 
ed at the proper time, and many of them not at all. 

Antiquities. — There is an old castle in the parish, called Pit- 
fichie Castle, which, with the small property formerly belonging 
to it, is said to have been long in possession of the family of Ge- 
neral Hurry, or Urrie, of some notoriety in the times of the Co- 
venanters. More lately it belonged to the Forbeses, as part of 
the estate of Monymusk, to which it has been long united. The 
Castle has been unroofed for many years. 

About half a mile east from Monymusk House, and close on 
the bank of the Don, there is a field called the Campfield, on 
which, it is said. King Robert Bruce's army lay immediately pre- 
vious to the battle of Inverury, which was the beginning of his 
good fortune, when contending for the crown of Scotland. 

Besides two Druidical circles, one near the village, and the 
other on the side of a hill about two miles south-west of it, and 
the remains of a small chapel, surrounded with what appears to 
have been burial-ground, now covered with full-grown beeches and 
enclosed in the midst of a corn-field north of the Don, the only 
other monument of antiquity found in the parish is one figured 
stone, discovered upwards of forty years ago in a field near the 
river, about a mile east of the House of Monymusk, where it had 



464 



AUEKDEENSIIIUE. 



lain from time immemorial, and was conveyed to the nearest part 
of the public road by order of the late Sir Archibald Grant, and 
there fixed in an upright posture, where it still stands. The figure 
of a cross, about four feet high, with rude ornaments cut into it, is 
very distinct ; and below the cross is a double circle ornamented 
like the cross. It was supposed, at the time, to have been set up 
at first to mark the boundary of the priory lands on that side where 
it was found ; but as that boundary is now believed to have extend- 
ed about a mile farther east, no plausible conjecture can be formed 
at present as to its original use. 

In the month of September 1823, in digging a grave in the 
church-yard, there was found imbedded in the sand, a little below 
the depth to which the same grave had been formerly dug, a gold 
coin about the 'breadth of a shillings or nine-tenths of an inch, clip- 
ped round the edge, and weighing 62 grains. An impression of the 
coin having, with the view of ascertaining its age, and the mean- 
ing of the inscription, been sent to William Marsden, Esq. F.R.S., 
&amp;c. and Author of " Numismata Orientalia Illustrata," or, " The 
Oriental Coins, ancient and modern, of his collection, described 
and historically illustrated," the following account of it was received 
from that learned antiquary : « The impression of the coin shewn 
to me appears to correspond with No. ccch. of the Numismata 
Orientalia, and belongs to a Prince of the Morabetin Dynasty of 

Morocco. . 

«' The substance of the inscription is as follows :— Prmceps 
Yusuf ben Tashfin. Quicunque aham quam Islamismam profite- 
tur religionem, minime ab eo Deo acceptabitur, sed die novissi- 

mo peribit. . 

« Al-Imam Abdallah imperator fidehum. In nomme Dei cu- 
ditus hie denarius in urbe Marakash Morocco. Anno 491.— 
1097." " 22d March 1827. W. M." 

When, or how it may have come to this country can be matter 
only of conjecture : probably in the time of the crusades. It is in 
keeping at Monymusk House. 

Mansion-Houses.—Monymusk House, the only building of note 
in the parish, is an ancient and spacious mansion, having received 
additions since first built, and is pleasantly situated on the south 
bank of the river Don. It has an excellent library, containing 
about 5000 volumes, including some old and valuable editions of 
the classics. There is also a very good collection of paintings in 



MONYMUSK. 



466 



the house, mostly by the old masters, some of which are of con- 
siderable value. 

There is a distillery in the parish ; and a very considerable ma- 
nufactory of wood is carried on, there being two saw-mills and 
seven pair of sawyers in pretty constant employment. The timber 
manufactured within the parish, is cut in the woods both of Mony- 
musk and of the adjoining property of Tillyfour, belonging to the 
same family, in the parish of Oyne ; and, after being sawn into 
planks and deals, is carried to market in districts of the country 
where that commodity is scarce. 

III. — Population. 

The population of the parish cannot be traced, with any great 
degree of accuracy, farther back than the date of the last Statis- 
tical Account. From a comparison, however, of the yearly num- 
ber of baptisms recorded in the oldest register, with the number 
of births at present, the population would appear to have been ful- 
ly greater a hundred and fifty years ago than it is now. 

The excess of the population in 1831 above that in 1821 is to 
be attributed chiefly to the settlement, in several parts of the pa- 
rish, of younger persons who are rearing families. 

The yearly average of births for the last seven years is _ - - 30 

of deaths, as nearly as can be ascertained, about - 12 

of marriages, ... - 6 

The average number of persons under 15 years of age, - 387 

■ betwixt 15 and 30, - - 273 

30 and 50, - 216 

50 and 70, - - 103 

upwards of 70, - - 82 

The Grant family, residing in Monymusk House, is the only 
family of distinction residing in, or connected with, the parish. 

Number of unmarried men, bachelors, and widowers upwards of 50 years of age, 14 
women upwards of 45, - - - 19 

Average number of children in each family, reckoning as such those under 15 

years of age, and 189 families, - - - - 24: 

There are 2 insane persons, both young men, belonging to the 
parish, who have been in the Lunatic Asylum at Aberdeen for se- 
veral years without any prospect of recovery. 

Popular Customs. — There are no popular customs or amuse- 
ments peculiar to this parish at present. Formerly, the foot-ball, 
now the amusement chiefly of school-boys only, as in other places, 
was a favourite exercise with persons of almost all ages in the pa- 
rish, in which parties from other parishes occasionally joined to 
contend for the palm of victory : and " The Monymusk Christmas 
Ba'ing,"" with its various casualties, has been celebrated in a hu- 
morous poem by the late Rev. John Skinner, grandfather of the 

ABEUDEEN. G g

ABERDEENSHIRE. 



present Bishop Skinner of Aberdeen, who was for some time as- 
sistant schoolmaster at Monymusk, and afterwards Episcopal mi- 
nister at Longside, and who, from his great poetical genius, clas- 
sical knowledge, and hterary productions, is not unworthy of a place 
among the eminent persons connected with the parish. 

Habits of the People.— The people are of cleanly habits, and 
dress genteelly, both men and women, on Sundays, and on other 
particular occasions. The ordinary food of the peasantry consists 
chiefly, as throughout this part of the country in general, of the va- 
rious preparations from grain, with cabbage, greens, and potatoes, 
but Uttle of butcher-meat being used by them in common. They 
are, upon the whole, a decent and industrious set of people, and , 
are very regular in their attendance on the ordinances of re- 
ligion. Their situation and circumstances are, as is common, more 
or less easy with different persons, but as comfortable, upon the 
whole, as in the country around, the chief cause of complaint or 
dissatisfaction among them being the heavy tax on malt, which 
puts that necessary and wholesome beverage, a drink of good beer, 
almost entirely beyond the reach of the labourer and poor artisan. 
Neither poaching nor smuggling prevails among them, or is 
practised in the parish. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture.— T\\e number of acres, standard imperial measure, 
in the parish, which are either cultivated or occasionally in tillage, 
is about 5370 ; and of those which remain constantly waste, or 
in pasture, about 3080. A considerable quantity of waste land, 
probably about 300 acres, might still be profitably brought under 
the plough; and the occupiers of farms with such land attached 
are generally bound to improve the whole, or a certain portion of 
of it, during the currency of their leases. 

The number of acres under wood, almost all planted, and great 
part full-grown, may be estimated about 4150. There have also 
been planted within the last twelve years about 930,000 firs along 
the sides of the hills, and about 160,000 oaks and elms in other 
situations favourable to the growth of these trees. The thinning, 
felling, and pruning are well attended to, under the care and ma- 
nagement of an experienced forester. 

Bent.— The average rent of arable land on the larger farms 
may be" stated at L.l per acre. Some of the smaller possessions 
or crofts are higher, averaging about L.l, 12s. The average rent 
of the whole land in tillage is about 15s. per acre.

The average rent or cost of grazing is about L.2, 10s. per ox or 
cow grazed for the season. There are, as ah-eady noticed, very 
few sheep kept in the parish. 

Wages. The rate of labour for farm-labourers is Is. 8d. per 

day in summer, and Is. 4d. in winter; for wrights or house car- 
penters and masons 2s. per day through the year. Sawyers 
receive at the rate of 2s. per 100 feet, equal to about 3s. per day, 
all providing their own victuals ; but these rates are found to vary 
with the value of agricultural produce, and the demand for the 
different kinds of labour. 

A good system of husbandry is carried on in the parish, a re- 
gular rotation of cropping being observed, to which the tenants 
are bound by their leases; and the most approved modern imple- 
ments of agriculture are in general use. 

The general duration of leases is for nineteen years, which term 
is considered favourable to the occupier, as being an encourage- 
ment to improvement, by giving him an opportunity of reaping the 
advantage of it. 

The farm -buildings have been greatly improved of late years,, 
many of them being built with stone and lime, and slated, in con-, 
sequence of encouragement given on the part of the proprietor, 
who supplies the wood gratis, and allows payment at the expiry of 
the lease for mason-work of the walls, and for slating, but not e\- 
ceeding a certain amount or extent of building stipulated in the 
lease, the value to be ascertained by two competent judges, mu- 
tually named, or oversmen, in case of their differing. On some of 
the farms, the fields are well enclosed with stone dikes. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce raised in 
the parish, as nearly as that can be ascertained, may be reckoned 
as follows : — 

Produce of grain of all kinds, . . . L.8020 0 0 

potatoes and turnips cultivated in the fields, . 2970 " 0 0 

hay, .... . . 1970 0 0 

land in pasture, rating it at L.2, 10s. per cow or full-grown 

ox grazed, or that may be grazed, for the season, . 1450 0 0 
the annual thinning and periodical felling of woods and 
plantations, there being little cut in the woods of Mony- 
musk at present, besides dead and decaying wood, . 500 0 0 

Total yearly value of raw produce raised, L- 14,910 0 0 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town. — There is no market-town in the parish, the 
nearest being Aberdeen, distant nineteen miles from the village of 
Monymusk. This small village, containing at present a popu- 



468 ABEIIDEENSHIUE. 

lation of 131 souls, is a place of some antiquity, as Buchan- 
an, in his history of the reign of Malcolm Canmore, mentions, 
that that king lay encamped, ad " Monimuscum vicum," at the 
village of Monymusk, in his way north to quell an insurrection in 
Moray. It has been almost entirely rebuilt of late by the pro- ' 
prietor, and forms a very neat square, with some fine old trees 
growing in the centre. It enjoys the conveniency of a daily post, 
and has at present three weekly carriers to Aberdeen, with which 
it has easy communication by two turnpike roads, one of which 
passes through the parish for four miles and a-half, and joins the 
great north road nearly a mile below Kintore, and the other leads 
through the parishes of Midmar, Echt, and Skene, in a more 
southerly direction, to which there is access at about three miles 
distance from the village, by a good commutation road passing 
through the parish of Cluny, the whole distance of either of the 
roads being pretty much the same. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church stands on the east side 
of the village, the entrance to the churchyard being from the 
centre of one of the sides of the square, and is conveniently enough 
situated for the greater part of the population. Its distance is 
somewhat more than two miles from the eastern, and from four to 
five from the western, extremity of the parish ; but the upper part 
of the parish, which lies among the hills, being but thinly inhabit- 
ed, there are only four families above three miles distant from the 
church. The date of its erection is not certainly known, but it is 
supposed to have been built in the eleventh century, when the 
priory was founded here by Malcolm Canmore, who, having en- 
camped at the village of Monymusk, as already mentioned, vow- 
ed, as Buchanan relates, that, if he returned victorious from his 
expedition to the north, he would devote the village where he lay 
encamped to St Andrew, the tutelary saint of Scotland. Having 
arrived at the Spey, and being about to enter that river, he was 
stopped by the priests, dressed in their canonicals, who, with his 
permission, passed over to the enemy, and finished the war with- 
out any effusion of blood. In fulfilment of his vow he, according- 
ly, founded, endowed, and dedicated the Priory of Monymusk, as 
appears from an old writing in Latin in Monymusk House, bear- 
ing to have been extracted from the register of St Andrews, and 
which, after describing the boundaries of the lands assigned to it, 
which were ample, concludes to this effect : « And thus these are 
the marches which King Malcolm bequeathed, on account of a vie-

tory "ranted to them, to God and the Church of Saint Mary of 
Monymusk, giving the benediction of God and Saint Mary to all 
who preserve the rights of the church." Of the buildings of the 
priory no remains now exist, unless the present parish church, 
which is unquestionably very old, may, as is supposed, have been 
coeval with, and formed part of them. The eastern part of the 
church, commonly called the quire, and now seated for about for- 
ty persons, is connected with the main part of the buildmg by a 
laroe opening through the ejid wall, arched in form of a semi- 
circle. It has a square tower at the west end, 50 feet high, through 
which is the principal entry, with a large iron clock in it, purchas- 
ed by the session in 1699, for L. 145, 6s. 8d. Scots, surmounted 
by a spire 40 feet in height. It was considerably enlarged by the 
addition of an aisle on the north side, newly roofed and seated, 
and had the spire renewed in 1822, and is now a very neat and 
commodious place of worship, and will contain about 580 persons. 
The sittings are all free ; and, with the exception of those in the 
east end already noticed, are apportioned by the heritor among 
the several tenants and householders in the parish, the division 
being subject to alteration at any time, as the circumstances of any 
of the families may require. The unappropriated seats are also 
left free for the accommodation of strangers. 

The present manse was originally built in 1737, and was tho- 
roughly repaired, and enlarged by an additional building in 1824. 
A set of new offices was also built in 1829 ; and it deserves to be 
mentioned, on account of the laudable example in these times, 
that the enlarged church accommodation, on being represented as 
necessary, and the whole of the above-mentioned repairs and 
buildings, to the amount of very nearly L. 1400, were most readily 
agreed to, without any intervention whatever of the ecclesiastical 
court, decreet having been asked merely as a matter of what was 
judged necessary form, to sanction the plans. 

The glebe, exclusive of the garden and site of the manse and 
offices, measures about 7 acres imperial, and may be worth about 
L. 12. 

The stipend, the teinds having been exhausted at last augmen- 
tation in 1824, is L. 162, 3s. 8fd. in money; 51 bolls, 1 firlot, 

" In connection with the history of the church, it may not be unworthy of remark, 
as it is believed to be rather a singular circumstance, that William Allan, the late 
kirk-officer, who left the parish at Whitsunday 1835, is tlie fourth in lineal descent of 
a family who have held that office successively for 133 years previous to the above 
date.

and 1 peck of meal ; and 5 bolls, 3 firlots, and 3| lippies of bear, 
the meal and bear payable at the fiar prices of the year. 

There is an Episcopalian chapel in the village containing 150 
sittings, the number of persons in connection with which, in this 
and the neighbouring parishes, is about 130 ; but, with the excep- 
tion of 28 persons within the parish who belong to that commu- 
nion, and three other Dissenting individuals, all the rest of the po- 
pulation attend the parish church, where Divine service is always 
well attended. The average number of communicants at the Es- 
tablished Church for the last seven years is 506 ; for the last three 
years, 538. 

Education. — This parish is well provided with the means of edu- 
cation. There are two public schools in it, the parochial school, 
and another endowed school called Lord CuUen's School, in each 
of which the usual branches of education are taught, viz. English 
reading, writing, Latin, arithmetic, book-keeping, English gram- 
mar, geography, &amp;c. 

Lord Cullen's School is so named in consequence of its endow- 
ment from a mortification by Sir Francis Grant of Cullen, Bart, 
one of the Senators of the College of Justice, and proprietor of the 
estate of Monymusk, as already mentioned, who, by a deed bearing 
date nth August 1718, mortified 2 chalders of meal yearly out 
of the estate of Monymusk and Aflforsk, to and in favour of such 
country teachers as the minister and kirk-session for the time being 
should name or approve, and in such division yearly as might best 
serve the end set forth in the deed. This continued for a good 
number of years under the management of the kirk-session, as ori- 
ginally intended ; but, owing to circumstances which placed the 
mortification for along time, as it were, in abeyance, the annual value 
of the two chalders was allowed to accumulate to a very considerable 
sum, which, after building an excellent school and schoolmaster's 
house, and enclosing a garden in the year 1824, north of the river 
Don, where the benefit of a teacher was most wanted, and defray- 
ing other necessary expenses, has been invested, for better se- 
curity, in Bank of England Stock. The management of this ac- 
cumulated fund, and of the annual two chalders, according to 
a plan prepared by a committee of the presbytery of Garioch, who 
have the oversight of it, and agreed to on the part of the proprietor 
of Monymusk, and by the kirk-session, and sanctioned by the 
Lords of Council and Session,— is vested in the « Heritor of Mony- 
musk, or the legal administrator of the estate for the time being, 



MONVMUSK. 



471 



the minister of the parish of Monymusk, authorized by, and as 
moderator of the kirk-session, and tlie minister of the parish of 
Chapel of Garioch in which parish He the hands of Afforsk as 
moderator of the kirk-session thereof." The managers meet 
half-yearly in the months of January and July, in terms of the re- 
gulations, for settling the treasurer's accounts, and any other busi- 
ness regarding the school or funds. 

The teacher of Lord Cullen's School receives a salary in meal 
and money, amounting to about L. 50, less or more, according to 
the interest of money and the fiars price of grain; and the parish 
schoolmaster has an allowance from the fund, also in meal and 
money, of from L. 8 to L. 10, variable with interest and price as 
above, for teaching ten or twelve poor scholars, less or more, as 
may be recommended by the kirk-session, and for keeping an 
evening school three months in winter, for which fees are payable 
by the scholars, and a Sunday school in summer. Alike number 
of poor scholars, recommended as above, is also taught gratisat 
Lord Cullen's School, and the poor scholars at both schools are 
furnished from the fund with all the requisite books. There is 
also a small surplus fund, to which the excess ofincome above ex- 
penditure is yearly added, for the purpose of keeping the school- 
house in repair, and meeting any other exigencies necessarily con- 
nected therewith. 

The salary of the parochial schoolmaster, payable by the heri- 
tor, is L. 26, and he also receives from the Trustee of the late Mr 
Dick's bequest to the schoolmasters of the counties of Aberdeen, 
Banff, and Moray, about L. 30, less or more, yearly. 

The yearly amount of fees at the parish school, which is situat- 
ed in the village south of the Don, amid the greater preportion 
of the population, may be about L. 13 at an average, and at Lord 
Cullen's School L. 10. 

The general expense of education per year, in respect of school 
fees, does not exceed from 8s. to 10s., as the fees are low. 

The parochial schoolmaster has an excellent house, with more 
than the legal accommodation, the repairing and enlarging of which 
in 1826 cost about L. 200. He has also a good garden. 

There are no other regular schools in the parish : nor are any 
such necessary. There is, at present, a school for females, but 
unendowed ; and one or two other private schools are occasionally 
kept by aged females, or other uneducated persons, for very young 
children, before they are able to attend the public schools. 



4T2 



ABERDEENSHIRE. 



There are, it is believed, none of the young betwixt six and fif- 
teen years of age who cannot read or write : nor are there any per- 
sons of any age in the parish, capable of being taught, who can- 
not read ; and most of them, both men and women, have been also 
taught to write, as the people, in general, seem sufficiently alive 
to the benefits of education, with the facilities of which this parish 
is so well provided. 

Friendly Societies.T\\Qve are two friendly societies in the pa- 
rish, one of them named " Sir Archibald Grant's Lodge of Gar- 
deners," established in 1808; and the other, « A Benefit Male 
and Female Society," established in 1824. But it is questionable 
whether they have been productive of any great advantage upon the 
whole, the quarterly payments being very low and the benefit de- 
rived by sick and decayed members, seldom, if ever, equal to the 
small allowances promised in their rules and regulations, as has 
been generally the case with Friendly Societies on the old plan. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The average number of persons 
receiving aid from the ordinary poor funds of the parish is 15, for 
whom these funds, after deduction of the fees usually paid by 
the kirk-session, afford, at an average, L. 3 each per annum. As 
actually distributed, however, some have more and others less, ac- 
cording to their various circumstances. 

Besides the number of ordinary poor just stated from 20 to 
25 poor persons receive annually, in the month of January, from 
15s. to L. 1, 10s. each from the dividends on a charitable fund of 
L. 765, 3 per cent, consols, bequeathed to the parish of Mony- 
musk, by the late Dame Jane Johnstone Lady Grant, by her last 
will and testament, bearing date the 12th October 1787; the di- 
vidends on which are, according to a plan for the management and 
application thereof, approved of by a Master in Chancery, and 
sanctioned by the Court, distributed in the month of January year- 
ly, among such poor persons as receive no aid from any other cha- 
ritable fund belonging to the parish. The management of this 
fund is vested in four trustees, all residing within the parish, m- 
cluding always, as first trustee, the minister for the time being. 

The amount of contributions for the relief of the ordinary poor 
arises from the following sources : from church collections, at an 
average, L. 31 ; interest on L. 350, stock at 4 per cent. L. 14, 
yearly donation from Lady Grant of Monymusk, L. 6 ; other inci- 
dental small sums, say L. 3 ; total, L. 53. Extraordinary collec- 
tions of various amount are also made annually for the Infirmary 



MONYMUSK. 



473 



at Aberdeen, and for the support of one of the lunatics belonging 
to the parish; also for the India Mission, Highland Schools, and 
other schemes of the General Assenibly. . 

The poor here, in general, seem to possess that laudable spirit 
of honest independence, which renders them very averse from ap- 
nlvino- for parochial aid, unless compelled by absolute necessity : 
and there have not been wanting instances of poor persons who 
had been in the way of receiving it regularly, having declined it 
as soon as, by a little assistance from their children or friends, they 
could possibly live without it, and of having again had recourse to 
it under another unfavourable change of circumstances. 

Fairs— There are three annual fairs held in the parish, two ol 
them at Whitsunday and Martinmas, chiefly for the engagmg of 
servants ; and the other on the last Thursday of August, for cattle. 

Monthly markets have also been established of late, for the sale 
of cattle and grain, during the winter months, and are held in the 
village on the second Mondays of December, January, February, 

March, and April. . 

7;2„s._ There is a good inn, with excellent accommodation, in 
the village, and an alehouse at the Ferry-Boat, on the opposite 
side of the Don, both which are found necessary at these stations, 
for the accommodation of travellers ; and they are not believed to 
have much, if any, bad effect on the morals of the people in gene- 
ral, as they are kept by persons of respectable character, who dis- 
courao-e drinking to excess in their houses, to which but few of 
the people are much inclined. There is no other public-house 
in the parish. 

Fuel— The most common fuel consists of peat and turf; but, 
as moss is not very plentiful in the parish, a considerable quantity 
of wood is also used, with some coals from Aberdeen, and from 
Kintore, to which they are conveyed in boats by the Aberdeenshire 
canal,— the cost of the boll when brought from either place, includ- 
ing the carriage, and the higher price charged at Kintore, being 
about 7s. 

Miscellaneous Obsebvations. 
Since the time of the last Statistical Account, a considerable 
quantity of waste land, about 480 acres imperial measure, has 
been brought into cultivation ; the plantations have been much 
enlarged, public roads greatly improved, and drainage carried to 
a considerable extent. The establishment of a distillery has been 
already noticed ; and there is little else worthy of remark under

this head, save the superior appearance and neatness of the farm- 
buildings and cottages throughout the parish, which, as already 
observed, have been greatly improved of late years, and are still 
being improved under every new lease.

PRESBYTERY OF GARIOCH, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. GEORGE GARIOCH, MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The ancient name of this parish, and by which Spal- 
ding takes notice of it in his History of the Troubles and Memo- 
rable Transactions in Scotland, is Bethelnie, which is a derivative 
from the Hebrew words llbjn'' Bethelnou, signifying House 
of our God. It appears probable, that, at an early period, when 
sacred edifices were comparatively few in Scotland, the church 
feituated in this parish may have served to accommodate the in- 
habitants of a large extent of surrounding country. For this rea- 
son it may have received the emphatic name of Bethelnie, or 
House of our God ; and the appellation has been at length ex- 
tended to the district in the vicinity of the place of worship, which 
now constitutes the parish. But whether the supposition of a 
great central religious locality be correct or not, undoubtedly the 
parish church was, from the earliest time, situated in that district 
which, to this day, retains the name of Bethelnie. Its site is 
marked by the place of interment which remains, where its foun- 
dations can be seen ; and the farm which formerly surrounded it, 
on which the manse was built, is still called the Auld Kirk. 

The modern name of the parish Meldrum is probably de- 
rived from the Celtic words Mealldruim, signifying the shoulder 
or ridge of a hill. This conjecture is supported by the peculiar 
nature of the locality, as the whole parish occupies a rising ground 
of greater or less degrees of elevation. At the northern extre- 
tnity, the ground ascends to a considerable altitude above the sur- 
rounding valleys, and descends by an easy inclination, presenting 
a variety of rich and well cultivated table-land sloping to the 



MliLDUUM. 



475 



south, the east, and the west. From several pomts of this ele- 
vation, extensive views are obtained of the districts of Formart.ne 
and Buchan on the one hand, and of the cultivated valley of the 
Garioch on the other, bounded on the west by the lofty and well- 
proportioned mountain of Benochie. 

' Lent and Boundaries.-The length of the parish from north 
to south varies in different points from 5 to 8 miles, and its 
breadth from east to west varies from 2 to 5. It is consequenUy 
of an irregular figure, and contains about 1 If square miles. On 
the south, it is bounded by the parish of Bourtie ; on the north, 
bv Fyvie and Tarves ; on the east, by Bourtie and Tarves ; and 
o the west, by Daviot and Fyvie. A ridge of hdls, none of 
which is of any great height, commencing at the northern extre- 
mity of this parish, stretches towards the north-west, but possesses 
no striking characters. The soil on the south and south-west 
aspects is rich and fertile ; and the summits are generally covered 
with heath, but not of that luxuriant description which is common 
on the hills in the higher districts of Aberdeenshire. The pre- 
valent winds during summer, autumn, and the later part of spnng 
are westerly ; and the severity of the northern blast in winter is 
no doubt moderated by the chain of hills already alluded to. 

Climate.— The climate is temperate, but variable in spring; 
hence, during that season, pulmonary complaints are common, 
and others which are dependent on sudden changes of temperature. 

GeoZ«//.— Hornblende rock is found in large detached masses 
in one part of the parish. It admits of the finest dressing, and 
might even be polished like marble ; but the expense of obtaining 
it, on account of its very hard and compact structure, is such, that 
it' is seldom employed for the ordinary purposes of building. 
Whinstone is common in different places; and rock-crystal is 
found in the hill of Bethelnie. Limestone was discovered several 
years ago in this parish, near the boundary line which separates 
it from Tarves, and was wrought with success for some time ; the 
operations, however, have since been discontinued ; but in Tar- 
ves they are still carried on advantageously, close to the borders 
of this parish. The soil of the northern extremity is inferior to 
that of the other districts of the parish. In the former it is more 
friable, of little comparative depth, and incumbent on a subsoil of 
rock or gravel. In this division, also, there is a portion of the 
soil of a mossy nature, and the climate is inferior : throughout 
the whole of it, the harvest is a week later than in the remaining 



476 



ADERDEENSHIllE. 



districts, and the crops raised are deficient both in quantity and 
quahty. A considerable extent of the highest parts of it is co- 
vered with heath, and fit only for planting. With the exception of 
the northern extremity, the soil of the parish is of a superior na- 
ture. It consists of a deep loam, resting generally, though not 
uniformly, on a subsoil of clay, and produces weighty crops of grain. 

Plantations. — Since the last Statistical Account was drawn up, 
more than 500 acres have been planted in this parish. A consi- 
derable extent of the plantations is on the high lands of the 
northern extremity; ,but the greatest part of them is on the 
estate of Meldrum, about the centre of the parish, and in its 
eastern division. In addition to several large plantations which 
have grown with great rapidity, there are numerous detached 
clumps put down for the sake of ornament, which have a very 
pleasing appearance. Along with the different kinds of fir, there 
is a number of thriving ashes and elms ; and of late years, oaks, 
planes, and various ornamental trees have been introduced. 
There are some fine old spreading beeches in the plantations near 
the House of Meldrum ; and there is one in particular in front 
of it, of large dimensions and exuberant foliage. It is 60 feet 
in height and 243 feet in circumference ; the girth of the 
trunk is 1 1 feet 8 inches, and the longest entire branch is 51 
feet. The foliage generally comes close to the ground ; it is 
very thick, and has a regular and rich appearance. There is an- 
other large and remarkable tree an ash supposed to be fully 200 
years old, which stands on a rising ground at Parcook, above the 
town of Old Meldrum. Its position and appearance are altogether 
so singular and striking, that it is well known for many miles around 
by the name of the Tree of Parcock, or simply of the Tree. Be- 
fore the town was built, there was an inn at Parcook, which must 
have been a place of some note in former days, as it is frequently 
mentioned in Spalding's history, and formed at the period when it 
was written, one of the principal stages between Aberdeen and the 
north of Scotland. It is probable, therefore, that the tree of Par- 
cock may have been planted in its present solitary but very con- 
spicuous situation, in order to point out to the traveller from a dis- 
tance, the place where he might rest for a time from the fatigues 
of his journey. 

II. — Civil History. 
There is a plan of the whole parish, of date 1780, in the pos- 
session of the proprietor of Meldrum, who is the principal land-

that period to the present time, with the exception of one year. 

small private chapel, built 
duJ e stablishmentofthe Roman Catholic religion in this 
countL are to be seen on a farm in this parish which for that 
eln till retains the name of Chapelhouse. They are surround- 
ed by a place of interment, in which there is f  PP--"- °f 
Lny giLes; and two bodies have been buried there wi hin the 
memor of the present generation. The baptismal fon , or wha 
traditiol. declares to be such remains, and a well inclo ed wUh 
rude mason-work, which we are given to understand from the same 
source, -was formerly dedicated to the Virgin ; it is called to this 
day the Ladi/ well During the prevalence of Popery, St Watha- 
lin was reckoned the tutelary sainf of this district. 1 here was a 
tradition, that when a dreadful pestilence raged in the country, 
St Nathalin prayed fervently that it might be averted from this 
parish, going round it on his knees; and the fatal disease never 
entered within it. A day called St Nathalin's day was for a 
long period observed in honour of the supposed benefactor,— 
a proof of the powerful influence of superstition over the mind. 
Several persons yet alive recollect that, in their early years, St 
Nathalin's day was still so far attended to tliat no work was per- 
formed on it throughout the parish. Until a very late period, a 
market-day was held in Old Meldrum annually in the month of 
January, which was called Nathalin's fair. About half a mile 
from the ruins of the chapel lately alluded to, there was found by 
labourers employed in repairing a road a few years ago, a rude 
enclosure of stones about 3i feet under ground ; two long stones 
formed the sides, and two short ones the ends of the enclosure, 
and the whole was covered by one large broad stone. The space 
enclosed was 4 feet by 2 feet 6 inches, and it contained an earthen 
urn, a human scull, and some of the bones of the extremities. 
Two urns of a similar nature were discovered in the same neigh- 
bourhood, not enclosed by stones, but deposited under a rough 
pavement. The remains of a Roman encampment existed until 
lately on the farm of Bethelnie; they have now been levelled and 
the ground is ploughed. The encampment was a very small one, 
and could only have given lodgement to a detachment from the

army. There is still a place of interment at Betlielnie, where tlie 
church of this parish formerly stood. Several families have their 
burial ground in it, and the sepulchral vault belonging to the pro- 
prietors of Meld rum is there. The present church is supposed to 
have been erected about the year 1684 ; it is consequently an old 
building, and has an antiquated appearance. In the immediate 
vicinity of Old Meldrum, there is a place of worship belonging to 
the Scottish Episcopalians, and in the town, there is another be- 
longing to the members of the United Secession. The town- 
house and town-hall of Old Meldrum are respectable-looking build- 
ings, sufficiently adapted to the size of the place. The House of 
Meldrum, which is about a mile distant from Old Meldrum, is a 
large and elegant mansion, well sheltered and ornamented with wood.

Previous to the year 1672, when the town of Old Meldrum be- 
gan to extend itself, the population of this parish m.ust have been 
very limited. An increase of 117 took place between the years 
1811 and 1821, which arose, in all probability, in consequence of 
a number of crofts being set on previously uncultivated land, which 
has since been reclaimed and brought under cultivation by the oc- 
cupiers. These little additional possessions are principally on the 
estate of TuUo, in the northern district of the parish. Between 
J 821 and 1881, the increase was only 18. The population of 
the town of Old Meldrum was, according to the former Statistical 
Account, 783 ; for many years past, its population has been about 
1000. In the rural districts of the parish, the number of the in- 
habitants is 790. The average number of marriages yearly is 15 ; 
and of births 45. There is no register kept of deaths.

The people enjoy in a reasonable degree the comforts and advan- 
tages of society, and are contented with their situation and cir- 
cumstances. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture.~The number of acres, standard imperial measure, 
in this parish, which are either cultivated or occasionally in tillage, 
is about 5774; and the number of acres which never have been 
cultivated, but are planted or remain constantly waste, is about 
1700. Of this last number, a small proportion upon the hill, ot 
Bethelnie appears to have been formerly under tillage. It is most 
likely, however, that, owing to the poverty of thelsoil, the crops had 
not paid the expense of cultivation, and the land had been allowed 
to fall back into its natural state. Indeed, almost the whole land 
in this parish that has not already been brought under cultivation, 
would be turned to most profitable account by being planted. There 
is an undivided common near Old Meldrum, extending to about 
25 acres. The'rent of the best land around the town of Old Mel- 
drum is L.4, lOs. per Scotch acre, and of inferior quality, L.3, 10s. 
In the country districts, the average rent of the best quality of 
land per Scotch acre is L. 2, and of inferior quality from 5s. to L. 1. 

Farm-work is mostly performed by servants hired for 
the half year ; the average rate of their wages is L. 5 in winter, 
and L. 6, 6s. in summer. Servants of a superior description ob- 
tain higher wages. Day labourers, in winter, earn Is., and in sum- 
mer. Is. 6d. with victuals. 

Live-StocL—The Aberdeenshire breed of cattle is by far the 
most common ; and, as great attention has, for many years, been 
paid to the rearing of them, they are much approved of in the 
southern markets. Crosses have of late been introduced with the. 
Tees water breed, which are said to feed well. Sheep are of va-. 
rious kinds, as Southdown, Leicester, and crosses with the Scotch 
hill breed. 

The usual duration of leases is nineteen years, and the con- 
ditions are in general sufficiently liberal and favourable to the oct 
cupier. 

The state of farm-buildings is good, being adapted to the value 
and situation of the farms. The methods employed for reclaim- 
ing waste lands have been judicious, and draining to a consider- 
able extent has been successfully executed. As an evidence of 
the improvement of agriculture, it may be mentioned, that the 
prize which was bestowed by the Aberdeenshire Agricultural As- 



480 ABERDEENSHIRE. 

sociatioii, for the best cultivated farm in the county, was gained by 
the tenant of Bethelnie in this parish. A considerable proportion 
of land has been substantially enclosed with stone dikes. On 
some of the largest farms, there are enclosures of hawthorn hedges ; 
and several fields in the vicinity of Old Meldrum, have, within 
these few years, been surrounded with a double row of hedging, 
consisting of beech and hawthorn, which has advanced with great 
rapidity, and is now very ornamental as well as useful. 

The crops raised are, oats, bear or big, turnips, potatoes, and 
a small proportion of wheat and barley. In the vicinity of Old 
Meldrum, all the varieties of turnip seeds are raised of a superior 
quality ; and the character of them is so well established, that some 
of the most celebrated agriculturists, both in England and Scotland, 
have, for several years past, supplied themselves from this quarter. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce raised in 
the parish, as far as it cau be ascertained, is as follows : 

2317 acres of oats, at L. 4, . L. 9268 0 0 

96 ajres of bear, at L. 6, . . 576 0 0

Manufactures.— \:\iQ knitting of worsted stockmgs is still much 
practised by females in Old Meldrum, although at a much redu- 
ced rate of remuneration. There are two pretty extensive weaving 
shops in Old Meldrum, rented by the proprietors of some of the 
large manufacturing establishments in Aberdeen, in which a con- 
siderable number of young persons of both sexes are employed at 
the hand-loom. Their wages have fallen very much of late years. 

Since the act of Parliament was passed in 1823, two distille- 
ries, upon a small scale, have been set to work, one of them in Old 
Meldrum, and one on the estate of Tullo ; in the former place, 
there is a long established brewery. 

v.— Parochial Economy. 

Market-Town.— only market-town in the parish is Old 
Meldrum, which was erected by charter into a burgh of barony in 
1672. There is a good weekly market in it for provisions. Uuriiig 
the winter and spring months, there is a market every fortnight tor 
the sale of cattle and grain ; and there are two annual fairs in the 
months of May and November, at which farm-servants are engag- 



MELDllUM. 



481 



ed From the yecar 1726, and for a long period thereafter, the 
town of Old Meldrum was governed by two bailies nominated by , 
the superior ; but at present there is no local magistrate, and 
no regular system of police. 

Mea7is of Communication.— Since the year 1804, this parish has 
enjoyed excellent means of communication, both with the south 
and north, by the turnpike road which was opened at that time be- 
tween Aberdeen and Banff, which passes through Old Meldrum, 
and for the distance of six miles through the parish. Upon this 
road, two carriers belonging to Old Meldrum go from it to Aber- 
deen, and return every week, and one of them twice a week. The 
ditance is seventeen miles and three-quarters. A post from the 
south, and another from the north passes twice a day through Old 
Meldrum, where there is a post-office. There is a stage-coach on 
the turnpike road, which affords both an economical and expedi- 
tious mode of travelling. 

Ecclesiastical State. — When the parish church was removed 
from Bethelnie, the present one was built in the close vicinity of 
Old Meldrum. It is most likely that this situation was chosen 
in order to accommodate the people of Old Meldrum, which at 
that time had probably a considerable population, and now con- 
tains nearly three-fifths of the whole inhabitants of the parish. 
The rural district in the neighbourhood of Old Meldrum is also the 
most populous. The church, upon the whole, is centrical, taking for 
the criterion its vicinity to the greatest number of the people, as 
probably not above a tenth part of the present population reside 
beyond the distance of three miles from it. It affords accommo- 
dation to about 700 persons ; but it is too small for the parish, 
and many who want seats in it cannot obtain them. The first 
and oldest part of the manse was built about the year 1710; a 
small addition to it was built in the year 1813, and a larger in 
the year 1829 ; it is now a most comfortable and commodious 
house. The glebe measures between 10 and 1 1 imperial acres. 
The stipend was last augmented in 1832, and is now 16 chal- 
ders, half meal, half barley, with L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion ele- 
ments. The ministers of the Episcopal and Secession chapels are 
paid by the seat-rents and contributions of their hearers, and they 
have, each a house and garden. The Dissenters do not perhaps 
exceed a tenth part of the, whole population. Divine service is 
well attended, and the number of communicants in the Estnhlisliod 
Church is above 800

Education. — There arc at present three schools in the parish, 
besides one for girls, the parochial in Old Meldrum, and two others 
in different districts of the country. They are all unendowed, 
except the parochial, and supported by the scholars' fees. A 
benevolent native of the parish bequeathed by his deed of set- 
tlement in 1795, to the kirk-session, the sum of L. 600, the in- 
terest of L. 200 of which he appointed to be paid annually to a 
teacher, who should instruct, without any other remuneration, such 
a number of the children of the poor inhabitants of the parish, as 
the session should consider he might be able to educate for that 
allowance. The parochial schoolmaster has hitherto received this 
sum, upon the condition, which is rigidly fulfilled, that he shall 
give education to all whom the session recommend. Another in- 
habitant of the parish left also, by his deed of settlement, to the 
kirk-session, the sum of L.90, legacy-duty deducted, the interest 
of which he appointed to be applied to the conducting of a Sabbath 
school in Old Meldrum. This school is now taught gratuitously, 
and is in a very flourishing state ; and the interest of the sum of 
L.90 alluded to, is laid out in the purchase of a religious library 
for the use of the Sabbath school scholars. The branches of edu- 
cation taught in the parish school are, reading, writing, mathema- 
tics, Latin, and Greek. In the other schools, English, writing, and 
arithmetic are taught. The parochial schoolmaster's salary is 
L, 28, and his fees for teaching are, per quarter, reading, 2s. ; 
writing, 2s. 6d. ; arithmetic, 3s. 6d. ; Latin, 5s. ; Greek, 5s. 
He has no dwelling-house from the heritors, but receives from 
them in lieu of it L. 6 per annum. The people are fully alive to 
the benefits of education, as is shown by the number of schools 
supported in the parish, without salaries from the heritors. By 
reason of the advantages which these schools afford, there is no 
part of the parish where children may not have the benefits of 
education ; but the want of salary renders the continuance of these 
seminaries uncertain. 

Friendly Societies.— There were until lately two or three Friendly 
Societies in the parish ; but they have been dissolved. 

Savings Bank.—k Savings Bank, however, was opened in the 
spring of 1834, in which a considerable sum of money has already 
been deposited, and it is hoped that the advantages of such an in- 
stitution will be duly appreciated by the labouring classes. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The number of persons receiving 
parochial aid has varied considerably at different periods. At 



MELD RUM. 



483 



present it is about 50, and the average sum allotted to each 
is about 8s. per quarter. In addition, two poor hinatics are main- 
tained by this parish in the Aberdeen Asylum, with the assistance 
of a sum allowed from the lunatic fund established by the presby- 
tery of Garioch. A collection is annually made in the parish 
church towards defraying the expense of maintaining these luna- 
tics. Another yearly collection is made- at church for the Aberdeen 
Infirmary. There are also public contributions annually made for 
the whole of the General Assembly's Religious Schemes. The 
collections in church for the relief of the poor of the parish, in- 
cluding those received during the time of the communion, amount 
to about L. 51 annually, and they have been on the increase for 
several years past. In addition, there is the annual interest of L.1400 
Sterling, bequeathed to this parish by benevolent individuals for- 
merly connected with it. Of this sum, L. 1200, which had been lent 
previously, partly on heritable, and partly on personal security, was, 
on the 20th of June 1834, invested in the purchase of land in a 
neighbouring parish, which promises to yield a good return for the 
capital. One tenant occupies the land, and pays his rent into the 
poor's funds. The other sums, arising from the use of the niort- 
cloth, and from seat-rents of a part of two galleries, set by the kirk- 
session, with permission of the heritors, for behoof of the poor, 
amount to about L. 8 annually. But from the produce of these 
funds available to the poor must be deducted annually the sala- 
ries of the teacher already alluded to, of the session-clerk and 
officer, and other smaller charges. There are no other regular 
funds for the supply of the poor, but frequently in seasons of scar- 
city, or during the prevalence of disease, meal and other necessa- 
ries are purchased for their use, by a fund raised by private volun- 
tary subscription. A great deal of charity is bestowed by all ranks 
according to their circumstances ; and if this source of relief were 
not always open and ready, the parochial funds, although compa- 
ratively extensive, would be totally inadequate to supply the wants 
of the poor, especially in Old Meldrum, where the greatest num- 
ber of them reside. There is a reluctance felt by the labouring 
classes to ask parochial relief. 

Fuel. — At one time, there was great abundance of excellent 
moss in this parish, but it is now much exhausted, and what re- 
mains is generally of inferior quality. Coals, therefore, are com- 
monly used, especially in Old Meld rum ; and as they are brought 
from Aberdeen and Newburgh in carts, the expense of fuel is 
greater in this than in any of the neighbouring parishes.

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Since the time that the last Statistical Account was written, 
the whole appearance of the parish has been much improved, and 
the quantity and value of its produce greatly augmented, by the 
superior system of farming which has been adopted. A regular 
rotation of cropping, suited to the nature of the soil, has been in- . 
troduced, one indispensable part of which is the meliorating crop 
of turnips. For it, the soil is carefully prepared and properly 
manured, and the operations of thinning and hoeing are well at- 
tended to, as this crop is considered of great value in a district, 
where the rearing of a superior quality of live-stock is one of the 
most important objects which the farmer has in view. Bone ma- 
nure has been extensively and successfully employed in this parish 
for raising turnips. In deep clay soils it does not answer well ; 
but in those of a less tenacious nature, the produce after its em- 
ployment is very great. Every effort has been made to reclaim 
waste lands, and to bring them into a proper state of cultivation. 
The old system of mill-multures has been discontinued, which 
will have a favourable effect upon agriculture. Another most im- 
portant improvement has taken place in' regard to the state of the 
roads. About thirty-six years ago, the turnpike road from Aberdeen 
to the north was carried through this parish, and at once estabhsh- 
ed a regular and excellent communication, by which farm produce 
can be carried for sale to Aberdeen at every season of the year. 
The increased facility of every other communication by this road 
is equally obvious, both for the comfort of the inhabitants and of 
travellers, and" a far greater intercourse is also enjoyed with the 
neighbouring districts. Hence, a general stimulus has been given 
to industry, and improvements of an extensive nature have been 
undertaken and completed, -to- which the former bad state of the 
roads would have presented an insurmountable obstacle. There 
is also a manifest improvement in the style of agricultural build- 
ings. In some instances, this improvement has extended itself to 
new houses in Old Meldrum ; and there seems to be a growing 
desire for it which is worthy of every encouragement. The extent 
of new plantations has already been taken notice of. A new hue 
of communication with Old Meldrum by a turnpike road has 
lately been opened from the upper part of the Ganoch on the one 
hand, and from the sea coast on the other. A new station for the 
disposal of grain and for the purchase of lime, will thus be obtain- 
ed by that district of country. The peculiar advantage to Old 



ALl'OUD. 



485 



Meldfum will consist, in the more extensive communication by 
travelling, which will take place on the new road, and in the easier 
access to its home markets. Its inhabitants will also obtain their 
coals at the port of Newburgh, which is six miles nearer than 
Aberdeen, where they were formerly supplied with them. Upon 
the whole, since the publication of the last Statistical Account, 
the progress of agriculture has in this parish been rapid and ex- 
tensive, the facilities of communication, by new lines of road, have 
been greatly increased, and the general aspect of the country is 
very much improved.

PRESBYTERY 01" ALFORD, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. JAMES FARQUHARSON, LL.D., F. R. S., 

MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The name of the small river, on the banks of which the 
church is situated, is Leochal. In the last syllable of this name, we 
recognize the Ale, which, according to Chalmers Caledonia, Vol. i. 
p. 20, is a common Gaelic name for other rivers in Scotland, 
signifying " clear stream ;" a name very appropriate to the Leo- 
chal. The first syllable, Leoch, is the name of the most remark - 
able mountain which the river touches in its course. Alford is 
thus the ford of the river Ale, in contradistinction to Waterford, 
the old name of a ford of the larger river Don, about a mile dis- 
tant. Owing to the situation of the neighbouring high grounds, 
there has always been an important passage over the small river 
at the church; and it supports the accuracy of the etymology of 
the name now given, that we again find the Ale in the name of the 
most important farm on its banks,— Dursale ; in which the first 
syllable — Durs, is, it seems, the Gaelic for oak. 

Situation, Extent, Boundaries, and Figure. — The parish is the 
most considerable one, in point of population and extent of culti- 
vated land, in the How hollow or vale of Alford ; a small dis- 
trict nearly in the centre of Aberdeenshire, well defined by natural

limits. The How, properly so called, includes three other pa- 
rishes, and is in the form of a trapezium, 10 miles long from east 
to west, and 8 miles broad at the east end, and 6 at the west. It 
is bounded on the east by the mountains Benochie, Cairnwilliam, 
and Mennowy ; on the south, by the mountain Correny, and a 
series of low hills, which form the south part of the parish of Al- 
ford ; on the west, by the mountain Callievar ; and on the north, 
by a ridge of mountains named Coreen. These mountains, with 
the exception of the low hills at part of the south side, all rise 
above the limits of cultivation, and give a peculiarly sheltered as- 
pect to the vale. They are scarcely continuous at any point 
with other mountain ranges, but spring up round the vale, from 
the table-land of Aberdeenshire. Their tops are rounded, with 
the exception of those of Benochie, which are finely serrated. 

The river Don flows through the vale almost directly from 
west to east, entering and leaving it by narrow winding gorges, 
which penetrate the two loftiest parts of the bounding mountains. 

The parish of Alford forms the south-west part of the How. Its 
extreme length from east to west is 7 miles ; extreme breadth 
from north to south, 3 miles, and area 13.6 square miles nearly. 
The church is nearly in Lat. 57° 13', north ; and in Long. 2° 40', 
west of Greenwich. 

The boundary on the west is the crest of Callievar, the loftiest 
bounding mountain of the How. On the other sides the bounda- 
ries are nearly all water-courses ; that on the north being the river 
Don, the outline of whose course is very nearly west and east. 
The figure of the parish is a semi-ellipse, cut off by the longer 
axis, represented by the Don. 

Surface and Elevation.— In reference to the forms of the sur- 
face, the parish is naturally divided into three distinct regions. 
The river Leochal, running into the Don by a course directly 
north, cuts off one of these, containing about 5.6 square miles, to 
the west. This region rises from the bed of the Leochal, which 
is 420 feet above the level of the sea, westward, by various waving 
acclivities, to the crest of Callievar, which is 1480 feet above the 
sea. The cultivation is here, at some points, carried to 950 feet 
above the sea. The other two regions on the east side of the 
Leochal are separated from each other by a somewhat waving 
line, passing from the mouth of the Leochal south-eastwardly, and 
contain four square miles each. The more westerly of the two, 
which is the middle region of the parish, consists of four or five

inosculating rouncl-toppeil bills, of gentle ascent on the north, but 
steeper o tlie south, whose bases are 420 feet, and their two high- 
est summits 800 feet above the level of the sea. The most easter- 
ly region is a relatively low land, chiefly consisting of two gentle 
swellt, whose bases are 380 feet, and their summits 460 feet above 
the sea. 

Meteorology,— 0 regular record has been kept in the parish, 
of either the thermometer or barometer. In absence of that of 
the former, we can have recourse to the temperature of perennial 

• A mao-nificentand exceedingly varied view is obtained from the summit of Callie- 
var Immediately under the eye of the spectator there is seen the richly cultivated 
and ornamented vale of Alford on the ea.;t, traversed by the clear river Don, and 
bounded at the opposite end by the rocky-suramitcd Benochic On the vycst, close 
at hand, are the contiguous cultivated valleys of Kildrummy and Towie, with the re- 
mains of their two ancient castles celebrated in history and song. On the south, the 
eye obtaiuin"' many peeps into cultivated valleys near at band, commands in the re- 
mote distance a splendid range of sixty miles of the loftiest Grampians, extending 
westwards from the shore of the Mearns, and including Mount Bettach, Mount 
Keen, Lochnagar, Benmuckduie, Benavon, and Cairngorm. On the north, it com- 
mands much of the varied surface of Aberdeenshire in that direction, with views of 
the Moray Frith and German Ocean beyond.

The highest temperature of the seven years 82o occurred on the 9th June 
1835. The lowest temperature 12o below zero of Fahrenheit on the 15th Febru- 
ary 1838. The temperature has been below zero, Fahrenheit, only three times dur- 
ing the last twenty-four years. 

The two times of the day chosen for registration, namely, 9 h. 15 m. a. m., and 
8 h. 30 m. P.M., are those at each of which the mean temperature of the year 
occurred at Leith, in 1824 and 1825, when an hourly register of the thermometer 
was there kept. The temperature at the two hours has not corresponded at Alford ; 
but the mean of the two may yet be nearly the true mean of the year.

deticieucy also in all the more cultivated districts of Scotland. Nor- 
folk barley, however, and wheat, both often tried here, too fie- 
quently fail to come to maturity, and their cultivation is now rare- 
ly attempted. The climate is admirably well adapted for turnips. 
Potatoes rarely fail, and there are great crops matured of clover 
and rye-grass. In the general run of seasons, the sowing of oats 
commences the last week of March, and the sowing of bear is fi- 
nished by the 1st of May ; potatoes are planted about the 10th of 
May, and turnips sown from the 1 st to the 20th of June ; hay 
harvest occurs about the 10th of July, and that of the grain crops 
begins about the 1st of September. 

In stating the nature of the climate, notice must be taken of a 
serious injury to which the grain crops are exposed, in some of the 
lowest and most sheltered parts of the parish, owing to the occur- 
rence in some years of a hoar frost during some part of the month 
of August. Regarding this the following facts have been observ- 
ed. The frost never occurs but during a calm with a clear sky ; 
the freezing cold is confined to the surface of the earth, or to 
within a few feet of it ; for a thermometer, raised only five or 
six feet into the air, will indicate a temperature of 39° or A0°, 
when serious mischief is going on below. The injury is strictly 
limited to the lower and more sheltered lands, and all the higher 
and more open lands escape. No injury is sustained in very nar- 
row gorges, through which water flows rapidly, although patches 
of land in them are otherwise low and sheltered. Spaces round 
mill sluices and other small waterfalls are also free from injury, 
and margins of 20 or 30 yards breadth on both sides of the larger 
and more rapid streams. If a breeze sets in before sunrise, no 
evil follows, although at some previous hour of the night it has 
frozen at the surface of the ground. These facts would seem 
to indicate, that, if a current of air could be artificially created, the 
evil effects would be warded off. 

It has been ascertained also that grain in a very green and 
milky state sustains no injury from these slight frosts ; but that if 
it approaches very nearly to a state of ripeness, even so much 
that there shall afterwards be found hardly any deficiency in the 
usual quantity of meal that it yields, it becomes altogether unfit for 
seed. It is in this view that great loss is often sustained, for there 
is no external mark by which the damaged grain can be distin- 
guished. It may, however be recognized at once, by carefully 

stripping the husks from the kernels, when the longitudinal groove

in these will be observed black and carious, and they may be 
crumbled with facility between the fingers. 

The climate is healthy ; and at no season of the year can 
there be said to be any peculiar prevalent diseases. We are lia- 
ble to the inroads of the contagious diseases, small-pox, mea- 
sles, hooping-cough, and scarlet fever; we have also occasion- 
ally typhus. The progress and character of this latter, and 
of scarlet fever, when they appeared here to a serious extent 
about twelve years ago, were examined by Dr Alexander Murray, 
who then acted as our medical practitioner ; and he gives autho- 
rity to state, that typhus did not prove so fatal here as it did at 
that time in other districts, for he lost only one or two out of fifty 
patients ; but that scarlet fever proved very destructive ; for, out 
of 200 patients, 1 in 10 died. These and similar facts subse- 
quently observed, led him to infer that typhus is milder, and scar- 
let fever more severe than these diseases respectively are in towns. 
He states also, that the peculiar inclosed character of this valley 
furnished him with an excellent opportunity to examine the man- 
ner of the dissemination of typhus ; and that, upon a careful exa- 
mination, there was unequivocally traced to contagion as large a 
proportion of cases of that disease as of scarlatina, small-pox, or 
other diseases, which are admitted by all to arise from contagion, 
and from no other cause. 

Hydrography. — There are numerous small perennial springs 
of excellent water, especially in the two western hilly regions. A 
few springs also occur that are slightly chalybeate. In digging 
recently for a pump near Haughton, on reaching the rock in situ, 
a fountain was opened, which gives out a nauseous gas, and has 
a strong mineral taste, which excited attention. Some chemical 
tests, to which it was subjected, indicated that it contains sulphu- 
retted hydrogen, but the matter is not yet fully investigated. 

There are no lakes in the parish ;. and a circumstance deserv- 
ing of notice is, that there are none connected with the Don or 
any of its branches ; while the tributaries of the parallel river 
Dee, at no remote distance, either drain or pass through nume- 
rous lakes. 

The principal river is the Don, which has its source in the pa- 
rish of Strathdon, about thirty miles westward. It is here about 
100 feet broad, and flows with a rapid shallow stream, over a 
pebbly bottom ; having dry grassy banks to the margin of the 
water. Next in order is the Leochal, which falls into the Don, 



492 



ABERDEENSHIRE. 



after a winding course of twelve miles from its source in the pa- 
rish of Cushnie. It is about 23 feet wide in its course through 
this parish, and is rapid and shallow like the Don. The Burn 
of Bents, a smaller and more sluggish stream, bounds the parish 
on the east, and the still smaller Burn of Buckie has its course 
wholly within its middle and eastern regions. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The rocks of the whole parish are 
of those aggregates, which have been denominated primitive. 
The minerals composing the aggregates are, quartz, felspar, horn- 
blende, and mica : the species of the aggregates themselves, chiefly 
tliose which have obtained the names of granite, syenite, and 
mica-slate. The varieties of the granite may be pronounced 
infinite. It varies by an increase or deficiency in different spe- 
cimens of some of the minerals, quartz, felspar, or mica, of which 
it is composed ; or by an enlargement or diminution of the crys- 
tals of these minerals. It also varies greatly in point of colour, 
and in being sometimes flawed into large or middling blocks, and 
sometimes shivered into small fragments in situ. In some places, 
definite varieties of it may be seen forming continuous veins for a 
considerable space ; in other places may be seen amorphous 
beds, in which a great number of varieties are interlaced in the 
most inextricable confusion. Among other varieties, we have 
some closely resembling the well known gray granite of Aber- 
deen, and equally serviceable and durable for building; and others 
as closely resembling the equally well known red granite of Pe- 
terhead. 

The syenite can only be considered as a variety of the granite, 
in which hornblende is substituted for the felspar In fact, the 
granite is in some places seen gradually passing into a light-co- 
loured syenite j but some circumstances attend the latter which 
do not belong to the former. Thus it is never observed shivered 
in situ into small fragments like the granite, but only flawed into 
large blocks ; and while both the aggregates are penetrated by 
numerous small veins, those of the granite are most frequently 
quartz, and those of the syenite are almost invariably a smaller 
granular syetiite. The positions of the syenite in relation to other 
rocks have not been observed to follow any definite order, and 
it has not, like the granite, been seen forming large veins, but ir- 
regular beds. 

The mica-slate, which forms the prevailing rock for a consi- 
derable space in the north-west part of the parish, is subject 



ALFORD. 493 

to pass into a great many varieties as well as the granite ; and 
the inclinations of its strata shift, with change of place,, into every 
possible position, and the strata are often greatly contorted. It 
is penetrated by many small veins of quartz, and many also of 
numerous varieties of granite, of all dimensions, up to the width 
of twenty or thirty yards. 

Although, in examining these primitive rocks in such a narrow 
space as this parish, it would not be obvious that they held any defi- 
nite order in relation to each other, yet, on looking at a larger ex- 
tent of the neighbouring country, an outline of such an order may 
be perceived in respect of some of them. Thus the mica-slate 
in the north-west part of the parish is the south border of a 
long range of slaty rocks, that appears to pass in the direction of 
noith-east and south-west, of varying but comparatively limited 
breadth from north-west to south-east. And again, in the south- 
east part of the parish, are found beds and veins of a peculiar 
somewhat porphyritic red granite, which are the north edge of a 
comparatively narrow range of that rock, which is known to ex- 
tend also from north-east to south-west for a space of twenty-five 
miles, and probably extends much farther. These ranges of pe- 
culiar rocks have no relation to the ranges of mountains, but hold 
their courses onward equally through mountains and valleys; and 
their north-west and south-east edges are extremely straggling and 
irregular. 

A remarkable circumstance regarding the rocks of this parish 
is, that by much the larger part of them is in a state of decompo- 
sition ; or at least in such a friable state that they may be easily 
dug into with the pickaxe and spade. The varieties of the gray 
and red granite are most frequently found in this state ; but there 
are also many parts of the mica-slate in the sam'e condition. 
The syenite has not been observed friable, with the exception of 
fragments of it often found included in the friable granite. The 
friable rocks have no definite position in relation to the hard. 
Posts of fine building stone, that resist the action of the weather, 
are in many places quarried in the midst of immense beds of the 
friable. 

As far as is known the rocks are very poor in metallic ores. 
A poor ore of iron sometimes accompanies- the narrow quartz 
veins; and- that metal, disseminated in small quantity, appears to 
influence the colours of the rocks. A, black heavy small sand, 
found on the strands of the Don, and in the beds of torrents over 



494. 



ABERDEENSHIUR. 



friable granite, has been analyzed by Dr Thomson, and found to 
be the ore of titanium and iron named Iserine. The only simple 
minerals, in addition to those forming the aggregates of the rocks, 
are small rock-crystals. 

The deposits covering the rocks in situ, whose quantity and 
character could not have been ascertained thirty years ago without 
great labour undertaken for the purpose, have since been pene- 
trated at a vast number of points by various operations in the 
course of the improvements in the parish, and have been thus ful- 
ly exposed. The most remarkable circumstance regarding them 
is their shallowness on both the high and low grounds. On the 
north and west faces of the hills they are very thin, not generally 
more than a foot or two, and at their bases or in hollows, there, 
very rarely having a depth of five or six feet. At the south and 
east slopes and bases of the hills they may be considered, on an 
average, a foot or two deeper than this, or varying from one or 
two to six or eight feet, with the shallower depths greatly prevail- 
ing. On the relatively flat lands in the east part of the parish the 
deposits cannot be considered as exceeding the average depth of 
those on the hills. In a very few places only within the parish, 
and they of very limited extent, in lower hollows, and at the south 
and east bases of very friable rocks, deposits are seen of a depth 
of 1 5 or 20 feet. 

The deposits consist entirely of the debris of the underlying or 
neighbouring rocks, and, according as these are hard or friable, they 
vary from stony, through sandy, to a sandy brick clay, including, 
more or less, fragments of hard stone. 

The outlayers or dispersed fragments of a great many well- 
marked rocks are observed invariably at points between the east 
and south of the rocks in situ ; sometimes, when the descent of 
the surface is in that direction, at a great distance from their ori- 
ginal plac. 

No organic remains have ever been found either in the rocks or 
their covering deposits. 

It is abundantly evinced by many facts, that our present valleys 
have not been scooped out by the rivers which now flow in them. 
Every stream has formed only a narrow lengthened hollow in the 
bottom of the irregularly expanding valley through which it has 
its course. The escarpments that bound the lengthened hol- 
lows on both sides are continuous in lines nearly parallel to the 
streams, and are more steep than any other rising grounds to be 



ALFORD. 



495 



found in the parish. The bottoms of the hollows themselves are 
flat, and the soil in them and the natural vegetation differ from 
any' to be found abov6 the escarpments. The deposits within 
them consist of horizontal beds of water-worn and rounded frag- 
ments of rocks, of all the different sorts to be found along the 
whole upper courses of the streams, brought into juxtaposition 
within narrow spaces. On the contrary, the fragments of rocks 
found in the deposits above the escarpments are angular, and not 
much water-worn, some of them not worn at all ; and within a 
given space, they consist of few varieties. The extent and depth 
of the river hollows are everywhere regulated by three conditions, 
—the magnitude of the stream, its rapidity, and the hardness or 
friableness of the materials of the bed ; and towards the sources of 
the streams they diminish to simple drains for the water. In addi - 
tion to these facts, many localities can be pointed out where it is 
obvious that, had the rivers ever run at higher levels than the escarp- 
ments bounding the present hollows, they would have taken their 
courses, and formed their junctions by lines very different from 
those they at present pursue. 

The beds of the streams have been very sensibly deepened 
within the last thirty years, presenting us with a measure by which 
to estimate the period that may have been required for the exca- 
vation of the river hollows ; and which, as a detail of particulars 
would show, agrees well with the era assigned by historical record 
to the last general flood. 

Soil. — The larger proportion of the soil may be called a friable 
and dry loam, eminently adapted for the turnip husbandry ; but 
it varies materially with the nature of the subjacent rocks and the 
deposits covering them. Where these have been friable and worn 
into a clay by the action of the weather, the subsoil is more or 
less retentive of too much wet to admit of turnips, without much 
attention to both under and surface draining ; but the soils in this 
condition produce the best crops of oats. There are also many 
spouty places caused by springs issuing from the beds and veins 
of shivered granite, which require under draining, often a delicate 
and uncertain process where the rocks have no certain order ; but 
the soil in such places is generally highly productive, when the 
springs can be fairly drained out. The soil of the haugh lands with- 
in the river hollows is very friable, and, where separated by drains 
from the bounding high grounds, always-very dry. In respect of 
staple, all the soils may be called shallow, with the exception of 



ABEUDKENSHIRE. 



those of some of the old infields, small pafts of every farm to which 
it was formerly the practice to apply all the dung, to the exclusion 
of the other lands. Of these the soil is generally deep. 

Many boulders, or large detached stones, recently cumbered 
much of the soil; but they have been to a great extent removed 
from the arable land within the last thirty years, at great labour 
and expense, needing often to be blasted with gunpowder. 

Zoology. — There are, besides the domesticated races, only 
twenty-three MammaUa ever seen in the parish. Among these are 
the red-deer, but rarely, and the variable hare in winter. Three 
species have lately come into it— the pine-marten and hedgehog 
about fifteen years ago, and the gray warren-rabbit more recently. 
They have probably been enticed by a fine cover of wood-, now 
greatly extended. 

Major Thomas Youngson, E.I.C.S., very obligingly gave his aid to 
perfect a list of the Birds; and it appears we have thirty species con- 
stantly resident; as many that breed here, but leave us in winter ; 
eleven species that are only winter visitants; thirteen species that are 
often seen hunting, and six species that have been seen occasionally, 
among which is the rare nutcracker, seen by Major Youngson. 
One species 139, Tetanus callidris of Dr Fleming's British Ani- 
mals, has been very recently driven away from its breeding haunts, 
by the extension of cultivation. The Anserferus is nearly banished 
by the same cause. This came formerly in large flocks, and of all 
migratory birds kept most regularly to its time — arriving the third 
week of September, and departing the second week of April. 

Our Reptiles are only five,two lizards, two frogs, and the com- 
mon toad. 

The Fishes are also few. We have the sea-lamprey rarely ; 
the river-lamprey, salmon, common-trout, par, pike, minnow, com- 
mon eel, and stickleback. 

The salmon are not found clean in the Don till the 1st of April. 
The salmon fry disappear from the river about the middle of May. 
The grilses begin to come up about the last week of June. The 
fish after spawning partly return down in winter ; but great num- 
bers of the spawned fish remain in the river till the middle of 
March. 

Botany.— Dx Alexander Murray, who examined the botany of 
this parish several years ago, when he was resident here, has, on 
solicitation, very obligingly communicated a list of all the flower- 
ing plants which are native. We have full reason for thinking his 



AI.FOUD. 497 

list a very complete one. It is transmitted along with this ac- 
count, and must be esteemed curious, as exhibiting the character 
of the vegetation of a parish in the north of Scotland, as remote 
from the sea and the higher Scotch alps and large towns, as any 
other that could be named, having, besides, the peculiarity that 
the rocks are exclusively the siliceous and argillaceous primitive 
ones. The whole number of flowering plants is only 306 ; and 
we shall give here the numbers that belong to some of the more 
important natural orders of Hooker's Flora Scotica : 

GramineEB . 35 Priraulaceae . 3 Rosaceae . . 15 

Cyperacea . 19 Labiatae . 12 Leguminosa 15 

Juacese • 11 Scrophiilarina 15 Hypericineae . 4 

Orchidea . 7 Boraginese . 5 Geraniaceae . 4 

Conifers . 2 Ericeas . 4 Caryophylleas . 12

Euphorbiacese . 2 Rubiace» . 6 Ranunculace£e . 8 

Polygoneae . 12 Umbelliferas . 7 

Our attention ha\ing been directed to the subject by Dr Hook- 
er, we are enabled to give the following heights above the sea, at 
which some of the cultivated plants succeed in this parish.

1200 Larch. This valuable tree appears to find, in our region of primitive rocks, a 
soil well adapted to it. It thrives better than any other tree at the inferior 
heights, and ripens its wood early. 

1100 Birch. 

1050 Scotch fir. 

1000 Broom. 

950 Oats ripen fully here, and are attended by all the plants of our common hus- 
bandry in full perfection, including potatoes. Greens, and some cabbages, white 
peas, and flax, also succeed. 
Aller is native. 

900 Ash, elm,  Ulmus montana, gooseberries ripen. 

800 Cherries, jargonelle pears, raspberries, hawthorn. 

760 Beech, Quercus sessiliflnra, 

700 Quercus robur, dwarfish. 

500 Ribstone pippin apple. 

450 Achan pear, lime, Salix alba, laburnum. 

420 A fine silver fir at Haughton deserves notice, as it shews the species is well ad« 
apted to our soil and climate. It is 92 years old, more than 10 feet in girth, 
and 76 feet high — measuring upwards of 200 cubic feet. It is at present grow- 
ing very rapidly. 

The greatly varied heights and exposure of the lands in this 
parish afford great facilities for ascertaining the influence of as- 
pect on the various kinds of cultivated plants. Trees and shrubs 
which have to endure the severity of the winter storms are, on 
land having a westerly or north westerly aspect, always compara- 
tively stunted and irregular in their growth. It does not appear, 
that, among the remaining aspects, any one is much to be prefer- 
red to another for these plants. With regard to the annual and 
herbaceous plants, the effect of aspect appears to be insignificant.

The brairds of grain, and the grasses, are somewhat more forward 
in spring, on south-lying lands ; but when the sun comes near the 
northern tropic, those on the north-lying lands soon come up 
with them ; and there is scarcely a difference in the earliness of 
the hay crops, and none at all in that of the grain crops. In short, 
the influence of aspect on the earliness or lateness of both these 
crops is quite obscured by the greater influence of a dry or damp 
subsoil. The earliest ripened grain crops in the parish, every 
year, are on a piece of the steepest cultivated land in it, having a 
directly north exposure, but of which the subsoil is uniformly dry. 

11. — Civil History. 
There is no other account of the parish known than the one 
in the old Statistical Account. That contains a very interesting 
description of the then existing state of the parish, especially of its 
agriculture. The system of the agriculture, to state it in few words, 
then was, to have about one-third of a farm, denominated infield, 
always in grain crop ; one-third part of this always in bear, to which 
all the dung of the farm was applied, and the other two-thirds in oats. 
The other°two-thirds of the farm, called outfield, was arranged into 
eight or ten divisions, each of which bore four or five crops of 
oats in succession, and was then left uncultivated for four or five 
years, to bear such grasses as might naturally spring up in it. 
Such animals, chiefly horses and black-cattle, with a few moun- 
tain sheep, were at the same time kept, as could subsist on the 
outfield leys and natural pastures round the arable land in sum- 
mer, and on the straw of the grain crops in winter. There was no 
apphcation of any manure but the dung of the animals. The 
teams for ploughing consisted each of ten small oxen ; and car- 
riacres were performed by small horses who did little other work. 
In the account thus given of it, the imperfections of this agriculture 
are pointed out with an ability which might have augured, that 
great improvements, since happily realized, were then .near at 
hand. The printed copies of the account abound with typogra- 
phical errors, deforming a paper of much interest. 

Land-Owners.— The following gentlemen are the present land- 
owners of the parish: John Farquharson, Esq. of Haughton, who 
possesses nearly two-thirds of the parish, and resides here durmg the 
summer months ; Andrew Farquharson, Esq. of Breda, resident  
Charles Forbes, Esq. of Asloon, not resident; William btewart, 

• Since this was written, the parish has been ei-ived of this et and valuable 
inhabitant by his death. The property is now l.ferented by his widow.

499 



Esq. of Carnaveran, not resident ; Duncan Davidson, Esq. of 
Tillychetly, not resident; Benjamin Lunisden, Esq. of Kingsford, 
now building to reside. Five of these gentlemen are freeholders of 
the county of Aberdeen. 

Parochial Registers. — The earliest entry in these is of date 
1717. They have been very irregularly kept; but one branch of 
them is of great historical interest, as showing the inquisitorial cha- 
racter of our church courts in the former part of the last century, 
till the salutary influence of the General Assembly reduced their 
practice to a nearer conformity with the general candour and open- 
jiess of British jurisprudence. 

Antiquities. — These are of little note. — A circle of large stones, 
known by the name of the " Auld Kirk," gives some countenance 
to the belief entertained by some persons, that such circles were 
places of worship to the ancient inhabitants. Two circular camps, 
recently very distinct, now nearly levelled by the plough, might 
hardly deserve notice, did- not such remains sometimes happily 
illustrate ancient records. The larger of these contains an area 
of 25 acres, on the top of a regularly conical low hill named 
" The Da-mil," perhaps a corruption of Danehill ; the a in 
Dane being provincially pronounced broad. The fortification has 
consisted of an earthen wall and ditch, strengthened, at intervals 
of one hundred yards, by round buildings, also of earth, of about 
fifty feet diameter. The smaller camp is on fiat ground near the 
church, and has the name of the Roundabout; its area little more 
than an acre ; but the vallum and fosse have been of very large di- 
mensions, and much earth for the former has been taken from the 
inside. 

A cairn of stones, in the form of a truncated cone, 120 feet in 
diameter, and about 25 feet high, having been partly removed, 
there were discovered under it several chests, formed of flat 
stones, in which were found ashes and pieces of charcoal, and in 
one a rude urn of baked earth, in which also were found ashes 
and pieces of bones. The cairn is on the suinmit of a hill named 
Carnaveran, a name interpreted, by a gentleman who speaks 
Gaelic, " the Cairn of Sorrow." The contents and the name of 
this monument thus both unite to show that it was erected to the 
memory of the dead ; and from the former we may infer that it 
was the practice of the inhabitants at the time to burn their dead. 

Modern Buildings. — The church is a substantial building of ru- 
ble stone and lime, rough-cast with lime outside, and roofed with 



500 



ABEUDEENSHIRE. 



Foudland slates, which, for lightness and durability, are about equal 
to those of Eisdale. It is a finely proportioned house, having nar- 
row galleries on three sides, and the whole fitted up and paint- 
ed with simplicity and beauty. The stair for the galleries is in 
a building outside the hne of the wall ; and as the ceihng is flat 
and not too lofty, there is none of that irregular vertical echo which 
makes it impossible to hear a speaker at any considerable distance, 
in so many of our public buildings constructed with too lofty roofs. 

There is a substantial mansion-house at Haughton, the seat of 
the principal heritor, built of finely dressed granite, and of modern 
construction. There is also a suitable mansion-house at Breda. 

There are three meal mills in the parish, with attached drying 
kilns, built of ruble stone and lime, and roofed with slate. The 
farm-houses and steadings are all built of durable stone, of which 
there is everywhere a good supply near at hand. Most of them are 
with thorough lime ; but some are only with clay and sneckpinned 
with lime. Many of them are roofed with slate, which is getting 
more into use ; but a large part is stob-thatched with straw, and a 
few with heath, which makes a more durable covering.

The ordinary food of the great body of the working people chief- 
ly consists of oat-meal, made into boiled pottage, or brose, or 
cakes, rendered nutritive and wholesome by an abundant sup- 
ply of milk, and varied occasionally by potatoes dressed in va- 
rious ways, and by soups made of greens, turnips, and pot-barley. 
The ordinary beverage of the working people is an excellent small 
,beer, from malt made of bear of native growth, and hops ; and this, 
with a larger allowance of malt in it, forms in their diet an excel- 
lent substitute for milk, when occasionally the latter becomes de- 
ficient in any family during winter. Until about six years ago, the 
malt was all home made ; and the farmers and their servants, dur- 
ing some part of autumn or winter, found seasons of leisure from 
their busier occupations to make it, which they could all do very 
skilfully, so that the making of it virtually cost them nothing. Since 
that time, however, so many annoying regulations have been intro- 
duced in levying the excise duties, that the practice of private malt- 
ing has, of necessity, been almost entirely abandoned. A system 
of public malting, since partially introduced, has not much mitigat- 
ed the privations inflicted by these regulations. It involves an 
expense, which was before entirely avoided, and may, in the end, 
subject the whole supply of malt to a monopoly in the hands of 
the public maltster. 

The enforcement of these regulations is complained of by the 
inhabitants, as the greatest inconvenience to which any fiscal law 
has ever subjected them ; and as they have never complained of 
the amount of the duty, the revision of the regulations, with the 
view of restoring private malting to its recent freedom, might be 
a boon granted them, without hurt to the revenue. 

General Character of the People. — As to their general character, 
it cannot be spoken of otherwise than in terms of commendation. 
They are persons whose understandings are practically sound, and 
enlarged and cultivated by that perpetual exercise of them, to which 
the infinitely diversified nature and circumstances of their rural pur- 
.suits, often requiring the nicest delicacy of judgment in conduct- 



502 



ABERDEENSHIIIE. 



ing them, afford a constant excitement. They are not destitute 
of a serviceable share of that knowledge which is derived from let- 
ters ; but, with regard to their worldly affairs, experience may be 
called the great guide of their life. 

Their moral qualities are of a yet higher order. They are as- 
siduously industrious, temperate in their desires and enjoyments, 
affectionate in their families, careful of the education of their chil- 
dren, friendly and obliging to one another, liberal to the poor with- 
out the slightest ostentation, and sincere and upright in their deal- 
ings with strangers. These qualities secure a peaceable and or- 
derly neighbourhood, where any necessity for the interference of 
the civil magistrate is almost unknown. A law-plea is an event 
of the rarest occurrence ; and neither tradition nor record states 
that any inhabitant, native of the parish, was ever accused before a 
criminal court. 

These moral qualities, so beneficial to the individual and the - 
present order of society, have their permanent root in a deep and 
steady principle of religion ; and the same wise practical discre- 
tion which regulates their worldly affairs is also a characteristic of 
their religion. There is perceived among them no loquacious pa- 
rade of religious knowledge, no casuistical disputation, no delight 
in controversy, and none of that ostentatious display of piety which 
is forbidden to a Christian ; but they who know them most intimate- 
ly, know also, that a constant feeling of their dependence upon 
God, and responsibihty to him, rendered active by the promises 
and hopes of Christianity, directs the general tenor of their life. 
Happily, the demoralizing practice of smuggling never found its 
way into the parish : and poaching is unknown.

Plantations.— The species of trees planted to greatest extent' 
are the Scotch and larch firs. There are also many spruce firs 
Pinus abies  in lands too wet for the other two species. Recent 
eiperience has proved the wood of this last tree to be much mor 
durable than any other we have, when used for gate and paling- 
posts, if put into the ground with the bark on. 

It can admit of no doubt, that great error has been committed 
in planting and managing the Scotch fir, the species first planted 
here. The plantations of that tree have almost all died before at- 
taining the age of fifty or sixty, or, in the most favourable cases, 
seventy years. This, of course, involves the necessity of early cutting 
and sale ; and the wood of the early cut trees has no durability, 
being liable to the attack of worm, which utterly destroys it in 
thirty or thirty-five years. The wood of young trees of the Brae- 
mar native forests suffers equally from worm, while that of the 
aged trees is equally durable with the best Baltic wood ; showing 
that the durability is entirely dependent on the age of the tree, 
and that no valuable wood can be obtained from the plantations till 
the cause of the early death of the trees is discovered and removed. 

It seems practically demonstrated by an incident which has occur- 
red in a plantation in this parish, that the generally early death of 
the planted fir is to.be ascribed exclusively to the universal practice, 
from whence soever it may have arisen, of planting the trees too 



504 



ABERDEENSHIRE. 



thick on the ground, and not giving them spaces at all propor- 
tional to the ultimate size of the species. The incident is as fol- 
lows : In a plantation of oaks at Haughton, made ninety-two years 
ago, a number of Scotch firs have been planted dispersedly, per- 
haps intended for sheltei' to the oaks ; and as the latter have not 
thriven well, the firs have had room from the beginning to occupy 
spaces proportional to their native growth, and have become large 
and valuable trees, — at their present age already furnishing wood 
of an excellent quality. Not one of these trees has ever been 
known to die naturally ; and those which the axe has spared have 
all a healthy and vigorous aspect, indicating that they might live 
to the ordinary period of the trees of the native forests. While 
this has occurred with respect to them, other plantations of fir in 
the immediate neighbourhood, on soil exactly similar, and planted 
much more recently, but of the customary thickness, have, some 
years ago, died out. 

It would appear from a variety of circumstances, especially from 
the prosperous state of some other fir trees in this parish, which, 
from incidental causes, have enjoyed much room from the time of 
their being planted, but into the particulars of all which there is not 
room here to enter, that the proper correction of the error, which 
has so long prevailed, would be, to plant the trees at first so thin as 
to give each the space which it would occupy when arrived at full 
size and maturity of growth ; and not to trust to thinning with the 
axe, which is liable to many objections. Planting in this way 
would require only 200 or 300 trees to the imperial acre, instead 
of 3000 or 4000 according to the present practice. 

The same error of thick planting, which has proved so fatal to 
the Scotch fir, has been fully extended to the larch. That spe- 
cies was introduced here sixty or seventy years ago, and the trees 
were at first planted dispersedly, or among scattered rows of trees 
around gentlemen's seats. These, having ample room, have, with 
few exceptions, continued healthy and vigorous. Afterwards larches 
were planted to a greater extent promiscuously with Scotch firs, 
or in clumps alternating with these, and equally crowded ; and un- 
der such management, they are now dying in equal numbers with 
the Scotch fir. 

A better system, in respect to this matter, begins to prevail ; 
for, although thin planting has not been adopted, more attention 
is paid to early thinning. 

Besides the firs, many other species of trees have been planted 



ALFOllD. 



505 



in the parish ; and there are trees to a great value of these spe- 
cies, now ready for use, especially round Haughton. The chief of 
them, in the order in which they are observed to grow most rapidly 
here, may be thus enumerated ;— beech, elm  Ulmus montana of 
Hooker's Flora Scotica, ash, which is the most valuable, gean- 
tree Prunus cerasnsj, lime, Scotch plane, mountain-ash  Pyrus 
aucuparia , birch, quaking-ash  Populus tremula J, aller, and white- 
beam tree f Pyrus aria . 

In addition to these, there are a very few black poplars, and wil- 
lows,, as Salix alba, S. decipiens, S. lanceolata. These last prosper 
well, and might deserve to be more cultivated. There are also a 
few trees of the Cytisus laburnum which become valuable for 
household furniture. 

There has been planted in the parish also a very considerable 
number of oaks  Quercus robur J, and the largest plantation ap- 
pears to be now ninety-two years old ; but the result does not seem 
to warrant the extension of plantations of that species, as the trees 
are much inferior in value to ashesand elms planted at the same time, 
under equal circumstances. This relative failure of the oak might 
appear surprising, when it is considered, that many remains of oak 
trees, yet occasionally dug from under the soil, prove it was once 
a common native. But it has been ascertained by the examination 
of an old native copse of oak at some distance from this parish, 
that the native species is not the Robur but the Sessiliflora ; and 
as that is said to yield only wood of inferior quality, it would not 
seem expedient to plant it with a view to the value of the wood, 
however it might be profitable for the bark. 

Rent. — The valued rent of the parish is L.3126, 12s- 8d. Scots 
money. The present gross rent is very evenly L.4000 Sterling ; 
giving, after making an allowance of a small rent for the unculti- 
vated land, nearly 16s. rent per imperial acre of arable land. The 
rent of grazing and rate of pasturing animals by the year cannot 
be stated. 

Rate of Labour and Mechanical Work. — Fees, besides provi- 
sions and lodgings, by the year : a good ploughman, L.13 ; a boy, 
L.4 to L.7 ; a female servant, L.5. For the harvest-work only ; 
a good scythesman, L.2, 15s.; a woman, L.l, 15s. Wages with- 
out provisions or lodgings by the day ; a labourer, 2s. in summer, 
and Is. 4d. in winter; a mason, 2s. lOd. ; a carpenter, 2s. 3d.; a 
tailor, 2s. With provisions, and without lodgings, a female to hoe 
turnips, 8d. By the rood of thirty-six square yards, a stone and

Breeds of Animals.— Horses.— T\\e present principal breed of 
these has been brought from the south of Scotland and England 
within the last thirty years. They are of such size that two make 
an excellent plough. A good many are now bred in the parish, 
but not quite enow to supply the yearly waste. There are yet 
also to be found a considerable number of the old breed of small- 
sized horses ; a healthy race, and of great endurance for the road. 

S/ieep.— These, with the exception of one flock of black-faced 
sheep, kept on the hills, at the west end of the parish, consist of 
a few improved Leicesters, and Merino crosses, kept on account of 
the wool. 

Pigs.—ThevQ are very few, of the small Chinese breed; and 
they are getting quite out of favour as store beasts. 

Black-Cattle.— These form the most important store-beasts. 
The substratum of the present races is the well-known long-horn- 
ed black or brown Aberdeenshire breed, a healthy and handsome 
race, but small. The cows, when now properly fed at all seasons, 
are great milkers, and their milk peculiarly rich. This breed is, 
however, now rarely seen pure in this parish, although yet to be 
got quite pure in some of the neighbouring parishes. Smce the 
introduction of abundance of food by the turnip husbandry, the 
cultivators have become desirous of having larger animals than 
their old native breed ; and they have obtained these by crossmg 
it with larger bulls, brought from other parts. The crosses with 
the Galloway bull have been preferred, and the cattle have lost 
their characteristic horns. The resident heritors introduced the 
pure Ayrshire dairy breed ; and many of these, at one time, got 
dispersed among the farmers, but do not seem to be held, in re-

■ The general character of the Husbandry pursued.— The state 
of the husbandry is, on the whole, highly satisfoctory. Per- 
haps no example could be adduced, at any period, in any 
other nation, of such a series of beneficial improvements being 
introduced, in so short a space of time, by steadily progressive but 
unobtrusive steps, and without any removal of the natives, as those 
which have converted the rude and unproductive husbandry of 
1796 into our present skilful and productive one. 

The improvements have consisted chiefly in the regular appli- 
cation of lime, in sufficient quantity, as a manure ; — the introduc- 
tion of a dressed crop of turnips, and crops of artificial grasses, 
into a regular alternation with the crops of grain ; — the substitu- 
tion of the two horse and two oxen plough, for that drawn by ten 
oxen ; — of the thrashing-machine for the flail ; and of the scythe, in 
harvest, for the sickle ; — and also the cultivation of early varieties 
of oats, in place of the late kind, called common oats, formerly 
alone cultivated. Regarding some of these, it may not be improper 
to give a few brief notices. 

It might have been deemed, in former times, a thing incredible, 
that a great extent of land in the centre of Aberdeenshire, twenty- 
seven miles from the nearest sea-port, should be all sufficiently 
manured by lime, imported from Sunderland ; yet this improve- 
ment has been effected on nearly all the arable land of this pa- 
rish ; and it is one on which so much of the increased productive- 
ness of the present husbandry depends, that without it none else 
would have been of material benefit. The quantity of lime-shells, 
applied to the imperial acre, is 100 imperial bushels, on the light 
and dry land ; and on the clayey damper soils a little more ; but 
this quantity must not be exceeded, and the lime must be equally 
spread on the land with the utmost care ; as it is found, when used 
in excess, to induce an utter sterility ip respect of grain crops, for 
• which there is no known practicable remedy. For the same rea- 
son, it must not be repeated in less than about twenty years, and 
then in somewhat smaller quantity. The lime, in the first in- 
stance, was properly applied either to the dressed turnips or a 
clean fallow. In applying it for the second time, it has become 
the practice to harrow it in with bear and grass seeds after turnips, 
by which means it remains in the surface during the common 
three years of grass. The cost of 100 bushels lime-shells, at the 
Aberdeen shore, is L. 3, 4s. ; and of the carriage to Alford, L. 2, 
8s. These rates were recently about one-fourth more. 



508 



ADERDEKNSHIRE. 



The rotation of crops adopted in this parish is a seven-shift. 1. 
Turnips, with dung put in by double drilHng. 2. Bear or oats, with 
grass seeds, red and white clover and rye-grass. 3, 4, 5. Grass ; 
the first year of grass cut for soiling or hay. 6 and 7. Oats. 
This does not agree with the rigid rule, laid down by most writers 
on agriculture, that two grain crops ought not to succeed each 
other. Into the question, whether the rotation might be improved, 
we shall not enter, farther than to say, that the second crop of oats 
is, on an average, nearly as productive and somewhat earlier than 
the first, which is liable to be injured by the grub ; that, where 
the dressing of the turnip crop is properly attended to, the land 
does not get weedy ; that, by this rotation, the quantity of food 
for the live-stock is so equally adjusted for summer and winter, as 
not to drive the cultivators to the inconvenient and hazardous ex- 
pedient of suddenly increasing or diminishing their stock, at either 
season ; that the crops of turnips, returning after considerable in- 
tervals, are never infected with any disease ; and that the whole soil 
of the parish is, under the present system, obviously improving 
from year to year. 

The practicability of introducing early varieties of oats, is a re- 
sult of the increased fertility and cleanness of the land. These 
varieties would have been exceedingly unproductive on the poor 
and foul land of former times. We have now varieties which 
ripen three weeks earlier than the old common oat ; and this, 
since it respects our most important, and, at the same time, latest 
crop, may be pronounced an advantage equal to what might have 
been obtained, if it had been possible to shift the parish several 
degrees to a more indulgent climate. The most favourite varieties 
of oats are, the early Angus, the red oat, and the Scotch birley. 

At one period the potatoe-oat was extensively grown ; and in 
favourable seasons it gave a much greater produce than any other; 
but in late seasons it becomes even more late than the common 
oat; and in the unfavourable years of 1816 and 1817, it failed so 
much more sensibly than every other variety whatever, that any 
considerable extent of it is not now hazarded. 

While on this subject, we may state the common weights of 
grain. Bear weighs from 52 to 55 lbs. per imperial bushel, being 
much superior to that which grows near the coast; and early An- 
gus oats weigh from 41 to 44 lbs. per imperial bushel. 

Black-cattle form so important a branch of the husbandry, 
that the management of them must be stated. Respecting them, 



ALFORD, 



509 



the system is that of rearing lean stock for the English mar- 
kets ;'the beasts being sold off to the dealers in driving condition, 
when they reach the age of three, or four years, and comparatively 
few being fed for the shambles. A bullock three years old 
brings at present from L. 7 to L. 9 ; and one four years old from 
L. n to L. 14. 

The whole cattle are turned out to pasture about the beginning 
of May, and the milch cows kept as much separated from the 
others as the facilities of the farm will admit. The milch cows 
are all housed during the night, and receive cut grass in addition 
to their pasture. The yeld beasts are allowed to remain day and 
night in the enclosures, where these are completed ; or, where there 
are no enclosures, are turned during the night into the dung courts. 
In this latter case they are herded during the day by a boy. In 
the month of October, the cattle are all housed and bound up in 
stalls, where they are fed with turnips and oat-straw, so as to keep 
them in a growing condition, but no more. New calved cows get 
in winter and spring a little hay, in addition to the turnips and 
straw. 

Many hundred acres of waste land have been reclaimed, 
chiefly by the plough, within the last thirty years. The method 
of proceeding is this : As the waste land is all more or less 
cumbered with stones, these are all first removed when they 
are seen, or can be dug out with the pick-axe; and those that 
are large are blasted with gunpowder. The land is then ploughed 
with a strong plough, drawn by four strong beasts, attended by 
three or four men, according to the difficulty of the work. Oxen 
are more patient and fitter for this work than horses. Besides 
the men in immediate attendance on the plough, a gang of three 
or four men is stationed round the ploughed land with tramp- 
picks and spades to clear out the stones exposed in the furrow, 
and throw them on the ploughed land, and also to clear up the 
furrow itself where the plough has occasionally been thrown out. 
All this implies great labour ; but the expense incurred in this 
way does not equal half of that of trenching with the spade. 

After the land has remained a year in a ploughed state, the 
stones are removed, and it is cross-ploughed, reduced with the 
harrow, and laid up in proper ridges, after receiving dung, if any 
can be afforded to it from the farm. A proper quantity of lime 
is then applied and harrowed into the surface of the ridges before 
wmter. In the succeeding spring, oats are sown, and harrowed 



510 



A15EUDKENSI-II11E. 



in without more ploughing ; and by this management, are generally 
a productive crop. The new land is then included in the ordinary 
rotation, but produces better grain than grass for a series of years. 

Trenching is seldom had recourse to, but for reclaiming small 
corners, or other pieces deforming large fields, when they are too 
difficult for the plough ; and indeed, the expense of it could rarely 
be vindicated by the returns. 

Drains have been executed to a great extent, both open and 
covered. For the latter sort there are excellent materials every- 
where, in the abundance of small stones. They are cut three or 
four feet deep, or sometimes much deeper, as the case may re- 
quire, then half-filled with the stones tumbled out of a cart into 
the drain itself. A thick coat of heath is put over the stones, 
above which the earth is returned. 

An improvement by irrigation, on a small scale, was attempted, 
several years ago, by one of the proprietors, who had a piece of 
haugh land irrigated by a properly qualified person, a native of 
England; but it did not answer expectation, and the work has 
been abandoned. 

A great extent of heavy stone bulwarks has been executed by - 
the proprietors, along the Don and Leochal, at places where these 
rivers were liable to wear away the land. 

The parish is divided into forty principal farms, and forty-five 
small ones, named crofts, held of the land-owners. Of the for- 
mer, three or four contain somewhat more than 200 acres impe- 
rial.' The remainder vary from 50 to 150 acres ; the larger uum- 
ber being somewhere near 100 acres. Of the crofts, a few con- 
tain from 10 to 20 acres ; but the larger part only from 3 to 6 
acres. There is also a considerable number of crofts held by 
sub-lease, to be afterwards referred to. 

Leases.— There are leases, enduring for nineteen years, of all 
the principal farms, and many of the crofts; but some of the latter 
are held by a shorter tenure. At the commencement of the im- 
provements, about thirty years ago, the leases were granted for 
twenty-four years ; and this longer endurance, at that time, form- 
ed a desirable security and encouragement to persons engaging 
with farms, on which everything was to be done; but now that 
the improvements are nearly completed, it does not appear that 
the endurance of nineteen years, now adopted, is objectionable. 
The same may be said of the other covenants of the leases, some 
of the most important of which are,-that the tenant shall con- 



ALFOKD. 



Slime all the fodder on the farm, with the exception of that of the 
last crop ; and, not restricting him absolutely to any particular 
rotation of crops, that he shall yet never take more than the two 
customary grain crops in succession after three years grass ; and 
thaf at the end of his lease he shall leave, specified proportions of 
his farm in grass, of specified ages. Sub-letting is strictly prohi- 
bited, with the exception of certain specified crofts, that may be sub- 
let to farm-servants, or persons of certain handicrafts, needed ui 
the neighbourhood; and, however much this arrangement may 
be condemned by some persons as interfering with an open trade 
in farming, yet, it is humbly conceived, none could be more effi- 
cient for preserving some of the best interests of society ; as it al- 
ways secures to the proprietor of land the power of excluding per- 
sons of bad or doubtful character from among his tenantry. There 
is at least no doubt entertained, that the peaceable and orderly 
habits of the people of this parish have been preserved from con- 
tamination by the prohibition of sub-letting. 

Farm Buildings and Inclosures. — The farm buildings are now 
in general sufficiently substantial, and laid out on commodious plans. 
The materials employed in them have been already stated. The 
arrangements between landed proprietors and their tenants, regard- 
ing houses, are not uniform ; but the most frequent practice is, 
that the land-owner advances the necessary rough wood, and the 
tenant executes the building and work at his own expense, receiv- 
ing an obligation for payment, at the end of his lease, of the value, 
determined by arbitration ; but limited either to a maximum sum, 
or to a certain plan and specification of houses, agree.d on by the 
parties. By this system much the larger part is advanced by 
the tenant ; and it would therefore be highly objectionable, were 
there a want of capital among the tenantry, which happily does 
not appear to have been the case in this parish. Where the tenant 
has sufficient capital for the purpose, it is undoubtedly highly expe- 
dient, that he should have that deep interest in having the build- 
ings executed economically, and kept in constant repair, which the 
above arrangement gives him. Experience has proved, here, that 
the tenants can build and keep houses in repair, much more eco- 
nomically than the land-owners. 

About half the arable lands of the parish are enclosed and subdi- 
vided ; and this improvement, so important to the mixed husbandry, 
IS m the course of being gradually extended to the remainder. 
The fences are dry-stone walls, the materials for which are either 



512 



AHEUDEENSHIRK. 



gathered from the surface, ,or dug from quarries. The whole ex- 
pense of a fencible stone wall is 8d. per yard on an average ; and 
at this rate the inclosing and subdividing a farm of 100 acres, 
possessing ordinary advantages of march fences, is L. 1 50. The 
common arrangements regarding fences are these, — the plan of the 
subdivisions must be approved of by the land-owner, and the ten- 
ant then receives an obligation from him to be paid at the end of 
his lease, for such fences as he may build in conformity with the 
plan. In some cases the land-owner has paid the expense of build- 
ing and quarrying, the tenant carting the materials. 

About thirty years ago, many attempts were made, and much ex- 
pense was incurred by the proprietors to raiise thorn hedges; but the 
result was so nearly an utter failure at the time, that the planting 
of hedges was quite given up. As it was observed that there are 
several solitary thorn trees, of considerable age and great vigour, 
dispersed over the parish, this furnished a proof, that neither the 
soil nor climate are unadapted to the plant, and led to the infe- 
rence, that there had been some mismanagement which occasioned 
the failure ; and the consideration of several circumstances led at 
the same time to the belief, that the errors had consisted chiefly in 
planting the thorns too thick, the distance was six or eight inches, 
and clipping them too early and closely. Under these impres- 
sions, in 1825, a hedge of 240 yards was planted, of three years' 
old thorns, placed at 15 inches distance from each other, on land 
of medium quality, well limed and dunged, and laid perfectly flat 
across the line of the hedge, to receive the full eff"ect of rain, as 
the thorn tree is evidently impatient of drought. The hedge was 
kept clear of weeds ; and the shears were no otherwise used than 
to prevent the plants from rising higher than five feet and a half, 
and more recently to cautiously reduce the sides to an even line. 
The success has, in this instance, been complete. The hedge 
was already fencible in the autumn of 1829 against all but vicious 
cattle ; and has since greatly improved. A. desire to obtain thorn 
hedges has now arisen among some of the tenants, and a consider- 
able extent of them has been planted within the last two years. 

Some Improvements suggested.— It is not pretended that, under 
this head, we could be entitled to discuss the merits of the gene- 
ral plan of husbandry pursued by practical men, who have cau- 
tiously examined so many improvements, and adopted those which 
they have felt best promoted their interests ; but there is one de- 
fect attending the present established rotation of crops, on some

of the richest but damp fields, and also on the newly reclaimed 
lands, that it would be very desirable to remedy. On these lands 
the pasture of the two last years of grass often fails much ; which 
is evidently owing to the pasture plants, now cultivated, being un- 
suitable to these soils. The red clover is only biennial, and makes 
no show in the pastures any where ; and the raygrass is the native 
of a very dry and rich soil, and cannot bear damp, and it also dis- 
appears on these soils — so that the white clover only remains, and 
in too small quantity ; and as every plant has naturally its vigour 
of growth confined to one part of the summer only, it requires 
more plants than one to make a permanent summer pasture. Un- 
der these circumstances, it would surely be desirable to sow, along 
with the comm.only used grass seeds, which answer well enough for 
the hay crop, some seeds of those grasses, which naturally grow in 
damp lands, and at the same time are readily eaten by the cat- 
tle. Of these there are found several in our richest pieces of na- 
tural meadows, one or more of which might answer the purpose ; 
as the roughish meadow-grass, thesmooth-stalked meadow-grass, 
the hard fescue-grass, the meadow foxtail -grass, and the crested 
dogs-tail-grass. Several of these are indeed often observed to 
make their appearance naturally, in some considerable quantity, 
in the pastures we have referred to, after the raygrass fails in them ; 
and, where the land is occasionally left for several years in pasture, 
come at last to make a rich sward. They would surely succeed if  
sown. 

There is a considerable extent of land, under peculiar circum- 
stances, the management of which might be changed to great ad- 
vantage. This consists of the flat haugh lands within the narrow 
lengthened hollows scooped out by the smaller rivers. At pre- 
sent, these streams form generally the marches between neighbour- 
ing estates or farms ; and each occupier ploughs and crops, in the 
course of bis rotation, the haugh on his own side ; where, from the 
lowness of its situation, the crop is often lost by floods, or the soil 
carried away if the land is in turnips, and, at the same time, slips of 
fine grass often cannot be turned to any account. All attempts made 
to straight these streams and render them fences have produced 
only great injury, where the river has any considerable descent ; 
as m the straight course the water acquires an irresistible impetu- 
osity during floods, and undermines and tumbles down its banks, 
covermg and permanently spoiling any flat land below with the 
debris ; so that here is another inconvenience, that the farm can

have no fence at the river. This, it is conceived, might be all 
easily mended. The haughs of the river hollows, when left uncul- 
tivated, become the most valuable pastures which we possess ; and 
to these they should be exclusively devoted. They could easily 
be shut in, for their whole length, by fences running parallel to 
the streams, and so high as to be beyond the reach of Hoods ; and 
each land-owner or farmer could have his share at either end, di- 
vided off by a short fence running across the line of the stream, 
part of which, near the water, might be a paling for removing from 
the winter floods. The rich grass, the good shelter, and the sure 
water for the cattle in these hollows, would make them the most 
profitable of all ; whereas, under the present management, they 
rent lower than any other lands. 

Another improvement would add greatly to the comfort of a 
great number of individuals. The small crofts are managed under 
the seven-shift rotation, which has been adopted on the larger 
farms ; and as it is impracticable to fence in all the small divisions 
of thJse, on account of the magnitude of the expense in relation 
to the extent of the land, the cow, which is so necessary to the 
comfort and health of the cottager's family, and on account of 
which the croft is rented, becomes the cause of much trouble and 
wearisomeness to some of them,--for she must be herded on her 
small patch of grass by one of the children. It would be easy to 
remedy this by fencing in a proper proportion of the croft, perhaps 
about three-sevenths, for permanent pasture, the expense of which 
would not be exorbitant, and leaving the other four-sevenths for a 
shorter rotation of cropping. The richest land should be chosen 
for the permanent pasture to insure its being always good; and 
perhaps the landed proprietors could not more effectually increase 
the comforts of their cottagers' families than by interfering to en- 
force this simple arrangement, and giving orders that the grass 
should never be broken up. The cow could be kept better with 
little trouble'; and the child would be set at liberty to go to school. 
A system of soiling could not be adopted on these small posses- 
sions ; as they have no resources in early summer before the grass 
is sufficiently grown for cutting. 

Fisheries —In former times, the Don was celebrated tor the 
abundance of its salmon; and so excellent was the rod-fishing in 
this vale, even within the memory of the present generation, that 
one gentleman killed, in the course of one season, no fewer than 
forty fish out of a single pool of the river, which was, at the same 



ALFORD. 



515 



time, fished in by many other individuals. There are twenty- 
seven such pools in this parish, so that the fishery must have been 
an important one ; but now, owing to the river being diverted from 
its bed near the sea for manufacturing purposes, no salmon are 
found in it here, excepting after high floods that fill the bed, and 
enable the fish to make their way over the wears. The Don and 
the Leochal are both remarkably fine trouting streams. 

Average gross amount of Raw Produce raised in the Parish. — 
The following table of this was made up after a very particular in- 
quiry of nearly all the possessors of land, the answers to which, it 
is believed, were generally given with great accuracy and fidelity. 
The yearly value of pasture, turnips, and fodder could be ascer- 
tained only from the [yearly gross profit of black-cattle, young 
horses, sheep, and pigs ; and this has been estimated not only by 
the particular inquiries, but by an average applied to the whole 
number of beasts from certain known stocks, of which regular ac- 
counts have been kept, the results derived from these two sources 
agreeing well with each other.

In making the inquiries regarding the yearly produce, it was 
easy at the same time to obtain the following table of agricultural 
capital employed in the parish; and it is deemed too important 
to be withheld, as there is no branch of the statistics of the coun- 
try regarding which greater ignorance prevails. The capital of

ABERDEENSTIIUE. 



manufactures and commerce is brought together in immense mas- 
ses, that powerfully strike the senses, and its magnitude is readily 
allowed. That of agriculture is dispersed, in relatively small 
parts, over an immense extent of surface ; and the total amount, 
although, including the value of the land, it vastly outweighs that 
of all other real capital, is too often overlooked by the statesman 
and political economist. 

In the following table, the value of the cattle is deduced from 
a careful determination of the average value of some stocks, by 
persons of competent skill; the prime cost of the horses m the 
same manner; the value of the farm-steadings is ascertamed by 
some which are of the common construction, recently valued by 
arbitration ; that of the fences by the common well-established 
rate ; and that of the machines, implements, harness, &amp;c. by in- 
quiries of the original makers.

There are some small branches of farming capital, as the furni- 
ture and bedding for farm- servants, which cannot be estimated, 
being mingled with property, which, as far as it is used by the far- 
mer and his family, is not capital but expenditure. 

It will now be seen how far the L. 5913, 15s. left for paying 
money wages and interest of capital, and replacing wasting ca- 
pital, is adequate to these purposes. The money wages of 243 
constant labourers is L.2916; to which is to be added at least 
one-fifth for additional labourers in harvest, making in all L.3499, 
4s.; leaving only L.2414, lis. for replacing capital and affording 
interest, — a sum totally inadequate for these purposes. 

In short, the fact cannot be denied, that, since ther year 1820, 
agriculture has not been in a prosperous condition. The cultiva- 
tors of this parish have, however, hitherto happily escaped that 
ruin, which has long since overtaken those of so many other parts 
of the kingdom ; and it is a question of great interest, " To what 
causes do they owe the exemption " 

The first and most obvious is, that the tenantry here have 
not been speculators. Their capital is their own, the well-earn- 
ed fruit of their industry and economy ; and when the money- 
price of their produce fell, they were not caught with a money 
debt, to the liquidation of which that produce would have then 
proved unequal. 

The second cause is, their habitual temperance, which enabled 
them instantly, on the fall of prices, to retrench any superfluity to 
which more prosperous times had given encouragement. 

The third, that the farmers and their families are, to a very 
great extent, their own labourers, and so can subsist by the wages 
of their labour, when their capital fails to yield them a proper re- 
turn. 

The last, that the agricultural resources of the parish were not 
as yet all rendered fully available at the period when the prices 
fell. The new fields that had just then only been added to the 
cultivation, or were in the course of being cultivated, have since 
enlarged their produce in quantity, to make up in part for the low 
price ; and they have thus been enabled to struggle on, though 



518 ADERDKENSHIRE. 

not deriving that emolument from their capital to which they might 
be well entitled. 

There are at present, however, obvious symptoms in a gradual 
but continued fall of the wages of labour, and the difficulty with 
which workmen can obtain employment, and the earnestness with 
which they solicit it, that matters are, from period to period, 
getting worse, and that the distress is probably approaching this 
parish, which we have hitherto so fortunately escaped ; and it thus 
becomes a question of deeper interest than the former, " To what 
is the present depressed state of the agriculturist owing " 

We shall look in vain for the cause of the depression in any 
thing peculiar to his particular pursuit ; for the same depression is 
unhappily extended to every branch of productive industry. We 
shall find a sufficient cause for the whole in one disastrous act of 
the Legislature, and that is the act of 1819, restoring a metallic 
currency. 

Gardens and Orcliards.— There are good gardens at Haughton 
and Breda ; and "a considerable orchard at the former ; but we 
cannot state the amount of the produce. 

Woods.— The annual fellings and thinnings of wood have pro- 
duced on an average yearly, for some time past, about L. 250; 
but this bears no relation to the actual value of wood now growing 
in the parish, which is great, but cannot be estimated without an 
extensive survey by professional men. 

Before concluding the subject of agriculture, it deserves notice, 
that through some cause which we cannot explain, the contents of 
this parish are considerably overrated in the Statistical Account of 
it published by Sir John Sinclair. The arable land is made equal 
to 4500 imperial acres, whereas some old plans with which we are 
favoured, along with more recent surveys, prove it was then only 
about 4000 imperial acres. The wood also is stated as being then 
equal to 875 imperial acres, whereas it cannot have exceeded 500 
imperial acres. The whole parish is made nearly 10,000 imperial 
acres, and we have found it only 8715. 

Mamifadures.— These are very trifling. The six weavers weave 
various fabrics for home use, of home-spun yarns, from materials 
chiefly imported ; and there is a small manufactory, by some wo- 
men, of stockings also for home use. It is probable the whole 
value does not amount to L. 200. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Totcn.— The nearest market-town with which the parish 



ALFORD. 519 

has a regular communication, and to which the disposable grain is 
chiefly sent, is Aberdeen, at twenty-seven miles' distance. 

Means of Communication.— k daily post from Aberdeen passes 
through the parish ; and the Alford post-office is at the border of 
it. The parish is admirably well accommodated with good roads. 
A turnpike road, of which there are three miles and a half in the 
parish, leads to Aberdeen ; and in the other direction extends to 
Strathdon, at the distance of eighteen miles west. A branch turns 
north to Huntly, joining there the great north road. A finely 
kept road, executed under the authority of the Parliamentary 
Commissioners for Highland Roads and Bridges, crosses the pa- 
rish from north to south at the broadest part ; and farther south 
crosses in succession two lines of turnpike roads, opening a fine 
communication in many directions on that side. There is only 
one deficiency, — in the Parliamentary road not being extend- 
ed over the Cairn-a-mont. 'J'he extension of that road, there, 
would shorten our distance from Brechin and Dundee about 
twenty-five miles ; and the distance from Huntly to these places 
nearly twenty miles. The commutation roads within the parish, 
made by an assessment of L. 2 on every L.100 valued rent, and 
all the private roads, are mostly in a good state of repair. These 
good roads have afforded facilities for communication and land- 
carriage, without which the agricultural improvements could not 
have been executed. 

A stage-coach passes through the parish three times a-week to 
Aberdeen. 

Bridges. — We possess also the advantage of all necessary 
bridges. A beautiful granite bridge, over the Don, about a mile 
from ther church, was built by the Parliamentary Commissioners 
in 1810, at an expense of L. 2000; and more recently another was 
built by them over the Leochal, close at the church, in the line of 
their road. These works are of the utmost utility, not only to the 
parish but the public at large, being in the line by which many 
thousands of cattle pass yearly to the south. The expense of the 
bridges and Parliamentary road was L. 5000 in all, one-half of 
which was derived from subscriptions by the gentlemen in the 
, neighbourhood. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The situation of the church is sufficiently 
convenient for all the parish. It was built in 1804 and enlarged 
in 1826, and accommodates 550 persons. At a temporary divi- 
sion, arranged among the heritors, it was reconmiended to them 



520 



ABERDKENSIIIRE. 



to adopt the principle of a former practice in dividing parish 
churches in Scotland, by which six feet of the area from end to 
ernl was allotted to the kirk-session for the right ordering of public 
worship, and celebration of the communion. This was listened 
to ; and the whole table-seats, of equivalents for them where some , 
of them were preferred by the principal tenants for their private 
seats, were assigned to the session for the above purposes. These 
seats accommodate 140 persons; and the part of them not imme- 
diately necessary for the ordering of the worship, the session leave 
open to all such families, promiscuously, as have not sufficient 
room of their own. This arrangement has answered admirably 
"well ; and every soul of the parish, who comes to the church, finds 
a seat of which no one is entitled to dispossess him. 

The manse was built in 1718. It is a small house, not suffi- 
cient for the accommodation of a family ; but arrangements are in 
progress for enlarging it. 

The glebe contains 4f imperial acres of arable land, besides a 
garden of nearly half an imperial acre. 

The stipend, which exhausts the teinds, consists of L.161, 8s. 
8d. in money; 53 bolls, 3 firlots, 1 peck, 3f lippies meal; and 4 
bolls, 1 firlot, 1 peck, lippies bear, payable by the fiars prices 
of Aberdeenshire. The Crown is patron of the church. 

The number of families attending the Established Church is 
176; of individuals, 858. Episcopalian families, 2 ; of indivi- 
duals, 9. Seceder families, 5 ; of individuals, 26. Roman Ca- 
tholic individual, 1. 

Divine service is very well attended at the Established Church j 
and the average number of communicants is 455. 

No collections have been made in the church for purposes ex- 
tra parochial, excepting for the General Assembly's Highland 
Schools, and Foreign Missions. The average of the collections for 
these has been L.9, 7s. 6d. 

Educatio7i.— The parochial school is the only one in the parish. 
The branches of instruction taught at it are, Latin, practical ma- 
thematics, book-keeping, arithmetic, writing, and reading, and in- 
struction in the truths of religion. 

The school salary is L.28, 18s. 9|d. ; allowance for garden, 
L.2, 2s. 9d. ; a legacy to the teacher, yearly, L.2. Total, L.34, 
ls.6|d. School fees per quarter, Latin, mathematics, or book- 
keeping, 5s.; arithmetic, 3s. 6d. ; reading and writing, 2s. 6d. i 
reading, 2s. Fees are not taken from poor people.

The teacher has not at present the legal accommodation ; but is 
as well in-ovided for by the heritors, and with his own consent, m 
an excellent farm-house, with a proper teaching room near it, 
somewhat more centrical for the parish than the church. 

AH the inhabitants have learnt to read and write, and always 
have been, and now are, alive to the benefits of education. 

CharitaUe and other Institutions.The parish makes a yearly 
collection for the Infirmary at Aberdeen, and so possesses the right 
of sending patients there. It collects also for a pauper lunatic 
fund, at present in the course of being established under the ma- 
nao-ement of the presbytery. There were two Friendly Societies in 
the parish ; but, having felt annoyed by the act 1828, in some nan- 
ner that we do not pretend to explain, the most important ot them 
is dissolved. It is much to be regretted that anything should 
have disconcerted these voluntary associations ; for they certainly 
here served to ward off pauperism from not a few persons. Their 
rates might not have been judiciously established at first ; but, with 
the usual prudence of the people, they had introduced clauses in 
their regulations, that their expenditure should be limited by their 
■income, which would ultimately have secured their stability and 
efficiency. At present all spirit for such societies is quite extin- 
guished, under the apprehension that the laws regarding them may 
be again changed. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The average number of poor re- 
ceiving parochial aid is 7, chiefly aged females. The average 
sum given to each cannot easily be stated, as the allowances vary 
continually, according to circumstances carefully ascertained every 
half year by the kirk-session. 

The sums for their relief are yearly : 

Collections in the church, . . . • L. 27 10 0 

Interest of L. 200 legacies, after deducting L, 2 of one legacy left, to 

the schoolmaster of the parish, . . .    

Interest of L. 130, gradually saved, . . . 3 4 0 

L.38 14 0 

The L.130 form a fund, to which the session, with consent of 
the heritors, can have recourse for supplying the wants of a more 
numerous poor, who would require aid in any year of great scar- 
city. 

A plan, adopted by the inhabitants, for providing for peculiar 
cases of distress, has succeeded so well, that it deserves to be de- 
scribed. 

When any great loss has overtaken a poor family, as loss by

fire, or the sickness of the father on whose labour they depended, 
or the death of their cow, which they have not funds to replace, 
or any other event has occurred which makes it necessary to aid 
them, and it is obvious, at the same time, that the most efective 
method of doing so is, to give them a considerable aid at once, to 
restore them to that condition in which they shall be again able 
to make provision for themselves, in that case, the principal in- 
habitants and their sons, having obtained the sanction of the kirk- 
session, form themselves into committees, and personally make col- 
lections foT the family in their respective districts, of money or 
meal as the case may require. These collections, managed with 
great prudence, have never failed to answer the intended purpose, 
and have restored to independence some families which might 
otherwise have continued long burdensome to the pubUc funds. 

But we should ill represent the manner in which the wants of 
the poor are supplied, were we to exhibit only the amount of the 
pubhc funds and collections. That which passes through the 
hands of the kirk-session is only a part of the alms of the in- 
habitants of the parish. They are perpetually ministering to 
the necessities of their poor neighbours in many other ways. The 
farmers, with their servants and horses, repair their dwellings, and 
cart home their fuel. They frequently send them supplies of all 
the sorts of provisions which their produce affords. When a poor 
person or family has no cow, milk is supplied from the cows 
of some family in the neighourhood ; and it has occurred only 
rarely, in some peculiar cases, that the kirk-session have needed 
to hire nurses for the sick paupers ; for all around them watch 
them with an affectionate care that could admit of no purchase, 
and be compensated by no earthly reward ; and the poorest of all 
are as liberal of these last valuable services as any other persons. 

There is a general disposition among the poor to refrain from 
seeking parochial relief ; and it has been discovered active under 
such privation, as to excite a great curiosity to ascertain all the 
motives by which they are actuated. A feeling of degradation is 
not the only motive ; for there is no reproach attached to una- 
voidable poverty among the inhabitants ; besides, experience has 
proved in many other parts of the kingdom, that where this mo- 
tive is unaided by any other, it soon ceases to be eflfective ; and, 
moreover, those very persons who are so reluctant to receive aid 
from the public funds, take, without any reluctance, the aid oflfered 
them by an individual, and make no attempt to conceal their douig 



ALFOIID. 



523 



so. A particular inquiry has often elicited from themselves, that 
they are actuated by another motive. The public fund for the 
supply of the poor is in their eyes too sacred to be applied to, but 
when an overwhelming necessity compels. To that fund they 
themselves have willingly contributed, in their better days, from 
motives of the noblest order, whose power does not diminish as 
they approach the close of life. They must not undo their own 
charitable deed, by taking off the poor man's money. 

There is no difficulty whatever experienced in supplying the 
wants of the poor, in a competent manner, on the truly Christian 
plan which we have now described. There was even no difficulty 
in the years of great scarcity, 1799-1800, and 1816-1817, when 
the numbers of the poor were greatly increased ; for the kirk- 
session, on an appeal to the heritors and inhabitants, were imme- 
diately answered with supplies adequate to the urgency of the case. 

Fairs. — Two very considerable annual fairs are held in the pa- 
rish for the sale of black-cattle, one on the Tuesday before the 
second Wednesday of June, new style, and the other on the Friday 
after the second Thursday of September, old style. There is also 
a fair for black-cattle and horses, and the sale of grain by sample, 
on the first Monday of every month, from November to May, both 
inclusive. 

Inn. — There is one inn in the parish. 

Fuel. — Of fuel there is a great deficiency. The mosses are 
nearly exhausted ; and the mere cutting, carting, and breaking up 
the fire wood, which is very inferior, consisting only of thinnings, 
make it as expensive as English coal. Recourse is, therefore, of 
necessity had to this last for a large part of the supply ; and the 
prime cost and sea and land carriage to Alford of a ton of New- 
castle coal is L.l, 15s. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
It has been seen that there are many things in this parish 
which favourably influence the intellectual, moral, and reli- 
gious character of the inhabitants, in which perhaps there has 
been little change for nearly a century. Respecting their phy- 
sical condition, very valuable improvements have taken place 
since the time of the former Statistical Account. They are 
much better lodged, and, on the whole, better clothed. The 
great improvements in agriculture have raised for them much 
extended resources ; of the benefit of which, however, the act of 
1819 has in a great measure deprived them. The more import-

ant differences between the old agriculture and the new, we have 
already detailed. The result of the new is, that, after supplying 
an increased population, the parish can now export about double 
the quantity of grain, and more than double the number of beasts, 
and these of a greatly improved quality ; at the same time it has 
been enriched and highly ornamented, by extensive additional 
plantation. 

• November 1840 The above account was written so far back as the year 1831 ; 

all the materials for it having been collected in the summer of that year, excepting 
the thermometrical tables, which are added now. It is necessary to notice several 
improvements which have been since adopted in the parish, and some others of a 
more extended nature, by which it has been benefited. 

1. On the 3d December 1831, the Vale of Alford Agricultural Association was 
instituted, through the influence of the Honourable the Master of Forbes, and has 
since been liberally aided by him and the other land-owners of the Vale. Many in- 
habitants of this parish are members ; and it has greatly promoted a spirit of agri- 
cultural improvement. 

2. The regulations of excise, complained of in the Account, as preventing the 
inhabitants from making malt of their own bear, have been, through the exertions 
of the Honourable Captain Gordon, M. P. for Aberdeenshire, much modified, and 
deprived, in a great degree, of their objectionable character. 

3. The facility of transporting cattle by steam-ships has made many farmers de- 
vote their attention to the feeding of beasts for the London market, which they find 
much more profitable than rearing store beasts only. 

4. Bulls of the short-horned breed of England have been introduced, for crossing 
the native breeds of cattle ; by which animals are produced of quicker growth, larger 
size and much more profitable in every view than any before bred here. 

5. A Vale of Alford Saving's Bank was instituted in 1839, which is very popular 
in tills parish, and promises great benefit to the labouring population. 

6 A parish library was, in 1839, established by subscription, under very judicious 
regulations. It already possesses a good collection of the best English books, which 

aremuchread  subscription was raised by the heritors and inhabitants, to 

build a school-room for a female school, and dwelling house for the mistress, both of 
a commodious and substantial kind. The teaching in the school commenced in 1837, 
and is continued with great success. It has been endowed with a yearly salary to 
the mistress by the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge. This is our 
greatest improvement. The young girls of both rich and poor receive the proper 
instruction in religion, literature, and the branches peculiar to their sex, while re- 
sident at home, and under then- parents' eye. 

It would be a breach of duty not to add, that, in 1832, the heritors of the parish 
made a iudicious and handsome addition to the manse. It is now a large and very 
commodious house. The heritors, also, some years ago, raised the schoohnaster's 
salary to the legal maximum.

PRESBYTERY OF ALFORD, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. ROBERT MEIKLEJOHN, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, 4-c.— The original name of this parish was 
Invernochty, so called from the church being situated at one pe- 
riod, it is said, at the confluence of the Nochty and the Don. 
The etymology of the modern name is sufficiently obvious, and 
descriptive of the locality of the parish, which lies chiefly in an ex- 
tended strath stretching from the source of the Don down its 
course, from west to east, to the influx of the Kindy with that river. 

Strathdon is the most westerly parish in the synod and county 
of Aberdeen, and conterminous on the west with Kirkmichael, and 
the district of that parish now allotted to the Government church 
at Tomantoul ; on the south, with Glenmuick and Coldstone ; 
on the east, with Migvie now annexed to Tarland, and Towie ; 
and on the north, with Glenbucket, Cabrach, and Inveraven. It 
is about 23 miles in length, and from 3 to 8 in breadth. 

The parish is extremely irregular in its figure, both from the 
mountainous nature of the country, and from being intersected by 
other parishes. A portion of Tarland parish, 4 miles long and 2 
brod, containing a population of 231, is situated in the very centre 
of it. At the junction of the Bucket with the Don, Glenbucket in- 
tersects Strathdon for about three-quarters of a mile ; and where 
the Deskry falls into the Don, Migvie juts in, scarcely three miles 
from the church. 

Topographical Appearances. — The appearance of the surface of 
this parish is singularly diversified, and, at many points, of great 
beauty — now presenting all the luxuriance of a fertile strath, and 
again all the wild and rugged scenery of the Highlands. One fea- 
ture of beauty is the river Don winding prettily through the main 
strath. Along its 'banks, there is a considerable extent of arable 
land, including some fine haughs subdivided into well cultivated 
fields ; while, in the lower half at least of the parish, the sides of 



52G 



ABERDEENSHIRE. 



the hills ure covered with thriving plantations. Farther up, the 
scenery is of a different, but not less beautiful character. The 
strath becomes narrower, the mountains rise up precipitously, and 
on their sides, reaching almost to the river, here and there are 
clumps of coppice-woods, composed chiefly of birch, interspersed 
occasionally with pines and aspens, which are in fine contrast; and 
in spring and autumn the whole is beautifully tinged with shades 
of almost every varied hue. The highest district consists almost 
entirely of moorland and mountain, and is of a bleak and barren 
appearance, particularly toward the source of the Don. 

Besides the strath of the Don, there are five or six glens, wild 
and sequestered, indeed, but not destitute of beauty and interest, 
which generally lie nearly at right angles to the main strath, bend- 
ing towards the west at the upper end. Except in Glenkindy, tlie 
lower part of Gleuernan, and the plantations of Auchernach in 
Glennochty, there is little or no wood in them, unless it be some 
detached bushes clumps of natural birch ; yet these glens, in the 
stillness of a summer afternoon, with the clear streams flowing 
through the soft green glades, and the mountains rising abruptly 
on either side covered to the top with long thick heath in full 
bloom, afford a richness of beauty rising almost to grandeur. 

Situated in, or in a branch of, the Grampians, the glens just 
mentioned are separated by masses of mountains, many of which 
are of considerable altitude ; yet there is little either in their con- 
formation or character that requires particular notice. The most 
remarkable mountain, which, although not actually in the parish, 
lies contiguous to the southern boundary, is Morven, 2880 feet 
according to Dr S, Keith above the level of the sea. The 
principal mountains in the parish are Scroulach, 2700 feet, resting 
towards the west on the Glaschill, over which the old military line 
of road passes from the south, by Corgarff" Castle to Fort Geoi-ge. 
Cairnmore, and Ben-Newe, each 1800 feet; and Lonach, 1200 
feet. There is also worthy of notice a mountain named the Green- 
hill, so called from the absence of heath, and the north and south- 
east side being partially covered with verdure. It is composed of ser- 
pentine. A quarry has recently been opened on the north side, from 
which large masses are with little difficulty extracted. It is easily 
dressed for building purposes, and looks well in coursed ruble-work 

♦ Lonach is the aogan or watch-word of tlie Strathdon meu On the summit of 
this hill, a large cairn was erected, in 1823, by the tenantry ui honour of Sn- Charles 
Forbes's elevation to a Baronetcy, with an inscription.

when newly built, but, after long exposure to the weather, it as- 
sumes a clingy grey appearance. Any attempts that have been made 
to employ it for finer purposes have not been attended with success, 
;is it is too soft to admit of a very high polish. On the south-west 
of the hill, the serpentine crops out in masses of considerable 
height, having, at a distance, the appearance of the ruins of old 
castles. On the western extremity, asbestos is found in abundance, 
lying on the surface of the dilTerent eminences. Upon the whole, 
the mountains of this parish are much inferior in picturesque effect 
and rugged outline to the sister district of the head of the Dee. 

Meteorology. — No regular account has ever been kept, so far as 
is known, of the meteorology of this district ; but it may be men- 
tioned that the highest temperature, indicated by the thermometer 
within the observation of the writer, during the last seven years, 
was 83" Fahrenheit in the shade, on the 7th July 1833, and he 
has been informed, on unquestionable authority, that in 1826, at 
Auchernach, it stood at 90° in the shade. On the 14th February 
1838, at 8 o'clock p. M., it stood at 8° below zero, or 40° below 
the freezing point. No storm of such severity has been known 
since 1814, as that in the beginning of the year 1838, which con- 
tinued from the 8th of January, with only partial mitigation of 
rigour, till the 19th of April. 

The range of the barometer is extensive. On the 29th Novem- 
ber 1838, it fell to 27.50 ; and on the lih, January 1839 to 27.20. 
The highest point reached, that we have observed, is 30.50, on 
the 10th April 1839. It is subject to very rapid depression and 
elevation, rising or falling sometimes three-fourths, or a whole 
inch in twelve or twenty-four hours ; and hence it would 
prove a fallacious guide to trust, irrespective of contingent cir- 
cumstances, to the rising and falling of the barometer as an index 

• Tha writer has not a self-registering thermometer, and may not have observed 
the lovvtst degree of temperature that occurred during this very severe storm. It is 
unnecessary to give the temperature of every day, but it is worthy of notice that the 
thermometer did not average higher than 24° at 8 o'clock a. m. from the 13th January 
to the end of February. The following are some of the more excessive degrees of 
cold that were remarked, viz. : —

of foul and fair weather. With a strong easterly wind, we often 
see a sudden start of f or | of an inch, while a three days' tor- 
rent of rain follows. Again, a sudden fall with a north-west wind 
often indicates a coming hwricane, as during the series of re- 
markable high winds in spring 1837, when the barometer fell 
27 inches without rain. 

The aurora borealis is very common, especially during the 
winter months, and of great brilliancy. Twice in the course of 
the last five years, a beautiful luminous arch shot athwart the ze- 
nith, at right angles with the magnetic meridian, irradiating the 
heavens with a vivid light. Towards the end of 1 837, the polar 
lights assumed a new appearance: the fitful dancing of the 
streamers was exchanged for a deep red glare, resembling the 
vivid reflection of an extensive moor-burning. On the 25th of 
January 1838, when the thermometer stood at 2°, the aurora was 
unusually bright, and the hissing sound about which so many 
people are still sceptical remarkably audible. 

Climate, Diseases, -c— The elevation of the river Don, ac- 
cording to the authority already quoted, at a point about two miles 
above the church, and 47 from Aberdeen, is 950 feet above the 
level of the sea, while at its source it is stated to be 1740 feet. 
We, therefore, necessarily experience a keen atmosphere, but the 
climate is, nevertheless, bracing and healthy ; so much so, that 
valetudinarians frequently come to reside in the strath during the 
summer months for the benefit of the pure air, and it is believed 
the influx would be greatly increased, were there more convenience 
of lodging, &amp;c. The climate of the upper or Corgarff" district is 
distinctly diff"erent, and much inferior to that of what may be 
termed Strathdon proper. The parish is liable to the most seri- 
ous injury from spring and autumnal frosts, especially the latter ; 
but the CorgarS' district, in an aggravated degree, suffers from 
this calamity Few harvests pass in which the crops are not par- 
tially injured, but in many they are entirely ruined. It is true, for 
the five years previous to 1836, frosted grain was almost unknown 
in the parish, and fond hopes began to be entertained that a be- 
neficial change for the better had taken place in the seasons, and 
various sage theories were propounded satisfactorily to account for 
the fact. That year, however, the crop in the upper district was 
almost totally lost, and in the present crop, 1838, there is not 
one boll of safe seed in the parish. 

 It is a fact worth notice, connected with this subject, that it is a universally re- 



STKATHDON. 



529 



Another evil- the Strathdon farmer lias to contend with is the 
high winds. From the funnel shape of the strath, the wind being 
confined by the mountains on each side may be said to blow 
only in two directions. From the west, varying a point or two 
north and south down, and from the east up the strath. The 
latter, however, except in spring, is comparatively of rare occur- 
rence, and generally only lasts three days, bringing continued 
heavy rain. But by far the most prevailing wind is from the 
north-west, which often sweeps down the valley with tremendous 
violence, in the more exposed situations shaking the standing 
corn, so. as to leave the straw completely thrashed, and sometimes 
actually overturning the stacks that have been led into the barn- 
yard. • 

Epidemic distempers are seldom known, and there is no endemi- 
cal disease. Stone or gravel is mentioned in the former account as 
very prevalent. It is now confined chiefly to one glen, Nochty. 
A few years ago there were five or six cases at one time in that 
glen. One individual, in 1832, 73 years of age, went to Liston in 
Edinburgh, and had three stones the size of a hen's egg extracted. 
In a few weeks he returned cured, and at this day retains perfect 
health, walking three miles to church every Sabbath, and dis-, 
charging his duties as an elder, which he has been in the parish 
for upwards of thirty years. Hernia is not uncommon. In seve- 
ral instances young men are afflicted with it. The former account 
states that " consumptions are very rare." There is no reason to 
believe the parish less healthy at the present day than forty years 
ago, but it cannot now be truly said consumption is rare. In its 
various forms, with the diseases resembling and connected with 
it, not a few fall victims to its ravages. Of these diseases, un- 
questionably scrofula is most predominant. One family in the 
parish, consisting of a father and four children, have been cut off 
by it, and the childless widow is a helpless cripple. There is one 
decided case of bronchocele, as distinctly marked as the writer 
has often witnessed it on the Cretins in Canton de Vallois in 
Switzerland. There is, however, no Cretinism or fatuity in this 
case. The woman has a numerous family, but the disease has 
not hitherto appeared in any of her offspring. It is a singular 
circumstance, that the woman lives in the glen already mentioned 

ceiyed opinion amongst the inhabitants of this district, founded on accurate obser- 
vation and verified by experience, if the strath esci.pes frost from the middle to the 
safe ftn- thfsion P''"'''''' """" Oth, tiiey count upon the crop us

as the locality where calculus prevails. It would be an interesting 
subject of inquiry, whether or not the common origin of both dis- 
eases might not be traced to some peculiar impregnation of the 
water in the glen. Still, on the whole, the quantity of disease is 
small, unusually small, when the extreme variations of tempera- 
ture, already referred to, and the insufficient protection that the 
dwellings and clothing of the poorer classes too often afford against 
the rigours of winter, are taken into account. Many of the pa- 
rishioners have from time to time reached an extreme old age. 
About four years ago, one man died in the 103d year of his age. 
When the present incumbent became minister of the parish, his 
session consisted of six elders, the youngest of whom was about 
70. Not many years since, nine Forbeses, born within the sound 
of the kirk bell, met at Bellabeg, whose united ages were 750 
years. 

Hydrography. a parish possessing so much of mountainous 
character there are, of course, innumerable springs, the mean 
temperature of which has not been ascertained with sufficient ac- 
curacy to warrant a statement being given. With one or two ex- 
ceptions, none of them merit particular notice. In Corgarff there is 
one remarkable for its copiousness. During the whole year, it dis- 
charges a volume of water sufficient to turn a mill wheel. The 
burn of Loinhc.irie is entirely supplied by it. Its size, according- 
ly, is nearly the same at its source as when, after its course through 
its little glen, it joins the Don. At Glenconry, there is a chaly- 
beate spring, but, so far as is known, it has never been properly 
analyzed. There are several others that show impregnation with 
iron, but in so slight a degree that particular notice is unnecessary. 

The Don, the second river in the county in point of magnitude, 
takes its rise in this parish, on the very confines of the counties of 
Banff and Aberdeen, and takes its course from west to east, di- 
viding the parish into nearly two equal parts. It runs nearly two 
miles through peat moss before it assumes the appearance of an 
ordinary burn. Then, augmented by the Vannich and other 
mountain-streams, it continues its course about ten miles, without 
attaining any considerable magnitude, till it receives the tributa- 
ries of the lower district. The most considerable of these are the 
Conry, the Ernan, the Carvy, the Nochty, the Deskry, the 
Bucket at the intersection of Glenbucket already noticed, and 

• It is a singular fact, that the source of the Don has lately been actu;»lly turned 
into ihe Avon, in order to turn the neighbouring farmer's mill- wheel.

the Kindy, the eastern boundary of the parish, all which take 
their rise in the glens of their respective names. At the manse 
the Don is about 70 feet wide, and is of very considerable veloci- 
ty. The Don, as well as the lesser streams, is here justly held in 
high repute for angling, few places perhaps in Scotland affording 
better rod-fishing. The trouts are not large in general, perhaps 
not averaging three-fourths of a pound ; although instances are 
occasionally met with reaching three, four, and even sometimes 
five pounds. A few salmon every season find their way up, but 
the number is so small, that it is only in trouting that the angler 
can find amusement. 

Rising in the mountains, and receiving so many mountain tri- 
butaries, the Don often " comes down" with amazing rapidity. 
The most destructive inundation in the memory of man, was in 
1829. The keystone of the arch of Pooldhulie bridge is 25 feet 
above the river, and on that occasion the water, it is said, reached 
within a few feet of it. Much is now doing in the way of making 
embankments, to guard against the devastation of the more ordi- 
nary floods. They have been more frequent since 1829, which is 
believed to be occasioned by the shiftings that then took place in 
the channel of the river.f 

Geology, 5fc. — The prevailing rock in this parish, and particular- 
ly along the line of the Don, is sienite, generally of a granitic ap- 
pearance. It is composed of white felspar and hornblende. These 
minerals are oftentimes in pretty large crystals; and in veins the 
hornblende is to be found in large crystallized masses. Veins or 
beds of compact felspar are found in this sienite. Garnets also 
occur in some places. The most remarkable vein, however, by 
which this rock is traversed, is one of graphite, about four feet 
wide. This graphite is intimately mixed with dark-green chlo- 
rite, which may be partly separated from it by rubbing in a mor- 
tar, diffusing the powder in water, and allowing subsidence to take 
place. The difference in specific gravity, and the scaly form of 
the chlorite, cause the powders to arrange themselves in two dis- 
tinct layers. The graphite is not compact, but like soft clay, 
probably from this intermixture of chlorite. ■ The rock on each 

f.T-"T"":'°"°' P""" entitled « Don," printed in London, 1655, the tributaries 
ot the Don in this parish are described. 

t rwo or three years ago the proprietors of machinery on the Don contemplated 
Duiming three extensive reservoiis in this parish, for a constant and reffular supijlv of 
water ; one on the head of the Don, a second on the Nochty, and a third on the 
iJcskry. Purveys were made, and, it is said, L..30,000 was to be expended. Whether 
the idea IS now abandoned the writer cannot tell.

side of the vein is in a verv shattered state, and has assumed a 
schistaceous appearance. 

On the north-west of the Don, there is a great ridge of serpen- 
tine rock, having in it small disseminated crystals of chromate of 
iron. It is about a mile in breadth adjoining to the sienite ; this 
is in contact westwards with mica-slate, in which are found beds 
or veins of primary limestone. To the mica-slate, clay-slate suc- 
ceeds, and lies upon it. 

in Glenkindy again, in the lower end of the parish, there is an- 
other great dike, or vein of serpentine, between four and five miles 
eastward of the former, and apparently runnjng nearly parallel to 
it. It seems scarcely so broad. It is in contact with graphic 
granite, which probably is connected with the sienite in its vicini- 
ty. A red granite is found in abundance on the other side of the 
hill, which certainly conjoins with the sienite, although its junc- 
tion has not been laid open. 

In this serpentine of Glenkindy, there is at one point a consi- 
derable deposit of bright green, scaly chlorite, and immediately 
below, masses of compact white chlorite of a beautiful appearance. 

In the line of the first mentioned serpentine dike at Corgarff, 
in the south-west end of the parish, the serpentine and limestone 
intermixing form a marble exactly similar to the Glentilt. And 
it is deserving of notice, that the serpentine at Portsoy has con- 
nected with it the Glentilt marble and the graphic granite. The 
Portsoy vein or dike has been traced in a direct line towards Cor- 
garff for thirty miles, and at about twenty miles from Portsoy, it 
seemingly divides into two dikes, which, at the distance of thirty 
miles, are at about five miles from each other, just as in this pa- 
rish, as above stated. What seems further to prove the identity 
of the Portsoy, Corgarff, and Glentilt vein, or at least to call for 
investigation, is that, if a ruler be laid on the map of Scotland, 
in the maps of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Know- 
ledge, on PortsoY and Corgarff, Glentilt will be found withm less 
than four miles of the line. The graphite vein in this parish also 
points to the identity of the Portsoy serpentine, and the dikes of 
that mineral here ; as graphite is found in several localities along 
the directly traceable course of the Portsoy serpentme dike. _ 

It may only be further noticed on this head, that the distinc- 
tive peculiarity of appearance of this section of the Grampians

ds tlie covering of gicavel and debris which rests on he sides of the 
.hills, and generally Ibrms the bed of the Don. The gravel varies 
from a few inches in depth to upwards of 100 feet, with occasion- 
ally interposed strata of sand, and assumes the form of terraces and 
low truncated hills in some localities, as at the mouth of the 
Nochty, in the vicinity of Pooldhulie bridge, and in Glencarvy. 
These have been formed by the action of water. Nearly half a 
mile below the junction of the Nochty with the Don, there is a 
ridge of sienite, traversed by a vertical dike of felspar porphyry, 
which runs right across the valley. At Pooldhulie there is an- 
other similar. Previous to the disruption of these dikes, the 
waters must have been collected in vast lakes, in which deposition 
of the washed down sand and gravel would take place. As these 
dikes gave way, the waters would cut for themselves passages 
through the deposited gravel, and hence occur those terraces, table- 
lands, and low truncated hills. 

Soil. — The prevailing soil in the arable part of the parish is a 
good loam of considerable depth. In the haughs, being alluvial, 
sections of gravelly loam occur, and traces of former beds of the 
river are distinctly marked. The loam is generally superincum- 
jent on gravel, a crust, technically termed a pan, in many places 
intervening, so hard and impervious, that it requires laborious 
pick-work to penetrate it. After it is cut through, gravel or sand 
and sometimes sandy clay succeeds, which generally yields to the 
spade. This description of the subsoil will show the urgency of 
drainage to carry off the surface water. An improvement which is 
yearly being more attended to. 

There are some peculiarities with regard to the soil worth no- 
tice. It is invariably deeper on the north than on the south side 
of the hill or mountain, and by consequence the north lying farms 
are generally supposed to be the best in respect of soil, although 
the advantage is counterbalanced by deficiency in point of climate. 
Again, the best quality of soil is not found in the haughs, but on 
the sides of the hills, and the higher up, as far as cultivation can 
be carried, the soil is said to improve. This is markedly exhibit- 
ed on the farms on the right side of the Nochty. But on the \ery 
tops of several of the hills good soil is found, and in many in- 
stances where they are now covered with heath, traces of the plough 
can still be seen, although the exposed situation, and the risk of 
the crop not ripening, probably led to the abandonment of their 
cultivation. Still, the more elevated fields on the hill side often

escape the August frosts, tliat are so destructive to the crops on 
the margin of the river and rivulets. Last season every potato 
held on the banks of the Don was ruined early in autumn, while 
those at the very head of the glens escaped without injury. This 
may be partly accounted for by the vicinity of the water, but the 
visitations of this scourge are involved in much obscurity. Some 
farms, apparently in every respect as favourably situated as their 
neighbours, are proverbially "frosty places." Nay, sometimes 
one field on the same farm and with the same exposure, is more 
hable to be affected with frost than another only separated from 
it by a fence. 

Connected with the soil, it may be stated as a fact, probably of 
some interest in a geological point of view, that the peat mosses 
are all situated on the tops of the hills, — many of them of vast 
extent and very great depth. The peats taken from the different 
mosses are as various in point of quality and value, as the coals 
from different seams in a coal country. Some of them supply a 
rich black peat, which, when properly dried, becomes almost as 
hard as coal, and makes excellent fuel burning with brightness, 
and throwing out a very strong heat. In Corgarfif and Glen- 
Nochty moss-fir is found. It was, and not at all rarely still is, 
the practice for some of the poorer classes, who cannot afford other 
light, to go to the moss, and with a long probe something like 
a rude auger, search for trunks of trees buried perhaps six or eight 
feet deep. These, often of a diameter of 12 or 13 inches, are 
dug up, carried home, and cut into splits. Then being dried on 
the kilchan, or on a kind of round brander with spiral bars, they are 
made use of in place of candles, thus illustrating the passage in 
Ovid, 

" Flatnmifera pinus manibus succendit ab .itna." 

A good piece emits a strong resinous smell, and when lighted, 
the rosin boils out at the root of the flame like a torch. In pro- 
vincial language they are termed candle, or fir-candle, in contra- 
distinction to a tallow-candle, which is denominated " white 
candle." 

Zoology. — This parish, comprising extensive woods, mountaia, 
and moorland, affords a great variety of animals, some of them 
common to the Lowlands, and others only met with in the High- 
. lands: rather a full account, although without pretension to mi- 
nuteness, of its zoology, may therefore be permitted. 

Among the quadrupeds we have the red-deer, {Cervus Eluphus,}

•formerly only visitors in their passage between the forest of Brae- 
mar and Glenfiddich, but now located in our woods all the year, 
although there is not as yet more than one well authenticated in- 
stanceof their breeding here. The roe-deer {C. capreolus are 
very numerous ; as many as thirteen have been killed in a day. 
The hare; the alpine L. var. ; and the rabbit are found in abun- 
dance, although it is only about twenty years since they last ap- 
peared. The black-legged or hill fox  Vulpes vulgaris, var. only 
is found. Serious injury is sustained by the sheep-farmer from its 
depredations amongst the lambs. Those who possess consider- 
able flocks pay so much per annum to a fox-hunter for destroying 
these creatures. He, at certain seasons, comes with a motley pack, 
composed of a few couples of old fox hounds, greyhounds, lurch- 
ers, and terriers, which are turned into the woods, and the passes 
being guarded by men with guns, five or six are often destroyed in 
a day. The wild cat  Felis catus sylvestris  is met with, but is 
rare. A remarkable specimen, killed in winter 1835-36, measur- 
ed 12 inches round the head, 3 feet 9 inches including the tail in 
length, and weighed about 15 lbs. Five martins  Martes fa- 
gorum, were killed some years ago in one season, in Glenernan ; 
the polecat [Mustela putorius, and the weasel {M. vulg., are 
very common; the stoat or ermine, M. erminea, less so. An 
opinion prevails that, when the stoats are numerous, it is the in- 
dex of a severe season. They were unusually abundant in the 
beginning of the winter 1838; the remark was often made, and 
the prediction fully realized. The otter {Lutra vul. is not un- 
frequently met with on the banks of the Don. The water-rat 
{Arvicola aquatica inhabits the banks of the Don and the Carvy. 
The badger [Meles Taxus has been killed at Coilnabechan, and 
in the woods of Newe, but is now believed to be extinct. The 
hedgehog {Erinaceus Europ. was unknown ten or fifteen years 
ago, but is now common. The brown rat [Mus decumanus, has 
not hitherto obtained a footing with us. Some years ago, a soli- 
■tary specimen was killed at Edinglassie, but the presumption is, 
it had been imported with luggage from London, or from on board 
ship. The black rat [M. Rattus is, however, numerous. It is 
well known, that wherever the brown appears, the black is extir- 
pated. The latter is destructive enough in the house and offices 
of the farmer; but it is a singular fact, he does not, like the brown, 
infest the stacks in the corn-yard. The farmers here are, indeed, 
incredulous respecting the depredations of rats in stacks. Tho

shrew {Sorex araneus is common ; {S.fodiens more rare. The 
mole is abundantly common. The common or short-eared bat 
{VespertiUo murinus is seen, but not very numerous. Before 
concluding the Mammalia, it may be worth mentioning, that, about 
ten years ago, Sir Charles Forbes sent two varieties of the Zebu 
{Bos Indicus to Edinglassie. The first were extremely diminu- 
tive, appeared to suffer much from the severity of the climate, and 
did 'not breed. The other was a larger variety, and bred readily 
with the common bull of the country. Two half-bred bulls were 
kept that grew to great size and weight. They became so furious 
that it was found necessary to destroy them. Both these and the 
next generation retained the distinctive hump, or excrescence, on 
the shoulders. A good many of their progeny were to be met with 
five or six years ago, but they were invariably rejected by the 
cattle-dealer, and hence unprofitable to the farmer. 

Two kangaroos were also sent. They seemed to experience no 
inconvenience from the rigour of the climate, and fed readily on 
grass and vegetables in summer, and on hay with occasional green 
food in winter. Unfortunately they were both of the same sex. 
It would have been interesting to have ascertained whether they 
had been so far naturalized as to have bred in the head of Aber- 
deenshire. • , 4 
Birds.— There is, in the slocks of Glencarvy, an old eyrie, but 
no eagle has occupied it for many years. It would appear, how- 
ever, eagles had formerly been much more numerous, as pits are 
still 'pointed out in the hills that were made for the purpose of 
destroying them. Two different species are said still to be seen 
on the north-west extremity of the parish. Hawks of different 
species are numerous. The buzzard fF. ButeoJ is very common. 
The kite  Milvus vulgaris is more rare. The hen-harrier 
{Circus cyaneus, here called blue-sleeves, breeds in the parish. 
The sparrow-hawk {F. nisus is very common. The kestril's nest 
F Tinnunculus was found last season ; and the merlin  F.salon 
is occasionally seen. The barn-owl {Alucojlammeus, the horn- 
owl {Otvs vulgaris, and the tawny-owl {Strix stridula, are all met 
with, but are rare. The raven C. corax breeds annually in the 
slocks of Glencarvy. The carrion-crow f C. comix ; the hood- 
ed-crow fC. coronej ; the magpie {C.pica, and the jack-daw C.

monedula are very abundant. It is not many years since the 
rook {C.frugilegus became established in rookeries with us : many 
attempts whether wisely or not have been made again to banish 
them, but without success. The jay C. glandarius is not known 
here. The goat-sucker {Caprimulgus EuropcBus is an occasional 
visitant for a short time in the midst of summer. The wood- 
pigeon is common. The common thrush ; the missel-thrush T. 
viscivorus ; the blackbird; the ring-ouzel 7". torquatus, and 
the water-ouzel Cinchs aquaticus, all regularly breed here. The 
fieldfare  T. pilaris, and the red-wing T. iliacus appear in 
great numbers in the beginning of winter, but speedily migrate 
further south. The snow-flake or bunting [Emberiza nivalis con- 
tinues all winter congregated in immense flocks, and when they 
descend low down are regarded as the harbingers of severe wea- 
ther. The most common permanent small birds are the house- 
sparrow Pyrgita domestica. ; the yellow-hammer Emberiza 
citrinella, and the chaffinch Fringilla Coelebs, two white speci- 
mens of which were seen for a considerable time in Candacraig 
woods; also the red-breast Sylvia rubecula ; the blue titmouse 
Parus ccBruleus: the bullfinch Pyrrhula vul, and the creeper 
{Certhia Jam.. The goldfinch {F. carduelis is not found here. 
The principal summer birds are the pied wagtail {Motacilla alba, 
here called the seed-bird, which comes regularly, as its local name 
bears, at seed-time. The yellow wagtail  M. flava  is an occa- 
sional but rare visitor. The Motacilla boarula rare. The common 
wren Troglodytes vul., ancl the golden-crested wren [Regu- 
lus cristatus both build in this parish. The wheat-ear, or fallow- 
chat, provincially called the chackhert  Saxicola cenanthe J, is com- 
mon. The whin-chat 5. r-wSem rare. The white-throat Cwr- 
ruca Sylvia, and the whin-sparrow [Accentor modularis are seen 
in summer. The black-cap  Sylvia atricapilla  very rare. The 
skylark [Alaitda arvensi is rather rare. The meadow-pipit 
Anthus pratensis common. The swallow H. rustica ; the 
sand-martin H. riparia J, and the martin [H. urbica, make their 
appearance about the first of May. The swift  Cypselus apiis  
was observed here by the writer for the first time last season. 
The cuckoo pays his annual visit two or three weeks later than to 
the south of the Grampians ; but he continues longer, not ceasing 
his song sometimes till the first week of August. 

Of the game birds may be mentioned the red-grouse [Lagopus

Scot.  The hills in this district are amongst the most celebrated 
for grouse-shooting, but, it is said, the number of birds is mate- 
rially diminished within the last ten or fifteen years. The black- 
cock Tetrao tetrix is, on the other hand, supposed to be on the 
increase. The ptarmigan T. Layojms breeds in Corgarff, on 
a hill called the Brown Cow. The partridge {Perdix cinerea 
was abundant, but has suffered much by the storm of last winter. 
The gray plover f Charadrius pluvialis  is abundant ; and the 
dotterel's C. Morinellus nest is found in the more sequestered 
hills. The lapwing Vanellus cristatus appears early in spring. 
It is here called the teuchat, and the short storm that often occurs 
after field labour has commenced is hence called the teuchafs 
storm. Numbers of the nests of the lapwing are found every sea- 
son. The curlew  Numenius arquata  comes in numbers to breed 
in the marshes in the hills. The common snipe  Scolopax yul- 
linago, and the jack-snipe S. gullinula are abundant. The 
woodcock  S. rusticola  is an annual visitant, and in some sea- 
sons plentiful. Their nests have several times been found in the 
parish. The water-rail  Rallus aquaticus  has been killed, but 
is very rare. The land-rail {R. crex breeds every season. The 
wild duck Anas boschas breeds in numbers in the Bunzeach. 
The teal-duck A. crecca  is shot occasionally. The heron  Ar- 
dea cinerea breeds at Edinglassie, where there has been for many 
years a small heronry. -f- 

The indigenous reptiles are few, the adder Coluber Berus has 
been seen in the hills, but is very rare. The Lacerta agilis is 
.also rarely seen. The Rana temporaria and Bufo vulgaris are 
common. 

Botang.— This parish is not deficient in variety of vegetable 
productions. The following will be found a pretty correct list of the 
less common plants. The locality of a few of the Alpine plants 
mentioned is, however, immediately beyond the western bound- 
ary of the parish, but the close connection with the botany of 
the head of Aberdeenshire will be an apology for noticing them 
here.

Woods and Plantations. — There is no feature in which the pro- 
gress of improvement in Strathdon is more distinctly indicated, 
within the last half century, than in woods and plantations. The 
whole extent of ground covered with wood did not, before then, 
exceed 200 or 300 acres, whereas there are now nearly 3000 acres 
of thriving plantations. Scotch fir and larch are the predominant 
description of trees, and to these both soil and climate appear to 
be most congenial. Ash, plane, and gean grow also freely ; and 
in the more sheltered situations, the other kinds of hard -wood 
thrive. In the more recent plantations, a much greater propor- 
tion of hard-wood plants have been introduced. One proprietor, 
several years ago, obtained the Highland Society's premium for 
having put in the greatest number in one season. There are no 
trees of remarkable dimensions in the parish, but at the residences 
of the different proprietors there are large-sized trees of plane, 
ash, and elm. 

In the management of woods and plantations, the radical error 
has been, planting too thick, and the prevailing one is the neglect 
of sufficient thinning. Many extensive plantations are almost im- 
penetrable thickets. The superior health and strength of the ex- 
terior trees of these very plantations obviously prove how injuri- 
ously this system operates. The woods of Auchernach are under 
very superior management, and although in a less favourable lo- 
cality with respect to climate, the progress they make shews the 
beneficial result of the proprietor's care and attention.

thing of importance, unless the share its people had in the Rebel- 
lions of 1715 and 1745 deserves a passing notice. AUhougli ■ 
Strathdon lies in the country of the Forbeses, — a family which the 
Scottish Jacobites styled one of the most rebellious in Scotland- 
like most of the Highlands, it was deeply involved in the troubles 
of the times. 

There is no traditionary legend to countenance the supposition 
that the people were devotedly attached to the Pretender's cause. 
On the contrary, the remarkable letter  from the Earl of Mar, 
who was superior of the whole parish, to " Jock of Inverernan," 
would rather prove that it was the tyranny of feudal despotism 
which forced them to join the insurgent's ranks. Mar angrily 
complains ; " It's a pretty thing when all the Highlands of Scot- M 
land are rising upon their King and country's account, that my | 
men should only be refractory ;" plainly intimates to his vassal 
that " he was in the right not to come with the hundred men he 
sent, when he Mar expected four times the number," and sends 
a message to his tenants, " that if they come not forth with their 
best arms, he will send a party immediately to burn what they 
will miss taking from them," adding, " they may believe this is not 
only a threat, but, by all that's sacred, I will put it in execution." 

The aversion of the people to engage in the cause is further 
corroborated by the proceedings of the presbytery of Alford against 
the Episcopal ministers. The hbel against Mr John Alexander, 
Episcopal minister of Kildrummy, commences — " his praying pub- 
licly in Braemar for success to the Pretender his arms when the 
standard was displayed there," &amp;c. He protested against seven 
of the witnesses, " in respect they are habit and repute as of the 
number of those rebellious accomplices that were with the late 
Earl of Mar in arms at Braemar; and, therefore, till they be 
purged of the said scandall, cannot be sustained as habiles testes." 
« Upon which Maister Thaine, in the name of the presbytery, re- 
protested, that the former objection and protestation was ground- 
less, and no regard should be had thereto ; because, though these 
persons might have been at Braemar with the late Earl of Mar, 
yet it does not follow that they were of the number of his rebel- 
lious accomplices, because it is nottour in the country side that 
many of the poor countrey people were only brought thither upon 
pretence of hunting, and when they were there were pressed to

go along with the Rebells, contrary to their incHnation, and how 
soon soever they had an opportunity of deserting, they came home, 
thereby testifying their want of incHnation to rebel : and the Go- 
vernment 'is so conscious of this, that they have never called any 
of these people to account for their being in the Rebellion." 
The people of Strathdon, however, seem to have been pretty ge- 
nerally implicated ; for Mr Robertson,  the Episcopal minister, 
says in his confession on the presbytery's libel, " that he did read 
the proclamation for the thanksgiving from the pulpit, but did 
not observe the thanksgiving, because his people were out on par- 
ties, and, therefore, had none to keep it with him." 

In 1745, Gordon of Glenbucket joined the Pretender with 400 
men raised in Strathdon, Glenlivat, &amp;c. The families of Skella- 
ter, Inverernan, and Edinglassie, joined the cause of the Pretend- 
er; but, fortunately, no confiscations, nor even prosecutions by the 
Government took place after the insurrection was suppressed. 

Eminent Men, — There is no person of particular eminence, 
either in literature or science, with whom this parish can claim con- 
nection by birth or residence. There are not wanting, however, 
characters of distinguished moral excellence, some of which merit 
especial notice in the statistics of this parish. 
• General John Forbes of Skellater, when a young man, distin- 
guished himself by resenting the attacks on his country of the ce- 
lebrated John Wilkes, contained in the " North Briton,"" and 
sought, in vain for a personal rencontre with him. General For- 
bes married a princess of the blood-royal of jPortugal, and rose to 
be a fieldmarshal in the Portuguese service. He was a distin- 

 Mr Robertson appears to have had a strong hold of the affections of his people ; 
and his being forcibly separated from them by deposition, will account for one of 
those ebullitions of violence ngainst his successor at his first introduction, mentioned 
in the former account. The whole of his confession before the presbytery is made 
with so much naivete, that we extract it from the record of the presbytery. " Mas- 
ter John Robertson was called and compeared, and being interrogate upon the se- 
veral articles of his libell, replyed and confessed as follows, viz. That during the 
time of the late Rebellion he prayed for the Pretender ; but with these limitations, 
that God would incline his heart to be a true Protestant ; and if it were God's will 
he would bring him to the throne who was lawfuU heir to our native kings ; and if 
not, that God would be pleased to incline him to set his heart upon ane heavenly 
kingdome. That he prayed God would preserve the Earl of Marr and his own pa- 
rochiiiers from sin and wrath, and every mark of God's displeasure, and bring them 
safe home again. That he observed the fast-day lybelled, and prayed for the Tre- 
tender, the Earl of Marr, and bis own parochiners, and that God would reconcile 
disagreeing parties. That he did read the proclamation for the thanksgiving from 
pulpit, but not observe the thanksgiving, because his people were out on parties, and 
the-cfor he had non to keep it with him. That he did not pray for King George

guished soldier, and acted with great success against the Spaniards. 
He accompanied the Royal family to the Brazils, where he died 
in 1809. 

John Forbes, Esq. — Mr Forbes was born at Bollabeg in September 
1743. In early life he went to Bombay, and engaged in mercantile 
pursuits. His talents for business and indomitable probity and virtue 
speedily laid the foundation of that distinction which his name af- 
terwards attained in all the three presidencies. His enlightened 
views led him to embark in a field of commercial enterprize of vast 
magnitude, from which he realized a large fortune. The mercan- 
tile house he established at Bombay became of distinguished emi- 
nence, and still bears his name. Mr Forbes was a quick discerner 
of character, and to the deserving proved a stedfast friend and ge- 
nerous benefactor. From his innate goodness of heart, he took 
a warm interest in the young men recommended to his attention, 
and delighted to exercise the extensive influence he possessed in 
forwarding their views. The paternal counsel he gave at the out- 
set of life, and the benevolent assistance he afforded by pecuniary 
advances, are still gratefully remembered by many now retired 
upon their fortunes. Mr Forbes repurchased Newe, the estate of 
his ancestors, besides other extensive property in Strathdon, and 
from that era in reality commenced the improvement of the coun- 
try. The whole rental of his estates was laid out in carrying for- 
ward this great object,— but the nature of these improvements will 
more properly fall to be noticed afterwards. 

But the character of Mr Forbes was pre-eminently distinguished 
for a spirit of philanthropy and Christian charity, founded on ge- 
nuine and simple piety. His private beneficence, both in India 
and at home, was almost unbounded, and his munificent donations 
to public charities, amongst others that of L.l 0,000 to the Aber- 
deen Asylum, and L.IOOO to the Infirmary, are well known. A 
handsome monument in Aberdeen to his memory testifies the gra- 
titude of its inhabitants. 

Sir Charles Forbes, Bart.—Mv Forbes died in 1821, and his 
estates descended to his nephew. Sir Charles Forbes, Bart. He 
also in early life went to India, returned to England m 1812, and 
in 1823 was created a Baronet of the united kingdom. He sat 
in Parliament for upwards of twenty years, steadily advocatmg the 
cause of the native Indian, and, although now retu-ed from Par- 
liamentary duty, the energies of his mind are still untn-.ngly de- 
voted to the amelioration of British India. Twenty-eight years

ago, on leaving India, the natives, as a testimony of respect and 
affection, presented him with a service of plate of the value of 
L. 1300; and in gratitude for the important part he has taken in 
exalting their position in society, obtaining their admission to the 
offices of justices of the peace, and grand jurors, the natives of 
Bombay have subscribed for a statue of him, for which he is now 
sitting to Sir Francis Chantrey. Sir Charles claims to represent 
the Lords Forbes of Pitsligo as heir-male. 

Rev. Dr Forbes. — Another member of this family, intimately 
connected with the parish for the greater part of his life, well me- 
rits notice. Dr Forbes, the immediate predecessor of the writer, 
was for twenty-five years minister of Strathdon. Although very 
early in life called to the discharge of the ministerial office, he zea- 
lously performed its duties, and, under the Divine blessing, his la- 
bours were attended with eminent success. No man could be more 
devoted to the best interests of his people, and none ever more 
fully enjoyed their confidence and affection. 

Dr Forbes died suddenly of an affection of the heart in 1834. 
No event ever caused a stronger sensation in Strathdon, — deep 
grief reigned in every cottage, and his memory is still affection- 
ately cherished by the people, as their best and kindest friend. 

Land-owners. — The landed proprietors are, Sir Charles For- 
bes, Bart, of Newe and Edinglassie; Major-General Sir Alexan- 
der Leith, K. C. B. of Freefield and Glenkindy ; Robert Ander- 
son, Esq. of Candacraig ; the Earl of Fife ; Mrs Forbes of Inver- 
ernan ; General Forbes of Dunotar and Auchernach ; and Robert 
Farquharson, Esq. of Allargue. 

Parochial Registers.— The parochial register of births and mar- 
riages from 1674 to 1710 is carefully filled up, but the volume is 
in very bad condition.  There are no regular books from that 
date till 1741, when a register of baptisms commences, but down 
to lb30, it has been very irregularly kept. A regular register of 
baptisms and marriages has been kept from the year 1830. No

Stratlulon there is a reguUir chain of ruinous castles, and it is a 
singular coincidence, that the first four are all placed at equal in- 
tervening distances,— Towie Castle, being about three miles up the 
Don from Kildrummy ; Glenbucket, three above Towie ; and 
Culquhanny, three miles higher up than Glenbucket ; a mile be- , 
yond Culquhanny stands the Doune of Invernochty ; and, lastly, 
at the head of the strath, the Castle of Corgarff. The latter three 
only are in this parish. Tradition says Culquhanny Castle was 
built by Forbes of Towie a cadet of the Putachie famdy, who 
married the heiress of Towie, early in the sixteenth century, but it 
was never finished. " The most ancient building still entire," says 
the former Account, " is the Castle of Corgarff. It is supposed 
to have been built by some of the Earls of Marr for a hunting- 
seat. During the feuds between the Gordons and the Forbeses, . 
it was burned down in 1571 by Adam Gordon of Auchendown or 
some of his officers, and in it Margaret Campbell, daughter of 
Campbell of Calder, then big with child, together with her chil- 
dren and servants, 27 in number, were cruelly burned to death. 
Having been afterwards rebuilt, it was purchased by Government 
in 1746 from Mr Forbes of Skellater, and for several, years there- 
after 15 or 20 men were stationed in it." From 1827 to 1831, 
it was garrisoned by a captain, subaltern, and 56 men, to support 
the civil authorities in the suppression of smuggling. 

Doune.— k short way above the confluence of the Nochty and 
the Don, there is a very remarkable abruptly conical mound, about 
60 feet in height from the bottom of the ditch; 970 feet m cir- 
cumference at the base ; and 562 feet at the top. It is of an oval 
form, and the flat surface on the top measures about half an acre. 
It has been regularly fortified by a moat 16 feet deep and 26 feet 
wide at the bottom, which has been supplied with water by the 
stream Bardock. It has evidently been one of those gravel y emi- 
nences already mentioned, and probably the cutting of the wet 
ditch and the more regular formation of the sides is all that is ar- 
tificial about it. Its situation and figure pointed it out as a place 
on which to erect a stronghold. All around the top the founda- 
tions of buildings are visible. A small portion of wall on each side 
of the gateway to the south is still seen, but it is too dilapida ed 
to judge of what the thickness had been. At the level of the 
ground it measures six feet. There is no account of tins remnant 
of antiquity. Some vague tradition states that the church origi- 
nally stood here, which merely rests on the former name of the 



STRATHDON. 545 

parish being Invernoclitie. It lias been a place of considerable 
strength in a remote age. Chalmers mentions traces of a Roman 
iter from Dee-side, which would point precisely in this direction. 
The traces of science in fortification would support the conjecture, 
that it might be a Roman fort to preserve the line of communica- 
tion across the country ; or it may pertain to a later era, and have 
been one of those forts erected by the Picts or Britons as a pro- 
tection against the incursions of the Danes, and other northern 
hordes from the north-west. The former Account mentions " the 
ruins of buildings in the neighbourhood." These have been long 
since obliterated by the plough. 

Eirde Houses. — Five of these interesting vestiges of antiquity, 
called Eirde Houses, from being subterranean, have been discover- 
ed in the parish. We have been so often applied to for some ac- 
count of them, that a brief description of one is deemed necessary. 
It Is a singular fact that, both in this parish and in Kildrummy, 
where they are still more numerous, they are all of the same shape. 
The outer passage, which lies to the south, is circular, and about 
8 feet in length. The exterior chamber is 24 feet long, 6 feet 8 
inches high, greatest breadth across the floor 8 feet 8 inches, 
while at the roof it is only 6 feet 6 inches. The floor is laid with 
stones. The foundation, or lowest course, consists of 22 stones, 
averaging 3 feet in height, so set up as to give the largest surface 
to the inside of the wall, and they all decline outwards from the 
perpendicular. Above these are several courses ofsmaller stones, 
so placed that each covers the joint of thfe under stones, and in- 
clines a little more inward. The whole wall, on each side, thus 
forms the segment of a large vertical circle. On the side walls are 
laid nine flat stones, 8 feet 6 inches in length, and 3 feet 8 inches 
in breadth, which form the roof. The interstices are jammed full 
of small stones, but there is no appearance of any kind of cement 
having been used, neither is there any indication on the stones of 
the hammer having been employed. On the north side of this 
chamber is an aperture 15 inches high, 7 inches wide at the bot- 
tom, and 10 inches at the top, which communicates with a small 
apartment, 5 feet long, and 1 foot broad ; the back, cover, and 
ends being each a single stone. On the same side, very near the 
inner end of the outer apartment, is another opening, 2 feet high,- 
and 1 foot 8 inches wide, and 3 feet above the floor which leads 
to the mner chamber. Here" is the only angle that occurs,— all 
the other parts being segments of circles. The lenffih of this

chamber is 16 feet 6 inches, breadth, 6 feet 6 inches, and height, 
6 feet, and precisely of the same construction as the outer. The 
whole length of the house, including both chambers, is thus 48 

feet 6 inches. . c v\ 

Einqs and Coins.-ln 1822, in diggmg the foundation of a dike , 
on the north side of the hill, opposite to Garchory were found 
two rings and several hundred silver coins. One of the rings is 
gold, wtth a small dark sapphire. A ring precise y similar was 
discovered 16th July 1829, with other relics, the coffin of a 
bishop of Chichester, in the cathedral of that city. The date of 
the tomb is A. D. 1146. . , , u- 

The other was a broken iron gilt ring, with a pale sapphire, . 
and is very similar to many Arabian and Indian rings 

The coins are nearly all of Henry III. of England. Some o«| 
them are of William the Lion of Scotland, and two of them o 
King John. A portion of them was divided into halves, and 
others into quarters. Those of Henry III. have on the obverse 
the King's head, full-faced and crowned, holding the sceptre with 
a cross patee : reverse, a cross with a small cross in each quarter. 

They all have the names of the towns where they were coined, 
and of the mint-masters. Such as simvn on + cANT-Canter-

by the contractor on the property, and in the immediate neigh- 
bourhood of the house. The accommodations are worthy of Mr 
Smith's well known skill in combining comfort and elegance. The 
furniture and interior finishings by the present proprietor are much 
admired. 

The mansion of Inverernan received extensive additions and al- 
terations some years ago. The style is that of a modern villa, par- 
taking of the Italian. The accommodations are ample. The house 
of Auchernach was built in 1809, and for many years was the best 
in the country. Glenkindy, Edinglassie, Bellabeg, and Skellater 
are of an older date. 

In 1834, a new church, manse, and offices were built at the ex- 
pense of Sir Charles Forbes, Bart, for the mission of CorgarflF. 
The plans were given by Mr Daniel. The church is a very neat 
structure. The manse consists of six rooms, kitchen, and other 
conveniences, and the offices are equal if not superior to those of 
most parish ministers. Sir Charles likewise built, in 1832, an ex- 
cellent school and dwelling-house for the teacher at Corgarff. A 
new parochial school, on the most approved modern plan, calcu- 
lated for 120 scholars, but which would conveniently contain a 
third more, with a suitable dwelling-house for the schoolmaster, 
was built in the summer of 1838 by the heritors. 

III. — Population. 
We have no account of the population of the parish previous to 
1755, but, judging from the registers of births and marriages at 
the close of the seventeenth century, which at that period appear 
to have been very exactly kept, it had been much more populous 
than in recent times, the entries in any year then being greatly 
more numerous than now. 

• The following is a statement of the population at different dates 
subsequent to 1755 : —

The great defalcation of the population in the present year is 
obviously attributable to emigration and the enlargement of farms, 
also to a failure of the harvest, which induced many young men

Habits of the People, Popular Customs, Sc.—ln the habits of 
the people there is an obvious and increasing attention to comfort 
and cleanliness. The ordinary dress of the men is of stout home- 
made manufacture ; the women wear gowns or wrappers of home- 
spun wincy. Strangers commonly remark the well-dressed ap- 
pearance of the congregation on the Sabbath. 

The ordinary food of the peasantry is oatmeal, vegetables, and 
the produce of the dairy. Fortunately for morality and good 
order, the " bothy" system for servants is scarcely known in the 
parish. In some cases the men have their meal and milk, which 
is prepared in the kitchen. 

The people in general are frugal, and, upon the whole, tem- 
perate and iudustrious. Unhappily, a few individuals are ha- 
bitually addicted to the use of ardent spirits; but these are the 
exceptions ; the majority are decidedly sober people It they 
have sometimes been charged with indolence,.it will be found that 
it arises chiefly from the circumstances in which they are placed. 
They are capable, when called into activity, of great and laborious 
exertion, as well as of patient endurance under privations. f| 

Their intellectual powers are not, perhaps, in general, much 
elevated by reading and education, although, with hardly an ex- 
ception, they can all read; but they are endued with great natural 
acuteness and sagacity in the management of their own affairs. 
If in some instances they are too much disposed to retain a sense 
of injury, they at the same time are extremely sensible ot, and

grateful for kindness and attention. Tlie influences of pure and 
undefiled religion are, it is hoped, being more and more diffused 
over their minds, one evidence of which is their habitual and re- 
gular attendance on Gospel ordinances. 

The favourite pastimes are, prize-shootings about Christmas, 
and subscription dances. These are generally made subservient 
to charitable purposes. They are set on foot for the relief of 
some case of poverty or incidental distress in the neighbourhood ; 
and thus, at the individual cost of a few pence, a considerable sum 
is realized for a needy neighbour. Another charitable practice 
prevails. When an extraordinary case of helpless distress occurs, 
the young men in the locality assemble together, and, often ac- 
companied with music, go from house to house, where they re- 
ceive a donation in kind or money. In this way a considerable 
'supply is speedily raised in behalf of the object of their charitable 
exertions.. 

There is, indeed, no feature of character that more peculiarly 
marks the people than their warm sympathy, humane attention, 
and active benevolence to their suffering neighbours : however 
straitened their own circumstances may be, the common beggar 
is never allowed to pass from the door unrelieved. 

Poaching in game prevailed to a considerable extent some years 
ago. During the shooting-season, bands of desperate characters 
still infest the hills ; but they are not connected with the parish. 
The analogous offence of moor- burning, however, is still too pre- 
valent. Neither can they be acquitted altogether of blazing the 
river. A good many foul fish are thus annually killed. This is 
not done secretly as a crime, but openly as a diversion. 

Previous to the alteration in the distillery laws, this parish was 
one of the strongholds of smuggling. The inhabitants of Cor- 
garff, the glens, and not a few in the lower part of the parish, 
were professed smugglers. The revenue-officers- were set at de- 
fiance. To be engaged in illicit distillation, and to defraud the 
excise, was neither looked on as a crime, nor considered as a dis- 
grace. As may be supposed, such a system of things proved most 
pernicious, productive of the grossest demoralization, irreligion, 
and sm, and destructive of every habit of regular industry. But a 
happy change took place. By the vigorous measures adopted by 
Government, effectively seconded by the proprietors, this mo- 
ral pest was struck at the very root, and speedily became utterly 
extmct. The lawless life of the smuggling bothie" was wholly 



550

abandoned, and the honest labours of agriculture substituted. It 
is a subject of just congratulation, to contemplate the industrious 
spirit, the healthy tone of moral feeling, and the fixed religious 
principle that are gradually, under the blessing of God, acquiring 
more and more strength over their minds. 

IV. — Industry. 
Jffriculiure.— The number of acres cultivated and waste can- 
not be stated with precision, as several of the properties have not 
been surveyed. The most accurate approximation the writer has 
been able to arrive at is as follows, viz. 

Arable land in round numbers, • 4,500 Scotch acres. 
Wood ■ • 3,000 do. 

Waste' and pasture probably upwards of 60,000 do. 

Rent of Land.— The gross rental of the parish, includmg the 
portion of Tarland formerly mentioned, is, as nearly as can be 
ascertained, about L.5000. The valued rent, exclusive of Tarland, 
is L 3039, Is. 6d. Scots. The average rent of arable land may be 
stated at L. 1, 5s. per Scotch acre ; the right of common pasture 
in the hills included. The grazing of a full-sized ox may cost L.2. 
A sheep pastured on the hill for a year, 2s. 6d. ; grazed m an 

inclosed field, 5s. 6d. i i r 

Wanes, c.—A farm-servant's wages with victuals, or two pecks ot 
meal per week and a Scotch pint of milk per day, are from L.IO to 
L. 14 per annum; a woman servant's vary from L. 4 to L. 5, 10s. 
according to the kind of work required. The scythe is now al- 
most entirely employed in cutting down the crop. The farmers 
encracre hands for the harvest about Lammas. A cutter gets about 
L.\ 10s.; a bandster from L.2 to L. 2, 5s.; women from L. 1, 
IDs to L 1, 15s. Formerly, thravers were engaged for harvest 
at 3d per thrave without victuals, but the scythe has now super- 
seded every other method. It is more expeditious, the crop sea- 
sons sooner, and more straw is obtained. One scythe cuts down 
an acre and a-qmrter per day, with a woman to gather the swathe 
into sheaves, and a bandster to bind and stook. A day labourers 
wacre is from Is. 6d. to Is. 9d. in summer, and Is. to Is. 4d. in 
winter The prices of articles of country manufacture for rural 
purposes are, a full-mounted iron plough, L 3, 10s. ; do. o wood, 
L 2 15s to L. 3; harrows of hard-wood, L. 1, 3s. ; do. of larch, 
which is found to answer well, 16s.; a double close cart, L. 10 to

Live-StocL—The common breed of cattle is he Aberdeenshire. 
The polled are, perhaps, at present more in fashion than the 
horned. In the upper district and glens, a smaller horned race 
prevails, in which there is an intermixture of the Ross-shire and 
West Highland breed. Much attention is paid to the breeding and 
rearing of black- cattle in this parish. The dairy is altogether a 
secondary consideration to the rearing of good calves ; hence a 
cow good at the pail is of less importance than a good breeder, 
and strong prejudice exists against the admixture of any south 
country bfood. The late Dr Forbes of Blelack and Inverernan, 
with great care and expense, succeeded in raising a justly cele- 
brated stock, which became widely diffused over the parish. 
The enterprize and skill of the Messrs Grassick are successfully 
employed in the improvement of this as well as other descriptions 
of farm stock. They do not spare expense to procure the best 
bulls, and keep valuable cows. The farmers, in general, are su- 
perior judges of cattle, and, as the better classes especially keep 
well, they find a ready market for their beasts. Since the Lon- 
don market for fat cattle has been opened up by steam ships from 
Aberdeen, a considerable number of beasts are stall-fed in the 
parish. One of the gentlemen above-mentioned sold four this 
winter for L. 105. One of the four was a four year old ox reared 
on the farm. The purchaser, after gaining two prizes for them 
at a fat cattle show, sold them to advantage in the London mar 
ket. 

The sheep are of the black-faced breed. Some of the farmers 
purchase wedder lambs at Lanark lamb fair, which they keep till 
three years old. Yearling rams are generally bought there, and 
brought north to improve the stock. Few horses are reared in 
the parish, except to supply the place of such as are worn out. 
The number in the parish in 1835 was 314. 

Husbandry, — Within the last twenty years, very great and ra- 
pid progress has been made in agricultural improvement. By 
trenching, drainage, &amp;c. many of the tenants have made consider- 



552 



ABERDEENSHIRE. 



able additions to the arable land of their farms. The facility in 
the command of lime is of material benefit in this respect. Ge- 
nerally each farm has its own lime-kiln, to which limestone is 
driven dnring summer to be burned the ensuing spring, and laid 
hot upon the land. Occasionally the old system is practised of 
spreading it over the turnip field, and hoeing it in with the second 
hoeing of the turnips, but this is rapidly falling into disuse. It 
has already been stated, that, upon the principal farms, the most 
approved husbandry system has been introduced. It is still, how- 
ever, a prevalent error to keep too many beasts ; and, in some 
cases, the old prejudice exists of considering it waste to give straw 
for litter. The economy of expense of labour, compared with 
what it was forty years ago, is illustrated by the fact, that, within 
that period the farm of Buchaam was worked by 6 ploughs, 18 
horses, and 4 yokes of cattle of 10 or 12 each. The present 
enterprizing tenant works the same farm with a great additional 
extent of arable land which he has reclaimed in a manner not 
to be surpassed, with 3 ploughs, 4 horses, and a pair, or occa- 
sionally two pairs of work oxen. 

The TOtation followed, and which the terms of lease commonly 
stipulate, is the seven-shift, viz. 1. oats ; 2. oats ; 3. green crop ; 
4. bear or bigg ; 5. hay ; 6. and 7. pasture. No wheat is ever 
grown, and very rarely English barley; bear or chester being 
found much more suitable for the climate. The favourite oats, 
and, unquestionably, the best fitted for the climate, are, the early 
Angus and Scotch birley. The soil is well adapted for turnip, 
of which excellent crops are raised, A few globes are sown for 
early consumption, but the principal crop consists of green and 
red-top yellow. Swedes grow well, but they have given place to 
the red-top yellow turnip, which is found to keep as long good m 
spring, and yield a more abundant crop. Few potatoes are raised ; 
the soil suits them well, but they run great hazard of being ruined 
by early frosts. 

Z.eases. The general duration of leases is nineteen years. 

The farm-buildings are generally of a superior description. Ihe 
dwelling-houses are comfortable and commodious, and the offices 
neat squares of substantial stone and lime, with slated roofs. 
There are nine thrashing-mills in the parish driven by water, and 
one by horse power. There are four meal-mills, which on an ave- 
rage grind from 1600 to 2000 bolls per annum. 

Distance from market, and uncertainty of climate, are the greai 



STRATHDON. 



obstacles to agiicultuml improvement. In not a few instances 
these evils are aggravated by deficiency of agricultural capital. 
It unfortunately happens, such is the desire to possess a farm, 
arising perhaps from local attachment, that whenever a place be- 
comes vacant, an unwise competition takes place, which leads to 
the offer of higher rents than prudence can at all times justify. 

Quarries.— There are eight or ten quarries of limestone, which 
are regularly worked for the supply of the parish, and to meet a 
considerable demand from Kildrummy and Towie. The quality 
of the lime is excellent, being part of the same great bed of lime- 
stone wrought near Keith and at Ardonald. It is a singular fact, 
thai all the limestone rocks lie on the north side of the Don, with 
the exception of one near Boilhandy. The lime is burned with 
peats, with the addition of a small quantity of coals when they 
can be obtained. A slate quarry was formerly wrought, but the 
quality being coarse, it has been long abandoned. 

Produce. — The statement of raw produce is given as taken in 
the year ] 835-36, no year since having been nearly an average 
crop. The gross amount, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as 
follows : — 

Bear, 1302 quarters, at L.l, 3s. per quarter, . L.1627 10 0 

Oats, 3574 at L.l, do. . 3574 0 0

Manufactures. — There is not anything deserving the name of a 
manufactory in the parish. At the wool-mill of Glenkindy, the 
average quantity of blankets and plaiden manufactured per annuiti 
is about 2220 yards ; listing 4000 yards ; woollen yarn spun 5800 
cuts. The number of persons employed is 6. 

• V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Toivn. — The nearest market-town is Aberdeen, forty- 
five miles distant ; but at Rhynie, eighteen miles distant, there is 
weekly an excellent market for butcher-meat. It is to Aberdeen 
that all the grain and other produce is driven, and from thence 
that all the merchandize, groceries, and coals are brought. There 
is no village in the parish, unless nine cottages at Heugh-head 
may be called one.

Means of Commmncation. — The means of communication are 
good. Strathdon has a daily post. The turnpike road runs 
through it for eighteen miles, and terminates in Corgarff. There 
are also excellent cross roads, most of them made by the heritors 
within the last few years, on their diflerent estates. There are , 
three stone bridges over the Don, The old bridge of Pooldhulie 
was one of the two on the whole course of the river that withstood 
the flood of 18-29 uninjured. Luib-bridge was built by Sir Charles 
Forbes in 1832. There is an iron bridge, with a span of forty feet, || 
for the turnpike road, over the Nochty, and seven other stone 
bridges over different streams in the parish. A public coach runs 
to and from Aberdeen on alternate days during the summer. In 
the winter months it does not come farther up than Mossat, twelve 
miles distant. 'fPj 

Ecclesiastical State.— The. church is, upon the whole, perhaps as 
conveniently situated as well could be for the lower district of the 
parish. In a widely scattered population, such as this, there must 
necessarily be many families at too remote a distance for regular 
attendance on public worship at the parish church. The distance 
of the church from the eastern extremity of the parish is seven 
miles, and upwards of fifteen from the western ; but the greatest 
distance of any dwelling-house from the church is about twelve 
miles. The church was rebuilt in 1757, and thirty years ago was 
ceiled and reseated. The main fault of it is its inadequacy for 
the accommodation of the congregation. It is seated for 504, but 
the average number of communicants of the united congregations, 
for five years previous to 1838, and tliey all communicate at the 
parish church, is 860. The tenants of each heritor possess a 
right of sitting in the division of the church assigned them. All 
the sittings are free. . 

A missionary minister, on the Royal Bounty, has been stationed 
at Corgarff for upwards of 1 00 years. A new church, manse, and 
offices, which have already been alluded to, were built in 1835, 
and cost nearly L.IOOO. The missionary receives L. 60 per an - 
num, a croft, and right of pasturage, for so many sheep m the 
hill. Every attempt that has been made to obtain the usual grant 
for dispensing the sacrament of the Lord's supper at Corgarff, 
where the accommodations are now of the most superior descrip- 
tion, has hitherto unhappily not been attended with success.

Manse, Very large additions were made, or rather, it 
would be more correct to say, anew manse was built in 1831, 
while the chief part of the old one built in 1791 was retained. 
Having been completely gutted, it joined well with the new build- 
ing, and it now possesses every convenience for a family. An 
excellent steading of offices was built at the same time. The 
glebe is about if of an acre in extent. The value may be 
estimated at L. 2, 12s. 6d. per annum. The stipend is L.190, 
6s. 9id. money, including L. 20 Scots for grass, and communion 
element money : meal, 2 bolls, 3 pecks, | lippie : bear, 1 boll, 1 
firlot, 1 peck, f lippie, and 634 back-loads of peats, which, by an 
agreement between the heritors and minister in 1838, were com- 
muted for half-a-merk per load. 

There is a small Roman Catholic chapel in the upper district 
of the parish, in which service is performed once in three weeks. 
Ten years ago there were 69 Roman Catholics in the parish. The 
whole number is now 23, consisting of 6 families and 9 individuals. 
There is one Dissenting family in the parish, which came from 
Aberdeen some years ago. The number of Dissenters is 2. 

Divine service, both at the parish church and the missionary 
chapel, is attended in the most examplary manner. The number 
of families attending the Established Church is 283, or all in pa- 
rish excepting the 7 above-mentioned. The average number of 
communicants has already been stated to be 860, including, of 
course, those who communicate from neighbouring parishes. 

The average annual amount of church collections for religious 
and charitable objects, as ascertained in answer to the queries of 
the Church Commissioners, was found to be, for three years pre- 
vious to 1835, L.14, 12s. lid. 

.~ Education. — There are seven schools in the parish, exclusive of 
a sewing-school taught by a dress-maker ; one parochial ; three 
supported by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Know- 
ledge ; and three adventure schools taught only in winter. The 
branches taught at the parochial school are, reading, writing, 
arithmetic, mathematics, English grammar, geography, and Latin 
when required. The school is daily opened with prayer. A por- 
tion of scripture is read by each pupil, sufficiently advanced, every 
day; and prayers, psalms, and portions of scripture repeated weekly. 
The general expense of education is, English reading, 6d. per 
month; reading and writing, 8d. per month; do. do. with arith- 
metic or Latin, lOd. per month. The salary of tiie parochial 



553 ABBimiSISNSUIRE. 

teacher is L. 28 per annum, with an allowance of L.2 in lieu of a 
garden. The amount of school-fees is about L. 8. The nominal 
amount is fully a third more,— but they are very irregularly paid. 
The number of pupils may be stated to be from 65 to 90 in win- 
ter, and from 35 to 50 in summer. The excellent accommoda- 
tions that have been recently provided have already been noticed. 
The present incumbent was appointed in 1803, but for nearly 
twenty years has been afflicted by the hand of God, and confined 
in a private asylum. An assistant and successor has been appoint- 
ed. He receives a very small portion L. 3 of the salary ; the 
school-fees, and possesses the dweUing-house. He also receives 
a share of the funds under the management of the Trustees of 
the Dick Bequest. 

The three teachers supported by the Society for Propagating 
Christian Knowledge receive L.15 per annum of salary, and have 
the requisite accommodations of a house, croft, and fuel. Each 
of the schools is most useful in the locality in which it is placed. 
In Corgarff the Roman Catholic children freely attend the Pro- 
testant school, read the Bible, and commit the Assembly's Cate- 
chism, and the Psalms to memory. 

Friendly Society. —The Lonach Highland and Friendly Society 
was instituted fifteen years ago. As its name imports, its object was 
twofold, viz. the preservation of the Highland garb, and the Celtic 
language; and also the estabhshment of a Friendly and Insurance 
Society for affording weekly allowances to sick members, and widows, 
andorphans. At the outset, owingto the imperfect knowledge of the 
equitable principles on which such institutions should be founded, 
this society was not free from some of the prevalent errors of the 
time. The want of proper caution and foresight in the enrolling 
members, early caused an undue pressure on the funds. Fortu- 
nately its capital was strong, and it surmounted its difficulties. 
Aided by the Report of the Highland Society upon Benefit Socie- 
ties, it is now conducted on sound principles, its funds are pros- 
perous, and it proves a most useful association. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The average number of indivi- 
duals permanently on the poor's roll, together with their families 
dependent upon them, for the three years prior to 1838, was 79. 
The average amount of payments to these during the same years, 
L. 74 Is. 4d. The average number of persons that received oc- 
casional relief during that period was 33, and the average amount 
paid to them, L. 17, 17s. 8d. The highest ordinary rate to ni- 



STRATHDON. 



557 



dividual paupers on the permanent roll varies from 6s, to 89. per 
month, but this is only to totally helpless or bed-rid persons. 

The average amount of church collections in the above years, 
exclusive of the special collections formerly mentioned, was L. 55, 
Is. 8d. ; other voluntary contributions, L. 18, 8s. 5d. ; mortcloth 
dues and interest from funds, L. 32, 16s. 8d. The funds avail- 
able for the relief of the poor are the interest of Newe's Legacy 
of L. 500, less legacy duty, which is intrusted to the management 
of the minister and kirk-session for charitable purposes, whether 
to the relief of paupers or others ; likewise L. 100, less legacy 
duty, bequeathed to the poor by the late Miss Forbes of Bellabeg ; 
and other smaller sums, altogether amounting to L. 600, which 
is lent on interest. 

At no distant period, a very strong aversion existed to the re- 
ception of parochial relief. There are still not a few instances to 
be met with of that creditable spirit, but, it is to be feared, that 
honest independence which rejected the aid of the kirk-box is fast 
dying away, and but little feeling of degradation remains at re- 
ceiving eleemosynary aid. 

The writer must not omit to notice here, that some of the he- 
ritors annually, and others from time to time, give liberal dona- 
tions in money, meal, or clothing to the poor on their estates. 

Fairs. — There are five fairs or markets held in the jDarish du- 
ring the summer. The principal one is John's Fair, for cattle, 
sheep, and horses. Three are small cattle markets, and the re- 
maining one, Andermas Fair, at the end of harvest, for the sale 
of meal, fodder, &amp;c. 

Inns and Alehoiises.- — There is one inn in the parish, in which 
very good accommodation can be had. There are also five 
houses licensed to retail spirits. Five or six years ago, besides 
the inn above-mentioned, there were no less than eleven tippling 
houses. The minister has resolutely refused every application 
that has ever been made to him for a certificate to open a spirit- 
shop, and, by the cordial co-operation of the heritors, seven have 
been shut up. It is believed all the existing houses are as de- 
cently and well conducted as places of the kind can be ; but a 
still further reduction of their number would be of advantage to- 
the moral welfare of the community. 

Fuel. — Peat, as may be conceived, is the common fuel of the 
country. Wood, as far as it can be obtained, is also used. 
Amongst the better classes, coal only is burned in rooms. English 



558 



ABERDEENSHIRK, 



coal alone is used, brought from Aberdeen. The price, according 
to the supply there, varies from 3s. 6d. to 4s. 6d., and the carriage 
is from 5s. to 7s. per boll. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Few parishes have undergone a greater change within the last 
forty years than Strathdon, The vast improvement of the coun- 
try, by reclaiming and planting of waste lands; the drainage and 
enclosure of fields, and general introduction of the improved sys- 
tem of husbandry ; the opening up of the strath by a turnpike 
road running through the centre of the parish ; and the formation 
of good cross-roads, with stone bridges over the different streams ; 
the elegant and commodious residences of the proprietors ; and 
the comfortable slated dwelling-houses and substantial farm-offices 
of the tenantry, are some of the more obvious marks of the pro- 
gress of cultivation. 

In the comparative state of the parish since the former Account 
was given, there are some remarkable differences. The real rent 
was then about L. 1600, now it is between L. 4000 and L. 5000. 
The old Account, speaking of improvements, states, " this practice 
carrying out manure in creels is still continued by almost all 
the tenants above the kirk, where two-thirds of the parish as to 
extent are situated. In the lower part of it, however, there are now 
upwards of fifty carts. One of the gentlemen keeps a carriage." 
There are at the present day 309 carts in the parish, and, with 
one exception, every proprietor keeps a carriage. On the other 
hand, the numbers of live-stock are singularly coincident. Then, 
there were 8543 sheep, — now there are 8664 ; then, there were 
2286 cattle, — now there are 2115. The number of horses, how- 
ever, was greatly more numerous, being 552, and now only 314. 
But the former Account says, "the ploughs are drawn some by 8, 
some by 10, and some by 12 cattle; some by cattle and horses 
before them, and a great noany by horses alone. All the tenants 
in Corgarff, and some in the other parts of the parish, yoke four 
horses abreast." Now, the horses are of a superior description, do 
vastly more work than all the formidable array here described, 
and, except for subsoil ploughing, there are never more than two 
in a plough. 

Such are some of the more striking variations betwixt the pre- 
sent state of the parish and that which existed at the time of the 
last Statistical Account ; but what its capabilities may be for still

further improvement, or how far the happiness of the productive 
classes might be increased, it would not be easy to determme.

Revised and partly re-ioritten April 1839. 

Earthquakes.— The writer avails himself of permission given him, 
while these sheets are passing through the press, to notice the in- 
teresting phenomenon that occurred in October 1839, of several 
distinct'shocks of earthquakes. The most remarkable were those 
on the 17th and 23d of the month,— the former at ten minutes 
before three o'clock a. m., and the latter at twenty minutes past 
ten p. M. In both cases a rumbling noise preceded the concus- 
sion, which was accompanied with a tremulous andundulatory mo- 
tion, somewhat resembling the feeling on board ship when a wave 
strikes heavily against the bow of the vessel. The undulation was 
so violent, that, in some instances, people were turned round m 
their beds ; and the concussion so severe, that the doors slammed 
violently, and the glasses danced on the table. The concussion 
was most distinctly felt in the upper parts of the houses, and uni- 
versal testimony concurred in giving the direction from the south- 
vest, — a fact which leads us to trace the connection of the shocks 
felt here with those at Comrie about the same period. 

The only other fact necessary to mention is, that the week pre- 
vious to the last shock, the weather was dry and favourable for 
harvest operations. The barometer had risen to 29.75. On the 
22d there was a heavy rain from the east, which continued during 
the 23d, the day of the shock. From that date the weather be- 
came completely broken. The barometer was carefully examined 
on both occasions, but did not appear, at the time, to be sensibly 
affected by either of the shocks. By a strange anomaly, however, 
it stood high during the long period of continued wet weather which 
followed. It is a remarkable circumstance, too, that the shock of 
an earthquake, which was felt here in 1816, and which appears 
to have been much about the same in violence with those of last 
year, was followed by a long track of wet weather, so that in that 
year, as in the last, the crop was wholly lost.

PRESBYTERY OF GARIOCH, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. HENRY SIMSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name and Boundaries. — The ancient name of this parish was 
Logie Durno or Durnock, which is said to signify a low or hollow 
place. Before the Reformation, it would appear that there were 
three places of public worship in the parish, viz. Logie Durno, 
Fetternear, and a chapel, formerly called Capella Beatse Marise 
Virginis de Garryocb, where the present parochial church is now 
built. Early in the seventeenth century, the parsonage of Fetter- 
near, lying on the north side of the river Don, was annexed to 
that of Logie Durno on the north side of the Ury. The church was 
then transferred from Logie Durno to its present situation, at the 
east end of the hill of Benochie, on account of its being the most 
centrical part of the parish, and appointed to be called Chapel of 
Garioch, in a decree respecting the stipend obtained about that 
time. It is the seat of the Presbytery of Garioch, which consists 
of fifteen members, and forms one of the most convenient and 
compact presbyteries in Scotland ; no clergyman being farther dis- 
tant from the usual place of meeting than nine miles. 

The parish of Chapel of Garioch is 10 miles in length from 
north to south, and from 2 to 3 from east to west. It forms an 
irregular figure. Its greatest breadth at the northern extremity 
is 5 miles, and at the southern 3; from whence it contracts, as it 
approaches towards the centre of the parish, where its greatest 
breadth does not exceed 2 miles. It is bounded on the north by 
the parishes of Rayne and Daviot ; on the east, by Bourtie, Keith- 
hall, and Inverury ; on the south, by Monymusk, and that part of 
the parish of Kemnay which lies on the south side of the river of 
Don ; and on the west, by the parish of Oyne, and hill of Benochie. 

Topographical Jppeara.nccs.— The surface of the parish is un- 
even ; but can neither be said to be mountainous or hilly. There 

• Chart. Aberdnn, p. 31. 



CHAPEL OF GARIOCH. 



561 



are two ridges of rising ground to the north and south of the Ury, 
which stretch from west to east, in a direction nearly parallel to it, 
and which are either planted or cultivated up to their summits. 
On the ridge to the south of the Ury the church is built ; by 
which the old road from Aberdeen to the upper part of the Ga- 
l ioch and Cabrach went, previously to the present turnpike road 
being made. About half a mile to the east of the church, there 
is an eminence which commands an extensive view of the Garioch, 
and from which nine parochial churches, with as many manses, 
may be seen ; all of which, with the exception of Kinneller, are 
in the Presbytery of Garioch. 

Soil, Climate, Sfc. — The soil is of various characters. In some 
parts of the parish, it consists of a rich black loam, and in other 
parts, it has a considerable mixture of clay on a tilly bottom. 
On the banks of the rivers, it is generally of a strong gravel, in- 
termixed with vegetable mould. These soils produce fine grain, 
and early crops, considering their elevated situation ; and as an 
instance of the fertility of this district, it may be mentioned, that 
the Garioch has been considered and called the granary of Aber- 
deenshire. The climate is reckoned temperate and salubrious. 
There are no diseases peculiar to the inhabitants of this parish, 
who are in general remarkably healthy, and instances of longevity 
are numerous. Many persons in the parish have attained to the 
age of seventy, eighty, and even ninety years and upwards; which 
may in a great measure be attributed to the dry and bracing cli- 
mate, and to the temperate habits of the parishioners. 

Hydrography. — This parish is well supplied with excellent 
springs of water, which issue from gravelly soils. The only two 
rivers of any consequence connected with it are the Ury and the 
Don. The river Ury takes its rise in Strathbogie, and, after a 
course of about sixteen miles, following its windings, it enters this 
parish, and runs through it for about five or six miles. After 
leaving the confines of the parish, it moves onwards in its course 
for a mile and a half farther, dividing a part of the parish of Keith- 
hall from that of Inverury, and then falls into the Don, imme- 
diately below the said burgh. It is one of the finest trouting 
streams in the north of Scotland, and trouts have been caught in 
it weighing from one to five pounds. 

The river Don, which rises in the mountains between Aber- 
deen and Banffshire, about three miles above Corgarff, and empties 
itself into the German Ocean about a mile from Aberdeen, forms 

ABEnOEEN. N n 



562 ADKRDEENSIIIKE. 



the southern boundary of the parish for about three miles. Fol- 
lowing its turnings and windings, from the source to the mouth, it 
is about sixty-one miles in length, and in an ideal straight line 
about forty-two miles. It also abounds with salmon, eel, trout, 
and pike ; but the rod-fishing for salmon has been in this neigh- 
bourhood, for some years past, greatly deteriorated, in consequence 
of part of the water having been diverted from the channel of the 
river, to supply the various manufactories on the banks of the Don, 
in the vicinity of the city of Aberdeen. The salmon come up the 
river to spawn in the end of the month of September, and return 
again to the sea about the beginning of the month of April. 
° Geolocjij and Mineralogy.— T\ie rocks consist chiefly of granite 
and whinstone. Their direction is from east to west, and they 
dip towards the north. Detached masses of these are also to be 
found scattered over the face of the country. It is rather a sin- 
gular circumstance, that almost the whole of the rocks to the north 
of the Ury, and for two miles to the south of it, are of whinstone ; 
whilst the remainder of the parish, for three miles to the south of 
a small stream called Burnervie, which issues from Benochie, is of 
granite. Cairngorums have been occasionally found here of con- 
siderable magnitude, and portions of the rock are sometimes stud- 
ded over with very iiiinute crystals of it, which are generally very 
complete in their formation. The principal stones used for build- 
incr mansion-houses and farm -steadings in the neighbourhood, are 
obtained from the hill of Benochie, and also at its base m this 
parish. The chimney-pieces in the two drawing rooms of Logie 
Elphinstone are of Benochie granite, and the crystals of these 
specimens are similar to the Egyptian granite, which, although 
not so large in grain, yet admit of an equally good polish. A 
quarry of limestone was opened, some years ago, upon the estate 
of Pittodrie ; but, owing to the distance from coal, and as it was 
found to be neither pure, nor remunerating, it was soon given up. 

XooZoffV.— There are none of the rarer species of animals to be 
found in this parish ; but, under his head, the writer may remark 
that amona- others more common, the foUowmg quadrupeds and 
birds have°been seen in it, viz. red-deer, roebuck, bare, rabbit, 
fox, hedgehog, badger, polecat, weasel, otter ; wild goose, wild 
duck, teal, pheasant, woodcock, blackcock, fieldfare, raven, heron, 
snipe, magpie, jackdaw, swallow, sparrow hawk, bluehawk, corn- 
rail grey owl, goldfinch, bullfinch, blackbird, thrush, and cuckoo. 
Some years ago, there was shot at Pittodrie, a great northern diver

or ember goose, which was stuffed, and is now in the possession 
of Colonel Knight Erskine. 

II. — Civil History. 

Pictures. — Amongst many others, there are at Logie Elphin- 
stone, portraits of Bishop Elphinstone, of Charles Lord Elphin- 
stone, of Sir John and Sir James Elphinstone of Logie Elphin- 
stone, and other patrons of the parish of the same family ; of Vis- 
count Dundee, of Count Patrick Leslie of Balquhain, and of Sir 
James Leslie of Pitcaple. 

Eminent Characters.- — Sir Walter Farquhar, Bart, who was born 
at Peterhead, was son to the late Rev. Robert Farquhar, for many 
years minister of Chapel of Garioch. Having gone through a 
course of classical learning at the parochial school of that parish, 
he went to the University of Aberdeen, where, having finished 
his academical studies, he took his departure for London, and af- 
terwards became one of the physicians of King George IV. whilst 
Prince Regent. 

Land-oioners. — The land-owners, according to the valued rent 
of their respective properties, are as follows ;

Parochial Registers. — The records of the kirk-session begin on 
the 9th of May 1714, and from that time to the present period, 
they appear to have been accurately kept. There are four vo- 
lumes of these records. There are two volumes of baptismal re- 
gisters, which have been rather irregularly kept till within these 
few years. They begin upon the 6th of May 1763. The regis- 
ter of marriages only commences in the year 1817 ; and there is 
no register of burials. 

Antiquities.— Ahont half a mile to the south-east of the church 
is to be seen the old ruinous castle of Balquhain, the ancient seat 
of the Leslies of Balquhain. In it Queen Mary spent a day in 
her journey to the north, which terminated in the battle of Cor- 
richie; and at which time, it is said, .she attended mass in the church 
of Chapel of Garioch. This castle is of so great antiquity, that 



564 ABERDEENSHIRE. 

there is no tradition of its erection ; but it is said to have been 
burnt to tle ground by the Duke of Cumberland m the year 1746. 
The walls are six feet thick, and the cement almost as hard as the 
stone. From it, there is one of the finest echoes ni Scotland. 
There is also, at a short distance to the east of it, a Drmd.cal circle 
which is very entire. About a mile to the north of it, the tenant 
in Mains of Balquhain, about three years ago m trenching a piece 
of barren ground, called the Gallow Hill, dug up three human 
sculls which, from the name of the spot, were supposed to have 
belonged to criminals or vassals in the fedual ages. 

The Castle of Pitcaple, which is situated on the south bank of 
the Ury, is also an ancient building; but a considerable addiUon 
was recently made to it, according to a plan prepared by Mr W il- 
liam Burn of Edinburgh, whose taste in this department of archi- 
tecture is generally acknowledged. There are various historical 
traditions connected with the old castle, some of which may be 

mentioned. „ , 

The celebrated but unfortunate Marquis of Montrose, after mak- 
ing his final attempt to support the royal cause in the northern 
part of Scotland, was defeated by the Covenanters in Sutherland 
and obliged to borrow the clothes of a poor H,ghla.ider, in the 
hope of 'escaping from his enemies. In this habit he traversed 
the mountain' fr a few days ; but bemg at length 
hunger and fatigue, he was induced to throw himself on the ho 
. nouf and humanity of Macleod of Assynt, to whose castle he r - 
paired, not doubting that Macleod, who had been formerly 
amongst his followert would afford him an asy urn - thjs Per.od 
7 adversity. Macleod betrayed his commander, and delivered 
him up to Generals Leslie and Strachan. 

In the course of their progress southward, they arrived at Pit- 
caple, on which occasion this illustrious nobleman, '''l 
. ble costume, was seated on a Highland pony having bs ee.d 
underneath with straw ropes. Before him rode a herald exclaim- 
ing " Here comes James Graham, a traitor to his country. 

The Laird of Pitcaples wife, who was cousin to Montrose, hu- 
■ maneW offered her assistance towards facilitating his escape. She

neous passage, and she advised him to creep down through it. Bu 
on examininVthe place, he said, " Rather than go down to be

smothered in that hole, I will take my chance at Edinburgh." 
The room in whibh he was confined is called Montrose's room to 

this day. , , , ■ .1 

The circumstances now detailed must have taken place m the 
month of April 1650, as Montrose landed in Orkney m the be- 
ainninff of March, and was executed at Edinburgh upon the 21st 

of May that year. . 
■ In the month of July, the same year, Kmg Charles II. havmg 
sailed from Holland, landed at Garmouth upon the Spey, from 
whence he proceeded to rest at the Bog of Gight,' now Gordon 
Castle. When on his journey southward, the King sent notice 
to Leslie of Pitcaple that he was to dine with him. Pitcaple re- 
ceived the communication in the market called St Sair's Fair, and 
hearing tliat his Majesty was attended by a considerable number 
of followers, he was apprehensive of his stock of wine not being 
sufficient, and he purchased all the claret in the market, to aid in 
entertaining the Royal party. 

When Charles crossed the Ury, near the Castle of Pitcaple, he 
is said to have been struck with the luxuriancy of the crop, observ- 
iilg that it reminded him of dear England. The farm, to which 
this remark was applied, has ever since been called England, and' 
is still known by this name. 

On the occasion of the Royal visit, a ball took place here, and 
the party danced under the thorn tree which still stands on the 
lawn, and which is said to be one of the largest thorn trees in 
Great Britain. 

• When Charles took his departure from Pitcaple, the Duke of 
Buckingham was on his right hand, and the Marquis of Argyle 
on his left. It will readily be believed that so interesting a spec- 
tacle would attract a great number of the people in the neighbour- 
hood. Among the multitude, and perched on the top of a dike, 
was the " good wife" of Glack, who, nothing daunted by the pre- 
sence of Argyle, exclaimed with a shrill voice, " God bless your 
Majesty, and send you to your ain ; but they are on your left hand 
that helped to tak afF your father's head, and if ye tak na care, 
they will hae aff your's next." 

There is also another tradition, that, upon a certain occasion, 
when there was a garrison of Covenanters in the Castle of Pitcaple, 
they expected a party of their friends to celebrate a marriage on 
the lawn. The opposite party having become aware of this cir-

cumstance, very ingeniously availed themselves of the information, 
by decking themselves out as people attending a wedding ; and 
having brought with them a piper, they commenced dancing on 
the green. The garrison speedily went out to join them, when 
their enemies dancing around to intercept them, pulled up the . 
draw-bridge, and thus obtained possession of the castle without 
violence or bloodshed. 

The traditions now detailed were communicated by the late 
Miss Lumsden of Pitcaple, the great grand-daughter of the laird 
who received King Charles as above, and who afterwards accom- 
panied the King to Worcester. 

Battle ofHarlaw.—Von the 24th of July 1411, on St James's 
Even, the memorable and bloody battle of Harlaw was fought m 
this parish, between Alexander Earl of Mar, who commanded the 
Royal army, and Donald, Lord of the Isles. Donald having pass- 
ed through Ross-shire, and having afterwards ravaged Moray, 
Strathbogie, and the Garioch, promised his followers a rich booty 
in the plunder of Aberdeen. The Duke of Albany, then Regent, 
alarmed at the progress of Donald, sent a commission to Alexan- 
der Earl of Mar to levy forces and oppose him. The Earl, m a 
very short time, found himself at the head of the whole power of 
Mar and Garryach Garioch, in addition to that of Angus and 
the Mearns; Sir Alexander Ogilvie, Sheriff of Angus; Sir James 
Scrymgeour, Constable of Dundee, and hereditary Standard-bear- 
er of Scotland; Sir Alexander Irvine, Sir Robert Melville, Sir 
William de Abernethy, nephew to Albany, and many other ba- 
• rons and esquires, with their feudal services, joined him with dis- 
played banner ; and Sir Robert Davidson, the Provost of Aber- 
deen, and a troop of the stoutest burgesses, came boldly forward 
to defend their hearths and their stalls from the ravages of the 

Island King. t i 

Mar immediately advanced from Aberdeen, and, marching by 
Inverurv, came in sight of the Highlanders at the village of Har- 
law, on the Water of Ury, not far from its junction with the 
Don He found that his little army was immensely out-number- 
ed, it is said, by nearly ten to one; but it consisted of the bravest 
barons in these parts; and his experience had taught him to con- 
sider a single knight in steel as a fair match against a w-hole troop 
of ketherans. Without delay, therefore, he intrusted the leaduig 
of the vaward to the Constable of Dundee, and Ogilvy, the bhe-

riff of Angus, who had with them a small but compa'ct battalion 
of kniohts and men-at-arms; whilst he himself followed with the 
rearward, composed of the main strength of his army, mcludmg 
the Irvines of Drum, the Maules, the Morays, the Straitons, the 
Leslies, the Stirlings, the Lovels, headed by their chiefs, and 
with their banners and penoncelles waving amid their grove of 
spears. Of the Islesmen and Highlanders the principal leaders 
were, the Lord of the Isles himself, with Macintosh and Mac- 
lean, the heads of their respective septs, and innumerable other 
chiefs and chieftains, animated by the old and deep-rooted hosti- 
lity between the Celtic and Saxon race. 

The shock between two such armies may be easily imagined to 
have been awful,— the Highlanders, who were 10,000 strong, 
rushing on with the fierce shouts and yells which it was their cus- 
tom to raise in coming into battle, and the knights meeting them 
with levelled spears, and ponderous maces and battle-axes, which 
inflicted ghastly wounds upon their half-armed opponents. In his 
first onset Scryrageour, and the knights and bannerets who fought 
under him, with little difficulty drove back the mass of Islesmen, 
and, cutting his way through their thick columns, made a dreadful 
slaughter. But, though hundreds fell around him, thousands 
poured in to supply their place, more fierce and fresh than their 
predecessors ; whilst Mar, who had penetrated with his main army 
into the very heart of the enemy, found himself in the same diffi- 
culties, becoming every moment more tired with the slaughter, 
more encumbered with the numbers of the slain, and less able to 
resist the increasing ferocity and reckless courage of the masses 
that still yelled and fought around him. It was impossible that 
this should continue much longer without making a fatal impres- 
sion against the Scots, and the effects of fatigue were soon seen. 
The Constable of Dundee was slain ; and the Highlanders, en- 
couraged by his fall, wielded their broadswords and Lochaber-axes 
with murderous effect, seizing and stabbing the horses, and pull- 
ing down their riders, whom they dispatched with their daggers. 
In this way were slain some of the best and bravest soldiers of 
these northern districts. Sir Robert Davidson, with the greater 
part of the stalwart burgesses who fought around him, were amongst 
the number ; and many of the families lost not only their chief, 
but every male in the house. Leslie of Balquhain, a baron of a 
noble and ancient lineage, is said to have fallen, with six of his sons 
slain beside him. The Sheriff of Angus, with his eldest son, George

Ogilvy; Sir Alexander Irvine of Drum, Sir Robert Maule, Sir 
Thomas Moray, William Abernethy, Alexander Straiten of Lauris- 
ton, James Lovei, Alexander Stirling, and above five hundred men 
at-arms, including the principal gentry of Buchan, shared their 
fate ; f whilst Mar himself, and a small number of survivors, still 
continued the battle till nightfall, when the slaughter ceased, and 
it was found in the morning that the Island Lord had retreated, 
checked and broken certainly by the desperate contest, but neither 
conquered, nor very effectually repulsed. Mar, on the contrary, 
although he passed the night on the field, did so, not in the tri- 
umphant assertion of victory, but from the effects of wounds and 
exhaustion. The best and bravest of his friends were stretched 
in their last sleep around him, and he found himself totally unable 
to pursue the retreat of the Islesmen. Amongst those of the 
Highlanders wha fell, were the chiefs of Maclean and Macintosh, 
with upwards of nine hundred men ; a small loss compared with 
that sustained by the Lowlanders. From the ferocity with which 
this battle was contested, and the dismal spectacle of civil war 
exhibited to the country, it appears to have made a deep impres- 
sion on the national mind. It fixed itself on the music and the poetry 
of Scotland. A march called the Battle of Harlaw continued to 
be a popular air, down to the time of Drummond of Hawthorn- 
den ; and a spirited ballad on the same event is still repeated in 
our own age, describing the meeting of the armies and the death 
of the chiefs in no ignoble strain.§ Soon after the battle, a coun- 
cil general was held by the governor, in which a statute was pass- 
ed in favour of the heirs of those who had died in defence of the 
country, exempting them from the feudal fines usually exacted, be-

+ Here it may perhaps be considered as not out of place to remark, that, m ae- 
scrtbing the result of the battle of Harlaw, Mr Tytler has fallen into an ""Portant 
Sographical error in stating that the ai-my of the Isles -rf ted ' by Inve

fore they entered upon possession of their estates, and permitting 
them, although minors, immediately to serve heirs to their lands. 
Bruce, on the eve of the battle of Bannockburn, encouraged his 
troops by a promise of the like nature. 

Buchanan also observes, that, in the Battle of Harlaw, there 
perished more noble and illustrious men, than had fallen in foreign 
warfare during many years ; and a village, formerly obscure, be- 
came distinguished to after ages. 

In the immediate neighbourhood, two cairns were opened a 
few years ago. In the first, nothing was found but ashes ; and 
in the other, a stone coffin of rude workmanship, containing hu- 
man bones, and also ashes. There are other two cairns upon the 
field of battle, still left untouched. The one, as formerly men- 
tioned, is called Drum's Cairn, and the other Maclean's Grave.f 
The field upon which, it is said, the battle was fought, is about 
a quarter of a mile to the south-east of the farm of Harlaw, and 
still goes by the name of the Pley Fauld. About a hundred yards 
to the west of said farm, is to be seen a large whinstone, about 7 
feet in height and 2 in breadth, which is called the Liggar's Stane 
and which is said to have been put up in its present situation, to 
mark the spot where the females who followed the soldiers, and 
who were slain in the battle, were buried. A few years ago, there 
were two of these stones; but at that time, one of them was re- 
moved by a farmer in the neighbourhood ; and after being broken 
down, was put into his house which was then building. 

In the Genealogical Collections of Macfarlane, preserved in 
the Advocates' Library,| as mentioned by Tytler, there is a 
manuscript account of the family of Maclean, which informs us 
that Lauchlan Lubanich had by McDonald's daughter a son, 
called Eachin Rusidth ni Cath, or Hector Rufus Bellicosus. He 
commanded as lieutenant-general under the Earl of Ross at the 
Battle of Harlaw in 1411, where he and Irvine of Drum, seeking 
out one another by their armorial bearings on their shields, met 
and killed each other. He was married to a daughter of the Earl 
of Douglas. 

 The fact mentioned in tb"e text is proved by a retour in the Chartulary of Aber- 
deen, fol. 121, in favour of Andrew de Tulidef, whose fether, William de TuHdef, 
"was slain at Harlaw. 

t In the year 1837, when the tenant at Harlaw was trenching a piece of barren 
ground, about a quarter of a mile to the north of the field of battle, he dug up the 
bones of about twelve human bodies. Part of a scull, and of tlie tliigh bones, are in 
the possession of the writer hereof. The place in which they were found was a trench 
about 34 feet deep, 4 feet wide, and 12 feet in length.

In the manuscript Geographical Description of Scotland, col- 
lected by the same industrious antiquary, Advocates' Library, 
Vol. i. p. 7, it is mentioned, that to the west of the field of 
battle about half a mile, is a farmer's house, called Legget's Den, 
hard by, in which is a tomb built in the form of a malt steep, of , 
four large stones covered with a broad stone above, where, as the 
country people generally report, Donald of the Isles lies buried, 
being slain in the battle, and therefore they call it commonly 
Donald's Tomb, So far the manuscript. It is certain, however, 
says Tytler, that the Lord of the Isles was not slain. This may 
probably be the tomb of the chief of Maclean or Macintosh, both 
of whom fell in the battle. It is more likely to have been Macin- 
tosh's tomb, as Maclean's grave, as formerly mentioned, is still 
pointed out on the field of battle. Some of the stones com- 
posing this tomb, were in the situation as above described, till 
about thirty years ago, when the tenant unfortunately removed 
them. One of them is still shown as forming part of an embank- 
ment to prevent the river of Ury from encroaching upon the farm  
of Mill of Pitcaple ; but what became of the others is unknown. ■ 

To the north of the House of Pitcaple, there are traces of aafl 
ancient camp; immediately adjoining to which, the foundation of 
an old bridge across the Ury was, some years ago, discovered. 

It is said that Lollius Urbicus, the gallant general of Antoni- 
nus Pius, crossed the Don at Inverury, passing Harlaw and Pits- 
curry in Chapel of Garioch, near to the latter of which places are 
the remains of a Roman post, placed there, as is supposed, to 
keep up their communications between the camps of Peterculter 
and Glen-mailen, about twenty-six statute miles from each other. 

Chalmers in his Caledonia observes, that there is indeed reason 
to believe, that there are traces of roads which may have been 
made by Roman hands, farther north than that which went across 
the moor at Brechin, where vestiges of it appear pointing to Keith- 
ock. In Aberdeenshire, between the rivers Don and Ury, on 
the eastern side of Benochie, there exists an ancient road,t which 
is known in the country by the appropriate name of the Maiden 
Causeway 4 It proceeds from Benochie, whereon there was a 

 There is a tradition still prevalent in the parish, that this farm was so named, 
in consequence of a conference having been held here, betweeii one of the Kings 
of Scotland and a Pope's legate. _ 

t The traces of this ancient road are still visible. 

 Some of the Roman roads in the north of England are distinguished bj tlie 
same name of Maiden Causeway.

hill fort, more than the distance of a mile, into the woods of Pit- 
todrie, where it disappears from the most inquisitive sight. It is 
paved with stones, is about 14 feet wide, and has every appear- 
ance of a vicinal way of the Romans. This Maiden-way says 
Colonel Shand is on the west side of the ninth Iter on its course 
from the Don to the springs of Ithan, the Ituna of Richard, 
where the camp oi Glen-raailen was placed, the station of Rae- 
dikes. If this way were continued in its appropriate direction, it 
would join the tract of the Iter near the river of Ury, and conti- 
guous to the supposed Roman post. 

About a quarter of a mile to the north of the supposed Roman 
post, there was dug up about two years ago, within four inches of 
the surface, a stone coffin of rude workmanship containing human 
bones, and a Roman urn of baked clay filled with ashes, which is 
now in the possession of SirRobert Dalrymple Home Elphinstone, 
Bart. The scull and jaw bones, together with the teeth, were very 
entire. The cofiin was composed of five stones. It had on each 
side and on each end of it, a rude granite" flag, and was covered 
with a slab of the same material It was four feet in length, two 
in breadth, one and a half in depth, and the cover one stone, mea- 
suring five feet by three. Another Roman urn of baked clay, 
containing human bones, which had been exposed to the action of 
fire, was dug up, in 1838, betwixt Pitcaple House and the Ury, 
and is now in Mr Lumsden's possession. 

To the west of the House of Logie Elphinstone, and about a 
quarter of a mile distant from it, the tenant of Craigmill, about 
three years ago, when trenching a piece of barren ground, dug up 
a stone coffin, in which ashes only were deposited. Nothing, how- 
ever, was found to elucidate the time andoccasion of its being 
placed there ; but as it was surrounded by a cairn of stones, it 
marked, in all probability, the spot where one of the chieftains of 
Donald of the Isles was buried, in his retreat to Ross-shire and the 
Isles from the battle of Harlaw. 

About half a-mile to the north-west of the church, is to be seen 
a large stone, called the Maiden Stone, which is\ ten feet high 
above ground, two feet and ten inches broad, and about ten inch - 
es thick. It is supposed to be about six feet below the surface of 
the ground. Upon it there are several curious hieroglyphical fi- 
gures cut. The occasion of its erection is unknown ; but there is 
a tradition that there existed a feud betwixt the Laird of Balqu- 
hain, and the neighbouring proprietor of Harthill, which was carried 



572 ABEUDEKNSHIIIE. 

to such a height, that they had no intercourse with each other. Not- 
withstanding of this, it is reported that the daughter of the for- 
mer and the son of the latter became attached to each other. Up- 
on an appointed day, the young people set off together, when their 
flight being immediately communicated to the Laird of Balquhain, ' 
he pursued them with as many of his vassals as he could collect, 
and having overtaken the fugitives at the place where the stone 
is erected, a rencontre took place, in which the young lady was un- 
fortunately killed. Afterwards, this stone was erected to her me- 
mory, and from hence called the Maiden Stone. In the opinion 
of some antiquaries, the heiroglyphics upon it are Danish. It 
might have, also, had some connection with the Maiden Causeway 
on the hill of Benochie, as it is about equidistant betwixt it and 
the supposed Roman post near Pitcaple House. 

The ruins of the Church of Logic Durno, in the lands of Logie 
Elphinstone, and of Fetternear, in the lands of Balquhain, with - 
their accompanying cemeteries, completely surrounded with wood, 
are still visible. 

Mansion Houses.— There are four mansion-houses in the pa- 
rish, viz. Logie- Elphinstone, the residence of Sir Robert Dalrym- 
ple Horn Elphinstone, Bart. ; Pittodrie, the residence of Colonel 
Knight Erskine. Balquhain, the residence of Ernest Leslie, Esq. ; 
and Pitcaple, the residence of Hugh Lumsden, Esq. Sheriff of 
Sutherlandshire. Logie Elphinstone is upon the north, and Pit- 
caple upon the south bank of the Ury. Pittodrie is upon an ele- 
vated situation on the east side of Benochie, and commands an 
extensive prospect of the rich valley of the Garioch. Fetternear 
once the residence of the Bishop of Aberdeen,t is upon the north 
bank of the Don. They are all elegant, commodious, and spa- 
cious mansions, surrounded by fertile fields, and well-wooded ; and 
have excellent gardens, avenues, and fields laid out with great 

Mills, c— There are in the parish seven corn-mills, with five 
barley mills attached to them ; another barley-mill ; two mills for 
carding and spinning wool ; a lint-mill ; and three saw-mills.

of the mills and farm-steadings are also built of granite, and others 
of them of whinstone.

The increase of the population seems chiefly to have arisen 
from the hitherto uncultivated parts of the parish having been 
converted into arable land, and cottages built for the occupants ; 
and also from the improved system of husbandry which is now fol- 
lowed in this part of the country.

The people in this parish are, in general, a tall, robust, hardy 
race, and patient of fatigue. 

There are two fatuous persons in the parish. 

In their general character, the people are sober, cleanly, industri- 
ous, and charitable to the poor; decent and exemplary in their attend- 
ance on religious ordinances ; and appear to be quite contented 
with their situation and circumstances. Their ordinary food con- 
sists of the different preparations of oatmeal, of potatoes, of greens,

The parishioners are neither addicted to poaching in game, nor 
in the salmon-fisheries. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agricultural and Rural Economy. — The number of acres in this 
parish cannot be correctly ascertained ; for whilst some of the pro- 
prietors have accurate plans of their estates lately made out, there 
are others whose plans are from sixty to one hundred years old, and 
they cannot be altogether relied upon ; besides, there are some 
farms which have never been measured ; at any rate, no plan giv- 
ing the amount of their contents, can be found. The writer hereof, 
however, has done all that was in his power to remedy this defect, 
by inquiring at tenants and others who could give him any infor- 
mation upon the subject, and if there are any mistakes, he is quite 
satisfied that they have been unintentional on the part of those to 
whom he has applied. 

The number of acres, standal-d imperial measure, in the parish, - 11,427 
which are either cultivated or occasionally in tillage, 

including 12 acres in gardens and orchards, - 8,342 
that might be added to the cultivated land of the parish, 
whether that land were afterwards to be kept in oc- 
casional tillage or permanent pasture, - 896 
that never have been cultivated, and which remain con- 
stantly waste, _ _ . 114'

under wood, the greater part of which has been planted 
within the last thirty years, - - 1,963 

The general kind of trees planted consists of larch, spruce, and 
Scotch firs ; but the mansion-houses and lawns of the resident 
proprietors are ornamented with fine old trees, such as ash, elm, 
beech, birch, horse-chestnut, and plane. The soil appears parti- 
cularly congenial to all kinds of trees. 

Rent of Land. — The rent of arable land per Scotch acre is from 
L.2 to L.2, 10s. for infield, and from 8s. to 16s. for outfield, ave- 
raging about ] 7s. 6d. per acre, and giving a rental for the parish 
of L.6000. 

The average rent of grazing is about L.3 for a cow or full-grown 
ox; L.l, 10s. for a two-year old ; and L.l for a year old. 

Rate of Wages. — A good ploughman gets from L.IO to L.I4 
per annum, and a woman servant, L.3 in summer, and L.2 in win- 

• If the east front of Benochie to the top of the hill was to be included in the mea- 
surement, it would make an addition of from 1000 to 2000 acres to the waste lands 
of the parish ; but as it is somewhat doubtful whether it belongs to the parish of 
Oyne or to that of Chapel of Garioch, it has not been taken into the calculation.

L 2 to L.2, 10s., and women's from L.l, 10s. to L.2, with victuals. 
Common labourers have from Is. 6d. to 2s. in summer, and from

Livestock.— To the improvement of the breed of cattle in this 

parish, great attention has been paid. A great proportion of them 
are of the Aberdeenshire and Buchan polled breeds, with a cross 
betwixt both. There are very few of the old Aberdeenshire horn- 
ed cattle in the country ; but the proprietors of this county pro- 
pose nest year to give premiums, in order to encourage farmers to 
rear a greater number of this breed, which were always much ad- 
mired, both for their symmetry and many valuable qualities; and 
which would make their total loss a matter of serious regret to the 
agricultural interest. Aberdeenshire cattle are held in high esti- 
mation by the English graziers, who fatten for the Smithfield mar- 
i ket, and during the winter a great many in this parish are fed upon 
I turnips and straw, and are either sold to the butcher, or sent by 
I .sea to London. 

Husbandry. — The system of husbandry pursued is, in most 
cases, a seventh rotation. In breaking up the lea or pasture 
ground, which has lain in grass for three seasons, the first crop is 
oats ; 2. oats ; 3. turnips or potatoes, having the soil well manured ; 
4. oats, bear, or barley, sown down with rye-grass and clover seeds ; 
I. hay; 6. pasture; 7. pasture. A few acres of wheat are also 
sown annually after potatoes or summer-fallow, and good crops of 
it are produced. It has not been hitherto much cultivated ; but 
as there have been such fine seasons of late, and the climate hav- 
ing been much improved by extensive drainage, farmers are find- 
ing the culture of it profitable, and several of them have sown 
small patches of it, this year, who never before attempted to raise 
such a crop. 

Turnips have been for many years cultivated largely in the pa- 
rish, and the introduction 'of bone-manure has enabled the farmer 
to raise a greater quantity of them, and by this means to improve 
his ground, and also to rear and fatten more cattle for the butcher. 

A large extent of waste ground has been reclaimed within the 
last fifty years, and a considerable proportion of the fields have 
been enclosed with stone dikes.

The duration of leases is nineteen years, and every encourage- 
ment has been given by the proprietors to respectable and indus- 
trious tenants. The greater part of the farm-buildings are excel- 
lent, commodious, and suitable to the occupants. The landlords 
are not much given to change, and consequently the tenants are 
seldom turned out of their possessions. Indeed, many of the an- 
cestors of the present generation for more than a century have 
been inhabitants of the parish, and, in several instances, were tacks- 
men of the same farms which their descendants now occupy. 
There are at present living upon the lands of Logie Elphinstone 
three brothers and two sisters, all above seventy years of age, 
and whose united ages amount to 390 years. With the excep- 
tion of eleven years residence in a neighbouring parish, they, to- 
gether with their paternal and maternal ancestors, have been te- 
nants in the parish for about 120 years. 

Produce.— The average gross amount of raw produce yearly 
raised in the parish, as nearly as that can be ascertained, is as 
follows : — 

Of 3570 imperial acres in corn crop of all the different kinds, whe- 
ther cultivated for food of man or the domestic animals, at L.J,

Market-Town.— The parish contains neither village nor town. 
The nearest market-town is Inverury, which is distant from the 
church about four or five miles. There is now a post-office at 
Pitcaple, which is of great advantage to the neighbourhood. 

mLis of Communication.— The parish is well supplied with 
roads There are four miles and a half of turnpike road, and 
thirty-five of statute-labour. The roads and bridges are kept m 
a sood state of repair. The south mail from Aberdeen, and the 
north mail from Inverness, generally meet each other daily m the 
parish about ten o'clock every morning. There are also t u-ee 
stage coaches, which pass every lawful day to and rom Aberdeen 
thrmigh the parish ; besides carriers from Hui.tly, Keith, and 
other parts of the country on their way to Aberdeen 

Ecclesiastical State.-The parish church was budt in 1813. It

is a substantial edifice, built of granite, and in very good repair. 
It is situated as nearly as possible in the centre of the parish, as 
to its territorial boundaries being about five miles from the south- 
ern, and the like distance from the northern extremities ; but it 
unfortunately happens that the most populous parts of the parish 
are at the two extremities, and near to the old church of Logie 
Durno, and the parsonage of Fetternear. 

The Established Church is the only place of public worship in 
the parish, and accommodates from 750 to 800 persons. With 
the exception of the minister's and elders' seats, each of the heritors 
has his proportion of the church allotted for his own family, and 
nlso for his tenants, so that it may be said that all the seats are free. 

The manse was built in the year 1789 : an addition was made 
to it in 1814, and another addition in 1831. It is now a large, 
comfortable, and commodious house, and one of the best manses 
in the country. 

The glebe is 18 imperial acres in extent, and is worth about 
L.'25 Sterling per annum. 

The stipend is 16 chalders Linlithgow measure, half meal, half 
barley, according to the fiar prices of the county, together with 
L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. The average amount for 
the last seven years, exclusive of communion elements, is L. 216, 
12s. l|d. 

The last augmentation was obtained in 1826, leaving the teinds 
unexhausted. 

 la 1839, a very neat church, capable of containing 500 sitters,' was erected at 
Blairdaff, in the south side of this parish, about four miles and a-half distant from 
the church of Chapel of Garioch. It is placed in a beautiful situation, and com- 
pletely surrounded with wood. Besides the portion of this parish lying to the south, 
a part of the parishes of Oyne and Monymusk, containing in the three parishes a po- 
pulation of more than 1000 souls, are accommodated by this erection. The ex- 
pense of the church was about L. 500, and was defrayed by subscriptions from some 
of the heritors and parishioners of Chapel of Garioch, Oyne, and Monymusk; from 
the ministers of the presbytery of Garinch, and other charitable individuals connected 
with this part of the country; and also from a liberal grant from the General Assembly's 
Church Extension fund. The ground on which the church is built, and that intend- 
ed for a burial ground, containing in whole about a Scots acre, was most handsomely 
conveyed over by Robert Grant, Ksq. of Tillyfour, to the minister and elders of the 
parish of Chapel of Gaiioch, and their successors in office, the minister and elders of 
said parish, in all time coming, for the payment of one penny Scotch, in name of 
blench farm at Whitsunday yearly, upon the ground, if asked only. There is no debt 
upon the building. The church was opened for public worship upon the 9th day of 
June 1839, and since that period has been always well attended. At the dispensation 
of the sacrament of our Lord's Supper this year 1840 in the new church, there 
T" 3' 8 communicants. It is much to be regretted that an endowment cannot be 
obtamed for this church, as the hearers in the neighbourhood are in general so poor 
that they can afford to give but little for the support even of a preacher to officiate 
each Lord s day.

The numbers belonging to the Established Church are, of fa-

Divine service in the Established Church and in the new 
church is exceedingly well attended. 

The number of communicants in the church of Chapel of 
Garioch, at the last dispensation of the sacrament was 807. 
There are from 34 to 40 young communicants annually, and they 
generally communicate for the first time, when they are about

church collections, interest of capital, mortcloth, proclamation- 
dues, and a mortification of L. 10 annually. The church col- 
lections for the support of the 'poor for the last seven years, in- 
cluding the sacramental ones, average L. 58, Os. ld. yearly ; and 
when ic is considered that the population is entirely agricultural, 
. the writer has great satisfaction in recording the amount, as it 
 evinces the liberality of the parishioners, and also the regularity 
with which they attend public worship. The interest of capital 
L. 425, at 3i per cent. is L. 14, 17s. 6d. The mortcloth 
and proclamation -dues average L. 5, 6s. ; and a non-resident 
heritor gives to the poor annually a donation of L. 5. In addition 
to these funds, there is L.IO annually mortified to the poor by Dr 
Anderson, late of St Christopher's, a native of this parish. He 
also, at same time, mortified L. 20 annually for a free-school to 
be kept within the parish of Chapel of Garioch; but unfortunately 
for us, added, " or elsewhere in North Britain, as my aforesaid 
trustees shall think it most expedient." This addition has hither- 
to deprived the parish of the benefit of this school; for although it 
is much wanted by the distant population, for whom teachers can 
with great difficulty be obtained, as the remuneration is so small, — 
yet Dr Anderson's Trustees have never as yet seen the expediency 
of implementing this part of the testament so far as Chapel of 
Garioch is concerned ; but have, as I have every reason to believe, 
opened a school in some other part of the country, and pay the. 
schoolmaster this mortified sum. 

The average number of poor persons receiving parochial aid is 
35, and almost the whole of them are old persons. The allowance 
to each averages from 9s. to 15s. per quarter, and in the quarter, 
in which the sacrament is dispensed, all of them receive 2s. ad- 
ditional. There is also a fatuous pauper, who receives annual- 
ly from L. 7 to L. 8. Occasional aid is likewise given to poor 
persons, who are not upon the roll. Some of the resident heri- 
tors are very attentive to the poor upon their estates, and give to 
several of them from one to two bolls of meal annually, together 
with a free house, garden, and fire ; indeed, the whole of the

parishioners who can afford it, are ever ready to alleviate the 
distresses, and to supply the wants of their poorer brethren. 

The income for the last seven 'years exclusive of L. 15 ol ie- 
ffacies has been L. 652, 8s. 8d., giving an average annually of 
L 93 4s ld. for the use of the poor. The expenditure duimg , 
the s'ame period has been L. 605, 9s. 7id,, giving an average 
annually of L. 86, 9s. Hi . There is also an annual collec- 
tion for the Aberdeen Infirmary, which gives free admission to all 
parishioners recommended by the session. The seven last collec- 
tions amounted in whole to L. 06, lis. 6d. giving an average an- 
nually of L.9, 10s. 21 fd. During the same period, there have 
been three collections for the pauper lunatic fund, under the ma- 
nao-ement of the Presbytery of Garioch, amounting in whole to 
L 18 10s. and two collections for the Propagation of the Gospel 
in' India,— the first amounting to L. 7, 7s. and the second to L. 5, 
5s so that the church collections of this parish for the poor, and 
for' religious and charitable purposes, during the last seven years, 
exclusive of proclamation dues, mortcloth, donations, and mor- 
tification, have amounted to the sum of L.503, 17s. lid, ave- 
raging annually L. 71, 19s. 8fd. 

It is with reluctance that the poor, in general, seek tor paro- 
chial aid; and there are individuals in the parish who would sub- 
mit to any inconvenience rather than apply for it ; but this spirit 
of independence is not so prevalent as it was some years ago. ■ 

Inns, Alehouses, §-c.-There is one inn, and two houses li- 
censed to sell ale and spirits in the parish, which, although they 
are kept in an orderly manner, yet, to a certain extent, are preju-

course to the hill of Benochie for their peals, by a very steep and 
dangerous road, which, in a rainy season, is almost impassable. 
The moss is about 200 yards from the top of the hill, which is 
about 1440 feet above the level of the sea ; and as it is about four 
miles distant from the centre of the parish, two cart-loads can only 
be brought home by one horse during the day. The cost of a cart- 
load to the consumer is reckoned about 4s. English coals are also 
very expensive. They are to be procured at the canal basin of Port- 
Elphinstone, near Inverury, which is about five or six miles dis- 
tant from the church, and when brought here, including all ex 
penses, cost from L. 1, 63. to L. 1, 8s. per ton. English coals can 
be bought cheaper at Aberdeen ; but when it is considered that it 
is twenty miles distant, a greater expense for cartage is thus in- 
curred ; so that the ton of coals from Aberdeen, and from the 
canal basin at Inverury, may be reckoned, when laid down at 
Chapel of Garioch, about the same price. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Since the last Statistical Account was published, great im- 
provements have taken place in the parish. The system of hus- 
bandry is greatly changed for the better, and a great proportion 
of the land that was then waste, has been either planted or im- 
proved. Instead of as there stated sown grass and turnips 
beinglittle cultivated, excepting upon the farms in the possession of 
the proprietors, every farmer, and even cottager, has at present 
his rotation of these crops, and where nothing but heath formerly 
grew, are now to be seen well cultivated and enclosed fields. Thriv- 
ing plantations are rising up in every direction, beautifying and im- 
proving the face of the country. All the resident proprietors have had 
large additions built to their mansion-houses. The church, school- 
master's house, and parish-school have been rebuilt. Most of the te- 
nants' houses have also been rebuilt, and many of them covered with 
slate roofs. Their manner of living is more comfortable, and a 
change for the better has taken place in their dress. The po- 
pulation is nearly doubled. The number of poor upon the roll was at 
that period, 30, with an income of L. 35. The average aumber. 
al present is 35, with an income for their support of L. 93, 4s 
ijd. ; so that it is pleasing to observe, that they have not increas- 
ed in the same proportion as the population ; whilst their means 
of subsistence are nearly tripled. A new turnpike road has beea 
made through the parish, along which the mail and three other 
coaches daily pass to and from Aberdeen. In former timesj

there was no similar conveyance. The people are more desirous 
of knowledge, and anxious for the education and instruction of 
their children. Upon the whole, they enjoy many blessings and 
advantages, of which their forefathers had not the most distant 
prospect, and it is to be hoped that they duly appreciate and are 
grateful for them.

Antiquities. — About half a mile to the south-east of the church, 
is to be seen the old ruinous castle of Balquhain. In it Queea 
Mary spent a day in her journey to the north, which terminated 
in the battle of Corrichie ; and at which time, it is said she attend- 
ed mass in the church of Chapel. This ancient castle was long the 
seat of the present proprietor, Count Leslie, twenty-third Baron of 
Balquhain. Of this venerable building the only remains are a few 
shattered fragments of the court or quadrangle of which it origin- 
ally consisted, and the noble square tower or keep, which was 
erected about the year 1530, by Sir William Leslie, seventh Ba- 
ron of Balquhain, to replace the more ancient castle, which had 
been burned down in the memorable feud with the Forbeses in 
the year 1526. The walls are six feet thick, and the cement al- 
most as hard as the stone. From it, there is one of the finest 
echoes in Scotland. There is also, at a short distance to the east 
of it, a Druid's circle, which is very entire. 

Modern Buildings. — There are four mansion-houses in the pa- 
rish, viz. Logie Elphinstone, the residence of Sir Robert Dal- 
rymple Horn Elphinstone, Bart. ; Pittodrie, the residence of Co- 
lonel Knight Erskine ; Fetternear, the residence of Count Leslie, 
twenty-third Baron of Balquhain ; and Pitcaple, the residence of 
Hugh Lumsden, Esq. Logie Elphinstone is upon the north, 
and°Pitcaple upon the south bank of the Ury ; Pittodrie is upon an 
elevated situation. 

In the house of Fetternear there is a well known relic of the 
Leslie family, called " John of Blairbowie's chair." This massy 
and gigantic chair excites the admiration and wonder of the dege- 
nerate men of modern times, on acccount of its tremendous strength 
and dimensions. It is of such weight that the strongest man 
could scarcely lift it from the ground ; and derives its name from

It may not be unsuitable here to mention that a club ot gentle- 
men of Aberdeen, the Maryculter Club, who generally pay an 
annual visit for a day or two to some of the more interestmg loca- 
lities of the county, and whose present president 1841 is 1 ho- 
mas Blaikie, Esq." chief magistrate of Aberdeen, selected this pa- 
rish as their rendezvous on the 24th of July of this year, on pur- 
pose to visit the field of Harlaw. Among the party were several 
of the members of the Town- Council ; and the writer of this ac- 
count of the parish had the pleasure of accompanying them over 
the scene of combat, and of pointing out Drum's cairn, Maclean's 
grave, and the other memorials still existing. Thus, after the 
lapse of 430 years, and upon the anniversary day of the battle, a 
Provost of Aberdeen led a body of his townsmen to render upon 
the spot their respects to the memory of his gallant predecessor, 
and the other brave men who had there died in defence of their 
burgh.

PRESBYTERY OF ALFORD, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. WILLIAM MINTY, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

The parish of Kennethmont consists of Kennethmont, strictly 
so called, and the parish of Christ's Kirk, which, at a very remote 
period, had been annexed to it. Of this annexation there is no 
written evidence nor oral tradition ; and both are now comprehend- 
ed in the common name of Kennethmont. 

Name. — The name is said to have been derived from the cir- 
cumstance of one of the Kings Kenneth having been interred in 
the church-yard, which is a small mount. The name is some 

• This opinion was probably taken from a tradition that a grave-stone still to be 
een within the walls of the old church had been originally placed over the reputed 
jrave of the Scottish monarch, which is supposed to have' been at the church-yard 
gate. On inspecting the stone, no information can be derived from the inscriptions

times spelt Kinnethmo7it, derived from two Gaelic words signify, 
ing head and moss ; which, from the natural shape of the emi- 
nence on which the old church is placed, and its proximity to 
mossy ground, is by no means an unlikely derivation of the name. 

Extent, Boundaries, 8fc. — Kennethmont or Kinnethmont is the 
most westerly parish in that fertile district of country known by the 
name of the Garioch. The Bogie, a good trouting stream, sepa- 
rates it from the parish of Rhynie on the west ; the Melshach 
hill in which there is a medicinal spring, long in much repu' 
among the country people, separates it on the north from Gartlyj 
on the east, it is bounded by the parishes of Insch and Leslie 
and on the south, by Clatt. Its shape is almost a regular rectan 
gular oblong, about 6 miles in length from east to west, and 3 i 
breadth from north to south. 

Topographical Appearance. — The surface is much diversified 
by high and low-lying ground ; but, with the exception of two or 
three eminences, the high ground can scarcely be called hilly. 

Climate.— The climate is variable. In consequence, however, 
of the great improvement which has taken place within the last 
thirty years, in draining marshy grounds, and planting the more 
elevated parts of the surface, it is less changeable in general, and 
less severe in winter than formerly. 

II. — Civil History. 
Land-owners.— Theve are four heritors in the parish, viz. Sir An- 
drew Leith Hay of Rannes, who has upwards of one-halfof the valued 
rent ; Mr Gordon of Wardhouse, who has nearly one-third ; His 
Grace the Duke of Richmond, who has rather more than one- 
fifteenth ; and Mr Grant of Druminner, who lately purchased the 
lands of Craighall, the remainder. Sir Andrew Leith Hay is the only 
heritor who, at present, resides in the parish. The late Mr Gordon 
of Wardhouse who died about seven years ago resided about 
twenty years of the latter part of his life at Wardhouse, in this 
parish, and devoted the whole of his time to the improving and 

beautifying of his estate. , t t -fW

was born at Leith-hall, August 9th 1763. He died Governor of the 
Leeward Islands in 1816. His brother, the late General Hay o Kan- 
nes erected a very handsome tablet, with a suitable inscription, to 
his memory in the parish church. Sir Andrew Leith Hay, present 
proprietor 'of the estate of Leith-hall, besides some smaller 
works, published some years ago a very interesting narrative, in 
two volumes, of the Peninsular War, in which he had served. 
He was, for several years. Member of Parliament for the Elgin 
District of Burghs, and Clerk of the Ordnance. Rear-Admiral 
Sir James A. Gordon is also a native of this parish. 

Antiquities.ln regard to antiquities, there is little worthy of 
remark. King Kenneth's reputed grave-stone has been already 
mentioned. The remains of two Druidical temples are still to be seen 
—one on the hill of Airdler, belonging to Sir Andrew Leith Hay; the 
other on the lands of Cults, the property of His Grace the Duke 
of Richmond. A bag of small silver coins, with Alexander L engra- 
ven on one side, was found some years ago in trenching the hill 
called the Cockmuir, belonging to Mr Gordon of Wardhouse. 
The coins might be about the value of 3d. Sterling each.

Many ofthe inhabitants have attained to a great age. In 1835, there 
were fourteen persons in the parish between the age of eighty and 
ninety in a population of little more than 1100. On comparing 
this number with that of those who had attained to a like age in 
1792 when the former Statistical Account was drawn up, it ap- 
pears that now almost three arrive at the age of eighty and up- 
wards, for one who then attained to such an age ; or if allowance 
be made for the difference in number of the population at these 
two periods, more than two for one ; a circumstance which may be 
accounted for, by the improvement in climate, in the dwellings of 
the inhabitants, their mode of living, and general habits of tempe- 
rance and cleanliness. 

Habits of the People. — The habits of the people are, in gene- 
ral, quiet, temperate, and industrious. Heinous crimes are un- 
known among them, and, with the exception of some small of- 
fences, the result generally of drunkenness, which is now fortu-

ABERDEENSHIRE. 



nately becoming every day less frequent, no criminal case has oc- 
curred for many years. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The modern improvements in agriculture are 
now in full operation, not only on the farms in the actual posses- 
sion of the proprietors, but on those also occupied by their tenantry; 
and crops of every description are frequently raised, both as to 
quantity and quality, equal to any in the county. The farms 
with the exception of one upon Sir Andrew Leith Hay's estate 
are not very extensive. They vary from 80 to 100 acres in 
extent. There are twenty occupiers of land qualified in con- 
sequence of their rent being L. 50 and upwards to vote at an 
election for a Member of Parliament. A considerable extent 
of ground is let in small farms under L. 50, and crofts of from two 
to fifteen acres. The greater part of the ground susceptible of cul- 
tivation is now under a regular rotation of cropping. What is com- 
monly called the seven years' shift is the mode of cropping ge- 
nerally adopted.  

Improvements. — Much has been done in the way of improve- 
ment, since the beginning of the present century. Several hundred 
acres of marshy ground have been completely drained, and now 
produce weighty crops ; many acres of moorland, upon which the 
appearance of ridges was still visible, showing that they had at one 
time been cultivated, have again been brought under the plough, 
and a very considerable extent of land has been trenched, parti- 
cularly upon the estate of Wardhouse. The old custom of erect- 
ing folds for young cattle in summer, has now gone into disuse; 
the modern style of farming having rendered the land unfit for 
erecting such fences. The dwellings and mode of living of the 
inhabitants have also kept pace with the improvements in agricul- 
ture. Many of the houses of the farmers are now built of stones 
and lime, instead of turf — and covered with slates instead of straw : 
they have generally one apartment at least floored with wood, and the 
walls and roof neatly cieled and plastered. The more extensive 
farmers use machinery in the thrashing of their grain ; and in har- 
vest, the scythe has universally supplanted the use of the sickle. 
V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town. — There is no market-town in the parish; the 
nearest is that of Huntly, distant about eight miles. The great- 
est part of the grain, however, is taken to Inverury, distant eighteen 
miles, and conveyed to Aberdeen by a canal — the carts in return 



KENNETHMONT. 



587 



i bringing lime and coals ; and as the journey can be accomplished 
I in one day, farmers seldom or ever send their carts with grain or 
 meal to the east or north coast, as formerly. 

Means of Communicatio7i.— The roads were, until lately, bad; but 
a turnpike road, intersecting the parish from east to west, was com- 
pleted about six years ago, which opens up a communication between 
Aberdeen, Huntly,' Inverness, &amp;c. Two public coaches, for some 
time, have run on this line of road, instead of passing by the turn- 
pike road through the hills of Foudland, as formerly, although the 
distance be about three miles greater. The Kennethmont line of 
. road is, however, so much more level and easy than the other al- 
luded to, that time is rather gained than lost by travellers coming 
in this direction ; besides, as an inducement for travellers to take 
- the Kennethmont hne of road, they pass through a fine, rich, ro- 
mantic valley ; by the other, they have, for many miles, nothing but 
barren and bleak hills. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church, since the annexation, 
is not very centrically situated. A new one was built in 1812, 
capable of holding about 600. It is neat and commodious. The 
parishioners are, in general, regular in their attendance upon reli- 
gious ordinances, notwithstanding the distance of four or five miles 
which some of them have to travel. They all belong to the Es- 
tablished Church, with the exception of a few families who attend 
a Congregational meeting-house in a neighbouring parish. 

The manse was built in 1794, and has lately been repaired. 
The glebe consists of 12 acres of tolerably good land. The sti- 
pend at present is 4 chalders of victual, and L. 137, 14s. in 
money, including allowance for communion elements. 

Education. — Although the parish school is so situated as to be 
almost inaccessible, from its distance, to many of the young, yet 
their parents have, at their own expense, for some years supported 
two private schools in those parts of the parish most distant 
from the parochial school ; which now enables every child to be- 
come early acquainted along with other useful knowledge, with 
that knowledge which maketh wise unto salvation ; so that it is 
very rare, indeed, to find a child eight or nine years of age, that 
cannot pretty distinctly read the Bible, and repeat the Assembly's 
Shorter Catechism. The emoluments of the parochial teacher 
may average about L.35 per annum, exclusive of what may be re- 
ceived from the Dick Bequest. Those of the other teachers are 
from L.IO to L.15.

ABEIIDEENSIIIIIE, 



Library. — Tliere is a small circulating library in the parish, 
principally composed of religious and historical publications. It 
was established some years ago. Small additions are made to it 
from the annual subscriptions. It has already been productive of 
some good effects, giving the people a taste for reading, and 
tending to check the habit of wandering from house to house, a 
custom very common in the winter evenings. • 

Savings Bank. — A Savings Bank was instituted about eight 
years ago, which, considering the decrease of wages, and the low 
rate of interest, has succeeded far beyond the most sanguine ex- 
pectations of its originators. It is managed by a President and 
twelve Directors; — who have authority to hold four meetings an- 
nually, and two extra meetings, if necessary. About L.IOOO are 
already lodged. 

Poor. — The funds of the parish for behoof of the poor 
amount to about L. 200. The average number of persons re- 
ceiving parochial aid varies from 16 to 20. The weekly collec- 
tions average about 7s., from which, along with the interest of 
capital, and what arises from other sources, nearly L.40 are dis- 
tributed annually. The highly commendable feeling of independ- 
ence is still prevalent here ; and it is a rare occurrence for any ta 
ask assistance from the parish funds, unless in cases of actual ne- 
cessity. 

Thepopulation are, almost, exclusively, agricultural in their pur- 
suits. About twenty years ago, many of the female sex derived a 
livelihood from the knitting of stockings for the foreign market. 
This species of manufacture is now almost given up, unless in the 
case of a few of the more aged, who, with the greatest diligence, 
are unable to earn the small pittance of Is. per week. 

Pairs. — There are three annual fairs held in the parish for 
the sale of cattle, &amp;c., the first in the month of April, the 
second in the month of July, and the third in the month of 
October. A market was once held at Christ's Church, in the 
east end of the parish, during night, in the month of May, and 
which place is said to have been the scene of the celebrated 
ballad of Christ's Kirk on the Green, composed by James I. : but 
this market has been long ago given up. There are still the re- 
mains of a church and church-yard or burying-ground ',to be seen 
at this place, but very few are now interred there. 

Puel.— Feats are still generally used for fuel ; but, as the mos- 
ses are considerably exhausted, and no small difficulty and expense 
incurred in obtaining peat fuel, coals are coming daily more into

use; and, were it not that the people in tlie country are as yet un- 
acquainted with the proper method of using coalg economically, 
there is little doubt they would be preferred by them to peats, 
beincr upon the whole almost as cheap,— and, moreover, the time 
which is spent in preparing peat-fuel might be more profitably em- 
ployed in agricultural and other operations.

PRESBYTERY OF ELLON, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. JAMES RUST, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
All my endeavours to ascertain the era at which the parish of 
Forvie was annexed to that of Skins have entirely failed. 

Extent, Sfc. — The extreme length of the parish is somewhat 
more than 6 miles, breadth about Sh, and it is of a triangular 
shape. It is bounded on the west south-west by the river Ythan, 
which divides it from Foveran ; on the north-west, by the rivulet 
called Forvie burn, which separates it from Logie Buchan ; on the 
east north-east, by the parish of Cruden ; and on the south-east, 
by the northern ocean. 

The surface of the parish is remarkably varied, and beautifully 
undulating. 

The rocky part of the coast abounds with caves, the most re- 
markable of which is the Dropping Cave, or White Cave of 
Slains. It would seem that, in former times, it was an object of 
deep interest to the curious, and it is still so considered. There 
are several other caves in which, as well as in the Dropping Cave, 
fine specimens of petrifaction are to be found ; but their chief ce- 
lebrity arose from their having afforded excellent places of conceal- 
ment for contraband goods in the " high and palmy state" of 
smuggling, which was carried on here to an almost incredible ex- 
tent. One of these caves, called Hell-lum, is upwards of 200 feet 
in length, and the pitch of the arch within, in some places, rises 
to the height of thirty feet. 

" There is one fissure of about thirty yards in length, four feet 

• Drawn up by the late incumbent, the Rev. Gavin Dunn.

in width, and from twenty to thirty in heighth, called the NeedleV 
eye, through which the sea, in an easterly gale, rushes with impe- 
tuous violence. This fissure perforates a round bluff hill of solid 
rock, which is covered with a layer of earth to the depth of several 
feet, and its sides are smooth and polished with the action of the 



waves. 



The extent of coast is somewhat upwards of six miles, the 
greatest part rocky, the remainder of a fine soft sand. The rocks 
rise to an elevation of from 170 to 200 feet above the level of 
the sea, and are bold and precipitous, forming innumerable little 
bays and creeks. In some places, they are riven asunder and piled 
on one another in terrible confusion, ever and anon yawning with 
deep and ghastly chasms. Many of these little bays, if they may 
be called so, are thickly studded with bare rocks, some rising to a 
great height in naked magnificence, while others heave their huge 
and horrid ridges just above the surface of the water. 

Climate.— lJ\on the whole, there is scarcely any perceptible va- 
riation of the climate over the extent of the parish ; and it may be 
characterized as damper and colder, and in every respect less ge- 
nial than in some of the inland parts of the county. 

One of the most painful and agonizing diseases that can afiBict 
humanity carries off its yearly victims from amongst us, and has 
not once left the parish these many years. This fatal and almost 
incurable malady is the stone, which chiefly prevails among the 
aged fishermen ; and there are four men upwards of sixty years at 
present labouring under its tortures. Some attribute this disease 
to the quality of the spring-water, which is very hard, and after 
long standing, deposits a little limy sediment ; others to the beer 
which they drink, a beverage they are particularly fond of, when 
they return from fishing ; and others, again, to the cold and raw 
nights to which their profession exposes them on the bosom of the 
deep. In the autumn of 1832, this parish was afflicted with Asiatic 
cholera, which here assumed all its most appalling and frightful 
symptoms. It was imported from Leith in one of the fishermens 
boats, and soon spread over the village with its characteristic rapi- 
dity and mortality. In the short space of six weeks, in a popula- 
tion of little more than 350 souls, it swept off no less than 23. 
Its ravages, however, were entirely confined to the fishmg-town of 
CoUiston. 

Hydrography.— AW along the coast, there are many and copious 
springs of the purest, coolest, and most delicious water. Ihese 



SLAINS. 



591 



■ sprintrs are generally found along the rocky part of the coast, at 
the base of high and steep braes covered with verdure, from under 

, which they rush out in a stream as abundant as a rivulet, and m 
quantity sufficient to turn an ordinary mill. There are a few cha- 
lybeate springs, the strongest of which is found near the old kxvk 

, of Forvie ; but their medicinal qualities have never been sufficient- 
ly tested so as to gain them any repute. 

There are three lakes in the parish, and one of these, called the 

i Muckle Loch of Slains, is really a magnificent sheet of water, co- 

, yet\ny, in the depth of winter, a basin of from seventy to seventy- 
three°acres in extent. It is surrounded on three sides by a ridge 
of land, Kippet hills, rising, by an easy acclivity, to the height 
of from fifty to sixty feet above the level of its surface. Its mean 
depth may be about twenty feet ; but, in one place, it has been 
ascertained to be fifty-two. The only outlet from it is by a small 
stream at the south end, which has been converted into a dam, to 
drive a meal- mill about a mile below. The other two lochs, called 
Cot-hill and Sand-loch, have evidently been formed by the drift- 
ing of the sands from Forvie, and each covers a space of about 
fifteen acres. The only river is the Ythan, formerly mentioned 
as forming one of the boundaries of the parish. 

Geology and Mineraloff 7/. — The rocks along the coast consist of 
gneiss and mica-slate, alternating with, here and there, thin seams 
of quartz, and their direction is from north-east to south-west, and 
their dip north-east. The small eminences, already alluded to as 
intersecting the parish, called the Kippet hills, are composed of 
gravel, mixed with smooth and polished limestones, generally from 
one to sixteen pounds, and few of them exceed the latter weight. 
Formerly they were carefully picked and burned for lime by the 
farmers, which produced most excellent crops. This species of 
manufacture has now long been given up, as English lime may be 
had at greatly less trouble and expense. The burning of these 
stones must have been carried on to a very considerable extent, as 
many excavations along the whole line of the ridge are still very 
obvious, though now covered with grass. The organic remains 
found in these limestones, are mussels and other shells. Though 
occasional blocks of granite are to be found in some districts, yet 
there are no rocks formed of it ; but so soon as the boundary to 
the north-east of the parish is crossed, the gneiss and mica-slate 
disappear, and graduate into red granite. This parish abounds 
with a kind of calcareous sand, which was long extensively used as

n manure, and is still profitably employed on newly reclaimed land. 
It is of a very hot nature, and must be used with much caution. 
Many vestiges of its injudicious application are to be seen on dif- 
ferent farms, where it has been laid on in such quantities as to 
have burned up the soil, and rendered it incapable of bearing a 
crop. Fortunately, however, the scorched places are only in small 
patches, here and there,— the surrounding land having had strength 
enough to resist its influence. This sand varies in colour and size. 
It is chiefly of a grayish hue, and from the diff'erent strata visible 
throughout, it is evidently of marine production, as the strata con- 
sist of pulverized shells. Every kind of soil, from the heaviest clay 
to the lightest sand, is to be found here, but the chief character is 
clay. There is a tract of land, at the average breadth of a mile, 
extending across almost the whole of the parish, of a deep loamy 
soil, and most superior description, and, but for the climate, it 
would vie with the most fertile parts of Scotland. This lies on the 
estate of Colonel J. Gordon of Cluny Castle. 

Zooloffij.—The Ythan produces salmon, grilse, salmon trout, 
burn-trout, eels, flat-fish of several descriptions, and also cole-fish, 
sand-eels, and herring-fry, which latter, in some months of sum- 
mer, are caught in great abundance. In an economical point of 
view, the mussels found in this river are of the greatest importance, 
supplying bait not only to CoUiston, but many other fishing vil- 
lages on the east coast of Scotland. The rent for these was once 
L 500 per annum, but is now reduced to L.300. This reduction 
is owing to the great floods, of late years, washing away the beds, 
and rendering the mussels so scarce as to do little more than sup- 
ply the fishing villages in the neighbourhood, while formerly they 
were transported along the whole line of the east coast. This 
river especially in the winter season, opens a wide and mteresting 
field'to the student of ornithology. It is frequented by a greater 
variety of birds than most rivers in Great Britain. 

Trees Sc —There is not a single tree in the whole bounds, ex- 
cept on the estate of Leask, belonging to Mr Gordon of Parkhill, 
and these are by no means large or of a thriving appearance. I 
planted a few forest trees, such as birch and mountam-ash, in the 
garden, about ten years ago. The birch has gradually withered 
- away, while the mountain-ash is very little thicker and no h.ghe. 
than when planted. The cultivation of gooseberries has also 
completely failed, though tried on the sunniest and most she tered 
spot in the garden ; and, after an experiment of twelve yeais, the 



SLAINS. .yg 



bushes are now dug up, having, in the most favourable seasons 
produced not more than two or three pints of fruit, and these never 
fully ripened. Buckthorn or marine-thorn has been successfully 
introduced, and, with the exception of the elder, tiirives greatly 
better than any other shrub the writer ever planted. Under skil- 
ful management, hedges might be formed of it, which, though they 
could never prove a proper fence, would serve to beautffy this 
naked and bare district. 

II. — Civil History. 
Land.owners.~There are only two land-owners,-Colonel Gor- 
don of Cluny,-and Mr Gordon of Parkhill, whose property of 
Leask amounts to nearly one-fifth valuation of the whole parish. 
JNeither of the proprietors reside on their estates here 

Parochial Reffisters.-The parochial register extends back onlv 
o the year 1722, and has not been very regularly kept, owin. to 
the neglect of parents to register. 

Antiguities.--The foundation of the old kirk of Forvie is still 
visible, being the only vestige throughout the whole sands com- 
rnon y „ d the Links, which indicates that this district w onl

against any opposing force. In the year 1594, the Earl of Errol

some masses of masonry strewed around it. . , „ .

have united in producing a new and improved system of rearing

been greatly turned to that profitable branch of industry, which 
has certainly attained to a wonderful degree of perfection. Total

The principal variation in the state of the parish since the 
date of the last Account, is the vast and rapid improvement 
of the system of husbandry. At that period, old men affirm, 
that it was no uncommon thing to see a plough drawn by six 
horses, or by twelve oxen, and the work performed did not much 
exceed in extent what is now done by a pair of either animals, 
while the execution is inconceivably superior. The improvement 
of the miplements of husbandry and breed of horses which has 
been mtroduced, has thus greatly lessened the expense of farmino- 
operations; as one man with his pair of horses will do even more 
work than could formerly be executed by two men and a dozen of 
oxen, with their clumsy and cumbrous implements. Another im- 
portant improvement since the year 1791, is the vast superiority 
of the breed of cattle, the system of rearing and feeding, .nd the 
great extent to which it is now carried on. The breadth of land 
under turnip cultivation is inconceivably greater than it was; 
while the quality of the root itself is of a much better description, 
as he growers have long devoted their most scrupulous attention 
to the improvement of the seed. Each man raises his own seed, 
and caref ully selects the best of each sort to plant out. The prin 
c.pa kinds are the green top and yellow bottom, red top and yel- 
low bottom a few tankard, and a considerable portion ofruta-baga, 
chiefly for feeding, ni May and June. It is much to be desired

have elapsed ere such a large district of country could have been

PRESBYTERY OF TURRIFF, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. JAMES CORDINER, MINISTER. 



I. Topography and Natural History. 

7ta,„e._THE ancient name of the parish seems to have been 
Forrig, as appears from an inscription on two old communion cups 
the mouths of which are of beaten silver, and the pillars of which 
are tastefully ornamented with the leaves and tendrils of the vine. 
The name of the parish is believed to be Gaelic. 

Boundaries, c— Forgue is bounded on the south by Insch and 
Culsalmond ; on the east, by Inverkeithnie and Auchterless ; on 
the north, by Rothiemay ; and on the west, by Drumblade and 
Huntly. The boundaries are irregular. The greatest length 
from north to south,— that is, from the Ury to the Deveron,-is 
about nine miles and a-half or ten miles, and the greatest breadth 
from east to west may be about six and a half miles. 

Topographical Appearances.— The surface of the parish is un-

dulatitig, now rising into heights and knolls, now sinking into 
straths and holms. The plantations are tasteful, judicious, and 
extensive, covering a considerable part of the parish. The sce- 
nery on the whole is varied and beautiful, if we except the bleak, 
flat, cold, and uninteresting hills of Foudland, which furnish the 
parishioners with peats and turf for firing, either in part or in whole, 
according to circumstances. These hills rise from Ury, at the 
south extremity of the parish, but to no great height, are covered, 
generally, with a short stunted heath, and breed a few covies of 
grouse for the sportsmen. There is no other eminence in the pa- 
rish that deserves the name of a hill, if we except the Foreman, 
which rises from the Deveron, at the northern extremity of the 
parish, to the height of 1000 feet. This is a beautiful hill, some- 
what of a conical shape, finely wooded for a good way up its sides, 
and affords from its top an extensive and varied prospect. It is 
said to have got the name Foreman, or Fourraan, from the circum- 
stance, that the four neighbouring heritors, who divided the hill 
between them, could confer together on the top, or apex of the 
cone, each sitting on his own ground. The unfortunate Queen 
Mary, in her journey to the north, passed over this hill on her way 
to Roth.emay House, by what goes still by the name of the 
Queen s road. 

Meteorology.-Yvom th inland situation of the parish, being 
about fourteen miles from the nearest sea, the comparative absence 
of marshy ground, the great extent of dry and well-cultivated land, 
the many springs and pure rills of water, the shelter and fragrance 
of the numerous plantations, and other circumstances, the air is

abound in trout; and some of them have their edges in some 
places beautifully fringed with alder. Besides a vast number of 
common springs, we have in different places mineral or chalybeate 



ones. 



Geology and Miner alogy.-'ne minerals common m the neigh- 
bouring parishes may be found in this. At Pitfancy hmestone 
was formerly quarried in considerable quantity, as, at I.ambhiU, 
was likewise slate. The quarrying at both places has however, 
been given up. The soils are various,-sandy, gravelly, clayey, 
loamy, and mossy; some rich and grateful, some poor and bar- 
ren; some yielding eight, or even ten returns of the seed sown, 
and some no more than two or two and a half. 

II. — Civil History. 
The early history of the parish is involved, like that of most 
parishes, in darkness ; and tradition speaks of it as remarkable for 
nothing so much as the almost perpetual and desperate feud be- 
tween the Crichton family and the family of Gordon. 

Eminent Me«.-This parish claims to be the birth-place of the 
famous James Crichton, who, about the middle of the sixteenth 
century, made such a conspicuous figure in the world, fron. his 
surpassing genius and learning, his bodily feats and mental ac- 
quiremeifts,'that he obtained the ppellafon of the Admirable 
Crichton. A parish in Perthshire, however, domes to this the 
honour of his birth ; non nostrum tantas componere htes. Mr 
Morison, the famous hygeist, was a native of this -fZ 
Dr Abercrombie, the present eminent physician in Ed.nbuigh, 
is connected with it, his father having been for some time m.nis-

about L.2500 Sterling. That was about the year 1796. It has 
tripled since that period. 

Parochial iej/iifers.— The oldest register extends back to 1637. 
There is a register of discipline, one of baptisms, and one of mar- 
riages ; they are in a tolerable state of preservation, and appear 
to have been regularly kept. 

Antiquities. — There are the remains of several Druidical tem- 
ples in the parish. On the Seedhill of Auchaber, there is what is 
conjectured to be the remains of a redoubt of the Romans. It is 
about a mile or so distant from their camp, near Glenmellan, now 
- Glenythan, is of a circular form, with a diameter of about sixty feet, 
and from it, the great Roman road is thought to have passed to the 
Spey, through Forgue, Rothiemay, and the intervening parishes. 

A small part of the ruins of the old castle of Frendraught is still 
to be seen, and on the green before it are some beech trees of 
great bulk and beauty, said to have been planted by the Crichton 
femily. The old tower of the ancient castle was burnt down in 
October 1630; and in it perished the Viscount of Aboyne, the 
eldest son of the Marquis of Huntly, and four others. The fire 
broke out m the night-time suddenly, and with unquenchable fury, 

was never clearly ascertained, 
bpaldmg whose account, however, must be taken wi"th considera- 
bJe quahhcation, reports the calamity. 

Modem Buildings.-UMo, the seat of Mr Duff, is a very pret- 
ty place, with an excellent mansion-house, well laid out pleasure- 
grounds, and a well-stocked garden. Cobairdy, the seat of Mr 
bimpson from its fine south exposure, well-fenced fields, and 
ample plantations, is a charming residence. Corse gives proof of 
the care and good taste of its proprietor, Mr Henry. Drumblair, 
Templeland, Auchaber, and Boyne's mill, the seats of the othei' 
esident proprietors, have each its claims. Frendraught, however,

The rapid increase may, in part, be attributed lo the reclain:ing 
of much waste moorish ground and letting it in crofts to the poor- 
est class of the people. There is no town, and, properly speaking, 
not a village even in the parish.

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture.— The number of acres which are cultivated, or oc- 
casionally under tillage, may amount, perhaps, to 9000 or 10,000, 
and to these many more may still be added, as there remams much 
■ of hill and moor to be reclaimed. Some of the ground rents at 
L.2 an acre; some at L.l ; some is worth 5s ; and some so poor 
and worthless as not to be worth any rent at all. When let in small 
crofts, the best of the land rents at L.3 per acre. The average rent 
of the acre may be about Us. 

The leases are in general for nineteen years. 
Husbandry.-Gret improvement has of late taken place in all 
the departments of husbandry, but particularly m rearing of stock 
Crosses, especially from the pure Aberdeenshire and the short 
horns, turn out well. The course of cropping should be regulated 
b th nature of the soil, but generally the five-course shift or 1 
seven seems to be preferred by the farmer. Mr Walker, a land- 
surveyor, and valuator of great skill and experience, recornmends 
fo St ong and heavy clay land, a six-course shift, namely, 1. grass , 
2 oats; a beans or pease; 4. wheat; 5. fallow or green crop; 
6 baH y, with grassieeds ; for a heavy loam or alluvial sod the 
Lr- om-se shil, namely, 1. grass; 2. oats ; 3. turnips; 4. bar- 
ev • and, where the climate is favourable, beans or wheat may be 
n r'oductd ; and, for a light loam, comprehending the old infield 
'l. recomniends ; six-shift course, namely, three yea- - g- , 
one grain crop after breaking up; then turnips, to be paiteaten 
off by sheep and, lastly, barley or oats, to be  jn v h 

grass-seeds. The writer of this report believes the case pract 



FORGUE. gQ3 

cally to be, that no single farm, much less any large estate in this 
part of the country, will suit, as a whole, any of the courses re- 
commended. The skill and experience of the farmer must regu- 
late the management of the farm, according to the nature of its 
various soils. With regard to some fields, a four-course shift mav 
be advantageously adopted ; with regard to others, a five or six, or 
a seven may be suitable; and, with regard to some, no particular 
course can profitably be followed, from the extreme poverty and 
backwardness of the soil. He believes, farther, that, to fetter 
the judicious and experienced farmer in the discretionary ma- 
nagement of his farm, by binding him down to the observance of 
—as to many of his fields,— ill adapted and arbitrary rules is 
as unwise as it is illiberal. It is right that the proprietor should 
guard against the wasting of the farm by overcropping; it is riaht 
that he should secure that, at the end of the lease, it should ''be 
found in a particular state. But it is not right that he should in- 

tlr ['"'f ""'""t °f the farmer, and insist 

tht every field that he possesses shall bear a specified crop at a 
specified time. It is right that he should take care that the fields 
once a,d down .n grass, should continue in grass, at least for J 
pecified period say two or three years ; but it is not right that 
the tenant should be obliged, if he shall see good cause for the 
contrary, to break up his grass-fields at the end of that pe i f 
The fact IS, that, on most farms, the writer believes, there is too 
n.uch arable ground. More has been brought under the plour

v.— Pauochial Economy. 
Market-Town.— The nearest market-town is Huntly, which is 
about seven miles from the parish church We have two turn- 
pike roads in the parish,-the one passing from Huntly to Banft, 
the other from Huntly to Aberdeen. On this latter road, a public 
coach has, for some time, been running. The other roads are not 
good, especially in winter, though, on the whole, by means of these 
two turnpikes and otherwise, the parish is not ill accommodated as 
to roads for the conveyance of the farm produce to the principal 

market-towns. ., . ii ' 

Ecclesiastical State.-The church was built in 1819 on a small 
eminence, which forms the church-yard, gradually sloping to the 
south. It is a substantial, chaste, and well-proportioned building 
with Gothic windows ; seated for 900, and will hold nearly 200 
more. And, as the external appearance of the church is in excel- 
lent taste, so the internal arrangements are very complete i he 
light is abundant, and the lofty roof is tastefully painted.T.n 
interior is in the form of an oblong, with the pulpit standing in tl.e 
niddle of one of the short sides, namely, the gable, and finely sloped 
Lleries running along the other three sides. As a whole the church 
TZne give: proof not only of the good taste and liberality of 
the hefitorsl but also of their desire that the best possib e accommo- 
dation should be afforded to their people when engaged in religious 
trship. The sittings are free. The manse is handsome, la 
and commodious. It was repaired and enlarged n 1830 Ihe 
Ibe may extend to about twelve acres or so, and is worth abou 
L 18 yea ly. The stipend is now 16 chalders, half meal and half 
bX c Irted at the highest fiar prices, with L.IO for commu- 
nion money. There is a preaching station, in connection with he

quarter of a mile from the church. In 171.5, the parish minister, 
who was very popular and much esteemed by the people, was de- 
posed by the General Assembly for the part he took in favour of 
the Pretender. This gave great offence to the parishioners, and 
induced many of them to leave the church and join the Episcopa- 
lians. Hence Forgue has long been a stronghold of Episcopacy. 
The connection, however, it would appear, is not gaining ground, 
as, at the time of the last Statistical report, according to Mr Ding- 
wall, the Episcopalians amounted, within the parish, to 220, 
whereas they now amount to about 180. 

There is no Catholic chapel in the parish, and only three or 
four individuals of that persuasion in it. The other Dissenters 
may amount to about 40. The number of families in connection 
with the Church is about 464 ; do. of persons, about 2200. The 
average number of communicants for the last six years is about 
920. 146 families are within two miles of the church ; 212 fami- 
lies are more than four miles ; 64 families are more than six miles; 
and 92 families or so are still farther, distant,— some upwards of 
eight miles. The above statistics are given from my own census 
taken in 1835. 

Ecclesiastical Hisiori/.— Stipend at different times: Previous 
to 1731, the stipend was 800 merks Scots in victual and money, 
with L.20 Scots in addition for communion elements. It appears 
by the presbytery record, that, in 1731, an augmentation of 100 
merks Scots of stipend, and 20 merks Scots of element-monev 
was given unanimously by the heritors, which was paid partly in 
money and partly in victual. The victual consisted of 44 bolls of 
meal, and 20 bolls of bear, and was valued, as it had been by the 
Commissioners of Tithes both in 1617 and 1633, at 100 merks per 
chalder, or about 6s. 8d. Sterling per boll. Hence it would ap- 
pear that the price of victual had continued stationary from 1617 
to 1731, a period of 114 years. The stipend and element-money 
was by this augmentation made up to 950 merks Scots, and was 
paid from the great teinds parsonage, and the small vicarage 
m the fol owmg proportions, namely, 550 merks from the great,' 
and 400 from the small, or vicarage-teinds. This shows the re' 

TthJ 1 P""'"""" '' vicarage-teinds to have been 
at that penod, as 550 to 400, or exactly as 5i to 4. It shows 

n.entaLns river rrJl''irH '''' " ''" 

' 'y 10s. paid by the parsonage, L.4 ouo-ju 



COG ABERDEENSniRK. 

to be paid by the vicarage-teinds. Now, it so happens, in this 
parish, that one of the heritors guarantees several of the others 
against all future augmentations of stipend ; but so far only as the 
great or parsonage-teinds are concerned ; hence, m the event ot 
an augmentation being granted, as affects these heritors, say to 
the amount of L.9, 10s., if the above data be correct, it would 
come thus to be divided ; the guaranteer would have to pay L.5, 
10s., and the guaranteed L.4 of the said augmentation. 

There seems to have been no farther augmentation for upwards 
of the next sixty years, as the writer of the former Statistical Ac- 
count, about 1796, states the stipend then to be 44 bolls of rnea , 
20 bolls of bear, 500 merks Scots of money, together with 50 
merks Scots for communion elements. 

A year or two afterwards, the stipend was augmented to 5'2 bolls 
of meal, 20 bolls of bear, L.58, Is. Hd., Sterling, of money sti- 
pend, and for element money, L.2, 15s. Od. Sterling. 

In 1803, it would appear the stipend was again augmented to 
68 bolls of meal, 28 bolls of bear, and L.52, 10s. Sterling of 
money, together with L.8,6s.8d. Sterling, for communion elements. 

In 1819, the stipend was raised to 14 chalders, half meal and 
half barley, with L.8, 6s. 8d. for element money. , . _ 

In 1840, 25th November, the stipend was augmented to lb 
chalders, half meal and half barley, with L.IO for element money. 

Ministers.-The first Presbyterian minister that we hear o at 
Forgue was the Rev. John Maitland. He succeeded the last 
Episcopal clergyman, Mr Hastie, and, as appears from the record 
of presbytery, was translated from Insch by order of the synod 
ald'setUed a't Forgue, on the 22d of May 1707. This reverend

FORGUE. - COT 

gentleman and his brother James, the minister of the neighbouring 
parish of Inverkeithnie, were both deposed by the General As- 
sembly in a summary manner, on the 9th May 1715. The cause 
of their deposition was that they failed in their observance of a 
thanksgiving, appointed by both civil and ecclesiastical authority, 
to be observed on the 'iOth of January 1715, for the peaceable 
accession of George I. to the throne. 

In both parishes, the great bulk of the inhabitants espoused the 
causeof their ministers, and matters proceeded so far, that, as it had 
been impossible, formerly, for the members appointed by the sy- 
nod, to intimate the sentence of suspension, on account of the vio- 
lence of the people of these congregations, so the members, lately 
appointed by the Assembly to intimate their sentence of deposi- 
tion, were prevented by main force, not only from entering the 
churches, but even the church-yards of those parishes. On both 
occasions, the ministers sent were roughly handled, assailed by an 
enraged and furious mob, and obliged to make a hasty retreat 
without executing the orders of their superiors. Nor was it only 
on these two occasions that the turbulent spirit of the people ma- 
nifested itself,— these parishes were in a complete ferment for 
years afterwards. In the meantime, the Messrs Maitland, now that 
they were rejected by Presbytery, united themselves to Episco- 
pacy, and opened meeting-houses for their numerous friends and 
followers in both Forgue and Inverkeithnie. In this piece of out-

presbytery exerted itself zealously to supply the vacancies, but ex- 
erted itself in vain, for the people were generally hostile ; and the 
Viscountess of Frendraught had possessed herself of the keys of 
both churches. These she kept for several months, and was in- 
duced, at last, to give them up— not so much from the persuasion 
of the'presbytery, as the dread of a threatened civil action. When 
access to these churches was again obtained, and the People had 
somewhat cooled in their resentment, supplies were furnished by 
the presbytery, and matters were beginning to wear a more peace- 
able appearance. But, alas  a new circumstance arose to rekin- 
die into a flame the dying spark of discord. It was necessary that 
ministers should be settled at both Forgue and Inverke.thnie, and 
as the vacancy at both had been now upwards of a twelremonth, 
it was proper 'to proceed to the settlement of those parishes with- 
out loss of time. The right of presentation had now, in both 
cases, devolved on the presbytery ; it was claimed by the patron 
Mr Morrison of Bognie, son of the Viscountess of Frendraught 
The presbytery, after sounding the inclinations of the people, and 
such of the heritors as were favourable to an immediate settle- 
xnent, issued a presbyterial and general call in favour of the Rev. 
Alexander Forbes, to be minister of Forgue, because he was pre- 
ferred by the people of that parish ; as they did, a little after- 
wa ds and for the same reason, issue another, in favour of the 
Rev James Stuart, minister of Orde.uhill, to be minister at In- 
verkeithnie. The presbytery commenced with the case o For 
.ue and took the usual steps towards the settlement of Mr For- 
bes They were opposed in these steps by the patron who by his 
mandatory protested and appealed to the synod. The presby-

ber I7I6. Both were promised, but neither was forthcoming so 
the presbytery had to proceed without escort to the church' of 
Forgue. Nor were they the only party that was prepared for the 
settlement; the people were equally prepared. They met the 
presbytery at the church-yard in a crowded body, bent on violence 
and outrage; commenced a furious attack upon them with stones 
and staves, obliged them hastily to retire, and literally chaced 
them beyond the bounds of the parish. They then returned to 
their homes m triumph, in the fond belief that they had prevent- 
ed the settlement. The presbytery, however, was not to be thus 
baffled : they proceeded to the church of Auchterless, a distance 
of nme miles, and there effected the settlement of Mr Forbes 
The settlement was scarcely over, and the brethren met in presby- 
tery when a presentation was lodged, by James Spence, in Pen-

I Topography and Natural History. 
Aam..-THE name of the parish is said to be derived from 
a term m the Gaelic language, indicating its northern exposure 

b'""ch, of which the present name may be a corruption. 

E:cient Boundaries, Sc.-The parish occupies the northern and 
western skirts of the range of hills called Corrennie, or h Red 
H 11, where it descends into the vale of Alford, and is of a very irre 
gular figure. Its length, from the south-wesl to the noJth "a l" 
from 5 to 6 miles ; its breadth, which at one place is more than t ' 
anot er place, where it is nearly cut across' by the p ish "f Le 
ochel, ,s scarcely half a mile ; and its square slface m y be estl" 
rnated at about 10 miles. It marches on the north Zl thet

to find every thing frozen over in these low grounds, while in high 
and exposed situations on the hill no ice is to be seen. In spring, 
again, the reverse of this is the case. 

Geo/.— The prevailing rocks are red granite and mica-slate, 
and, where the latter rock is laid bare by the courses of the various 
burns, it is seen to be everywhere penetrated by granitic veins. 
On the hill above Whitehouse, some huge masses jut out, of a 
nature approaching to quartz rock. Near TiUyfour, a magnesian 
limestone occurs; and, in one or two situations, a primary trap 
appears. The eastern side of the parish is traversed by a re- 
markable dike of claystone porphyry, of great hardnes, and of a 
reddish colour ; it runs pretty continuously, for several miles, in 
a direction nearly north and south ; and, it is said, that dikes of 
the same material, and in a direction corresponding with this one, 
may be traced, crossing the country from the mountain of Ben- 
nochie, to that of Clochnaben. Boulders of two or three feet in 
diameter, and sometimes of much greater size, of red and blue 
granite, of gneiss and mica-slate, of claystone and felspar porphyry, 
the latter extremely beautiful, are scattered over the sur ace, 
and mingled with the soil and subsoil in many places very abun- 
dantly, furnishing a ready and excellent building stone. It is per- 
haps worthy of remark, that those consisting of blue granite often 
contain veins of the red variety, and nodules of mica slate ; while, 
in the boulders of red granite, no foreign material is almost ever 
to be observed, and some of the outlying blocks of this material 
from the hill have been polished into slabs and pillars of the great- 
est beauty. In some situations, the red granite exists in beds 
in such a disintegrated state, as to be dug out with the help of 
the pick-axe, as a material for road-making. 

Hi.h up the hill, by the side of a little waterfall, there is a 
very Strong chalybeate spring. The supply of vater is abundan 
To' the tfste, I certainly appears as strong as the ..11-known 
Pananich water; and those who have used both, say that its ef- 
fects are by no means inferior. , , . i , 

Throughout the parish, generally, there is an abundant supply 
of pure and excellent spring-water.

Parochial Registers.— There are entries in the parochial register 

as far back as 1706, but it has since been very irregularly kept 

Antiquities.— There are several of those remainsknown by the 
title of Druidical circles, in the parish, and among the hills ad- 
joining It, and generally, where one of these is found, others of 
smaller size are to be met with, in its close vicinity. The largest 
of these lies in a very sequestered situation, and is called the Auld 
Kirk of Tough does this designation in any degree confirm the 
opinion that the original purpose of these moss-grown remains 
was a religious one . It is surrounded by numerous small tumuli, 
which suggest the idea of a burying-ground connected with the 
place of worship. There is one on a smaller scale, but more 

t2TrM'"""'''T Z'""  this parish 

from that of Monymusk. The tumuli around it are without num- 
ber ; and the remains of ancient walls or causeways may be traced 
among , he eather, running out from the principal circle, and 
connecting ,t w.th several lesser ones. Altogether, it seems to 
deserve the inspection of an antiquarian. At Tullo hvenus n . 
small cairn opened a few months ago, there was found an urn eon-

The late James Byres, Esq. of Tonley, by whom these and 
many other articles of curiosity were brought together, and who 
died here at a very advanced age in 1817, was a gentleman highly 
distinguished for his profound knowledge of architectural antiqui- 
ties, and the fine arts in general, and no less respected for his 
sterUng worth, by those who were unable to estimate these ac- 
quirements. A great part of his life was spent at Rome, where 
he gave lectures, at one period, on the favourite objects of his 
study ; and Sir James Hall, who has occasion, in his work on 
Gothic architecture, frequently to refer to his authority, bears 
testimony, as well as many other writers, to « the very great success 
with which he contributed to form the taste of his young country- 
men " A curious and valuable work of his, on the Sepulchres ot 
Etruria, is likely soon to be given to the public, which will show 
that he had anticipated, by half a century, many of the recent in- 
vestigations of these monuments of antiquity. 

111. — Population.

Of unmarrS men above 50 th; numbers'are, bachelors, 2 ; widowers, 15. 
Of women above 45, there are 33 maids, and 27 widows. 

This increase of the population is owing to the extended and 
improved cultivation, and to the encouragement that has been 
given to small crofters on the estate of the principal proprietor. 
There is no village, nor any manufacturing establishment. 

The number of insane or fatuous persons is 3.

present before the Court of Session. There are in the parish 
1097 acres of planted wood, covering most of the eminences. 
Some of the plantations are of only a few years growth, and are in 
a thriving state ; while others, which have attained to fifty or 
sixty years of age, are now cut down as a market offers ; and in a 
good many situations, the ground they occupied is now trenched 
and turned into corn land. The Scotch fir, the larch, and spruce, 
are the prevailing kinds of wood, but largely intermingled with 
the other sorts of forest trees ; all of which attain a large size, and 
yield excellent timber. In a picturesque dell, in the midst of the 
finest of the woods, lies the garden of Tonley, a spot which nature 
and art have combined to render singularly attractive. 

Rent of Land. — The rent of land varies exceedingly, from dif- 
ferences of quality and other circumstances, some being let at 8s. 6d. 
some at L.2. The average of the parish, however, may be stated 
at about 14s. the imperial, or 19s. the Scotch acre. 

Leases.— The duration of leases is, in almost every instance, 
nineteen years, and they are not clogged with unfavourable or op- 
pressive terms. The rents are payable half yearly, and are chief- 
ly in money. It would be of considerable benefit to the tenants, 
if, instead of Martinmas and Whitsunday, the terms of payment 
were changed to Candlemas and Lammas, as not hurrying them 
into the markets with their crop. 

Hushandry.-The seven-shift husbandry is in almost universal 
use, the land bemg allowed to remain for three years in grass af 
ter which two crops of oats are taken in succession, then turnips,'and 
lastly, oats or bear with grass seeds; the ground being well clean- 
ed and manured when in green crop. The soil is very favour- 
able to the growth of the turnip, and its culture is well under- 
stood and much attended to. Bone manure is a good deal used 
sometimes m combination with dung, and is found to answer well' 
Potatoes are reared only for domestic use; and the field cultiva- 
tion of cabbages carrots, beets, &amp;c. is unknown. Oats and bear 
are the only kinds of grain raised, and in the proportion probably 
o ten acres of the former to one of the latter. The rearing of 
Wack.eattle IS here a leading object with the farmer, an a- 
straw, and turnips furnish the best winter keep. The cattle al

cattle, stated in the last Statistical Account at 625, is now about 
1000, and the increase in weight is probably in a much greater 
proportion ; while the number of sheep has very much d.mmished, 
there being now only a few of the black-faced kind kept by those 
farmers who are close upon the hill. 

The farm-buildings are in general sufficient. There are abou 
twenty thrashing-mills, most of them worked by water power, and 
the drains and enclosures, in both of which, especmlly the ormer, 
great improvements have of kte been made, are kept in good order. 
The fences are ingeneral dry stone dikes ; but the small holdings 
are still mostly unenclosed. The lower part of the parish is pretty 
well accommodated with roads ; but of its upper end the same can- 
not as yet be said. i i 

Since the date of the last Statistical Account, the whole agn- 
culture of this parish and district has been placed on a new footing. 
The ancient cumbrous plough, with its five or six yoke of oxen, 
whose whole force was often necessary to tear up the wild and 
vnatted surface, has been laid aside : the turnip husbandry he 
rotation of crops, the periodical cleaning and manuring of the 
whole ground, and the sowing down of proper grasses, have dis- 
placed the old infield and outfield practice ; and the use of hme 
Ls become universal, which, when applied in the small quantity 
of sixty or seventy imperial bushels to the acre, is found to have 

the very best effects. • j •„ 

Froduce.-The average gross amount of raw produce raised in 

the parish may be estimated as follows 

Produce of grain of all kinds, . • 'fonn

It may be added, that there are annually exported from the 
parish about 6000 dozen of eggs, amounting, at the average price 
of 4d a dozen, to the value of L. 100; and 186 cwt. of butter

in the parish or district. A number of the females employ them- 
selves in knitting stockings for a mercantile house in Aberdeen. 
The worsted is furnished to them at their own houses, and tliey 
are paid for their work at the rate of 3d. or 4d. a pair. About 
3000 pairs of excellent worsted stockings are in this manner made 
in the parish yearly. 

V. — Pakochial Economy. 

Market -Totons.— The nearest market-towns are Inverury and 
Kintore, each distant about thirteen miles. 

Meavs of Communication. — There is a good turnpike road the 
whole way to the latter of these places, and our farmers occasion- 
ally resort to it with their produce, which is thence transported 
by the canal boats to Aberdeen, bringing home lime in return. 
But by far the principal communication is with the county town 
itself, where it is found that both sales and purchases can be ef- 
fected on more favourable terms. The distance is twenty-two 
miles, but the turnpike road is excellent, and the acclivities few. 

The length of turnpike road within the parish is about two miles 
and a half ; the road from Aberdeen to Strathdon passing through 
it near its northern extremity, and that from Aberdeen to Tar- 
land touching it on the south. There is a stage-coach and a 
mail-gig, which calls daily at the post-office at Whitehouse, in its 
way from Aberdeen to Strathdon. The bridges over the small 
streams which cross the turnpike and other roads are in good re- 
pair. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The situation of the parish church is per- 
haps as convenient for the great body of the people as could well 
be found in a parish of such irregular figure. A small proportion 
of the inhabitants, however, at the south-west corner of the parish, 
are four miles from it; but in almost every other direction, its dis- 
tance from the boundary does not exceed two miles. The church 
was erected in 1838. It is seated for 550 persons, and is hand- 
some and commodious in no ordinary degree. The manse was 
built in 1835, and bears testimony also to the good taste and li- 
berality of the heritors. The glebe consists of about 7 imperial 
acres of good land, and maybe valued at L.U Sterling per annum. 
The stipend is L.96, 12s. l/d. in money, with L.8, 6s. 8d. for . 
communion elements, 25 bolls, I firlot oatmeal, and 2 bolls, ii 
firlot bear, and an Exchequer allowance of L.33, 17s. Ud. under 
the small stipend act. 

There are about 60 Dissenters in the parish, of the United 



618 ADEHDEENSHIRE. 

t 

Associate Synod, who attend a chapel on the immediate confines 
of this parish, but situated in that of Leochel. The or.gmal cause 
of their separation, as stated in the former Statistical Account, 
was their opposition to a new mode of singing mtroduced mto the 
parish church in 1760, which, however, has been long since adopt- 
ed by themselves. t: . ur u a 
The average number of communicants at the Established 

Church is 350, and divine service is well attended. 

About twenty years ago, a decree of the Court of Teinds was 
passed for the annexation of this parish and that of Keig ; Govern, 
ment having agreed, in consideration of the saving thus effected of 
L57 17s. 3d., payable yearly to the ministers of the two parishes 
under the small stipend act, to give about L.1200 towards the 
erection of the bridge over the Don at Keig. This arrangement, 
though, for the sake of obtaining the bridge, it appears to have 
been acquiesced in by all parties at the time, came afterwards to 
be felt so highly unsatisfactory, that when, by the death of one of 
the incumbents in 1832, the annexation actually took effect, sub- 
scriptions to the amount of several hundred pounds were raised by 
the heritors and the people of the two parishes; the claims of Go- 
vernment, in so far as insisted on, were liquidated, a decree ofdis- 
junction was obtained, and the ministrations of religion replaced 
in both parishes on their ancient footing.  , , i u 

Education.-Bes\des the parochial school, there has lately been 
opened, under the direction of the kirk-session, a school for girls, 
Xch receives a small salary from the Society for Propagating 
Christian Knowledge, and promises to be of great utility Ihe 
sak of the parochial schoolmaster is L.25, 13s. 4d., and the ave- 
rage amount of school fees which he receives does not much ex- 
ceed L 12. He is provided with a neat and commodious dwel- 
W house and school-room, with a garden adjoining, and these, 
Slhe allowance from the Dick bequest, constitute the whole 

pmoluments of the office. . 

irarv.-There is a subscription library m the pansh, esta- 
uVTl L years ao. It contains from 400 to 500 volumes, in 
'efeLl juS seated, which are much read and enjoyed.

be made by knitting worsted stockings, at which they labour with 
the utmost diligence. It is of course often requisite to give occa- 
sional supplies to persons disabled by sickness, or otherwise in cir- 
cumstances of temporary distress. It niay not be uninteresting to 
state the amount of church collections made at different periods 
for the poor. 

In 1722, L. 3 13 4, more than the half of which collected at the sacrament. 
1740 1 12 1, there being no sacrament that year. 
1783', 3 17 10, chiefly at sacrament. 9 poor on the roll.

1834, 25 1 7, twelve poor on the roll. 

1835, 28 0 0, twelve do.

In addition to the collections, there are available for the poor 
after paying the session-clerk's, precentor's, and beadle's salaries, 
the interest of L. 200, made up by a bequest recently left to the 
session by the late P. M'Combie, Esq. of Lynturk, and some ac- 
cumulations. It would be, on all hands, looked upon as most de- 
grading, were any person capable of otherwise obtaining a liveli- 
hood, to apply for aid from these funds. 

No market is held in the parish, but there are several, in the 
course of the year, at Alford, Scuttry, Monymusk, and other places 
in the vicinity. 

Inn. — There is only one inn, that of Whiteley, which is situated 
at a point on the high road, where such an accommodation could 
scarcely be dispensed with, and is respectably kept. 

Fuel. — The fuel chiefly used is peat, which has hitherto been 
abundant and easily procured ; but as the principal supply is from 
the common already mentioned, and persons from all quarters have 
been at liberty to avail themselves of it, it is likely in a few years 
to be much less plentiful. The peat is made up, in a considerable 
degree, of the decayed branches of trees, among which the birch 
is the prevailing kind. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
As there is not a single beggar belonging to the population of 
this or any of the neighbouring parishes, the prevalence of com- 
mon begging, by persons from other quarters, to the extent to which 
it was, till lately, carried on, is an evil of which we have good cause 
to complain. The greater number of those engaged in it describe 
themselves as belonging to the large towns, and although, no 
doubt, many of them are real objects of charity, in very many in- 
stances they arc individuals whose dissolute habits have deprived

ARERDEENSHIHE. 



them of emjDloyment, and of every inclination for it. The oppor- 
tunities for theft, and many other vices, which such a practice af- 
fords, are too obvious to require to be pointed out ; but the tax 
thus levied on an industrious and charitable population is perhaps 
not sufficiently adverted to. Suppose which probably is below the 
truth that every day twelve of these wandering mendicants, or 
seventy-two per week, perambulate a parish such as this, in which 
there are about 160 inhabited houses; that they call at one-fourth 
of these, and receive alms to the amount of a halfpenny each, and 
where they are served with meal or provisions, so little as a half- 
penny worth is never offered thera,:then the sum thus levied would 
amount to L.6 a week, or L.312 a year; one-tenth part of which 
would probably exceed the contingent such a parish would be cal- 
led upon to furnish, were any general measure for the suppression 
of begging entered into throughout a district. This evil, we are 
happy to say, has been much lessened since the establishment 
throughout the county of a rural police.

PRESBYTERY OF GARIOCH, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. JAMES BISSET, iMINISTER. 



I Topography and Natural History. 

]sJame.~Tnv. etymology of the term " Bourtie" cantwt be 
traced ; but, as in some old charters, it is found written Bourtiach, 
we may reasonably presume that the first part of the appellative is 
significant of some distinctive quality ; in like manner as the name 
of the district Garioch or Geiriach signifies shining or splendid 

Extent and Boundaries.— Boxxvixe extends from west to east 5 
miles ; in average breadth nearly 2 ; and contams probably 9 
square miles. In figure it resembles an irregular triangle, of whicli 
the western boundary, resting on Chapel of Garioch, forms the 
base, and the eastern point, where it touches Udny, the apex. On 
the north, it is bounded by Daviot, Meldrum, and Tarves ; and 



BOURTIE.

on the south, by Udny and Keith-hall. Near the centre of the 
parish, and distant a mile from each other, rise two hills of consi- 
derable elevation, being probably 600 feet above the level of the 
sea. That on the north is named the Hill of Barra, the other 
the Hill of Lawhill-side. These run in an easterly direction, and 
converging terminate in the Hill of Kingoody, by the foot of the 
eastern acclivity of which the parish is bounded. 

Meteorolgy. — From the height at which the manse is situated, 
the thermometer and barometer stand comparatively low. The 
greatest depressions which I have marked in the latter were, U, 
on the 20th September 1830, when, in a few hours from ten a.m. 
with a violent south-east dry wind, it fell fully two inches, and stood 
rather below 28 inches; and, 2f///, on 1st April 1836, when, at 
ten p. M., in a tempestuous night of snow and rain, the wind very 
strong from south by east, it was as low as 27.7 inches. It need 
hardly be remarked, that, though the barometer, from its rise or 
fall, may lead us to expect a coming change of weather, it does 
by no means per se indicate what that change will be, and that for 
any purpose of practical value in common life the season of the 
year, the direction of the wind, the appearances of the clouds, &amp;c. 
must be taken in connection, and the judgment deduced from a 
consideration of the whole. In making this judgment, consider- 
able assistance may be occasionally derived from observing the ha- 
bits of the common rook, which abounds in this neighbourhood. 
The signs which these afFord have been pointed out with singular 
beauty in the Georgics of Virgil. Some allowance being made 
for the difference of climate, perhaps his interpretation of them 
still holds true, so indelibly have the instincts of animals been im- 
pressed by the great Fountain of Life. 

The rocks in the parish are chiefly of the trap formation, and 
the summit of the Hill of Barra has been held, by some naturalists, 
to be the crater of an extinct volcano. 

\ II. — Civil History. 

The session register of Bourtie commences with the transfe- 
rence of a minister from a neighbouring parish in 1709. He was 
the first Presbyterian minister settled since Episcopacy was abo- 
lished ; for the now ascendant church, with a moderation and re- 
gard to the peace of the country which do it honour, seems to 
have permitted many of the Episcopal clergy to continue for life 
in the unmolested discharge of their sacred function. 
Antiquitics.—TXxQ parish is by no means destitute of ancient 



22 ABEHDEENSHIUE. 

remains. Three of the circles, which continue to be named Druid- 
ical, existed at the date of the last report. Tnvo of these reman, 
-one in a state of considerable preservation, on the lands ot 
Thornton. Two barrows, or rather cairns, have been opened 
within the last ten years. In each there was lound a stone-coffin, 
Inclosing two urns of hard-baked carved pottery. The urns were 
full of rich loam, mixed with charcoal. The largest of these ca.rns 
a ed on an eminence called the Hawklaw, or.gma ly covered 
ne ly half an acre, and was surrounded with a crcle of small 



stones set on end. r 

Cumming's Camp.-The most remarkable, however, of our an- 
cienrTemaL is the tortiScaUon on the HUl of Barra,". kno« by 
the name of the Cumming's Camp. This, and the crcumstances 
onnected with it, have afforded a fertile theme of ,scuss,o„ to 
antiquarians, and I shall therefore, perhaps, be excused .f I dwell 
on t aT ome length. The fort occupjing the flat summit of the 
hU l oon atas fully three acres of ground, and is -rrounded w,th 
three nearly parallel walls ot circumvallat.on, composed of earth 
and stone. Apart from its name, the camp would be cons.dered 
merely one of those hill-forts, which, by no means rare ,n Scotland 
reretty numerous in the adjacent country. Thus we have, wUh 
t rh differences merely as arise from the nature of the accessible 
matert t the f on Benachie and the Keirhill in Skene, and the

hour, seem to render very doubtful. They were the invading and 
more powerful party, and came to seek not a secure retreat but, 
as they believed, an easy victory over the Bruce, already depressed 
with reverses and wasted by most valetudinary health. Barbour's 
account of the battle, which is the most authentic, is here sub- 
joined. It was fought on 22d May 1308. " The King having 
crossed the Grampians received the allegiance of some barons, 
but, in a short time, fell sick at Inverury; he was unable to take 
any sustenance, and his strength entirely ftiiled him. Havintr 
been placed in a litter, he was carried to the Slenach or Sliach, 
in the parish of Drumblade, a fortification of some strength. After 
Martinmas, when the ground was covered with snow, the Earl of 
Buchan raised an army, and along with his brother, Sir John the 
Mowbray, and Sir David Brechin, nephew to the Bruce, marched 
against the monarch. 

The conflict lasted three days, but, being confined to discharges 
of arrows, little harm was done. The forces of Bruce were at last 
obliged to quit their defences by famine, and having placed the 
royal litter in the centre of their army, they proceeded to Strath- 
bogie without any molestation from Buchan, who seems to have 
feared to attack them. Shortly after, they removed the Kino- to 
Inverury. Meantime Buchan, Mowbray, and Sir David Brechin, 
assembled another army, and encamped at Old Meldrum. The 
next morning, Sir David Brechin, with a small party, rode towards 
Inverury, and so suddenly entered the west end of the burgh, that 
he drove the King's troops before him, and killed several. The 
Bruce lay at the east end of the town, and on receiving tidings of 
the onslaught by his nephew, instantly called for his horse, that 
he might do battle with the enemy. It was in vain that his friends 
remonstrated with him. " The insolence of these men," he re- 
phed, " has made me hale and fair ; no medicines could so speedi- 
ly have cured me as they have, and so may God be my help, for 
either I shall have them, or they shall have me." At the head of 
his troops, m number about 700, Bruce marched towards Old Mel- 
drum, and was met by Buchan. Astonished at the sudden appa- 
rition of the King, the soldiers of Gumming hesitated, and were 
confused : Bruce pressed furiously upon them ; and in a few mi- 
nutes they were put to flight, and utterly discomfited. The Earl

The decrease from the middle of last century to the beginning

the last seven years stand thus rf

into cultivation ; and not only so, but what is already in tillage 
might be rendered very greatly more productive. According to 
what we even at present see, it is perhaps not extravagant to af- 
firm, that every acre in Aberdeenshire, under whatever crop, 
might, on an average, be brought to produce one-fourth more. It 
is not want of skill nor enterprise that prevents this; nor want of 
. capital ; nor want of proper encouragement by proprietors ; one 
and all of these may partially operate as retarding causes. There 
exists one barrier to our onward progress, of such supereminent 
magnitude that it stands alone, and before it, the others " hide 
their diminished heads." This is want of confidence in the stabi- 
lity of our external agricultural defences. Could it be whispered 
into the ears of those men whose motto is, " We are the people, 
and for the people," how many ten thousand pounds their motions 
for demolishing the corn-laws prevent annually from being com- 
mitted to the bosom of that " tellus gratissima, qusenunquam red- 
dit nisi cum foenore," we believe that, having the end in view which 
they profess, they would cease from agitating this question. Far- 
mers will not lay out on waste ground the value of 100 bushels of 
grain, even with the prospect of reaping in time 200, for that time 
embraces a period of some years, if the sword be ever suspend- 
ed over their heads. The capital thus withheld would incalcula- 
bly increase the productions of the earth for man and beast : for 
each acre of land brought into cultivation does not increase grain 
and herbage oi{[y pro tanto, or arithmetically, but adds to the pro- 
ductive powers of all the land around, from the increased tempe- 
rature which it induces, and the diminution of mildews and ear- 
ly frosts. Nor is this all : the " bare boli;' as the farmer signi- 
ficantly calls it, brought from abroad, is a very different thing 
from an additional boll raised at home ; because this last carried 
with it the capacity of feeding more cattle, and thus brings a 
greater supply of milk, butter, cheese, and well-fed butcher-meat 
within the reach of the great body of the people. But this, says 
the modern school of economists, is forcing things unnaturally. It 
iS, every Briton may answer, adding to the beauty, the fertility, the 
salubrity, and the riches of that land, " quae me genuit atque aluit;" 
It IS following the dictates of a sound mind, for preventing under 
Providence those violent and sudden alternations of ruinously low 
and ruinously high or famine prices, as to the desolating effects of 
which the traditional annals of this and other parishes bear an 
palling testimony.  "

v.— Pauochiai- Economy. 
Market-Tnon.-Theve is no market held within the parish : 
the nearest market-tovvn is Old Meldrum, which hes towards the 
north, but much the greatest intercourse is with Inverury, though 
rather more distant to the south-west. 

. Ecclesiastical State.-TUe church is near the centre of the pa- 
rish : it was built m 1806, is in tolerable repair, and contains . 
about 300 sittings. There is no other place of worship The 
Dissenters are, Episcopalians, 2 ; Quakers, 2 ; Seceders, 14 ; ol, 
18. All the others attend church with commendable punctuahty , 
the average number of communicants is 210. 

Educafion.-The parochial school is the only one in the parish ; 
it is well attended, for the people are universally ahve to the benetits 
of a sound, cheap, and religious education. All come to years can 
read and write, and there are scarcely any, even among the peasan- 
try, who have not made some progress in accounting. The work 
of Uucation is begun at the age of four or five, and chil ren are_ 
sent to school for the first time, from that period of o 
seven, according to their distance from school About one 
eleventh part of the population are in attendance during winte. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.-T.e average --er of p upe 
is seven; the sum allotted to each varies from Is. to Is. 4d per 
lb sevtju , t i„ T n vP'Av The annual collections 

eek, and averages nearly L. 3 a-jeai. 1 ne  „ . • .. 
amount to about L. 20 ; we have besides L. 7 or L.8 of mte rest

sums are quite sufficient for all our wants. There is a creditable 
tliZe,e.e.ce among the people. -/-V; 
any one has ever directly applied for parochial aid ; -ile, on he 
other hand, there are not a few cases in wl.ch it has been e h - 
ed when offered. " Not that 1 would refuse it, S r, ave hey 
laid on such occasions, " if I were in want; but I ought not to 
Lke it, until that comes : and i have yet something remammg, or 
am vet able to do such and such work." 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The inhabitants are a sober-minded, industrious, frugal, and 
tempta Fople, and readily contribute according to their means 
to advance any well-digested scheme of benevolence whether at 
borne or abroad. Several are reckoned very skilful farmers, and 

„.il,.PMon is the precise nmnbur of Dissenters given in 



WIDMAR.

the agriculture is, on the whole, equally advanced with that in the 
neighbourhood. There is neither inn nor alehouse in the parish. 
Our greatest reproach is the quantity of land unimproved or un- 
planted, and the state of the roads. These have been of late 
somewhat improved, but still they are worse than those in any 
other parish within the district.

PRESBYTERY OF KINCARDINE o'nEIL, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. GEORGE COOK, MINISTER. 



I. Topography and Natural History. 

ame. Boundaries, 4c.— The name of this parish appears to 
be derived from the Saxon word Mid, and the Gaelic word Marr 
signifying a black forest. ' 

Extent, §c.— The parish is nearly 7 miles long from east to 
west, and about  broad from south to north, in some places 
and m others not above 41. It is bounded on the east by the pa' 
nsh of Echt; on the south, by Banchory Ternan and Kincar- 
dine O'Neil; on the west, by Lumphanan and Cluny; and bv 
Uuny on the north.  

Topographical Appearances, c._The surface of the parish is 
very uneven being elevated into two hill ridges, and of course de'- 
pressed by their accompanying vales. Between the ridges flow 
nils or small burns from west to east. The ridges are of so gen- 
ie acchvity as to offer no obstacle to the plough from the bottom to 
the summit, and, if properly tilled, produce very fair crops, both 
green and white, unless where the soil is so thin as not to admit 
of ploughing. In that case, it is planted with Scotch firs, which 
hnve better than could well be expected from such meare ma-" 
erial, add considerably to the beauty of the country, afford sheU

wood. Now the plantations, under trees of various kinds, amount 
to about 1400 acres, properly thinned, pruned, and thriving. The 
clumps and hedgerows are, for the most part, judiciously laid down 
and kept. Here it may be observed, however, that too little at- 
tention is paid to extirpate the noxious weeds that, in many places, 
infest the fields, offend the eye, and prove inimical to the crops of 
grass and corn. 

II. — Civil History. 
Parochial Registers. — These consist of the kirk-session minutes, 
earliest date, 17th April 1768; records of baptisms, 2"2d Sep- 
tember 1717; records of marriage- contracts, earliest date, 18th 
October 1718. 

Land oioners. — Of these are four: John Mansfield, Esq. of 
Midmar, who possesses the most extensive and valuable estate in 
the, parish ; Mrs Duff of Corsindae has the next in extent and 
value ; Colonel Gordon of Cluny lately purchased the estate of 
Shiels ; Mr William Davidson is proprietor of Kebbaty. The 
only residing heritors are Mrs Duff of Corsindae, and Mr Davidson 
of Kebbaty. The former may be said to reside only occasionally. 

Eminent Men. — Under this head we may mention the Rev, 
John Ogilvie, D. D., the late incumbent, and predecessor to the 
present minister of the parish. He was allowed to be an able 
divine, a good critical scholar, an excellent orator, a sincere 
Christian, and an agreeable member of society. His superior abi- 
lities are evinced by his Britannia, and several other productions of 
his pen. He died in the year 1813, at the advanced age of eigh- 
ty-four. 

The late James Mansfield, Esq. of Midmar, and father of the pre- 
sent proprietor, John Mansfield, Esq. was a gentleman that de- 
served the gratitude, not only of his tenantry, but also of the neigh- 
bourhood. He had much merit in setting a good example of an im- 
proved style of husbandry, and liberally contributing to promote 
its advancement. PVom the most wretched and sterile condition 
imaginable, in which he found his property in Midmar after making 
the purchase, he brought about 500 acres most contiguous to his 
dwelling to resemble a flourishing garden, and these he set apart 
for his home-farm. When he began his agricultural operations, 
so rugged, wild, and barren were most of the fields, as not to be 
worth 5s. per acre; now they draw from L.l, lOs. to L.2. M.- 
James Mansfield died in 1823, much and justly regretted by his 
tenantry, and a wide circle of friends and relatives.

The crops raised generally are oats and barley. The green 
crops are turnips and potatoes. The duration of leases is nme- 
teen years, which is too short a period when expensive im- 
provements are undertaken. The most common complaint, how- 
ever, among the farmers, is the low price of grain, which ren- 
ders it very difficult to meet the term of payment of rents, ser- 
vants' wages, tradesmen's bills, &amp;c. without encroaching on their

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Aberdeen, which is about fifteen miles distant, is the nearest 
market-town. Thither our farmers drive all their grain and farm- 
produce. The corn-merchants attend the Aberdeen weekly mar- 
kets to purchase grain, and when there is a brisk demand, they 
send their agents through the country to buy for them, and allow- 
about 6d. for the boll or quarter. 

Ecclesiastical State — The church was built in 1787. It ac- 
commodates about 600. It is rather too near the south side of 
the parish, and, by consequence, rather too far from the- north, 
especially during the winter time. The sittings are free, the 
area being divided among the heritors according to their valued 
rents, for the accommodation of their tenantry, who are in gene- 
ral very well provided for. The average number of communicants 
is 470. Public worship is well attended, and the congregation 
make a very decent appearance on the Sabbath day/ The manse 
is old, and it is not known when it was built. It has undergone 
several repairs within these twenty years, and it is very insufficient 
at present. The glebe, including the stance of the manse, offices, 
and garden, consists of 12 acres, 3 roods, 2 falls Scots measure 
It may be valued at L.25 yearly. The stipend, as modified 3th and 
27th February, commenced with crop 1829. Meal at eiaht

has as yet been imposed on the parish for rehe of the poor ; but 
something, it is presumed, must soon be done for the support of 
an overgrown class of paupers. 

There are on the skirts of the parish two D.ssentmg congre- 
gations ; the one consisting of the United Associate Seceder 
the other of the Original Burgher Associat Synod. Both a.e 
mostly made up from neighbourmg parishes. 

Miscellaneous Observations- 
Since the last Statistical Account was written, not only the 
population has greatly increased, but the land rents have advanced 
]1 about L.flOa t. about L.3000, and, I beheve, rom good 
authority, they are more punctually paid ; while most of the am- 
houses have been rebuilt, enlarged, and improved and the office- 
houses are on a much better plan. A considerable extent of the 
fields is mclosed with stone dikes and unproved ; turnpike and 
parochial roads have been made and are kept in good repair ; s ge- 
co.ches pass and repass daily. Many acres of moory and marshy

side, and in the northern part alone has three fresh water streams 
which mark its boundaries, namely, the Shevock, dividing it from 
Insch on the north-west; the Ury, separating it from Rayne on 
the north ; and the smaller stream Gady, running from the west, 
and falling into Ury at the eastern extremity, where Chapel of 
Garioch begins ; and these general features of the peninsula are 
distinctly seen from Ardoyne, which signifies the top or height of 
Oyne, and is the highest ground in the northern section of the 
parish. 

Extent and Boundaries. — Its extent, according to the latest 
county map, is 11,000 imperial acres, or 17 square miles, which 
is probably not overrated, as three-fourths of a considerable inland 
mountain are surrounded by cultivated grounds and inhabited 
houses belonging to this parish, and must therefore, in any ge- 
neral survey, be reckoned within its bounds. The extent from 
south to north, or from Don to Ury, is nearly 6 miles ; from east 
to west, about 3 miles ; but the form is irregular. 

The chief mountain already referred to, and which is a conspi- 
cuous object in the district, is Benochee, a name which in Gaelic 
signifies the Hill of Paps, and is very applicable to the round tops 
or summits of this mountain, which are six in number, and known 
among the country people by various names ; the highest and 
largest of the whole, on the south-east, being called the Mither 
Tap Mother Top. It is 1677 feet above the level of the sea, 
and nearly 1400 feet from its base. The summits or crags are 
formed of masses of red granite of considerable size, the largest 
being about 60 feet in height, and of proportional length, but 
narrower on the top. The whole mountain extends from east to 
west about five miles ; from north to south, about three-and-a-half 
miles. 

The Don, which takes its rise in the mountains above Strath- 
don, runs along the south side of this parish for about three mile.s, 
separating it from Monymusk ; it is joined by the Ury about 
six miles eastward, and falls into the sea a little to the north of 
Old Aberdeen. But this river, though a boundary of the parish, 
is secluded from the most populous and cultivated part of it, and 
IS accessible only to the occupants of one property lying on thu 
south side of Benochee 

The chief mineral in this parish is granite, which is of a 
red colour. It is found in very large masses under ground, 
and could be cut into blocks of the greatest size required for

use, as was done about eighteen years ago, for the docks at 
Sheerness, from quarries on the south side of Benochee. It is 
also seen in great rocks above ground, as in the tops or crags 
above referred to. of which the seams or fissures are obhque ; and 
likewise in numberless outlayers or blocks of various dimensions, 
from two to ten cubic feet, lying over the whole surface of the 
hill, and which are much used for building through the neigh- 
bourino- districts, being easily formed and transported. Rock 
crystals of considerable size, and having a yellowish tint, are found 
imbedded in some of these outlayers ; and specimens of Scots to - 
paz, felspar, shorl, and jasper, are got in the same mountain. But 
on descending to its northern base, these, with the granite, disap- 
pear -and whinstone alone prevails, of a deep blue colour, 
and hard texture, but much used for building field dikes, and or- 
dinary walls. , • 1 f 
The chief alluvial deposit is peat-moss, found on the ridge ot 
the mountain in long flats between the crags, and covering the 
granite rocks to a considerable depth. From this moss the inha- 
bitants of Oyne, and several neighbouring parishes, are chietly 
supplied with peat fuel, of durable quality, but which is prepared 
and carried at an expense above its real value. The soil in ge- 
. .. neral is open and fertile ; the lands near the church, and along the 
Jgl . b,„k3 of the Gady, -having much of the freeness and other quali- 

ties of garden ground, are particularly rich and early, and brmg 
the crops to maturity about ten days sooner than in several adjom- 
ina parishes. On the sides of the mountain, the ground is more 
orless mixed with granite sand, but it is likewise productive and 

not late. .  j .1 „ 

Wood— There are several valuable plantations of wood on the re- 
spective" properties ; as those of Tillyfour, on the south side of Beno- 
chee, consisting of coppices of oak, birch, &amp;c. covering a arge ex- 
tent of hill, and yielding a considerable annual revenue for bark, and 
pla Lionof Scotch fir of good quality, and size fitfor all ordinary 
purposes ; the woods of Pittodrie on the east side of the same hill 
till  t "inincr Scotch fir of the finest grain, and almost equal to oak 

till '°T" I V Juh larch and various kinds of hard- wood ; and in 

i :: slln ol' the parish, the woods of Westhall con 
•still of fine old trees of beech, ash, elm, plane, lime, geen n

and larch, made within the last thirty years, occupy altogether a 
space of 2000 acres under wood. 

II. — Civil History. 

Eminent Men. — Among persons of eminence connected with the 
parish maybe mentioned John Leslie, Bishop of Ross, who had been 
educated in France, and was made priest of Oyne, and an official of 
the diocese of Aberdeen about the middle of the sixteenth century ; 
but in 1565, he was promoted to the bishoprick of Ross, and be- 
came the friend and counsellor of Queen Mary, and continued so 
during her long imprisonment and last trials. This John Leslie 
appears to have been a natural son of the minister of Kingussie, 
who was himself an illegitimate descendant of the Leslies of Bal- 
quhaine, an ancient and powerful family in this district ; so that 
the epithet of " Priest's brat" given by John Knox to the Bishop 
of Ross, though harsh was not unjust. Sir John Runciman was 
also one of the Priests of Oyne, and an official of the diocese, be- 
ing " Rome raiker," or messenger to Rome. And that the Pro- 
testant established church may not appear altogether isolated from 
the honourable families in the land, it may be added that Mr 
Alexander Turing, who was minister at Oyne from 1729 to 1782, 
had a hereditary claim to the baronetcy of Turing of Foveran, a 
title which was claimed and enjoyed by his son. Sir Robert Tur- 
ing, Baronet, who died at Banff Castle within the last ten years ; 
and which has fallen to his cousin. Sir James Turing in Rotterdam. 

Land-owners — About the middle of the seventeenth century, 
there were above twelve different proprietors in the parish, every 
considerable farm forming a separate lairdship or land ; but after- 
wards, these fell into fewer hands, and there are now only four he- 
ritors in Oyne ; viz. Sir Robert Dalrymple Horn Elphinstone, 
Bart, of Logie and Westhall ; Colonel William Howe Knight 
Erskme of Pittodrie; John Gordon of Newton and Ardoyne 
Esq.; and Robert Grant of TiUyfour, Esq.  

Parochial Begisters.— The session records commence in 1663, 
and consist of three volumes, containing accounts of the poor's 
tunds, church disciphne, baptisms and marriages, which last are 
now regularly registered. In the Scotman's Library, published 
by Mr Mitchell, various excerpts are given, professedly from an- 
cient registers of the parish of Oyne ; but the originals of these 
are not among the books now in the keeping of the kirk-session, 
which, however, are not continuous from 1663 to the present

an anci n° -anite column, nine feet high, and about two mdes

formerly laid horizontally on the moor of Ca den, at a httle d

milv feud or quarrel, of which all other record .s lost ; but on this 
lor beL phmted with 6r about thirty years ago, these stones

paired and enlarged by Captain James Elpliinstone Dalrymple, 
son of Sir Robert D. Horn Elphinstone, and great-great-grand- 
son of said John Horn, forms a spacious and suitable mansion. 
The walls of the oldest part are about five feet thick, and very 
strong and dry. 

The House of Pittodrie, on the east side of Benochee, is the 
seat of Colonel Knight Erskine, the patron of the church and pa- 
rish, and the representative of the ancient family of Erskine of 
Balhagerdy, known in the history of the civil wars. It stands in a 
very commanding situation, being fully 500 feet above the level 
of the sea; but as it is surrounded with wood of different ages, 
and well sheltered from the north wind, it is a pleasant residence 
both in summer and winter. 

On the south side of the mountain is Tillyfour, an old slated 
house, not now inhabited by the proprietor. This place once be- 
longed to the Earl of Marr, but afterwards came into the posses- 
sion of Sir Archibald Grant of Monymusk, great-grandfather of 
the present owner, and whose doings as an extensive improver 
and ornamental planter were the admiration of his time. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church was built in 1807, at an ex- 
pense of L.400, and contains above 500 'sitters. It stands on a 
little hill in the east end of the parish, and is a conspicuous object 
to travellers on the Huntly road. The manse was built for the 
last incumbent in 1796, for about L.230 Sterling, and the present 
school-house was erected in the same year, affording room for 
only sixty scholars, with three small apartments above for the 
teacher. 

Formerly, there were four meal-mills in the parish, it being 
thought an advantage to every property that had a fall of water, to 
have a mill for the tenantry : now, there is only one mill strictly 
within the bounds of the parish, slated, and having a public kiln • 
but there are three others of the same kind, very near to it, in the 
adjoining parishes, and in which the tenants are accommodated on 
the same terms as others. Thrashing-mills, or machines, are now 
so generally used, that there is scarcely a farm above thirty acre« 
that has not one, driven either by horses or water.

As there have been no actual measurements of the surface of 
Benochee, which is reckoned a royal forest or common ty, with 
certain rights, granted by charters to neighbouring properties, the 
above must be held as only an approximation to the superficial 
contents of the parish. The valued rent is L. 2300, 13s. 4d. 
Scots, the real rental not less than L. 3000 Sterling, consisting 
chiefly of money, with small proportions of farm meal, bear, and 
oats, by the county fiars, or payable in kind, as minister's stipend, 
&amp;c. &amp;c. There are five farms let at more than L. 100 of yearly 
rent, sixteen farms above L.50 yearly, and the rest from L. 20 to 
L.40 yearly, besides numerous crofts of a few acres, under L. 10. 
The rate for outfield land varies from 10s. to L.l per acre, impe- 
rial ; that for old infield or croft land is about L.2 per acre, and 
some of it above L.3 yearly; and the latter having been enriched 
under the old system of tillage, for many years in succession, 
with the whole manure produced on the farm, is found cheaper 
than much of the outfield, though let at double or even triple the 
rent ; there being a much greater surplus of produce left for other 
uses, after paying the higher rent, than from the poor field lands 
after deducting the lower rent, with seed and labour. The graz- 
ing of cattle is rarely charged by the head, but when it is, the ex- . 
pense may be reckoned at 15s. for a year old beast; L.l, 10s. for 
a two year old; and L.2, 10s. for a three year old stot, during the 
five months from June to October inclusive. Grass parks are 
let principally by the proprietors in the district, who keep many of 
their fields in perennial grass, which bring from L.3 to L.4 per acre. 

Live.Stock.--The number of black-cattle kept in the parish 
may be rated at about 1200 ; horses of all kinds and ages, 200. 
But the number of sheep is much diminished since the last Statis- 
tical Account was given ; for at that time most of the wearing ap- 
parel and bed-clothes used in the country was of native grown 
wool, and home manufacture,— coarse in the fabric but very dura- 
ble ; hence almost every farmer and tenant kept a small flock of 
sheep, pastured in the hill, which was common to all ; and though 
the flesh of these brought them little gain, the pasture was cheap, 
and the aggregate fleeces were valuable. But now, very little 
home-made cloth is used, excepting coarse blankets; and propor 
tionally few sheep are kept in the hill,— not above 400 in all 
with perhaps 100 of a larger kind, kept on tether, in the fields, of 
hner wool and for better purposes ; though the mutton of the lat- 
ter IS much mferior to the former when equally fed.

pioughman in the course of a day or two. Large and clumsy 
in all its parts, and drawn at a slow pace by ten powerful oxen 
yoked in pairs, it made furrows of gigantic dimensions, not less 
than sixteen inches broad, and sometimes of equal depth ; and the 
ground being never cleaned by fallows or drilled crops, the noise 
occasioned by the tearing up and breaking asunder the strong mass 
of growing weeds was heard at a distance like the sound of burn- 
ing furze or underwood. The whole manure collected and mixed 
was laid on the infield or home-fields, which v/ere required in re- 
turn to give yearly crops of grain oats, bear, or pease, without 
fallow, cleansing, grazing, turnips, or potatoes ; but, by the suc- 
cessive additions of manure, there was accumulated a deep bed of 
vegetable mould, requiring only to be thoroughly cleared of weeds 
in order to produce luxuriant crops ; whereas the outfield or dis- 
tant lands received no dung, except what dropped from the cattle, 
penned in folds during the night and part of the day, — were occa- 
sionally ploughed for corn crops, and cropped for two or three 
years in succession, and allowed to return to pasture of the indi- 
genous grasses, there being then no sown grasses for either hay or 
grazing.  Of this system of culture, which had its advantages in 
the existing state of the roads and markets, a remnant was to be 
seen in the parish so late as the beginning of the present century ; 
but it has since been completely eradicated, and has given place 
to the turnip husbandry, which is everywhere followed with more 
or less success, and with a rotation of five, seven, or six years' 
shift,— the last being undoubtedly the best where it can be adopt- 
ed, as It requires three-sixths of the farm to be in grass of one 
two, and three years old; one-sixth in turnips for succulent food 
in winter and spring; and two-sixths in corn, the straw of which 
with the hay, yields a sufficiency of dry food during the same pe' 
nod. And such has been the effect of the drill and cleaning til- 
lage, that two pairs of horses will now perform the whole work of 
ploughing, carting, and distant carriages , on a farm, which, in the 
ast century, required ten strong oxen and four or six horses to do 
the work, for much less produce, in proportion to the land culti- 
vated. The chief distinction between the old infield and the 
best outfield lands does not exceed a quarter of oats per acre with 
longer and coarser straw on the former than on the latter, but the 
gram not quite so heavy. Iron ploughs are now much used 
■ Leases are granted, not as formerly during one or more lives 
but for nineteen years and crops.

10 stone or 140 lb. per boll, 68 bolls, 1 firlot, | lippie; in bear, 
Aberdeen measure, or four-fifths of a quarter, 15 bolls, 1 peck, 1 
lippie. The victual is payable in kind, and, at the average of 16s. 
per boll of meal, and L.l per boll of bear, would make a stipend 
of L.l 70, including communion element money. The unexhaust- 
ed teinds, if legally valued, are inconsiderable. There are no 
chapels of ease. Government churches, missionaries, or catechists 
in the parish, nor any Dissenting meeting-house near to it, the 
whole number of Dissenters of all sects being under 20. The 
average number of the congregation is about 350. 

Education. — There is one parochial school, in which, besides 
the ordinary branches of education, Latin and mathematics are 
taught when required; the teacher being a graduate of King's 
College, Aberdeen, and a preacher of the Gospel, — as the great 
majority of the parochial schoolmasters in this Presbytery are. 
His salary is about L.30, session-clerk's fees, L.3, with an enclos- 
ed garden, and a house containing three small apartments. Being 
conveniently situated, the school is full during the winter months; 
but the accommodation is too limited for the present population, 
and would not contain above one-twelfth of the whole. Two fe- 
males teach about thirty young girls to sew, and to read very im- 
perfectly. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The poor's funds consist of L.90 
of lent money, with the weekly collections in the church, averag- 
ing 5s., and those at the communion, amounting to L.3, 15s. 
There are of extraordinary collections one yearly for the Aber- 
deen Infirmary ; one for the Presbytery's Lunatic fund ; and col- 
lections for the General Assembly's Schemes, amounting in whole 
to above L.7 annually. Besides the parochial collections, there 
are frequent subscriptions made from house to house in behalf of 
poor persons, who, from accidents or sickness, are brouoht into 
great distress; and a very considerable amount of alms, in meal, 
meat, drink, and money, is daily bestowed on wandering beggars, 
who are most numerous and importunate, coming chiefly from the 
manufticturing cities, towns, and villages. 

The average number of poor on the roll is 12; and the amount 
distributed annually, L.30, 10s., in sums from 8s. to 15s., divided 
five times in the year, according to their several necessities. The 
amount of church collections annually, including those at the

Braemar was anciently styled the parish of St Andrews, but 
after Malcum Ceann Mor, who had a hunting-seat there, threw 
a bridge across the Chiney at Castletown, it obtained the name of 
Ceann-drochit, that is, Bridgend. And about the close of Queen 
Mary's reign, when the Earl of Mar became proprietor of the 
lands about Castletown, the name of the parish was again changed 
to the present name of the district. At what time it was an- 
nexed to Crathie is not known, but there is every reason to be- 
lieve it must have been far back, as nothing can be learned con- 
cerning it, either from the records of session or presbytery. The 
form or figure of the parish is an oblong, lying from west, north- 
west, to east by south. It contains, according to Robertson's sur- 
vey of the county, 199,658 acres. 

It is bounded on the east, by Glenmuick; on the south, by 
Glen muick, Glenisla, Kirkmichael, in Perthshire, and iJlair- 
Athole ; on the west, by Inch, Inverness -shire, Rothiemurchus, 
and part of Abernethy; and on the north, by part of Abernethy, 
Kirkmichael, Banffshire, by part of Strathdon, and by Glen- 
muick. 

Surface, Mountains, FallcT/s, 8fc.~Th'is united parish contains 
a greater variety of beautiful scenery, and richer display of what 
may be styled the grand and sublime, than any other district in 
Aberdeenshire. Its towering mountains, with their bold and shelvy 
cliffs, covered by lofty trees of variegated hue and deepening shade", 
and its sloping hills diverging into deep valleys and verdant plains, 
—afford such picturesque and diversified prospects, as delight 
every admirer of the works of nature. 

The principal mountains are Lochnagar, Cairntoul, Benna- 
muickduidh,t Bennabuird, &amp;c. The first of these is situated 
the south side of the parish, and is partly in Glenmuick. Accord- 
ing to the latest surveys, its height above the level of the sea is 
3815 feet. The other three are on the north-west boundaries of 
Braemar, and are respectively in the order stated above, 4220 
feet, 4390 feet, and 3940 feet above the level of the sea.

tible of a beautiful polish, and in appearance, when highly dressed, 
it much resembles marble. There are also immense rocks of ex- 
cellent limestone, of which there are often veins or strata running 
in different directions from the base of these rocks, occasionally 
becoming visible above the surface of the ground ; so that the 
farmer in some situations might, if he chose, work a limestone 
quarry in some of his corn-fields. And besides these, there are 
likewise rocks of a hard flinty stone, which, in many instances, 
seems impregnated with iron ore. The top of all these rocks is, 
for the most part, covered with a thin layer of a blackish soil, 
rather of a mossy nature. The soil of this district is loamy, and 
bedded sometimes on dry yellow clay, but more frequently upon 
hard gravel, and is generally rather dry. 

Plantations and Forests. — The indigenous woods are birch, al- 
der, poplar, and mountain-ash. There is no oak coppice in the 
parish. The planted woods consist of all the different species of 
firs, but the larch prevails most in all the plantations. It grows 
quicker than any other, and is found to supply, in many instances, 
the place of hardwood, which is said not to thrive in this country. 
Although at Invercauld there are some large ash and chestnut 
trees, yet the common Scotch fir may truly be said to constitute 
the glory of this district, there being some trees of this kind of 
immense size, which are supposed to be from 300 to 400 years 
old. The far-famed forest of Mar is too well-known to require 
any particular description here. Its fir timber, both as to size 
and quality, far exceeds anything of the kind to be found in 
any other part of the British Isles ; and its pasturage, as to rich- 
ness and extent, is of a very superior description. It belongs whol- 
ly to the Earl of Fife and Mrs Farquharson of Invercauld, and is 
plentifully stocked with red and roe deer, and all sorts of game. 

To show the great value of this forest as a walk or pasturage 
for deer, suffice.: it to state, that Lord Fife's part of it connect- 
ed with Mar Lodge is at present let on a lease of seven years 
for the annual rent of L.1800. Invercauld's share is also of great 
value, but is never let. 

II. — Civil History. 

Ermne7it Me«.-Major- General Farquharson, late Governor of 
bt Lucia, and who died there, was a native of this parish. 

Proprietors.—' Hie sole proprietors of the parish are. Lord Fife • 
Mrs farquharson of Invercauld ; and Michael Gordon, Esq. of 



550 ABERDEENSHIllE. 

Abergeldie. There are five proprietors' seats in the parish, viz. 
Mar Lodge, Invercauld, and Corymulzie Cottage in Braemar, and 
Abercreldie and Balmoral in Crathie. The latter has been near- 
ly all "built by the Honourable Sir Robert Gordon, who rents the 
estate of Balmoral from the Trustees of the late James Earl ot 
Fife, on a lease of thirty-eight years. 

Parochial Registers—These are neither volummous, nor have 
thev been regularly kept. The first of them commenced with the 
ordination of Mr Adam Ferguson, on the 25th of September 
1700, and appears to have been regularly earned on t.ll 17th 
September 1710, after which date, there is a complete blank down 
to 19th May 1716. Whether a change of pastor took place durmg 
that period, the writer cannot discover; but, from a minute of ses- 
sion dated February 1721, it appears that Mr John M'Innes was 
then minister of the united parish, who was succeeded m office 
successively by Mr Murdoch M'Lenan, Mr Wilson, Mr Charles 
M'Hardv, and the present incumbent. 

AntiquUies.-i:\.eve are at Castletown of Braemar the ruins of 
an old castle, which is said to have been built by Malcum Ceann 
Mor for a hunting-seat. From the vestiges still remaining, U .s 
evident that the edifice must have been of considerable extent. On 
r mall eminence below Castletown, stands the castle of Braemar, 
an opening between two hills. It belongs to Invercauld. In 
I7L, it was let to Government on a lease of mnety-nine years, 
Ind has since been occasionally occupied by a party of soldiers as 
: rracks, L which purpose it is well adapted, both from its situa- 
tion, ani also from its being surrounded by a strong rampart. 

At Castletown, the spot is still pointed out where the Earl of 
Mar erected the standard of rebellion in 1715 and proclaimed 
Kin/james. About a mile and a half down the valley, on the 
south 0 Th Dee, there is a steep shelvy rock all interspersed with 

: . tb«t in the face of it, there is a cave of very difficult 
rsTw-iftt chtLs „re'T„verca„.d props., we. de-

tememhrance. Under the feudal system, when the chieftains, on 
anv alarm being given, called out their adherents, they had to 
march through this pass, and on the said cairn, each laid down a 
stone ; by which means every successive party could discern the 
number that had advanced towards the scene of action, and, upon 
their return, by counting the stones thus deposited, it was discover- 
ed how many of the men were amissing, or had fallen in the field 
of battle. 

III. — Population. 

In 1755, according to Dr Webster, the united parish contained 2671 souls. 
1794, by the return made to Sir John Sinclair, . 2251 
1831, by census, . . • .1808 

1841, . . . . • 1712 

The only village in the parish is Castletown of Braemar, which 
contains 245 inhabitants. The average of births for the last seven 
years is 39, and of marriages, 23. Of deaths, no record is kept. 
There are, in the united parish, 9 bachelors and 7 widowers 
above 50 years of age, and 21 unmarried women above 45. 

Language. — The Gaelic is very generally spoken throughout 
the whole parish, and, during the summer months, is used in con- 
ducting part of the public worship, both at Crathie and Braemar. 
There are, however, very few, if any of the inhabitants, who are 
not so well acquainted with the English language as to be able to 
converse and transact business in it, when necessary. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agrimltiire. — The number of acres under cultivation is com- 
paratively small in proportion to the great extent of the parish. 
There is no undivided common. The number of acres under 
wood, both natural and planted, cannot be less than from 10,000 
to 11,000. Considerable attention is paid to .the pruning and 
thinning of plantations, although perhaps not so much as their ex- 
tent would require. There being so much of hill pasture attached 
to each farm, and valued along with the arable land, renders it 
the more difficult to fix precisely the rent per acre. 

Live-Stock. — The black-fticed, or Linton breed of sheep, and 
the small black-horned breed of cattle prevail here, and of late 
some attention has been paid to its improvement. 

Several expensive bulwarks and embankments have been con- 
structed on the Dee since the flood of 1829; but the most ex- 
tensive of these is the one above the Lawn, in front of Mar Lodge, 
being 260 ells long, about 40 in breadth at the base, 9 at the top, 
and from 10 to 16 feet high. Another very strong bulwark was 



652 ABERDEliNSHIllB. | 

erected by the heritors of the united parish for the protection of 
the fflebe belonging to this benefice. 

The general duration of leases is nineteen years The accoin- 
modations for farmers have been greatly improved here withm the 
last fifteen years, and inclosures with stone dikes are also mcreas.ng. 

Produce.-The average amount of raw produce raised m he 
parish per acre, and also its value, taken upon the average of last 
seven years, may be seen by the following table :- 

Grain. Acre. Qr. irnp. Price per qr fodder. Value per Acre.

population attend the Established Church pretty regularly, and 
the number of communicants is generally from 750 to 800. 

Education. — The total number of schools in the parish is nine, 
and at all these about 250 boys and girls attend during the winter 
season, of which number nearly 40 come from the adjacent parts 
of the parish of Tnllich and Glenmuich. The parish schoolmaster 
has the legal accommodations and the minimum salary. Five of 
the schools above-mentioned are on the first and second patents 
of the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge, that is, two 
for boys on the first, and three for girls on the second patent. The 
schoolmasters have each L. 1 5 of salary, with the usual accommo- 
dations of a house, garden, and fuel, &amp;c. required by the society. 
The female teachers have from L.4 to L.5 each. The school at 
Inverury is from the Committee of the General Assembly, with a 
salary of L.25, an allowance of L.5 by the heritor in lieu of fuel, 
and an excellent croft of land capable of keeping two cows sum- 
mer and winter. The other Protestant school is only kept during 
the winter season ; but it is hoped that a permanent school may 
be soon estabhshed. The other two schools are kept by the Ro- 
man Catholics in Braemar, for three months during winter. 

Friendly Society. — There is one Friendly Society in the parish, 
which was instituted in 1815, and being remodelled in 1830, it 
was designated the Braemar Highland Society; of which the 
Earl of Fife and James Farquharson, Esq. of Invercauld, are joint 
patrons, and The Honourable Alexander DufF, and James Duff 
Esq. of Innes House, are presidents. It consists of two funds ; the 
ordinary fund is for the support of sick and aged members,' and 
for granting annuities to widows and orphans. The annual 
payment by each member is 4s. The honorary fund is for the 
encouragement of the ancient games of the Highlanders, and is 
supported by donations from noblemen and gentlemen frequentino- 
the district during the shooting season. The annual meeting o1' 
this society, held always in the month of August, is generally 
countenanced by many noblemen and gentlemen of the first re- 
spectabihty from all parts of the united kingdom. The funds 
are m a prosperous state. 

Savings Bank.— A savings bank was established here in 1816 
and how far its mvestments exceed the withdrawings will appear 
trom the present amount of its capital, which is L.1290, 10s The 
contributors are generally tradesmen and servants, with a few of 



554 ABERDEENSHIRE. 

the smaller farmers. The capital of the savings bank is now up- 
wards of L.2000 Sterling. . , 
Poor and Parochial Jnntf.-.-The number on the sessions 
roll varies according to circumstances. At present there are from 
55 to 60 receiving aid from the funds regularly twice in the year, 
On these occasions none get more than L.l, some 15s., and some 
less, according to their circumstances. But of the ""-ber before 
.tated, there are nine or ten, v.ho, being confined either by sick- 
iiess or age, require more frequent relief; sometimes to the 
amount of Is. 3d., but not more than at the rate of Is. 6d. per 
week, except where a sick nurse is requisite. It may, however, 
be proper here to mention, that, in addition to the session s allow- 
ance the proprietors give private benefactions to the poor on their 
'own 'estates, such as meal or articles of clothing, just as may best 
suit their condition. The only mode of procurmg a fund here for 
the relief of the poor, is by collections in church, proc amation 
dues, donations from the heritors and others, together with the in- 
terest on funded money, amounting in whole to about L.90 a-year 
which, in general, covers all the disbursements. The sense of the 
degradation, implied in a dependence on parochial relie , is now 
Inch impaired, although there are still some persons who feel a 
great reluctance in making their case known, even when actually

PRESBYTERY OF GARIOCH, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. ROBERT SIMPSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — Kintore in Gaelic signifies the head of the forest. 
Both the history of the district, and its present appearance, supply 
many proofs that it was formerly almost covered with wood. 

Extent, Sj-c. — The parish, including that portion of the old 
parish of Kinkell, which was annexed to Kintore in 1760, ex- 
tends from north to south about 6 miles, and its greatest width 
is a little more than 3. It is bounded on the north and east, by 
the river Don, which separates it from the parishes of Inverury, 
Keithhall, and Fintray ; on the south, by Kinellar and Skene ; 
and on the west, by Kemnay. 

The surface is broken by frequent inequalities ; but there is 
no eminence of great elevation. The beautifully wooded hill of 
Thainston is the highest ground in the parish, its summit being 
upwards of 140 feet above the ordinary level of the Don at Kin- 
tore, and about 280 feet above the medium level of the sea at 
Aberdeen. The lands immediately on the banks of the river are 
flat, and very liable to be inundated, which renders the crops on 
them extremely precarious. 

The immediate neighbourhood of the burgh of Kintore is well 
sheltered, and for the most part enjoys a very mild temperature. 
The most prevalent distemper here is low typhus fever, which 
often attacks whole families in succession, but seldom proves fatal. 
The exposed situations in the parish are cold and bleak. 

Hydrography.— The river Don, when it passes Kintore, is a 

 A distinguished Gaelic scholar has given a different derivation of the word. 
The origin of Kintore, he thinks, is Ceann Torr, the head or end of the heap. 
If this be the source of the name, the best explanation of it may perhaps be found 
»n the circumstance, that by the old road from Aberdeen, the town of Kintore lay 
at the termination of a very steep and rugged track of many miles, and at the com- 
mencement of the comparatively level district of Garioch,

considerable stream, its size beir,g touch increased by the waters 
of tire Ury, about t«o miles above the town. In tins part of its 
course it flows so gently as almost to resemble a lake. It ,s scarcely 
v sib e'from the low grounds, except at some po.nts very close on 
lu banks ; but whan viewed from more elevated s.tuat.ons at a 
Ireater distance, its numerous windings form a pleas.ng object m 
fi e landscape. Were the course of the Don stra.ghted wh.ch 
said to be a thing quite practicable, much new ground would 
be cq r d. and Lt at present under cultivat.on would be en- 
\L2 in v'alue. But many obstacles stand ,„ .he way of 
imnrovement, and, among others, the law of entad. The fasher 
Ts on the Don at Kintore were of considerable value forty or e n 
4°, years ago, but, owing to various causes, they are now of l.ttle 
™„ Luence The pearls also which Arthur Johnston says en- 
chedrr -r in days of yore, have wholly disappeared .n mo-

their aspect in general is southward qr eastward. Besides the 
flat haughs, however, there are several extensive hollows where 
the moss grounds occur, around which the exposure is different. 

Botany. — There are but a few plants, that can be said to be 
rare, found in the parish. Of these the following may be consi- 
dered worthy of notice : the alternate leaved golden saxifrage, 
ChrysophHium alternifolium ; the great water plantain, Alisma ; 
and restharrovv. Ononis arvensis. Other rare plants growing wild 
occur here, which are sometimes called native, though they seem 
to be in reality outcasts from gardens. 

The woods in the parish are very extensive ; some of which are 
full grown, and others but recently planted. On Lord Kintore's 
property, a great deal of the uncultivated ground is now covered 
with thriving plantations. 

11. — Civil History. 

It is evident, from many circumstances, that Kintore was for- 
merly a place of some consequence. The original charter of the 
burgh, tradition says, was given by Kenneth II. That, however 
has long been lost ; but one which bears to be a confirmation of 
it by James V. is said to be still extant. Kintore enjoys all the 
privileges of a royal burgh. It has always had a regular magis- 
tracy ; and under the late Burgh Reform Act, its municipal con- 
stitution remains unchanged. 

Several of the small heritors hold their lands of the Crown on 
very old deeds. One possession has continued in the same family 
of the name of Hill ever since the days of Robert Bruce, from 
whom they received their charter. Another family of the name 
of Smith still possess a piece of ground which was given to one 
of their forefathers by James V. 

Eminent Msh.— Many persons born in the parish of Kintore 
have attained to the highest respectability in different spheres of 
life, and have been eminently successful in commercial or profes- 
sional pursuits ; but the writer is not aware that any of them are 
sufficiently distinguished, on public grounds, to merit particular 
notice here. The celebrated Arthur Johnston, though not a na- 
tive of the parish, when very young, attended the school of Kintore. 
This circumstance is beautifully adverted to in one of the lighter 
pieces of that most elegant Latin poet. The same fact is also 
mentioned in the Lives of Eminent Scotsmen. And surely his clas- 
sical and general acquirements were such as to reflect credit on the 
seminary in which their foundation was laid.

The Rev. George Adams, in his Statistical Account of this pa- 
rish, mentions the remains of three stone circles between Kintore 
and Inverury, and a fourth in another place. He notices, too, a 
tradition that prevailed in his day of a battle having been fought 
at Camiestane, near Thainston, where a general or chief of the 
name of Camus or Cambus is said to have been slain and buried. 
He also states that there was, in the same neighbourhood, a long 
and apparently artificial hollow or trench, about eight feet deep, 
called Bruce's How, in which it is probable that Robert Bruce, 
during his stay in this district, had concealed a part of his army 
for some particular object. ■ 

On the moor between Kintore and Kinellar, numerous tumuli, 
of various sizes, occur— a circumstance which gives ground for 
supposing that it had at some time been the scene of great car- 
nage either in battle or in flight ; though no record or tradition 
now exists on the subject. One of the larger of these barrows 
was opened many years ago by Mr John Lumsden, then farmer in 
Bogheads. In removing the stones for the purpose of building 
fences, there were found several pieces of a black substance, very 
light, marked with dots of a different colour, and perforated, as if 
■ with the view of their being strung together. And from about the 
centre of the cairn, a stone-coffin was dug up, in or near which 
. were discovered an urn containing human hair, and a large ring 
■capable of admitting two or three fingers, and composed of a subt 
stance resembling finely-veined marble. These relics, which seem 
€d to all who examined them to be of very high antiquity, were 
sent to the late Earl of Buchan. Another caim was more recent- 
ly opened, and found to contain, among some other things, a rude 
urn, which was put into the hgnds of Mr Wilson, at that time pro- 
prietor of Glasgowego. On the east side of the town of Kintore,

called the Castle Hill, which probably at first served the purpose 
ot a Law ; but, it is supposed, was afterwards used as a watch-tower, 
where beacon-fires were lighted upon any sudden invasion of the 
country or other public alarm. And this last conjecture is the 
more likely, because Kintore, in former times, was a place of very 
general resort, being the point at which the great northern road 

ly lodged in it enS f', r adde-, l.y which those who oecasionnl-

Under wood, • . : 1892 

Total number of acres, unperial measure, 8430 

Scotch firs, larches, and spruce firs are the only trees found in 
any quantity within the parish, except on the estate of Thainston, 
where if put together there may be a few acres of hard-wood. 
The firs are regularly thinned out, and their lower or dead branches 
pruned off. The hard-wood is pruned on the foreshorteningsystem. 
For some years back, Lord Kintore has inclosed and planted up- 
wards of 250 acres annually in this parish. The planting is done 
by contract with a nurseryman from Aberdeen, at the rate of about 
10s. lOd. per acre. The planter is taken bound to fill up the ground 
regularly for three years. And great care is at the same time 
taken to cut down any broom or whins that might endanger the 
growth of the plants. 

The average rent of arable land in the parish is L.l, Is. ll|d. 
per acre. 

A few grass fields are let annually by public roup ; and on an 
average each full-grown ox or cow put on them may cost for the 
season L.2, 2s. No sheep are summer-pastured in the parish. 
In winter, in former years, there have sometimes been upwards of 
2000 sheep brought to the Kintore moors ; but this practice is 
nearly at an end, in consequence of the extensive planting now 
going on.  

There are very few sheep kept by the farmers in the parish. 

1 he larger cattle are mostly of the Aberdeenshire breed. Much 
attention is paid to have them of a good figure, and free from 
horns. The system of husbandry is nearly the same with that 
which is m general practice throughout the country. The leases 
generally bind the tenants to a seventh course shift; but the rota-  
tion of five shifts is followed on the better soils. 

During the last thirty years, 300 acres at least have, been 
thoroughly improved, by trenching, draining, and enclosino-, en- 
tire y by the tenants. Of late, Lord Kintore has trenched a good 
deal of moorland ground, and let it in small crofts at a very low 
rate. In such cases the tenant builds the houses, and the land- 

ord affords the wood. His Lordship also trenches ground to his 
tenants who already hold land, on condition of their paying the 
'nterest of the outlay; or the amount is sometimes divided into 
equal portions, according to the remaining years of the lease, and 
added by such instalments to the old rent. There are several 
embankments on the river Don. The principal one is that which

bions, it is thought, would add considerably to the value of both 
the great properties in the parish. It has been calculated that a 
new cut of 528 yards would shorten its course 2280 yards, and 
reclaim 21 acres of land, which might soon be made of fine qua- 
lity. 

Produce. — The average amount of raw produce raised in the 
parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows : 

Grain of all kinds, cultivated for the food of man and domestic 

animals, at L. 1 per quarter, • L.5844 0 0 

Potatoes and turnips cultivated in fields for food, . J 948 0 0

V. — Parochial Economy. 

There are several very good shops in the burgh of Kintore, 
which supply the neighbourhood with all commodities for common 
use ; but Aberdeen being distant only twelve miles, and the means 
of conveyance numerous, almost every article of merchandise of a 
superior description is purchased there. 

The post-office here is that of longest standing in the district 
of Garioch. The great northern road runs along the whole length 
of the parish, namely six miles, and a branch of it extends to the 
west, a distance of three miles towards Kemnay, and ultimately 
joins the Alford turnpike. Three stage-coaches, besides the Royal 
Mail, pass twice through Kintore daily. 

The Aberdeenshire canal terminates at Port Elphinstone in the 
parish of Kintore. This is a work of great importance. It has 
proved extremely beneficial to a large and populous tract of coun- 
try. When originally constructed it was only 17 feet wide and 3 
feet deep; but these dimensions have since been enlarged, and it 
is now from 21 to 23 feet in width, and about 3f feet in depth. 
Its length from the harbour of Aberdeen to Port Elphinstone is 
18i miles, of which about a third part lies within this parish. It 
was opened in 1807. The expense of its construction and subse- 
quent enlargement amounted to nearly L, 50,000. And though. 
It has unquestionably accelerated improvement very much in this 
quarter, the shareholders receive but a low rate of interest as vet 
on the money expended. The trade on the canal, however," is 

parish'" "'""■ statement «-a.s kindly furnished by Mr Tail, farmer at Crichic, in llii..

Steadily increasing. The tide-lock, an important addition, was 
completed in 1834. There is a small wharf at the town of Km- 
tore, as well as at the canal head. 

At Port Elphinstone there are mills, on a very extensive 
scale, for grinding all sorts of grain ; and the enterprising pro- 
prietor of these works, Mr Tait of Crichie, sends the meal 
there manufactured to all parts of the kingdom. There are also 
in that village two saw-mills, one driven by steam and the other 
by water power. Since the last census of the parish of Kin- 
tore, there has been a great increase of the population at Port 
Elphinstone ; and as the trade on the canal is daily extend- 
ino-, of which it forms the principal depot, it is likely to be- 
come more and more a place of general resort. Besides the 
mills already alluded to, it contains several large granaries, some 
wood-yards, and numerous storehouses for lime, coals, bone man- 
ure, and various other commodities, conveyed to or from Aber- 
deen by the barges. , 

Ecclesiastical State.-The parish church stands m the town of 
Kintore. It occupies a centrical situation in reference to the po- 
pulation, but not in reference to the extent of the parish, being 
• very near the boundary towards Keithhall and Fintray. The 
most distant parts, however, are not more than four miles from it. 
The church was built in 1819, and is at present in excellent re- 
pair. It affords sufficient accommodation for 700 people. It is 
quite large enough for the parish as yet, and, on the whole, con- 
venient; though the plan may be exceptionable in some respects, 
and particularly in the arrangement for dispensing the communion. 
All the sittings are appropriated. The country parishioners are 
amply provided for, but the inhabitants of the town have too li- 
mited a number assigned them. iQor. R. nPW 
The manse was built in 1784, and repaired in 1835-6 , new 
offices were erected the previous year. The glebe consists of two se- 
- paratepiecesofground. That portion adjacent to the manse me - 
sures 6 acres, and the soil being good, it might be let for L.3 per

which includes the allowance for coniniunion elements. The 
teinds are exhausted. 

There are seven families of Protestant Dissenters in the parish, 
and one family of Roman Catholics, comprising in all about thirty- 
six persons. The rest of the populatipn adhere to the Church of 
Scotland. The average number of communicants may be stated 
at 560. On the last sacramental occasion the number was 600. 

There is a parochial Association for religious purposes. The 
funds, amounting to L.12 or L.14 yearly, are chiefly devoted to 
the support of the General Assembly's Schemes ; but some por- 
tion of the annual contributions is always given in aid of other mis- 
sionary objects. 

The two Sabbath schools in the parish are numerously attend- 
ed. One of them is taught in the church by the minister and 
four assistants, the other in the Port Elphinstone school, by the 
teacher of that seminary, and a well qualified young man, who as- 
sists him, and occasionally supplies his place. About 150 chil- 
dren are usually in attendance at these two schools. The Sab- 
bath school library contains 200 volumes. 

Education.— In the parish school all the ordinary branches are 
taught. There are also classes for English grammar, geoaraphv 
and Latm. The Scriptures are daily read. The present'schooll 
master has been m office since 1836. His salary is L 30 He 
has a dwelling house, but no garden is provided by the heritors 
There is a good female school in the town of Kintore. About 
two years ago. Government aid was obtained for the erection of a 
school at Port Elphinstone. This is now a very thriving school, 
but has no endowment as yet. The number of children attend- 
ing all these seminaries is upwards of 200. 

A legacy of L. 260 has just been left by the late Mr John Bu- 
chan of Aberdeen a native of Kintore, for educational purposes. 
The benevolent donor appoints that L.200 of this sum shall be 
aid out at interest, and that the annual produce thereof shall 
orm an endowment to a school to be founded in the west end of 
this parish where it is much wanted. 

In the town of Kintore there is a subscription circulating library 
Among the young here, a taste for reading is very generally difi 

Poor and Parochial Funds.-The number of ordinary poor in 
this pansh has considerably increased of late years. But the na 
rochial resources, supplemented as these have always been by the \i 



686 ADERDliENSHlUE. 

beral yearly donations of the Earl of Kintore, would still have been 
amply sufficient, notwithstanding the increase of paupers, to aBord 
the means of relief to all common cases of poverty from old age or 
adverse dispensations of providence. The cause which has chiefly 
operated to augment the disbursements of the kirk-session, has been 
the heavy charges of regular board, unavoidably mcurred by re- 
cent circumstances. The cases here referred to are those of or- 
phans, deserted children, and imbeciles. Most of these cases, of 
which there are six, have arisen within a few years. The number 
of ordinary pensioners on the roll is 40. Paupers of this class, 
embracing the aged and infirm, receive a very inadequate provision. 
Occasional supplies are given besides tomilies and individuals 
under temporary pressure from sickness or accidents. The year- 
ly expenditure at present may be thus stated : 

Weekly allowances as board, . L.42 13 0 

Quarterly allowances, ■ ti in n 

Occasional supplies and incidental expenses, 1 1 lu u 

L.102 3 0 

to meet these charges the kirk-session derives revenue from 
the following sources : 

Ordinary collections, on an average of three years, L.48 0 0 
Rent of Session's property in Inverury, • 3 15 0 
Interest of money lent, . • • 

L.76 10 0 

Such being the unfavourable state of the poor's funds of this 
parish, the kirk-session felt it to be their duty to draw up a report 
of the same on the 16th of March last, which report or statement 
was given "in to the agents of the heritors. 

Lord Kintore's annual donation of L.25 is distributed separate- 
ly among about seventy objects of charity, including all persons 
on the ordinary roll, and a great number of indigent families and 

individuals besides. . t « a.. fl,p

management of the magistrates and minister, is restricted to the

Savings Bank.-ln 1837, a National Security Savings Bank 
was established in Kintore. This institution has proved remark- 
ably successful. It appears from the last annual statement, dated 
20th November . 1841 , that the number of depositors was upwards 
of 300, and the amount of deposits above L. 4000.

PRESBYTERY OF ELLON, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 



THE REV. FRANCIS KNOX, MINISTER. 



I- — Topography and Natural History. 

Name.SoME suppose Tarves to be compounded of two Gae- 
lic words, signifying respectively fertile and plain. The designa- 
tion of the parish would thus be a tolerable description of its ap- 
pearance, compared with that of more hilly districts. 

Situation and Extent.— Tarves is situated in that part of Aber- 
deenshire called Formartine, with the exception of a small sec- 
tion which lies on the north side of the river Ythan, and is there- 
fore reckoned in the Buchan district of the same county. It is 
bounded on the north, by Fyvie, Methlick, and New Deer ; on 
the east, by Ellon ; on the south-east and south, by Udny ; on the 
south-west, by Bourtie; and on the west, by Meldrum' The 
church is distant from -Newburgh, the nearest sea-port, ten, 
and from Aberdeen the county town, seventeen miles. In its 
greatest length, Tarves may be about 12 miles, and in its great- 
est breadth about 8 miles. It contains upwards of 12,000 Scotch 
acres, of which 11,000 are arable, 1000 woodland, and the 
residue moss and muir. 

Geology and Hydrography.-The appearance of the parish is 
of an undulating character, the land sometimes risino- into 
sloping acchv.ties, and sometimes stretching out into levels of con- 
siderable extent. The acclivities are of various altitudes, and 
commonly in the form of ridges, sloping most frequentlv to the 
south-west and north-east. The lower gro.mds are intersected 
by numerous small rivulets, vernacularly called burns, which carry 
off the dramage to the river Ythan. This stream divides the na- 
nsli into two very unequal parts, the greater being on the southern

hmestone traverses the east end of the parish. It makes its first 
"nee on the south bank of the Ythan, in a P-P- j'g

Haddo, ancestor of the Earl of Aberdeen, one of whose titles at 
present is Baron of Tarves. 

Not many years ago, there existed, on the farms of North and 
South Ythsie, several large cairns, of whose origin tradition gave 
no account, and at the bottom of which, when the stones compos- 
ing them were carried away for the purpose of building fences, 
there was found a quantity of gigantic human bones. They were, 
in all probability, the work of an era prior to the introduction of 
Ch ristianity. 

The Castle of Tolquhon, now in a very ruinous condition, with 
the exception of a part of it called « the auld tower," was built 
between 1584 and 1589 by William Forbes, laird of Tolquhon, 
Woodland, Knaperna, &amp;c. It is of considerable extent, being of 
a quadrangular form, and enclosing a large court-yard, the arched 
gateway of which is defended by two towers, with loop-holes to 
enable those within to use fire-arms or arrows against assailants. 
Great part of it is now roofless, and its walls are fast sinking into 
shapeless heaps of stones and rubbish. It is nearly surrounded 
with wood, part of which, especially some fine yews, seems to be 
coeval with the building itself. The family of Forbes, to whom 
this castle and the valuable property annexed to it belonged, was 
among the most ancient and honourable of that surname— the first 
laird of Tolquhon having been the son of Sir John Forbes of that 
Ilk, and a brother of the first Lord Forbes. He acquired the 
estate of Tolquhon, in 1420, by his marriage with Marjorie Pres- 
ton, daughter of Henry Preston, Lord of Formartine. In the 
church-yard of Tarves there remains, in good preservation, a part 
of an aisle, added to the former church by the same William For- 
bes who built the castle. It bears the inscriptions « W. F. 1589, 
dochter to Lesmore, E. G. and the motto of the family, viz. 
" aalus per Christum." 

The mansion-house of Schivas was built, about 200 years ago, 
by a gent eman of the name of Gray, descended from a younger 
branch of the noble family of Kinfauns. In its immediate vici- 
nity, are some remarkably fine beeches ; and there is a large and 
beautiful plane, which, according to tradition, was planted by a 
daughter of the Gray family. It passes among the people in the 
neighbourhood by the name of Mary Gray. In the house there

XV. — Industry. 
i,rM,«.-Seventy years ago, agricultnre in ""M''-"; 
eenerallv throughont the county of Aberdeen, was m a truly 
wre ched condition. The stagnation of water on the low ground 
"tery precluded tillage; while the arable lands were overrun 
:;ia oxious weeds, and chilled fron, November to May by .nn - 
merable land springs. The cultivated ground was v.ded into 
T'L calle/inleld and outfield. The recetved a 1 1 

manure of the farm, and was perpetually m crop. The latter con 
M of " rig and baulk," that is, of arable r.dges, between eve,, 
Co of which there was an interjacent space, termed a baulk 
which the plough never disturbed. The arable part was cropped 
lith „1 five years in succession, and then permitted to he ,n pa 
Tre for the satne number of years, in order to reerurt ,ls exhaust- 
Id t.owers of production. Green crops, with the exception of a

across the horses' backs. Carts and wheel- carriages were only to 
be found in the possession of landed proprietors. 

The improvements introduced by the land-owners towards the 
conclusion of the last century were at first but slowly adopted by 
the tenantry. Depressed by bad seasons, and deficient in capital, 
they had neither the courage nor the means to attempt expensive 
mnovations. The rise, however, in the price of agricultural pro- 
duce which succeeded the breaking out of the war between this 
country and revolutionary France, by increasing the capital of the 
farmers, enabled them to take advantage of the more decided and 
valuable improvements. Draining, inclosing, a better system of 
cropping, superior agricultural implements, and the application of 
the great stimulant, lime, became general, and from this period 
the progress of improvement was extremely rapid. Besides the 
profits realized by the new system of husbandry, an additional sti- 
mulus was given to the exertions of the tenantry by the abolition 
of thirlage to particular mills, and of the pernicious practice of 
takmg grassums on the renewal of leases, and by the letting of 
farms for periods of nineteen years on favourable terms for the oc- 
cupiers. Through the industry of the tenantry, and the encou- 
ragement afforded by the landlords, the parish is now in a highly 
cultivated and productive state. The extent of arable land is at 
present at least double, and the amount of produce more than 
tenfold, what they were a few years before the former Account of 
this parish was drawn up. 

. The rotation of crops is adapted to that species of soil in which 
•turnips can be most profitably raised. The land according to its 
quality is worked on a five, six, or seven years course. In the 
five years course, the crops succeed each other as follows: 1. Tur- 
nips; 2. bear, barley, or oats, with grass seeds; 3. pasture or hay • 
4. pasture ; 5. oats. In the six course, the land is pastured three' 
years ; and in the seven, two crops of oats are taken after three of 
pasture. The crofts and small possessions are generally worked 
on the hve course, the more extensive farms on the six or seven 
1 he six appears now to be most approved. 

The sowing of turnips, mostly of the yellow kinds, with a por- 
tion ol Swedes, commences in the end of May or very early in 
June, and by the 20th of the latter month is usually completed 
.From one-fifth to one-seventh of the arable land is under turnips' 
annually, deducting a comparatively insignificant extent for pota- 
toes, which are raised almost solely for the consumption of the in.

Aberdeenshire breed. These were succeeded by the polled 
breed of the district of Biichan, which were latterly crossed by 
importations from Galloway. About fourteen years ago, the late 
Mr Hay, Shethin, bought a short-horned bull from Mr Rennie of 
Phantassie, with which he crossed his native cows. This experi- 
ment turned out extremely well, and his example was soon fol- 
lowed by others ; so that the great proportion of the cattle at pre- 
sent bred in the parish are crossed by the Teeswaters. If properly 
kept, they are ready for the market when three years old and 
bnng at that age from L.20 to L.25 a head, and upwards, much 
more than the former breed fetched when a year older. They 
are either sold to the fleshers in Aberdeen, or conveyed to the 
Smithfield market by the steamers and sailing-vessels from that port. 
Cattle three years and three-quarters old, from this parish, brought 
, L.42 m Smithfield last Christmas; and an ox, being a cross be- 
tween a Hereford and a Teeswater breed, and fed here, obtained 
a premium from the Smithfield Club at their annual show in 
1840. In reanng the calves, it is the practice of several farmers 
to have them suckled by their mothers. After weaning they are 
led on turmps, grass, and oat-straw, seldom any thing else beino- 
given. The land is principally worked by horses, of which there 
are many excellent teams in the parish. In plough and harrow 
they are yoked m pairs, but in carts for the most part sinaK-. 
Very few sheep are kept, except on the Earl of Aberdeen's home- 
farm part of which IS situated in Tarves. Some swine are reared, 
but the number is insignificant. They are regarded as advanta 
geous by our farmers merely for eating up garbage which wouW 
otherwise be lost. The usual soHs of domestic poultry are to be 
found in our barnyards ; but they are reared for the supply of tl e 
home-larder, and never for sale.

acceptable than can be procured. Women engaged by the half 
year receive, besides board, from L.l, 10s. to L.2 in winter; and 
in summer from L.3 to L.3, 10s. In turnip time, they earn'sd. a 
day, besides victuals, and about L.2 in whole during harvest. The 
crop at that interesting season is all gathered from the swathe and 
put mto the bandages by the females. The bread of the farm-ser- 
vants and day-labourers is oat-cakes, and their other food consists 
of various preparations of dairy produce, oatmeal, cabbages, cole- 
worts, turnips, and potatoes. Beer is allowed them in harvest and 
at other times when the work is severe. Our servants and labourers 
are as expert in their respective departments, and will perform as 
much work, and to as good purpose, as those of any other district 
ui Scotland. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Roads and Markets.-The church of Tarves is distant from 
Aberdeen seventeen miles, and ten miles from the sea-port of 
Newburgh. To both of these places, where there is always a 
ready market for all kinds of farm produce, there is easy access by 
good turnpike roads. English lime, of which a great quantity i's 
annually used, can be had within six miles of Tarves, at a place 
called Waterton, to which it is brought up the Ythan in lighters 
from the port of Newburgh. It costs half-a-crown per boll ff four 
bushels Good roads have been laid off and completed within the 
parh Itself, and are now kept in excellent repair. Tarves has 
within Its own boundaries, six ancient markets or fairs for horses' 
cattJe, and grain. They are generally well attended, though man 
of the best cattle bred in the parish are sold at home to the deal- 
ers who export them to Smithfield. These dealers are all native 
farmers. 

Ecclesiastical State.-The church was built in 1798, and un- 
derwent considerable improvements about seventeen years ago 
It IS a commodious and comfortable building, and in perfect re- 
pair. It was originally seated to accommodate 900 persons, but 
the improvements alluded to curtailed about thirty sittings, so that 
at present It will not contain more than 870 individuals when not 
over-crowded. The number of communicants averages rather 
more than 800.  

There is a Seceder meeting house at Craigdam, in this parish 
situated rather more than a mile to the westward of the church  

Ihe manse was built in 1766, and, though still inhabited, is'in 
a very crazy condition, and fast hastening to decay. The items

L.8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. The glebe consists of four 
Scotch acres, including the garden and the ground on which the 
manse and office-houses stand. 

Education.-The parochial school and schoolhouse were erected 
in 1837 on a very liberal scale, and are extremely neat and sub- 
stantial,' as well as commodious buildings. The ff' ' 
salary amounts, including the Dick Bequest, to upwards of L.60. 
The fees average about L.30 annually. , , • i- 

There is a school at Craigdam, endowed by a benevolent indi- 
vidual of the name of Barron, with a salary of L.18 per annum 
from a bequest of L.600 in the three per cents. Jhe trustees 
are, the minister and two of the elders of the Seceder church at 

 Theris a third school, at Barthol Chapel, in this parish, the 
teacher of which has a house and croft provided for him by the 
Earl of Aberdeen. There are three other schools whose teachers 
have no endowment, but depend for a poor and precarious liveli- 
hood solely upon the fees paid by their pupils. _ 
The total number of scholars attending all these seminaries is, 

on an average, from 300 to 350. , . , • ,  

There are also several Sabbath schools m the parish, and the 
minister gives instruction in the principles of Christian knowledge, 
every Lord's day before sermon, to a numerously attended class

L 100 is annually divided,-L. 80 of which is supplied by collec- 
tions in church, the remainder by occasional donations, and a small

the last few years, has been rapidly diminishmg.

PRESBYTERY OF GARIOCH, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. ROBERT LESSEL, MINISTER. 



I- — Topography and Natural History. 
Situation, §-c.— Inverury, or, as it was sometimes formerly 
written, Ennerurie, lies between the Don and Ury, and, extend- 
ing to the confluence of these rivers, thence derives its nlme. It 
IS bounded on the west, by Chapel of Garioch ; on the south, by 
the Don  and on the north and east, by the Ury. Its lengtli 
from east to west is nearly 4, its breadth from north to south some- 
thmg more than 2 English miles; and it contains fully 5100 im- 
perial acres. 

Topographical Jppeara7ices.— The vale of Inverury, in which 
the town stands, and the haughs and lower grounds along the ri- 
ver s side, embrace about 1000 acres of light fertile loam incum- 
bent chiefly on sand. The ground gradually rises towards the 
west, and terminates in three hills within the parish, almost equi 
distant from each other, and separated by straths or valleys • that 
on the south is called the hill of Manar, the middle hill is nlmed 
Knockinglew, that on the north the hill of Drimmies. 

IJ— Civil History. 
Ferhaps the first mention made of Inverury is in the short nar- 
rative of King Eth It is noticed in a charter, of date about 1 178, 
by David Earl of Huntingdon, brother of King William the Lyon 
By this charter he conveys to the rich Abbey of Lindores " ec" 
clesiam de Fintrichi Fintray cum omnibus pertinentiis suis; et 
ecclesiam de Inveruriu cum capella de Monkegin et omnibus 
a us pertinentiis suis; et ecclesiam de Durnach Durns et ec 
clesiam de Frame Premnay et ecclesiam de Inchemabarim 
Insch et ecclesiam de Culsamuel Culsamond cum terris et de- 
cmis, &amp;c Archaeologia. Vol. xiii. p. 177. These churches 
came ,„to the hands of Earl David, then probably the richest Lo"; 
xn Britain, as part of the Lordship of the Garioch conferred on 



ADEUDEENSHIUE. 

him by his royal brother. Prior to this time a castle existed at 
Inverury, for, in 1180, Norman, son of Malcolm, Constable 
of the Castle of Inverurin, itnesses a charter, preserved m the 
Advocates' Library. It was situated near where the Bass now 
Btands, and is the first fortified place in Aberdeenshire on re- 
cord,-the Castles of Aberdeen and Kildrummy datmg no h.gher 
than the thirteenth century. I" he Advocates' Library Edin- 
burgh, there is an MS. entitled, A View of the Diocese of Aber- 
deen, by an unknown author. It appears to have been written 
about the year 1726. In reference to Inverury the author says, 
« The fam lies here are reckoned about 80, so, if IJow.ng six to a 
famiW the inhabitants cannot be above 480." The Edinburgh 
Magazine for 1760 contains a notice of I-erury and the coun ry 
of the Garioch, written by a Rev. Mr Forbes about 1738. In- 
verury was not improbably the head burgh of the Ganoch as early 
Is the davs of William the Lyon. Its original diarter appears to 
Le been lost, for it is, by a novodamus, created anew by Queen 
Ma y June 22 1558 ; and, on the 17th September 1663 on the 
petitL of John Earl of Marr, it was appomted to be t 
burgh of his Lordship's regahty of the Garioch. " The Parha 
nt appoints the burgh of Innerauray to be the place whe e al 
courts of justice and all executions belonging to the rega He of

Inverury was the scene of a contest between the Pretender's 
and Kino's troops on 23d December 1745. The rebels being in 
possession of Aberdeen, and having imposed a tribute of L.IOOO 
on the inhabitants, Lord Loudon dispatched from the north Mac- 
leod of Macleod with about 700 men, for the purpose of relievino- 
the city, and preventing the exaction of this heavy impost-f Lord 
Lewis Gordon, informed that Macleod had reached Inverury, 
marched his own regiment and all the men he had of Lord Johii 
Drummond's regiment, with a battalion of 300 Farquharsons, 
commanded by Monalhie in all about 1200 men, to attack him 
They proceeded by the Fintray road, and reached the Ury about 
sunset. This river they crossed with difficulty, near Mill of Keith- 
hall, losing a few men in making the passage. They, however, 
surprised Macleod, whose men were partly quartered at Artannes 
and other farms in the neighbourhood of the town. He collected 
hastily such as could be brought together, and formed in order of 
battle. The action took place under moonlight, but lasted only 
about twenty minutes j§ for when Drummond's men and the Far- 
quhar-sons advanced to close combat, Macleod's troops, greatlv 
in enor m numbers, gave way, and escaped as they best could. 
Of the rebels 20 were killed in the action, besides those lost in 
crossing the river, and a considerable number were wounded. Of 
the Kings troops 7 were killed, 15 so wounded that they could 
not be carried off thejeldand_ Among these

were Maitland of Pithichie, Principal Chalmers of King's College, 
and a few other low country gentlemen who happened to be with 
the army. Musket balls are still occasionally turned up on the 
field of battle by the plough. 

Antiquities.- Among the curious remains of antiquity deserving 
notice are the Bass and the Koning or Conyng Hillock, two tu- 
muli of conical form. About the name and origin of these, espe- 
cially the former, antiquarians have been much perplexed. Ihere 
are at least two other places in Scotland called by this name,-- 
the Bass at the mouth of the Forth, and the Bass near Dryburgh 
on the Tweed. Chalmers, in his Caledonia, quotes an Icelandic 
Dictionary to show that Bass signifies, in that tongue, Pmnaculum, 
and a Celtic work to prove, that, among the Celts, it signifies a 
rock, a rock under water, something low. The French &amp;a., ac. 
cording to him, is derivable from a Celtic source. He might 
have added, that in the Celtic tongue, 6«s signifies death. In 
none of its features does the Bass resemble any of the earth forts 
found in Scotland. Some maintain that it had been used for 
iudicial purposes ; that it was the central court for the district to 
which appeals lay from the local courts held within the circles of 
stones, still popularly, though very erroneously, called Druidical 
circles. That the Bass, being in existence, may have been so 
employed, seems not improbable ; yet it far surpasses in magni- 
tude any of the places which we know for certain to have been 
used for judicial purposes. Thus on Sunday, 2d May 1349, the 
Justice-General of the north of Scotland, attended by many no- 
bles, held a criminal court, « apud stantes lapides de Rayne en e 
Gariach f and the chief seat of the Bishop of Aberdeen s courts 
was the small mount called TilUedron, The old popular belief, 
that it would be of evil omen, unhappy, or dangerous to interfere 
with the Bass, as the plague or pest was buried in it, and if open- 
ed might escape, at once suggests the idea that P"f 
character. Such traditions are found connected -th not a fe 
other sepulchral tumuli in Scotland, equalling it - 
wise resembling it; and Clarke, in his Rus— 
ing some burrows on the Steppes of the Don in bat ountrj re 
laL that the inhabitants were abhorrent from the idea of te 
being opened, lest the plague should escape from them. The- 
tumuli, the Doctor has no doubt, are sepulchral. Bu if the b 
be of this kind, whose remains does P'-"b'\°" ,.e 
bodies of the chiefs were burnt, says Mr Pinkerton, de.c.ibnig

customs of the Picts, " a burrow of earth, in proportion to the 
rank, was thrown up. That of a beloved king was sometimes hke 
a Httle hill." Vol. i. 392. Chalmers Cal. i. 381, describing 
the short reign of King Aodh, Hugh, or Eth surnamed of the 
swift foot, says, " It was his misfortune to reign while Grig was 
Maormor ruler or earl of the extensive country between the Don 
and the Spey. This artful chieftain found no great difficulty to 
raise up a competitor, with a faction, to oppose the King. The 
contending parties met at Strathalan, in a bloody field, where 
Aodh was wounded ; and, being carried to Inverurin, died two 
months after this fatal conflict and one year after his sad acces- 
sion, during wretched times in 881." The Chronicon Pictorum, 
a good authority, also assigns his death to Inverury in the follow- 
ing words : « Edus tenuit idem regnum uno anno, ejus autem 
brevitas nil bistoria memorife commendavit, sed in civitate Inruriu 
occisus est," Antiqu. Celto Normannicse, 141. Another MS. 
has indeed Ururine Innes's Critic. Essay, and Pinkerton makes 
it Uturin ; but this last I should hold an error of the copyist. On 
the whole, looking to the sepulchral character of the Bass, and to 
the high probability that Eth finished his days here, I am inclined 
to believe that this burrow holds the remains of that unfortunate 
Pictish monarch. There is a prophetic popular rhyme concern 
ing the Bass, of which the most ancient version on record is in the 
MS. of Sir James Balfour, Lord Lyon King at Arms, who flou- 
rished about 1660. He says, « Ye river Ury springs from the 
hills of Faudlane, near Gartlie Castle, hard by Strathbogie, and 
falls m ye river Done, a little below ye church of Inverury, near 
the old fort or mount called ye Basse. Ye inhabitants here have 
this fouhshe aid ryme always in their mouthe, 

When Dee and Don runs both in one, 
And Tweed shall run in Tay, 
The little river of Inverury, 

Shall bear ye Basse away."_MS. Adv. Library. 

The Coning miocL-The popular belief gives this mound as 
the burial-place of the King. The mound is undoubtedly artifi- 
cial; but whether raised for sepulchre or a seat of judo-ment it is 
impossible to decide. If we should hold it for the former, it seems 
ot tar too insignificant dimensions for marking the resting-place of 
a 1 ictish kinff.

The Earl of Kintore holds nearly one-half of the burgh lands. 
The other burgh heritors are fully 100 in number. Of the land- 
ward heritors, Mr Gordon of Manar alone is resident. His niansion 
lies three miles west of Inverury ; it is situated on the southern 
face of the hill of Manar, and has the Don in view at a distance 
of 500 or 600 vards, is well wooded, and completely sheltered on 
the north and west. The house is modern, and is at once sub- 
stantial, comfortable, and commodious. On the lands of Manar, 
the now ruinous chapel of St Apolonarius, the patron saint of 
the parish, stood. The farm is hence, by a corruption, called 
Polander One of the two annual fairs, formerly held in the parish, 
ws called Polander Fair ; the other, on the 8th of September, 
W.S called Latter Lady Day, from being held on the anniversary 
r the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin. To Mr Gordon now also 
belong the lands of Blackball and Conglass. In reference to the 
f er it is said, in the View of the Diocese of Aberdeen, already 
nnld " Blackball, formerly the seat of the Blackballs of that 
iCbut since purchased by Thane of Blackball, and now, 1726,

who held the forbidden General Assembly at Aberdeen in 1606.

III. — Population. 

The population continued pretty stationary during last century, 
and, at the beginning of this, was not above 300. By the census 
of 1831, it was 1419 ; and, according to that completed in 1841, 
it is 2020. This great and rapid rise has taken place within the 
burgh, which now contains 1619 souls. 

IV. — Industry. 

Placed as the terminus of an extensive, naturally fertile, and 
rapidly advancing agricultural district, this parish has attracted 
merchants, artisans, and additional labourers, in order to sup- 
ply the wants of an industrious and thriving tenantry. But the main 
cause of the increase and prosperity of Inverury is, without ques- 
tion, the Aberdeen Canal, which has conferred on it many of the 
advantages of a sea-port. This patriotic undertaking was supported 
chiefly bythe landholders, through whose property it passes, and those 
of the Garioch. The Inverury Port deservedly called Port El- 
phmstone, from the encouragement which Sir Robert Elphinstone 
gave to the canal, exhibits a scene not unlike the quays at Aber- 
deen ; hundreds of carts, sometimes, in a day, delivering grain 
and carrymg away coals, lime, bones, dung, bricks, iron, timber 
or other materials for house-building. For many years, the be- 
nehts of the canal were comparatively unappreciated, and perhaps 
he carnage rates were injudiciously high ; at least, since they were

Even now, the original subscribers to tins undertaking derive 
no interest for their money, but the land rents have been raised 
from the facilities of transit which the canal affords. There are 
on the canal about thirty barges, besides an iron boat for passen- 
gers and light goods, which runs to Aberdeen daily. 

About sfxty hand-looms for weaving hnen have been for some 
time employed ; the introduction of a manufacturing population 
has not been favourable to morals. The number of low publ c 
houses and of houses for harbouring vagrants, is also a just sub- 

■'''ofthnooTacres which the parish contains, 3000 are under til- 
lage, 1000 are in thriving plantations, and 1000 uncultivated.

have a few ewes and lambs of the English breeds for domestic use 
Jd chiefly for the sake of the wool. The Aberdeenshire breed 

0 catae il most general, but with a few of the more extensive and 
onulent farmers, the short-horns are coming into favour. 

 Te leases are mostly for nineteen years ; the farm-houses and 
t Jd rhlve, within a short time, greatly improved, and the con- 
tt t nantry is, I believe, on the whole prosperous: tins

phinstone, though locally situated in the parish of Kintore, is rin 
1841 fully 100. ' '  

There are twenty fairs for cattle, horses, sheep, and grain, held 
annually in the burgh, the revenue from which, as they are well 
frequented, is considerable, perhaps L.60 a year. 

Branches of the Old Aberdeen Bank, the Town and County 
Bank, and the North of Scotland Banking Company, have been 
within a few years established; and among recent improvements 
ought to be noticed the lighting of the town with gas, and the 
opening of a new turnpike road from Inverury, through Chapel 
Daviot, Fyvie, Auchterless, and Forgue, towards the bridge of 
Marnock. There is a post-office in the town, and three coaches 
at least run daily to Aberdeen. The length of turnpike roads 
through the parish is about five miles. 

Ecclesiastical State.-The church formerly stood near the river 
side, where the church-yard still is. A new church was built on the 
present s.te in 1775. From the recent rapid increase of the popu-- 
lafon of the burgh, the church had become wholly unequal to [he 
acconodation of the congregation. It contained, with difficulty, 

'oofnTsoO TI ''' betweJn 

700 and 800. Th.s havmg been represented to the heritors and 

the magistrates of the burgh, they, with enlightened liberality, re 
solved to raise a church in all respects suitable to the increased im, 
po tance of the burgh and parish. The new church is to contain 
J3d0 sittings. It IS built of beautiful granite, and is of most sub 
antia woi-kmanship. The style is Gothic, moderately o a 
«iented A neat Episcopal chapel is also in the course Jf erec- 
tion There are, besides, in the town, a Methodist and Inde- 
pendent place of worship. Notwithstanding these differences of 
rehgious persuasion, it is pleasing to record'that they do no in- 
fluence the chanties or courtesies of life 

Education.~Bes\des the parish school there are five female 
c ools, chiefly for reading English, knitting, and sewing

PRESBYTERY OF DEER, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE IlEV. ALEXANDER SIMPSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Extent, Sfc. — The parish is about seven miles from east to west, 
and from two to three miles from north to south. It was erected 
into a parish in 1627, one division of it having belonged to Rathen, 
and the other to Fraserburgh. It is bounded by these two pa- 
rishes, and also by that of Lonmay, Deer, and New Deer. The 
small stream of water called the North Ugie runs through the pa- 
rish from east to west, and joins the other branch called the South 
Ugie about six miles below Strichen ; and, both united, fall into 
the sea about a mile north of Peterhead. 

There are throughout the parish a few spots of good land, but 
in general it is not of rich quality. There is no parish better 'sup- 
plied with moss for fuel. Little coal is used, and when used, the 
supply is from Fraserburgh. There is excellent granite for 
• building, of which Strichen House, and the houses in Mormond 
village, are a fair specimen. There was formerly limestone 
worked, but it has now been given up, being of indifferent quality 
Strichen House, which was built in 1821, and is among the largest 
private dwellings in the county, is surrounded bv thriving wood of 
considerable value, particularly some fine old trees, which have 
been planted more than one hundred years. 

II — Civil History. 
rhere is no residing heritor. With the exception of Mill of 
Adziel a small spot of about 1 5 acres, the whole parish is the property 
of Lord Lovat, whose estate of Strichen comprehends also nearly 
»U0 acres of the adjoining parishes of Fraserburgh and Old Deer 
and whose constant residence is Beaufort Castle, Inverness-shire'

Parochial Registers.-T\exe are some old registers of the k.rk- 
session, as far back as 1676, and it appears a register had been 
keut from 1701 to 1735, of marriages, and baptisms, and minutes 
of kirk-session. After that time, till 1785, with the exception of 
the insertion of baptisms, no register appears to have been kep ; 
or, if there had been any, they must be lost. From these early 
registers, it appears that the Presbyterian form of vvovsh.p had 
be°en always Observed. Since the year 1701 there have been 
four incumbents, including the present, viz. Mr Uny settled ui 
1701 ; Mr Smith, 1748; Mr Anderson, 1785, and who died in 
1806. 

III.— Population. 

In the returns to Dr WeLster, in 1755, the population is stated at loS 

In 1791. the number was HIJU 
In 1831, . . '»j2 

In 1841, . • 2012 

There are three medical practitioners in, and near the village, 
and the senior of them has practised with success for the long 
neriod of thirty -eight years. 

The people resident in the village, and throughout the parish, 
are, in general, healthy ; and some of them have reached a great 
age beL upwards of ninety. They are distinguished for the.r 
Loral and correct conduct, and their orderly and mdustnous ha- 
bits TheV are constant in their attendance on religious ordi- 
nances, strictly observe the Sabbath, and have always shown a 
liable desire for the religious education of their children, and 
not a few have had the benefit of an university education In 
proof of this, there are alive at present, three clergymen of the 
Established Church, having the charge of parishes, and five pro- 
bationers, all natives of this parish. 

IV. — Industry. 
The extent of the parish is in all about 7916 acres, of .h,ch 
about 5004 acres are arable, about 300 acres under wood, and 
abou 2612 acres uncultivated and roads, all Scotch measure 
The old valued rent of the parish is L.1876 Scots; the presen 
,M inckdiuff the feu-duties in the villages, and a valuation of 
rental, mclud ng the proprietor, amounts to 

the There are none of the farms throughout 

tlrish 0 la extent. With the exception of a few, .bey 
e ,t'f m L 5 to' L.50 ; and there are a good man, small croft- 



STRICIIEN. J89 

ers. The land near the village rents from L.2 to L.4. The com- 
nion rotation is three years in grass; then two grain crops; then 
turnips or Aillow; followed by a white crop, and sown with rye and 
clover seeds. The grain generally sown is oats; there is very lit- 
tle bear or big. The whole crop is cut down with the scythe. 
The culture of potatoes and turnips is now greatly increased, and, 
for securing a good crop of the latter, bone manure has of late 
years been found of great service. The breed of cattle is much im- 
proved, and the abundance of turnips during the winter, and good 
pasture through the summer, enable the farmers to bring them 
to market in good condition. 

V — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication.— The turnpike road, from Aberdeen 
to Fraserburgh, passes through the east end of the parish, about 
three miles from the village. On this road, there is a mail-coach 
daily The turnpike road, from Peterhead to Banff, passes through 
the village, of Mormond, which is about half way between. From 
Fraserburgh, to which also there is a turnpike road, the farmers 
are in the way of driving shell lime, bone dust, and manure. A 
great proportion of the grain, which is disposed of, is shipped 
there, being the nearest port. 

Aberdeen is the principal town in the county, and, with this 
place, there is constant intercourse by a daily post, and a weekly 
carrier. A post-oflSce has been long established  
Mormond village began to be built in 1764, by direction of 
Lord S richen, the proprietor, then one of the Judges of the 
Court of Session. It is regularly built, and laid offln stree s 

modious. The respectable appearance of those who are resident

Library/,— There is a well selected library, and the books are 

lent out, on payment of a small sum annually. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.—The number of poor on the roll of 
the kirk-session varies from 30 to 60, besides from 10 to 20 more 
■ who get occasional aid in money, meal, blankets, and bodv-clothes. 

They consist principally of aged females, who are very destitute, 
■ and, though they were able, could not earn sixpence a week. The 
mcome for their sijpport depends chiefly on the collections made 
m the church. The capital stock belonging to the session yields 
a.mually about L.16. The amount of the collections, including 
three extraordmary ones, and what is given at the time of dispen- 
sing the Lord s Supper, may amount to about L.75 Sterlino-. To 
tHs may be added a small sum for the use of the mortcloth. Of 
late years, the expenditure has increased so much, that the kirk

having- the acclivities on both sides, well cultivated, and interspers- 
ed in some places with hedgerows, which, in summer, have a very 
lively and agreeable appearance. The parish church stands on 
the north side of the Gady, and about a mile from the east end of 
the parish. Opposite to the church on the south side of the Ga- 
dy, Tillymuick rises, a bleak, lumpish hill, of no great elevation 
or extent, having the lower part of the north side of it cultivated. 
Still hvther southward, rises the mountain of Benachie, the west 
end of which lies within the boundaries of this parish. Although 
this mountain is only about 1500 feet above the level of the sea, yet, 
as it rises rather abruptly from its base, and as there are no other 
hdls of much elevation in its neighbourhood, it forms a very conspi- 
cuous and rather interesting object in this district of country. 
From Its tops or paps, of which it has several, may be seen 
with the naked eye, in a clear day, the German Ocean, for 
many miles along the eastern coast, the Moray Frith, and the 
Caithness hills beyond it. The Brindy hill stretches along to 
the westward from the foot of Benachie, cutting off a small 
portion of the arable land which lies on the south side of it 
tj-om the rest of the parish, and forms part of the rido-e of hills 
which separates the district of Garioch from the vale of Mford 
Ihe parish is rather destitute of growing timber, there being only 
three or four small plantations within it, and these of no great value

suitable for all kinds of building purposes, whicb bemg hght and

trict. No quarries have as yet been wrought for any considerable 
length of time. About two hundred yards west from the church 
is fouud a bed of serpentine rock, which may be traced west-

these there were several other mosses in the low grounds bu 
they are now almost entirely exhausted, and the surface nearly all

bed of very fine clay, which, when wrought into mortar and dried

III. — Population. 

It would appear that the population of this parish has fluctuat- 
ed very much within the last hundred years. The former Statis- 
tical report states, that " in Dr Webster's account, it was 448. 
Fourteen years ago, it was as low as 260, after the old farmers 
were removed. Three years ago, it was 471 examinable persons, 
or about 550 of all ages; and at present it is only about 450." 
Since the date of last Account the population has gradually increas- 
ed. In 1831, it was 625 ; it is now 691. 

The people are sober, honest, and industrious, and regular in 
their attendance on the public ordinances of religion. 

IV. — Industry. 

The males are chiefly employed in agriculture, and also many of 
the females at certain seasons of the year. About thirty years ago, 
such of the females as were not engaged in agricultural pursuits were 
chiefly employed in spinning flax. The perfection of machinery 
has superseded this branch of industry. This was succeeded by the 
knitting of stockings and jackets,-in which employment many of 
the females are still engaged. But the allowance for this kind of 
work has been of late so much reduced, that a woman, labouring 
constantly, cannot earn more than from Is. to Is. 6d. per week 
Servants are usually engaged by the half year; men at from L 4

so«n Leases are usually granted for nineteen years. The farm 
steadings are mostly covered with thatch; only fourteen dwelling 
housesare slated. Little has been done as yet in the wayofenc los 
.nghelds with stone fences. Thomas Gordon, Esq. already It 
oned, when improving his estate, laid out a considerable sum

grain in the parish, one on the Slievock, one on the Gady at 
Auchleven, and one at Gariochsford, the southern extremity of the 
parish. At the village of Auchleven, there are three engines for 
carding wool, and two spinning jennies, and the owner manufac- 
tures woollen cloth on a small scale. 

v.— Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication.-Th parish is intersected by two 
public roads, which cross each other near its centre. The one 
leads from Insch to Keig, and crosses the Gady at Auchleven, 
by a neat bridge of two arches, erected in 1 836, at a cost of L.70. 
The other road leads from the upper district of the country to In- 
verurv and Aberdeen. In 1824, this road was made turnpike 
from the church to Mill of Garden, where it joins the great north 
road from Inverness to Aberdeen, and affords easy access to the 
canal basin at Inverury, where lime and bones, for manure and 
coals are to be had at all seasons, and where granaries have late- 
ly been erected for storing grain to be carried to Aberdeen by the 
canal. The distance from the church of Premnay to the canal 
basin is eleven miles. Another branch of turnpike road has late- 
ly been made, leading from Kennethmont to Inverury ; passmg 
through the north side of this parish, it joins the former road a 

mile below the church. u -u ;« i7qo af 

Eccledastical State.-The church, which was built m 179-, at 
fords accommodation for 360 persons, and, with gaU ' 

ries, could be made to accommodate 120 more. 
all free with the exception of 60 in a gallery erected by the kirk 
es in,' with consent o'f the heritors, in 1828. These sittings ai-e 
let annually for behoof of the poor, at a rent o from 6d to . 6d 
each. The number of communicants is usually about one-hal of 
the whole population. The number of Dissenters in the parish 
does not exce'ed 15 grown up persons of both -es,chie 
their children. The manse is very old ; date of b-Wnj n 
known. It received an addition, with repairs, "P;-ds ;f fifty

Education. — There is only one parochial school in the parish. 
The schoolmaster's salary is L.27 ; allowance for garden, L.2, 
2s. 911.; mortification, L.l, lis. 8d. ; amount of school-fees, 
about L. 12. The teacher participates also in the Dick Bequest. 
The average number of children that attend school in summer 
may be stated at 30, and in winter at 50. The branches of edu- 
cation usually taught are, English reading and grammar, writing, 
arithmetic, mathematics, book-keeping, geography, and Latin, 
the fees for which are very moderate. The schoolmaster's dwelling- 
house, which was lately built, is ample and commodious. The 
school-room is too small. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of regular paupers on 
the roll varies from 15 to 20, besides others who require occasion- 
al aid. The usual allowance to the former is at present 12s. per 
quarter, which must vary according to circumstances, — the avail- 
able funds for the support of the poor arising chiefly from the in- 
terest of a bequest of L.l 000 by the late Thomas Gordon, Esq. 
of Premnay. The amount of weekly collections at the church 
does not exceed L.IO annually, exclusive of occasional collections 
for charitable and religious purposes. 

The temperate habits of the people may in no small degree be 
ascribed to the circumstance, that there is no licensed public 
house or inn for the sale of spirits within the parish, and only one 
merchant has a shop license for that purpose.

PRESBYTERY OV ELLON, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. WILLIAM WATT, MINISTER. 



I' — Topography and Natural History. 
Boundaries, -This parish is situated in the district of For- 
martine. It is bounded on the south, by the parish of Belhelvie; 
on the west, by the parish of Udny ; on the north by the burn of 
Tarty, from the parish of Logie Buchan, and by the river Ythan, 
from the sands of Forvie ; on the east, by the German Ocean 

' Drawn up by the late incumbent, the Rev. Maxwell Gordon. 



698 



ABERDEENSHIRE. 



It extends about seven miles from east to west, and about three 
from south to north. 

The river Ythan is about a quarter of a mile east of the village. 
It is here of a serpentine form, and is navigable nearly a mile and 
a-half. The ships are loaded and unloaded at low water ; but it 
is hoped that a pier will soon be built, which would prove 
a great accommodation to the farmers, particularly those at a dis- 
tance. The river abounds with salmon, sea-trout, flounders, and 
a great many other small fish ; but it is chiefly famed for its abun- 
dant produce of mussels. The quantity taken out of the river 
annually amounts to some hundred tons, and is sold at L.l, 10s. 
per ton. 

It is much to be regretted that the entrance to the river is bad, 
and occasionally dangerous, owing to the sand shifting at its 
mouth, and there seems to be no remedy for it. The sandy 
beach extends from the mouth of the Ythan, about one mile and 
a half north, and eight or ten miles south. On the south beach, 
there were lately many stake-nets for catching salmon, but bag- 
nets have now been substituted in their room, as they are worked 
with less trouble and expense. 

The fine little burn of Foveran runs through the parish, and 
falls into the Ythan near the village of Newburgh. There are 
three meal-mills upon it, all of the best construction, and abund- 
antly employed. 

It is well known that there is little wood on this part of the 
east coast of Scotland ; but the plantations around Foveran House 
and Ythan Lodge, mentioned in the last Statistical Account, have 
thriven tolerably well. In the western part of the parish, where 
Mr Hunter of Tillery built, a few years ago, a most handsome and

wood grows very rapidly. The Huntingdon willow seems pecu- 
liarly suited to the climate and soil of the coast side.

Antiquities. The following is an extract from a manuscript in the 

Advocates' Library of Aberdeen, written about the beginning of the 
last century, by Sir Samuel Forbes of Foveran : « Foveran has its name 
from the castle here, which is very old, and is thought to be so 
called from a sweet and very impetuous spring at the foot of the 
wall, having an arch built over it, for the Irish ' Foveran' signi- 
fies a spring. There was once an hospital founded by Sir Alexander 
Gumming, second Earl of Buchan, and son to the founder of Deer

Abbey, Justiciary of Scotland under Alexander the Third, and 
one of the six regents on his death. Here is still an hospital, 
founded for three poor men, by the first Alexander Forbes of Fo- 
veran, who have each of them a peck of meal and a groat weekly." 
There is still a small fund in the hands of the Foveran family, the 
interest of which a poor man gets under the name of bede money. 

Tliere is now no vestige remaining of the Castle of Foveran, 
nor of Turinof's Tower, which was still more ancient; but we need 
not say that the sweet spring, that bountiful gift of God alluded to 
by Sir Samuel, continues to flow with all its wonted abundance. 
There is a marble bust in the dress of the time of Charles I. lying 
on the ground, near the site of the old castle. 

Land-oioners. — The heritors of the parish are, Colonel Udny 
of Udny ; Mr Robertson of Foveran ; Mr Hunter of Tillery ; 
General Gordon of Cairness ; and the family of Wardhouse. 
Colonel Udny resides in London, and only occasionally visits his 
fine property here. The Foveran family have not resided much 
at Foveran House for some years past, but it is hoped that Mr 
Robertson will soon settle amonof us. 

Antiquities. — There is a very ancient burial-ground in the neigh- 
bourhood of the village. It is the burial-ground of the family of 
Udny, and it should not be allowed to lie in so totally open a 
state. There are some remains of an ancient chapel within the 
ground, which goes among the people under the name of Rood 
Church. In a service before the Sheriff of Aberdeen, on 10th 
January 1558, of Elizabeth Meldrum, relict of Alexander Gray, 
burgess of Aberdeen, among others, of certain crofts, and roods 
of land, lying in the barony of Newburgh ;. the boundaries often 
refer to the Cross of Newburgh, the lands of the altar of St 
Crispin, and Crispinianus, the lands of the Holy Rood, the lands 
of the Chapel of the Holy Rood. 

The castle of Knockhall, now in ruins, is situated about half 
a-mile north of Newburgh, and was, at one period, the residence 
of the family of Udny. It was built in the year 1565, was burnt 
by accident in 1734, and was never reparred. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture.— The land, generally speaking, is fertile, and pro- 
duces abundant crops of all kinds. There are many large and 
fine farms in the parish, and the tenants are most industrious and 
intelligent. An excellent understanding subsists between them 
and their landlords, and they live in great harmony amono- them 
selves. They are very hospitable. Their houses, or most of them

arebuilt of Stone and lime, two storeys high, and covered with slates. 
They are neatly finished, and comfortably fitted up. 

As an instance of the progress of improvement in the parish, it 
is worthy of notice, that, since the year 1824, in the CultercuUen 
district, 250 acres of barren land have been improved; about 
16,'200 ells of ditches for fences, and about 10,000 ells of drains 
have been cut; about 4900 ells of stone dikes have been built. 

About twenty fat cattle per week, on an average, have been, 
shipped from this parish for the London market during the last 
six years. 

Navigation.— The number of ships belonging to the port is 
eight. Tonnage, 646. These vessels are employed in the coasting 
and foreign trade, and import coal and lime, timber and bones. 
Grain is the only export. There are a pilot-boat and two fishing- 
boats belonging to the village. The fish caught in the sea are, 
haddocks, cod, skate, flounders, &amp;c. There is a ferry-boat on 
the Ythan, about three-quarters of a mile above the village, which 
gives at present a rent of L.16 per annum. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Fz7e.— The village of Newburgh,asmall but thriving sea-port, 
is pleasantly situated on the banks of the burn of Foveran, near its 
junction with the river Ythan. There are now several substantial 
and commodious houses in the village, and its general appearance 
is much improved. In former times, Newburgh was too much 
famed for smuggling, but, happily for the morals of the people, 
since the appointment of the coast-guard, this has been entirely sup- 
pressed. The land at Newburgh is a fine strong black soil, and 
produces, abundantly, bear, turnips, and potatoes, with a few oats. 
The averacre rent of the land about the village is L.4 per acre. The 
village conUiins 450 inhabitants, and 120 houses. There are no 
less than seven ale-houses, the same number as when the last Sta- 
tistical Account was written. There are in the village a baker, 
shoemakers, wrights, blacksmiths, and fleshers. There are like- 
wise four merchants, who deal in all kinds of groceries and ha- 
berdashery goods. A tide-waiter resides in the village. There 
is one Society, called the Newburgh Shipmasters' Friendly Society. 
A branch of the National Savings' Bank has been established 
in connection with the Ellon District National Savings Bank. 
A bone-mill, belonging to Messrs Black, of six or eight horse 
power, is in constant employment at the proper seasons. Ihe.e 
are eight granaries, large and substantial buildings, belong- 
Zl to Mes's Black, Falconer, Gray, and M.tchell. A consi-

derable sum of money was bequeathed by the late Mr Mather, 
a native of this parish, for educating and clothing twenty poor 
fishermen's children belonging to Newburgh. The writer un- 
derstands that the Magistrates of Aberdeen, Mr Mather's 
Trustees, have established a school in the village for the educa- 
tion of these twenty poor children. The same benevolent 
individual left L.20 per annum to the minister, or schoolmaster, 
for lecturing once a-week to the poor people of the village. The 
minister preserves the right of lecturing in his own hands, but the 
duty has been performed during the last three years by the Rev. 
Robert Abercrombie Gordon, our parish schoolmaster. Mr Ma- 
ther left also four bursaries at Marischal College, under the pa- 
tronage of the minister of Foveran, to be given to boys educated 
at the parish school of Foveran. 

Memis of Communication.— This parish is intersected by the 
Aberdeen and Peterhead turnpike road, on which two mails pass 
and repass daily. There is also a daily coach from Aberdeen to 
Ellon. There are three public-houses on this line of road within 
the parish. Another turnpike road from Aberdeen to Methlick 
touches the western extremity of the parish : and there is a most 
useful turnpike road now completed, I believe, from Old Meldrum 
to the village of Newburgh. There are several good cross roads 
which strike off from the Peterhead turnpike; and one of them in 
particular, called " the Fiddes road," which branches off opposite 
the Foveran Arms Inn, is most useful to the inhabitants of this 
parish, as it joins the Udny turnpike road, and opens up a fine 
communication with that part of the country. 

Ecclesiastical State.~The church, a plain substantial building, 
was built in the year 1794, and accommodates about 700 people 
There are three very handsome marble monuments on the inside 
wall of the church, two of them belonging to the Foveran family ; 
and the third, which belongs to the Udny family, is a most valu- 
able monument, with busts said to be very striking likenesses of 
two of that family, and was executed at great expense, by Bacon, 
the celebrated London sculptor. Handsome churchyard walls 
have just now been built, with a fund bequeathed for that purpose 
by the late Miss Robertson of Foveran. The attendance of the 
people at church is very exemplary, and their devout appearance 
and great attention to the preacher have frequently been taken 
notice of by strangers. The number of communicants is, upon 
the average, about 600. Between 20 and 30 young communicants 
come forward annually. ° mmunicants

The offices at the manse, which were built between sixty and 
seventy years ago, are at present in a ruinous state, especially the 
roof, and the manse will soon require considerable repairs. The 
glebe is very small, and is most inconveniently situated at a dis- 
tance from the manse; but the minister is accommodated with 
suitable ground by Mr Robertson of Foveran. 

Education.— The parish school is situated in the eastern part 
of the parish, and is much too small and low-roofed for the accom- 
modation of the large number of scholars who attend it. There 
is reason to hope that the heritors will soon pay attention to this 
most important subject. There is another school at Cultercullen, 
in the western part of the parish, with an endowment of L.8, a free 
house, and ground for a cow. It is well attended. 

Poor. — The average collection at the church door is about L.60 
per annum. The number of the poor has increased greatly of late, 
and their wants, from whatever cause, still more rapidly. Nearly 
L.lOO are now necessary annually for their maintenance. The 
session has hitherto been enabled to meet the demand, by having 
received several legacies and donations ; but an application to the 
heritors for assistance must very soon be made, or a small fund, 
which has not been broken in upon for many a year, must be used.

It is perhaps derived from two Gaelic words signifying " moor for 
cattle." 

Extent, Boundaries, Sfc.—lt contains an area of a little more 
than nine square miles, and is situated in the district of Buchan 
on the sea coast between the towns of Peterhead and Fraserburgh, 
being about eight miles distant from each by the present line of 
communication between these sea-ports. Its form resembles that 
of an isosceles triangle, being from three to four miles wide at the 
base, and from five to six in length. It is bounded on the north 



CIUMOND. 703 

and west by the parish of Lonmay ; on the south and south-east, 
by that of St Fergus ; and towards the north-east and east, by the 
Loch of Strathbeg and the German Ocean. 

Topographical Appearances, Coast, Sfc. — Along the shore, the 
land rises to an elevation of perhaps 200 feet, gradually descend- 
ing towards the interior, which is but a very little above the level 
of the sea, and then gently ascending to the south and south-west 
boundary of the parish, where it unites with the upper parts of 
Lonmay and St Fergus. The coast extends about two miles, and 
presents a broad surface of flat beach and sand hills, except at one 
particular point, where there is a long ridge of low-lying rocks, 
called Rattray Head or Rattray Briggs, running at right angles lo 
the shore, and extending from one to two miles in an easterly di- 
rection into the German Ocean. The most formidable part of 
this ridge is only visible at low water, which renders it peculiarly 
dangerous to vessels running too near the shore; and many a 
stately ship has been stranded there. Of late years, however, the 
number of wrecks on Rattray Head has very sensibly diminished, 
owing partly, perhaps, to the greater accuracy of modern charts 
and partly to the erection of a lighthouse, on the one hand, at 
Kinnaird's Head, near Fraserburgh, and on the other, at Bod- 
dom, near Peterhead ; and it is commonly observed, that, of the 
few vessels that are now stranded, the majority of cases occurs 
through carelessness or ignorance, or when the wind is off shore 
by standing too close in, either to catch the tides, or, durino- a 
breeze, to obtain smooth water. ° 

Climate Diseases, c-c.-From the circumstance of the district 
in which Crimond is situated extending considerably into the Ger- 
man Ocean, the temperature of the atmosphere is generally cold 
and bracmg. The usual epidemics common to other districts 
make their appearance here. But it has frequently been remark- 
ed, that while these have been raging virulently in the neighbour- 
hood, Crimond has generally escaped, or been mercifully dealt 
with. To what this exemption may be owing it is difficult to say. 
As an examp of the longevity of the inhabitants, it may be men- 
t 0 ed, that, during the last few years, three old women have died 
at the advanced age of one hundred, and there are many of both 
sexes m the parish who have seen fourscore years.

Hi/drography.—T\\Q character of the springs is generally niine 
ral, and they contain a large proportion of pure oxide of iron ; but 
they are seldom, if ever, used for medicinal purposes. 'J'here is a 
scarcity of soft spring water in the parish. The running streams 
are few and insignificant, and never rise above the character of 
burns; of which the burn of Savoch, dividing Crimond from Lon- 
may, is the largest. They all terminate in the Loch of Strath- 
beg, which comprises an area of about 600 or 700 Scots acres, 
and is situated chiefly in the parish of Lonmay, but partly in Cri- 
mond. Although not more than half a mile from the sea, and 
separated only by a sandbank or bar, the water of Strathbeg is 
wholly fresh. ' This bar of sand is gradually accumulating by the 
action of the sea, and rendering the prospect of thoroughly drain- 
ing this loch every year more distant. An attempt of this kind 
was made about the year 1790, but it proved a fruitless one, chief- 
ly from the want of funds to complete the undertaking, and from 
the sand perpetually drifting into the channel of communication 
with the sea, and thus preventing the egress of the water. It is 
remarked, however, that the depth of this loch, which is rarely more 
than 3i feet, is gradually decreasing, owing to the great quantity 
of alluvial matter or detritus brought down from the interior by 
the winter floods, and left to vegetate in summer by the heat of 
the sun; and that, although the prospect of completely draining 
it is distant, yet, by the outlet to the sea being kept unimpeded, 
its level might be much reduced, and thus the low-lying lands 
along its borders so far drained as to produce in dry seasons the 
most" abundant grain crops. In the former Statistical Account of 
Crimond the formation of the loch of Strathbeg is described as 
follows: " At the beginning of the present century, 1700, this 
lake was of much smaller extent than it is now. It was confined 
to a small part of the east end, and had a communication with the 
sea there, so that vessels of small burden could enter it. People 
born about 1700 well remembered the overflowing of the west part 
of the loch ; but the particular year is not now known, though it 
must have been about 1720. Previous to that, there was a hiU of 
sand between what is called the Castle Hill at Rattray and the 
sea, and still higher than it. A furious east wind blew away tins 
sand-hill in one night, which stopped the communication between 
the loch and the sea, by forming a sand-bar. The low- yin 
ground to the west was soon overflowed, and the extent o t 
loch much increased." From the great extent of sand which has 



CIIIMOND.

since accumulated between them, the sea may be truly said to be 
receding along this part of the coast. The scenery around Strath- 
beg is far from interesting or picturesque, as on the side next the 
land it is bordered by bogs and marshes, and towards the sea by a 
succession of sterile and cheerless sand-hillocks, covered with 
bent. To the sportsman, however, it presents considerable attrac- 
tion, from the numbers of wild-fowl that frequent its surface, or 
breed among its marshes,- and few fresh-water lakes of the same 
extent are better calculated for boat-sailing. In the upper part 
of the parish, where a narrow portion of the estate of Logie almost 
intersects the parish of Lonmay, there is another loch, called the 
Loch of Kininmonth, but more properly the Loch of Logie, as it 
lies entirely within the bounds of that estate. It comprises an ex- 
tent of twenty-two Scotch acres, and is mostly surrounded by a 
low mossy land, which gives it a bleak and desolate appearance. 

Geology and Mineralogy.— Oa this head, the parish, it is be- 
lieved, presents nothing of peculiar interest. Granite of excellent 
quality, and of a darker blue than that commonly known by the 
name of Aberdeen granite, is found on the east side of the 
parish ; while towards the west, on the estate of Logie, the 
red granite is found, but generally in a state of decomposition. 
Whinstone is also abundant. There are the remains of a lime- 
stone quarry near Bilbo, on the estate of Crimond; but it has not 
been wrought for many years. Iron ore is occasionally to be 
 met with. The soil throughout the parish is generally of a light 
' loamy nature, upon a clay bottom. Near the coast it is light and 
sandy, easily laboured, and producing in moist seasons heavy crops 
of gram, turnips, and grass. Near the mosses in the upper parts 
of the parish, the soil is cold and damp, and retains the wet to a 
great degree. The crops are consequently late and variable, and 
iiable to be blighted by frosts and mildew. In late rainy seasons, 
such as 1838, they never come to maturity. There is a large ex- 
tent of moss, of very great depth, belonging to the parish, deeply 
imbedded in which are to be found trees, chiefly oak and birch, 
ot great size, and in tolerable preservation, the melancholy remains 
of an era when Buchan presented a very different aspect in reo-ard 
to wood from its present naked and treeless appearance. Vestlo-es 
ot decayed hazel are also very common.

was considered the- American roller were shot some years ago ; and _ 
the bittern has been occasionally seen ; also the woodpecker. Ihe 
loch of Strathbeg, from its shallow and marshy character as well 
as from the circumstance of its being the most eastern fresh-water 
lake in Scotland, abounds in water fowl of great variety, of which 
xnay be mentioned wild swan and geese, wild ducks of every species 
common to the climate, teal, balcoot, widgeon, water-ra.l, snipe 
redshank, and herons of great variety and beauty. The swans ae 
only seen in the depth of winter, and when they appear in cons - 
dei-able numbers betoken the severity of the season in other qua - 
ters. They are frequently shot for their rich down, one km

connected by ancestry with, the parish, are Arthur Johnstone, the

an and John Farquhar, born at Bilbo, and afterwards well known 
both ,n England and Scotland as the « rich Farquhar of FonthUl " 
a long course of persevering industry, and almost miserly eco- 
nomy, he amassed an immense fortune in India, it is believed as 
an extensive manufacturer of gunpowder for the government ser- 
vice, as well as a successful commercial speculator. At one pe-

which time till now the session records, containing cases of disci-

there is much culpable negligence in regard to the registering of

Account, " is exactly half a Scotch acre in extent, called the Cas- 
tle Hill It rises 38 feet above a small plain on the north-east, 
but is only 12 or 14 feet above the higher ground on the opposite 
side " The famous Cummine, Earl of Buchan, had a seat here ; 
but after his defeat at the battle of Inverury, by King Robert 
Bruce, this castle fell into ruins. By the blowing of the light sand 
in the neighbourhood, which happens during every gale of wind, 
it is now covered with a deep soil, and produces crops of grain and 
o-rass In Fordoun's chronicle, after mention of this defeat, it is 
Lrrated that " Bruce pursued Cummine to Turriff, and afterwards

sot meas Jre, account for the marks of fire frequently discernib e 
on the large trees dug out of the moss. About a quarter of a mi e

Dalgardno of Blackwater, and David Rivis of Stratlistedlie, 
bailies of the burgh of Rattray, a jury of thirteen honest men, ci- 
tizens of the said burgh, find that Magnus Smith, the father of 
William Smith, died possessed of four roods of land in the said 
burgh. Upon this, David Rivis, one of the said bailies, superior 
of the lands of Rattray, grants a charter on the said four roods in 
favour of William Smith. The next charter is granted in 1675, 
by William Watson of Haddo, bailie of the burgh of Rattray, su- 
perior of the said lands, in favour of Isobel Watson, spouse of 
Alexander Bisset in Bilbo. The latest charter is granted in 17] I, 
by Charles, Earl of Errol, superior of the lands of Rattray, in fe- 
vour of the daughters of the said Alexander Bisset and Isobel 
Watson." 

Near the mill of Haddo, at a spot called the « Battle fauld," 
tradition points out the grave of Sir James the Rose, who was slain 
m mortal combat by Sir John the Grjleme, when contending for 
the hand of Lord Buchan's daughter. It was this circumstance 
that gave rise to the famous ballad of Sir James the Rose. 

Many ancient coins are occasionally turned up by the plouah 
or spade, near the site of the old burgh of Rattray ; but as they 
are generally gifted away to the curious in numismatology, no re- 
cord of their dates has been preserved. On the north-east side of 
the estate of Logie, are the remains of a Druidical temple, the 
stones composing it of gigantic dimensions.

The decrease since 1831 may be accounted for by the removal 
ot su or seven families of fishermen from Rattray Head to the new 
bsh.ng village of Burnhaven, near Boddam, they having found the 
landing at the former place too hazardous for carrving on their oc- 
cupatn with profit or success. Several families hve also been re-

rent of land may be stated at between 16s. and 18s. per imperial

two pecks of meal per week, and their peats driven, — a class of 
men who merit in general the highest praise, as they frequently 
bring up and educate a numerous family on such scanty means.

Cattle, Crops, §-c.— Great attention has, of late years, been paid 
to the breeding, rearing, and feeding of cattle, and a new impulse 
has been given to this branch of agriculture by the facilities of 
steam navigation from Aberdeen to London, and the ready sale 
which is obtained for them there. A cross between the Teeswa- 
ter and Buchan breeds has of late been in great repute ; but there 
•is consequently a great risk of the pure Buchan breed becoming 
extinct or greatly deteriorated, and many distinguished graziers 
are now turning their attention to this circumstance. The num- 
ber of milk cows at present in the parish is about 272. Since the 
attention of the farmer has been directed to rearing fat cattle for 
the London market, the dairy has been comparatively neglected. 
Very little attention is given in Crimond to sheep-rearing. 

Generally speaking, the system of husbandry pursued is excel- 
lent. The common method of cropping at present is a seven 
year's rotation. J. turnip and fallow; 2. barley or oats; 3. clo- 



712 



ABIillDEENSIlIIlE. 



ver and rye-grass, cut for hay ; 4. pasture ; 5. do. ; 6. oats or bar- 
ley ; 7. do. Potatoes are grown for home use, and occasionally 
for exportation ; but, from the great expense of land carriage to 
Peterhead or Fraserburgh, they are not reckoned a very profitable 
crop. Turnips are very extensively cultivated for winter-feeding 
cattle, and bone-dust very often employed in raising them. Fish- 
refuse is also driven from the fishing villages at a great expense of 
time and labour. The price of this sort of manure is generally 
conveyed from the interior in the shape of peats. The total num- 
ber of ploughs in actual operation in the parish is 79,— a few of 
them drawn by oxen. The various kinds of oats in common use 
are the potato oats,— Sandy, Hopetoun, and Kildrummy. The 
last mentioned is generally considered the best adapted for the 
soil and climate of Crimond. Wheat is seldom or never grown 
here. 

The usual duration of leases is nineteen years. 
From the general character of the soil and subsoil of Cri- 
mond, draining is of incalculable importance. Much has al- 
ready been done in this way to improve the land, but a great 
deal still remains to be performed ; and proprietors stand much in 
their own and their tenants' light, by not encouraging it to a much 
greater extent. Tile or furrow-draining, by which such beneficial 
results have been produced in other parts of Scotland, yet remains 
to be commenced in the parish of Crimond. 1838. The nearest 
manufactory at which drain-tiles can be procured is ten miles dis- 
tant, with three tolls, which proves a complete barrier to the tenant 
undertaking improvements of this kind at his own risk or expense. 
Were a tile-work commenced within a short distance, and there 
are on almost every estate most excellent materials, there is every 
reason to believe, that the opportunity would be speedily embraced 
to carry on extensive improvements in draining. 

Plantations, Quarries, Fisheries. -Gvei improvements m plant- 
ing are at present going forward on the principal estate of Cr.- 
mfnd; ash, plane, elm, and beech, are ound to thrive best m 
7 climat; and soil. Quarries of excellent materials, both for 
building and road-making, are open in various quarters.

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Toion. — The nearest market-town is Peterhead, nine 
miles distant, where a weekly market is held on Fridays. 

Post-Office. — The most convenient post-office for Crimond is 
also at Peterhead, although Mintlaw is somewhat nearer. A foot- 
post, or runner, on his own adventure, goes to Peterhead daily in 
summer, and three or four times a-week in winter. 

Means of Communication. — Various attempts have been made, 
for the last ten years, to run a stage-coach between Peterhead 
and Fraserburgh, passing through Crimond ; but, from bad ma- 
nagement, and the very small traffic upon the road, they have 
never succeeded. The length of turnpike roads in the parish is 
about two miles. There are seven or eight bridges, all in good 
repair, but none of them merit special notice. Most of the side- 
roads admit of great improvement, although much has been done 
in this respect within the last twenty years. Indeed, the manage- 
ment of the roads throughout the district generally is grossly de- 
fective. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The present parish church was built in 
the year 1812. As the farthest extremity of the parish is not 
four miles distant from it, it may be said to be conveniently 
situated for the whole population. It is in excellent repair, 
affords good accommodation for 500, and is divided amongst 
the heritors according to their respective valuations, and again 
amongst their tenants, according to the size of their farms. Al- 
though no free sittings are specially set apart for the poor, vet 
there is no want of accommodation for them, if inclined to attend. 
Unlike most country churches, the church of Crimond has a 
steeple, bell, and clock ; the last of superior workmanship, and 
presented by one of the heritors, the late James Laing, Esq. of 
Haddo, in this county, and of Streatham Hill, Surrey, a native 
of the parish, and one who invariably manifested a deep interest 
in its welfare. 

A part of the south wall of the old church, built in 1576, still 
remains in the churchyard. The present patron of the church 
and parish is the Right Honourable the Earl of Fife, the patron- 
age having been purchased from the Earl of Errol about the year 
1800. 



714 



ABERDEENSHIRE. 



The manse consists of three parts, viz. the original structure, 
built in 1763, and two wings or additions; that at the east end, 
built in 1798, and the other at the west end in 1815. Although 
it possesses a great deal of accommodation, it is far from being a 
convenient or sutEcient house. The garden and grounds were 
laid out with great taste, and at considerable expense, by the late 
incumbent, the Rev. William Boyd, who was inducted and or- 
dained in 1797, and died in 1839. He has been succeeded by 
his youngest son, the Rev. Alexander Boyd, inducted and ordained 
1st January 1840. The heritors of Crimond have long been dis- 
tinguished for their liberality in regard to the public buildings. 
The church, manse, and school-house are inspected annually by 
competent workmen, and every necessary repair immediately exe- 
cuted. They are also insured against loss by fire at the heritors' 
expense. The whole glebe land is exactly as follows :— Garden 
in front of manse, 1 rood 35 falls ; vegetable and small fruit-gar- 
den, 1 rood 33 falls ; arable land, 6 acres, 2 roods, 37 falls ; site of 
houses, planting, waste, &amp;c. 1 acre. Total imperial measure, 8 
acres, 2 roods, 25 falls ; or, Scots measure, 6 acres, 3 roods, 17 
falls. Besides the above, the churchyard and site of the old 
church contains 1 rood 7 falls ; site of new church, 28 falls. Im- 
perial measure, 1 rood 35 falls. The glebe land is in a state of 
high cultivation, and worth annually about L.l, 10s. per acre im- 
perial. The stipend, being 15 chalders, half barley and half meal, 
varies from L.200 to L.300 per annum, according to the fiar prices. 
L.8, 6s. 8d. Sterling are also allowed for communion elements. 

' The Established Church is the only church or chapel within 
the parish. In the former part of this account, under the head 
Population, the total number of inhabitants in 1838 was stated to 
be about 830. Since that time, from causes already hinted at, a 
farther reduction has taken place ; and, by a pretty accurate cen- 
sus, made by the minister in the course of parochial visitation m 
January and February 1840, it does not exceed as follows: Pres- 
byterians in connection with the Established Church, 575; Epis- 
copalians, 158; Roman Catholics, 10; Seceders, 7; total, 7d0. 
There is, properly speaking, only one native Roman Catholic resi- 
dent in the parish ; the others belonging to that church come from 
Ireland, and have only a temporary residence " .«""«.f'  
the coast-guard service. The few Seceders being eight miles disUu 
from thei place of worship, attend the parish church, except a 
the observance of the Lord's Supper, when they join the., o.n

communion. The Established Church is well attended. The 
Sabbath day is decently observed by the great body of the people, 
and religious discord between different sects is comparatively un- 
known. The number of communicants at the parish church va- 
ries from 360 to 370. The Lord's Supper is celebrated once in 
the year, generally on the third Sabbath of June. 

Education.— The parochial schoolmaster's salary through the 
generosity of the heritors amounts to L.35. He enjoys also the 
yearly interest of L.400, bequeathed by a former minister of the 
parish, the Rev. Mr Johnston. The school fees may vary from 
L.15 to L.20 per annum, all which, together with the Dick Be- 
quest, which, however, depends on merit, affords a very superior 
income to the schoolmaster. The school-room is large, airy, and 
well lighted, and the schoolmaster's house contains considerably 
more than the accommodation required by law. 

Besides the parish school, there are several female schools for 
the initiatory branches of education, with sewing, knitting, &amp;c. ; 
but one such school, conducted on improved principles, and by 
a regularly trained teacher, is still wanted, and ought to be 
established. A Sabbath school has been in operation for the last 
sixteen years. A parish library, containing about 400 volumes, 
"was established some years ago; but the advantages it holds out 
for acquiring sound and practical information are not so much ap- 
preciated as they ought to be. At the parish school, there is also 
a juvenile library for the use of the scholars. 

Poor's Funds. — The average number of regular paupers at pre- 
sent receiving parochial relief is 14, and of occasional paupers, 8. 
The average sum the former receive annually is L.2, Is. ; the lat- 
ter, L.l, 7s. The highest sum received by any one pauper at 
present 1840 on the roll is L.3, 15s. The average amount of 
annual collections for the benefit of the poor is L.32, 10s. 7d., 
which, together with the interest of L.400 in the heritor's hands 
and in the Aberdeen Bank, is in general found sufficient to meet 
all demands. A collection is also made yearly to provide medi- 
cine and medical attendance for those upon the poor's roll. There 
is frequently to be observed a strong indisposition on the part of the 
poor to begin accepting parochial relief; but, once it is granted, 
it can seldom be withdrawn without occasioning much complaint. 

Fairs and Alehouses. — There are three fairs held in the parish, 
— one at Candlemas, another in September, and a third in Octo- 
ber, for buying and selling cattle, horses, and sheep, and some- 



716 



ABERDEENSHIRE. 



times grain and potatoes. There are also three alehouses, or ra- 
ther whisky-shops. 

Puel. The common fuel used In Crimond is peat, which is 

procured with much labour, expense, and loss of time in the mosses 
of Crimond and Logie, lying to the south of the parish. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Among the remarkable changes which have taken place since 
the former Statistical Account was published, about half a century 
ago, may be mentioned the following : — 

1. The whole land in the parish, with the exception of a small 
feu at Rattray, belonging to R. Sellar, has passed by purchase into 
the hands of other heritors than those there mentioned. 

2. The population, from various causes, but chiefly from one 
already mentioned, has decreased from 917 to about 760. 

3. The real rental of the parish has increased fiom somewhat 
more than L.1300 to nearly L.4000 per annum. The aspect of 
the parish, both in a moral and natural point of view, has under- 
gone much improvement in the above-mentioned period. The 
people are less slovenly in their habits, and less superstitious in 
their sentiments, and better informed, better fed, clad, and housed 
than they formerly were, while many evils which then existed, 
such as smuggling, poaching, and plundering of wrecks, have al- 
most entirely ceased. If we glance at the external appearance of 
the parish, we find a still more visible amendment. Trees have 
been planted on all the larger estates ; and although such planta- 
tions are few and far between, and, in many cases, present but a 
stunted appearance from their exposure to the cold north-easterly 
gales, yet such spots of sombre green among the brighter hues of 
the corn-fields in summer tend much to vary the landscape, and to 
relieve the general tameness of the scenery. Much wet land has 
been drained, regularly fielded, and thus considerably increased in 
value and productiveness. In several parts of the parish, where 
heather held formerly undisputed possession, rich crops of grain 
are now produced. Some small farms, thus reclaimed from the 
barren waste, have doubled their rental every nineteen years. 
Several new and convenient lines of road have been constructed, 
and only require to be kept in good repair to be of great benefit 
to the parish and district. In particular, the present turnpike 
road from Peterhead to Fraserburgh has done much to facilitate

communication with these sea-ports, and to increase the value of 
agricultural produce, and consequently the rental of the land. 
To these may be added a manifest improvement in many of the 
farm-houses and steadings, though much remains to be done in 
this respect ; also in the rearing and breeding of horses and cattle ; 
in the quality of farm implements, particularly thrashing-mills ; 
and in the method of husbandry generally pursued.

I — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The name of the parish is said to be of Gaelic origin, 
and to signify " the King's house." Tradition bears that a reli- 
gious house once existed near the site of the present church. 
. Mountain ranges, 4c— At the westerly extremity of the parish 
there is a range of high grounds,— the continuation of the Auch- 
medden ridge, and of those high grounds which, crossing the ad- 
joining parish of New Deer, form a part of the eminences skirting 
the western extremity of Buchan. Those eminences in the lower 
part of the parish seem, in fact, to be continuations of the Hill of 
Mormond, distant only about three miles. 

Meteoroloff2/.~In the spring and summer months, a dense cloud 
charged often with the electric fluid, is frequently seen hoverin 
over that range of high lands terminating in the Auchmedden ridge" 
and, after hanging in collected masses for a while, it generally 
breaks mto two divisions, one of which branches off in a south- 
easterly direction towards Mormond, the other traversing the waters 
of the Moray Frith,-each dissipating itself in copious falls of rain 

Hydroffraphy.~We can boast of many and valuable springs' 
copious perennial, salubrious, spread abroad with a lavish hand 
through a 1 the parish, and adapted to the necessary wants and 
accommo ations of the people. Many of them are of a tonic

of iron. There are two streamlets, — the one running south- 
east, in the upper part of the parish, is one of the tributaries 
of the river Ugie, which flows into the sea near to the town 
of Peterhead ; but, so long as it continues with us, it is but a 
puny stream, flowing generally with a sluggish pace. The other 
streamlet has one or two of its fountains on the eastern side of the 
elevated grounds which bisect the parish. In a natural amp u- 
theatre, scooped out, it may be, by some convulsion of the e e- 
ments, and protected from every blast that blows, there bubbles 
forth from a grassy knoll a most copious stream, denominated the 
Mourning or Murnan Well, the waters of which, in conjunction 
with other streams, finally merge in those waters which constitute 
the rivulet of Philorth, as it falls into the sea about two miles south 
of Fraserburgh. 

Geology and Mineralogy.— li may be said that the course of the 
discoverable strata lies in a north-easterly direction, and that Us 
dip is at an angle of about 45°. The ascertained strata are either 
composed of gravel or sand, or clay, sometimes pure, sometimes 
mixed and it is, for the most part, imbedded on a basis of gra- 
nite rock. There is a species of rotten rock of the clayish mica 
kind held tocrether bv a cement of crusted ferruginous sand, aris- 
ing in the adjoining parish of Pitsligo, entering this one on its 
northern frontier, opposite to the church, traversing it m a south- 
erly direction for about a mile, dipping occasionally, and finally 
losing itself at the base of one of the eminences which protrudes 
from the mountainous range formerly mentioned. This species of 
rock unfit for any kind of building, is adapted solely for road- 
making ; but the difficulty and consequent expense of quarrying 
render it ineligible even for this purpose. On this strata of rock, 
however, is deposited the richest land in the parish. 

On the eastern extremity of the parish, there a l'niesto"e 
quarry, formerly wrought, but now disused, owing to the difficulty 
and expense of extracting the under-ground accumulating water. 
This vein of limestone is only a small branch of that great strato 
which, originating in the rocks on the shores of the Moray Fnth, 
close by Kinnai'd's Head, traverses, in a south-westerly irec- 
tion parts of the parishes of Fraserburgh, Rathen, and Tyne, 
Tping occasionally, underlying the foundations of Mormon , 
exhibiting itself afterwards at the lime quarries of Str.chen, and 
" g° till its way in the same direction far into the interior oj 
he country. The breadth of the strata of limestone, from the

place where it manifests itself in this parish to where it terminates 
in Rathen, may be estimated to be about three or four miles. 

The great strata of granite rocks pursue the same south-west- 
erly course. The stone itself is composed of quartz, shorl, fel- 
spar, and mica, — the last, however, in very minute quantities. It 
is of a pale-grayish hue. Examples of it are found in all shades 
of formation, from the loose and uncompressed to the closely 
packed and the firmly-cemented blocks, capable of receiving the 
finest polish, and adapted for the most durable buildings. Oc- 
casional blocks of granite are discoverable in every valley ; but 
they most frequently appear to form the frame-work on which 
are deposited all the superincumbent strata of the mountain- 
ous range bisecting the parish, and also the greater part of 
the massy plains, &amp;c. of the upper part. The granite quar- 
ries which have been opened, furnish blocks of about ten tons 
weight; but what farther sizes might be procured it is impossible 
to say, without deeper excavations than what have been hitherto 
made. The stones already procured have been obtained with com- 
parative ease, and consequently with comparatively little expense. 
From these quarries have been taken the materials for building 
great part of the dressed work of the pier of the harbour of Fra- 
serburgh, and for the ornamental work of the modern buildings of 
that town, as well as of those in our more immediate neighbour- 
hood. Such a trade, if we may call it a trade, has been a" source 
of some revenue to the proprietor, and to several industrious arti- 
sans and labourers; and, as long as the facility of transportation, 
furnished by means of the adjoining turnpike road to Fraserburo-h 
exists, combined with the little cost in clearing away the superln' 
cumbent rubbish or soil, and the easiness of quarrying, and the 
httle expense of dressing, owing to the comparative softness of the 
tone when newly quarried,so long will, in all probability, such a 
source of i-evenue to the proprietor continue. Iron undoubtedly 
we have ; but not in sufficient quantity to render it a profitable 
speculation to embark in the process of smelting it 

Mossy soils we have in vast abundance. With a few solitary

Staple, nay, almost sole species of grain, and for the growth of tur- 
nips and potatoes, which, in favourable years, it grows in great 
abundance. A powerful auxiliary to the other kinds of manure, 
which our vicinity to the sea enables us to command, has been 
found in the bone manure, which is suited to the generality of our 
soil, and of which a considerable quantity is annually imported. 
A vast quantity of herring refuse and of sea-dogs, the livers of 
the last of which are converted, by the thrifty farmers' wives, into 
oil for the replenishing of their winter's evening lamps, are also 
annually brought into the parish. 

Botany.— Oviv plantations are few. Placed m small, irregular, 
insulated patches or in narrow continuous beltings amounting, 
however, in whole to about 270 acres, 40 of which have been 
planted since 1826, at the rate of 7000 trees per acre, thus giv- 
ing at an average, since 1826, 21,000 trees annually, in the vi- 
cinity of New Pitsligo, in the upland district of this parish, expos- 
ed, from their elevated and unprotected position, to every blast 
thit blows, yet the trees have made tolerable progress. They 
prove that ash, plane, fir, aller, mountain-ash, the constituent trees 
of these plantations, are fitted to grow in this country. 

11. — Civil History. 
Eminent iV/en.— The first individual connected with this parish, 
where history and fate possesses any degree of public notoriety 
and interest, is Mr Forbes of Boyndlie, a scion of the noble family 
of Pitsligo, the first possessor and builder of the first house of

2 His descendant, John Forbes of Boyndlie, was taken pri- 
soner on the 12th September 1644 at the battle of Aberdeen, by 
the celebrated Montrose; but was liberated shortly after on his 
parole of honour, to return in case he could not, along with his 
liberated fellow-prisoner, by the united influence with the Cove- 
nan e , procure the liberty of the young Laird of Drum, and a so 
under the provisionary generous clause not to return m case his

honourable man died in peace and in honour at an advanced aoe, 
at his chateau in Cremar. 

3. Mr John Forbes, second son of Sir William Forbes of Mo- 
nymusk, resided at Pitfichie near the Hill of Bennachie, but pur- 
chased the estate of Ladysford in this parish ; was out in 1715 ; 
occupied the official station of collector of cess for the rebel army l 
was, after the issue of that ill-planned and timidly executed enter- 
prise, obliged to leave his native country, embarking, after having 
collected what property he had time to realize, on board of a ves- 
sel bound for Holland ; but was heard of no more. Suspicions 
arose that he had not received fair play at the hands of the crew, 
as one of them was seen a few years after, wearing a part of the 
dress which an aged and attached servant of the family recognized 
as having once belonged to her master. He left a widow, with a 
family of ten or more children ; but He who provides for the wi- 
dow and the fatherless in their afflictions, raised up friends and 
protectors to them, and, in course of time, one of his daughters was 
married to her cousin, Sir William Forbes, and from her is descend- 
ed the present family of the Baronet of Pitsligo. 

4. Connected with this parish, though not by birth or burial, 
yet certainly by occasional residence, was the venerable and at- 
tainted Lord Pitsligo, whose memory is still cherished, and whose, 
hair-breadth escapes from the hands of his pursuers are dwelt upon 
with enthusiasm by those dwelling amidst the scenes of his wander- 
ings and perils,— whose piety is attested by the thoughts which he 
has left,— and whose character and history are embodied in that 
interesting record which his relative, Lord Medwyn, has recently 
drawn up and made public. 

5. Connected, too, with this parish by property are the Earl of 
Aberdeen, Lord Saltoun, and the late Sir William Forbes, the au- 
thor of the Life of Beattie. These are, indeed, historical person- 
ages. The annals of diplomacy and of state policy will immortalize 
the name of the first ; the history of the campaigns of the Penin- 
sula under Sir John Moore and the Duke of Wellington, and the

Antiquities.-.A few years ago, there was standmg, n. the m- 
,.,ediate vicinity of the church, a sort of cn-cular mound, called 
the Moat, the work of a very remote era, but at what time, or for 
vhat purpose erected, we do not pretend to conjecture. 

Barrows or tumuli we possess, as well as other mu.or mdications 
of battles and frays fought in our neighbourhood. Connected ap- 
Lently with the authenticated coast-w.se hue of march of the

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — Vast, indeed, have been the improvements made 
within the last twenty years, in the reclaiming of waste, and the 
draining of wet lands. These improvements have been carried 
on by almost every farmer, but the principal have been the 
result of the exertions of a number of poor families, located on 
various pendicles of what was once a vast and unproductive surface 
of moor and moss. An extensive colony of these are in our im- 
mediate neighbourhood, and we have had many opportunities of 
witnessing their exertions. The parents of twenty-nine families, 
containing 156 individuals, who would have otherwise been held 
down in the most abject misery, or been eventually thrown as 
burdens on their respective parishes, have been empowered, under 
the blessing of God, to bring up their families in comparative 
comfort, and to look forward to comparative independence under 
the approaching infirmities of age. It must be confessed, that 
the experiment of this cottage or portionary allocation is as yet 
n Its mfancy, and its ultimate results cannot yet be properly fore- 
seen One great means of guarding against any apprehended evils 
would be, to extend the duration of the present leases, nineteen 
years and all leases for that period are bv far too short, and 
are obstacles to improvement, to three nineteen years at the 
least, taking care, however, at the expiry of each nineteen year., 
0 secure the interest of the landlord by a new valuation of the 
and at a rent to be affixed by two scientific agriculturists mutual- 
ly chosen. 

The general course of rotation is a seven years' shift, and, in some 
0 .tary instances, an eight years' one, and these are carried out with 
pmt upon the most approved system of husbandry, with the excep- 
rnin T'" " " trenching, previous to the preparation fir

miserably cultivated fields, scattered here and there on the moor 
and moss, and, from its connection with the history of that unfor- 
tunate nobleman, it presents a scene of historical interest and as- 
sociations. It was only about the year 1790 that its ancient name 
of Cavoch was transformed into its modern one of New Pitsligo, 
and that the former external aspect of the scene around it be- 
gan to change, for about that year the village was founded; and 
it has, through the persevering industry of its inhabitants, been 
increasing year after year, till it has reached its present popu- 
lation of 1262. One great cause of its increase has been the 
cheapness of fuel furnished from the inexhaustible mass of moss 
around it, and the attachment to every feu of a few acres of 
arable ground, with abundance of reclaimable land given by the 
proprietor on a lease of two nineteen years, thus affording from 
the produce of their land the means of subsistence to their fami- 
lies, and tempting many an industrious labourer and mechanic 
to settle there, from the prospect of steady employment, and 
an adequate remuneration for his toil. In fact, its present inha- 
bitants, with the exception of ninety employed in the manufacture 
of cotton and of iinen cloth, derive their livelihood from the pro- 
duce of their small allotments of land, or from undertaking agri- 
cultural jobs to their neighbours, or the farmers in the adjoining 
districts. Of late years, the proprietor has ceased to give off new 
feus, and therefore the village may be said, independent of other 
causes, to have reached its greatest size. Its police is under the 
«upermtendence of the proprietor's factor. 

Means of Communication.— The only post-office in the parish 
.s .n the village of New Pitsligo ; and there is a daily mail-baa 
dispatched from it. There are about eight miles of turnpike road 
in the parish. 

Ecclesinslical 5ae.— Situated about three miles from the east- 
ern end of the parish, about seven from its western, two and a-half 
or three miles from its southern, and about 200 yards from its 
northern the parish church could ixoi have well accommodated all 
within the bounds of the united parish ; but now that the people 
•n the upper district have been detached from it, it is well enough 
.tuated for the comfort and convenience of all in the lower dis, 
"ct. It was built in 1800 ; is a neat and substantial edifice, kept 
n admirable repair ; made to contain with ease 400 persons al 

e"tfree. 1 he public benefactions were bequeathed by Major

Phillips and William Anderson. The nr.anse was built in 1763, 
and was augmented in 1809. The glebe measures 4| acres in- , 
eluding site of manse, ofRces, and garden, and may be worth about 
L.8 or L.9 Sterling. The stipend is L.150. 

For the accommodation of the people m the village of New 
Pitsligo and the adjacent lands, whom the distance of six miles 
from the parish church precluded from regular and convenien at- 
tendance, and from the benefit of a constant pastoral supennten- 
dence, a Chapel of Ease was erected by the proprietor in the above 
viUag ; and a district of the parish, amounting to about four miles 
long, by two and a half or three miles broad, was attached to it. 
And in accordance with the recent Act of the General Assem-- 
bly, he district assigned to this Chapel of Ease has been erected 
■2 a parish ,uoad spiritualia. This Chapel o Ease conins 
about 400. The stipend of the minister amounts to L.80 Ster- 
ling, and is paid by the proprietor, who has also given a manse, 
and a glele of about 18 acres. One Episcopa chapel, a new 
and elegant building in the Gothic style, capable of containing 
about 260, has been recently erected by the proprietor, aud its 
clergyman's stipend, L.80 Sterling, is paid by the same, who has 
also furnished a portion of land for a glebe.

that of the Baptists; who, however, only occasionally meet in the

That sum has been divided in proportions suitable, as far as 
can be judged, to their respective necessities, among 87 poor per- 
sons, 69 of whom were on the ordinary and permanent poor's roll, 
and who have 18 dependents on them ; while other 18 are only 
occasionally supplied with aid. It must be adverted to, that almost 
all are able to do something for themselves by means of their per- 
sonal industry, and that there is a silent active spirit of charity 
abroad in the parish, which contributes to eke out a subsistence tu 
the necessitous. There is also a very considerable relief afforded 
to many poor families by the distribution from the proprietor's gir- 
nal at New Pitsligo of seventy-two bolls of meal, at the rate of one- 
half peck per week to each individual. This charily, furnished 
by the liberality of Sir John S. Forbes and his ancestors, is, how- 
ever, confined to indigent and decayed feuars of that village. 

Fairs, Inns, Alehouses, c— Four cattle-markets are annually 
held at New Pitsligo, and each of these uniformly takes place in 
the months of March, May, August, and September. A fort- 
nightly corn-market has been recently established there. There 
are two respectable inns and six alehouses in New Pitsligo.

though there be now and then found a few almost perpendicular 
to the horizon. The broken pieces have corresponding juttings 
out, and openings, evidently shewing that they had been originally 
united. The spaces between are often filled with gravelly matter, 
which had originally been lower than the slate. Sometimes other 
earthy matter crosses the slate. Blocks of slate are sometimes 
found at considerable distances from the masses to which they origi- 
nally belonged. 

The slate in both the hills of Culsamond and Foudland, at a 
certain depth, is of a fine blue colour, but the Culsamond slate 
is considered heavier and more durable. Great quantities are 
taken from both hills annually, and sent to considerable distances. 
No good slate has hitherto been found in Culmeaddin Hill. It 
is a curious circumstance, that none of these cubical, pale, brassy- 
coloured, crystallized pyrites, so pleniiful in the Easdale slate, 
and in the slate in the west side of Foudland, have as yet been 
found either in the slate on the east side of Foudland, or in the 
Culsamond slate. In the Melross slate they are found. Those 
on thewest side of Foudland are in a rotten state, being composed 
mostly of iron, which rots sooner than copper. 

It may be observed here, that of the beds of rock which run 
through Culsamond, the slate-rock is the first on the north, and 
that it comes as far south as the northmost part of the Kirktown 
Farm. This is succeeded by the Waukmill Bluestone Quarry, 
without any split, as the masons call it. There is then, still going 
south, a small bed of limestone, which is workable, and has been 
burned above Largie, to the west, in the parish of Insch, and, 
what is remarkable, at the same distance from the slate-rock as 
it is found on the sea-coast south of Troup, near the Melross 
slate-quarry. South of this limestone bed, the ironstone begins 
at a place called the Lady's Causeway, and extends to the south 
of the farm of Meikle Ledingham, in this parish. This is the 
ironstone direction, north and south. On the west, it extends 
beyond Dunnideer, in Insch, and east, through Culsamond, Rayne, 
and Daviot. Between this ironstone rock and the granite of 
Benochee the southern boundary of the Garioch, is another bed 
of limestone, which was worked near Likelyhead, in the parish of 
i'remnay. It is observable that these beds h ave been deranged 
111 many places, so that they do not always appear in the same di- 
rection, the dislocated parts being filled up with stones of a dif-

ferent nature, a plain proof of violent convulsions in the bowels of 
the earth at some period. 

Alluvial Sand.-On the farm of Pulquhite is found, at various 
depths below the surface of the ground, from 6 mches to 35 inches, 
a bed of rough sand, evidently broken down, and formed of Be- 
nochee granite, and deposited there by the agency of vater, in 
which it had previously been suspended. 

Mountain Subterranean Moss.-On the northern part of the 
ame farm, at a place now called Mutton Hillock, is a moss about 
three feet below the surface of the ground, extending to the dis- 
tance of 30 or 40 yards from north to south, and, in some places, 
more than 8 feet deep. The superincumbent soil has been brought 
from a distance after the formation of the moss, as it consists ot 
a variety of materials,-coarse gravel, flint stones, of which an 
immense quantity is dispersed over a great part of the Ganoeh, 
and stones of various sizes and kinds, some of them fragments 
of slate-stone from the adjoining hill of Culsamond. The field 
in which the moss alluded to is found, is a plane inclined to the 
south-east, and the slate-rock is to the north-west of it. It may 
therefore be inferred, that the direction of the great mass of water 
which superinduced this disposition was from north-west to south- 

""onstones and Iron-ore.-A considerable quantity of iron- 
stones are found on or near the surface of the ground, and also a 
large vein of ironstone stretches from west to east, through the 
whole length of the district, passing through the parishes of Insch, 
Culsamond, and Rayne. Some of the blocks were sent to Car- 
ton, and, it is said, produced plenty of good iron. The water 
which runs over these iron-rocks carries away part of them, whicb 
it deposits in various hollow places, forming bog-iron ore. 

Bog-Iron Ore.-M the bottom of the inclined plane already 
flientioned, there were found, in cutting a ditch, about eight feet 
below the surface, large quantities of this swamp-iron ore mixed 
with pulverized oak-wood, part of it in various stages of decompo- 
sition. The mixture was of a beautiful light blue colour, m con- 
sequence of the decayed wood being impregnated with the iron. 
: Mineral Well at Saughenloan.-Some years ago, a mineral wdl 
was discovered here, but it has not as yet been much frequente • 
It is said to have been of use in scrofulous complaints and in cal- 
cuius.

Heritors. — Of these there are five ; Gordon of Newton ; Fra- 
ser of Williamston ; Leith Lumsden, of Tullymorgan ; Gammel 
of Sheelagreen ; and Leith of Cairnhill. The valued rent of the 
parish is L.'2100 Scots, the real rent supposed to be upwards of 
L.4000 Sterling. In 1790, it was rated at L.1150. 
• Antiquities. — There is, in this parish, part of an ancient high- 
'way. It crosses the hill of Culsamond, near its top, from the 
north-west, and had formerly been the road which people took 
when travelling on their way to St Lawrence Fair, at Old Rayne. 
It still retains the name of the Lawrence Road, and is, to all ap- 
pearance, nearly in the same state in which it had originally been, 
many hundred years ago. In times long since past, when the 
woods were haunted by ferocious wild beasts, and the valleys over- 
run with rivers and swamps, it was dangerous to travel in lotv-lying 
grounds. Hence, the most ancient roads traversed the tops of the 
hills, and, from this circumstance, were properly termed highways. 

There appear to have been at least three sacred fountains in this 
parish ; St Mary's Well, on the farm of Colpie ; St Michael's, at 
Gateside ; and another, at the foot of the Culsamond Bank, a little 
west of the Lady's Causeway. On the first Sunday of May, mul- 
titudes resorted to them from distant parts, in the full faith that, 
by washing in the stream, and leaving presents to the saints, as 
their heathen ancestors did to the spirit presiding over the well, 
they would becuredof all loathsome or otherwise incurable diseases. 
Pieces of money were always, accordingly, left in the wells, corre- 
sponding to the ability of the diseased person. In digging a drain, 
at the foot of the bank, some years ago, when the workman struck 
his pick into the bottom of the well which had been there, a large 
quantity of water sprung up into the atmosphere, in which he ob- 
served a shining substance, which proved to be a gold piece of 
James L of Scotland, in as good preservation as when it came 
from the mint. It is now in the Freefield Cabinet. 

The standing-stone in the woods of Newton, near Pitmachie, 
Has an inscription upon it, supposed to be in Runic characters. 
Some drawings of it have been published in the Monthly Maga- 
zine, and also by Pinkerton, but they are far from being accurate. 
There is another standing-stone, near the house of Newton, with 
figures upon it. , 

Several arrow heads and axes have been found in this parish and 
neighbourhood. In one of the cairns on the farm of Moss-side, 



732 ABKRDEENSHIRE. 

in this parish, was found a large stone-axe, whicli is now in the 
possession of Sir A. Leith of Freefield. These axes were of 
different sizes, and made of different kinds of stone. A small one 
of flint was found in the parish of Insch about 1827, and is now 
in the Freefield cabinet. The finest were of flint. They were 
used by our Celtic ancestors, in ages long prior to the Roman in- 
vasion, as battle-axes, spears, or tools for domestic purposes. 
The largest were generally made of coarse, but very hard, grey- 
stone, for home use. The smallest were manufactured from the 
finest flint, and used as warlike instruments, and in different ways. 

Druidical 7 empZes.— Two of these were on the farm of Colpie, 
although now almost obliterated. Several urns were dug up in 
making a road near one of them. 

A Druidical place of worship anciently stood on the spot which 
is now the church-yard or burying-ground, and about the middle 
of it. It consisted of a circle of twelve upright large granite 
stones from Benochee, which were overturned when the first 
Christian temple was erected. One of these stones was taken 
out of the ground in 1821, and now remains above ground, near 
the spot from which it was dug up. The other eleven are still 
under ground. This is a proof that the first Christian missionaries, 
in this country, erected their places of worship as near as possible 
to the holy hills of the heathens, that the people might be more 
easily persuaded to assemble there. In digging out the foundation 
stones of an ancient but small building, to which the last kirk of 
Culsamond had been attached, there were found below them, side 
by side, and at right angles with the wall, the skeletons of two 
men in perfect preservation. This happened in the year 1821, 
when the new kirk-yard dikes were building. 

Burial Cairns.— Oi these there were, at one time, a considerable 
number. There are several on Cairnhill, on the north-east side 
of Pulquhite ; two on Moss-side, on opening one of which the 
stone axe, already mentioned, was found; one on Mellingside; 
one near Gateside ; and two on Colpie. The one on Moss-side 
and another at Gateside have not been opened. But the most re- 
markable one was discovered on the farm of Mill of Williamston 
i„ the month of May 1812, in an enclosure called the Liav-park 
Saxon Law-hillock Park. In preparing a field for turnip, the 
nlou-h, at a spot from which a large cairn of stones and moss haa 
boen°removed about thirty years before, struck against something 
which impeded its progress. On examination, this proved to be a 



CULSAMOND. 



733 



wooden coffin of nncommon size, and of the rudest conceivable 
workmanship. It had been formed from the trunk of a huge oak, 
divided into three parts of unequal length, each of which had been 
split through the middle with wedges and stone axes, or perhaps 
separated with some red hot instrument of stone, as the in- 
side of the different pieces had somewhat the appearance of 
having been charred. The whole consisted of six parts, two sides, 
two gavels, a bottom, and a lid. Only a small part of the lid re- 
mained, the greater part of it having been splintered and torn up 
by the plough at different times since the removal of the stones 
and moss. All the rest of the pieces were entire, and, when put 
together in their original position, had somewhat the appearance 
of the body and shafts of a cart. The coffin lay due east and west, 
— the head of it being in the east end of the grave. The sides 
were sunk into the ground 13 inches below the bottom piece. In 
the middle of them, were grooves of rough and incomplete work- 
manship, and of the same length as the length of the bottom, and 
a very little wider than the thickness of the bottom. Under the 
bottom was a bed of tough blue clay three and a half inches thick, 
on which and on these grooves it rested. The projecting parts of 
the sides rested on a hard oval substance, much mixed with ashes 
which had undergone the action of a very strong fire, and on 
which part of the grave evidently had been erected the funeral pile. 
The gavel pieces were sunk into large holes, and the empty spaces 
around them filled up with fine blue sand. In a corner of the in- 
side of the coffin was an urn, which was broken in the digging out. 
It had been formed of a mixture of clay and sand, narrowest at the 
bottom, very wide at the top, and about ten or eleven inches deep. 
After the different pieces were placed in the grave in their proper 
order, it appears to have been surrounded with a double row of 
unhewn stones to keep the parts firm together, and then covered 
over with the moss and stones formerly mentioned. This antiquity 
must probably be referred to a period prior to the Christian era. 

British Camp.— On the north-east side of the Hill of Culsamond 
are the remains of a British encampment, protected on the north- 
west side of the hill by double lines of entrenchment, still very dis- 
tinct. These lines are in the immediate neighbourhood of a farm 
town named Cadden, which name signifies warlike entrenchments, 
or a place where soldiers had been stationed to watch the motions of 
an invading enemy. There are also still distinct traces of mili- 
tary works on the west bank of the glen water opposite to Cadden. 



734 ABERDEENSHIRK. 

Lines of entrenchment are also still visible on the east side of tlie 
hill and camp to protect it on that quarter; and, about two and a- 
half miles north of this British camp is the Roman camp at Glen- 
meallin, enclosing about 120 English acres. The Romans, in 
their march northward, had a camp at Devana, on the north side 
of the Dee, in the parish of Peterculter. They must have had 
also a fort or camp on the eastmost top of Benochee, about twelve 
miles from Devana. This is evident from the remains still visible 
upon the top, and the existence of a paved Roman road, 14 feet 
wide, which, though long covered with heath, has been traced for 
upwards of a mile to the north-east. This road points upon a small 
fortified post opposite to Pitcaple, placed apparently for the pro- 
tection of the Benochee camp, and there is another larger work on 
the summit of the Barra hill, near old Meldrum, to protect it from 
any attack from the east, and which, in all probability, as a cas- 
tellum, served also to protect the castra cpstiva at Glenmeallm. 

What was the exact direction of the route of the Romans from 
Devana to Benochee may admit of a dispute. Some think they 
marched on the right of Achlae, Fiddy, and Kinmundy, and from 
thence in a north north-west direction, till they reached Kmtore 
at Don, and thence by the strath of the river to the ford of Don 
at luverury, which is very near Benochee. Be this as it may, it is 
certain that they had a station on the eastern summit of Benochee.

PRESBYTERY OF K INCAKDINE o'nEIL, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. WILLIAM INGRAM, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The etyniology of Echt is not known with certainty. 
An old tradition refers it to the Gaelic word " Each," which sig 
nifies a horse. It bears that a division of an ancient Caledonian 
army having encamped in this parish, the officers and men, in the 
time of a severe drought, were reduced to great straits for want of 
water, when a horse which had been brought to the camp was 
seen to gallop to a spot where he had been accustomed to drink ; 
and that, by pawing and scratching with his feet, some signs of 
water were discovered ; in which spot, a well having been dug, af- 
forded relief from thirst to the army. In memory of that event, this 
particular district, and afterwards the parish, is said to have been 
designated by the above term. 

Extent, c— The parish of Echt lies west from Aberdeen, the 
eastern extremity nearly ten, and the western fourteen miles from 
that city. It is almost of a square form, each side about 4i miles. 
It is bounded on the east and north-east, by the parish of Skene ; 
on the south-east, by Peterculter and Drumoak ; on the south, by 
Banchory- Ternan; on the west and north-west, by Midmar; and 
on the north, by Cluny, 

Topographical Appearances.— The hill of Fare lies about one 
mile south-west from the church. The base of this mountain is near- 
ly eighteen miles in circumference, and its height about 1794 feet 
above the level of the sea. Its surface is now divided among the 
proprietors whose estates surround it, and contains 7700 aeries, 2 
roods, 29 falls imperial measure ; of which 1826 acres, 1 rood 4 
fails belong to this parish. Mr Forbes of Echt has a thriv- 
ing plantation of young firs on its north-east corner, and has 



736 ABERDEENSHIKE. 



formed another on its northern side. All kinds of game known 
in this country abound in the hill of Fare. Several chalybeate 
springs are found there which have been reckoned beneficial in 
scrofulous, scorbutic, and gravellish complaints. In the north- 
vrest corner of the parish stands the Barmekin, a conical hill, now 
entirely planted with wood. Its height is scarcely two-thirds of 
that of the hill of Fare. On its top is an ancient fortification, 
hereafter to be taken notice of. , v i 

The soil of the best lands in this parish is mostly a light loam, 
incumbent on a substratum of clay. Part is of a light sandy soil, 
and the low grounds for the most part mossy. The climate is 
mild, the harvests early, and the air salubrious. || 

II, — Civil History. 
The chief historical event relating to this district is the battle 
of Corrichie, which was fought on the 28th October 1562, in a 
vale of the same name, by the forces commanded by the Marquis 
of Huntly and the Earl of Murray, the brother and general of Mary 
Queen of Scots. This battle is taken notice of by most of the 
Scottish historians. It appears that the Marquis was offended at 
the Queen for bestowing the earldom of Murray on her brother 
the Earl of Mar, and for her intention of giving him a great part 
of those large and valuable northern estates which belonged to 
that earldom, several of which had been seized by the Marquis 
His son, Sir John Gordon, had escaped from the prison to which 
the Queen had sentenced him for some feudal outrage ; and had 
placed himself at the head of the vassals of his house,-soon after 
which, the Marquis assumed arms in person, and advanced towards 
Aberdeen. Murray drew up his men on the hill of Fare, and 
awaited the approach of Huntly with only a few troops from the 
midland counties on which he could depend, and some troops be- 
longing to the northern Barons, whose intentions were doubtful. 
Hultly encountered first the northern troops, who fled towards 
Moray's main body, pursued by the Gordons sword m hand 
The Gordons were repulsed by Murray's firm batlalion, and 1 . 
Itory was completed by the clans that had ed, hoturned u o 
the Gordons as soon as they began to lose the day. Hunt y, a 
I lu n .nd heavily armed, fell from his horse, and was trod- 



ECHT. 



737 



that his body was afterwards brought into a court of justice, mean- 
ly arrayed in a doublet of coarse canvas, that the sentence of a 
traitor might be pronounced over it. The Queen, who wa,s at 
Aberdeen during the battle, three days after beheld Sir John 
Gordon beheaded there. Murray was put in possession of the 
estates belonging to his new earldom. An excavation on the side 
of a rock, where it is said Mary sat soon after, and viewed the 
scene of action on her way south, still retains the name of the 
Queen's chair. 

Chief Land-owners. — James Forbes, Esq. of Echt is the prin- 
cipal and only residing heritor; William Innes, Esq. of Raemoir 
has the lands of Cullerley ; the Trustees of the late John Harvey, 
Esq. of Kinnettles, those of Bragiewell and South Meanecht, and 
the Earl of Fife, as heir to the late George Skene, Esq. of Skene, 
the lands of Mill of Air. The valued rent is as follows : Echt, 
Tillyshoggle, and Easter Echt, belonging to James Forbes, Esq. 
L. 1808, 8s. 8d. ; Cullerley, L.432, 19s. Id.; Bragiewell and S. 
Meanecht, L. 75, 13s. 9d. ; Mill of Air, L. 47, 13s. 6d.; total, 
L.2364, 15s. 

Parochial Begisters.— The oldest begins in 1642, and they ap- 
pear to have been regularly kept. They amount altogether to 
fourteen volumes. 

Antiquities.— On the Barmekin hill already mentioned, there 
is an ancient fortification, which is generally denominated a Da- 
nish camp. No record or tradition, however, confirms this sup- 
position. The entrenchments which enclose the summit of the hill 
are five in number, in a perfect state of preservation as far as regards 
the lines of fortification, though more or less crumbled into ruins. 
There is no appearance of cement having been used in construct- 
ing these ramparts, which, in several places, are still so entire as 
to exhibit a regular structure of inasonry done with skill, particu- 
larly at the gateways, of which there appear to have been three 
on the south side, and two on the north, all in an oblique direc- 
tion. The walls measure about five feet in thickness, the height 
appears to have been considerable, but cannot now be exactly 
known. The three outer ditches are nine feet in breadth. The 
inner rampart exhibits great care and strength in its structure, be- 
ing at least 12 feet thick at the base, of which several feet in 
neigtit still remain entire. The interior inclosure, which has 
inT " uniform level, and nearly circular, is 300 feet 

" aIerdee'n" contains about one acre of ground. On the 

3 4. 



738 ABEUDEENSHIUK. 

skirts of the hill, there are three cairns, two on the south and oiie 
on the north. The largest and most entire on the south side, now 
nearly covered with wood, was probably connected with the for- 
tress above, as an entrenchment or out-post ; and afterwards se- 
lected as the sepulchre of those chiefs who may have fallen m bat- 
tle The circular entrenchment formed by the earth dug out ot 
the ditch is 60 feet in diameter, surrounded by six great stones, 
■the remains most likely of an entire circle. In the centre is a 
cairn of loose stones supporting five large ones, which have all the 
appearance of sepulchral monuments. Besides these, there are 
three other cairns, and several tumuli in different parts of the pa- 
rish, and the remains of three Druidical temples. Oii the larm 
of Tilliorn, in the land of Cullerley, there is a large Pictish work 
in the form of a horse-shoe, hollowed out; but it is uncertain 
.hether it had been a fort, or a tank or cistern for holding water. 
It goes by the name of « Fusee." An ancient spear was lately 
dug up on the estate of Echt. It is now in the custody of Mr 
Forbes of Echt. It appears to be made of bell metal, is 2 feet 3 
inches in length, at the broadest part of the blade U nch m 
breadth, and weighs 4 lbs. 2 oz. Avoirdupois. 

Modern Buildings.-k spacious, elegant, and most commodi- 
ous mansion-house was built by the late William Forbes, Esq. o 
Echt in 1820, and finished by his son, the present proprietor, it 
stands near the site of the former mansion, in a park containing 
80 acres. The grounds are laid out with superior taste and as 
soon as the young trees have attained to a proper size, he eBect 
will be delightful. To promote this, and to obtain early shelter 
for the house, Mr Forbes has transplanted 145 large trees, on the 
plan of Sir Henry Steuart of Allanton, Bart. These trees con- 
S of oak, ash, beech, elm, geen, plum, lime, thorn and maple, 
. of which only /our or five have died. The size of the trees runs 
from 15 to 45 feet in height.

IV. — Industry. 
The number of arable acres in the parish, imperial measure, is 
about 6806. The number of acres that have never been cultivat- 
ed, about 7370. No land is in a state of undivided common. 
There were 144 acres under wood on the estate of Echt in the 
end of last century. Since the beginning of this century, the late 
and present proprietor have planted from 1500 to 2000 acres, 
consisting of the following kinds of trees, viz. Scotch fir, larch' 
spruce, oak, ash, elm, beech, alder, birch, plane, lime, maple, horse 
chestnut, and Spanish chestnut. A number of farms were under 
old leases of long duration, including the rentals of which, the ave 
rage rent of arable land per Scots acre would not exceed 15s 
Ihese leases are now worn out, and the average modern rent per 
acre may be about L.1, 15s. 

The common breeds of cattle are the Aberdeenshire and the 
short-horned or Teeswater. Few sheep are kept. The prevail- 
ing kinds are the Cheviot and black-faced. 

No parish in the county has undergone greater improvements 
m redarnmg aste land, inclosing, draining, roads, and farm- 
bui dings. The estate of Echt contains 11,000 imperial acre. 
nclud.ngl441 acres, 1 rood, 14 falls on the hill of Fare Of 
this quantity 5585 imperial acres are arable; and of these fuHv

1001 are arable, 89 meadow or haugh ground 296 moss, and 
1500 uncultivated, including its proportion of the hill of to. 
Improvement is going on there also with considerable spmt The 
duration of leases in this parish is generally "-fen years bu 
x.any of the old leases were double that extent. Most of the 
farms are substantially inclosed, and almost every farm-house is

proved exceedingly within the last forty years. The seven jea s

gins to be adopted at the rate of twenty-five bushels « he acre, 
Id it succeeds well. Some farms are in a high state of im-

On the roads here, there are nine small bridges in good repair. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is nearly centrical, and 
is convenient for the greater part of the population. It was built 
in 1804, is in good repair, and very commodious. When full 
it will hold 600 people ; and from 450 to 500 usually attend. 
The inhabitants are all of the Established Church, excepting ten 
or twelve individuals, and are regular and decent in their attend- 
ance on Divine ordinances, and generous and kind to the poor. 
The average number of communicants is about 500. No Dissent- 
ing or Seceding chapels in the parish. One of the farmers acts as 
an Anabaptist clergyman to a very few members of that persuasion. 

The manse was built in 1805, substantially finished, and suit- 
able for the incumbent. The living consists of L.117, Os. 4|d, 
in money, including the allowance for communion elements; 88 
bolls 1 firlot oatmeal, at 140 imperial pounds to the boll; 4 bolls, 
2 firlots, 2| pecks bear, Aberdeenshire measure ; and I firlot 2| 
pecks malt. The teinds are valued and exhausted. The glebe 
measures little more than 4 acres, is not all of good quality, and 
would barely rent at L. 1 0 per annum. There is no grass glebe, nor 
any allowance for it. The Earl of Fife is patron. The present 
incumbent was translated from South Ronaldshay, in Orkney, and 
settled here in March 1815. 

Education.— There is one parochial school, and two private 
schools. One of the latter is supported by an yearly salary of 
L.5, paid by the proprietor of Cullerley, and by the school-fees. 
The other private school is supported by the schooLfees alone. 
Placed at the northern extremity of the district, the scholars are 
chiefly derived from the east end of Cluny, and the west end of 
hkene. Ihe salary of the parochial teacher is L.29, and nearly 
L.2 ansmg from mortified money. The school-fees may amount, 
communibus annis, to L. 1 8 or L.20. He has a house and garden 
01 the legal size. He receives a proportion of Mr Dick's leo-acv 
Poor and Parochial Funds.-The funds destined for the'sup- 
port ot the poor arise from the interest of the following sums, viz. 
1.300 accumulated from the savings of former years, except two

<p>

I'RESBYTERY OF GARIOCH, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. JOHN KEITH, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural Hj story. 
Name. — Kiljthhall became the name of .the parish after the 
greater part of it was possessed by Keith, the Earl Marischal of 
Scotland. It was anciently called Montkeggie. Kinkell was a 
parsonage of seven parishes, and retains the ancient name, which 
signifies the head or principal church. The annexation was in 
1754. 

Extent. — The length of the parish is about 5 miles, and the 
breadth is rather less, but very unequal. It contains 11 square 
miles. 

Boundaries. — The rivers Don and Ury form the boundary with 
Kintore and Inverury. The parish adjoins Chapel of Garioch, 
Bourty, Udny, New Machar and Fintry. The figure is irre- 
gular. 

The best land is either loam or alluvial. Very little of it ex- 
ceeds two feet in depth. The inferior consists of almost every 
variety, with the exception of marl. There is no less diversity in 
the subsoil. The worst is a hardened mixture of gravel and clay. 

The plantations are of beech, elm, ash, oak, plane, Scotch fir, 
and pine. The larch and oak do not grow freely. The others 
are of considerable size in the policies of Keithhall, the seat of 
the Earl of Kintore. At Balbithan, there is a very large beech, 
remarkable for its straight and branchless trunk, which is 24 feet 
high, with only two branches at 30 feet. Its average circum- 
ference at that height exceeds 12 feet. Seven boughs rise from 
It, each 21 feet in diameter, to an altitude of 50 feet ; and the 
lateral extent of some is not much less. 

. II- — Civil History. 

Eminmt Men.-Caskieben, the ancient name of the estate of 
Keithhall, was the birth -place of the distinguished scholar, Arthur 
Johnston. He was born in 1587, and died at the age of fifty-four- 



I 



744 



ABERDEENSHIRE. 



Kinkell is the burial-place of a distinguished warrior who fell 
at Harlaw, as appears from a monumental stone, with the figure ■ 
of a knight in armour, and an inscription on the outer part m old 
English characters:— "Hie jacet nobilis armiger Gualterus de 

Gre 1411." The other part of it has been destroyed. 

Land-owners.— The Earl of Kintore is proprietor of about 
three-fourths of the united parishes. Balbithan, the propertr of 
Benjamin Abernethy Gordon, Esq. forms an eighth part. Km- 
muck, which is rather less, belongs to Alexander Irvme, Esq. of 
Drum. The Synod of Aberdeen hold in trust the small estate of 
Newplace, which rents about L. 80 ; and the Society of Friends 
or Quakers are proprietors of three acres, on which they have a 
meeting-house and cemetery. 

Parochial Registers.— The register of births, or rather bap- 
tisms in Keithhall, has been kept pretty regularly since 1678; but 
the oldest of them are a little frail. It is doubtful whether there 
were ever any similar registers for Kinkell. 

Antiquities.— The antiquities in this quarter have suffered 
much from the ploughshare and the erection of stone fences. 
The cairns or mounds raised to commemorate ancient heroes 
and events have been broken down; and the place of the Drm- 
dic temples that stood in the end of last century is now un- 
masked, with one exception, where a single stone remains, nearly 
two and a-half feet square and seven feet high. It is remark- 
able that the corn grows very luxuriant around this solitary pillar 
to a distance of fifteen yards, and has always been eighteen 
inches higher than the crop immediately beside it. 

Part of an encampment still remains in the moor of Kmmuck, 
• where tradition records that a great battle took place between the 
Danes and the Scotch. The latter are said to have slain a boar m 
their advance, and hence the name Kinmuck, or boais head. 1 he 
place of combat bears the name of Blair Hussey, or field ofbbod. 

Id a laro-e barrow or tumulus, about eighty yards from a Dru- 
idic stone,\ chance visitor observed an urn partially uncovered. 
It was found to contain calcined bones. Two larger urns were 
subsequently found in a reversed position to the other, and we e 
taken out i J fragments. The bones in all the three were put into 
a box, and buried in the original spot. • 

The residence of the Earl of Kintore, genera l y denomi ated 
the house of Keithhall, of which the castle of the Johnstons form 
a small part, is a very magnificent luildmg.

The number of unmarried men 50 years of age and upwards, is 28 

women upwards of 45, . . 40 

The resident heritors are the Earl of Kintore, and Balbithan. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — The land under tillage is nearly 5000 acres. 
The waste land is about 2000. Of this a third part might be 
advantageously improved. About 400 acres are planted. 

Average rent of land in cultivation is 14s. per acre. 

The sheep are of the South Down, Leicester, and Scotch 
breeds. Several farmers have superior cattle, chiefly of the old 
Aberdeenshire breed. Lord Kintore has long had a very select 
stock of Ayrshire and short-horn or Teeswater cows and bulls, 
and is very indulgent to his tenantry in this matter. The Keithhall 
ox, as one of his Lordship's bullocks was called, was for some time 
one of the greatest wonders in the north of Scotland. This animal 
carried the first premium at the Highland Society's show in 1834, 
was sold at seven years of age for one hundred sovereigns, and cer- 
tainly was one of the hugest animals ever seen in the shambles. 
The gross weight of the bullock alive was 1 ton 8 cwt. or 
3136lbs. 

There has been a considerable extent of waste land reclaimed 
within a short time. The duration of leases is nineteen years. 

All the turf-covered houses have disappeared. A few of the 
farmers have their houses slated, and the others are neatly thatch- 
ed. The enclosures are mostly of stone. Lord Kintore brought 
a hedger from Berwickshire, a few years ago, and has planted 
hedges of hawthorn on several farms. 

None of the proprietors give any encouragement for improving 
waste ground. Only two or three individuals have accepted the 
terms of one who advances money at seven and a-half per cent, on 
that security.

v.— Parochial Economy. 
Inverury is the nearest market-town, and only a quarter of a 
mile from the west boundary. The post-office is in that burgh. 

There are two bridges on the Ury ; one of stone, which has 
been built upwards of thirty years ; the other has stone piers and 
a wooden arch, and was built lately. 

Ecclesiastical State.-The parish church is in the most centn- 
cal situation, as ascertained by measurement. It was built m 
1771, repaired last in 1823, and holds 600 persons. The seats 
are all free. The manse was built in 1772; the last addition 
was made only two years ago. The glebe is 25 English 
acres, and would rent for L.30, if let to a farmer; but when the 
greater part is in grass, as at present, it is of more value. The 
stipend is L. 110, 10s. ld.; meal, 112 bolls, 8 stones, 9, lbs.; 
bear, 20 quarters, 3 bushels, 1 peck, U quart; barley, 5 quarters, 
6 bushels, 2 pecks, and 3 quarts. 

The Society of Friends have a meeting-house at Kinmuck. 
Their number in 1831 was 16 persons. . , , , • 

The number of families who attend the Established Church is 
1 68 ; and persons of all ages. 650. There are 13 Dissenters and 
8 Episcopalians. Due attendance is given in the church and the 
number of communicants is 430. The yearly amount of church 

collections is L. 45. • _ 

Education.- At the parochial school, Latin, geography, gram- 
mar, arithmetic, writing, and reading are taught The lo 
branches are taught at the unendowed schoo , wUh the ad .t 
of needle- work. The salary of the schoolmaster is L. 30 , fees m 
1833, L.15; other emoluments, L.25; and his whole income 
L 65, besides the legal accommodations. 

■ All between six and fifteen years of age either can read or are 
under tuition; none above the higher age are known to be unable- 

The" only library is one for the Sabbath scholars. 

pl'.-Paupers; at an average, are 17 in number; and the sup- 
„lv fo each, L. 4. Church collections during the year for the 
fllsH sr:-, and for charitable purposes, L. 10 ; legacies, dona-

Alehouses. — There is no public-house in the parish ; but there 
is a spirit shop on the lands of the synod of Aberdeen. 

Puel. — The fuel is of peat and turf, the expense of preparing 
which is Is. the cart-load. 

Geneual Observations. 
The greatest variations observable, within the last forty years, 
are in the value of houses and enclosures, which has risen from 
L. 150 to above L. 3000 ; and in the ordinary provision for the 
poor, which has been tripled within that time. The Earl of Kin- 
tore gives, unsolicited, an annual donation, which is more than the 
former yearly supply, then only L. 18. The other heritors are 
absentees, and draw their rents without remitting any return to 
the poor; but it has not been necessary to solicit a contribution 
from them.

PEESBYTEKY OF GARIOCH, SYNOD OF ABERBEEN. 

THE REV. PATRICK DAVIDSON, MINISTER. 

THE REV. ROBERT CUSHNY, Assistant and Successor 

I. — TOPOGIIAPHY AND NaTURAL HiSTORY. 

Name. — The name Insch is generally considered to be of Cel- 
tic origin, and to signify an island. It is not improbable, that the 
Insch had originally been confined to the small town or village in 
which the church stands, or, at all events, to the spot of ground 
which forms the site of the village, and which bears some marks of 
having been at one time surrounded with water. 

Extent, Sfc, — The parish is of an irregular figure. Were one 
part of it, however, taken away, namely, the Daugh of Moreal, 
which there is reason to think had not originally belonged to it, 
but had formed part of another parish now extinct, called Rathmo- 
real or Christ-kirk, the remains of whose church, surrounded by a 
burial-ground, are quite adjacent, in the parish of Kennethmont, 
the remainder would be pretty nearly an oblong, the greater sides, 

  Drawn up by the Rev. liobcrt Cushny. 



748 ADEHDRENSHIRE. 

from north to south, measuring about 5 miles, the lesser, from east 
to west, about 2i. The superficial extent of the whole parish is 
about 1 If square" miles. It is bounded on the east by the parish of 
Culsamond; on the south, by Oyne, Premnay, and Leslie; on the 
west, by Kennethmont and Gartly; and on the north, by Drum- 
blade and Forgue. 

The hill of Foudland is situated in this parish, and forms the 
principal of a range of Slate-hills, extending into Gartly on the 
west, and into Culsamond on the east. It stands at an elevation 
of about 1100 feet above the level of the sea, has rather a lump- 
ish appearance, but commands a very fine prospect. That rich 
and fertile tract, the How or Vale of the Garioch, is nowhere 
seen to greater advantage than from this hill, by which, indeed, a 
considerable part of it is sheltered on the north and north-west. 

The isolated hill of Dunnideer, about a mile from the village 
of Insch, and due west of it, is a singularly striking and beautiful 
object, and one which has long attracted the observation both of 
antiquarians and naturalists. Its form is that of a cone a lutle 
flattened at the apex; and, owing to this peculiarity, and its sum- 
mit being crowned with some curious ruins, it catches the eye ot 
a stranger at a great distance. 

It is about 3000 yards in circumference at the base, from which 
it rises abruptly to the height of 550 or 600 feef. Immediately 
facing it, on the west, and rising with equal abruptness, is the hill 
of Christ-kirk, in the parish of Kennethmont, the two hills being 
separated only by a narrow valley, through which runs the She- 
vock, a small stream, which, at this point, and for a considerable 
part of its course, forms the boundary of the parish, and whose 
windings, as seen from Dunnideer, have a very picturesque effect. 

Dumiideer is nearly on a line with the west end of Foudland, 
and about due south from it, the distance between them being 
about three miles. There are no other hills of great magnitu e 
in the parish. Some small hills there are here and there rising 
abruptly from the plain, such as Knockenbaird, Greenlaw, , 
but as seen from the top of the hill of Foudland, they have l 
appearance of mere knolls or hillocks scattered over the level or 

c;licrhtlv undulating surface. , 
C»™y.-The average height of the mercu,, ,n the baro 

meter throughout the year is 29.3 mches. There ,s a perc pu 
variety of climate iu the parish, the crops be.ng m geueral Ihr e 
kor a month later on the north side of Foudland than on thJ 



INSCH.

south side, and about ten days later in the vicinity of that hill, 
even on the south side, than on the more southerly part of the 
parish. The climate throughout, however, may certainly be 
termed very salubrious, there being none of what are called local 
distempers known in the parish. 

Hydrography. — Though not in the vicinity of any considerable 
river, Insch is well watered by small rills, so that on a majority of 
the farms in it, the thrashing machines are driven by water. The 
Shevock has already been referred to as forming one of the boun- 
daries of the parish. This it does both on the west and south. 
About a mile from where it takes leave of the parish, running 
eastward, it unites with the Ury, a larger stream, which takes its 
rise in the Glens of Foudland, i. e. on the north side of the hill 
of that name, and there forms the boundary of the parish on the 
north. 

Geology. — The hill of Foudland is famous for its slate quarries. 
The slate, which is of a fine dark colour, and excellent quality for 
roofing, is found in beds running from south-west to north-east, 
and incHning northwards, the angle of inclination varying a good 
deal. Cross-bars or dikes cutting across the veins are of frequent 
occurrence, and consist of a slaty substance for the most part, with 
pieces of trap and sometimes decomposed granite intermixed. 
These cross-bars are found occasionally to derange the veins, so 
that the sections on the opposite sides are not in the same line 
with each other. 

The rocks composing the smaller hills in the parish seem to 
be chiefly gneiss, and black or grey granite. 

The soil is for the most part of a loamy nature, and generally 
what might be called a light loam, with a mixture of gravel and 
yellow clay forming the subsoil. 

In the low grounds, towards the base of Dunnideer, bog-iron 
ore is found in considerable quantities. On the sides of the hill 
of Foudland, the soil is generally a light clay, mixed with slaty 
particles, and the subsoil of a slaty nature, always retaining a 
certain quantity of moisture in the driest seasons, and in wet 
seasons, again, allowing the superfluous water to ooze off", so that 
the land here is not liable to be either droughted or drowned, as 
the expression is. There are some peat-mosses in this hill, in 
which large oak-trees have occasionally been discovered. The 
higher parts of the hill, and all that is uncultivated of it, are co- 
vered with heath.

1I._ Civil History. 
Any authentic account of the more remote history of the parish 
would undoubtedly be very interesting, as the memorials of long 
past times, which still exist in it, are such as shew that it has once 
been the scene of important events. No such account, how- 
ever, is known to the writer of this. In a genealogical work, now 
rare, entitled Laurus Lesliana, and which gives an account of the 
various branches of the Lesly family, there is some information to 
be found respecting the former proprietors of land in the parish, 
the chief of whom had belonged to the house of Lesly. 

Land.oivners.— The principal land-owners, at the present time, 
are, Count Lesly of Balquhain, proprietor of the lands termed 
the Barony of Meikle Wardhouse, Knockenbaird, &amp;c. in the pa- 
rish of Insch. Count Lesly's ancestors had, it would seem, at one 
time been possessed of the greater part of the lands in this parish, 
as also in not a few of the parishes in the Garioch. The baronies 
of Balquhain and Meikle Wardhouse, the former in the parish 
of Chapel of Garioch, the latter in this parish, had formerly be- 
longed to separate branches of the family, and they contmued to 
do so till about the year 1642, when, according to Spalding the 
estates of Wardhouse were " so much dilapidated, that the heir, 
Sir John Leslie, who died in 1645, on coming home from Ger- 
manv, on the death of his father, found that there was nothing left 
for him to live upon.' The greater part of his property, having 
probably been mortgaged, had come, about that time, into the 
hands of the Balquhain branch, in which it has continued ever 

''"a considerable portion, however, including the site of the castle 
of Wardhouse, having been otherwise disposed of, and having 
passed through various hands, is now in the possession o John 
David Gordon, Esq. merchant in Cadiz, who succeeded his father, 
Charles Gordon, about nine years ago. The family residence in 
Scotland is Gordon Hall, Kennethmont. The other proprietors 
of land are, Theodore Gordon, Esq. Ojerhall, who ispo 
of part of the lands of Dunn.deer, in this parish.-Robert Abe 
Lmbie Esq. of Rothney and Drumross.e, who came mto pos- 
::.tl of Z above lands lying partly in Insch partly in Prem- 
nay bv purchase, only a few years ago, they h-wig been s d 
bv the executors of the late Miss Mary Gordon, the last of her 
JnJy, which was a branch of the Gordons of Lesmoir, ad • 
whose' hands they had been for some centunes.-Sir Andiew 



INSCII.

Leith Hay, of Rannes, who is possessed of the lands of Insch and 
Netherboddom, and the superiority of the burgh of Insch. Be- 
sides the properties above referred to, there are in the parish the 
lands of Boddom, Cairneston, and Johnsleys, which are at present 
in the market, having fallen to be disposed of by the executors of 
the late Mr Gordon, Newton. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers, including kirk- 
session records, and registers of baptisms and marriages, extend 
as far back as to the year 1683, but are not altogether complete. 

Antiquities. — There are a good many remains of Druidical tem- 
ples, all in elevated situations. There are also several rude obe- 
lisks, or stone pillars, in the parish ; one called the Picardy Stone, 
standing about 7 feet in height above ground, with some carving, 
apparently emblematical, on the south face of it, and another, to- 
wards the centre of the parish, called the Earl of Mar's Stone. 

Near the village of Insch is a mound, or rising ground, called 
the Gallow Hill, the road leading past which has always been 
known by the name of the Gallow Road ; and there is a tradition, 
deriving some probability from this, that Insch, though but a 
.burgh of barony, had had the power pot and galloios. 

A fragment of a brass sword, or Roman gladius, was found 
some years ago on the farm of Mr A. Beattie, Dunnideer, and is 
still in the possession of that gentleman, who has also some frao-- 
ments of what would appear to have been a gold chain, of very 
rude workmanship, which were found on the farm of Wantinwells, 
■on the clearing away of the foundation of some old houses. When 
the vacant ground on the north side of the church was levelled 
out some years ago, a tombstone was laid bare, very near the wall, 
with the words randolphvs sacerdos inscribed on it lengthwise, 
•and, after these, some date, which is illegible. The stone is 
about 6 feet in length, and 20 inches in breadth. 

By far the most interesting objects, however, which the pa- 
rish holds out to antiquarians, are the ruined fort and tower 
on the top of the hill of Dunnideer, the former being a 6ne speci- 
men of what are called vitrified forts, the latter the remnant of a 
square tower or castle built within the fort, and partly of fragments 
of It, covermg from 13 to 14 square yards of ground, including 
the walls, 7 feet m thickness ; only one wall, however, standing 
entire, and it being from 50 to 60 feet in height. 
. As to the fort or enclosure, the subjoined remarks from Mac- 



75V5 ABERDEENSHIUE. 

CuUoch's Highlands and Islands of Scotland, give a sufficiently 

accurate description of it. 

" The hill of Dunnideer, having an elevation of about 600 feet ■ 
from the irregular plain on which it stands, with a steep acclivity 
all around, has a flat oval summit, which is entirely occupied by 
the enclosure, so as to form a strong military position. Though 
much ruined, and consequently obscured, having apparently been 
used as a quarry for building a more modern castle in the same 
spot the square tower alluded to, it is not difficult .to tmce 
either the dimensions or the disposition of the original work. The 
form is a parallelogram, of which one extremity is curved, so as 
to be nearly semicircular, and its longest side is about .'8 yards, 
the shortest being about 24. The thickness of the wall seenis 
originally to have been 18 or 20 feet, more likely 12, although, 
from the state and nature of the ruin, it is impossible to be very 
accurate in this particular. The highest remaining portion is about 
six feet above the present surface, and if one foot be added tor 
the increase of the soil, and two for the loss which it has sustained 
at the summit, we shall have nine feet as the probable original 
altitude. At a certain stage down the hill are the well-marked 
traces of a work, which once seems to have encircled the whole. 
It is a kind of fortification, well known to antiquaries as occur- 
ring frequently in the ancient British hill forts, and consists of a 
single ditch and wall. The materials in the vitrified wall are 
partly roasted without adhesion, and partly vitrified or glazed. It 
is easy to see that dark granite forms the vitrified or scorified sub- 
stances Wherever stones not capable of vitrification themselves 
have undergone any thing like a similar change, it has been pro- 
duced by the alkali of the wood used in the process. 1 he mate- 
rials of the hill are chiefly grey granite, a fusible rock; but there 
are scattered, in the surrounding plain, blocks of a black variety, 
which, from containing hornblende, is very f , 

It will be seen that the above writer adopts Mr Williams s theory 
as to the formation of the singular species of structure, of which 
this is a specimen, viz. that a mound o earth had P-bab y b en 
raised on each side of the intended wall, and the space b - 
filled with stones of a fusible nature along with large q-nUtie of 
wood, which, being set fire to, a sufficient degree of hea had be n 
produced to dissolve partially or wholly most of the stone d 
lus to convert the pile into a solid mass. T.ere are, however 
other theories upon the subject,-one, that the vitrification 



INSCH. 



753 



not been the result of design, but had been produced accidentally 
by the fires which, it may be supposed, the people, betaking them- 
selves to the fort for refuge, would kindle inside the wall. And 
another, — that there has been no vitrification, properly speaking, 
at all, but that the stones have been made to adhere to each other 
in the manner they do by the use of some strong cement poured 
in amongst them, and which constitutes the lava-like substance 
abounding in the structure. But it seems an insuperable objec- 
tion to this view of the matter, that the stones themselves have all 
evidently been subjected to the action of extreme heat. 

Nothing, of course, can be said as to what may be the precise 
age of this very ancient structure. Even the tower, which has 
• been referred to as comparatively modern, has every appearance 
of having been built at a period considerably remote. As has been 
said, only one wall of it remains entire, and this having but two 
windows, one above the other, and the upper one very much en- 
larged by the crumbling of its sides, has a curious effect seen at a 
distance, and is known by the name of " Gregory's wall," from a 
tradition that King Gregory had resided here. But it may be 
doubted, whether this-name is not more applicable to the vitrified 
or more ancient structure. Fordoun has it that King Gregory 
died at Dunnideer. His words are,—" Gregorious autem rex 
iste niagnificus, postquam annos decem et octo, mensibus aliquot 
exceptis, strenue regnasset, apud Dornideare diem clausit extre- 
mum, et in lona sepultus insula requiescit." 

The erection of the tower is also ascribed to David Earl of 
Huntington and Garioch, the founder of the Abbey of Lundores. 
And mention is somewhere made of « the Abbot of Dunnideer," 
by which expression, however, it is supposed, the Abbot of Lun- 
dores is meant. 

That Dunnideer, if not formerly a regal residence, had been, 
at any rate, a place of great importance, is manifest from various 
circumstances, especially from the extraordinary care with which 
Its safety seems to have been provided for. In the hollow or 
narrow valley to the west of it is the site of the ancient castle of 
Aleikle Ward House, or, more properly, the Meikle Ward House 
of Dunnideer,— the only remaining vestige of which now is the 
fosse by which it had been surrounded ; although it is not very 
many years since the ruins of the walls were removed ; and a little 
farther on in the same direction, that is, more to the north from 
13unnideer, is a place called Little Ward House, where, however 

ABEKDEEN. g 'tn,, 



754 ABEUDEKNSHIRE. 

the name alone indicates the previous existence of a place of de- 
fence ; and the northern extremity of the valley, or where it opens 
up to the west, is called Ward Head. Now, the idea that these 
names and relics are vestiges of the defences of Dunnideer, seems 
probable from the circumstance, that it is only on this side where 
it is nearly approached by other hills and rising grounds, that the 
place could have been surprised by any sudden attack, as on all 
other sides it commands a very extensive tract of level ground 

It is possible, however, as the valley in which the traces of these 
defences occur forms a principal pass to the Garioch from the 
north and west,— that they and the fort of Dunnideer itself had 
been erected for the purpose of guarding against mvasion from 
these quarters. 

III. — Population. 
According to the Statistical Account of the parish, published 
by Sir John Sinclair, the population was estimated, in 1755, at 
995 souls ; in 1795, at 900, shewing a decrease of 90 in the in- 
tervenino- forty years, which decrease is ascribed, by said account, 
to the scarcity of fuel then beginning to be felt in places distant 
from the coast, and also to the increased demand for hands in the 
manufactories, which had drawn off some of ihe rural population 
to the manufacturing towns and villages. 

The population in 1831 amounted to • 1338 

the males, numbenng . do» 
the, females, . • "' 

This shews an increase, in the space of thirty-six years, that is, 
from the year 1795 to the year 1831, of 438, an increase which 
must be chiefly ascribed to the improvement of waste land, and 
the more extensive working of the slate-quarries in Foudland, to 
both of which a stimulus was given, by the opening of the canal 
from Aberdeen to Inverury, and which afforded considerable en- 
couragement to labourers to settle in the parish. 

The present population is 1379, which shews an increase of 
41 in the last ten years. This increase has been altogether in 
the village of Insch. Rather more than a sixth part of the whole 
population of the parish, or about 220 persons, reside in this vil- 
Le and there is no other besides it in the parish, but only two 
or three small hamlets, and of these there is none coniaunng 
above ten families. 

The yearly average of births, for the last seven years has been 37 
deaths, • ' 

marriages.

There is a good deal of wealth in the parish, the farmers, as a 
body, being fully as affluent as those of any other parish in the 
district. There is, however, only one proprietor of land residing 
in the parish. '

There are not above 47 acres in the whole parish under wood. 

A large proportion of the arable land is of excellent quality ; 
and there are some farms, the leases on which have been lately 
renewed, that are yielding a very high rent, in some instances 
nearly L. 2 per acre, over head. But the average rent of arable 
land over the whole parish cannot be stated as higher than 1 8s, 
or 20s. per acre. 

Very few sheep are kept. 

The cattle hitherto most generally reared have been of what 
are called the Aberdeenshire or Angus-shire breeds. The prac- 
tice of crossing these with the short-horned or Durham breed is, 
however, becoming very prevalent; and the superior size of the 
animals thus produced holds out great temptation to it, thouoh 
the beef is not considered to be of such quality as that of the old 
breed of the country. The callle-shows held by the Highland 
Society of Scotland and by local agricultural societies, have had 
considerable effect in causing greater attention to be paid to the 
the"" "' consequently in improving the quality 

The system of husbandry pursued in this as in the other pa- 
nshes of the Garioch, may certainly be considered as having at- 
tained a considerable degree of excellence. The climate not be 
'ng suitable for wheat, oats form the principal corn crop ; and 
according to the most improved rotation, one crop of these is 
taken after three years of grass; and the ground being next green. 



756 ABEUDERNSIIIRE. 

fallowed with turnips, bears another crop of oats, sometimes bar- 
lev, the sixth year, grass being sown in along with it for hay crop 
the following year. This rotation is called the six-sh.ft, and is 
rapidly taking the place of the seven-shift formerly used, and ac- 
cording to which two crops of oats were taken m succession after i 
three years of grass, which, besides that the second crop was ge- 
nerally a poor one, took away much from the chance of a good 
crop of turnips the year following,-a matter of serious considera- 
tion where so much dependence is placed upon the rearing and 
fattening of live-stock. The application of bone-manure to the 
raising of this crop is now generally practised with great advantage 

in light soils. . 

Although, generally speaking, there would be little difficulty in 
supplying enclosures with water, yet, owing to the scarcity of ma- 
terials, i. e. of stones and wood, suitable for diking or paling, 
and the cultivation of hedges being but little encouraged, there 
is as vet only a small proportion of enclosed fields. 

The farm-buildings, if the value of the farms be taken mto ac- 
count, must in general be pronounced of an inferior description. 
Few of them are slated, notwithstanding their vicinity to the slate- 
quarries; and a great deal of straw is, in consequence, annually 
consumed on thatch, which would be more profitably employed 
as provender or litter for cattle. The remedying of this state of 
things lies with the landlords, who would greatly enhance the va- 
lue of their properties by erecting substantial farm-buildings, on 
a good plan, and at their own expense, and thus leaving their te- 
nants with the full command of their capital to improve their 
farms, which would, of course, bear a higher rent ; vhereas tbe 
general system at present is to let the tenant F- "f/ 
buildings such as he thinks proper, allowing um only one yea 
rent or one and a-half year's, at the end of the lease, for his 
"hole outlay; or, in some cases, allowing the value of the mason- 
lork, deducting lime and carriages; and, in others, only the value 

of the roof. ..."

Quarries. — The slate-quarries of Foudland in this parish have 
long- been in great repute, as producing an excellent quality of 
blue slate, large quantities of which were formerly taken to Aber- 
deen ; but that town has for some years derived its chief supplj' 
from Easdale in Argyleshire, from whence slates being now 
brought by sea, free of duty, can be delivered at Aberdeen at full 
as low a price as the Foudland slates, which have to pay a heavy 
land and canal carriage, the former being at the rate of 14s. per 
1000, i. e. Is. per mile per 1000 the distance to Inverury being 
■fourteen milesjthe latter 9s. per 1000, or 6d. per mile per 1000, the 
distance from Inverury to Aberdeen per canal being eighteen miles. 
The average quantity of slates annually taken from these quarries 
amounted some years ago, to 900,000, but the present average is 
scarcely a half of this ; and it is to be feared that the yield will 
be still farther diminished, unless some improvement is made in 
the mode of working the quarries, either by the application of 
machinery, or by clearing away the refuse, and laying bare the 
slate beds to a greater depth, much evil having been done by 
commencing the quarries too far up the hill, to save trouble and 
expense at the outset, and working along the tops of the veins, or, 
at all events, not quarrying them to their full depth, and so dis- 
posing of the refuse as to increase the difficulty of working them 
out to greater depth now. The prices of slates at the quarry 
mouth are as follows : first quality, L. 2, 7s. 6d. per 1000 ; se- 
cond quality, L. 2 per 1000. The cost of labour on first is L. 1, 
10s. per 1000; on second, L. 1, 5s. per 1000. This includes 
quarrying, splitting, dressing, &amp;c. Splitters get lOd. per 100 
slates; dressers, 2s. per 100.

V. — Pa'ochial Economy. 
Ihere are two half-yearly markets at Insch; one for cattle, horses, 
and grain, the other for the feeing of servants. Formerly the town 
had Its weekly market, but that may be said to have ceased many 
years smce, except that there is a regular supply of butcher-meat 
every Friday. 



758 ABEUDEF.NSlllRK. 

The feuars of Insch are heritable proprietors of their houses 
and small gardens, paying a small feu-duty to Sir A. Le.th Hay 
their superior, from whom they also rent about four acres of 

ground each. , , 

The present population is about 220. There are several shop- 
keepers who deal in groceries, cloth, hard and stone -ware, drugs, 
&amp;c There are also two watchmakers, a baker, a saddler, and 
other tradesmen. Most of the shops and dwelling-houses have 
been for some years lighted with gas. , . , . , j 

There is no post-office nearer than Old Rain, wh,ch is three and 
a-half miles off', the letters being at present conveyed to and trom 
that by a runner not a servant of the post-office, who is paid by 
a penny on each letter. A post-office at Insch would be a great 
boon to the neighbourhood. , • .i. 

There are from six to seven miles of turnpike road in the pa- 
rish, including parts of three lines, one, the mail-road from Aber- 
deen to Huntly, which intersects the parish on the north side of 
Foudland, the other two, variations of this, taking, the one, a 
nler co'urse over the west shoulder of Foudland, t e oi a 
more circuitous but more level course through Kennethmont and 

''tLa.ecaZ S.a..-The parish church stands in the town of 
Insch, close on the southern boundary of the parish so that the 
 ish'ioners in the Glens of Foudland, i e on the nor her 
boundary, have to travel from five to six miles to it, and this by a 
very difficult road, over the east end of the hill. 

The date on the belfry of the church is 1613, and the comm 
belief is, that the church itself had been built in that year. The 
building, although it has at various times undergone considerable e- 
IZs afd alterations, and has therefore been in some sort moderniz- 
ed t betrs indications of considerable age. The walls are abou 
ot feet thick. It was new roofed in a very f

building, wlien it was proved on the part of the heritors, that, 
thouffh the state of one of the walls was such as has been describ- 
ed, yet, as it had been exactly the same for a long period of years, 
it could not be considered as incompatible with the safety of the 
congregation. It is to be hoped, however, that, notwithstanding 
this finding, the heritors will soon of themselves see the propriety 
of erecting a new church on a scale adapted both to the comfort 
and convenience of the parishioners. The present one is neither 
ceiled nor plastered, and is seated to contain only 460 people. 

There are 60 free sittino-s in the area of the church, under the 
control of the kirk-session, who let them at low rates, viz. from Is. 
to 2s. per annum, for behoof of the poor. 

. The present manse, which is about half a mile distant from 
the church, the old site in the village having been relinquish- 
ed, was built in 1771, and enlarged and repaired about sixteen 
years ago. The glebe is 12 imperial acres in extent, and abo- t 
L.25 yearly value, having been got in exchange for one-half the 
quantity of very superior ground, on the site of the manse being 
changed. 

The stipend was last modified in 1833, when an augmentation 
was obtained. It now amounts to 15 bolls of victual, half meal, 
half barley, commuted into money at the fiars' prices. By an ar- 
rangement entered into between the present minister and the he- 
ritors, and sanctioned by the Presbytery, the latter pay him L.9, 
3s. 6d. annually instead of 550 back-loads of peats, which they were 
formerly bound to deliver to him, the back-load being as much as 
a horse could carry on a pair of panniers, or creels, the usual mode 
of conveying fuel from the moss in olden times. 

There is no chapel of ease nor Government church in the pa- 
rish, nor any Dissenting place of worship, properly so called. 
There is m the village of Insch an Independent preaching station, 
or rather a hall given for this amongst other purposes, in which 
there is a sermon every second Sunday in the afternoon, the same 
being supplied by two Independent clergymen from neighbouring 
parishes.  

The number of families in the parish that attend Dissenting or 
Seceding places of worship is about 26; the number of indivi- 
duals, about 70 or 80. All the other inhabitants capable of 
church attendance come to the parish church, there being no 
''Episcopalians or Catholics in the parish. " 



760 ABERDliKNSHlRE. 

The parish church is very well attended. The average number 
of communicants is 575. . 

There are two societies for religious purposes m the par.sh, a 
Bible Society, and a Juvenile Missionary Society. The contn- 
butions of both together may average about L.25 per annum 

The church collections for religious and charitable objects 
amount, on an average, to L.42 per annum. 

Education.-ThoZ are four schools in the pansh.one of wh.clus 
pafocS o e endowed from the General Assembl/s fund and two 
unendowed. At the two first mentioned, in addition to the ordl- 
ua y branchos.-reading, writing, and arithmetic,-instructlon is 
given in English grammar, geography, and mathematics, as al0 
TGreek and Latin when required. In all, the Bible ,s dady read, 
and the Assembly's Catechism taught. 

The parochial schoolmaster has a salary of L.'27, and receives 
on an average L.16 per annum in the shape of school-fees. His 
income has of late, however, been greatly improved, by his parti- 
cipating in the benefits of Mr Dick's Bequest, along wUh his 
brelen in the three counties of Aberdeen, Banff, and Moray. 
The present parochial school-house possesses ample and superior 
accommodation, having been built a few years ago, when also a 
del ached dwelling-house was built for the schoolmaster. 

T e tealer of the General Assembly's school receives a salary 
of L.25 out of the fund for" increasing the means of education ra 
Scotland,and draws about L.14annuallyintheshape of school-fees. 

He hastL usual accommodation stipulated for by the Assembly s

remote parts of the parish previous to the establishment of the 
Assembly school above referred to. 

There are none upwards of fifteen years of age, and that are 
natives of the parish, but are capable of reading, although there 
may be some aged women who have not learned to write. 

Charitable Institutions. — A Savings Bank has been established 
for some years, called the Insch and Upper Garioch Savings 
Bank, being for the accommodation of agricultural labourers and 
others in Insch and the neighbouring parishes. It is in a thriving 
condition, and promises to be of great benefit to the classes whose 
interest it was intended to promote. The deposits have been at 
the rate of L.528 per annum, while the sums withdrawn have ave- 
raged only L.177 per annum. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving constant parochial supply is 24. The rate of allowance 
per week varies from 9d. to 2s. 6d. ; but is sometimes higher in 
the case of widows left with young families, or bed-rid persons re- 
quiring hired attendance. 

The annual amount of contributions may be specified as under : 
Collections at church, L.34; seat-rents in church, L.4, 12s.; le- 
gacies, L.l, 10s.; interest of money funds, L.3, 10s.; rent of a 
piece of ground near the village of Insch, called the Bass, pur- 
chased with poor's funds about 160 years since, L.16, 10s.; mak- 
ing in all, besides casual donations from heritors, &amp;c., L.62, 2s. 
In the distribution of the funds, the kirk-session are sometimes at 
a loss how to act, in order to prevent the risk of extreme distress, 
without, at the same time, encouraging habits of idleness and pro- 
fligacy. Fortunately, however, such cases are not very common ; 
while instances frequently occur of a reluctance to accept relief; 
and, generally speaking, the recipients are persons who have be- 
come such from actual necessity. 

Fairs.~T\\e two half-yearly fairs that are held have already 
been referred to. The one for cattle, horses, &amp;c. is held on the 
third Wednesday of May, and third Tuesday of October, old 
style. The feeing market is held on the Fridays preceding 26th 
May and 22d November. 

Inns, 4-c.— There are no fewer than five public-houses in the 
parish,— three of these being in the village, and one closely ad- 
joining to It. Such a number as this is altogether unnecessary, 
and their decrease is much to be desired, as there can be no doubt 
out that, by furnishing people with additional lacilities for induhr- 



762 ABERDEENSHIRE. 

ing to excess in ardent spirits, they are productive of most injuri- 
ous effects to the morals of the neighbourhood. 

Fuel —Peat and turf from Foudland has hitherto formed the 
principal part of the fuel used in the parish. As the mosses m 
Foudland, however, are getting pretty much exhausted, and the 
peat is of inferior quality, it is probable that the people wdl soon 
become more dependent on English coal, the use of wh.ch, to a 
small extent, is already almost general The feuars of Inscli have 
the privilege of fuel from the Hill of Melschach m Kennethmont, 
here the peat is of better quality than on Foudland ; but the 
length of carriage is upwards of four miles.

growth of wood, and which are of little value for cultivation, where 
not a tree has been planted. 

As there is a great extent of mossy and swampy ground in this 
parish and neighbourhood, it might have been expected that the 
atmosphere would have been much impregnated with damp, and 
consequently insalubrious ; but, on the contrary, the air of Mon- 
quhitter is pure and healthful, and unquestionably the climate has 
been greatly ameliorated by the agricultural improvements which 
have taken place within the last forty or fifty years. 

A species of scarlet fever, accompanied with violent sore throat, 
has much inflicted this and some of the neighbouring parishes, and 
has been known, at times, to carry off two, three, and even four in 
a family in the course of a few days. 

Hydrography. — Monquhitter is watered by two small rivers, 
which receive the tribute of numberless and copious springs. The 
one of these, called the water of Assleed, runs in a southerly di- 
rection, separates Monquhitter from the parishes of New Deer 
and Methlick, and discharges itself into the river Ythan. The 
other, called the Water of Idoch, gives its name to the vale of 
Idocb. It passes within a short distance of the parish church and 
the village of Cuminestown, and runs in a westerly direction to the 
parish of Turriff, where it assumes the name of Dara, and falls into 
the river Doveron, at the village of Turriff. These streams still 
abound with delicious small trout of the common kind, and, al- 
though by no means so plentiful as in former times, in consequence 
of the extensive use of Hme in agricultural operations, they still 
afford excellent sport to the angler, — the banks being in all places 
open and accessible. 

Geology and Mineralogt/.— Below a stratum of pebbly clay, ex- 
tensive quarries of red sandstone lie in the direction of a plane, 
much inclined from east to west. This stone, though much im-. 
pregnated with iron ore, may be raised in large masses, and 
is used in building. As the greater part of it is of a soft and 
spongy description, liable to decay, and moulders down from ex- 
posure to the weather, it is not calculated either for comfort or 
durability in the erection of dwelling-houses. 

Soil. — The two soils which chiefly prevail in the cultivated parts 
of Monquhitter are, the one, a reddish loam, the other, a deep 
black mould. They both rest on a stratum of pebbly clay, and, 
in the lower grounds, produce very luxuriant crops of oats. In 
former times, the crops throughout the parish seldom arrived at 



764 



ABERDEENSHIRE. 



maturity, from the wetness of the soil, and the consequent damp 
and chill of the climate ; but, by a system of judicious draining, 
for which the inclination of the surface affords great facilities, both 
the soil and climate have been greatly improved ; and the conse- 
quence is, that our harvests are now but little behind those of our 
southern neighbours, and the grain little inferior in quality to 
theirs. There are also large tracts of moss in the parish, which 
are valuable for the supply of fuel which they yield. The peats 
o-enerally are of a very superior quality, being of a deep black co- 
Tour, and close in the texture, and, when properly dried, are little 
inferior to the finest description of Scotch coals. The greater 
part of the parish seems, at one time, to have been covered with 
heath, and, even yet, the cultivated land has a great tendency to 
return to heath, which is only kept down by a regular rotation of 
cropping. Under these circumstances, the land can never be al- 
lowed to remain sufficiently long in grass to afford very rich pas- 
turage, which, in every situation, requires a series of years, as well 
as kindly soil for its production. Lands that have been long in 
cultivation are shy in retaining artificial grasses, while those which 
have recently been brought under the plough, after a proper 
application of lime, produce rich crops of rye-grass and clover, 
and retain the sown clover for two or three years, whereas, in 
land of a much richer quality, but which has been long in tillage, 
red clover seldom keeps the soil more than one year. 

Forests and Plantations.— There are no trees of any great age 
to be found, and the only plantations worthy of particular notice, 
are those in the immediate neighbourhood of the mansion-house 
of Auchry. These were put down by the late Joseph Cumine, 
of Auchry, about the middle of last century, and consist of ash, 
oak, larch, elm, plane, lime, Scotch and spruce firs all of which 
thrive remarkably well, when planted in anything like good soil. 
AH the hardier kinds of forest trees seem to thrive well, but par- 
ticularly the fir species ; Scotch and spruce firs and larches chiefly 
prevail, grow to a large size, and are excellent timber. In low and 
damp situations, the spruce fir grows with great rapidity, but the 
timber of this species is difficult to work, and by no means so va-- 
luable. Mr Lumsden, the present proprietor of Auchry, is at 
Ireat pains in keeping his woods, both by thinning and pruning 
fhose that are advanced, and trenching and digging in the young 
plantations, which tends greatly to promote their growth.

11. — Civil History. 

The parish of Monquhitter was disjoined from that of Turriff 
in 1649, and Mr WiUiam Johnstone, the first Presbyterian minis- 
ter after the Revolution settlement, was ordained to Monquhitter 
on the 15th November 1727. Till about that period, this district 
was one of the strongholds of Episcopacy in Scotland. It is true, 
that, some time previous to this, Presbyterianisra had again be- 
come the established form of worship in Scotland, but wherever 
Episcopal ministers, holding cures, were peaceably disposed, they 
were allowed to retain their emolumenls during their lifetime, 
which was tbe case in this parish. Mr Adam Hay, the last 
Episcopal minister of Monquhitter, has left a substantial memo- 
rial of the kindly spirit which existed between him and the peo- 
ple of his time, in a pair of silver communion cups, and a morti- 
fication of 200 merks, L.11, 2s. 2d. Sterling, on his lands of 
Assleed, the proceeds of which to be applied to any poor persons 
residing on these lands. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers commence in 
1670 for baptisms, and in 1693 fipr marriages, and, with the ex- 
ception of one or two chasms, have been kept regularly down to 
the present time.

In 1755, the return to Dr Webster, from this parish, gave 997 
inhabitants. In 1757, the number of souls fell short of 800, but 
since that time population has greatly increased, partly by the 
practice of dividing large farms to accommodate small tenants, 
and partly by the reclaiming of waste land, but principally by the 
establishment of Cuminestown village, in 1763, and afterwards 
of the village of Garmond. The population of these villages in 
1836 amounted to 715, and the country population to 1380, mak- 
ing a total of 2095. By the census of 1841, the population 
amounts to 2074.

Character of the People.-The great proportion of the people 
are industrious in their habits; and although the labouring popula- 
tion enjoy but very limited means of subsistence, yet they are dis- 
tinguished bv a spirit of independence, and are generally desirous 
of supporting themselves and their families by their own industry; 
and even the poorest are anxious to secure for their chddren the 
advantages of education. 

IV. — Industry. 
Jqriculture.—WitWm the last thirty or forty years, a vast addi- 
tion has been made to the extent of cultivation, although a consi- 
derable portion of the land still remains in a waste and uncultivat- 
ed state. On some properties, by judicious draining, 'f f- 
the number of acres under cultivation might be greatly added to, 
both with improvement to the climate, and profit to the proprietor. 
The average rent of arable land per acre is from lOs. to L.l ; 
but some in the neighbourhood of the villages islet as high 
as L 2, 2s. per acre. In good pasture, the average rate for the 
grazing of an ox or cow is from L.l, 10s. to L.2 for the summer 

""uve-stocL—The breeds of sheep most prevalent are Leicester, 
south-down, and black-faced, but little attention, however, is now 
paid to breeding and rearing of sheep in this parish, except by Mr 
Lumsden of Auchry, who is one of the most spirited and mtelh- 
sent agricultural improvers in this part of the country. 

Attempts have been made to introduce various foreign breeds of 
cattle such as the Teeswater and Galloway ; but it has general- 
y bel found that, from the climate, the want of shelter, and the 
inferiority of pasture, they have degenerated ; and many of the m- 
elligent farmers prefer the native Buchan breed to all others. 

The style of husbandry pursued is fully equal to that in any par 
of Scotland Not onlv the larger farmers, but even the smallest 
o"beretoaregular rotation of cropping, and bestow great, 
pa s n tilling and cleaning their ground. Nothing has affoided 
 uZwwJiov and given such an impulse to, the reclaiming of

beef of our cattlie is very highly esteemed, and generally brings a 
superior price in the London market. 

The horses in this parish and district, hough not of a large 
size, are well built, and of a very hardy description ; and as the far- 
mers are generally careful, both as to their feeding, and the timing 
of their work, they can bear great fatigue. They seem to par- 
take somewhat of the old Galloway, which, perhaps, for all useful 
purposes, was the finest breed of horses ever known in Britain. 

The leases of farms generally extend to, and seldom exceed 
the term of, nineteen years. As the farms are generally small, 
with few exceptions exceeding two or four horse labour, the farm- 
buildings, which are mostly thatched with straw or heather, are 
not large, but commodious, and well adapted to the extent of the 
farms. 

Till within the last few years, and for several generations past, 
the Cumines of Auchry'were the principal proprietors in the pa- 
rish of Monquhitter, and were much and deservedly esteemed for 
their public spirit and private benevolence. About the middle of 
the last century, the late Joseph Cumine of Auchry was distin- 
guished, not only in this district, but throughout the whole of the 
north of Scotland, for the stimulus which he gave to agricultural 
improvements. When he assumed the management of his estate 
m J 739, it was principally covered with heath, and yielded only 
L.150 Sterling of rent. He laid out extensive plantations around 
his own house, subdivided his farm into ornamental enclosures in- 
troduced a superior breed of cattle, founded the village of Cumines 
town, in the immediate vicinity of the church, and, in connexion 
with some neighbouring gentlemen, established in this village a 
hnen manufacture, which has been kept up ever since. By the 
judicious management of his property, he left it to his heirs, yield- 
ing an annual revenue of more than L.600 per annum. The rental 
of It was upwards of L. 2500 per annum in 1830, when it was 
divided into lots, and disposed of by his son, the late Archibald 
Cumine, Esq. James Lumsden, Esq. who was the purchaser of 
he principal part of the property, and who ishe only'reside he 
|tor 0 any extent in the parish, has been doing much, and Z 
...g a audable example in the way of improvement, H "d' „ 
g and trenching to a great extent, and by planting hedg L a "d

has also secured a daily post, and, by his persevering exertions and 
his great liberality, in conjunction with several other proprietors, 
a turnpike road through the village of Cuminestown is about to be 
commenced, which, when completed, will afford great facilities o 
farther agricultural improvements, and will form the nearest route 
between Banff and Aberdeen. But still the want of other resident 
heritors of influence and public spirit is severely felt, and stands 
much in the way ofimprovementon other propert.es. 

In the letting of farms, it is usual for the tenant, at the com- 
mencement of his lease, to pay to the proprietor or to theout-go- 
ing tenant, the amount of the valuation put upon the "-b'ld- 
ins, receiving in the same way value for the houses at the end f 
th lease. This system, although it affords an addit.ona secun y 
to the landlord, it being generally covenanted, that if he tenan 
fail to implement his lease, he shall receive nothing in the way of 
meliorations, vet, is in many cases, a great obstacle to improve- 
ment. For many a judicious and industrious t-ant possessing 
perhaps, but a limited capital, and being obliged to sink the half 
Ti upon farm houses during the currency of his lease is thus 
disabled from making improvements, which would not only yield 
good return to himself, but ultimately also prove beneficial to the 

'Tul'liin the last few years, much employment was afforded 
to females in the spinning of flax and knitting of stockmgs, b 
wh ir they were enabled to earn a comfortable livelihood But

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is conveniently placed 
for the greater parfof the population, being close to the village of 
Cuminestown, and not more than a mile from the village of Gar- 
mond. It is situated upwards of seven miles from the most dis- 
tant part of the parish ; but since the erection of the chapel of 
ease of Millbrex, in the parish of Fyvie, which was built in 1833 
for the accommodation of remote districts of Monquhitter and Fy- 
vie, there are few houses more than three miles distant from one 
or other of these places of worship. The minister of the chapel 
of ease is ordained, and is paid partly by an annual grant from 
the royal bounty, and partly from the seat rents of the chapel. 
He has also an extensive glebe, which is given rent free by the 
Earl of Aberdeen, on whose property the chapel is situated, and 
who not only affords this liberal accommodation, but also subscrib- 
ed L.100 toward the erection of the chapel. In 1835, a comfort- 
able manse and offices were also erected ; and the whole of the 
funds needed for the building of these and the chapel were raised 
by voluntary contribution within the parishes of Fyvie and Mon- 
quhitter, with the exception of L.70 obtained from the Church Ex- 
tension Fund, and about L.30 of a presbyterial collection. 

i he parish church was built in 1764, but in a very insufficient 
manner, and isnow m considerable disrepair. An addition was 
made to It m the year 1792, and it accommodates about 1000 sit-

rious objects embraced by a Presbyterial association, and last year 
the contributions and extraordinary church collections for religious 
and charitable purposes, amounted to L.22, besides L.48 of or- 
dinary collections for the poor. j 
Education.-Theve is in the parish one parochial school and 
one unendowed, the teacher of which latter depends entirely on 
school fees for his payment. The parochial schoolmaster has 
the maximum of salary, with the legal allowance for a house and 
garden, besides an annual payment from a munificent bequest 

left by the late Mr Dick. 

The fees in the parochial school, upon an average, amount to 
about L.30 per annum, and those in the unendowed school to 

about L.15. . • i. J- 

There are two localities which are at a most inconvenient dis- 
tance from any school, the district of Greens, containing a popu- 
lation of upwards of 300, the greater number of whomare distant 
about three miles from any school, and the lands of BalquhoUy, 
containing a population of upwards of 100, who are distant from 
four to five miles, and if schools were set down op both of these 
districts, they would acoomraodate equal numbers from the ad- 
joining parishes, both of New Deer and Fyvie. 

Besides the schools for ordinary education, there are four 
Sabbath evening schools, which are attended by upwards of 220 
Young persons and children ; and since the extensive introduction 
of this important department of religious instruction, a change for 
the better is visible in the conduct and morals of the young. 

There is a Sabbath school library, and also a subscription h- 

'"cl'Jltz' Ind other Institutions.-Tin -thin tbe last few years 
there was a Friendly Society in the parish, which had accumulated 
a nsiderable amount of funds, but, as in many other institutions 
of the kind throughout the country, the calculations had not been 
m l upon orreftand sound principles, and, finding the funds to 
be tt 'finishing, the society was lately dissolved, and the pro- 
pry divided amongst the members. This has been s.u.ceeded 
Ty L establishment of a parish S-ings' bank, which is hkely 
IZ very beneficial in its effects. Although tut d only 
five eirslgo, the sum deposited in it amounts to about L.2000,

receiving parochial aid amounts to nearly 50, and the average sum 
allotted to each per year is L.2, 3s. 6d. The average sum of 
church collections for the relief of the poor for the last six 
years amounts to L. 50. This is contributed entirely by the 
farmers and labouring classes, tlie heritors being principally non- 
resident. In consequence of this, an accumulation which had been 
made, when the principal heritor, the late Mr Cumine, was resi- 
dent in the parish, and steadily and largely contributing to the 
poor's funds, is now fast diminishing. There is a disposition 
amongst the poor to refrain from seeking parochial relief as long as 
they can do without it; and many individuals have actually refus- 
ed to accept of it when offered, although some cases of rapacity 
do occasionally occur. In the year 1 806, the sum of L.200 Ster- 
ling was left by the late Mr Grieve, merchant in Cuminestown, 
under the control and management of the kirk-session, the interest 
of which, according to the terms of his will, is annually applied to 
the relief of poor householders, not paupers, in sums not under 
5s., and not exceeding 10s. to each. 

Fairs, Sfc. — There is an annual horse and cattle fair held in 
the village of Cuminestown, on the last Thursday of April, old 
style. The proprietor of Auchry has lately established several 
other markets. 

Inns and Alehouses. — There are five inns and alehouses in the 
parish, one-half of which might suffice. 

Fuel. — Hitherto peats and turf have been almost the only fuel 
used here. The mosses belonging to the property of Auchry, 
whence the villagers have been supplied, are almost entirely ex- 
hausted.

I —Topography and Natural History. 
Geenmuick is compounded of two Gaelic words, 
Glean Mute, signifying the swine's valley or glen There is a 
tradition that wild hogs once abounded in an oak forest, skirting 
both sides of a small river, called the water of Muick, from which 

the parish takes its name.   -, • -c ■ 

Tullich is a corruption of a Gaelic word, Tulach, signifying 
hillocks; and on such a situation stands a small village named 
Tullich, which gives name to this parish, and also to the burying- 
ground around the walls of its old church, now in ruins 
 Glengairn is a corrupted compound of three Gaelic words 
Glen-garbh-amhain, signifying the glen of the rough water; and 
this is very applicable to a small river intersecting this parish, and 
giving name to it, called the Gairn, or rough water, on account 
of its rockv and precipitous channel.

the south-west, and the rest of it on the north-east side of Glen- 
gairn ; the latter with the exception of a small part of it which 
is on the south side of Dee, being all on the north side of Dee, 
As well as Tullich. 

In many places, these united parishes are 18 miles long, by 
15 miles broad; but, as their figure is very irregular, their average 
length and breadth is computed to be only 14 by 12 miles, 
making their extent to be about 180 square miles, that is 82 for 
Glenmuick, 66 for Tullich, and 32 for Glengairn. They are 
bounded by the following parishes, viz. Strathdon, on the north ; 
Coldstone, on the north-east; Aboyne, on the east; Glentanner, 
on the south-east ; Lochlee, on the south ; Clova, on the south- 
west ; and Braemar and Crathie, on the west. They are moun- 
tainous and hilly, and mostly fit for pasture only. 

Mountains. — The principal mountains are Lochnagar, Cairn- 
taggart, Mountkeen, and Morven. But these mountains are all 
on the confines, and none of them wholly within these united pa- 
rishes. By a medium of barometrical observations, made by dif- 
ferent persons at different times, the elevation of Lochnagar, partly 
in Glenmuick, and partly in Braemar, and distant from this church 
about ten miles west, is 3814 feet; the elevation of Cairntaggart, 
partly in Glenmuick, and partly in Braemar, and distant from°this 
church about fifteen miles south-west, is said to be 3000 feet ; the 
elevation of Montkeen, partly in Glenmuick, and partly in Loch- 
lee, and distant from this church about seven miles south, is 3126 
feet; and the elevation of Morven, partly in Tullich, and partly 
in Coldstone, and distant from this church about six miles north 
is 2934 feet. ' 

The highest hills are in ranges, varying from 1000 to 2500 feet 
of elevation. One range, in the east end of the parish of Tullich 
named Culblean, runs from Morven six miles south by east, and 
terminates at the river Dee. Another range whose highest sum- 
nuts have their distinctive Gaelic names, as have also all those in 
the other ranges to be now mentioned, runs westward from the 
middle of Culblean, along the north side of Dee, to the valley of 
J;xairn; after disappearing there, it rises again on the west side of 
Gairn, and goes along the north side of Dee as far as the church 
ot Crathie, thus passing through the south side of TuUich and 
Glengairn. A third range, in Glenmuick, and on the south side 
f Dee runs parallel to the former about six miles westward; then 
•t bends southward, and runs in that direction about two miles 



774 ABERDEENSHIRE. 

along the right bank of the water of Muick ; then it turns west- 
ward, and goes in that direction about twelve miles more, along 
the south side of Muick, Loch Muick, and Loch Dhuloch, till it _ 
meets the parish of Braemar at Mont Cairntaggart, almost due 
south from Invercauld. A fourth range, also in Glenmuick, and 
about four miles west from the church, runs northward from the 
left bank of Muick, a distance of five miles, till it terminates where 
a small river, called the Girnac, falls into the south side of the 

Besides these four ranges, there are several detached hills, one 
of which, named Craigandarroch, 400 yards north from the church, 
is about 1400 feet; and the other, named the Cnoc, about a mile 
west from the church, is about 1 150 feet of elevation. 

The low and flat lands, varying from two furlongs to two miles 
in breadth, lie along the banks of the Dee, the Muick, the Gairn, 
and some considerable brooks ; and these streams, according to 
their magnitude and windings, determine the width and bendmgs 
of the vaUeys. The acclivities, where not too rocky or steep, are 
cultivated to the height of from 100 to 200 feet above the bed of 
the streams, or from 900 to 1000 feet above the level of the sea. 

There are no caves, caverns, nor fissures in these parishes 
worthy of notice, except one in Culblean, in the east end of lul- 
lich. This is an object of curiosity to strangers, and, from its re- 
markable figure, is termed the Vat, to which vessel it bears a 
strikino- resemblance. It seems to have been formed, m the 
course of ages, by the friction of pebbles whirled about by water. 
It is smoothly polished, and almost circular ; its diameter at the 
bottom is about 12 feet, increasing gradually towards the top. A 
stream of water, which, after thaw or rain, becomes a mountain 
torrent, falls into it from a height of not less than thirty feet 
There is a small outlet for the water, at the bottom on the east 
side, by which one can enter it. The surrounding rock is gneiss 

Airo«™p/"/.- There are no remarkable springs, but the ce- 
leblS wis'of Pananich, in the parish of Glenmu.c , on t e 
outh side of Dee, about two miles east from the church, and on 
he no th side o the third range of hills, before noticed, from 
which hey take their name. By chemical analysis, these w 
four in uumber, and all near to one another, have been found -t 
Ixactly alike in their properties, but all containing carbonat of 
iron and lime, with small proportions of other - f  
all chalybeate, stimulant, and tonic, of a cold temperatu

but very agreeable to the taste ; and, although injurious to con- 
sumptive patients, they are allowed to be beneficial to those af- 
flicted with gravelly, scorbutic, and scrofulous complaints. For 
the accommodation of water-drinkers, there are comfortable well- 
aired lodgings at these wells, and also hot, cold, and shower-baths ; 
and, in the summer season, a great many people resort to them 
from distant parts of the country. 

There are three lakes in these- parishes, viz. Loch Dhuloch, 
Loch Muick, and Loch Cannor. Loch Dhuloch lies in the south- 
west corner of Glenmuick, and about three miles east from Mount 
Cairntaggart. It is of small extent, of a cold temperature, and of 
considerable depth. The stupendous overhanging cliffs of Craig- 
dhuloch, surpassing in grandeur the celebrated rocks of Lochna- 
gar, rise on the south side of it to the height of more than 1000 
feet, and, by throwing their gloomy shade over it, give a dark and 
sombre appearance to its limpid water, from which circumstance 
it probably tookTts name Loch Dhuloch, or the black lake. A 
mountain rill falls into it from a height of 200 feet, over a project- 
ing rock on the north side, which renders it altogether the most 
awfully sublime object in these parishes. A small stream, called 
the water of Dhuloch, issues from this lake, and, running eastward, 
forms a series of little cascades, till, at the distance of a mile and 
a-half below, it falls into the west end of Loch Muick. 

Loch Muick is about two miles long, and half a mile broad. 
In some places, this lake is shallow ; in others, which have never 
been properly sounded, it is said to be more than forty fathoms 
deep. Its temperature is cold, even in the greatest heal of sum- 
mer, being fed by several mountain-streams, besides the water of 
Dhuloch. Its scenery is bold and romantic, having Lochnagar 
touching its north side, and a high range of the Grampians closely 
encompassing it on the south and west sides. Towards the west 
end of it, there is a small island, on which sea-gulls are always to 
be found ; but there is little wood, either on the island or the mar- 
gin of the lake, except some dwarfish birch. 

In the east end of the parish of Tullich, at the foot of Culbiean, 
and not far from the Vat, there is a third lake, about three miles 
in circumference, called Loch Cannor. This lake is beautifully 
skirted with birch wood, and studded with small islands. On the 
largest of one of these, once stood a fortress, said to have been 
built, and occasionally occupied as a hunting-seat, by Malcolm 
Canraore, whence it probably got its name. Towards the east end

it is shallow, ill the middle from three to four fathoms deep; and 
its temperaure is much warmer than either that of Loch Dhuloch 

or Loch Muick. , 

Hivers.— The principal river is the Dee, which divides these 
parishes through their whole length. Its source is in the mountains 
of Braemar, in the head of the county. It receives many tributary 
streams, and runs in an easterly direction, till it falls into the Ger- 
man Ocean at Aberdeen. Its length, following the windings of 
its course, is from 90 to 100 miles; its mean annual breadth at 
Glenmuick, about 70 yards; its mean depth, about 4 feet; its 
mean velocity, about 3 miles an hour ; and its mean temperature, 
between 40° and 42° of Fahrenheit. 

Besides the Dee, there are two smaller rivers or waters, the 
Gairn and the Muick. The Gairn has its source from springs 
in the east end of Benavon, a high mountain in the parish of Brae- 
mar. The length of its winding course is about 20 miles ; its 
mean breadth, about 10 yards ; its mean depth, about 18 inches ; 
its mean velocity somewhat greater than of the Dee ; its mean tem- 
perature lower. It runs in a direction from north-west to south- 
east, and, after intersecting the parish of Glengairn it falls into 
the north side of the Dee, about a mile and a-half north-west 

from the church. • j j 

The Muick takes its rise from Lochmuick, before noticed, and 
runs through a considerable part of Glenmuick, in a direction from 
south-west to north-east. The length of its winding course is 
about ten miles, and it falls into the south side of the Dee, at the 
manse, or about half a-mile west from the church. Its breadth, 
depth, and temperature, are nearly the same as those of the Gairn, 
but its velocity is less. About the middle of its course there is 
a cascade, called the Lynn of Muick, where the water falls from 
a heicrht of thirty-six feet over a perpendicular rock, and in floods, 
after ''rain or thaw, it makes a thundering deafening noise, and 
dashes its spray in every direction above and around it. 

Geology, Scc.-The direction and dip of the strata, and the veins 
that cut across them, have not yet been well ascertained. The 
most prevalent rocks are, gneiss, trap, and primitive limestone. 1 he 
two former, particularly the gneiss, are here and there cut across by 
veins of quartz, porphyry, &amp;c., containing fluor-spar and gale 
Some serpentine has been found, also some amianthus, and plen y 
of common asbestos. There h an abundance of granite, not n 
solid rocks, but in boulders and isolated masses ; bog-iron and

ironstone are also very common. No fossil organic remains, 
either of the animal or vegetable kingdoms, have yet been disco- 
vered ; nor of alluvial deposites can anything interesting be men- 
tioned. The soil is generally shallow, dry, sandy, or gravelly ; 
some of it is loamy, and contains boulders of ironstone, gneiss, 
or granite ; little of it is clayey, and none of it marly. There is 
no indication of pit-coal, nor have mines been opened of any de- 
scription. 

Zoology. — One species of animal, that of rabbits, which formerly 
was never seen here except in warrens, has now overspread the 
country, and is more destructive to turnips and other vegetables 
than even hares. It may also be mentioned, as a rare occurrence, 
that a number of white rats have lately made their appearance. 

The fishes in the lakes and rivers are, pike, eels, par, trouts, 
and salmon. Salmon come up the rivers to spawn in October 
and November, and return to the sea in January and the two fol- 
lowing months. One species of them, called canavegs, from the 
smallness of the head, come up later, and do not return till April 
and May. 

Botany. — The rarer species of plants are what are termed al- 
pine, and are found chiefly on the highest mountains and hills ; 
but they are seldom or never used for medicinal, or any other pur- 
poses. The forests consist of Scotch fir ; the plantations of Scotch 
fir, interspersed with larch, pine, mountain-ash, and some other 
varieties. Birch, oak, aspen, and hazel, grow spontaneously on 
dry, gravelly, and sandy soils ; aller on marshy soils, and along 
the banks of rivers. The soil is not favourable to the more va- 
luable kinds of timber, such as plane, elm, ash. 

II. — Civil History. 
Land-owners. — The chief and only land-owners are, the Marquis 
ofHuntly; Mrs Farquharson of Invercauld ; Michael Gordon, Esq. 
of Abergeldie ; and the Representatives of the late William Farqu- 
barson, Esq. of Monaltvie ; and their respective valued rents, ac- 
cording to the order in which they here stand, are L.967, 3s. 4d. ; 
L. 1503, 7s. 7d.; L. 507, 5s. 9d. ; and L. 407, amounting to 
L.3384, 16s. 8d. Scotch money for the three parishes. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers are very defec- 
tive, and not voluminous. During the incumbency of Mr John 
Ferguson, the earliest miuister here on record, the cash and dis- 
cipline register begins 23d June 1661, and ends 6th January 
1677 : then it begins again at the admission of his successor, Mr 



-YQ ABERDEKNSIIIUE. 

David Guthrie, lllh December 1687, and ends 16th February 
1696: it begins again at the admission of his successor, Mr 
James Robertson, 22d March 1699, and ends 13th November 
1 7-26 ; then it begins again at the admission of h.s successor Mr 
Willilm Mackenzie, 5th May 1748, and ends 16th May 1760 : 
it besins aaain, in Mr Mackenzie's time, 8th March 1768. 
nd r':m thl dite it has been reguhvrly kept. The register o 
baptisms does not begin till 6th November l768 Previous to th s 
time, it is said to have been lost through tSf 
latives of the session- clerk, about the time of his death The e 
gister of marriages does not begin till 4th June 1792. bince 
these dates, the registers of baptisms and marriages are entire ; l.ut 
it does not appear that there ever has been any register of deaths. 

Antiquities.-Theve are many large heaps of stones commonly 
called cairns, on a heath or moor near Culblean, in the east end 
of TuUich: and they are said to cover the graves of those who 
fell in flioht after the battle of Culblean or Kdblane, vjiich, ac- 
cording to Buchanan, B. ix. c. 23, was fought between the adher- 
ents of Kino- David Bruce and the followers of Cummin, Earl of 
Athole, in 1335. But, as none of these baiTows have yet been 
opened, it is not known what may be under them, or whether they 
may not be of a still earlier date. 

Modern Bzdldings.-The chief modern buildings e th man- 
sion-house of Ballater, now called Monallne House; Birkhall, a 
seat belonging to Mr Gordon of Abergeldie ; the present paro- 
cM central 'church ; and a mason hall, all built of granite and 
lime, covered with slates, and having the best Scotch hr for roof- 
ing and other carpenter-work. Of meal-mills there are mne, and 
three of these have each a drying-kiln, and all their machinery of 
a new and improved construction. Of manufactories there are 
none, except a carding-mill for wool, at which also some coarse 
cloth is made. These mills are all driven by water.

would seem that the census had not been accurately taken that 
year. 

The number of the population residing in villages is 346 ; viz. 
in Ballater, '271, and in Kirkton of Tullich, 75; all the rest, 
1933, reside in the country.

There are no nobility residing in these parishes, nor any per-

mer. The number of proprietors of land of the yearly value of 
L.50 and upwards, is only 4.

Total standard imperial acres, . 115,453 

The general kind of trees planted is Scotch fir and larch; of 
indigenous it is birch and aller. Little attention is paid to the 
yearly thinning, pruning, and the like. 

The total rental of the parishes is L.5105, which would make 
the average rent of arable land about L.1, 8s. per acre; but after 
deducting the rent of eight sheep farms, and a moderate value for 
bill pasture attached to others, it is not fully L.l, Is. per stand- 
ard imperial acre. 

Live-stock. — The common breed of cattle is the small home- 
bred animals, crossed with the Galloway and some other breeds; 
and of sheep it is the black-faced common Scotch, and a mixed 
breed between these and others brought from Lanark sheep fair 
in August. The cattle are improving insize and shape, in con-

sequence of greater attention paid of late to their improvement ; ' 
and the store-farmers are at considerable pains to improve the , 
breed of their sheep, particularly as to the quantity and quality of 
their wool. But the small tenants, who are allowed to keep only 
a few sheep, in proportion to their rent and the extent of hill pas- 
ture in their respective districts, pay little attention to their im- 
provement in any respect. 

The general character of the husbandry hitherto pursued is not 
much to be commended. The specialties which distinguish it are 
over-cropping, want of proper attention to cleaning, hming, and 
dunging the ground under green crop, and a disregard to any re- 
gular rotation. However, the more slothful and indolent part of 
the tenantry are beginning to follow the example of the more ac- 
tive and industrious, old prejudices and practices are givmg way to 
conviction, a seven shift rotation is becoming more and more ge- 
neral, and an evident change to the better has been gradually tak- 
ino- place since smuggling was suppressed. 

About 312 imperial acres have been brought under tillage in 
the course of the last ten years, by trenching and draining : em- 
banking has been carried on to a considerable extent; but irriga- 
tion, unless in some rare instances, has not been attempted. 
The general duration of leases is nineteen years. 
The state of the farm-buildings in general is above mediocrity ; 
but sufficient enclosures, though becoming more and more com- 
mon, are still wanting in some parts of these parishes. 

At present, the main obstacles to improvement seem to be, the 
low piLs of grain, cattle, sheep, and every sort of farm produce, 
the distance from markets and sea-ports, and a general scarcity ot 

money. . 

There are no mines in these parishes, nor any quarries, except 
two of limestone, and these are wrought by persons who sell the 
limestone to those who want it, at 6d. per cart load. Gramte, 
without quarrying, is found above ground, in quantities sufficient 
for buildiug, and every necessary purpose. 

Produce.-The yearly average gross amount and value of raw 
produce raised in these parishes, for seven years preceding 18o3, 
may be stated as under : l

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Villages, — There are only two villages, — Ballater and TuUicli. 
Ballater, though of recent origin, is much frequented in summer 
by strangers from a distance, on account of the salubrity of the air 
and the beauty of its scenery. Its streets or lanes cross the main 
street at right angles. Its houses are built on a regular plan, and 
neatly fitted up for the accommodation of summer lodgers. A 
post-office is established in it, and it has the advantage of a daily 
post to and from Aberdeen. 

Means of Communication, — There is an excellent commutation 
road on the north side of the Dee to Charleston of Aboyne, where 
it joins a turnpike road, 30 miles in length, leading to Aberdeen. 
On this road, three weekly carriers travel between Ballater and 
Aberdeen ; but, at present, there is no public coach upon it, except 
a mail-coach, which runs daily. There is also a good commutation 
road to Aberdeen on the south side of Dee, and several cross roads 
northward and southward, all kept in a proper state of repair. 

As to bridges, this parish has been very unfortunate. Two ex- 
cellent stone bridges, each consisting of five arches, have been 
swept away by the Dee, within the space of thirty years. The first 
catastrophe was occasioned by an unusually high flood in the end 
of August 1799 ; and the last by a still higher flood on the 4th 
August 1829, of which some notice is taken by Sir Thomas Dick 
Lauder in his account of the floods. The second bridge, which 
stood only twenty years, was erected near the ruins of the first in 
1808—9 ; and the expense of it, between L.4000 and L.5000, was 



"82 ABEllDEENSHIRE. 

defraved, the one-half by public subscriptions, and the other half 
by a grant from the ParliMiTientary Commissioners for Highland 
Roads and Bridges. In 1834, a neat substantial v/ooden br.dge, 
of four arches, was erected on the site of the stone br.dge, of five 
arches, destroyed by the flood in August 1829 ; and the expense 
of this third one, amounting to upwards of L/iOOO was defrayed 
the one-half by public subscriptions, and the other half by a grant 
from the Parliamentary Commissioners for Highland Roads and 

 Nr'the manse, there is a stone bridge, of one arch, across the 
Water of Muick, in the Ime of the road on the south side of Dee. 
There is also another stone bridge, of one arch, across te Water 
of Gairn, in the line of the road on the north side of Dee; and 
both these are of great public utility, and are at present m asub- 

stantial condition. .i .i. 

Ecclesiastical State.-Th parish church stands on the north 
side of Dee, and in the middle of a large open square m the vd- 
laffe of Ballater. It is as central for the three parishes as possi- 
ble • v-t, the extremities being too distant, it is not convenient for 
a gr'eat part of the population. It was built in 1798, has a neat 
SDire is in a good state of repair, and accommodates about 800 
persons, who have all free sittings. On most occasions, it is roomy 
enough, except on the communion Sabbath -then it is by far too 
crowded ; and the reason of this is, that a d.staiit part of the pa- 
rishioners, who attend a missionary chapel at Rinloan, assemble 
,.ith others at the parish church on that day, in order to commu- 

The manse stands on the south side of Dee, and on the north 
side of Muick, on a narrow strip of ground, about 200 yards from 
the point of their junction ; and, following the windings of the road, 
t s nearly a mile south-west from the church. A part of it was 
bunt abo Jt forty years ago ; and a larger and older part appears 
Ton. a date upon it, to have been built in 1725. This older part 
has been repeatedly and recently repaired; but t ne-r can b 
iTade comfortable, because the walls of it have been budt with clay 
instead of lime, and that too in a very --fl'''']:  
The extent of the glebe, m lieu of 3, should be 6 Scotch 
acres, and its value about L.IO per annum ; but, since e flood 
1 R29 an acre of it has been earned away by the Dee. It has been

wards of L.lOO ; and it is hoped this will prevent the river from 
making future encroachments. 

The amount of the stipend is 17 chalders, half meal, half bar- 
ley, standard weight and measure, payable in money, according to 
the county fiars, with L.8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. But 
a part of it was permanently converted into money by the Court 
of Teinds, and is not affected by the fiars. 

There is a missionary chapel at Rinloan in Glengairn, about 
seven miles from the parish church ; and its minister receives L.60 
annually from the Committee for managing the Royal Bounty, 
besides enjoying all the accommodations which they require. 

In these parishes, there are no chapels of ease, Government 
churches, catechists. Dissenting, Seceding, nor Episcopalian cha- 
pels. 

There is one Catholic chapel on Gairnside, about five miles 
north-west from the parish church, and about two miles east from 
the missionary chapel at Rinloan ; and its bishop resides at Pres- 
home in Banffshire. 

The number of families who are members of the Established 
Church is 462; of persons do. 1919. The number of families 
who are members of the Catholic Church is 86; of persons do. 
360. Divine service at the parish church, and also at the chapel 
at Rinloan, is well attended, except on very bad days. The ave- 
rage number of communicants at the Established Church, for the 
last ten years, is 936 ; the average number of young communi- 
cants for the same period is 31 ; and the average of their ages 
about nineteen years. 

No Society for religious purposes has yet been established in 
these parishes. The average amount of church collections yearly 
for the Indian Mission, the Assembly's Schools, the Infirmary at 
Aberdeen, and other religious and charitable purposes, has hitherto 
been about L.12. 

Education. — The total number of schools at present is 8, viz. 1 
parochial, 1 endowed, 1 unendowed, and 5 supported by subscrip- 
tion among the parishioners. The parochial schoolmaster's salary 
M the maximum ; the amount of his school fees and other perquisites 
about L.20 ; and he has the legal accommodations. He has also a 
share of the Dick Bequest. The teacher of the endowed school 
tas a salary of L.15, with the usual accommodations; and the 
amount of fees paid to him is about L.6. The teacher of the un- 
endowed school has a salary of L.30, without any accommodation 



784 ABEIIDEHNSHIRK. 

but a house for teaching ; and the amount of fees paid to him is 
about L 5. The five subscription schools are taught for only 
three or four months in winter; and, during that time, the average 
of the whole emoluments to each teacher, without any accommo- 
dation but a hovel for teaching, is only between L.5 and L.7. 

The. number of the young betwixt six and fifteen years ot age 
who cannot read and write is 370 ; of those upwards of fifteen years 
of age it is 240. Some of the people are not so much alive to the 
benefits of education as might be expected; but, in general, they 
begin to see and appreciate them much better than they did a few 

Thef'are many parts of these parishes by far too distant from 
the parochial school ; but this inconvenience is, m some measure, 
remedied by the western and north-eastern extremities being near 
to the adjoining schools of Strathgirnac, Crathie, and Logie- Cold- 
stone There are, however, two districts, each of which would re- 
quire an additional school,-they being five and six miles distant 
from any school either within or without these parishes, and hav- 
ing each a population of more than 300.  
Library.— h circulating library has been established in Balla- 

riendly Society.— There is a Friendly Society,-St Nathalen's, 
a masonic lodge, whose charter from the Grand Lodge of Scot- 

land is dated 9th May 1815. , uv u A 

Savings Bank.-k parochial Savings Bank was established on 
the 26th February 1821, which, besides a treasurer and clerk, is 
rnanaeed by twelve directors, four of whom go out by rotation at 
the end of every year to make room for as many new ones who 
are then elected to continue in office for three years The in- 
vestments are generally made by servants out of their wages, 
mostly by females ; and the number of depositors has never yet

their relief is L.65, 6s. 6d., viz. church collections, L.41, 13s. 8d. ; 
donations, h.d, 13s. lid.; penalties, L.6, 12s. 6d.; mortcloth dues, 
"6s. 5d. ; and L.IO, the interest of L.250, settled for their behoof, 
at 4 per cent. From tins is to be deducted L.6 for session- clerk's, 
precentor's, and kirk-officer's salaries, or L.2 for each, which leaves 
only L.59, 6s. 6d. to be divided among 84 paupers. Besides what 
has been now stated, there is no other mode of procuring funds for 
their rehef. But here it may be proper to mention, that John Bur- 
nett, Esq. of Dens, and formerly a merchant in Aberdeen, by a deed 
of settlement, left his residuary estate, which turned out to be L.2000 
Sterling, for the following charitable purpose : That is to say — 
he appointed his Trustees and the Synod of Aberdeen to appor- 
tion and divide the interest of it, in the way he has prescribed, for 
the behoof of all the parishes within the county of Aberdeen, with 
the particular exception of the town and parish of Aberdeen, for 
which he had made provision in a prior and separate deed. And 
the method pointed out by the latter deed, here referred to, is 
briefly this,— that his Trustees and the Synod shall, with the ex- 
ception of Aberdeen, take all the parishes within this county in 
rotation ; that, at the beginning of each rotation, they shall deter- 
mine the quantum to be allowed to each parish, according to its 
population, the number of its poor, the extent of its funds, and 
other circumstances at the time ; that no parish shall receive more 
than L.50 nor less than L.20 in each rotation ; that no distinction 
shall be made of persons on account of their religious professions, 
but that preference shall be shown to such as have lived soberly 
and religiously ; that, after having gone over all the parishes in one 
rotation, the managers shall, at the beginning of the next rotation, 
determine the quantum to each parish anew, and proceed as for- 
merly j and so on in all time thereafter. Our parish has been 
found entitled to the maximum, L.50, which it has received twice 
in rotation since the commencement of the distributions, viz. in 
1816 and in 1832. And, it is to be hoped, that it will come round 
again m about half the former time, as an addition has been made 
to the original stock from funds lately realized, which will nearly 
double the interest. 

- It must also be mentioned that, besides this, the Invercauld 
Trustees have under their management the interest of L.500, des- 
tined for poor householders and others in reduced circumstances, 
which they divide annually. With this our session has no farther 
concern than in recommending to the trustees such persons as it

of the parish of Aboyne, which extends down to the river Dee; 
and on the north, partly by the said river, and by a section of 
Aboyne, which stretches to the south of the Dee. 

Topographical Appearances.— The appearance of the parish is 
hilly and mountainous. If viewed from the highest ground on its 
western side, it would be seen to consist of three distinct valleys, 
running eastwards towards the Dee, and separated from each other 
by two ranges of hills. That on the south is the largest, and 
forms the valley of the Feugh. Its western extremity, called the 
Forest of Birse," is narrow, and the appearance of it is bleak 
and wild ; but at the distance of about five miles from its com- 
mencement, the valley expands suddenly to a considerable breadth, 
improving in appearance and in soil, and forming the chief part of 
the property of Finzean. This improvement in its natural fea- 
tures is maintained throughout the valley to its termination at the 
confluence of the Feugh with the Dee, near the village of Ban- 
chory, in Kincardineshire. The total length of the Feugh which 
divides this valley is about fifteen miles, and its termination forms 
one of the loveliest and most romantic scenes on Dee-side. The 
second valley, called " Glen-chatt," is much smaller than the 
first, and the course of the stream which intersects it is shorter. 
Like the former, it is narrow at first, but afterwards expands con- 
siderably, forming the properties of Ballogie and Midstrath. The 
third district is not properly a valley by itself, but forms rather 
one side of the vale perambulated by the Dee at this part of its 
course. There is, however, a small stream of water running 
through it, and dividing it into two parts. Hence it has still 
somethmg ofthe appearance ofa valley, although the ground on the 
north side of it separating it from the Dee is not much elevated 
In the centre of this third district, the church and manse are si- 
tuated. Their position on the north-west side of the parish ren- 
ders the great bulk of the inhabitants at a very inconvenient dis 
tance from church. The scenery in the parish is not sufficiently 
bold to be romantic, but may be called wild. Some of the moun- 
tarns in the parish rise to a considerable altitude. Mount Geanach, 
one ot the Grampian range, being between two and three thou- 
sand feet above the sea. 

Climate —The temperature of the atmosphere is extremely va- 
nable. The climate cannot be called a humid one, yet it is very 
unsteady. Sudden alternations of heat and cold, wet and dry 
eatherare constantly experienced. Severe thunder storms some- 



»gg ADKltDEESSlllRK- 

times happen; but no ease of injury to life or properly from the j 
electric Huid has occurred for many years. 

slrin, - Abundance of common springs of water are found m 
all partTof the parish. A few chalybeates ex,st n, ,., though none 
of rem are of much eminence. One of them, resembhng ,n some

mon and white hare, rabbit; and in the woods the roe and red 
deer. To the feathered tribes, the extent of plantation, and the 
varied surface of hill and dale, afford inviting shelter ; accordingly 
we have a large proportion of them. Among these, may be num- 
bered, the grouse, ptarmigan, blackcock, snipe, partridge, various 
species of ducks, the heron, wood-pigeon, magpie, raven, crow, 
jackdaw, kestrel, hawk-owl, and others. 

Among the songsters of the field we have the goldfinch, chaf- 
finch, redbreast, linnet, yellow-hammer, thrush, blackbird, tit- 
mouse, and many others. Besides these, a great number of aqua- 
tic and other migratory birds frequent, in summer, the fields and 
rivers, such as the oyster-catcher, corncrake, lapwing, swallow, 
wagtail, cuckoo, plover, woodcock, and of late years the curlew. 
Of the insect tribe many varieties are to be found. In the gar- 
dens, a green insect proves often fatal to the blossom of the apple 
trees, and another to the carrots and onions. For these no ef- 
fectual remedy has yet been found. The fly which has so often 
desolated turnip fields in the south, and the insect, if insect it be, 
which has of late years been so destructive to potato cultivation, 
have neither of them appeared in this quarter to any serious extent. 

The breed of cattle in use cannot be distinctly classed, but may 
be called the Aberdeenshire polled and horned. The animals, in 
general, are small in size, and defective in many of the points of 
beauty and value. The breed of sheep in common use is the 
black-faced horned. 

n. — Civil History. 
The ancient history of the parish is involved in much obscurity, 
like that of many others. The multitude of tumuli, however, 
scattered in all directions on the mountain sides, would indicate 
that it was the scene, in former days, of battle and of blood. 
One immense cairn exists in the woods of Finzean, though now 
much beneath its original size ; and on the adjacent hill are to be 
seen a great number of smaller cairns or tumuli ; while a little far- 
ther eastward a long granite stone, such as was used in ancient 
•times to mark the grave of some eminent person, was dug up a 
good many years ago, and now stands on the top of the hill of 
Corsedarder. These appearances taken in connection would lead 
us to the belief of some serious battle having taken place, and 
•that a chief had been killed on the spot alluded to. But whether 
that chief was, as has been said, an ancient king or prince of Scot- 
land, named Dardanus, cannot now be ascertained. It is far from 



790 AUEIIDEENSUIRE. 

unlikely that many of the tumuli every where visible, mark tl« 
restinlace of individuals slain in some highland foray for cattle 
into the lowlands ; for which the upper districts were at one t,me 
so famous. On such occasions, the hills and mountams of th,s pa- 
rish lvin» as they do betwixt the north and the south country, must 
often have been the scene where the fugitives and the pursuers 
encountered each other, and disputed the pr.ze; and these tumuh 
would indicate that the encounters did not always pass over without 
blood. This idea derives some probabihty of truth, from he c.r- 
cumstance, that there is a mountain pass leading through h,s pa- 
rish, across the Grampians, to the south country, known to th.s day 
by the name of the " Cattrin road," or perhaps " raid, -a clear 
proof that this district was at one time well known to, and Ire- 
nuented by, the " Cattrin," in their excursions from the higher  
and more northern districts to and from the south. 

In Spalding's history of the " Troubles of Scotland" occas.onal 
allusion is m'ade to the inhabitants of P- -J'J 
They seem to have followed the fortunes of the Gordon or the 
Hu4 family, and, being opposed to the Covenanters, suffere 
frequent spoliation of their cattle and property from s"-' 
of the latter. The same authority records that several of th m,- 
n Iters of Birse stoutly resisted signing the Covenant and refused 
t X d until high ecclesiastical censures were passed upon them. 

modern times the chief occurrences connected with the pa- 
rish are, Ut, the building of the bridge of Potarch over the 
r 1813 establishing a communication between e parrsh and e 
Deeside turnpike road to Aberdeen, the bu-Wmg of a s -

volutionary war. George Rose, Esq. formerly of the Treasury, was 
grandson of Donald Rose, Esq. of Wester Clune. Captain David 
Ochterlouny, who fell at Quebec with General Wolfe, was one of 
the Ochterlounies of Tillyfrusky. And another branch of the same 
family was the late Sir David Ochterlouny, who died in the East 
Indies a few years ago. To these may be added Bishop Skinner, 
grandfather of the present Bishop Skinner of Aberdeen, who was 
a native of Balfour, and who distinguished himself by various pub- 
lications, and some celebrated Scottish ballads. 

Land-owners. — The proprietors of the parish are, 1. Archibald 
Farquharson, Esq. of Finzean. The family of whom the present 
proprietor is representative, came originally from Braemar, but 
they have held property in this parish for several centuries. The 
second heritor is the Marquis of Huntly. The third heritor is 
Lewis Farquharson Innes, Esq. of Ballogie. The family to which 
he belongs were formerly Farquharsons of Inverey, in Crathie 
and Braemar; but upon their succession to the property of Bal- 
logie, by the extinction of the family of Innes of Balnacraig and 
Ballogie, they have added the name of Innes to the former family 
one. The fourth heritor of the parish is John Mair Gerard, Esq. 
of Midstrath. The oldest son of this family, and the proprietor 
then in possession, fell at Waterloo. 

. Parochial Registers. — The date of the earliest register is 1699, 
from which year, fer a period of eight years, during the ministry of 
Mr John Howe, it is kept with great exactness. From 1707, the 
year of Mr Howe's death, to 1726, the registers are either lost 
or have never been kept. From 1726 to 1744, they are kept 
regularly. From 1744 to 1765, they are again lost. From the 
year 1765, they are kept regularly up to the present day. In 
Mr Howe's Register, many interesting circumstances, connected 

• Since the present Statistical Account was compiled, some years ago, two small

with the State of the church and country, are incidentally noticed. 
Amongst others, the following may be noticed : A letter appears 
on the record, from the above-mentioned Dr Gilbert Ramsay, to 
the kirk-session, intimating his intention to found and endow an 
hospital for the support of a certain number of aged persons, and 
requesting the session to state to him the probable expense. Ihe 
session, however, from motives of delicacy, dechned to do so and 
this first intention appears afterwards to have been abandoned 
for the endowment of a school. About the same time an entry 
is made in the register, of a collection made for the harbour of 
Eyemouth, and again, a second collection for the same purpose 
Nor does a spirit of enlarged charity and sympathy for suffering 
brethren, seem then to have been wanting in the Church of Scot- 
land, for another entry appears of a collection made for the poor 
Christians, prisoners at Algiers. Not the least singular of the 
practices of these past days of our fathers, is the strictness of 
church discipline then prevailing, and the zeal which tey mani- 
fested for the keeping of the Sabbath day, as evinced by the fol- 
lesicu r o , »   was dilated

Antiquities.-neve are no antiquities in the parish of much 
celebrity. In the district called the Forest, stands part of an old 
castella ed ruin, on hich, however, no date can be seen. I ap- 
pears to have been built at a period when there -"e no settle 
inhabitants in that glen. Tradition says it « "'J ;

perfect ruin stands near Easter Clune, beside h.ch had a  
ex sted formerlv an Episcopal place of worship, and a ™all bur 
in "ground. No tradition connected with this rum exists in be 
neilbonrhood. In the charters of Finean, ,t is denominated th 
ort°alice of Easter Clune. In all probability, it was merely the re- 
 „ e of one of the many landholders who formerly held 
property of the parish, and which the lawless state of society en

houses of Finzean and Ballogie. The former is an old house, 
built in the form of three sides of a square ; the latter is, to a 
great extent, a modern building. Both are comfortable mansion- 
houses, but claim no particular notice from their architecture. 
The woods and plantations around each are extensive and thriving, 
and add much to the beauty of the parish. 

III. — Population. 

Previous to Dr Webster's report, no accurate statement of the 
population is on record. The population then given is 1126. 
In 1791, when a correct account of it was taken by the last in- 
cumbent of the parish, it was 1253. From this number the popula- 
tion gradually rose till 1827, when it was 1568. Since that period 
it has been receding. By the census of 1831 it was 1487, and, in 
1837, it was still lower. The cause of the advance and subsequent 
decrease was the same, viz. illicit distillation of whisky. While 
this infamous and demoralizing practice prevailed, population in- 
creased through the facilities by which families were maintained 
among the hills and valleys on its profits. But no sooner was 
this system put down, than the effect appeared on population. 
Fewer marriages than formerly now take place, and a considerable 
number of fanailies, formerly supported by illicit distillation, have 
been obliged to remove to towns and other parishes : a good 
many families, also, have emigrated to America. This is entirely 
a rural parish, there being no village of any kind in it. 

The population may be divided as follows :  

Number under 15 years of age, 526 

between 15 and 30, 327 

30 and 50, 362 

50 and 70, ]91 

above 70, . 64 

1470, — population ill 1834. 
Number of unmarried men above 50, . 16 

women never married, above 45, . 41 

The number of marriages at present subsisting in the pa- 
rish, inclusive of widowers or widows, 259 ; of these, 245 have 
had families, 14 have had no family; besides these, 11 have 
had no family in their present marriage, although one of the 
-parties had a family by a former marriage. In the above, ten 
marriages have had only one child, and eleven marriages have 
had only two children. The average number of children in 
a family is about 4 ; proportion of those marriages produ-

sane, two ; partially insane, one ; fatuous, one ; bhnd, partially, 

two ; deaf and dumb, none. 

Character of the People.- As regards the general character of 
the people, they are more intelligent, and better mformed than 
they formerly were. Newspapers are widely and greedily read, 
and some are anxious to improve their minds from other sources. 
The value of education begins to be more deeply appreciated 
and where the young have the means of obtaining it, they manifes 
much readiness in apprehending the instruction communica d o 
them. In point of morality, the people are generally decent and 
weTbehaved ; the chief excesses whereof they are guilty, arising 
from the abuse of ardent spirits, into which a good ™any occa- 
sionally fall, from the facilities with which spirits are to be had. 

Z respect to religion, a just and proper value is put by the gene 
rality of the people on its ordinances, and much exertion is made by 
those living in the distant corners of the parish to attend church. 

IV. — Industry. . 
JnricuUure.-T\ie number of arable acres in the parish, as 
Jl Z L be ascertained, is about 3360 impenal acres ; but 
he Lar asmall proportion to the unimproved, of wh.ch there are 
nrobably not less than upwards ot 40,000 .mper.al acres Of late 
V ars considerable additions have been made to the arable port 
S he parish, by squaring fields, and draining Pf 
° ,ch is thT rugged and barren nature of the great bulk of the 
emailder, thafany large additions from it - never be mad . 
The number ot acres under wood is as follows ; ou the estate o. 
Sean, ,800 imperial acres ; "[Aboyne about 900 acres ; BaU 
about 960; Mdstrath, SO; m all, 3710. Jl tms larg

into view the size of the different properties, about L.l, 3s. In 
stating this as the average of the parish, it may be mentioned, 
that, along with the land rented, there is conveyed to the tenant 
right to the common pasturage of the hills, for which no separate 
rent is charged ; on which account, the average rent of an acre be- 
comes somewhat higher than it would otherwise be. Moreover, 
since the above average was taken some years ago, rents on some 
of the properties have considerably fallen, and may now be called 
about L.1, 2s. the imperial acre. 

The size of the farms in the parish is comparatively small, the 
generality being from 30 to 60 acres, and only two being above 
100 acres. The chief part of the labour on these farms is done 
by the farmers and their families, for which reason the number of 
farm-servants in the parish is not large. 

Prices. — Fir wood can be bought at from 6d. to 8d. per cubic 
foot. Hard-wood, which is scarce, is a good deal higher. 

Lime, burned in the kilns at home, costs about 7d. per bushel ; 
that brought from Aberdeen Is. 2d., including the expense of car- 
riage. Coals cost about 2s. per barrel, the distance from Aber- 
deen doubling their expense. 

The state of husbandry has been much improved within the last 
twenty years. Previous to that time, regular rotation in cropping was 
scarcely practised, while lime and manure were very sparingly ap- 
plied to the soil. Now the great proportion of the land is farmed 
regularly, and the more enterprising of the farmers are beginning 
to introduce some of the modern improvements in agriculture. 
The rotation of cropping followed is what is called the seven- 
shift, one, which, though it may be doubtful whether it be the 
most proper, is at least better than the former practice of follow- 
ing none. 

The general duration of the leases granted by the proprietors is 
for nineteen years; but in most instances, where tenants are active 
and industrious, these are renewed. Several farms in the parish 
have been occupied by the present tenants and their forefathers for 
centuries. 

The chief difference in the present state of the parish and that 
which existed at the date of the last Statistical report, consists 
in the improved condition of the farm-houses and buildings. 
At that period, not one slated farm-house existed, and both 
dwelling-houses and other erections were built without lime, the 
upper half of either gable generally consisting of turf. Now, how- 



796 ABEHDEENSHIRE. 

ever, all the buildings connected with the farms have assumed a 
more commodious and substantial form. At that period, not a 
thrashing-mill existed ; now, there are upwards of thirty, and every 
-year sees them augmented. 

Frodnce.-The following may be regarded as an approximation 
to the truth in respect to the quantity and value of farm produce 
raised in the parish: Number of arable acres 3360 imperial. Of 
these there may be in oats 960 acres ; in barley, 480 do. ; in hay, 
480 do. ; in grass, 960 do. ; in turnips and potatoes, 480 do. 
Oats, 960 acres at 24 bushels per acre, 23040 bushels ; barley, 
480 acres, 14040 bushels.

dvvellinor of such and find the " shank" absent from her hands, he 
might regard it as an unfailing symptom of indisposition. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Means of Communication. — There is no market-town, village, 
post-office, turnpike-road, public carriage, or canal in the parish. 
The principal roads are the Great North Road from Brechin to 
Huntly and Inverness, across the Cairn o' Mount and Grampians. 
It commences at Whitestone, and extends to Bridge of Potarch, 
a distance of nearly five miles. The other chief road is the South 
Dee-side Road from Aberdeen to Braemar. It commences at 
Whitestone, and extends to the suspension-bridge of Aboyne, a 
distance of about nine miles. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church and manse are situated in the 
north-west corner of the. parish, being about two miles distant from 
the west end, and seven miles from the east — nine or ten miles 
from the south, and half a mile from the northern boundary. The 
church was erected in 1779, and is a plain substantial building, 
capable of containing between 500 and 600 persons. The sittings 
are given over by the landlords to the farmers, who in turn supply 
their dependents. The manse was built at separate times. The 
last addition was made in 1834, rendering it a large and commo- 
dious house. The glebe is of small value, extending to four acres, 
besides the garden, and would probably rent for L.6. The amount 
of stipend is L.150, of which sum L.19 are paid by the Exche- 
quer. There is a snaall Roman Catholic place of worship near 
Ballogie, To this is attached a glebe of about seven acres of 
land, and a house for the residence of the priest. In addition to 
his duty in this parish, the priest has a small chapel in the parish 
of Glenmuick, where he conducts worship once in the month. In 
1834 the number of Roman Catholics in the parish was 59 ; of 
Episcopalians, 2. All the rest belong to the Established Church. 
Average number of communicants, 700. The amount of collec- 
tions, exclusive of those for the ordinary poor, made at church for 
charitable or religious purposes, is about L.12; but occasionally a 
good deal more has been obtained. 

Education.— The number of schools in the parish is three, 
one parochial school, one supported by the Society for Propagat- 
ing Christian Knowledge, in Edinburgh, and one by an endmv 
ment from the fund of Dr G.lbert Ramsay, already mentioned 
resides these, there are generally two or three small schools on the 
teachers' own adventure.

The salary of the parochial teacher is L.30, with the allowance 
from the Dick Bequest, common to the counties of Aberdeen, 
Banff, and Moray; that of the endowed school is L.20, with a 
house, and sIk acres of land ; that of the Society school is L 17, 
with a house, and three acres of land. In the two latter he 
children are taught gratis; in the former, the fees, owing to the 
poverty of the parents, seldom exceed a few pounds. 

Education is more valued by all classes than formerly, and m 
nothing is this more clearly seen than in the additiona number of 
girls which is now to be found in all the schools. None in the 
parish are wholly uneducated, or are entirely incapable of read-

PRESBYTERY OF ELLON, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. GEORGE CRUDEN, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The name Logie is understood to signify a low-lying 
place, and has been aptly applied to an estate of about 300 acres, 
on the south bank of the Ythan, upon which, as situated near a 
principal ferry, the church and manse have been built. From 
this circumstance that small property has given its name to the pa- 
rish. To distinguish it from others, Buchan is the addition made 
to the name, from its lying wholly or in part in that district. It 
is generally considered that Buchan, the most easterly land in 
Scotland, comprehends all that tract of coast which lies between the 
mouthsof the Doveran and the Don, bounded for a certain length at 
least in the interior, by the courses of these rivers. But for two cen- 
turies back there have been some who considered Buchan as not ex- 
tending south of the Ythan. Probably the most ancient division of 
Scotland was into thanedoms, of which more than twenty-seven are 
enumerated on the east coast,t of which Formartin, lying between 
the Ythan and the Don, is one. Earldoms are spoken of as ex- 
isting in the tenth century, and included several thanedoms, 
which were of less extent. That the Earldom of Buchan includ- 
ed Formartin, may be inferred from this, that the diocese of Aber- 
deen comprehended five deaneries, of which Buchan constituted

Hydrographij. — The most remarkable feature in this parish 
is the river Ythan, the Ituna of the ancient geographers.  
Taking its rise in the parish of Auchterless, after a pretty di- 
rect course of about thirty miles, it discharges about 55,000 f 
cubic yards of water per hour into the sea, about three miles be- 
low the church of Logie-Buchan. There, according to the sea- 
. son of the year, and the age of the moon, the ordinary tide rises 
from two to six feet, and occasionally, when aided by a land flood, 
seven or seven and a half feet above extreme low-water mark, at 
which time it is perceptible at the village of Ellon, two miles above 
the church of Logie-Buchan. « In the year 1 642," says Spalding, 
" the tide rose so high as to extinguish the fires in some houses 
both in Newburgh and in Ellon." No such tide is now heard of at 
Ellon ; but whether the sea, as is alleged, be receding on this part 
of the east coast of Scotland, as it undoubtedly has done on some 
others,§ appears to be doubtful. That it has made, if any, a very 
.slow and almost imperceptible retreat of late years in this quarter, 
IS very certain. For in a very accurate plan of the estate of 
Tarty, drawn in the year 1762, the contents of a small island, 
called Inch-Geck, situated about a mile and a half from the sea, 
are 3 acres, 1 rood, 11 falls, and now but 3 acres, 2 roods, 10 falls, 
the addition of 39 falls being off the river side, where, from the 
increased cultivation on its banks of late years, it is not wonderful 
that some additional soil should be deposited. || I have measured

The water of the Ythan is brackish, more or less, for nearly four 
miles, but abounds with trout of various kinds, as the sea-trout, 
bull-trout, yellow or burn-trout, finnock, salmon, eels, flounders, 
&amp;c. The salmon and sea-trout are said by the overseer to ascend 
the river for spawning in summer, and to return towards the sea 
with their fry in the months of March and April following. 
The salmon-fishing, which belongs to the Honourable William 
Gordon of Ellon, has been very unsuccessful of late years. Mr 
Buchan of Auchmacoy has right to a private net for flounder- 
fishing, which he occasionally exercises with success. The river 
is much resorted to by gentlemen from Aberdeen for rod-fishino- 
Otter hunting has lately been practised by parties from Hadd'o 
House, with Lord Aberdeen's hounds. Seals sometimes make 
their appearance in the river, opposite the church. 

The pearl muscle is found in the Ythan; and the pearl-fishery 
seems to have been, in former times, an object of more attention 
than it IS now. My predecessor mentions, that, in the list of un- 
pnnted acts of the first Parliament of Charles I., there is an act 
' for repealing the patent for the pearl-fishery in the Ythan 
granted to Robert Buchan." This gives countenance to a prevJ 
lent tradition that the large pearl in the Crown of Scotland was 
procured in the Ythan, it is said, by a person of the name of 
Jam.eson, and the very spot is pointed out where it was found 
About the middle of last century, a gentleman in Aberdeen got 
U 100 Sterling, from a jeweller in London, for a lot of pe-frls 
found in the Ythan. No wonder, then, that the Ythan has b en 
c lied " the rich rig of Scotland." Pearls of considerable v Jue 
are yet occasionally found in it, during both the droughts of '

mussel and cockle-fishery exists on both sides of the river, near 
the sea, beyond the bounds of this parish. . 

Attracted by the abundance of food found in the river, and on 
the mussel beds and adjoining sleeks, the Ythan is frequented by  
a greater variety of sea-fowl than perhaps any other ."-r in Scot-

II. — Civil History. 
Nothing is known as to the history of this parish prior to the 
sixteenth century; but during the civil and religious contests 
that prevailed during the seventeenth, between the Covenant- 
ers and the Anti-covenanters, this parish had its full share of 
suffering, most of the proprietors being attached to the royal 
cause. Upon the 23d February 1644, when every estate 
was compelled to raise a certain number of men to recruit the 
Scottish army, then in England, "the committee in Aberdeen sent 
forty musketeers to plunder the lands of the lairds of Rainieston, 
Tipperty, Tarty, and the Good-wife of Artrochie, non-subscribers 
of the covenant in this parish." Mr William Innes of Tipperty 
having obtained the assistance of the lairds of Gight, Haddo, and 
other gentlemen, to the number of eighty horse, met the Cove- 
nanters on the bounds of Tarty, defeated, disarmed, and dispersed 
them, to the great offence of the Earl Marischal and Commit- 
tee. « Such alarm did this occasion," says Spalding, « that the 
town of Aberdeen took instant measures for the defence of the 
city." The consequences of this skirmish give it an importance 
beyond what itself merits ; for it was the immediate occasion of 
that hasty rising of the Gordons, the ill success of which compelled 
the Marquis of Huntly to flee his country, and brought Sir John 
Gordon to the block ;f and for his behaviour, Mr Innes's house 
of Tipperty was plundered in May following, and his meal-mill 
burned. 

Nor were the proprietors of the above named estates the only 
heritors ofLogie-Buchan who opposed the Covenanters; for Spal- 
ding farther informs us, that, « upon the 27th April of the same 
year, forty-four soldiers belonging to Mr William Seton of She- 
thm, Mr James Buchan of Auchmacoy, and Mr James Seton of 

JwJrn'" '2f'"''"':g Peterhead to Aberdeen, would be shortened upwards of

Pitmedden," who then had lands in this parish, « lay in Aber- 
deen four days, upon the charges of the poor Old town people, 
while the Marquis of Huntly was there. 

The family of Auchmacoy continued steady in their attachment 
to the house of Stuart, and, in particular, the- services of Major- 
General Thomas Buchan deserve notice. He was third son of 
James Buchan of Auchmacoy, by Margaret Seton, daughter of 
Alexander Seton of Pitmedden. He was born about the middle 
of the seventeenth century, and after serving in subordinate ranks 
in France and Holland, in 1682, was appointed by- King Charles U. 
Lieutenant-colonel, and in 1686, by James VH Colonel of the 
Earl of Mar's Regiment of Foot in Scotland. Having received 
the thanks of the Privy-Council for various services he was in 
1689 promoted by King James to the rank of Major-General and 
after the fall of the celebrated Dundee at the batt e of KiUiekran- 
kie, and the repulse of General Cannon at Dunkeld, obtained the 
command' of King James's forces in Scotland. Although 
in that high command, he fortunately failed m '"t-ving the for- 
tunes of the fallen monarch, yet there are letters to the General 
d other documents, in the custody of the present Mr Buchan of 
Auchmacoy, from King James, his Queen, their f  elfor 
and others which demonstrate their undiminished confidence in 
his military skill, and his attachment to their cause. 

There L be Uttle doubt that General Buchan, though n in 
command, was present with the Marquis's troops at the battle of 
sSmJir, on' the 13th November foUowing: "

It appears from Robertson's Index of scarce Charters, that the 
Buchans of Auchmacoy were proprietors of that estate so far back 
as the year 1318, holding it of the Earl of Buchan until the for- 
feiture of the too powerful Cummings in the reign of King Ro- 
bert Bruce. In 1503, James IV. gave Andrew Buchan of Auch- 
macoy a new charter, and erected his lands into a free barony, 
which has been inherited by his lineal male descendants ever since. 
Mr Buchan lately built an elegant turreted mansion, after a plan 
by Mr Burn, Edinburgh. 

John Gordon Cumming Skene of Pitlurg and Dyce, proprietor 
of Birness in this parish, claims even a higher antiquity for his fa- 
mily than that of Auchmacoy, tracing their origin from Adam de 
Gordun, who first settled in Scotland in 1057. During the 785 
years which have elapsed since that period, there have been, ac- 
cording to Burke's History of the Commoners of Great Britain 
and Ireland, twenty-seven clear and uninterrupted descents in the 
lineal male line of Pitlurg, the present proprietor being the chief 
representative of the family. 

I cannot here omit taking particular notice of one of the Pitlurg 
family, who greatly distinguished himself as a literary character, I 
mean Robert Gordon, commonly designated " Gordon of Stra- 
loch," from his having purchased that estate lying in Formartine, 
to which district he seems to have been very partial. I notice 
him the rather that I have in this account quoted so largely from 
his most celebrated work, " Theatrum Scotise." He was born 
iu 1580, and educated at Marischal College, Aberdeen, of which 
University he was the first graduate. 

At the request of King Charles I. in 1641, he undertook an 
Atlas of the different counties of Scotland ; and by two Acts of 
the Scottish Parliament, was, on that account, exempted from mi- 
htary burdens, while his labours were held in such general estima- 
tion, that he received a recommendation from the General Assem- 
bly to the clergy, to give him all the assistance in their power in the 
execution of his work. This undertaking, the first of the kind in 
Scotland made from actual survey, was completed in 1648, and 
published by the Bleaus of Amsterdam, and to this day remains a 
monument of his industry and accurate knowledge of practical 
mathematics. Mr Gordon wrote several other works, some of 



gOS ABERDEENSHIRE. 

which are said still to remain in manuscript. Two pictures of 
him remain, beheved to be by Jamieson of Aberdeen, one in 
Marischal College, the other at ParkhiU, the residence of the 

present Mr Gordon of Pitlurg. 

Parochial Registers.- ks to parochial registers, the sessional 
record of doctrine and discipline is extant, and regularly kept from 
1698, with some fragments so far back as 1630 and 1640 Re- 
gisters of marriages and baptisms are also kept, and extend from 
1698 ; but the latter by no means comprehends all the births. 

The deficiency of our session records is in so far supplied by 
our presbytery registers. These begin five years after the insti- 
tution of presbyteries 1592, the first meeting of the Presby- 
tery of Ellon being held, as it is expressed in the record, « on the 
Tenult day of November 1597." It may be noticed, what is known 
in other cases, that in our Presbytery records the beginning 
of the year was reckoned from the vernal equinox, or 1st ot 
April, as., and continued to be so till the year 1600, when 
it commences with the 1st of January. The eight parishes of 
which this Presbytery consists previously belonged to the Pres- 
bytery of Aberdeen. From our records chiefly the ollowing list 
0 thJministers of Logie-Buchan is made up 1. Mr Alexander Ar- 
buthnot, settled in 1568. 2. Mr John ' P

The first of these ministers, Mr Alexander Arbuthnot, was by 
far the most distinguished. Though the honour of his mmistry 
has been assigned 'by Mr Kennedy and some others to the par. 
of Logiepert, yet the highest authorities concur with Dr M Lr.e,

in his Life of Melville, that he was minister of Logie-Buchan. And 
this is put beyond all doubt by an insertion lately discovered in 
an old missal or obituary, in the possession of the present Vis- 
count Arbuthnot; which also corrects another error into which 
almost all his biographers have fallen, viz. that he was the son of 
Baron Arbuthnot. In the manuscript he is stated to be the son 
of Andrew Arbuthnot of Pitcarles, the baron's brother. He was 
born in 1538, educated at King's College, Aberdeen, and in the 
year 1560 his name appears in a list of young men of promising 
talents for the ministry, given in to the first General Assembly of 
the Church of Scotland. After further studying civil law, as was 
then usual for students of Divinity, four or five years at Bourges 
in France, under the celebrated Cujaccius, he returned to Scot- 
land in 1 566, and was soon after licensed as a minister of the re- 
formed church. On the 15th July 1568, he received a presenta- 
tion to the church of Logie-Buchan, one of the common kirks of 
the Cathedral of Aberdeen. On the 3d of July 1569, he was ap- 
pointed Principal of King's College, Aberdeen, and three weeks 
after was presented to the church of Arbuthnot, " provyding he 
administrat the sacraments of Jesus Christ, or ellis travell in some 
.other als necessar vocation to the utility of the kirk, and approvit 
by the samen." The emoluments of his two parochial charges 
were probably his only support as Principal, the funds of the Col- 
lege having been greatly dilapidated by his predecessor. Principal 
Anderson, in the view of his deposition for his adherence to Po- 
pery. To the University, Principal Arbuthnot rendered the most 
important services, both in the augmentation of its funds,-- and by 
his assiduity and success in teaching. Besides being an emi- 
nent divine, he is said to have been a good mathematician, jurist, 
physician, and poet. 

To the Church of Scotland Mr Arbuthnot's services were in- 
valuable. He took an active part in the leading ecclesiastical 
questions of his time, was frequently a member, and twice mode- 
rator, J of the General Assembly. In 1578, he was appointed one 
of a committee to attend the King and Queen about the affairs of 
the church, and along with John Knox he revised the Second 
Book of Discipline, and assisted in drawing up that solemn and im- 
pressive form for the ordination and admission of ministers of the 
gospel which is still in use. How he discharged his duties as mi-

nister of this parish, there is no tradition nor record, our presby- 
tery registers commencing fourteen years after his death, and our 
parochial forty-seven. By his learning, his great candour, and 
power of persuasion, he is said to have been instrumental ui open- 
ing the eyes of many to perceive and renounce the errors which 
had crept into the Christian church during the dark ages : and in 
this parish I have discovered no remnant of Popery since his time, 
except that, about the end of the seventeenth century, Alexander 
Buchan of Auchmacoy took priest's orders in the church of Rome, 
and resigned his estate in favour of his younger brother, Major 
James Buchan. 

Mr Arbuthnot died unmarried, « at night, on the 16th October 
1583," in the forty-sixth year of his age, and sixteenth of his mi- 
nistry in this parish. The only book his active life left him lei- 
sure to publish, was " Orationes de Origine et Dignitate Juris," at 
Edinburgh, in 1 572. How amiable his life was, and how sincere- 
ly lamented his early death, will appear from the following lines 
extracted from his elegy, written by the celebrated Andrew Mel- 

" Flerem ego, nec flenti foret, aut pudor aut modus, eheu  

Flerem ego te, te eheu  flerem ego perpetuo, 

Deliciae humani generis, dulcissime rerum, 

Quem Musffl et charites blando aluere sinu ; 

Cujus in ore lepos, sapiens in pectore virtus; 

Et suada; et sophiaj vis bene juncta simul ; 

Cui pietas, cui prisca fides, constantia candor 

Et pudor etprobitas non habuere parem." 

Mr Read, the second minister in the above list, seems to have 
been an active man, and to have taken a particular interest in the 
erection of the parish of Udny. Yet it appears a complaint was 
lodged against him, as contained in the following minute of Pres- 
bytery, which is too curious to be omitted : 

"Logie Buchan, 1st September 1620, convenit the Bishop of 
Aberdeen and Presbytery of Ellon, with the gentlemen of the pa- 
rish of Logie, and elders thereof, for visitation of the kirk ot 
Loffv-buchan. Mr John Read, minister at Logy-buchan, being 
challengit of non-residence, answerit the want of peits and want ot 
ane sufficient gleib was the cause thereof. The gentlemen and 
elders of the parish foresaid consulting about the matter, and ad- 
mitting partly that it might prevent Mr Read they advised, a he 
instance of the bishop and presbytery, to allow h.m ' sax lei t of

peits, of 24 feet in length ilk leit, and 12 feet in breadth, with 
height effeirand, which would be sufficient for him, yearlie ;' the 
partsh being willing likewise to lead said peits, and ' Mr Kuchan 
to give the coble.' " That so respectable a body of men should 
have allotted, or that the tenantry should have agreed to carry, so 
enormous a quantity of fuel, nearly 300 modern cart loads, is not 
easily accounted for. The allotment, indeed, was soon necessari- 
ly discontinued ; but it would be unpardonable in me not to record 
the ready consent both of the heritors and people that their minis- 
ter should have a warm fireside. 

III. — Population. 
In the year 1607, by a note in our Presbytery records, the 
number of communicants is estimated at 400, which exceeds, by 
about fourscore, the average number who have been admitted to 
the Lord's table of late years. The greater population at that 
time may be ascribed to the Ferry of Logie being then the great 
thoroughfare from the north-east part of Buchan to Aberdeen, — 
the principal road being along the sea-shore of Belhelvie. There 
was then a considerable kirk-town where markets were held, and 
one or more alehouses kept. There had been also more resi- 
dent heritors, smaller farms, and a more numerous tenantry. The 
number of parishioners which, in Dr Webster's time, had fallen 
to 575, was, in 1797, so low as 509. But, from the extensive 
agricultural improvements which then commenced, and an unli- 
mited power of subletting on some estates, it has been gradually 
increasing.

Character of the People.-The people, on the whole, enjoy, m 
a reasonable degree, the comforts of social life, according to their 
stations. The use of tobacco is excessive, but of ardent spirits 
rare There is a, remarkable annual change in the population, 
owino- chiefly to servants changing their places. My hsts show 
that it amounts to one-fifth of the inhabitants. This migratory 
nature of the population is certainly not favourable to religious in- 
struction. Public worship and diets of catechising are well attend- 
ed • rehgious ordinances are very rarely neglected. The average 
number of young communicants for the last seven years is 15, 
and their average age nineteen years. •, -n u , 

In the beginning of the seventeenth century, the Fresbytery 
took vigorous measures for suppressing tulzyinff wrestling, toot- 
ball, and even holding markets at churches, on the Lord s day

even on week- days. The point of honour now among men-ser- 
vants is, who shall be the best ploughman  Music is cultivated 
Boat of Logie" is still a well known tune ; but to the beautiful 
song of « Logie o' Buchan" we can lay no claim. 

IV. — Industry. 
The parishioners are, with few exceptions, very sober, and most 
industrious in their respective calhngs, which are almost all con- 
nected, directly or indirectly, with the cultivation of the soil. 1 he 
amount of their labours is estimated as follows 

Oats, 6133 quarters, at L.1 per quarter, -  L-6133 0  

Bear, 343 L.l, 5s. - q q

Improvements. — Various are the agricultural improvements that 
have taken place during the last forty years. From the commence- 
ment of that period, we date the introduction of a regular rotation of 
crops upon inclosed farms, which gradually extended itself to un- 
enclosed ground. The most common rotations are those of five or 
six years, with one grain crop, and of seven years, with two grain 
crops, after lea. The introduction of various species of early oats 
and greater attention to seed-corn in general have been going on 
since the late and calamitous harvest of 1782. The introduction 
of bone manure and the short-horned breed of cattle, and the con- 
temporaneous opening of the English markets for fat cattle by 
steamers, have been productive of the greatest benefit to the agri- 
cultural interest. The general sale of grain by weight has re- 
deemed Buchan victual from its ancient reproach, and given oats, 
its staple produce, a high character in the London market. An- 
other very important advantage has been gained to the agricultu- 
rist by the abolition of services, and particularly of thirlage and 
multure, which, with the improved state of meal-mills having dry- 
ing kilns attached, and the low rate of 6d. or 7d. for milling the 
imperial boll, are considered to be a gain of no less than 20 per 
cent, upon the return of meal. 

The universal adoption of the scythe in place of the sickle in 
harvest is likewise considered here as a very great improvement, 
both as to expedition and expense. Under favourable circum- 
stances, one scythe will cut two acres in a day. The fields are all 
rolled after sowing. Besides these advantageous changes in the 
general system of farming, there have been many improvements in 
the implements of husbandry, which need not be enumerated here. 

There is a field of excellent clay, of considerable extent and 
depth, on the farm of Westfield of Auchmacoy, upon which, in the 

 One, as yet peculiar to this parish, may be mentioned, viz. a simple, cheap, and 
efiScient " self-acting flood sluice," for placing in embankments on the side of a river, 
particularly of a tide river; for which the Highland and Agricultural Society voted 
their silver medal. See their Transactions in 1837.

year 1834, Mr Brown, the tenant, erected a brick-work. At this 
place drain-tiles were first made north of the Tay. The quahty 
is approved of, and the demand is considerable, and progressively 
increasing. 

v.— Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town, ,c.—T\e church of Logie Buchan is situated 
fifteen miles north of Aberdeen, the nearest market-town. The 
nearest post-town is Ellon, which lies two miles west. There are 
three portions of turnpike road in the parish, amounting together 
to about five and a half miles. Two portions of these are on the 
great north road to Aberdeen, on which the mail, and other pub- 
lic coaches, travel twice a day. On the other portion, leading 
to the shipping port of Newburgh, there is a great traffic earned 
on by the tenantry in lime, grain, &amp;c. 

Ecclesiastical Stofe— Considering the great length of the pa- 
rish, the church is as conveniently situated as it could be. It 
was' built in 1787 to hold 400 persons, and is in good repair. 
The sittings are all free, except about 50 in a gallery lately erect- 
ed by the kirk-session, with consent of the heritors, out of legacies 
left by Mr Paterson, late minister of the parish, and his widow, 
to purchase coals for the poor. The sittings are rented at from 
6d. io 2s. 6d. each. 

_ The manse was built in the year 1775, and is needing no re- 
rjair The extent of the glebe, as laid down in the plan of 1 arty, 
before-mentioned, is 5 acres, 2 roods, 33 falls, including the toft, 
besides the usual privileges. Its value is estimated at L.12, 10s. 
The stipend is 14 chalders. Mr Buchan is patron 

The number of persons attending the Established Church is

3ofh of August 1721, that the heritors of this parish agreed to

sides of it. Agreeably to the tenor of that Act, the salary is 
now L.25, 13s, 4tl,, with accommodations. By an arrangement 
lately made with Mr Dick's Trustees, the school is in charge of an 
assistant teacher. All the usual branches are taught, and the fees 
are from 2s. to 5s. per quarter, and may amount, at an average, 
to about L.20 per annum. The average number of scholars is 
just now about 50, 

Considering the changeable state of the population, it is impos- 
sible to give an exact account of the general attainments of the 
people in learning ; but it is believed that few or none cannot read, 
and almost all can write a little, and all seem alive to the benefits 
of education. On the south side of the river, a few children cross 
the ferry to the parochial school. Some are taught by a woman 
about a mile from the church ; but the greater number are com- 
pelled to attend the schools in other parishes most adjacent. The 
late Mr Donaldson of Rosebank a part of whose property lies 
in this parish, bequeathed the bulk of his fortune for religious 
and educational purposes, and from his trustees the minister lately 
received the sum of L,5 Sterling for purchasing books for the 
Sunday school and parish libraries, now amounting to 400 volumes. 

This parish is in connection with the district Saving Bank, late- 
ly established in Ellon. 

Poor. — The number of persons receiving parochial aid has 
greatly increased within these few years, for which no particular 
reason can be assigned. The following account of the receipts

Miscellaneous Observations. 1 
Being one of the few whom it has pleased God to spare to as- 1 
sist in drawing up a second Statistical Account of Scotland, I 
may be allowed, more than others, to express my satisfac ion at 
the vast improvements in agriculture which have taken place m 
Buchan sin'ce I transmitted to Sir Jbn Smcla. an accoun 
of the parish of Old Deer in the year 1794. When I look 
around me, I seem to live not only among a new race of men 
but in a new world. Cultivation, like the gradual spreading of a 
garment, has changed the external face of the earth and every 
focality wears a new appearance. The irregular patches, and va- 
rious denominations of arable land which were then m terspersed 
amidst the uncultivated waste, are now absorbed m regular enclo- 
sures or extensive fields, the dark expanse of moss Satly d - 
finished, and the sombre herds of our natwe brown bk 
tie are enlivened by a mixture of the white and speckled Tees- 
wate The low-thatched farm-houses and long continuous ro. 
Tf barns and byres are now converted into slated dwellings of 
two stories, and adjoining courts of offices; and, where necessary 
the steep and rugged tracks that led to them into smooth roads of 
easv asc nt On great and indispensable means of these changes

rated is not to be denied him, especially as it is not doubtful that 
the temporal advantages which it confers have a happy influence 
even on the manners of the people. From the perusal of the re-i 
cords of our Presbytery, I am disposed to think that the com- 
mission at least of heinous crimes is less frequent, and the propen- 
sity to low vices less general, than they were during the seven- 
teenth and greater part of the eighteenth century, and also that a 
higher tone of morals now prevails.

PRESBYTERY OF GARIOCH, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. GEORGE PETER, A. M., MINISTER. 



I- — Topography and Natural History. 
ExtenL—TuE measurement of the estate of Kemnay, according 
to the last survey, is 3306 acres and a fraction; that of Lord 
Kmtore's property in the parish, 524 acres and a fraction ; several 
hundred acres are covered with thriving plantations. The whole 
parish was the property of the Earl of Kintore, and of our only 
residmg land-holder, John Burnett, of Kemnay, Esq., till of late 
when Lord Kmtore was authorized by law to sell part of his entailed 
Kemnay property to Colonel Eraser of Castlefraser, for the re- 
demption of his land-tax. Kemnay is from 4 to 5 miles in length, 
but, be.ng of an irregular figure, it is not easy to ascertain its 
mean breadth, which may be perhaps nearly three miles. 

Boundaries.~This parish is fifteen miles west of Aberdeen the 
county town. It is bounded on the east, by Kintore; on the

south, by Skene; on the west, by Cluny ; and on the north, 
north-east, and north-west, by the rWer Don, and by a tributary 
of the Don, named the burn of Ton, which divide it Irom the pa- 
rishes of Monymusk, Chapel of Garioch, and Inverury. 

Eivers -The Don and the burn of Ton. The former used to 
abound throughout in excellent salmon. A very great proportion 
is now intercepted by the stake-nets and cruives at and near the 

mouth of the river. . 

Surface and So7.-The surface of this parish is rather fla up- 
on the whole. The greater part of the soil is a light mould, lying 
on sand. We have alluvial lands on the bais of the Don and the 
Ton, which are a fine rich loam, deep, and free from stones ; but 
they are not of great extent. The soil of our rising grounds is 
for the most part, bedded on clay, and is generally observed to 
improve in richness and fertility as the plough ascends to the 
hiffhest point of elevation. 

There was, in Kemnay, a very considerable extent of peat-moss ; 
but by much the greater part of it has been consumed in fuel, and 
converted by draining into corn-land. 

n.— Civil History. 
Parochial Registers.-We have seven volumes of parochial re- 
gisters, five of which are very thin, the oldest beginnmg with he 
tear 1660. They seem to have been regularly kept, and the 
volumes themselves are in sufficient preservation and are all e- 
Ze The two first contain a register of burials, .-hich appears 
to have been discontinued early in the last century. 

Anti,uities.-Tl.e only remains of antiquity tat are ext- n 
this narish are, 1. a long stone set on end, whose height s 1 U teet 
Wound/and its mean girth about 9 feet, quite in the state in 
lich it was found in the earth ; and, 2. that sort of repository for 
The em Jns of the dead which is called a cest.aen, about 5 feet in 
encth and 2 feet wide, fenced on the four sides below ground 
iTth four stones, and covered with a broad piece of granite all 
The stones being undressed, and containing a broken urn of burn- • 
erclay and : lew human iones. It was accidentally uncovered 1 
by the plough.

All are of tlie Established religion, excepting a few Dissenters, 
chiefly Independents, to which connection the principal landhold- 
er and his family belong. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — Scarcely any farinaceous grain, besides oats and 
bigg, is sown in the parish ; very few pease, and very little wheat. 
Every farmer and cottager has a certain extent of his land, pro- 
portioned to his holding, in turnips and potatoes, every year, 
which are succeeded, next season, by bear or oats, with rye-grass 
and clover. The most common rotation is the Berwickshire, but 
it begins to be thought too exhausting for our light soil ; and al- 
though some of the landholders of the county bind their tenants 
to this rotation, others prefer a six or a seven years' shift, the for- 
mer including two, and the latter three white crops. The gene- 
ral duration of leases is nineteen years. 

V. — Parochial Ecokomy. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is not exactly in the 
centre of the parish, but its site is nearly as convenient for the 
parishioners as it could be. It is not above three miles from the 
most distant house in the parish, and the greater part of the po- 
pulation is within a mile and a-half from it. It was built, as ap- 
pears from an inscription on the belfry, in 1632. It was pro- 
bably erected on the site of one of the tituli, which, in Roman 
Catholic times, depended on the parsonage of Kinkell, to which 
the parish of Kemnay belonged in the beginning of the fifteenth 
century. It was repaired in 1794, but is, at present, in; a very 
insufficient state. Owing to the thickness of the walls, and the 
smallness of all the windows save two, it is not well lighted. It 
cannot be sufficiently ventilated, for the floor is from three to 
four feet below the level of the burying-ground, which is highest 
at the front wall of the building. It is consequently damp. It 
affords accommodation to nearly 500 sitters. Almost alV the 
farmers and crofters have free sittings on the ground floor. The 
seats on the site of the communion table, and those of two galle- 
ries, belong to the kirk-session, as administrators for the poor, out 
of whose funds they were built, and for them the session draws 
annually, at 6d. each, nearly L. 4. 

The present manse was built in 1796, and succeeded a manse 
which, in 1680, was built at the sole expense of the then minister, 
and was, with great propriety, denominated Castle Folly. Ar- 
rangements have been concluded for repairing the present build-

ing and erecting an addition. The glebe, including tlie garden, 
the site of the manse and offices, and the road by which it is ap- . 
preached from the public highway, is nearly ten Scotch acres m 
extent, about three acres of which, of the most worthless soil, cal- 
led grass land, the present incumbent reclaimed from heath and 
marsh. The glebe is valued at L.IO per annum. 

The stipend is L.150, of which, L.33, 6s. lOd. is received from 
the Exchequer. The communion element money amounts to 

'irJl.-There is no seminary of learning in the parish but 
the parochial school, with which Mr Stevenson the present enter- 
prising schoolmaster, has conjoined an academy for the educationot 
boysof a higherclass. Of these he hasnow about thirty, from differ- 
ent parts of the kingdom, under his charge ; and, including these, he 
has about 160 scholars in the course of the year. The salary amounts 
to L.25, 1 3s. 4d. The schoolmaster also enjoys the interest of 850 
merks Scots, bequeathed, many years ago, by different individuals 
for promoting education in the parish, and under the administration 
of the kirk-session, who lend it at interest along with the funds 
of the poor. He also participates in the Dick bequest. 

Lihrary.-We have for some years had a parish library con 
sisting of works on divinity, civil and ecclesiastical history, and 

'Tot and Parochial Funds.-The average """ .Jf 
poor is 26, chiefly widows and single women. We divide among 
Lm what is under the administration of the kirk-session, at ou 
terms, giving sometimes occasional aid meases of distress. Some 
of thm receive nearly L. 3 a-year, some L. 2 others L I 6 - 
and three or four L. 1, 4s., each, according to their respective 

pari oi luc J T on when our turn comes, from tne

for the relief of the poor and distressed over the whole of their 
bounds, appointing the interest thereof to be paid in rotation to 
the several kirk-sessions of the synod, the lowest allowance to 
any kirk-session being L. 20. In general, our poor have shown 
great unwillingness to accept parochial relief. This feeling is now, 
however, less prevalent than formerly.

PEESBYTEEY OF GARIOCH, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. THOMAS BURNETT, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — Daviot, — in Keith's Catalogue of Scottish Bishops 
spelled also Davot, — may perhaps be a modification of the Gaelic 
Dabhoch, pronounced Davoch, of which, in a dictionary of this 
language, is given the following account : " Dabhoch-oicli, sub. 
fem., a farm that keeps 60 cows : Ager sexaginta boves pas- 
cens. Davata. Law Lat. — In the Hebrides a Davoch of land is 
a farm adequate to the pasture of 320 cows. Scot. Dawache of 
land." 

Extent, Sfc. — Its average length is about 3 miles, and its average 
breadth about 2. It is bounded by the parish of Fyvie on the 
north ; the parishes of Fyvie and Meldrum on the east ; the pa- 
rishes of Bourtie and Chapel of Garioch on the south ; and by 
the parish of Rayne on the west. 

Two quoad sacra annexations were made to Daviot by act of 
Assembly in the end of the seventeenth century, viz. part of the 
parish of Fyvie lying on the north-east, and part of the parish of 
Chapel of Garioch on the south, so that ecclesiastically its extent 
of surface is now about 8 square miles. 

Topographical Appearances. — A gently undulated ridge passes 
through the middle, and traverses nearly the whole length of the 
parish from north to south, and two shorter lateral ridges of infe- 
rior elevation, one on each side, slightly undulated also, complete 
the figure of the parish. 



822 ADEIIDEENSHIKE.  

The climate of the parish is, on the whole, dry, airy, and salu- 
brious, and accordingly the inhabitants enjoy ingeneral goodhealth. , 

Soil.-Theve is a considerable variety of soils in the parish. 
On the higher grounds, a gravelly thin soil,-on those of less ele- 
vation, a rich loam and strong clay,-and on the lower grounds 
generally, a bluish clay underneath a formation of peat of inconsi- 
derable depth ; and these soils rest partly on rocks of wh.nstone 
and iron, and partly on granite of inferior quality. 

n.__ClVlL HiSTOllY. , 

Parochial Register s.-The parochial records are neither volu- 
minous nor of an early date. The first entry m the record o bap- 
tisms appears to have been made on 10th March If J; tha m 
the poor cash register on the 3d March 1731 ; and that m the 
record of disciphne on the 30th May of the same year 

ArUiguities.-On the lands of Mounie, and on the highes 
ground in the parish, the remains of two Druidical temples are still 
Observable. The remains of a third ere to be seen, withm the 
last twenty years, in the grave-yard; but the atones were som 
time ago removed, and employed as materials in building the walls 

of a dwelling-house. „ . , i • u 

There is a small enclosure on the lands of F.ngask, which ap- 
pears to have been used formerly as a burial-ground And m this 
enclosure were to be seen the remains of what was beheved to have 
been a Roman Catholic place of worship, from the circumstance 
of a silver crucifix being found by the workmen m digging tor he 
foundation of a mausoleum, erected by the late proprietor on the 
spot about forty years ago ; and of there being a - » 1" « " 
diate neighbourhood, which still bears the "ame of " The Lad, s 
or " Our Lady's Well." The foundations of a bu, ding, said also 
to have been a Roman Catholic chapel, with a well close by, oc- 
casionallv attracted notice a few years ago on .the es ate o Le- 
thenir The well is still visible ; but no vestige of the building 

Tatid of a farm on the property of Glack was dug up, in 
,833, a s ec s of battle-axe, which is now in the proprietor's po. 
e,ln. The handle and head are both of iron,-the forme 30 
n he on., and the latter 6 inches long on the one side and 3i 
h on tiio other, and varying from 4 to 4i inches in br h 
Both sides of the head appear to have been pened l s P 
posed to have been used at the Batlfe of Harlaw, fought in 
adjoining parish of Chapel of Garioch in 141 1.

There is now in the writer's possession a silver coin, which was 
dug up in some years ago, in a small kitchen garden, wherein stood 
formerly the old manse. It is larger but thinner than a shilling 
of the present coinage. On one side is Elizabeth : D : G : Ang : 
Fr : et Hi : regina, around the Queen's head, and on the other, 
the royal arms, surrounded by the following inscription; . . . 
Posui Deu adjutorem meii ; but there is no date upon it. 

A small pot or cooking utensil, of rather an elegant shape, was 
turned up on a waste part of a field, of a farm on the property of 
Mounie in 1834, and is now in the farmer's possession. It is made 
of bronze, has evidently been subjected to the action of fire, and 
may probably have been left by the troops which crossed this part 
of the country in 1745-6. Its depth is seven inches, its diameter, 
where widest, eight inches, the diameter of its neck, where nar- 
rowest, four inches and three-fourths, and the diameter of its 
mouth six inches, all inside measure. 

In 1834, a handsome substantial mansion-house was built by 
the present proprietor on the estate of Fingask, in the erection of 
which the stone chiefly employed was granite.

IV. — Industry. ; 
The industry of the parish may be best exliibited in the follow- 
ing tabular form, which shows the employment of its respective 
householders : Resident proprietors and farmers, 2 ; ministers, 1 ; 
schoolmasters, 1 ; farmers, 49 ; farmers, merchant tailors, and 
inn-keepers, 1 ; farmers and inn-keepers, 1 ; farmers and wrights 
1 ; farmers and millers, 3 ; crofters, 16 : crofters, merchants, and

sons, 2 ; crofters and wrights, 3; crofters and blacksmiths, 2; 
crofters and shoemakers, 2; crofters and tailors, 1 ; crofters and 
weavers, 2; crofters and fish-carriers, 1; crofters and labourers, 
10; manufacturers, 1; gardeners, 1; midwives, 1; merchants 
and wrights, 1 : wrights, 2; blacksmiths, 2 ; shoemakers, 1; la- 
bourers, including decayed old men and women, householders, 34; 
total, 144. Male-servants above twenty years of age employed in 
agriculture, 65; do. under twenty, employed in agriculture, 44; 
female servants above twenty, 36 ; female servants under twenty, 
28; male servants above twenty employed in handicraft, 5 ; do. 
under twenty, employed in handicraft, 2; total, 180 = 324; and 
the married women, and such of the inhabitants' children as 
are not in service, and continue to reside in the parish, make up 
the remainder of the population. The whole population of the 
parish may be thus classified ; 144 occupants of houses; 99 mar- 
ried women, 362 children, and 180 servants. 

Jgriailture.—The land in the parish under tillage measures 
about 3700 acres; the waste land, 150, of which 120 will, at no 
distant period, be improved ; in wood, 180; and in moss, 100; in 
whole about 4130 Scotch, or nearly 5250 imperial acres. Ihe 
plantations within the parish are chiefly of Scotch fir and larch. 
These continue to grow for about forty or fifty years, seldom at- 
taining any great size, and then begin to decay. No good 
mode of thinning has been sufficiently attended to; and n- 
sequently the value of the whole is comparatively small. Ihe 
soil seems much better adapted for the growth of hard-wood, 
chiefly beech, elm, and ash ; and of these there are some very 
good specimens in the parish, and especially around the mansion- 
house of Glack. The mode of filling up blanks where they have 
occurred in these plantations, when they are somewhat advanced, 
seems to have been utterly unprofitable. Young plants stuck m 
among trees of twenty or thirty years growth have either died out, 
or rapidly shot up to a great height, without attaining any useful 



DAVIOT. 



825 



or profitable thickness. The error of this method has now be- 
come evident, and a plan, apparently more judicious, is adoptedj 
namely, rooting up and removing those parts of the plantations 
which do not seem thriving, digging large pits, in many cases 
trenching would be preferable, and planting the young trees in 
masses, and such kinds only as appear to have thriven best in the 
soil. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of arable land in the parish 
per acre is a little above L.l, Is. 

Rate of Grazing. — An ox or cow may be grazed for L.2, 10s., 
and a full-grown sheep for 10s. 

Wages. — The wages of a labouring man in summer is Is. 6d., 
and in winter Is. per day with victuals. Those of tradesmen 2s. 
per day in summer, and Is. 6d. in winter, with victuals also. 

Live-Stock. — The common breed of cattle in the parish, till 
within the last few years, was the Aberdeenshire, and the animals 
of this breed were by no means generally of the finest quality. Much 
more attention, however, has been paid of late to improve the qua- 
lity, and produce the greatest weights in the shortest time ; and ac- 
cordingly, a cross of the short-horned with the breed of the county 
is found to succeed well, — for the bullocks of this cross attain a 
greater weight in three years with good keep than the pure Aber- 
deenshire in four ; and, from the facility with which they can be 
conveyed by steam, without loss of weight, to the London "markets, 
they yield a much greater remunerating price to the feeder. 

Few sheep are reared in the parish, and these only for family 
use. 

Husbandry. — The mode of husbandry pursued is believed to be 
good. A seven-shift rotation is that generally adopted, viz. three 
grasses, two grain crops, one green crop, and one grain crop again, 
and with the seed of this last crop are sown rye and red and white 
clover grass seeds for the hay crop of next year. A few indivi- 
duals have, instead of a seven, adopted a six-shift rotation, that is 
one instead of two grain crops after the third year's grass, and they 
affirm that the proceeds are as great, while the land is less ex- 
hausted than by following a seven-shift rotation. As the six-shift 
rotation, however, gives a less breadth for grain crop than the 
other, some time may yet elapse until its advantages be satisfac- 
torily established and duly appreciated. There are other two 
shifts occasionally permitted and practised, namely, a five- shift ro- 
tation, with one grain crop after two grasses ; and a six-shift rota- 



g26 AUERDEENSHIRE. 

tion with two grain crops after two grasses. But both these rota- 

ons, it is helfeved, are injurious to the interest of the la.lor . 
and over a nineteen years no less injunous to the tenant Whe.e 
he land has been previously well managed, and of good quahty, 
J V "ay p'ove advantageoL to the tenant during the first years 
of hisTeL'e ; but, towards the end of it, he may discover h.s error, 
and that his loss exceeds his gain. 

Wheat is seldom attempted to be raised in the pansh, as „e- 
tW the so l no. the climate appears to he adapted to growth. 
Barley and bear are raised hut in small quantmes The gra n 
S sown is oats, and considerable attention has been pa.d to 
h e he -d frequently changed and of good quahty an he ad- 
tl.P phanffe is now universally admitted. 1 he species

Ise drnominrted Scotch barley and early Angus ; although no 
hackwardness is shown to introduce other kmds winch prom.se to 
temrep oductive. Accordingly, potato oats Hopetoun oats and 
sand, oa have been sown in the parish. The potato and Hop - 
toun oats do not bear much hardship, and begm to be d,scontmued. 
The sandv oat is rather in greater favour. 

The land in the parish seems well adapted for producn,g green

the full benefit of such judicious expenditure as he may make for 
the improvement of his farm in the early part of his lease. The 
stipulated rents have, till lately, been principally in money. A 
change, however, has taken place on the property of the principal 
heritor. He now receives a half-money and half-corn rent for 
every possession above the size of a croft, — the corn rent payable 
by the fiars of the year ranging, however, between a certain maxi- 
mum and minimum per quarter. This mode of payment, when 
the minimum and maximum are judiciously and fairly fixed, must 
be alike advantageous to landlord and tenant. 

The farm-houses are in general substantial, convenient, and 
comfortable, and the steadings sufficiently large and commodious. 

There may be from 800 to 1000 acres enclosed with stone 
fences, several of which have been erected within the last few 
years. The advantages of enclosures seem now to be fully appre- 
ciated, and stones are being laid down for the erection of a good 
many more. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce raised in 
the parish may be nearly as follows : — 

Produce of grain of all kinds, . . . L.7155 0 0 

straw of do. , . . . 2385 0 0

Manufactures. — A manufactory for carding and spinning wool 
was, some time ago, established in the parish by a spirited indivi- 
dual, the machinery of which cost him L.270. There are com- 
monly four hands employed, who work ten hours a-day. . In the 
year 1831, the Board for the Encouragement of Manufactures, in 
consequence of a representation of the manufacturer's enterprise, 
granted him a premium of L.36, 10s. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication. — The parish enjoys neither market- 
town nor post-office. There are, however, very good commutation 
roads through a considerable part of it. That which passes the 
church from north to south divides itself into two branches about half 
a mile south of it,— the one leading to Old Meldrum, and the other 
to Inverury, both markets and post towns ; the former distant about 
four and the latter about five miles from the parish church. In 
1835, a turnpike road was made to connect the east and west 



g28 AREUDEENSIIIUE. 

branches of the Great North Road from Aberdeen to Inverness. 
It commences at Old Meldrum, and terminates near to Sheela- 
green, in the parish of Culsamond. Its length m the pansh, tra- 
fersin. the east and north sides, is nearly four m.les. No pubhc 
coaclC as yet, runs through the parish on this road. 

Ecclesiastical State.-This parish is said to have formerly been 
a parsonage or prebend in the diocese of Aberdeen, and to have 
IZ given as an alms' gift by Malcolm Can more to the bishop of 
tha diocese. The Established Church, the only place of vvor- 
ship in the parish, being nearly in the centre of it, is very conve- 
niently situated for the parishioners, not eing. above three rnle 
from the most distant of them. It was built m 1798, and is at 
present in good repair. It affords accommodation for 400 persons, 
a lowing li inches, or for 450, allowing 16 inches for each per- 
son ; an'd by re-arranging the seats, and adding a couple o galle- 
ries it might, if necessary, be made to contain 600. The inha 
bitan hate Sittings in the church gratis, as occupants of houses 
and land rented from the heritors, and there is no person m the 
narish who does not enjoy this privilege. , , •  
' The manse was built in 1799-1800. A thorough repair and 
comfortable addition to it, together with a new --P 
in. of offices, were very liberally and handsomely given by the

ticipates in the Dick Bequest. The heritors of the parish, put- 
ting a just vahie on the services of an acceptable and successful 
teacher, have, greatly to their credit, given him, in a large and 
comfortable school-house, much more than the legal accommoda- 
tion. The annual expense of education varies, according to the 
branches taught, from 8s. to L.l. 

There is no one, it is believed, in the parish, betvi'een six and 
fifteen years of age, who is unable to read or write, none above fif- 
teen who cannot read, and not above fifty, chiefly old women, who 
cannot write. And it may be here stated, as a proof that the pa- 
rishioners are quite alive to the benefits of education, that, during 
last year, there were no fewer than 107 young people attended 
school. 

Charitable and other Institutions. — There is no savings bank in 
the parish. The nearest ig that in Old Meldrum, established, in 
1834, by a few private individuals. A National Security Savings 
Bank was established in Inverury in June 1837. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of persons receiving 
parochial aid is generally about 12, and the annual allowance 
given to each ranges from L.l, 10s. to L.5, lis. 6d. The average 
annual amount of collections in the church for their relief is 
L.25, lis. 4d. ; of interest of money belonging to the poor, L.7, 
10s.; and of donations, &amp;c. given and applied for their benefit, 
L.ll, 6s. 6d. It rarely happens that application, in the first in- 
tance, is made by the individual requiring parochial assistance ; 
and in more cases than one, when inquiry has been made, with all 
possible delicacy, if parochial aid was wanted, or would be accept- 
able, the reply has been, " that their own means were not yet ex- 
hausted, and till then they could not bear the thought of becoming 
burdensome to the parish." 

Fairs, Inns, §-c. and Fuel — In the parish no fairs are held. 
There are two inns, besides two other houses in which ale and 
spirits are retailed ; but these being situated on the sides of the 
principal lines of road in the parish, appear to be required for the 
accommodation of the public. Almost all who occupy land in the 
parish have, in terms of their leases, the privilege of cutting turf 
and peat for fuel in the proprietors' mosses. There is also a con- 
siderable quantity of coals brought from Inverury into the parish 
for fuel, at the expense of about 5s. 6d. per boll, exclusive of 
carriage.

PRESBYTERY OF KINCARDINE o'NIEL, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. JOHN RODGER, MINISTER. 

1. — Topography and Natural History. 

27ame. — In old registers the name is uniformly written Kincar- 
den O'Neal. Kincarden is said to be derived from Gaelic words 
signifying " the head of the hill." The village of Kincardine O'- 
Niel, in which the church and manse stand, is situated in a valley 
at the south-west corner of a hill of considerable height, named 
Ordfundlie. A rivulet, named Neal or Niel, running by the vil- 
lage, gives, it is supposed, the addition of O'Niel to Kincardine. 

Extent, 8fc. — The average length of the parish from south to 
north is seven miles, and the breadth from east to west five. The 
form resembles that of a parallelogram, with some projections and 
indentations in its sides. As the extreme length in some places 
is fully eight miles, and the breadth above five, the area is probably 
about thirty-five square miles. On the west, the parish is bounded 
by those of Aboyne and Lumphanan ; on the north, by the pa- 
rishes of Tough and Cluny; on the east, by Midmar and Ban- 
chory- Ternan ; and by the river Dee on the south, which, in its 
windings, divides it from the parish of Birse and part of Aboyne. 

This parish may be said to be divided into three great straths 
or portions, by hills of considerable extent and height ; one of 
which, the hill of Learney, may not improperly be regarded as a 
continuation of the hill of Fare. It runs in a circuitous direction 
north-west by west, cutting off a considerable portion from the 
other two divisions of the parish. The hill of Fare, which inter- 
venes betwixt Midmar and Banchory- Ternan parishes, forms a 
part of the east boundary of this parish. It furnishes good peats 
to the tenants around its base, — the circumference of which is 
reckoned fourteen miles. It is in height nearly 1600 feet above 
the level of the sea, and is a landmark to ships on the east coast 
near Aberdeen. The other hills in the parish are cultivated or 



g32 AUERDEENSIIIRE. 

wooded to the tops. Ordfundlie divides the south from the mid- 
dle or centre division of the parish. The evel ground jn these 
two divisions is betwixt 400 and 500 feet above the level of the 
sea; the northern division of the parish a degree higher. 

V,.ap.-The average breadth of the nver Dee here .s 
from 60 to 70 yards. When salmon are abundant m the nver 
considerable numbers are killed here with the fly. 'o - l 
low the village, a beautiful and substantial bridge of gamte was 
built in 18li, at an expense of L.3500, one-half defrayed v Go- 
vernment, and the other half by subscription Jhe bndge has 
three arches, the centre arch 65 feet span, and he -o 60 

each. When all the pillars or piers were budt and two of the 
arches thrown, the whole was destroyed by rough timber floating 
down, when the river was high. On that occasion, the contractor, 
Mr Minty, recovered L.1200 of damages off the owners of the 
timber. By the great flood in August 1829 two of the piers we- 
considerably injured; but were afterwards thoroughly repaired and 
bolted with bars of iron by the original contractor. Th bridge is m 
the line of the old military road leading from Perth by Brechin, over 
the Cairn o' Mount, through this village to Huntly and Inverness 
From the bridge to Huntly an excellent road has been made; but 
as no carriage road has yet been completed from southward, 
n.uch of the utility of this handsome edifice is lost to th p.|bh . 
But it is hoped a road to Cuttishillock, on this side of the Mount, 
part of which was made last year, will soon be completed. 

The only other stream of note that runs through the parish is 
the burn of Belty, which, rising in the hills in the north-west cor- 
ner of the parish, takes a diagonal course south-east, through 
the centre division, dividing it into nearly equal parts, and joins the 
Dee in the parish of Banchory. This stream, comparatively m- 
significant in its ordinary state, occasionally, when flooded becomes 
a totnt, and the ground on its banks being level, it does much 
fn urTto the occupiers. In 1799 and 1829, by covermg the crop 
hen on the ground with mud and .sand, it occasioned immense 
OSS In the latter year, this stream carried off two bridges com- 
pletely, and much injured three more, all bu.lt of stone and hme. 

parish. Along the banks of the Dee the soil is light, sharp, 
early.

- Geology and Mineralogy. — The rocks, of which there are few 
remarkable in the parish, are generally composed of whin and 
sandstone. There is also abundance of excellent granite, in ex- 
tensive masses, both above and under ground, some of which has 
been cut for pillars and other purposes, seventeen feet long. There 
is no slate or limestone in the parish ; nor, so far as I know, have 
any fossil organic remains, or any ores, mines, or simple minerals 
been found. 

There are some very extensive plantations, above 1500 impe- 
rial acres, the property of one proprietor. The Scotch fir and 
larch are the most common kinds raised. Latterly, considerable 
quantities of oak and ash have been planted, and seem to thrive, 
particularly the former. To Scotch fir, larch, and oak the soil 
would seem to be favourable. Larch, on the estate of Learney, 
has been found to thrive on the top of a hill exposed to the north- 
ern blasts, when Scotch fir, after a dozen of years, has become 
stunted and dwarfish. Still, it is doubtful if they will thrive to be- 
come timber. Birch would seem to be indigenous along the banks 
of the Dee. 

IL — Civil History. 
Land-owners.~The land-owners are, Peter Laing Gordon, 
Esq. of Craigmile ; Francis Gordon, Esq. of Kincardine ; The 
Heirs of the late Alexander Brebner, Esq. of Learney ; Misses 
Innes of Ballogie; Duncan Forbes Mitchell, Esq. of Thainston • 
William Davidson, Esq. of Kebbity ; Miss Scott of Campfield- 
Francis G. Eraser of Findrack; Archibald Farquharson, Esq. of 
Fmcrean; James Lamond, Esq. of Stranduff; Duncan Davidson, 
Esq. of Mill of Kincardine ; and Mr Ross of Cochrane's Croft, 
who holds between two and three acres of land in feu from the 
Laird of Kincardine, and who is the oldest proprietor in the parish. 

Antiquities.—Tramon says that a bede-house or asylum for 
the support of eight old men existed in this village in the times of 
Popery ; that it was established and supported by a quondam bi- 
shop of Aberdeen ; but that it became extinct at the Reforma- 
tion. No traces of house or funds now remain. 

Parochial Registers.~Om parish registers of baptisms and mar- 
riages do not extend beyond the commencement of the last cen- 
tury ; and. It appears, had for many years been very irregularly 
Kept. Parents are very careless in not registering the births of 
their children. . o &amp;

farm of any tolerable size. Enclosures, built wholly of stone;;, and 
sunk fences faced with that material, are now very general. A 
similar beneficial change has taken place in the improvement of 
the implements of husbandry, and in the breed of horses and black- 
cattle. The threshing-mills have now been generally adopted on 
farms even of moderate extent. They are furnished of a light con- 
struction, on a small scale, and at an expense which the great di- 
minution of labour and increased production of grain from them 
will soon defray. A very favourable and agreeable change in the 
education, manners, and living of the people has also taken place 
within the last forty years. The inconvenience and hardship 
which this parish suffered from the want of roads previous to ]800 
was very great. After that time, they were much improved, — and 
greatly to the benefit of the agriculture of the parish. 

Extent and Produce of the Parish. — The following estimates of 
the extent of the parish in imperial acres, and the annual average 
produce raised in it, it is hoped, is near the truth.

Since the foregoing table was made out, I find, by plans shown 
rae by the proprietor, that the estate of Craigmile contains above 
1200 acres arable, and above 150 have been improved within the 
last three years, or are in the process of improvement. I must here 
advert to a considerable discrepancy betwixt the number of arable 
acres reported by my predecessor and the above. From the best 
information I have been able to procure, joined to mv own obser- 
vation for above thirty years, I find the return to Sir John Sinclair 
should have little, if at all, exceeded 4200 acres ; for certainly above 
560 have been since improved. Mr Morrice's advanced period of 
''te, I know, rendered him wholly dependent on the information

manse are placed in the village, — a situation extremely inconve- 
nient for at least two-thirds of the parishioners. An attempt was 
made above thirty-five years ago to get it removed to the centre of 
the middle division of the parish by the heritors in the two north- 
ern divisions, and it would have been effected but for the Act of 
170y. Where it now stands, it is within 400 yards of the south- 
ern extremity of the parish, while some of the parishioners are 
nearly eight miles distant from their place of worship. Another 
place of worship, at least, is necessary, and would tend much to the 
comfort of the people. Even in the middle division, many of 
the people are above five miles distant from it. The church 
is at present in good repair, and, though an old edifice, a very 
comfortable place of worship, but too small for the population. 
It is seated only for 640, while, in 1842, 870 parishioners 
joined in the communion. The walls appear to have been built 
with small stones and run lime. Their age is unknown; but 
tradition says that they, have stood above 200 years. In 1733, 
the roof was burnt down by a young man shooting pigeons 
on it, it being then covered with heath, which the wadding 
ignited. The roof was then covered with slates. In 1799, the 
roof was re-slated, and the doors and windows renewed, and made 
more comfortable. It has since been regularly seated, lathed, and 
plastered, and divided among the heritors. Of course, no seat- 
rents are paid. In the northern division of the parish, there are 
a good many Dissenters ; nor is this to be wondered, when they 
are six or seven miles distant from the church, and have two Dis- 
senting chapels much nearer them. They are principally of the 
Associate Secession Church. The number of communicants 
evinces that the church, notwithstanding the distance to hundreds, 
is well attended. T|iere are no Societies for religious purposes in 
the parish. 

Part of the present manse was built about the year 1760. It 
was repaired and an addition put to it in 1772. In 1812, it was 
again repaired for the present incumbent. It is comfortable, 
though not modern, the rooms being generally small. The glebe, 
including the tofts, measures about eight imperial acres. The 
stipend was augmented in 1832,— the heritors agreeing to give 
17 chalders, half meal, half barley. 

There is no place of worship of any description in the parish 
besides the Established Church. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— Within the last thirty years, two 



838 ABEIIDEENSHIRE. 



leo-acies of L.100 eacl. l.ave been bequeathed to the poor, which 
mike the amount of their funds at present L.360 at 4 Ver "l- 
The average annual amount of coUecfons, &amp;c. apphcable to the 
noor is from L.35 to L.40. But as there are generally from 45 to 
50 and sometimes 60 paupers on the roll, this provision ,s at all 
times small, and often quite inadequate. And recourse must then 
be had to the heritors,lho have never refused to contribute «hen 
called on. One lady, a proprietrix, has for years 'ent L.5 for heir 
behoof at the commencement of winter, and she and -me "f 'he 
other proprietors give aid in meal or money to the poor on ttar 
e tales during winter. I may here add, that, tiU necessity com- 
pld no application was made for aid from the poor's funds and

I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Sfc. — The name is of Gaelic extraction, and signifies a 
Jlat or level land" The parish of Tarland is separated by a 
burn from Coull, on the south ; on the west, it is bounded by the 
parish of Logie-Coldstone ; on the north, by the parish of Leo- 
chel-Cushny; and on the east, by the parish of Coull to near the 
end of the Cromar district. Its length is nearly 4, and its breadth 
2 miles. 

The church in the annexed parish of Migvie is situated near the 
west end of the Cromar district, and is distant from the parish church 
of Tarland about three miles westward. The parish of Migvie is 
bounded on the south and west, by the parish of Logie-Coldstone; 
on the north, by the parishes of Towie and Coldstone ; and on 
the east, by the parish of Coldstone. 

At what period these parishes of Tarland and Migvie were united 
cannot be ascertained either from record or tradition. Public worship 
IS at Migvie church, every third Sunday through the year. A detach- 
ed part of the parish of Tarland lies in Strathdon, distant twelve 
miles from the parochial church of Tarland, and containing a popu- 
lation of 191 souls. This part of the parish of Tarland is bounded 
on the south by the river Don, three or four miles in extent. It 

about two miles in breadth, and bounded on the west, north,

and east, by the parish of Strathdon. It consists of two or three 
hills and glens, said to have been appropriated as pasture-grounds 
in the forest of Mar, for the accon.modation and benefit of the 
Earl of Mar's vassals, who were proprietors of ground in Cromar, 
and especially in the parish of Tarland, holding of his Lordship 
as superior. 

In more civilized and modern times, these glens, &amp;c. were par- 
tially cultivated, chiefly along the sides of the Don and Ernan, 
and were consequently disposed of and purchased by neighbouring 
proprietors in Strathdon, who still hold of the Earl of Fife as su- 
perior of these lands ; but they always did, and still constitute a 
part of the parish of Tarland. In the immediate neighbourhood of 
this part of Tarland parish, a missionary, upon the Royal Bouivty, is 
stationed, and discharges all parochial duties to the Tarland pa- 
rihioners, with exception of Church discipline, for which they are 
amenable to the kirk-session of Tarland. There is also a detac- 
ed part of the parish of Migvie, six miles north-west from the 
church of Tarland, and three miles north from M.gvie church. 
This part of Migvie parish is bounded on the south by the water 
of Deskrie, which separates it from Coldstone and Towie parishes; 
on the west, by Strathdon; on the north, by the river Don ; and on 
the east, by the parish of Towie. In extent it may be about two 
miles log and nearly three broad, and it contains a population f 
144 souls The minister of Tarland discharges all parochial du- 
Ues here, when called to do so; but his reverend and ftnendly 
brethren in Strathdon and Towie kindly save him much trouble 

" i::rpt onie pansh of Tarland and Migvie which is boun

sphere is mild, varying from 60° to 80Mn ...

' Along the burn, on both sides eastward, the strata and beds 
are various, consisting of rich loam, clay, peat, gravel, with logs 
of oak, alder, fir, &amp;c. imbedded six or eight feet deep. The sur- 
face soil consists of various alluvial deposits from two to three feet 
deep. As the ground rises, say 10 or 12 feet from the level of 
the plain and burn, the soil is various, being, for the most part, 
of light and moory surface, with subsoil of shingle and pure sand. 
From 10 to 20 feet higher, and approaching the north hills, the 
soil is generally much improved, consisting chiefly of rich loam 
mixed with clay, and the subsoil solid clay. Along the side of 
these hills, so far as cultivated, the soil appears mostly pure 
clay. The same soil prevails from the one end of the parish to 
the other, eastward about four miles, and is very productive in 
gram, bear, and oats ; and though about a fortnight later in 
ripening than the ground in the immediate vicinity of Tarland, 
it is less exposed to hoar frost and mildew, and is productive of 
more substantial grain of any kind or quality which suits the cli- 
mate. Dry solid rocks of white, grey, blue, and sand-coloured 
granite abound from one end of the parish to the other, all ac- 
knowledged to be of superior quality ; and along the side of these 
north hills, the soil contains many clay boulders boulers, from 
20 to 50 feet in circumference, the surface consisting of wet 
mossy turf, from 2 to 6 inches deep, then a stratum of moss, but 
more frequently of thin white and blue clay, of the consistence of 
lime prepared for harling or plaster-work. Plantations in the pa- 
rish are very limited, and much wanted. The soil seems conge- 
nial to most sorts of timber, especially common Scotch fir, larch, 
ash, and hard-wood of every description. Some enclosures and 
plantations have been lately made on moory ground upon the Earl 
of Aberdeen's property, which promises to do remarkably well, 
and will tend much to improve' the climate, and prove beneficial 
to the tenantry. 

11. — Civil History. 
Land-oioners. — The chief land-owners in Tarland and Migvie 
parishes, within Cromar, are the Earl of Aberdeen, and Marquis 
of Huntly ; and the proprietors of Invercauld and Finzean. In 
the detached part of Tarland parish in Strathdon, and of Migvie 
on Deskrieside, the proprietors of New and Edinglassie, of Inver- 
ernan, of Candacraig, and of Freefield, are heritors; in all, 
eight. 

Parochial Registers — Parochial registers of baptisms and mar-

riages are regularly kept in those parishes, and have been so since 
the year 1768. Prior to that period, no register or regular record 

of entry exists. i r 

Antiquities.- khoni half a mile south from the church of Tar- 
land, and in the parish of CouU, there is a small hdl or emi- 
nence, about 150 feet in height above the level of the Tarland  
burn ; its summit of conical form, about 100 feet m circumference,  
consisting of solid rock and beautiful granite On this summit 
may be seen the distinct ruins of a distinguished Druidical temple, 
containing tv.o circles formed of large erect stones, at short inter- 
vals, from 4 to 5 feet in height, 3 broad, and 2 feet thick. The 
hill or eminence is known by the name Tomnaverie, a word of 
Gaelic extraction, and said to signify " the hill of truth, or wor- 
ship, or of justiciary trial." About 100 feet from this summit 
westward, are two distinct inclosures, each about an acre of stony 
and uncultivated ground, which might have served for camps, or 
such accommodating purposes as the assembling worshippers re- 
quired On the east side of the eminence, and about 200 paces 
from the temple, there is about an acre of cultivated ground which 
was formerly enclosed, and is known by the name of the " hang- 
man's yard." From the centre of the temple, pointing to the 
north-east, and about one mile distant, there may be seen the 
site and ruins of a lesser Druidical temple, as if intended for more 
frequent and ordinary worship. From the same centre at the 
same distance, and pointing to the north, are to be seen the ruins 
of another Druidical temple : and from the same centre, at the 
same distance, and pointing to the north-west, and upon the boun- 
dary which separates Tarland from Coldstone parish, maybe seen 
the ruins of another Druidical temple,-all three uniform in size, 
and equidistant from the larger temple upon Tomnaverie. On the 
north-west point of the eminence, and close by the large temple, 
are to be seen evident traces of strong fire, which has shattered 
the solid rock several feet deep. It may be worthy of remark haU 
in the immediate neighbourhood of the lesser tenPf J 
the north-east, there was lately found in the "'f /l' 7"; 
stone of very hard texture, about 3 inches long, and 2 thick, taper 
ing at one end, and, though quite smooth f "gV",'; 
like surface: the other end, impressed with two distinct circle., 
beautifully polished, and in high preservation

be seen, on a small eminence, the ruins of a castle, the quondam 
property and residence of the Earl of Mar, and where the feu- 
duties of the proprietor of Blelach, in parish of Logie-Coldstone, 
were appointed by his charters to be paid annually to the supe- 
rior. At what period this castle was reduced to ruins cannot be 
ascertained. Its site is now all under green turf ; but it might be 
an object worthy of the attention of the proprietor, Mr Farquh ar- 
son of Finzean, to excavate the ruins, and expose its original plan 
and dimensions.

craig. 

IV. — Indu&amp;try. 
Agriculture, 8fC. — The average rent of land in these parishes 
may be stated at L. 1, 10s. per acre, with the exception of the 
ground adjoining the village of Tarland, which rents at L. 3 per 
acre. The spirit of agricultural improvement has shone very 
conspicuously throughout the district, for these twenty years 
past. Lime and coals are brought from Aberdeen and other 
places equidistant. The general duration of leases is nine- 
teen years, and the farm-buildings are generally substantial and 
commodious. Tarland is the only market-town in these pa- 
rishes, or in the Cromar district. There are seven annual mar- 
kets : Breagfair, held at Martinmas ; Yule market, in January ; 
horse-market in March ; Rood-fair, at Whitsunday ; a market for 
cows the week following ; Luag fair in July; and Lammas fair in 
August. A weekly market was held for many years in the burgh, 
but has been discontinued for twenty or thirty years past. To 
these markets, cattle, horses, sheep, and such commodities as the 
country and seasons furnish, are brought ; and much commercial 
intercourse with the district is thereby promoted. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Village. — The village of Tarland is a burgh of barony, and con- 
sists of 68 houses and families. Prior to 1799, four tenants held 
the whale village and ground attached say 150 acres in lease 
from the Earl of Aberdeen, the proprietor ; and all other house- 



844 AUlillDEliNSHIUE. 

holders in the village were tenants at will, and subject to many 
changes and services required by their respective landlords, who 
held of the proprietor. This arrangement was found hostile to 
industrious improvement and ordinary comfort, and to promote in- 
difference, idleness, dissipation, and immorality. When new 
leases were required and granted in 1799, these lands were sur- 
veyed and measured, and every householder in the village was 
supplied with his portion of ground, which he held in lease from 
the proprietor for nineteen years. This arrangement had the mos 
de;irable effects. The first object with the villagers was to build 
• comfortable houses, and to put their little patches of ground m 
preparation for a regular rotation of crops. Such laudable exer- 
tion in a few years evinced its happy effects, when each villager 
xniaht be seen possessed of his cow and horse, as circumstances 
required, maintained through summer and winter, and the family 
supplied with meal and malt, butter and cheese, and vegetables 
equal to their consumpt. 

In the village, there is a commodious and well-frequented mu; 
5 alehouses; a daily post and stamp-office; 8 shops containing 
grocery, and all other articles generally required for domestic and 
Lricultural purposes. There is an excellent mill with approved 
machinery, in complete repair, and well managed. A neat and sub- 
stantial bridge of one arch, 22 feet span, was built over the burn 
of Tarland, and close by the village, seven years ago, and com- 
pletes the communication between Dee and Don-side. From this 
bridse to the end of the Gromar district eastward, a distance ot 
thre miles, a new and straight course for the bum was planned 
and executed twelve years ago, and has proved of m.mense ad- 
vintage to the neighbourhood, by improving the climate, draining 
he lo'w grounds along the plam to the end of the district and 
;ddin. not less than 140 acres of superior rich alluvial soil, which 
JoVtime immemorial, had been a tract of green pasture, consisting 
of moss, mire, and lake, and generally known by the name of Bog- 
ir From the village of Tarland to the city of Aberdeen, a 
stance of thirty miles, there was lately made a turnpike road. 

through'the parishes of Coull, Lumphanan, Kincardine

number of communicants in both parishes within Cromar does 
not exceed 400, The sacrament is dispensed at Tarland church 
only. The communicants from the Strathdon and Deskrie-side 
are generally accommodated at the churches of Strathdon and 
Towie, where they find it more convenient to attend. 

The present manse of Tarland was built in 1800, and is in 
good repair. The glebe at Tarland is about 4| imperial acres, and 3|- 
acres at Migvie. The amount of stipend is L.54, 3s. 5d. Sterling 
of money, 74 bolls, 3 firlots, 2 pecks, 2f lippies of bear, and 101 bolls, 
1 peck, 1 lippies of meal, valued and paid according to the fiars 
of the year. There are no places of public worship in these pa- 
rishes besides the churches of Tarland and Migvie, the lattjer of 
which was rebuilt about sixty-five years ago, and is at present 
in good repair. It accommodates between 200 and 300 sitters. 
Divine worship at the Established Churches is generally well at- 
tended ; and, with the exception of a few Roman Catholics, there 
are no Dissenters nor Seceders in these parishes. The average 
amount of church collections, including penalties, yearly, may be 
stated at L.30. 

Near the centre of the district of Cromar the church and manse 
of Tarland are situated, on a plain, and by the side of a burn or 
rivulet formed by the springs and auxiliary streams from the ad- 
joining hills on the north side. 

Education. — The parochial school at Tarland is the only semi- 
nary of learning in these parishes. The branches of instruction 
generally taught are, Greek, Latin, English, arithmetic, writing, 
book-keeping, and the principles of geometry and mathematics. 
The schoolmaster enjoys the legal accommodation, the minimum 
salary, and school-fees ; which, with other perquisites, may amount 
to L.40 annually. The school is well attended : but an additional 
school is very muph wanted at Migvie. The teacher participates 
in the Dick bequest. 

The parochial school of Tarland has been supplied with quali- 
fied and successful teachers for a century past, and a considerable 
number of young men from the district have been distinguished 
for genius and talent in civil, ecclesiastical, and commercial de- 
partments. 

Poor. — The poor's funds in these parishes are very limited, not 
exceeding L.80 Sterling. There are, at an average, 16 paupers 
on the roll, but no travelling poor belong to these parishes. Two

PRESBYTERY OE ALFORD, SYNOD OE ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. ROBERT COOK, A. M. MINISTER. 



I —Topography and Natural History. 
2vram..-THE name Clatt, or, as it was formerly written, Clet 
or aett, is obviously derived from the Gaelic word Cleith, pro- 
nounced Cleit, which signifies concealed. This etymology of he 
TordTs in strict accordance with the locahty of the parish. It is 
ponrpaled from the view on every side. 

S° r«o» -This parish is situated in the western extren„ly o 
Garioct-one of the five divisions or districts of the county of 

iir-It is about 4 English miles in length, and varies from 
2 . 3 Englisl .niles in breadth, comprehending a space of nearly

CLATT. 



847 



- Climate. — As the parish lies at an elevation of upwards of 600 
feet, and in the northern vicinity of a mountain of at least 1300 
feet above the level of the sea, the climate is colder than in the 
lower parishes of the county. In consequence, however, of an 
extensive and efficient draining of moss and marshy ground, the 
climate has, within the last twenty years, undergone a decidedly 
favourable change. There are no diseases peculiar to the parish. 
Many of the inhabitants wear a green old age, and, during the in- 
cumbency of the writer, several have died upwards of ninety years 
of age, and two, with unimpaired faculties, completed a century. . 

Springs. — The parish is copiously supplied with the purest wa- 
ter from perennial springs, which issue from the sides of the hills 
and every smaller eminence. Though no river of any note flows 
through the parish, the union of several streamlets forms the Gady, 
famed in song, which, in its meandering course, turns twelve 
threshing-mills and a meal-mill in this parish, within the short 
distance of two miles, and, after passing through a highly culti- 
vated district, joins the Urie on its way to discharge itself into 
the Don at Inverury. 

Mineral Springs. — In several places, there are sulphureous and 
chalybeate springs, to which some virtue is attached as diuretics ; 
but they have never been generally frequented for medicinal pur- 
poses. The strongest chalybeate spring rises near the summit of 
Coreen, out of an irregular mass of broken rock, richly imbedded 
with ironstone. The water has been analyzed, and found to con- 
tain nearly the same ingredients as the celebrated mineral waters 
of Peterhead. 

- Minerals. — This parish, though limited in extent, is not devoid 
of interest to the mineralogical inquirer. In many parts, rocks of 
granite and whinstone, with irregular inclinations, are found almost 
immediately below the surface of the ground. From the abun- 
dant supply of outlying stones, there exists little necessity of 
opening quarries for erecting buildings and enclosures ; and only 
one quarry of composite rock, of hornblende, quartz, and felspar, 
is occasionally worked. Near the mansion-house of Knockespoch, 
veins of a species of variegated marble have been discovered. It 
is, however, of too splintry a nature to admit of its application to 

 " I wish I were whare Gadie rins,

any useful purpose, and of too soft contexture to receive the re- 

quisite polish. , , j- • • r 

Vitrification.-On an eminence in the northerly division of the 
parish, stones in a vitrified state are thickly scattered over an ex- 
tent of about six acres. They are of various dimensions, though, 
in general, not exceeding a few inches diameter ; but no mass of 
vitrified matter has been discovered near the spot. Their exist- 
ence in such a situation furnishes an interesting subject of anti- 
nuarian research but it is apprehended that the best directed 
inquiries will lead to no satisfactory result. The stones bear evi. 
dent marks of having been in a state of high ignition and, when 
broken, disclose small globules filled with a white pulverized de 
posit, of a slightly sulphureous smell. There is no appearance o 
a crater that might connect the vitrified matter with volcanic re 
mains, nor are the least vestiges discovered of a vitrified tort. A 
a distance of about four miles is situated the mountain of Noath, 
with a valley intervening. On the summit of this mountain, at an 
elevation of nearly 1800 feet above the level of the sea are the 
remains of a volcano or vitrified fort, and it is only on the side o 
the eminence in the parish of Clatt, opposite to Noath, that the 
vitrified stones are found. The writer mentions this singular cc 
incidence without venturing to deduce from it any inference affect- 
ing the merits of the inquiry. He would merely remark, that th 
vifrified matter at both places appears to be nearly of the same 
consistency, and that, at a similar distance from Noath m an east- 
erly direction, stones of the same description are found over a li-

trenching, the soil is partly alluvial, with a mixture of sand, clay, 
or peat-moss on a gravelly bottom ; and, in the more elevated parts 
of the parish, the soil is of a light and sandy character on a rocky 
bed. The remainder of the surface consists of moorish ground 
covered with heath, or of peat-moss of considerable depth. 

Plantations. — While the soil in the cultivated parts of the pa- 
rish is capable of producing luxuriant crops of grain, the want of 
sufficient shelter from the stormy winds presents a powerful ob- 
stacle to the progress of agricultural improvement. From the ex- 
tent of peat-moss, and the discovery of large fragments of oak, 
alder, and fir trees at a considerable depth below the surface of 
the ground, there is just reason for inferring, that this parish, at a 
remote period, exhibited an entire contrast to its present appear- 
ance. Plantations of larch and Scotch fir have been recently 
formed on the hills in the southern boundary. Towards the sum- 
mit, the trees are much stunted by the injury which they sustain 
from the withering winds and superincumbent snows ; but, in more 
sheltered situations, they are progressively thriving, and have at- 
tained to considerable size. The aspect of the parish, otherwise 
monotonous, is pleasantly diversified by a few aged trees of ash, 
elm, and plane, around almost every farm-steading ; and the village 
of Clatt is studded by upwards of 100 ash and plane trees of large 
dimensions, that have weathered the storms of 100 winters; and, 
to the eye of the unexpecting traveller, impart to it in summer, 
the rich umbrageous appearance of an English village. 

II. — Civil History. 
The history of this parish at a remote period is involved in much 
obscurity. It appears, however, by the privileges conferred upon 
the town and village of Clatt by one of our Scottish Kings, that 
it was not deemed unworthy of the exercise of the royal preroo-a- 
tive. By letters of gift and donation from King James IV. of 
Scotland, " the village of Clatt was erected into a free burgh of 
barony, with all the rights and privileges thereof; with power to 
the proprietor at that time, and in all time thereafter, to constitute 
and appoint bailies and other officers necessary for guiding, go-

improvement of the burgh. Of the nature and extent of some of 
the baron's powers in the maintenance of his jurisdiction, there 
still exist distinct vestiges. On the summit of a nsmg ground 
contiguous to the village, there is pointed out the site on which

land where his extensive estates are situated ; and Sir Andrew 
Leith Hay of Rannes, whose mansion-house is in the neighbourmg 
parish of Kennethmont. There is no plan of the whole parish 
extant, but correct surveys, by professional men, have been made 
al different times, for the private use of the landed proprietors. 

Parochial Registers—The parochial registers are by no means 
in a perfect state. The register of baptisms only commences ui 
1725, and, with slight intermissions, is brought down to the pre- 
sent time. Previously to 1820, when the present incumbent was 
appointed, there is no register of marriages, with the exception of 
the short interval between 1784 and 1798, and no record what- 
soever of deaths is in existence. 

Feudal Rencontre.-The only historical incident in this parish, 
deserving of notice, was a rencontre in 1572, between the two 
rival clans of Forbes and Gordon. To revenge an insult offe ed 
by the Master of Forbes, in repudiating his wife, daughter of be 
Earl of Huntly, the Gordons, under the command of two ot the 
Earl's brothers, attacked their hereditary enemies the Forbesses, 
t'hin their rude entrenchment, on the White Hi 1 of Tillyangus 
in the south-west extremity of this parish, and, after a sanguina y 
contest, still visibly marked by a number of graves or cairns, the 
G do s carried the encampment of their opponents, slew Arthur 
Forbes son of Lord Forbes, commonly called Black Arthur, fron 
his dark complexion, and continued the pursuit to the gates of 
Castle Forb now bruminnor, the family seat of the numerous 
ct Xb s This skirmish is the subject of traditionary notice 
bv h aged chroniclers of the parish, and is recorded m a mana- 
script memoir of the house of Forbes, now in the possession of 
the Honourable Lord Forbes.

Druidical Monuments bnd Tumidi. — At a period of very remote 
antiquity, this parish appears to have been one of the favoured 
seats of the Druids. Until within the last thirty years, there ex- 
isted in the northern division of the parish, the distinct remains 
of a Druidical temple, of which only the supposed altar-stone, 
and a few of the upright stones, which were placed in the circum- 
ference, now remain. The stone supposed to have formed the 
sacrificial altar in the centre, was of large dimensions, consisting 
of 10 feet in length, 9 feet in breadth, and 4 feet in thickness. 
It was placed at an angle of about 45° with the dip in the direc- 
tion of the meridian. At each extremity, longitudinally, there 
stood a perpendicular stone of about 6 feet in height, vulgarly 
styled " the Horns of the Altar," and in the line of the circle, of 
about 25 yards diameter, there were placed, at equal distances, 
seven upright stones, from 5 to 6 feet in height. The whole 
space within the circumference was rudely paved with stones to 
the depth of about three feet. Within the precincts of this hea- 
then temple, no relic of the olden time has been discovered; but 
at a distance of about a quarter of a mile, in different directions, 
several tumuli have been opened, some of which contained 
ornamented earthen jars fidl of bones in a calcined state. 
A few years ago, upwards of twenty of these tumuli, that had 
escaped observation from a thick covering of heath and furze, 
were discovered in the progress of improving some moorish ground-. 
To each of the tumuli was allotted a detached circular space of 
about six yards diameter. In the line of the circle, there was 
placed a continued series of upright stones, which distinctly marked 
the circular spot, and in the centre of each, a grave had been dug 
of the usual dimensions. Some of them had been cut out of the 
soHd rock to the depth of about five feet. On opening some of 
them, small pieces of burnt bones were found, and, in others, the 
sides at the bottom were lined in the form of a coffin with de- 
tached blocks of sandstone. On the period to which these se. 
pulchral monuments refer, tradition is entirely silent. From their 
contiguity to the remains of the supposed Druidical temple, there 
IS ground for conjecture that these formed the cemeteries of the 
priests of the Druids, and in a line leading from the site of the 
temple to some of these tumuli that were opened a few years ago, 
there could be distinctly traced a rude causeway of stone. At a 
short distance from these tumuli, there was recently dug up, at 
the depth of about six feet, a smooth stone, 4 feet long by 2 feet

IV. — Industry. 

The active and enterprising spirit of the farmers has shed a be- 
nignant influence over the external aspect of the parish, and no- 
thing but the contour of the surrounding hills, and other perma- 
nent landmarks, could identify it with the subject of the Statistical 
Account in 1792. During a period of forty years, agriculture has 
passed progressively through the various intervening stages be- 
tween infancy and matured improvement, and comparatively little 
is now left to be achieved by future enterprise. Within the short 
period of the last twenty years, upwards of 300 acres have been 
reclaimed from their natural state of moss and moor, and render- 
ed comparatively productive, and neither the aspect of the times, 
nor the calculations of a profitable return, could justify the appli- 
cation of any additional capital in the recovery of the small resi- 
due of about 80 improvable acres within the whole extent of the 
parish.

of profitable husbandry, the attention of the farmer been d e- 
servedly turned to the improvement of the breed of 'f- f''

enlightened legislature, or were its restrictions modified, liberal- 
minded landlords, without incurring the risk of personal responsi- 
bility, yet with permanent advantage to the property, could ren- 
der meliorations for improvements, a burden upon succeeding 
heirs. It is, however, very gratifying to remark, that, though both 
estates in this parish are held under strict entail, the progress of 
agriculture has not, as yet, been retarded by its paralyzing influ- 
ence. Every reasonable encouragement and accommodation are 
given by the respective proprietors, and the farm-buildings are 
neat and commodious, constructed of durable materials, agreeably 
to plans sanctioned by the proprietors. The expense of erecting 
. farm-steadings and enclosures, is, in general, defrayed exclusively 
by the tenant, and he is entitled to remuneration only at the ex- 
piration of his lease. The duration of leases is for the usual pe- 
riod of nineteen years. Though this period may be happily chosen 
to meet a change of circumstances, it is by no means sufficient to 
afford any adequate remuneration for capital invested in extensive 
improvements. 

Draining. — In estimating the relative importance of the im- 
provements which have taken place in this parish during the lasl 
twenty years, it will readily be admitted that draining has been 
one of the most efficient. On each of several farms, of 100 to 
150 acres of total surface, from 4000 to 8000 ells of drains and 
ditches have been cut, at the average depth of six feet. Large 
tracts of moss and marshy ground, fit only for the wild fowls to 
nestle on, have thus been reclaimed at the personal expense of the 
tenant ; and in many parts of the parish, where neither the foot of 
man nor of beast could tread, there, 

' In gay luxuriance Ceres now is seen, 
To crown the valleys with eternal green." 

From these improvements, the value of property will be greatly 
enhanced to the present and future proprietor ; but from the de- 
pressed state of agriculture, there is much reason to fear, that the 
chief, if not the only, compensation which the tenant will reap for 
the funds which he has irrecoverably sunk, will be the patriotic re- 
flection, that he has " made corn grow where corn ne'er grew be- 
fore." 

Obstacles — In effecting beneficial changes in the agriculture of 
the parish, the farmer has had to contend with many disadvan- 
tages. The distance to Aberdeen, the principal grain market, 
cannot be accomplished in less than three days, and the actual ex-

pense of the delivery of grain, independently "t tear and wear, 
and loss of time, is at present one-tenth to ote.t»elf h fj'- -'' 
value. The state of the roads is another barr.er to the progress 
of agricultural improvement. While r'''.'' 'j 
nefit of turnpike roads, no provision has been made to fac.l late 

I e ntercourse »i.h this parish, besides the -"'J. V;'-- °

deen is generally preferred by travellers. 

Ecclesiastical State.— T\iQ parish church is centrically situated, 
at a distance of not more than three miles from the most remote 
parts of the parish. The fabric of the church is co -existent with 
Roman Catholic worship, and several Popish relics have been dis- 
covered in the progress of repairing the church. In 1828, the 
church was substantially repaired and reseated. It affords accom- 
modation for 290 persons, or more than one-half of the whole po- 
pulation, besides 52 additional sittings in a gallery erected by the 
kirk-session for the benefit of the poor. The manse was built in 
1725, and in 1 820 it underwent considerable repair, and received 
additional accommodation. In 1828, the offices wererebuilt on 
an enlarged plan, and in the same year, the church-yard was en- 
closed with a substantial stone and lime wall. The glebe and 
garden consist of nearly 5 Scotch acres, without the statutory ac- 
companiment of a grass glebe. The teinds were valued and 
exhausted in 1812, and the stipend is the legal minimum, besides 
the usual allowance for communion elements. There are 20 Dis- 
senters in the parish, and the average number of communicants at 
the Established Church is about 230. Church collections are an- 
nually made for the Aberdeen Infirmary, and occasionally for the 
Presbyterial Lunatic Fund ; and, during the last seven years, there 
has existed a parochial association for Christian purposes, embra- 
cing especially the General Assembly's Shemes,— the funds of the 
association amounting from L.IO to L.13 per annum. 

Education. — A very handsome and commodious school-room, 
fully adequate to the educational wants of the parish, has been erected 
this season. No other school exists, or is required. The branches of 
education usually taught are, English reading, writing, arithmetic, 
and Latin, and book-keeping, and the higher branches of mathe- 
matics when required. The salary of the schoolmaster is L.25i 
13s. 4d., with the legal accommodation ; and the amount of the 
school-fees, including the interest of L.40, minus legacy duty 
mortified by the Rev. Robert Findlay, for the education of child- 
fen of poor householders, may be stated at from L.12 to L.18 per 
annum. The teacher also shares in the Dick Bequest. The rate 
of school-fees per quarter, after deduction for harvest vacation, is 
as follows : English reading, 2s. ; reading and writing, 3s. ; arith- 
metic, 4s. ; mensuration, 5s. ; Latin,,5s. ; and book-keeping, IDs. 
6d. per set. From the facilities of education there are few or none 



8o&amp; ABEllDEENSIilRE. 

from six to fifteen years of age who cannot read, but a considerable 
number who cannot write. There may be from twelve to twenty 
persons upwards of fifteen years of age who cannot write ; and none 
who cannot read. To the inestimable benefits of education the inha- 
bitants are in general zealously alive. The parent who has felt the 
disadvantages of ignorance is anxious to remove this obstruction from 
his children's future path ; and he willingly subjects himself to 
much labour, and many privations, in furnishing them with the 
means of refining their taste, forming their intellectual character, 
and forwarding their advancement in society. If he enjoys the be- 
nefits of a well-informed mind, he is fired with the nobler ambition 
of cultivating their mental faculties, and thus putting them in pes- 
session of the principle of their future advancement, than in amas- 
sina- for them treasures of which they might not know the legiti- 
mate use. The diffusion of the means of education has been pro- 
ductive of its natural effects, increased intelligence, and exemplary 
moral deportment. To great simplicity of manners, which has for 
ao-es existed in the parish, there have been superadded habits of 
reading; a willingness to relinquish established prejudices, and to 
adopt acknowledged improvements; a higher toue of intellectual 
character; and an increasing regard to the concerns of religion. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The provision for the poor is 
comparatively ample; and the Rev. Robert Findlay, writer of 
the last Statistical Account of this parish, is held in perma- 
nent remembrance by his liberal mortification to the industri- 
ous poor. He bequeathed the sum of L.300, less legacy duty, 
for the benefit of aged persons in reduced circumstances, and 
the annual interest, in suitable proportions, is distnbuted by 
the kirk-session among the intended objects of Mr Findlays 
bounty. Of these, three only receive regular parochial aid; 
but the supply to the others is not more acceptable than season- 
able In directing the application of this annual provision the 
founder eviuced much discrimination. There are many necessi- 
tous persons who thankfully receive supply from this source who 
would rather submit to severe privations than have their name 
Tolled in the list of the regular poor. The funds for the ord.na , 
poor are as follows : Church collections, P-Jf ' .i ' J 
interest of accumulated funds, L.8; seat rents, L.2, lOs. ota 
L.27, lOs., which, after deduction of L.3 P- annum as s la, 
precentor and kirk-officer, leaves a balance of about Ste 1 g 
0 be distributed among eight regular poor. The benefit of pa

rochial aid is a matter not of choice, but of the most urgent ne- 
cessity. The spirit of Scottish independence still exists in all its 
vicrour, and many in a state of indigence have been known to de- 
cHne the proffered support, until they were assured that it pro- 
ceeded from the mortified fund. 

jueL— The scarcity of fuel bears hard upon the comforts of the 
poor. From extensive draining in the low mossy ground, a once fer- 
tile source of fuel is now nearly dried up, and the scanty supply of 
sandy and scarcely inflammable turf from the hilly ground, acces- 
sible only by very bad roads, scarcely repays the expense and labour 
of its preparation and delivery. The use of coal as a substitute 
for turf has now become very general, though this luxury can 
only be obtained by a large pecuniary sacrifice, as the expense of 
carriage is not less than the price of the coal at Aberdeen.

PHF.SBYTERY OF DEER, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN, 

THE REV. JOHN IMRAY, A. M. MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

2ame. — This parish was disjoined from Peterhead, about two 
hundred and twenty years ago. For a considerable period, the 
Presbytery appointed several of its members, with some elders of 
Peterhead, to " travell with my Lord Merschell," who was at that 
time chief proprietor in the district, to have " ane new kyrk bouldit 
in the head," or west part, " of the paroche." This was at last ef- 
fected in A. D. 1619 or 1620, and the church was for some time 
termed " the ower i. e. upper kirk of Peterugie," or " Peter- 
heid." The parish, however, was sobn after called " Longsyd," 
from the name of the farm on which the church was situated. 

Extent, 4-c.— It is of an irregular, four-sided figure, containing 
about 30 square miles; and is bounded on the east by St Fergus 

 From the Presbytery records it appears, that church extension was zealously 
prosecuted here about that period; for within a few years, four parishes Longside, 
New Deer, Strichon, and Pitsligo, were erected, with a church in each, — all of them 
exceedingly needful, from the extent and population of the district.

and Peterhead; on the south, by Cruden; on the west and north- 
west, by Old Deer ; and on the north, by Lonmay, or rather that 
part of it which forms the new parish of Kininnionth. Like Bu- 
chan in general, it is very level, or rising into gentle undulations, 
which afford facilities for draining the land. The Ugie, which 
divides the parish from west to east, frequently overflows the ad- 
joining ground to a considerable extent, but might easily be con- 
fined by embankments. This the proprietors concerned have, for 
some time, been proposing to do. Were the work well executed, 
there is no doubt that the result would be an ample remuneration 
for the outlay, as well as the removal of a nuisance unfavourable 
to the health of the neighbourhood. 

Hydrography.— T\\e springs are abundant, and generally free 
from mineral admixture. About 400 yards south of the village of 
Lono'side, two springs flow within Httle more than afoot from each 
other, the one of very soft water, and the other a strong chalybeate. 
The two branches of the Ugie, after a separate course of ten or 
twelve miles from the west, unite in this parish ; and the river, 
flowing eastward, falls into the- sea near Peterhead, about four 
miles below the confluence. 

Geo3/.— There are several quarries of excellent granite, the 
principal one of which is wrought at the hill of Cairngall, one mile 
from the village of Longside. The stone found here is of a light 
grayish hue, and has been, and still is, in considerable demand for 
public works in England and elsewhere, being valued for its colour 
and durability. When highly polished it looks remarkably well in 
the form of mantel-pieces, tables, and other articles of which th6 
surfaces are plain. The other quarries, which are chiefly on the 
Rora property, yield stone of a darker appearance, and are not 
much wrought, except for local purposes. Pieces of quartz and 
felspar are plentiful throughout the district, and prove useful, with 
granite chips, in the erection of cottages and dikes. On the south- 
ern boundary of the parish, there are found great quantities of no- 
dules of a yellowish brown flint, many of which, when broken, dis- 
close a cavity, and appear as if they had been formed around an 
insect or small shell, of which they retain the impression. It is 
conjectured by some geologists that these nodules had been, at a

vian coasts, where they are said to abound. 

At least five tracts of peat moss yet remain to supply the fuel, 
which is chiefly used; but on these cultivation has of late been 
fast encroaching,— an advance, which, with draining and other im- 
provements, must have a favourable efl"ect on the climate. Im- 
bedded in the peat are found many trunks of hardwood trees, es- 
pecially oak, the roots of which, remaining in their natural posi- 
tion, show that here they must at one time have grown in a con- 
genial soil. So well have some of them been preserved in the 
bog, that they have been cut up and formed into articles of furni- 
ture, which appear as if made of ebony. 

The soil is in general light, and of no great depth. It is in 
most places bottomed by a ferruginous stratum, called pan, which 
is broken up with considerable difficulty, and by its admixture les- 
sens for a time the fertility of the land. 

Occasionally a few deer are seen in the Ardlaw wood. 
Foxes, badgers, and several other quadrupeds seem to have disap- 
peared. Hares and vvild rabbits are numerous and destructive. 
Flights of wild geese appear in the spring months, but retire to 
the north-east every evening about sunset. In the low grounds 
through which the Ugie flows, wild ducks abound; and the heron 
comes from a distance of fifteen or twenty miles to prey upon the 
finny natives of the stream. Lapwings, bitterns, cornrails, star- 
lings, and one or two other birds of passage, visit us in their sea- 
sons. Swallows, we regret to perceive, have of late decreased, 
while jackdaws have increased, in number. Grouse and partridges 
have been almost exterminated. 

Botany — The plants indigenous to the parish cannot be said to 
be either numerous or uncommon. Among the rarer species are, 

Anemone nemorosa Empetrum nigrum Parnassia palustris 

Anthyllis vulneraria Littorella lacustris Ranunculus aquatllis 

Bartsia Odontites Luzula pilosa ; — hederaceus 

Botrychium Lunaria Menyanthes trifoliata Scutellaria galericulata 
Corydalis claviculala Montia fontana Sparganium raraosum 
Drosera longifolia Narthecium ossifragum Trientalis Europaea. 
rotundifclia Nymphcea alba 

The plantations are chiefly of Scotch fir, spruce, and larch ; but 
hardwood might be raised, especially beech, sycamore, alder, and 
ash. The land, however, being mostly arable, little room is left 
for the growth of timber.

Eminent Characters, — The Rev. John Skinner, though a native

of a distant parish, was for sixty-four years minister of tbe Epis. 
copal congregation here, n ecclesiastical history and some let- f 
ters or dissertations by him, on theological subjects, have been , 
published; but he is perhaps better known as a correspondent of 
the poet Burns, and as the writer of severa popular songs, v.z. 
Tullochgorum, John o' Badenyon, Ewie wi' the crooked horn, &amp;c. 
A handsome monument to his memory has been erected m this \ 
churchyard, in which he lies interred. His residence at Linshart 
has been, and still is, occupied by his successor. 

Land.owners,-On\y two heritors are resident, viz John Hut- 
chison, Esq. of Cairngall, and James Bruce, Esq. of Innerquhom- 
ry and Longside,-both of whom are also extensive ship-owners. 
The other Jroprietors are George Ferguson, Esq. of Pitfour, who 
has all that part of the parish lying north of the main branch of 
the Ugie; James Russel, Esq. of Aden, who has Ludquharn ; 
Thomas Arbuthnot, Esq. Provost of Peterhead Nether Km- 
xnundy ; James Buchan, Esq. of Auchmacoy, Yokiesh.ll ; the 
Heirs of the late Mrs Hay Mudie, Faichfield ; and Charles Wil- 
kinson Gordon, Esq. a minor, as successorf to the late Genera 
Gordon of Buthlaw, who distinguished himself in the Greek war of 
independence, and wrote its history. 

Parochial Begisters.-The records of discipline and of the ad- 
ministration of the poor's fund commence at the erection of the 
Tjarish in a. d. 1620, are very legible, and continued till the pre- 
sent dav, with the exception of four portions, viz the four years 
preceding 1637, thirteen and a half years preceding 166 J, nine 
years preceding 1722, and ten years precedmg 1733. he re-

Antiquitzes.-OccshnWy a tumulus is opened and found to 

contain'an urn of baked clay, with ashes, perhaps fragme 

of bones. Little, however, can be added on this head to what has 

been stated in the last Statistical Account.

ants is given as being 1979 ; but there is reason to think this state- 
ment inaccurate. In the beginning of 1791 the writer of the last 
Statistical Account found the number to be only 1792, of whom 
817 were males, and 975 females, there being nearly 4 persons to 
a family. 

The population in 1801 was 1825 — 846 males, 979 females, 
1811, 2077— 940 do. 1137 do 
1821, 2337— 1079 do. 1278 do. 
1831, 2479— 1111 do. 1368 do. 
1841, 2612— 1165 do. 1445 do. 

, From this it appears that no decrease has been found at any cen- 
sus within the last fifty years ; but that the rate of increase has been 
smaller, during the last twenty years, than during the previous part 
of this century. One cause most probably is, that, during the 
6rst quarter of the century, two villages, Longside and Mintlaw, 
had been founded and encouraged, in which, for about fifteen 
years past, scarcely an additional house has been built. Another 
cause is, that, during the former period, there was a flourishing 
manufactory of woollen cloth, which ceased in 1828, and thus oc- 
casioned the removal of many of the people employed, previously 
to the census of 1831.

Instances of insanity are very rare. There are, at present,' 3 
fatuous persons, 3 blind, and none deaf and dumb. 

Illicit distillation and smuggling of all kinds have been disused 
tor many years. The people are diligent and painstaking. Tbev 
are also, m general, contented with their circumstances, unless wis 
except from this remark the unmarried servants of both sexes 
who, of late years and throughout this district, have been haunted 
by a restless spirit, which causes them to change their employ 
ers almost every six months. In many cases, however, it is hard 



864 ABERDEENSHIRE. 

to sav whether they or their masters are most to blame. The ha- 
\i\t is clearly unfavourable to the character of those who mdulge 
it; and means have been taken by church courts and other bodies 
to counteract its injurious effects. ,  . • j-, 

Thoucrh generally intelligent, the people are by far too mdif- 
ferent about acquiring useful information, except in regard to their 
ordinary pursuits. Their moral conduct is less open to objection. 
They are neighbourly, kind to the poor, and so free from those of- 
fences which are condemned by human laws, that a committal fo 
crime has not been known to take place here for a very long pe 
riod. Their attendance upon the outward ordmances of religio 
is, for the most part, regular. 

IV. — Industry. 
Most of the inhabitants are now employed in agriculture,' or in 
occupations connected with it. For some time after the beginning 
of this century, the manufacture of woollen cloth was earned on 
y\th spirit and success. A large work of this kind was erected at 
Milbank, near the confluence of the two branches of the Ugie, 
whpre broad cloths of the best quality were made, and many hands 
employed both on the spot and throughout the parish. But asud. 
den stoppage of the work in 1828 proved disastrous to all concern- 
ed • and nothing of the same kind has again been attempted. 

A distillery has been carried on, for at least fifteen years; but 
the proprietors, becoming disposed to employ their capital other- 
v,ise, have lately advertised the buildings and apparatus for sale 
The retail-dealers, termed merchants, of whom there are 10

There are six meal-mills, seven smithies, and such a proportion 
of other handicrafts, as to meet the demands of the parish. Of 
professional and educated men, there are three clergymen, one 
physician, one land-surveyor, and three parpchial teachers.

duction of Teeswater bulls, for which very high prices have been 
given, a cross breed, thought to possess some desirable qualities, 
has been produced. Some enterprising farmers have carried this 
branch to a high pitch of excellence, particularly Messrs Robert 
and John Hutchison, whose father, the proprietor of Cairngall, 
has been long a very zealous agriculturist. Mr John Hutchison, 
the younger brother, at Monyruy, obtained tlie second prize for a 
Teeswater bull of his own rearing, at the Highland Society's show 
&amp;t Aberdeen in 1840. The animal was immediately sold for 
eighty guineas ; and this year, three bull calves after him, about 
six months old, brought the same gentleman L.IOO. Very good 
work horses, also, are reared throughout the parish. 

Both five and seven course shifts are used, but chiefly the for- 
mer: Almost the only grain raised is oats. Very little barley is 
sown; and wheat does not appear to be suited to a climate so 
often beclouded and moist. Furrow-draining, at an expense of 
about L. 6 an acre, has been tried with much success on several 
farms; but deep cuts for water are often made, and sunk or tun- 
nel drains laid with stones or hedge prunings, which act verv ef- 
fectually where there is a declivity. The mossy soils, before be- 
ing sown, are burned on the surface, and treated with sand, lime, 
or clay ; and when the season is not too dry, make a very good 
return. Except for these, very little sand is used, and lime sel-- 
dom, unless at the beginning of a new lease. Bone-dust being 
well adapted to the soil, has become indispensable for a turnip 
crop, and is given, if alone, to the extent of 25 to 30 bushels an 
acre; but ordinary dung is commonly laid in the bottom of the 
furrow, over which is strewed a slight covering of mould, and then 
bone-dust, at the rate of about 15 bushels an acre.f 
• Liferents have now ceased, and the leases are generally of 
nineteen years' duration, which, it is believed, might be extended 
with advantage to at least twenty-one years. The farm-buildings, 
though plain, are in general good and commodious. The cattle-

mail-coach runs twice a-day ; and on the latter a stage-coach runs 
frona Peterhead to Banff, and returns in the evening. The other 
roads are numerous and well-planned, but not, in general, kept in 
good enough repair. The bridges on the turnpikes are substan- 
tial, but the two at Auchlee and Rora are old, dilapidated, and 
much needing to be altered both in site and construction. In the 
north-east part, about forty years ago, a canal was partially exe- 
cuted, and used chiefly for transporting shell-sand from the coast 
of St Fergus, but has been long abandoned. 

Ecclesiastical State — ■Incumbents. — The first minister was Mr 
Alexander Martin, from 1619 till about 1635 ; then Mr Alexander 
Irving till 1662, when he and other six members of the presbytery 
of Deer chose rather to demit than to violate conscience by sub- 
mission to impious and unconstitutional power. The vacancy was 
supplied by the appointment in 1662 of Mr Thomas Robertson, 
whose son, Mr Alexander Robertson, was instituted his assistant 
and successor in 1687. A few months after this, the father died, 
and his son was permitted to continue in office after the Revolution 
till 1716, when he and some other ministers in this district were 
deposed for abetting the Rebellion in 1715. The Presbyterian 
ministers who succeeded were, Mr John Lumsden, in 1717; Mr 
John Brown, in 1733; Mr William Greig, in 1790; Mr Thomas 
Kidd, in 1829, who died only three days after his ordination ; and 
the present incumbent, who was ordained in 1830. 

The church is situated in the village of Longside, as nearly as 
possible in the centre of the parish. The old church, which had 
continued without enlargement from 1620, having become insecure, 
and by far too small for the greatly increased population, a plain 
building for about 1000 sitters was founded in 1835, and opened 
for pubhc worship on the 7th August 1836. The seats are 
apportioned among the heritors, and occupied by their tenants 
without charge for rent. The manse, situated about 200 yards 
south-west of the church, was built in 1825. The glebe, including 
garden and site of manse and offices, contains nearly eleven Scotch 
acres. Were the arable part let, it would probably rent for about 
L.25. The stipend is the value of 16 chalders, half meal half 

• Though Episcopacy was established for nearly thirty years nfter this, no change 
seems to have been made on the mode of worship or of discipline. During tlilt 
period, the parochial records contain no allusion to the use of a liturgy, to the keen 
«Dof Christmas, Lent, Easter, or any other fast or festival except those occasional v 
enjoined by authority and the communion was regularly celebrated on two succcs

the legal accommodation. The school fees, payable quarterly 
are, English reading, 2s. ; English reading with writing, 3s. ; En-

ing, and arithmetic, with Latin, 5s. ; with Greek, 7s. ; mathe- 
matics and geography, 10s. ; book-keeping, 10s. 6d. 

Most of the youth between six and fifteen years of age can read 
and write, or are learning to do so. There are scarcely any up- 
wards of fifteen who cannot read and write. The people, in ge- 
neral, are much alive to the benefits of education. As one proof 
of this, it may be mentioned, that they erected, at their own ex- 
pense, the parochial schools at Mintlaw and Rora, and the unen- 
dowed schools at Dens and Lenabo, while a part of them pay a 
salary, besides fees, to the schoolmistress in Longside. 

Literature. — There is a small library at Rora, and another for 
the Sabbath school at Longside. Some of the people subscribe 
to libraries in Old Deer and Peterhead. 

Friendly Societies. — Several of these had existed subsequently 
to the former Statistical Account, but being formed on imperfect 
data, and meeting with losses at the stoppage of the manufactories, 
they were dissolved. In 1809, there was instituted, or rather 
revived, at Nether Kinmundy, of this parish, a society for mutual 
benefit in case of sickness, and for defraying funeral expenses, 
remarkable for the simplicity of its plan, and the advantages it 
continues steadily to afford. No accumulating fund is kept, but 
«d. is-received from each member and lodged with the treasurer, 
and, out of this collection, sick and superannuated allowances are 
paid till the money is expended, when a fresh collection is made. 
A regular certificate of age must be produced, and no one is ad- 
mitted a member under eighteen or above forty-five yearsold. If the 
age exceeds thirty- five, instead of 6d. on admission. Is. must be paid 
A sick member receives 2s. a-week for the first six weeks of his 
illness, and Is. a-week for the next seven, when, if he continue 
unable to work, he is considered superannuated, and receives 6d 
a-week. When a member or his wife dies, each survivino- mem- 
ber contributes Is. towards the payment of the funeral exnses 
Jn admission, various other regulations are agreed to, which tend 
to maintain the usefulness of the institution. A society of Odd 
bellows has lately been set on foot, and, being founded on a surer 
basis than most of the old societies, bids fair to afford more ner 
manent advantage. 1

employments, and consequently dependent, in some measure, on 
the public bounty. Notwithstanding, therefore, the increased 
collections at the new church, the session have been obliged to 
uplift a considerable part of the sum which had been laid up twenty 
or thirty years ago; and thus, unless the heritors make timely and 
regular contributions, this barrier in the way of a legal assessment 
may speedily be removed. 

Fairs. — Of these, eleven are held in the course of the year, viz. 
two at Longside, in May and November; three at Lenabo, in 
March, June, and November ; and six at Mintlaw, in February, 
April, June, August, October, and December, all for cattle, sheep, 
and horses. The two at Longside are also for feeing servants. 
Farmers attend the weekly grain-market in Peterhead. 

Inns. — There are three inns ; that at Mintlaw, being convenient 
for travellers, is most frequented. Of spirit-shops, there are not 
many; and truly desirable it is, that such temptations were more 
withheld from the community than they are. 

Fuel. — This consists chiefly of peat, dug in the parish, and car- 
ried home generally before harvest, costing about 2s. 6d. a cart- 
load. What with casting, setting, and bringing home, it cannot 
be reckoned cheap, except to those who reside near the moss. 
.Wood thinnings are partially used. Coals are also brought from 
Peterhead, the nearest sea-port, and must, at no very distant pe- 
riod, prove almost the only fuel that can be procured. 

Miscellaneous Obsehvations. 
In all that respects the profitable cultivation of land and rearing 
of cattle, the efficiency of implements and commodiousness of 
dwellings, an incredible advance has been made in the course of 
the last fifty years. Superstitious notions and usages have mostly 
fled, prejudices have given way, and sympathies have been ex- 
tended to a wider range. Business is transacted in a more liberal 
spirit, and credit is placed on a more solid foundation. Other 
improvements have been already noticed in the course of this ac- 
count. Happy would the writer be, if, with equal certainty, he 
could record a corresponding advance in all that relates to vital 
Christianity, and to the infinitely higher interests of the life to 
come.

I _TOPOGKAPHY AND NaTURAL HlSTORY. 

ame —This parish has two names, Dalmaik and Drumoak, 
both of which have been written differently at different periods. 
The first is the name generally given to it by the people m the 
parish and neighbourhood, and seems, indeed, to be the most an- 
cient, for, so early as the year 1157, there is mentioned m a bull 
of Pope Adrian IV. « Ecclesiam de Dulmayok," whereas the 
latter name, Drumoak, has not been observed in any writing ear- 
lier than 1407, at which date, a charter granted by Bishop GilberE 
is subscribed, « Alexr. de Kynloch, prebendarius de Drumaok. 
After that period, both names seem to have been used indiscrimi 
nately, so that in 1541, the copies of a charter, and the precep 
of sasine on it, are signed " Robertus Lockhart de Dulmaok, J and 
in 1543, a charter of obligation by the vicars of the choir is signe 
by the same individual, « Robertus Lockhart de Drumaok. § 

Drumoak, which thus appears to be the more modern name of 
the parish, is derived from the Gaelic word Drum, the ridge of a 
hill, and Moloch Molochus, contracted into Moah, the name ot 
a celebrated saint, in honour of whom a monastery was erected m 
St Servanus's Isle, on the water of Leven, which gave its nanie 
to the parish of Portmoak, so that the word Drumoak s-gG

Dalraaik is compounded of the Gaelic word Dal, a liaugh or 
•valley, and the name of the saint, contracted into Maik instead 
of Moak, as in the former case, hence the word Dalmaik signifies 
the valley of St Moloch, a name which is very descriptive of that 
part of the parish where the ruins of the old church stand. And 
this derivation is supported by the circumstance, that, beside the 
old church although within the boundary of the parish of Peter- 
culter, there is a holy well, which is known by the name of St 
Maik's Well  

Extent, Boundaries, 8fc. — This parish is situated in the counties 
of Aberdeen and Kincardine ; is 6 measured miles in length, ave- 
rages about 2 in breadth, and contains an area of nearly 12 square 
miles. It is bounded by Banchory- Ternan, Echt, Peterculter, and 
Durris; being divided from Echt and Peterculter, on the north, 
by the burns of Gormac and Culter, — and from Durris, on the 
south, by the river Dee. Xts figure is somewhat triangular, but 
very irregular, on account of the manner in which it is indented or 
dove-tailed into the neighbouring parishes of Peterculter on the 
east, and Banchory- Ternan on the west. No part of its surface 
is much elevated, the Drum Hill which is the highest, and stands 
in the centre of the parish, being only 500 feet above the level 
of the sea. From this elevation the ground falls on all sides, with 
gentle undulations, to the different boundaries, except on the east 
side, where the Ord Hill rises rather abruptly to the height of about 
430 feet above the sea, and runs its ridge to the extremity of the pa- 
rish in that direction. The southern peak of the Drum Hill affords 
a magnificent and extensive prospect, the eye ranging almost from 
the German Ocean, on the east, along the valley watered by the 
river, and bounded on the south by the chain of Grampians, till 
it rests, in the far west, on the snow-clad mountains among which 
the Dee has its source. 

Meteorology. — Dee-side is proverbially dry and thirsty, and to 
no part of that extensive district is the remark more applicable 
than to this parish. The soil in that division of it which lies alono- 
the bank of the river is not only light, but generally rests on a bed 
of gravel, through which the rain easily filters away, and, in cou 

 Camerarius in his book, De statu Hominis et Sanctis Regni ScotijE, gives the 
Allowing account of St Molochus : " 25 die Junii. Sanctus Molonachus siue Mo- 
lochus Episcopus et confessor qui pro viribus in Maria Scotie prouincia proximorum 
aiuti studuit. De eo vide Boetium, Leslaum, et alios. Argadenses Scoti constan-

sequence of its southerly inclination, the rays of the sun beat upon 
it intensely, and quickly dry up any moisture which m.ght have 
lingered about the plants. To add to this disadvantage less rain 
seems to fall here than on places in the vicinity, for the clouds 
which appear on the west pouring out their watery treasures on 
the hiah grounds of Banchory and Strachan, instead of continu. 
ing their course down the valley, which a stranger would think in- 
evitable, are often attracted by the Grampians on the south, and 
the Hill of Fare on the north; so that the anxious farmer fre- 
quently sees, day after day, heavy rains falling in the immediate 
neighbourhood, while his parched crops, unrefreshed by a single 
shower, languish beneath the sun's unclouded influence. This 
nconvenience, indeed, is partially remedied by the sea-fogs, which, 
towards the evening of a sultry day, creep up the course of the 
river from the east, and roll over the Grampians from the south, 
filling the valley with a refreshing niist, which continues spread 
over it through the night; but as this, although very benehcial is 
nu te inadequate to raise a luxuriant crop of straw, the sma ler 
farmers unable to purchase and drive it from a distance, are fre- 
quently in dry seasons obliged to bruise whins for their cattle to 
supply the deficiency. .

parish for nearly four miles, is the highest river in Great Britain, 
its source being on Braeriach, a mountain in the head of Braemar, 
4000 feet above the level of the sea. From that alpine region it 
descends impetuously in an easterly direction, and, after pursuing 
a winding course through scenes of acknowledged grandeur and 
magnificence, falls into the German Ocean at Aberdeen, nearly 
eighty miles from its source. The superabundant waters of about 
900 square miles feed its current, but so clean are its gravelly 
banks and pebbly channel, that its water rivals in purity the most 
limpid streams in Scotland. Having run between sixty and seventy 
miles from its source, and fallen 3870 feet, it enters this parish at 
an elevation of 130, and passes its eastern extremity at the old 
church, 90 feet above the medium level of the sea. When at an 
ordinary summer height, its stream on this part of its course va- 
ries in depth from 2 to 12 feet, and its breadth from 10 to 70 
yards, its average fall being 10 feet per mile,  and its velocity 
about 3 miles an hour. At the great flood in August 1829, the 
height which it attained on the lawn at Park, where a wide ex- 
panse of haugh allowed its water to spread on both sides of the 
channel, was 14 feet above its ordinary summer level. This 
beautiful river, though much superior to its gentler neighbour, the 
Don, in the value of its salmon -fishings, has never, like it, been 
rendered serviceable to the manufacturer ; for, at no part of its 
course, is its tine stream employed as a moving power to any kind 
of machinery. Nor does it compensate this unprofitableness to 
the manufacturer by rivalling the Don in usefulness to the agri- 
culturist ; for instead of fattening his meadows with a rich alluvion, 
its inundations carry off the best part of the soil, and deposit in its 
■place a bed of sand possessed of little or no vegetative power ; 
while its wintry torrent, unwilling to be restrained, contends power- 
fully with the embankments which have been raised to protect the 
haughs from its destructive ravages, and occasions great trouble 
and expense to the proprietors, in repairing the breaches which it 
too frequently makes. This difference between the two rivers, 
and the value of their respective banks, are well contrasted in the 
•proverbial lines, 

" A foot o' Don's worth twa o' Dee, 
Except it be for fish and tree." 

The Loch of Drum is a fine oblong sheet of water, which co- 
vers a space of 84 acres, 3 roods, 7 poles. Its margin is fringed

with alders, and on tliree sides it is bounded by a thriving plants- | 
tion of larch, birch, and Scotch fir. Tlie average depth of its 
water is now reduced to about four feet, the late proprietoi- having 
allowed Sir Robert Burnett to draw off four feet in order to dry 
a low tract of ground belonging to him at its western extremity. 
This is much to be regretted, as the water on many parts is now 
so shallow that a very few summers must cover them with aquatic 
plants, which, at no distant period, will convert this beautiful loch 
into an unsightly morass. 

Geology and Mineralogy.— 'oiVm of much interest to the 
geologist and mineralogist has hitherto been discovered in this pa- 
rish. The only rocks which appear above the surface are gneiss 
and granite ; and these are at present so little exposed that they 
cannot be subjected to accurate examination. Boulders of the 
same kinds occur abundantly, and are employed in the erection of 
fences and farm-steadings. On that part of the glebe which is 
called the Keith's moor, flint of a black and yellow colour is found. 

Soi7.— The soil is various, but mostly of an inferior quality. 
That which lies along the river side is light and sandy, recumbent 
on gravel, and consequently dry and early. In other places, it is 
thin and moorish, and frequently rests on till, or an equally hard 
and retentive moor-band. Some spots, however, which have long 
been under cultivation, are loamy, and, when properly treated, carry 
abundant crops. There are several mosses in the parish from which 
the inhabitants dig fuel ; but, with the exception of that part of the 
red moss which lies in it, and is of great depth, they are all near- 
ly exhausted, and much of them might be profitably converted into 
arable land. Many oak, alder, birch, and fir trees, the wreck of 
the noble forests which once adorned this part of the country, are 
found imbedded in them. And as these relics are often disco- 
vered with their roots attached, and lying in an easterly direction, 
they must be regarded as memorials of some westerly storm's de- 
structive efl-ects, of which, amid the revolution of centuries, even 
tradition itself has lost the record. 

Zoology.— The woods of Park and Drum are frequented by roe- 
deer. Foxes and polecats infest the same coverts ; but their de- 
predations seldom extend to the poultry-house, as they can always 
prey with more safety on the common hare and rabbit, winch are

"Very numerous. Among the brush-wood and furze, the hedge- 
hog is increasing rapidly ; and in the cairns and drystone fences, 
the weasel or commoti whitret abounds. The otter is often seen 
pursuing his destructive occupation in the river ; and the badger, 
though less abundant than formerly, is still occasionally met with 
on its banks. 

Ornithology, — The extensive plantations which have been rear- 
ed, and the progress of agricultural improvements, have increased 
in the parish the number of many species of birds, diminished that 
of others, and rendered some altogether extinct. Upon the moors 
the lapwing and plover are found in their season. In fenny copses, 
the woodcock appears about the beginning of October ; and on 
the open marshes, which generally abound with common snipes, 
the jack-snipe [Scolopax gallinula is frequently met with, and. 
the whistle of the lonely curlew is also sometimes heard. In the 
fields partridges are numerous ; but black-cock {Tetrao tetrix, be- 
came extinct in the parish about three years ago, and only two or 
three packs of moor-fowl Tetrao Scoticus, are now hatched an- 
nually in the Red moss. In belts and young plantations, the 
chaffinch, bulfinch, red-breast, common wren Troglodytes Euro- 
pceus, and several creepers, are abundant. The golden-crested 
wren {Regulus auricapillus, though sometimes seen, is rare ; and 
the goldfinch Fringilla carduelis, must also be regarded as un- 
common. In the same coverts, the blackbird and thrush have 
become so numerous, that the sweetness of their song no longer 
protects them in the garden from the fate of other depredators. 
The woods afford a suitable retirement for ringdoves, and some 
of the most common species of hawks and owls ; and the wood of 
Drum, in particular, is frequented not only by the Royston or 
hooded-crow Corvus coraijc, the jackdaw Corvus monedula , and 
the magpie Garrulus pica ; but a numer'ous colony of rooks C. 
fnigilegus, have occupied part of it as a nursery for many years. 
This last species pair about the middle of February, build their 
nests early in March, lay four or five eggs, which are hatched in 
April, and towards the middle of May their young appear upon the 
branches. The myriads of birds which belong to this rookery, . 
and inhabit it throughout the year, except for a few weeks in sum- 
mer, when many of them are supposed to migrate in quest of 
mountain- berries, are not only of great benefit to the country for 
many miles around ; but from the commencement of incubation to 
the time at which their young become capable of providing for

themselves, they are particularly so to the farmers in their imme 
diate neighbourhood, for, being unable at that period to go far 
from their nests in search of food, they are da.ly seen actively em- 
ployed in turning clods, and clearing of vermm the newly sown 
fields, so that few complaints are heard m this parish of the de- 

structive ravages of grub. i -n • '

early in February. This bird, according to Buffon, "never mha- 
bits the marshes or the mouths of rivers, but remains constantly 
„„ or near the beach ; probably because fresh waters do not a - 
ford the proper subsistence," In this country, however U hab.ts

the river, become superior in quality to those which remain in the 
loch, the pureness of the water and greater abundance of food 
making them whiter, firmer, and more delicate; those which ave- 
rage from two to three pounds are esteemed the best. In the 
Dee, all the kinds already mentioned occur more or less frequently; 
also par, sea-trout {Salmo trutta, white trout or phinoc {Salmo 
albus, and flounder. But the fish for which it has long and justly 
been celebrated is salmon Salmo salar. They formed, in ancient 
times, the principal article of exports from Aberdeen, and were 
esteemed of so superior a quality, that a small barrel of them 
formed part of the provisions of the ship, which was sent in 1290, 
to bring over the infant Queen of Scotland from Norway. Al- 
though less abundant now than formerly, they still retain their 
character for excellence, and generally bring the highest price 
both in the home and foreign markets. They ascend the river 
heavy with spawn about the end of September, and are found re- 
turning to the sea until the close of February. The state of the 
salmon-fishings here, and the cause of their unproductiveness, will 
be noticed afterwards. 

Botany. — As the soil of this parish is generally of inferior qua- 
lity, and none of its surface much elevated, a great variety in its 
botanical productions cannot be expected. The Dee, however, 
enriches its flora with many beautiful specimens of alpine species ; 
a considerable number of aquatics are furnished by the loch of 
Drum ; and a few plants, of rather rare occurrence, have been 
observed in other localities. It would be useless to particularize 
many of the more interesting species, such as 

Utricularia inteimedia Nymphasa alba Goodyera repens 

Arundo epigejos Nuphar lutea Osmunda regalis 

Poa aquatica Origanum vulgare Pilularia globulifera 

Potamogeton heterophyllum CJinopodium vulgaie Equisetum fluviatile, &amp;c.

Peplis portula Hieracium subaudum 

as they have already been noted, and their localities indicated by 
Mr Dickie in his Flora Abredonensis, and by the late Dr Murray 
in his Northern Flora. But the following plants, to which these 
writers have assigned no habitat in this parish, may be mentioned 
with propriety, as they are either rare in Scotland, or of infrequent 
occurrence in the surrounding district.

Woods.— W\\\{m the last thirty years, extensive plantations of 
larch and Scotch fir, interspersed with birch and other hard-wood 
trees, have been reared upon the different estates, and have added 
greatly to the beauty, comfort, and fertility of the parish. They 
are at present in a very thriving condition, and may be expected, 
in a few vears, amply to repay the proprietors. In the policie 
of Drum," there are a good many old oak, ash, plane, and elm- 
trees, which have attained such a size as indicates that they ar 
contrenial to the soil and climate ; and near the house are tw 
larg°e and beautiful hollies, the stem of one of which is 7 feet hig' 
from the ground to the lowermost branches, and is 7 feet 6 inche 
in circumference. 

II.— Civil History.  
The estate of Drum, which at present constitutes one-halt ot 
the parish, was originally part of a royal forest, and one of the 
hunting-seats of the Kings of Scotland. The park of Drum 
formed part of the chase, and a powerful spring, at the north-east 
end of the loch, is still known by the designation of the Kings 
Well. This estate has long been possessed by the family ot the 
present proprietor, Irvine of Drum, being a name which is re- 
corded with honour in the national annals. William de Irwin 
the first of that line, who belonged to the family of Irwin ot 
Bonshaw, in Dumfries-shire, and is supposed by some to have 
been its chief, was chosen by Robert Bruce, when struggling with 
Edward I. for the Crown of Scotland, to be his armour-bearer 
receiving, at the same time, the device which Bruce himself had 
borne as Earl of Carrick, viz. three bunches o 1- ye-es sup- 
ported by two savages, wreathed, with the motto, Sub so e sb 
umbra virens;" and having accompanied his roya -- - - 
wanderings, participated in his narrow escapes, and attended bm 
Ze pe'oiming Lse deeds of desperate valour which ha 
Thrown an air of romance around his history, was rewarded by 
him for hi, great zeal and fidelity with a grant by charter under

Some time after this, a deadly fend seems to have arisen be- 
tween the Keiths, hereditary great Marischals of Scotland, and 
the Irvines of Drum ; and tradition tells of a fight which took 
place between them on a moor on the north bank of the Dee, 
which now forms part of the glebe, and is known by the name of 
the Keiths' Muir. In that battle the Irvines were victorious, and 
drove their enemies across the river, at a deep and rocky part of 
its channel, which still bears the appellation of the Keiths' Pot ; 
and a rock, which occasionally appears a few inches above the wa- 
ter, on which, as is said, one of the fugitives took refuge and was 
killed, retains the name of the Keiths' Stone. In order to stop 
this bloody feud, the states of the kingdom interfered, and enjoined 
Alexander Irvine, the third in descent, to marry Elizabeth Keith, 
daughter of the great Marischal. Drum so far tempered his re- 
sentment with that spirit of loyalty which has always distinguished 
the family, as to enter into the proposed alliance, by submitting 
to the performance of the marriage ceremony ; and this external 
union, which seems to have been all that took place between the 
parties, had the desired effect of binding the two families together 
in bonds of friendship, which remained long unbroken. But this 
powerful Baron not only distinguished himself in feudal fights with 
the great Marischal, but also when opposed to the more forml- 
dable forces of Donald, Lord of the Isles. That chieftain having 
taken possession of the Earldom of Ross, and ravaged the fertile 
, provinces of Moray, Strathbogie, and the Garioch, was met by 
the Lowland army, under the Regent's nephew, at Harlaw, 
about nineteen miles west from Aberdeen. There a bloody con- 
flict ensued, during which, Irvine of Drum who had a com- 
mand in the Lowland army, and Maclean of Dowart Donald's 
Lieutenant-General, encountered each other, and fought hand 
to hand with such determined bravery, that both were killed 
Drum was buried on the field of battle by his followers, who also 
raised a cairn of remembrance over his grave ; and the following 
stanza, in the popular ballad of the battle of Harlaw, composed at 
the time, records at once his gallantry, and the high respect with 
Which his countrymen regarded him :

df Drum, his said son, and their friends, tlieir good and thankful 
service done to the King in searching, taking, and bringing his 
rebels to justice." The young laird, whose loyalty and zeal are 
recognized in that document, took an active part also in the stir- 
ring events which occurred during the minority of Mary, till, hav- 
ing joined the Regent near Musselburgh, to aid in repelling the 
English invasion by the Duke of Somerset, he was killed in his 
father's lifetime at the fatal battle of Pinkey, where so many of 
Scotland's best and bravest fell. 

The son of this gentleman succeeded to the estates on the 
death of his grandfather, and married Lady Elizabeth Keith, 
daughter of the Earl Marischal. Their eldest son obtained the 
lands in 1583, and distinguished himself as a patron of learning, 
and a benefactor to the poor. In 1629, he devised L. 10,000 
Scots, for the maintenance of four bursars in philosophy and two 
in divinity at the Marischal College, and four at the grammar- 
school of Aberdeen, vesting the right of presenting to them in the 
family of Drum. He also mortified 32 bolls of meal to persons 
on his property in this parish, viz. 12 to poor scholars, 8 to the 
parochial schoolmaster for teaching them, and 12 to decayed te- 
nants,— all of which are annually divided at the sight of the kirk- 
session. His lady Lady Marion Douglas, daughter of the Earl 
of Buchan, also mortified 3000 merks, anno 1633, to endow a 
hospital in Aberdeen, for the widows and aged daughters of decayed 
burgesses, the patronage of which is exercised by the town-council. 

This benevolent man was succeeded bv Sir Alexander, his eld- 
est son, who married Magdalen, daughter of Sir John Scrimzeour 
of Diddup, Constable of Dundee. He was sheriff principal of 
Aberdeen m 1634, and several following years; and obtained -i 
patent from King Charles L creating him Earl of Aberdeen 
which the breaking out of the civil war prevented from passing the 
threat Seal. During the subsequent troubles he suffered much in 
his person, his family, and his property, on account of his attach- 
ment to the Royal cause. His house and lands were frequently 
occupied and plundered by the army of the Covenant; and he 
mmself was warded, fined, and more than once obliged to flee for 
safety to the court of England.

ceeded to the estates upon the death of his father, in 176], and 
is the nineteenth laird, and the fourteenth in descent, being both 
the heir of line and the heir of entail of this ancient and honour- 
able family. He holds the patronage of the church, and, in point 
of valued rent, is the principal heritor, and resident in the parish. 

Leys. — That part of the land of Leys which is situated in this 
parish, and forms the next great division of it, lies within the 
boundary of the county of Kincardine, and has, for upwards of five 
hundred years, been in possession of the family of the present pro- 
prietor, Sir Thomas Burnett, Bart. The family seat is at Crathes, 
in Banchory-Ternan, which renders it unnecessary to enter mi- 
nutely into the history of the family here, as that will be done 
with greater propriety in the account of the parish in which the 
family is resident. It may, however, be suitably observed, that a 
charter of the lands of Kilhenach, Clerach, &amp;c, in this parish, 
was granted to Alexander Biirnard, by King Robert Bruce, in the 
eighteenth year of his reign,  1324, and was confirmed to his suc- 
cessor, Robert Burnard, by a charter under the Great Seal, grant- 
ed by King David Bruce, in 1358. The first time that we find 
the name of this barony assumed as the distinguishing title of the 
family is in 1409; and King James III., in 1481., gave a charter 
under the Great Seal of the lands of Cannoglerocht to Alexander 
Burnett of Leys. In the year 1621, Thomas Burnett received 
the honour of Knighthood from James VI. ; and, about five years 
afterwards, « Charles I. created him a Baronet, by his Royal pa- 
tent, to him and his heirs-male whatever, terrarum baronise et re- 
galitatis de Leys-Burnet, in Nova Scotia in America." Sir 
Thomas Burnett, who succeeded to the patrimonial honours and 
estates in 1838, is the nineteenth Laird, and the eight Baronet of 
Leys, and ranks as the second heritor in this parish. 

ParA.— The lands of Park described in the original charter 
as situated in Kincardineshire, but now rated in Aberdeenshire, 
formed, as has already been observed, part of a royal chase, 
and, having been reserved by Robert I. when he gave the fo- 
rest lands to William de Irwin, were granted, by Charter from Kincr 
David Bruce to Walter Moigne. In 1348, John Moigne, Lord 
of the Park of the Drum, executed a disposition of it to Alexan- 
der Irvine, Lord of the Drum; and, in 1393, the said John 
Moigne granted a charter in favour of said Alexander Irvine of 
a chalder of meal, paid of old to him by William de Burnard, for 
sustentation of the Park of Drum. These lands continued in the 

 ronagc of Scotland.

Parochial Registers. — The parish registers are voluminous. 
The record of doctrine and discipline consists of eight volumes, 
all of which are complete, except the first, which wants two leaves 
at the beginning, and contain an interesting account of ecclesi- 
astical transactions in the parish from 17th September 1682, the 
date of the earliest entry. The baptism register two vols. was 
begun 3d January 1692, and the register of marriage contracts 2d 
June 1715; and, from these dates, both have been carefully 
brought down to the present day. A cash-book, in three volumes, 
contains an account of the intromissions of the session with the 
poor's funds from Whitsunday 1750. No register of deaths has 
ever been kept in the parish. 

Antiquities. — The Fort or Tower of Drum stands upon the east 
side of the hill of that name, and is a large and venerable build- 
ing. The date of its erection cannot be ascertained, as it existed 
when the estate was conveyed to the family in 1323; but it is 
conjectured, from the character of its architecture, that it must 
have been built about the twelfth century, while the forest of Drum 
was a royal chase, — probably by King William the Lion. It is of 
an oblong form, somewhat rounded at the corners, being 50 feet 6 
inches by 39 feet at the base, and 70 feet 6 inches in height to 
the top of the battlement. Its interior is divided into three sto- 
ries — the roofs of which are of vaulted mason-work ; but as the 
two uppermost seem to have been subdivided into two apartments 
each the one over the other, by a wooden floor, fixed to stones 
which still project from both sides of the wall, the whole interior, 
when inhabited, may have been divided into five stories. There are 
at present two entrances to this tower, one on the south-west corner, 
which communicates with the house, and another, which seems to be 
the original one, is near the south-east corner of the building, 12 
feet from the ground, on entering by which there are two inner 
doors immediately in front. Within the one towards the right is 
a dark narrow stair of 19 steps, which leads down to the dungeon 
which is the first story, an apartment 28 feet 6 inches by 15 feet 
6 inches, and 1 1 feet high, having a draw-well in one corner 9 
feet.deep, and a hole in the roof communicating with the apart- 
ments above, through which, it is imagined, the prisoners were 



ggg ABERDEENSHIRE. 

supplied with food. The «U here is 1 1 feet thick Tle "ther 
inner door opens into the second storey, vhieh s 32 feet bj 20 feet 
6 inches, and 22 feet 9 inches in height. Upon the r.ght of he 
common entrance, and near the door ot the dungeon, .s a nan« 
stair, which winds up through the centre of the '»   
storey, which is 24 feet 9 inches high, and of much the same area 
ah one just described. In the east end of its vaulted roof ,s a 
small door which leads out to the battlement, -J  
obtained from the apartment below by means ot a"-";;;"';" 
der. This ancient edifice is kept in complete repair, and .ts walls 
ars anoarentlv as entire as when newly erected. 
"U d'er this head may also be noticed a carved stone,w w 
removed from the farm of the Gallow-burn now called Bakebare 
by the workmen employed in building the House of Pa k and 

which, although much defaced, was happdy =™ YTfficurto d"-

Modern Buildings. — The House of Drum, which adjoins the 
tower, is a large and spacious mansion. It was erected in 1619, 
and belongs to the Elizabethan style of architecture. Several im- 
portant alterations were made upon it, at different times, by the 
present proprietor, who also removed the garden to a more suit- 
able distance, and effected many great improvements on the plea- 
sure grounds. The House of Park is a beautiful Grecian building, 
and was erected by the late proprietor in 1822, who also laid out 
the garden and surrounding policies with much taste and judgment. 

ni. — Population. 
The last Statistical Account of this parish contains the amount 
of its population at different dates from the time of Dr Webster's 
Report in 1755 to the year 1790; from which we learn, that it 
amounted at the latter period to 708, of whom 321 were males 
and 387 females. The following table shows the state of the po- 
pulation since that time : —

The increase which has taken place is to be attributed chiefly to 
the agricultural improvement of the parish ; much waste land having 
been reclaimed and formed into new tenements.

grain sown out with rye-grass and clover; 5. hay; 6. and 7. pas-, 
ture ; but as top-dressing is difficult to be procured, and as the 
light soils are much pulverized by the frequent ploughings to which 
they are subjected under this rotation, it is thought by many too 
exhausting. Several farmers have, therefore, tried a six-shift ro- 
tation, under which only one crop of grain is taken before the fal- 
low crop — a system which is certainly preferable in many respects 
to the former, as much labour and seed are saved, without any se- 
rious diminution being experienced in the yearly quantity of grain, 
on account of the improved condition into which it brings the 
land. After a few years trial of this course of cropping, however, 
some complained that it did not produce a sufficient quantity of 
straw, in consequence of which they abandoned it, and have re- 
turned to the seven-shift rotation. . Before the powerful effects of 
bone-dust were discovered, the expense attending the carriage of 
night-soil from Aberdeen rendered it necessary, in a great mea- 
sure, to regulate agricultural operations by the contents of the 
farm-yard ; but this excellent manure being now extensively and 
successfully employed here in the raising of turnips, the farmer is 
enabled to apply the home-manure to his other crops, and when a 
portion of the turnips is eaten off with sheep, the light soil is 
thereby consolidated, and rendered much more fertile. 

Draining and Embanking. — A considerable breadth of marshy 
land has been reclaimed by draining; but the system of thorough 
draining has not yet been introduced, although it might be appli- 
ed with great advantage to different parts of the parish. The in- 
creased exertions which, of late years, have been made through- 
out the country generally, to effect a more perfect drainage of wet 
land, have rendered the Dee subject to more frequent and much 
higher floods than formerly, so that embanking is now absolutely 
necessary for the protection of its haughs. This operation, how- 
ever, has hitherto been confined in this parish to the estate of 
Park, on which an embankment, 2320 yards in extent, was begun 
by Mr Burnett, and completed by the late proprietor in 1821, and 
cost upwards of L. 1000. It was finished in the most substantial 
fioanner, and according to the most approved plans, but was so 
breached and otherwise injured by the great flood in August 1829, 
that an additional sum of L.IOOO had to be expended in repairing 
It. On that occasion it was considerably strengthened, and piers, 
were projected at the curves to break the force of the stream, so 
that no apprehension was entertained of its speedily giving way a.

second time. But the river having risen in the autumn of last 
vear, to within a few inches of its height in 1829, a considerable 
portion of the embankment again yielded to its pressure, and the 
torrent, charged with drift-wood, swept with irresistible violence 
over the haugh and lawn, destroying the crops on the former, and 
committing great devastation among the clumps and belts which 
ornamented and enclosed the latter. The present proprietor, 
however, is about to repair it in a more judicious manner, a the 
estimated expense of L. 1500 ; and when that sum shall have been 
expended, this embankment, which protects only 60 or 70 acres of 
indifferent haugh land, will have cost, within twenty years, upwards 

ofL.3500.  , . 

Leases and Farm-BuUdings, c§-c.-The leases of the farms are 
for nineteen years; a term which seems to be satisfactory to hot 
landlord and tenant. The farm-steadings are much improved, 
those lately erected being neat, substantial, and commodious A 
great deal of the arable land has been enclosed with stone dikes 
within the last twenty years, and many of the fields, especially 
upon Park, are well sheltered by belts of thriving wood; but much 
of this kind of work remains to be done in different parts of th 
parish. It may not be improper to state, as a proof of the ex 
tensive nature of the improvements which have been effected upo 
Park alone, that, in 1807, Mr Burnett purchased that estate to 
L9000, and, in 1839, Mr Kinloch, the present proprietor, pur- 
chased it from Mr Moir for L.28,500. 

Fisheries.-On that part of the Dee which bounds this parish 
there are three stations where the salmon-fishery is prosecuted 
with the drag-net and cobble. They were formerly very produc- 
tive, and brought high rents annually to the proprietors ; bu their 
value is now much reduced on account of a deficiency of hsh, 
hich has of late years been so great, that the number aken m a 
season has frequently been inadequate to cover the actual expense 
Various causes have been assigned for this deficiency, but it 
liefly to be atthbuted to the employment of stake and bag-nets 
in the fishery. These destructive engines are so thickly pla. ted 
Ing the coast, and placed so close to the river's mouth, h 
tZl he salmo'n instLtively approach the beach in searc

the fact, that the success of the upper river fishings depends al- 
most entirely on a strict observance of the Sunday's ship, is quite 
sufficient to account for the deficiency complained of, so that we 
no longer wonder at so few fish being now taken at stations which 
were formerly more productive, but rather feel astonished that so 
many succeed in effecting an entrance into the river while its 
mouth is beset with such formidable obstructions. 

But this mode of prosecuting the fishery is not only thus inju- 
rious to the property of the river heritors, it also lends, in no small 
degree, to render the breed of this fish extinct; for, if fresh water 
be its native element, which seems placed beyond a doubt, not 
only by the absence of all proof on the other side, but by the fact 
of their regularly and universally frequenting it at the spawning 
season, and also by the diff'erence more or less observable, which 
enables experienced fishermen to distinguish from each other the 
fish of various rivers, then the high spawning-ground must be the 
most eligible, and the productiveness of the ensuing season be 
mainly dependent on the spawn which is there deposited ; because 
the upper fords and shallows, where the spawning-beds are formed, 
are liable to little or no alteration by traffic and the violence of 
winter-floods, so that the spawn rests there in safety. Whereas 
spawning-beds on the lower part of the river are continually ex- 
posed to accidents, for, when the water is low, the passing and 
repassing of carts and cattle, and the grounding of rafts and drift- 
wood upon the fords must be very injurious, and when the stream 
is swelled by the accumulated waters of a flood, its violence can 
scarcely fail to remove the gravel with which the beds are covered, 
and expose the spawn to the ravages of trout, which are known to 
devour it greedily. Sometimes, indeed, when the flood has been 
high, the receding waters leave the spawn upon the bank, furnish- 
ing thereby irresistible evidence of the destruction which it has 
occasioned. Every mode of fishing, therefore, which makes the 
stock of salmon dependent on the spawn deposited in the lower 
part of the river, where the beds are so insecure, must tend ulti- 
mately to destroy the breed of this valuable fish. But the present 
mode of employing the stake and bag-nets has that eff'ect, because, 
by infringing the Sunday's slap, the ascent of the fish to the up- 
per spawning-ground is in a great degree prevented. No greater 
number, indeed, may have ultimately escaped formerly than now, 
during the six days of the week ; but when the Sunday's slap 
was observed, the shoals, which entered the river early, had no

passes through the whole length of the parish, an extent of six 
miles, along which the Aberdeen and Ballater mail-coach runs 
daily, and, in the summer months, a stage-coach between Ban- 
chory and Aberdeen. 

Ecclesiastical State.— T\\e Bishop's see having been translated 
from Mortlach to Aberdeen by King David I. in 1154, Bishop 
Edward instituted a college of canons, which was apostolically con- 
firmed by Pope Adrian IV. anno 1157, in whose bull already 
i-eferred to there is mentioned among the other churches of the 
bishopric, " Ecclesiam de Dulmayok cum pertinentiis suis." In 
1368, Bishop Kinynmond II. added the pastor of Drumoak to 
the chapter of the cathedral, " ad instantiam discreti viri magistri 
Johanis de peblis ;"t and in a list of the value of the different pre- 
bends made by Bishop Ingram in 1448, the last entry is " Dul- 
mayk X tt."+ 

The former parish church was very inconveniently situated for 
the inhabitants, being placed upon the extreme point of a narrow 
strip of land which protrudes along the side of the river into Pe- 
terculter. There is no record nor traditionary account of the time 
at which that house of God was erected, but when abandoned, in 
1837, it was probably about three hundred years old. Within its 
gray ruin is the tombstone of Mr David Lindsay, elder, who was 
minister of this parish at different periods between 1654 and 
1702 ; and near it, upon the adjoining wall, is another, which 
marks the grave of his successor, the inscription on which is al- 
most obliterated by the hand of time. The surrounding church- 
yard considering the circumstances of the parish contains many 
grave-stones, the epitaphs on which are in general simply but well 
expressed ; and one, which is in excellent preservation, bears the 
date of 1634. 

The present church, which is situated nearly in the centre of 
the parish, was founded in the spring of 1835, and opened for 
public worship on the 13th November 1836. It is built in the 
Gothic style, from a design by Mr Archibald Simpson, architect 
in Aberdeen, and is finished in so neat, comfortable, and even ele- 
gant a manner, that it is the best specimen in this part of the 
■country of what a parochial church ought to be. The expense of 
its erection was L.1002, 14s. 2d.; and it is calculated to contain 
about 630 sitters, allowing 18 inches to each. The seats are all

they had set apart 1 1 sittings to the minister, 5 to the schoolmas- 
ter 10 to the elders, 10 for the accommodation of persons attend- 
ing baptisms, and 22 for poor people who have no land attached to 
their dwelling-houses. It also contains a small room m which the 
relicious department of the parish library is managed, and a very 
comfortable vestry for the convenience of the minister. 

The manse is about half a mile distant from the parish church 
and was erected in 1836, from a design by Mr Smith architect 
in Aberdeen, and, with the offices which were furnished at the 
same time, cost L.800. It is a handsome and commodious build- 
ng, pleasantly situated by the side of the river, on a bar.n 
Pi e of ground in the centre of the glebe, containing about four 
acres which, although exceedingly worthless for any other purpose 
s w I adapled for being laid out as pleasure ground on account 
of the beautifully diversified form of its surface. In f-nt is a t r 
raced garden, now almost finished, which contains, I rood, 28 falls 
14 perches. To that little spot the present incumbent has carried 
inwards of 2000 cart-loads of earth, collected from the banks of 
and other waste places on the glebe ; and the heritors, who 
always study his comfort and convenience, have enclosed it in the 
ttCra/manner, with a stone and Ume

Education. — There are three schools in the parish, the paro- 
chial school, the session's school, and Miss Irvine of Drum's 
school. The branches taught in the parochial school are, Eng- 
lish reading and grammar, writing, geography, arithmetic, mathe- 
matics, and Latin. The quarterly fees are, for reading, 2s. 6d. ; 
reading and writing, 3s. 6d.; arithmetic, 4s. 6d. ; Latin, 5s.— 
nothing additional being charged for English grammar and geo- 
graphy. The teacher has the legal accommodation, and draws 
yearly about L.20 as school-fees, L.30 of salary, 8 bolls of meal 
for teaching poor scholars on Drum's mortification, and what may 
be awarded him by the Trustees of the Dick Bequest. The ses- 
sion's school at Glashmore is in that part of the parish which lies 
in the county of Kincardine, and is under the patronage of the 
kirk-session. The branches taught in it are elementary and the 
scale of fees is the same as at the parochial school. The teacher 
has at present only a free house and small garden, the privilege 
of procuring fire from a neighbouring moss, a salary of L.5, which 
IS raised by subscription, and school-fees, which may amount to

PRESBYTERY OK ELLON, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. JAMES ROBERTSON, MINISTER. 



I.— Topography and Natural History. 
Name.—Tn name Ellon is generally supposed to be a cor- 
ruption of the Gaelic word Aikann, which signifies an island. Its 
appropriation as the name of this parish may be accounted for by 
the circumstance that a small island in the river Ythan, adjacent 
to the site of the village of Ellon, marks the position of the ferry 
formerly used on the principal line of road leading from Aberdeen 
to the north-eastern districts of Scotland. In support of the 
origm here assigned to the name Ellon, it may be remarked, that 
m an inscription on some old communion cups, presented to the 
k.rk-session by the Forbeses of Watertown, the word is written 
Elleann Port-Ellon, the name of a village in Perthshire, is un- 
derstood to be of similar derivation. 

_ Exient and Boundaries.-The parish of Ellon is from seven to 
eight miles in mean length, and about four miles in mean breadth. 
It contains upwards of thirty square miles. The figure of the pa- 
rish IS that of an irregular oblong. It is bounded on the west by 
he parishes of Udny, Tarves, and Methlick; on the north, by 
the parishes of Deer and New Deer ; on the east, by those of 
Cruden and Logie-Buchan ; and on the south, wholly by Loie- 
■BUchan. 

Topographical Jppearances.~The surface in general presents 
to the eye an undulating appearance, but rises in several places

ch altitude as to deserve the name of hills, the prospect is, ow-

it is navigable only by the smallest craft. And even were this 
basin of greater depth, the fragments of rock and large boulders 
which are to be found in the bed of the river where its channel 
becomes more contracted, must afford serious obstructions to the 
general purposes of navigation. Lime, coals, &amp;c. are, however, 
brought up in flat- bottomed boats, called lighters, to the meadow 
of Watertown, a landing place about a quarter of a mile below the 
village of Ellon. Were the Ellon property in the hands of a 
spirited and improving proprietor, there can be little doubt that 
the channel of the river would soon be cleared and deepened to 
such an extent as to make it available, at least as far up as the 
lighters now reach, for the general export and import of this part 
of the country. Two or three thousand pounds judiciously ex- 
pended would suffice to effect this important object, and would 
yield, it is confidently believed, a large and yearly increasing return. 
Before the introduction of stake-nets along the coast, the value of 
salmon caught in the Ythan was very considerable, the fishing hav- 
ing yielded an annual rent of several hundred pounds. The river 
fishing has dwindled now almost to nothing. Except for about 
two months in summer, the only attention paid to it is to look after 
the cruives. The Ythan, and the burns of Ebrie and Brony, 
which fall into it, are all capital trouting streams, containing sal- 
mon trout, common burn trout, and finnock in great abundance. 
Parties from Aberdeen often come out to this neighbourhood 
during the summer months, to enjoy a day or two in rod-fishing on 
the Ythannd its tributary streams. The Earl of Aberdeen is 
the present tacksman of the river fishings. 

The parish of Ellon is abundantly supplied with excellent spring 
water, but it contains no spring known to possess medicinal qua- 
lities.  

Geology and Mineralogij .—The rocks in this district of Scot- 
land are all of the primitive class, lying in the direction of east 
of north, and west of south, and dipping for the most part to the 
South-east. In the valley of Ythan, and throughout the adjacent 
more fertile districts of the parish, they consist of varieties of the 
gneiss species. A bed of granite occupies the central districts, 
and the strata in the north side along the boundary of the parishes 
of Ellon and Deer, approach nearly to a pure quartz. The soil, 
however, is mostly diluvial, resting generally in the more fertile 
parts on a deep bed of yellowish open gravel. In a few instances 
where the gneiss rises to the surface, the soil consists, of course,

period, the Bishop of Aberdeen also had lands of considerable ex- 
tent in this parish. 

Ellon appears to have been, from the most ancient period to 
which record extends, the head place of jurisdiction of the Earl- 
dom of Buchan. Among other proofs in evidence of this point, 
is a charter now in the possession of Captain Ferguson of Pitfour, 
granted before the year 1'206, by which Fergus Earl of Buchan, 
in conveying certain lands to John, the son of Uthred, takes him 
bound to yield, along with his other vassals, suit and presence 
thrice a year at the Earl's head court of Ellon. The court in 
question was held, according to primitive usage, in the open air. 
Its sessions took place on a slight eminence, rising up from the 
left bank of the Ythan, about eighty or ninety yards below the 
site of the bridge of Ellon. This eminence, now occupied by the 
stables and farm-yard of one of the principal inns of the village, 
bore anciently the name of the moot hill of Ellon, but was com 
monly called in later times " The Earl's hill." It is specially men- 
tioned in the charters of the Buchan family. Thus, in 1476, a 
seisin or livery of the earldom of Buchan was given unto James 
Earl of Buchan, super montem de Ellone, attestation by the 
sheriff of Aberdeen, 28th October 1476, afterwards called Earl's 
hill. James was succeeded by his eldest son Alexander, and 
Alexander by his son John. This John was seised in the Earldom 
of Buchan, and Earl's hill thereof, as nearest kin to his father 
Alexander, on the 4th day of August 1 547. The Earl's hill is 
included in a new charter of the Earldom, granted in 1574; and 
in 1615, Mary Douglas was infeft in the Earldom of Buchan and 
Earl's hill. The slight eminence or mound to which these char- 
ters and infeftments make reference, has now disappeared ; its site, 
as has been already observed, being otherwise occupied, but per- 
sons are still living in the village of Ellon who remember the time 
when the Earl's hill retained both its place and name. 

The tenure of the lands of Kenmuick, now called the lands of 
Ellon in this parish, may have some interest for the antiquary. 
There is attached to the proprietorship of these lands the herita- 
ble office of constable of Aberdeen. This office, which at one time 
was of considerable dignity and importance, is probably as old as 
the thirteenth century, when the Castle of Aberdeen would seem 
to have been built. The lands of Kenmuick or Ellon are now in 
the possession of the Honourable William Gordon, second son of 
the late Earl of Aberdeen ; but the name of the old family of

Parochial Registers. — Some of the parochial registers reach as 
far back as 1630, but we possess a regularly kept continuous se- 
ries of them only from 1711. They contain a record more or less 
full of the proceedings of the kirk-session, of the amount and dis- 
tribution of the funds from time to time available for the relief oi 
the poor, and of marriages and baptisms. From the negligence 
of parents, however, the register of baptisms is in most cases far 
from being complete. A well digested Legislative measure, en- 
forcing uptm parents attention to the duty of registration, appears 
to present the only effectual means of remedying the evil resulting 
from such negligence. A register of burials also has been kept 
by the gravedigger for the last thirty years ; but as this record re- 
spects only the numbers that have been interred in burying grounds 
within the parish, it can furnish but imperfect means of estimating 
the actual amount of mortality. 

Modern Buildings. — Ellon Castle, although, with the exception 
of the walls, it is now in a condition utterly ruinous, cannot be 
classed as an ancient building, the greater part of it having been 
erected about 1780, by the late Earl of Aberdeen, the father of 
the present proprietor. His Lordship made Ellon his principal 
place of residence, and at the time of his death, in 1801, left the 
castle, with the gardens and grounds, in a state of repair and order 
befitting the rank and wealth of their former occupant. At the 
period in question, a considerable extent of ground in the neigh- 
bourhood of the castle was occupied with thriving plantations ; and 
though the castle itself could have never had much to recommend 
it in an architectural point of view, yet, from the great capabilities of 
Its locality, it must have presented to the eye of the traveller, when 
these capabilities were set off to advantage, an agreeable and in- 
teresting object. The present proprietor, who resides abroad, and 
who has not for many years visited his property in this part of the 
country, has, for what reasons the writer is unable to say cut 
down the greater part of the wood, and suffered his patrimonial 
residence to fall mto a state of premature decay. 

There is a substantial mansion-house on the estate of Eslemont 
in which the proprietor, Mr Gordon of Hallhead, usually resides' 
It IS a plain building, standing on the right bank of the Ythan 
about a couple of miles above the village of Ellon, and surrounded 
Oy from fafty to sixty acres of plantations, tastefully disposed, and 
carefully trained.  '

nisiied by the register of baptisms and marriages, would the num- 
ber of inhabitants, though increasing upon the whole by a very 
slow ratio, seem to have undergone any considerable change for 
the half century immediately preceding. Of late years, however, 
as will be apparent from an inspection of the following returns, the 
increase of population has been much more rapid. 

Population according to returns made to Government : 
In 1801, . Males, 969 Females, 1053 Total, 2022 
1811, . 1078 1116 2194 

1821, . 1093 1057 2150 

1831, . 1157 1147 2304 

1841, . 2949 
Population according to a census taken by the minister of the parish 
In 1837, . Males, 1376 Females, 1429 Total, 2805 

It is believed, from the great pains taken in making up the re- 
turns last given, and from the substantial confirmation of their ac- 
curacy afforded by another census subsequently taken by the mi- 
nister, though with less care, that the results of the census of 1837, 
as stated above, may be entirely relied on. There may be some 
difficulty, however, in accounting, on satisfactory grounds, for the 
rapid increase of population which would thus appear to have 
taken place since 1831. Such increase, the writer conceives, may 
be ascribed, in part at least, to the three following causes, each 
of which has unquestionably operated, to some small extent, in 
adding to the amount of population. 1. Some additional houses 
have been built in the village of Ellon, and, as a single house in 
the village is frequently divided among several families, the increase 
of population arising from this cause may furnish no inconside- 
rable fraction of the amount to be accounted for ; — 2. In several 
districts of the parish, and particularly on those estates on which 
there was formerly a wide extent of waste land, cultivation has 
been extending itself for some years past by rapid strides. In va- 
rious instances new cottages have been erected, each having at- 
tached to it a piece of reclaimable ground, in the improvement of 
which the cottagers, with their families, are now busily engaged. 
Much has been done also in the reclaiming qf waste lands upon 
the larger farms, and an additional number of servants or day-la- 
bourers has been required in consequence; — 3. As agriculture has 
been, upon the whole, in an improving condition for the last six or 
eight years, and as, more particularly in this district, a powerful 
stimulus has been applied to it by the new facilities afforded by 
steam navigation for the transportation of fat cattle to the London 
market, the farmers have found it to be their interest, even in cases 
where there was no wasteland to be improved, to expend a greater 



908 AUEllDEENSHinE, 

amount of capital on their respective farms, and consequently to 
add to the number o their labourers. 

If the united operation of the causes above-ment.oned ,s deemed 
insuificient to account for the remarkable rise upon the popu at,on 
of this parish since 1831, the writer may be permitted to observe, 
that he is convinced, by experience, that an accurate census can- 
not be obtained, and that the returns made w,ll always fall below 
the truth, unless heads of families are required to specfy the 
names of their children and dependents. He has found m ,„nu- 
merable instances, that, in the gross return at first made to h,m, 
an omission had to be supplied, when the part, questioned was 
required to specif, the names of his family. From the circum- 
stance, then, that the names of the inhabitants were "ot required 
in the census ordered by Government, he is disposed to Ihink 
without imputing the slightest negligence to the highly qualified 
and most respectable gentleman who was employed to take the cen- 
sus of the parish of Ellon in 1831, that that census might have 
probably come short of the actual amount ot population. 
 Accoriing to the census of 18.37, the number of person in he 
parTsli, under fifteen years of age, is 986 ; the number of fam he. 
m unts, according to the same census, to 564, b, which, it we 
dWide 2805, .he gross population, we shall have withm a very 
triflino- fraction of 5 to a family. 

The people are, in general, exemplary in their morals, respec - 
ful and'courteous iu their behaviour, and assiduous in their a - 
tendance on religious ordinances. They are intelligent in no ordi- 
nary degre; and, although, iu regard to the religious, or rather 
eccleStica controversies now unhappily so prevalent, the, ma, 
rhTall established in the same mind, yet their good sense, 
o as itt hoXa much higher principle, leads them to express 
teir d llerenTes without animosity, and in a spirit of meekness.

12,000 are under cultivation. From a rough estimate it is pre- 
sumed, that, were sufficient encouragement afforded, an extent of 
about ."OO acres additional might be reclaimed, with a reasonable 
hope of its yielding ultimately a remunerating return. The great- 
est proportion of the land, however, which is still waste, seems, 
from its elevated situation, and from the absolute poverty of the 
soil, to be condemned to a state of perpetual sterility. 

Rent. — The gross rental is within a trifle of L. 10,000, being 
about seven and a half times the amount of rent paid at the date 
of the last Statistical Account in 1792. It must be observed, 
however, to prevent mistakes in a matter of so much statistical 
importance, that the augmentation of the rental, though un- 
doubtedly very great, is yet not quite so great as from the 
above statement it would appear to be. When the last Sta- 
tistical Account was drawn up, a considerable number of the 
farms were held on leases, for which, in addition to the annual 
rent, a premium, or, as it is usually termed, a grassum, had been 
paid at the period of entry. — Still, due allowance being made for 
the item of grassums, the rental at present cannot be less than four 
or five times its former amount. Two of the largest farms in the 
parish are still rented much under the full value, — the old leases 
by which they are held, and for which grassums were originally 
paid, having not yet expired. On the expiry of these leases, the 
gross rental will amount to upwards of L. 10,000. Some of the 
land in the immediate neighbourhood of the village is rented at 
the high rate of upwards of L.5 per Scotch acre ; but its actual 
annual value probably does not much exceed one-half of the rent 
which is now paid. It is farmed by the villagers in small parcels, 
less with a view to profit than pleasure and convenience. The 
average rent of land of the same quality, in more remote parts of 
the parish, is from L.2 to L.2, 10s. per acre. On the inferior 
soils, the rent per acre varies from 10s. to 15s. The average rent 
of arable land for the whole parish will be found, from the data 
already furnished, to be within a small fraction of 17s. per Scotch 
acre. 

Lwe-Stock.—Th.e breed of work-horses has of late years been 
much improved. Superior mares have in several instances been 
brought from Clydesdale and other parts of the west country, cele- 
brated for breeds of horses of good bone and action. Much has 
been done also for the improvement of the breed of horses by the 
spirited exertions of the Highland and Agricultural Society. The 



g\0 AlUiRDKENSHHlK. j 

horses chiefly sought after for agricultural purposes, are not those | 
of the largest size, but such as are of good mettle, and eas.ly kept | 

in good condition. , , 

Until of late years almost the onl, breeds of black-cattle known 
i„ this district of country «ere the Aberdeensh.re lo™ed and 
A„Kus polled breeds. But what is called the short-homed or Tees-, \ 
water breed is now prevailing to a considerable extent, and seems 
r piteofthe opposition which its introductton has encoun ed 
from various quariers, to be daily gaining ground. Opm.on, how- 
eve" is still divided between this recent imporlat.on and the ancent 
breeds of the country, and it is not for the writer to presume to 
det rmine which party has the right side of the questton. One 
Zl is matter of tact, and forces itself upon the at'™"-.-' ™ 
the lost ordinary observer, that our farmers nowbrmg the.rcat le 
0 a much greater weight than in former times, and recetve for 
hem a price proportionally more remunerating. Var.ous causes 
W contributed to bring about this result, one of wh.ch, and un 
d btedly not the least hnportant is, that much ™re a.ten to,, an 
skill are now applied not only to the feedmg off ot Ml-g"'" 
St ck, but also to the equally important departments of breed ng 
and of keeping the rising cattle in a thrivmg cond.t.on. Had the 
same attention been formerly given to these tmportant parts o he 
frmer-s occupation, there can be no doubt that cattle even ot the 

5 breeds of the country might have been brough to mndt 
rrea"e7weightthan what, under the less perfect node of manage- 
men heretofore adopted, they ever attained. St.ll, as tt seems to

the two breeds should be kept as distinct and pure as possible, 
and no intermixture allowed beyond a first cross. 

Sheep-farming is but little pursued in this district of country, 
and in the parish of Ellon is altogether unknown. 

Husbandry. — The rotation of cropping now generally followed 
is what is called the seven-shift course. According to this rota- 
tion, the distribution of crops stands thus. First year, green crop, 
chiefly turnips ; second year, oats or barley, generally the for- 
mer ; third, fourth, and fifth, years, pasture; hay is raised but 
in small quantities. Sixth and seventh years, oats ; in some rare 
instances, the seventh crop, or second crop after lea, is barley. 

The cultivation of barley, that is, speaking more accurately, of 
bear or big, — for the latter is the variety generally grown in this 
part of the country, — although extensive in coast-side districts, is 
much more limited in the inland parishes. Here, the farmers find 
upon the whole, that oats is their most profitable crop ; and it is, 
accordingly, to the cultivation of this species of grain that their at- 
tention is chiefly directed. About thirty years ago, the cultivation 
of wheat was introduced to some extent, but it was soon found, 
that unless in particularly favourable seasons, a wheat crop did not 
attain to maturity in our climate. A field of wheat on any of our 
farms would be now held to indicate a culpable disregard of the 
lessons of experience. Pease were formerly grown on some farms 
in this neighbourhood as a variety of green crop ; but, owing to 
the adoption of an improved system of agriculture, and particular- 
ly to the impetus given to turnip husbandry by the facilities which 
steam-navigation aff"ords to the farmer for exporting his fat cattle 
to the London market, the cultivation of this species of crop 
is now almost universally abandoned. From the great extent 
to which the cultivation of turnips has of late years been car- 
ried, and from the greatly enhanced value, in consequence of 
the circumstances already adverted to, of the turnip crop to 
the farmer, he is now seldom disposed to depend for its pro- 
duction, exclusively on the dung prepared on his farm. Hap- 
pily, the extra quantity of manure thus rendered necessary has 
been supplied by the important addition which has been recent- 
ly made in the article of bone-dust, to the various species of ma- 
nures formerly known. The quantity of bone-dust which, even 
in this immediate neighbourhood, is now applied every season as 
manure for land, is so great as almost to exceed belief. In addi- 
tion to the large quantities of the article in question imported into

in the same condition, which has been depastured only for two 
years. To the eye of a superficial observer, both crops may ap- 
pear to be equally luxuriant and equally rich ; but it will be found 
on a more careful examination, that the ears of the crop Vaisedon 
the land which has been but two seasons in pasture, are, particu- 
larly the lowest parts of them, much less perfectly filled than those 
of the other, and hence that the former crop consists, in a much 
larger proportion, of the light sort of grain usually denominated 
shillocks. This superior productiveness of land which has been 
for a greater length of time depastured, is now in part at least ge- 
nerally ascribed to the circumstance, that excrementitious matter 
is thrown off from the roots of plants during the period in which 
their seeds are advancing to maturity, and that such matter being 
of a nature unfavourable to the future production of the same 
species of plant, the length of time requisite for the resolution of 
this matter into its constituent elements, must be allowed to 
elapse before the same sort of crop can again be successfully cul- 
tivated. The theory on which this explanation proceeds is con- 
firmed by the fact, that land which has been exhausted by succes- 
sive crops, for example of oats, is still in a condition to yield a profit- 
able return of pease,— the excrementitious matter of the oat either 
serving as food for the latter species of crop, or at least subjecting it 
to no deleterious influence. Another reason, however, for the su- 
perior productiveness of land which has been for several years de- 
pastured, is to be found in the obvious circumstance, that on pas 
ture lands, the soil is not exhausted by the production of seeds. 
-How materially the circumstance now mentioned affects the point 
at issue-, must be well known to every practical farmer, inasmuch 
as the fact is confirmed by universal experience, that no crop what- 
ever draws more from the soil, or leaves it consequently in a more 
exhausted state than a crop of hay seed. Indeed, of so exhausting a 
character is a crop of this description, that the grass lands on which it 
IS raised lose considerably in their productive powers, notwithstand- 
ing the compensation made to them by the resolution into its con- 
stituent elements of such excrementitious matter of oat crops, &amp;c. 
as they might have previously contained. The superior produc- 
tiveness, therefore, as to crops of grain communicated to a field 
through Its having been kept for several years in a course of pas- 
ture, ,s to be accounted for, it is believed, chiefly on the ground 
■tna during this period of rest, while no seeds are produced by it

it imbibes and accumulates from tbe atmospbere tbe elementary 
matter whicb forms the principal ingredient in their composition. 
The rest enjoyed by pasture lands is, in a great measure, to be con- 
sidered then, father as tbe occasion than tbe cause of their im- 
proved fertility : the true cause of tbe improvement m ques- 
don being that, by the process of depasturing, the formation or at 
least the maturing of seeds is prevented, and time, there ore, allow- 
ed for the accumulation in the soil of their constituent elements 
A principal ingredient in tbe composition of seeds has been found 
by the experiments of Sir Humphrey Davy and others to be mtK,- 
gen, which substance, it has been further ascertained by Lieb g 
and his coadjutors, is communicated to the soil in sensible quan - 
ties, through tbe medium of rain water, snow, &amp;c. These aieevi- 
dently important facts, and seem to promise that the farmer wdl 
soon be able, by means of artificial manures, to infuse into the 
soil that peculiar virtue in respect of the filling and maturing of 
the ears of grain, of which in the meantime, the rest allowed by a 
,ourse of depasturing continued for several successive years is held 
to be, if not the efficient cause, at least the almost exclusive oc- 
casion. That the frequent stirring of the soil is not, 
-lated to exert an impoverishing influence, and hence that the su- 
perior productiveness of pasture lands when first broken up aft r a 
long period of rest, is not to be ascribed to the mere element of 
lestMn by itself, is demonstrated by the fact, V;- 
tive powers of soils are in every instance increased by subjecting 
: the process of summer fallowing. The --ased P

after three years' pasture, they take only one grain crop before 
fallowing. Such a shift, however, it is to be feared, cannot be ge- 
nerally adopted while rents continue at their present rate ; and be- 
sides, on strong clays and other similar soils, which are but ill 
adapted to pasture and turnip husbandry, it must involve, under 
anv circumstances whatever, an obvious loss. 

The crops in this district of country have been, for many years, 
as they still are, cut down by the scythe,— a method of reaping 
which is not only less expensive, but which, on other accounts 
also, is deemed preferable to the mode of cutting with the sickle, 
formerly employed. In the stack-yard, indeed, some loss is sus- 
tained from the exposure to the weather of a greater proportion 
of ears of grain in the stubble end of the sheaf, than when the 
sickle is used ; but this trifling loss is more than made up to the 
farmer by the important circumstances, that the process of mow- 
ing takes the crop more effectually off the field, and renders it fit 
also in a much shorter period of time for being safely transferred 
to the stack-yard.— Females are employed for gathering the mown 
corn mto sheaves, one to each scythe; and perhaps the greatest 
objection to this mode of reaping is, that when the crop is heavy 
It necessarily throws upon, the female labourer an undue proportion 
of the hardest work. Females are employed also in hoeino-, in barn 
• work, and in the other lighter kinds of agricultural laboun Such 
vork IS not, indeed, too hard for them ; but still it may be question- 
ed whether the female part of the population are not now engaged 
in out of door employments to an improper extent; as a constant 
application to such employments, even if it were not otherwise in- 
jurious, necessarily leaves them less time for improving themselves 
in matters of domestic economy, and consequently for undertaking 
the management of a family.  
ImprovemenU-In draining, in the reclaiming of waste land 
and in the adoption and steady prosecution of the most improved 
systems of husbandry, the farmers in this parish have displayed, 
with very few exceptions, much spirit and energy. I„ some in '

ing torward their more weighty improvements by the liberal co-

dusti-ious or enlightened tenantry ; and there are certainly few dis- 
tricts, in which the general style of agriculture exhibits a healthier 
or more improving aspect. The extensive importation of a larger 
and more profitable breed of black-cattle has already been noticed, 
and some idea has also been given of the value of bone-dust an- 
nually applied to the improvement of cultivation, and particular y 
of turnip husbandry. On many of the farms, more especially 
where the soil inclines to clay, there is, besides, a considerable an- 
nual expenditure for English lime. For some years, indeed, alter 
the introduction of bone-dust, lime was applied in smaller quanti- 
ties,-an idea having at first generally prevailed, that the necessity 
' of applying the latter article would be superseded by the effects ot 
the bone-dust. This idea, however, has proved to be erroneous; 
the disuse of lime having been followed by a marked deterioration 
of the pasture grasses. Accordingly, lime is again applied by our 
farmers in much the same quantity in which they applied it in for- 
mer times. c R A V, 

The chief obstacle to expensive improvements ot a hxed cha- 
racter is to be found in the faulty nature of the Scotch law of en- 
tail, which precludes the possibility of giving a sufficient guarantee 
to the farmer of remuneration at the end of his lease for such im- 
provements as he may have executed. Where the proprietor of 
an entailed estate is in comfortable circumstances, and has the 
prospect of being succeeded by a member of bis own family, the 
evil now adverted to may not be much felt; but where matters 
stand otherwise, it exerts an influence in regard to farm-stead- 
ings, enclosures, &amp;c. of the worst possible description. Un- 
fortunately a large extent of the land in this parish is in the hands 
ofan heir' of entail, whose circumstances and advanced years, as 
he has no heir of his own body, alike forbid the expenditure o£ 
his means in permanent improvements. While, therefore, the 
farms upon his estates which are held on leases of nineteen years, 
are in general well cultivated, his tenants obtaining from tune to 
time a Renewal of their leases, and finding it their interest, m con- 
equence, to keep the soil in good condition, httle is done eitljer 
the way of enclosing, or towards the improvement of their farm- 
steadTngs, for this obvious reason, that for such expenditure no re- 
Tuneratin can be secured to bern -Whatever vie ma,'

humbly submitted that it would be for the advantage of all parties 
to allow such a change to be made upon it as might do away with 
the evil now complained of, by rendering admissible under it an 
efficient guarantee for the repayment to a reasonable extent at least, 
by the proprietor in actual possession at the termination of a lease, 
of the sums vested by the tenant during the currency of that lease, 
in fixed and enduring improvements. — Another obstacle to im- 
provement, which, however, is more partial in its operation, as it re- 
spects only the northern districts of the parish, where the posses- 
sions are either crofts or farms of very limited extent, is the great 
expense that must be incurred in the digging of lines of leading 
ditches before the districts in question can be subjected to an ef- 
ficient system of drainage. It is obvious that the removal of this 
obstacle to improvement, if it is to be effected at all, must be ef- 
fected by the proprietors ; as it is not to be supposed that the oc- 
cupiers of the crofts and small farms alluded to can have either 
the skill or capital requisite for the execution of so extensive ope- 
rations. Were the proprietors of this district, however, to be at the 
expense of opening up leading ditches on a sufficiently exten- 
sive scale, and were they further to give some little encouragement 
for nuprovements in draining to their cottars and small farmers, 
there can be no question that they would reap, even at the expiry 
of the current leases, an ample remuneration for the expenditure 
incurred, and that such remuneration would be after all, but an 
earnest of the profits to be ultimately realized. Few districts pos- 
sess greater capabilities of improvement, and were these capabili- 
ties, by the execution of the works above spoken of, once fairly 
opened up to persons of industry and perseverance, such parties 
even though their capital might be but limited, would not require 
very many years to convert into good corn land what is now little 
better than a morass. The climate at the same time would share 
in the improvement, and advantages would hence result also to 
the adjoming districts. 

A farther, and indeed the greatest obstacle to agricultural im- 
provement, which affects the whole range of the science in all 
parts of the country, is the want of an experimental farm, placed 
under the superintendence of an individual who should combine 
with the skill of a practical farmer, extensive chemical attainments 
•ina particularly a thorough experimental knowledge of the vari- 
ous processes of the chemical laboratory. Agriculture hitherto has

scarcely deserved the name of a science, its rules having been al- 
most entirely empirical, and the experiments made m it havmg, 
with few exceptions, been superintended by persons mcapable ot 
keeping in view a scientific result. The recent publication of 
Liebig, however, announces the dawn of a better era, and esta- 
blishes a platform on which the science of chemistry may be con- 
fidently expected to render as important services to agriculture as 
it has already rendered to arts and manufactures. But it is ob- 
vious, that, for the carrying out of Liebig's principles,-that, tor 
the various processes of analysis requisite to the perfecting of his 
system,— and that for the originating and superintending of the ex- 
periments that may be necessary for testing the value of artificial 
manures, a knowledge of chemical science far beyond any attam- 
ments that can reasonably be expected on the part of even the 
most enlightened practical agriculturist, is an essential requisite 
Such a task evidently requires, too, the undivided attention ot 
the party undertaking it, and is, for this reason also, unfit to be 
committed to the care of an agriculturist who must live by his 
profession. Immediate profit is not the object that should be 
looked to. It is probable, indeed, that, leaving out of view other 
expenses, which, nevertheless, if a right establishment is set on 
foot, cannot but be considerable, the services of a properly quali- 
fied superintendent will alone involve a cost exceeding the annual 
value of the whole farm. But it surely cannot for a moment be 
supposed, that, when a reasonable prospect of benefits altogether 
incalculable is opened up to the agricultural interest, the expense 
of a few thousand pounds, should such a sum be found to be re- 
Quisite, will deter our landed aristocracy from carrymg through 
the experiments requisite for the realizing of such a prospect. 
Should but one experiment in twenty succeed, and the data fur- 
nished by Liebig entitles us to form a much more sanguine esti- 
mate, still, the advantages resulting to the agricultural interes 
would greatly outweigh the expense incurred. Indeed, with tl 
prospects now' opened up to them, our extensive Ian ed propr e 
lill be altogether wanting to their own interests, if, while almo 
Ivery large manufacturing establishment in the country engage , 
at a hish salary, the services of a practical chemist, they fail, 
tough the dread of a trifling expenditure to reahze the adj... 
tages which seem at length to be fairly within their re 
confidently hoped, however, that this subject will soon be taken i-l

by the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland, and that, 
under the auspices of a body which has already done so much to 
promote the best interests of the country, an experimental esta- 
blishment will be set on foot, calculated to carry into full opera- 
tion the enlightened views which have been recently thrown out, 
and thus to place agriculture on that elevated platform in the de- 
partment of the sciences, to which, from its vital importance, it is 
so justly entitled. 

The usual duration of leases is nineteen years. There are still 
two or three liferenters in the parish, and one of the old leases for 
the long term of fifty-seven years, or three nineteens, as it is called, 
has not yet expired. No farm, however, is now let for a longer 
period than nineteen years. 

The ferm-steadings, with the exception of some of those on the 
Ellon estates, are neat and substantial. Many of the farm-houses 
are slated, and those which have been recently erected are, gene- 
rally speaking, large and commodious. The steadings, where new- 
ly built, are slated or tiled, most commonly slated. Where they 
are of longer standing, they are for the most part covered with 
thatch or heather. Threshing-mills have been erected almost in 
every mstance m wbich the farm is of any considerable extent. 
Indeed, it would now be scarcely possible to procure servants will- 
ing to undertake what was wont to be denominated a heavy 
threshing. 

Produce.-¥i-om the great extent of inferior land in the parish, 
and from the enhanced expense of cultivation consequent both on 
this inferiority of the soil and on the exertions that have been 
made, of late years, to reclaim waste ground, the gross value of 
raw produce annually raised on an average of years, exceeds in 
a greater than ordinary ratio, the value of produce annually dis- 
posable. In forming an estimate, however, of what ought to be 

he gross amount of the rental of an estate or parish, it is only 
the value of the disposable part of the annual produce, whicl,: 
with propriety, can be taken into account. Nor can even this 

ement be held to bear an invariable ratio to the gross amount

pants of farms under L.50 of yearly rent, even although such oc- 
cupants should not be contributors to the funds. The Formartine 
Society is, on the whole, perhaps the most thriving agricultural 
Association in Aberdeenshire ; and the benefits resulting from it, 
particularly in bringing improvements in the department of breed- 
ing within the reach of all classes of the agricultural communi- 
ty, are universally felt and acknowledged. It has tended, in 
no mean degree, to impress on the whole stock reared in this dis- 
trict that highly improved character, which, by the most compe- 
tent judges, it is now admitted to possess. The efficacy of the 
Association has of late years been increased by the liberal patron- 
age of the Highland and Agricultural Society, part of whose 
funds have been applied in placing at the disposal of the asso- 
ciation additional premiums. In proof of the improvements ef- 
fected on the breed of the district by the Formartine Agricul- 
tural Association, it ought to be stated, that, among many other 
premiums awarded to parties connected with this body by the 
Highland and Agricultural Society, at their general exhibition of 
stock, held at Aberdeen in October 1840, one of the members, 
Mr Hay of Shethin, had adjudged to him the premium for the 
best ox of any breed. The same individual, it ought farther to be 
observed, was a successful competitor also at the last show of stock 
held at Smith field. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Markets, Means of Communication, c. — There is no regular 
market for provisions held in the village of Ellon, but, as we have 
generally one or two resident fleshers, fresh butcher-meat can be 
procured at all seasons, at least once a week. Fish also is abun- 
dantly supplied from the neighbouring villages of Collieston and 
Newburgh, the female part of the fishing population carrying them 
almost daily into all parts of the adjacent country. The other 
articles usually furnished by a provision market are seldom in de- 
mand, as most of the Ellon feuars either occupy as much land as 
enables them to keep a cow and some poultry, or obtain a ready 
supply of butter, eggs, &amp;c. from their nearest neighbours. There 
is a monthly market for black-cattle and grain, which, in the win- 
ter season, particularly, is well attended, the Aberdeen butchers 
drawing a considerable proportion of their supplies from this dis- 
trict, and the sales of grain shipped at Newburgh being chiefly ef- 
fected at Ellon. In addition to the monthly markets, there are 



922 



AliERDEENSIllRE. 



six aniuuil fairs, two of which are held in the viUagc, ami the re 
maining four on a piece of waste ground in the immediate neigh- 
bourhood. Some years ago, the Ellon fair, held at Marymas, 
was one of the most important in the country, and attended by 
cattle-dealers from the south of Scotland and England ; as at this 
market the principal surplus stock of the district was annually ex- 
posed for sale. The opening up of the London market, however," 
through the facilities afforded by steam navigation, has given to 
the cattle trade an entirely new direction, and rendered the busi- 
ness transacted at our country fairs confined, in great measure, to 
the interchange of stock among home dealers. Two of the fairs 
above-mentioned are held at the respective terms of Martinmas 
and Whitsunday, chiefly for the purpose of engaging servants. 
This system of hiring at markets has been much condemned ; but 
the evils attending it seem to have been exaggerated, as the 
experience of a few years is found to be sufficient to make the 
masters and servants of a particular district acquainted with each 
others characters, and qualified, therefore, to regulate with dis- 
crimination their mutual engagements. — In respect of means of 
communication, the situation of the parish of Ellon is particularly 
favourable. The village is accommodated with a post-office, 
—and on the turnpike road from Aberdeen to Peterhead and 
Fraserburgh, which passes through it, and lies for a distance 
of four miles within the parish, there is daily a double mail both 
from south and north. Runners also, either daily or on alternate 
days, atford a regular means of intercourse with Newburgh, Slains, 
New Deer, &amp;c. Besides the mail coaches, a stage-coach, which 
leaves Strichen and Old Deer on alternate mornings, passes 
through the village to Aberdeen on every lawful day, and returns 
the same evening. We have two regular carriers to Aberdeen, 
each of whom makes the journey to the county town twice a-week; 
and the bridge over the Ythan at Ellon, being as it were the key 
to the whole Buchan district, weekly communication, by means of 
carriers travelling to and from Aberdeen, may be had with every 
part of that district. Ellon is distant from Aberdeen sixteen miles, 
from Peterhead nearly eighteen, and from Newburgh, the nearest 
shipping-port, about five or five and a-half, with all which places 
it is connected by lines of turnpike road. During the last twenty 
or thirty years, great exertions have been made to improve the 
condition of the commutation roads, which were formerly mucli 



ELLON. 



923 



neglected. They are now, for the most part, in a state of good 
repair, and, in several instances, new lines have been opened up, 
by which the progress of improvement has been much facilitated. 
The road money is applied, in every case, with great judgment 
and economy ; and where the sunas allocated by the trustees are 
found to be insufficient for the execution of improvements seen to 
be necessary, the proprietors, much to their credit, have, in many 
cases, made temporary advances, without interest, of the amount 
required, from their own funds. Something, indeed, still remains 
to be done to put the commutation roads into such a state of im- 
provement as may bring out fully the resources of the parish ; but 
much has been already accomplished, and both proprietors and 
tenants are now animated by such a sense of the importance of 
the work as affords the best guarantee that it will not be left in an 
unfinished state. — The Aberdeen Bank, the Town and County 
Bank of Aberdeen, and the North of Scotland Bank, which also 
has its head office in Aberdeen, have each a branch in the village 
of Ellon. It is understood that a considerable amount of business is 
transacted at these branches, — a circumstance not to be wondered 
at when it is kept in mind, that the village constitutes the principal 
market place of an extensive district of rich country. — The parish 
is rich in the medical profession, there being three surgeons in the 
village, and a fourth in the immediate neighbourhood. There 
-are two merchant tailors in the village, each of whom gives regu- 
lar employment to a considerable number of workmen, two bakers, 
-and several general merchants for groceries, seeds, cloth, &amp;c. 
some of whom carry on a very extensive business. The number 
of persons who have licenses to sell spirits is greater than is desir- 
able. It must be remembered, however, that the well frequented 
roads which pass through the village, render houses of enter- 
tainment for different ranks of travellers, matter of absolute ne- 
cessity. 

Ecclesiastical State.~T\ie parish church, which is a very plain 
erection, quite in the usual style of Scotch country churches, was 
built m 1777. Although it can boast, however, of no archi- 
tectural beauty, it is a commodious and comfortable place of wor- 
ship, having undergone, about twelve or thirteen years ago, a 
thorough and substantial repair. It is seated for nearly 1200 per- 
sons, allowing to each sitter the legal admeasurement; but it can 
accommodate without much inconvenience a congregation consi.

derably larger, say from 1300 to 1400. In the autumn of 1839, 
it was tastefully lighted up with gas, by means of which improve- ■ 
ment the evening service can now be continued through the whole 
year.— The church, although it has its site where the population 
is most dense, does not occupy a central position, its distance from 
the southern boundary of the parish being at an average only about 
two miles, while its mean distance from the northern boundary 
cannot be less than from six to seven. The inconvenience thence 
arising to the section of the population inhabiting the northern dis- 
tricts of the parish was long severely felt by them ; and, as appears 
from the Presbytery records, attempts had been made, from time 
to time, to remedy the evil complained of, by the erection in their 
neighbourhood of an additional place of worship. What gave 
greater weight to this proposal, and rendered all parties more an- 
xious to have it carried into effect, was the circumstance, that the 
inhabitants of the adjoining districts of the parishes of Deer, New 
Deer, and Tarves were subjected to a like inconvenience, being 
equal'ly distant from their respective parish churches. According- 
ly when in 1884, prospects were held forth by the establishment of 
a Church Extension Committee, that the church was disposed to 
make a vigorous effort to provide for the growing spiritual desti- 
tution of the community, the proposal above alluded to, which had 
been kept in abeyance only by the want of the requisite means for 
carrying it into effect, was again taken up by the parties more im- 
mediately interested, with redoubled energy. Their efforts were at 
lencrth crowned with success, and by subscriptions raised in the des- 
titute districts, by collections made through almost all the parishes 
of the presbyteries of Deer and Ellon, and by liberal donations re- 
ceived from the heritors, together with a grant of L.140 made by 
the Church Extension Committee, sufficient funds were provided 
for erecting, on a convenient site, a neat and substantial church, ca- 
pabl f containing from 600 to 700 sitters. The new churc 
IZ opened for public worship in December 1834, and, though 
mean have not yet been obtained for the maintenance of an ordain- 
ed clergyman, the services of the sanctuary have ever since been 
egu larW adm nistered to a large and respectable congregatio .

Lord's Supper lias been annually dispensed in the new church, for 
the last four years, by authority of the Presbyteries of Deer and 
Ellon, and the number of persons who partook of the ordinance 
in 1840 was upwards of 500. The writer is not aware that the 
ordinary attendance at the original parish churches, though the 
number of communicants of course is not so great as formerly, has 
been sensibly diminished. — The sittings in the parish church, with 
the exception of the minister's pew, are exclusively in the hands 
of the heritors or their tenants. No sittings in the parish church 
are let. The sittings in the new church above spoken of are let 
annually at a rate varying from Is. Gd, to 4s. The seat rents, as 
the collections are applied exclusively for the relief of the poor, 
constitute the only fund available at the present time for defraying 
the expense of public ordinances. 

The manse of Ellon was repaired and enlarged by the addition 
of two public rooms, a bed closet, kitchen, and sleeping apart- 
ments for servants, in 1826. It is now probably, in point both 
of comfort and accommodation, one of the best manses in the 
country. Though but a little way removed from the village, yet 
an intervening screen of Huntingdon willows gives to the grounds 
withm the gate an appearance quite secluded and rural. The si- 
tuation, for this part of the country, may be considered beautiful 
It stands on a bank sloping to the Ythan, the intermediate ground 
between it and the river being laid out as garden. The offices also 
are sufficiently commodious and in good repair. 

Theglebe, inclusiveof the garden, mayextendto aboutsix Scotch 
acres. From Us proximity to the village, although the soil is not 
in general of first rate quality, it would probably yield an annual 
rent of from L. 18 to L. 20. The stipend, as modified in 1823 
amounts to sixteen chalders of grain, half barley half meal, pay 
Jble by the fiar prices of the county, with an allowance of L 10 
for communion elements. The barley is estimated by the Linlith- 
gow measure. The teinds-, which belong to the heritors, may 
amount on an average of years to the value of L.800 per annum

There is a neat Episcopalian place of worship in the neighbour- 
hood of the village, capable of accommodating a congregation of 
from 300 to 400. Many Episcopalians belonging to the neighbouring 
parishes attend public ordinances at Ellon. The United Secession 
and Independents have also each a place of worship m the village, 
but the Independent church has not enjoyed the services of a resi- 
dent clergyman for the last four or five years. The number of per- 
sons whot on an average of years, actually partake of the Lord's sup- 
per in the Established Church is about 1120 ; and, making an al- 
lowance for sickness, the infirmities of age, and other casualties, 
the total number of adults in full communion with the Church of 
Scotland will not fall much below 1200. 

Education.— There are two parochial schools in the parish, 
both of which, and particularly the principal one, which has its 
site in the village, and at which the attendance is more regular, 
are conducted according to the most improved system of educa- 
tion and with great ability and efficiency on the part of the teach- 
ers ' The parochial school in the village is generally attended by 
upwards of 100 pupils, and the numbers, though somewhat less m 
summer than during the winter months, are, on the whole, more 
steady and uniform than is usual in country schools. At the other 
narochial school, which is placed in the northern district of the pa- 
rish at a distance of about four miles from the village, the atten- 
dance is far less regular, the number of pupils varying from 
thirty to sixty, according to the season of the year What has beea 
termed the intellectual system of education has been adopted in 
both schools with such modifications of the plans usually followed, 
as the iudgment of the teachers, enlightened by a practical acquain- 
tance with the peculiar circumstances of a country school, have led 
them to approve. It is an object uniformly kept m view by the 
achers, to call into exercise on the part of their pupils the powe 
of reflection and judgment. A great proportion of that c a. 
of scholars in both schools, whose education was limited onlj a 
ew years ago to the elementary branches of reading, writmg, and 
thi f undamental rules of arithmetic, are now instructed, and, in man

cases, make great proficiency, in the liigher departments of En- 
ghsh grammar and geography. Indeed, an avidity for a knowledge 
of the subjects last mentioned seems to pervade all classes of the 
pupils ; and such knowledge is happily beginning in consequence 
to be more and more regarded by the public at large, as an es- 
sential element of even the most ordinary education. Besides 
geography, and English grammar, geometry, practical mathema- 
tics, Latin, and, in some instances, the elements of Greek and 
French, are taught in the parochial schools. Both the parochial 
teachers are well qualified to give lessons in all these branches ; 
but instruction in the higher departments last adverted to is sel- 
dom required, save in the original parish school. Religious in- 
struction is carefully attended to in both schools ; and Sabbath 
schools, for promoting the same object, are taught by each of the 
parochial schoolmasters for eight months of the year. The Sab- 
bath schools are well attended, and the improvement of the young 
in religious knowledge, and, it is hoped, in a just sense also of the 
infinite importance of Divine things, has been much advanced by 
them, Mr Lillie, as master of the original parish school, has 
a house and garden. He enjoys the maximum salary, and re- 
ceives, it is believed, from the Trustees of the Dick Bequest, 
the allowance awarded by them to their highest class of teachers' 
His school fees may amount to about L.40 per annum, and his 
gross yearly emoluments, therefore, will be upwards of L 100 
The second parochial schoolmaster has only the minimum salary' 
and, to make up even this allowance, the annual value of his ac- 
commodations requires to be taken into account. Though at 
the examination instituted by the Trustees of the Dick Bequest 
for entrant schoolmasters in the three counties entitled to the be' 
tiefit of their fund, he was found to be the first man of his year 
yet, as the limited numbers attending his school have an effect' 
m terms of the regulations adopted by that body, in reducing the' 
allowance to be awarded to him, his emoluments, from the same 
do not probably exceed an annual sum of L.30. His school fees 
may be estimated at L.20 additional, so that his gross income 
exclusive of the value of accommodations, will be somewhere 
aoout L.70 per annum. 

In addition to the two parochial schools, there are four schools

ford a reasonnble g-round of hope, that no individual of the rising 
generation is suffered to grow up altogether destitute of the 
merely elementary attainments of reading and writing. Still, the 
irregular attendance at school of the children of the poorer classes 
of society is much to be deplored, as it breaks their habits of at- 
tention, and interrupts that salutary course of moral and religious 
training in which, much more than in the superficial attainments 
above-mentioned, the value of a good education consists. 

But while the imperfect education of the poorer classes, arising 
from irregular attendance at school, &amp;c. cannot but prove prejudi- 
cial to their interests in after life, nor fail to exert, where its na- 
tural consequences are not averted, a pernicious influence on their 
religious and moral condition, it seems questionable, in taking a 
comprehensive view of the present state of society, whether the 
more complete education enjoyed by persons in less depressed cir- 
cumstances be attended with all the beneficial consequences that 
ought to result from it. That the cultivation of the intellectual 
powers of the human mind has attained, in respect of the great 
body of society, a higher degree of eminence than what it occu- 
pied at any former period of history, cannot be denied ; but it cer- 
tainly IS not to be inferred, from any data afforded by the existing 
state of things that society has undergone a corresponding im- 
provement in the higher departments of religion and morals On 
the contrary, the opinion is daily gaining ground, and seems to have 
a foundation in truth, that in these all-important respects, at least

recognition of those mysterious ties, which, through a common 
God and a common Saviour, bind in the bonds of an everlastino- 
brotherhood, man to his fellow man, he must have drunk deep at 
the fountain of that better lore which gives to the human soul its 
•highest dignity, and which fits it both for acting and for suffering, 
whatever may be the circumstances in which it is placed, in a 
manner worthy of its immortal destiny. Hence, that high moral 
and religious bearing, and that manly firmness and strength of cha- 
racter which distinguished both the burghers and peasantry of the 
olden time, are explicable on principles, which approve themselves 
to enlightened reason, as the soil on which such fruits might be 
expected to be matured. 

But now in modern education, the prominent qualities of which 
we have been speaking, and to which consequences so important 
have been traced, will, in many instances, be looked for in vain. 
With reference, indeed, to the elementary instruction of the pa- 
rochial school, we have not to complain, either that the Bible has 
become a sealed book, or that the Bible lesson is negligently 
taught. The Bible, on the contrary, is still a school-book; and 
justice to that most valuable body of men, the parochial school- 
masters of Scotland, renders it our imperative duty to state, that 
with no exception of which we are aware, due pains is bestowed 
by them, at the daily reading of the Scriptural lesson, in impres- 
sing upon their pupils the instructions which it conveys. But as 
the B.ble IS now but one of many school-books, and as the time 
that can be allotted for the reading of the scrip'tural 1 s n is ne 
cessarily hmited it becomes a most important subject of inquiry 
whether the other treatises usually studied at school harmonize 
w. h the principles of Divine truth. And, for the establishment of

of the teacher, rehgious impressions of a permanent character 
cannot be expected to be stamped upon their minds; and hence, 
when their attendance at school has terminated, they will have to 
launch forth upon the troubled stream of active life with no fixed 
principle to guide their course. 

It may be true that, even when the Scriptures were almost the 
only school-book in use, the principles of many on the termination 
of their school career had yet to be fixed; but admitting this assump- 
tion to be well founded, still the circumstances in which the youth 
of a former age were subsequently placed, were infinitely more fa- 
vourable than are those furnished by the present state of society 
for deepening and confirming the religious impressions of early 
years. It has been already stated, that the Scriptures, at the pe- 
riod referred to, were not merely the only school-book, but formed 
also, in conjunction with treatises of kindred character, at least to 
the great body of the people, the chief subject of the study of 
mature life. On the magnitude and importance of the change 
which, m respect of the circumstance last "mentioned, society, as 
now constituted, presents, it would be a mere waste of time to 
offer many observations. The fact is notorious, that the country 
IS deluged with publications, some of which are conceived in a 
spirit of positive hostility to the principles of religion, and of which 
others again, though not directly of an irreligious character, are 
yet calculated, either to call off our attention from Divine things 
or insidiously to substitute views of our present condition and fu- 
ture destinies, inconsistent with the views maintained on such sub- 
jects in the volume of inspired truth. Nor is it matter of less no- 
tonety, that the publications in question, which are written, for 
the most part, in a style peculiarly captivating, attract a large 
share of public attention, and particularly from that class of the 
community whose youth and inexperience render them in an es- 
-pecial degree susceptible of new impressions.-Another element 
Which, in modern times, is highly favourable to the growth of a 
sensuous philosophy, and noxious, therefore, in a like degree, to the 
best interests of religion, is to be found in the unceasing turmoil 
and bustle necessarily attendant on the greatly extended range of 
our co„,„ 1 „,„,f,,turing interests. The many fluctua-

seminaries constituted on such a principle of exclusion, which hap- 
pily, however, are not yet to be found in this part of the empire, it 
may be sufficient to remark, that, as the basis on which they are 
established affords the surest indication of the actual prevalence 
of the evils which it is the proper business of education to coun- 
teract and extirpate, so the only result that can be reasonably an- 
ticipated from them is the farther development of such evils in 
an aggravated form. 

But, omitting all notice of seminaries, of a constitution so ut- 
terly preposterous, there is reason to apprehend, as has been al- 
ready hinted, that in schools of a better character, and even in 
our parochial schools themselves, religious instruction is not inter- 
woven in such a manner with the whole business of education, as 
an enlightened regard to the establishment and confirmation of 
sound principles of religion in the minds of the pupils seems ob- 
viously to require. It is believed, that in all our schools, without 
exception, the course of instruction pursued, is, in respect of this 
important matter, disjointed and fragmentary. Religion, indeed, 
in the schools more immediately under notice, is not an excluded 
branch of knowledge, nor in such schools is the place assigned to 
religious mstruction, strictly so called, that is, to the exposition of 
the daily scriptural lesson, less prominent than, from the multifa- 
rious subjects to which a parochial schoolmaster must give his at- 
tention, it might be expected to be. The true ground of complaint 
IS, that It occupies, amidst the general business of the day, an iso- 
lated position ; that it blends not its sacred truths with the system 
of education considered as a whole ; in short, that there is not 
stamped upon the entire course of instruction followed the genu- 
ine impress of a religious character. The remark, that reliaion 
holds, in modern systems of education, an isolated place, is to be 
taken, of course, with greater or less latitude, according to circum- 
stances. Perhaps few school-books are to be met with, in which 
there may not be found occasional pieces, conceived in a scriptu 
ral spirit, and calculated to impress the reader with sound views 
of scnptura truth. But it is believed that the number of such 
works IS still more limited, in the compilation or composition of 
■which, particularly with regard to those of them intended for 
the use of more advanced pupils, the hand of an enlightened 
Christian philosophy has been steadily at work, in culling from the 
faelds of science, history, literature, &amp;c. such views of God, of na 
ture, and of our common humanity, as, breathing the genuine spi 



936 AliERDKENSHlIlE. 

rit of revealed Irutb, might build up, in harmonious combination 
with intellectual excellence, the living temple of a moral and reli- _ 
Tious, and therefore truly noble and manly, character. The de- 
scriptions of processes of art and manufacture, the superficial state- 
ments of the naked results of scientific inquiry, and the many 
other articles of a like flimsy and purely mechanical character, 
with which our school-books now abound, would seem to have 
been drawn up almost for the express purpose of commumcatmg 
that smattering of knowledge which is ever the ready minister of 
pvide and vain-glory. We would not, indeed, have the knowledge 
which these articles convey left untaught, but we would have i 
taught in such a manner, as, by connecting it with the well-head 
or fountain whence it originally sprung,-with the many years of 
patient and persevering toil of which it was the reward,-and with 
the views which it unfolds, alike of creative wisdom and goodness, 
and of a constantly superintending and sustaining Providence,- 
should impress the mind of the pupil with a deep sense of his own 
ignorance and nothingness, and lead him to discern both in the 
constitution of nature itself, and in the discoveries of that consti- 
tution vouchsafed to man, the gracious interpositions of an ever- 
present Deity. How often, again, are the short historical and 
biographical articles, which appear in our school-books, of a cha- 
racter as remote as possible from harmonizing with the spin and 
principles of Divine truth, and how powerfully must they tend, 
therefore, in the case of the young, to weaken the force of rehgi- 
ous impressions, and to give to the inexperienced mind the direc- 
tion and bent of a practical infidelity  Yet the events of history 
are many, and strikingly impressive, from which, without incurring 
any danger of judging presumptuously of the workings of Provi- 
dence inumai affairs, a master mind in 1 terature, which should 
be also thoroughly imbued with the sound principles of a living 
Christian philosophy, might extract l-ons for the young of the 
hiahest practical rehgious importance; and the alogether pre- 
eminent services, which, under the like auspices, might be render- 
ed to the cause of education, by the still more productive field 
of b ography, must forcibly present themselves to every re-

with the humility characteristic of an ardent piety, and with the 
inflexible devotedness of the faith which worketh by love  Who 
shall estimate the happy effects that might result to the youthful 
mind, were it, through the instrumentality of Christian genius, to 
be made conversant from its earliest years with examples so ad- 
mirably calculated by their nature, beauty, and excellence, both 
to arrest its attention, and to form its character  It is easv to see, 
also, how poetry, and its sister art of music, for the employment of 
which in the work of education we have the authoritative example 
of God himself, might be brought to blend in entire harmony with 
the elements above-mentioned, in moulding, according to the 
Scriptural pattern, the dispositions and principles of the rising ge- 
neration. These departments have heretofore been all but ne- 
glected ; and hence are we supplied with another cause of the in- 
adequate moral and religious tendencies of the system of educa- 
tion now in use. 

If, then, our educational institutions are thus imperfect, in re- 
spect of the highest objects which the education of responsible be 
mgs ought to contemplate, while, at the same time, the corrupting 
influences to which, on leaving school, the minds of the youno- are 
exposed, have been greatly increased, both in number and inten- 
sity, we shall cease to wonder that society presents an unsettled 
and disjomted appearance, and that its prospects are becoming 
daily of a more gloomy and alarming character. For the evils 
under which we labour, and for the still greater evils with which

due also to the General Assembly to state, that it has displayed 
of late years a most praiseworthy zeal in increasing the means of 
education in districts heretofore inadequately supplied with them. 
But an effective superintendence of the education of a country 
implies, not merely a periodical inspection of its schools, or, as cir-

but a regard also to the perfecting of the instruction which it is 
their object to communicate. It is here that our national Church

tractive and popular forms ; the periodical and daily press also has 
opened up to all classes of the community an extended acquaint- 
ance with arts, manufactures, commerce, &amp;c., and involved them, 
moreover, in intricate discussions regarding the principles of go- 
vernment, and other subjects of a like abstract character, while 
yet comparatively nothing has been done by the Church to 
impregnate, through the medium of education, the new truths 
thus brought to bear on society with a religious spirit and ten- 
dency. That it is the imperative duty of our National Church to 
take care, not only that the interests of religion be protected from 
aggression, but also that the whole progress of society be render 
ed subservient to the advancement of those interests, cannot for a 
moment be disputed. Would the General Assembly once take 
up the subject with a spirit of earnestness and determination com- 
mensurate to its infinite importance,-would they unfold to 
the people of Scotland, in an affectionate pastoral address, a clear 
and comprehensive idea of an education adapted to the present 
advanced state of secular knowledge, which, by imbuing every 
department of that knowledge with the genuine spirit of a livini 
Christianity, should thus render it in the highest degree instru- 
mental in evolving and perfecting, both for the business of time 
and the enjoyments of eternity, the whole powers and capacities 
of man's intellectual, moral, and spiritual being ;-it C be 
safely predicted that, for the accomplishment ofo truly gPe'l 
and glorious a work, there would forthwith be supplied, with m

constrained t6 yield to the irresistible force of Divine truth ; in 
the light of this truth, prejudice, ashamed, would hide its head; 
and thus religious education, having its intrinsic worth once clear- 
ly revealed to the public eye, would go forth with the prayers o 
a united church, and with the rich blessing of the God of all 
grace, conquering and to conquer. „ o • • .i 

Friendly Societies.-Thve are three Friendly Societies in the 
parish,-in some respects variously constituted, but having, as their 
general object, the payment of small annuities to the widows of 
deceased members, and of a limited allowance 'f'' 
to members whose circumstances require such aid. Two of these 
societies also make a small allowance for defraying the funeral ex- 
penses of deceased members. The average aniiual disbursement 
of all the three, for the years 1838, 1839, and 1840, amounted to 
upwards of L.84. These Societies appear to be well conducted, 
and they have proved in many cases, eminently serviceable to the 

poorer classes of the community. r u nf Parli-i 

Savings Bank.- A savings bank, m terms of the acts of Parlia- 
„.ent regulating such institutions, was established here m Novem- 
ber 1839. The operations of the bank extend to several of the 
ad oining parishes; as the village of Ellon, from its central situa- 
tbn, is L'nd to be a convenient place for the transaction of busi- 
„ess'. The sums deposited in the ank fro- th a , , U 
alone amounted, in May 1840, to nearly L.UOO. ihe amount 
"wU f-\he comrnencement of the institution 
to the same date, was something less tl-" L I 60 The san g 
bank promises to answer well the purposes of its institution. Many 
ndtiduals of the working classes have -ds.sj 
siderable amount; and the circumstance, that all sums, howeve 
small, are receivable, evidently tends to foster among them habits 
of foresight and economy. u f An npr.

the winter season, a considerable number of occasional paupers 
who require temporary supplies from the kirk-session. In the se- 
vere winters of 1838 and 1839, when day-labourers were thrown 
out of work for many weeks, a serious inroad was made on the per- 
manent funds of the session, the expenditure having for each of 
these years exceeded the income by about L.50. 

The ordinary collections made in the church throughout the 
year average nearly L.90, which, with an extraordinary collection 
made annually for the pauper lunatic fund, will make the whole 
sum collected for the poor, in the course of twelvemonths, amount 
to about L.95. The permanent funds belonging to the kirk-ses- 
sion are upwards of L.300 ; but the amount cannot be stated with 
perfect accuracy, from the circumstance that part of them was long 
ago vested in house property in Aberdeen, which is of uncertain 
value. The annual return from the permanent funds, inclusive of 
a mortgage of L.20 Scots' on a small field adjoining the village, 
may be stated at from L.14 to L.15 ; thus making the amount of 
the whole sum annually available for the relief of the poor, and 
for the payment of the session clerk's and kirk officer's fees, about 
L/. 1 1 0. 

In 1838, on account of the peculiar severity of the season, small 
donations were received from most of the heritors in aid of the 
funds of the kirk-session, amounting in all to L.25; but in this 
part of the country such Contributions have seldom been had re- 
course to, except at periods of more than ordinary difficulty. 
There can be no question, however, that, even in country parishes, 
the difficulty of making asuitable provision for the wants of the poor 

.nd """ r''' P'dly increasing 

and that the period is not far distant when the subject of pauperism 
must force Itself more prominently on public attention. Indeed, in 
the case of large towns, this period appears to have already arrived. 
A hope however, m«y be entertained, that, with the fatal example 
ot the large manufacturing towns before them, the heritors of 
country parishes will be roused to provide effectual means f: 
the moral and religious education of every child that may be 
1'' states, and to see also that the mean, t 



provided be diligently and faithfully applied to Teb eetTne 
The writer has no wish that heritors should assess themselves ii

been deeply impressed with the opinion, that they might do incal- 
culable good, at a cost altogether trifling, by assistmg the poor a- 
bourer in the education of his family, and by givmg it to be d.s- 
tinctly understood, that any of their dependents who should ne- 
gleet to have his children instructed, the means of education being 
lithin his reach, must incur, by such neglect, the.r senous d.s- 
pleasure. Were the education of the families of their dependents 
to be thus attended to by the higher classes of society,-were .t 
Ide known over an estate, for example that while the proprie- 
tor would willingly give assistance to all that should be ascertamed 
to sLd in need of it, he would positively expect that the children 
of every family resident upon his domain should receive the bene- 
fit of a thorough grounding in at least the elementary branches of 
education, and, more particularly, in the fundamental doctrines 
and precepts of our holy religion ;-and were he to direct h.s te- 
nantry to keep a watchful eye, in regard to this al important mat- 
ter over their hinds and cottars, that man is but little acquainted 
with the state of society in our country parishes, or rather with the 
genuine feelings of our common humanity, who could hesitate to 
anticipate, that, by the blessing of God upon such an order of 
things, it would be attended with consequences of the most benefi- 
cial character. If pauperism is to be traced in too many instances to 
the early formation of idle and dissipated habits, we may hold it to 
be impossible, on the broad principles of a well-ascertamed experi- 
ence, that such an order and discipline as that to which- we have 
adverted, should not exert the most salutary influence in repelling 
the inroads of this formidable evil.

PRESBYTERY OF ALFOllD, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER LOW, A.M. &amp; F.A.S., MINISTER. 



I — Topography anb Natural History. 
Boundaries, Sfc— Keig occupies the north-east portion of the 
valley of Alford, here shut in by part of the Benachie range on the 
north, and the Menaway hills on the east, closing in upon the 
river Don, which intersects the parish. It is bounded on the north 
by the parishes of Leslie and Premnay, partly along the southern 
slope, and partly along the ridge of the hills ; on the east, by Oyne, 
down the south side of Benachie to the Don, and by Monymusk 
up the north end, and along the lap and lower ridge of Menaway 
leaving its summit about half a mile to the east; on the south it 
is bounded by Tough; on the west, by Alford as far as the Don 
and then by Tullynessle, until it joins Leslie at the north-west 
angle. The form, though irregular, is compact, the inhabited 
part extendmg from the church in all directions, from U to 
2i miles, the length from north to south being about 5 miles 
the breadth at the north end 4, near the middle where the Don 
crosses it not quite U, and at the south end 2i The contents 
are 7900 imperial acres, or about 12.344 square miles. 

Topographical Appearances. —The most remarkable mountain 
ranges lying partly in Keig are those of Benachie and Menaway 
both composed of granite. The eastern extremity of the formed 
IS a rocky peak, in the parish of Oyne, called the Mothertop from 
whicn the mountain, extending west about five miles, connects with 
a chain of a different formation, which, under several names 
reaches nine or ten miles farther in the same direction, terminat- 
ing in Auchindoir. The Mothertop is, according to Robertson's 
n:ap of Aberdeenshire, 1677 feet above the leveUf the sea, and 

tions by Mr Low. P"''' 'S ' " additions and corree-

considering its moderate herglit, commands a most extensive view 
of no ordinary kind, on the one band, of the high lands of Aber- 
deenshire, and on the other of a very large plain extendmg to the 
German Ocean and Moray Frith, composed chiefly of the districts 
of Garioch, Formartine, and Bucban. It is worthy of notice also, 
that Benachie with its craggy peaks is, from many points, a high- 
ly striking and picturesque object. Menaway with its range ex- 
tends nearly four miles south from the Don, to where a hollow, at 
Tillyfourie, through which the turnpike road to Aberdeen runs, 
partially separates it from Corenny and the range dividing the val- 
leys of the Dee and Don. Its summit, which is round, is in Mo- 
nymusk, and, according to Robertson, 1430 feet in height. 

There is a considerable extent of cultivated land up the slopes 
of the hills, to a height of perhaps 700 feet above the sea. Ihe 
central part of the parish is tolerably flat, and probably at a height 
of from 420 to 440 feet. Along the Don there is some haugh 
land on a still lower level, perhaps only elevated from 350 to 400 
feet, the bed of the river where it enters Keig being 380 at the 
bridge near the centre 360, and where it quits it, 340 feet above 

Clate &amp;-C— The climate is healthy, and the diseases of Keig 
generally considered, do not differ from those of any other coun- 
try parish in the north of Scotland. Perhaps, however, the fol; 
lowing circumstances connected with this "bject deserve a notice 
In th Edinburgh Medical Journal for July 1826, Dr Alexand r 
Murray has giv'en a short account of five individuals belonging to 
Keig, related to one another, all being boys, and four of them 
brothers, who were all attacked by bleedings from the mouth nose, 
s Ip, a d bowels, from the effects of which all died except one 
" There are upon record," says Dr Murray, " a few instance f 

a similar complaint attacking relatives, -\{;Y\T 1Z 
Germany and\merica." In the Edinburgh Medical Jou. 
April 1830, Dr Murray has also noticed an unusual kind of scar 

nion," he says, "which an observer on the spot P 
adopted." 



KEIG.

Hydrography. — The Don is the only river : it rises about six 
miles above CorgarfF, in the parish of Strathdon, and after a course 
of sixty-one miles, falls into the sea near Old Aberdeen. Its ave- 
rage summer breadth, where, in a singularly winding manner, it 
intersects Keig, is about 140 feet, and where its depth is fifteen 
inches, its velocity is about 90 feet per minute, thus discharging 
in that time 15,750 cubic feet of water. In the flood of August 
1829, it rose four inches higher than in that of 1778, and did 
much damage, but the injurious effects of it are now nearly obli- 
terated. 

Geology. — There are not many parts in Keig where the rock is 
laid bare so as to furnish an easy opportunity of ascertaining its na- 
ture, but wherever it is to be seen, granite prevails, mixed in a few 
places with gneiss, greenstone, and clay-slate. Some masses of por- 
phyry are found, and, among the simple minerals, tolerable speci- 
mens of rock crystal. A great deal of micaceous schist is scattered 
abou t on the surface of the ground, even on the tops of some of the 
granite hills; but the writer has seen none of it in situ within the 
bounds of the parish. 

With the exception of the haugh land, which is alluvial, lying 
over water-worn stones and gravel, the soil of Keig is gene- 
rally sandy or gravelly, combined with clay, which in a few places 
IS stiff and yellow, and in some poor low wet tracts is light and of 
a bluish-white colour, the whole probably referable to granite in 
different states of decomposition. Pure clay is found in a very 
few places. In the best lands, tillage has produced an abundant 
mixture of good mould, but in the poorest, there is little but the 
original moorish surface soil, a thin stratum of which covers near- 
ly all the uncultivated ground. Peat moss is confined to a few 
spots J it is very impure, and makes bad fuel. 
 Botany—The botany is, in general, similar to that of the neigh- 
bouring parishes. The following few species deserve a notice, 
being among the rarer Scottish plants : Juncus obtusijlorus, Epi~ 
lobium angustifolium, Pyrola rotundifolia, Ruhus suberectus, Fu- 
mana damculata, Genista Anglica, and a remarkable Hieracium 
with spotted leaves, upon very hairy footstalks.

On Lord Forbes's estates in Keig, there are 2200 imperial acres 
of wood, of which 378 are natural ; on the estate of Balgowan 75. 
The natural wood is of the trees above-mentioned ; the planted is 
as follows: British and sessile fruited oak, ash, white and black 
poplar, aspen, birch, weeping-birch, service, beech, copper beech, 
laburnum, elm, lime, plane, cork, horse-chestnut, maple, silver fir, 
Weymouth pine, spruce, larch, and Scotch fir; six-tenths o the 
whole being Scotch fir, and three-tenths larch, from ten to forty 
years old, the former thriving best on the lower ground, where to- 
lerabW dry, and the latter on the hills. 

It may be deemed worthy of remark, that the very common 
plants, corn-marigold, corn-poppy, and corncockle, are not to be 
found in Keig or its neighbourhood, and that ragwort, rare here 
some years ago, has now become a serious evil in grass lands. 

II._CiviL History. 
Land-owners.-The land-owners are, Lord Forbes; the Hon. 
the Master of Forbes; Sir Andrew eitHay of Ramies ; the 
Roman Catholic Church in Scotland ; and P. Farquharson, Esq. 

of Whitehouse. , . , 

Parochial Registers.- AW the early records were accidentally 
burned, excepting a part commencing in 1740, and ending in 
1743, preserved and copied into the present books. The hr 
regular entry is dated May 20, 1753; the registers of baptisms 
and rnlrriagls appear to have been correctly kept, but no notice has 

Vippn taken of deaths. , . i • i 

' r4»«--Tl.ere are man, Druidical circles™ the „e,g 
bourhood, and two in the parish. One of them, in a wood on the 
C„thiemuirh.ll, within the grounds, and about half a mde north o 
S tie Forbes, seems originally to have consisted of eleven upnght 
Sones mostly about seven feet high, and except two on the south 
s de piaTed 15 teet apart, forming a circle of 25 yards ,n d,a„  
,7 The two towards the south are somewhat pyramidal, about 
T JllTalet wide, and 20 inches thick at the base au 
01 5 fe°et asunder, the space between them bem "ccup d y 
a horizontal subcylindrical mass of stone upwards of 5 feet

meter, and 13 feet in length, lying on the west side of the circle. 
Of these upright stones the two principal ones last mentioned, 
and three of the others, remain standing, — two are lying on the 
ground, and the other four are broken. In the middle of the cir- 
cle is a quantity of loose stones, and near the centre a slab of 4 
or 5 feet square, covering a small pit open on the south side. 
The other circle, which is' more imperfect, is situated in a belt 
of wood, a quarter of a mile north-west of the farm-steading of 
Old Keig. It is about 66 feet in diameter, and in the cir- 
cumference of the circle there are two upright stones, 9 feet 
above ground, with an immense stone lying between them about 
16 feet long, 6 feet high, and 5 broad at one end, and differ- 
ing from the other in being flat on the top, of a quadrangular 
form, and placed on the south side of the circle. This could be 
no rocking-stone, and has evidently been used as a stone of sacri- 
fice, there being now no altar stone in the centre of the circle, if 
It had ever been. These rude circles were places of worship, and 
generally of the circular form, because jt was an emblem of eter- 
nity. They were either erected on eminences, that the Druids 
might see the heavenly bodies, or in groves, because it was deem- 
ed unlawful to build temples to the gods, or to worship them with- 
m walls or under roofs. The rude upright stones by which they 
were formed were representations of Celtic deities,t and particu- 
larly the square stone, which implies solidity, stability, and the 
-power of God-i As these rude obelisks were the first description 
of images in the world,§ they were worshipped by the Druids, 
and appropriately enough formed a part of the temple in their ido- 
atrous system. The large stone, 3 feet diameter, and 13 feet 
long which hes between two of these upright stones in the circle 
on the Cothiemuir hill, resembles much the rocking-stone, being 
now inverted, with its base uppermost, which was so rounded that 
It might move in a groove, and differs in its nature from the stones 
oi that locality. These rocking-stones, which were the wonder of 
the ancient world, were made to move by a protuberance of a cir- 
cular form on the under surface, which moved in a socket, and was 
poised m such a way as to vibrate by a touch of the hand, and yet

could not be moved by the greatest force. They appear to have 
been employed by the Druids, who were the judges in criminal as 
in other cases, to test the innocence or guilt of those who were 
accused of theft, robbery, or any other crime, and were so manag- 
ed that they appear to move obsequious by the gentlest touch of 
him whose life was innocent, but to the criminal's or the giant's 
arm they were immovable. This appears, however, to have been 
a Druidical temple, from the slab resting on the top of the cairn 
in the centre of the circle, and seems to have been dedicated to 
Carneus, one of the Druidical names for Apollo. 

The Druids began their religious worship by going three times 
round the cairn or temple, according to the course of the sun ; a 
ceremony which was known by the name of the Deas-iul, or 
brought their left hand to their mouth in adoration, and turned 
round their whole body§ in the direction of the right hand thrice, 
because this number was sacred among the ancients, embracing the 
beginning, middle, and end, and comprehended the most profound 
mysteries of the Divine philosophy. H They had several great so- 
lemnities, and one half-yearly, at the court of the Corfi or Arch- 
druid, at which all the sacred orders, or a deputation of them, 
made their appearance ; and this meeting, as well as the great an- 
nual festival, held in honour of Beal, at the sixth of the new 
moon, on the 1st of May, the beginning of their year, for they 
began both their month and year, not from the change, but the 
sixth day of the moon,1I was celebrated by great sacrifices, and re- 
ligious observances. Upon this occasion, one of their number, 
who wore a crown of laurel upon his head, clothed in white, pro- 
ceeded to cut the misletoe of the oak, when the celebration of the 
auspicious day with sacrifices and feasting commenced.ff The del- 
phicas, tripod, or slab was loaded with rich offerings of every kind, 
presented by those who came to worship, or to know the will ot 
the immortal gods concerning them ; heaps of spoils taken in 
war were dedicated to the guardians of the field of battle, the

Jares of Ognisus were appeased by offerings cast into the midst of 
the sacred fire, and the altars loaded with the gifts of pious men; 
and when the Druids had any extraordinary favour to ask of the 
gods, they offered up more than one human victim, and sometimes 
a hecatomb, or a hundred living creatures.f The Druids reckon- 
ed the sacrifice of a man the most meritorious act of their religion ; 
and the human victims, which were taken not only from criminals 
and captives, but also from among the innocent, were enclosed on 
such occasions into a frame of immense size,t and while the Arch- 
druid or priest placed his hand upon the head of the victim trem- 
bling before the altar, and offered up prayers to the various Celtic 
deities, the blind votaries of the heathen were lying prostrate be- 
fore linages, the workmanship of their own hands. The image 
enclosing the unhappy human victims was then set on fire, and 
they were consumed cruelly to ashes, in the presence of the peo- 
ple, amidst the solemn notes of various musical instruments, which 
resounded through the sacred grove to drown the cries of the dy- 
ing men.§ Others were slain with one stroke of the sword above the 
diaphragm, so that by observing the posture in which they fell, the 
different convulsions, and the direction in which the blood flowed 
from the body, they might interpret the will of the gods, or foretel 
future events. 11 

• On the top of a partly detached hill in the north -west part of 
the parish, is a circular enclosure of loose stones, apparently the 
ruins of a rude wall; it is called the Barmekin, and is about 70 
or 80 yards in diameter, with a heap of stones near its centre. 
Ihere is no satisfactory tradition connected with it. Many flint 
arrow and spear heads of various forms are occasionally found, 
principally on Benachie. 

Manswn.houses.~The only remarkable mansion-bouse is Cas- 
tie hovhes, the seat of Lord Forbes, chief of that ancient family, 
d spacious, elegant, and most commodious modern edifice, in the 
castellated style. It stands on the left bank of the Don, on the 
Slope of the south-west corner of Benachie, at the termination of 
Th n I commanding a view of great extent and beauty.

the grounds; farther on the bridge of Keig a single arch of 101

feet span, has a fine effect. In the middle ground the whole vale 
is seen with its winding river, woods, and seats, and m the distance 
Morven, Lochnagar, and some of the other most remarkable moun- 
tains of Aberdeen and Banffshires. The grounds, which are of 
areat variety of surface, comprehend 285 acres of natural wood, 
and with belts, 90 of planted, seven or eight miles of drives, a great 
extent of walks, and a highly cultivated home-farm of 400 acres, 
including the lawn, the whole showing that, while money has been 
liberally°expended, it has been tastefully and judiciously laid out. 

The view from the manse of Keig, situated on the southern 
slope, in the neighbourhood of Castle Forbes, is equally com- 
manding and rich, including the fine grounds of the castle, which, 
with its extensive park, is looked upon as one of the most roman- 
tic places in the county.

Live-Stock.-The sheep in the parish altogether scarcely exceed 
600 ; about a score are large Leicestershire, kept principally tor 
the sake of their wool for domestic purposes ; a few are four-horned, 
the rest are black-faced Highland. The cattle generally preferred 
are the native horned Aberdeenshire, in many instances crossed 
by the Galloway, but sufficient attention even yet is not paid to 
breed. About 1 150 of all ages are kept ; 300 are cows and grown 
beasts, and 260 are calves annually reared, of which about 40 
are sold at one year old, 60 at two, and the rest at three, except 
20 or 30 kept to replace old cows, &amp;c. The work-horses are 
good, worth from L.20 to L.30 and L.40, and principally home- 
bred, not including 26 colts and poneys, there are 108 m the pa- 
rish. The small tenants who keep only one, sometimes club two to- 
gether in ploughing, and sometimes yoke an ox with the horse; with 
this exception, there was lately only one pair of work oxen used 

The short-horned breed and first crosses from these and Aber- 
deenshire cows, are now becoming very common in this and the 
neighbouring parishes, and farmers now find it more profitable to 
Zl fully more cattle, and send them to the London market since 
steam navigation has been extended. 

The system of tillage is that common to the interior parts of 
Aberdeenshire, the tenants being usually bound with some m d. 
fications to the following seven-course shift: 1. a green crop, 
uch as turnips, potatoef, 8cc. for which tbe grounds - 
pared and manured; 2. a white crop « -t-' 'X f'

summer fallow, and takes the place of crops 1. and 2. above ; two- 
sided barley is not reckoned a profitable crop, and neither pease 
nor beans are raised. In harvest, the scythe has now almost en- 
tirely superseded the sickle. Distant carriage prevents the use 
of such manures as whale and herring refuse and night soils, but 
bone-dust is successfully employed. 

There were formerly many life-leases, of which two remain ; 
the present term is nineteen years. Under both the old and new 
leases, the rent of some farms is payable partly in meal, but under 
the new, the proportion of it is small ; the tenants are, besides, 
generally bound to bear their proportion of carriage of materials 
for river embankments, for repairing or rebuilding the proprietor's 
mansion-house, and the parish church, manse, and school-house, 
and though there is no thirlage, to carry their grain to such mill 
as may be specified. 

Some of the tenants certainly feel the want of sufficient capital ; 
but the principal disadvantage under which the whole labour, is 
their distance from a sea-port, or a ready market for agricultural 
produce. In spite, however, of such obstacles, cultivated lands 
continue to be more and more improved, wastes to be gradually 
reclaimed, and rents not only to rise but to be well paid.

which amount to L.1826, 4s. 4d., by an enterprising individual,

equal to about L.IOO. 

Manufactures. — Under the head of manufactures there is only 
to be mentioned, that knitting worsted stockings for the Aberdeen 
manufacturers continues to be the principal occupation of the i 
poorer females. Upwards of 5000 pairs, at from 3d. to 6d. per 
pair, are annually made by about thirty families. It may be ob- 
served, that this is an employment which does not interrupt their 
attention to many of their domestic concerns in or out of doors. 
V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Towns, c. — The parish contains no village. The 
nearest towns are Inverury and Kintore, at distances of twelve and 
fourteen miles ; but the only market intercourse is with Aberdeen, 
from which the centre of the parish is twenty-five miles distant. 
The Aberdeen and Alford turnpike road passes for half a mile 
through the southern extremity of Keig. A mail gig runs daily 
to and from Aberdeen, and a stage-coach every alternate day. 
The Whitehouse post-office is just beyond the boundaries of the 
parish. Keig has ten and a half miles of commutation roads, — 
the funds for the support of which are L.31, 10s. 2d. a year; and 
upwards of five miles of roads made and kept up by the respective 
proprietors of the lands through which they pass, the whole being 
•well directed and kept in excellent repair. There are besides 
about five miles of little used and bad hill roads, and one and a 
half of old commutation in much the same state. Keig bridge, 
over the Don, has been mentioned. It was built in 1817, at an 
expense, including the approaches, of L.2300, and has been of in- 
finite benefit. One-half of the money was raised by subscription, 
and the other was advanced by Government on condition of being 
relieved from the annual Exchequer allowance of L.57, 17s. 3d., 
under the Small Stipend Act, to the ministers of Keig and Tough, 
by the union of the two parishes, on the demise of either of the 
incumbents,— Lord Forbes liberally taking upon himself the pay- 
ment till the junction should take place ; but since that time the 
parishes have been disunited again by the Court of Teinds. 

Ecclesiastical State.— T\\e parish of Keig was originally made up 
of church lands, belonging, apparently, to the priory of Monymusk, 
at first a seat of the Culdees, but erected in the reign of William the 

3 



KEIG. 



955 



Lion into a priory for the canons regular of St Andrews. The 
Culdees were disinherited of their lands, which were bestowed 
by the Bishop of St Andrews upon the canons, who was called to 
Parliament as Lord Keig and Monymusk. It was erected into a 
distinct regality, being one of the three, — St Andrews, Kirkliston, 
and Monymusk, in which the Archbishop sat as supreme judge in 
criminal cases, coined money, and laid hold of all forfeited pro- 
perties. The original bailie of this regality was Lord Forbes, 
who was so to the priors of Monymusk, the Abbots of Arbroath and 
Lyndores, the Bishop of St Andrews, Moray, as appears from a 
family manuscript ; but the Marquis of Huntly became hereditary 
bailie, and paid to this see an annual feu-duty of L.300 Scots. 

List of Ministers of the Parish of Keig. — Rev. John Young, 
member of Assembly, 1638 ; Rev. Thomas Forbes ; Rev. George 
Middleton, died 1739 ; Rev. Alexander Strachan, appointed 
June 24, 1740; Rev. William Duff, died 1772; Rev. Alexander 
Smith, appointed 14th December 1774, and died in 1833; Rev. 
Alexander Low, appointed 27th June 1834. The present act of 
patronage having been sanctioned by the Legislature before the 
appointment of Mr Middleton to the church and parish of Keig, 
a band of fifty soldiers is said to have been sent to his settlement, 
for the purpose of preserving the peace, which was stationed near 
the present bridge over the Don, during the service, and, in con- 
sequence, this part of the old glebe is called the " Drum Leys" 
to this day. 

The church, which is an excellent model for a country church, 
of the Gothic style of architecture, was built in 1835, and is beau- 
tifully situated in a south exposure, a little more than a quarter 
of a mile north of the river, "and looking down upon the grounds 
of Castle Forbes. The sittings are from 480 to 500, all free. The 
old manse was built in 1774, and the present in 1834. An ex- 
cambion of the glebe at the same time took place, whieh, altoge- 
ther, contained then 12 acres, 2 roods, 1 1 poles Scots. 

- The number of families at present actually in Keig is 130, of 
which 124, composed of 630 persons, attend the parish church ; 
2, of 16 persons, at the church of a neighbouring parish for con- 
venience ; 3, of 7 persons, at a Dissenting meeting-house, and 1 
family at an Episcopalian chapel, all being regular attendants at 
their respective places of worship. The average number of com- 
municants at the parish church is about 306. 

- Education.— ThQ parochial school is centrically and convenient- 



956 



ABERDEENSHIRE. 



ly situated. The schoolmaster's salary was fixed, in 1829, at L.29, 
18s. lOd., with a dwelling-house not restricted to the legal accom- 
modation, but is now the maximum. From 15 to 20 girls lately 
attended a school kept by a young woman, who teaches reading, 
writing, and sewing ; and about 25 children, in the southern part 
of the parish, are taught reading, writing, and arithmetic at an 
unendowed school near them in the extremity of the parish, at the 
same rates as in the parochial school. 

Poor. — The average number of persons on the poor roll for the 
last six years has been 9, mostly infirm old women without near re- 
lations able to support them, besides whom others in similar circum- 
stances have been occasionally assisted. The average annual con- 
tributions for their relief for the same period at the disposal of the 
kirk-session have been as follows: Church collections, L.17, 3s. 
9d.; interest of money, L.4. 16s. ; donations and legacies, L.IO, 
15s. 6d.; fines, L.l, Is. 8d.; total, L. 33, 16s. lUd.; L.16, 
13s. 4d. has been distributed for the year at an average to 
those on the roll quarterly, in sums of from 6s. to 12s., ac- 
cording to the necessities of each individual, and to others 
occasionally from the donations perhaps from 10s. to 15s. a year 
each ; not including about L.20 paid annually for the support of a 
pauper lunatic and foundling child. The present number on the 
roll is 12, and the quarterly sum granted at an average to each of 
1 0 is about 8s. No person belonging to the parish has begged for 
upwards of fifty years past ; and so far are the poor from showing 
any disposition to seek parochial relief, that much address is often 
required to prevail upon them to accept it. The people in gene- 
ral are sufficiently attentive to those in want or distress, and the 
only residing proprietor is remarkably so. The heritors have been 
liberal in their donations, in order to prevent a legal assessment. 
Miscellaneous Observations. 
In 1792, when the last Statistical Account was drawn up, the 
Duke of Gordon was superior of the whole lands in this district. 
In the parish there were 430 imperial acres of wood, mostly natu- 
ral, and 2130 of arable land, of which about one- fifth was infield, 
rented at from 9s. 6d. to 17s. per acre, and the rest outfield, at 
from Is 7d. to 4s.; the whole rental, including the value of vari- 
ous services, being under L.600. The infield was manured, and 
kept constantly under a rotation of one crop of bear and two ot 
oats; the outfield was exhausted by three or more crops of oals, 
and then allowed to lie waste till it recovered. Few ot the te-

nants sowed grass seeds, or raised turnips or potatoes except for 
the pot; — 148 horses, 610 cattle, and 1229 sheep were kept; of 
the latter the greater part belonged to crofters, and, being allowed 
to wander about, were very detrimental to the neighbours. There 
were 47 ploughs, drawn by 88 horses; 87 cows, and 157 oxen 
and young cattle. The wages of farm -servants were, of men, from 
L.4, 10s. to L.6, 10s. or L.7; of women, from L.2 to L.3 per 
annum ; of day labourers, 6d. with maintenance. Reapers were 
hired for the harvest, the men at L.2 and the women at L.l. The 
inhabited houses were 117, of which 79 were occupied by married 
persons, 9 by widowers, 15 by widows, 8 by bachelors, and 6 by 
unmarried women.

PRESBYTERY OP KINCARDINE o'nEIL, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. WILLIAM CAMPBELL, A. M., MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

JyTawje.— CouLL, in the Gaelic language, signifies a corner 
nook, or retiring part of the country. It is a name common over 
the Highlands of Scotland, scarcely any large property beino- 
without its Coull, or Mid-Coull, or Wester Coull, &amp;c. Coullt 
interpreted as above, forms a very appropriate name to a parish 
lying chiefly in the south-eastern corner of the district of Cromar. 

Extent, §-c. — The form of this parish is irregular. As laid 
down in Robertson's Map of Aberdeenshire, it resembles, in some 
measure, the outline of Great Britain. Its average length may 
be about 6, and breadth about .3 miles. It is bounded on the 
south, by Aboyne ; on the west, by Coldstone ; on the north, by 
Tarland and Cushnie ; and on the east, by Leochel and Lum- 
phanan. A mountain-range, whose summits are named Hill of 
Gellan, Mortlich, Leadhlich, and the Hill of Corse, forms, in a 
great measure, a natural boundary between Coull and the parishes 
of Aboyne and Lumphanan. 

Soil and Climate.~ThQ general character of the soil is good • 
a fine loam, in some fields of great depth, and 1 ving on an open' 



958 



ABERDEIiNSHIRE. 



gravelly subsoil. The climate is good, the air pure, and the 
grain crops in Cromar are generally as early as any in this county. 

Geology. — The geology of CouU is of the same character as 
the general features of Aberdeenshire ; the hills consisting chiefly 
of granite, red and white, the former prevailing. There is a con- 
siderable extent of level ground in the centre of the parish, called 
Bogmore. It consists of alluvial deposit on moss. At one period 
it was generally covered with water, and formed a disagreeable, 
unhealthy swamp. By recent draining, the greater part of it has 
been brought into cultivation, the remainder has been converted 
into good pasture, and the climate has been greatly improved. 
The oak appears to have once flourished here, a specimen of enor- 
mous size having been recently dug up on the farm of Wester 
Coull, and two large beams of oak, rudely joined together by 
blocks of wood, were lately found in a piece of mossy ground near 
the manse. 

Botany. — No rare plants have been discovered. The following 
may be mentioned as inhabitants of the parish : 

Parnassia palustris Chelidonium magus Vacciniura oxycoccos 

Reseda luteola Mercurialis perennis Drosera rotundifolia 

Littorella lacustris Arenaria serpyllifolia Trientalis Europaea 

Radiola millegrana Arbutus Uva ursi Pyrola rotundifolia. 

The Senecio Jacohea is no stranger in our pastures, and of late 
years our hay fields are much infested with the Matricaria cha- 
momilla. 

Of animals, the roe-deer, hare, grouse, partridge, snipe, wild- 
duck, hedgehog, polecat, and weasel may be noticed. 

II. — Civil HisTORy. 

Parochial Registers. — The earliest parochial register commen- 
ces 1752. Baptisms and marriages are recorded in it ; but it has 
not been kept with much regularity. 

Land-owners. — The land-owners are, the Earl of Aberdeen, 
whose valuation is L.812 Scots ; Sir John Forbes, Bart. L.43-2, 
4s. 6d. Scots ; and the Marquis of Huntly, L.288, 6s. 8d. Scots. 
Mr Farquharson of Finzean also possesses some land in the pa- 
rish, and pays stipend ; but has no valuation. 

Antiquities.— Ox\e of those circles of stones standing upright, so 
common in Britain, and called Druidical circles, may be seen on 
a small hill called Tom-na-kivrigh, or the « Hill of worship or jus- 
tice." About the centre of the lands of Corse, there existed, at 
a very remote period, a chapel called Turry Chapel. The traces 
pf its existence are still visible. The tradition regarding it is, that 



couLL. 959 

It belonged to the " monks and friars." The castle or fortalice 
of Corse was erected in 1581 by William Forbes, father of Bishop 
Patrick Forbes of Corse. The walls of the castle still remain, but 
in a ruinous condition. Upon a rocky eminence in the vicinity 
of the church may still be seen the remains or rubbish of the 
Castle of Coull. It appears to have been a fortification of con- 
siderable extent and great strength, of square form, with large 
hexagonal towers at its angles. The fosse may still be dis- 
tinctly seen. It was the seat of the Durwards,— a family once 
of great influence in this district. It is a common saying still, that 
the church bell of Coull rings of its own accord when a Durward 
dies.

1821, . 701 

1831, . 767 

The population, by census 1841, is 744. Of this number, 
284 reside upon the lands of Corse, and, quoad sacra, are attached 
to the pansh of Leochel. The population of Coull, quoad sacra, 
IS therefore 460,— bemg, by the late census, the smallest parochial 
charge m this county. There is no town, and scarcely any as- 
semblage of cottages deserving the name of a village. 

IV. — Industry. 
The number of arable acres is about 2300 ; of uncultivated pas 
ture upwards of 5000; of land that might profitably be added to 
the cultivated land from 80 to 100; and about 320 acres are un 
der wood, scarcely any of which exceeds the age of twenty years 
The highest rent per acre is about L.2 ; the average rent about' 
i-.l, s.; and the real rental of the parish nearly L.2500 

Within the last twenty years, the agriculture has undergone 
great improvement. Much land has been brought into cultiva- 
tion Draining, enclosing, regular rotations of cropping, turnip 
husbandry, artificial grasses, are universally adopted. Thf seventh 
h ft three of grass is generally followed, although the more in- 
telhgent farmers consider the sixth, with only one oat crop, a a 
preferable rotation. The property of Corse'has, within th': iLt 
twenty-five years, been greatly improved. Colonel Arthur For 
bes commenced these improvements, while acting as commissioner 
for his nephew, then in India. Plantations of considerable exten 
were very tastefully laid out. Sir John Forbes, on his return to 
hs paternal estates, carried forward the improvements n Cor

with great zeal and judgment ; and, by completing the plantations, 
making good roads, remodelling the farms as they fell out of 
lease, straightening marches, laying olf fields of proper size and 
form, enclosing, draining, building neat slated cottages, &amp;c. he 
has accomplished so much, that the aspect of the lands of Corse 
is entirely changed; the climate meliorated; and thus a property 
that previously had every appearance of neglect, is now so much 
improved and ornamented, as to form one of the most beautiful 
and valuable estates of its size in this county. 

There is a wool-carding mill in the parish, at which blankets 
and coarse woollen cloths are also manufactured. Knitting of 
stockings is carried on ; but the profits from this manufacture are 
now become exceedingly small. 

v.— Parochial Economy. 
Ecclesiastical State.— We have neither Seceder, Episcopalian, 
nor Roman Cathohc,— the whole population being of the Esta- 
blished Church. Occasionally, some young folks of the Roman 
Catholic persuasion come into the parish as farm-servants. These 
generally attend the parish church, and some have become con- 
verts to Protestantism ; and, after due examination, been admitted 
to the communion. The minister's stipend amounts to L.105 
Sterling, and four chalders of victual, payable in kind. The glebe 
consists of nearly four acres of very fine soil, worth about L.2 per 
acre There is a process at present in dependence between bir 
John Forbes, Bart, and the minister, in regard to the proportion 
of stipend payable by him, as proprietor of the lands of Corse. By 
the last locality, these lands were burdened with a payment of 
nearly L.60 Sterling in value, in money and victual. An old va- 
luation of the teinds of Corse has recently been brought to light, 
in which the teinds are declared to be 100 merks Scots ; and a 
process has in consequence been commenced for the reduction of 
[he last locahty. The manse was built in 1832, is commodious, 
til finilhS, and in excellent condition. The heritors, rat er 
than repair the old, at considerable expense, preferred to bu d a 
new house ; and they have erected a very good new nianse forle 
rney tha. was required, in a neighbouring parish, for repair ng 
Td making an addition to an old one. The church is a pbm 
ubstantial'building. It .as erected in 1792, has no gaU 
but is sufficiently commodious. The church he\\ is of con 
derable size, and well-toned. It .as cast in Holland m the

year 1644, and presented to the church by Mr Ross of Mill 
of Coull. 

Sir John Forbes, Bart, of Craigievar, is sole patron of the pa- 
rish. The patronao-e and teinds belonged, at one period, to the 
Abbey of Arbroath. At the Reformation, they fell to the Crown. 
The patronage afterwards passed into the hands of the Earl of 
Panmure, from whom it was purchased by the family of Craigie- 
var, and it has been in their possession about 150 years. 

Education.— The parochial is the only school in the parish. Mr 
Theodore Allan, the schoolmaster, who is also a licentiate of the 
church, is a well qualified, zealous, and very successful teacher. 
The intellectual system is followed, and particular attention is paid 
to the religious instruction of the young. No additional school 
seems to be called for, although, at the extreme points of the pa- 
rish, the children are rather far from school. The schoolmas- 
ter's salary is L.26, with allowance of L.2, 2s. for a garden. He 
receives annually from that admirable and well-managed charity, 
the Dick Bequest, nearly L. 40. The school fees amount to 
about L. 18, the session-clerkship held by the schoolmaster, 
brings upwards of L. 2, and there is a good dwelling-house 
contammg five apartments. About forty years ago, the salary 
ol the parochial schoolmaster of Coull amounted only to fifty 
merks Scots and the school-fees were of inconsiderable value. 

• ""' P''°"« receiving parochial aid 

«s J2, the average annual allowance to each L. 1, 12s., and the 
average annual amount of funds for support of the poor is, from 
church collections, L.14, from interest of money, &amp;c. L.3. When 
these are exhausted, recourse is had to a small fund kept in the 
bank, amounting at present to L.60, but which is rapidly under- 
gomg a process of reduction. The amount of the church collec- 
tions has doubled within the last twenty years.

PRESBYTERY OF ELLON, SYNOD OE ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. JAMES WHYTE, MINISTER. 



T__ Topography AND Natural History. 
Jthe name of this parish is said to be derived from 

 , J- .  Devenick, who, according to Dempster, 

r/thl :L":ed "nt day ™ay be see„ in that rare wor., the

METHLICK.

Tarves on the south ; by New Deer on the north ; by Fyvie and 
Monquhitter on the west ; and by Ellon on the east. 

A pendicle of Methlick, which lies to the extreme east, is dis- 
joined altogether from the main part of the parish by a tongue of 
land belonging to Tarves. This pendicle is called Little Drum- 
quhindle, or Inverebrie, from its being situate at the junction of 
the brook Ebrie with the Ythan, and the Six Ploughs, from its 
extent as measured in olden times by so many ploughs. 

The length of the parish from north to south is about 8 miles, 
and its breadth from west to east, exclusive of the insulated part 
above-mentioned, about 5 miles. It is of an irregular form, and 
becomes narrower toward both extremities, especially northward. 
It is traversed from west to east by the river Ythan, the banks of 
which are mostly clothed with wood, the greater part of it having 
been planted, between thirty and forty years ago, by the present 
proprietor. The south-east division of Methlick is wholly occu- 
pied by the policies of Haddo House, remarkable for their extent 
and beauty. Every advantage has been taken of the undulating 
nature of the ground, which is tastefully interspersed with wood", 
and lawn, and water. In a northerly direction, there is a consider- 
able tract of barren land,— the hills of Balquhindachy, Belnagoak, 
and Skilmoney, being to a great extent covered with heath. 
■ If one may judge from the hale old age which not a few reach 
m this parish, the climate may be said to be salubrious. 

Hydrography.— The Ythan is not navigable here ; but it af- 
fords salmon, and abundance of trout of various kinds. At one 
time, it was more famous for its pearl fishery than it is at present, 
although there is still no want of shells in the river. It is a fa- 
vourite amusement of the schoolboys to fish for pearls when the 
water is low, especially during summer; and occasionally they 
succeed, although there are hundreds of blanks for one prize. The 
instrument used for griping the shell is very simple, consistino- 
ot a long stick, with two small pieces of plate steel at one end. ° 
A rivulet called the water of Gight, or the black water, or the 
lUtle water, separates the parish of Methlick on the west from 
i'yvie and Monquhitter.and New Deer. Within the short space 
0 a mile and a half on this brook, are to be found two points/ 
at which three different parishes meet; at that nearest to the 
Xthan, Fyvie, Monquhitter, and Methlick,-and at the other, 
Wew Deer, Monquhitter, and Methlick. The Ebrie, above-men- 
tioned, divides Methlick on the east from the parish of Ellon 



964 ABERDEENSHIRE. 

Another burn, called the water of Kelly, from its running through 
the land, and near the House of Kelly or Haddo House, is said, 
at its junction with the Ythan in this parish, to have produced a 
pearl of great value. According to a tradition which can be tra- 
ced to the end of the seventeenth century, one of the crown je;els 
is reported to have been found at the mouth of the water of Kelly. 
It was presented to King James VI. in 1620, by Sir Thomas 
Menzies of Cults, and in the language of Skene, in his succinct 
view of Aberdeen, published in 1685, appears to have been, ' tor 
beauty and bigness, the best that was at any time found m bcot- 

"There are two lakes within the policies of Haddo House, called 
the upper and the lower lakes, of which the latter is wholly m the 
parish of Methlick, while one-half of the former is m that ot 
Tarves. Each is beautifully embosomed in wood. The lower 
one, in its formation by the present proprietor, required only a very 
small embankment, and is almost altogether natural. Together 
they contain nearly 40 acres. They are enlivened by the presence 
of swans, Canadian geese, and native water-fowls of various de- 
scriptions, and in great numbers. About two years ago, a wild 
swan having been taken on the lower lake, and pinioned, now as- 
sociates with the tame ones. • i ,Vip 
The springs in this parish are numerous and perennial, and the 
..ater thereof is of excellent quality. About two miles m a nor h- 
easterlv direction from the church, there is a strong sprmg, which 
was some years ago in great vogue, and frequented by many from 
I-tant parts of the country, in consequence of the sujpposed - - 
brity of its waters, which were applied both externally and inter- 
nallv with alleged success, especially in cutaneous diseases The 
.atr has been frequently subjected to chemical ---J- 
has not been found to possess saline impregnations of any import 
ance. It is very pure spring water. 

Geology, Soil, 6fc.-Theve is nothing remarkable m the geo o- 
gicXpe -nc; ;f the parish. Gneiss and syenite are the r k 
which prevail. Some years ago, a limestone quarry was Nmugli

band pan, which eats away the improvement. A subsoil of clay 
is not common. There is a great extent of peat moss in the pa- 
rish, which, however, is being annually reduced, and brought into 
a state of cultivation. 

Botany, Zoology, Ornithology, &amp;fc. — Some of the less common 
plants are, 

Chrysosplenium alternifo- Trientalis Europsea Habenaria viridis 

Jiuni Agrimonia Eupatoria Hippuris vulgaris 

Listera cordata Menyanthes trifoliata Circaa lutetiana 

Viola palustris Geranium sylvaticum Botrychium lunaria 

Plantago coronopus lucidum Festuca bromoides 

Anchusa sempervirens robertianum Bromus asper 

Myrica Gale Plantago maritima Galium Witherlngii 

Pyrola rotundifolia Borago officinalis Myosotis secunda 

Vaccmmm Vitis-Idtea Gnaphalium sylvaticum Lysimachia nemorum. 
Genista anglica Juniperus communis 

The plants most commonly met with are those which have 
found their way into the vernacular tongue, such as the gowan, or 
the daisy; the horse-gowan, or dandelion; the tansy, or ragwort; 
blue bells, or common bell flower; dead man's bells, or foxglove 
chickeiiwort, or chickweed; dockens, or dock; arnut, or earth- 
nut; sitsikker, or creeping crowfoot; sooraks, or sheep's sorrel- 
&amp;c. &amp;c. ' 

The Scotch fir and the common spruce agree well with the soil 
and climate. A great variety of foreign pines have been planted in 
the immediate neighbourhood of his mansion, by the noble proprie- 
tor, with various success. The Pinus Cemhra appears to thrive verv 
well m the policies, and to have become in a manner naturalized 
ui the country. A very fine specimen of the Pinus Clanbrassiliana 
was lately discovered in the midst of the wood near Haddo House 
being the produce of promiscuous planting. It measures 36 inches 
m height, and is nearly thirty-six years old. 

In gardens, the raspberry, the gooseberry, the currant, and 
the strawberry are produced in abundance, and of excellent qua- 
lity ; but neither the soil nor the climate appears to favour the 
production of apples or pears, or even cherries.

family was the barony of MethHck, whereof Haddo was a part. 
His Lordship derives three of his titles from this parish, namely, 
Baron Methlick, Haddo, and Kellie. 

Parochial Registers. — The oldest register of church discipline 
and accounts of the poor's funds commences in 1683, and, with 
the exception of the years from 1689 to 1703, and from 1726 to 
1729, is complete till the present day. The earliest date of the 
baptismal record is 1663; but it has not been regularly kept, 
owing to the neglect of parents in not attending to the registra- 
tion of the births of their children. The marriages have been 
registered for many years. 

Modern Buildings. — Towards the end of the sixteenth century, 
the designation of the family of Methlick seems to have been re- 
stricted to that of Haddo, probably from the mansion-bouse having 
been situated there. Early in the seventeenth century, the resi- 
dence was transferred to Kelly, which gradually acquired the name 
that had been given to the former mansion, namely, the House 
of Haddo, or Haddo House. It stood a siege of three days in 
1644, by the Marquis of Argyle and the covenanting army, by 
whom it was taken on the 8th of May 1644, and reduced to ruins. 
The writer of a View of the Diocese of Aberdeen in 1726 says, 
" Here is now a castle begun in the last age by two of the lairds 
of Haddo, but never finished, and in the low buildings hard by it, 
their representative, the Earl of Aberdeen, lives." The present 
mansion was built mainly from the designs of John Baxter, Esq., 
architect in Edinburgh, who executed several buildings in the 
north of Scotland in the beginning of the last century. The Pal- 
ladian was his favourite style, of which Haddo House is a speci- 
men. In its immediate vicinity are some old ashes and beautiful 
limes, and a very picturesque larch, planted more than a hundred 
years ago. 

Within the policies, there is an obelisk of granite erected by ihe 
present Earl to the memory of his gallant brother. Sir Alexander 
Gordon, who fell in the van at Waterloo, acting as aide de-camp 
to the Duke of Wellington.

{794 .... 1035

„nles. Ninety»two were found to reside in the village and kirk-

number of houses inhabited was 354. 

There are 2 blind persons in the parish, 1 fatuous, and none 

deaf and dumb. • i, „ 

Habitual intemperance is rarely met with m the parish ; and 
the average number of illegitimate births in the parish within the 
three years previous to 1840 was 11, of which 7 were ante nuptial 
cases. The attendance on the ordinances of religion is exemplary. 

IV. — Industry. 
no«Z.«...- According to a survey made in 1803, the exten 
of the parish was ascertained to be, exclusive of tha part of the 
policies around Haddo House, which belongs to Methl.ck, about 

11,217 Scotch acres. 1020 Scotch acre

number of tenants paying rents to the proprietor is 206 ; of whom 
60 pay L.5 and under; 62 above L.5 and under L.IO; 31 above 
L.IO and under L.20; 35 above L.20 and under L.50 ; 13 above 
L.50 and under L.lOO; and 5 L.lOO and upwards. 

Besides a number of small crofts, sufficient to keep a cow, and 
partially to supply the day-labourer's family with meal and po- 
tatoes, there are possessions from 12 to 30 acres, occupied by 
tenants who very often yoke an ox and a horse together, and 
labour with their own hands. The farms vary in size, from two 
horses' labour to that of six horses. This subdivision of land is 
found to exert a wholesome influence on the population. 

Since the breaking out of the French Revolution, agriculture 
has progressed rapidly in this parish. The better quality of the 
soil has been brought into a state of cultivation, while the traces 
of former husbandry are in many places to be seen in the shape 
of curved ridges, which, because of their poverty, have been allow- 
ed to revert to a state of nature. 

All the good land is now enclosed by stone dikes, besides a 
great deal of indifferent quality ; and we have many specimens of 
the charm which bones, as a manure, have wrought on the poorer 
soils. Nitrate of soda as well as bones dissolved in sulphuric acid 
and water, according to the proportions recommended by Liebio-, 
have been tried on a limited scale ; but it is believed that this 
year the new manures will have a fair trial here and throuo-hout 
the district. 

In cropping, the seven-shift is by far the most common in the 
parish, but some of the more intelligent of the farmers are begin- 
ning to give the preference to the six-shift, where three grasses are 
taken in succession, then a grain crop, then turnips and potatoes, 
and then another grain crop. Several farms are wrought on the 
five-shift; but it is more common to find this mode of cropping 
among those who have small crofts of good quality. 

The duration of leases is nineteen years. The leases are al- 
ways renewed except in a case of arrears of rent, which is not 
common. A small part of the rents is payable in meal at the fiar 
prices. The farm-houses are mostly of one floor and slated, while 
the dwellings of the crofters are thatch-roofed. 

Lioe-Stock. — The cattle reared are numerous, and about equal- 
ly divided between the Aberdeenshire breed, and the cross of it 
wiih the Teeswater. Within tlie last thirty or forty years, the 
country breeds have been much improved by superior keep,' and 



970 ABERDEENSHIUR. 

in those parts of the parish which are less favoured in point of 
soil, they are still reared exclusively ; but there is scarcely a good , 
farm of any size where the short-horn is not preferred as crossed 
with the Aberdeenshire, 

The number of sheep reared throughout the parish is very 
small; but within the policies of Haddo House, there are gene- 
rally kept about 1000, principally of the Cheviot and black-faced 

Produce.— hi a rough calculation, the number of quarters of grain 
may be estimated at 10,000 and upwards, and the number of acres 
annually in turnips and potatoes, the latter of which are raised only 
in small quantities, at 1000. The number of horses used for hus- 
bandry, kept as pleasure ponies, and bred for sale and use, is about 
250 ; and the number of cattle above 1600. The average value 
of a quarter of oats is L.l ; of an acre of turnips, L.3, 15s. ; of 
an acre of potatoes, L.4, 10s.; of an acre of new grass, L.l, los. ; 
and of an acre of second and third year's grass, 18s. 6d. _ 

Cheese is made for the most part from skim-milk, and is sold 
at 3s 6d. per imperial stone. Butter of good quality is made on 
the. large farms, and on crofts where there is little else of produce 
to spare for the market, and is bought by the country merchants 
on an average at 8d. per pound, and sent to Aberdeen. 

The mode of cutting down the crop with the scythe has sup- 
planted the sickle universally. All farms of two horses' labour 
and upwards, with scarcely a single exception, have threshing-mills 
driven by water or horses. According to the last Account, there 
were six meal-mills in the parish, and now there is only one. This 
is to be accounted for partly by the improvement of machinery, and 
the consequent expedition with which the work is accomphshed, but 
more particularly by the fact, that grain and not meal is now export- 
ed to Newburgh, Inverury, and Aberdeen. Thir age is abohshed, 
and sixpence is paid for drying and grinding a boll. Formerly, 
the thirteenth, or even the eleventh peck in some instances, was 
ravable to the miller. There is a saw-mill in the parish driven 
bv water. The crops usually cultivated are sown grasses, oats, 
bear or big in very limited quantity, turnips, potatoes, and, to a 
small extent, there may be added tares, principally for the pur- 
pose of supplying the cows with food when the grass season is over, 
Ld befrrr'they'are put on turnips. The species of oats most 
commonly sown are Scotch barley, sandy oats, and early Angus. 
There is an Association for the encouragement of agricultural 



METHLICK.

enterprise and improvement, which is called the Methlick Agri- 
. cultural Association. 

Manufactures. — The knitting of stockings with wires was, at one 
time, a common and lucrative employment for women, and also for 
old and infirm men. Ss. and even 3s. were paid for spinning the 
wool and knitting a pair of stockings, and now 3|d. or 4d. is the 
paltry sum which a poor old woman receives for knitting a pair of 
them. Formerly, the rents were, in a great measure, paid by the 
money which was earned by spinning and knitting. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town. — There is no market-town within the parish. 
The grain exported is delivered at Inverury, Newburgh, and Aber- 
deen. From the two places first named, each fully twelve miles 
distant from Methlick, bones and English lime are imported for 
manure. Scotch lime here made use of by some farmers, more 
especially to be applied to newly trenched ground, is brought 
from the three following kilns, according to their nearness to the 
difiFerent corners of the parish,— Udny, Aquhorthies, and Barrack. 

Means of Communication.— KmW-gig runs between Aberdeen 
and Methlick daily,— a convenience which is highly appreciated 
by all living in this neighbourhood. Formerly, there was no post- 
town nearer than Old Meldrum, which is mJre than seven miles 
distant from Methlick. No turnpike passes through this parish ; 
but there are good commutation roads to New Deer, Fyvie' 
Ellon, Old Meldrum, and Tarves; and, from the four pkces last 
mentioned, there is a turnpike to Aberdeen. A carrier leaves 
Methlick at least every fortnight for Aberdeen ; but there is no 
stage-coach nearer than Tarves. 

Ecclesiastical 5ifae.— Methlick was a prebendary in the cathe- 
dral of Aberdeen, having been added to the bishop's chapter in 
1362. The rector or parson, who drew the great teinds, resided in 
the canonry of Aberdeen, and officiated in the cathedral —the 
duties of the cure being discharged by a perpetual vicar who lived 
at Methlick, and drew the vicarage or small teinds. 

The benefice does not seem to have been of great value, as in 
13agimont's Roll, which exhibits the amount of the tenth part of 
each benefice in the reign of James V., it is rated at L.6, 13s. 4d 
In 1644, It was valued at L.4026. Some of the rectors of Meth- 
lick, before the Reformation, occupy prominent places in the re 
cords of the diocese of Aberdeen. The last Romanist Principal 
ot King s College was parson of Methlick. His name was Alex 



972 ABERDEENSHIRE. 

ander Anderson. He was a person of some note, and held this 
livmg in 1560, In 1541, Duncan Burnet, rector of Methlick, as. 
appears from volume first of the Spalding Club Miscellany, lately 
published, bequeathed to the chaplains of the choir of the cathe- 
dral of Aberdeen an annual rent of 26s. 8d. for the celebration of 
an obit on behalf of his own soul, and the souls of all his succes- 
sors» 

At the Reformation, a large part of the north of Scotland was 
left in a state of great spiritual destitution ; and, in the register of 
ministers, 1567, we find Methlick, together with the three neigh- 
bouring parishes, Tarves, Ellon, and Fyvie, superintended by only 
one clergyman. His name was Mr Alexander Ogilvie, and his 
stipend six score merks. Readers were provided in each of the 
four parishes above-mentioned ; and the name of the person who 
then held that ancient ecclesiastical office at Methlick was NycoU 
Smyth. 

The ministers of Methlick since the Reformation have been 
Mr John Mercer, Mr Adam Reid, Mr William Seaton, Mr Wil- 
liam Strachan, Mr Robert Ogilvy, Mr George Anderson, Mr 
Alexander Clerk, Mr John MuUigine, Mr Alexander Howe, Mr 
Andrew Moir, Mr Alexander Knolls, Mr Robert Adam, Mr 

Ludovick Grant. i t.  

Besides the parish church, there was, before the Reformation, 
a chapel at a place called Chapeltown, the name of which remams 
unchanged ; and there was another chapel at Andet, dedicated to 
St Ninian. That last mentioned must have stood near a farm- 
house now called Chapel-park, where there is a good spring that 
still goes under the name of the Chapel Well, and where, until 
recently, traces of a church-yard were distinctly visible,— they 
having disappeared, about fifty years ago, under the plough 

The present church and manse are situate upon the south bank 
of the Ythan, about five miles from the northern, five and a-half 
from the eastern, three from the southern, and two from the westein 
boundary of the parish. The church was rebuilt in 1780, repaired 
in 1840, and may contain about 600 persons. The sittings are all 
free, and are apportioned among the several tenants One gal- 
"'is occupied ly the family seat of the Earl of Aberdeen who 
ifsole proprietor and patron of the parish ; and adjoining to the 
church is the burying-place of that Noble family  

The manse was rebuilt in 1806, ana repaireu lo- , 
wing was added to the offices.

The gift of the kirk land in this parish may be traced as far 
back as the reign of Robert II., who, by a charter dated the 16th 
June 1373, confirms a charter by Walter de Menteith de Pedina- 
calan to the Virgin Mary and the parish church of St Devenick of 
Methlick, and the vicar of the same, of a piece of land called the 
Haulch, bounded on the one side by the water of Ethyon, stretch- 
ing, on one hand, from the ford of the burn of Melok to the ford 
which is called Cloy or Clochy on the other. It is probable that 
the present glebe is very nearly the piece of land referred to in 
the charter just quoted. For it is bounded, on the one side, by 
the river Ythan ; at one extremity of it, there is the burn of 
Methlick, at the entrance of which, into the Ythan, there was for- 
merly a ford, now superseded by a bridge, and a little below the 
other extremity there is another ford, which is now called Golyford 
or Cloverickford, evidently corruptions of Cloy or Clochyford, the 
name mentioned in the foresaid ancient charter. This haugh or 
parson's croft was transferred by the chapter of the cathedral of 
Aberdeen along with the parish church, to King's College in 1586, 
at the instance of Principal Walter Stewart; and they remained in 
the hands of that institution till they were conveyed, alono- with 
the patronage, to the Earl of Aberdeen, in the middle of last cen- 
tury. 

The present glebe, inclusive of the garden and site of the 
manse and offices, measures 6| acres imperial, and is worth L.7 
or L.8 annually. 

The stipend is L.80 in money, 64 bolls of meal, and 64 bolls 
of bear, the meal and bear being payable at the fiar prices of the 
year. There is no Episcopalian, Catholic, Seceding, or other 
Dissenting chapel in the parish; but there are twelve Dissenting 
and three Episcopalian families that go to meeting-houses in the 
neighbouring parishes, and all the other families, amounting to 
342, attend the parish church ; at which the average number of 
the congregation is about 600, and that of the communicants is 
650. 

Education.~\n the parochial school, Latin, Greek, and mathe- 
matics are taught when, required, in addition to the ordinary 
branches of reading, writing, and arithmetic. The teacher has a 
salary of L.28, besides an annual gratuity of L.5 from the Earl of 
Aberdeen; school-fees and other dues, L.40 ; allowance from Mr 
Dick's Trustees, at an average L.35 ; from Moir's Mortification, 



974 ABRIIDEENSHIRE. 

for teaching ten poor children, L.8; total L.116; also a house 
with the legal accommodation, and an enclosed garden. 

Besides the parochial school, there are three adventure or un- 
endowed schools, where the ordinary branches of education are 
taught. At Cairnorie, about three miles distant from the parochial 
school, the Earl of Aberdeen has just erected a neat and commo- 
dious school, which it is intended to place on the establishment. 
This institution will prove a welcome boon to the inhabitants of 
the district, while one of the adventure schools in its immediate 
neio-hbourhood will be superseded. At Inverebrie, on the very 
verge of the parish, and nearly six miles distant from the church, 

there is another school, the teacher of which receives an annual 

gratuity from the Noble proprietor. 

In 1841, a parish library was instituted for the purpose of 

affording instructive and religious reading to the parishioners. 

There are about 80 subscribers, and nearly 400 volumes. 

There is one Sabbath school in the parish, which is superm- 

tended by the teacher of the school at Throopmuir ; and a Bible 

class, numerously attended, is taught by the minister in the church 

every Sabbath day. . 

Friendhj Societies.— The only Friendly Society which exists here, 
and which remodelled its rules agreeably to the Act of Parliament, 
is called the Methlick Wright's Friendly Society. In its mem- 
bership, it is not confined to wrights, but admits all tradesmen and 
others who wish, by paying a small sum quarterly, to share in the 
advantages which it holds forth. 

Savings Banh-k District Savings' Bank, on the security of 
the National funds, was opened in Ellon at Martinmas 1839, 
and the industrious classes in this and the other parishes of the 
Presbytery, with the exception of Cruden, already supplied with 
an institution of a similar description have gladly availed them- 
selves of the means of providing for the wants of age At Meth- 
iTck, the deposits from 25th November 1839 to 20th November 
1840 amounted to L.353; the sum withdrawn between these dates 
was L.1 ; and the interest payable at 20th Novnber 1840 . 
L6 3s. The deposits from 20th November 1840 to 20th 
vembei 1841 amo.mted to L.361 ; the su- withdrawn uring ta 

■A T fici lOc 8d • and the interest payable at 20th iNo

vea,bBr 1841 was L.18, 13s. 3d. At 20th November 1841, ll« 
lere at Methlick fifty depositors, and the sum deposited «s 
L. 684.

It may be mentioned, that the deposits from all the parishes of 
the Presbytery, with the above exception, amounted in November 
1840 to L.1584, 9s. 6d., and in November 1841 to L.2915, lis. 
8d. ; and that the number of depositors was 160 in November 
1840, and 237 in 1841. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — Of poor persons on the roll, the 
average number is 45, of whom 20 receive a permanent, and 25 an 
occasional allowance. The yearly amount of church collections is 
L.45, 7s. Id. ; interest of poor's funds lent, L.31, 4s., besides L.8 
paid to the schoolmaster for teaching ten poor children, as men- 
tioned above; proclamations and other casual supplies, L.IO, 6s. 
6d. The average sum received annually by the occasional poor 
is 18s., and by the permanent poor L.l, 18s. 6d. The session 
makes a weekly allowance to some of the most indigent from Is. 
to 2s. 6d. These sums for the support of the poor are supple- 
mented by the kindly and charitable dispositions of their neigh- 
bours, and by other seasonable supplies in the shape of clothing, 
meal, and fuel. The application for relief is at first made with a 
reluctance which nothing but the pressure of want is in most in- 
stances able to overcome. 

Fairs.— The only fairs in the parish are, one which happens 
early in May, and Dennick's fair, of great antiquity, and held to- 
ward the end of November, which, allowance being made for the 
difference of styles, will be found to correspond to the day of St 
Devenick, the saint to whom the parish was dedicated. Both are 
useful, especially as feeing-markets for servants ; but at neither 
are many cattle brought forward for sale. 

Alehouses.— Theve are at present 4 alehouses, and 3 spirit 
shops in the parish. 

Fuel— The fuel most used is peat, dug from bogs or mosses in 
this parish and in Fyvie about Whitsunday.

Mansion -houses.-There is a mansion-house at Clova, built in

of the castle, and separated from it by a beautiful ravine, built m 

the Elizabethan style. 

Jntiquities.-The castle among the objects of antiquity claim 
the first regard. Tradition bears, that it originally consisted but 
of one great circular tower, of five stories or floors ; distinguished 
by the appellation of the Snow Tower, in the western corner of 
the present fabric, which was afterwards carried iund a pi. 
pacLis court, forming an unequal pentagon, in which six other

towers, differing- in magnitude and form, rose for the protection of 
the intervening- buildings, which appear to have been but two 
stones in height. Two of these towers were for the security alone, 
of the only gate placed in the western wall, occupying the whole 
space between them; the walls were four feet thick, built of run- 
hme, and the outside courses of freestone, regularly squared; the 
western wall was reared on the verge of the acclivity at first de- 
scribed, which rose, however, in such a gentle slope, as to afford 
space for the garden, which, though warm and finely sheltered, 
would, in the present age, be accounted too small. The northern 
' side was secured by the steep banks of the brook, and round the 
east and south were deep artificial ditches, the whole fortification 
occupying nearly three Scots acres ; besides a draw-well. There 
may be still traced from the interior of the fortress, a subter- 
ranean vaulted passage, of height sufficient for horses, opening in

PRESBYTERY OF ELLON, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER PHILIP MINISTER. 



1 —Topography AND Natural History. 
JvT,,., -The name Cruden takes its rise from the battle fought 
therein the year 1005, by Malcolm II., and Canute, son of Sueno, 
KincT of Denmark and Norway. 

i;...-The length of the parish from the east, where it m ets 
the parish of Peterhead, to the west, where it meets the parish of 
EUr ar the House of Dudwick, is about 1 1 miles. The breadth 
at the west end is about 7 miles, at the east end about 4 mile. 
The sea is the boundary along the south side: the parishes of 
Ih n Logie Buchan, ad Ellon, along the west ; Old Deer and 
T Zs de along the north ; and Peterhead along the east 1 he 
Longside ' j ; Castle is bounded by high

War of Cruden, a small fishing village where vessels can occa- 
Inally bring coal and lime. From this place to Land End, a

distance of about two miles, is the Bay of Cruden, a fine sandy 
beach, at the south end of which a range of sunken rocks runs 
far into the sea, called the Scares of Cruden. The rocks from 
this place, all along the south, are black basalts, and very formi- 
dable. 

Climate. — The temperature of the atmosphere is, in general, 
sharp and piercing, especially when the wind blows from the sea. 
Not many years ago, a large mass of rock near Dunbay was 
shivered in pieces, and some parts of ft thrown a considerable dis- 
tance towards the land. There are springs of good water, and a 
few chalybeate ones. 

In ancient times, there were large forests of oak and hard-wood 
surrounding the parish. But now, only a few old trees remain in 
diflferent places, and these of very diminutive appearance. We 
have a few clumps of something like brushwood, and lately some 
plantations have been tried, which promise to succeed. 

II. — Civil History. 

 Proprietors.— It is with grief that the writer of this has to men- 
tion that the Earl of Errol's property in this parish is now greatly 
diminished. His Lordship is still the principal heritor. But 
there are now on the estates which formerly belonged to his fa- 
mily nine other proprietors. 

Parochial Registers — The parochial registers reach back only 
to the beginning of the eighteenth century. 

Manufactories. — The thread manufactories, which were so 
flourishing in the beginning of my day, and employed so many 
people, are now completely gone. A carding and spinnincr-mill 
was lately erected on the estate of Aquaharney, and carrFes on 
busmess to a considerable extent.

 There are no villages in the parish except those of Bullers-

Errol. There are only at present four residing heritors. The

The Iwelling-liouscs and accommodation of the tenants liave 
been much improved. They are all commodiously situated, and 
the farmers and people in general live very comfortably. Great 
improvements have been made by draining, and the general state 
of husbandry is in a respectable condition. 

Quarries.— The quarries of red granite, which some years ago 
were worked to a great extent, and which contributed to the solidity 
and beauty of some of the fine bridges on the Thames at London, 
are now completely deserted and given up. 

V. — Parochial Ecotsomy. 
We have two markets in the year, one in April, and the other 
in May, none of them of much consideration. There is a post- 
office "half-way between Ellon and Peterhead, on the turnpike 
road, the length of which in that direction is about seven miles. 
The harbourat the Ward can only be used in good weather. But 
a safe and useful one could be made close by. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church, which was built m the 
year 1776, stands in the middle of the parish. The heritors lately 
came forward in the most handsome manner and enlarged it, so as 
to make the extent of church accommodation equal to the wants 
of the congregation. It is now one of the most commodious and 
elegant churches in the synod. The number of communicants 
last vear was 840. The glebe and toft contains about 7 acres

PRESBYTERY OF TURRIFF, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. JAMES CRUICKSHANK, MINISTER. 



I- — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — Torra or Turra, as the name was anciently written, 
and is still vulgarly pronounced, is said to signify in the Gaelic lan- 
guage a mount or height, which is descriptive of the situation of 
the town ; while TurrefF or Turriff, derived from the same Ian- 
guage, signifies, we are told, " turrets or totoers ;"—m the me- 
mory of persons alive till lately, the remains of towers were to 
be seen, and those of one of them still exist in the gateway and 
vaults of an old and now almost ruinous building, known by the 
name of " Castle Rainy." 

Extent and Boundaries.— The mean length of the parish from 
north to south is 6 miles; and the mean breadth from west to 
east, miles,— thus making its superficial extent about 33 
square miles. From the site of the church to the extremities of 
the parish, the distance, on all sides except to the west, is so 
nearly equal, that a circle, of which the town is the centre, and 
the radius 4 miles, would include the whole of this parish, with 
a large part of that of Forglen, from which it is separated by the 
river Doveron. The other neighbouring parishes are Alvah and 
Kmg Edward, on the north ; Monquhitter, on the east ; Fyvie 
and Auchterless, on the south ; and Inverkeithnv, on the west. 

Topographical Appearances.— On the river "banks and level 
grounds, the prevaihng soil is an alluvial deposit of clay-slate or 
clay. In some places, it is sharp, light, and gravelly, and is very 
early and fertile. The aspect of the parish is, upon the whole 
beautiful; the ground rising from the Doveron towards the south' 



9S2 AlHiUDEENSHlUE. 

and east, till it terminates in gently undulating fields, bearing in 
general, in favourable seasons, abundant crops. The hills of Vrae 
on the north, Cotburn on the cast, Darra on the south, and Ard- 
middle on the west, are the most elevated. The town is very 
pleasantly situated, with a fine southern exposure; and although 
it cannot boast of its spacious and well-Cormed streets or lis public 
buildings, the houses are substantial, neat, and commodious, and 
surrounded by little gardens, tastefully laid out, display a degree 
of comfort and convenience which the inhabitants m general enjoy. 
Indeed, it has often been remarked by strangers, that Turriff ex- 
hibits fewer instances of poverty and wretchedness than most 
places of the same size. Within the last fifteen years, a consider- 
able addition was made to the extent and population of the town 
by two streets which were opened ; and it is rumoured that addi- 
tional feus are to be given off upon a more uniform and improved 
plan than has hitherto been followed. 

Lonacvitij.-ln the course of last summer, a woman died 
•in her 99ih vear; and there are now living in the parish, and 
in tolerable l/ealth, a few persons above 90, and a good many from

session are in their 87th year, and still take an active part in the 
discharge of their duties as elders. 

Hydrogrophi/.-The river Doveron, at its source called the 
Blackwater, takes its rise in the Cabrach, on the confines between 
the counties of Aberdeen and Banff. When it first enters this 
parish, after many beautiful windings from west to east, it changes 
its course below Mill of Turriff, and, taking a sudden turn towards 
the north, continues to flow in that direction till it discharges it- 
self into the Moray Frith at Banff. The only other s ream ot 
consequence which runs through the parish, is the burn of Turriff 
.vhich has its source on the farm of Little Byth, in the pansh f 
Aberdour, and which, before it reaches its termination and faU. 
into the Doveron, is of considerable size. In its passage o about 
wo and a-half miles through this parish, it works two meal mil , 
Zo carding and one flax mill, and the machinery of a bleachfield 
in the memorable flood of 1829, this burn became flooded to such 
' degree, that in the mill-house at, Mill of Turrifl, and ni some o 
lPses about the bleachfield, the water rose eight feet abo. 
Ii Lnr soles or eleven feet above its ordinary level. 1 here are

parishes, aiul which afford a sufficient supply of water for the various 
mills which have been erected in the line of their course. Through- 
out the parish, there are numerous perennial springs, and an abun- 
dance of excellent water, amply sufficient for all the purposes of 
life and industry. There are several mineral wells, but none of 
_them of any great celebrity. One of them, in the immediate 
neighbouthood of the town, has been rather famed for its medi- 
cinal properties, and has been denominated the " Physic Well." 
Another, on the opposite side of the burn, in the braes of Kinner- 
mitt, is slightly impregnated with carbonate of iron, and of use as a 
tonic, while on the north side of the parish, on the farms of Clay- 
mires, Hilton, and Fernystripe, there are springs of the same 
quality, but more powerful, as indicated by the dark and iron 
colour of the water which issues from them. There are other 
wells which are called Saints' wells, as one at Slap, known by the 
name of St John's Well, and St John's Well Stripe flowing from 
it, and dividing the farm of Slap from that of Slackadale. There 
is also a well on the estate of Gask which had been notable, and 
the virtues of which could not be secured but by a pecuniary of- 
fering to its patron, and hence the name of the farm where it 
exists, " Silverwells." In the brae of Laithers, and in the neigh- 
bourhood of a chapel, the foundation of which was some years 
ago removed by the plough, there was a well which was annually 
resorted to, on a particular day, by crowds from all quarters, the 
water of which was supposed to insure a continuance of health to 
those who enjoyed it, and to impart the blessing to such as were 
deprived of it. To these wells, and others scattered over the dis- 
trict, several peculiar qualities were ascribed, as being specially 
favoured by the saint to whom they were dedicated. But the time 
has gone by when such fanciful and superstitious notions have been 
in any degree entertained. 

Geology — The only two groups which form the parish are grey- 
wacke on the west, and old red sandstone on the east,— the space 
occupied by the former being about three times as large as that 
occupied by the latter. 

Grcywacke. — This group dilTers in many respects from its equi- 
valent of England and the south of Scotland, in our locality it 
consists of numerous alternations of greywacke, greywacke-slate, 
and clay-slate, all regularly stratified, inclined at high angles, and

frequently traversed by veins of milk quartz. The imbedded 
fragments in the greywacke consist of quartz, felspar, and occa- 
sionally clay-slate. The fragments are mostly angular, rarely 
water-worn, and never large. The basis is highly siliceous and 
compact, and never arenaceous, as is the case in the south. The 
greywacke-slate consists of the same minerals ; but the fragments, 
are small, and the basis partakes more of the nature of the clay- 
slate, into which the greywacke graduates. Fine sections of this 
5roup occur in the cliffs that skirt the Doveron, in the south- 
western angle of the parish, as well as in many of the gullies cut 
by the smaller streams, and in numerous quarries, where the rock 
is worked as a building stone, paving-flag, road metal, or for 
building drains, — a purpose for which its slaty character renders 
it especially fit. The greywacke does not in this district contain 
any of these subordinate layers of limestone so common in the 
south ; and no organic remains have hitherto been discovered in 
it. From the observations indicated on the sketch, it is apparent 
that the direction of the dip is very uniform over the parish, being 
in almost every instance east-south-east, at angles varying from 
•20° to 50°, 45° being about the average. 

Old Bed Sandstone.— K\ox\ the whole eastern side of the pa- 
rish, the greywacke is overlaid by sandstone and conglomerate. 
Fine sections of these rocks are seen in the various quarries, 
opposite to Delgaty Castle, where they have long been Avork- 
ed as a building stone. Although, in this parish, no single 
locality has been found where the denudation is extensive enough 
to show the greywacke and old red sandstone in conjunction, there 
can exist no do'ubt that the latter rests unconformably on the up- 
turned edges of the former,— a circumstance of which there is abun- 
dance of proof in the coast sections of the neighbouring parish. Gam- 
vie. The sandstones are of a dull-red colour, often micaceous, and 
with small spheres of a pale grey colour scattered through them. 
The conglomerates which are interstratified with the former con- 
sist almost entirely of primary boulders and gravel imbedded in an 
ironshot arenaceous basis. The direction of the dip varies from 
north-north-east to west-south-west, perhaps west-north-west is 
the most frequent. The angle of the dip varies from 15° at the 
south Delgaty quarry, to 40° on the Craigston burn. These 
sandstones and conglomerates obviously belong to Dr Malcolm- 
lawest subdivision of ihc old red termed the great conglome-

rate. No representative of the Gamrie fish bed has been met with in 
the parish, although, from the close resemblance of the dark inhe- 
rent conglomerate seen at Darra and Gask, to that which over- 
lies the fossiliferous strata of Gamrie, it is not improbable that fu- 
ture researches may be rewarded by the discovery of this most in- 
teresting deposit. The sandstones and conglomerates of Delgaty 
afford the greater part of the building stone of which the houses 
in the town of Turriff, as well as those of the neighbouring pro- 
prietors, are composed. Coping stones, and ashlar for mill 
courses, are also quarried for the use of many adjacent parishes. 
In Conn's quarry fifteen men on an average are employed, and 
the tacksmen drive a considerable trade. Quarriers earn 12s. to 
14s. per week, and dressers L.l. Dressed rybats and corners 
are sold at 6d. per foot; copings, 7d. per running foot; stones 
for mill courses, 6d.; rubble for dikes, &amp;c. 3d. per load. 

Superficial Layers.— To give a detailed account of these lasers 
would exceed the limits of the present notice. They are in ge- 
neral similar to those occurring along most of the east coast, and 
are, according to some, the moraines clay and gravel left by gla- 
ciers. According to others, they are chiefly the produce of vast 
water currents. On an eminence west-north-west of Delgaty 
Castle, there is found a rather peculiar bed of gravel. The sur- 
face of the pit presents a covering of three feet of liaht-brown 
ochry clay, under which rests the gravel bed, eight to ten feet 
thick. ihe boulders are all water-worn, and consist chiefly of 
the purest milk quartz, mixed with very white micaceous sand. 
Among the moss, water-worn chalk flints occur, sparingly contain- 
ing the usual chalk fossils. This forms the western termination 
ot the Buchan chalk flints discovered by Dr Knight, and consi- 
dered by h.m as transported by ice. This interesting deposit de- 
serves more attention, as likely to modify considerably the recent 
views ot Professor Agassiz. 

Attempts at different times, and very lately, have been made to 
open on the Craig-brae of Laithers a quarry of roofing slates; 
but, though appearances were favourable, and slates of tolerably 
good quality were obtained, the labour and expense were found 
extent' prosecuted to any

the woods and water sides. The following list contains plants 
worthy of notice, either as regards the district or the parish. 
Most of them occur on the south bank of the Doveron, and on

To the above list may be added, as the less common species

in this parish by Mr Alexander Murray, the intelligent tenant of 
Burnside of Delgaty, and well known for his botanical taste and 
general information : — . -

Zoohgy.-Th\s parish is not distinguished by any of the_ rarer 
species of animals. Roe-deer are frequently to be seen ,n the 
v' ods, and during winter do much injury to the trees, by str.ppmg 
them of their bark. Of late, since the Earl of Kmtore had a 
hunting-seat at Gask, foxes have become numerous; -ff''f 
• occasional depredations are committed, the kindness of the Noble 
Lord, and his attention to the interests of the tenantry m other 
■ respects, with his generosity to the parochial poor, make ample 
: n ent for any foss sustained by the attacks of the wdy enemy 
f the poultry yaJd. Wild cats, badgers, and some of the wea:. 
tribe, with mice, rats, and moles, are common, and the hare a d 
abb t in very great abundance. Grouse are not plentifu ; though, 
on the Waggle Hill, in the immediate neighbourhood, a young 
"en leman,'fhis season, bagged twelve brace on the 12th o 
itL Partridges are numerous; and of late, that beauufu 
b1 d t e pheasant, has found its way from Duff House Par , or 
the grounds at Fyvie Castle, and is now frequently to be seen.

cellent sport to the angler, and is much resorted to by the school- 
boy and several of the more aged inhabitants, who show astonishing 
dexterity in an art which, in their early days, had been a favourite 
recreation. At one time, the salmon-fishing in this parish was of 
considerable value ; but, owing to the indefatigable exertions,of 
the fishermen at the river mouth, and the difficulty of escape by 
the construction of the cruive dikes, the fishing is not now prose- 
cuted to any extent or advantage. 

Plantations. — There are nearly 3000 imperial acres under wood, 
700 of which have been planted within the last thirty years. The 
trees most generally planted, are, larch, spruce, Scotch firs, and 
alders, intermixed with several kinds of hard-wood ; as beech, oak, 
elm, ash, &amp;c. ; while around the more ancient seats of the pro- 
prietors, there are some fine old planes, horse-chestnuts, and elms 
of great height and beauty. At present, there prevails among 
the different heritors, a great taste for planting; and there can be 
no doubt, from the congeniality of the soil, and its adaptation for 
the various species of trees, as proved by their rapidity of growth, 
and the thriving condition of the wood, with the judicious situa- 
tions chosen for planting, that, in the course of a few years, the 
face of the parish will assume a very different aspect, that the 
soil and climate will be most materially improved, and the interest 
of the proprietors most essentially advanced. In regard to ma- 
nagement, it is pleasing to observe that greater attention is being 
paid to the mode of planting at first, and to regular thinning af- 
terwards than formerly was the case; that the plants are not so 
much crowded on each other ; that those of an inferior or of a 
less healthy kind are carefully removed in due time ; and that the 
pruning-knife is freely applied when necessary, and the ground 
always properly protected from the inroads of cattle. 

11. — Civil History. 
_ Antiquities.— ¥vom the absence of historical documents, it is 
impossible to say when the town of Turriff was founded; but it is 
evidently a place of considerable antiquity, and had been of some 
note in a former age. " It is highly probable," as mentioned in 
the last Statistical Report, " that Lathmon, the Pictish prince 
whom Ossian celebrates, had his seat in this parish. Not only 
do Laithers and Dorlaithers bear a strong resemblance to Lath, 
mon and Dunlathmon, but the landscape drawn by nature ex- 
actly corresponds with the description of the poet. We may ob 
serve, on the bank of the river, « the green dwelling of LathLn ' 



988 



ABERDEENSHIRE. 



We may wander ' with the blue-eyed Cutha in the vales of Dun- 
lathmon :' ' high walls rise on the bank of Durranna, and see their 
mossy towers in the stream.' A rock ascends behind them with 
'its bending firs.' " 

There is every reason to believe that the Knights Templar 
who, though they had but one settlement in Scotland, St Germain 
in Lothian, yet enjoyed the funds of several churches and houses 
in other parts of the country, were established here. On the 
south side of the town, there is a spot of ground called the Temple 
Brae, and a house called Temple Feu, the old proprietors of 
which held their charters from the Lords Torphichen, to whom 
a considerable part of their lands had been given by the Crown, 
after the order of the Knights Templar was dissolved in the be- 
ginning of the fourteenth century. 

Some houses called Abbey Land,  Maison DieuJ, or house of 
refuge, point out the situation of an hospital or alms-house, which 
Was founded in 1272 by Alexander Cumyn, Earl of Buchan, with 
consent of Hugo de Benham, Bishop of Aberdeen, for maintaining 
a warden, six chaplains, and thirteen poor husbandmen of Buchan. 
It was dedicated to St Congan, f Sancto Congano, supposed to 
be the tutelary saint of the place, from whom one of the annual 
fairs held here is called Cowan Fair. It was afterwards endowed 
by King Robert Bruce, by a charter granted by him at Kinkell 
in 1329, and the twenty-third year of his reign, with the lands of 
Pets, " in puram et perpetuam eleemosynam pro anima Nigelli 
de Bruys fratris nostri." In 1412, Bishop Greenlaw erected the 
wardancy here into a prebend. Mr William Hay, Canon of Aber- 
deen, and Prebendary of Turriff, the first master who enjoyed 
these tides, built the mansion in the chanonry for the residence 
of himself and successors, and of which the trades of Old Aber- 
deen are now the proprietors. 

In the year 1446, William Hay of Errol obtained the patron- 
aae of the church of Turriff in lieu of that of Errol, of which his 
grandfather Sir William Hay of Errol had been deprived. There 
is a confirmation of this grant by James II., dated 16th May 1450. 
In 1497, the lands of the hospital were alienated by Alexander 
Wans, parson of the parish, to Gilbert Hay of Delgaty, with con- 
sent of the Earl of Errol the patron. In 151 1, James IV. out ot 
love and favour to Mr Thomas Dickson, then prebend of lurriH, 
granted him a charter erecting Turriff into a burgh of barony, 
constituting the prebend superior of the burgh, and titular ot He 



TURRIFl'.

teinds, and giving power to the burgesses, with the consent of the 
prebend, to choose yearly, baiHes and other office-bearers, for the 
government of the burgh, with a right also to the burgesses and 
inhabitants to hold weekly markets at the Market Cross on Sun- 
day, and public fairs at the fast of St Peter, called Lammas, and 
at St Congan, with the whole tolls, liberties, and privileges of 
free markets. In 1546, Master William Hay succeeded to the 
prebend of Turriff, in which he continued until his death in 1582, 
and was buried in the north-east side of the church, where his 
tombstone may still be seen. Among the professors whom 
Erskine of Dun ejected from the University of Aberdeen in 1568, 
was Mr Thomas Austin, Augustinus or Ogston. He retired to 
his native place, Turriff, where he died in 1592, having acted for 
twenty-four years in the double capacity of clergyman and school- 
master. It would appear that James VI. passed a night in Tur- 
riff on the 22d April 1589, but, as his Majesty's visit was rather 
accidental, with the exception of the honour conferred on the town 
by the King's presence, we do not find that he showed his favour 
for it by any other mark of royal regard. 

Down to 1627, certain lands were held by the parson of Tur- 
riff as kirk lands, but in that year Mr Thomas Mitchell, parson of 
Turriff, with the sanction of the Bishop of Aberdeen, the Earl of 
Errol and others, granted a charter of these lands to Francis Hay, 
son of Francis, Earl of Errol. Mr Mitchell was formerly minis- 
ter at Logie-Buchan, and, in consideration of his being presented 
to the parish kirk of Turriff, he, in thankful remembrance there- 
of, obliges himself to ratify his feu infeftment of the town and 
lands of Turriff, Knockiemill, and others, as also his tacks of the 
teinds of said parish, and not to come in the contrair under the 
penalty of L.3000. The obligation is dated 29th June 1624. 
Mr Mitchell was an Episcopalian and Royalist in the beginning of 
the civil wars. In the volume of sermons and elegies on the 
death of Bishop Patrick Forbes, we find some dolorous verses bv 
Mitchell. One of the couplets runs thus, 

" Some for their David dool'd, some for tlieir temple grat, 
Some for Josias shouted, in the valley of Josaphat." 

Soon after this period, he became a zealous Corenanter. Spald- 
ing, the local annalist of the proceedings of the day, states, that 
at the " Trot of Turriff" in 1639, at which skirmish by the way, 
the first blood, was shed that flowed so abundantly during the next 
twenty years, the loyalist barons, after dispersing the Committee

ABERDEENSHIRE. 



of the Tables there assembled, "comes immediately back to 
Turriff, takes meat and drink at their pleasure, and fears Mr 
Thomas Mitchell, minister at Turriff, very evill." In 1G42, we 
find from the same chronicler, that the said Mr Thomas Mitchell 
was accused before the provincial assembly of Aberdeen, of a very 
heinous oflfence against religion and morality, and that the assem- 
bly appointed a committee of thirteen ministers and eight ruling 
elders to take cognizance of this matter. After due investiga- 
tion, it is satisfactory to be informed " that Mr Mitchell was ab- 
solvit from this scandal, and found a good barne." 

The grammar school of Turriff seems at an early period to 
have enjoyed a considerable reputation. The celebrated Demps- 
ter who was born in 1579, received the first rudiments of his edu- 
cat'ion at Turriff, " lum Turravise sub ferula plagiosi Andreas 
OcTstoni tircinium exercuit." On the 7th October 1546, Andrew 
Hay, rector of Turriff, with consent of George Earl of Errol, and 
William Hay, canon of the cathedral church at Aberdeen, granted 
a charter on seven roods of land lying on the west side of the town, 
to the chaplain and master of the grammar school in Turriff. 
And at a subsequent period, Mr Andrew Skene, prebend, to pro- 
mote the interests of education, made over the customs of the 
markets to the Earl of Errol, on condition that he should pay an- 
nually L.lOO Scots, as salary to a schoolmaster, which salary has 
been regularly paid by the proprietors of Delgaty, who have the 
ricrht of presenting to the office. 

°The Earls of Errol, who resided at the castle of Delgaty, had 
also, it would appear, a lodging in the town of Turriff, which pro- 
bably was the " forehouse, hall, and chambers, disponed by Iho- 
mas Mowat," and which, after changing many occupants, is now 
the property of Mr Norman Gordon, bank agent, and still retain- 
inff by way of distinction from any other premises, the charac- 
teristic name of " the Lodging." For about 350 years immedi- 
ately preceeding 1762, the family of Errol were superiors of lur- 
riff and from that family several of the present feuars hold the 
charters which give them a right to the tenements they possess 
and ground attached thereto, and for which they pay an annual 
feu-duty of six denarii, or one half-penny Sterhng. 

Ancient and Present Proprietors.-The Cumines Earls of Bu- 
chan, are the most remote proprietors of whom any thmg is known, 
but the precise time when they acquired their extensive estates in 
this parish cannot be exactly ascertained.

Delgaty, by much the largest and most valuable property in the 
parish, when it went out of the hands of the Errol family, eighty 
years ago, was bought by Peter Garden, Esq., and sold by his 
son, Francis, in 1798 to the late James Earl of Fife, 

In 1723, the estate of Balquholly was sold by the Mowats, to 
whom Robert I. granted the lands of Lescragy, Co|p, &amp;c.  to 
Alexander Duff of Hatton, whose grandson. Garden Duff, Esq. 
is the present proprietor. 

In 1726, the estate of Fintray, then belonging to the Forbeses 
of Touchon, was bought by Lord Braco, and is now the property 
of his grandson, the Earl of Fife. 

The estates of Laithers and Dorlaithers, which had been long 
in the possession of Dempster of Auchterless and others, and 
more recently of John Morison, Esq. is now subdivided, and has 
become the property of Alexander Stuart, John Adam, Alexander 
Rae, Alexander Bremner, James, Donald, and George Chalmers, 
Esquires, and of the Reverend Messrs William Robinson Pirie, 
James Milne, and John Webster. 

The estate of Towie, which had been the property of the Bar- 
clays for 400 years and upwards, was sold by a descendant of that 
family to the Earl of Findlater, whose son sold it in 1762, to 
the managers of Gordon's Hospital, and the Infirmary at Aber- 
deen, and it continues to be held by them. 

In 1767, the estate of Muiresk was disposed of by James Broi 
die to Alexander Diron, sheriff-substitute of Banffshire, and, 
after passing through different hands, now belongs to James Bro- 
die Spottiswood, Esq. 

Gask, which belonged of old to the Forbeses, and more lately 
to the Forrlyces, afterwards to J. Mackie, G. Robinson, and Wil- 
liam Rose, Esquires, was purchased by James Earl of Fife about 
forty years ago, and remains in his family. 

The lands of Plaidy in this parish are the property of William 
Urquhart, Esq. of Craigston, whose principal estate and residence 
are situated in the adjoining parish of King-Edward.

Old Church.— T:he date of its erection is not certamly known, 
but it is supposed to have been built by Malcolm Canmore in the 
eleventh century. At all events, it evidently had been used as a 
place of worship before the Reformation. It was so constructed, 
that, however strong the lungs and powerful the voice of the speak- 
er, the great body of the worshippers could not possibly hear dis- 
tinctly, the length being 120, and the breadth 18 feet. In 1794, 
a new church, of which notice will be afterwards taken, was erect- 
ed, and there now only remain of the ancient fabric, around which 
is the burying-ground'of the parish, the eastern part of the budd- 
ino- called « the quire," and the belfry, which is rather a handsome 
piece of architecture, and contains a fine-toned bell, bearing the 
date 1557, and which, after having been removed for thirty-iour 
years to the present church, was restored to its former position in 
1828, when a clock was purchased by public subscription. 

In the churchyard are several ancient monuments, chiefly with 
Latin inscriptions, worthy of record and preservation. The most 
interesting are those to the memory of Barbara Mowat who died 
3d May 1558, and her husband, William Lindsay, 28th March

On the haugh of Laithers, opposite the Boat of Magie, were 
lately to be seen the remains of a chapel, which was said to have 
been dedicated to St Carnac. May not this St Carnac have been 
the Carnac who was one of the bishops of Mortlach before the 
Episcopal seat was translated to Aberdeen, and when this parish 
was probably in the diocese of Mortlach  Carnac died anno 
1 125. 

Tumuli, upright stones, and cairns are visible on the more ele 
vated ground of the parish, and on the hill of Ardmiddle on the 
south-west side, of Colp on ihe south-east, and of Braccans and 
Burnside of Delgaty on the east, urns, with calcined bones, have 
been found ; and, as it is well known, that, about the end of the 
tenth or begmning of the eleventh century, this district was much 
molested by the hostile invasions of the Danes, it may be sup- 
posed, that, to commemorate the victories gained over them by 
the chief of Buchan, Indulf, and Malcolm H., these monuments 
were erected to mark the spot of some signal achievement, or the 
restmg.place and dust of some distinguished combatant. Flint 
arrow-heads and fragments of arms have also been dug up in va- 
rious places, with silver and copper coins of great antiquity and 
curious character. 

Parochial Registers.~The register of baptisms commences in 
1697, and of births and baptisms in 1797. These registers, it is 
to be regretted, are very defective, and, notwithstanding the nu- 
merous advantages of a correct record, and the trouble, expense 
and loss to which parties are frequently subjected by the neglect,' 
there is such remissness in this respect somewhere, that it would 
perhaps be well if a legislative measure, somewhat similar in it« 
provisions to the Registration Act for England, were extended to 
iscotland. 1 he register of marriages begins in 1 727, and is kenf 
- y-egu arity. There is a register of discipline comenlg n 
iolG, but none of deaths.  

There is a cross in the principal street of considerable antiquity 
at which, It would appear, the sheriff of the county occasionally 
h Id h,s courts ,n former times. In the year 1557, an inquest w s

George Crichton of Little Forg ; Alexander Con of Auchry; 
Thomas Con, his son; John Grant of Ballindalloch ; Patrick Grant 
of Dalvey; and John Irvine in Turreff. Through the lapse of 
time, the structure, consisting of an upright pillar of hewn stone, 
raised on a pedestal of circular steps, and measuring 20 feet from 
the ground to the top, had become almost ruinous ; but, with a 
due regard for this remnant of antiquity, it was last year repaired, 
with a slight alteration on its form, and may now long remain to 
mark a spot which, perhaps, in a former age, had been of no mean 
importance. 

Mansion-Houses, -..-Delgaty Castle, the residence of Gene- 
ral the Honourable Sir Alexander Duff, is a fine specimen of an 
old baronial mansion. This ancient and venerable pile, which is 
situated on the eastern side of the parish, has been built at ditte- 
rent periods. One of the dates of its erection is 1579. The ori- 
ginal style is still happily preserved ; and, while it exhibits all the 
grandeur of a feudal age, now affords, under its gallant and hos- 
pitable occupant, all the comforts, conveniences, and refinements 
of modern times. It consists of a lofty castellated square build- 
ing, 66 feet high. The walls are 7 feet 4 inc-hes thick, vvuth col- 
lonades and wings recently and judiciously attached. Ihe view 
from the top of the castle is commanding, the grounds tastelully 
laid out, the gardens extensive, and the green-house rich with 
choice flowers and plants. There is a lake well stocked with fish, 
and a small island in its centre, approached by a rustic bridge, all in 
such excellent keeping as to render Delgaty one of the most beau- 
tiful seats in Aberdeenshire. The rooms are spacious and hand- 
somely furnished, particularly the two drawing-roorns, one of which 
is 34 feet in length by 20 feet in breadth, and the other 24 by 
14 feet, and connected by folding doors. There are a few good 
paintings by ancient masters; and two portraits, one of A exander 
last Earl of Fife, and another of his second son, Sir Alexander 
Duff, which are good likenesses. 

Hatton Castle, the seat of Garden Duff, Esq. lies on the sou I - 
east side of the parish, and is delightfully situated. It is a v y 
substantial and commodious edifice, of a quadrangular orm wuh 
corner turrets. A remnant of the ancient residence of the pro- 
prietors of Balquholly was preserved when the castle was complet- 
ed in 1«14; and, while its outward appearance is handsome and 
attractive, the internal accommodation is no less convenient and ele-

gant. The lawn in front of the castle is here and there adorned with 
trees and clumps tastefully arranged. The grounds, shrnbberies, 
and garden are well laid out, and contain a variety of such plants 
and shrubs, native and exotic, as are hardy enough to withstand 
the seventy of the winter. Two approaches, which meet at a 

■ well chosen pomt, with two neatly constructed lodges and arti- 
ficial lakes, in which the stately swans and cygnets are seen 
moving majestically on the surface of the water, happily unite in 
. giving to this domain much to please the eye and gratify the taste 
It may be here remarked, that, if the etymology of the ancient 
name BalquhoUy" be correct, viz. " the house in the wood," 
Hatton Castle has a just claim to its former appellation, beina- 

embosomed in wood of rich variety, and sheltered, in a great mea"- 

sure, from every wind that blows. 

MuM.~On the south bank of the Doveron, and about a 

mile to the west of Turriff, stands the mansion- house of Mui e k 

which, though not large, is, from natural situation, and the r ce„; 

Scobbach House, which is erected on a commanding situation 

ng bu m a .tyle of ancient architecture. At present, it has ra- 
he a bare and dingy appearance; but when the wood ge s\ p

The lofty hall, with its remains of architectural grandeur, is in to- 
lerable preservation, and is a fine specimen of the Gothic vaulted 
style. The ornaments are elaborate, and this remnant of a struc- 
ture, which, in its original state, had been on a magnificent scale, 
shows the rank and status which, in a former age, its proprietors 
enjoyed. 

Over the once chief entry to the house of Towie is the follow- 
ing inscription : — 

Sir Alexander Barclay of 
Tolly Foundator decessit Anno Domini 1136. 
in tim of valth all men 
Sims frendly — an Frind is not 
knawin but in adversity, 1593. 

Nothwithstanding of the first-mentioned date in the above inscrip- 
tion, it is believed that the castle was not built before 1593, while 
there are dates 1604 and 1695 on the more modern parts of 
the building. The Barclays seem to have mingled in the frays of 
the time, and are frequently mentioned in Pitcairn's Criminal 
Trials. They also produced some learned men, and have risen 
to eminence and distinction in Russia, where Prince Barclay de 
Tolly, an offshoot from the house of Towie, illustrated and ex- 
tended the fame of this ancient Scottish name and family. 

III. — Population. 
In the town and parish of Turriff, the population has been pro- 
gressively increasing. According to the census of 1821, it amount- 
ed to 2406 ; in 1831, it rose to 2807 ; and, by the last survey, 
which was taken with the utmost care, it appears that there were 
in the town 571 males, 738 females, total 1309 ; and ,n the land- 
ward part of the parish, 925 males, 912 females, total 1837,-mak- 
inT the entire population 3146 ; so that an increase to the amount 
of''740 has taken place within the last twenty years. 

Belonging to the parish there are 2 persons subject to aberra- 
tion of mind, but not furious or unmanageable ; 1 person fatuous ; 
2 blind ; and 1 deaf and dumb. 

Character of the People.-ln general, the people are moial m 
their conduct, obliging and neighbourly among tl--elves k. 
and charitable to the poor, and attentive and hospitable to Strang 

'"The great majority are strongly attached to the Church of Scot- 
land as by law 'established, and, to their credit, we record 
fl ts, that while they are regular in their attendance on the pu 
services of the sanctuary, and the ordinance, ofreligion, they hvc

ill the utmost harmony with those who differ from them, and have 
hitherto been able, amid much contention, to preserve ' the unity 
of the spirit in the bond of peace."

The whole parish occupies a rising ground of greater or less 
degrees of elevation. In some places, the ground ascends to a 
considerable altitude above the surrounding valleys, and descends 
by an easy inclination, presenting a variety of table-land, sloping 
in different directions. Some of the farms are of large extent, 
under the management of enlightened, enterprizing, and skilful 
tenants, who have not failed to introduce the numerous improve- 
ments in the science of agriculture, which experience has proved 
to be advantageous. The crops commonly cultivated are, sown 
grasses, oats, bear and barley, turnips and potatoes, with occa- 
sionally a few tares. The course generally pursued is the five 
and seven shift, but especially the latter, being three grasses and 
two white crops for the seven, and two grasses and one white crop 
for the five; the ground being carefully cleaned by turnips or po 
tatoes, followed by a crop of oats or barley, and laid down with 
grass and clover seeds. 

Turnip husbandry is very successfully practised, and the Swe- 
dish variety, so beneficial in the end of the season, thrives parti- 
cularly well. 

PVaste Land.~The improvement of waste land has been carried 
on in this parish for the last twelve years, with great vigour. Mj- 
James Murray, brother of the present tenant at Burnside of Del- 
gaty received the silver medal from the Highland Society of 
Scotland, for the extent of waste land he brought into a state of 
cultivation, while the tenants on the Delgaty property and else- 
where have successfully followed his example. 

Machines and Implements.— When the last Statistical Report 
was drawn up in 1794, there were only three thrashing-mills in 
the parish ; now there are sixty-three, and when it can possibly be

obtained, they are driven by water. Since their first introduction 
into this quarter, a variety of improvennents in their construction , 
have been progressively made by native mechanics,— all tendmg 
to simplify the labour, and to augment the quantity of the work 
performed. The different processes of thrashing, shakmg, and 
winnowing by the same machinery, are now all at once performed, 
and the corn immediately prepared for the public market. The 
quantity of grain thrashed in a given time must of course depend 
on its quality, the length of the straw, and the power by which 
the machine is wrought; but a ihrashing-machine was a few years 
acTo erected by Mr William Murray, Slap, a very skilful practical 
farmer in this parish, which will easily thrash and clean m an hour 
from eighteen to twenty quarters of oats. 

The°fanners, which at no remote period were unknown, the 
grain having been separated from the chaff by the action of the 
wind between the two doors of a barn, are now m common use. 
Harrows and rollers, drilling and sowing-machines, and wheel-car- 
riages, have been much improved, and from the mgenuity and 
skill of the mechanics, have tended, in no small degree, to dimi- 
nish the labour, and render the land more productive. Ploughs, 
both of iron and wood, though more generally of iron, have been 
brought to a great degree of perfection by the artisans of the dis- 
trict.° A simple, but exceedingly beneficial improvement on the 
common plough has been made by Mr Rae of Ardmiddle, and, 
as it may be easily adopted, his own account of it is subjoined m 
ci not©  

Manures.— Ume, as an extraneous stimulant, has long been 
extensively employed. It has sometimes been injudiciously ap- 
plied, and, by an overdose, the land in some places has been lite- 
rally burned. Now, however, its power and qualities are better

understood, and the good effects of a moderate application suffi- 
ciently evident. Of late, bone-dust has been much used, and va- 
riously and successful. y applied ; sometimes by itself, and some- 
times along with a proportion of farm-yard dung or sulphuric acid. 
-Splendid crops of turnips have been raised, followed by a good 
green crop, and a rich and close crop of grass ; and as hence a 
greater number of cattle can be maintained, there is at the far- 
mer's command a much larger portion of sure enriching matter. 
Guano, which is so highly recommended, is being introduced. 

Breeds of Cattle. — Great attention has been lately paid to the 
improvement of the breeds of cattle. Several of the proprietors 
and farmers have, at a very considerable expense, procured ani- 
mals of the first quality, and of well known and acknowledged pe- 
digree. The far-famed Aberdeenshire dodded breed, originally 
from Fifeshire, generally prevail, and are carefully preserved by 
many of the tenantry in all their purity. Within the last few 
years, the Teeswater or short-horned have been introduced, and 
a cross betwixt the Aberdeenshire cow and short-horned bull 
highly prized. In consequence of the conveyance by steam, and 
the triumph of science over time and space, feeding for the Lon- 
don market has become common ; and as the great object of the 
rmer must naturally be to select such breeds as promise in the 
shortest time to bring the highest remunerating price, this system 
of crossmg, which brings cattle in three years to a greater weight 
and a higher price than those of the- native breed can reach in 
four years, prevail over this parish and district to a considerable 
extent. But many intelligent agriculturists, doubting the propriety 
of persevering in this system, and being apprehensive of such a 
degeneracy m the stock as might ultimately destroy the purity of 
both breeds, are at pains to keep them quite distinct, and will no 
doubt be guided ultimately by the result of their experiments. 

Oxen are now rarely yoked in the plough, though about the 
end of_ last century, it was not only the general practice, but an 
indication that the owner was a person of substance when he had 
ten of these in a plough, and, besides the ploughman, had gades- 
man whistling by their side. 

Horses.~T\xB improvement in the breed of horses has kept pace 
ith that of black-cattle, and no trouble or expense has been spared 
to raise their character to a level with those of Clydesdale. The 
Highland Society of Scotland and district associations have, for a 
good many years, been giving premiums for the best horses • and 



looo 



ABEUDEENSHIRE, 



several of oar public spirited agriculturists have, at these exhibitions, 
brought forward animals of such bone and symmetry as have entitled 
them to receive the promised prizes. There is also to be found a 
considerable number of an old breed of small-sized horses, for 
which this part of the country was at one time famous, and which 
were strong, healthy, and long-lived. 

Sheep.— The parish is not a sheep district. Those in it are 
mostly of the Cheviot breed. During the winter, shepherds come 
from the Highlands of Aberdeenshire with considerable flocks of 
black-faced sheep, and occupy the hilly ground in this and the 
adjoining parishes, moving from the one to the other as the wea- 
ther and keep may direct. 

As a large proportion of this parish is of a dry and open texture, 
it would probably be well if a portion of the turnips were consumed 
on the ground by sheep. 

Pirs.—Vigs are reared in considerable numbers, and form an 
important article of produce. They are mostly of the small Chi- 
nese breed, and are sold to pork-curers in Turriff, and by them 
sent to the London market. Last season, Mr Alexander Morrison, 
who carries on an extensive general business, cured and exported 
pork to the value of upwards of L.3000 Sterling. 

Wages and Rate of Labour.— The wages of good ploughmen, 
who are chiefly unmarried, and live and eat in their master's 
house, are, for the winter half year, from L.5 to L.6 ; and during 
the summer half year, from L.6 to L.7. Foremen, and those 
who are expected to have a certain superintendence uver the other 
servants, though not exactly holding the situation of grieves 
or overseers, realize a little more. The wages of boys, lads, 
and other supernumeraries, range from L. 1, 10s. to L.3, 10s. 
Women's wages vary according to their character, to which, at the 
time of engagement, a much greater regard is paid than to that of 
the other sex. Notable female servants, either for domestic 
or out-door work, may get L. 2, 5s. or L. 2, 10s. m the half 
year ; and those of an inferior grade about one-half that amount. 
It is matter of regret that this very interesting portion of the po- 
pulation is by no means in a healthy state, and that a demoralizing- 
system, adopted, no doubt, for convenience and, perhaps, economy, 
has in several of our large agricultural establishments been intro- 
duced,-we mean « the bothy system,"-which, if not abandon- 
ed, or checked and placed under proper control, must eventually 



\ 



TURIUFF. 



1001 



bring with it a train of evils alike prejudicial to the temporal inte- 
rests of master and servant, and assuredly most injurious to the 
spiritual interests of the latter, a large and valuable class of the 
community. 

Jobs, such as trenching, ditching, harvesting the crop, &amp;c., 
are sometimes undertaken on very low terms, and are not always 
very well executed ; though when the contractor is not limited to 
time, he can regulate his hours at pleasure, and take advantage 
of such favourable circumstances as may occur for fulfilling his bar- 
gain. 

The wages of tradesmen are the same here as throughout the 
country. Masons generally get 2s. 6d. or 2s. 9d. per day ; car- 
penters, 2s. or 2s. 3d. ; and tailors, shoemakers, &amp;c. in proportion 
to their diligence and skill. 

Enclosing. — Some of the largest and best farms in the parish 
are enclosed; and this improvement, so important to the mixed 
husbandry, is in the course of being extended. The fences are 
dry stone dikes, about four feet high, the materials of which are 
mostly dug from the quarries. Wooden paling is sometimes 
used, and thorn hedges have, in a few instances, been planted ; 
but the latter, though forming a beautiful fence, and giving a soft 
and clothed aspect to the country, as shown by the Earl of Fife's 
hedges between Turriff and Banff, require such care, and labour, 
and skill in keeping, which the tenant cannot easily afford, that 
they have not thriven where attempted, and are now very seldom 
planted. 

Drozwm;/.— Drains have been executed to a considerable ex- 
tent, both open and covered. For the latter, small stones are 
collected off the fields, tumbled out of a cart into the drain, and 
over a covering of brushwood, the earth is restored to the surface. 
But as draining is unquestionably the first of a long series of im- 
provements, which it would be vain to attempt without it, as it is 
considered equivalent, not only to a change of soil, but also of cli- 
mate, both in reference to the growth of plants and the health of 
the population, it is to be hoped that the practical benefits of 
draining will lead to a more efficient system than has hitherlo 
been adopted. The discovery of Lord James Hay, and which 
has stood the test imposed by the Highland Society, will, we 
doubt not, give a stimulus to draining, and be found to be one of 
the most valuable of modern agricultural improvements. The 



1002 



ABERDEENSHIRE. 



ingredients of his Lordship's drain-tiles are, lime, sharp sand, and 
gravel or small stones, and in the following proportions: one bu- 
shel of lime-shells, two and a-half bushels of sand, and four 
bushels of gravel, will give eight bushels of the composition 
allowing half a bushel for the swelling of the lime by the appli- 
cation of water, and will make 120 tiles of one foot in length. 
These tiles can be easily and cheaply manufactured, and come 
recommended by every consideration that the agriculturist could 
desire. 

Farni-Houses. — The farm-houses and buildings have been 
greatly improved of late years, many of them being built with 
stone and lime, and slated. The internal accommodation has 
also undergone a favourable change. The arrangements between 
the proprietor and the tenant in regard to houses are not uniform. 
In some instances, the tenant is allowed a sum equal to two years' 
rent ; but as this is either not paid till the termination of the lease, 
or if advanced by the proprietor at the commencement, interest is 
charged at the rate of five per cent, such encouragement cannot 
be considered great. A more common practice, however, is, that 
the heritor allows the necessary rough wood, while the tenant exe- 
cutes, at his own expense, all the other parts of the work, receiving 
an obligation for payment at the end of bis lease, according to the 
valuation at that time. By this plan, much the larger amount is 
advanced by the tenant, which, if he has sufficient capital, may 
perhaps answer as well for him, but if he has not money at com- 
mand, it may be the means of crippling him at the outset, and 
creating a burden which he is ill able to bear. The cottages 
scattered up and down the parish scarcely correspond with the 
comfortable dwellings of the farmers. They are in general built 
of mud, ill-constructed, ill-ventilated, and ill-roofed ; and when a 
Mrs M'Clarty, as sometimes happens, is the presiding inmate, 
neatness and cleanliness are not their characteristics. There are, 
however, exceptions to be found even among the most lowly habi- 
tations, and the tidy mother and healthy offspring, with the well- 
swept hearth and white-washed wall and sanded floor, give an air 
of comfort and contentment exceedingly pleasing. 

Leases, c— The ordinary duration of leases is nineteen years, 
and the rents paid generally in money, with a small proportion of 
meal, sometimes in kind, but now very commonly at the fiar prices 
of the county. The tenant is bound to the rules of good hus-

1003 



bandry; but is not much interfered with in his mode of manatye- 
ment, unless when some unfair dealing appears. 

Produce. — It is somewhat difficult to state correctly the gross 
value of the produce of this parish, as the land in different loca- 
lities varies so much in quality and value ; but the following may 
be taken as not far from a fair estimate of the annual average 
amount of produce of the arable land : — 

0-187 acres of oats, at quarters per acre — 24,6914 quarters, 

at L.l, 8s. 3id/ . . . L.34,96-2 9 df 

32-2 do. of barley, at 44 qrs. per do — 1449 qrs., at L. 1 , 9s. 1 1 id. 2303 6 ] 

19364 do. of hay, at 130 stones per do.— 231,745 st., at 7d. per st. 7342 ] 1 3 

8873 do. of pasture, at L.l per acre, . . 3873 0 0 

163| do. of potatoes, at L. 7, 10s. per acre, . J 226 5 0 

1773 do. ol turnips, at L.5 per acre, , . 8865 0 0 



■L.58,572 11 lOia 

This amount, large as it seems to be, when applied in payment 
of rent, wages, and maintenance of servants and labourers, trades- 
men's bills, interest of capital invested, and wasting of capital for 
tear and wear, for manure and seed, and for oats, hay, and grass for 
horses and cattle, &amp;c. &amp;c., must, we fear, present such a result as 
to show that the profits of the agriculturists are not so great as at 
first sight might appear, or their condition so prosperous, as, for 
the best interests of the country, the philanthropist could desire. 
One consequence of which has been, that, within these few years, 
six of our enterprising farmers in this parish have abandoned their 
leases, and are now engaged in various pursuits in the far distant 
west; three of them superintending or connected with tradino- com- 
panies established by British capital, and three of them in com- 
mercial and agricultural undertakings in different parts of the 
United American States. 

. Dairy.~The dairy is an object of considerable interest and 
importance on some of the principal farms. Little cheese is 
made; butter is of excellent quality, though of late the quan- 
tity IS not so great as formerly, from the practice now fre- 
quently pursued of allowing the calves to be suckled at their 
mother's foot, mstead of receiving milk from the dairy-maid's 
hand. The butter, except what is required at home, or prepared

Eggs. There are several aged but active females who make a 

scanty livelihood by travelling over the parish and purchasing eggs, 
which are packed and sent to Aberdeen. At some seasons of the 
year, the carriers belonging to the town will take twelve boxes 
weekly, each box containing 175 dozen. This branch of business 
may seem trifling, but, as an article of parochial produce and in- 
dustry, we deem it not altogether unworthy of notice. 

Thirlage, -c— The system of thirlage is now entirely given 
up, and 'the operations of drying and milling generally con- 
ducted by the miller at about one thirty-second part, or 6d. per boll 
of grain manufactured. What was termed bondages to the heritor, 
which embraced the labour of man and beast, long and short car- 
riages, and the yearly payment of poultry, and in some cases of 
sheep, butter, and tallow,— are now abolished, and a money rent 
substituted, which has been found more agreeable to landlord and 
tenant, as well as advantageous to both. 

Fairs.— h'ing in the centre of a large and populous district, 
there are no fewer than eight annual fairs held in Turriff, fur the 
sale of cattle, horses, sheep, and a few articles of merchandise. 
They are well attended, and much business is transacted. Fee- 
ing-markets have also been established at the terms of Whitsun- 
day and Martinmas, for the engagement of male and female ser- 
vants; and if these have been found an accommodation in some 
respects it has, we conceive, been dearly purchased, by their cor- 
ruptino- influence on the morals of a large class of society. At all 
eventsrif these markets are to be kept up, it would be well if the 
Scots statute of 1605 were acted on, and any other day than Sa- 
turday chosen for holding them. , . j 
Manufactures.-ome years ago linen yarn was manufactured 
to a considerable extent by Messrs John Adam and Company, 
who gave employment to a number of flax-dressers, and indus- 
trious female spinners throughout the country A good sp;n- 
ne vhen sittiig steadily at her wheel, could then earn with 
ea ; 6d. or 8d. a day. Now Id. or '2d. can with diflficul y be 
m e out for the same quantity and q.uUity of thread. If, there- 
fore the great improvements in machinery have increased ti 
nowr of productioii, and the wealth of the country, they have at 
he n L abridged the comforts of many of the female popu-.

latioiij and driven them to out-door work ill suited to their consti- 
tution and character. Bleaching has been long carried on here, 
and well managed by R. Pearson and Son ; but, from the falling 
off of the linen trade, the business at the bleachfield is not now 
very considerable. Woollen cloth is manufactured at Turriff, and 
Mill of Gask, as also at Plaidy. At the two former, some busi- 
ness is done in dyeing both woollens and silk. Messrs Richards 
and Company, Aberdeen, have established a small branch of their 
business in Turriff. Previous to 1841, 28,000 yards of linen 
cloth were annually woven by the workmen here; but in that year 
there were only 15,470yards; and during the current yearamuch 
smaller quantity. 

The knitting of worsted stockings is still practised by several of 
the more aged females, at a miserably low rate of remuneration. 
To keep themselves in some kind of employment, these poor wo- 
men weave stockings for the hosier, who pays them a monthly vi- 
sit, and receive from him 3d. for a pair of the largest size. As 
the operation will fully occupy two days, it is not surprising that 
the business is not prosecuted with much energy. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Toion, Sc. and the nearest Sea Ports. — There is no 
weekly market in Turriff, but a regular supply of butcher-meat, and 
of the other necessaries and conveniences of life. All sorts of 
clothiery and haberdashery goods, groceries, hardware, &amp;c. can 
be got of the best quality, and the number and even elegance of 
some of the shops for retailing these commodities, show that the 
demand is great, and that the shop-keepers have the support and 
encouragement of the country. The spirit of enterprize in the 
place is very considerable, embracing a share of various sorts of 
.mercantile speculation. Tradesmen and artisans of all descrip- 
tions, masons, carpenters, shoemakers, tailors, weavers, black- 
smiths, slaters, &amp;c. are here established, and by their skill and 
character command steady employment. The nearest sea-ports 
with which the parish has daily intercourse, are Banff and Mac- 
duff, the former at the distance of eleven, and the latter of ten 
miles from the town of Turriff. The disposable grain is sent to 
the one or other of these ports, which supply us with coals, lime, 
bone-dust, and different other articles of merchandise and con- 
sumption. 

Means of Communication. — Turriff en joys the advantage of a 
local post-office, with a free delivery of letters twice a day from 



1006 



AHEllDEENSIilUE, 



north and south. Previous to the introduction of the penny post- 
age, the revenue of the post-office was about L.450 ; since ihe re- 
duction in the rate of postage, the amount may be L.300 per an- 
num. A well-conducted stage-coach from Aberdeen to Banff 
passes through Turriff" in the forenoon, and returns in the after- 
noon, every lawful day, — and, besides carriers to these towns, 
which leave"and arrive with the utmost regularity, there is a steady 
and convenient intercourse by carriers belonging to ihe adjoin- 
ing places. 

]gads. — A turnpike road, as already noticed, passes thro\igh 
the parish from one extremity to the other, but, as at the time of 
its formation, road-making was not so well understood as now, and 
as perhaps the best line was not chosen, this road, beneficial as it 
is to the country, is in some places not easily kept in repair, and 
yields but a poor return for the money invested in it. The road, 
not turnpike, are made and repaired by an assessment levied under 
an Act of Parliament for converting the ancient statute labour 
into money. The amount to be raised is fixed, and the applica- 
tion appointed by a general meeting of the trustees of the district, 
held generally in the end of May. The assessment on lands in 
this parish for a considerable number of years has been L. 100, 
3s. Rid. being at the rate of L.2 for L. 100 Scots of valued rent, 
leviable from the heritors, who are entitled fo rehef from the te- 
nants to the extent of three-fourths of the assessment. _ In the 
town of Turriff", an assessment by the same authority is levied from 
proprietors or occupiers of houses, persons keeping horses and la- 
bourers, to the amount of about L.i2 Sterling. The assessment 
on the lands is generally ordered to be laid out at the sight of the 
respective heritors or their agents, and that on the town by a com- 
mittee appointed by the general meeting. The accounts of ex- 
penditure are annually audited by the district trustees, at a meet- 
iiicT for that purpose in the month of April. 

"Bridnes—K bridge was erected in 1826 over the Doveron, 
about a quarter of a mile below the town. It is a substantial piece 
of mason-work, and opening up a communication with the county 
of Banff", and with Portsoy, Cullen, &amp;c. is of great utdity to the 
parish and public at large. The expense of this erection amount- 
ed to upwards of L.2500, and was defrayed partly by subscription, 
and partly by borrowing a certain sum of money, the interest ot 
which is paid by a fixed pontage. The bridge over the burn 
of TurrilF, and other smaller bridges, are kept in good condi- 



tion.

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church, which is on an elevat- 
ed situation, was built in 1794, and though by no means an ele- 
gant structure, is convenient and comfortable. From the increase 
of the population in the town, it became necessary to enlarge the 
church, and in 1830, an aisle was built and seated for 300 per- 
sons, so that now there is the legal accommodation for the whole pa- 
rishioners. The sittings for those residing in the landward part of 
the parish are all free, and the right of possession arises from the 
families liying on the properties of the different heritors to whom 
seats were appropriated in proportion to their valued rents. In 
the town the feuars who were not called on, and did not come for- 
ward to contribute towards the building of the church, were accom- 
modated by their friends in the country, who had in general more 
room than they required, or by the payment of a small rent to the 
superior of the burgh for a limited range of sittings which he had 
provided for them. They now occupy the aisle on payment an- 
nually of Is. 6d. on an average for each sitting, to the kirk-session, 
who, on the petition of the inhabitants, and with the sanction of 
the heritors, laid out about L.800 Sterling of the poor's funds,— 
an arrangement which, in every respect, has answered the wished 
for purpose, and has proved alike beneficial to a respectable body 
of hearers, and a numerous body of their poorer brethren. 

The manse was originally built in 1775, and was thoroughly re- 
paired and enlarged in 182-2, without any intervention of" the ci- 
vil or ecclesiastical courts. The glebe and garden contain about 
four and a-half acres, which, with a grass glebe of nearly three 
and a-half acres, may be worth L.15 per annum. The stipend 
was modified in 1837 by the Court of Teinds, with the unanimous 
concurrence of the heritors, and is now 17 chalders, Linlitho-ow 
standard, half meal and half barley, convertible-into money atthe 
fiar prices of the county, with L.lO Sterling for communion ele- 
ments. There is a respectable congregation of Episcopalians, 
consisting of about 265 members, who, in 1824, built a very neat 
place of worship, and disposed of their former chapel to some in- 
dividuals professing the principles of Independency, who meet 
every Sabbath for. public worship, which is conducted by a worthy 
and unobtrusive pastor of their own communion. The number of 
persons who are decided Independents or Congregationalists may 
be 14 or 16, but others avail themselves of the preacher's ministra 
tions There are a few families of Roman Catholics, who occa- 
sionally meet together for worship on the Lord's Day, and are

under the pastoral superintendence of a talented priest, whose re- 
sidence is at Strichen ; and there may be a few others who wor-  
ship their Maker, according to the dictates of their own con- 
sciences, without belonging to any particular denomination of 

-Christians. -ni i r i, j 

The number of communicants belonging to the Established 
Church this year amounted to 1264. The Earl of Fife is 
patron of the church and parish ; and it is somewhat singular, 
that, between Mr Andrew Kerr, who was ordained and inducted 
to the charge in 1731, 111 years ago, and the present incumbent, 
there has been only one minister, Mr William Stuart, who was 
translated from Auchterless, and, after serving the cure here forty - 
six years, died in November 1820. 

Baptisms.— The ordinance of baptism was, at one time, gene- 
rally administered « in presence of the haiU congregation," as di- 
rected by the Act of Assembly 7th February 1645 ; but as parents 
now, for the most part, prefer its celebration at their own houses, 
their wishes are complied with. The practice may be liable to 
objections, and, as being not in strict conformity with the rules oi 
the Church, is disapproved of by many of the clergy; but it has 
it advantages, inasmuch as it affords frequent opportunities to the 
pastor of direct intercourse with all classes of his flock,— takes, in 
some measure, the place of visitation of families,— is gratifying to 
the mother's feelings,-and is fitted, according to peculiar circum- 
stances, to make a stronger impression on the heart and conscience 

of the father. , , , e u . 

Education.— Besides the parochial school, there are four other 
schools conducted by male teachers ; but of these none are en- 
dowed or supported in any way but by school fees. In the paro- 
chial school are taught, and with great success, Greek Latin, ma- 
thematics, arithmetic, geography, English reading, and grammar. 
The pupils are numerous, generally above 100. During last sum- 
n,er, the number on the roll amounted to 130. The master, who 
i. a licentiate of the church, has, for some years, employed a well 
qualified assistant, and has not failed to introduce the so much ap- 
proved of intellectual and monitorial systems, with several other 
fudicious plans well fitted to promote the improvement of the 
Young. The school is regularly visited every year by a commiUee 
of Presbytery, who make out a report, and transmit it to the Ge- 
neral AsLmbly. In a private school in the town, the sanxe cou se 
is pursued as at the parochial school, and the teacher having le 



TURRIFF. 1009 

ceived an academical education, is well qualified to instruct those 
placed under his charge in all the branches usually taught at the 
endowed schools of the country. This school is attended by about 
70 scholars, who are annually examined by the minister of the pa- 
rish, in presence of their parents or guardians. On the eastern 
extremity of the parish, on the estate of Fin tray, and at a point 
where the parishes of Turriff and King- Edward meet, a school 
was established some years ago, which has been found exceedingly 
useful; and on the estates of Hatton and Gask, there are schools 
for the more elementary branches. We have also a well-conducted 
female school under the charge of an accomplished instructress, 
with several dame-schools for children of both sexes. 

There prevails on'the part of the parents an anxious desire to 
afford their children the advantages of education. About 400, or 
an eighth part of the entire population, are at present enjoying 
this blessmg. It is believed there are none between five and fif- 
teen who cannot read, and very few above fifteen who cannot write. 
1 he education of the young commences at a much earlier acre than 
formerly, and it is a gratifying circumstance to know, that tlie dif- 
ferent teachers pay due regard to the religious instruction of their 
pupils, and make religion the basis on which rests every other spe 
cies of education. The yearly salary of the parochial schoolmas- 
ter is L.34, 4s. 5id., and the probable amount of fees L.44 He 
also enjoys the benefit of Mr Dick's noble bequest, and the'emo- 
luments of session-clerk, which may be about L.7, with a mortifi- 
cation, elsewhere noticed, of L.8, 6s. 8d., and one acre and a-half 
ot land To his assistant he allows an annual salary of L 28 
Ihe school-room and schoolmaster's house, which are distinct 
buildings, were bu. t about fifteen years ago, and do great credit 
to the liberality and public spirit of the heritors, who, by the su- 
pemr and airy accommodation provided, have contributed much 
to the comfort and health of master and scholars. 

There are three Sabbath schools in the town, and two in the 
landward part of the parish, which are well attended. Of the be 
neficia effects of these institutions in leading the young to a more 
•ntima acquaintance with Gospel truth, the writer is duly sens

butions are, aided by frequent donations from the Noble and gene- 
rous patron of the church and parish, the resident heritors, some 
of the neighbouring gentry, and the more wealthy inhabitantsy 
there is still much room left for the exercise of the benevolent 
affections, and many cases of poverty and suffering which loudly 
call for sympathy and support. It would be well if such were vo- 
luntarily extended ; for if the time should come, and, with regret, 
we see symptoms of its approach, when a compulsory assessment 
for the maintenance of the. poor shall be resorted to, heritors and 
tenants, merchants and mechanics, would all feel the pressure of 
a tax which, in the southern part of the island, and in some pa- 
rishes in our own land, has been found peculiarly burdensome and 
grievous. Happily that feeling of independence and reluctance 
to ask or to receive parochial aid, which was so characteristic of 
the people in former days, is not yet altogether extinct; but it 
requires to be cherished and kept alive, and every one who loves 
his country, and has the real interest of the poor at heart, will be 
anxious to do so. In an especial manner we hold this to be a 
duty peculiarly incumbent on the ministers of parishes, who can 
never be more usefully employed than in endeavouring to milio-ate 
the sufferings of the indigent, by encouraging among them feelings 
of self-respect, habits of industry, and the Christian virtues of 
contentment and resignation, and, at the same time, of pointino- 
out to those in the higher ranks of life, whom a kind Providence 
has blessed with abundance, the claims which God and man have 
lor a due portion of the gifts and good things they so liberally 
enjoy. -  

Coal Fund.~Th\s fund was established about eighteen years' 
ago It IS supported by an annual collection in the parish church 
Till fif Sabbath of every year, by the interest of a bequest of 
L.200 in 1829, by the late Dr Hall, long a respectable physician 
in this place, and the interest of a donation of L.50 in 1834, by 
Mr John Johnston, merchant in Aberdeen, whose father was a 
native of the parish, and by some minor contributions. It is ma- 
naged by the k.rk-session, and such householders as choose to at- 
erid their meetings; and such is the public confidence in its use 
lulness, that the coals are now generaily brought from Banff and 
Macduff by the farmers, free of all expense, and distributed amonc 
the poor on the roll, and any other indigent families or individuals

supply of warm clotliing. During last winter, 1841-2, of rather 
unusual severity, there was expended on coals, and on bed and 
body-clothes, upwards of L.37 Sterling. 

When sick, the poor are attended by the medical practitioners, 
who not only cheerfully render their gratuitous advice and as- 
sistance, but frequently give-medicines. In cases that require 
particular treatment, advantage is taken of that valuable nst. u- 
tion, the infirmary at Aberdeen, where, it is but justice to add, 
the patients from this parish have uniformly experienced every 
attention and comfort that professional skill and humanity can

ioiperative on societies to remodel their rules, and adopt tables 
founded on the scheme of mutual assurance, three of the Soc.etie. 
have been broken up, and the funds divided among the members. 

AaricuUural Association.-There was formed about twelve 
veirs acTO, a Turriff Agricultural Association, and which is well 
upported by landlords and tenants. It is under the management 
7 mmiUee chosen by the members, who ho Id two public 
.meetings annually ; one in the spring, for the exhibition of s ed

scheme be accurately carried out, it cannot fail to produce much 
valuable local information, and to answer all the ends of an ex- 
perimental farm. 

Savings' Bank. — A bank for savings was opened in August 1817, 
and has more than realized all the hopes entertained by its pro- 
jectors. The depositors are chiefly tradesmen, labourers, and 
men and women servants. The accounts are kept, and the busi- 
ness almost wholly managed by the treasurer, who is parish school- 
master, and who receives, or gives out to those concerned, on 
every alternate Thursday evening, any sum from Is. to L.20 Ster- 
ling. When the savings reach L.20, the depositors are obliged 
to withdraw their money, and, if so disposed, to open a new ac- 
count, and operate upon it according to their inclination. It is 
worthy of remark, that several of them have actually transferred 
their earnings six times over to the provincial banks of the country, 
or otherwise invested them, and have thus, by prudent economy, 
been able to make honourable provision for themselves and their 
families in a safe and easy manner. The funds in the bank at 
1st November 1841, when the last balance was struck, amounted 
to L.2289, 18s. 2d. ; the amount deposited for the year previous, 
L.594, 12s. 8id. ; and the amount withdrawn during the same 
year, L.552, 17s. 4id. 

Public Banks, c— There is a branch of the Commercial Hank 
of Scotland in Turriff", one of the North of Scotland Banking 
Company, and a sub-branch of the Aberdeen Banking Compfiny. 
They are all conducted by respectable agents, and have been 
found to be exceedingly convenient, as, before their establishment, 
all bank business in the distrist was transacted at Aberdeen or 
Banff-, which could not be eff-ected but at considerable expense 
and risk. 

There are also agents for diff-erent insurance companies ; and 
as the advantages of fire and life insurance begin to be better un- 
derstood, a corresponding support may be anticipated. 

Gas Company. ~\n 1839, a joint-stock company was formed for 
the manufacture of gas. The capital, L.750, is held in shares of 
L.2, 10s. each. The buildings are conveniently situated, and the 
concern, now that the shares are nearly sold, will yield a moderate 
return for the outlay of capital, and give a brilliant beautiful lio-ht 
to the consumers. The quantity of gas consumed in the year 
ending June 20th 1842, was 188,000 cubical feet. 

Inns, In the town there are respectable inns and taverns, " 



1014 ABEIIDEENSHIUE. 

where travellers and the public can enjoy every necessary cotnfort. 
Besides these, there are numerous ale-houses and spint-shops, 
which, to a certain extent, may be convenient, though several of 
them might with great propriety be suppressed, as affordmg an 

undue facility to tippling. 

Courts —One of the Sheriff substitutes of the county holds a 
quarterly small-debt court here, for sums not exceeding L.8, 6s. 
8d ■ and from the number of cases brought up for judgment, it 
may be supposed the establishment of this court has been found 
advantageous to the lieges. The justices of the peace and heu- 
tenancy'of the district also meet in Turriff when necessary ; and 
this being the Presbytery seat, the ordinary meetings of that body 

are held here. i i,- u 

Police, §-c.— One of the most crying evils, and which was 
sensibly felt by the inhabitants, was the overwhelming concourse 
of vao-rants and travelling mendicants, to whom a well-meanmg 
but mistaken liberahty afforded a temptation to make this place a 
favourite haunt. Since the institution of a rural police and the 
activity of the district constable, with the terror which «his baton 
and uniform inspire, this annoyance has been much lessened ; and, 
notwithstanding that the town is a great thoroughfare, there is not 
one for ten of the visitants that formerly infested it, and diverted 
the charity of the parishioners from known and deserving objects 
at home. In this locality, therefore, though a feeling of opposi- 
tion has been manifested in some quarters to what is something 
like a gens d'armes, the general desire is, that the force may be 
kept up in all its efficiency. 

Prison —The only place of confinement is a lock-up-house, 
consisting of two very small apartments, in which criminals may 
be lodged for a single night, preparatory to their bemg sent to the 
county jail, or in modum pcBncB of those smaller offences which oc- 
casionally occur, particularly at the feeing markets. 

Fuel—Thexe is very little moss in the parish. Turf m some 
places is to be got ; but English coals are commonly used as fuel.

I. — Topography and Natural History. 
The old parish of Essie was, very long ago, united to that of 
Rhynie. 

Boundaries. — The parish is bounded on the north by 'Gartly ; 
on the south, by Auchindoir; on the west, by Cabrach. Its fi- 
gure is nearly square. 

The soil is various. There is but one mountain in the parish : 
it is called Noth, about 1000 feet above the level of the sea. 

II. — rCiviL History. 

Parochial Registers. — These have been irregularly kept. 

Land-owners. — The sole land-owner in the parish is His Grace 
the Duke of Richmond. 

Antiquities. — The most remarkable of these is on the summit 
of the hill of Noth, and considered by MacCulloch to be the re- 
mains of a vitrified fort. What appear to have been the walls are, 
in some parts, more than ten feet in thickness. It is very difficult to 
conceive how such a mass of loose stones could, by any artificial 
process, be cemented together by fusion, and, supposing that the 
requisite heat could be excited, it is difficult to conceive it possi- 
ble so to regulate the heat throughout so great a mass, as that only 
so many of the stones should be fused as were required to cement 
the others. The conducting power of earthy matter is so very 
low, that the outer surface would be run before the centre could

PRESBYTERY OF GARIOCH, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. JAxMES PETER, MINISTER. 



I — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, §-c.— Tradition gives the origin of the name to the 
settlement of the Leslyns or Leslys in this district, which took 
place so early as the eleventh century. 

Boundaries, The parish is bounded on the south by the 
parishes of Keig and Tullynessle, from which it is divided by a 
ridge of hills, which form part of a range beginning with Benochie 
on the east, and, terminating at Cabrach on the west, divide the 
Garioch from the Alford districts ; on the west and north, by 
Clatt and Kennethmont ; and on the east, by Insch and Prem- 
nay. Its greatest length is about 3i miles, and breadth about 2 
miles.  

An elevated ground, rising in some parts into hills, and running 
from east to west, divides it into two nearly equal parts. Between 
this ndge and the hills which divide the parish from the Alford 
district, hes a valley in which runs the Gady. Skirting the base 
ot this central ndge on the west, north, and east, lies the remain- 
der of the lands of the parish. 

The climate is rather moist, and very variable. In the valley 
mentioned, it is warmer than in the north-west part of the parish, 
wh.ch IS exposed to the north winds, and in the vicinity of a

ABERDEENSHIUE. 



Hydrography.— Gady is the only stream worth notice in 
the parish. It takes its rise in Clatt, and running through Lesly 
and Premnay, falls into the Ury in the parish of Oyne 

Geology and Mineralogy.— soil on the opposite sides of 
the Gady differs considerably, that on the north side being a light 
loam generally on a gravelly bottom or subsoil,— that on the south 
beino- a strong " rich mould on clay bottom." On the south side 
of the parish, there is serpentine. No quarry has been opened, 
but the country people make snuff'-boxes and trinkets of it. It has 
a greenish tinge, with gray streaks interspersed. The serpentine 
of this district, of which there is a great abundance, is most pro- 
bably a part of that tract which, it is conjectured, runs from Port- 
soy across the country to Strathdon. This serpentine does not 
take a fine polish, owing to its being interspersed with small pieces 
of spar resembling schiller spar in appearance, but much harder. 
The other minerals to be found in the parish are, steatite, manga- 
nese, asbestus, shorl, mica, albite, beryl, and the more common 
minerals, felspar and quartz. A farmer, in cutting a ditch through 
part of the serpentine rock which was contiguous to his fields, 

• This stream has been celebrated in song by the poet Arthur Johnston, in Latin. 
There is also a beautiful ballad once often sung by the natives, beginnuig " Oh an 
I were where Gady rins," &amp;c. It may not be thought improper to mention a strik- 
incr anecdote connected with this song, as illustrative of the power of association. 
At\er the siege of Pondicherry. when a Scotch regiment was marching into the town, 
the whole soldiers stood still on a sudden, being arrested by hearing this song sung 
by a Scotch lady from an open window. The song, being now very scarce, is sub- 
joined.   Qr&amp; where Gadie rins, 

'Mang fragrant heath and yellow whins, 
Or brawlin down the boskie lins, 
At the back o' Ben-uo-chie

found in a fissure about 2 feet from the surface, several pieces of 
petrified wood. 

Zoology. — The domestic cattle are of the Aberdeenshire breed. 
Greater care than formerly is now taken in the selection of breed- 
ing stock, but very much remains to be done in tliis respect. Some 
attempts have been made at " crossing" with the short-horned 
breed. There are very few sheep, and these are generally a cross 
between the Leicester and Cheviot. Pigs are hot much raised in 
the parish ; but the farmers are beginning to pay attention to this 
department of husbandry. 

Botiiny. — Wild mustard [Sinapis arvensis, dock {Rumex cris- 
pusi ragweed [Senecio Jacobtsa, bishopweed [gopodium podu' 
graria, bur-thistle {Cnicus lanceolutus , knot-grass [Holcus avena- 
ceus, couch grass {Triticum repens, are the most common weeds. 
The formers are now becoming careful in rooting them out ; 
but still a good deal remains to be done. 

Among the rarer plants may be mentioned, Arenaria verna 
serpentine tract, mentioned above, Senecio saracenicus, Sambu- 
cus ebidus. Statice armeria may also be mentioned as a rather 
rare plant in districts not maritime. It grows on the serpentine 
tract, along with Arenaria verna above alluded to. 

There is one small plantation in the parish, but not in a very 
thriving condition. 

II. — Civil History. 

Land-owners. — There are only two proprietors, viz. Sir Andrew 
Leith Hay of Rannes and Leith Hall, &amp;c. M. P.; and Colonel F. 
Leith of Whitehaugh. The former has about two-thirds, and the 
latter about one- third of the parish. 

Parochial Register. — Tha session records begin in the year 
1699, when Mr William Watson was minister. A register of 
marriages and baptisms, and minutes of session have been gene- 
rally kept from that time, but they are incomplete. No register 
of deaths has been kept. The following is a list of the incum- , 
bents at Leslie since 1698, viz. Mr William Watson, admitted in 
1698, died about the beginning of 1699. Mr Forbes, admitted 
in May 1701, removed to Tarves in September 1706. Mr Thain, 
admitted December 30, 1707, removed to Auchindoir in June 
1719. Mr Robert Abercrombie, grand-uncle of the present Dr 
Abercrombie of Edinburgh, admitted 24th August 1720, died in 
July 1751, Mr Alexander Stewart, translated from Grange 3d 
June 1752, date of his death not ascertained exactly, but it was in

ABEUDEENSHIUE. 



1797 or 1798. Mr Harper, who was translated to Kildrummy in 
1795, was appointed Mr Stewart's assistant and successor in 1782. 
Mr David Dunbar, admitted February 24, 1796, assistant and 
successor to Mr Stewart, died February 20, 1830. Present incum- 
bent 'admitted November 30, 1830. 

Antiquities.— Th\s parish has little to boast of in this respect. 
There were, till lately, the remains of a Druidical temple. The 
farmer on whose ground it was, demolished it, and used the stones 
in building- fences. On the south-west of the church is Chapel- 
ton, where there had been once a Roman Catholic chapel. The 
ruins were dug up many years ago. The font stone is still to be 
seen in one of the buildings of the farm-steading. There is a 
tradition, that the farmer who removed the stones lost the whole 
of his horses, and one race of horses after another, till he was com- 
pletely ruined, and obhged to give up the lease of his farm. Far- 
ther south, near to the road leading to AH'ord, is a circular hollow 
about five feet in diameter, and about three feet deep, called the 
Four Lords' Seat, or Little John's Length. The former name 
is given to it from a tradition that four Lords met here and dmed 
too-ether each on his own ground, viz. Lord Glamrais, the Lord 
of" Leslie, the Lord of Putachie, the Bishop of Aberdeen. A 
little to the south-west of this are some vestiges of an encampment, 
and a few cairns or tumuli. One of them, larger than the rest, is 
called Cock's Cairn. Tradition says a battle was fought here. 
A number of tumuli on the farm of New Leslie have been lately 
discovered. 

Leslie House, formerly the seat of the Barons of Leshe, may 
be now numbered among the antiquities of the parish. It was 
first the seat of the Lesleys or Leslyns, from whom it got its 
name. It afterwards came into the hands of the Forbeses of Mo- 
nymusk, by John Forbes marrying the widow of George the last 
Baron of Lesley, who had left the property deeply burdened. 
John Forbes, by paying the debts, became possessed of the estate. 
The present house, of the castellated form, now ruinous, was 
built by William, son of the said John Forbes. It was founded, 
as appears from an inscription on the walls, June 17, 1661, and 
was inclosed by a rampart and fosse. The draw-bridge ws on 
the west, and guarded by a watch-tower. Over the gate _.s the 
date 1643 Over the door of the house or castle is the inscription, 
"'nsec Corp. Sydera Mentem." The Forbes coat-of-arms is to be 
seen in several places. The said William Forbes was buried in 



LESLIE, 



1023 



the cliurch-yard of Leslie. On his tombstone is the following in- 
scription, viz. " Here lyes William Forbes of Leslie, who lived 
fifty-five years, and departed this life, November 12, 1670 years." 
John Forbes succeeded his father, after whom the lands came 
into the Leith Hall family, in which they continue. There was 
also a castle at New Leslie, a little to the west of the present 
Castle of Leslie, the foundations- of which were lately dug up. 
At the time to which the tradition mentioned above refers, the 
lands of the parish were held by Lord Glammis, the Bishop of 
Aberdeen, and the Baron of Leslie. The part possessed by Lord 
Glammis belonged at one time to the Abbey of Lindores. A 
charter of a very ancient date is said to exist, conveying the 
part of the lands of the parish, now called Courtieston, but, in 
the charter, Cruterston, along with power to the proprietor of 
ruling cum Flaminga lack.

There are about 107 families in the parish, either engaged in,

IV. — Industry. 
• The number of acres under tillage is about 2000 ; valued rent, 
L.1566, 6s. 8d. Soots, and real, about L.2.300. The rent of land 
varies very much. What is called infield lets in some cases at 
L.3 per Scents acre ; outfield varies from lOs. to L.l, 5s. per Scots 
acre The rotation of cropping is generally a seven course shift, 
which allows three-sevenths in grain crop, three-sevenths in arass, 
and one-seventh in turnip. This system, which is almost" uni- 
tormly pursued, might, it is thought, be profitably exchanged in 
many cases for a six course shift, with only one grain crop before 
turmps, another after, and three grasses, which would allow thd 
same rest, and crop the land less than the seven course .hift 
€omplamts are general of the deficiency of the grass crops, wWcli

may be owing, in some measure, to ibe frequent cropping of the 
land.

V. — Pabochial Economy. 
Means of Communication. — A commutation road, running al- 
most along the banks of the Gady, leads by Premnay to the turn- 
pike to In'verury and Aberdeen, and another, in the direction of 
Kennethmont, leads from the church to the turnpike to Huntly. 
From Inverury and Huntly the church is nearly equidistant, and 
the farm produce of the parish is almost wholly carried to either 
of these towns ; but the greater part to Inverury. 

Ecclesiastical State—The parish church is situated on the south 
bank of the Gady, at nearly the eastern extremity of the parish, 
and was built in 1815 to accommodate nearly 300. The manse 
was built in 1794. The teinds are exhausted, and an allowance 
from the Exchequer is required to augment the stipend to L.150. 
There is also a Dissenting chapel belonging to the Independents, 
on the north-west extremity of the parish, built in 1818. 

Education.— The parish school is situated within a few yards ot 
the church. Instruction is given in English, writing, arithmetic, 
book-keeping, and Latin. Salary, L.25, 13s. 4d. Fees in 1834 
about L.13. In lieu of a garden, an allowance is given ot L.-J, 
2s. 9d. There is a mortification of L.l, 13s. 4d. per annum as 
fees for the children of poor widows. , „ 

Poor — At present there are only four upon the poor s roll. Une 
of these', however, has a family of four children, wholly dependent 
on the sessional allowance and the charity of the neighbourhood. 
Miscellaneous Observations. 
Since the date of last Report, a good deal of meadow and bar- 
ren land has been improved. Much has been done m dram.ng 
and a good deal remains to be done. Furrow-drain.ng on Sin I 
of Deanston's plan would do much good in several localities; b 
the expense i too great for the farmer. As the improveme t 
I'ould be permanent,'the outlay by the proprietor woul be amp 
repaid. The rental of the parish is about thrice what it was a 
Z "ate of last Report, and the vale of stock is increased m about

an equal ratio. There is good field for plantations in the parish, 
and they are much wanted. Farmers have to drive wood from a 
distance: and much might be done by enclosing with paling, if 
wood were more plentiful. The people are generally industrious, 
and a great change has taken place in their mode of living.

PRESBYTERY OF ABERDEEN, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. GEORGE MOIR, MINISTER. 



Topography and Natural History. 
Name.— Is the earlier registers, the parish is called the Upper 
Parochme of St Machar; and in those of later date, Upper Ma- 
char. The modern name is New Machar, in contradistinction, 
no doubt, to the name of the adjoining parish of Old Machar, of 
which It originally formed a part. 

Extent.~-'V\xQ length of the parish from north-west to south- 
east may be 10 miles; average breadth about 1\ miles. 

Boundaries, -c— It is bounded on the north and north-east, by 
the parish of Udny; on the east, by the parish of Belhelvie: on 
the south, by Old Machar and the river Don ; and on the west, 
by the parishes of Fintray and Keith Hall. The greater part of 
the parish IS situated between gently sloping hills of moderate ele- 
vation, inclining from north-west to south-east, and is considera- 
biy diversified by small hills, cultivated or under wood. 

It may be noticed, that certain lands in the parish, called 
the lands of Straloch, though surrounded on all sides by the 
county of Aberdeen, are yet in the county of Banff; and farther, 
that these lands, though forming part of the parish, are yet dis' 
joined from it, by a section of the parish of Udny uniting itself to 
the parish of Fintray. This portion of the parish of Udny, how- 
ever consisting of the lands of Torryleith, has, for a good many 
years, by a decree of the Synod, been attached, quoad sacra, to 
the parish o New Machar, and the lands of Stilloch are ow 
rated and politically attached to the county of Aberdeen. 

barometrical observations have, so far as the 

3 T 



1026 ABERDEENSHIRE. 

writer has been able to discover, been kept in the parish. It 
would appear, however, that both the temperature and salubrity 
of the atmosphere have greatly improved since the date of the for- 
mer Statistical Account. For this we are mainly indebted to the 
very extensive improvements in draining and cultivating marshy 
land which have been made in tbe parish of late years. There is 
an observable difference between the climate of the upper and 
that of tbe lower parts of the parish, the climate of the former be- 
ing colder than that of the latter— owing partly to the difference 
of elevation, and partly to the difference of soil. The north-west 
wind is perhaps the most prevalent. 

Hydrography.— Copious springs are to be found in many parts 
of the parish. In the former Statistical Account, four mineral 
springs are named, one in particular as having been much used at 
that period, and found beneficial in scorbutic complaints. Now, 
they are seldom if at all spoken of, and certainly not used for me- 
dicinal purposes. , r 

Lochs.— There are two lochs in the south-east end ot ttie pa- 
rish the one remarkable for the rugged nature of the district 
around, and the other for its having been the scene of the resi- 
dence of the Bishops of Aberdeen before the chantry was erected. 
Of this residence, which was situated on a small island withm the 
loch, mention is made in a " View of the Diocese of Aberdeen,'' 
MS. Advocates' Library, supposed to be written by Sir Samuel 
Forbes of Foveran, about 1720. " It looks liker a hermit s cell, 
observes the writer of the MS., " than a Bishop's Palace, and yet 
a great man lived and died there,-I mean Bishop Benham. Ihe 
site of the palace may still be traced, as also part of a ditch con- 
nected with the drawbridge. The loch itself now known by the 
name of the Bishop's Loch, anciently Loch Goul,is beautifully 
situated, well-wooded, and of considerable extent. 

Eivers— The Don, as has already been mentioned, forms one 
of the boundaries of the parish. It flows along the southern ex- 
tremity, in the direction of south-east, for the distance of about 
wo miles, and then enters the parish of Old Machar, five miles 
above where it falls into the sea. • , ,u riv., 

The only other stream worthy of notice is a considerable riu- 
let which, rising about a mile above the north end of the parish, 
runs through it southward, and, after supplying - 'ourse se - 
corn-mills with water, falls into the Don, a little above the 
bridge of Dyce.

Geology and Mineralogy. — Granite abounds in the south end 
of the parish. Limestone is to be found in the estate of North 
Kinmundy, but not in sufficient quantity to repay the labour of 
quarrying and burning, Src. There is evidence of its having been 
burnt there at a former period ; but not, I am told, for the last 
fifty years. 

The parish presents a variety of soils. In the southern part 
near the Don. the soil is a gravelly loam ; in the middle part, 
good loam ; in the northern part, patches of good loam, with a large 
proportion of inferior various land on a bottom of clay — the most 
valuable portions being those lately reclaimed by modern hus- 
bandry, by deepening the principal burn that runs through the 
parish, and by judicious draining. 

There are no large forests in the parish. The most extensive 
woods are those on the estate of Parkhill. The estates of Stra- 
loch and Elrick are also well-wooded. On another of the estates 
in the parish, the estate of Rainniesbills and Kingseat, there 
has been a good deal planted, within the last ten years. With a 
few exceptions, the young plantations are thriving well. 

II. — Civil History. 

There is no separate account of the history of the parish; but 
several interesting particulars connected with its history are to be 
found in the chartulary of Aberdeen, in the library of King's Col- 
lege, and in the " View of the Diocese of Aberdeen," MS., al- 
ready referred to. There is in the possession of the Straloch and 
Pitlurg families a large collection of papers, which are of interest 
and importance, not only as regards this parish, but as regards this 
county. Many of these have lately been published by the Spald- 
ing Club see Miscellany of the Spalding Club, Vol. i. The 
original painting of the celebrated Robert Gordon of Straloch, by 
Jamieson, is in the mansion-house of Parkhill, in this parish. 

Eminent Characters. — Robert Gordon. — This eminent geogra- 
pher and antiquary was born at Kinmundy in this parish on the 
14th September 1580. He was the second son of Sir John Gor- 
don of Pitlurg, a gentleman who long stood high in the favour of 
his sovereign, James VI. Mr Gordon has the merit of being the 
first who applied actual mensuration in topographical surveys to 
Scotland. At the request and earnest solicitation of King Charles 
he undertook, in 1641, the preparation of an atlas of Scotland, 
which was published in 1648, and soon afterwards went through a 
«econd and third editions. It was his diligence and accuracy in 



1028 ABEllDEENSHIRE. 

the science of geography, then in an eKtrcmely rude state, that 
first obtained for him the celebrity which he afterwards enjoyed. 

Dr Thomas Beid.—Th\s dislingiiiahed metaphysician and moral 
philosopher was settled minister of this parish May 12, 1737, and 
continued in that office till June 21, 1752. 

With respect to the two eminent individuals above-mentioned, 
it is not thought necessary here to detail the various particulars 
of their life, attainments, or writings ; all that is known with cer- 
tainty of them being already before the public. 

Land-owners.-The lands of the parish are divided among six 
proprietors,— Parkhill, Rosehalh and Goval, the property of John 
Gordon Gumming Skene, Esq. of Dyce and Pitlurg, valued rent, 
L 927, 9s. 4d. ; Straloch, John Ramsay, Esq. of Barra, L.800 ; 
Elrick and Swailend, Peter Burnett, Esq., L.053, 3s. 4d. ; 
Rainnieshills, Boddom, and Kingseat, Alexander Thomson, Esq. 
of Banchory, L.506, 13s. 4d. ; North Kinmundy, Earl of Aber- 
deen L.183,6s. 8d.; South Kinmundy, George Morrison, D.D., 
minister of Nether Banchory, &amp;c. L. 183, 6s. 8d. Total rental,

'parochial Registers. -"The oldest register extant comoiencGs 
November 1641, and ends 1650, in very bad condition; the se- 
cond commencing July 30, 1676, and ending about 1700, contains, 
along with a record of the session's discipline, a register of bap- 
tisms and marriages. The register of discipline, however, in this, 
book, comes up only to July 1688, when a third register was be- 
gun, wherein are recorded the cases of discipline, together with an 
account of the management of the poor's funds up to March 10 
1706 The registers which follow are in better preservation, and 
have ' on the whole, been well and accurately kept. The only blank 
which occurs in the registers after 1676 is sufficiently singular i a. 
its way to be deserving of notice. The first 160 pages of tha 
remster are occupied with sessional matters during the incum- 
bencY of Mr Bisset. At the bottom of the page, recording his 
translation in 1728, there is an attestation to the examination of 
the register by the presbytery. The next entry on the opposite 
page, mentions the admission of Mr afterwards Dr Reid in 1/3/. 
No leaves are cut out. This blank of nine years is accounted 
for by the joint testimony of history and tradition History tells 
us tl/at Mr Bisset's successor was settled by a riding comn. e 
contrary to the will of the people or presbytery; and tiadition

ays, the incumbent, whose name it is not necessary to mention, 
absconded for some open immorality. 

Antiquities. — There is a stone in the court-yard of a farm in 
the parish, on which tradition says that one of the early Kings of 
Scotland Malcohn Canmore seated himself, being in these parts 
Tvith his army. Weary with marching, and overpowered with 
thirst, he had water brought to him from a well in the immediate 
neighbourhood, which proved so grateful and refreshing to the 
exhausted energies of the monarch, that he pronounced nature's 
beverage to be better than ale, or better than ill ale. From these 
circumstances, the property on which this farm is, is called King- 
seat, and the said well, the Betteral Well, i. e. the Better Ale 
Well, to this day. At one time there were as many as four cha- 
pels in this parish, — St Colm's at Monykebbock ; Virgin Mary's at 
Clubsgoval ; Virgin Mary's at Straloch, supposed to be built by the 
Cheynes of Straloch ; Virgin Mary's at Bishop's Manor, in Loch 
Goul. The first of these, St Colm's, is at least 586 years old, 
as appears from the Chartulary of Aberdeen, where, among the 
other constitutions of Bishop Peter Ramsay dated apud Aberdon, 
14 Kal. Mail 1256, it is ordered that the Dean, being parson of 
Kirkton, or Old Aberdeen, is obliged to maintain a chaplain and 
clerk at Monycabock, as well as Kirkton. Connected with this 
chapel, was a church-yard, which is still used as a place of inter- 
ment. The site of the chapel at Straloch is near to the present 
mansion-house, and is marked out by numerous fragments of the 
building, by pieces of tomb-stones, of which the inscriptions are 
in part legible, also by a well close by, called the Chapel Well. 

Church. — The church was erected in 1791, and is sufficiently 
neat, comfortable, and commodious. 

■ Mansion- Houses. — The chief of these is Parkhill, the residence 
of the principal heritor, who has also large properties in the ad- 
joining parishes of Dyce and Old Machar. It is a commodious 
handsome house, beautifully situated, and well sheltered by exten- 
sive ornamental and valuable plantations. The lawn is extensive, 
and finely diversified with wood and water ; and the prospect up 
the valley of the Don, terminated by the picturesque mountain of 
Bennochie, is but rarely surpassed. 

• The next in importance is Straloch, the seat of Mr Ramsay of 
Barra, once the property and residence of the well-known Gordon 
of Straloch, so celebrated as a geographer and a man of science. 
This residence has also many attractions, and, improving upon a 



1030 ABEUDEENSIIIllE. 

naturally fine situation, the late Mr Ramsay and his father have 
done much by planting and otherwise, to render Straloch one of 
the finest places in the country. 

The only other mansion-house is that of Elrick. It is a com- 
fortable residence, suited to the size of the estate, and well shel- 
tered by thriving plantations. The proprietor, Mr Burnett, from 
the state of his health, usually resides in Italy.

Character of the PeojoZe.— The people are, for the most part, 
sober, industrious, and intelligent. They are not inferior, it is 
believed, to the parishes around, either in the knowledge or practice 
of the Gospel,— are most regular in their attendance on the ser- 
vices of the sanctuary,-are liberal, to a degree, in their contribu- 
tions for the support of the poor,— and, of late, have shown them- 
selves ready to attend on ministrations of a more private kind on 
week days. On the part of the young, especially, an uncommon 
and growino- desire is manifested f6r instruction, both in the things 
that pertain to the life that now is, and in the things that pertain 
to the life which is to come. 

IV. — Industry. 
The inhabitants of this parish, with comparatively few excep- 
tions, are employed in agriculture. 

Agriculture.-TXe superficial- extent of the parish may be esti- 
mated at about 8390 imperial acres, of which about 5570 are ara- 
ble, 958 in pasture, and about 810 under plantation, consisting 
chiefly of larch and fir, with a considerable intermixture ot hard 
wood. Of the remaining acres, from 300 to 400 might be ad- 

vantageously cultivated. 

Rental—The average rate of land per acre has not been accu- 
rately ascertained; but may be stated in round numbers at L.l per 
imperial acre. The valued rent of the whole parish is L.32o4. 

Va7.5.-Farm-servants receive about L.12 per annum, exclu- 
sive of board. The period of engagement is usually six months. 
The system of feeing markets prevails in this part of the country ; 
but efforts are being made to establish district register offices, 

4 



NEW MACMAU. 



1031 



which have for their object to improve the respectability and effi- 
ciency of that numerous and hitherto much-neglected class of so- 
ciety, by rendering certificates of character essential to success. 
The wages of labourers are 2s. per day in summer, and Is. 6d. in 
winter. The wages of artisans are proportionally higher. 

Produce. — The principal crops raised in the parish are barley, 
bear, corn, turnips, and potatoes. The price of provisions much 
the same as in the neighbouring parishes. 

Husbandry The mode of rotation followed in this parish is 

either a five or a seven-shift, — the former being, 1. green crop or 
fallow; 2. oats, or barley sown out with grass seeds; 3. hay; 4. 
pasture ; 5. oats ; — the latter, the same as the former, with this 
difference, that the land is allowed to lie three years in grass in- 
stead of two, and afterwards is made to carry two white crops in- 
stead of one. Modifications of either system are sometimes prac- 
tised, according to increased facilities of procuring manure and 
other determining circumstances. 

Live-Stock. — The cattle reared are either the Aberdeenshire 
horned and dodded, or crosses with the short-horn and Here- 
ford breeds. The policy of corrupting the native breeds of the 
country is still a qucBstio vexata, which time and more experience 
only can solve. It is universally found in the Smith field market, 
that pure Aberdeenshire bring a much higher price than the short- 
horn or even the finest cross, while, on the other hand, the latter 
attain a larger size, and are in general ready for the market a year 
sooner. 

Improvements. — In no parish, perhaps, within the last ten years, 
have improvements in agriculture been more vigorously and suc- 
cessfully carried on than in this. By draining, liming, and other 
applications, not only has a large addition been made to the ex- 
tent of arable land in the parish, but the soil in previous cultiva- 
tion has been rendered much more productive. 

Size of Farms. — The farms vary in extent from 45 to 200 acres, 
or thereby. 

Leases. — The duration of leases is nineteen years, and the con- 
ditions generally favourable to the occupier. But we have heard 
not a few ffxrmers complain that proprietors neglect to inform them, 
till within the last year or so, of the expiry of their lease, whether 
it is to be renewed or not. 

Farm-hotises and Steadings. — These are for the most part com- 
modious, and adapted to the size of the farms. They have been 



1032 



ABERDEENSHIRE. 



greatly improved of late years ; but in many cases their condition is 
susceptible of farther improvement. 

With regard to the erection of farm-steadings, the following 
system has been adopted by the proprietor of Rainnieshills, &amp;c. 
and has been found to answer well. After the plan and size have 
been agreed upon, the tenant erects the whole at his own expense, 
but is repaid his whole outlay except carriages, in the five subse- 
quent years, by ten equal half-yearly deductions from his rent. 
If it were not invidious to single out a particular individual, where 
so many have signalized themselves in the various departments of 
agriculture, it might be mentioned that the greatest improvements 
which have been recently made in this parish have been effected 
by Mr William Harvey, the spirited and skilful tenant of Mony- 
kebbock. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Towns. — The nearest market-towns are Aberdeen and 
Old Meldrum, the former distant from the parish church ten 
and the latter eight miles. There is no village in the parish. 

Means of Communication. — There is a post-office lately esta- 
blished about midway between the church and manse, close by 
the turnpike road. The Aberdeen and Banff turnpike runs 
through the parish, a distance of seven miles, intersecting it in the 
direction of north and south. The old Aberdeen turnpike, com- 
mencing at the church, gradually diverges from the neiv eastward, 
until it joins the Peterhead turnpike, near to the old bridge of Don. 
It is still in very tolerable repair, and is the mean of communica- 
tion with Aberdeen to the inhabitants in the south-east end of the 
parish. Carriers pass almost daily. A stage-coach from Aber- 
deen to Banff passes and repasses along the new turnpike daily, 
also a gig carrying a second mail. 

The most important bridge connected with the parish is that 
which spans the Don on the line of the public road. It consists 
of one wide arch,— is built entirely of wood,— is much admired for 
its elegant as well as scientific construction,- but is now consider- 
ed frail and unsafe for heavy carriages, and is about to be repla- 
ced by one of stone a little higher up the river. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church is situated exactly op- 
posite the tenth mile stone, a few hundred yards to the eastward, 

• There are, moreover, numerous excellent statute laljour roads crossing the pa- 
rish in all directions.

•and is nearly equidistant from the extremities of the parish. It 
.was built in 1791, and can accommodate between 600 and 700 
•hearers. All the sittings are the property of the heritors, and 
are allocated according to their valued rent. 

The manse was built in 1781, and underwent a very thorough 
•repair after the settlement of the present incumbent in 1840. 

The glebe, according to a recent survey, contains 21 acres, 3 
roods, 18 polls imperial, and may be valued at L. 17 per annum. 

• The stipend, including communion elements, amounts to L. 66, 
2s. 2d. in money, 98 bolls, 4 stones, 4 lbs. white meal, — 19 bolls 
7 stones, I lb. farm meal, — 15 quarters, 4 bushels, 1 peck bear, 
1 bushel, — 3 pecks, 1 gallon, oats, — 27 quarters, 5 bushels, 1 
peck, 1 gallon, 1 quart barley. 

There is no other place of worship, whether chapel of ease, or 
Dissenting, within the parish, besides the parish church. 

The number of families in the parish belonging to the Esta- 
blished Church is 251. The number of Dissenting families is 4, 
and these occasionally attend the parish church. Divine service is 
remarkably well attended. The average number of communi- 
cants is about 600, 

There is a Parochial Society for Religious and Missionary Pur- 
poses in the parish, which is in a very flourishing state. The 
amount of last year's contributions exceeded L.20. The sum col- 
lected is divided among the Home and Foreign Missions of the 
Assembly, the London Tract, Bible, and other missionary societies. 

The amount of collections made in the church during the by- 
past year, for religious and charitable purposes, amounted to be- 
tween L.90 and L.IOO. 

• Education— There are at present three schools in the parish ; 
one parochial school, and two on teachers' own adventure. The 
parish school is situated beside the church, and under the same 
roof with the master's own accommodation. The branches tauo-ht 
are, reading, writing, arithmetic, geography, and English gramnar. 
The schoolmaster's salary is L.30 per annum, including the value 
of a garden. The probable amount of fees may be somewhere 
between L.IO and L.12. The unendowed schools are taught by 
individuals in humble circumstances and of limited education, but 
who are assiduous in their endeavours to promote the spirit- 
ual as well as intellectual improvement of the children placed un- 
der their, care. In an extended parish like this, with a scattered 
population, two side-schools are indispensable, one towards eithe

extremity ; and it is much to be regretted that there exist not the 
means of giving to the teachers a larger share of that comfort and 
encouragement to which the important duties they discharge so 
justly entitle them. 

There are three Sabbath schools in the parish. They are attended 
in all by about 120 children under fourteen years of age. All tlie 
children in the three schools learn the same lessons, and come up 
to the church on the last Sabbath of every month, when they are 
examined on the whole month's lessons by the minister after di- 
vine service. A syllabus of lessons is prepared, printed, and a 
copy sent to each family in the parish. A class, called the Bible 
class, for young persons of both sexes above fourteen years of age, 
is taught by the minister in the church on alternate Sabbaths. 
This class is attended by between 60 and 70 scholars. Here, 
also, a syllabus of lessons is used. Great advantages have been 
found to attend this system of religious instruction ; 1. It has all 
the advantages of regularity, and of unity of design. Not only 
are the distractions consequent on a multiplicity of tasks and dif- 
ferent stages of progress in the school avoided, but occasional ab- 
sence from a bad day or sickness need not prevent any from pre- 
paring all the exercises against the monthly revisal. 2. It brings 
the young of the parish completely under the eye of the minister, 
and gives an impulse to the zeal and diligence both of teachers 
and taught. 3. By means of the syllabus, those parents who are 
opposed to Sabbath school teaching, or are prevented by circum- 
stances from availing themselves of it, have an opportunity of in- 
structing their children in the same lessons at home ; and this 
done, of sending them up to church on the last Sabbath of the 
month, to be examined along with the other children. The les- 
sons prescribed to the Bible class are drawn up with the twofold 
view of preparing young communicants, and of promoting the spi- 
ritual improvement of the more advanced among the young. 

Literature. — There are two libraries in the parish. The one, 
for the use of the people generally, was instituted in 1816, and 
now comprises about 470 volumes on history, biography, travels, 
&amp;c. with a large proportion of religious books ; the other, which 
was instituted last year, chiefly on the foundation of a church col- 
lection, is strictly a religious library, destined for the use of the 
Sabbath scholars. No payment is required for the use of it. The 

• A small arniual contribution is required of readers. 



NEW MACHAR.

books were selected with care, and, through the children, not un- 
frequently find their way into the hands of the parents. 

Charitable and other Institutions.— k savings bank was estabhsh- 
ed in the parish in 1832. Amount of deposits up to June .5th 
1841, was L,836; amount invested during year previous to that 
date, L.129; amount withdrawn during same period, L.62. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is about 32; the average sum allotted to 
each about L.2, 12s. annually. Besides the ordinary poor, as 
many as five or six or more poor householders require occasional 
relief. The yearly amount of church collections, on an average of 
the last four vears, is L. 58, 3s. ; interest of poor's fund lent, do- 
nations, legacies, and other casual supplies, L.26, Is. In cases 
of continual sickness or other domestic distress in a poor family, 
it is no uncommon thing to raise a subscription for their relief. 
This has been done oftener than once during the last year, and 
very considerable sums have been raised. On the part of some, 
that true feeling of independence is still manifested by a reluct- 
ance to fall upon the poor's funds ; but on the part of many, 
little ov no such feeling is exhibited; and the desire of parties, 
once received upon the fund, seems to be to get all they can- 

Fairs. — It has been attempted, within the last few years, to es- 
tablish a fair in the parish for the sale of cattle, but hitherto the 
business transacted has been on a very limited scale. 

Inns, Ale-houses, Sj-c. — There are 3 inns in the parish, on the 
line of turnpike road. 

Fuel. — The fuel in general use is peat and turf, procured from 
one or other of the mosses in the parish. But the use of coal is 
rapidly on the increase ; and though it has to be driven from Aber- 
deen, it is in most cases now found to be nearly as economical.

PKESBYTERY OF STRATHBOGIE, SYNOD OF MO 



I _TopoGRAPHY AND Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, §-c.-This parish consisted originally of 
two distinct parishes, Dumbennan and Kinoir. The lormer pa- 
rish which, to a great extent, is surrounde d by hills, IS said trom 
this' circumstance to have received the name of Dumbennan, or 
the foot oj the hill\ It is situated at the termination of the two 
straths, formed by the rivers Bogie and Deveron The hill be- 
tween these rivers, which is of considerable height, and is called 
the Clashmach, or gray -headed hill, t forms P- ° h'"'. 
The latter parish of Kinoir, or the yellow-headed hill, § stretche 
for about five miles along the right side of the Deveron, after it 
is joined by the Bogie on the right, and strangely enough, though 
ecclesiastically united to Dumbennan, it is separated from it for 
xxiore than a quarter of a mile from this junction upwards, by 
the neighbouring parish of Drumblade. H The two parishes were 
united fnto the one parish of Huntly in 1727. Its greatest length 
TT miles, and breadth 4 miles. It is bounded on the 
north chiefly by the parish of Rothiemay ; on the east, by a small 
Tl o the parish o'f Forgue, but chiefly by Drumblade ; south, 
by Gartly ; and west, by the parishes of Glass and Cairnie. 

Rivers Hzlls, c.-The river Bogie, which rises in the parish 
of llh doir, Ibout twelve miles to the south-west divides this 
pLfs from Drumblade for two or three miles, and die Deveron, 
Tom portions of Glass, Cairnie, and Rothiemay. The Deveron

has its source in the parish of, Cabrach, fifteen miles above Huntly, 
and after receiving the Bogie about a quarter of a mile below the 
town, flows onwards north-east for twenty-one miles, where it falls 
into the sea at Banff. In the great floods of 1829, the town was 
entirely surrounded by water; and though the Huntly bridges es- 
caped, the bridges above the town, both on the Bogie and De- 
veron, were swept away. The ruins of several still remain. 

The town of Huntly is embosomed in hills. Its climate, 
though cold, is exceedingly healthful. The water of the Bogie 
is pure, and fit for every purpose. It produces excellent trouts, 
and the Deveron affords good fishing both in salmon and trout. 
The soil of Kinoir is generally of a cold clayey description ; but 
in Dumbennan, there is more of a deep loamy soil. The rocks 
are almost entirely of granite. Near the junction of the two ri- 
vers, some traces have been found of plumbago or black lead, 
graphite, a compound of carbon and iron, but though of very 
superior quality, it has not been found in sufficient quantity to 
encourage the expenditure of any labour on it. Limestone also 
has been found in small quantity, and susceptible of a very high 
polish. On the top of St Mungo's Hill, which is in the Kinoir 
district, in the east of the parish, there are traces of volcanic ac- 
tion in a large crater-like cavity, around which there have been 
found fragments of lava and pumice-stone. 

II. — Civil History. 
There is a short account of this parish in one of the papers pub- 
lished by the Spalding Club, and written, it is said, by Spalding 
himself; but whether as useful as it is believed to be curious, the 
writer of this, never having seen it, cannot take upon himself to 
determine. 

- Battle-hill, Castle, Sfc — The only historical events of importance 
are connected with the Battle-hill in the Kinoir district, next to St 
Mungo's, and the old Castle of Huntly. The former was the scene 
of the battle of Sleoch, the name of a neighbouring farm in the pa- 
rish of Drumblade, of which an important notice will be found in 
the account of Drumblade in this work. The castle, which is now 
in ruins, evidently consists of two parts,— the remains of the ancient 
castle of Strathbogie, and the comparatively modern Huntly Cas- 
tle. All that remains of the former are a few vaults, forming apparent- 
ly part of the enclosure of the court-yard, which, from the immense 
thickness of the walls now overgrown with ivy, and the coarse- 
iiess of the structure, must be of a very early date. It originally

belonged to the ancient and powerful family of the Comyns ; but 
the Lords of Gordon, a powerful border clan, having nearly ex- 
tirpated the Comyns in the wars of King Robert the Bruce, re- 
ceived, as their reward, the castle of Strathbogie, with the adjoin- 
ing demesne. This castle was destroyed after the battle of Glen- 
livetin 1594; and the present Huntly Castle was built in 1602 
by the first Marquis of that name. The chief part of it consists 
of a large circular tower, erected evidently for warlike purposes, 
and which seems to have been surrounded by a moat. It is a fine 
ruin, but the interior apartments appear to have fallen much into 
decay since the last Accomit of this parish was written. The stone 
steps in the " spacious turnpike stair" have been removed; most 
of the ornaments in these apartments have been stripped off for 
the adornment of Huntly Lodge ; the square towers also which 
once stood in the avenue leading to the castle are among the things 
that were ; and their former site has recently been occupied by 
the Duchess of Gordon's new schools. It is now upwards of forty 
years since any part of the castle was inhabited ; and about ten 
years ago, Huntly Lodge, which originally was but a shooting-box 
of the Duke of Gordon's, was enlarged into the present handsome 
and commodious building. It is situated on the rising ground to 
the north of the castle, about a quarter of a mile distant from it, 
and is seen to advantage from various directions. After the fa- 
mily seat was removed to Gordon Castle at Fochabers, this place 
became the residence of the Marquis of Huntly, the Duke of 
Gordon's eldest son ; but the Dukedom having become extinct on 
the death of George the fifth Duke in 1836, the lodge is at pre- 
sent occupied by Her Grace the Duchess-Dowager of Gordon. 

Other Buildings.— South of the castle, and looking along Gor- 
don Street, the principal street of the town, a large and very hand- 
some building has recently been erected by the Duchess for edu- 
cational purposes. It was intended as a monument in memory of 
her late husband ; but it will also be an enduring memorial of this 
Noble lady's munificence and zeal in promoting the best interests 
of the people among whom she resides. 

The whole parish is the property of the Duke of Richmond, 
with the exception of a small portion in the lower end of Kinoir, 
which belongs to Mr Gordon of Avochy. On these lands, there 
is part of the ruins of the old castle of Avochy ; but the present 
house connected with the property is a plain building of very hum- 
ble pretensions. The only other buildings of importance are, tlie 



HUNTLY.

parish church, erected in 1805, and seated for 1800; the new 
church, built in 1840, and seated for 945, which cost, without Go- 
vernment drawback, upwards of L.1300 ; the Roman Catholic 
chapel, which is surmounted by a curious rather than a handsome 
tower, the top of it appearing in the shape of a crown, built in 1834, 
and seated for 350, — which cost, with the priest's house, L.1660, of 
•which L.IOOO was paid by Gordon of Wardhouse ; the Indepen- 
dent chapel, built in 1802, with 500 sittings ; the Secession church 
in 1809, with 340 sittings; and the Episcopal chapel in 1770, 
with 140 sittings. It is in contemplation at present to build a 
new Episcopal chapel. 

III. — Population. 
According to the Parliamentary returns, the population of the 
whole parish was, 

In 1801, . 2863 
1831, . 3545 
1841, . 3642 

Taking the whole population at 3700, which, from the writer's 
own statistical notes, he believes at present to be nearly correct, 
the following will be found to be about the proportions in the re- 
spective districts, viz.— In the Dumbennan country district, 90 
families to a population of 408, equal to 4.53 in each family ; in 
the Kinoir country district, 93 families to a population of 422, 
equal to nearly 4.54 in each fVimily; in the town of Huntly, 804 
families to a population of 2870, equal to nearly 3.51 in each family. 

The small proportion of individuals in each family in the town 
compared with the country, arises from the large number of single 
women, who, when disabled from active employment by atxeor 
other causes, generally find their way into the town from the whole 
surrounding district of country, and live in separate places by them- 
selves. And it may also be mentioned here, that, in 1831, the 
population of the town of Huntly was 2585, leaving 960 for the 
country; the diminution in this portion having arisen from the 
breaking up of a number of the smaller farms at the last lease let- 
ting. As a specimen of the number of children in each family, 
m a district of the town containing 242 families,— excluding the 
families of bachelors and single women where there are no child- 
ren, but reckoning every family where there are any children or a 
married couple,— there were found 542 children, giving 2 to each. 

Her Grace the Duchess of Gordon is resident in the parish ; 
and, besides a few merchants and others deriving considerable in- 



1040 ABERDEENSHIRE. 

come from trade, there are about forty individuals or families, chief- 
ly in the town, of independent means, varying from L.50 to L.500 
or L.600 per annum. The people are a shrewd and intelli- 
gent race, some of them indeed exhibiting intellectual powers of a 
very high order. They are in general peaceable and well-be- 
haved, and free from many of the grosser vices. Poaching 
exists in a small degree, and drunkenness in a greater. The 
illegitimate births in the parish may amount to about 12 per 
annum. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture, Sfc. — The writer has not been able to ascertain 
the proportion of land which is cultivated or not ; but it may 
be mentioned, that very little could be brought under culti- 
vation which is not already so. Several thousand acres have 
been recently planted with fir, larch, birch, elm, and oak in this 
and the neighbouring parish of Cairnie, which in a few years 
will greatly improve the face of the country. The average rent 
of land per acre is about 16s.; but for " the Huntly acres" it is 
L.2 per acre, and the rental of the parish, which is partly paid in 
kind for 1841, is as follows:— 

Kinoir, . L.1204 0 0 

• Dumbennan, . 2280 0 0 

Huntly acres, . 1050 0 0 

Feu duties of Huntly, . 122 0 0 

Avocby, about, . 400 0 0 

Total, I-.5056 0 0 

This is not a sheep country; but the farmers on the high lands 
of the parish have a few flocks which range the hills. Cattle, 
however, are reared in considerable numbers on all the farms, and 
exported to the markets in the south; though, whether this will 
be continued to the same extent is doubtful. The only grains 
cultivated in this parish are oats and bear, chiefly the former. 
Wheat does not grow here. 

Improvements, Leases, Sfc.-The greatest agricultural improve- 
ments needed in this parish are thorough draining and enclosures, 
and these are prosecuted every year with great vigour, the latter 
with tiles as well as loose stones. The leases almost uniformly ex- 
tend to nineteen years; but at the last letting, in 1841, the sys- 
tem was adopted of throwing many of the smaller farms into one. 

There is a Farmer's Club in this parish, for the unprovement 
of agriculture, with the Duke of Richmond as patron the pro- 
ceedings of which are conducted with some vigour: and there are 



HUNTLY. 1041 

coiin6ct6ci with it jin Ajriculturdl library, and an annual show of 
cattle, with competition for prizes. 

Manufactures, S-c. — In regard to manufactures, there are none 
in this parish worth naming. Formerly the manufiicture of linen 
■was carried on in Huntly, to the extent of L.40,000 per annum ; 
and latterly, till within a year ago, there were about twenty or 
thirty weavers in this trade employed by houses in Aberdeen ; and 
in the same way, employment in weaving worsted and in knitting 
stockings was got for many of the old women in the parish ; but the 
former is entirely extinct, and the latter has also been withdrawn. 
There is a bleachtield on the Bogie of extensive fame, and a con- 
siderable run of trade ; and a tan-work and distillery are in active 
operation. In the town of Huntly, there are three banks, branches 
of the North of Scotland, the Town and County, and Aberdeen 
Banks; 2 merchants, including 2 hardware shops, and 6 for 
cloths and haberdashery; 5 bakers, and 4 butchers. There is a 
Gas Company also, which has been very successful in its operation, 
as almost every house in the town is supplied with this most use- 
ful light. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
_ Town, .c The town of Huntly, which is a burgh of barony, 
IS bu.lt on what originally was a barren heath and marshy swamp 
h is now well drauied, and its situation is peculiarly heahhful be- 
ing sheltered from almost every wind by the surrounding hills. 
Ihe present population is about 2900. For its trade it depends 
ch.efly on the surrounding district of country; but it has exports 
also to a very considerable extent in butter, cheese, eggs, pork, 
poultry and game. ' P "j 

The streets of the town are very regularly laid out. The two 
pnncpal cross each other at right angles, and in the centre there 
IS a spacious square, surrounded by buildings, some of which are 
of a very superior description. On one side of the square, a hand- 

Zn"' 'iT-' "' apartments for 

the North of Scotland Bank office. 

Roads, Bridges, c-c.-The principal" road from Aberdeen to 
P Inverness passes through this square, crossing each of the rivers 
by an excellent bridge at either extremity of the town. The in 

botr P"'"' " ''y communication with 

' both these towns by the Mail and Defiance coaches, and with tl e 
former by the Duchess of Gordon coach every alternate dav

the west, from Elgin by Keith and Fochabers, twenty-seven miles; 
and from Inverness by the same road, seventy-two m\es ;io the 
south again, there is a good turnpike-roadin the d.recUon of Rhyme 
Alford, &amp;c.; to the north, another road leads to For soy, distant 
seventeen miles; and north-east, there is another pubhc road to 
Banff, which is twenty-one miles from Huntly. 

E clesiastical SMe.-The parish church is -nvemen ly 
situated in the middle of the town. It was bmltm 1805,andis a ve y 
Tiu structure, immensely too large, being seated to accommodate 
I sTo persons. The manse, which is on the south road, about a quar- 
ter of a mile from the town, was built about the same time, and is 
in a very good state of repair. The glebe contains 12 acres, and 
is vorth about L.25 per annum, and the annual average amount of 

Huntly was built in the end of the year 
1840 The immediate occasion of its erection arose from the sus- 
pension, and ultimately, the deposition, by 'l- Ge"eral Assea- 
blY of Mr Walker, the parish minister: but ,t had long been felt, 
that there was need of an ecclesiastical division of th,s populous 
nl in e country, very scattered parish. The new church 
s rved by a probationer, who is stationed there by the Genera 
Assembly's Committee as missionary ; but eventually .t .s proposed 
to erect i, into a distinct ,uoad sacra church and par.sh The 
missionary's salary of L. 100 per annum is paid from a lund lais- 
Td expressly for these church purposes. There are also other four 
Ipe'ls in 'the town belonging to the Independents, Sece ers 

EpiLopalians, and Roman fZIo: 
of the Independent mmister is L. 100; and ot tne oete 
ter Tt is understood to be about L.60 ; both being raised by seat- 
ent a d contributions among the people. The preset Episco- 
pal minister is also chaplain to her Grace the Duchess of Gor-

don, and with his family, resides in a separate house at Huntlv 
Lodge. The Roman Catholic bishop resides at Preshome, in the 
Enzie, parish of Rathven. 

The people in this parish, and, indeed, iy this district, are cer- 
tainly remarkable for their church-going habits. 

Missionimj Societies, Sc. — In the new church, there have not 
as yet been any missionary Societies formally constituted, but 
prayer-meetings, expressly for missionary objects, are statedly 
held, and, besides other objects, collections are made, and contri- 
butions raised for all the Assembly's Schemes. During the- year 
1841, L.40 were raised by this congregation for educational, and 
L.60 for missionary purposes. Among the Independents chiefly, 
there are auxiliaries to the London Missionary and British and 
Foreign Bible Societies; their contributions to which, it is under- 
stood, amount to about L.60 per annum. There is also an auxi- 
liary to the Edinburgh Bible Society, chiefly in connection with 
the parish church. 

Education — The educational wants of the town of Huntly are, 
on the whole, at present, well supplied. In the Duchess of Gov- 
don's new buildings, ample accommodation is provided for the pa- 
rochial school, the new school,— which is chiefly connected with 
the new church,— an infant school, and a sewing school. All 
these are very efliciently taught. In the two first, all the branches 
of an ordinary education are taught, as also Latin, Greek, French 
and mathematics. There are also six adventure schools in the 
town, caiefly for reading, taught by females with various degrees of 
success; another by an old pensioner, who teaches reading, writ- 
ing, and accounts with very considerable skill ; and one excellent 
boarding and day-school for the higher branches of female educa- 
tion. The salary of the parochial teacher is L.34 ; from the Dick 
Bequest he receives L.30 per annum ; his school-fees may be about 
U60, and he derives L.8 from other emoluments. The teacher 
of the new school receives a salary of L.20 per annum, which is 
raised by subscription among the members of the new church, the 
security for which evidently must depend mainly on his own effi- 
ciency ; and his school-fees amount to upwards of L. 50 The 
teachers of the sewing and infant schools at present receive sala- 
ries from her Grace the Duchess of Gordon. The fees of the pa- 
rochial and new schools vary from 2s. 6d. to 5s. per quarter, L,t 
when the higher branches are included, they are 7s. 6d. ; in the 
intant school, the fee is one penny per week, and in the private fe- 



104i 



ABERDEENSHIRE. 



male schools, 1. 6d. or 2s. per quarter. The greatest number of 
children attending these schools during last spring, the busiest 
season of the year, was nearly as follows : Parochial school about 
140; new school, 123; infant school, 80 ; sewing school, 30 ; 
ladies' boarding-school, about 40; private adventure schools, 110; 
total, 528. Deducting the numbers at the infant and sewing schools, 
there are still about 420, most of them above six years of age, 
in daily attendance at school. In summer, about a fourth of 
these are withdrawn to be employed in herding and other country 
labour.f Of the adult population, there are very few who cannot 
read, and not many more unable to write. The people, in general, 
are alive to the advantages of the mere elements of education ; but 
they are only as yet learning the advantages even of such branches 
as geography, grammar, &amp;c., and certainly they are not sufficiently 
sensible of the necessity of the attendance at school being regular. 
The country districts of the parish are not so well supplied. In 
the Dumbennan district, there is an Assembly's school, which, at 
present, is not well attended ; and in Kinoir, there is a private ad- 
venture school for reading, writing, and accounts, taught with to- 
lerable efficiency, and attended in spring by 50 or 60 children, and 
another school conducted by a female, which is attended by about 
20 or 30 little children. , 

Of Sabbath schools there are in the town, one connected with 
the new church, attended by nearly 200 scholars ; another connect- 
ed with the parish church with about 100 scholars ; and a third 
conducted by the Independents. The Roman Cathohc priest, it 
is understood, has also a Sabbath school. In Kinoir, there is an- 
other Sabbath school connected with the new church,-the scho- 
lars of which are about 30, and in LonghiU, in the Dumbennan 
parish, another conducted by Dissenters. 

Literature.— Besxde the Farmers' Agricultural Library, there 
is a circulating library maintained by the principal bookseller ; an- 
other called the Evangelical Subscription Library, which contains 
some excellent books, but none of a controversial character ; and a 
Coffee and Reading-room, with one or two provincial papers. 

Charitable and other Institutions.- Ahout sixteen years ago, Dr 
Scott, a native of this parish, died in India, leaving, in the hands

of certain trustees, part of his property, to be employed in erect- 
ing and endowing a house in Huntly for the maintenance of aged 
and indigent natives, and a farther sum of money for the establish - 
ment of a bursary of L.20 annually to a student in divinity of the 
Established Church. The former endowment is still in abeyance, 
as Dr Scott's widow liferents the whole property, and, on this ac- 
count, the ultimate value of this legacy cannot, at present, be ac- 
curately ascertained ; but the latter has been in operation now for 
six or eight years. 

There is a Dispensary in the town, maintained by subscription, for 
supplying the poor gratuitously with medicines ; and in connection 
with this, the regular practitioners, of whom there are four, visit 
and prescribe for the poor at their own houses. 

The Huntly Savings Bank for this and a few of the surround- 
ing iarishes is in a very flourishing condition. The total amount 
of deposits at the last general statement, a month or two ago, was 
L.3644, 15s. 5d.; the number of depositors, — tradesmen, servants, 
and the poorer classes, is 318; and, during the years 1840, 41, 
and 42, the increase on the deposits has successively been L,36J, 
L.416, and L.51 1, and that, too, notwithstanding the double draw- 
back of the dulness of trade and the springing up of similar insti- 
tutions in the surrounding districts. The interest allowed on the 
deposits is 3 per cent. 

Friendly Societies. — Formerly, there were several Friendly Socie- 
ties in the parish ; but these have all become extinct, as the meet- 
ings of their managers had degenerated into mere scenes of dissi- 
pation. One, however, has been recently instituted by a branch 
of the Total Abstinence Society. 

Poor's Funds. — The number of paupers in the parish is greatlv 
increased by individuals, when disabled by age or otherwise frorn 
country work, or cast out of their small farms, repairing to the town 
from the neighbouring parishes, and there contriving to support 
themselves from various sources, till they acquire a legal residence 
in this parish. The number of paupers on the poor's roll is ac- 
cordingly 160, and the average sum allotted to each is about 
L.1, 6s. per annum ; but a few, who are bedridden, receive to the 
extent of L.2, JOs. and L.5 per annum. There is at present one 
pauper lunatic who is maintained at an expense of from L 12 to 
L.15. 

Formerly, the poor's funds were made up of the ordinary and 
other collections in the parish church, amounting annually to up- 



1046 ABERDEKNSHIRR. 

wards of L.lOO, and the pew-rents collected from the sitters in 
the church, amounting to about L.40, which were given as the _ 
Duke of Richmond's contribution. But last year, these contribu- 
tions being insufficient, it was found necessary to have recourse to 
a voluntary parochial contribution, which, including L.80 sub- 
scribed by the Duke of Richmond, L.25 by the Duchess of Gor- 
don, and L.5 by Mr Gordon of Avochy, yielded L.lOO; the col- 
lections at the church doors amounting besides to about L.70. It 
is exceeding probable, however, that, in a year or two, a legal as- 
sessment will be laid on the parish. 

Besides the regular paupers, there are not a few poor persons 
who shrink from the idea of receiving public relief; but, in 
the former class, there are many who regularly, and with much 
boldness, on a fixed day every week, go their rounds to receive 
their accustomed alms. 

Fairs, c-c— There are about twelve annual fairs or markets held 
in Huntly, chiefly during the months of summer and autumn. 
Two of these, called " feeing markets," occur at Whitsunday and 
Martinmas, and are among the largest of the whole year. They 
are for the hiring of farm-servants, and may be described as un- 
mitigated moral nuisances,— not merely from the evils inseparably 
attendant on the congregating of large numbers of thoughtless 
young people of both sexes, with money in their pockets, and many 
of them with loose moral principles, but also from the utter de- 
struction of those moral checks and mutual kindly feelings which 
ought to subsist between master and servant,— the one class bemg 
hilled generally without any regard to their character, as if they 
were mere beasts of burden, and the other feeling little interest in 
the welfare of those who are sure to leave them in half a year. 
The other markets are for the sale of horses and cattle. 

Inns, 4-c.— In the town of Huntly, there is one excellent inn, 
kept by a highly respectable individual, and four others of a lower 
P-rade/ Besides these, there are twelve publichouses, and two or 
three grocers sell spirituous liquors. The Total Abstinence Society 
has certainly been a useful auxiliary to the Gospel, in reclaiming 
some drunkards, and diminishing the custom of some of thce 

houses. . 

FuelTe fuel here used consists of peat or turf, brouglit 
chiefly from a moss five miles distant, and sold at about 3s. lor 
a cart load; English coal, brought by sea to Portsoy, arid thence 
conveyed to Huntly, a distance of seventeen miles, by land car-

riae, and sold at about Is. 8d. per barrel, which is equal to about 
L.], 6s. per ton; and fir wood, procured at about 3s. per cart 
load, from the thinnings of the neighbouring woods. Long splin- 
ters of resinous pine are also used, chiefly in the country houses, 
as a substitute for lamps.

PRESIHYTERY OF KINCARDINE o'NEII., SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. ROBERT MILNE MILLER, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — Aboyne is compounded of the Gaelic words. A, afoid, 
and boinne or buinne, a current of rippling loater ; a name very 
descriptive of a ford in the Dee, a little south of the church. 
Glentanner is compounded of the Gaelic words GJean-tan-ar, 
signifying the glen of scanty arable land. The two parishes being 
now united are generally known by the name of Aboyne. 

Boundaries and Extent. — The united parish, on the west and 
left bank of the Dee, is bounded by Tullich, and on the right 
bank by Glenmuick; on the south, by Lochlee and Birse ; on 
the east, by Kincardine O'Neil; and on the north, by Lumphan- 
an, CouU, and Logie-Coldstone ; the boundary line being gene- 
rally formed by mountain-crests, the river Dee, or some of its 
tributary streams. A detached part, containing a population of 
about 60, is situated on the left bank of the Feugh, not far from 
the north base of Clach-na-bein, and about nine miles south-east 
from the church. Between this detached part and the church, al- 
most the whole of Birse intervenes. The form of the parish is 
very irregular. Its length from east to west may be 13 miles, 
and its breadth from north to south, 12 miles. These, how- 
ever, are taken from extreme points ; and its whole area may 
be calculated at 37,000 imperial acres. Glentanner is on the 
right bank of the Dee, bounded on the north by that river, and 



1048 



ABEUURENSIIIUE. 



on the west, south, and east by ranges of the Grampians. The 
arable part is formed into two divisions by the hill of Bellrory, 
sloping eastward near to the Inver of the Tanner, which flows 
through the south-east division, or what is generally known by the 
name of Tannerside. The other division slopes from Bellrory in 
a north-east direction towards the Fan. About a mile east of the 
Fan, on the right bank of the Dee, are the ruins of the old church 
of Glentanner, with an enclosed burying-ground still around it ; 
which, having been thatched with heather, was known by the name 
of the Black "chapel of the Moor. Previously to Glentanner's be- 
ing united to Aboyne, it formed a separate chaplainry. Aboyne, 
which is mostly on the left bank of the Dee, was then united to 
Tullich, with an intermediate chapel at Braeroddach equally dis- 
tant from the churches of Aboyne and Tullich. At what period 
Aboyne and Glentanner were formed into one parish, is unknown 
to the writer; but, previously to 1763, there was a church at each, 
in which the incumbent performed Divine service in the rotation 
of two Sabbaths at Aboyne, and the third at Glentanner. That 
part of Aboyne on the north or left bank of the Dee formed the 
barony which, in the words of Gordon of Straloch, " titulos Ba- 
ronis Paralamentarii dat Marchionis Huntlaei filiorum uni." Its 
burgh, called Charlestown, formerly Bunty, stands near Aboyne 
Castle. The tolbooth was demolished about fifty years ago ; and 
all traces of the pot and gallows also are nearly effaced. 

Climate.— The banks of the Dee and braes of Marr have long 
been celebrated as favourable to health, and although so far inland 
as Aboyne, the parish being between the twenty-fourth and 
thirty-seventh mile-stones from Aberdeen, heavy falls of snow in 
winter, accompanied with intense frost, do often occur, yet the ge- 
neral salubrity of the air is not destroyed by those sudden alterna- 
tions of heat and cold which are frequent in localities nearer the 
coast, and more under the influence of the sea breeze. The dry 
and sandy soil of Strathdee, the shelter of its close and numerous 
woods, and the reflection of the sun's rays from the mountains 
which tower on either side, all combine to raise the temperature, 
and render the climate remarkably genial. Hence many stran- 
gers resort in summer to this district, for the recovery or invigora- 
tion of their health, by breathing the salubrious air, and drinking 

« Fan-" a descent." The river here, in a confined channel, pas.es with great 
impetuosity over a ledge of rocks.

goat whey, or chalybeate water. The most of these visitors are 
contented for exercise, with a walk along the shaded banks of the 
river, while a few, more to brace their constitutions, may be seen 
threading their way through heath and alpine forests, or scaling 
crags and lofty hills, from whose summits may be seen the dense 
smoke of Aberdeen, Montrose, &amp;c. curling in dark clouds on the 
distant horizon. 

Hydrographj. — The river Dee, which runs either along or 
through the parish for fifteen miles, rises in the highest ground of 
Britain, the mountains which separate Braemar from Badenoch ; 
and, after a north-easterly course of nearly one hundred miles, 
it falls into the German Ocean at Aberdeen. 

The Tanner, which rises from Mountkeen, the Allachy and 
the Gairney, both issuing from the Firmonth and other hills of 
the Grampian range, all flow for miles through the natural forest 
of Glentanner, then unite in one body, and, after intersecting the 
arable part of the strath in a north-easterly direction, fall into the 
Dee on its right bank, about half a mile west of the church. 

The Feugh, which rises in the forest of Birse, waters the detach- 
ed part of Aboyne, and empties itself into the Dee opposite to 
Banchory-Ternan. 

The burn of Dinnet, which is the western boundary line on the 
left bank of the Dee, is formed by te united streamlets disem- 
bogued from lochs Kinord and Dawin, in the adjoining parishes 
of Tullich and Logie-Coldstone. 

The burn which flows past, and forms a picturesque moat round 
Aboyne Castle also on the left bank of the Dee bears different 
names in its course through Cromar; and, after reaching the pa- 
rish of Aboyne, is generally called the burn of Aboyne; but here 
Us ancient name was Allach. This name has been dropped, ex- 
cept in one place, where a bridge over it near the castle is called 
the Allach Bridge. 

The burn of Dess, which, on the same bank of the Dee, divides 
the parish from the old barony of O'Neil on the east, flows about 
a mile from the loch of Auchlossen into the river, and is remark- 
able for a high and romantic cascade, called the Sloe of Dess 

Several other streamlets in the parish, such as the Aultrov 
Aultdmny, Contullich Burn, the Rossachy, &amp;c. might be me. ' 
tioned.

riers which had intersected the present courses of the running 
streams, extensive lakes must have existed. One striking place, 
where such a barrier to the Tanner appears to have stood, is near 
the influx of Aultroy, and another at Bridge of Ash. Before 
these barriers yielded to the Tanner, the upper glen must have 
formed the bed of a lake. The several heights at which the wa- 
ter, after diflPerent disruptions, had stood, may be traced,— the 
same, on a smaller scale, as the famed parallel roads in Glenroy. 
The most considerable lakes still remaining, are those of Braerod- 
dach and Auchlossen. The extent of the former may be about 
60 acres, and of the latter 300. The greater part of the latter, 
however, is in the parish of Lumphanan, and, previously to its 
outlet at Drumduan, in the parish of Aboyne, having about 150 
years ago been deepened with the view of draining the whole lake, 
must have been of more than double its present extent, and its 
waters had then reached the strongly fortified mound of Peel Bog, 
under whose fosse Macbeth received his death wound. Withm 
the policies of Aboyne Castle, there is also a lake covering 32 
acres, artificially formed, and interspersed with wooded islets. 
From the higher grounds overlooking this lake, the view is exten- 
sive and interesting. , i, j- 

Numerous channels, in which it is evident the Dee has for- 
merly run, many of them at a very considerable altitude above its 
. present bed, are distinctly visible; at which period, as already 
noticed, lakes must have stood on some of the land basins, now 
filled with water borne debris, gradually excavated from the high- 
er grounds by the descending river. The water power within the 
parish of which the only use now made is to drive a few mills for 
country purposes, would be more than sufficient to supersede the 
steam required for moving the machinery in all the public wod.s 
in and about Aberdeen ; and to render the power more available, 
a railroad along the banks of the Dee could be formed more easi- 
ly than in most localities, the gradient being only 420 feet on 31 
miles, and it is thought no tunnelling would be required. 

Geology and Mineralogy. -The geognostic appearance of the

The granite is various, and, as its component parts of quartz, mica, 
felspar, and hornblende predominate, differs iu hardness of grain, 
and is diversified in colour from the white to the black tinge and 
the red. Some of the red has been beautifully polished. It much 
resembles that of Peterhead, but is more variegated in size of grain 
and shades of colour. Along the valley of the Dee, to the east 
of Lpchnagar, rolled masses of the primitive rock of that moun- 
tain are to be found ; and it is also remarkable, that, at a lower 
level, fragments of the black ferruginous rock, of which the ledge 
at the Linn of Muick is composed, can be traced along the same 
valley, but in a line frequently diverging from the present channel 
of the Dee, and only found to the east of the confluence of the 
Muick with the Dee. To account for this, the appearance at the 
Linn indicates that the river, in some of its fitful risings, had swept 
before it a huge mass of the opposing rock, — hence the disruption 
in its fall, and, tossed by the maddened stream against harder for- 
mations, it had been split into fragments, and deposited along the 
then channel of the Dee. In the hill of Glentanner, topazes fit 
for the lapidary are often found. Crystallized quartz, both pale 
and rose, are frequently picked up, and occasionally, in the heart of 
granite blocks, beautifully studded nests of them are disclosed. 
Gneiss is common in the parish, and, in a few localities, limestone 
not very pure on both sides of the river ; also ironstone, and, in 
stray river boulders, faint appearances of manganese conglomerat- 
ing with quartz occur, but no traces of any organic remains. 

On the left bank of Aultdinny is fuller's earth, which has been 
successfully tried as a substitute for soap. In the hills are exten- 
sive peat-mosses, in some of which, after the removal of the peat 
formation, at the depth of five or six feet, the original surface ap- 
pears covered with charred oak, hazel, and birch. The soil along 
the banks of the rivers is thin ; from the rapidity of the streams, 
the only alluvial deposit formed, is of sand and gravel ; but ascend- 
ing from the rivers the fields improve, and some of them are of 
either a black or clayey till.

Forest, extending to about 4500 acres, still exists in Glentanner. 
It is now very open, but if preserved, the most of the hills and 
valleys would soon be again covered with natural alpine fir; and 
it is observable that this tendency to extend itself is generally to- 
wards the east ; the prevailing wind, at the time the seed is ripe 
and falling, being from the west. The plantations about Aboyne 
Castle contain 2144 acres, consisting chiefly of Scotch fir, but 
.with a considerable proportion of larch, oak, ash, beech, elm, and 
other species of hard-wood and ornamental trees. 

The plantations on the Balnacraig property amount to about 
1400 acres. They are almost exclusively of Scotch fir, and very 
advantageously situated on the banks of the Dee, for transmission 
of the timber to Aberdeen. The whole of the woods in the pa- 
rish are flourishing, and give every indication that the soil and 
climate are congenial for their support. 

II. — Civil History. 

Eminent Men. — The chief characters of eminence connected 
with this parish have been the Earls of Aboyne and members of 
that Noble family ; but an account of the more distinguished of 
these is to be found in the general history of Scotland. It may 
not, however, be out of place here to state, that George, fifth 
Earl of Aboyne, succeeded to the Marquisate of Huntly on the 
death of George, fifth and last Duke of Gordon, eighth Marquis 
of Huntly, on 28th May 1836. The pedigree, as on that occa- 
sion proved before the House of Lords, shows that the late Earl 
and his son, the present Marquis, have been seized in the estates 
of Aboyne since 1732, the unusual period of 110 years; and that 
since the lamented death of the last Duke, S. P., the Marquis 
has become chief of the Gordons, a clan ever bydand ; and that 
the loyalty which held the Crown on James II.'s head, "animo non 
astutia," has never been wantinsf in their chief. 

Adam Gordon of Aboyne, second son of George, second Earl 
of Huntly by his Countess the Lady -Jean Stuart, daughter of 
James I., became Earl of Sutherland by marrying Elizabeth, sole 
heiress of John, thirteenth Earl of Sutherland. This Countess 
Elizabeth died in 1535, and her husband. Earl Adam, in 1537, 
both at Ferrack, now Ferrar in Aboyne; and were buried there. 
Sir R. Gordon's History of the Sutherland family, page 103. 

Will iam Bisset of Aboyne, and chief of the tribe, was accused 
of burning the House at Haddington, in which, 1242, Patrick, 
Earl of Athol, and two of his servants were consumed. Bisset

proved, by the evidence of the Queen, that he was that night at 
Forfar. The Chronici Scotiae even state that he was in " Castro suo 
de Obeyne." He offered to assert his innocence in single com- 
bat ; this was decHned ; and some of the Aboyne vassals having 
been that night seen at Haddington, and enmity subsisting between 
Athol and the Bissets, William was afraid of the power of his ad- 
versaries, the Cunimines, and did not stand his trial, but passed 
over into Ireland, where, as stated by Buchanan, lib. vii. cap. 57, 
he left a noble family. This family is now extinct. In the pa- 
rish of Aboyne, there is not now a single person of the name 
of Bisset ; and within less than a century 1335 the Earl of Athol 
and other two Cummine chiefs fell in Edward's army at Culblean, 
six miles from Aboyne Castle. 

The late Thomas Innes, A. M., Principal of the Scots College 
at Paris, was born at Drumgask, in the parish of Aboyne. He is 
well known as one of the most learned of Scottish antiquaries. 
He published a Critical Essay on the Ancient Inhabitants of Scot- 
land, two vols. 8vo, London, 1729. His elder brother Lewis was 
his predecessor in said college ; and more lately, their nephew, 
the Reverend Henry Innes, was procurator of the same college. 
This individual died at the advanced age of eighty-eight, and was 
buried at Aboyne in 1832 ; and it is remarkable of him, that he 
was probably the last individual in this country who corresponded 
with the unfortunate Charles Stewart. Two of that Prince's let- 
ters addressed to him, the one dated " Florence, 18th July 1777," 
and the other, " Florence, 13th February 1778," and signed 
Charles R., are now before the writer. 

The late James Cromar, A. M., a very successful teacher of 
youth, and who died rector of the grammar-school of Aberdeen 
in 1826, was a native of this parish. 

Alexander Ross, author of the Fortunate Shepherdess, and of 
many popular songs, was translated from the office of parochial 
schoolmaster at Aboyne to that of Loch lee. 

As connected with the parish, it may be also mentioned, that 
the adventurous Peter Williamson, who, about 1740, was kid- 
napped at Aberdeen and carried to Virginia, and there sold for a 
slave, was, as stated in his autobiography, born in the parish of 
Aboyne, if not of rich, yet of reputable parents. 

Land-oivners.— These are, 1. the Marquis of Huntly, whose va- 
lued rent in the parish is L.1631, I7s. 8d. ; 2. John Farquharson 
of Finzean, with a valued rent of L.200, 4s. 6d. ; 3. Miss Farquhar-

son, Mrs Lynch, and their sisters, Misses Catherine and Louisa 
Farquharson, L. 173, 6s. 8d. who succeeded as heirs-portioners 
to their brother, the late Lewis Farquharson Innes of Bahiacraig 
and Ballogie. Their father was male representative of the ancient 
house of Inverey, and on succeeding to the lands of Ballogie and 
Balnacraig, &amp;c. in this and the neighbouring parishes of Birse and 
Kincardine, assumed the name of Innes, that of his relatives, the 
former proprietors. One of his authors, Findly Farquharson of 
Inverey, was killed carrying the Royal banner at the battle of 
Pinkie, 1547. 4. The Earl of Aberdeen, who is proprietor of a 
small farm in the parish, but to which no valued rent is attached. 

Historical Events, — There are no papers or writings of which 
the writer is aware, that can throw much light on events of former 
times, and tradition furnishes but few particulars respecting the 
early history of Aboyne; hence at what time even the castle was 
first built, the writer is unable to obtain distinct evidence. — Possi- 
bly this might be supplied by the Huntly charters, and the date 
of the royal permission for its erection ascertained. It may, how- 
ever, be inferred, from the circumstance of the castle being placed 
in a swamp, and having till in recent times the water was lower- 
ed been accessible only by boat or drawbridge, that it was erect- 
ed about the tenth or eleventh century, — the moat fortification be- 
ing then followed for castles, as previously and subsequently 
duns, rocks or some eminence secure from sudden attack were se- 
lected for strongholds and baronial castles. In 1242, it was pos- 
sessed by William Bisset, who being then, as already noticed, ac- 
cused as accessory to the death of the Earl of Athol, was sum- 
moned to stand his trial at Edinburgh. He went there, and of- 
fered to peril his life with any of his accusers, but his challenge 
was not accepted, and he being afraid 'that his judges might be 
concussed by his inveterate and powerful enemies, the Cummines, 
went with a number of his relations into voluntary exile in Ireland. 
From the chartulary of Aberdeen, it appears that the Bissets gave 
the lands of Aboyne to the Knights Templar, and it is a remark- 
able fact, that some fields near the castle still bear the name of 
" Tiran TeampuU," i. e. the Templars' ground, which circum- 
stance is evidence that Gaelic was then the vernacular language 
about Aboyne, but which has long since retired farther west. Re- 
garding the possession of the castle by the Earl of Marr, there is 
also an order from Baliol, recorded in the " Rotuli Scotiae." From 
the Knights Templar the lands of Aboyne passed to the Frasers

ABERDEENSHlttK., 



of Cowie, and from the Erasers to Lord Keith, progenitor of the 
Earl MarischaL Lord Keith's daughter, EHzabeth, was married 
to Sir John Gordon of Huntly, and with her the lands and castle 
of Aboyne passed to the Gordons, with whom they have since re- 
mained. Sir John was killed at the battle of Otterburn, 1388, 
and his only daughter and heiress was married in 1408, to Sir 
William Seaton of Seaton Mallonally, descended from a sister of 
Robert I. 

Their son Alexander was, in 1449, created Earl of Huntly, 
and resumed the surname of Gordon. This Earl Alexander was 
succeeded by his son George, in favour of whose second son Adam 
who afterwards became Earl of Sutherland, it is stated, in Gor- 
don's history of the clan, that James II. granted a novodamus of 
the lands of Aboyne. They seem, however, to have reverted to 
the Earl of Huntly, and to have been bestowed successively on 
the second sons of that noble house, first, on John, who was cruel- 
ly burned to death at Frendraught, on 30th April 1630, and se- 
condly, on James Viscount Aboyne, on whose death they passed 
to his next brother Charles, who was created Earl of Aboyne, and 
of whom is lineally descended the present Marquis of Huntly. 

In 1671 the castle was repaired or rather part of it rebuilt, by 
Charles first Eariof Aboyne, and in 1801, his great grandson, the 
present Marquis of Huntly, added the edst wing or half to it, cor- 
responding in appearance and architecture to the west, on which 
occasion, t°he old foundations, which had been laid on brandered oak 
above peat moss, were raised of what had once been the baronial 
hall. The old mansion-house of Balnacraig,  in which the for- 
mer proprietor resided, is in the parish, and on the Balnacraig pro- 
perty is also the House of Carlogie, now occupied by Admiral Sir 
Arthur Farqubar. At Tillphoudie, once the seat of a branch of 
the Gordons, but now forming part of the Aboyne property, are 
to be seen the ruins of the proprietor's house. 

Antiquities.— On Knockbeg, or little hill of Tillfoudie, are the 
remains of a circular building,t diameter 83 feet, composed of

stones regularly laid, and the foundation partly imbedded in rock, 
but without mortar or cement; and at the base of the hill, in a 
corn-fieldj about half a mile to the north-east, may be traced the 
site of another erection, said to have been similar; and connect- 
ing them are to be seen the remains of two parallel dikes, forming 
a fenced avenue or roadway. This avenue, thus secured on each 
side and in no place under the breadth of fifteen feet, though in 
many places more than double that extent, leads to the east over 
the adjoining moor of Drumduan, and can be traced for miles, in 
the direction of the hill of Fare, where, the writer has been told, 
it is connected with similarly raised structures, known by the name 
of Pict's houses or forts. The line extends also westward to the 
hill of Knockice, and Kinord, and is there too connected with a 
number of these Picts' houses, though none of them, like the 
one on Knockbeg, has been erected entirely of stone. From 
Knockice, the enclosed line branches off towards a ford in the Dee, 
and appears on the opposite side in Glentanner, with more of these 
ancient ruins planted, at intermediate spaces, along it. The same 
is observable at Tillphoudie hill distantfrom Knockice five miles, 
leading also towards a ford in the Dee, and not far from either 
bank are two of these raised forts, placed like lunettes to pro- 
tect the passage. Both the diverging lines seem to point to a pass 
through the Grampians, directly leading to Catterthun, the great 
Caledonian fort, about twenty miles distant, in the braes of Angus, 
and thought by some to have been a stronghold of Galgacus. 
The main line may be traced nearly parallel with the north bank 
of the Dee, for about fifty miles from hill of Fare by Knockice to 
Braemar, said to be the Tamea of the Romans, and these paral- 
lel dikes aline of them branching also northward from Knockice 
have been represented by some antiquaries as the remains of itinera 
of that people. The dikes, however, appear always in connection 
with these round forts or pits, which was the form adopted by the 
Picts and the ancient Scots for their places of strength. Those 
of the Romans were rectangular, and the stone one on Little hill 
to and from which the iter evidently led, had been erected with- 
out lime or mortar, which would not likely have been the case had 
it been of Roman origin. At Knockice, along the south face and 
base of Mulloch hill, are the ruins of three rectangular stone en- 

 Mulloeh, Gaelic, " the top or highest part of the inountain." On this Mullofl, 
or summit of the hill, there is a cairn 60 yards in circumference, and the avernffo 
depth of the stones 2 yards. There is a confused tradition that this cairn marks tho

closures, all close to and connected with each other. The west- 
most one, 140 yards by 88, the next larger, and the eastmost about 
double the size of the other two. All the three have been ap- 
parently open on the south side, except in so far as naturally se- 
cured by a small rill of water and marshy ground. There are two 
smaller enclosures, of from 12 to 18 yards diameter, a little out 
from the north-west corner of the smallest of the three, on steep 
risin.. ground, and overlooking the whole. The road or diked 
avenue from Kinord leads to the westmost of the three, and is lost 
in it. It again appears skirting the other two, except in one place 
where it is'' blocked up by the wall of the inclosure, to form which 
the stones of the two dikes appear in that place to have been re- 
moved. Hence if these be the remains of a Roman encampment 
for the troops of Domitian or Severus, as some have inferred, the 
encampment and the iter must have been formed at different times, 
und if by the Romans, it is not likely they would, in an enemy's 
country, have blocked up their iter without the formation of a new 
line. It may be noticed, that the enclosures had been mere fences 
of loose stone and turf, without any outside ditch, and present no- 
thing of the formidable appearance of a Roman rampart. Three 
;ides of the hill slope as regularly as if they had by art been 
formed into a glacis ; and contain several deep trenches, of no 
great length, like so many redoubts to check an advancing army ; 
and the whole ground is covered with cairns, many of them within 
the inclosures ; and the tradition of the country is strong, that more 
than one severe battle had been fought on this ground, but when, 
or by whom, an opinion cannot well be formed. One tradition is, 
and some authors have stated it as a fact, on what evidence is un- 
known to the writer, that the Romans did pass to Moray by Brae- 
mar and were signally routed at Knockice. Severus indeed, with 
his son Caracalla, did attempt, in the year 208, the entire conquest 
of Scotland ; but, after losing 50,000 men in one campaign, was 
glad to retire south of the Tyne, and the Romans never again 
evinced any desire to face the six Scottish knights.

hole in the centre, somewhat like that of a millstone, and suppos- 
ed to have been used for the erection of a gibbet -tree. It was, 
about twenty years ago, with the view of examining it, placed on 
its hem, and, on raising it from the flat bed on which it rested, 
there was some difficulty experienced, in consequence of large 
stones which had been laid around to firm it. That it was a gibbet- 
stone, may be the more readily inferred from its being placed at the 
foot of a natural tumulus, which bears the significant name of 
Tiremdd" i. e. " the court-ground." 

Six years ago, a canoe, neatly formed out of a single block of 
oak, was dug out of the peat-moss at Drumduan, on the south 
side of Auchlossan Loch. It was quite entire; but being in an 
unsound state, and left on the bank to dry, it was unfortunately 
broken by the rude handling of some herd boys. 

On a knoll near Aboyne Castle stands a sculptured stone, six 
and a-half feet high. This stone formerly stood on an eminence 
nearly fronting the land-end of the drawbridge which had commu- 
nicated with Ceanmore's fortified island in Loch Kinord, but, in 
commemoration of which of the many eventful occurrences con- 
nected with that locality, no evidence exists beyond its carved 
hieroglyphics; and as these contain what appears intended to re- 
present a cross, curiously and very laboriously cut, it may be inferred 
to have been erected within the Christian era. It was removed 
by the Earl of Aboyne from its original site to that which it now 
occupies near a small Druidical circle ; hence its history may, at 
some future period, puzzle the antiquary. 

About a mile and a-half north-west from the church, there is 
a stone with a cross cut on it, and standing near a well. This 
stone, when removed at some olden time, is said to have been 
miraculously brought back by Muchrieha, the guardian of the 
well. Near the cross formerly stood a stone of considerable size, 
with a hollow rudely cut in it, and called Muchrieha's chair. 
This chair some masons, about thirty years ago, unawed by Much- 
rieha, split into pieces to assist in the building of the neigh- 
bouring farm-house. 

On the hill of Little TuUich, overlooking the site of the old 
■Castle of Cean-na-coil, are the remains of what is called " My 
Lord's House," consisting of five courses of a square stone build- 
ing, the wall at the base course 12 feet thick, and diminishing 
about a foot each course, so that the five courses present, on the 
outside, the appearance of a stair of as many steps on each side 



1060 



ABERDEENSHIRE. 



The entry is from the west, and the apartment within is 7 feet 
each side. The base course also projects inwardly from 12 to 15 
inches, forming a seat or bench all around ; and in laying the 
courses no cement had been used. It may have been originally 
arched or roofed in, but it is now open, and the height of the 
apartment within from 5 to 6 feet. The use of this building is 
reported to have been for obtaining a view during a deer-hunt ; 
and this part of the ancient forest of Marr being the nearest to 
the old Castle of Kincardine about fifteen miles distant, which 
was frequently honoured with a royal visit, it is thought it was in 
this locality his Majesty, Alexander III., was saved from an infu- 
riated stag by Colin Fitzgerald, of whom were descended the 
Earls of Seaforth. The charter in favour of Fitzgerald for the 
lands of Kintail is dated " Apud Kincardine ix. die Jan. anno 
regni nostri xviii." or 1267 ; and the interesting occurrence which 
becomes associated with the date and locality of this charter, was, 
as recorded by Sir George Mackenzie of Tarbet, "about that 
time when Alexander was on a hunting excursion in the forest of 
Marr, an exasperated stag, hotly pursued by the hounds, made a 
dead push at the place occupied by the King, when Colin bravely 
interposed his own person, and adroitly shot, with an arrow, the 
infuriated assailant." 

Half- way between the castle and the old church is an old tree 
called the Skeulan tree, and a well called the Skeulan Well. 
They are still held in great veneration, and the name appears to 
be a corruption of St Eunan, to whom the parish and church of 
Aboyne were anciently dedicated. Within a short distance of 
the Skeulan tree, there is another well called the Lady's Well. 

At Newton of Tilliecairn, in 1828, several urns, containing cal- 
cined bones, were dug up while trenching some ground, one of 
them perfectly entire: and the gentleman into whose possession it 
has fallen has either lately presented it, or intends to present it, 
to the Museum of Marischal College. About fifty yards distant 
from the tumulus in which the urns were found, the soil has a 
blackish appearance, with small pieces of charcoal imbedded in 
it, the whole appearing to have been under the action of strong 
fire; and here, it is presumed, the bodies had been burned,- prepa- 
ratory to the calcined remains being placed in the urns. And it 
may be remarked, too, that the site is near some Picts' houses, or, 
as they are here called, Mulhchies, on the communication brancn

of the parallel dikes which diverge from Kiiockice on the opposite 
side of the Dee. 

Nearly a mile to the east of Newton, on the top of a ridge on 
which are several small cairns, is one of great extent called Cairn- 
more, which, in 1818, was partly opened for the purpose of ob- 
taining stones for the erection of a house, when a number of bones 
were found, and a small gold chain of four links, attached to a pin 
of such size as might have been used in a brooch for fastening the 
Celtic plaid. The bottom of the cairn was neatly paved, and about 
one-tenth part of it only has been explored. 

On the summit of the hill of Mortlich, in this parish, has been 
a pretty large enclosure, apparently an extensive encampment. 
Now this is the only Mortlich or Murtlach in Marr; and Bu- 
chanan writes Lib. vi. cap. xlix. that Malcolm II., after a hard- 
contested action ad Murthilacum in Marria, and taking advantage 
ofaprasidmm or old strength, fortified by a wall and ditch, gained 
a signal victory over the Danes. The Peel Bog, about two miles east 
from this Mortlich in Marr, most exactly corresponds with the de- 
scription given by Buchanan of the prcesidium or old strength. 
Some, however, think, that the enclosure on the top of Mortlich 
may have been used for a more ignoble purpose than that of an 
encampment of warriors, and that it was a fence, difficult of 
access and easily guarded, for securing the cattle of the country 
during the foray of any hostile clan or inroad of pillaging foes. 

In 1834, there was dug out of one of the cairns at Ferrar a sil- 
ver coin, hammer struck, bearing on the obverse, within a double 
tressure, or leaves of a rose, except the bust, which extends to 
the legend, the king's head in profile, with an open crown fleury, 
before him the sceptre fleury, with the legend, david dei gra 
REX scoTORVM. On the reverse, a cross potent extending to the 
edge, with a spur-revel of five points in each quarter. In the inner 
circle villa edinbvrgh, the place of coinage. In the outer, 
the legend, + dns-ptector-ms -j- libator ms, being he con- 
traction for Dominus 'Protector Mens et Liberator Mens. It 
bears no date, neither is the king's name designated by any num- 
bers. It may, therefore, be presumed to have been of the reicrn 
of David I., sixth son of Ceanmore, and who, in 1124, succeeded 
his brother Edgar; but those acquainted with the history of 

 Since the above was sent to press, the writer has seen a copy of " Numismata 
hcotiae, from which the coin would appear to have been of the reio-n of D-ivid II

Scotch coinage may be able to determine whether this piece be 
of the reign of David II., who, when only eight years of age, suc- 
ceeded his father, « the Bruce," in 1329. Of either reign, it 
would fall within the date 1335 of the battle of Culblean, fought 
about two miles to the westward ; and in the direction of Ferrar 
it is generally admitted the routed Baliolites fled, closely pursued 
by " the Gordon" and his gallant band. Some of the fugitives 
are reported to have rushed into the mill at Dinnet, and there 
except two saved by the address and bravery of the miller, cut 
down by their fierce pursuers. From this incident the name of 
the mill was changed from that of Dinnet, Dion-aite, f sheltering 
place, fo Muillean donas the mill of mischief. The sucken 
considered their mill polluted. A new one was erected about one 
hundred yards distant; but the old site is still called Muillean 
donas. Connected also with the chase from Culblean, a small 
rill, nearly a mile north of Aboyne Castle, is called " the bleedy 
burn," the tradition being, that, for twenty-four hours, the water 
was reddened with the blood of the slain. But " bleedy burn" 
being expressed in Scotch and not in Gaelic, it may be inferred, 
that°the occurrence from which arose the name must have been 
of more recent date than the battle of Culblean. If, too, the 
coin be of the reign of David II., and if the legend have refe- 
rence to the liberation of that monarch from England, 1358, 
the piece and bones found with it in the cairn must have been 
deposited on some memorable occasion subsequent to the rout, m 
1335, from Culblean. Cairns some of great size and tumuli 
are to be found on every hill and moor in the parish. Some of 
them may mark the graves of the Sassenach and the Dane; but 
many of them may be claimed by every Celt in the north as a 
« Cam na Cuimhne," a cairn of remembrance over a clansman of 
his own, who fell either in nobly repelling a foreign foe, or m the 
direful conflict of chief against chief. But it is not to be suppos- 
ed that all these tumuli and cairns owed their ongm to the casual- 
ties of war. Around the Druidical places of worship, there were 
no cemeteries. Such convenient spots as, amid their paste- 
ral and migratory life, might at the time occur to the surviving 
relatives, were selected, and the grave secured against the raven- 
ous wolf t bv a heap of stones. " Curri mi cloch er do charne, 1

Parochial Register. — The parochial register only extends back 
to 1752. It contains minutes of the kirk-session meetings, and a 
record of marriages and births, but not of deaths. The births 
have been very irregularly entered, from the neglect of some pa- 
rents, and the disinclination of others, to have their children's 
names recorded. 

III. — Population. 

In 1755, the population amounted to 1695 
1831, - - - 1163 

1841, - - - 1138 

This falling off may be accounted for from the increased size of 
the farms and a diminution of the cottar system. 

The people are orderly and industrious, shrewd and intelligent, 
weW informed in the principles of religion, and regular in their 
attendance upon its ordinances. A very intelligent and respect- 
able farmer of the name of Gillanders, who, since the in- 
cumbency of the writer, died in the parish, was the eighteenth 
oldest son of the family, who, in succession, had been born on 
the same farm. The adjoining farm is now rented by his oldest 
son ; and others in the parish are possessed of evidence that they, 
and those they represent, have lived under the Earls of Aboyne 
from the time that noble family succeeded to their honours, and 
were ever ready to follow their feudal chief to the field. In more 
recent times, though the Earl of Aboyne did not formally embark 
in the unfortunate risings of 1715 and 1745, yet did his tenants 
zealously support " the Prince" with their services. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — The arable land in the parish is 2178 Scotch 
acres; and the gross rental is L.3300, exclusive of shoot- 
ing-grounds, which would be at the rate of about L.l, 10s. 
per Scotch acre. If, however, the arable were let without the 
extensive moorlands and natural pastures attached, the average 
rent of the arable would perhaps range from L.l to L.l, 5s. 

 Jn 1715 the Earl of Mar, to mature his plans and collect his hounds, invited his 
sporting friends to a deer-hunt in Glentanner, and to meet him at Ccan-na-GoiL 
1 hence, with the men of Aboyne. he proceeded to Braemar Castle, and tliere un- 
-furled the banner of James VII. In I745-G, a battalion, named by Lord Lewis 
Gordon "the Aboyne battalion," and commanded by Farquharson of Monaltree, beat 
theMaeleods at Inverury; and, in the fierce onslaught at Culloden, cut through 
Uurrell s Blue." The survivors who returned from that eventful field are all now 
beyond the din of war. The writer remembers seven or eight of them, and has oftea 
neard trom them an account of their disastrous adventure.

per Scotch acre. The usual system of cropping followed in 
the parish, as generally throughout the district of Marr, is the 
seven years' shift ; and to observe this rotation most of the tenants 
are bound by their leases. A less exhausting course, however, is 
beginning to be introduced, viz. the six years' shift, which only 
differs from the former by taking one grain crop instead of two 
after lea. The only grain crops to which the climate is found 
congenial, are oats and big. The surplus grain is carried to mar- 
ket at Aberdeen, and the carts return loaded with lime, coals, or 
bone-dust. There are only three farms in the parish exceeding 
100 acres arable. Most of them are only from 20 to 50 acres, 
and many of them mere crofts, extending from 5 to 12 or 15 
acres ; and the smaller the farm, generally the higher the rent, 
arising chiefly from a competition among steady farm-servants, 
who have saved from their wages as much as is sufficient to stock 
one of these small holdings. The usual duration of the leases 
granted is nineteen years. There is improvable ground in the 
parish, perhaps equal in extent, and not inferior in natural quality, 
to what is already arable, but which, on a nineteen years' lease, 
would scarcely repay the expense of bringing it into tillage. In 
cutting down the crops, the sickle has of late been superseded by 
the scythe. 

Farm-Buildincjs.—r£\ie farm-houses with lum and earthen-floor 
have entirely disappeared, and in their stead plain and comfortable 
erections have been built with chimneys, and one end at least 
floored with wood ; and those erected within the last few years 
are slated, and generally of two stories. An improving style of 
offices has also begun to be introduced. This better system 
has chiefly arisen from the houses becoming more generally the 
direct property of the land-owners, in place of being built or paid 
for by incoming tenants. Some of the farms, too, have of late 
been well enclosed with stone fences at the expense of the pro- 
prietors. „ , 

Under this head, it may be also mentioned, that traces ot the 
plough are visible far up the brows of the hills, and at greater 
elevSions than it is thought any grain would now ripen. These 
alpine rigs are all straight, arising, it is presumed, from the plough 

 The plou-'l. with a single handle is said to have been then used. The writer 
has seen such a plough at work in the higher district Cf'lhne , and wa 
struck with its reseinblance to the old Roman plough as doscr.bed Vjrg.l, Geor 
6icahb. i, 162. Ovid, too, alludes to the single-handed plough, " stiva notstnis; 

' innixus arator."

liaviig been drawn by the amliii'mor great yoke, to which the 
cattle were attached abreast. In connection with these rigs, the 
more hmited operations of the spade or eas-chrom appear in small 
cleared patches, from which the grubbed up stones have been 
collected into heaps. From the mountain's brow, cultivation would 
appear to have gradually descended to the richer and stiffer soils 
of the glen, as it became cleared of wood and water, and there 
the straight rig of the amlin-mor appears to have been succeeded 
by the curvilinear of the ten-oxen-plough. 

Live-Stock. — Much attention is bestowed on the rearing of 
black-cattle. These are generally of the Aberdeenshire horn- 
ed, or of the Buchan polled breeds ; but they have of late, on 
several farms, been crossed with the short-horned, much to 
the improvement of the weight, and a year's earlier maturity of 
the animals for the market. A few are fed either for the Aber- 
deen fleshers, or for exportation by the steamers for the London 
market ; but a greater number are disposed of in a lean state to 
the south of Scotland and English dealers. From any of these 
quarters, however, there has been little demand, and at greatly 
reduced prices, since the ports were opened for the admission of 
foreign cattle. On the hills and moorlands, from 5000 to 6000 
sheep, mostly of the Linton breed, are pastured ; and a few pigs 
are also to be seen about most of the farm-steadings. The ave- 
rage amount yearly sold of these different kinds of stock has been 
calculated at rather more than half the rent paid to the land- 
owners. The horses are not heavy, but hardy ; and, from the 
lightness of the soil, a pair of them is sufficient for drawing a 
plough, and one of them for carrying in a cart four quarters of 
bear to the Aberdeen market. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Towns. — The united parish is distant from Aberdeen, 
the principal market-town, from twenty-four to thirty-seven miles. 
Stonehaven is two miles nearer, but with it, though there be turn- 
pike roads leading to both towns, the intercourse is very limited. 
In the village of Charlestown, within the parish, and a quarter of 
a mile east of the church, there is a very commodious inn, noted 
for the excellent manner in which it is kept : Also a post-office; 
bake and brew-house; shop for general goods ; meal, flour, barley, 
and malt-mills; shoemakers, carpenters, tailors, and a saddler. 
Through the village, a mail-coach to and from Aberdeen passes 
daily, and several carriers weekly.

ABERDEENSnittE, 



Means of Cornniunication. — The turnpike road from Aberdeen, 
which is joined by the one from Stonehaven at Banchory Ter- 
nan, terminates at Aboync ; but the communication is continued 
by excellent commutation roads, on both sides of the Dee, to 
Ballater and Braemar. The Parliamentary road to Alford com- 
mences in the parish ; and there are also, leading from Aboyne, 
good commutation roads in the direction of Tarland, of the 
Cairnamonth and to Inchmarnoch, by either side of Bellrory. 
Over the Tanner, there are two stone-bridges, and five over other 
tributary streams of the Dee, all arched, besides several other 
smaller bridges, either of wood or of stone, but not arched. At 
the place where the ferry-boat now passes the Dee, between Kin- 
cardine O'Neil and the lands of Balnacraig, in the parish of 
Aboyne, a wooden bridge was erected, by Durward of CouU, in 
the fourteenth century, but of which all traces have long since 
disappeared. Two miles further east, on the verge of the parish, 
there is now the elegant stone-bridge of Potarch, of three arches, 
and each pier founded on rock. At Aboyne, and nearly opposite 
the church, the much admired chain or suspension-bridge, was 
erected by the Earl of Aboyne in 1831, and solely at his 
Lordship's expense. A previous one, on the same site, and 
nearly on the same design, had been constructed in 1828, but 
which was unfortunately carried away by the great flood of 4th 
August 1829. The two bridges cost his Lordship from L.6000 
to L. 7000, and there is no pontage. The stability of this 
bridge being now tested, and there being an excellent road, either 
turnpike or Parliamentary, from Huntly to Aboyne, a continu- 
ation of the line southward, through the Grampians, is natu- 
rally indicated, and a very inviting line as to levels and facility of 
formation has been surveyed, from Aboyne, through the top of fo- 
rest of Birse, lower part of Glenesk, Clash of Wurren, and parish 
of Menmuir, to join the great Strathmore road at a point near 
the bridge of Finhaven, distant about twenty-five miles from 
Aboyne. Were this projected road formed, and the estimated 
expense is less than what the bridge at Aboyne cost, the saving 
which would be gained in travelling from many of the northern 
counties is not only obvious, but property along its tract would be 
greatly enhanced, and a spur given, in a neglected district, to

that spirit of improvement which is generally carried on along a 
new line of road, by which easy access is afforded. 

Ecclesiastical State. — Tlie church is very handsome and com- 
fortable, and seated for 628. It was erected this year at an ex- 
pense, exclusive of carriages, of about L.900. The manse was 
built in 1790, and two new rooms added in 1835. The stipend 
is L.150, of which the sum of L.12, 16s. di. is paid by the Ex- 
chequer. The glebe extends to nearly twenty imperial acres, but 
of such worthless soil, that it has never repaid the expense of la- 
bouring it. The old glebes of Aboyne and Glentanner, of ex- 
cellent soil, were, on the occasion of a central church being built 
for the united parish in 176.3, excambed for double extent of a 
bleak moor, which had evidently at one period been the bed of 
the Dee, and which had scarcely any soil on it. It is only fit for 
growing furze and broom, or stunted firs. The minister has the 
privilege of a peat-moss, four miles distant, on the top of a very 
steep hill. 

Education. — The salary of the parochial schoolmaster is L. 28, 
which, with allowance from the Dick bequest and school fees, may 
raise his income to L. 80 per annum, with house and garden. The 
usual branches of education are taught, and the- number of scho- 
lars last winter was as high as 140. From the school there 
is at present one student at Marischal College and another at 
King's, both holding competition bursaries. In the Glentan- 
ner division of the parish, there is a school established by the 
Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge, with a salary of 
L. 16, and the usual accommodations from the heritors. The ave- 
rage number of scholars, 60 : but their fees do not amount to much. 
From remote corners of the parish, several children attend neigh- 
bouring parochial schools, to which they are nearer than to that 
of Aboyne ; and in winter, some are instructed in adventure schools. 
The minister, parochial and society schoolmasters, are natives of 
the parish. 

Foor and Parochial Funds — The number of persons on the 
poor's roll has nearly doubled within the last few years. They at 
present amount to 34, Among them, in proportion to their re- 
spective wants, are divided, by quarterly distributions, about L.35 
per annum, arising from church collections, amounting on an ave- 
rage to L.23; interest of money, L.3; and the balance from volun- 
tary contributions by some of the heritors and others. There are 
no beggars in the parish ; and the paupers on the roll derive much

of their support from the kindness and beneficence of their more 
affluent neighbours. Whenever any urgent case occurs, a contri- 
bution in meal and money is immediately made in the vicinity for 
its relief. 

Pairs. — There are five great markets held on a green admir- 
ably adapted for the purpose, between the village of Charlestown 
and the church, viz. at Candlemas, Michaelmas, and Hallowmas ; 
one also in June, and another in July. 

jnns. — There is an excellent inn, the Huntly Arms, at Aboyne, 
and four secondary ones in the parish. 

Puel Bog peat and hill turf are used for fuel. There is also 

much wood, particularly fir, burned; and many drive coal from 
Aberdeen. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Fiftv years ago, the fields were regularly checkered by baulk and 
ricr. Drill husbandry and green crops not to be seen, save in a few 
rare patches of grass or turnip in some of the farmers' kailyards, and 
perhaps a head- rig or some odd corner in potato for a bonne bouche 
in harvest. The breed of cattle light, and of an inferior stamp ; the 
horses though mettlesome mere highland garrons; the sheep 
small in carcass, and scanty in wool. The houses of simple struc- 
ture : lums for chimneys, and wooden boards for windows. Currocks, 
and creels, and litter trees supplied the place of carts ; winnowing 
weights that of fanners ; and hair and moss-fir tethers, or willow 
and birch withes, were substitutes for hempen ropes. The querne 
was partially used ; and though the laddie mill had disappeared, it 
had been only superseded by the cog and rung. Clumsy and dl- 
constructed ploughs were drawn by ten or twelve oxen, with the 

citrv'us arator" slowly turning the huge furrow, and the gad- 
man's whistle, in autumn and spring, heard on every side. The 
roads were wretched ; and the nearest post-office and bake-house 
at Aberdeen. Many of the young men appeared in kilt, hose, and 
brogues ; and all, old and young, at church and market, with 
bi-eacan and bonnet. The women, too, were dressed mostly m 
home-made stuff's, and gudewives adorned with the barred plaid. 
The grain raised was little more than sufficient for the wants of 
the parish. From seed-time to harvest many of the men were 
employed in the manufacture of tubs, harrows, plough-beams, &amp;c. 
which they carried to Old Rayne fair, the Aberdeen timber and 
Auldton markets. In summer, the women were employed in spin- 
ning the wool of their sheep; and many a web was ready for the

gudewives to start with for Bartle fair of Kincardine. A new order 
of things has now gradually sprung up, and the dress and habits of 
the people are similar to those in other rural parishes in the county. 

It may be also observed, that, fifty years ago, many a legendary 
tale, blended with some historical facts respecting the parish, was 
told ; it is said that, at some very remote period, an irruption had 
been made through the Grampians by an overwhelming host of in- 
vaders ; that these were assailed by the natives from the woods, rocks, 
and hills, and finally routed at Knockice ; that a line of tumuli and 
cairns marks the graves of fallen Danes and northern marauders ; 
that Macbeth fled from Dunsinane, and maintained himself for 
three years among the fastnesses of Marr ; and that, in one of his 
flights for life, and unattended, through Aboyne — himself exhausted 
and his mare jaded — he dismounted to drink, from a well situated 
at the pointf from which he could first see his castle of Peel Boo-, 
distant about two miles, and, obtaining a bit of bread from a herd 
boy, asked him the name of the well, and, being told that it was 
Brien Braon, he ejaculated, " wo is me, the spell is gone, and 
my doom is sealed." It is said also, that feuds and conflicts often 
raged between the Forbeses and the Gordons, the Gordons and 
Farquharsons; and that, after one memorable foray, orphan chil- 
dren were carried towards the banks of the Spey; and that some 
of their descendants are still to be found there bearing the 
name of " Strathdee." It is said that the vassals of Aboyne suf- 
fered in Marr's year, the 45, and in the wars of Montrose and 
Dundee; and that Mackay, after « KiUiecrankie," visited Strath- 
dee with fire and sword ; and, in forcing the pass of Ballater, 
that, with hand granades, he fired the heath and burned the 
forest of Culblean, encamped at Tarland, and, with other pa- 
rishes, laid Aboyne under contribution. Hence the couplet. 

Wo to the day John Tam was married, 
Culblean was burn'd, and Cromar was harried. 

Instead of listening much to such traditionary tales and imper- 
fectly recorded facts, the people now take an interest in reading 
standard works on history and general science, and have provided 
themselves with a pretty extensive parochial library.

PRESBYTERY OF KINCARBINE o'nEIL, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. JOHN M'HARDY, MINISTER. 



I. Topography and Natural History. 

The parish of Logie-Coldstone is principally situated in Cro- 
mar, a district of Aberdeenshire comprehending part of five pa- 
rishes, and forming an extensive amphitheatre amid that range of 
mountains and hills which runs between the rivers Dee and Don 
for a considerable part of their course. 

At some remote period, a great portion of this district seems 
evidently to have been the site of a large lake or chain of lakes 
two of which still subsist, fed by several rivulets, which now wend 
their way sluggishly through it, occasionally inundating the lower 
grounds to some extent, when swollen by much rain, or by the 
sudden dissolution of ihe snow, which falls abundantly on the sur- 
rounding hills during the winter. Since this evanished lake burst 
the barrier which confined it on the south, several tumuli or mounds 
have been formed in different places of its site, by the drifting of 
the finer particles of sand which covered its bottom, while the flat 
ground around them consists generally of coarser gravelly deposits, 
interspersed with patches of peat-bog. 

iVome, 4c.— The parish of Logie was annexed to Coldston 
anno 1618. When a separate parish, it appears to have been g" 
nerally called Logie- Mar, to distinguish it from the other pa 
rishes into which the word Log enters as a compound, such as Lo- 
gie-Buchan, Logie-Pert. The etymology of Coldstone formerl 
written, and still pronounced, Colstane by the inhabitants of th 
district, cannot be determined with any degree of certamty. 

Extent, 4-c.— From east to west, the parish of Logie- Coldston 
extends, in some places, to upwards of 5 miles, in others, to no 
more than half that distance. From north to south, that portio 
of it situated within the district of Cromar does not extend to mor 
than 4 miles; but, including the portion which lies w.thout the 
district on Deskry-side, the extreme length is not less than 7 miles. 



LOGIB-COLDSTONE. 



1071 



The figure of the parish is extremely irregular. It is bounded 
■ on the south, by the parishes of Glenmuick and Aboyne; on the 
west, by Glenmuick ; on the north, by Strathdon, Tarland, and 
Towie ; and on the east, by Tarland, CouU, and Aboyne. 

Topographical'Appearances. — On the west side of the parish a 
range of steep and high hills runs the whole distance, among which 
Morven stands conspicuous, commanding a view to the east as far 
as the eye can reach. On the north, the hills rise more gradu- 
ally, and are less elevated. 

Climate. — The climate of this parish, with the exception of that 
part which lies on Deskry-side, is tolerably mild, equable, and sa- 
lubrious, and must become still more so from the extent of drain- 
age which is taking place, and from the additional shelter which 
will be afforded by the plantations made and making. 

Hydrographij.—Theve are ruimerous springs in the parish, but 
the only one which has attracted the particular notice of the 
inhabitants, is a powerful chalybeate, vt'hich arises in a planta- 
tion a little south from the church, and seems to have acquired its 
Gaelic name of Poll-dubh, " black mire," from pouring its water 
into a small mossy hollow within a few yards of its source. It is 
occasionally resorted to by some for the benefit of their health, 
and by others for amusement. 

One of the lochs alluded to as still subsisting in the district is 
partly in this parish. It is called Lochdawan, supposed to be a 
corruption of the Gaelic Loch cVabhainn, « lake of two waters," 
and is about two and a half or three miles in circumference. 

There is a small circular pond upon an elevated part of the farm 
of Nether Ruthven, which bears the name of Lochan-uaine, « the 
green pool or lakelet," from the peculiar colour of the water. The 
water of this pond has never been analyzed with a view to disco- 
ver its colouring ingredients or particular qualities. Thoudi 
seemmgly of a very impure nature, the cattle upon the farm a"re 
said to prefer it to any other. 

The only stream of running water of any magnitude connected 
ith the parish is that of Deskry, which forms a boundary line for 
same distance betwixt it and Strathdon. The other rivulets in 
the parish, in common with those of the whole district of Cromar 
discharge their water into the river Dee in the parish of Aboyne' 
Wc;y._The granite formation prevails generally throuo-hout 
the parish; but the direction and dip of the strata and bed's has 
not been particularly attended to. No mines or ores of any de

scription are known to exist. On the slope of the high grounds, 
where the soil is untransported, it is generally of a good depth and 
fertile quality. On the low grounds, where it is transported, it is 
mostly shallow, and of a sandy or peaty nature. 

Wood.— 'With the exception of a few patches of dwarfish alder, 
no indigenous wood exists in the parish ; but roots and fragments 
of oak, fir, hazel, &amp;c. of a large size are frequently dug up in the 
mossy ground. From 800 to 900 acres have, at different times, 
been planted by the different heritors, principally with fir and larch, 
to which sorts of timber the soil appears most congenial, or at least 
that part of the soil which has been set apart for plantation. 

II. — Civil History. 

In a volume recently published by the Spalding Club, there 
appear a few letters written by one of the heritors of the parish of 
Looie, Gordon of Blelack, who espoused the cause of the Stu- 
art°family in the Rebellion of 1745; and also an account of the 
trial of some inhabitants of the parish accused of the crime of 
witchcraft. 

Antiquities.— Two different farms in the parish have received 
the natne of Cairnmore, from the existence of large cairns or piles 
of stone within their boundaries. One of these cairns, situated 
about half a mile north of the manse of Coldstone, must have ori- 
ginally been of remarkable size ; for though it has, according to 
the report of the inhabitants, furnished materials for the erection 
of several enclosures in the neighbourhood, it still stands conspi- 
cuous. As the remains of several smaller cairns appear on a piece 
of moor ground, a little west from the large one, there is reason 
to think, that a fierce battle, of which, however, there is no tradi- 
tion, must have been fought upon the spot. 

Upon the farm of Parks of Coldstone, and on a spot of ground 
which, though now drained and improved, has evidently been a 
morass, there is still to be seen a deep and wide moat, surround- 
ing a slightly elevated area of about an acre. 

In the gable-wall of a house, which forms part of the farm-of- 
fices at Mill of Newton, may be seen a sculptured stone, which 
formerly stood on a rising ground a little to the west which st.l 
bears the name of Tomachar Gaelic Tom-chathazr, " hillock o 
the chair." Drawings of the stone are said to have been taken 
and forwarded to antiquaries ; but no satisfactory explanation of 
the figures delineated upon it has been given 

During the last season, the tenant of Cairnmore of Blelack,

while ploughing a field which has been long arable, found the 
plough striking against a stone, which he resolved to remove, and 
on proceeding to do so, discovered that it formed part of a paved 
road of considerable width, the extent of which has not yet been 
ascertained. Near to the spot where it was laid bare, there is a 
hollow, which is known by the name of the Picts' Howe, with 
which it is supposed to be somehow connected. In removing part 
of the stones forming the pavement, numerous pieces of charred 
wood were found lying beneath them. 

There are no resident heritors in the parish, and the only man- 
sion-house is that of Blelack, which is at present unoccupied. 
Parochial Registers. — Registers of baptisms and of church dis- 
. cipline have been kept since 1748.

IV. — Industry. 
In few districts of Scotland, perhaps, has agriculture made 
greater progress than it has done in this parish, since the former 
Statistical Account of the country was published. At that pe- 
riod, we are told, that few turnips were sown, and clover and rye- 
grass cultivated only on three farms. The other lands in the pa- 
rish, though capable of improvement, are said to have been " in a 
state of nature." The farms at that time, so distinguished for en- 
closing, straighting, and dressing, can no longer boast of superiority 
of appearance or pecuharity of produce, for skilful and successful 
competitors have gradually sprung up around them, and stripped 
them of their honours.

L— Topography and Natural History. 
The parish of Old Machar was originally a deanery, called the 
Deanery of St Machar, and comprehended the parishes of Old 
Machar, New Machar, and Newhills. In times of Popery, they 
do not seem to have been divided into separate parishes, but to 
have been chapels in the deanery, at which chapels divine worship 
was regularly performed, as the inhabitants of so extensive and po- 
pulous a district could not conveniently meet m one place for pub- 
lic worship. New Machar seems to have been erected into a se- 



OLD MACHAR. 



1075 



parate parish about the time of the Reformation ; and Newhills 
about the year 1663. 

The extent of this parish is great, and its form irregular. 
Its south-east corner forms the north and west boundaries of the 
city of Aberdeen, or parish of St Nicholas. It extends about 
three miles up the Dee, by which river it is bounded on the south, 
and divided from the parish of Nigg, and county of Kincardine. 
The western boundary stretches in a crooked line from the Dee 
to the Don, at the distance of about two miles and a-half from the 
parish church. By this line it is divided from the parishes of 
Nether Banchory and Newhills. Crossing the Don, it extends a 
mile and a-half farther up the river, making in all four miles from 
the river's mouth. On this part the Don divides it from the pa- 
rishes of Newhills and Dyce ; its northern boundary passes by the 
parishes of New Machar and Belhelvie, till it joins the sea at the 
Black Dog, forming a sweep, every part of which is distant from 
the parish church at least four miles. On the east, it is bounded 
by the sea, from the Black Dog to Aberdeen, the extent of coast 
being about five miles. Its greatest length, from north to south, 
may be seven or eight miles, and its greatest breadth about four 
miles. 

This parish rises in a gentle slope from the sea, and though 
there is no eminence in it that deserves the name of a mountain, 
its surface is beautifully diversified by rising grounds. The wind- 
ings of the Dee and the Don, the manufactories, and the woods 
on the banks of the latter, some detached clumps of planting on 
the rising grounds, interspersed with a number of gentlemen's seats 
and villas, — together with the various prospects of the sea, the 
rivers, the cities of Old and New Aberdeen, and the villages of 
Gilcomston and Woodside, — give a pleasant variety to the general 
appearance of this parish. 

The soil is in some places naturally fertile ; in others bar- 
ren.

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — Extensive improvements have, of late years, been 
effected in the way of reclaiming waste lands on the property of 
the late Colonel Gordon of Parkhill, by Messrs Nicol, Reid 
Leuchlands, Craighead Mindurno, Simpson Cranbay, and 
others. One of these active farmers, Mr Nicol, received a pre- 
mium, a few years ago, for his improvements from the Highland 
Society. Much credit is also due to the late Colonel Gordon, 
the proprietor. 

The real rental of the parish is not known; but the valuation, 
at allocating the schoolmaster's salary per decreet of the Commis- 
sioners of Supply, 2d February 1758, was L.10,882, Us. 4d. 
Scots. Where no valuation cess-books was attainable, the Com- 
missioners affirmed the valuation at one-fifth of the then real rent. 

Fishings. — Salmon-fishing is carried on in the Don, but princi- 
pally by stake- nets in the sea. 

Manufactures. — Cotton-spinning is carried on at Grandholm 
Haugh by Leys, Masson, and Co. ; thread-spinning and weaving 
at Gordons Mills, by Milne, Cruden, and Co. ; and at Printfield, 
by Gordon, Barron, and Co. ; and bleaching at all of these places 
for their own goods ; flax-spinning, weaving, and bleaching, at 
Broadford and Rubislaw, by Richards and Co. All of these ma- 
nufactures are carried on to a considerable extent. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Ecclesiastical State. — The parish contains the four quoad sacra

The present parish church formed part of the Cathedral of St 
Machar, which was founded in 1357, and finished in 1522. It 
was last altered in 1832-3. Besides the parish church, there is 
a chapel in King's College, which is open, during the session, tor 
the accommodation of the professors and students. 

Gilcomston, formerly a chapel of ease to Old Machar was 
erected into a quoad sacra parish by the General Assembly in 
1834. There are within its bounds an Episcopal congregation, 
and another of the Original Seceders. 

Bon- Accord also was a chapel of ease to Old Machar from the 
year 1828 to 1834. In this district, there is a Baptist congrega- 
tion. , 

Woodside was also a chapel of ease to Old Machar. There is 
a congregation of Independents within its bounds. 

The glebe attached to the second charge of the quoad civilia 
parish is between six and seven acres in extent. Present rent, 
L.31, 10s. The manse was built in the end of last century, and 

is in good repair. 

Education.— There are two schools north of the Don, and a 
great many on the other side of the river. The salary of the pa- 
rochial schoolmaster is nominally L.30, but several moieties are an- 
nually lost; — the original heritors assessed in 1758, and their 
successors, being unknown. Fees from L.30 to L.35; allowance 
from the Dick Bequest, about L.30. 

Savings' Bank.— There is one in the parish, but the business 

done is very trifling. 

Poor.— Average number of paupers, 157, receiving an average 
payment per quarter, of 7s. lld. each ; 435, average payment per 
month, 4s. Sd. each ; 50 orphans and deserted children, 7s. 9d. 
per month ; 277 temporary supplies, 4s. 9d. each supply ; 17 lu- 
natics in asylum, L.15 each; 11 do. not in asylum, L.5, 3s. 8d; 
63 children at school, 2s. 5d. per quarter each ; 63 funerals ot 
paupers, 10s. 6d. each ; clothing and shoes for paupers, L.91,

the parish in which they reside, at a cost of L.30, 2s. lid. Ex- 
pense of poor's house, Gilcomston, containing 20 very aged 
or disabled paupers who have no relatives to care for them, 
L 140, Os. 5id. ; medical attendance and medicines for poor in 
the north division of the parish, L.14, 8s. 8d. The income ap- 
plicable to defray these expenses was, in the year ending 31st 
July 1842, L.170, 7s. 26., arising from church collections, alter

PRESBYTERY OF KINCARDINE o'nEIL, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. CHARLES M'COMBIE, MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The etymology of Lumphanan, which is spelled in the 
most ancient writings, Lunfanan, Lonfanan, and Lanfanan, can- 
not be ascertained with certainty. We may conjecture that it 
comes from three Celtic words, Llan or Lan, a church — Pan, a 
descent — and An, water, — a derivation which might naturally sug- 
gest itself to those who observed that the principal stream in the 
parish passes near the church, in its descent from the mountains to 
the Loch of Auchlossan. 

Situation, Extent, and Boundaries. — The parish is situate be- 
tween the Dee and the Don, in the district of Mar, twenty-four 
miles from Aberdeen. 

The length of the parish from north to south is 6 miles ; the 
breadth from east to west, 4 miles. 

It is bounded on the north by the parishes of Tough, Leochel, 
and CouU ; on the south by Kincardine o'Neil and Aboyne; on the 
east by Kincardine o'Neil ; and on the west by CouU and Aboyne. 

Geology — The rocks of the parish are of the primitive order, 
formed chiefly of porphyritic granite and granite. 

Zoology. — Besides the domesticated races, the following animals 
reside during the whole, or a part of the year, in the parish, or 
Occasionally visit it.

II. — Civil History. 
Ecclesiastical Histonj. — Alan de Lundin, named, from his of- 
fice in the King's court, the Doorward or Durward, erected, in 
1233, an hospital at Kincardine O'Neil, dedicated to God and 
the Blessed Mary. He conferred on it the patronage of the 
church of Kincardine O'Neil, the patronage of the church of Lon- 
fanan, and its chapel of Forthery probably Fordie, with certain 
pieces of land, the names of which are given, and the marches ac- 
curately described, in the chartulary of Aberdeen. In 1330 
the hospital and church of Kincardine O'Neil were incorporated 
with the cathedral establishment of Aberdeen ; the rector was 
raised to the dignity of a prebend ; after that period, he had a 
manse assigned him within the chanonry, while a perpetual vicar re- 
sided at Kincardine, and discharged the duties of the benefice. Dun- 
can, Earl of Fife, the inheritor of the possessions of the Durwards, 
bestowed on the Bishop of Aberdeen the patronage of the church 
of Kincardine O'Neil, and the chapels annexed to it, reverently 
depositing, to increase the solemnity of the transaction, with his 
own hands, on 7th March 1 338, the charter of donation on the 
altar of the Blessed Mary in the cathedral church of the city, f 
The first Protestant minister was George Levingstoun, who had 
under his charge the parishes of Kyncardin, Lanfannane, Midmar, 
and Clwyne. To enable him to perform the labours of this ex- 
tensive cure, a reader was appointed at Lumphanan, whose name 
was John Mychell.+ In 1595, William Strathaucin of Cluny 
was infeft in the patronages of Kincardine O'Neil, Glentanner, 
Lumphanan, Cluny, and Midmar, annexed thereto. In 1599, his 
possession of these patronages was ratified by the parson of Kin- 
cardine. In 1617, he disponed them to Mr William Forbes of 
Craigevar, who obtained, in the same year, a ratification from Bi- 
shop Patrick Forbes, and twenty of the chapter of Aberdeen. His 
son, Sir William Forbes of Craigevar, obtained another ratifica- 
tion, in 1637, from Adam Bellenden, Bishop of Aberdeen; and 
his lineal representative. Sir John Forbes, Bart, is now the pa- 
tron of three of these churches, — Kincardine O'Neil, Lumpha- 
nan, and Midmar.§

Historical Notices. — Macbeth was killed and buried in Lum- 
phanan. It is necessary to record the evidence of this fact, fur- 
nished by history and tradition,]'as Shakspeare has represented 
Dunsinane in Perthshire as the scene of his slaughter. 

" Macbeth, the son of Finleg, reigned seventeen years ; he was 
slain at Lunfanan by Malcolm, the son of Duncan ;"— is the brief 
notice of the event in the register of St Andrews. 

" Macbeth seeing his own forces," says Fordun, " daily dimi- 
nishing, and those of his adversary increasing, suddenly left the 
southern parts of the kingdom, and fled to the north, in whose 
narrow passes, and in the depths of whose forests, he hoped to find 
safety. Malcolm, however, quickly followed him across the moun- 
tains to Lunfanan, where he slew him, in a skirmish, with his 
few followers, on the 5th December 1056."-|- 

A similar testimony is borne by Wyntown : — 

" He wes ryoht wa, and tuk the flycht : 

And owre the Mownth thai chast hym than 

Til the Wode of Lunfanan. 

This MakduflFwes thare mast felle, 

And on that chas than mast crwele. 

Bot a Knycht, that in that chas 

Til this Makbeth than nerest was, 

Makbeth turnyd him agayne, 

And sayd, ' Lurdane, thow prykys in wayne. 

For thow may noucht be he, I trowe, 

That to dede sail sla me nowe. 

That man is nowcht borne of Wyf 

Of powere to rewe me my lyfe.' 

" The Knycht said, ' I wes nevyr borne; 
But of my Modyv Wame wes schorne. 
Now sail thi Tresowne here tak end.' 

«' Thus Makbeth slwe thai than

LUMPHANAN.

The evidence furnished by the ancient chroniclers has been re- 
garded as sufficient by modern historians and antiquaries. 

" Malcolm," says Bishop Leslie, " having received from King 
Edward ten thousand English soldiers, returned to Scotland, and 
hotly pursued Macbeth to Dounsinnan, and from thence to Lun- 
fanan. There Macduff, the Thane of Fife, whose wife and chil- 
dren he had lately ordered to be slain, killed him, and, present- 
ing his head as a gift to Malcolm, received the highest rewards." 

" Macbeth," says Dalrymple, " retreated to the fastnesses of 
the north, and protracted the war. His people forsook his stan- 
dard. Malcolm attacked him at Lunfanan, in Aberdeenshire : 
abandoned by his few remaining followers, Macbeth fell 5th De- 
cember 1056." f 

" The Northumbrians," says Chalmers, " led by Siward and 
his son, Osbert, penetrated probably to Dunsinan. In this vici- 
nity were they confronted by Macbeth, when a furious conflict 
ensued. The numbers of the slain evince the length of the battle, 
and the bravery of the combatants. Osbert was slain ; yet Mac- 
beth, after all the efforts of valour and vigour of conduct, was 
overcome. He retired into the north, where he had numerous 
friends, and where he might find many fastnesses. Siward re- 
turned into Northumberland, and died at York in 1055. Mean- 
time, Macbeth continued his bloody contest with Malcolm ; and 
th is uncommon character was at length slain at Lumphanan, on 
the 5th December 1056, by the injured hand of MacduflF."f 

" Macbeth," says Sir Walter Scott, " engaged the foe in the 
neighbourhood of his celebrated Castle of Dunsinane. He was 
defeated, but escaped from the castle, and was slain at Lumphan- 
an in 1056."  

A tradition prevails over a wide district of country, and has 
been unhesitatingly received for ages, that the murderer, or the 
victor of " the gracious Duncan," was slain in Lumphanan, and 
that the heap of stones, which to this day is called Macbeth's 
Cairn, is the place of his sepulture. 

If, then, the evidence of the fact furnished by history and tra- 
dition is so strong, why, it may be asked, does Shakspeare, in a 
drama which has been pronounced, by Augustus William Schlegel, ||

to be grander than any other work that has been produced by 
man since the time of JEschylus, represent Macbeth as killed in 
front of the gates of the Castle of Dunsinane  A glance at the 
Scottish Chronicle of HoUinshead, from whom our immortal poet 
received his information, will enable us to reply to the question. 

" Malcolme following hastilie," says this chronicler, " after 
Macbeth, came the night before the battell unto Birnane wood, 
and when his armie had rested a while there to refresh them, he 
commanded everie man to get a bow of some tree or other of that 
wood in his hand as big as he might bear, and to march forth 
therewith in such wise, that on the next morrow they might come 
closely and without sight in this manner, within view of his ene- 
mies. On the morrow, when Macbeth beheld them coming in 
this sort, he first marvelled what the matter meant ; but in the 
end remembered himself, that the prophesie which he had heard 
long before that time, of the coming of Birnane wood to Dun- 
sinane Castell, was likelie to be now fultilled. Nevertheless, he 
brought his men in order of battell, and exhorted them to do va- 
liantlie. Howbeit, his enemies had scarcely cast from them their 
boughs, when Macbeth, perceiving their numbers, betooke him 
streight to flight, whom Macduff pursued with great hatred, even 
till he came to Lunfannaine, where Macbeth, perceiving that 
Macduff was hard at his back, leapt beside his horse, saying, 
' Thou traitor, what meaneth it that thou shouldst thus in vain 
follow me, that am not appointed to be slaine by anie creature 
that is born of a woman ; come on, therefore, and receive thy re- 
ward, which thou hast deserved for thy pains and therewithal 
he lifted up his sword, thinking to have slain him. But Macduff, 
quicklie avoiding from his horse, yer he came at him, answered, 
with his naked sword in his hand saying, ' It is true, Macbeth, 
and now shall thine insatiable crueltie have an end ; for I am 
'even he that thy wizzards have told thee of, who was never born 
of my mother, but ripped out of her womb;' therewithall he 
stepped unto him, and slew him in the place. Then, cutting his 
head from his shoulders, he set it upon a pole, and brought it to 
Malcolm. This was the end of Macbeth, after he had reigned 
seventeen years over the Scotishmen." f 

May we not hazard the conjecture that Shakspeare, desirous 
that the range of the action in the closing scene of his drama

should not be extended beyond the ground before the Castle of 
Dunsinane, and fancying, probably, that Lunfanaine was some 
insignificant village in the immediate vicinity, specified the place 
where the contest between Macbeth and Malcolm had been re- 
presented by Hollinshead as commencing, and took no notice of 
the place where the contest had been represented by the chroni- 
cler as terminating  

James VI., animated by a desire of extirpating sorcery from his 
dominions, issued, in 1596-1597, commissions for the purpose of 
" haulding justice courtis on witches" in Aberdeen. The trials 
that took place in these courts have been lately published by the 
Spalding Club. They are marked by features of folly and atro- 
city that cannot now fail to awaken feelings of wonder and indig- 
nation. Of the preposterous charges brought against the parties, 
a large proportion of whom were from the parish of Lumphanan, 
a few specimens may be given. 

Of the Dittay against one Issobell Richie, the following charge 
forms a part : — 

" Thow art indyttit for the being at the twa devylische dances, 
betwixt Lumfannand and Cragleauche, with vmquhill Margerat 
Bane, vpon Alhallowewin last, quhair thow conferrit with the 
Dewill; and at that time thow ressauit thy honours fra the Dewyll, 
thy maister, and were appoynted be him in all tymes thairefter his 
special domestic, seruand, and furriour, qwhilk thow can nocht 
denye." 

In the Dittay against Margrat Og, this accusation is preferred : 
" Thow art indyttit as a notorious witche, for the bevitching of 
vmquhill Agnes Ross, Lady Auchinhuifi; in maner folowing, to 
vit : The said vmquhill Agnes having bocht a schowder of mut- 
toun fra Johne Duged, at the mylne of Auchinhuiff, in the moneth

this thow can nocht deny, for the said vmquhill Agnes, imme- 
diatlie befoir her departure, left her dead on the, and thy said

In the Dittay against Margerat Clerk, this charge is made:- 
« Thow art accusit, that, being desyrit by Alexander Cultis, att 
the Mylne of Auchlossin, to cum to him, quha had then ane cow 
caffit, and the said cow wald na wayes suffer hir calff to sowk hir,

Proprietors o/LanJ.-Lumphanan formed a part of the barony 
of O'Neill, which in the thirteenth century belonged to the Dur- 
wards. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries it passed through

a variety of hands, which cannot, in the imperfect records of the 
period, be accurately traced. 

About 1330, Randolph, Earl of Moray, tenant to Duncan, Earl 
of Fife, in the estate of Lumphanan, granted to Sir James de 
Garvieaugh Garioch, the lands of Balnacraig, Belode Beltie, 
Cloychock Cloak, and Talanchsyn Tillyching. From the 
son of this knight, Andrew de Garvieaugh of Caskieben, Robert 
de Camera or Chalmers obtained these lands, to be holden of the 
Earl of Moray for a pair of white gloves rendered yearly at the 
manor of Caskieben, and became the founder of a house which 
flourished for more than 400 years. Of the Chalmerses of Bal- 
nacraig, Patrick Chalmers, Esq. of Auldbar is, it is believed, a re- 
presentative.-f- 

About 1363, Andrew, second son of William Rose, second ba- 
ron of Kilravock, acquired the lands of Auchlossin.:]: In 1544, a 
feudal strife arose between the Forbeses and Strachan of Len- 
turk, in consequence of the real or imaginary guilt of Strachan in 
betraying the conspiracy formed by the Master of Forbes against 
the king's life to the Earl of Huntly. Nicholas Rose of Auchlos- 
sin joined the Laird of Lenturk, and fell in one of the conflicts. 
He was personally obnoxious to the Forbeses, as he had sat on 
the assize which had found the Master guilty.§ In 1643, the 
possessions of the Rosses comprised the barony of Auchlossin, the 
lands of Bogloch, Deray-croft, and croft of Alderan Arden ra- 
ver. || In September 1709, Captain Francis Ross of Auchlossan 
was slain at the battle of Malplaquet; and, in 1715, his estate 
was sold by his creditors.lF 

The Duguids of Auchinhove were of later origin. In 1634, 
they pleaded, in an action brought by the Earl of Mar against his 
vassals, that " they and their predecessors had been infeft in their 
lands, holding of the king, for the space of 200 years." In 1656, 
Francis Duguid purchased, from George Forbes of Corse, that 
part of the barony of O'Neil Corse which lay in Lumphanan, in- 
cluding Easter and Wester Kincraigie, Knowhead-Hillock, and

Bogloch. In addition to these lands, the Diiguids possessed, in 
1675, Auchinhuiff, Over-Auchinhuiff, Warthill, Tulloch, Whyte- 
hous, Blelak and boigs thereof, Cornetoun and boigs thereof, Badin- 
ley and Mariewell, in the parish of Lumphanan, besides an estate 
in Coull and Aboyne. f In 1745, the representative of the family 
joined the forces of the Pretender ; his mansion-house was burned 
by a party of the Duke of Cumberland's soldiers ; and the spot is 
still pointed out on the hill of Coull, from which he beheld the pro- 
gress of the flames. In 1755, the Mains of Auchinhove were ad- 
judged to William Young ; the greater part of the estate having 
been sold at an earlier period. In 1699, Robert Duguid married 
Miss Teressa Leslie of Balquhain, and his descendant now repre- 
sents that ancient house under the name of Count Leslie. 

Camp Hill belonged for a considerable period to a family of 
the name of Forbes, sprung from the Forbeses of Monymusk, 
and in 1783 was sold by the Reverend Francis Forbes, minister 
of Grange, father of the Reverend Dr Patrick Forbes, Professor 
of Humanity in King's College, Aberdeen, to Sir William For- 
bes of Craigevar.§ 

In 1670, Francis Fraser purchased Findrack from Sir Robert 
Forbes of Learnie. 1| In addition to their estate in Lumphanan, 
the Frasers acquired at diff'erent periods the lands of Tolmads, 
Drumlassie, and Birselassie, in Kincardine O'Neil. 

In 1712, Kintocher passed by adjudication to the Forbeses of 
Craigevar, a family which can trace its descent through the 
Lords Forbes to a remote antiquity, and which has ranked among 
its members Patrick Forbes of Corse, Bishop of Aberdeen ; John

Antiquities.— The Peel Bog.— The Peel Bog, situate in a 
marshy hollow near the church, is an interesting monument of an- 
tiquity. The circular earthen mound, forty-six yards in diame- 
ter, rises about twelve feet above the level fof the bog, and is sur- 
rounded by a moat. The course by which the water was convey- 
ed from the burn of Lumphanan may still be traced; the mea- 
surement of the circumvallation by which the water was confined 
may still be made ; the situation of the drawbridge is still discer- 
nible; the path leading from the fosse to the top of the mound 
may still be trodden; and the sluice by which the water issued 
trom the moat was laid bare by the flood of 1829. 

That the Peel Bog, a name which is of Saxon origin, was erect- 
€d in the beginning of the thirteenth century, when the Saxon 
language was probably introduced into Scotland; that a wooden 
castle, erected on the artificial mound, was a residence of the 
Durwards, who then possessed a wide domain in Aberdeenshire 
stretching from Skene to the western boundary of Cromar, and 
that this ancient structure, guarded by a moat, and surrounded by 
that « wode of Lunfanan," into which Macbeth, according to 
Wyntown had been chased, was, during that century," a strong 
place of defence against warlike and predatory attacks,— these 
are conjectures which the writer of this article is disposed to make 
respecting this fortress. 

Edward I after the battle of Dunbar, marched his victorious 
army to Aberdeen, where the bishop, Walter Blackwatre, the 
Dean, Sir Walter de Scherwinglawe, Sir Norman de Lechelvn 
Sir Duncan de Frendragh, Sir Hugh de la Hay, &amp;c. took the 
oath of allegiance to him. On Saturday, 2Ist July 1296, he road 
to Lunfanan, accompanied by Sir Walter de Beauchamp, Sir John 

other knights and esquires, and received the submi sion of sTr

It can hardly be doubted that the Peel Bog which, with the 
exception of the Bass at Inverury, was then- the most important 
wooden fortress in the county of Aberdeen, was the scene of the 
submission of Sir John de Malevill to the EngUsh monarch. 

In 1487, the lands of Halton, Pitmorchie, and Craigamore in 
Lumphynhanan, were granted by James III. to Thomas Chartens 
of Kinfauns.t In 1546, Thomas Charteris of Kinfauns was 
served heir to his grandfather Thomas, in the barony of Lun- 
fanan, lying within the barony of O'Neil.t In 1655, Patrick Ir- 
vine was served heir to his grandfather, John Irvine, in the lands 
of Halton, Pitmurchie, and Craigton of Lumphanan, lying within 
the barony of Lumphanau.§ The trials for witchcraft pubhshed by 
the Spalding Club, show that John Irvine of Pitmurchie was a per- 
son of no little consequence, as he was appointed chancellor ot 
an assize held on 25th April 1597, of which John Ross of Auch- 
lossin, Alexander Chalmer of Balnacraig, and John Forbes of 
Camphill were members. || 

A building formed a part of the Peel Bog within the memory of 
the present generation. That there existed on the top ot the 
mound, before the year 1782, the ruins of an ancient structure 
fronting the east ; that the northern gable was close to the patti 
which winds from the draw-bridge ; that the walls and the south- 
em gable, though decayed and defaced, were distinctly visible ;

that this building resembled in size, form, and the solid charac- 
ter of its masonry, the old mansion-house of the Duguids of Auch- 
enhove ; that behind these ruined walls a few stunted gooseberry 
bushes rose out of the green sward ; that this ancient structure 
was called Haa-ton House, belonging to a family that once pos- 
sessed the surrounding estate, bounded on the west by the Burn 
of Brankum, and extending towards the east beyond Craigton and 
Burnside ; that about sixty years ago the tenant of Bogloch, ani- 
mated by a zeal for improvement, razed Haa-ton House to the 
foundation, and that the stones of which it was composed were 
employed in erecting the rude dike that now surrounds the mound, 
and in building houses in the neighbourhood ; — these are facts 
which are attested by eye-witnesses, who, though they have ar- 
rived at a mature old age, possess the perfect use of their faculties, 
and by a multitude of men in middle-life, whose fathers saw the 
ruins of Haa-ton House, before they were touched by the hands of 
this zealous agriculturist. 

Viewing the facts recorded in ancient documents, in connection 
with the facts handed down by tradition, we may form the conjec- 
ture, that, about the year 1400, the wooden castle erected on the 
artificial mound was superseded by a building of stone ; that the 
more modern structure, which bore the name of Haa-ton House, 
was, during a part of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the re- 
sidence of families who possessed the surrounding estate, including 

Halton, which might easily come to be pronounced Haa-ton, a 

more natural corruption, indeed, than the modern Hilton, Pit- 
murchie, and Craigamore or Craigton,— and that the proprietors 
of the eastern section of the parish of Lumphanan found, in the 
moat which surrounded their mansion-house, a protection against 
the attacks of feudal chiefs, animated by the love of plunder, or 
smarting under the sense of private wrongs. 

The Houff.— kt a remote period of Scottish history, the Houff 
was a place of strength ; the traces of ancient buildings are still 
visible ; and very little labour would be necessary to complete the 
moat by which it was surrounded, and fill it with water. At a 
more recent date, it became the burial-ground of the Duguids,— 
the tradition of the country being, that one of the lairds o1" Auch- 
enhove, to prevent the necessity of his body being carried after his 
death through the lands of Auchlossan, erected,°on his own pro- 
perty, a place of sepulture for himself and his family.

The yearly average of births for the last seven years has been 
28 ; of marriages, 7. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — 

Arable land, about 2770 acres. 
Wood, . 550 

Uncultivated, . 4300 

Rent. — The valued rent of the parish is L.2082, 6s. 8d. Scots ; 
the real rental is about L.2830 Sterling. If no separate value is 
supposed to be put on the rough pasture, the arable ground rents 
about L.l per imperial acre. 

Husbandry. — The soil is a dry and friable loam ; the climate 
is early ; the average produce of the imperial acre is about four 
quarters ; the grain is heavy ; oats vi'eighing from 40 to 44 lbs. ; 
bear, from 50 to 54 lbs. ; and barley, from 54 to 58 lbs. per 
bushel. The general character of the husbandry is excellent. 

The pure Aberdeenshire breed of cattle, which in many parts 
of the country is corrupted and ruined, has been kept up in this 
parish ; an intelligent tenantry perceiving that it is much better 
suited to the soil and climate than those crosses which require 
rich and sheltered pastures to bring them to maturity. Within 
the last twenty-five years, great and permanent improvements 
have been effected ; substantial and commodious farm-steadings 
have been built; farms have been subdivided by fences; marshes 
have been drained ; and the range of cultivation has been gradu- 
ally extended over our waste moorlands, and up our mountain 
sides. Under the old leases, the seven course system of cropping 
was followed, consisting of three grasses, three grain crops, and 
one green crop. Under the new leases, on Mr Farquharson's 
property, the tenants are generally bound to adopt the six course 
system of cropping, consisting of three grasses, two grain crops, 
and one green crop. The draining of the Loch of Auchlossan, 
which consists of about 250 acres, would be an improvement of a 
valuable character ; the cold damp vapours, which in August and 
September often blast the crops, would be no longer exhaled from

its waters ; while a large extent of rich alluvial soil, added to the 
estates of the surrounding proprietors, would amply repay them 
for the expense of executing the work. 

If, in addition to this drainage, which might be easily effected, 
as the average depth of the loch is only five feet, and as its level 
is considerably higher than that of the Burn of Drumdouan when 
it approaches the Slog of Dess, the hills which surround Mr Far- 
quharson's estate were clothed with wood, few spots in the county 
of Aberdeen would surpass in beauty the valley of Lumphanan. 

Woods. The average sum which has been realized from the 

fellings and thinnings of the woods in the parish, which consist 
chiefly of larch and Scots fir, has been for some years about L.IO. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Mea7is oj Communication. — The means of communication are 
ample. The turnpike from Aberdeen to Tarland runs through 
the parish from east to west, while the rude military road, made 
about the year 1746, and the finely kept one, executed under the 
authority of the Parliamentary Commissioners for Highland Roads 
and Bridges, cross it from north to south. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church, which was built in 1762, and 
is placed in as centrical a situation as it could well be, contains 
383 sittings. 

The manse, which was built in 1782, was repaired and enlarged 
in 1828. 

There are about 7k imperial acres in the glebe. The stipend 
consists of L.112, 17s. 3d. money; 51 bolls, 1 firlot, 2 pecks, 
8f lbs. of meal, and I boll, 1 firlot, and 3i pecks of bear. 

Divine service is well attended in the church. The average 
number of communicants is 509. There are four Dissenters in 
the parish. 

Collections are annually made for the General Assembly s 
Schemes, and the Aberdeen Infirmary. 

Education.— The following branches are taught, and fees ex- 
acted in the parochial school. English reading, 2s. per quarter; 
Ena-lish and writing, 2s. 6d. ; arithmetic, 3s. ; Latin, 4s. ; ma- 
thematics, 4s. ; elements of Greek, 4s. ; book-keepmg, per set, 
15s • English grammar, 3s. 6d. The schoolmaster has a garden. 
His salary is L.27. He shares in the Dick Bequest. There is 
a school at Camphill, the teacher of which receives the interest 
of L.150, bequeathed by James Hunter, Esq. of DarrahilU 

• L.1300 according to Mr. Walker's estimate.

Library.— The library, established in 1814, at Tillyching, 
now contains more than 400 volumes. 

The inhabitants of the parish, with the exception of two indi- 
viduals, can read and write. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average annual amount of 
the collections made at the church door, during 1836, 1837, 
1838, 1839, 1840, and 1841, was L.17, 5s. 9d. 

The average annual amount during these years of funds de- 
rived from interest of money and other sources, that passed through 
the hands of the kirk- session, was L.10, 6s. 9|d. 

The average number of impotent persons during these years 
receiving relief was 2. 

The average annual sum divided during these years among 
these impotent persons, was L.6, lis. llgd. 

The average number of persons, not impotent, receiving relief 
during these years, was 18. 

The average annual sum divided during these years among 
persons not impotent, was L.'20, 17s. llfd. 



Since the account of this parish was printed, the writer has dis- 
covered someinteresting notices respecting the Peel Bog. In 1657, 
Patrick Irvine obtained from Oliver, Lord Protector, a precept 
under the Great Seal respecting the lands of Craigtown of Luni- 
phanan, Halton Peill, and Colliescroft. In 1702, Robert Ross 
granted a disposition in favour of Francis Ross, of the lands of 
Auchlossan, Cairnbady, Bogloch, Aldcairn, Craigtown of Lum- 
phanan, the Peill thereof, called Halton of Lumphanan, Collie's 
Croft, Wester Kincardine, Dean's Cotts, and Haughhead. — Char- 
ters in possession of John Farquharson, Esq. of Finzean. Among 
the estates which vyere entailed in 1790 by the trustees of Fran- 
cis Farquharson, Esq. of Finzean were included " All and haill 
the lands of Halton, with the Peill and manour-place thereof, 
houses, biggings, yards, and orchards of the said lands of Halton." 
— Appellant's Case, page 4, in the suit respecting the validity of 
the Finzean entail, now before the House of Lords. It is obvi- 
ous that these notices afford a strong confirmation of the opinions 
expressed in the article respecting the Peel Bog.

PRESBYTERY OF ABERDEEN, StNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. GEORGE MACKENZIE, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
JsJame. — The name of the parish is said to be derived from the 
Gaelic sgian, {or skian, "the dagger, or knife," that weapon having 
been used by the man who killed a wild boar which had attacked 
King Malcolm Ganmore whilst hunting within the bounds of the 
parish, then supposed to be part of the King's forest. For which 
service, the same tradition says, the yoting Highlander, was re- 
warded by a grant of the whole land in the parish. 

Extent, 4-c.— The extent of the parish is nearly 6 miles by 4. 
It is bounded by the parishes of Kinellar, Newhills, Peterculter, , 
Echt, Cluny, Kemnay, and Kintore. _ ' 

Hydrography.— The Loch of Skene is nearly three miles in 
circumference, situated near the west boundary of the parish. Its 
greatest depth does not exceed twelve feet. It is supplied by se- 
veral small streams, and is the reservoir which supplies water for , 
one of the meal mills in the parish, and for the works of Messrs | 
Hadden and Sons a wool manufactory at Garlogie mills. ' 

Geology.— The soil is various, from the undulating nature of 
the grounds in the parish ; several of the ridges although they 
can scarcely be called hills rising to a considerable height, and, 
with two excepted, which are planted, cultivated to the tops. 
There are some rich and fertile fields ; but few comparatively ; 
the greater part of the land being either light or cold. The sub- 
soil is chiefly clay, part sand or gravel, and there is a considerable 

extent of moss. n  . r«„ 

There has been a great improvement, by means of plantation, 
since the time of the last Statistical Account. Almost every he- 

' The reward offered by the King is said to have been a hound's chaee or a hawk's 
flight. The latter was preferred.

ritor in the parish has planted to a greater or less extent on his 
property. There are some fine old trees around the house of 
Skene, particularly a chestnut tree on the lawn, and some silver- 
firs in the Hne of the west approach to the house. 

II. — Civil History. 

Land-owners.— There are fourteen heritors in the parish. 
Their lands are, Skene, Easterskene, Kirkville, Leddach, Black- 
hills, Kinmundy, Concraig, Auchenclech, Newton, Fiddie, Easter 
Ord, Wester Ord, Easter Carnie, and Garlogie Mills. The ori- 
ginal charter|of the lands of Skene, granted by King Robert Bruce, 
is still preserved. But the family and name of Skene, as lairds 
of Skene, after long possessing the lands in the direct line, be- 
came extinct in 1827. The lands are now in the management 
of trustees. The Earl of Fife is heir of entail. 

Parochial Registers. — The oldest session record begins in the 
year 1676, and continues to 1696; the second, from 1709 to 
1714; the third, from 1720 to 1744; after which year they have 
been regularly kept to the present time. The register of bap- 
tisms begins in 1726, and has been carried on to the present time. 
The register of marriages begins in 1756, and is continued to 
179.3; then there is a blank of twenty years; and from 1813, it 
has been regularly kept. A cash-book of the distribution of the 
poor's funds has been kept from the year 1744; and minutes of 
the meetings of heritors, for the last ten years, have been regu- 
larly kept. 

Mansion-Houses. — The House of Skene consists of two build- 
ings united. The oldest has evidently stood for several centuries, 
from the style of building and strength of the walls. The date is 
not known. The other part of the house is comparatively mo- 
dern, — the interior having been completed only a few years ago. 
There are some fine old paintings in the house, and an extensive 
library of books, upwards of 6000 volumes in ancient and modern 
literature, well arranged, and carefully kept. 

The House of Easterskene, built by the present proprietor, 
William M'Combie, Esq., is a spacious modern building of the 
Tudor or Elizabethan style, surrounded by thriving young plan- 
tations and belts of wood, and commanding an extensive prospect, 
having the Loch of Skene and the lower range of the Grampians 
in the front view.  

' The expression in the charter is " confirmaese," seeming to imply that the king 
had renewed the grant of the lands, as formerly held. 



1098 ABER1EENSHIRE. .| 

Kirkvillo House, belonging to William Knowles, Esq. is of mo- , 
dern date, having been built within the last twenty years : it is in .. 
the cottage style. 

Antiquities.— Besides the Druidical temples and tumuli noticed 
in the former Account, with the Hill of Keir, the top of which 
seems to have been well adapted for a watch-tower in former days, 
we have now to mention two Roman urns and a Roman sword, and 
the points of two spears, which have been lately found near the line 
of the Roman road, passing through the parish from the river Dee 
to the Don. These relics are in the possession of the proprietor 
of Kirkville, on whose lands they were found. Among the anti- 
quities may also be noticed some valuable manuscripts in the li- 
brary at Skene House, beautifully written previous to the inven- 
tion of printing ; and, not less valuable to the proprietors of the 
lands of Skene, the identical skian by which the lands were won, 
said to be in the possession of a relative of the family. A stone,, 
bearing the inscription, " Drum stone, Harlaw, 1411," stands on 
a height upon the lands of Easterskene. 

HI. — Population. 

The population in 1801, was 1140 
 1811, 1297 

1821, 1440 
1831, 1677 
1835, 1734

Live-stock.— llnxnhev of cattle, 2200 ; and of horses, 230. 
Very few sheep are now kept in the parish, as the greater part ot 
the moorland is either improved or planted with wood. Con- 
.iderable attention is paid by farmers to improving the breed 
of cattle, as also to the feeding. Some of the best oxen have been 

.-iS-»on 
fighting hand to hand with M'Lcan of Coll.

sent to the London market, for several years past, from the port 
of Aberdeen, particularly by Mr Milne at Fornet of Skene, wha 
occupies an extensive farm. 

Eent.~The rental of the whole parish is about L.6410. The 
average rent per acre isL.l. Valued rent, L.2500, 6s. 8d. Scots, 

The length of leases is generally nineteen years. 

A general improvement in agriculture has taken place since last 
Account ; and of late, furrow-draining has been introduced, which 
must ameliorate the soil in several parts of the parish, where the 
ordinary mode of draining had little effect in preventing the injury 
done to the land by surface water. Most of the fields are in- 
closed with dry-stone fences, as there is a superabundance of ma- 
terial for this purpose throughout the parish. A good specimen' 
of these inclosures presents itself to the eye of the traveller on the 
Skene turnpike road, upon the lands of Easterskene, where the 
proprietor has furnished employment to the labourer for several 
years past, in trenching the land, and in building dikes. 

A considerable extent of waste land has been brought into cul- 
tivation above 1000 acres since last Account, particularly on the 
lands of Ord, Fiddie, Carnies, Easterskene, Leddach, Blackhills, 
Kinmundy, Concraig, Newton, and Auchenclech. The late pro- 
prietor of Kirkville added by draining two new farms, with farm- 
steadings, where farm had never been before, on the haughs ra- 
ther bogs of the Leuchar Burn, on his lands of Hillcairnie, 
This he effected by straighting, cutting, and deepening the burn; 
at considerable expense, part of which, of course, was borne by 
the heritors on the opposite side of the Leuchar. 

Manufactures. — At Garlogie, there is a spinning manufactory 
for wool, belonging to Messrs Hadden and Sons in Aberdeen, 
where about 120 people, old and young, are generally employed. 
Steam power is occasionally added when the supply of water from 
the Loch of Skene falls short. Gas has been introduced of late' 
for lighting the works in the winter season. The Company are 
very attentive to the comfort of the families employed at the work r 
they have built neat cottages for their accommodation, and give 
them garden ground attached, all divided and inclosed. A com- 
modious school-house has been added, which is attended by about 
60 scholars during the day, consisting of the younger children, and 
by nearly as many of the older children in the evening, after the 
work of the day is over in the mill. The school-room is also occu-

pied every alternate Sabbath evening as a place of worship for the 
families in the place, as they have not sittings in the parish church. 
On the other Sabbath evenings, the younger branches of the fa- 
milies attend for instruction in the Sabbath school, under the care 
of the schoolmaster of the place, with three assistants connected 
with the works. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication.— There are two branches of turnpike- 
road leading to the west from Aberdeen, which is distant only 
six miles from their junction at the east boundary of the parish, 
the one branch running nearly through the middle of the parish 
towards Alford and Strathdon ; the other, more to the south, to- 
wards Tarland and Kincardine. A stage-coach passes by the for- 
mer line, every alternate day, from Aberdeen to Alford. A mail- 
gig runs daily on the same line ; and there is a sub-post-office 
near the centre of the parish. The disposable produce of this and 
the surrounding parishes finds a ready market m the town of Aber- 
deen. Coals, lime, and bone-manure are brought from Aberdeen. 
The commutation-roads are now kept in a much better state of 
repair than formerly. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church was built in 1801 ; has beett 
lately repaired by the heritors ; is centrically placed for the pa- 
rishioners; but is now rather small, being seated for 700, whilst 
there are 800 communicants ; and the preceding table of the po- 
pulation shows an increase of 706 since the year in which the 
church was built. The manse was built in 1779, and contained 
only four rooms and two small attics ; but, with an addition lately 
given by the heritors, without solicitation, it is now amply commo- 
dious. The glebe contains ten acres of land, part of which was 
brought into cultivation by the last incumbent, having been for- 
merly pasture or grass glebe. The stipend is one of the small 
livings, made up to L.150 by the Exchequer. In some years it 
exceeds this amount, as some of the heritors pay their proportions 

by the tiars' prices. 

There is a small Congregational chapel in the parish, seated for 
200 hearers, the members of which belong partly to this and partly 
to the adjoining parishes. Their present pastor is well educated, 
and is an acceptable and faithful labourer among his people. 

Eclucatio7i.— The parish school is centrically situated. There 
is an average attendance of from 80 to 90 scholars in winter, and 
from 40 to 50 in summer. The ordinary branches of education are

taught, including Latin, geography and book-keeping. The salary 
is L.30, with an allowance of L.2 for a garden. The teacher has the 
benefit of the Dick Bequest, and also L.20 yearly from the funds 
of the late Dr Milne of Bombay, for teaching 25 poor schloars. 

Since the time of the great increase of the population, there have 
been two private or unendowed schools set on foot by the parish- 
ioners, one in the east, and the other in the west end of the pa- 
rish. The average attendance of scholars at both these schools is 
from 60 to 70 throughout the year. There are also two small 
schools taught by female teachers, attended by about 50 younger 
children. The school at Garlogie mills has been already no- 
ticed. There are seven Sabbath schools in the parish, well attend- 
ed. These facts prove that the people generally are fully sensible 
of the benefits of useful and religious instruction to their children. 

Libraries. — There is a parish library, supported by regular an- 
nual contributions of Is. by each reader. There are now upwards 
of 600 volumes. There is also a Hbrary connected with the Sab- 
bath schools, supported by an annual contribution of sixpence from 
each member of the society. There are now upwards of 900 
small volumes entered upon the catalogue. The books are given 
out to the scholars by the teachers at a monthly exchange. 

Society. — There is a Juvenile Missionary and Bible Society in 
the parish, which has contributed about L.12 yearly for the last 
three years to the Assembly's Schemes, besides giving a donation 
to the Aberdeen Bible Society, and Bibles and New Testaments 
to the poor children within the parish. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of poor on 
the roll is 36, besides orphan children, and others who receive oc- 
casional assistance. The ordinary poor receive from 6s. to 10s. 
quarterly. A few bed-rid paupers have received from 2s. to 3s. 6d. 
weekly. The sources of supply are, collections in the church, 
L.50 inthe year; interest of money, L.16; proclamation of banns 
and mortcloth dues, from L.2 to L.3; all of which having been 
found insufficient, the heritors have for several years past made 
up the deficiency by a voluntary contribution of from L.45 to L.60 
a year. Part of the allowance to the poor on the roll is given in 
mea I, andthe rest in money. 

Inns, c, — There are two inns on the middle line of turnpike- 
road, where travellers and carriers may be comfortably accommo- 
dated. There are 6 grocers' shops within the parish, and 4 meal- 
mills. There are 3 blacksmiths, 6 cart and plough -wrights, and 
1 mill-wright.

PRESBYTERY OF ALFORD, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER TAYLOR, MINISTER. 



I. Topography and Natural History. 

iVame.— The present parish of Leochel and Cushnie consists 
of the two old parishes of these names, with the addition, eccle- 
siastically, of the lands of Corse, which are civilly in the parish of 
CouU. In ancient documents, the following varieties of spelling 
are found: Loychel, Loquhell, Lochel, Lochal, Leuchell, and 
■Leochell: Cussenin, Cusschene, Cusseny, Cuischnie, Cusney, 
and Cushney. The etymology of Leochel, given in the former 
Statistical Account, is evidently untenable. It is there derived 
from Leath-ChuU, signifying the " half of Coull." But there is 
no trace of the termination oul in any of the ancient forms of the 
word, and the separate and independent existence of the parish of 
Leochel can be established from about the year 1165, the begin- 
ning of the reign of William the Lion. A much more probable 
account is, that, as the parish takes its name from the burn or 
water of Leochel, and as this stream rises from a cleft or hollow 
in the Hill of Cushnie, near an eminence called Crag-Leoch, 
Leochel, or Leochal, is comiounded of Leoch, the name of this 
crag, and ale, signifying a " clear stream." But perhaps the 
most probable derivation of all is from the Celtic Lli, signifying a 
« stream," and uchel, signifying « high," a character very ap- 
plicable, in consequence of the elevated ground from vh.ch the 
Leochel descends in its course to the Don. Cussenin, the oldest 
form of Cushnie, seems to be derived from Cosh, foot, and Faim 
height, in composition Coshnainn, "the foot of the height or hill, 
which is exactly descriptive of the place. 

EM and Botindaries.-The form of the parish is irregular. 
The middle portion may be considered as approaching to the hgure 



LEOCHEL AND CUSHNIE.

dT a parallelogram, 5 miles from east to west, by 3i miles from 
north to south. To this there is added, on the north-west angle, 
a projection, running to the Don, of two miles by one ; and ano- 
ther on the east side, extending south-east, of like dimensions. 
This will give an area of about 21 square miles, or 13,440 impe- 
rial acres, a result very nearly corresponding with actual survey. 
It is bounded on the east by Alford, Tougli, and Lumphanan ; 
on the south, by Lumphanan and CouU ; on the west, by Tarland 
and Towie ; and on the north, by Kildrummy and Alford. 

Surface.— The surface of the parish is much diversified. The 
western boundary is the Soccoch, or Hill of Cushnie, rising to an 
altitude of 2000 feet above the level of the sea ; and from the 
base of this hill, there are four mountainous ridges, running from 
west to east, through the whole length of the parish, and as many 
valleys, each watered by its own little stream. The crests of 
these ridges are barren, and the cultivated ground lies on the 
southern and northern slopes, and in the bottoms of the valleys. 
The lowest parts of the valleys are 500 feet above the level of 
the sea, and the cultivation is in some cases pushed up the accli- 
vities of the hills, to the height of at least 500 feet more. The 
■prospect from the summit of the Hill of Cushnie well repays the 
toil of the ascent. To the south are seen the fertile vale of Cro- 
mar, with the lofty chain of the Grampians beyond, among which 
Mount Keen and Lochnagar rise preeminent; to the west, Mor- 
ven and Benavon ; to the north-west, the windings of the Don 
through the valley of Towie, and Bel-rinnes in the distance ; to 
the north, the Buck of the Cabrach and the Tap of Noth, with 
the upper part of Strathbogie ; and to the north-east and east, 
the vale of Alford, highly cultivated and richly wooded, with its 
bounding mountains, the district of the Garioch, and the flat 
■country extending even to the Buchan coast. Various other 
points afford pleasing, though much less extensive views ; and to 
•look down from the Hill of Corse on the south, the Hill of Crai- 
gievar on the east, or the Hill of Fowlis near the centre of the 
parish, on a summer afternoon, when the heat has been tempered 
by a refreshing shower, and the soft light of the setting sun re- 
poses on the uplands gray with heath, the slopes green with corn 
•and grass, and the hollows sparkling with their winding rivulets, 
gives a lively idea of " a land of hills and valleys, that drinketh 
water of the rain of Heaven." 

• Meteorology. — A thermometer has been registered at 9 o'clock, 
taorning and evening, since the 1st January 1842 ; and the direc-,.

S. W. 116, W. 10, N. W. 83, N. 7, and N. E. 36. It thus ap- 
pears that our prevailing winds are the S. W. the N. W. and the 
S. E. winds. The S. W. is the genial point, the N. W. the 
stormy one, and the S. E. the wet one. The strongest gales are 
from the N. W., of which there was a remarkable instance on the 
night between the 11th and 12th March 1842, when it blew a per- 
fect hurricane, overthrowing corn- stacks, damaging the roofs of 
houses where not slated, and laying prostrate trees, to a melan- 
choly extent. Upwards of 200 trees fell in the wood of Craigievar, 
though by no means a large plantation. 

Climate.— Both Leochel and Cushnie have long had an evil 
report, on account of the coldness and lateness of the climate, 
and the consequent uncertainty of the crops. When Gilderoy 
and his gang of freebooters haunted the hills of Cushnie in the 
beginning of the seventeenth century, they are said to have de- 
clared them to be the coldest in Scotland. 

There can be no doubt that, on account of the great elevation 
of the district, and its mountainous character, together with the 
nature of the soil, the seasons are from ten to fourteen days later 
than in the lower part of the vale of Alford, and the adjoining 
vale of Cromar. The air is also keen and bracing, but, on the 
whole, conducive to health and longevity, of which the fifty years' 
incumbency of Mr Thomas Reid at Leochel, and Mr Francis 
Adam at Cushnie, in the last century, was no unsatisfactory proof. 
In confirmation of this, and also in illustration of the prevalent dis- 
eases, it may be stated, that, of 49 persons who have died in the pa- 
rish during the last four years, 1839, 1840, 1841, and 1842, tnty- 
one have died from old age and general decay of nature, chiefly

manifested in derangement of the digestive and respiratory or- 
gans, ] 1 of consumption, 2 of dropsy, 2 of epilepsy, 2 from ac- 
cidents by burning, ] of apoplexy, i of hydrocephalus, 3 of in- 
flammation of the bowels, 1 of constipation, 1 of hooping-cough, 
and 6 of obscure and unknown complaints ; and of these 49, 6 
died in infancy, 3 in childhood and under twenty, 9 from twenty 
to thirty, 4 from thirty to forty, 1 from forty to fifty, 3 from fifty 
to sixty, 5 from sixty to seventy, 9 from seventy to eighty, 8 
from eighty to ninety, and 1 at the age of ninety- five. Urinary 
complaints seem not uncommon among men in advanced life, 
and chronic rheumatism prevails to some extent. Last season, 
two or three cases of small-pox appeared, fortunately not fatal, 
which were clearly traced to infection and neglect of vaccination. 

Hydrography.— district is very well supplied in general 
with perennial springs of excellent water. The burn or water of 
Leochel, already mentioned, is the principal stream in the parish. 
It rises at the south-west angle, from a cleft in the Hill of Cush- 
nie, runs east for three miles through the south part of Corse, 
then turns north-east and north for other three miles, partly 
bounding and partly intersecting the parish, and then north-west 
and north for four miles more till it falls into the Don at Alford. 
The other rivulets are almost all tributaries to the Leochel, and" 
run from west to east. The burn of Rumlie rises in the moss of 
Confunderland, waters the " Howe of Corse," and, after a course 
of three miles, falls into the Leochel at Muirton. The burn of 
the Sheal rises at the head of the " Howe of Leochel," and runs 
through it for three miles till it joins the Leochel at Knockan- 
doch. The burn of Cushnie, the next in size to the Leochel, 
rises from the Glen of Cushnie, at the eastern base of the hill,' 
and has a course of four miles east, to its junction with the Leo- 
chel at Brigton of Ininteer, and the Droich's Burn runs from the 
south-eastern slope of the Hill of Caillievar, and divides the pa- 
rish from Alford on the north. From the deep and narrow val- 
leys through which they flow, and the high and steep grounds oq 
either side, all these rivulets are liable to sudden floods, and, in 
1839, did no little damage in demolishing bridges, and carryino- 
away patches of the haugh land lying along their course. Mos°t 
ot these little streams abound with trout, especially the Leochel 
which IS reputed the best trouting stream in the whole district'

that of Tonley, passes through a deep and well-wooded dell, and 
forms a picturesque little waterfall. It is called the Linn of Lyn- 
turk, and has the reputation of being haunted by the apparition 
of a lady in green or white ; but the oldest living inhabitant not 
having had ocular demonstration, the colour of the dress remains 

doubtful.  1 • rp 1 

Geoloqy.—T\xe rocks are almost exclusively granite. 1 owards 
the west and north sides of the parish, its colour is gray, and on 
• • the south side of Corse it inclines to red. Where it is met with 
at or near the surface, it is generally in a state of decomposition. 
Boulders are by no means frequent ; and waste and, when re- 
claimed either by the plough or by trenching, yields but a smal 
quantity of stones, and these so diminutive, as to be mostly unfat 
for fences. There is. consequently, a great dearth of stones both 
for dikes and houses, and they must often be brought from a con- 
siderable distance for the latter purpose. The soil, m general, 
has a strong admixture of clay ; in some places it is a rich loam ; 
and at the bottoms of the valleys, and along the courses of the 
rivulets, occasional plots of an alluvial nature are found. The 
subsoil is commonly a retentive clay.  , \\a

Botany. — In Murray's Northern Flora, Culmelly is given as a 
station for a hairy variety of Veronica scutellata, the banks of the 
burn of Lynturk for Asperula odorata, and the parish generally 
for a variety of Campanula rotundifolia with white flowers. Py- 
rola secunda is found in the wood of Craigievar, near the cas- 
tle, and the Aivron or cloudberry, abounds in a part of the glen 
of Cushnie, hence called the Aivron brae. 

Plantations. — In former times planting was much neglected 
here, though wood tends so greatly to beautify and improve a 
a country, especially when high, mountainous, and exposed as 
this is. Its advantages are now fully understood, and about 150U 
acres imperial have been planted, mostly within the last twenty years. 
Of this about 950 acres are on the property of Craigievar and 
Corse, 260 on Lynturk, 230 on Cushnie, and 70 on Hallhead. 
All these late plantations consist almost exclusively of Scotch fir and 
larch. The former promises well, but the latter, after thriving very 
well for ten or fifteen years, is all but universally going to decay. 
The stem becomes covered with a grayish or whitish parasitic pro- 
duction like moss, the top shoots wither, and the plant in a few 
seasons perishes altogether. This prevails widely at present 
among the young plantations of larch all over the district. The 
ash, beech, and plane seem very well adapted to our soil and 
climate, and attain a large size. Of this we have proof in some 
fine old ashes and beeches near the Castle of Craigievar, an 
avenue of planes leading to the mansion-house of Cushnie, and a 
magnificent beech near that of Hallhead, the trunk of which is 
twelve feet in girth. Several of the plantations are already found 
very useful in supplying thinnings both for paling and fuel. 
II. — Civil History. 
Accounts of the Parish.— There are short notices both of 
Leochel and Cushnie in a View ofthe Diocese of Aberdeen, MS. 
in the Advocates' Library in Edinburgh ; and a brief description 
of Cushnie contained in Macfarlane's Geographical Collections, 
MS. in the same repository, was published in the Edinburgh Ma- 
gazine for 1761, Vol. V. p. 187. 

Proprietors of Land— The first possessors of land in the pa- 
rish of Leochel, so far as can be ascertained from ancient records 
were the Earls of Mar. Between the years 1 165 and 1 170, Gil-

crist, Earl of Mar, gave to the church of St Mary of Monymusk- 
and the Culdees there, the church of Leochel, with all its tithes 
and offerings, together with the half-davach of hind in which the 
church is situated. The date is fixed by the terms of the gift, 
which is said to be for the safety and prosperity of his Lord King 
William and those dear to him. Now William the Lion came 
to the crown, Dec. 9, 1165, and Gilcrist, the donor died about 
1 170 This gift of Gilcrist was twice confirmed by John, Bishop 
of Aberdeen, from 1200 to 1207 ; it was renewed by Duncan, 
Earl of Mar, son of Morgrund, and as it seems, grandson of GiU 
crist, in the reign of Alexander II. about 1234 and this lung 
confirmedit bv a royal charter; Colin Durward, the Lord of Oneill, 
in that centurv, granted to the same Culdees of Monymusk, the 
said half-davach of land in which the church of Loychell was situ- 
ated with all its pertinents and privileges, and among others the 
common pasturage of 15 cows and 100 sheep, with their follow- 
ing of two years old, and of 4 horses ; and this was confirmed by 
Anna, daughter and heiress of the said Colin, and her husband, 
Philip de Monte Scicheter. In a rental of the priory of Mony- 
musk in 1260, the value of the church of Loychell is stated at 
15 chalders and 12 bolls meal, and of the land of Loychell at 2 

Corse - The lands of Corse formed part of the barony of Coul 
and Onele, which in the thirteenth century belonged to the family 
of Durward. In 1389, this barony- was resigned by Isabella, 
Countess of Fife, daughter of Duncan, Earl of Fife, and bestow- 
ed b Sbert II., on his son, Rober,, Earl of Fife and Menteith, 
better known as Duke of Albany. On the downfal of the house 
of Albany, after the restoration of James I., and the forfeiture o 
their possessions, this barony appears to have remained attached 
to the crown till 1476, when James III. bestowed it on his ar- 
mour-bearer, Patrick Forbes, third son of James, second Lord 
Forbes, who, in 1482, had a charter under the great seal of the 
: barony of Oneil, viz. the lands of Coule, Kincragy and le Corss. 
In 1510, his son and successor, David Forbes, had a chafer of 
the lands of Onele-cross, Kincragy, le Mureton, with the mi and 
lllhouse thereof, the lands of Coule being now disjoined there- 
tU and uniting and incorporating them into a haiU and free ba- 
rony to be called the barony of Onele in all time coming. David

Was succeeded by his son Patrick, infeft in 1554; Patrick, by his 
son William, infeft in 1568, who acquired in 1593 the lands of 
Wester Corse and Norham, which, in 1512, belonged to Pan- 
toun of Pitmeddan, in 1531, to Fraser of Staniwood, and in 1540, 
to Urry of Pitfichie ; William, by his son Patrick, Bishop of Aber- 
deen, who died in 1635; Patrick, by his son John, Professor of 
Divinity in King's College, Aberdeen, who died in 1648; and John, 
by his son George, who, having, in 1656, sold that part of the ba- 
rony lying in Lumphanan, consisting of Easter and Wester Kin- 
craigie, and pendicles to Diiguid of Auchinhive, sold the remain- 
der in 1670, to Sir John Forbes, Bart, of Craigievar, to which pro- 
perty it is still united. 

Craigievar. — This property belonged for upwards of 200 years 
to a family of the name of Mortimer. In 1457, Edmund Morti- 
mer had from James II., on his own resignation, a charter of the 
lands of " Craigievar, Ballindene, Innyteire, and Wester Loch- 
ale;" in 1503, Alexander Mortimer resigned these lands in his 
own favour, into the hands of James IV. ; in 1600, Alexander 
Mortimer, eldest son of James Mortimer, fiar of Craigievar, had 
a charter of confirmation of these lands from James VI. ; and in 
1610, John Mortimer, fiar of Craigievar, sold the property to 
William Forbes of Menie. He was the second son of William 
Forbes of Corse, already mentioned, was educated in Edinburgh, 
and having acquired a large fortune by commerce, he had char- 
ters of the lands of Menie in Aberdeenshire, in 1607, of Craigie- 
var in 1610; of the barony of Auchtertoul in Fife, in 1617; of 
the barony of Finhaven and Carreston in Forfar, in 1619 ; and of 
■the lands of Fintray in Aberdeenshire, the same year. He has 
been commemorated by the celebrated Arthur Johnstone in an 
'epitaph, who says of him, 

Quas possedit opes, et terrse jugera, nemo 
Miretur, dorainum plus fuit, esse sui.f 

He was succeeded by his son William, who, in 1630, was created 
a baronet of Nova Scotia, and having embraced the side of the 
Covenanters, took an active part in the troubles which followed. 
He was appointed one of the committee for stating the national 
debt, one of the commission for planting of kirks and valuation of 
temds in 1641, one of the commissioners for conserving the Rip- 
pon treaty in 1644, one of the committee of estates in 1645, one 
of the commissioners for selling the estates of malignants in

1646, and sheriff of Aberdeen in 1647. He is frequently men- 
tioned by Spalding, who styles him " a great Covenanter, and 
" a prime man"— and represents him as " a rick-master" and 
commander of a troop of horse. He was succeeded by his son Sir 
John ; Sir John by his son Sir William ; Sir William by his son Sir 
Arthur, who represented his native county in Parliament, and was 
the bosom friend of Sir Andrew Mitchell, well known as British 
Ambassador to Frederick the Great of Prussia, who left to Sir 
Arthur the bulk of his property, including his valuable library and 
his estate of Thainston ; Sir Arthur was succeeded by his son Sir 
William, Sir William by his son Sir Arthur, and Sir Arthur by 
his brother Sir John, the seventh baronet and present pro]rie- 
tor. 

Easter Fowlis or Fowlis Mowat.— This small property belong- 
ed in the fourteenth century to the Earls of Mar, and was given 
in 1377, by William Earl of Douglas and Mar, to James Mowat. 
The Mowats appear to have held it for about a century ; and 
there is to be seen, in a hollow on the hill of Shiel, a curious me- 
morial of the last Mowat of Fowlis. This is a little mound, over- 
grown with grass, called Mowat's Seat, and a field near is named 
from it the " Mowat Seat" park. The name is accounted for by 
the tradition, that when the funeral procession of this last Mowat 
of Fowlis, whose usual imprecation had been, that « he might be 
buried beyond sight of kirk or mill," had reached this sequestered 
spot, the corpse suddenly became preternaturally heavy, and the 
bearers were obliged to inter it there, whence accordingly no 
view can be obtained of either of these objects of his animosity. In 
1479, Robert Lumysden of Madler, had a charter from the Earl of 
Rothes, superior, of t.he Halflands of Fowlis-Mowat, in the ba- 
rony of Cusny ; in 1628, Robert Lumisdane, fiar of Cushny, with 
consent of his father, John Lumisdane, sold these lands to Andrew 
Birnie, merchant-burgess of Aberdeen; in 1635, Andrew Birnie 
sold them for 14,000 merks Scots to " Capitan James torbes, 
son of umquhile Robert Forbes, commendator of Monyrausk, whose 
only daughter and heiress, Margaret Forbes, with consent of her 
husband, Peter Forbes, second son of Sir John Forbes of Cra.gie- 
var, sold them to Sir John in 1696 ; and since that time they have 
remained united to the Craigievar estate.f r i . 1

the priory of Monymusk, and the feu-duty of it is now paid to the 
Deans of the Chapel- Royal, in consequence of the priory having 
been annexed to the bishoprick of Dunblane by James VI. in 
1617, the bishop of that see being made Dean of the Chapel-Royal 
by the same king.f 

Lynturk. — This is the only other property in the old parish of 
Leochel, and belonged, at an early period, to a family of the name 
of Strachan. In 1407, the Regent Albany confirmed a charter 
by Alexander de Strathechine de Ledynturk to David Barclay de 
Durna of an annuity of five merks from the lands of Pitgerwy, in 
the Mearns.J The family kept possession of this property for 
about 200 years, but the crimes of John Strachan, younger of Len- 
turk, seem at length to have caused its downfal. In 1526, he was 
art and part with John Master of Forbes in the " cruel slaughter" 
of Alexander Setoun of Meldrum, for which, and for " hereschip 
and spuilzie of goods and slaughter," committed at the siege of Kil- 
drummy with John King, younger of Bourty, he obtained re- 
mission from the king in 1531 ; but, in 1537, he was again accus- 
ed of participating in the alleged conspiracy of the Master of 
Forbes against the Kind's life, for which the Master was condemned 
and executed; while Strachan " came in the King's will, and was 
warded beyond the water of Dee." § The whole history of this 
matter is singularly obscure ; and there are not wanting writers 
who affirm, that the conspiracy was the invention of Strachan, in 
concert with the Earl of Huntly, in order to destroy the rival house 
of Forbes, with which his own bad been so long at feud. Strachan 
is said to have gone afterwards abroad, and to have led at Paris a 
most abandoned life. || He was dead before 1588, in which year 
his son Alexander succeeded him. But the part which he had act- 
ed drew down upon him the hostility of the Forbeses. In 1544, 
they invaded his lands, and slew his allies, Duguid of Auchinhive 
and Ross of Auchlossan ; and about the end of the century, the 
lands of Lynturk became the property of the eldest cadet of the

ancient family of Irvine of Drum. They continued in possession 
of the Irvines for about a century ; and it may deserve mention, 
that Katharine, daughter of Alexander Irvine of Lenturk, was the 
wife of the famous Robert Gordon of Straloch, by whom he had 
eleven sons and six daughters ; the fifth son being James Gordon, 
parson of Rothiemay, author of a " History of Scots Affairs" from 
1637 to 1641, and of " A Description of both Towns of Aber- 
deen," with a map thereof, which he delivered to the town-coun- 
cil on the 16th October 1661 ; and in consideration " that he had 
been at great paines in draughting" it " upon ane meikle cairt of 
paper," and that it was " weill done," they ordained him to re- 
ceive " ane silver piece or cup wechtand twenlie unce, and ane 
silk hatt, with ane silk gown to his bedfellow," Both these works 
have lately been printed for the Spalding Club. About the mid- 
dle of the eighteenth century, Lynturk had come into the posses- 
sion of Gordon of Cairnfield. It was purchased from that family 
in 1816 by Peter M'Combie, late merchant in Aberdeen; and by 
him it was left to his nephew, William M'Combie, Esq. the pre- 
sent proprietor. 

Cus/mie.~ln 1222, a person of the name of Adam de Cusse- 
nin is a witness to a deed of the Earl of Mar ; and he probably 
derived his surname from the lands conferred upon him, accord- 
ing to the custom of that time. Nisbet states, that he had seen 
a charter of Hugh de Abernethy of the lands of " Owrebeuchery" 
to William de Federeth, in the reign of Alexander III. If this be 
the same with ' Corbanchory,' in the barony of Cushnie, which 
seems very probable, it would serve to connect the Aberiiethies 
with the Leslies as proprietors of Cushnie. For, in the reign of 
Robert I. Alexander de Abernethy leff three daughters co- 
heiresses, one of whom was married to Norman de Lesly, and 
brought to him the barony of Ballinbreich,t in which Cushnie is 
often said to be by annexation ; and we find Andrew de Lesly in 
possession of the barony of Cusheny in 1374, when, a grant of his 
of the lands of Culmelly and Aid Culmelly to Bernard de Ker- 
pyll was confirmed by Robert II. Again, in 1390, Robert III. 
granted a charter to Norman de Lesly, son of Andrew, of the ba- 
rony of Cusschene, with other lands.+ These were the progeni- 
tors of the Earls of Rothes, and the lands of Cushnie appear to 
have remained in their possession till the early part of the fifteenth

have had occasion to mention Robert in 1479 as proprietor of

Eminent Men — Patrick Forbes, Bishop of Aberdeen. — William 
Forbes of Corse, already mentioned, a most zealous supporter of 
the Protestant Reformation, as his father Patrick had been, had 
seven sons, four of whom were remarkable men. Of the second, 
William, the founder of the family of Craigievar, v/e have pre- 
viously given a short account. The eldest was Patrick, born in 
1564, and educated first at the grammar-school of Stirling, under 
Thomas Buchanan, a nephew of the more celebrated George, 
and afterwards both at Glasgow and St Andrews, under the fa- 
mous Andrew Melville, his cousin, where he made distinguished 
attainments in learning. On succeeding to the family estate 
about 1598, he did not allow its cares to put a period to his stu- 
dies ; and being accustomed to read and expound the Scriptures 
in his own family, the great dearth of religious instruction then 
prevalent, and the solicitations of the Aberdeen clergy, induced 
hirn to transfer his ministrations to a vacant church in the neigh- 
bourhood, in all probability that of Leochel. This was con- 
demned by Archbishop Gladstancs, and, in 1610, Patrick Forbes 
addressed a letter to the King in his own vindication, from which

the following extract will show at once the excellence of his mo- 
tives, and the lamentable want of pastors in this district at that 
time : " Being cast in these parts, where, within the precincts of 
two presbyteries, at least twenty and one churches lay unplanted, 
whereby our state were little from heathenism, I began in a 
simple and private manner necessity enforcing it on my con- 
science to catechise my own family. Thereafter, the church- 
men of that province dealing earnestlie with me, to accept of 
some pubhck charge in the ministrie of the church, which, upon 
divers respectfuU considerations, I could not as then yeild to, they 
next, with all instance, requested that, at least for the gude of 
others, 1 wold be content to transfer my domestic paines to ane 
void church, now joining to my house ; whairto having for a 
space condescendit, they afterward, by thair commissioners from 
thair synod, directed to me for that effect, yet more earnestly en- 
treated that I wold still hold on that course which as they judged 
had been in some degree fruitfull. Now, Sir, as this made my 
voice to be heard in any public place, so all my uther carriage 
therein hath been such, both in respect of the place, ane obscure 
corner of any in all your Majesty's kingdoms, and in respect of 
my quiet manner, so far from all pretences, as I never opened my 
mouth in any uther part albeit oftener than once, either seriously 
entreated, or curiously tempted and except ane ordinary lecture 
on the Lord's day, never meddled with any part of that calling m 
private or publick assembly," f He was afterwards, howeveJ 
persuaded to enter into the office of the ministry, and, in 1612, 
was settled at Kehh, whence, in 1618, he was translated to the 
see of Aberdeen. He discharged the duties of his office with 
great dilio-ence and faithfulness, being, according to Burnett, m 
bis Life of Bishop Bedell, " in all things an apostolical man." 
He reformed many abuses in the University and King's College, 
of which he was ei officio Chancellor, and, by means of subscnp- 
tions from the synod of Aberdeen, he founded there a chair of 
divinity, which was first filled by his son, Dr John. He died on 
the 28th March 1635, at the age of seventy-one, and was buried 
in Bishop Dunbar's aisle, in the cathedral, where a flat stone 
with a Latin inscription may still be seen over his grave. He 
was the author of a « Commentary on the Revelations, London,

other was within four miles. ' , , , .-

gies, and other eulogistic compositions, in prose and verse, and in 
various languages, by the most learned men of the time, was pub- 
lished at Aberdeen, entitled " Funerals of a Right Rev. Father

John Forbes, Minister of Alford.— This was the third son of 
.William Forbes of Corse. He became minister of Alford, and, 
in 1605, the Synod of Aberdeen and Moray " maid speciall choise 
of their loving brother, Mr Johne Forbes, baith for his fidelitie 
and uprichtness, and for his sincere affectioune borne to the ad- 
vancement of the kingdome of God, his Majestie's service, and 
peace of the land," as their Commissioner to lay before the King 
" all their proceedings and present difficulteis quhairwith they were 
straitit." The commission is dated at Aberdeen the 21st Fe- 
bruary ; and in March, he " past to the King, and wes verie weill 
acceptit of his Majestic, and wes sent back with diligence, carie- 
ing lettres and credit against the Erie of Huntlie and all Papistis, 
with certificatioune of the King's constancie in that religioune he 
wes brought up into, and concerning the order of the kirk, that 
his Hienes wes not myndit to alter ony thing thairin." He 
was chosen " with uniforme consent" Moderator of the General 
Assembly which met at Aberdeen on the 2d of July following j 
and in consequence of the proceedings there, he and all the bre- 
thren present were " denunceit rebellis and put to the home." The 
tyrannical measures of the court which followed are well known. 
The minister of Alford was imprisoned " in the dungeoune of 
Blacknes," and various others in the " prissounes of Dumbartan, 
Stirling, and Doune."t They were called before the Lords of the 
Secret Council on the 24th October; and on the 10th January

t Forbes was supported in his firm adherence to Presbytery by the other two 
commissioners from Alford to the Aberdeen Assembly, Mr James Irwin, minister 
of Tough, and Mr Robert Youngson, minister of Clatt, who were also confined at 
Blackness, and brought before the Council on the 24th October.

1606, he and five others were brought to trial at Linlithgow for 
treason. They made a resolute defence ; and " Mr Johnne Forbes 
and Mr Johnne Welsche, to quhom tbe rest gave the place of 
speich, spake very powerfully and unveighingly." Forbes especi- 
ally distinguished himself ; for he " rememberit thame of the Con- 
fession of Faith, quhilk they had sworn and subscryvit to profess, 
mantein, and defend to their uttirmost ; and thairwithall, taking 
the same Confession of Faith in print out of his pockett, the oath 
quhairof is maist fearfuUie conceivit, he red the same distinctlie 
and moveinglie ; and thaireeftir directit his speich to the nobillmen 
and counsellores thair presently sitting in judgement, he gaive j 
thaime ane maist grave admonitioune, with horribill threatenings ;" 
and in conclusion, " maist pithilie reassouneing from les to moir, | 
and directing the admonitioune and threatneing most terribill, I 
maide all the heireris astonischit, and their hairis to stand " But 
notwithstanding the " assyse,'' by a majority of nine to six, found 
them guilty, sentence of banishment was pronounced against them 
on the 23d October, and finally, on the 7th November, they em- 
barked at Leith, in presence of " a guid number of peiple waiting 
on to tak the guid-nicht at thame, and to see thame, quhois de- 
pairtour wes beith joyfuU and sorrowfull to many; joyfull, in that 
many guidfolkis quho were present saw thair constancie and cou- 
rao-e to stand for the guid caus they had in hand, but sorrowfull, 
because the land is deprivit of sua notabill lightis as they wer." 
Mr John Forbes was afterwards minister for many years at Delf 
in Holland, and died about 1638. He was author of many tracts 
on religious subjects, and had a son, Patrick, who subscribed the 
Covenant in presence of the famous Glasgow Assembly of 1638, 
but was subsequently Bishop of Caithness from 1662 to 1680 ;t 
and another, Arthur, a captain of horse under Munro, in the 
army of the Covenant in 1640, who, according to the parson of 
Rothiemay, was " none of the wysest nor best commanders. It 
-was rather a singular circumstance that, in 1668, a grandson of 
the exiled minister, John Forbes, should come back to lay his ashes 
with those of his ancestors in the churchyard of Leochel.§

■ Sir Arthur Forbes. — This was the fourth son of William Forbes 
of Corse, who, having entered the army, served in Ireland, was 
created a baronet in 1628, and became proprietor of Castle Forbes, 
in the county of Longford. His son was raised to the dignity of 
Earl of Granard by Charles II. after the Restoration. 

Dr John Forbes, Professor of Divinity in King's College. — He 
was the second son of Patrick Forbes of Corse, Bishop of Aber- 
deen, and Lucretia Spence, daughter of Spence of Wormiston, in 
Fife, of whose marriage, in 1588, Mr James Melvill states him- 
self to have been the occasion. John Forbes was born in 1593, 
and having passed through the usual course of study at King's 
College, Aberdeen, he went abroad, and attended several of the 
universities of Germany, especially Sedan and Heidelberg, in the 
latter of which he studied theology under the famous Paraeus. In 
1619, he was called to the office of the ministry at Middleburgh, 
and having soon after returned to his native country, he was ap- 
pointed in 1620 to the newly established chair of theology in 
Kino-'s Colleee. He was also for a short time one of the minis- 
ters of St Nicholas. In 1635, his elder brother being already dead, 
he succeeded his father in the estate of Corse. In 1638, he and 
the other Aberdeen doctors opposed the commissioners of the Co- 
venant both by their preaching and writing; and this soon involv- 
ed him in trouble with the dominant party. He appeared frequent- 
ly in synods and committees appointed to deal with him ; and 
' muche panes was tackne upon him by some of his neer rela- 
tiones, who stood for the Covenanters, for to draw him to sub- 
scrybe ; but it wold not bee. Therefor he was conveened before 
ther comittye, viz. of the General Assembly at Aberdeen in 
1640, at Marshall's house, and ther interrogated concerning his 
doctrine and beliefe ; to all which he answered so readily, so 
learndly and orthodoxly, and with such candor and modestye, that 

to Patrick B. of Catness, departed this life in Craigivar in the morning, beino- the 
Lord's day, before sermon. His burial was upon the Fryday yrafter, the penult of 
October, at night, with torches, In the Laird of Craigivar his yle and burial-place at 
Leochell " — Burial reg. of Leochel. In the same record of mortality we find that 
'• Mr John Young, some time minister at Birss and Keig, died at Miltonbank, Octo- 
ber the 18th 1671, and was buried in the Laird of Craigivar his yle at Leochell Oc- 
tober 24th." He was one of the commissioners from the Presbytery of Alford at the 
Assembly of 1638, and no doubt ejected by the re-establishment of Episcopacy after 
the Restoration, when upwards of 350 churches were summarily rendered vacant by 
the Act of Conformity.

the moderator of that comittye was forced to tell him, that they 
had nothing to say to his lyfe, but that they founde him piouse, 
learnd, and fully orthodoxe, and to disagree with them in nothing 
but in poynt of churche governement ; and earnestly beseeched 
him he wold be pleased to tacke the Covenant, shewing him that 
it was ther greefe if they wer necessitated for to putt him from his 
statione upon his refusall." He was deposed in 1641, and obliged 
to leave his native country in 1644, when he took refuge in Hol- 
land, and remained for two years, preaching frequently in the 
churches, and employing himself in the publication of his father's 
commentary, and his own greatest work, the " Instructiones His- 
torico-Theologicae." In 1646, he obtained leave to return home, 
after which he lived in retirement at Corse, and died there '29th 
April 1648. He applied to the presbytery of Aberdeen, a short 
time before his death, for permission to lay his remains beside 
those of his wife and father, but this being refused, he was buried • 
in the church-yard of Leochel. The hardships which he under- 
went from the Covenanters were not the only misfortunes which 
fell to his lot. His lands of Corse were repeatedly plundered by 
the Highland caterans, and in 1638, they carried off his own cou-  
sin, threatening to put him to death unless ransomed at a heavy 
sum, and also to take his own life if he complained against them 
to king or council, or sought peace otherwise than by the payment 
of black-mail. On the face of the Hill of Corse, nearly opposite 
to the castle, there is still to be seen a small excavation, known as 
" the Laird's hiding-hole or chawmer," where he is said to have 
concealed himself on such occasions of danger. A collected edi- 
tion of his works was published at Amsterdam in 2 vols. fo. 1703, 
' with a copious memoir by Dr Garden ; and, in the words of Dr 
Irving, " his learning was such as to obtain the warm approbation 
of these eminent scholars, Vossius, Usher, Morhof, Ernesti, and 
Cave ; and to this it would be superfluous to add any other com- 
mendation." f It only remains to be stated, that " His Diary, or 
as he himself entitles it, Spiritual Exercises," in his own hand- 
writing, is still preserved at Fintray House. It extends from the 
3d of "February 1624 to the close of 1647. Its allusions to pub- 
lic events are not very numerous ; but it contains many interesting 
particulars of private history, outlines of sermons, expositions of 
pa'.sacres of Scripture, meditations and prayers, all characteristic of 
the varied learning and fervent piety of its author. It was included

in Dr Garden's edition of his works, but in a Latin dress, which 
much impairs, in many cases, its highly expressive phraseology. 

Alexander Irving of LeiitiirL— This gentleman was a lawyer of 
eminence, and the author of a treatise " De Jure Regni," publish- 
ed at Leyden in 1627, and again at Helmstadtin 1671, — a work 
which is held in good esteem. He died before 1641, when Robert 
Irving, his cousin-german, was served heir to him in the lands of 
Lenturk. 

Matthew Lumsden of Tilliecairn. — He was the brother of the 
Laird of Cushnie, the proprietor of Tilliecairn, in the parish of 
Clunie, where an old castle still stands, and the author of a " Ge- 
nealogical History of the House of Forbes," published with con- 
tinuations in 1819. He died the 27th June 1580. 

Andrew Lumbden. — This gentleman was private secretary to 
Prince Charles Edward ; and in an account of his family given by 
himself, and published in the Analecta Scotica, he traces his de- 
scent from the house of Cushnie. He is the author of " Remarks 
on the Antiquities of Rome and its Environs," Lond. 1797, 4to, 
— a work which called forth the praise of the learned Matthias, 
and is still in considerable estimation. Several interesting papers 
by Father Innes, author of the justly celebrated " Essay on the 
Ancient Inhabitants of Scotland," preserved in the hand-writing 
of Andrew Lumsden, with some notices of the life of that eminent 
antiquary, have been included in the last publication of the Spal- 
ding Club. Mr Lumsden died at Edinburgh on the 26th De- 
cember 1801, at the age of eighty-one. 

John Lumsden of Cushnie. — He was the second son of John 
Lumsden of Cushnie, and highly distinguished himself in the civil 
service of the East India Company, After filling various subor- 
dinate situations with great " credit and ability," he was called in 
1805 to be a member of the supreme council, an office which he 
held for seven years " with eminent advantage to the public ser- 
vice." When he embarked for Europe in 1813, after having serv- 
ed the Company for nearly thirty-six years, he obtained from the 
Governor- General, in a letter to the Directors, an honourable tes- 
timony to the " unsullied purity of his character both in public 
and private life, his official knowledge equally useful and exten- 
sive, and the ability with which he had discharged the functions of 
the different situations even the highest and most arduous in 
which he had been placed." In 1817, he became a candidate for

the directorship, to which office he was chosen ; and on that oc- 
casion, the Marquis Wellesley addressed to him a letter, in which 
he expressed himself in the highest terms of his talents and cha- 
racter, and the important public services he had performed in In- 
dia. By the death of his elder brother, Mr Lumsden succeeded 
to the family estate, and having died in London in December 1818, 
in the fifty-eighth year of his age, his only son, the Rev. Henry 
Thomas Lumsden, became proprietor, 

Dr Matthew Lumsden— was perhaps the most eminent 
person of his name. He was the youngest brother of John Lums- 
den of Cushnie, last mentioned, and having received his education 
at King's College, Aberdeen, also sought his fortunes in India. 
He turned his attention to the oriental languages, and became 
assistant Professor of Persian and Arabic in the College of Fort- 
William. In 1805, the fruit of his studies appeared in an elabo- 
rate " Persian Grammar," and, in 1808, he succeeded Captain 
Baillie as Persian and Arabic Professor. In 1810, he published 
a new edition of his Persian Grammar; in 1812, he was ap- 
pointed secretary to the Madressa, and superintendent of the 
various translations of English works into Persian, then in pro- 
gress ; in 1813, he published an Arabic Grammar, in two vols, 
folio in 1814, he received charge of the Company's press at 
Calcutta, which he retained for three years; and, in 1818, he 
added to all his other duties that of secretary to the Stationery 
committee. But his health failed under these multiplied labours, 
and a journey to his native country was deemed essential to his 
recovery. He travelled to England through Persia, Georgia, 
and Russia, and his health being improved, in 1821, he returned 
to India, and, in the early part of 1822, resumed the duties of 
his professorship in the College of Fort- William, and the super- 
intendence of the Calcutta Madressa. Having finally retired 
from public life, with the highest commendations from the Ma- 
dressa Committee and the Government of Bengal, he returned 
to England, and died at Tooting Common, Surrey, on the 31st 
of March 1835, in his fifty-eighth year. His own, and many 
other oriental works, in the publication of which he was concerned 
were presented by himself to the Library of King's College, 
where he and all his family were educated, and f.-om which, as a 
testimony of his high, acquirements, he received his degree oi

presented to the Library of King's College, a very remarkable 
roll, nearly twenty feet long, beautifully written in Sanscrit, and 
containing an account of the Hindoo mythology, with grotesque 
paintings of their gods. This is generally shown to visitors of the 
college, as one of the curiosities ; as well as another memorial 
of the Cushnie family, a complete suit of mail, said to have been 
worn by their ancestor at the battle of Harlaw in 1411. 

Parochial Registers. — These records amount to eleven volumes, 
as follow: 1. Register of baptisms, marriages, and burials of Leo- 
chel, from the 22d December 1657, to July 27, 1709. 2. Re- 
gister of discipline, collections, and debursements of Leochel, from 
23d November 1707, to 30th December 1739. 3. Register of 
baptisms of Leochel, from 4th June 1715, to 30th December 

1768. 4. Register of discipline, collections, and debursements of 
Leochel, from 6th January 1740, to 25th June 1768. 5. Re- 
gister of baptisms of Leochel and united parish, from 3d Sep- 
tember 1768, to 28th December 1829 ; and also of marriages, 
from 12th July 1769, to 7 th July 1806. 6. Register of collec- 
tions and debursements of Leochel, from 6th July 1768, to 27th 
July 180 J ; and also of marriages and deaths of united parish, — 
the former from 1st August 1813, and the latter from 21st Ja- 
nuary 1823, to the present time. 7. Register of discipline of 
Leochel, and minutes of session of united parish, from 8th Sep- 
tember 1782, to 10th April 1841. 8. Cash-book of united pa- 
rish, from 19th October 1798, to the present time. 9. Register 
of baptisms of united parish, from 15th January 1830, to present 
time. 10. Register of discipline, collections, distributions, and 
baptisms of Cushnie, from 25th April 1731, to 31st December 

1769. 11. Register of discipline, collections, distributions, and 
baptisms of Cushnie, from 7th January 1770, to 27th July 1801. 
No register of marriages or deaths in the old parish of Cushnie 
IS extant; and, except in a few cases, it is only since 1822, that 
the date of the births as well as of the baptisms has been entered. 

Antiquities — Cairns. — At one time these were numerous. Nine 
are specified in the former account of Leochel ; but in the pro- 
gress of cultivation and building, most of them have disappeared. 
A large one still remains, on the highest of several remarkable 
indentations, rising the one above the other, from the Mill of Brux 
towards the elevated ground of the farm of Corbanchory, and 
lookmg like the steps of a gigantic stair.

Roman Emperor Constantius, was ploughed up in a hitherto un- 
cultivated piece of ground on Mains of Cushnie, which was sold 
in Aberdeen ; and, in 1839, there was found, near the manse, a 
silver piece of James VI. in fine preservation, struck after the 

union of the crowns. 

Picts' i/owses.— Several of these subterraneous abodes are 
found on the farm of Cairncoullie. When first discovered, they 
contained a quantity of ashes, and fragments of half-burnt wood, 
clear indications of their having been once mhabited. Ihey are 
about five feet high and eight feet wide, and roofed with large 

flat stones. . . , ... 

Entrenchments on Hill of Corse.— ear the summit of this bill, 
there are two or three long trenches, with a considerable number 
of small tumuli beside them ; and on its south-eastern aspect, 
looking towards Milmad, in Lumphanan, there is a long earthen 
rampart with a ditch, facing a similar one, on the opposite brow 
of Milmad. Tradition connects these with the closing scenes ot 
Macbeth's career, whose cairn, marking the spot where he fell, is 
still to be seen, about a mile north from the church of Lumphanan 
Ancient Chapeh.-\t is stated in the " View of the Diocese of 
Aberdeen," that there was formerly a chapel at Lenturk. i here 
is now no trace of the building; but there is a spot still known as 
the " chapel croft," a little way south-east from the site ot the 
castle. A small bit of ground, on the farm of Corbanchory still 
untouched by the plough, and called the " Chapel Yard, was 
no doubt attached to another place of worship. The ruins ot a 
third, named " Terry Chapel," on the farm of Newton of Corse, 
are still distinguishable; and the good taste and feel mg ot bir 
John Forbes, the proprietor, have led him to enclose and plant 

'AlcLt Buildings.The Castle of Lenturk, the most ancient 
of these, was probably built by the Strachans, if it did not exist 
before their date. In Monipennies Brief Description of Scotland, 
appended to his Abridgement of the Chronicles, 1612, he enu- 
merates the castles of « Lenturk, Corsse, and Cragywar among 
the strongholds of " Marre." In the Old Account, in 1792 the 
Castle of Lenturk is described as in ruins, and ha'.ng a large 
deep broad fosse around it. The very ruins have now disappeared, 
and a farm-house occupies their site; but still a considerable por- 
tion of the circular fosse is distinctly visible. _ . , , ,

the inscription on the lintel over the Joor; wf. 1581. es. The 
initials are those of William Forbes, father of the bishop, and of 
his wife, Elizabeth Strachan. It is traditionally reported, that 
his former dwelling having been plundered in his absence by some 
Highland freebooters, he vowed, " If God spare ray life, I shall 
build a house, at which thieves will need to knock ere they enter." 
The castle has long been unroofed and ruinous, but a good part 
of the walls is still standing. 

Castle of Craigievar. — The Mortimers are said to have begun 
this building early in the seventeenth century; but the embar- 
rassed state of their affairs prevented them from completing it. 
William Forbes, who purchased the estate from them in 1610, 
carried it on, and finished it in 1626. It is still perfect, and af- 
fords one of the very finest specimens of the Flemish style of cas- 
tellated architecture. In 1826, Sir John Forbes, the present 
proprietor, expended L.600 in giving the castle a new roof of the 
best Memel timber ; and since that time, various internal im- 
provements have been made, all, however, in strict keeping with 
the original style, which render it a commodious residence for the 
family during the summer months. 

Mansion- Houses of Hall-head and Cushnie. — The former of 
these was built in 1688, and the latter in 1707 ; but having both 
been uninhabited for a considerable time, they are hastening to 
decay. 

Historical Incidents. — On the 26th August 1580, John Gor- 
don of Blelack and others carried off James Mortimer, " apperand 
of Craigievar, and detained him captive and prisoner in the wood 
of Kilblene for ten days," for which they were afterwards brought 
to trial. About 1590, Gradoch, a reputed witch in Coldstane, 
" took in hand to haif destroyit the Laird of Craigievar, his son, 
and utheris," for which, and many other like crimes, she suffered 
death. A few years after, in 1596-97, an active inquiry for 
witches was instituted all over this district. Commissioners at 
Aberdeen were appointed by his Majesty, for " tacking and ap- 
prehending of witches, sorceraris, consultaris, and traflfiquaris with 
witches," who directed precepts " to all and sindrie ministeris of 
Godis word, elderis, and deaconis," charging them " to convein 
and tak up dittay" against all suspected persons in their parishes ; 
" the quhilk persones being delaittit as said is," these commis- 
sioners could " do na less for the advancement of Godis glory,

and dounetliraw of the kingdome of sathan, then to put tham to . 
the knawledge of ane condigne assize/'f In 1620, William Ga- 
rioche, son of James Garioche of Kinstair, and Thomas Anderson 
in Awfurd, were tried for " carrying John Bonar, m TuUichethe, 
twa myles to the water of Lochell, and douking him dyverse tymes 
thairin, and compelling him to yield to the furnissmg of 500 
merks money." In February 1636, seven of the followers of 
Gilderoy, who were « notorious limmers, and did great oppressions 
in the lands of Corse, Craigievar, and other parts, were taken in 
Athol, by persuasion and advice of the Laird of Craigievar and 
Corse, and hanged altogether at the Cross of Edinburgh, and 
their heads cut off, and set up in exemplary places." In July 
after, their leader, " and five other limmers," shared the same 
fate ; and on the 8th August 1638, in revenge of Gilderoy's death, 
a band of freebooters " came to the Laird of Corse his bounds, 
and spulzied the ground, and Mr Thomas Forbes, minister at 
Lochell's House, and oppressed the King's lieges grievously, taking 
their horse, kine, and oxen, and causing the owners pay for theiq 
own gear." In April 1644, « the Laird of Craigievar takes to 
Craigievar, and transports his haiU victuals of Fintray to the 
place there, to be kept from plundering." In 1745, Harry Lums- 
den of Cushnie, George Gordon of Hallhead, and Jonathan For- 
bes of Brux, all took the side of Prince Charles. In July 1746, 
the Duke of Cumberland granted a lease during pleasure of the 
lands of Essilmont and Hallhead, belonging to George Gordon, to 
James Chalmers, printer in Aberdeen ; and his house in Aberdeen 
was plundered by the Duke and General Hawley.t

all the crofters in Corse were limited to a stack each, 8 feet broad, 12 long, and 5 
high, under a penalty of L.4 ; the kindling of fire in any moss was forbidden, under 
L. 20 ; and four tenants were fined L. 10 each for labouring moss-ground never 
laboured before. To the following offences, the following punishments were 
awarded : Louping and breaking down park dikes, a fine of 40s. totiea qtioties ; 
applying to any other judicatory than the laird's court, " where they will get 
reason," L.20; breaking and destroying young trees in the churchyard of Lochell, 
one merk for each tree ; letting cattle into mosses and breaking peats, 40s. ; beating, 
bruising, blooding and wounding, L. 50 ; making a ply betwixt families, L. 50 
to the laird, L.5 of assythment to the party injured, and the party offending 
bound to keep the peace in L.lOO ; giving opprobrious language, L.IO, and to satisfy 
the party offended, or be put in the stocks ; putting fire to a neighbour's door, and 
calling his wife and mother witches, L.lOO ; a man for blooding and wounding, and 
preventing all peace where he lives, is ordained to flit, red, and remove himself, his 
haill goods and gear, wife, children, and all that belongs to him, out of the lands of 
Craigievar and Corse within seven days ; another for abusing the minister, and cal- 
ling hirn a liar, and saying in the church-yard that he would prove him a liar, is put 
in the stocks during the baillie's pleasure ; two neighbours, betwixt whom there are 
strifes, which cannot be accommodated, are obliged to cast lots, and the one on whom 
the lot falls to flitt at the next Whitsunday 1725 ; the same year, a man for offering 
a charged gun to shoot the oflcer, when warning him to do his master's lawful or- 
ders, is amerciate in L.5 Sterling for keeping and wearing a gun contrary to act of 
Parliament, and L.4 Scots for his contumacy and disobedience; and, in 1736, a 
man for " dading" another man's wife to the ground, blooding her at the nose, and 
taking up her clothes and belting her, is fined L.50, and L.4 to the husband and 
wife for the indignity. By far the most common of these offences is that of beating, 
blooding, and wounding. The two stations where the court met were the Hall of 
Craigievar, and Briggs of Leochel. The oSicials were the baillie, clerk, procurator- 
fiscal, ofl[5cer, and dempster. 



1126 ABEUDEENSHIRE. 

Craigievar, now almost exhausted, ihe wood is of recent plantation, 
the greater part, indeed, within the last twenty years. It consists 
mostly of larch and Scots fir. The larches in many places are j 
failing, but the firs are vigorous. 

Rent of Land— The average rent may be stated at 15s. per 
acre imperial. This would give a real rental of about L.4000, 
which is believed to be very near the truth. The period of lease 
is now uniformly nineteen years. 

Husbandry, c. — What is called the seven-shift rotation is gene- 
rally in use, but the six-shift is now recommended by some compe- 
tent authorities, and partially adopted. The soil and climate are 
well adapted for grass and turnips, but not so favourable for grain, 
especially in late seasons. Very few sheep are now kept, and the 
Aberdeenshire horned or polled breed of black cattle is that ge- 
nerally reared. 

Farm-Steadings, c— These have been very much improved of  
late years. There are four meal-mills in the parish, and one carding j 
and spinning-mill, where woollen fabrics for blankets, plaids, &amp;c. i 
are manufactured to a small extent. There are now 45 thrashing- 
mills in the parish ; nineteen driven by water, and twenty-six by | 
horses. The ploughs are all drawn by two horses or two oxen ; j 
and of the former there are 104 ; of the latter, 18. \ 

Recent Improvements. — It may be safely asserted that no parish j 
in Aberdeenshire has of late made more rapid advances in every \ 
branch of agricultural improvement. It is equally certain, that Sir 
John Forbes, Bart, of Craigievar, who, on the death of his brother 
Sir Arthur in 1823, succeeded to the family honours and estates, 
has been the mainspring of the improvements effected. Sir John 
is truly a model of a country gentleman. The Rev. Mr Lumsden 
of Cushnie has, for several years, paid us an annual visit, and 
shown himself anxious to encourage his tenants in improving their 
farms. William M'Combie, Esq. of Lenturk, has lately got the 
mains or home-farm into his own possession, and, by beginning to 
plant and furrow-drain, has already given a sample of those exten- 
sive and tasteful improvements by which he has so much embel- 
lished his beautiful seat of Easter Skene. About 700 acres of bar 
ren ground have been reclaimed within the last thirty years.

Ma7mfactures.— At the carding-mill already mentioned, plaids,

rable number of women, chiefly of the aged and poorer class, em- 
ploy themselves in knitting stockings from worsted, furnished to 
them by the Messrs Hadden in Aberdeen, and thereby earn an- 
nually from L.70 to L.IOO. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-7 own.— Ahevdeen, the county town, though not quite 
so near as Kintore and Inverury, is the market, to which almost 
all the produce is carried ; and the carts generally return laden 
with lime or coals. The distance is twenty-eight miles from the 
centre of the parish. There is a pretty good commutation road of 
about six miles, which joins the Alford turnpike at Whiteley, in 
the parish of Tough. The Government road from Donside to Dee- 
side, the best road in the district, intersects the lower part of the 
parish, running along the western bank of the Leochel for about 
three miles ; and the Tarland turnpike passes for about two miles 
through the southern border of the lands of Corse. The bridges 
on these and the other roads in the parish are generally in good 
repair, with the exception of that over the Leochel at Scuttrie, on 
the Whiteley road, which was carried away by the flood of 1839. 
The nearest post-offices are Alford on the north-east, and Tarland 
on the south-west, each six miles distant from the centre of the 
parish. 

Ecclesiastical History.— The old church of Leochel was dedi- 
cated to St Marnan, that of Cushnie to St Bride. Marnoch 
fair, at the kirk-town of Leochel, was long held on the first Tues- 
day of March, and the small farm adjacent to the old church of 
Cushnie is still named Bride's Well. The sites of both the old 
churches were, according to tradition, supernaturally pointed out. 
Portions of the walls of the old churches are still standing ; no 
date is visible at Leochel, but at Cushnie the date 1 637 is to be 
seen, and on a broken stone, 14 — , indicating an erection in the 
fifteenth century. For some time after the Reformation, there 
were only readers at Leochel and Cushnie as spiritual instructors 
'of the people. In 1576, the reader of Leochel had a stipend of 
L. 16, with the kirk land, and in 1593, Mr Gilbert Brown was 
reader there. In 1567, Mr James Patersoun was reader of Cush-

nie, with a salary of L. 20. In 1618, the parishes of Leochel and 
Cushnie were united by a decreet of the Lords of Plat, and the t 
tacksmen of the teinds were ordained to build a centrical church  
at Culmellie, and provide a manse and glebe, on the condition, 
that, if this was not done within three years, the union should not 
take effect. Accordingly, the condition was not fulfilled, and by 
the exertions of Bishop Patrick Forbes, about 1 621 , the union 
was dissolved, and the churches separately planted with ministers. 
It is highly probable that the annexation of the lands of Corse 
quoad sacra to Leochel took place at this time. 

In 1793, a process of annexation of the parishes of Leochel and 
Cushnie was raised by the heritors. The people of Leochel seem 
to have been passive, but those of Cushnie, with their minister, 
and a party in the presbytery, strenuously opposed the measure. 
But, notwithstanding this opposition, decreet of annexation was 
passed by the Court of Teinds on the 28th January 1795, and two 
years after the centrical church was built.

• Mr Seatoun and his contemporary, Mr Copland at Cushnie, were both of Epis- 
copal principles. 

■j- Mr Orem was settled in opposition to the wishes of the great majority of the 
people, who carried the case to the Assembly ; but as they themselves candidly ac- 
knowledge, in their answers to the reasons of transportation, this was entirely "ow- 
ing to the groundless stories and false reports which they had heard concerning hini," 
he was " but a short time settled among them when they were perfectly reconciled 
to him ;" and they declare, that the people of Forbes and Kearn " neither are nor 
can be more harmonious and united in seeldng him from them, than they all and 
every one of them are to have him who is so universally acceptable to all concerned, 
heritors, elders, and people, continued fixed pastor amongst them." Mr Oreni and 
his immediate predecessor, Mr Bidie, are still remembered in Cushnie as two of the 
' best ministers" whom the parish ever enjoyed.

a Mr George Anderson, ordained 21st August 1805, died 23d

ordained and admitted 3d January 1839. 

Present Ecclesiastical State.— The present church and manse 
were built in 1797-98, in a new and centrical situation for the 
united parish. They do not seem to have been very substantially 
executed, and are now in a state of very considerable disrepair. 
The church was built to hold 500, but, notwithstanding some 
temporary expedients to obtain additional sittings, is too small for 
the congregation. The glebe, obtained in excambibn for the two 
old glebes, including the site of the manse and offices, consists of 
19 acres, 33 falls Scotch, and may be worth L.18 a-year. The 
stipend, by decreet of locality in 1829, which exhausts the teinds, 
is L. 140, 7s. 3d,, 79 bolls, 1 firlot, 1 peck, and 2 lippies oat- 
meal at 8 stones ; and 2 bolls, 3 firlots, and i lippy bear, Aber- 
deenshire measure ; with L.4, 16s. 2d., consisting of a payment of 
50 merks, and the conversion of certain services paid by immemo- 
rial usage by the proprietors and tenants of Corse. The average 
amount of the whole in money, at the fiars prices, for the years 
1839-41, is L.209, 17s. Sd. The Bishop of Dunblane presented 
Mr Alexander Seaton to Leochel in 1683. Sir William Forbes 
presented Mr Thomas Reid in 1717; and since that time the 
Craigievar family have exercised the patronage of Leochel. In 
1727, the Earl of Rothes was patron of Cushnie, and presented Mr 
Francis Adam in 1745. In 1762, the patronage of Cushnie was 
acquired by John Lumsden of Cushnie, and has continued in his 
family since. Sir John Forbes, Bart., and the Rev. Henry Tho- 
mas Lumsden, as patrons of the respective old parishes, are alter- 
nate patrons of the united parish. 

Nearly at the eastern border of the parish there is a chapel, in 
connection with the United Associate Synod. The emoluments 
of the clergyman are L.60, a house, and five acres of land, paid 
by the hearers. Six or seven families in the parish attend this 



113a 



ABERDEENSHIRE. 



chapel ; and there are besides, 3 Independents and 1 Baptist, 
No other Dissenters are known. 

The number of families worshipping at the parish church is 
244, and Divine service is remarkably well attended. The num- 
ber of communicants for some years has been about 700. Col- 
lections are annually made for the Aberdeen Infirmary, Pauper 
Lunatic Fund of the Presbytery of Alford, and the General As- 
sembly's schemes, to the amount of L.I2 to L.14. 

Education. — The parish is well supplied with the means of edu- 
cation. There are five schools, two parochial, one in connection 
with the General Assembly's Education scheme, and two endow- 
ed. Each of the parochial teachers has the minimum salary, 
and legal accommodations of house and garden, with an allowance 
from the Dick bequest of about L. 30, and the fees may average 
from L. 12 to L. 15. The school situated near the old manse of 
Leochel, with a comfortable school-house, was built by Sir Charles 
Forbes, Bart, of New and Edinglassie, who, for several years, al- 
lowed to the teacher a salary of L. 20. The salary was withdrawn 
in 1837, but the late Charles and Peter Ritchie, in Wester Leochel, 
have since bequeathed L. 300, the interest of which is to be given 
to the teacher of this school, and another benevolent person con- 
templates a bequest of L. 200 for the same purpose. Sir John 
Forbes allows him a garden, and the fees may average from L. 10 
to L. 12. Another school is situated in the eastern district of the 
parish, and was endowed by the late Peter M'Combie, Esq. of 
Lenturk. The emoluments of the teacher are, a commodious 
house, garden, half-an acre of land, and a salary of L. 20. The 
fees may yield from L. 10 to L. 12 annually. 

Libraries. — There are two small parochial libraries, one be- 
longing to each of the old parishes, and consisting chiefly of reli- 
gious works. 

Poor. — The following table shows the state of the poor for six 
years :

Benefactions. — About 1730, Charles Gordon of Hallhead mor- 
tified 1000 merks Scots for the poor of Cushnie. In 1735, Dame 
Margaret Rose, Lady Dowager of Craigievar, mortified 1000

merks for " depauperated tenants and their widows" on her son's 
lands of Craigievar and Corse ; and since her death in 1742, four 
bolls of meal have been distributed annually as the interest of this 
bequest. In 1761, John M'William, in Briggs of Leochel, mor- 
tified 500 merks for the poor of Leochel. In 1812, Sir Charles 
Forbes, Bart, gave L.lOO to the poor of the united parish, and, 
since 1816, has continued an annual donation of L.IO, amounting 
in whole to L.270. In 1827, Miss Anna Forbes, sister of Sir 
Charles, left L.lOO to the poor of Leochel and Corse. In 183-3, 
Peter M'Combie, Esq. of Lenturk, left L.lOO to the poor of the 
united parish. In 1841, Major Mitchell, whose first wife was 
another sister of Sir Charles Forbes, left L.200 to the poor of 
Leochel, payable after the death of his second wife : and, in 1842, 
Peter Ritchie, in Wester Leochel, left L.lOO, the interest of 
which is to be applied to purchase meal for the poor on the lands 
of Craigievar and Corse. In addition, there have been received 
from the fund of Mr Burnett of Dens, in 1809, L.25 ; in 1824, 
L.20; in 1834, L.24 ; and, in 1842, L.39, making a total of 
L.108. It is also proper to state, that much charity is given in 
private. 

Fairs, — Five of these are annually held in the parish, in the 
months of April, May, July, August, and September, at a con- 
venient station on a moor near Scuttrie, on the Craigievar estate. 
They are well frequented, and a considerable amount of business 
is done in cattle, horses, sheep, and wool. 

Inns, — There is but one regular inn in the parish, excluding 
Corse, where there are other two. 

Fuel, — The mosses in the parish are nearly exhausted ; and 
peat and turf are procured at a great expense of time and labour; 
the latter chiefly from the Red-hill of Lumphanan and the Glen 
of Cushnie, both distant, and of difficult access. In consequence 
coals from Aberdeen are more and more used. They cost from 
8s. to 10s. per boll, including the price of carriage. 

In preparing this account, the writer was much indebted to the unrestricted 
access which he had to the extensive and valuable series of charters and documents 
in possession of Sir .John Forbes at Fintray House ; to a short accountof Leochel and 
Cushnie, privately printed by Joseph Robertson, Esq., author of the " Book of Bon- 
Accord ;" and to communications, both written and oral, from William M'Combie, 
Esq. of Lenturk ; Messrs Lumsden, Advocates in Aberdeen, factors on the Cushnie 
property ; Mr George Strachan, factor to Sir John F'orbes ; Mr William M'Combie at 
Tillyfour House ; Mr Andrew Ross TarJand, tactor on the Hallhead estate; and Rlr 
John Gray in Ley of Cushnie.

Account of the University and King's College of 

Aberdeen. 



There appears to have existed in Old Aberdeen, from a very 
early period, a Studium Generale, or University, attached to the 
Episcopal Chapter of the See of Aberdeen. It is said to have 
been founded in 1157 by Edward, Bishop of Aberdeen, and al- 
though, accordincj to Boece, it still existed at the period when 
King's College was founded, it is probable that it had in some way 
xeased to answer the purposes which it must have been designed 
to serve, since King James IV., in his letter to Pope Alexander 
VI., requesting him to found a University in Old Aberdeen, men- 
tions as the chief motive for the undertaking, the profound igno- 
rance of the inhabitants of the north of Scotland, and the great 
deficiency of properly educated men to fill the clerical office in that 
part of his kingdom. 

Foundation of the University. — In 1494, William Elphinston, 
Bishop of Aberdeen, and Chancellor of Scotland under James 
III., persuaded James IV. to make the above application to the 
Pope, who was then considered the only source of the universal 
privileges which were desired for the projected institution, the 
power of the king extending only to his own dominions, while that 
of the Roman pontiff embraced the whole of Christendom. The 
result of this application was a Bull dated 10th February 1494, in- 
stituting a University in Old Aberdeen or Aberdon, which was to 
include every lawful faculty, namely, those of Theology, Canon 
and Civil Law, Medicine, and the Liberal Arts. Masters were 
appointed to read in all the faculties, and were empowered speci- 
• ficaliy to confer all the lawful degrees of Baccalaureate Master 
and Doctor, in like manner as these degrees are granted in any 
the most highly privileged University. It was also provided in 
this Bull, that the degrees thus conferred should carry with them 
all the usual privileges and immunities that are attached to such 
degrees in other Universities ; and that, not only within the Uni- 
versity itself, but in all other Universities, uhique terrarum, with- 
out further examination of the graduates. It is particularly men- 
tioned, that the University of Aberdeen was to possess all the pri- 
vileges enjoyed by those of Paris and Bologna, two of the most 
highly favoured in Europe. This Bull of institution has been

printed in the Report of the University Commission of 1826, along 
- with all the charters of King's College, and may be referred to by 
those who wish to ascertain the precise terms in which the very 
ample privileges of King's College were conferred. By a mandate 
dated on the same day, but not executed till 1496, Bishop Elphin- 
ston, with two coadjudators, was directed to publish the Bull, to 
defend and protect the doctors, masters, and scholars in all their 
immunities, &amp;c., and to cause the statutes to be inviolably observ- 
ed. By a second Bull dated in 1495, the Pope annexed to the 
University the church of Aberbulhnot, now Marykirk, and the re- 
venues of the Hospital of St Gerraains in Lothian. 

King James IV., by a charter of confirmation dated 22d May 
1497, ratified all the enactments of the papal Bull, and empower- 
ed Bishop Elphinston to found a college within the University. 

Accordingly, the bishop in 1505 published what is called the 
first foundation of the college, which was confirmed by a Bull of 
Pope Julius II. in 1506. By this deed he formed and endowed 
a college, to be called that of Sancta Maria in Nativitate. The 
members were thirty-six in number ; but by a second foundation, 
prepared by Bishop Elphinston during his life, but published after 
having been proved by Bishop Gavin Dunbar in 1531, seventeen 
years after the death of Elphinston, the number was raised to 
forty-two ; namely, four doctors in the faculties of Theology, Ca- 
non Law, Civil Law, and Medicine, the first to be Principal of 
the College ; eight Masters in Arts, the first to be Sub-Principal, 
the second Grammarian, and the other six Students in Theology; 
three Students of Law ; all the above, except the Mediciner, to 
be ecclesiastics ; thirteen poor scholars ; eight prebends for the 
service of the College church, the first to be cantor, the second 
sacrist, and six singing boys. 

Such is a brief sketch of the original constitution of the College, 
which has been repeatedly and fully confirmed by numerous Papal 
Bulls, royal charters, and Acts of Parliament. The mode of 
election, salaries, and duties of all the members are minutely de- 
tailed in the two foundations published by Bishop Dunbar in the 
form of a solemn instrument, and which are printed in the Com- 
missioners' Report above referred to. These important documents, 
especially the second foundation, have always been considered as 
the binding laws of the University ; but although, up to the pe - 
riod of the Reformation in Scotland, they were literally obeyed, 
the change which then took place in religious matters rendered it 



UNIVERSITY AND KING's COLLEGE.

impossible subsequently to pursue the same course. All those of- 
fices, therefore, which were only intended for the better perfor- 
mance of divine service after the Romish form were either from 
time to time abolished, or fell into disuse; till at last the univer- 
sity assumed the present form, consisting of ten members of sena- 
tus or masters, besides the chancellor, the rector, and his asses- 
sors. 

Bishop Elphinston liberally endowed the university during his 
life, and at his death left to it the sum of L.l 0,000 Scots, — in those 
days a very large sum of money. He also provided all the mem- 
bers with manses either in the college or close to it. He built, 
about the time of the first foundation, the original handsome fa- 
bric, of which a considerable part yet remains. But in the pro- 
gress of the Reformation, and especially at the period of the abo- 
lition of Episcopacy in Scotland, the greater part of the funds of 
the university, which chiefly consisted of ecclesiastical property 
and tithes, was alienated, and what remained was so much dimi- 
nished by various causes, especially by the augmentation of minis- 
ters' stipends out of the tithes belonging to King' College, that, 
at the beginning of the last century, the university funds were in 
a most miserable condition. They have since been somewhat im- 
proved, partly by a sale of certain superiorities belonging to the 
college, which produced about L. 3000 Sterling, partly by grants 
from the Crown in aid of the masters' salaries. This statement 
refers to the property belonging to the college itself. But the 
members are also trustees of a large amount of property, bequeath- 
ed at various periods by benevolent persons, for the foundation of 
bursaries or scholarships, of which the number attached to King's 
College is now very large. 

In this slight sketch of the history of King's College, it is ne- 
cessary to mention that King Charles I. in 1641, after the aboli- 
tion of Episcopacy in Scotland, granted a charter incorporating 
this University with the Marischal College of New Aberdeen un- 
der the name of the Caroline University. This charter was rati- 
fied by Parliament in the same year, and confirmed by Cromwell 
in 1654; and the union continued till after the Restoration ; but 
Charles H., when he re-established Episcopacy, rescinded all the 
acts passed from 1640 to 1648, by which means the union was an- 
nulled, and the two colleges have ever since continued distinct and 
independent. At different periods during the last centiu"y, namely, 
in 1747, 17.54, 1770, 1786, and still more recently within the last 



1142 



ABERDEENSHIRE. 



ten years, attempts have been made in different quarters to effect 
a union of the two colleges. The advocates of this measure were 
few in number, and in general interested parties, the pubhc hav- 
ing on all occasions expressed a determined hostility to every 
scheme of union. 

Our space will not permit us to enter into a detailed account of 
the various changes to which the university was subjected during 
the troubled period from the Reformation to the Revolution. We 
must here observe, however, that King's College, since its foun- 
dation, has never ceased actively to perform its proper functions, 
whether in the education of youth or in the conferring of degrees ; 
and that it has generally been in a flourishing condition, a proof of 
the necessity of the institution, and of the wisdom of its founder. 
It can boast, moreover, of a very large number of distinguished 
names both among its office-bearers and its alumni at all periods 
of its existence. 

We shall now briefly describe the present constitution of the 
university, the nature of its offices, and the system of education 
pursued in it; and we shall conclude by mentioning those bene- 
factors who have so greatly contributed to its usefulness, and those 
alumni who have distinguished themselves. 

Office- Bearers.— The office-bearers of King's College are, the 
Chancellor, the Rector, with four Assessors, ten Masters, including 
the Principal and Sub-Principal, and the factor or Procurator. 
The Chancellor is the supreme authority in the University, and 
an appeal lies to him from the Rectoral Court. 

During the Roman Catholic and Episcopal periods, the Bishop 
of Aberdeen was, ex officio, chancellor. Bishop Elphinston was the 
first chancellor, and among his successors may be named Bishop Ga- 
vin Dunbar and Bishop Patrick Forbes, the former of whom may be 
called the second founder of the University, and the latter of whom 
was one of its greatest benefactors ; also. Bishop Scougall, and 
George, Marquis of Huntly, who was Chancellor of the Caroline 
or United University. The present Chancellor is the Right Ho- 
nourable George Earl of Aberdeen, who succeeded the late Alex- 
ander Duke of°Gordon. The Chancellor is elected by the Sena- 
tus, and retains his office for life. He admits to certain offices in the 
College, and if any vacancy be not filled up within a month, he 
presents to the vacant office, jwre ceuf/Mio. 

The Rector is next in authority to the Chancellor. He is elected 



UNIVERSITY AND KING's COLLEGE. 



1143 



annually by the Senatus, along with four Assessors. An appeal 
may be made from the decision of the Senatus to the Rector and 
Assessors. It is his duty to visit the College, and to correct what 
may be found amiss. Among those who have been Rectors may 
be mentioned Dr John Forbes, son of Bishop Forbes, a man of 
great learning; Dr William Guild, Sir William Forbes of Craigie- 
var, and Sir John Macpherson. The present Rector is the Right 
Honourable Lord Francis Egerton, M.P. 

, By the foundation, the Doctor of Theology was to be Principal 
of the College, and, with the aid of the six students of theology 
to teach divinity. When, at a later period, the students of theolo- 
gy were reduced in number, and made Regents, or Masters in Phi- 
losophy, the duty of teaching divinity devolved on the Principal 
alone. But, after the foundation of the Professorship of Divinity, 
the Principal gradually ceased to act as a teacher, and since 1730 
or 1740 has not performed this duty. Of late years, an attempt 
has been made by the late Chancellor, Alexander Duke of Gor- 
don, aided by the then Rector, Lord Aberdeen, and his Assessors, 
and supported by a majority of the Senatus, to restore efficiency 
to this branch of the Principal's duties ; but nothing has yet been 
done. The remaining duties of the Principal are, to preside at 
college meetings, to confer degrees in the various faculties, and 
generally to govern {regere et gubernare the college. Originally, 
the salary of the Principal was the largest in the College. It now 
consists of about L.llO, derived from royal grants, bestowed on 
the college in compensation of the losses sustained by the various 
causes above alluded to ; of L.35 of fixed money salary from the 
college property ; of victual salary, varying with the fiars of grain, 
and amounting to from L.80 to L.90 ; and lastly, of one-tenth 
part of the balances, namely, that of the procuration account or 
college revenue, which balance is very variable ; and that of the 
account of money derived from the sale of superiorities, which is 
kept separate, tmder the name of the superiority fund, and which 
varies little, the tenth part averaging about L.23. The Principal's 
salary for 1836 amounted to L.300. He has also a house and 
garden. 

The first Principal of King's College was the celebrated Hec- 
tor Boece, who was invited from Paris, where he was Professor of 
Philosophy, by his friend. Bishop Elphinston. The most dis- 
tinguished of his successors in office were Alexander Anderson, 
Alexander Arbuthnot, Dr William Leslie Dr William Guild, 



1144 



ABEIIDEENSHIKE. 



Alexander Middleton, and his son, Dr George Middleton, George 
Chalmers, and the late Dr Roderick Macleod. The present Prin- 
cipal is Dr William Jack. 

The office of sub-principal is peculiar to thisuniversity, and is 
held by one of the Regents, who, in addition to his duties as Pro- 
fessor, must supply the place of the Principal in his absence. The 
first Sub-Principal was WilUam Hay, who accompanied Boece 
from Paris, where he had also taught Philosophy. A large pro- 
portion of the Principals have passed through the office of Sub- 
Principal. 

There is no salary attached to the office, but there is a house 
and glebe which belongs of right to that Regent who may be Sub- 
Principal. 

Originally, each of the Regents carried his own class of students 
through all the branches of philosophy in the curriculum of arts, 
and this system continued till a comparatively recent period. But, 
at present, each Regent confines himself to one subject, out of the 
four principal courses in arts, namely, Greek, Mathematics, Na- 
tural Philosophy, and Moral Philosophy. 

The present Sub-Principal is Dr Hugh Macpherson, who is 
also Professor of Greek. The salary of this chair is made up of 
L.80, 15s. from Royal grants, of fixed money, and victual sala- 
ries ; and of his share, one-tenth of the balances above described. 
From all these sources, it amounted in 1836 to L.220 ; to which 
IS to be added the amounl of fees from students attending the 
Greek class, which in 1836 was L.250, but has diminished consi- 
derably since that time. In the above salary is included about L.20 
derived from the Sub-Principal's share of a glebe or College croft. 

The first Regent is at present Mr John TuUoc.h, A.M., Pro- 
fessor of Mathematics. The salary of this chair, derived from 
sources similar to those above-described, amounted in 1836 to 
about L.195, and the class-fees to about L.150. He has a house 
and garden close to the College, with a share of the College croft, 
the latter included in the above salary. 

The third Regent, at present, is Dr John Fleming, Professor 
of Natural Philosophy. The salary of this chair in 1836 was about 
L.195, the class-fees about L.160. This Professor likewise has 
a house and garden, with a share of the College croft, the latter 
being included in the salary. 

 Dr George Middleton was the father of Sir Charles Middleton, first Lord 
Bar ham. , 



UNIVERSITY AND king's COLLEGE. 



1145 



The present second Regent is Mr Hercules Scott, A. M,, Pro- 
fessor of Moral Philosophy. His salary, including his share of 
College croft, was, in 1836, about L.195, and the class-fees in that 
year amounted to L.180, including the fees for graduation in Arts. 
To this regent belongs a house in the College, where he alone of 
all the members now resides, and a garden. 

The Humanist or Professor of Humanity is not one of the Re- 
gents, and his course was formerly not included in the curriculum 
of Arts, Latin being in those days more or less completely taught 
at school, and Greek being left for college study. For a long time 
past, however, Latin has formed an essential part of the curricu- 
lum. The Humanist is the Grammarian of the original founda- 
tion, and this office has been held by many men of great learning. 
The first was John Vans, and among his successors was Andrew 
Cant. Of late years, Mr Thomas Gordon and Mr William Ogil- 
vy have held this chair with great credit. The present Professor 
is Dr Patrick Forbes, one of the ministers of the parish of Old 
Ma char. 

The salary of this chair, in 1836, amounted to about L.210, and 
the class-fees to nearly L, 240. The Professor has a house and 
garden. 

It ought here to be mentioned, that Dr Forbes for a long pe- 
riod officiated as Lecturer on Chemistry and Natural History, in 
addition to his other duties, and that attendance on these lectures 
was rendered imperative, as it now continues, on candidates for 
the degree of A.M.; a circumstance without a parallel in any 
other British university. The class of chemistry has been found 
to excite considerable interest among the students, and must be 
considered as a most important and valuable addition to the cur- 
riculum in arts. At the commencement of the session of 1840- 
41, Dr Forbes relinquished this part of his duties, some additions 
being at the same time made to the amount of Latin in the cur. 
riculum ; and since that time chemistry has been taught by the 
present Professor of Medicine. 

The original foundation contained a Canonist or Professor of 
the Canon Law, and a Civilist or Professor of the Civil Law, 
The former office was abolished at the Reformation, but the lat- 
ter continues to exist. Among the holders of the former office 
must be mentioned John Lesley, afterwards Bishop of Ross, so 
celebrated for his fidelity to Queen Mary. A portrait of this 
prelate adorns the common hall of the university. AmonT tlie

civilists were George Nicolson, Lord Kemnay, James Scougall, 
Lord Whiteliill, and David Dalrymple, Lord Westhall, all three 
Judges of the Court of Session. 

. The salary of this chair, in 1836, amounted to about L.200. 
The fees are quite trifling. Indeed, the chair was long a sine- 
cure, but of late has been rendered efi'ective. The present civilist 
is Dr Patrick Davidson, who lectures once a-week during the 
winter session, without exacting any fee. The civilist derives a 
small and very uncertain emolument from the degrees of LL. D. 
occasionally conferred by the University. He has no house, but 
enjoys the rent of a small glebe. 

The Mediciner or Professor of Medicine was the only master 
on the original foundation who was not an ecclesiastic. Both 
Bishop Elphinston and King James IV, took great interest in 
medicine, in which the King was even a proficient. The first 
mediciner was Dr James Cuming, a man of great learning in his 
profession. Among his successors were Dr James Gregory son 
of James Gregory, Professor of Mathematics in Marischal Col- 
lege, and afterwards in Edinburgh, inventor of the Gregorian or 
reflecting telescope, and his two sons, James and John, the latter 
of whom becaiTie Professor of the Theory and Practice of Medi- 
cine in Edinburgh, and wrote " A Father's Legacy to his Daugh- 
ters," and other works. This Dr John Gregory made repeated 
efforts to establish permanent medical lectures in Aberdeen, but 
failed, from the theu limited number of medical students. More 
recently, a joint medical school was established, conducted by the 
Professors of Medicine in King's and Marischal Colleges, assisted 
by lecturers on the various branches of medical science, to be no- 
minated alternately by the two colleges. Before 1839, however, 
this joint school ceased to exist; and since that period, the Uni- 
versity has established an independent school of medicine, in 
which all the branches of medical study are taught by the present 
mediciner and eight lecturers, appointed by the Senatus. This 
school is flourishing, and a convenient building for the lecturers 
has just been erected by subscription. 

The salary of the Mediciner, in 1836, amounted to about 
L.210. The class-fees and fees for graduation of which latter 
a part accrues to the Mediciner, as Promoter to the degree of 
M. D., have amounted, since 1839, on an average, to about 
L.lOO more. There is a house and garden attached to the chair. 

The present Mediciner is Dr William Gregory, grandson of 



UNIVERSITY AND KING's COLLEGE. 



1147 



the Dr John Gregory above-mentioned. He lectures on chemis- 
try, the other branches of medicine being taught by the lecturers. 
He also conducts the examinations for medical degrees, with the 
aid of three assessors, appointed by the Senatus from among the 
medical lecturers attached to the University. 

Professor of Divinity. — This Professorship, as already stated, 
was not in the original foundation, which entrusted the teaching 
of theology to the Principal and six students. When these lat- 
ter were converted into three Regents in Philosophy, the Senatus, 
aided by contributions from the Bishop and clergy of the diocese, 
founded this chair, the patronage of which was vested, by royal 
charter, dated 1642, in the Synod of Aberdeen, with the Princi- 
pal and two other members of the University. The fund sub- 
scribed was invested in lands, which were afterwards feued by the 
synod to the college for the benefit of the professor. 

The salary of this chair is now the largest in the university, 
being composed of L, 265 from various royal grants ; of the inte- 
rest of two sums of L. 106 and L. 300, the former originally be- 
longing to the chair, the latter bequeathed by Miss Teresa Lums- 
den; of a fixed money salary from the College of L.21, 15s.; of 
a victual salary, about L. 60 ; and of his share of the procuration 
and superiority balances. In 1836, the whole amounted to L.425. 
It is to be observed, however, that this includes a royal grant of 
L. 150, given to the present incumbent at his appointment, and 
not secured to the chair beyond his life. There are no fees at- 
tached to this chair. The professor has a house and garden. 

This chair has been filled by many distinguished men, among 
whom may be mentioned Mr William Douglas 1644, author of 
several works; Mr Henry Scougall, son of Bishop Scougall, well 
known by his theological writings, who was made Professor as soon 
as he had completed his studies at the University, and who died 
at twenty-eight ; Dr Alexander Gerard, and Dr Gilbert Gerard, 
both men of high eminence in the literary world. 
- The present incumbent is the Rev. Dr Duncan Mearns, at one 
time Moderator of the General Assembly. 

Professor of Oriental Languages. — This chair was founded about 
1674, at the request of Bishop Scougall. The salary is the small- 
est in the college. It is chiefly made up of royal grants, with the 
■balances of the college accounts. In 1836, it amounted to about 
L.195, and the class-fees in that year to about L.45. No house 
is attached to this chair.

The present Professor is Mr James Bentley, A. M. 

The students are divided into students of arts and students of 
divinity. Most of the latter have previously obtained the degree 
of A. M., or, if not, have attended the necessary courses, and may 
obtain the degree when they require it. 

The curriculum of study for the degree of A. M. occupies four 
winter sessions, each of five months' duration, viz. from the first 
Monday of November to the last Friday of March. 

The students of the first year constitute the first class, or Ba- 
jans. They attend Greek about three hours a-day, and Latin 
one hour or one hour and a-half. 

In the second year, they form the second or senior-class. In 
this they attend mathematics, the second or advanced Greek and 
Latin, and chemistry. The latter class, however, may be attended 
during any year but the first. 

In "the third year, the students form the third or tertian class, 
in which they attend Natural Philosophy, the second Greek and 
Latin, and Chemistry, if they choose to take that class in this year. 

In the fourth year, the students constitute the Magistrand or 
fourth class, attending Moral Philosophy and Logic, the second 
Greek and Latin ; and, if not previously attended, the Chemistry. 

The second or advanced mathematical class may be attended 
either in the third or fourth year. 

The Professor of Moral Philosophy graduates his class, that is, 
such of them as desire the degree of A. M., at the close of each 

session. . 

The number of students in Arts in the first class varies from 50 
to 80 • in the second, from 40 to 70 ; in the third, from -35 to 50 ; 
and in the fourth, from 35 to 45. This progressive dimmution 
arises from the circumstance, that many leave the university to 
enter on professions before completing the course. The number 
of students attending the chemistry varies from 40 to 70, includ- f 
in. a certain number of medical students, and of others who at- 

tend this class alone. . , u • . 

In all of these classes frequent examinations are held, in most 
of them daily ; exercises are prescribed, and regular attendance is 
t'rict y enforced by calling the roll daily and fining absentees 
At the end of each session, examinations on printed questions are 
ite d, the average duration of which, in each class, is about four

hours. To the four or five best answers in each class, prizes are 
awarded, and these are publicly delivered by the Principal to the 
successful students on the last day of the session. 

On Monday mornings, during the session, the whole students 
and professors meet in the public school ; when the Sub-principal 
enforces the discipline of the college, by levying the fines for ab- 
sence from prayers or misconduct, and reprimands such delinquents 
as may seem to him to require reproof. The students meet in the 
public school every morning under one of the regents, who, with 
the humanist, take this duty, styled that of Hebdomader, by turns, 
weekly. The roll is called and absentees marked, and the fines, 
as above stated, are levied on the Monday mornings. The fines 
for absence from the classes are inflicted and levied by the profes- 
sors, each in his own class. 

All students, except those of divinity and medicine who have 
already completed the curriculum of Arts wear a scarlet gown and 
a uniform cap, the latter lately adopted by order of the Senatus. 
Students of Arts are hence called gown students. 

Bursars, or those students who enjoy bursaries or scholarships, 
formerly wore a black gown, and were made to perform menial ser- 
vices about the college. But for a long time past there has been 
no distinction in dress or duties between them and other students, 
with this exception, that the bursars in each class act by turns as 
censor, calling the roll and marking absentees, &amp;c. 

The fees paid by students in the four chief classes are L. 3, '3s. 
but the holders of the smaller bursaries pay much less, and these 
form generally about a-fourth of each class. The fee in the Latin 
class, and in that of oriental languages, is only L.l, Is., and in 
the chemistry, L.1, lis. 6d. ; the holders of the smaller bur- 
saries, as before, paying much less. 

At the commencement of the session, all bursars who had at- 
tended during the preceding session are examined on printed 
questions, and if found deficient, the payment of the bursaries is 
suspended till the student shall prove, by his examination at the 
end of the session, that he has made the desired progress. No 
session passes without several bursaries being suspended in this 
manner. 

Those presented to bursaries by lay patrons are also examined 
at the beginning of the session in which they produce their pre- 
sentations, and are only admitted if found habile, that is, properly 



1150 ABERDEENSHIRE. 

qualified. The rejection of unqualified presentees is by no means 
unfrequent. When once admitted, they are examined, with the 
other bursars, at the beginning of each Session. 

All the bursaries in the gift of the Senatus are conferred after 
public competition, held a week before the commencement of the 
session. Of these there are now about twenty-four annually va- 
cant. The Sub-principal collects the exercises, removes the names, 
substituting numbers, and then submits them to the judgment of 
the other masters. The best exercises obtain the bursaries which 
are vacant ; the order of merit in the exercises regulating that of 
the amount of the bursaries. 

The entire number of bursaries attached to King's College 
now amounts to upwards of 140. Their amount is very various. 
A few are under L.4 ; a few more L.5 ; the majority range from 
L.10 or L.12 to L.20 or L.2.5 ; and, within the last three years, 
the late Dr Simpson bequeathed to the university funds sufficient 
to provide six Bursaries of L.30 each, four of which are already 
in operation. There is one bursary of L.40 and one of L.50. 
Each bursary is enjoyed for four years, and if a vacancy occur 
during this period by death or resignation, the vacancy is not filled 
up till the four years have expired, and the vacant revenue is in 
the interim added to the proper fund of the bursary in question. 

The following is a list of the foundations and bursaries attached 
to King's College, with the names of founders and patrons. 

1. Founded Bursaries.— These belong to the original founda- 
tion by Bishop Elphinston. Their number was originally thirteen, 
but, from some cause or other now unknown, was long ago re-, 
duced to twelve. Three are presented annually, and decided by 
competition. Patrons, the Senatus. The value originally was 
L 40 Scots each, or L.3, 6s. 8d. Sterling ; but for the last seventy 
years, the Senatus has raised it to L.5, at which sum these bur- 
saries now remain. p o -.u 

o Watt's Bursary.— m James Watt, Minister of Snaith, mor- 
tifi'ed, in 1625, a rigg or croft of land for the support of a bursar 
in theology of the name of Watt, Barclay, or Chalmers, failing 
wh IT f one born in the city or chanonry of Old Aberdeen. I. 
Take was for a long period L.5; but the property having much 
IpLed in value, he Senatus, in 1819, established on this fund 
two bursaries of L.20 each. Patrons, the Senatus. 

3. Ley's Bursaries.~ln 1648,Sir Thomas Burnett of Levs 



UNIVERSITY AND KINg's COLLEGE. 



1151 



disponed to the college four crofts of land, for the support of 
three bursars on the same footing as the founded bursars ; the 
patronage to remain wrth Sir- Thomas and his heirs, and the Se- 
natus to present in the event of the patron failing to do so. The 
college accepted these conditions, and have strictly fulfilled them, 
increasing these bursaries from L.3, 6s. 8d. to L.5, along with 
their own founded bursaries. They also released Sir Thomas 
from arrears of feu-duties due to the College as superiors of the 
crofts. For a very long period, this transaction was a source of 
loss to the College, the revenue of the crofts being quite inade- 
quate to the payment of the three bursaries. But at length the 
crofts were feued for building, and thus produced a large revenue, 
amounting now to upwards of L.300. It seems but just that the 
college, which has always, even at a loss, fulfilled the original 
contract, should now benefit by the improvement in value of the 
property which they took with the risk, which was actually for a 
long time fulfilled, of deterioration. But the present Sir T. Bur- 
nett has brought an action to compel the college to divide the 
whole produce of the lands among the bursars, apparently con- 
sidering this contract as an ordinary mortification, from which, 
however, it differs in every particular. The college maintains, 
that, having received the property in fee, on condition of main- 
taining three bursars on the same footing as the founded bursars, 
having always done this, and having incurred great loss in fulfil- 
ling the contract, it is now entitled to the benefit of the improve- 
ment. The question is now in a court of law, for which reason 
we have given the above details, as the question has been very 
generally misunderstood by the public. 

. 4. Redhyth Bursaries. — In 1678, Walter Ogilvie of Redhyth 
mortified his estate for the board and education of twenty poor boys, 
twelve at the school of Fordyce, and eight at King's College. 
At present, the number supported at the school of Fordyce is 
thirteen, and at King's College, thirteen. The former receive each 
L.i, 16s. 8d. in money, and 8 bolls of meal. The College bur- 
sars formerly received L.9 each, then L.ll, and at present, L.16, 
10s. each, their number being also increased from eight to seven- 
teen. Patron, Earl of Seafield. 

5. Melville Bursaries. — Three in number, founded by Mr G. 
Melville in 1679, of the value of L.3, 6s. 8d. each. They have 
been increased to L.3, 16s. 8d. Patrons, the Senatus. 



1152 ABERDEENSHIRE. 

6. Park's iJMrsanVs.— Founded in 1691, for wo bursars, at. 
L.2, 15s. 6d. each, by James Park of Cranock. They have been 
increased to L.3, 18s. lOd. Patrons, the Senatus. 

7. Adam's JSitrianes.— Founded in 1691, by Dr Alexander 
Adam, for three bursars, at L.3, 6s. 8d. This was increased, 
before 1755, to L.5 ; and now, instead of three, there are thirteen 
bursars on this fund, four at L,20 each, and nine at L.15, lOs. 
each. Patrons, the Senatus. 

8. Fuller ton's bursaries.— Founded in 1692, by Mr James 
FuUerton, for maintaining as many bursars as the revenue of the 
original sum, L.850, would support. There were, in 1704, ten 
at L.3, 6s. 8d. These are now twenty-six; six at L.14, 10s., eight 
at L.14, and twelve at L.12 each. Patrons, the Senatus. 

9. Watson's Swrsanes.— Founded in 1699, by the Rev. William 
Watson, for two bursars at L.2, 15s. 6d., since increased to L.3, 
18s. lOd. In this and several other cases, the mortification con- 
sisting of a fixed annual payment, it has not been in the power of 
the Senatus to improve the fund in the same proportion as where 
they were enabled, as trustees, to invest a capital sum in land or 
otherwise. The Senatus are Patrons. 

10. Lady Braco's Bursary.— In 1706, Lady Braco mortified 
the interest ofL.lOOO Scots L.83, 6s. 8d. Sterling, for the sup- 
port of one bursar. He receives at present L.12. Patron, Earl 
of Fife. 

11. Glenfarquhar 5/rsanes.— Founded m 1716, by Sir Alex- 
ander Falconer of Glenfarquhar, who mortified the -annual sum 
of L.320 Scots, about L.26 Sterling for the support of four bur- 
sars. The value of these four bursaries, for the reason mentioned 
above, has never changed, being still L.80 Scots, or L.6, 13s. 4d. 
Sterling each. Sir Alexander Ramsay of Balmaui presents to 
two, and the Earl of Kintore to the other two. 

12. Ogilvy's z»-sarz/.- Founded in 1723, by Mr David Ogilvy 
for one bursar. L.200 were mortified, and for some time the in- 
terest of this sum amounted to L.IO, but latterly has been reduced 

toreig's Bursary.-Yonnd.ed. in 1724, by Mr James Greig, 
who mortified 1500 merks Scots, to be invested by advice of Mr 
Robertson of Foveran and his heirs, and the interest applied to 
support one bursar. This fund has not been invested as the other 
funds over which the College has full power have been. For th.s 
reason, although its value at first was L.4, 3s. 4d. annually, it was 



UNIVERSITY AND KING's COLLEGE. 



1153 



reduced, in 1762, to the free produce of the mortification, viz. 
L.3, 18s. 4d. at which it has since remained. Patron, Mr Ro- 
bertson of Foveran. 

14. Mackintosh's Bursary. — In 1728, the Laird of Mackintosh 
and his lady mortified the interest of 2000 merks Scots for one 
bursar of the name of Mackintosh, or of some other tribe of Clan 
Chattan. Patron, the Laird of Mackintosh. Present value of 
bursary, L.5, lis. lOd. 

15. Dr Fraser's Bursaries. — In 1730, Dr James Fraser, one 
of the greatest benefactors to the College, founded two bursaries, 
one in theology, the holder to be librarian after he graduates for 
four years, with L.6 annually ; the other a bursar in philosophy, 
with L.5 annually. There are now on this fund two bursars in 
philosophy at L.15, and two in theology at L.l 1, with L.30 addi- 
tional if one of them act as librarian. If not, the L.30 go to provide 
a substitute librarian. The bursars to be of the name of Fraser, 
and the magistrates and ministers of Inverness are patrons. 

16. Moir's Bursaries. — In 1769, Dr Alexander Moir of Sante 
Croix bequeathed L.600 for the support of four poor students, 
each of whom at first had L.5. This sum having been with many 
others also mortified for bursaries judiciously invested by the 
Senatus in land, there are now on this fund thirteen bursars in all, 
four at L.l 7, and nine at L.15. Patrons, the Senatus. 

17. Coil's BursarT/.— Founded in 1791, by Maclean of Coll, 
who mortified L.200 for the support of one bursar, presented by 
him or his heirs, of the name of Maclean. In the event of a va- 
cancy, the interest to be added to the capital. At first, the value 
of the bursary was L.9. It is now L.l 4. 

18. Dr Murray's Bursary. — In 1793, Dr Alexander Murray 
of Philadelphia, bequeathed to the College the residue of his es- 
tate, to found a lectureship in the College Chapel on Sundays ; 
the lecturer to receive three-fourths of the revenue, and one-fourth 
to be given to a bursar of the name of Murray, to assist in edu- 
cating him for any secular profession. The present revenue is 
about L.SOO, of which one-fourth or L.50 forms the secular Mur- 
ray Bursary, held for three years only. Of the remaining L.l 50, 
I-..120 are divided between two licentiates of the church, who per- 
form divine service on Sundays during the session in the College 
Chapel, both forenoon and afternoon. They are elected annually 
by the Principal and Regents. The balance is employed in the 
expenses incidental to the performance of divine service in the

chapel, which had long been discontinued, and in keeping the 
chapel in repair, also in paying a small salary to a precentor. 
The College is deeply indebted to Dr Murray for this very va- 
luable foundation, which has restored Divine Service to the Uni- 
versity, and is of the utmost advantage in every point of view. 

19. Mrs UdiiTj Duff's Bursaries. — Founded in 1794, for two 
bursars, who receive L.7, 14s. each. Patron, Earl of Fife. 

20. Grant's Bursary. — Founded in 1795 by the Rev. James 
Grant, for one bursar of the name of Grant or Fraser. Value 
originally L.8, 5s. ; at present, L.9, Is. 6d. 

21. Hutton' s Bursaries.— YomAeA in 1801 by Mr George Hutton 
of Woolwich, who left a large amount of property, both landed and 
personal, for the support of forty-eight bursars. The act of 
mortmain defeated his intentions as to his real property, and the 
College at last only received the residue of the personal estate, 
amounting to about L.5000, 3 per cent. red. ann. and yielding a 
revenue of about L.153. On this fund there are now four bur- 
sars at L. 18, and four at L. 16; and L. 15 are annually given by 
competition under the name of the Huttonian prije. In the 
amount of the bursaries and the arrangement of the prize, the 
College has adhered as closely as possible to the intentions of Dr 
Hutton. Patrons the Senatus. 

22. Finlay's Bursaries. — Founded in 1804 by the Rev. Robert 
Finlay. The sum of L.600 was vested in the hands of Mr Moir 
of Scotstoun, who was to pay the interest to the bursars, three 
in number. These bursaries, of the value of L. 10 each, are 
now paid by Sir M. Bruce as husband of Mr Moir's heiress. Sir 
M. Bruce is also patron, in right of his lady. 

23. Macleod's Bursary. — Founded in 1806 by Dr Hugh Mac- 
leod of Glasgow College, for one bursar of the name of Macleod. 
Value, L.8, 15s. 6d. Patrons, the Senatus. 

24. Milne's Bursary. — In 1808, Dr John Milne of Madras paid 
to the College L.600, to be invested at 4 per cent., for the assist- 
ance of a bursar studying medicine, after passing through the 
curriculum of arts. Vahie at first, L. 30 ; at present, owing to 
the fall of interest, L. 24. Patrons, the Principal and Regents. 

2.5. Stuart's Bursaries.— Yowne in 1809 by the Rev. James 
Stuart of George Town, South Jarolina, who left L.IOOO, 3 per 
cents., to be sold, and the interest of the price applied to the pro- 
motion of education, by the Principal and other trustees named in 
the deed. On this fund are two bur.sars, at L. 14, 10s., who are, 



UNIVERSITY AND KINO'S COLLEGE. 



1156 



like all those of whom the college is patron, chosen by compara- 
tive trial. A preference is given, by the will of the founder, to 
those of the names of Stuart and Simpson. 

26. Johnston's Bursaries. — Two bursars, at L. 4, 10s. each, to 
be chosen by competition, those of the name of Johnston and 
Forbes to be preferred, if found habile. The Senatus and the 
family of Caskieben are joint patrons. 

27. Cruickshank's Bursary. — Founded in 1815 by Mr James 
Cruickshank of Touxhill, who ordered L. 400, deducting the le- 
gacy-duty of L. 40, to be lent on personal security, and the inte- 
rest to be paid to one bursar of the name of Cruickshank or Jopp. 
For some time it yielded L. 1.8 per annum, but in consequence of 
the bankruptcy of the parties to whom the trustees had lent the 
capital, it has been much reduced, so that in future it cannot 
yield more than fxom L. 10 to L.12, according to the rate of inte- 
rest. Patron, the minister of Monquhitter. 

28. MacphersoiC s Bursary. — Founded by the late Sir John 
Macpherson, Bart., for one Highland student. The founder di- 
rected the revenue of the bequest to be paid annually to a new 
bursar, but the Senatus found it more likely to promote the ob- 
jects of the foundation, to appoint annually a new bursar for four 
years, and to pay him the annual revenue of the fund by four equal 
annual instalments, that is, during his curriculum of arts. As the 
revenue amounts to L.80, the annual value of the bursary is L.20, 
and the foundation thus yields four bursaries of that value, 
instead of one at L. 90 ; a sum considered by the Senatus much 
too large in proportion to the expense of living and of education 
in Aberdeen. Patrons, the Senatus- 

29. Forbes's Bursaries. — Founded in 1821, by John Forbes, 
£sq. of New. The bequest consists of L.200 long annuities, ex- 
piring in 1860, to be applied to the support of eight bursars at 
King's and Marischal Colleges, at L. 25 each. Patron, Sir 
Charles Forbes of New, Bart. 

30. Simpson Bursaries. — Founded in 1840, by the late Dr 
Simpson, an alumnus of King's College, who left upwards of 
L.l 1,000, 3 per cent, consols, for the purpose of founding six 
bursaries of L.30 each, and two annual prizes of L. 60 each, one 
for the best Greek scholar, the other for the best mathematician 
in the magistrand class of the year. The Senatus are patrons of 
this splendid bequest, and the bursars are chosen by public com- 
petition.

31. King William's Diviniti/ Bursaries.— Besides the above, 
there are two divinity bursars, founded by King William III. out 
of the Bishop's rents, the patronage of which is in the Lords of 
the Treasury, who select from a leet sent up by the Masters of 
King's and Marischal Colleges. These bursaries are common 
to both colleges. At first, their value was L.20 each ; but Queen 
Anne reduced them to L.IO each, and transferred L.20 in aid of 
the salary of the Principal of King's College. Although these 
bursaries are said to-be paid lartly by King's College and partly 
by Marischal College, they have never, in point of fact, been paid 
by either body, but always by the Exchequer. 

32. Bruce s Bursaries. — Founded about 1827 but the money 
not received till 1836, by the Rev. George Bruce, for six 
bursars in divinity, who receive L. 10 each. Patrons, the 
Senatus. 

33. Davidson's Bur sarj.— Founded in 1 827, by Mr William 
Davidson, for one bursar, who receives I. .14, 8s. Those of the 
name of Davidson to be preferred. Patrons, the Senatus. 

By the above statement it appears that there are, on the thirty- 
three, foundations, 1 50 bursaries, including those in medicine and 
theology, the aggregate annual value of which is above L. 2000. 
This is exclusive of the two Sunday preachers, who receive L. 60 
each on Dr Murray's foundation, and of the 17 boys educated 
and supported at the school of Fordyce under Redhyth's foun- 
dation. There can be no manner of doubt that this large amount 
of scholarship, large in proportion to the whole number of stu- 
dents, is of the very greatest benefit in a country like Scotland, 
where the inhabitants, although poor, are yet intelligent, and very 
desirous of giving to their children a liberal education. 

It has been thought right to give the details of the original and 
present state of these foundations, that the public may know how 
well the funds thus entrusted to the college have been managed. 
It will be seen, on referring to the above statement, that in every 
case where the college has been at liberty to invest a capital sum 
according to their judgment, this has been so judiciously and con- 
scientiously done, and also so fortunately, that in every such in- 
stance either the amount or the number, or both, of the bursaries 
on a special fund, have been augmented. In no case has the num- 
ber been augmented without an addition to the value of the bur- 
saries, and in no one such case has the value been diminished. It 
has been said that the multiplication of small bursaries produces

bud effects ; but it is to be observed that the College has uniform- 
ly raised the value where it had the power to do so. Besides, it is 
the opinion, formed on experience of all the members, that large 
bursaries, that is, above L.'20 or L.30, are not favourable to stu- 
dious habits, and that the inconvenience on this side is greater than 
on the other. No doubt, it is desirable, that no bursary should 
be under L.10 to L.15 ; and it may safely be said that, had the Col- 
lege been in all cases trustees of the capital sum, with full power, 
there would now be none under that value. But King's College 
has, at all events, reason to be proud of her management of the 
funds actually intrusted to her for the benefit of poor scholars, 
and may safely challenge the world to produce another example of 
equal skill and integrity in the management of so numerous and 
often individually small trusts. If we take the earlier bursaries, 
thus managed by the College, excluding one or two recent and 
large bequests, we shall find that the annual revenue of the trust- 
funds is not far from being equal to the original fee-simple of the 
funds. It is only just that the truth on this matter of the mortifi- 
cations of King's College should be known, for it has often, and 
especially of late, been much misrepresented, and King's College 
has been accused authoritatively of malversation, and of acting 
contrary to the will of the founder, for acting as they have done. 
To take only one example, in Adam's mortification, at first design- 
ed to support three bursars at L.3, 6s. 8d. each, or to yield L. 10 
in all ; this fund might have been kept in its original amount, 
say in the funds, and such a mode of management has not only 
been frequently practised elsewhere, but praised in others, as ful- 
fiUifig the intentions of the founder, by the very parties who blame 
King's College. But King's College acted differently ; invested 
the capital with caution and skill ; and now maintains out of this 
fund twelve bursars instead of three, expending on them L.200 in- 
stead of L.IO annually. This is called acting contrary to the will 
of the founder, nay, it is actually affirmed to be contrary to the 
spirit, and not merely to the letter of that will. This is, moreover, 
what is stigmatized as multiplying small bursaries ; twelve bursa- 
ries averaging L.16, 1 3s. 4d. being substituted for three of L.3, 
6s. 8d. It ought here likewise to be stated, that the masters have 
no personal interest in the gradual and slow improvement of these 
trust-funds. The only way in which they are personally benefit- 
ed thereby is by the class-fees paid by the newly made bursars. 
But the increase under this head to any one individual durino- his

incumbency is quite trifling ; the bursars, besides/ for the most 
part pay reduced fees, and the aggregate number of students is 
not now so large as it has been, nor larger than it often was iti 
early periods, although there are more bursars, and the non-bur- 
sars always pay the full fees. Even if the masters, however, de- 
rived a much greater benefit than they do from this source, they 
could not do so without a corresponding extension of university 
education ; in other words, a great benefit to the country at large, 
—and to this they are surely well entitled. 

Exclusive of the Huttonian prize of L.iS and the two new Simp- 
sonian prizes of L.60 each, about L.80 is annually bestowed in 
prizes in the form of books. This money is made up by contri- 
butions from the surplus funds of the richer mortifications. The 
Professors also frequently add prizes at their own private cost. 

A fund, called the Edilis fund, formerly existed for the neces- 
sary repairs in the College, and in the houses of the masters ; but, 
owing to the dilapidation of the College property, this fund has 
long been merely nominal, it being now considerably in debt. Part 
of the public buildings was about twenty years ago repaired and 
rebuilt by a public subscription ; and one hundred years ago Dr 
James Eraser, formerly mentioned, built, at his own expense, the 
whole range of buildings now forming the south side of the Col- 
lege. The square tower in the north-east corner was built before 
the Restoration by subscription. 

Owing to the decay of the Edilis fund, the houses of the Pro- 
fessors, intended by the founder to be free, are now all more or less 
in debt, for building or repairs. In most cases, the interest of this 
debt amounts to from L.IO to L.20, but in two it reaches L.35 
and L.40 ; thus, in reality, forming a heavy house rent, where the 
house ought to be free. The masters pay to the College five per 
cent, for money expended on their houses, and of late one to one 
and a half per cent, of this has been devoted to a sinking fund, in 
each case intended gradually to diminish the debt. 

The revenues of the College form three separate accounts. The 
mortification account includes all the trust-funds belonging to 
bursaries. The superiority account includes the sums received for 
superiorities and feu-duties sold by the College, and is kept sepa- 
rately J while the procuration account includes the proper annual 
revenue of the College from all other sources, such as land, tithes, 
feu-duties, &amp;c. &amp;c. After deducting from the two latter accounts 
the annual charge on each, the respective balances, which have 

4 



UNIVERSITY AND KING'S C0LI,EGE. 



1159 



been already alluded to, are equally divided among the ten mem- 
bers. The balance of the superiority fund hardly varies from 
• L.230, while that of the procuration or general account varies from 
L.'200 to L.500, or even more, according to circumstances. When 
money must be expended on permanent improvements of the Col- 
lege property, it is borrowed from the mortification funds, at the 
current rate of interest, and the debt 'thus incurred each year is 
paid off by ten annual instalments. 

The accounts are kept and the property managed by the com- 
mon procurator or College factor. This office was formerly held 
by one of the masters ; but, of late years, a man of business has 
been appointed, who receives a small salary, and a very small com- 
mission on his intromissions with the trust-funds. The present 
procurator is William Gordon, Esq. Advocate. 

Degrees are granted, as formerly mentioned, in all the faculties. 
Those of D.D. and LL.D. are commonly honorary degrees. The 
degree of M. D. is conferred after examination in presence of the 
Senatus, according to regulations adopted in 1839. Since that 
period, the average annual number of medical degrees conferred, 
BKclusive of a few honorary degrees, has been seven. For many 
years previously, no degrees at all had been conferred in medicine. 
The cost of a medical degree, including the 1.10 stamp, is L.26, 
5s. 6d. Of the degree of A. M. mention has already been made. 
The expense of it is L.2, 16s. 2d. 

The students in divinity are common to both Colleges, and at- 
tend alternately the Professors of Divinity in King's and Maris- 
chal College. They often amount to 150. 

The Medical School of King's College includes the following 
classes : 

Chemistry, taught by the . Medici ner.

stated, has lately been erected for the accommodation of the 
lecturers. The school is at present prosperous, and this not- 
withstanding the existence of another medical school in Aberdeen 
attached to Marischal College.

The Library of King's College is very extensive and valuable, 
but sadly cooped for want of space. As one of the four univer- 
sities of Scotland, King's College enjoyed, till lately, the Station- 
er's Hall privilege, and now receives, by Act of Parliament, the 
compensation granted in lieu of that privilege. By a decision of 
the Court of Session, in the exercise of their nobile officium or le- 
gislative power, the Marischal College has long been entitled to 
the use of the books derived from Stationer's Hall. But the cus- 
tody of these books, as well as the choice of those to be purchased 
with the compensation fund, remain with the University of King's 
College. 

The library possesses some other funds, partly derived from be- 
quests, partly from martriculation, and other fees paid by students. 
It is managed by a librarian with two bursars as assistants. The 
students attending College have the use of the books on deposit of 
L. 1 for each volume, to be returned when the book is restored. 
The Masters have the use of a certain number of volumes without 
deposit. One of them is annually named curator, and is aided by 
a Library Committee. 

A very neat room in the newest part of the College was fitted 
ap, in 1842, very beautifully for a Museum of Natural History. 
It is expected it will be opened in summer. There are no funds 
yet provided for the Museum. It has been fitted up by subscrip- 
tion. 

The Natural Philosophy Class has a tolerable cabinet of appa- 
ratus, which the Professor is annually improving and extending, 
by means of a small fund set apart for the purpose. The class 
of Chemistry possesses a moderate stock of apparatus, the property 
of the College, and an excellent lecture room. The Professor has 
a considerable amount of apparatus of his own ; but there is no fund 
worth mentioning for the purchase of apparatus, materials, or speci- 
mens, for this class. It may here be mentioned, that in summer 
he gives a course of Practical Chemistry ; average number of 
students, 10. There has for some years existed in the Natural 
Philosophy Class, an excellent class library, purchased chiefly by 
subscriptions from the students, aided by the Professors. A simi- 
lar library has this session been instituted in the Chemistry Class. 

There are a few astronomical instruments belonging to the 
College, but no regular Observatory. 

The College Chapel is u very handsome building, being the 
quire of the old College Church, ihe nave of which is now 



UNIVERSITY AND KING's COLLEGE. 



1161 



the Library. The stalls for the members of the church in the 
quire are of beautifully carved black oak, and are surrounded by a 
screen of the same material, which, in point of beauty and delicacy 
of carving, far surpasses any similar remains in Scotland. The 
tomb of Bishop Elphinstone is in the middle of the chapel, and, 
although once highly ornamented, is now covered with a slab of 
black marble without inscription. 

In the Senatus meeting-room is a fine portrait by Jameson, of 
Bishop Patrick Forbes ; and in the Public Hall adjoining are 
portraits of Bishops Dunbar, Elphinstone, Lesley, of Ross, and 
Scougall, also of Hector Boece, and of Henry Scougall, of George 
Buchanan, and curious likenesses of many of the Stuart Kings. 

The College is rendered conspicuous at a distance, by its fine 
square tower, surmounted by a beautiful imperial crown, which 
again is surmounted by a cross. The effect of this belfry is re- 
markably fine. In its present form it is said to have been built 
by Bishop Dunbar about 1530, the original tower or spire having 
been blown down or damaged by a storm. The old part of the 
College to which this belongs is ornamented with, the arms of 
James IV., of several of the Bishops, and of some of the nobles. 
The tower and crown are faced with freestone from Moray. 

It only now remains to mention, in addition to the eminent 
Professors formerly named, those distinguished men who were 
educated at King's College. Among these may be named James 
Cheyne, LL. D., who became Professor in Paris and Douay, 
about 1570; John Erskine of Dun, who_ assisted in promoting the 
Reformation in Scotland ; Sir George Mackenzie, King's Advo- 
cate, 1674; Mr George Gordon of Haddo, Regent in the Col- 
lege, afterwards President of the Court of Session, 1681, Chan- 
cellor, 1 682, and the first Earl of Aberdeen ; Dr Thomas Bower, a 
distinguished mathematician; the celebrated Dr Thomas Reid, first 
Professor of Philosophy here, and afterwards in Glasgow; Lord 
Monboddo; Robert Hall; Charles Burney, the celebrated Greek 
scholar ; the late Dr James Gregory of Edinburgh, author of the 
" Conspectus Medicinae Theoreticte," and long Professor of the 
Practice of Medicine ; he was son of Dr John Gregory, formerly 
mentioned, and received part of his education at King's College, 
before his father was invited to Edinburgh ; and lastly, the late Sir 
James Mackintosh, M. P. ; George, Earl Marischall, the founder 



1162

of Marischall College ; and Arthur Johnston, the celebrated Latin 
poet, were also educated at King's College. 

Such is a brief account of the University and King's College 
of Aberdeen. Attention has been chiefly devoted to its present 
state ; and the writer trusts that it will appear that this Institution 
was never more flourishing than it is now. That it may long con- 
tinue, as it has always been, a blessing and an ornament to the 
north of Scotland, is the wish of every true Scottish man who 
knows its history.

• As soon as the Reformation had received a legal establishment 
in Scotland, an attempt was made to improve the three Univer- 
sities then existing in the country, and in the First Book of Dis- 
cipline of 1560, many alterations in their government and teach- 
ing were proposed, with a view to accommodate them to the 
great cliange in religion which had taken place. In a few years 
afterwards, new charters or erections were given to these semi- 
naries, and partially put in force ; the University of Edinburgh was 
founded ; and the city of Aberdeen, then ranking as the second 
i or third in respect of wealth and population in the kingdom, re- 
I ceived a similar establishment. A grammar-school, which had 
produced many eminent scholars, had existed in it for nearly 
two centuries ; and the magistrates and citizens appear to have 
been exceedingly desirous of propagating the principles of the 
' reformed faith, in connection with the advancement of learning 
and science. In the principal Protestant family of the north of 
Scotland, they were fortunate in finding a nobleman, who seconded 
them warmly in this design, and became the founder of the fifth 
and last University which has been established in the country. 

This eminent person was George Keith, the fifth Earl Maris- 
chal, who succeeded to the large estates and influence of his 
•grandfather, William, in 1581. His ancestor had been an emi- 
nent promoter of the reformed cause from its commencement, and 
paidreat attention to the education of his grandson in the prin- 
I ciples which he had himself adopted. After receiving the best 
i education Scotland afforded, the young nobleman spent nearly 
seven years on the continent, during which he visited most of its 
; courts, and studied under eminent masters, particularly at Gene- 
va, under the learned Beza. He afterwards rose into great fa- 
■ vour with James VI,, and was sent to Denmark as ambassador 
 extraordinary, to arrange the King's marriage with the Princess 
• Anne. Soon after his return, he received a commission of Lord- 
i lieutenancy over all the counties of the north of Scotland, with the 
view of checking the Roman Catholic party opposed to the go- 
vernment ; a task which he accomplished without bloodshed.f

The plan of establishing a college in Aberdeen having been com- 
municated to him by the magistrates, and the royal authority hav- 
ing been obtained, an appropriate site was found in the buildings 
and garden which had belonged to the Franciscan friars. This 
property, having passed into other hands, was purchased by the 
magistrates for 1800 merks, and, by a vote of the community, 
presented to the Earl, who had obtained from the crown a right to 
the property of the other monastic bodies in the city. 

The preamble of the foundation charter, which is dated 2d 
April 1593, recites, at considerable length, the reasons which 
induced the Founder to establish and endow his seminary. Among 
these are, the great want of a literary and Christian education 
in the north of Scotland, the advantages that would follow to 
the Church and the State, and his own wish to beneht and deserve 
well of his country. The property bestowed on the college is 
then described, being the fields, houses, feu-duties, and annual 
rents, which, before the Reformation, belonged to the Black, White, 
and Grey Friars' monasteries in Aberdeen, together with the lands 
attached to the chapels of Bervie and Cowie in Kincardineshire; 
but the latter portion was revoked by a second charter given by 
his son and successor, the sixth Earl, in 1623. The whole reve- 
nue was appropriated for the maintenance of a Principal, three 
Professors, who were termed Regents, six poor Scholars or Bur- 
sars, an Economus, and a cook, all to live in a collegiate manner, 
eating and sleeping within the buildings. The Principal was to 
give instructions in theology, and also in Hebrew and Syriac, Ian-- 
guages which the founder expresses a desire of propagating, be- 
sides continuing the curriculum of the education of the othar stu- 
dents, during their fourth year of residence, in various branches 
of physical science. The subjects taught by the first or highest 
regent were, mathematics, ethical philosophy, and physics; those 
of the second regent were, the logic of the Organon, with exer- 
cises in the Greek and Latin languages; the latter, together with 
an introdueiion to dialectics, being the employment of the third or 
lowest regent. This curriculum of four years is minutely laid down, 
and is almost exactly the same as in the foundation of Edinburgh 

State, Faction, Religion, and Power of the Nobility of Scotland," written in 1583, 
and evidently intended for the information of Queen Elizabeth or her n"'" '";-

MARISCHAL COLLEGE A.ND UNIVERSITY. 



College, and in the new erections given to the other Universities 
of Scotland, A principal circumstance is the fixing of each teacher 
to a particular class of subjects, in order, as is stated, that the 
students may possess teachers worthy both of their genius, and of 
the subjects of study. The same plan is prescribed in the First 
Book of Disciphne ; but it never appears to have been carried into 
practice in any Scottish university till the eighteenth century, ex- 
cepting in Marischal College ; the mode of one professor con- 
ducting the same students for a period of three or four years 
through all the sciences taught being substituted for it. In Ma- 
rischal College, indeed, the founder allows of the old method be- 
ing continued, provided the chancellor, rector, and other authori- 
ties shall think it best for the good of the university. He enjoins 
a strict attentiori to examinations and exercises in all the classes, 
besides examinations at entering the first year, and in passing from 
the first to the second, from the second to the third, and from the 
third to the fourth class ; care being taken that those who are un- 
worthy be kept back ; and those who have studied four years, and 
exhibited sufficient aptitude, are to receive the degree of Master 
of Arts. 

The founder reserved to himself and his heirs the nomination 
or presentation of the principal and professors; but since the for- 
feiture of the Marischal family, in 1715, the patronage has been 
vested in the Crown. The mode in which the examination, elec- 
tion, and admission of incumbents, subsequent to their receiving 
presentations, is appointed to be regulated by the university au- 
thorities, has been seldom practised, and some of the provisions 
are apparently inconsistent with the patronage retained by the 
founder in his family. The rest of the charter, and indeed its 
larger part, is occupied in providing for the choosing of an econo- 
mus, adjusting the quality and prices of provisions, keeping up a 
Constant visitation and inspection of all the inmates, regulating 
minutely the discipline, dress, and hours of the day for teaching 
and recreation, the amount of fees to be paid by different ranks of 

• That the professors in Marischal College were limited to particular branches for 
several years after its commencement, is evident from their designations in ColieTe 
Theses, and other publications. Thus, in the " Qratio Fwiebris" of the founder, 
printed by Raban in 1623, William Ogston is styled Professor of .Moral Philosophy; 
William Wedderburn, of Greek ; Andrew Massie, of Logic ; and James Sibbald, of 
Natural Philosophy ; these being the four regents. In Bishop Forbes 's " Funerals," 
1605, .John Ray styles himself Professor of Moral Philosophy in Marischal Col- 
lege. This separation of duties appears to have been continued so lute as 1G43 , but 
the year when the ordinary method was introduced cannot be stated with certainty.

society, the menial services to be performed by the founded bur- 
sars to the other students, the prohibition of bearing arms of every 
description, the profession of adherence to the Confession of Faith 
then saciioned by law, at least once a year, dum albo Universita- 
tis inscribuntur ; together with other provisions, most of which 
have been altered or discontinued in the changes of time. Other 
parts regulate the mode of electing annually the rector and dean 
of faculty, and prescribe the qualifications and duties of the uni- 
versity officers, which, as in the courses of study above-mentioned, 
are the same as were given in that age to the other colleges of 
Scotland, with which, in all these respects, the new establishment 
was placed on a footing of equality. 

In the General Assembly which met at Dundee in April 1593, 
the foundation charter was approved and confirmed by the church ; 
and in July following, an Act of Parliament conferred upon the se- 
minary all the usual freedoms, privileges, and jurisdictions of the 
other colleges in the realm, with the exception of preserving the 
jurisdiction of the magistrates of the burgh over its members " in 
all thinsfis to be done or co'mitted be thame out wt the wallis of 
the said college, and within the territores or fredome of the said 
Igurgh," — a provision which is nearly the same with that proposed 
in the First Book of Discipline, many years previously  

In the year following, the deed of foundation was formally pre- 
sented by Earl Marischal to the magistrates and council of Aber- 
deen, who immediately delivered it in a solemn manner, to Mr Ro- 
bert Howie, one of the city ministers, who entered upon the duties 
of principal, and who signs as one of the witnesses of the charter. 
Howie was an eminent divine, and in a few years succeeded An- 
drew Melville at St Andrews. Of the other witness to the deed 
of foundation, Peter Blackburn, who acted as one of the first re- 
gents, and was afterwards Bishop of Aberdeen, Principal Baillie 
says, that " his hand was chief to order your Marischall Colledge 
just after our orders of Glasgow."f

from the magistrates and community of Aberdeen, of which many 
evidences appear in the town-council records. It is probable that 
an additional regent was established in a very few years after the 
foundation, from the Principal ceasing to teach the fourth or high- 
est class of the curriculum ; the earliest accounts of the revenue 
which have been preserved representing the whole as allocat- 
ed to the principal and four regents. The exertions of private 
.citizens were also of great service to the rising seminary. In 1613, 
Duncan Liddel, M. D., an eminent scholar, who had taught me- 
dicine and mathematics, in the University of Helmstadt, bequeath- 
ed a large sum of money and some lands, for endowing a profes- 
sor of Mathematics, and six bursars in Arts. A divinity bursar 
was endowed in 1616 ; and in the same year a professorship of 
Theology was founded, and five years afterwards an additional sum 
was given for the same chair. In 1625, Mr Thomas Reid, who 
had held the office of Latin secretary to James VI., bequeathed 
his valuable collection of books, together with a large sum for a 
salary to a librarian. Many other endowments, mostly for bur- 
sars, were made during the seventeenth century. A professor- 
ship of Humanity was commenced in 1653, from a grant of part of 
the rents of the diocese of Aberdeen by Cromwell ; but this fell 
at the Restoration, and a subsequent attempt to have a separate 
teacher of Latin towards the end of the century, was discontinued 
from the want of funds. During the eighteenth century, pro- 
fessorships of Medicine, Oriental Languages, and Chemistry were 
founded by private benefactors ; and within these few years, pro- 
fessorships of Church History, Anatomy, Surgery, and Humanity, 
have been added by Government, and additional endowments have 
been given to the professors of Chemistry and Medicine.

Plan of Education — It does not appear that in the Universities 
of the countries where the Reformation was established, any great 
alteration in the curriculum of education was effected till a long 
period after that event, if instruction in theology be excepted. 
The principal changes were in the attention paid to the Greek 
language, and the introduction of a somewhat larger proportion of 



ABERDEEN.

inatliematical science. Yet the first Reformers and their imme- 
diate successors seem, from many circumstances, to have been 
fully aware of the imperfections of much of the philosophy of their 
time, and of its incompatibility with the principles of freedom of 
inquiry, and appeal to the scriptures, upon which they rested their 
claim of superiority to the Roman Catholic Church. But the 
contests which arose and divided the Reformers themselves, and 
the wars, partaking more or less of a religious character, which 
followed till the peace of Westphalia, were circumstances adverse 
to the introduction of improved curricula of study ; and till the 
discoveries and systems of Descartes, Locke, and Newton came 
forward and were taught in universities, there was little to sub- 
stitute in the room of the scholastic logic of the middle ages, which 
had so long kept in trammels the powers of the mind in the search 
■of physical and psychological truth. The course of study came 
thus to vary very little in Reformed and in Catholic Universities. 
The same professor carried on the students with whom he com- 
menced, for three or for four years; and the attempt to confine 
each teacher to a particular branch was, after a trial of many 
years, not followed in Marischal College any more than in the 
other universities of Scotland, although enjoined in its foundation 
charter. One advantage, indeed, it possessed over some other se- 
minaries, in the early possession of a separate endowment for a 
professor who was confined to mathematical science. Of the nu- 
merous visitations which took place during the seventeenth cen- 
tury, very few had their attention directed towards the improve- 
ment of the plan of teaching, although a subject into which they 
were generally ordered to inquire. Those of 1664 and 1695 were 
especially for prescribing "a course of learning;" and the plan 
adopted by the commissioners was to draw up and circulate among 
the colleges copies of uniform " dictates," which all professors 
were to use in teaching philosophy and the sciences; — a useless 
and impracticable undertaking, which after many years labour was 
left as far as ever from being accomplished. The common mode 
of teaching continued long afterwards to be by Latin dictations 
and examinations upon them ; and particular works of compilers 
in various sciences were also used, and commented upon in oral 
instructions. 

Besides frequent commissions of visitation, the Scots Privy- 
Council often interfered with the Universities, in consequence of 
the arbitrary power which that body exercised till its abolition after 
the union of the kingdoms. To it was owing a useful order in 



MARISCIIAL COLLEGE A.ND UNIVERSITV. 



1700, by which the teaching of the Greek language was allotted 
to one professor ; but this improvement was not carried into effect 
in Marischal College till session 1717-ia 

A visitation, by royal authority, of the University of Glasgow 
in 1727, having ordered that each professor should be limited to 
teaching one particular department, this led the way to an at- 
tempt by the Principal and Professors of Marischal College to ex- 
tend the same benefit to their own seminary in 1733; but, from 
the opposition of one of their number to the measure, it proved 
imsuccessful. Twenty years afterwards the same plan succeeded, 
chiefly from the ability of Dr Alexander Gerard, who drew up a 
" Plan of Education, with the Reasons of it," which was adopted by 
his colleagues, and, with a few alterations, has been followed since. 

This publication is remarkable, not only for assigning reasons 
for confining the professors of the curriculum of arts to particu_ 
lar departments, but for a greater change, — the alteration of the 
order in which the different branches of knowledge had hitherto 
been taught in universities, both in this and in other countries. 
The following extract from a college minute, dated 11th January 
1753, exhibits the substance of the reasons which were brought 
forward to justify this change. 

" The Principal and Masters of the Marischal College of Aber- 
deen being, after the maturest consideration, all fully persuaded 
that the present order in teaching Philosophy, introduced by the 
Scholastics, is, since the reformation of Philosophy, very improper, 
— as by it the students are all at once engaged in the most diffi- 
cult sciences, such as are most abstract from sense, — as they must 
be taught the theory and foundations of evidence and reasoning 
before they are acquainted with the sciences in which examples 
of the various kinds can be found, so that it is impossible to ex- 
plain or illustrate these different kinds to them, — and as the diffi- 
culty of bringing them to conceive these abstruse subjects, before 
they have been gradually prepared by he easier parts of study, 
takes up so great a part of the time allowed for academical edu- 
cation, as to leave none for some very useful parts of knowledge ; 
being also of opinion, that the gradual openings of the human 
mind, as well as the natural order of things, render it projjer to 
begin with particular facts, which are subject to sense, or easily 
conceived ; from these to proceed to general reasonings on ob- 
jects which are most familiar, material things; and, last of all, to 
come to the abstruser inquiries concerning the operations, nature 
and states of the mind, the Deity, and Moral Philosophy founded 



1172 



ABERDEENSHIRE. 



on them; and hoping that the following this natural order will tend 
to render the study of the sciences more advantageous in life than 
It IS generally thought to be, and will remove the prejudices some 
have entertained against university education as useless, — they 
do, therefore, unanimously agree and resolve, that for the future 
the first year of the Academical course being spent as usual under 
the professor of Greek, and the meetings on Sabbath evenings in 
all the classes as formerly, in discourses on such subjects of na- 
tural and revealed Religion as the professors shall judge most use- 
ful, and adapted to the capacities of their students, the following 
general order in teaching Philosophy shall be observed in this Uni- 
versity, viz. that the Semi-year, or second of the course, shall be 
spent in the most useful parts of Natural History, in Geography, 
and the elements of Civil History ; that the Tertian, or third year 
of the course, shall be employed in the scientific parts of Natural 
Philosophy, Mechanics, Hydrostatics, Pneumatics, Optics, Astro- 
nomy, and such other branches not reducible to any of these, as 
either are in some measure invented already, or may be invented 
and improved hereafter, as Magnetism, Electricity, &amp;c. ; and that 
the Magistrand, or last year, shall be taken up in the abstract 
sciences, or the Philosophy of Spirits, Pneumatology, Ethics, and 
Logic, leaving it to the several professors to follow that order and 
method in teaching each of the general branches which they shall 
find from experience to be most useful and convenient." 

On this change being carried into effect, the students increased 
greatly in number, and a considerable impulse appears to have been 
given to the courses of science and literature, which are describ- 
ed by Dr Reid as having been, in his time, " slight and superfi- 
cial," as indeed they must, when one instructor hadto teach the 
whole curriculum. The custom of Latin prelections was also gra- 
dually discontinued, and instead of declamations in that language, 
examinations on the subjects of the lectures were introduced, at first 
in Latin, and afterwards in English, till the former language was 
retained only at the public examinations of the classes, where it ex- 
pired about 1776. 

The present curriculum for students in the Faculty of Arts con- 
sists of, — 

First Year. — First Greek class, 14 meetings a- week; First Hu- 
manity or Latin class, 8 do. 

Second Yrar.— Second Greek class, 3 meetings a-week; Second 
Latin class, 3 do.; First Mathematics, 6 do.; Natural History, 12 do.

Third Year. — Second Mathematics, 6 meetings a-week ; Na-

Fourth Year. — Moral Philosophy and Logic, twelve meetings a- 
week. Evidences of Christianity, one meeting a week. 

The meetino-s are of one hour each. The above numbers are 
exclusive of extra meetings, which occur occasionally. 

A third and a fourth Greek class, and a third Latin class, are 
attended voluntarily by several students of the third and fourth 
years ; the chemical class is also attended by many during these 
years ; and a third Mathematical class, which meets daily, is at- 
tended by the mathematical bursars, and by some students of the 
fourth year. 

The students of all these years also iattend a weekly lecture on 
Practical Religion, given on Fridays by the Professor of Divinity, 
•who receives a .salary for it under the will of the late John Gordon, 
Esq. of Murtle. The morning meetings of the classes are open- 
ed with a prayer ; and on the Lord's day a part of the students 
attend divine worship in a gallery in the College church ; but the 
greater number have long been in the habit of accompanying their 
relations or friends to other churches in the city, and students of 
other religious denominations have never been required to attend 
in the Established Church. 

The session extends from the last Monday of October to the 
first Friday of April. There are no vacations, Christmas and 
new-year's days excepted ; and regular meetings are held on Sa- 
turdays. 

Premiums, generally of books, are awarded in the classes by 
comparative trial among those students who come voluntarily for- 
ward ; and there have also been instituted a biennial prize of 
L.20 for an Enghsh essay on a subject prescribed by the Principal 
and certain of the Professors, who are trustees of Mrs Blackwell's 
foundation ; and a gold medal of two ounces in weight, which has 
been occasionally awarded, under the deed of John Gray, Esq. to 
such of his bursars as are certified by the professor of Mathema- 
tics, to " possess an uncommon genius in that science, and to have 
made discoveries and improvements therein." 

During the last fortnight of the session, a public examination of 
each class of the curriculum of A/ts is held in presence of the 
Principal and Professors, and of all the students and public who 
choose to attend. These have always existed; and since 182G, 
entrance examinations during the first week of the session have 
■ been carried on. In the latter, all under graduate students wearinn- 



1174 



ABERDEENSIIIUE. 



gowns, and admissible to academical honours, are examined on 
the subjects which are taught in the classes immediately below those 
which they are about to enter, and any who are found to have made 
so little progress in their studies as to be unqualified for receiving 
sufficient advantage in the higher classes, are ordered to return to 
study in those classes, in the subjects of which they have been 
found deficient. Students refusing to submit to this condition 
are disqualified from holding bursaries, and can enter the higher 
classes only as private students, not wearing gowns, or admis- 
sible to the degree of A. M., but in all other respects are on the 
same footing as the rest. 

The qualifications for the degree of master of arts are regular 
attendance for four years in the above classes of the curriculum, 
and strict examinations, which are carried on for seven days, in the 
Evidences of Christianity, Latin, Greek, Natural History, Mathe- 
matics, Natural Philosophy, and Moral Philosophy and Logic, 

The students of Divinity attend ihe professors of divinity. Ori- 
ental Languages, and church history during a session of fifteen 
weeks, from Christmas to the beginning of April. The courses 
of lectures, and the modes followed of delivering discourses 
and other exercises, are accommodated to suit the rules of 
the Church of Scotland. For a long period, the number of stu- 
dents who attended regularly was far smaller than that of those 
who gave partial or irregular attendance, and who were generally 
present for a week, or even less, in each session. About fifty years 
ago, the synod of Aberdeen recommended the discontinuance of 
this irregular attendance, and overtured the General Assembly on 
the subject ; but it was not till of late years that any alteration in 
the laws regulating attendance took place. At Aberdeen, how- 
ever, the number of regular and irregular students began to be 
about equal in 1820 ; and from the rules of the church, now en- 
forcing attendance on Hebrew and Church History classes, instead 
of recommending it, and from other changes, the proportion of 
those giving partial attendance has been still farther reduced. 

Medical School. — From an early period there have been in this 
city many medical students who obtaioed their professional edu- 
cation chiefly from the private instructions of the physicians esta- 
blished in it, to whom they were engaged as pupils or apprentices, 
and whose private practice they witnessed. The institution of an 
infirmary in 1742, and of a public dispensary in 178, added to 
their number, from the facilities of instruction being greatly ex- 
tended ; and in 1789, they associated in originating " The Medi- 



MARISCHAL COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY. i i 

cal and Chiriirgical Society," which gradually acquired a Hbraryj 
a museum, and an elegant building in King Street for holding 
their meetings and collections. 

Various attempts to open regular classes by the professors of 
medicine and other physicians were made, but discontinued from 
want of sufficient support; and, in the discussions of 1786, the 
formation of a medical school was held out to the public as one of 
the chief advantages to be derived from an union of the Colleges, 
For some years .previously, courses of botany and chemistry had 
been carried on in Marischal College. In the former Statistical 
Account, published in 1798, the number of medical students is 
stated about 30 ; and in 1802, there was erected in the court of 
the college a small anatomical theatre, in which some courses of 
anatomy were given. In 1818, the two colleg-es joined in giving 
their sanction to several medical lecturers, each college nominat- 
ing alternately to the offices as vacancies occurred. Under this 
arrangement, classes of anatomy and physiology, surgery, insti- 
tutes of medicine, materia medica, midwifery, and other branches 
were carried on, and accommodation provided for them in Maris- 
chal College buildings. The institution of these regular courses 
was followed by a great increase in the number of students. In 
1839, the agreement, under which these lecturers were appointed, 
was broken up, and each college was left to establish its own me- 
dical school. In the same year, professorships of Anatomy and 
Surgery were founded in Marischal College by the Crown, and 
the Faculty of Medicine in the Senatus Academicus now consists 
of four professors, those of Medicine, Chemistry, Surgery, and 
Anatomy, who are associated, in a permanent medical committee, 
with lecturers on Materia Medica, Institutes of Medicine, Mid- 
wifery, and medical jurisprudence, — practice of physic being 
taught by the professor of Medicine, and Botany by the professor 
of Natural History. The medical session extends from the first 
Monday of November to the third Friday of April, with a va- 
cation at Christmas;" and the course of Botany is taught in sum- 
mer. 

The regulations for granting M. D. in this University under- 
went a considerable change about twenty years ago, when the 
plan of granting that degree by certificates of merit was abanr 
doned, and personal examination of candidates substituted, which, 
in 1830, was confined to those who had obtained the degree of 
A. M. ; the Senatus Academicus being of opinion " that no uni- 
versity ought to confer the degree of M. D. on any one who haa 



1176 



AUEKDEENSHIRE. 



not previously taken a degree in arts." But the Royal Commis- 
sioners of Visitation having, in their new plans, proposed to re- 
strict the preliminary education of such candidates to Greek, 
Latin, Mathematics, and Natural Philosophy, the Senatus found 
that the higher standard which they had advocated, with a view of 
adding to the respectability of the medical profession, could not 
be supported ; and they have subsequently modified it, retaining 
at the same time a full curriculum of medical instruction, in the 
last regulations issued in 1840. This extends to four years, three 
of which at least must be passed in a University, including one 
year at least at this University ; and the classes to be attended are 
Anatomy, Practical Anatomy, Chemistry, Materia Medica, Insti- 
tutes of Medicine, Surgery, Practice of Medicine, and Midwifery, 
each for a course of six months; and for courses of three months. 
Botany, Practical Chemistry, and Medical Jurisprudence. To 
these are added hospital attendance, Clinical lectures on Medicine 
and Surgery, and the compounding and dispensing of medicines. 
Three separate professional examinations have been instituted for 
medical degrees, which take place in April and October, and are 
conducted partly in writing and viva voce, and partly by demon- 
stration. To these examinations candidates are admitted at dif- 
ferent terms ; to the first one, at the beginning of the third year 
of medical classes, and to the others at subsequent stages. No 
fees are taken by the College or the examiners for the degree of 
M. B. or M. D., — the expense of the diploma and the Govern- 
ment stamp on the latter degree excepted. 

In the " Evidence, Oral and Documentary," taken in 1826-7, 
by the Royal Commissioners for Visiting the Universities of Scot- 
land, and published ten years afterwards, there will be found de- 
tailed statements of the views of the principal and professors of 
that time on many important subjects connected with the efficiency 
of university education, particularly in a minute examination of 
the plans of improvement or alteration proposed by the Commis- 
sion in the Curricula of Arts, Theology, and'Medicine. See Vol. 
iv. p. 321-335. 

In the same volume are contained lists of the number of stu- 
lents and graduates for a long period, tables of fees, and com- 
plete information as to the whole property, salaries, and endow- 
ments belonging to the college. Under this head it deserves to 
be noticed, that the whole of the property with which the college 
was originally endowed by its founder, has been preserved and

greatly increased in value, with the exception of some small feu- 
duties of 1 d. and upwards, most of which had ceased to be col- 
lected before 1753, or were disputed, and of which the whole 
amount is only L.2, lis. Id. Sterling. The Royal Commission 
did a useful service by printing this list, and many other documents 
connected with the Scottish Universities. Vol. iv. p. 266-267. 

The amount of fees paid by students of arts for instruction dur- 
ing four sessions, including smaller payments for the library, col- 
lege servants, and the expense of taking the degree of A. M. is, 
at present, L.'27, 2s. ; but from the greater part of the bursars, 
smaller class fees are charged by the professors. The fees in the 
classes of law and medicine are on a scale of equal moderation, 
and the same is the case in those of Hebrew and Church History. 
In the Divinity class, no fees have yet been taken by the professor. 

The bursaries, which, as will be seen from the list of benefac- 
tors, are very numerous, are held for four years, with the excep- 
tion of the two founded by John Gray, Esq. for eminence in ma- 
thematics, which are held for two sessions only, and the Ramsay 
Divinity Bursaries, which are held for three. All the bursaries, 
of which the college, and the magistrates and town-council of 
Aberdeen have been constituted patrons by their deeds of founda- 
tion, have been, for a very long period, disposed of by an open 
comparative trial, which takes place yearly on the last Monday of 
October. Those, which are under the patronage of private indi- 
viduals, are bestowed by presentation. In some cases, where the 
disposal of the bursaries has been subjected to restrictions by their 
founders, or to preferences in favour of particular descriptions of 
students, it sometimes happens that a few are left vacant from the 
want of qualified candidates. The funds are then accumulated, 
and the annual value to be bestowed is increased. Several other 
bursaries, without having been left vacant, have been increased in 
value, from the nature of the investment of the funds, or from the 
reservation of a small surplus left to accumulate. All the pro- 
perty of this description has been preserved, except a sum of L.90 
lost by a bankruptcy, and much of it has been increased in value. 

The Royal Commission, in their General Report of the Uni- 
versities of Scotland, expressed a decided opinion, that the great 
number of th ese bursaries in some of the colleges produces an ar- 
tificial resort of numbers who otherwise would never enjoy the 
advantages of academical education. In the various arguments 
adduced in support of their views, one fact of great importance 
has been omitted,— the superiority of the parish schoolmasters in

the counties of Kincardine, Aberdeen, Banff, Moray, and other 
northern counties of Scotland, almost all of whom have received 
university education, to those in the southern parts of the country, 
many of whom have not attended any college. The very low 
state of education in England, among those of the same class in 
society who benefit from the Scottish schools, and the difficulty 
experienced in the former country of obtaining cheap and efficient 
schoolmasters, may also be stated in favour of promoting the ex- 
tension of university instruction in Scotland. The claim of the 
Universities to encouragement in fulfilling this most important 
part of their duty, is indirectly acknowledged by the same Com- 
mission, when they state respecting the Universities of Aber- 
deen, that " they have silently and unostentatiously raised the 
intellectual state of Scotland."  

College Buildings. — The original buildings of Marischal Col- 
lege were those of the Franciscan convent on the same site. Part 
was appropriated for the residence of students, but no plan or 
perspective view of them has been preserved. It would appear 
that even in the infancy of the establishment they had been insuf- 
ficient, for in 1633 the magistrates ordered a house to be fitted up 
with beds for the accommodation of students who formerly lodged 
in'the town house.-}" In 1639, a part of the monastic edifice was 
destroyed by fire, and was soon afterwards rebuilt, chiefly by the 
munificence of Patrick Dun, M.D., then Principal of the College. 
The buildings having become unsuitable or ruinous, the Principal 
and Professors commenced in 1684, the erection of anew edifice, 
which was carried on slowly for several years chiefly by voluntary 
contributions, some aid from the city funds, and some small pub- 
lic grants of the vacant stipends of those parishes of which the 
Earls Marischal were patrons. The numerous Scottish merchants 
who in that age resided in Poland were among the principal con- 
tributors. The highest part of the edifice, the north tower, rose 
to the elevation of about 80 feet, and was erected in 1694-95 for 
an observatory, partly at the expense of the town. The whole 
pile was for the time extensive and not inconvenient; but parts of 
the interior remained long in an unfinished state, from the want of 
funds, and a great economy appears to have been necessary, as the 
vouchers of accounts, all of which have been preserved, abundant- 
ly attest. Several portions of the old monastery remained, and 
were occupied as class-rooms and students' chambers. Most of

these were taken away, when an extensive wing was erected on the 
south side in 1740-41, also by voUintary subscription chiefly, the 
attempts made to obtain aid from Government proving abortive. 
After this addition, the whole fabric was appropriated for the pub-" 
lie purposes of a hall, library, public school, divinity hall, obser- 
vatory, natural philosophy apparatus room, and class-rooms, toge- 
ther with lodgings for three of the professors, for which they paid 
rents. The largest apartments, the public school, hall, and li- 
brary were respectively of the lengths of 82, 75, and 97 feet, with a 
width of 22, and a height of about 13. 

In the court adjoining, there still remains the ancient church 
of the Franciscan convent, commonly called the College church. 
This edifice was erected about the commencement of the sixteenth 
century, by Bishop Gavin Dunbar, and was dedicated to the 
Virgin. For a long period, no lofty houses, as at present, inter- 
vened between it and the Broadgate, excepting booths or small 
shops, which were placed against its wall by permission of the ma- 
gistrates. In the various changes to which the property of the 
monasteries was subjected at the Reformation, the church of the 
Greyfriars seems never to have been lost sight of by the munici- 
pality; it was then by far the newest church in the city, and was 
formally ceded to the magistrates in 1556, when the Franciscans 
made a resignation of all their property to them. When, in 1574, 
the town disposed of the other buildings by feu, the church was 
reserved ; but the population not being so large as to require it for 
the reformed worship, it fell into neglect, and sometimes received 
repairs. The General Assembly of the church, which began 
July 28, 1640, was held in it. The College long retained a 
claim for the use of it at the public graduation, and other privi- 
leges, which, after several attempts, were arranged in 1768 by 
an agreement with the magistrates ; and soon afterwards, the popu- 
lation of the town increasing, the structure, a very long and plain 
Gothic hall, with pointed- arch windows, was shortened 20 feet, an 
aisle added at the east side, and a regular clergyman settled in it

by the towti-council, who had obtained a gift of the patronage 
from King Charles I. in 1638. In the new aisle, one-half of the 
gallery was set apart for the students, who had previously been 
accommodated in the West Church of St Nicholas. 

The sums raised for erecting the College buildings appear never 
to have been sufficient to complete them, and the whole having 
been constructed when mason and carpenter work were of a very 
inferior description in this part of Scotland, they required nume- 
rous repairs annually. The increase of students rendered the class- 
rooms inconveniently small for many years; and in 1818, a plan 
of additional apartments was made, but nothing was done till 1824, 
when, after a minute inspection by three architects, who reported 
that the whole edifice was in a ruinous state, and incapable of al- 
teration or repair, a memorial was drawn up, setting forth the ne- 
cessity of a new structure, and application was made to the Lords 
of the Treasury, to whom a plan and elevation of a new college 
were submitted in the following year. The Treasury replied 
without delay, concurring in rebuilding rather than in attempt- 
ing repairs, stating it to be a case in which a grant of public 
money might be recommended in addition to private subscriptions, 
and remitting to the Barons of the Scottish Exchequer to inquire 
farther. Their inquiries having been answered by the College, 
the Treasury delayed farther steps till it should be " ascertained 
how far the union of the two Universities at Aberdeen in one es- 
tablishment may be practicable," and referred to the Royal Com- 
missioners for visiting the Universities of Scotland for farther 
information on that head. This postponed any thing being done 
for nine years. The report of the Commission, which began its 
sittings in 1826, was not made public till 1831 : it recommended 
strongly a union of the seminaries, but towards accomplishing 
which, as only general provisions and no particular plans, in a case 
affecting so many complicated interests, were stated, nothing was 
done ; and the College received no certain hope of a public grant 
till 1834, when, on their continued applications, the Treasury 
made offer of the moiety of a sum of L.30,000, which, by a war- 
rant dated 1 Ith December 1826, had been set apart by the Scot- 
tish Exchequer Barons " to be applied to the support of certain 
Universities which were in a ruinous and dilapidated state," and 
of which the other half had been received and expended at St

Andrews some years previously, without any aid being raised by 
private subscriptions. 

The conditions on which the Treasury agreed to advance the 
above sum of L.15,000, together with the interest accrumg on 
the whole sum set apart in 1826, arose from a proposal made by 
the College to guarantee, within five years, the completion of a 
new edifice of an extent not inferior to that in the sketches of Mr. 
Reid, His Majesty's Master of Works in Scotland, who had visited 
Aberdeen in February 1834 for the purpose of obtaining informa- 
tion as to the accommodation required. Their Lordships termed 
the offer made by the College " liberal," and considered it unne- 
cessary that the King's architect should be employed,— the plan 
and site adopted being still left subject to their approbation. This 
allowed the Principal and Professors again to bring forward, with 
such improvements as the delay had suggested, the plans prepared 
in 1825 by Mr Archibald Simpson, architect, whose excellent taste 
and great ability have been displayed in the new edifice, as they 
have been in the Assembly Rooms, the Infirmary, and other prin- 
cipal buildings erected of late years in Aberdeen, 

The subscriptions of the numerous alumni and friends of the 
college now commenced, the town of Aberdeen giving L.1050, 
the Chancellor of the University, the late George, Duke of Gor- 
don, L.500, the Principal and Professors, L.500, &amp;c. In about 
three months, they amounted to nearly L.5000, but soon after- 
wards they experienced a check from the agitation connected with 
a bill brought into Parliament, which met with great opposition 
from the public generally, because it attempted to divest the Col- 
leges of all management of their property, and by ils provisions 
for uniting them, to injure greatly the interests of University edu- 
cation in the north of Scotland. Although this bill was with- 
drawn in an early stage, yet the prospect of speedily obtaining the 
Government grant continued to be clouded by the revival of the 
subject of the Union in other shapes ; and it was not till after a 
tedious negociation that the Treasury approved of the plan and 
estimate finally transmitted by the College, and engaged to pay 
L.15,000 as soon as L.6000 of subscriptions were realized, and on 
these L.21, 000 being expended to their satisfaction, to pay the ad- 
dition of accrued interest, the edifice to be completed in June 184L 
On this occasion, the magistrates and town-council of Aberdeen 
assisted the College in guaranteeing the erection of a building 
to the above extent, in the hope, that, while the work was in pro- 



1182

gress, a change of circumstances might induce new subscribers to 
come forward, and those who had ah-eady subscribed to permit the 
application of their subscriptions to the finishing of the work, which 
many had refused to allow, should the intended new modelling of 
the constitution of the University take place. This hope was re-| 
alized. The subscriptions already made were paid, and many new ] 
ones received after the agitation ceased. The Government grant 
was paid, in August 1836, to the Chancellor and Rector of the i 
University, the Member of Parliament for the city, the Provost, 
and the Dean of Guild, all for the time being, who were constitut- 
ed a commission for expending it, and the sums subscribed; and 
in the same month the building was contracted for. In this tran- 
5aGtion it is proper to preserve a record of the services of Alexan- 
der Bannerman, Esq. M. P. for Aberdeen, to whom the College 
and the community are deeply indebted for the exertions which he 
made towards obtaining the Government grant, during a negocia- 
tion complicated with unusual circumstances, and continued for 
several years. 

In 1841, the Lords of the Treasury, having been satisfied, from 
an examination by their agent, that the sum of L.2 1,000 had 
been expended, ordered the accrued interest, amounting to L.585.'3, 
9s. 2d., to be paid to the same commissioners, by means of which 
they were enabled nearly to complete the building, including many 
interior furnishings in the library, class-rooms, &amp;c.; although some 
expensive fittings, particularly those of the museum, remain to be 
provided for. When finished, the whole cost will be about 
L.30,000 ; which, considering the style in which it is erected, and 
the extent of accommodation afforded, may be considered as com- 
paratively cheap. In front the new college presents three sides of 
a quadrangle,-placed nearly on the site of the old building, which it 
was necessary to keep up till the greater part of the new one was 
so far advanced as to supply accommodations for teaching the 
classes. The exterior is of Gothic architecture, partaking of that 
seen in many collegiate structures in England, but in a simple and 
bold style, in order to harmonize with the nature of the material, 
which is the very hard and durable white granite of the vicinity. 
In the centre a square tower, terminated by four ornamented tur- 
rets, rises to the height of nearly 100 feet from the court in front, 
and, from the fall of the ground, to 120 feet from the enclosure 
on the opposite side. On both sides of the principal entrance are 
open arcades, 48 feet long, by 16 wide. On the ground-floor the

principal apartment is the public school, 74 feet long, and 34 wide, 
used for all purposes where several classes are assembled together, 
and for competitions, examinations, &amp;c. A lofty staircase, with a 
ceiling of enriched groins and a massive stone balustrade, con- 
ducts to the three principal apartments, which open from the same 
vestibule, — the Hall, the Library, and the Museum. The dimen- 
sions of the first of these is 71 feet by 34; of each of the other 
two, 75 feet by the same width. The interior altitude of all is 
about 32 feet to the top of the enriched ceilings, painted in imi- 
tation of oak. Adjoining to the Library are two small rooms, used 
for reading-, and as an office for the librarian ; and on the Museum 
side are a room for the meetings of the Senatus Academicus, and 
one for containing additional articles of Natural History, adjoining 
to the class-room in which that science is taught. The astrono- 
mical Observatory is placed in the highest story of the tower. 
-There are six class-rooms for teaching Greek, Latin, Natural His- 
tory, Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, and Moral Philosophy and 
Logic; one for Scots Law and Conveyancing; three for Divinity 
and Oriental Languages, in one of which is held the Theological 
•library; two others, at present occupied by the lecturers on Mate- 
ria Medica and Agriculture ; and five used in teaching the Practice 
of Medicine, Surgery, Anatomy, Chemistry, and Practical Che- 
mistry. Besides these seventeen class-rooms, there are also a spa- 
cious Chemical Laboratory, and two rooms adjoining for Chemical 
Apparatus ; a Dissecting-room adjoining the Anatomical Theatre, 
and rooms for Anatomical preparations; an Anatomical Museum, 
• fitted with glass cases and a gallery ; and two rooms for holding 
the apparatus used in teaching Natural Philosophy. The college 
servants have suitable accommodations; and to most of the class- 
rooms is annexed a closet for the professor ; but no part of the 
building has been appropriated for lodgings for any of their 
body, the whole being set apart for the public purposes of edu- 
cation. The plan of heating is by warm air supplied from 
furnaces placed in the sunk story, excepting in three of the class- 
rooms, in which the circulation of hot water in iron pipes has been 
adopted. 

When a new and wide street is opened from the College gate, 
passing by a gentle declivity towards the East Church, a fine ef- 
fect in regard to architectural beauty will be produced, besides 
the advantages which the property in the neighbourhood will re- 
ceive from the improvement. This design, together with the re-

building of the College Church in a style suitable to that of the 
university, will jDrobably be carried into effect in a few years. 

College Library, Museum, c. — The library, which will this 
year be transferred to the fine apartment destined for it in the new 
buildings, consists, for the greater part, of old books, which have 
been, on the whole, well preserved. It originated in a collection 
of volumes which was made at the Reformation, among which are 
numerous manuscripts of parts of the writings of Augustine, Je- 
rome, Gregory, and other fathers of the church, which belonged 
to the monasteries in the city, and were taken charge of by the 
magi trates on the breaking up of these establishments. Before 
the foundation of the college these and other books, mostly on 
theological subjects, were kept in the church of St Nicholas, chiefly 
for the use of the Reformed clergy, and were called the Town's 
Library, and Bibliotheca Ecclesiastica. In 1624, the large be- 
quest of Mr Thomas Reid, above-mentioned, transferred his li- 
brary to the college, where it was united to the books given by Dr 
Liddel and those of the Bibliotheca Ecclesiastica. The librarian's 
salary, for which Mr Reid also left 6000 merks, was then about 
600 merks, the common interest of money being ten per cent. 
Some smaller donations of books were made ; and in the oldest 
catalogue extant, dated 1670, the books of each donor are distin- 
guished. The number of volumes at present is not above 12,000. 

The magistrates appointed the librarian till 1673, when the right 
of electing him was claimed by the principal, the four regents, and 
the rector of the Grammar school, in terms of Mr Reid's will, and 
after a four years' law-suit a decision of the Court of Session con- 
firmed the claim, and the above-mentioned persons have since exer- 
cised it. From the salary having been for a very long period reduced 
to L.14, 3s. 4d., it was found necessary, in 1754, in order to pre- 
vent dilapidations, that each of the regents should in turn take im- 
mediate charge of the Library, giving personal attendance for three 
years. The collection is accessible to all under graduates, and to 
masters of arts, on condition of a single payment of 7s. 8d., and 
a deposit of money, which is returned when required ; and literary 
men or others, not authorized to claim in these respects, are always 
allowed the loan of books on the responsibility of individual pro- 
fessors, subject to an annual return in October, when all the vo- 
lumes lent are called in, and the whole inspected. 

It is greatly to be wished that the funds of this library were 
increased, the only sources whence new books are purchased being 



MARISCHAL COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITf. 1186 

the above payment, and any fees paid by graduates in divinity or 
laws, the whole fees of whose diplomas, excepting the expense of 
writing them, have been for a long time given to it; but the num- 
ber of these has always been small. The college has never en- 
joyed the full benefit arising from the books entered in Stationers' 
Hall; for only one copy being sent to Aberdeen, the righto f 
keeping them was given, by the Court of Session, in 1737, to the 
older establishment, but, as the decision bears, " for the use of 
both colleges." The late alteration, by which an annual payment 
is given to King's College in lieu of these books, has not remedied 
the unequal circumstances in which Marischal College is placed, 
and which the Royal Commissioners have represented in their 
reports. 

A theological library was instituted in the year 1700 by the 
Synod of Aberdeen, who granted the sum of 1000 merks to the 
Professor of Divinity in Marischal College, out of the rents of an 
estate mortified to support the Professor of Divinity in King's 
College ; the books purchased « to be set up in a distinct library 
by themselves in the Marischal College, or some convenient room 
in New Aberdeen," « so as to be patent for all the students of Di- 
vinity in both colleges." In 1754, the books were placed in the 
Divmity Hall of the college, and the professor continued to select 
those to be purchased till 1785, when a committee of the students 
received the management. The contributors of a small sum an- 
nually for four years are constituted life-proprietors. There is a 
printed catalogue of the collection, and the regulations under 
which it is managed are sanctioned by the colleges, no alteration 
of them being valid unless made with the consent of both colleges, 
in order to avoid " the many evils arising from precipitation." 
- Many articles of curiosity and specimens of natural history, 
presented to the college at different times, were lodged in the 
Library, till 1786, when a separate apartment was partially fitted 
up for them with cases, and which, in 1823, was remodelled and ex-' 
tended. It is to be ardently hoped that, with the great advantages 
of display which the new apartment to be fitted up as a Museum 
IS capable of affording, this collection will rapidly increase. The 
present professor of Natural History is in possession of an exten-' 
sive museum of objects useful in teaching that science, particularly 
m Zoology and Mineralogy, which have beenpurchased at his own 
expense.

articles are added annually to it. It commenced in 1717, when the 
Principal and Professors obtained a royal warrant for applying 
some vacant salaries towards purchasing instruments ; and it ap- 
pears, from entries in the college accounts, that the money thus 
obtained was laid out under the direction of the celebrated Mac- 
laurin, then Professor of Mathematics, and probably the first who 
gave instructions in any parts of the Newtonian philosophy in this 
university. In 1726, a printed proposal was circulated for in- 
creasing the apparatus, so as to afford a complete course of Expe- 
rimental Philosophy ; and in that year, the Commissioners of 
Supply for the County of Aberdeen granted some aid to the de- 
sign. From 1721 to 1735, a custom prevailed of the graduates 
in Arts contributing voluntarily small sums for the same purpose. 
Soon after the late Dr Patrick Copland entered as Professor of 
Natural Philosophy, he turned his attention to the enlargement 
of the apparatus ; and being assisted by a small grant from the 
Board of Trustees for the Encouragement of Manufactures in 
Scotland, he employed an able workman in the construction of a 
great number of models and other apparatus, many of them of 
elegant design. The possession of these allowed him to com- 
mence, in 1786, in addition to the regular course of scientific 
lectures, a popular series of instructions in Experimental Philoso- 
phy, illustrating many of the practical applications of science to 
the arts and the common purposes of life. These he continued, 
at intervals, for many years; and upon his death in 1822, the 
part of the apparatus which was his own property was purchased 
by the College. A catalogue of this apparatus is kept, and on 
removing it lately to the new building, it was for the first tune 
arranged in the order of subjects, the accommodation for it in the 
old edifice having become, from its increase, exceedingly incom- 
modious. •Ml 
The Astronomical Apparatus is another department which will 
benefit considerably from the new edifice, the access to the old 
Observatory having been very inconvenient, and the difficulty of 
keeping the roof water-tight great. The chief instruments are 
an excellent transit, by Ramsden, of 4 feet focus, and 3 inches 
aperture ; a moveable quadrant, of 2 feet radius, divided by 
Ramsden ; and an equatorial, with circles of 18 inches diameter, 
originally made by Sisson, but afterwards divided anew, and an 
achromatic telescope added, by Ramsden. The time-keeper is 
- an excellent instrument, with a gridiron pendulum, by Mariotte- 



MARISCHAL COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY.

There are also the usual auxiliary apparatus, two reflecting tele- 
scopes, and a fine refracting one, double achromatic, by Dollond, 
of 4 feet focus, and 2f inches aperture, with a divided object-glass 
micrometer, by the same artist. 

These instruments were procured by donation or purchase in 
1780 the Earl of Bute giving the transit and equatorial, when 
Dr Copland originated a subscription for setting on foot an Ob- 
servatory, for which the town gave a site on the Castlehill, where 
the building was erected. In 1795, Government requiring the site 
of the Observatory for a powder-magazine to the barracks then erect- 
ing in its vicinity, it was removed to the north wing of the College, 
and a grant of money given in exchange, the greater part of which 
was expended on the new arrangements necessary, and the remainder 
reserved for its maintenance, under the management of the Prin- 
cipal and Professors. A collection of books in astronomical and 
mathematical science is connected with the Observatory, purchas- 
ed with a small fund appropriated to that peculiar purpose by Dr 
Liddel, who founded and endowed the mathematical professorship. 
The late Andrew Mackay, LL. D., was keeper of the Observa- 
tory for some years after its institution ; the present keeper is the 
Professor of Mathematics, but no salary has ever been attached to 
the office.
