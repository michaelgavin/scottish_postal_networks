<p>Names, Situation, River, Hill, iSc. 

THE Gaelic derivation of Inver, in feme of the Sta- 
tiftical Accounts, makes it fignifj the fame as 
Inner, a field fit for tillage. In the low country of 
Scotland, it feems rather to fignify, T/je Mouth of a 
River, or The Confluence of two Rivers ; and if Inverelk 
is not of Celtic original, there is no other name of any 
place in the parifh, that has the lead affinity to that lan- 
guage. Agreeably to this derivation, the name of In- 
veresk marks its fituation on the lower part of the 
river E/k, which falls in two ftreams from the moun- 
VoL. XVI. A tains

pI aid ^"^"'r^'''" '° -'^-turning the 

Point and running between MulTelburgh and FilheLw, 

mile b r . f '^"^ '""^ ^ q-^er of . 

mile below thefe towns. MuJTe^ur^^ has derived its 
name from an extenfive mufcle bank, which lies in the fea 
below the town, and was probably the caufe of its early 
popubtxon ; as, even at this day, it affords a great relief to 
the poorer inhabitants in times of fcarcity, and at all times 
fupphes the tables of the rich with a delicate variety. This 
panfh Les in a femicircular form, on the bottom of the 
deepeft bay on the S. fide of the frith of Forth, the ftrin^ 
of the bow extending two miles and a half, from Mag- 
dalene Bridge on the W. to Ravenlliaw Burn on the E 
Which divides the county of Edinburgh, or Mid-Lothian.' 
from that of Eaft Lothian. The bow. itfelf, taking the 
middle of the ftrmg as a centre, reaches nearly to the fame 
diftance, of 2^ miles from the fea. 

Pro/peas, U'^.— The fituation of this parifli is one of the 
moil beautiful iji Scotland. The low part of it is only a 
few feet above the level of the fea ; between which, and 
the towns of MulTelburgh and Fiftierrow, lie very fpacious 
and pleafant liuks. thofe beautiful downs on the fea-ihore, 
almoft peculiar to Scotland, which furnifli a field for that 
favourite exeicife of the inhabitants, the golf, and dry 
Itvalks at all feafons of the year. Behind this flat or plain, 
fhrough which the rjver runs into the fea, and which is about 

half 



qJ Invere/k,

half a mUe in breadth, there is a fine rifing' ground, which 
begins ^t the eaftem extremity of th« parifh. and extends 
in a fwelUng curve to the hill of Inverefk, where ftand 
the village of that name, and the church of St Michael's. 
The S fide of this hill takes alfo the form of a crefcent, fo 
that all the houfes on that fide have a full view of the 
woods of Dalkeith Park, and the extenfive country to the 
fouth, as weU as of the haugh and river, and theif own 
floping gardens. 

Climate, t'fc.— This fituation makes the village not only 
agreeable, but healthy, and obtained for it of old the name 
of the Montpellier of Scotland. The foil of the plain, efpe- 
cislly about Mufl'elburgh, being remarkably dry, and a 
conftant brilliancy and frefhnefs flowing from the river and 
the adjacent fea, there is a foftnefs and amenity in the air 
through the whole feafon, that is feldom to be met with in 
any other fituation in this northern climate. Beyond the 
village of Inverelk, to the S. E., lie extenfive and well cul- 
tivated fields, bounded at the diftance of two miles, by the 
hills of Falfide and Carberry, which terminate a long fer- 
tile ridge, that beginsfto rife 5 or 6 miles to the eaftward; 
and the latter of which is the higheft ground in this parifli, 
being 540 feet above the level of the fea. To the S. and 
W. of the river, lie fertile fields equally well cultivated, 
terminated by the extenfive park and domain of Dalkeith ; 
a confiderable part of which, Quiz, what was formerly Smea- 
ton and Cajlle jlends), lies in this parifli. 

Antiquities. — The Romans did not fail to obferve the 
fortunate fituation of the hill of Inverelk, which, though 
not more than 50 feet above the level of the fea, commands 
an extenfive view, not only of the adjacent country, but of 
the fpacious bafon of the Frith, which is there about 18 

miles

miles broad, and of the coaft of Fife, from Burntifland to 
the mouth of the Frith. Hiftory affures us, that they had 
a ftation here, and repeated difcoveries * point out the fpot 

where 

^ * At different times Roman coins, and once an altar, with this infcrip- 
tion, Apollint Cranio, have been found in levellbg the adjacent grounds. 
But if there had remained any doubt, concerning the fituation of this Ro- 
man fort, it was fully cleared up a few years ago, when the proprietor of 
the villa had occafion to take two or three feet off the furface of his par- 
terre, when there were difcovered the floors and foundations of various 
buildings. The owner being abfent, attending his duty in Parliament, 
the workmen were prevailed upon, by the author of this account, to clear 
the earth carefully away from one of them, and to leave the ruins ftanding 
for fome time, for the infpecftion of the curious. It was found to be a 
Roman bath of two rooms. The fnperftrudlure had been thrown down 
and removed, but the floor remained entire, and about 6 inches high of 
the wall of the fmalleft room, which was 9 feet long, and 4^ wide. There 
was a commiuTiication through the partition wall for water, by an earthen 
pipe. The other room was 15 feet by 9. The floors of thefe, and of the 
other rooms, were covered with tarras uniformly laid on, about two 
inches thick. Below this coat there was a coarCer fort of lime and 
gravel five inches deep, laid upon unlhapely and unjointed flags. This 
floor Hood on pillars two feet high, fome of fl:one, and fome of circular 
bricks. The earth had been removed to come to a folid foundation, on 
which to eredt the pillars. Under the tarras of the fmalleft room there 
was a coarfer tarras, fully 10 inches thick, which feeraed intended to 
fuftain or bear a more confiderable fire under it, than the li)pocmc/ium of 
the largeft room. There appeared to have been large fires under it, as 
the pillars were injured by them, and there was found a quantity of char- 
coal in perfedt prefervation. 

The ajpocmtjlum of the larger room, or fpace under the tarras'd floor, 
was filled with eauh, and with flews made of clay, which were laid every 
where between the rows of pillars, and were a little difcoloured 
with fmoke; a fmaller degree of heat having been conveyed through 
them, than through thofe under the other room. But thefe contrivances 
under the floors feera only to have been intended to preferve heat in the 
water, which had been carried warm from a kettle, built up or hung on 
brick work, on one fide of the largetl room. This brick work was much 
injured by ftrong fires, and was four feet fquare.

where the Pratorium was built. It was undoubtedly on 
the fummit of the hill where the church now ftands, and 
included that beautiful villa that lies to the eaftward of rt ; 
a hollow road, which, till about 35 years ago, paffed within 
three yards of that viUa, having moft likely been the foffe 
of the prjetorium. It is now included in the garden and 
pleafure ground. The church, of which; the antiquity is 
not known, and which is czWtd. St Michael's of biverejk, 
has probably been built out of the ruins of that ancient 
Roman edifice.— A building of high antiquity was fituated 
at the eaft end of Muffelburgh, which belonged to the 
abbacy of Dunfermline. It was called the Chapel of Lo- 
retto. There are no remains of it now but a fmall cell, 
about 12 feet by 10, covered by a mount, in the garden of 
the gentleman wha is now in poffeffion of the villa called 
Loretto. Soon after the Reformation, about the year 1590, 
the tolbooth of Muffelburgh was built out of the ruins of 

this 



This feenisto have been a kind of building ufed by the Romans only for 
temporary ofe. The cement, or tarras, fufficiently proves by whom it 1 
was made, as the Roman compofition of that kind is fuperior to any of 
later ages. It is remarkable, that the tarras of the grand fewers under 
the city of Rome is of the fame kind; and it is related by travellers, that 
in the very ancient buildings in the kingdom of Bengal, the very fame 
fort has been ufed. Two medals were found among the ruins, now in 
the poffeffion of Robert Colt, Efq; owner of the villa; one of gold, much 
defaced, which is fuppofed to be of Trajan ; another of copper, on which 
the infcriptiou is clear, Diva Faujlina. There arc traditional accounts, 
that in digging foundations of houfes in FiHierrow, there have been found 
fimilar ruins o{ Hypoca'tJIa, which afford a proof, that this ftation was not 
merely military, but was a Colonia Romana or Miiniciphim ; that they had 
many houfes and buildings near the fea, as well as their prajtorium at 
Inverefk ; and that one of their principal harbours on this fide of the 
trith wasatFifherrow. From that harbour, fituated where there is one 
at prefent, there was a Roman caufcway, (the traces of which remained 
witliin the memory of fome ftill living), which led to their camp at 
Sheriff lia'.!, three miles S. W. and onwwds to Borthwick. 



^ Statiflical Account 

this chapel, which n,uft have been of confiderable dimen- 
fions The old ileps of the ftair, which was repaired not 
long fince, were the bafes of the pillars of this chapel, 
according to the report of mafons ftil] living. This is 
feid to have been the firft religious houfe in Scotland, 
whofe rums were appUed to «n unhallowed ufe*, for 
which the good people of Muffelburgh are faid to have 
been annually excommunicated, till very lately, at Rome. 
^ Hiftory affures us. that Randolph Earl of Murray died 
m Muffelburgh of the ftone, in July 133^, and tradition 
points out the houfe where he died, near the eaft end of the 
town, on the fouth fide. It is a vaulted houfe, of two rooms 
on the ground floor ; the rooms are about 14 feet fquare, 
and the arch 8 feet high, with a paffage between them 6 
feet wide. This might well have been the beft houfe in 
the town 460 years ago f . Tradition alfo fays, that the 
inhabitants having formed a guard round the houfe, during 
the illnefs of this great man, they found fuch favour with 
the Earl of Mar, the fucceeding regent, that he granted, or 
obtained for them, their firft charter. 

In this parifti lies the field of the battle ofFuikieX, which 
was fought in the year 1547, when Queen Mary was an 
infant, with fuch difadvantage to the Scots. 

Carberry 

* Till about 30 years ago there was a middle row of houfes eaftward 
from the Tolbooth, oae of which had been a chapel, called Chapel Gavel. 
There were various other old chapels in different fituations ; one in a 
garden in the weft end of Market-gate, and one in New Hailes grounds 
called Magdalene Chapel, near to iVIagd^lene Bridge, of which there are 
now no remains ; befides an aims-houfe in Market-gate, which is now a 
dwelling-houfe.

Carherry HilL—]^^ over the field of battle there is a 
hill, which was ftiU more fatal to Queen Mary, and has 
been known ever fince by the name of the ^leen's Seat. 
It is the top of the hill of Carberry, where that unfortunate 
Princefe fat on a ftone, and held a conference with Kirk- 
caldy of Grange, who had been commiflioned for that pur- 
pofe by the confederate Lords. During this parley. Both- 
well, who had taken leave of the Queen for the laft time, 
rode off the field to Dunbar. As foon as he was out of 
danger, Mary fufFered herfelf to be led by Kirkcaldy to 
Morton and the Lords, who received her with due marks 
of refpe£t, and ample promifes of future loyalty and obe- 
dience. The fequel is well known. From that hour flie 
was deprived of liberty for life, except for the few days 
that intervened, between her efcape from Lochleven Caftle, 
and her furrender to Elizabeth, after the fatal battle of 

Langfide. 

this parifti at the time. It was fought on the field that lies between the 
village of Inverefk and Wallifurd, and Carberry ; and was brought on by 
the ufual impetuofity of the Scots, who would not wait till the Englilli 
army, who were beginning to run fliort of provifions, had been obliged to 
return home. The Scottilh army were encamped on that large field weft 
of the Elk, which went by the name of Edminftone Edge ; tlie Englidi 
lay at the places now called Drummore and Walliford. As the Scots 
paffed the bridge of Muflelburgh, and marched to the field up the hill of 
Inverefk, on the weft fide of the church, there being then no village, and 
only two ftiepherds houfes on that hill, they were annoyed by cannon fliot 
from the Englidi gallies in the bay ; infomuch, that the Lord Graham, 
eldeft fon of the firft Earl of Montrofe, was killed on the bridge, with 
many of his followers. To have croffed the river at any other place, woulfl 
have been ftill more dangerous, as there was then a thick wood on the 
banks of it, all the way to Dalkeith. After pafling the church of Inverelk, 
they mu ft have been covered from the fliot, as the ground flopes from 
thence down to the Hoiu Mire, (in thofe days a morafs, though now 
drained and cultivated), from whence it rifes gently to the bottom of the 
hills of Carberry and Falfide. On this gentle rifing lay the field of ac- 
tion.

Langfide. The bloody field of Pinkie under her eye, might 
have put this ill-fated Queen on her guard. But unfit for 
the rugged times in which fhe lived, fhe had the misfor- 
tmie to be at once facile and obftinate. The late proprie- 
tor of Carberry, John Fullarton, Efq; has marked this fpot 
to poftenty by planting a copfe-wood upon it. 

Bridge.^The bridge of Muffelburgh, over which the 
Spottilli army marched on the day of the battle of Pinkie, 
IS of great, but unknown antiquity. It is moft likely, that 
.itisawork of the Romans, as they certainly had many 
houfes in what is now called Fifherrow, as weU as their 
haven for dipping ; and could not poflibly fufFer their co- 
lony to be divided, and their harbour feparated from their 
fort by % river, that is frequently unfordable for many days 
together. This bridge has many marks of antiquity ; and 
as feveral parts of the arches approach nearly to a ftraight 
hne, the frame, or coom, on which it was raifed, muft have 
funk while it was building. The arches are 50 feet wide, 
their fpring only 10 feet ; whoever built it muft have in- 
tended, to place the approaches to it out of the reach of the 
tide ; which is the cafe to this day, and demonftrates that 
the coaft is not materially changed, or that the fea has not 
gained on the land fince that period, as the fite of the har- 
hour proves that it has not receded from it. 

Ptnhe Houfe. — Pinkie Houfe, though not very ancient, 
(as it was built by Alexander Seton, firft Earl of Dunferm- 
line, in the year 162a), deferves to be mentioned, becaufe 
It was a vulgar notion for many years, that there were as 
many doors and windows in it, as there are days in the 
year. This has been copied into many of the tours and 
travels into Scotland, though without foundation; and 
fcrvfis only to prove, that the houfe of Pinkie, though half 
a the 



of Inverejk,

the defigh has only been executed, was one of the firft 
houfes of any decree of magnitude, in this part of the 
country, as it excited the wonder of the common people. 
The infcription on the front of this houfe * now hid by a 
covered way, points out the humblenefs of the buildmg, or 
the pride of its founder. The gallery is 80 feet long, the 
cieling of which is covered with emblematical pamtmgs 
and infcriptionsf. 

Routing Well.— The Routing Well at Monktoun, that is 
faid always to predlB a ftorm, is a wonder of the fame na- 
ture as the preceding. The cafe is, that this well being dug 
many fathoms deep, through a rock, in order to get below 
the ftrata of coal that abound in the field, it communicates 
through the coal rooms that are wrought, with other ihafts ; 
which occafions a rumbling noife, that does not precede, but 
accompanies a high wind. 

Soil, Surface, Extent, Is-f.— The foil of this parilh varies 
according to its diftance from the fea. The flat ground 
round MulTelburgh and Fiflierrow is fandy, but, having been 
for ages in a high ftate of cultivation for gardens and fmall 
fields, is abundantly fertile. The fields above Inverelk, on 
both fides of the river, are of a better quality, and may foon

t On the forfeiture of the family in 1688, this houfe and barony were 
purchafed by the family of Tweeddale, from whom, intheyeariT7S.it 
was bought by Sir Archibald Hope of Craighall, Bart, and is now a more 
x:omfortable dwelling- houfe than ever. An inclofure of lo acres, covered 
with fine old trees, contiibutes much to its beauty; and the flielter they af- 
ford, together with the aptitude of the foil, form one nf the fineft fruit gar- 
dens in the neighbourhood.

be made as fertile as any in the kingdom. Thofe which 
nfe towards the hil] on the S. E., and which run into New- 
ton panfh on the S. W., partake more of a clay foil, and 
carry great crops of grain, efpecially wheat, when they are 
under proper management. There are 3571 acres of land 
in the panfh, which, at the ufual computation of 45 acres 
for a plough-gate, makes about 80 plough-gates. 

Rent and ProfiHetors.— The real rental of the parilh is 
about L. 6500 ; that of the towns and villages, including the 
mills of MulTelburgh, fait- works, i^c. and the houfes of the 
heritors, as made out to fix an alTeffment for the poor, a- 
mounts to L. 5000 ; total about L. 11,500. The great pro- 
pnetors are 8 in number; viz. xjl, the Duke of Buccleugh, 
who is patron of the parifti, as poffeffing the lordfhip of In- 
verelk, formerly belonging to Sir Robert Dickfon of Car- 
berry, who fold it to the Duchefs of Monmouth about the 
beginning of this century. His Grace holds alfo the lands 
of Smeaton and Caftlefteads, and likewife the lordlhip of 
MulTelburgh in this parilli. His refidence is at Dalkeith 
Houfe. 2. The Earl of Wemyfs, who has the lands of 
Stonyhill, which formerly belonged to Sir William Sharp, 
fon of the Archblfhop of St Andrew's, and before that was

Invereflc, as they are called, or feuars of the barony of Pin-

Min^rfl/^.— There is plenty of freeftone in the parifli, and 
likewife of limeftone, though the laft is not wrought at pre- 
fent. But the moft valuable mines are thofe of coal, which 
lie under the whole parifli. The pits open at prefent are 
. either the property of Sir Archibald Hope, or rented by 
him from the Earl of Wemyfs, and, being well managed, 
arc very produaive. In former times, till the year 1776, 
colliers were in a ftate of flavery in Scotland, which was 
confidered as a difgrace to the Britifti Governnnent. Through 
fome defeft in the aft of Parliament that fet them free, or 
in the management of them fince that period, there has 
fometimes been a great fcarcity of coals, though they can 
earn double the wages of any other labourers. 

Agriculture. — The ftite of agriculture has not yet ar- 
rived at perfedion in this parifli. The fields neareft the

Improvements.— Two other circumftances have contri-

ago, was not more than L. i, or L. i, 5 s. per acre. The 
firft was the dividing, and afterwards inclofing, about 70Q 
acres of land in the fields of Inverelk, the property of many 
different feuers of that Lordlhip, about 35 years ago. The 
fecond was the introduaion of two horfe ploughs without a

ManufaBures, 5i?..-Though this town and pari(h ^re 
remarkably well fituated for manufaaures. having the com- 
mand of water, plenty of coals at hand, cheap houfes, and 
a multitude of idle children, yet hitherto none very confi- 
derable have been eftablilhed. This is perhaps owing 
to their having been at all times carriers and furnifhers 
of various kinds of provifions for the capital, which employ- 
ed them in a manner more agreeable to them, than the fe- 
dentary lives of manufafturers could have been. In the 
end of laft century, a broad cloth manufaftory was begun 
here, and was long carried on in great perfeftion, though 
not to great extent. Some excellent cloth, both coarfe and 
fine, continues ftill to be made here by Meffrs Cathie, 
Stewart, Nichols and Dickfon *. There has lately been

here can now pretend to, is to fumilh the earlieft crops of 
peafe and beans, ^c. for a week or two, as the market, ax-e 
foon filled from the more luxuriant garden grounds nearer 
the city. ConnoiflTeurs in that fort of viand, however ftil], 
prefer the produce of the lighter foil, which is lefs imprer 
n^ated with dung. The whole produce of the gardens, toge- 
ther wuh fait, and fand for walhing floors, and other articles 
till of late that carts have been introduced, were carried in' 
balkets or creels on the backs of women, to be fold in 
Edmburgh, wh. re, after they had made their market, it was 
ufual for them to return loaded with goods, or parcels of va- 
nous forts, for the inhabitants here, or with dirty linens to 
be waflied in the pure water of the Efk. This employment 
of women, which has certainly prevailed ever fince Edin- 
burgh became a confiderable city, when joined to that of 
the filh-wives in Fiflierrow, has occafioned a reverfal of the 
ftate of the fexes in this parilh, and has formed a characler 
and manners, in the female fex, which feems peculiar to

with the fli,;hteft fatigue ; here they work as much as the ftrongeft men ;

females. They go barefooted, and are remarkably adive, carr) ing burdens

j-aJt, l^c. are generally the wives of weavers, llioemakers, 
tailors, or fievemakers, who, being confined by their ena- 
ployments within doors, take charge of the children and 
family, while the females trudge to Edinburgh about their 
feveral branches of bufmefs, long before day in winter, and 
return by mid-day, or later, according to the time fpent in 
felling their commodities. Their ufual daily profits may 
be computed at from 8 d. to i s. 3 d. which, befides the 
free, focial, and difengaged life which they lead, is a greater 
addition to the income of the family, than they could eara 
bj any other branch of induftry.— The women, who carry 
fand to Edinburgh, have the hardeft labour, and earn leaft. 
For they carry their burden, which is not lefs than 200 lb. 
weight, every morning to Edinburgh, return at noon, and 
pafs the afternoon and evening in the quarry, digging the 
ftones, and beating them into land. By this labour, which 
is inceffant for fix days in the week, they gain only about 
J d. a- day. 

The Fi/h-wwes,^^ they are ail of one clafs, and educated 
in it from their infancy, are of a charafter and manners 
ftill more fingular than the former, and particularly di- 
itinguiftied by the laborious lives they lead. They are the 
wives and daughters of fifhermen, who generally marry in 
tlieir own ,caft, or tribe, as great part of their bufinefs, to 
whicli they m,uft have been bred, is to gather bait for their 
hufbands, and bait their lines. Four days in the week, 
however, they carry fifii in creels (ofier balkets) to Edin-

on their heads, which require two men to lift up. The wife yields riot in 
ftrength to the hutband, nor the fifter to the brother ; and after a cheer- 
ful glafs, though heavily loaded, they move on with alacrity, returning 
home in the evening without the appearance of laflitude, often arm and 
arro, dancing and firtging to the tabor and pipe.' This is a very exaift pic-

are. Having fo great a ih are in the maintenance of the: 
family, they have no fmall fway in it, as may be inferred 
from a faying not unufual among them. When fpeakihg 
of a young wotnan, reported to be on the point of mar- 
riage, "Hout!" fay they, " How can' flie keep a maii;' 
" who can hardly maintain herfell ?" As they do the wofic' 
of men, their manners are mafculine, and their ftrength" 
and aftivity is equal to their work. Their amufements 
are of the mafculine kind. On holidays they frequently* 
play at golf ; arid on Shrove Tuefday there is a ftanding 
match at foot-ball, between the married and unmarried wo- 
men, in which the former are always viftors. 

Their manner of life, and the bunnefs of making their' 
markets, whet their faculties, and make them very dex- 
terous in bargain making. They have likewife a fpecies" 
of rude eloquence, an extreme facility in exprefling their" 
feelings by words or gellures, which is very impofirigj and 
enables them to carry their' points even againft the moft 
wary ; and they are too well acquainted with the world, to 
be abafhed when they are detefted in any of their arts *. 
It is remarkable, that though a confiderable degree of li- 
centioufnefs appears in their freedom of fpeech, it does not 
feem to have tainted their morals, in a point where it might 
have chiefly been expedled ; there being no clafs of women, 
it is believed, who offend lefs againft the feventh com- 
mandment, excepting in wbr^/j, than they do. There feems 
to be no employment, that conduces more to health and 
good fpirits than theirs. Some of them have been brought

to bed, and have gone to Edinburgh on foot with their 
balkets w,thm the week. It is perfeftly well afcertained, 
that one, who was delivered on Wednefday morning, went 
^ town with her creel on the Saturday forenoon following. 
Ihere is a charm in the free and aftive life they lead, which 
renders them averfe to all fedentary employments. They 
never wear (hoes or ftockings but on Sundays, which is not 
to be attributed to their poverty, but to the nature of their 
employment. Strangers from the fouth, difgufted at this 
praftice, which more or lefs prevails among the women of 
the inferior clafs in this country, and, ftill more with the 
cuftom of trampling linens in walhing tubs, (which is not 
yet entirely difcontinued. though gradually wearing out), 
cry out againft both as Ihocking pieces of barbarity. It 
may be remarked, however, in regard to the former prac- 
tice, that the Greek and Roman women, (even the ladies 
in the houfe), wore neither flioes nor ftockings. 

From fuch parents, as might be expefted, proceeds a 
race of children, healthy, ' adive, and robuft ; and Lord 
MoNBODDO, and the Lycurguses of the age, will no doubt 
look forward with anxiety to the period, when the work 
that is now done by women, fliall come to be entirely per- 
formed by horfes and carts. For their confolation, how- 
ever, it may be obferved, that we perceive at prefent no 
di^Ference between the children of Muffelburgh and thofe 
of Fiflierrow, where the filhers live. Where the labouring 
poor have enough to feed their children with, there is 
little doubt, that the race will always prove both ftrong 
and numerous.

been batteries of Cromwell's, one to command the bridge, 
and the other to defend his magazine which was in the 
village of Invereflc. Lord Hailes uled to alledge that 
they were of greater antiquity than Cromwell, and might 
have been ramparts of a Roman camp ; but the circum-

of the contrary. 

The ftipend, from 1650 till 1781, was i chalder of wheat, 
I of barley, and i of oats •, and L. 66, i o s. in money. In 
1 781, the prefent incumbent obtained an augmentation, 
and the ftipend is now 2 chalders of wheat, 3 of barley, 
and 3 of oats, paid in money, at the fiars of Mid-Lothian, 
and L.62 in money, including communion- elements. There 
is likewife a glebe of si acres inclofed by the prefent in- 
cumbent, together with a houfe and garden, and a field be- 
fore the houfe, making in all an acre, which were given by 
the town of Muffelburgh to the minifter of the parifli, when 
the manfe was built in 1681 ; for an addition to which field, 
made in 1758, he pays is. yearly of feu-duty. Since 
1702 there has been an affiftant probationer, for whom there 
is a very flender fupport, out of certain funds allotted for 
that purpofe. The Duke of Buccleugh is patron of the parilh. 

Burgh. — Muffelburgh is a very ancient burgh of Rega- 
lity *, and was once called Muffelhurgh-Jhire. The mill, 
Vol. XVL D to 

dug, as deep as 7 feet below the furface of the church-yard, and 11 be- 
low the top of the mount, there were found many humau bones in full 
prefervation, which feems to furnifli proof that the ramparts had been 
erecfted fince the field was inclofed for a church-yard. 

* Before the Reformation, it was an ecclefiaftical burgh belonging, 
htter alia, to the abbacy of Dunfermline. It was disjoined by King , 
James VI. from that abbacy, and given in donation to one of the family 
of Lauderdale : and when the whole 'abbacy was given to Queen' Anr^ 
«f Denmark, flie reclaimed the regality of Muffelburgh, as comprehended

Muffelburgh is an ancient ecclefiaftical and incorporate 
burgh holden of the Lord Superior of the Regality, who is 
now the Duke of Buccleugh, on payment of certain fums 
annuaUy as quit-rent or feu-duty. The territories of the 
Burgh extend along the fea-coaft, the whole length of the 
panfh, and are about two meafured miles and a half in 
length, and from one half to one fourth of a mile in breadrt. 

Charters.~i:h^ moft ancient charter of this bnrgh now 
extant is dated December ii. 1562, and is granted by Ro- 
bert Commendator of Dunfermline, with confent of the 
whole members of the convent. It narrates, ' That the 
" title-deeds belonging to the burgh were burnt by their 
"enemies the Englilh, after the fatal battle of Pinkie- 
« therefore they of new grant, difpone, and confirm to the 
« prefent bailies, community and inhabitants of Mufel- 
« burgh, and to their fucceffors," ^c. which is not incon-

by means of their attention to Randolph Earl of Murray,' 
Who died in their town. This charter is confirmed by

Of thij regaliry and parilh have been disjoined, and added to the pariflics

Government, ^r.-The town-council confifts of 18 
members, 10 being elefted from Muffelburgh, and 8 from 
FiQierrow. The whole regality in this divifion is confi- 
dered as Filherrow, except what is within the ancient 
ports of Muffelburgh. Out of thefe, two bailies and a 
treafurer are annually ekaed, but may not be re-elefted 
more than two years without intermiffion. Two coun- 
cillors go off annually by a vote of the council, and two 
are chofen in their room by the fame body. Their reve- 
nue is now very confiderable, arifing from feu-duties paid 
by the proprietors of all the houfes in their .territories, and 
from their lands arid mills, and the ftore-dues of their 
harbour. The two lad are of a fluftuating nature, and 
have increafed of late, the one on account of their good 
ftate, and the other by means of the great refort of fhipping 
with grain for the diftiUery. Were the ktt to be given 
up, the dues of the harbour would have little elfe to fup- 
port them but fifhing boats, and the bufmefs of the two or 
three timber and iron merchants fettled there, which in- 
deed is confiderable. The annual revenue of the town is 
not lefe than L. 1500.— The magiftrates, by their title- 
deeds are empowered to hold a court of record, and iffue 
precepts both on their decrees and regiftrations. They are 
empowered to grant infeftment by hafp and ftaple, more 
hurgi ; but their clerk is not entitled to a protocal record 
of infeftments, as in burghs royal. Their infeftments 
muft be recorded in the county regifter ; but being an in- 
corporated burgh, under that title it is excepted out of

privileges of any royal burgh in Scotland, except thofe of 
yoMng for a member of Parliament, and fending a dele- 
gate to the Convention of Burghs. 

Archerj.—ThtTt is an ancient filver arrow in this town, 
Which ,s fl,ot forannually by theRoyal Company of Archers. 
The vidlor receives L. i, ,o s. Sterling from the town, and 
a riddel fuH of claret, viz. one dozen, and is bound to ap- 
pend a medal of gold or filver to the arrow, before the 
next year's annual meeting. The earliea date of any of 
the medals is 1603 ; but there are a few that are more an- 
cient without a date. This ancient mode of warfare ha- 
ving gone into difufe, fince the invention of fire arms, was 
likely to have fallen into total oblivion, had it not been 
for thofe ancient prizes eftablifhed in different parts of the 
kingdom, which preferved the remembrance of it ; but it 
has been lately revived in Edinburgh, and other cities and 
towns in England, as well as in Scotland, and has become 
an exercife as fafliionable as it is manly. Archery is an 
exercife peculiarly well fuited to large cities, where young 
gentlemen of various profeffions have neither leifure nor 
opportunity for the diverfions of the chace and the field.

* In the year 1631, Muflelburgh was, by a charter under the great 
feal, eredled into a royal burgh ; but the magiftrates of Edinburgh ob- 
tained a decreet of redudlion of that charter before the privy-council, 
dated November 30. 1632, in confequence of a compromife with the ma- 
giftrates of Muflelburgh.

trained to k in their early days, being enticed by the beau- 
of the hnks, (which lie on each fide of the nver^be- 

of the Canongate. whofe former refidence in Holland has enabled him t. 
eive a very fatisfadory defcription of that game. 

' The Dutch ga.e called Kolf, from which the word Go.. . derived 
as Ith are probably from the Greek word, .oxo.oc, is playe an xnclo ed 
r aangular area of about 60 feet by 25. The floor, whxch is a compofx- 
Ln of fan . clay, and pitch, is.made as level as a billiard table and the 
nclofing walls Le fort.o feet above the floor, faced either wUh pohfhed 
Itone. or fl.eet lead, that they may caufe the ball rebound w^h accuracy 
At about 8 orio feet from each end wall, a circular poft of about 5 
inches diameter is placed precifely in the middle of the area -th regard 
To breadth, confequently oppofite the one to the other, and at the dxftance 
of 40 feet or thereby. The balls ufed in the game are about the fize of 
cricket balls, made perfedlly round and elaftic, covered with foft leather, 
and fewed with fine wire. The clubs are from three to four feet long 
with ftifF lhafts. The heads are of brafs, and the face, with which the ball 
is ftruck, is pcrfedlly fmooth, having no inclination, fuch as might 
have a tendency to raife the ball from the ground. The, angle, which the 
head makes with the Qiaft. is nearly the fame with that of the ^««/«^ 
clubs ufed at golf. The game may be played by any number, either xa 
parties againft each other, or each perfon for himfelf; and the conteft is. 
who fliaUbitthe two pofts in the feweft ftrokes, and make his ball re. 
treat from the laft one with fuch an accurate length, as that it (l.all 
lie neareft to the oppofite end wall of the area. The firft ftroke is made 
from within a few inches of what is called the heginning pojl, and the 
player Aireffci his ball as precifely as he can on the oppofite one, that he 
may hit it if poflible, computing at the fame time the force of his ftroke, 
fo that, (hould he mifs it. (which from the diitance may be fuppofed to be 
moft frequently the cafe), his ball may rebound from the end wall, and lie 
within a moderate diftance of the poft. and before it. i. e. between the two 
pofts. rather than between the poft and the end wall. The reafon of pre 
ferring this fituation of the ball, will appear by refledling how much'eafier 
it is in that cafe to fend the ball, after ftriking the poft, back again towards 
the other one. The fkill of the game confifts in ftriking the poft in fuch 
^ way. whether full or otherwife. as may fend the ball towards the place 
where you wilh it to reft. It combines the addrefs required both in golf 
and in billiards. Five points make the game ; and fuch is the difference 
between a capital and »n ordinary player, that the former will give four

example of their parents. To preferve the taft for th^ 
ancent d.verfion, a company of gentlemen, about xs" 
ago purchafed a filver cup, which is played for annu ,; 

of the v.aor, who ,s obliged to append a medal to it, when 
he reftores :t to the company. The inhabitants of MufTel- 
burgh had need to watch over this precious field for health 
and exerc: e left .n fome unlucky period the magiftrates 
and councU fl.ould be induced to feu it out, on preLe of 
increafing the revenue of the town. At prefent it is a 
common, to which every burgefs has a right of pafturage ■ 
although part of it has already been let off in feu, which 
has made the entry to the town, both from the eaft and 
weft, lefs free and open than it formerly was, and greatly 
decreafed the beauty and amenity of the place. 

Education.-i:\,^rt is now, and there has long been a 
flounfhmg grammar fchool in this place, under the patro 
nage of the magiftrates and town-council, (with the mini- 
fter) ; who, upon an agreement with the heritors of the pa- 
nfh, fettled a falary on the matter, payable out of their 
funds, ^n lieu of which they accepted of the dues arifing from

jplay I experienced myfelf at a kolf haan near the Hague, aftei" I had con- 
flderable pradticc in the game, and was, in fadl, no mean player. With 
the advantage of three points I was completely beaten, and even when I 
got four, I could hardly preferve any tolerable equality. 

A great advantage of the game of kolf is, that it can be played at alf 
feafons, and in all weather, as the place is as clofe as a houfe, while, at 
the fame time, by opening the windows, which are very large, you may 
have a fufficieney of air. There is generally a kind of apartment at one 
end of the kolfbaan, two or three fteps higher than the floor, where fpec- 
tators may enjoy the light of the game, as faf as the clouds of tobaccs 
fmoke, with which they commonly fill it, will alloir.

difpofal of the heritors. The fchoolmafter has a falary of 
L.28 per annum, and a good houfe and garden. The 
town-council and principal inhabitants have lately en. 
abled their laft incumbent, who in his younger years had 
a flourilhing fchool, to retire on a penfion ; and Mr John 
Taylor, from Kelfo, has been appointed in his room, with 
fo much approbation of the public, that his houfe is alrea- 
dy filled with boarders. This town is confidered as in fo 
healthy a fituation, and is fo convenient for education, (ha- 
ving the advantage of eafily procuring the beft mailers . 
from Edinburgh, for the French and Italian languages, 
mufic, drawing, and other accompllfliments), that of late 
years boarding fchools for young ladies have met with 
great encouragement. At prefent there are two of much ' 
eminence, of which Mifs Grant and Mifs Primrofe are go- 
verneffes ; befides a third at a lower board, by Mifs Neil- 
fon, who merits and meets with encouragement. There are 
feveral very good writing matters in the place •, and Mr Tho- 
mas Salmon, teacher of dancing, has been eftabliftied here 
for more than 30 years, and continues to teach with increa- 
ling reputation. While the mailers and miftreffes of thofe 
fchools preferve their reputation for ability, diligence, and 
tender care of the children, and continue to admit boarders 
and fcholars at areafonable rate, the additional advantages of 
fituation cannot fail to procure them full employment. By 
means of the bounty of the Duchefs of Buccleugh, and 
the contributions of fome pious and charitable ladies of the 
parifti, there have been Sunday's fchools for thefe three 
years, both in MulTelburgh and Fiftierrow ; which, though 
unneceflary in general in Scotland, where the parifli 
fchools are fulEcient, yet are of much utility here, where, 
on account of the poverty and conftant occupations of the 
parents, the inftruftion of many children was neglefted.

Surgeons mjeafes, ^..-There are four furgeons in this 
panlh, who, having been all well educated to their pro- 
leffion, are, according to the mode of the country, confulted 
and confided in as phyficians, except in extraordinary 
cales, when doftors graduate are called from Edinburgh • 
Which, being fo nigh at hand, is the reafon why no phyfi- 
cian has ever fettled here. The parilh is remarkably 
healthy. Epidemical diftempers are feldom fatal, except 
the fmall-pox, which now and then fweeps away too many 
children. Inoculation is by no means univerfal, which is 
probably owing to the influence the fe^aries have over 
the minds of their neighbours ; an obfervation that is de- 
rived from a perufal of many of the Statiftical Accounts 
already publiflied. They have, neverthelefs, great en- 
couragement to extend the praftice, as one of the furgeons, 
who has not been fettled here above 3 years, has inoculated 
above 200, without having loft one. The havock hitherto 
made by the fmall pox, however, cannot be very great, 
as during the whole courfe of thefe 40 years laft, (the fu- 
neral records of which the writer of this account has exa- 
mined), the higheft average for 12 years is 139, and the 
greateft number in any one of thefe years is only 219. 
Forty years ago, there were but three perfons in the parifh 
■who had ever been troubled with the gout, and two of 
thofe were not natives. At prefent they are chiefly ftran- 
gers who are troubled with that difeafe. The gravel is 
alfo rare, which may be owing to the goodnefs of the wa- 
ter, or /ather to that new brifk fmall beer without hops, 
which is the common beverage of the people ; though not 
fo much as it was formerly, as the twopenny has degene- 
rated ; and cheap whiflcy, that bane of the health and mo- 
rals of the people, has been fubftituted in its room. Nothing 
feems more worthy of the attention of the Legiflature, than 
thofe circumftances, ho\yever minute, which tend to cor- 
rupt the morals of the commons of this country, who have 
fo long been remarkable for fobriety and virtue.

Longevity, -Thtr^ are always many a^ed people in this 
parifh, and what is of more importance, they preferve 
their vigour and their faculties to the laft. There are, 
and have been many women paft fourfcore, who travel to 
Edinburgh with their creels, and return by midday; 
men of the fame age are many of them not paft la- 
bour; and there are a few perfons at prefent livmg m,this 
parifh, who, though approaching to 90, are as ftout and 
livelv as fome others of threefcore *. The oldeft perfon 
nowUving is a woman of 94, -v^ho carried the creel m h^r 
youth, and ftill fpip.s. 

Law.—T\\trc is but one refident writer or attorney in 
the parifh, who is the town-clerk. As all the fmall caufes 
commence at the town-court, the parties in general are in- 
duced to acquiefce in the flrft judgment, whether they 
think it right or wrong, as there is no advice at hand to 
tempt them to carry it farther. Cuftom has taught them 
to fubmit to the firft decifion, which happily prevents the 
entail of feuds and endlefs litigation upon them. 

Morals and Manners.— The people of this parifli are 
not free from fuch vices, as are incident to perfons in their 
lituation. The faults that are attached to dealers in fmall 
articles are not uncommon among them, but great crimes 
are very rare. Large cities are the nurferies of crimes, as 
they furnifh the means of privacy and concealment, as 
well as of temptation. But populoias villages, if not fa- 
vourable to fome of the virtues, are at leaft difcouraging 
to fcandalous vices ; becaufe, in fo clofe a neighbourhood, 
every aftion is perfeftly known, and there is no cenforial 
power half fo eifeaual as the opinion of equals. Few great

though not fo gentle and mild as might be expeded from the

* No perfon has been convidled of a capital felony fince the year I72S, 
when the famous Maggy Dickfon was condemned and executed for child- 
jnurder in the Grafs-market of Edinburgh, and was reftored to life in a 
cart, on her way to Muflelburgh to be buried. Her hiifband had been 
alsfent for a year, working in the keels at Newcaaie, when Maggy fell 
vith child, and to conceal her fhame, was tempted to put it to death. 
She kept an ale-houfe in a neighbouring parifli for many years after flie 
came to life again, which was much reforted to from curiofity. But Mar- 
garet, in fpite of her narrow efcape, was not reformed, according to the ac- 
count given by her cotemporaries, but lived, and died again, in profligacy. 
For 25 years paft the Stool of Repentance, that relldl of Popery, has been 
difcontinued in this paridi, and one ftrong temptation to this crime of 
child-murder, which formerly prevailed fo much, has been withdrawn. 
This branch of penance has been too long a difgrace to the country, and 
highly degrading to a refpedlable body of men, who fat monthly in 
judgment, with little elfe to do, than to find out the fathers of the chil- 
dren oflicentious women. It had a ftill worfe efledl than that of degra- 
ding the clergy, as it imprefled on the minds of the people an idea, tliat 
there is no other crime great enough to deferve ecclefiaftical cenfures, 
but fornication. 



f No change has ever been more complete and rapid, than that of man- 
ners, in many refpedls, within thefe 40 years. In the beginning of that 
period, penny bridals, promifcuous dancing, and cards and die? weie 
abfented from and fliunned by the grave, becaufe they had been prohibi- 
ted in the adls of Aflemblies of an ancient date. Clergymen, in thofe 
days, were fomctirnes libelled for dancing and playing at cards, even in 
private houfes ; as well as for fliavii^g or drefling their hair, or dining in a 
neighbouj's houfe on the Lord's day. Happily thofe fiiiilkus vices, an eafy 
abftinence from which gave credit to the whole train of artificial virtues 
in a falfe and hypocritical charatfler, are now no more; and clergymen 
and their families are on the fame footing in refpedl to all innocent aniufc.

confiftent with the dignity and gravity of the clerical charadler. 

It is well known, that the manners of a people are (Ironger than thofe 
laws which pretend to regulate them, when fuch regalat.ons are founded 
on falfe principles. Of this there is a recent e;£araple, which, being hard- 
ly of importance enough to enter into general hiitory, may not impro- 
perly be recorded here. 

Many perfons now alive muft remember with what a fit of zeal and 
hypocrify. (for they were mingled), the minds of great numbers were 
feized, when the tragedy of Douglas was firll adted in Edinburgh, in 
December 1756. That play is now of the moft ellabli(hed reputation, 
and is juflly and univerfally admired as one of the moll excellent compo- 
fitions in the Engli(h language. On occafion of its jfirft appearance on 
the theatre, a few clergymen, about feven or eight who were particular 
friends of the author, in order to give him countenance, once or twica 
attended the reprefentation of it, a praflice at that time not prevalent, 
though not altogether unufual. Such a ftorm was inftantly raifed againft 
thofe clergymen, that one would have thought that religion and morals 
had then received a mortal blow, although plays had been frequented 
for a long period in Edinburgh, by many people of the moft unexception- 
able characters, without animadverfion of any kind ; and though fevcral 
of the moft eminent clergymen were well known to have attended the 
theatre, when occafionally in London, 

The prelbytery of Edinburgh and the prelbytery of Glafgow met again 
and again on the fuhjed ; wrote warm letters to the ieveral prelbyteries, 
to whom any of the offending clergymen belonged, infifting on their pro- 
ceeding againft them, and bringing them to condign piinifhment,; emit- 
ted admonitions and exhortations againft the offenfivc pradtice, and or- 
dered them to be read in all the churches within their bounds. la every

irely regulated hy the rates at Edinburgh, with which

that time, the offence was done away in the moft private manner by the 
feveral prefbyteries who had been wrote to. But even the General Af- 
fembly was induced to make a declarato. j adl ag:.inft the ftage, enjoining 
all preftyteries to take care that none of the minijiers of this church do ufon 
any occafion attend the theatre. In Ihort. the country was excited into a 
flame on this trifling occafion, though not quite fo ftrong and extenfive, 
yet fimilar to that which was raifed 23 years afterwards in oppofition te 
the Popifli bill. 



This violent explofion of zeal, which certainly does no honour to the 
annals of the church, was not wholly owing to the offence taken by 
fome well meaning people. It was well known that fome lhare of poli- 
tical enmity was added to it, which ferved to ble^ld parties together in a 
manner theretofore unknown on fo flight an occafion. The fpirit of ec- 
clefiaflical faftion likewife mingled deeply in it, and contributed to in- 
creafe the clamour, in order to fix a ftigma on certain clergymen, who 
were looked upon with a jealous eye, by fome who then adled as leaders 
of the church. 

But what was the fequel The plans of ecclefiaftical intrigue were 
unveiled, and funk into contempt. The courfe of public fentiment and 
manners becoming gradually more liberal, proved too ftrong for fuch 
narrow and bigotted principles. Mr John Home, the author of the tra- 
gedy in queftion, the fuperior merit of which was already generally ac- 
knowledged, having new views opened up to him, demitted his charge in 
the month of June 1757, and withdrew from the church without the leafl 
animadverfion on his conducfl. In a few years clergymen from many 
different parts of the country, as well as fome in town, occafionally at- 
tended the theatre, and feveral of the moft refpetflable minifters continue 
to do fo, not only without any cenfure from the church, but without any 
fort of offence being given or taken.

tTiere is an almoft hourly communication. The fiftiwives 
will rather take their chance of a market in that city, than 
fell their fifh at a reafonable price here ; infomuch, that 
the people of this pariih are chiefly fupplied by women 
from Preftonpans, who are too diftant to go and return 
with their burdens daily to Edinburgh ; and who, when 
they have not filh from their own boats, are glad to pur- 
chafe them when they can get them at Fiftierr6w, and di- 
ftribate them among the opulent families here. Notwith- 
ftanding all this, fiih was long a cheap article here, till 
the demand at Edinburgh increafed, and the haddocks left 
our coafts about fix or feven years ago. Fortunately they 
have again returned in fraall numbers about the time of 
drawing up this account, namely in June 1793. The only 
article we have cheaper than at Edinburgh is coals, which 
15 owing to our vicinity to the pits ; and the only articles 
we have, perhaps, of better quality, are the produce of 
the garden and bread. This laft advantage we owe to our 
lying between Edinburgh, and the beft wheat farms in 
Eaft Lothian, from whence our bakers are fupplied. The 
bakers here, about 50 or 60 years ago, more than half fur- 
niflied Edinburgh and Leith with wheat bread, and ftill 
continue to vend a confiderable quantity there, notwith- 
flanding their paying higher mill dues than are paid any 
■where elfe ; but they have cheaper houfes and firing than 
can be had in the city, which more than compenfates them 
for the high price of mealing. It muft be obferved, how- 



ever, 



not likely to abufe fucli a privilege, it may well be prefumed that occa- 
fional accefs to the theatre, efpecially when the moft eminent adlors have 
appeared, has contributed to improve their ftyle and pronimciation, and 
to banilh from the pulpit that ruftic vulgarity with which it was once 
reproached.

ever, that a confiderable quantity of Edinburgh bread h 
alfo vended here. The neceffaries of life are no doubt 
much dearer than they were thirty or forty years ago, but 
the wages of labour have increafed in a much greater pro- 
portion. For 12 years preceding 1760, the price of beef 
here by agreement was d. for one half of the year, and 

3 d. for the other half. It is now at the rate of 3^ d. and 

4 d. But the wages of labour have, in moft cafes, been 
more than doubled fince that period ; fo that the inferior 
clafTes, who fubfift by their labour, and are underftood 
chiefly to ufe the neceffaries of life, and not its luxuries, 
have no ground of complaint. On the contrary, their 
condition is much improved, efpecially as the taxes do not 
extend to many articles of their confumption. Soap, can- 
dles, and leather are the only neceffaries that are taxed 
which are within their reach. If they -W/Zhave whilky, 
it is fit they Ihould pay for it. Malt liquor is ftill very 
cheap, ^//z;. li: d. per pint, or 2 Englifti quarts, though it 
muft be owned, it is inferior in quality to what it for- 
merly was, on account of the high price of barley; which, 
it is to be hoped, may not be of long continuance, as the 
firft very good crop may reduce it as much as was done ia 
the year 1779. 

If any clafs of men have ground of complaint amidft the 
high profperity of their country, it is thofe of ranks fu- 
perior to the labourers and artifans, who, having fixed fa- 
laries, or unimprovable livings, cannot now afford to live 
as they have formerly done ; many articles for the table, 
befides butcher's pieat, which has been raifed above one 
fourth, having been doubled or tripled within thefe 40 
years. But ftill it is more owing to the change in the 
modes of living, than to the increafed price of prbviiions, 
that difficulties are incurred ; for this creates a ncceffity of 

its

its kind. How few h.ve philofophy or fortitude enough 
to live in a ftyle inferior to their ^neighbours and equals . 
When all are equally poor, none but fpendthrifts are ever 
• in diftrefs. As the wages of labour are more than doubled, 
the manner of living is entirely changed. Until about the 
year 1760, the working people ufed no bread but oatcaKes. 
Since that time, however, the ufe of wheaten bread has 
been increafing ; and now, bread made of oat meal is not to 
be met with, but in houfes of gentlemen as a rarity. At 
the period before mentioned, working people ufed little 
meat but faked mutton in winter. Salt herrings too made 
grfeat part of their kitchen, (opfonium), a- word that here 
fignifies whatever gives a relifti to bread or /)orr/^^f ; the 
laft of which is not yet in difufe, but ftill continues, with 
milk or ale, to make the breakfafts and fuppers of children 
and apprentices. Through the year frelh or new killed 
beef is now fubftituted for falted. 

M«r^ff^.— There is a market for butcher's meat in 
Muffelburgh every Friday, and one in FiOierrow every 
Tuefday. There is a much greater number of animals 
killed here, than are confumed in the pariQi, to the amount 
of fome hundreds of ftieep weekly in the feafon, and a 
proportional number of black cattle, lambs, calves, and 
hogs. But they are chiefly for the fupply of the markets 
of Edinburgh and Leith, which are frequented by our but- 
chers. From this it may be inferred, that our provifions 
are equally good with theirs, excepting fome choice beafts 
that mufl fall to the ftiare of the Edinburgh butchers. Veal 
too muft be excepted, which is rarely good here, and has 
lately degenerated. Our pork, which is chiefly purchafed 
from the farmers of Eaft Lothian, is remarkably fine ; and 
our lamb is fuperior in quality, as the butchers have inclo- 
|iires at hand, in which they are kept till they arc wanted.

ment was cor.tinued ; and as the towns were populous, it was thought no" 
more than juftice that they fhould contribute their fliare. They accordingly 
were aff.fTed of a certain fum by the annual meeting of heritors and eider, 
which was proportioned among them by a large committee of the inhabi' 
tants appointed by the meeting. By this means thofe who frequented any 
of the meeting- houfes, or abfented altogether from public worlhip were 
made to contribute their fliare, as well as thofe who regularly attended 
the Eftablifted Church, and paid both by their colledlions and by affefT. 
ment. 

At the end of 30 years, many difficulties having occurred from the back- 
xvardnefs of fome to pay their afTeflnKnts, and a conftant intrigue among 
the inhabitants about fumilliing necediiries. or employing the poor the 
moll difinterelled among the manager., became heartily tired of the bufi

which, together %vith an opinion, that the poor could be maintained cheaper 
m their own houfes than in the poors houfc. induced the heritors ani all

as leaves them but in a very wretched flate, when they are 
entirely paft their induftry : and were it not for private 
charities, or fublidiary funds, muft be wholly infufficient to 
fupport nature. The fum laid on for the fupport of the 
poor has for fome time been L. 215, of which above L. 65 
is paid from the colleftions ; which have fallen fo much fhort 
of the deburfements on account of bad payments, and con- 
troverfies that have arifen, that the heritors and feffion have 
been obliged to encroach on the price they received for the 
poors-houfe. Of late years it has been thought proper to 
follow the direftions formerly given by the Sheriff of the 
county, and to lay on the afleffment for the poor, according 
to a rental of all property in the parifli, as the moft certain 
and equal rule t by which to levy the poor's funds. Various 

difficulties 



* For eight or ten years after the houfe was firft occupiexl by the poor* 
they were maintained at the very cheap rate of i s. d. per week a piece. 

f It is remarkable, that not a few of the clergy in their Statiftical 
Accounts, exclaim againft the change, that of late years has been made in 
many parifties, in their method of maintaining the poor, which has not 
been entirely by collecflions at the church doors, as formerly, but partly by 
afleflments, and thence take occafion to warn their country againft poors 
rates as a heavy burden, that even England is not able to bear. But thefe 
writers do not feem to have fufficiently attended to the altcintions in the 
ftate of the country in general, and of many parifhes in particular, within 
this half century. They feem not to have adverted to it, that the poor 
have increafed, and that the weekly coUedlions have been diminiftied, for 
various reafons, in many parifties during that period, while the expence of 

maintaining any poor perfon has neceffarily increafed, with the increafed 

prices of labour, and tlie neceflarics of life. 
It cannot be denied, that where the colleftions are fuflRcient for the pur- 

pofe, there is no plan for the maintenance of the poor that can be com-

fe(rments,or/oorj.mfw,as they are frequently called, per in-vi,Unm ; be- 
caufe that is a terra that ought to occafion no fmall alarm, though in- very- 
material refpeds, they are entirely different from the tax of that name in 
England *. Thofe affeffments, when recourfe muft l.e had to them, ought in 
juftice and common fenfe to be as equally and fairly laid on as poff.ble. la 
country pariflies, where there are no other inhabitants, but landhBlders and 
their tenants and cottagers, when the colledlions are infufficient, the bur. 
-Jen muft fall upon the land, that is, on the heritors and their tenants, be- 
caufe the cottagers are unable to pay. But in large towns fuch as 'this 
where the rents of houfes and other rentable property are equal to that of the 
land rent, it would be quite unreafonable and unjuft to throw the whole 
burden on the land ; and no rule feems to be more equal than the rental 
deducing a fourth for repairs, and always exempting the houfes below a 
certain fum, to vary according to the circumftances of the place. I know 
few fubjeds, that more deferve the attention of all men of property of this 
country, landed or otherwife, than the maintenance of the poor. At pre- 
fent, when they are paft their labou-r, they are wretchedly ill fupported' in 
towns,, though nothing can be laid to the charge of the adminiftrators for 
the poor, who manage their fcanty funds with the utmoft frugality. Were 
it not for the great number of focieties in this, and in other pariflies of like 
defcription, who, by means of weekly fubfcriptions of fmall fums, raife a 
fund for aid to their members, when they are laid off their work by lick- 
nefs, or for annuities to their widows after their deceafe, the poor would 
become a much heavier load on the opulent than they are at prefent. 

There are many ufeful. hints and obfervations- on this fubje(5l in the dif. 
ferentStatiflical Accounts; and none, that the writer of this article has obfer- 
ved, better than thofe that are to be found in the account of the parifli of 
Portmoak, (vol. 5. p. 136). It mufl be obferved,. however, that the author, 
after having ftated the difadvantages that arife from a legal provifion, im- 
mediately propofes to have the fubfcriptions of focieties authorifed by law 
which feems to be making them liable to thofe very difadvantages which 
he had juft fluted. For the method ho approves of feemj? little dijOTerent

cularly whether milh and coal rents were legally fubjea to 
them, law-fuits have been carried on, which ftill remain 
undecided at the end of five years. This proves either that 
the laws on the fubje£l are very defeftive, or that law pro- 
cedure is more dilatory than could have been expefted, m 
matters that relat« to the police of the country.— Notwith- 
flanding the difficulty there is in providing for the ordinary 
poor, it muft be owned, that perfons of condition in this 
parifli, (not to mention the family of the patron, which re- 
fides half the year in the neighbourhood, and is a never- 
failing fource of beneficence to all proper objefts), are al- 
ways ready to relieve the wants of the indigent, who are 
not on the ordinary roil. 

Advantages. — The parifli of Irivereflc has every advan- 
tage in point of air and climate, that is to be found in any 
fituation fo fax north. It is pleafant and healthy^ and none 

but 

from that eftablifhed here, vi%. an afleflment on all the inhabitants, except 
the pooreft clafs, by a rental ; excepting only in this, that it is not under 
the authority of law. The one is hitherto voluntary, and the other is not. 
But experience teaches us, that no contribution remains longjnft and equal, 
that is 'voluntary. Perhaps it may be w ile, in many cafes, to give up the 
former, for the fake of the greater energy of the latter. What the writer 
hereof w&amp;uld humbly fuggell to the leading people of this country is, a 
well'digefted poors law ; and in the mean time, he would earneftly call the 
attention of rcfiding heritors to the care of the poor, who fhould have two 
objedlsconftantly in their eye, ift, Acomfortable provifionfor fuch asarepaft 
•'their labour, and for cbildren ; and 2dly, Good economy, and the moft equal 
and impartial method of raifing the funds. Where the Sundays coUedlions 
are fufficient, nothing can be fuperadded to the care and vigilance, the dif- 
intereftednefs and frugality of the elders of the refpedlive parifties, but a 
little more infpeftion and encouragement than is ufual on the part of the 
heritors.

but thofe who are difpofed to be idle can want employ- 
ment. Their fubferviency to the city of Edinburgh for 
many neceflary articles furniflies conftant bufinefe to the in- 
duftrious, and a ready market for every thing they carry 
there. As there are no great manufaaories eftabliflied in 
the parifh, there is no fhdden fluduation between riches 
and poverty, and confequently no great hopes or fears are 
excited ; and no great rilks are run in the humble, but fteady 
and fafe employments, in which the bulk of the people are 
engaged. They are in general contented and unambitious, 
and would always be fo, did not their conftant intercourfe 
with the capital, which is of fo much advantage to them in 
other refpefts, expofe them to the falfe arts of indefatigable 
feducers, who, under pretence of Reform, wilh to fubvert 
the prefent happy government, and introduce democratical 
anarchy in itsftead. They have all the pleafures of an ex- 
tenfive fociety, and of a conftant intercourfe with ftrangers, 
which has the efFeft of exciting fecial affe£tions, and intro- 
ducing urbanity among them. Being the inhabitants of a 
very ancient burgh, and many poffeffors of tenements ha- 
ving enjoyed them from father to fon for hundreds of years, 
there is a kind of noblejfe, fo to call them, among the 
burghers, who think themfelvcs entitled to more refpedt 
than the reft, and who often deferve and obtain it. Add 
to this, that here may be learned all the neceffary arts or 
trades, and likewife the rudiments of a liberal education, 
to qualify the youth of both fexes for the feveral lines of 
life in which they may be engaged, at lefs expence, and 
with lefs danger of the infedlion of bad company and exam- 
ple than in large cities.

Lge coaches eftablifhed here, or in thofe that pafs from

Bifadvantages.-Th^r^ are few or no difadvantages to 
v^hich this place is liable, that are not common to many 
other burghs of the fame defcription, and which chiefly arife 
from a defeftive and carelefs police. This is owmg to the 
magillrates being too much on a level with the other 
burghers, and too dependent on the good will of the popu- 
lace for their livelihood, which checks their exertion of au- 
thority, and makes them timid in the execution of the 
laws *. There is one horrid nuifance, which was formerly 

almoft 

* AboYe 30 years ago, there were a few independent gentlemen admit- 
ted to the council and magiftracy, who gave a beginning to a ftridler me- 
thod of police, and who paid due attention to markets, and weights, an* 
meafures, and to the cleaning of the ftreets and lanes, and the fuppreffion of 
vagrants, and who, notwithftanding, preferved their popularity with all 
ranks. Had their plans been followed out, this village, confidering the 
great rife in their revenue fince that period, muft have been the moft com- 
modious and inviting place to live in of any in Scotland. It is the more 
inconceivable in them, to preclude thcmfelves from the weight and energy 
pf perfons of the above defcription, that they have no political power, not 

being

almoft entirely abollfhed, which now prevails more than 
«ver ; that ,s, the killing animals in the ftreets ; a praftice 
contrary to law, moft unwholefome, and highly ofFenfive. 
Confidering that the place is fo much reforted to for edu- 
cation, It ,s not merely a ftame ; it is criminal, to fufFer 
the youth to be daily Ihocked with, or hardened to the 
dymg agonies of animals, and to be obliged to wade in filth 
and gore in paffing along the ftreets.-The ftate of the 
church too is a great difadvantage to the parifti. Befides its 
ruinous condition, it is too fmall, and at too great a diftance 
from the populous towns, which are almoft four fifths of 
the whole. It has been obferved, that this place had the 
advantage of an almoft hourly communication with Edin- 
burgh, by means of fifh wives, carriers of all forts, and ftage- 
coaches, which rendered the convejance of letters both 
cheap and commodious. Of late, on pretence of ferving 
the place, the General Poft-office has extended a penny- 
poft over us, which turns out a real grievance. Our cor- 
refpondents at Edinburgh pay a penny on putting in their 
letters, and we have three halfpence to pay when they are 
delivered here. It is not believed, that there is fuch a piece 
of extortion in any part of Great Britain. In London, one 
penny is all that is exafted. This muft appear doubly op- 
preflive, when it is confidered, that we are not allowed the 
benefit of our fituation, 6 miles eaftward on the poft-road to 
London, but have our letters carried pajl us to Edinburgh, 
and /eat back at the additional charge of a penny per letter. 
This is a real grievance, that deferves more attention than 
all the imaginary ones, that have of late been fo loudly com- 
plained of.

Hoads.— The roads, too, in the parilh are thought to be 
in a worfe ftate than any in the county of Mid-Lothian, for 
which the magiftrates are not to blame, as their ftreet, 
which make ^J-ths of a mile of the poft road, are kept ia 
very good order. Confidering how largely the inhabitants 
of this parifli contribute to the roads, by paying at the 
turnpike gates between this and Edinburgh and Leith, and 
that the very numerous carriages of the parilh have for 
many years been under the direftion of the county, this 
feems very unaccountable. The roads leading to the coal 
pits are kept in better order, which is of much advantage 
to the inhabitants, not merely for their own fupply with 
fuel, but for the fake of a great number of people, who 
earn their livelihood by the carriage of that article *. The 
pavement or caufeway of the ftreets is kept in tolerable 
good order ; but the faot paths in wet weather are fhame- 
fully dirty, which is the more inexcufable, as the town 
draws above L. 70 per annum for the dung of the ftreets, 
which formerly were a charge to them. It may likewife 
be obferved here, that too little attention is paid to the ac- 
commodation of trades people and labourers, who have oc- 
cafion to travel fo frequently to the neighbouring town of 
Dalkeith. Forty years ago, when the fields were unin- 
clofed, the road to that town from Fiflierrow was a mile 
nearer than it is now. The road from Muffelburgh has 
likewife been much lengthened by means of inclofures. 
The road is narrow, and the people who travel on foot are 
forced to go, for at leaft a mile, in mud over the flioes, be- 
tween two walls or hedges, or to break over the fences ; a 
little attention, and a very fmall expence, might reQify 
this.

ConJluution.^Tht fame objeaions lie againft the conftl- 
tution of this burgh, as againft man j other burghs of Scot- 
land, viz. that they are liable to an oligarchy, and that it is 
impraaicable, as the law now ftands, for the burgeffes to 
obtain any redrefs for the mifmanagement of the public re- 
venue ; and they are attended with the fame ill confequen- 
ces as in other burghs, viz. the difcontent and bad humour 
of the inhabitants. It muft be owned, that it is not pro- 
bable, that the finances would be better managed in the 
hands of thofe who complain, than in the hands of the pre- 
fent fet ; for, befides that many of the grounds of complaint 
would be found to be imaginary, if enquired into, the cor- 
poration fpirit is ftrong enough to infeft the new entrants 
as well as the old poffelTors. Ancient conftitutions ought 
to be refpecled, and innovations are dangerous. All this is 
allowed ; and it is farther granted, that a too popular or 
democratical government, is more tumultuous and hazar- 
dous than one in the contrary extreme; and that it is not 
improbable, that the experience of fuch evils may have, in 
ancient times, been the reafon for devolving fo much power 
into the hands of the town-councils. Neverthelefs, the 
circumftances of the times, and the change in the ftate of 
the burghs, might be attended to ; and it may be wife in 
our legiQators, at their leifure, in times of tranquillity, to 
confider v/hether or not, without incurring any of the above 
mentioned dangers, a plan ought not to be devifed, for 
preventing at leafl the exclulion of the principal citizens 
or burgefles in rotation, into the councils of their re- 
fpeftive towns, and of putting an end to that oligarchy, 
or government of a few, which is apt to extinguilh in 
the holders of it every idea but that of preferving 
their own power ; and obliges them, for this purpofe, 
to ele6i into their body infignificant people, or up-

flarts and ftrangers, and to exclude the moft wealthy and 
refpeaable of their burgefles. It is this narrow fyftem of 
municipal and political government, which is fo irkfome to 
the inhabitants of many burghs in ^cotland ; which fours 
their minds, and difpofes them to liften with greedy ears 
to pretended plans of reform in the conllitution, however 
remote their conneftion may be, with the redrefs of any- 
rear grievances they have to complain of. 

And yet, after all, fuch a change ought never to be at- 
tempted, till it has been calmly confidered, whether or not 
fuch an attempt may produce greater evils, than thofe that 
are complained of. For when it is confidered, that to pro- 
mote the virtue and happinefs of the people is the object of 
Government, and that their liberty, both political and civil, 
is fufficiently fecured by the fundamental laws of the 
realm, without expoling them to all the licenfe and debau- 
chery of popular elections, a wife patriot will be patient 
under partial evils, and cautious in feconding plans of re- 
form, which are not neceflary to the fecurity of freedom, 
and may tend to the corruption of the people. 

Upon the whole, next to virtue and good morals, the 
comfortable ftate of this community depends on the profpe- 
rity of the capital, with which it is fo much connedled, and 
on the difintereftednefs and adlivity of its magiftrates, in re- 
gulating the police, and laying out their funds in ufeful 
improvements.

Nafne, For)n, Extent, and Si^r/ace. 

THE name of this parifh, from all we can learn, feems 
to have been always the fame. It is uncertain, how- 
ever, what gave Hfe to it. Its figttre is irregular. Its 
length from E. to W. is about I6 miles, and its breadth 
about 6. The furface is compofed of fome flat grounds on 
the N. E. •, of fome valleys on the fides of the rivers He- 
riot and Gala, ^c. ; but mollly of hills, inclining to moun- 
tains. The latter are covered with heath, fometimes in- 
terfefted with fields, which, after being a few years cropped, 
are fown out, and afford pretty rich pafture for fheep. It 
is ill-judged frugality, perhaps, in the farmer, not to fow 
fome red, or, at leaft, fome white clover, along with his 
rye-grafs, in thefe fields; this would both meliorate the 
land, and enrich the pafture. 



Rivers. 



of Heriot.

Rivers.— Heriot rifes at the weft end of the parifh. 
Enfum-cleugh in Dewar, Garwell punks, and Blackhope 
Scares are the fuppofed fources. It flows eaft, divides the 
parifh into two, and then lofes itfelf in the water of Gala. 
The Gala rifes in the eaft end of the parifh, at a place 
called Nettlefiat Wells, or Whitelaw Well, within the pro- 
perty of Mr Borthwick of Crookftoun. It runs fouth, 
pafles GiMl^ieUs, and then difembogues itfelf into the 
Tweed. Thtife rivers abound with trouts, which gentlemen 
come froWall quarters to fifh. It is much to be regretted, 
that the gentlemen in the neighbourhood permit poachers 
with nets to vifit thefe prolific rivers, A party of three or 
four will fally out from Edinburgh, Dalkeith, ISc. and in 
a fhort fpace fill their creel or bag, by fweeping every thing 
before them. They exemplify the old proverb, " All is fifh 
■** that comes in the net." Even the falmon, in clofe time, 
which come up to fpawn, do not efcape a dreadful maf- 
facre. During the autumnal months, and after a few 
weeks, the water is covered with lights, compofed of old 
facks, or rags and tar ; and the lifter *, as it is commonlj 
called, is heard plunging in every hole. 

Animals. — The quadrupeds are horfes, black cattle, 
flieep, bogs, hares, and badgers. The birds are partridges, 
muirfowl, and plovers, XSc. befides the common domeftic 
fowls. 

Soil, Cultivation, and Produce. -r-Tht foil In general, ex- 
cept in the valleys, is thin and gravelly j it admits of a fti- 
mulus, fuch as lime, and then is not a little produffive. 
The farmers often fay, " they have plenty of growth, if

" they had warmth of climate to bring it to maturity." It 
yields very good oats, bear, peas, and potatoes. Wheat 
has been attempted, but with very little fuccefe. Within 
thefe very few years, turnips and artificial grafs have been 
cultivated, and thqy now obtain, as a part of our fyftem 
of farming ; an improvement not more beneficial to the 
land, than lucrative to the hufbandman ; the m prepares 
the ground for good bear, and the other for e:$ft^lleut oats. 

St!'' 

Farvis, Sheep, Wool, Sif c— The farms are of various extent, 
from to looo acres, and let at various rents, according to 
their quality and fituation, from L. 40 to L. 200 Sterling. 
They are moftly laid out in pafture. To this the farmer has a 
natural predileftion, and cheerfully devotes his attention, 
care,and diligence. The fheep are of confiderablefize, hardy, 
and thrive well. The farmers do not affea theEnghfli breed, 
neither do they wifh to buy in new flock. Such as are bred 
on the ground they confider as more durable, and lefs liable 
to difeafe. They bring good prices, from L. 10 to L. 14 
Sterling, the fcore ; their wool from 8 s. to 10 s. the ftone. 
Ewe cheefe abounds here. This, for nine weeks, engroffes 
almoft the whole attention of the bufy houfe-wife and her 
maids. It is, perhaps, inferior to none in quality, cleanli- 
nefs, and relifh ; and makes no fmall additional income to 
the tenant. The average price, for fome years paft, has 
been about 7 s. the ftone. 

Population. — It is generally believed, that the population 
of this parifh has decreafed confiderably within thefe 20 or 
30 years. Led farms are faid to be the chief caufe of this 
depopulation. True patriotifm, and even an enlightened 
policy, according to our ideas, fliould ftimulate proprietors 
to check, this pernicious praftice. The inhabitants of the 
villages, luch as Heriot-town, Chapel, l^c, are alfo dimi- 

niflied,

niflied, through the baneful operation of the above fyftem. 
The tenant having no ufe either for the houfes or the in- 
habitants., the former are fuffered to tumble down into 
ruins, and the latter muft go in queft of employment 
fomewhere elfe. Notwithftanding thefe difadvantages, 
however, which have doubtlefe reduced the number of the 
pariftiioners within thefe 20 or 30 years, it is a faft, that 
the population has increafed confiderably upon the whole, 
within thefe 40 years ; for the number of fouls at prefent 
(1794) in the parifli amounts to - - 300 

whereas the return to Dr Webfter in 1755, was only 209 

Hence there is evidently an increafe of - 91 

The annual average of marriages, births, and deaths is 
about 4, 

Religious Perfuajiofis. — Of the above number, nearly the 
one half are Burgher Seceders. Part go to a meeting- 
houfe, (as the common phrafe is), at Stow, about 8 miles, 
and part to Fala about 6 miles diftant. 

Church. — The church is an old and infirm building. It 
is fcarcely fafe to perform public duty in it. It is neither 
dry above, nor decently feated. It is, perhaps, the moft: 
fhabby and miferable place of accommodation for divine 
fervice in Scotland. The heritors, however, have juft met 
and agreed to make fome fmall repairs upon it; among which 
there is to be a new bell, the old one being rent *. The manfe 
was in the fame ruinous fituauon, but was xebuilt laft 
year. Owing partly to the meafures adopted by the 

heritors, 

* On the old bell, there is this inrcription: " Maria vocor. Ao. Dnl. 
" Mcccccxvni Jhonn. Dawie." Tlie kirk is perliaps older than this 
bell as above dated, but there is no legend, infcription, 'or even tradition, 
to found an opinion upon.

heritors, and partly to the negligence or incapacity of the 
builders, it is fuperficial to the laft degree. Upon the leaft 
blaft, it draws water from every quarter, and overflows the 
rooms. This renders the houfe extremely damp, and con- 
fequently dangerous to health. The ftipend is exaftly looo 
merks, including facramental elements. The glebe, about 
14 Scotch acres, is partly arable, and partly fit for pafture. 
There is a procefs for an augmentation going on. Sir John 
Dalrymple is patron. 

Proprietors.— Thz heritors are 7 in number, ni^. Lord 
Rofeberry, Sir John Dalrymple, Thomas Adinfton of Car- 
cant, John Borthwick of Crookftoun, George Granfton of 
Dewar, Simon Frafer of Ford, and Mifs Tait of Fala-hifl. 
None refide in the parilh. 

School. — The fchool-mafter's falary is 100 merks. The 
average number of fcholars is 10. The fmallnefs of the 
number is owing to the age and infirmity of the teacher, 
who is above 70 years of age ; to his ignorance of the lan- 
guages, and particularly to his want of a fchool-houfe. He 
has only a fmall cottage, and an area of about 8 feet 
by 16, taken off the end of it:, as his fchoolj and even 
this is crammed with tables, forms, and other hofife- 
hold fluff, as the fchool-mafter has no place elfe to 
lodge them. This want of accommodation greatly aflfeds 
the emoluments of the teacher, and the education of the 
youth of the parifli. The fees for teaching to read Englifli 
are i s., writing and arithmetic i s. 6 d. the quarter. He is 
alfo precentor, feffion-clerk, beadle, grave-digger, and yet 
his whole income does not exceed L. 8 Sterling per annum. 
This, v.'ith the paltry accommodation, holds out little en- 
couragement to a teacher of any merit. Indeed, no man 
who poffefles ftrength to lift a mattock, or to weild a flail, 

would

would accept of fuch a difgraceful pittance. In thefe times, 
when there is fuch a general rife in all the neceffaries o£ 
life, what progrefs in learning or in fcience is to be ex- 
pefted in any part of the kingdom, when that ufeful and 
neceflary fet of men are depreffed by poverty ? 

Poor.— There are no poor in this parifli, either in the 
roll, or as vagrant beggars. Economy, joined to induftry, 
has placed thofe of the inferior ranks above indigence. 
They attend diligently to their refpedive bufinels, and 
reap the fruits of their own labours. Hence we may infer, 
that our public fund is increaling ; hence alfo, an affeff- 
ment fof the poor is unknown in this parifla.

there are in the parifli : ' 
Carpenters, - 2 Weavers, - 4

PrzcM of Labour and Provijtons. — The wages of a day- 
labourer in hufbandry are i s. and often is. 2d. per day, 
without maintenance, and 8 d. and fometimes 10 d. 
with it per day. A man's yearly wages are from L. 7 
to L. 9 Sterling. Thofe of a female fervant from L. 3 to 
L. 4 Sterling. It is a circumftance not unworthy of notice, 
perhaps, that flie draws only L. i, 5 s. or L. 1, 10 s. for the 
winter half-year, and all the reft, L. 2j 15 s. or even L.3 
Sterling, for the fummer. The ftore farmer is the occa- 
lion of this. Such as keep two maids for the winter re- 
quire 4 or 5 for the fummer, in order to milk their ewes, 
cut down their crops, and hoe turnips. Hence the de- 
mand for fervants is greater, and of courfe raifes their 
wages. A mafon 's wages are is. 6 d. with maintenance,

or 3 s. without it ; a carpenter's is, 6 d. without, or 9 d. 
with it ; a tailor's 8 d. with it, and all others in proportion. 
The prices of provifions, fmce the year 1740, are doubled, 
and fome tripled. Eggs, then if d. and 2 d. the dozen, now 
fell at 5 d. and 6 d. and often are not even to be got ; hf ns, 
formerly 6 d. now draw i s. 2 d. and i s. 4 d. ; butter, for- 
merly 5 d. is now 9d. 10 d. and i s. the pound ; butcher 
meat, formerly 2i-d. now 4d. and 5 d. per pound ; cheefe, 
formerly 3 s. or 4 s. the ftone, is now 7 s. and 8 s.; 
coals, fince the year 1790, have rifen from 8 d. to i s. i d. 
the tub, which contains 400 lb. Dutch weight. The grain 
of this parifh is carried to Dalkeith market, (which is held 
weekly on Thurfday), and fold for ready money. Oats 
bring from 12 s. to 18 s. Sterling /tr boll, and bear from 
14 s. to L. I. 

Roads and Inns. — The roads in the pariili are in a pretty 
good ftate of repair, particularly the public or Gala-water 
road. This is one of the London roads. It comes from 
Edinburgh by Laflwade, Cockpen, Middleton, Heriot, 
Bankhoufe, Selkirk, \Sc. Good roads are one ftriking caufe 
of the improvement of the country in this place. Heriot 
public houfe was the ancient ftage from Edinburgh, and 
was much frequented. It is near 16 miles from Edinburgh. 
It belongs to Sir John Dalrymple, but is now deferted by 
genteel and fftfliionable company, in confequence of the 
eredlion of two new inns at Middleton and Bank-houfe. 
There is another public houfe in the parifti, called Sware- 
Z'Of//^, which is the property of Mifs Tait. There is one 
toll-bar near Heriot houfe, to the north. It is raifed to 
It d. a faddle horfe, 3 d. a fingle, and 4! d. a double cart. 

Fuel, 'iJc. — Coals, peats, and turfs, are ufed for fuel ; the 
two latter abound in the parifh, and the former is about 
6 or 7 miles diftant, m-z. Stobhill, belonging to Mr Duu-

das of Arnifton, at prefent Lord Advocate. We have no 
manufadures here, which is very furprifing, as we' have 
abundance of water during the whole year for driving ma-. 
chinerj; and the rather, as we are near coal, and have plenty 
of other fuel, as well as near market towns, fuch as Edin- 
burgh, Leith, Haddington, Lauder, Dalkeith, i^c. 

Antiquities. — There are in Carcant fome veftiges of houfes 
called Shiels-Walis\ and on Roughfwyre ground, three Char- 
ter Poles in different places, but no fatisfaftory account of 
them can be obtained. There is on Heriot-town hill-head, a 
circle of high ftones, 70 or 80 feet diameter ; and on Borth- 
wick-hall Mid-hill-head, there are 3 large rings, or deep 
ditches, about lOO paces diameter. Whether they were old 
encampments of die Romans, or of the Britons, Danes, Pi6ls, 
and Scots, we lhall not venture to determine j all tradition 
about them here is extinft. There is a circle on the fide 
of the Gala road, near the Bridge, over the water of He- 
riot, and behind a weaver's cottage, belonging to the Abbey 
of Melrofe ; to this place were driven horfes, cattle, fheep, 
l^c. when they were poinded or rouped for behoof of the 
creditor. On the march between this and the parifli of 
Inverleithen, in the farm of Dewar, there is a grave, called 
t/je Piper's Grave. He was piper of Peebles *. The head 
and foot ftones are vifible to this day. On Dewar Hill, not 
far from the above grave, there is a remarkable large 
ttone, called Lot's Wife : the reafon of this title is unknown. 
At a little diftance from this, there is the Wolf-Cleuch, of which 
a traditional ftory t is afferted as truth. A little from the

high road, and not far from Heriot public houfe, there is a 
ftone, called Mary Gib's, from an unfortunate woman who 
was burnt upon this Itone for a witch. The children, to 
this day, in going and coming from fchool, affedl to be af- 
fraid when they pafs by it. 

Climate and CharaBer. — The air in every ''part of the 
parilh is falubrious ; hence the inhabitants in general are 
very robuft and healthy. Some live to a great age. One 
died lately, born in the laft century, and the laft minifter 
was going 87. The people are induftrious, and highly 
oeconomical, fober, peaceable, humane, and given to ho- 
fpitality. Their drefs is quite fimple, and their manners 
plain and unafTedled. They are regular in their attendance 
on divine ordinances. They are rather badly accommo- 
dated for houfes, which are lhabby dirty huts. Although 
the parifh is within two or three miles of lime at Mid- 
dleton, they are ftill built of turf and ftone in regular fuc- 
ceflion. The feats of our lairds are very little better. 

Hif advantages. — There is no planting or inclofures in 
this parifh, except a cow park or two. This is certainly 
a great defeft in agricultural improvement ; befides, it 
with-holds from the country a principal beauty ; add to 
this, that the lands have no fhelter, and even the very Iheep 
are fo expofed, as fometimes to be overwhelmed and buried 
in the fnow by fcores. ^ A farmer loft about 1 2 fcore this 
winter in one night. Such iofles are the more ferious, as 
fheep are the ftaple commodity of this parifti. Two-horfe 
ploughs are all in ufe hqre \ there is no fuch thing as an

have thefe lands. Accordingly, one had the courage to engage it, and

ox to be feen in the yoke. We would be cautious to pro- 
nounce this any real acquilition to the fvirmer. A dead ox 
is better than a dead horfe, and a fat ox will lell any where, 
when a fine horfe will fcarce find a merchant. Befides, 
they are cheaply maintained, and in general Heady plowers. 
The rife of farms for fonme years paft has been confiderable. 
This is partly owin,g to the odious praftice of one farmer 
fubfetting to another. There are lands in the barony of 
Sir John Dalrynmple fubfuh-fubfet ; the conlequence is, the 
original tackfman is a kind of fecond laird, and the laft is 
opprefled with anxiety and toil to make up his rent. Far- 
mers who enjoy the right of fubfetting are the mofl exor- 
bitant in their claims. Ye noblemen and gentlemen, pro- 
prietors of land, fpeedily abolifh fub fets and led farms ; the 
poor will blefs you, and pollerity ujiborn will rife up and 
proclaim your patriotic virtues |

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5050624">CASTLETOWN</name> 

(County of Roxburgh, Presbytery of Langholri,. 
Synod of Dumfries.) 

By the Rev. Mr James Arkle, Minijier.</head>

<p>

Origin of the Names^ 

'J^HE origin of the mode^, as well as of the ancient 
name of this parifli, is abundantly plain. Upon the 
fummit of a precipice, about lOO feet perpendicular, on- 
the eaft bank of the river Liddal, and immediately above 
the church, there was a ftrong fort or caftle, the rampart 
and foffee of which remain entire : near to thefe, in the 
place where the prefent road was formed, and in feveral 
other parts in the immediate neighbourhood, many hearth- 
ftones were dug up, where a town or village had formerly 
ftood. Hence the name of Cajlle-towu. But the ancient 
name of this diftridt, and indeed that by which it is ftill 
moft frequently denominated, was Liddifdak,' from the 
river Liddal, which runs through it in a dire£lion from eaft 
to fouth. In the ancient hiftories, and geographical ac- 
counts of Scotland, it is called the county of Liddifdale, and 
in old writs it is defigned tlie Lordjhip of that name. 



of Cajlletown. 



61 



Ereaion, Form, and Extent.— TiCis parllh formerly be- 
jonged to the Preftytery of Jedburgh ; but when the five 
churches of Elkdale were erefted into the Prefbytery of 
Langholm, it was added to them in the year 1743. This 
was done on account of its great diftance from the former 
feat of the prelbytery. Its form approaches nearly to that- 
of a triangle, whofe bafe runs from eaft to weft, along the 
head of Teviotdale, and whofe oppofite vertex points to 
Sol way frith. It contains, according to the map of the 
county, about 52,160 acres. It is the largeft parifli in the 
fouth of Scotland, being upwards of 18 miles in length, and 
14 ia breadth. 

General Appearance, Woods, i^c. — The general appear- 
ance of the upper part of the parifli is mountainous ; the 
lower part is hilly ; and all of it, at a diftance from the 
banks of the rivers, is bleak and wil,d to a high degree. 
But its appearance along the banks of the rivers is altoge- 
ther different. Thefe are generally covered with natural 
woods, or young plantations in a very thriving ftate. The 
barren wilds are entirely hid from the view ; the windings 
of the river, and the fine holm land on every fide, prefent 
the moft pifturefque fcenes, or exhibit rich profpedb to the 
eye. Thefe are juftly defcribed by our native poet, Dr 
Armftrong, in his poem on Health *. The inhabited part

of the parlfli confifts of two vallies. That along the Her- 
mitage is about ten miles in length, from the fource of the 
nver to the point where it lofes its name in the Liddal. 
At the head of this river the country is entirely mountain- 
ous. The mountains are very high and fteep, but are ge- 
nerally dry, and afFord excellent flieep pafture. The 
greateft part of this ftream is fringed with natural wood ; 
it poffeffes much rural beauty, and exhibits the paftoral 
fcenes of life in great perfeftion. The other valley, or 
ftrath, is that along the fides of the Liddal. Near the head 
of the parifli on the eaft, the rivers Liddal and Tyne, which 
runs by Newcaftle, take their rife, in the midft of an im- 
menfe bog, furrounded by mountains. This place is very 
properly named Dead water, becaufe for a confiderable 
fpace neither of them can be traced as a running ftream, 
The Tyne winds flowly to the eaft, between the bleak 
mountains and the dreary waftes of Northumberland, by 
Keelder Cnjlle *. The Liddal runs due weft for a few miles, 
and then runs due fouth. This part of the country is 
mountainous, high, cold and moift, and lies under the 
thick and folitary gloom of continual fogs. For ten miles 
down the river its banks are entirely naked ; the hills on 
each fide produce a great quantity of grais. At the point 
■where it is joined by the Hermitage the banks are covered 
with trees. On the north fide the thriving plantations of 
the Duke of Buccleugh, and on the fouth the plantations 
and woods of Mr Elliot of Whitehaugh, near the confluence 
of the rivers, form a landfcape highly beautiful. Here the 
valley widens confiderably, and improvements are every 
where feen. From this hill you reach the confines of 
Canonby ; the ride is very much admired by travellers.

gant plan ; the femicircular groves of trees, and the fertile 
fields, and windings of the river Liddal, contribute their 
various beauties to delight the eye. 

Mountains.— The. principal mountains are Tudhope, 
Millenwood-fell, Windhead, Greatmoor, Dun, Dod, Her- 
mitage, Peel-fell, Roan-fell, Larifton-fell, Carby-Laws, 
and Tinnis hills. The laft mentioned is feen as a land mark 
at a great diftance out at fea. None of tbefe mountains have 
been meafured by the barometer. But when Mr Stobie 
furveyed the county, he meafured thofe of the Cheviot, 
Cartawifp, l^c. and when on the top of the highefl in this 
parifli, he compared them with others by the Theodolite ; 
by this it appears Tudhope is 1830 feet above the Jevel of 
the fea. Milkn wood-fell and Windhead are about 2000 
feet. Thefe are the highefl: of them. 

Rivers and Fijh. — The rivers are the Liddal, the Hermi- 
tage, the Tweeden, the Kerfhope, (which divides the two 
kingdoms), the Tinnis and the Blackburn ; with fevefal 
other ftreams of inferior note. All of them are plentifully 
ftored with trouts, and afford excellent fport to the angler. 

Climate and Longevity. — The climate is very damp, 
owing to two caufes. From its proximity to the Atlantic 
Ocean, a great colledlion of vapour arifes, which is attradted 
by the mountains, and poured down in torrents of rain. 
The other is owing to the nature of the foil and furface of 
the hills themfelves. They are generally covered to the 
very furamit with a deep flratum of mofs, which retains 
the moifture -, under the mofs lies a bed of till, through 
which the water cannot ealily penetrate. Notwithftanding 
the dampnefs of the air, thof&amp; who are bred in the country 
enjoy good health, and many of them have arrived at a

great age. An inftance occurs of one Mr Elliot of Red- 
heugh, who lately, at the age of 86, rode 50 miles in one 
day, without any inconvenience, tranfafted bufinefs at a 
13ubhc market, and returned to his houfe next evening, 
without fleep. One man now alive, James Lillico, 
married, his third wife at 72, is now upwards of 93, enjoys 
good health, and manages his ordinary bufinefs; another, 
at the age of 80, is in full vigour^, and frequently walks to 
Edinburgh. A woman, named Margaret Wyllie, died a 
few years ago at the age of 113, in the pofleffion of all hec 
faculties till the day of her death. 

Lifeafes. — The fcropliula prevails frequently among the 
young, and rheumatic and ftomach complaints among 
thofe more advanced in life. Inoculation is general. 
Laft fpring a great number of children, fome men, and 
women the mothers of children, were inoculated, and all 
of them did well. At prefent the fmall-pox rages in the 
natural way, and has carried off many. Prejudices ftlU re- 
main againft inoculation, chiefly among the Seceders. 
Confumptions are frequent. Epidemic fevers fonietim^ 
vifit us, but are feldom fatal, 

Sheep, TV ool, IJc. — The rents of the parlfti arife chiefly 
from flieep, black cattle and horfes, and from tillage. 
The flieep are of the long kind ; there are no ftiort flieep 
in the country. The breed of flieep has been very much 
improved of late years, by feveral individuals, who have 
purchafed rams from the eaftern borders. The moft intelli- 
gent obferve, that crofling the breed is not only the beft 
method of improving the flieep and wool, butalfo of pre- 
venting the difeafes to which they are liable. By conti- 
Iiuing the fame ram, the flieep are weakened, and difeafes 
jnultiplied, or rendered jnore inveterate ; by changing him,

it is found that the Jlurdy, and other difeafes, are lefs fre- 
quent. The diforders moft prevalent are, the fturdy, the 
ficknefe, the louping iU, the rot, and the braxy. Wedders 
and draught ewes are fold to dealers from Yorkftiire. The 
wool is fold for clothing to the manufafturing towns m 
England. Laft year it fold at from 15 s. to 19 s. the ftone ; 
this feafon from 11 s. to 15 s. The decreafe is owing no 
doubt to the ftagnation of commerce. Moft of the farms are 
feparated from each other by ftone dikes •, but even where 
they are not, the flocks are permitted to wander at large 
in their refpeaive paftures. They are never confined in 
hirfels, nor in folds by night ; they feek their food at large, 
and they know beft where it is to be found. They are all 
over-laid with tar ; fdme ufe palm oil in place of butter, and 
approve of it . The flieep are carefully waftied before (hearing. 
The pra6tice of milking the ewes is very much difconti- 
nued ; where it is continued, it is only for a ftiort time. 
It weakens the flieep, and renders them lefs able to endure 
the feverity of the winter. Every farmer provides a con- 
fiderable quantity of hay againft the ftorni, and when ne- 
ceflary, feeds regularly. Before this method was adopted, 
much lois was frequently fuftained in ftormy feafons. 

Black Cattle. — Some farmers bring a confiderable num- 
ber of black cattle from the markets of Falkirk, Crieff", and 
Down. They are fupported during the winter by the fog- 
gage and coarfe hay, and fold in the fpring j or fed in good 
pafture through the fummer, and fold fat about Martinmas ; 
kyloes at from L. 3 to L. 5 Sterling. Thofe bred in the 
country are of the Dutch, Lancafter, or Galloway kinds. 
The large kind fell at from L. 6 to L. 9 Sterling. Their pa- 
fture is generally coarfe, excepting what lies upon lime-ftone, 
which is very fine, but the produce is always very great. 
The butter which is made, even on the coarfeft pafture, is

not excelled by any in Britain. It is commonly obferved, 
that the coarfer the pafture is, the butter is the better and 
the richer. Even the mofly ground, though in appearance 
barren, ib of great ufe both for black, cattle and fheep. The 
plant, called the mofs, rifes before any other in the fpring, 
affords excellent "nourifliment, and is carefully fought after 
by the flocks. In thefe coarfe lands, there is a conftant and 
regular fucceflion of different fpe-cies of grafs, which rife iu 
their refpe£tive feafons throughout the year. 

Soil, Produce, and Cultivation. — -The arable land at pre- 
fent in tillage lies chiefly on the banks of the rivers. Many 
hundred acres, formerly in tillage, are thrown into pafture 
pn account of the high prices of ftieep and wool. The foil 
of the holm land is excellent. It is fometimes of a light, 
but mofh frequently of a very deep and fine loam, and 
where it is properly cultivated, it produces exceeding g6od 
crops. Wheat has been fown, and turned put very well. 
The prdinary crops are barley, or rough bear, peafe, oats, 
flax, potatoes. Turnips have lately been introduced, and 
fucceeded very well. Laft furamer, travellers from Edin- 
burgh faw no turnips by the way equal to thofe on the fields 
in this place. Within thefe few years, a confiderable quan- 
tity of grafs feeds have been fown, and have produced ex- 
cellent crops. From the nature pf the hplrti land, and fitu- 
ation of the country, turnips, barley, and grafs feeds, fuc- 
ceeded by early oats, will probably be found the befl; rota- 
tion.~-The ploughs in ufe are, the Englifh plough, and 
Small's chain plough. The former, drawn by 4 horfes, is 
ftill ufed by fome farmers, though, froni the nature of the 
land, there can be no doubt that Small's chain plough, with 
two horfes, would execute the work, and anfwer the pur- 
jpofe much better. The ridges are made very narrow, and

5,,/-,«,_Though the hills are moift, yet from the re flee 
tion of the fun from each fide of the valley, and its favour- 
able expofure in the fummer, the weathet is very ^varm, 
and the harvefts are early. As foon as vegetation com- 
mences in the fpring, it fhoots forth with ^-°"derf.^ vi- 
gour and with great rapidity, and the ordmary produftions 
of the garden arrive at great perfedion. Our harvefts are 
much more early than in Canonby, or even part of t.um- 
berland, though both of which countries lie to the fouth ot 
Caftletown Oats and peafe are fowh in March and April ; 
barley in the end of April or beginning of May, and they 
are all reaped in September. 

FopuIution.-Th^ population of this parifti has decreafed 
a little within thefe 40 years, as appears from the foUow- 
ing table. This decreafe is eafily accounted for, by feveral 
farms, formerly let to different tenants, being now pof- 

felled 

* The whole of the holm land along the banks of the river appear* 
formerly to have been covered with wood, and the fides of the hiUs to 
have been almoft entirely in cultivation ; the furrows and ridges are 
• plain and evident. But at this period, to fow corn on thofe places, or to 
expeft a crop, would be equally vain. What is the caufe of this change ? 
When the vallies were covered with wood to a certain height, were the 
fides of the hills more warm? Were the feafons themfelves then more 
kindly, as traditi.n pofitively affirms ? Or were the inhabitants obliged 
to cultivate the high grounds, when the lower were covered with wood ? 
About the middle of the hills, on each fide the river Liddal, a deep ditch, 
or a ftrong wall, appears to have been drawn almoft the whole length 
of the country, beneath which lay the arable ground, where the old fur- 
rows and ridges appear, and all above was either for pafture or common. 
In thofe days every kind offence was necellUrv. not only from beafte of 
the field, but alfo from the inroads of the plunderer.

* \3l'ith regard to marriagfts and baptifms, the parift regifter is very 
imperfe(fl. Several books have been loft, which make blanks of confide- 
rable periods. There is a minute inferted in the feflion records, of date 
17th January 1649, which mentions, " That the Englifti army, com. 
«' manded by Colonels Bright and Pride, and under the condudl of Ge- 
« neral Cromwell, on tlieir return to England, did lie at the kirk of 
" Caftletown feveral nights, in which time they brake down and burnt 
" the communion tables, and the feats of the kirk ; and at their rerao- 

ving, carried away the minifter's books to the value of 1000 marks 
" and above, and alfo the books of feffion, with which they lighted their 
" tobacco pipes, the baptifm, marriage, and examination rolls, from 
" Oaober 1612 to September 1648, all which were loft and deftroyed." 
From the accuracy with which this record had been kept, the lofs of it i» 
very much to be regretted. If we may form any judgment from the 
number of churches and chapels in the parifli at that time, with the 
burying grounds, and alfo from tbe ruins of many houfes and villages, 
the number of the inhabitants muft have been much greater at that pe- 
riod t!ia,i at prefent. No acopunt of the burials can now be given, be-

Church, ^c— The church was built in 1777. The 
rain penetrates through the walls, and part of the timber 
is already rotten. The manfe and offices are a heap of 
ruins. They were built on the top of a hideous precipice, 
about 100 feet of perpendicular height %, where there is 
not a drop of water for the ufe of man or beaft. The late 
Mr Rutherford found a fmall fpring about the middle of 
the rock, which he endeavoured to draw up at a great ex- 
pence ; the well was continually filling up, and is now en- 
tirely waflied away. It is propofed to build a manfe and 
offices in a more agreeable fituation next fpring. The 
prefent incumbent is accommodated in the mean time with 
a houfe a little more than two miles frdm the church. 
The living is L. 83 : 6 : 8. The value of the glebe can- 
not be accurately afcertained, as an exchange of land be- 
tween the Duke of Buccleugh and the minifter is jufl com- 
pleted, which will be more convenient for both parties ; 
at prefent the whole of the land is in the moft wretched 
condition. A few of the inhabitants attend a Seceding 
meeting houfe in the lower part of the parifti, built about 
30 years ago, and at prefent very much on the decline. 
All the reft belong to the Eftabliftied Church. 

Old Chapels.— 'There have been no lefs than 5 chapels or 
churches in the parifh, befides the parifti church. The Wheel 
Church at the head of Liddal, Hermitage, on the river of 
that name, Dinlabyre, Ettleton, and Chapel-know, on the 
borders of Canonby. Ettleton and Hermitage are ftill

ufed as burying-grounds, and many grave-ftones appear in 
the others. The Wheel Church has been of excellent 
workmanftiip. The 'population of the country muft cer- 
tainly have been far greater in thofe times. The Wheel 
Church has been pretty large ; many grave-ftones appear 
in the church-yard ; yet, when ftanding on the fpot at this 
time, there are only 3 farm houfes in view, taking in a 
circle of many miles. 

Schools. — The fchoolmafter's falary is L. 8 : 6 : 8, be- 
lides his perquifites-arifing from his office of feflion-clerk, 
precentor, marriages, colleftions, the poor's rates, and 
fchool fees. The fchool houfe is in good repair ; but the 
fchool is in very bad order. The number of fcholars at 
prefsnt is very fmall. There are two other fchools in the 
parifh, fupported by private contributions. 

Poor. — There is no place Where the poor are better 
provided for than in this parifti. Poor's rates were efta- 
bliihed in 1774. The heritors pay one half, and the te- 
nants the other •, it js levied quarterly ; the money is paid 
moft pundually, and immediately applied. Thofe upon 
the roll receive from 5 s. to L. i : 2 : 6 per quarter, ac- 
cording to their ■ neceffities. The prefent affeiTraent is 
L. 56 per quarter. In the years 1782 and 1783 feveral 
perfons received temporary fupply, and when the meal fell 
lower in price it was withdrawn. The weekly colleaions 
at the church, fmce the poor's rates were eftablilhed, are 
exceedingly fmall. But from thefe, from fines paid by de- 
linquents, and from marriages out of church, perfons not 
on the poor's roll, and in diftreffed circumftances, are re- 
lieved. No perfon is allowed to. beg. A friendly fociety 

was eftabliftied a few years ago ; the members pay 5

entering, and fo much per quarter ; it promifes to be very 
ufet'ul. 

Roads.— It muft appear very ftrange to any perfon ac- 
quainted with the improvements, which other parts of 
Scotland^ have received by means of roads, when it is men- 
tioned, that, in this very exterifive country, not a yard of 
road had ever been attempted to be formed, till withm ■ 
thefe few years. The ftatute labour has long been com- 
muted. For about i6 miles aloug the Liddal, the road 
lay rather in the river than upon its banks, the only path 
being in what is called the Watergate, and the unhappy 
traveller muft crofs it at leaft 24 times in that extent. 'I he 
feme thing ftill takes place, with refpedl to the Hermitage, | 
as far as it runs. At length, by the exertions of two of 
the heritors, fortunately for the country, poffeffed of public 
fpirit, Mr Oliver of Dinlabyre, and Mr Elliot of Whit- 
haugh, a road was begun, and ia now carrying along the 
fide of the Liddal for feveral miles. Hawick being almoft: 
the only market from which we receive meal, groceries, 
fpirits, iron, l^c. XSc. the want of a road to it is attended 
with much inconvenience and expence. But the funds, 
arifing from the ftatute labour, are perhaps inadequate to 
keep fo many miles of road in fuch repair as the country 
requires, and much lefs to make new ones. Unlefs lome 
other method is adopted, the pref nt road cannot be com- 
pleted, and there is no reafon to hope, that the road along 
the Hermitage can be formed in the prefent ijeneration. 
There is much intercourfe with both Hawick and Lang- 
holm, by weekly markets, fairs, ISc. and the difficulty of 
travelling to thofe places is inconceivable. Every article 
muft be carried on horfeback ; and through thefe deep and 
broken bogs and moftes we muft crawl, to the great fati^J^ne 
of ourfelves, but the much greater injury of our hoi les,

vrithout the hope of a more comfortable mode of travelliirg. 
As we have hitherto had no roads, it is not to be expedled 
that we fliould have had bridges. The two rivers, Liddal 
and Hermitage, divide the parifh for about i6 miles-, there 
never was a bridge on either of them. From a confider- 
able fiam of vacant ftipend, with the affiftance of the ordi- 
nary fund, one was built over the river Hermitage in 
1793; and laft autumn another was completed over the 
Liddal. Thefe, together with that part of the road alrea- 
dy made, are of the greateft fervice to the country, and to 
many travellers, who begin to pafs this way from Carhfle 
to the northern markets, and to Berwick-fhire, the road 
being much nearer than by Langholm and Mofs-Paul. 

Fuel. — The fuel chiefly ufed is peat, of which there 13 
an inexhauftible fund in every part of the country. There 
is alfo coal in the lower part of the parifh, wrought on the 
eftate of Mr Oliver. It is fold at the pit at 3 d. per buflielj 
tjr 6 d. per load; Carriers, who' bring goods from Hawick, 
commonly return loaded with coal. 

New Cajlletovon. — 'As there is not a village in the parifli, 
labourers and mechanics have long been very inconve- 
niently fituated for houfes. For their accoranvodaticn, and 
BO doubt to encourage m.anufaftures, the Duke of Buc- 
cleugh, has for fome time paft, intended to build a new 
town. At length a place was .fixed on, and a plan made 
otit. It is fet down on the farm of Park, on the banks of 
the Liddal, in a field of upwards of. ico acres of fine land, 
•and is named Cajlletoivn. It is to confift of two principal 
flreets, bearing- the names of the two rivers, Liddal and 
Hermitage, with feveral crofs ftreets at right angles. Her- 
mitage-ftreet is begun, and advancing rapidly. There is a 
fquare, called Bonglas Square^ in the centre, for a market 

place, 



of Cajtletown, -^5 



place, confiding of about two acres of ground, round which 
the buildings confift of two ftories. Near each extremity 
there is a fnmaller fquare. The ftreet is 54 feet wide in 
the principal fquare ;it ^is 100 feet. It was begu.; in March 
laft-, and at prefent there are 23 houfes either inhabited, 
or nearly finilhed. Each houfe cofts from L. 35 to L. 40 
Sterling. They hold of the Duke, pay a fmall fum by 
way of fea dnty, and have each a good garden. Every 
feuer has grafs for a cow on the hill, for which they pay 
L. I. For each houfe they have two acres of holm land, 
for 14 years, for which they pay a certain Turn. A fitu- 
ation more favourable for carrying on manufaflures is 
fcarcely to be found. Its local advantages are very great. 
Within 100 yards of peat, and only about 3 miles from coal, 
it has water at command to drive machinery of any extent. 
Wool, the ftaple commodity of the country, grows on the 
fide of every hill. There is an excellent road lately made 
by Canonby to Carlifle, the Solway frith, ISc. Pofleffed of 
thefe advantages, it folicits fome perfon of enterprize and 
induftry to improve them. When we confider what has 
been done in Galafhiels, l^c. and in fituations far lefs fa- 
vourable, it is hoped the time is not far diftant, when fucli 
advantages as thefe will attrafl: the attention of the manu- 
fafturers either of flax, wool, or cotton ; and inftead of 
fending the wool, the raw material, to Leeds, Hiiddersfield, 
\Sc. by a long and expenfive land carriage, it will be ma- 
nufactured here where it grows, enrich the country by en- 
couraging induftry, adding to population, and by giving 
bread and employment to hundreds of all ages. 

Natural History. 
Reptiles, FiJJj, and ^tadrupeds. — The reptiles produced 
in the parifh are-, toads, lizards, and adders. The laft is 
not numei:ous.— The fifti are, trouts, lampreys, eels, Ikelly,

or chubb, falmon, grilfe, 'Jc. The falmon were very plen- 
titul in former years, but fince the bay or mouud was built 
at Nether by, few get up ai any time, and none but in the 
time of a great flood. The wild quadrupeds are foxes, 
hares, wild cats, pole cats, weaiels, the white weazel, often 
feen in winter, hedge hogs and Norway rats. Tradition 
affirms, that the earth of Liddifdale has a peculiar quality 
of banifliing the common rat from Teviotdale. It is cer- 
tain, that only a few years ago, carriers on their return to 
that country loaded their horfes with it, and carried it away 
for that purpofe. But it is affirmed, with more probabi- 
lity, that it is only fince the Norway rat was introduced,, 
that the common rat has been extirpated. 

Birds. — Black-cocks, groufe, partridges, grey plovers, 
wild ducks, fnipes, wood-pigeons, buzzards, flannels, owls, 
crows, ravens, herons, jackdaws, magpies, thruflies, black- 
birds, ftarlings, linnets, and gold-finches, frequent the woods. 
The bittern was formerly numerous, but is now feldom to 
be feen. The birds of paffage, that vifit us in. the fpiing, 
or beginning of fummer, are, the King's-fiftier, water crow, 
white and yellow feed birds, the black and fand martins, 
the fwallow, cuckoo, rail, curlew, green plover, fand lark, 
ftone chatterers, with different fpecies of gulls and Ihiel- 
drakes. Teal and widgeons are feen in fpring when the 
waters are fvvelled with rain. The birds that vifit us in 
autumn are, the fieldfare and the wood-cock. Eagles, or 
earfts, are frequently feen, but have no place of refidence 
here *. 

* A well autbenticaled inftance of the amazing ftrength of this bird oc- 
curred a few years ago upon the farm ot Roughlee in this parilh. One morn-

Several pits of marl are found on the farms of Flight, Kerf- 
hope, andTweeden, to appearance of excellent quahty;, 
but this, as weU as other treafures, are locked up from ufd 
by the want of roads. Befides, the coal mentioned at 
Lawftown, fome fmall crop feams appear on the Tweeden,

coal in feveral places, but no trials to any great extent 
have been made. Free-ftone quarries of excellent flone 
are every where found, excepting at the head of the Her- 
mitage, where there is nothing but blue whin-ftone. 

Medicinal Springs,— Thtr^ are feveral fprings in this pa- 
rlfti, ftrongly impregnated with fulphur. There is one at 
the head of it, in that part called the Dead Water, unfor- 
tunately fituated in the middle of that vaft morafs where 
the Liddal and the Tyne take their rife. In wet feafons 
it is weakened by the furrounding water. It is much fre- 
quented by perfons affliaed with cutaneous and fcrophulous 
complaints, who receive great benefit from it. They drink 
the water, and ufe it as a warm bath. But the patients

talons. Struck with the novelty of the fight, he kept his eye upon the 
bird, and faw him fit down at a little diftance. He ran to the fpot. when 
the eagle had difengaged from his talons a fine lamb, and was preparing 
to tear him in pieces, which the man refcued, and carried home. At 
. that inliant, a medical gentleman was vifiting a patient in the fliepherd's 
•family. He examined the lamb, found it a fine male, the Ikin of the 
Ihoulder torn, but the bone had prevented the talons from injuring the 
vital parts; he fewed up the wound, and it recovered and did well. On 
enquiry it was found, that the fhepherd ot Peel, the fame morning, faw

nre expofed to danger and incovenience from the want of 
proper accommodation. The wretched hovels in tlie 
Tieighbourhood being continually damp and wet. On the 
^rm of Dinlabyre, another fpring of the fame kind is 
found ; the colkaion of water is much greater, but at pre- 
fent almoft loft in the bog in which it is placed. A third 
IS on .the farm of Shortbuttrees, of excellent quality ; all 
thefe might be highly beneficial, if the ground were pro- 
perly drained and attended to. Avery ftrong mineral fpring 
-is found at Lawflown ; but as its water has not been anali- 
zed, it is uncertain to what clafs it belongs. 

Petrifying Water. ~I\itXQ are feveral fprings of this 
kind. One is found on the Tweeden, exceedingly power- 
ful, and containing a great quantity of water, where large 
mafles of petrified matter appear on every fide converted 
into folid ftone. The progrefs of the petrifaftion is diftinft 
and beautiful. The fog, which grows on the edge of the 
fpring, and is fprinkled with the water, is about eight 
inches high; the lower part is converted into folid ftone; 
the middle appears as if half frozen, and the top is green 
and flourill-iing. The petriSed matter, when burnt, is re- 
folved into very fine lime. The fpring itfelf, when led 
over the fields in little rills, fertiliz^es them exceedingly. 

Cafcadss. — There are feveral beautiful water-falls on the 
river Tweeden, the little ftreams of Dinlabjre, Har- 
den, and Sundhope. But on the river Blackburn, fuch 
fcenes are feen in all their beauty and variety. Some- 
times the river flioots over a perpendicular rock, in one 
unbroken flieet of water, forming a beautiful cafcade ; at 
other times it is darted over tremendous precipices, and 
rages furioufly among the huge maffes of the rock below. 
In this wild and romantic vale, nature appears in various

forms, now beantlful, then awful, fometlmes fublime, and 
•frequently terrible. The author of this account meafured 
the principal falls. One is 27 feet perpendicular in height, 
another 31! ; the breadth of the rock, pver which it falls, 
36 ; a third is 37^ in height, and 20 feet wide. 

Natural Bridge 0/ Stone. — One of the greateft curiofities 
to be feen in this country, or perhaps in Scotland, is a na- 
tural bridge of ftone over the fame river. It ftretches 
acrofs the ftream, and joins the hills on each fide. It is 
53 feet long, 10 feet wide, and the thicknefs of the arch is 
a feet 4 inches of folid ftone. It is not compofed of one 
entire rock, but has the appearance of many ftones about a 
foot and a half fquare, fet neatly together. The bridge 
flopes a little downwards, and the water rulhes under the 
arch, through an opening of 31 feet. 

Woods. — The natural woods confift of oak, afh, birch^ 
pnd alder. Gonfiderable plantations have been made of 
Scots fir, fpruce, larix, oak, afli, beech and plane. They 
are all in a thriving condition. There is at prefent grow- 
ing on the river Blackburn, an old afll tree, the trunk of 
which meafures 18 feet in circumference, one branch of it 
9 feet, and another 8 . The trunk is hollow within ; five 
perfons of ordinary fize may eafily fit in it at the fame 
time. Laft year the river Liddal, in the time of a high 
flood, threw up the trunk of an oak tree, oppofite to Hag- 
gihaugh, the feat of Colonel Elliot of Larifl:on. Not only 
the bark, bat great part of the wood, feems wafted by age ; 
notwithftanding which this venerable trunk, as it now lies, 
meafures 26 feet in length, and 10 feet in circumference, 
and is perfeftly ftraight. There is fcarcely a tree within 
view of the place where it lies, excepting a few Scotch firs.

Smollet mentions that Alexander II. built a caftle in Liddifdale, which 
gave fuch offence to Henry III. of England, that he made war upon the 
king of Scotland, 1240. This, in all probability, was the caftle of Her- 
mitage. Among the remarkable places in the county of Liddifdale^ 
Hedor Boece mentions " the Caftle of Hermitage, now demoliflied."

the remains of the ancient chapel of Hermitage f, now 
in ruins, in the middle of the burying ground ftill in ufe. 
The font is in the wall of the church-yard. The caftle of 
Clintwood, on the farm of Flight, appears to have been a 
very ftrong building ; the foundation, and a little part of 

the 

of Liddifdale, beat the Englifh out of all Teviotdale, and took the caftle 
of Heimitage in the year 1340. In this caftle Sir Alexander Ramfay of 
Dalhoufie was ftarved to death by the f^me Sir W. Douglas ; who, fired 
■with jealoufy becaufe Sir Alexander ^as made Sheriff of Teviotdale, 
furprifed him in the church of Hawick when holding an aflembly, carried 
him to the caftle, and thfew him into a dungeon with hii horfc's furni- 
ture.. This happened in X342 *. Some years ago, a mafon employed in 
building a dike in the neighbourhood, had the curiofity to penetrate into 
a vault in the eaft end of the caftle. Having made au opening, he de- 
fcended by a ladder 5 and in a vault, about 8 feet fcjnare, he found feve- 
ral human bones, with a faddle, a bridle, and fivord ; he brought out the 
bridle and fwoi d. The bit was of an uncommon fize ; the curb of it is 
in the polTeffion of Walter Scotr, Efq; Advocate. In the dungeon he 
found a great quantity of tl^e hulks of oats. Report fays, the granary of 
the caftle was immediately above thb vault, and thi\t Sir Alexander fub- 
Cfted for fome time on what fell down into the vault. From thefe cir. 
cumftantres it is highly probabiCj that the bones were thofe of that gen- 
tleman, and that this was the vault into which he was thrown, and ftar\'ed 
to death. This caftle was alfo vifited by the ill-fated Queen Mary, in the 
year 1561, on occ9fion of Bothwell's being wounded by John Elliot in

parilh derives its name, is fituated on the upp^r part of the 
glebe, and in former times muft have been impregnable on 
the E. and N. On the E. it is defended by a very deep 
ravine ; on the N. by the Liddal, and a precipice of more 
than 100 feet in height; and on the W. and b. by two 
ramparts of great ftrength, and a foffe of great depth. The 
only peel houfe that remains entire is Hudftioufe ; the 
vault is immenfely Qrong, and has had double doors, bolted 
on the infide *. 

Camps. — The principal camp Is on the top of Carby Hill. 
This hill is detached from all others, and commands a view 
of the whole country, and of all that pSrt of Cumberland, by 
Beefe-Caftle, l^c The camp is entirely circular, and occu- 
pies the whole fummit .of the hill ; it is fortified by a very 
flrong wall of Hones, and a road plainly appears to have 
been made up to it, winding round a part of the hill, and 
entering it on the fouth. It is about 100 feet diameter^ 
In the centre a fmall fpace is inclofed with a ftrong wall, 
and round it are 8 circles of different fizes f , all furrounded 
by a ftone wall, and all of them having had a door or open- 
ing to the eaft. On the fummit of the Side-hill, and nearly 
oppofite to Carby, on the north fide of the Liddal, ther,e is 
another ftrong encampment, nearly of a fquare form. It 
is 300 feet in diameter. The wall or rampart is entirely 
of earth, and "is about 18 feet high. This camp has none

of the interior circles of the former. On the farm of 
Fhght, and near to the caftle of Clintwood, there are two 
camps at a little diftance from each other ; the one round, 
and fortified with a ftone wall * about lOO feet diameter ; 
and the other fquare, about i68 feet in length, with two 
ramparts of earth f . 

PiBs Works.— -ThttQ are a great many round-abouts in 
the parifh, commonly called Bias Works. They are all 
circular, and ftrongly fortified by a wall, compofed of large 
ftones. They are frequently found, the one at a little di- 
ftance from, and oppofite to the other. There are tw? 
nigh Heeds-houfe, two on the farm of Shaws, one on Toft- 
holm, one on Foulfhiels, one on Cocklaw, one on Black- 
bum, and one on Shortbuttrees X- On the farm of Mill- 
burn there is a fmall circle enclofed by 9 ftones, which feems 
to have been a Druidical temple. Tradition fays Lord 
Soules was burnt there. The hill is called Nine- Stone Ridge, 

Cairns. — There are many cairns || in different places. 
The moft remarkable of thefe is on the farm of Whifgills. 

The 

* Tliis year ( i T93) the Wall was carried away to build a llone dike, 
and at a confiderable depth, among fome large ftones, there was found 
the head of fome weapon, or inftrument of fine brafs, 4^ inches long; 
the one end is fitted to receive a fliaftor handle, the other is widened, and 
is formed and fliarpened like the edge of a hatchet. The other article 
found has the appearance of a fmall fword of mixed metal, about three 
feet long, but was broken by the workman before the writer hereof could 
get them into his poffeflion. 

f A learned gentleman informs me, that a Roman legion wintered in 
Liddildale, cut down wood, and drained marfhes. 

t The ftones of this laft were lately removed ; and on the fouth fide 
there was found a place 10 feet wide, and ao feet long, paved with flat 
Hones, and inclofed by others on each fide, fet on edge, within which 
there fcnmed to be allies and burnt (ticks. 

II On the farm of Cleugh-head one was removed, and an urn found-full

The quantity of rtones is immenfe, and they are moftly of 
a very large lize. Near thefe, there is a large ftone fet on 
end, about 5 feet high, called t?je Standing Stone. This 
cairn is in the middle of an extenfive and deep mofs. It 
can be approached on horfe-back only on one fide, and that 
with much difficulty. There is not a ftone to be feen near 
it. — Upon the march between the pariflies of Caftletown 
and Canonby, and upon very high ground near to Tinnis-hill, 
there is a cairn of great extent, and confifting of free-ftones 
of great fize. It is 86 yards long •, it is not poflible to ap- 
proach it on horfe-back. The ftones are chiefly of a fquare 
form, of immenfe weight, and what is very remai-kable, 
there is not a ftone to be feen, nor a place where ftones could 
be found, within a great diftance of the place. At the 
north end of it, there are feveral large ftones fet on their 
edges, forming a f«juare, and covered over by one ftone. 
Near to the fouth end there is one ftanding perpendicular, 
evidently fo placed by the hand of man, 7 feet above the 
mofe, and 13 feet in circumference. This was anciently 
called the ftanding ftone, and was confidered the north boun- 
dary of Canonby, or the debateable land *. On examining 
the ground near it, I found five other ftones, nearly of an 
equal fize with the former, all inclining to, or lying on the 
ground, forming a circle, the diameter of which is 43 yards. 
How thefe ftones were colledled, for what purpofe, or what 
the circle has been, which is formed by ftones of fuch im- 
menfe weight and fize, I leave to others to determine.

Crofs. — At Milnholm there is a crofs of one flone, 8 feet 
4 inches high, fet in a bafe i foot 8 inches*. This is a 
piece of great antiquity. A fword 4 feet long is cut out 
on the S. fide of the crofe, and immediately above feveral 
letters, as will appear from the reprefentation of it in the 
plate. 

Difadvantages. — The difadvantages this country labours 
under, from the want of roads, are very great. Improve- 
ments to any confiderable extent can never be carried on 
while thefe are wanting, and the means of improvement 
which the country itfelf poflefles are locked up from ufe. 
The cottages, and moll of the farm houfes, are in very bad 
order. Another difadvantage arifes from the frofts in 
fpring, and the early part of harveft, to which the country 
is fometimes expofed, and which prove chiefly hurtful to 
the potatoes and peafe. 

CharaBer. — The people in general enjoy, in a reafon- 
able degree, the comforts of fociety, and are contented with 
their fituation. They are^by no means fond of a military 

life. 

* The tradition concerning it is this : — One of the governors of Her- 
mitage Caftle, fome fay Lord Soules, others Lord Douglas, having en- 
tertained a paffion for a young woman in the lower part of the paiifli, 
went to her houfe, and was met by her father, who, withing to conceal his 
daughter, was inftantly killed by the Governor. He was foon purfued 
by the people, and, in extreme danger, took refuge with Amiftrong of 
Mangeiton, who had influence enough to prevail on the people to defifl. 
from the purfuit, and by this means faved his life. Seemingly with a 
view to make a return for this favour, but fecretly jealous of the power 
and influence of Armftrong, he invited him to Hermitage Caftle. where, 
he was bafely murdered. He himfelf, in his turn, was killed by jock 0} 
the Si fc, of famous memory, and brjther to Annftrong. The crols was 
credlcd in memory of this tranfaclion, near to Ettleton church-yard, 
where he was buried, and almoft oppofite to Mangerton.

life. The majority are of the middle fize, but many of 
them confiderably above, and feveral under it. Notwith- 
ftanding the want of roads, and their great diftance from 
church, (many of them being 8, and even 10 miles diftant), 
they are remarkable for their general and conftant attend- 
ance on religious ordinances, and exemplary in their con- 
duct during the time of divine fervice. They make an 
excellent appearance on fuch, and on all other public oc- 
cafions ; they are clean and well drefled, in coloured vefts, 
and cloth of Englifli manufaflure. They are diftinguilbed 
by their hofpitality and humanity, ever willing to contri- 
bute to the relief of thofe in diftrefs *. Few law-fuits have 
pccurred ; no punilhments have been inflided ; and few or 
no traces of the border or barbarous cuftoms are now to be 
feen. It is impoffible to conclude this article without re- 
marking the ftriking contraft between the former and the 
prefent fituation of the country. The inhabitants feel the 
happy change, and are fenfible of the fuperior bleffings 
they enjoy. It was formerly the fcene of fierce conten- 
tion, of barbarous feuds, of plunder, and of defolation, 
when there was neither fecurity of property nor of life. At 
prefent we can only trace the foundations of the ancient 
caftles, the ftrong holds of their fierce pofleflbrs. Their ufe- 
lefs walls are thrown down, and converted into fiieep folds 
and their fwords have become rufted in their fcabbards, or 
have been almoft literally beaten into plough-fbares.

a place of ftrength. There is alfo towards the eaft of St 
Fort, the Upper and Nether Friartown, which, no doubt, 
were formerly inhabited by Popifh friars. 

Extent, Soil and Climate.— T\ii% parifli is about 4 Englifli 
miles in length, but not above 2 in breadth. A part of it 
is a ftrath from E. to W. the ground rifmg gently on each 
fide. Much of it is of a fouthern expofure. Another part 
of it lies bending towards the N. on the fide of the river 
Tay. The foil is for the moft part light, but is rendered 
fertile by the ufe of lime. Some of it is black other parts 
of a mixed nature. There is little clay foil in the parifli. 
The climate is healthy ; few epidemic diftempers prevail 
much here, except the fever, which now and then proves 
fatal to many. Some are now alive betwixt 80 and 90 
years of age. One is faid to be above 90. He lives on 
the ground of St Fort *. 

River^ Ferries, Coaji, Harbours, Fijh, ISc. — The river 
Tay runs along the northern fide of the parifli. On the 
oppofite fide of the river, which is about a miles in breadth, 
Hands the populous and flourifliing town of Dundee. 
There are two ferries on this fide of the river, Woodhaven

number of boats employed, fome of a larger, others of a 
leffer fize, fome of which, when the weather permits, crofs 
at aU tides. The tide is about half an hour later here than 
at Leith. Thefe ferries were much more frequented before 
the bridge was built over the Tay at Perth, than they have 
been fmce. Some of the ferrymen are fober and difcreet ; 
others of them borrow the language and behaviour of thofe 
who frequent the paffage, efpecially of fuch whom they 
look on as their fuperiors in rank and ftation. How much 
is it to be regretted, that from fb many of thefe they often 
learn to be rude and profane. The coaft extends along 
the north fide of the parilh. It is for the moft part rocky. 
The harbours at Woodhaven and Newport are very incon- 
fiderable, fit only for their boats, and a few floops, which 
are fometimes employed in importing coals, and exporting 
corn. On the banks of the river there are feveral falmon 
filings*, fome of which have of late increafed^in value. 
They are for the moft part carried on by means of what is

of lime, which, on our light and dry foil has the moft hap^ 
py effeas. The lime is driven in carts from the d.ftance of 
8 or 10 computed miles fome of the tenants bring it from 
Northumberland by fea. Their crops are by it enriched 
^hen the feafon is not too dry. Some lands that are marlhy 
have of late been greatly meliorated by draining. Robert 
Stewart, Efq; of St Fort, who is very aftive and mdu- 
ftrious, befides other improvements which he has made, 
has drained a piece of ground, which, during the wmter, 
was almoft covered with water. It was fit for nothmg but 
feeding a few young cattle in fummer ; and, though con- 
fifting of 52 acres, was fometimes let for about L. 5 or 
L 6. It is more than probable, that in a few years it will 
fet for upwards of L. 50 Sterling. What a bleffing is it to 
the country, when proprietors of land,, inftead of debauch- 
ing their neighbours by examples of intemperance, fet them 
patterns of aftivity and honeR induftry ! How is the bleff- 
ing enhanced, when, by their example, the people under 
them are led to fear God, and to reverence his fanftuary ! 
The negka of this feldom fails to ruin the morals of the 
people, and to deftroy their induftry. 

Produce.— Tht farmers raife a pretty large quantity of 
wheat, although it is reckoned to fcourge the ground but 
they are tempted to prefer this crop by the high prices, 
which are generally from L. I to L. i, 5 s. per boll. It is 
meafured with the fmall firlot, which is a great deal lefs 
than that ufed for oats and barley. They commonly have 
good crops of barley, and generally get a good price, from 
15 s. to 18 s. Sterling /)er boll. They have alfo tolerable 
crops of oats and peafc. The oats fell at from 12 s. to 14 s. 

per

per boll. Peafe are by no means a lucrative crop, but they 
ferve to meliorate the ground when the crop is rank, and 
the ftraw is excellent fodder for horfes. It is chiefly on 
thefe accounts that the farmers continue to fow them, for 
the price of peafe is generally low, and their returns very 
inconfiderable. The foil is very much adapted to the cul- 
ture of turnips ; of thefe they raife good crops, with which, 
during the winter, they feed their cows and cattle, fome of 
which they fatten for flaughter, and for which they fome- 
times draw good prices. They have alfo good crops of 
potatoes, from the light and dry foil. Thefe yield a falu- 
tary fupport to the poor people, when they do not ufe them 
to excefs. To this, however, they are ftrongly tempted, 
when the meal is high priced. On fuch occafions they feed 
upon them thrice a day, by which their health is fometimes 
hiirt. With the refufe, and the fmaller potatoes, they com- 
monly feed fwine, which they fait up for winter provifion. 
This praftice is become fo common of late, that the price 
of a young pig of a few weeks old is generally 7 s. 

Rents.-^Thexx rents are from L. 100 to L. 400 per an- 
num, and upwards. The tenants are all in eafy circum- 
flances, and fome of them are opulent. All of them are 
fober, aaive, and induftrious. Thofe of them that have 
lately got new tacks pay double, and fome almoft triple 
their old rents. Several of the tenants have fubfet fome 
acres of their ground, lying at a diftance from the farm 
ho^fes. They who enjoy thefe fmall poffeffions are called 
Pendiclers. Some of them have 10 or 12 acres, fome more, 
fome lefs.

Black Cattle.— Oi thefe a confiderable number 13 an- 
nually reared. Till of late years, they were employed 
in drawing the plough, but they are now feldom or never 
ufed. Inftead of two horfes and two oxen in the plough, 
which required a man fervant and a boy to.drive them, two 
horfes only are ufed, and one man manages both them and 
the plough at the fame time. This is a confiderable faving 
to the farmer, now when the wages are fo high ; and as the 
horfe plough moves quicker, more ground is ploughed in 
the fame time. It is the new plough that is ufed in this 
part of the country. 

Sheep.— ?QVtV2X flocks of thefe were formerly in the pa- 
rifh •, now there is but one. The tenants found the fheep 
very hurtful to their fown grafs, which, in the winter, they 
tore up by the roots. Their Sheep Walks are now, by 
means of lime, turned into good corn-fields, which they find 
to be more profitable. They may, however, at length be 
compelled to return to their former pra6lice of feeding 
flocks of fheep, to meliorate thofe fields which are at too 
great a diftanjce for driving dung to them ; when the ftrength 
of the lime is fpent, and they become unfit for producing 
crops of corn, the tedding of the flieep may be found necef- 
fary to recruit thefe fields. 

Minerals. — There is abundance of rock, fbme of a more 
hard, fome of a fofter nature. The firft is very proper for 
common buildings, the latter for the making of roads ; to 
improve which there is fuch an uncommon fpirit now hap- 
pily prevailing in this part of the nation. There is alfo 
much channel, well adapted to the fame purpofe. But there 
is no free ftone ; this is brought from the other fide of the 
Tay in boats, from a noted quarry in Angus-fhire, com- 
monly known by the name of MiUfield Quarry. 

7. Fuel. 



p4 Statijlical Account 

Fuel. — There were formerly fome peats dug out of the 
moffes in the parifti ; but the proprietors have prohibited this 
pradtice for many years pall. There are fome muirs that 
abound with whins ; fronrthefe the poor people get a part 
of their fuel. Coals are both fcarce and high priced. The 
land coal is driven from the diftance of 8 or lO computed 
miles. A quantity fuch as two horfes can conveniently 
draw, cotts about 7 s. 6 d.; an equal quantity, or rather 
larger, but of a much better quality, brought from Alloa 
and other places by fea, will coft 12 s. weighing about 112 
Hone weight. This makes the fuel coftly to the poor, 
many of whom, during the cold of winter, aggravated to 
them by their meagre diet, are not a little injured by the 
want of it. But amidft all their ftraits, it is truly pleafant 
to fee them poffeffing that cheerfulnefs and contentment 
which Chriftianity is fo much fitted to infpire. 

Population.-Th^ population is on the increafe. Several 
feus have been made on the banks of the river Tay, and 
feveral new buildings have been of late erefted on them.

rally employed in fplnning coarfe yarn, of which a kind of 
cloth is made that gets the name of Ojnahurgh. Of this 
the merchants in Dundee export large quantities ; but in 
this, as in moft other manufaftures, there is a very great 
ftagnation fince the commencement of the prefent war. 
They got I s. 6 d. for fpinning a fpindle of this yarn ; but 
fince the war it has been fo low as i s. and fometimes lo d. 
While the encouragement for fpinning was high, it was 
fometimes difficult for the tenants, and others, to get maid 
fervants. But though their gain was confiderable, yet the 
conftant fitting at the wheel, and the immoderate wafte of 
faliva, was by no means favourable to their health. Many 
of thefe people are employed in cutting down the corns in 
harveft. During this feafon they are uncommonly chear- 
ful and healthy -, but as this cxercife in the field is an ex- 
treme entirely oppofite to the fedentary life they gene- 
rally lead through the reft of the year, difagreeabie tS&amp;ets 
are fometimes felt after the harveft ; however, the dan- 
ger of this is not a little abated by their prefent man- 
ner of living during this feafon, which is upon oat bread 
and ale, which, when frefti and good, is a moft wholefome 
diet. How much preferable to that which was ufed fome years 
ago, vt%. fait meat and fait broth, and fometimes, it is faid, 
milk and fait herring? This, with their exceffive labour, 
could not fail to excite a moft painful thirft ; to quench 
which, as foon as they came to the Land^s End, as they call 
it, they went in qucft of cold water ; of which, when within 
their reach, having taken a plentiful fhare, they fat down 
to reft, without refleaing on the danger they were in, which 
it is faid, has in fome inftances proved fatal. 

Prices of Labour and Provifions.^K mafon commonly

fometimes rather more ; a tailor, 8 d. ; a weaver gets fo

labourer, when he works by the piece, will fometimes earn 
IS. 6 d or I s. 8d. a-day ; maid fervants get about L. 3 Ster- 
ling a-year ; men fer\'ants get from L. 6 to L. 10 Sterling \ 
the men fliearing in harveft get i s. per day, the women 
10 d. : but the generality of them are hired for a certain 
fum during the harveft •, the men from L. i, is. to L. i, 
5 s. and a lippie of lintfeed ; the women 16 s. or 17 s. and a 
lippie of ditto, fometimes half a peck.— The beft beef is for 
the moft part 4 d. per lb. (16 ounces) ; the mutton fells 
ufually at the fame rate ; the veal, early in the feafon, fells 
2x6 A. per Va. when plenty at 4 d. fometimes at 3d.; a 
hen I s. ; a goofe at 3 s.; eggs 4 d. per dozen ; rabbits, 
when flcinned, fell at 5 d. per pair ; their Ikins fell from 7 s. 
to 9 s. or 10 s. per dozen j cheefe at 5 s. per ftone ; pigeons 
at 5 d. the pair. Within thefe 20 years, 6r even lefs, pro- 
vilions are almoft doubled in their price. 

Church. — The King is the patron. The prefent incum- , 
bent, Mr James Burn *, is faid to have been the firft pre- 
fentee in Scotland of his prefent Majefty King George 
the III. having been admitted to this parifh in May 1761. 
He has a ftipend, communihus amis, about L. 80 Sterling, 
befides a manfe and glebe of about 6 acres. An augmen- 
tation of ftipend is in procefs. The church and manfe were 
repaired in 1771.

* His predecelTors were MclTrs Wedderburn, Nairn, RufTell, Gellatly,

for mnch the fame fpace of time, about 13 or 14 years, and that all of 
them, fave one, were tranflated to other pariflies. The prefent incum- 
bent bad it in his choice oftener than once tu have followed their exaia 
pie, but preferred his prefent fitualion.

Rellgmis SeSls. — There are not many Diflenters in the 
parifli ; only two Epifcopalians. and a few Antiburgher 
Seteders, moft of whom had left the Eftablilhed Church 
before the prefent incumbent was fettled here. Some of 
them left the Secellion, and came to the parifti church ; 
but when the new mode of finging without reading the 
line was inrroduced, they again withdrew, and carried two 
or three individuals along with them. They are fober and 
induftrious, not at all fo bigotted as are many of that feft ; 
they are very ufeful members of fociety. 

Poor. — There are no begging poor belonging to the pa- 
rifti, but many fuch from Perth and other places. By 
thefe, and travelling tinkers, this part of the country is not 
a little opprefled. It is much to be regretted that each parifli 
does not take care of its own poor, and hinder them from 
travelling abroad to other parifties. Befides the number 
of penfioners on the poors roll, which fometimes does not 
exceed 4, there are not a few who obtain a temporary fup- 
ply of 10 s. 15 s. or L. I, at a time when licknefs is in the 
family, or the head of it unable to work. Parents who are 
not able to pay for the education of their children, have 
them educated upon the poors funds, which are made up 
from the weekly colleftions on Sabbath, to which the fea- 
faring people, of all others, contribute moft liberally. The 
annual amount of the coUedlions is abov^ L. 14 Sterling. 
A farmer in the parifti, at his death, fonie few years ago, 
left a legacy of L. 20 Sterling. This made a confiderable 
addition to the fund, which has been more than doubled 
within thefe 30 years. It is managed by the kirk-feftion 
■with care and attention, without the leaft expence to the 
fund.

Chara&amp;cr. — They are generally fober and induftrious. 
A few years ago a fpirit of fmuggling too much prevailed 
in this corner, than which nothing is more ruinous to the 
health and morals of thofe who are addi6ted to it *. There 
is reafon to believe that little or no gain was made by that 
moft mifchievous traffic, of the efFefts of which the mini- 
fter, from time to time, ^did not fail to remind them from 
the pulpit. This ruinous traffic is now nearly annihilated 
among us •, and happy were it for the nation that the temp- 
tations to it were lefs frequent and powerful than they 
fometimes are. None of the people of this parifli have 
been the fubjed of a criminal procefs, nor have any of them 
emigrated.

* One young man, a tenant in the parifh, was moft unhappily addidled to 
it; in a few years he hurt many others, and ruined hinifelf. The laft time 
he called at the manfe, he exprefled his wi(h that he had followed the advice 
the minifter had often given him. — Had he done this, he had probably fuc- 
ceeded as a tenant, and efcaped thofe miferies which, by fmuggling, he un- 
happily brought upon himfelf. He lay in a pi ifon for feveral months, reduced 
to great indigence. This is mentioned as a warning to others, who by 
fmuggling hope to be made rich, but arc far more likely to become 
ruined, and to entail mifery and mifchief on themfelves and others.

Situation and Extents 

'np'HE parlfh KiUearn forms the weftern extremity of 
the Strath of Blane. This beautiful valley exhibits 
a landfcape, replete with a great variety of ftriking objects. 
It is fkirted by two ridges of hills, fome of which are of 
confiderable height. The fore ground is enriched by the 
water of Blane, meandring through fertile paftures and Well 
cultivated fields ; whilft the diverfified profpedl:, extending 
over the parifhes of Killearn, Drymen, Kilmaronock,

reaion, come into view on the one hand, and a limpid 
ftream, forming a delightful cafcade, on the other. Here a 
verdant wood, in variegated windings, ikirts the fides of 
the hills i and there a deep glen, hollowed out by the work 
of many ages, lays open to view noc a fmall part of the 
bowels of the earth. In one point of light may be feen the 
ruins of an ancient caftle *, once the well fortified habita- 
tion of atich and powerful family ; and in another, a nu- 
merous aock, fcattered like fnowy fpecks on the verdant 
declivities of the mountains. Few places in Scotland af- 
ford a greater diverfity of the grand and pifturefque fcenes 
of nature, grouped together in fuch pleafing varieties- 
This parifti is bounded by the parifhes of Strathblane and 
Campfie, on the S. E. ; by New and Old Kilpatricks, on 
the S. and S. W. ■■, Drymen and Dumbarton, on the W. ; 
Balfrone, on the N. ; and Fintrie, on the E. It is by com- 
putation about 12 miles in length, from N. E. to S. W- 
and at an average, in breadth. 

Population. — If is inhabited by 206 families, 56 of whom 
live in the village of Killearn, which contains 223 perfohs. 
The 150 families refiding in the country, reckoning five 
individuab to each, will include 750 inhabitants, making 
in whole 973 fouls. The population in the year 1755 was 
959. Soon after this time it greatly decreafed, owing 
chiefly to the demolition of cottages, to each of which was 
commonly annexed a paffle of two or three acres of lancL 
Lately, however, from^the rapid advance of trade, the popu- 
lation has been greatly on the increafe. By the following 
table of births, as they Hand inrolled in the parochial re- 
cords, it will appear that the prefent population is not fo 
great as at a century ago.

G.«^/m.;^. ^-.fl^., S^^-.— About a mile and a half fouth of 
the village is the Place of Killearn, anciently the feat of a 
cadet of the Montrofe family, but lately oi Robert Scott of 
Killearn, Efq, and now the property of the Right Hon. 
James Montgomery, Lord Chif Baron for Scotland. The 
prefcut edifice, which is far from being large, was built in 
the year 1688. Numerous plantations, regularly difpofed 
in form of clumps, belts, and wilderneffes, beautify and 
flielter an extenfive traa of pleafure ground round the houfe. 

Croj, fituated about a mile from Killearn place, received 
the greateft part of its prefent improvements, about 30 
years ago, from its then proprietor, Robert Muirhead, Efq; 
merchant, Glafgow. About 50 acres around the manfion- 
houfe are laid out in planting, difpofed in the moft advanta- 
geous manner for IheJter and ornament. Amongft the na- 
tural beauties of Croy may be mentioned Dualt glen. The 
fides of this delightful recefs are very fteep,and, for a long 
courfe, exhibit a great variety of trees and Ihrubs, grouped 
together in almoft every conceivable form, whilft the under 
herbage difplays'not a few rare indigenous plants in great 
perfeftion. Foot paths, cut out alongft the windings of the 
banks, command, in various points of light, many beauti- 
fully diverfified profpedls. The head of the glen is ter- 
minated 'by a freellone rock, nearly perpendicular, about 

60 



of Killearn. 



60 feet in height, over which the rivulet of Dualt, falling 
precipitately into a deep Linn, forms a delightful cafcade, 
which adds not a little to the grandeur and folemnity of 
the fcene. About half a mile from Dilalt glen, and in the 
eftate of Croy, is AJhdow, which exhibits a fcenery in many 
relpe33 peculiarly ftriking. It conlifts of a high rock, over 
which the water of Carnock precipitately falls, and, by the 
work of many ages, has cut out for itfelf a deep and wind- 
ing paflage. The projecting rocks, on both fides the water, 
are wild beyond defcription. Nearly meeting at the top, 
in fome places, they widen below into beautiful curva- 
tures, naturally hollowed out in various direftions. The 
romantic appearance of the rocks is fet off to advantage by 
trees and Ihrubs hanging, in great profufion, over the clefts. 
The rivulet daftiing over the precipice, and rumbling 
through the deep- worn channel ; the united harmony of a 
great variety of the feathered tribe ; and the dark fhade, 
which perpetually refts upon a great part of this pifturefque 
fcenery, confpire to fill the mind of the beholder with the 
moft pleafing ideas of the grand, the delightful, and the 
folemn. The eftate of Croy, now the property of William 
Richard/on of Croy, Efq; Profeffor of Humanity in the Uni- 
•verfity of Glafgow, is receiving daily improvements. 

Ballikinrain, the property and fummer refidence of i?o- 
bert bunmore of Ballindaloch, Efq; occupies one of the moft 
pleafant fituations in this part of the country. The man- 
fion-houfe, which is of a modern conftruftion, is by far the 
moft elegant and commodious dweiling-houfe in the parifti. 
The eftate, before it came by marriage into Mr Dunmore's 
poflbflion, belonged for feveral centuries to the Napiers of 
Ballikinrain. The laft proprietor, John Napier of Balli- 
kinrain, Efq; was ftxtee?ith of the name and family of 
Napier, who, in fucceflion, pofl-elTed the eftate. It is now 
enriched with many agricultural improvements, efpecially 

inclofures

mclofures and planting, which are highly ornamental as- 
well as profitable. 

On the eftate of Balglafs, likewife the property of Mr 
Dunmore, and adjoining to Ballikinrain, is a large dwelling- 
houfe or caftle, of an antiquated conftruftion. It is re- 
ported that this place was anciently well fortified, and that 
Sir William Wallace of Elerjlie, the brave defender of his 
country, once found it a fafe retreat in time of danger. 
This place is rendered conrpicuous by the Carries or Curries 
of Balglafs. They are femicircular excavations, naturally 
hollowed out in the weftern extremity of that ridge of hills, 
commonly known by the name of Campfie and Strath- 
blane Fells. Some of the Corries are very fpacious, being 
more than a mile diameter. In feveral places they beau- 
tifully exhibit the various mineral flrata, of which the 
mountains are compofed. 

At no great diftance from Ballikinrain are Balquhan 
(vulgarly Rohan) and Carbeth ; the former, belonging to 
Thomas Buchanan of Balquhan, Efq; and the latter to 'John 
Buchanan of Carbeth, Efq. Around the manfion-houfes 
on both eftates are plantations and inclofures to a confider- 
sile extent. 

No fpot in the parifii, or perhaps in Scotland, has a bet- 
ter claim to the attention of the public, than the indifput- 
able^ birth-place of George Buchanan, the celebrated 
poet and hiftorian. That great man, whofe name is de- 
fervedly famous through Europe, was born at a place 
called the Mofs, a fmall farm-houfe on the bank of the 
water of Blane, and about two miles from the village of 
Killearn. The farm was the property of George Bucha- 
nan's father, and was for a long time polTeffed by the name 
of Buchanan. It is now the property of Mr William Fin- 
lay of Mofs, and holds of the family of Drummikill, from 

which

which George's anceftors defcended. The place is called 
the Mofs, becaufe it is fituated in the vicinity of a peat- 
mofs, which is part of the farm. The dwelling-houfe, con- 
fidered as a building, is very far from being confpicuous ; 
although it is no worfe, and probably never was worfe than 
the ordinary fartn-houfes in this part of the country. Its 
appearance of meannefe arifes from its being very low, and 
covered with ftraw thatch. Part of it, however, has been 
rebuilt, fince the year 1506, when George was born. Mr 
Finlay is highly to be commended for preferving, as much 
as poffible, the ancient conftrudtion and appearance of this 
far famed and much honoured houfe. The moft fuperb 
edifice would fink into oblivion, when compared with the 
humble birth-place of George Buchanan. Long may the 
Mofs ofKillearn afford mankind a ftriking proof that the 
Genius of learning does not always prefer the lofty abodes 
of the great and powerful. It muft, however, be remarked, 
that the parents of Buchanan, although not very opulent, 
yet were not in abjeft or indigent circumftances. The 
farm, which confifts of a plough of land, was able, by the 
aid of induftry and oeconomy, to keep them eafy. A place 
in the neighbourhood is, to this day, called Heriot's Shiels^

The gentlemen of this parilh and neighbourhood, led 
by a laudable ambition to contribute a teftimony of refpeft 
to their learned countryman, lately ereaed, by voluntary 
fubfcnption. a beautiful Monument to his memory. By 
fuch public marks of approbation beftowed upon good and 
great men, the living may reap advantage from the dead. 
Emulation is thereby excited, and the adive po^yers of the 
mind ftimulated by an ardour to excel in whatever is 
praifeworthy. Buchanan's monument is fituated in the 
village of Killearn, and commands an extenfive profpeft. 
It is a well-proportioned Obelijk, 19 feet fquare at the bafis, 
^nd reaching to the height of 103 feet above the ground. 
Jn the middle is a cavitj of 6 feet fquare at the bottom, 
gradually diminiibing until it reaches the height of 54 feet, 
where it becomes fo narrow as to receive the end of a 
Norway pole, which is continued to the top of the obelilk. 
To this pole, the machinery for raifipg up the materials 
for building, was fixed. Owing to this peculiar mode of 
conftruaion, the monument is believed to be much ftrong- 
er than if it were folid. The foundation was laid, in the 
month of June 1788, by the Reverend James Graham, 
minifter of the parifli. In the foundation-'llone was de- 
pofited a cryjlal bottle hermetically fealed, containing a fij- 
yer medal, on which was engraved the following infcrip-

This beautiful ftrufture is built of a white millftone- 
grit found a little above the village of Killearn, and in the 
eftate of the Lord Chief Baron. The quarry from which 
it was taken has been wrought for a long time paft, and is 
very extenfive : It was known by the name of the Lettre- 
hill Quarry, from the name of the ground ; afterwards it 
was called the Mill-ftone Quarry, becaufe mill-ftones were 
frequently taken from it; then the Houfe of Monirofe 
Quarry, becaufe it afforded ftones for the Duke of Mon- 
trofe's houfe at Buchanan ; now it is called the Monument 
Quarry. The ftone is not of a very courfe grit, but is ex- 
tremtly hard and durable. 

Gartnefs. — The Pot of Gartnefs, in the water of Enrick, 
has, for its beauty and lingularity, always attraded the at- 
tention of ftrangers. It is a deep linn, fhaped like a cal- 
dron or pot, whence the origin of the name. It is occa- 
lioned by the fall of the water over a rock that lies acrofs 
the river ; the fall is not perpendicular, but is interrupted 
by three or four breaks. This romantic and well known 
fpot affords no little entertainment to the angler; as the 
falmon and trout fi-om Lochlomond, being frequently un- 
able to force their way over the rock, which requires two 
or three great leaps quickly made, are detained in the linn,

and taken fometimes in great numbers.-.At thi's place, 
but on the Dryraen fide of the water* is Gartnefs mill, 
which has long maintained a high reputation for grain land 
Imt. The remarkable fervices done the public bj this 
mill during the great froft in the year 1740, were fo fea- 
fonable, that they will not for a long time be forgotten. 
It fortunately happened, that in 1739 the mill received a 
new wheel of a very good conftruaion. It was made of 
black faugh (willow) that grew at Touch, a few miles 
from Stirling. This kind of wood, of all others, was then 
preferred for making mill-wheels ; its excellency was fup- 
pofed to confift in toughnefs and durability. Owing to 
the ftrength and other properties of the wheel, Gartnefs- 
mill was, by the aid of a conftant fire, kept a-going during 
the feverity of the froft, when all other mills, for a great 
way round, were entirely flopped. Corn at that time was 
brought to Gartnefs from great diftances, and thereby ma- 
ny families were kept from ftarving. — Adjoining the mill 
are the remains of an old houfe in which Johk Napier 
of Merchifton, inventor of the logarithms, refided a great 
part of his time (for fome years) when he was making his 
calculations. It is reported, that the noife of the cafcade 
being conftant, never gave him uneafinels, but that the 
clack of the mill, which was only occafional, greatly di- 
fturbed his thoughts. He was, therefore, when in deep 
ftudy, fometimes under the necefllty of defiring the miller 
to flop the mill, that the train of his ideas might not be in- 
terrupted. He ufed frequently, in the evening, to walk 
out in his night gown and cap. This, with fome things 
which to the vulgar appeared rather odd, fixed on him the 
charafter of a xvarlock. It was firmly believed, and cur- 
rently reported that he was in compact with the devil ; and 

that

that the time he fpent in ftudy was fpent in learning the 
black art, and holding converfation with Old Nick. But 
John Napier was not the only great man who, in days of 
ignorance, was fuppofed to be a wizard ; nor were the vul- 
gar in this neighbourhood the only people who belie^ved 
in witchcraft. 

^adrupeds, Birds, i^c — This parifli is not remarkable 
for any of the more uncommon produdtions of nature. The 
fox, badger and foumart, are no Itrangers to fome of the 
glens and rocks. Aflidow is particularly noted for the 
haunts of owls, hawks, kaws, and wild cats. The currie 
of Balglals has long been remarked for an eagle that hat- 
ches her young in that fequeftered and rocky fpot. He- 
rons have their periodical haunts in feveral places of the 
pariQi, as at Balglafs and Corbeth, where in tall fir-trees 
they annually bring forth their young. The king's-fiflier 
has been obferved at Croy, on the banks of the Blane, a 
river much refembling the muddy and flow-flowing wa- 
ters chiefly frequented by that beautiful bird. Jays, mag- 
pies and bulfinches abound in the plantations at the hill 
of Killearn, and fome of the neighbouring banks. 

Ftyh. — Few places in Scotland afford better entertain- 
ment for the angler than this parifli, there being a great 
number of rivulets and brooks abounding with trout, of 
which Lochlomond affords in great plenty a perpetual fup- 
ply. Salmon, pike, and eels of different kinds, frequent 
the Enrick and Blane ; but no fifli in greater numbers, at 
a certain feafon of the year, than the braife (roach, Eng.) 
Vaft fhoals come up from Lochlomond, and by nets are 
caught in thoufands. Their emigrations from the loch, 
however, are only for the fpace of three or four days about

the end of May. The parr is, through the whole year, a* 
inhabitant of the Enrick ; but it is in greateft perfedioii 
about the beginning of harveft. Some of them more than 
a foot in length, have been caught at Gartnefs. 

Plants, Trees, Wr.— Great varieties of indigenous plants 
ornament the numerous glens, rocks, and muirs. The Ju- 
niper grows in fome places to a great fize, and is com- 
monly very prolific. The ftone bridge over the Blane, at 
the Mofs, is founded upon a layer of juniper bullies. It is 
believed that this plant, when in a wet fituation below 
ground, refills corruption for a very long time. It was be- 
lieved, during the plague in Scotland, that people who 
lived in the immediate neighbourhood of places abounding 
with juniper, or who burned it plentifully in their houfes, 
were not readily, if at all afFefted with the plague. The 
Scottifli Gaul, (Myrica Gale, Linn.), a valuable vermi- 
fuge, abounds in feveral places of the parifli. Were the 
qualities of this oderiferous llirub more generally known, 
its cultivation would probably be attended with confider- 
able profit. Amongft the plants which are not generally 
very common, are the Feftuca ovina vimpara ; Echium 
-oulgare, Imperatoria OJlruthium, Parnaffia palujlris. Poly- 
gonum Tenfyhanicum, Adoxa Mofchatellinn, Eryfimum 
Barharea, Chryfofplenium Altervifolium, Sasifraga hypi 
noides, Matricaria Parthenium, Empetrum nigrum, Afple- 
nium Scolopendrimn, A. Ruta muraria, Poly podium Lon- 
chitis, P. phegopteris, P. fragile, Lycopodium clavatum, 
L. Selaginoidcs, L. Selago, L. Alpmnni. 

The Sambucus nigra (eMer tree. Eng.) is no ftranger 
in many places of the parifli. Some of the trees are very 
well fliaped, and by the natural bending of the branches 
caufe an agreeable fliade, or bower, exhibiting an example 
of the propriety of the name given to that fpecies of plants 



in 



of Killearn. 



Ill 



an Scotland, namely, the Bower-tree. A great number of 
beautiful oaks ornament the eftate of Ballikuirain. The 
largeft, and probably the oldeft in the parifh, grows in full 
vigour at Killearn place. The trunk, is i2 feet circum- 
ference, and fupports many ftately branches that widely 
difplay a foliage uncommonly pleafant. No produftion of 
the vegetable kingdom in this parifh is, however, more re- 
markable than two large yew trees at Ballikinrain. One 
is the berry bearing kind, the other not. The trunk of the 
former is 8 feet in circumference, of the latter, lo feet 8 
inches. They are only 9 feet feparate from each other, 
making the appearance, at a diftance, of a lingle tree only ; 
they are about 60 feet in height. Nine large branches 
flrike off from the male plant, at the height of 6 feet from 
the ground : they make a beautiful curve downwards, fo 
that their extremities touch the earth, and cover an area of 
i8 yards diameter, forming a- moft agreeable fbade, impe- 
netrable at ail times to rain. As there is no account, even 
by tradition, when they were planted, their age muft be 
great. They are frequented by a confiderable number of 
the golden crefted wren, (Motacila Kegulus J, the fmalleft 
bird in Europe, and, except the humming bird, probably ' 
in the world. They build their nefts under the curving 
extremities of the branches, where the foliage is thickeft. 
Their nefts are conftrufted with exquifite art, and are fuf- 
pended under the twigs, like fo many little baikets from 
the ceiling of a room. 

This part of the country is far from being deftitute of 
exotic plants in a high degree of perfedion. This is par- 
ticularly the cafe with refpeft to the larix, a great number 
of which adorn the banks and inclofures at the houfe of 
Killearn. They are about 60 years old, being among the 
firft of the kind that were planted in the open field in Scot- 
land 5 they are generally 3 feet diameter at the thickeft, 

and

and have grown to the tallnefs of nearly loo feet. For 
beauty and fize very few, if any of the kind in Scotland 
furpafs them. In the vicinity of the larixes are many beau^ 
tiful fpruce and beech trees, of uncommonly large dimen- 
fions. The oriental mapple, the fweet chefnut and tulip 
trees have, in this place, arrived to great perfedion and 
beauty. 

Minerals, l^c. — With refpeft to the mineral kingdom, 
few things in this parifh merit particular attention. The 
higher parts of the hills confift chiefly of a decompofible 
whinftone, containing, in fome places, fmall veins of an h«- 
matitical iron ore ; but the quantity yet difcovered is too 
fmall to become an objeft of importance. In fome places 
on the fides of the hills, are found many fucceflive ftrata of 
till and limeftone. Thefe are beautifully difplayed in fe- 
veral places where large excavations have been made by 
means of water. The limeftone is of two kinds, and is 
•wrought but in fmall quantities. The preferable kind is 
not difpofed in regular compaft ftrata, but rather in irre- 
gular mafles, imbedded in a reddifti clay blotched with 
white. The inferior kind is called camflone, from its being 
chiefly found in glens. It is difpofed in thin, but nume- 
rous regular ftrata, feparated from each other by a bluifli 
till, that, when afted upon by the weather, falls down into 
clay. The camftone, when broken, has a fmooth furface ; 
it contains a great proportionable quantity of clay in its 
compofition ; and after it is fufficiently burnt, and whilft 
red hot in the fire, it muft be flacked with water poured 
upon it, otherwife it will not readily fall down into lime. 
The ftrata are fo thin, that they are not thought to be worth 
working. Fragments of the ftone, which fall down from 
the fides of the glens, are occafionally gathered for ufe. 
Some varieties of it, which crumble down by expofure to 
the weather, might, without being burnt, ferve for the 

purpofe

purpofe of manure. An extenfive ftratum of an excellent 
millftone grit enriches the eftate of Balglafe, and fupplies 
the country to a great diftance with millftones. The quar- 
ry began to be regularly wrought about 40 years ago ; it 
is now cut down to the depth of 24 feet, and can aiFord 
ftones of any fize, and of 3 different qualities. A very 
thick ftratum of foft freeftone, the grit not fine, prevails in 
all the lower grounds of the parifh ; its depth has not yet 
been difcovered. It is of a red colour, but variegated with 
blotches, and flreaks of white and grey. It is not of the 
beft quality for building, and affords no fymptoms of any 
valuable mineral in the vicinity. Several trials, by boring 
and Jhanking, have been made to find coal, but unfuccefs- 
fuUy ; and I do not think that any where in the parilh 
the fymptoms of that ufeful foflil are favourable. Amongft 
the ftones in this parifli may be mentioned a jafper, which 
abounds in the banks of Enrick, and likewife in the pa- 
riflies of Buchanan, Balfrone, and Fintry. The colours are 
brown, red and green intermixed, in the form of blotches 
and ramifications •, fome nodules refemble the bloodftone, 
whilft others contain a copfiderable portion of the zoned 
agate, which abounds in many places of Scotland. The 
jafper takes a fine polifla, and has been cut into feals, but- 
tons, 'iJc. 

Climate. — The climate is wet and cold, but the air is not 
infalubrious. The inhabitants are not remarkably fubjeiSl 
to any epidemical difeafe. Many of thenl live to a confi- 
derable old age : There are four perfons at prefent between 
80 and 90 years of age. John Buchanan of Provanftoun, 
aged 104, died here anno 1792. 

Agriculture. — The moft of the hilly part of the parifli is 
yet in a ftate of nature, having never been plowed ; but 
Vol. XVI. P the

the lower grounds are generally arable. The former con- 
tains feveral extenflve moors and molTes, which are chiefly 
occupied in fiieep-walks ; the latter, (not the half of the 
extent of the parifli), is for the mofl part inclofed with 
ftone-dikes and hedges. The foil is, for the moft part, 
of a fiifF claj that becomes exccffively hard when dry, and 
generally has a wet cold tilly bottom. In fome diftrias, 
however, are a few fields of a loamy foil, which produce 
good crops of oats, barley and peaf^. The climate is very 
unfavourable for the culture of wheat ; but the cultivation 
of lint, potatoes, ryegrafs and clover, is attended with pro- 
fit. There is, however, more cropped with oats than with 
all the reft put together. The cultivation of turnip in the 
open field is not praftifed, although, from fome few trials 
that were made on that profitable root, there is reafon to 
believe that it might be attended with confiderable advan- 
tage in feveral thoufand acres in the parifli. Extremely 
few of the lately improved implements of hulbandry have 
here been brought into praiSlice. The common Scotch 
plough, wrought with four horfes, is in general ufe. The 
farmer, before agriculture can be brought to any tolerable 
degree of perfection, muft direft his «care to free his land 
from under water, which almoft univerfally prevails. But 
the pradllce of draining, although very much needecf, meets 
here with fmall attention. 

Few places afford better opportunities for irrigation than 
this parilli. The country is abundantly fupplied with ex- 
cellent water that pours down from the adjacent heights in 
fprings and fmall rivulets, which could eafily be dire£led 
over the numerous declivities. This mode of improvement 
was a few years ago tried with fuccefs in Mr Dunmore's 
eftate. The land over which the water was made to flow, 
produced grafs uncommonly luxuriant, and retained through 
tlie v/hole year a fine verdure. 

Attention 



of Killearn. 



1X5; 



Attentr^n is beginning to be paid to the breeding of 
milch-cows by crolling the Ayrfliire with the native breed, 
which approaches nearly to the Highland. The native 
cows are generally of a black colour, with white faces ; 
and weigh, when fat, about l6 ftone heavy weight. The 
milk, of a cow per day in fummer, is commonly about 4^ 
pints Scotch. The milk is moftly made into butter, that 
brings at an average gd. per lb. The Ikimmed milk is 
made into cheefe that is fold from 4 s. to 5 s. per ftone. 
Grazing cattle for flaughter is, in many parts of the parifli, 
carried to a confiderable extent, and is attended with pro- 
fit. The moorland farms are flocked with about 14CO 
fcore of the black and grey faced ftieep. A few Spanifh 
{beep were, in the beginning of 1793, brought by Mr Dun- 
more to Ballikinrain, and are thriving very well. Horfes 
for the draught are of the Lanarkfhire breed, and are chief- 
ly purchafed at Glafgow and Rutherglen markets. Not a 
few of the farmers, however, are in the pradlice of rearing 
horfes on their farms. Two-wheeled carts, and waggons 
with one horfe, are very generally ufed ; but fledges are 
found to be neceffary in the moorland farms. 

The arable land is in general divided into farms of about 
60 acres each. Thefe are let in leafes chiefly of 19 years du- 
ration. The lands in the eflate of Killearn are, for the en- 
couragement of the farmer, generally let in leafes of three 
19 years ; and the confeqaences are far from being bad, 
for the tenants are, on the whole, doing very well. Care, 
however, is very properly tak:n by the Lord Chief Baron, 
to give this encouragement only to pevfons of aftive and in- 
duftrious habits, and who have a fpirit for agricultui'al im- 
provements. Long leafes to an indolent farmer,even although 
at certain terms there may be a proportionated rife in the 
rent, only encourages his infuperable indolence. He feeks 
no more than merely to fcrape togetlier as much as will

barely pay the rent, and keep his family in life The 
land IS worn out to the iaft ; his domeftics are trained up in 
habits ot neghgence and floth ; a bad example is fet before 
the community ;-and Poverty flares with her meagre 
countenance, m the lioufe and in the field. 

The moorland farms are feveral hundred acres in extent. 
The great diiparity of foil and fituation, occafions a fimilar 
difparity of the rent of land. From lo s. to 15 s. per acre 
is a common rent for arable land ; but fome of it is no 
higher than 6 s. or 7 s. Some places, efpecially on the 
banks of Blane and Enrick, where the foil is very good, 
are ufually rented at L. i, 10 s. /,^r acre ; but in many 
parts of the moors an acre is ngt worth more than 6 d. and 
in the moffes not worth i d. The increafe of manufaftures 
in the neighbourhood, and the advancement of agricultural 
improvements^ for which there is great room in the parifh, 
will probably raife confiderably the value of land. The 
pariQi is fupplied with feven corn-mills and two lint-mills, 
which have abundance of water all times of the year. To 
thefe mills the moft part of the parifli yet continues to be 
aftrifted. 

Trade. — Every encouragement is given the farmer by 
having a profitable and ready market in Balfrorie, to which 
he has an eafy accefs. The late rapid population of that 
newly ere£led village, has greatly improved the adjacent 
country. This pleafing alteration arifes wholly from a 
variety of manufadtures, recently introduce^ into the neigh- 
bourhood, chiefly by Robert Dunmore of BallindalJoch, Efq. 
This public-fpirited gentleman, infpired with the am- 
bition of doing good to mankind by employing them in 
ufeful induftry, began his improvements in the year 1788, 
by eftabliftiing a muflin manufactory at Balfrone. This 
village, which is in the immediate neighbourhood of Kil-

iearn, and which formerly contained no more than fix or 
feven families, was at that time laid out according to a re- 
gular plan, and now contams no fewer than 220 families. 
The houfes, many of which are 2 ftories high, are in general 
covered with flate. The BalUkinrain cotton-mill was erefted 
by Mr Dunmore in 1 792. It is conftrufted for fpiuning wool- 
len as well as cotton-, the former for the carpet, the latter for 
the rauflin manufadure. This work, at prefent carried on 
under the management of Mr Robert Macmorran from 
Douglafs, employs about 100 perions, moft of whom refide 
in the neighbourhood of the mill. The greateft manufac- 
turing work, in the parifli is Enrick prinifield, which was 
begun in 1792. The operative part of the bufinefs is car- 
ried on by Mr J. F. Moriar, a Swifs, under the firm of 
Meflrs .Vlonteich, Warren, and Company, Glafgow. The 
buildings are conftrufted to contain 16 printing prefles, to 
go by water, and 72 tables for block-printing, beildes 
boiling-houfes, dye-houfes, X^c. for executing bufinefs on a 
very extenfive fcale. Every part of the apparatus is new, 
and of the moll approved conftruftion, efpecially the wafh- 
ing wheels, which are not furpaffed by any in Europe. One 
of the bleaching* fields, confiding of a plain of 15 acres, is 
fecured from the inundations of Enrick by an artificial 
bank, the raifing of which coft a confiderable fum of mo- 
ney. Bufinefs was begun here in the month of June 1703. 
But unfortunately an entire fl:op was almoft put to the 
work by the prefent flagnation of trade, which has com- 
municated its baneful influence through all this country. 
The whole work at prefent (Sept. 1793) employs no 
more than 250 perfons, the moft of whom refide in Bal- 
frone.

ftoemakars,i2; tailors, 5 , weavers, 28 ; Wrights, 14.- 
Mafons and wrights receive i s. 8 d. a-day, during fum- 
mer, and from i s. to i s. 2 d. in winter. TaUors work in 
their employers houfes, each receiving, befides his viduals. 
10 d. for his day's work. The hofiers are all employed 
by manufafturers in GlafgQ^y, and are paid by the piece. 
. A day labourer has from 8 d. to i s. a-day, with viftuals ; 
and I s. 3 d. or I s. 4 d. without viftuals. A man-fervant 
for country work has from L. 3 to L. 5 Sterling, per half- 
year, befides bed, board and wafhing ; a woman-ft-rvant 
has about L. 2. All the flioemakers are engaged in cujlo- 
mary luork, a common expreffion for home confumpt. In 
this alfo all the weavers are at prefent employed. That 
fo many looms ihould be engaged in cuftomary work for 
fo fmall a number of people, ceafes to be a wonder when 
it is confidefed that very little cloth of foreign manufaaure 
is worn in the parifh. The inhabitants continue the prac- 
tice of making cloth for their own wearing. The men are 
decently clothed, both for kirk and market, with well-dref- 
fed Scots cloth, commonly of a brown, grey, or blue colour. 
In this they think themfelves to be warmer and more com- 
fortable than in the beft Englifti fuperfine. The womens 
apparel is chiefly a variety of fluffs of their own manufac- 
ture ; as Bengals, a kind of cloth of linen warp, and cotton 
weft ; drugget, compofed of linen warp and woollen weft ; 
hariis, and other coarfe linens of various kinds, befides 
plaiding, both tweeled and plain, for gowns and petticoats.

M of flieep farms In the parifh. They praftife the arts 
of fcouring and bleaching their woollen and linen, which, 
for the fafety of both yarn and cloth, they prefer to the 
methods iifed in feme bleachfields. A lye made of brec- 
kins {pteris aquilina, Linn.) is of great ufe to them, both 
for wafhing and bleaching. The method of preparing this 
lye is very fimple. The breckins are cut when arrived at 
their full growth, and always when dry. As foon as con- 
venient after being cut, they are mixed with dried broom ; 
both are laid in a heap, and burned. No more broom is 
ufed than what is neceflary to affift in thoroughly burning 
them. Along with the broom is fometimes added the 
dried roots of cabbages and green kail. The aflies of the 
whole are carefully collefted, and boiled in water until all 
the alkali is diffolved ; then the lye is poured off for ufe. 
In this lye the yarn or cloth is boiled for a certain time -, 
and the bleaching is thereby greatly accelerated. Not a 
few of the inhabitants dye a confiderable variety of colours, 
from materials the produft of the country. In the proper 
management of their cloth, however, they are greatly af- 
fifted by Mr William 'Jamifon, dyer and clothdrefler at 
Runroy near Gartnefs, who has brought the dyeing and 
drefling of Scots cloth to a confiderable degree of perfec- 
tion. Cloth is fent him to be dyed and drefied from Glaf- 
gow, Stirling, and all the country round. Mr Jamifon 
manufactures plaids, duffles, blankets, 'i^c. ISc. for fale ; 
and his demands are daily increafing. 

In addition to what the induflrious women of Killearn 
make for their family wear, they bring a confiderable 
quantity of cloth to the market. As much ufually of

at three fairs annually held in the village of KiUearn- 
Scots cloth is fold from lo d. to 5 s. 6 d. per yard; 
harn from 8 d. to i s. 5 d. ; Imen from i s. 6 d. to 3 s. 

By a community fo aftively employed, little time is 
wafted in idlenefe, intemperance, or political cabals. There 
are, however five public houfes in the parilh, but they are 
chiefly frequented by travellers. Two turnpike-roads, 
lately made through the parilli, are of great fervice to the 
inhabitants. The ftatute-labour, which is moftly raifed in 
money at 18 s. Sterling per L. loc Scots of valued rent, is 
applied to private roads, which are ftill far from being in a 
good condition. 

The greateft impediment to improvements in this part 
of the country is the fcarcity of good fuel. The neareft coal 
is in Campfie or Baldernock, at the diftance of lo or xx 
miles. The price at the hill is i s. 6 d. the cart-load, con- 
taining about 12 cwt. The carriage comes to about 4 s. The 
fcarcity of coal is fupplied by turf and peat, for obtaining 
which the feuars and tenants have a fervitude on the moors. 
The turf is procui;ed by fetting fire to the grafs and heath 
about the month of June, and then raifing the furface with 
what is called a Jimighter fpade. This pradlice greatly in- 
jures the moors by depriving them of their verdure, which 
nectlTarily requires feverai years to be renewed. The lofs, 
however, is in fome meafure repaid by the great quantity 
of alhes for manure, procured from this kind of fuel. 

Religion. — -With refpeft to the ftate of religion, few obfer- 
vations occur that merit the attention of the public. The peo- 
ple in general regularly attend divine fervice in the parifli 
church. There are only about 12 adherents to the different 
parties of Seceders. Several refpedl.ible clergymen, fince 
the reformation from Popery, have fuccelTively been mi- 
nifters of the pariil), as Meff, Forfter, GiUelpie, Sempell and 

Craig,

Craig, before the Revolution in 1668. Since that time the 
people have been happy under the fuccefsful miniftry of 
MeflVs George Park, James Bain, James Morrilon, and the 
prefent incumbent, James Graham, who was ordained 
anno 1768. The church was rebuilt in the year 1734, and 
is conveniently feated. Mr John Finlayfon has, for nearly 
40 years, officiated as parochial fchoolmafter. The falary 
is L. 8, 13 s. yearly. The wages for Englifli, writing, and 
arithmetic are only is. 6 d. /)fr quarter. Three or four 
private fchools have, for fome time paft, been kept in dif- 
ferent parts of the parifli ; the numerous rivulets and deep 
glens by which the country is interfered, render, to child- 
ren living at a diftance, the accefs to the parochial fchool 
always dangerous, and often irapolTible. 

State of the Poor. — Paupers ufually on the feflion-Ilfl are 
from 10 to 15, who, according to their need, receive from 
4 s. to x6s. per quarter. A few indigent families receive, 
after the facrament, a little fupply, as the minifter and 
elders fee proper. The funds for anfwering thefe chari- 
table purpofes amount annually to about L. 30, the moft of 
which is colledled in boxes handed by the elders through 
the church, immediately before pronouncing the blefllng in 
the forenoon. None of the poor are permitted to beg. To 
be fo poor as to need afliftance from the kirk-feffiqn is in 
this, and moft other places of Scotland, where poor taxes 
are not eftablifhed, accounted a difgrace, as fuch a ftate is 
commonly confidered as. proceeding, for the moft part, 
either from indolence or mifmanagement. Every attempt 
to eradicate, or even to weaken Inch a fenfe of fliame, is 
doing a manifeft injury to fociety.

quantity of fait into the firft railk of a cow after calving, 
that is given any perfon to drink. This is done with a 
view to prevent Jkaith, if it ftiould happen that the perfon 
is not cany. A certain quantity of cow dung is forced in- 
to the mouth of a calf immediately after it is calved, or at 
leaft before it receives any meat ; owing to this, the vul- 
gar believe that witches and fairies can have no power ever 
after to injure the calf. But thefe, and fuch like fuperfti- 
tious cufloms, are every day more and more lofing their in- 
fluence. 

At Blarejfen Spout-head, if we believe tradition, a bloody 
battle was fought between the Romans and Scots; feveral 
ftones ftit on edge have continued evet- fiuce to dlftinguifh 
the fpot. The tenant, a few years ago, would have car- 
ried all the flones awar, had he not been ftriftly prohibited 
by Mr Buchanan of Carbeth, the proprietor' of the ground, 
\vho had got notice of his intentions. 

A very large cairn fome time ago was demolifhed in the 
muir of Killearn, and the ftones ufed for building dikes. 
This ancient fepulchral tumulus concealed, in the bottom 
of it, a coPiin, compofed of ftones fo very large that they 
could not eafily be removed, without being firft broken in 
pieces. 

A phenomenon not unworthy the attention of the public, 
is an old woman, who, owing to exceftive grief, about 20 
years ago, became deranged in her judgment. She wasr 
then about 50 years of her age. The hair of her head 
foon afterwards became tliin and rery grey, in which ftate 
ic continued till about 5 years ago, when it gradually turned 
black, thick, and ftrong. She generally goes with her head 
bare, and has not yet recovered the right ufe of her realon.

the gills ; it is then cut up at the back, on each fide the 
bone or chain, as it is commonly called. The bone is ta- 
ken out, but the tail, with two or three inches of the bone 
is left ; the head is cut off ; all the guts are taken out bnt 
the Ikin of the belly is left uncut ; the fifli is then laid, with 
the Ikin undermofl, on a board, and is well rubbed, and 
covered over with a mixture of equal quantities of com- 
mon fait and Jamaica pepper. Some of this mixture is 
carefully fpread under the fins to prevent them from cor- 
rupting, which they are exceedingly ready to do, efpecially 
if the weather is warm. A board with a large ftone is 
fometimes laid upon the fifh, with a view to make the fait 
penetrate into it more eifedlually. In fome places, as 
Dumbarton, inftead of a flat board, a fliallow wooden 
trough is ufed, by which means the brine is kept about 
the fifti ; fometimes two or three falmonjj are kippered in 
the fame veffel at the fame time, one being Inid upon the 
other. The fifh, with the board or trough, is fet in a cool 
place for two or three days ; it is then removed from the 
board, and again rubbed with fait and pepper, after which 
it is hung up by the tail, and expofed to the rays of the 
fun, or the heat of the fire. Care is preyioufly taken to 
flretch out the fifh by means of fmall flicks or hoops placed 
acrofs it from fide to fide. After it has remained in the 
heat a few days, it is hung up in the kitchen, or other dry 
place, till ufed. Every method is taken to keep the fifh 
from putrefaSion. It is an error to fuppofe, as fome have 
ignorantly done, that kippered falmon means corrupted 
falraon. 

Some people, in order to give tiie kipper a peculiar 
tafte, highly relifhed by not a few, carefully fmoke it with 
peat reek, or the reek of Juniper bufhes. This is com- 
monly done by hanging it up fo near a chimney in which 
peats, or Jnnipcr bufiies are burnt, as that it receives the 

fmoke.

time it generally acquires the tafte. Salmon kippered in 
this manner ulually fells 2 d. per lb. higher than when frefli. 

This parifli and neighbourhood were, for a long time, 
unhappily t xpofed to the plundering inroads of large com- 
panies of migratory freebooters, who for fafety lurked in 
the borders of the Highlands. Thefe depredators made 
frequent incurlions into the parifhes of Buchanan, Balfrone, 
Killearn, Dumbarton, Kilpatricks, "iJc. and carried off all 
the cattle they could find. This infamous praftice was 
concinued fo late as the year 1743, and perhaps later. 
Long before that, however, fome gentlemen near the bor- 
der of the Highlands, undertook, for certain fums of money, 
to proted the property of their neighbours, or to make a 
full recompence for what was ftolen from them. The 
money paid for this proteftion was called the Black Mail, 
and "was paid agreeably to a bargain concluded upon by the 
two contrafting parties. One of the original contrails re- 
mains in the poffeffion of Mr Dunmore at Ballikinrain». 
As this ^ontraft is not only a literary curiofity, but is per- 
haps the only contract of the kind now exifting, and as it 
exhibits a true pi£lure of the ftate of the country fo late as 
the year 1741, and likewife leads us to foriA an idea of the 
happy alteration that has lince taken place, the fubjoined 
copy of it verbatim will not, it is prefumed, be unaccept- 
able to the public, efpecially as the report of the Black 
Mail is fo generally, yet fo imperfeftly known *.

Extent, Situation, Surface. 

rr^B.'E parifti of Newburn, is, on an average, about 3i 
Englifh miles long, and ^ broad, is filuated in the 
Preftytery of St Andrew's, and Synod of Fife, bounded 
on the E. by Kilconquhar •, on the W. by Largo-, by 
part of both thefe parifhes on the N. and on the S. by the 
fea. The foil in general is very fertile, and produces ex- 
cellent crops. Almoft the whole land in the panfh is 
-arable and inclofed. The late Mr Craigie of LawhUl 
(now Hall-hill) began inclofing, and the farmers feem fully 
convinced of its advantages. Wheat grew here more than 
half a century ago ; but a far greater quantity is raifed 
now than before. Turnips and potatoes were mtroduced 
many years ago likewife ; but the former, owing to the 



of Newburn. i^i 

natural fertility of the foil, and the improved ftate of agri- 
culture, have been cultivated with remarkable fuccefs. The 
luxuriant turnip-crops in this dillrift in favourable feafons, 
might arreft the attention of the traveller, who has vifited 
more fortunate climes. 

Population and State of the Poor The population in 

1755 was 438 fouls. The number of fouls was found by 
the minifter, in the courfe of his parochial vifitation in 
April 1794, to amount exaftly to 456. From a recent 
enumeration it appeared, that the inhabitants under 10 
years of age were 142. The annual average of births for 
the laft 10 years appears from the regifter to be 12. The 
annual average of marriages is 3, and that of deaths 6. 
Though the climate is favourable to longevity, and epi- 
demical diftempers feldom prevail, infeftion is communi- 
cated when any malignant difeafe does appear, by the 
common people reforting from all quarters to the apart- 
ments of the fick, without adopting any means whic^ 
would tend to prevent its difFufion. Far be it from any 
Chriftian to difcourage innocent expreffions of friendfhip 
to the diftreffed ; yet the attendance of many idle vifi 
tors on the fick is extremely culpable. They not only 
hurt.^.;..infeveral refpeds, but alfo endanger their own 
hves, and tbofe of their neighbours. On thefe accounts the 
indifcrxminate praa^ce of vifiting the fick, whether it pro 
ceeds from an impertinent curiofity, or amiftak.n principle 
of benevolence, is often attended with the molt fatal efFefts 
Jiut wherever prejudice or culiom, in fpite of falutary re- 
monl ranee, leads every one to do that which is right in 

one s own eyes," many of confequence will do wrong.

intereft of a confiderable fum of money appropriated to 
them. The relief granted to each individual varies ac- 
cording to the circumftances of the cafe. Befide their 
ftated allowance, occafional fnpply is given where it is 
judged neceffary. The poor are maintained in their uwn 
houfes ; and, on an average, the annual fum expended for 
their fupport, may be about L. 13 Sterling. But relief is 
not confined to thefe penfioners alone. The eftablifhed 
provifion for the benefit of the indigent, enables the church- 
feffion to extend their charity, and receive the applications 
of fa^rnlies who are reduced to the neceffity of foliciting 
affittance, in confequence of accidental misfortunes. Church- 
feflions are geiierally allowed to be the molt faithful adrai- 
niltrators of the funds for the maintenance of the poor-, 
and indeed, their judicious arrangements have merited the 
approbation of the moft enlightened part of the commu- 
nity. 

EccleJlaPcal State of the Parijh.-U has been often re. 
niarked, that Newburn, for many years paft, has been a 
nurfery of Seceders ; and remarked with furpnfe, that a 
fmall arm of the fea (hould be the boundary between mo- 
deration and fanaticlfm. Gameronians, Independents per- 
fons belonging to the Burgher Congregation, and alfo to

ments does not prevent focial intercourfe, and mutual good 
(jfEces. 

In defcribing the general chara£ler of the people, it is 
hut juftice to pronounce them fober, regular, induftrious. 
Humanity, too, it muft be mentioned to their honour, 
holds a confpicuous place in the catalogue of their virtues. 
It is but juftice alfo to add, that of late no addition has 
been made to the number of Seceders in this parilh; 
on the contrary, one of the elders of the Relief Congre- 
gation has returned to the Eftabliftied Church ; rational 
religion feems to be gaining ground ; and the fmall re- 
mainder of enthufiafra vpili moft probably die with them

The patronefs of the parilh is Mrs Halket Craigie of 
Hall-hill. T here are 7 heritors ; at prefent only 3 of them 
refide in the parifh. The benefice here is one of thofe 
which greatly requires increafe ; and a procefs of augmen- 
tation is about to be commenced. The money-ftipend at 
prefent is L. 40 : 11 : i Sterling, and ihe viftual-ftipend 
confifts only of 7 bolls of wheat, 32 bolls i peck oif bear, 
and 24 bolls, 3 firlots, 3 pecks of oats. The glebe fcarcelj 
includes 4 acres. The vi(ftua.l ftipend, at an average, is 
but L. 40 Sterling per annum, as part of the lands which 
pay flipend are of an inferior quality. 

School.— Tht parochial fchool is of confiderable repute. 
Several gentlemen's fons refort to it for education, which 
they receive on very moderate terms. Englilh is taught 
for X s. 6 d. i writing and Englifli for 2 s. ; arithmetic for 
2 s. 6 d. ; and Latin for 2 s. 6 d. per quarter. The local

and the youth are not expofed to the contagion of thof©

About the middle of the laft century, John Wood, Efq; 
proprietor of the lands of Orkie, deftined that property 
after his death for ereding a free grammar fchool in the 
parifli of Drumelry, alias Newburn, and maintaining fix 
poor fcholars thereat. The rent of thefe lands is now 
about L. 140 Sterling per a?iitu?n, and the parochial 
fchoolmafter educates and maintains the poor fcholars on 
Mr Wood's mortification, as it is called in Scottifh law 
language for he officiates in a double capacity, being 
chcfen both by the heritors and the patrons of the mor- 
tification alrep-d}' mentioned. By the deed, • Sir Thomas 
' Gourlay of Kincraig,' 'ijc. * the minifter of Newburn,'

* tification in all time coming.' Boys of the firname of 
Wood are always to have a preference. 

'Price of Labour and Promjions. — The yearly wages of 
farm-fervants is about L. 7 for men, and L. 3 for women, 
befide their viftuals. The wages of the day-labourer is 
I s. i in time of harveft they are rather higher ; for mow-

The average price of beef is 3I A. perlh. \ of veal, 34 d. ; 
and of mutton the fame. The price of a hen, at an average, 
is I s. •, of a duck, 9 d. ; of a pig fit for table, 5 s. Butter

Improvements fuggejled. — Befides putting thq. roads ia 
Letter repair, the eftablifhtnent of a more regular market 
would alio be a very confiderable advantage in this part oP 
the country. Another difadvantage, under which not 
only this, but the adjacent parifhes labour, is the weight 
of bread being left entirely to the will of the baker. 
Wherever this is the cafe, the confumer is liable to fuf- 
fer lofs; and the very exemption from any regulation on 
this point is a temptation to injuftice. A remedy cer- 
tainly exifts "fome where, and it ought to be fpeedily ap- 
plied. To remove the local inconvenience complained of, 
or rather the general evil, might not the bread be occa! 
fionally infpeded by fome proper perfon appointed for that 
purpofe by the juftices of the peace? And wherever the 
weight is found deficient, let the bread be given to the 
poor. The very idea of being fubjed to the jurifdiftion of 
the juftices of peace, or of feeling the confequences of the 
complaints lodged with them, would operate as a powerful 
reflramt on men who have it in their power to impofe 
both on the rich and the poor, it is faid, by charging what 
they chufe for a loaf, which might be purchafed in other 
places, where there is a check and controuling power over 
bakers, for a far more reafonable price. While fome of 
the people complain of imaginary grievances under the 
happy conftitution where they live, it is hoped the real 
one now fpecified will be removed as foon as it is poffible.

ANCIENTLY KILTARAGLAW, 



(County of Inverness, Synod of Glenelg, and 
Presbytery of Sky.) 



By Mr Alexander Campbell, Schoolmafter, Portree.</head>


<p>
Name, Situation, Extent, Uc. 

PORTREE was a part of Snizort till the year 1726, 
when it was erefted into a feparate parilh ; and is fo 
called from its excellent' harbour of the fame name. Port- 
ree, or rather Port a Rio, (the King's Harbour), is a Gaelic 
word, compounded of Port, Harbour, and Rio, a King. 
This name was probably given to it as far back as the 
thirveenth century, in the reign of Alexander HI. of Scot- 
land, when Haco, King of Norwaj, after his dreadful over- 
throw at the Largs by Alexander Stutivt, great-grand/atier 
of him, who, the firft of th^t name, reigned in Scotland, 
put in there with the remains of his Ihipwrecked fleet ; or, 
as fome would have it, not till the times of James V. m

confequence of that monarch's putting in there, in his tour 
through the Hebrides. It is fituated in the prefbyterj of 
Sky, Synod of Glenelg, and County of Invernefs. Its 
length from N. to S. is 9 computed miles, and its breadth 
throughout 3, befides the iflands of Raafay and Ronay, that 
form a great part of it; the former of which, extending 
all along the coaft, is of the fame length, and from 3 to x\ 
miles broad. Ronay is about 4 miles long, and near 2 
broad ; and the whole parifh may contain an area of 41,900 
fquare acres. It is bounded on the N. by Snizort ; on the, 
E. by the channel or found that divides Raafay and Ronay 
from Applecrofs and Gairl6ch ; on the S. by Strath ; and 
on the W. by an extenfive moor that feparates it from 
Bracadale. 

The variety of its hills, vallies, and plains, and the pro- 
fpedt of the Sound, which, excepting in fome places on the 
coaft, where it opens to the view, prefents itfelf in the like- 
nefs of lochs or lakes, give the country a very agreeable 
and piaurefque appearance, particularly in the milder fea- 
fonsoftheyear; and throughout this part of the High- 
lands, fcarcely any two places can boaft of fituations more 
beautiful and pleafant, than the place of Portree and Cla~ 
Chan, or Kirktown, in the fouth end of Raafay, the pro- 
pnetor's feat.- On the W. Raafay rifes with a feemingly 
eafy afcent, to a great height above the fea, and terminates 
in a fmall, round, and green hill, flat at the top, and faced 
with rock, called Dun4an, from its fimilarity, perhaps, at a 
diftance. to thefe Daniih forts, that go under the general 
name of hune^, frequent in the Highlands and iflands • 
the meaning of the laft part of the name is not certainly 
known. On tlie E. fide of the ifland, the coaft is very 
high, fteep, and nearly approaching to a perpendicular; as 
IS a fo the coaft of Portree, on each fide the m.uth of tl 
harbour; but more efpecially on the N. where huge cliffs

of ftupendous height, and magnificently grand, rife ons 
above another *. At the bottom of thefe rocks above the 
fhore, for more than i-4th of a mile in length, is a decli- 
vity which, though fteep, of difficult accefs, and every 
where interfperfed with large loofe ftones that fall from 
the cliffs above, yields fuch excellent pafture, that the gen- 
tleman who poffeffes the farm to which it belongs, at the 
riik of lofing fome of them over the precipices, fends there 
every fummer a part even of his milk cows. Here as well 
as over all Sky, from the height of the hills and proximity 
of the fea, the air feldom continues long of the fame tem- 
perature •, fometimes it is dry, oftener moift, and in the 
latter end of winter and beginning of fpring, cold and pier- 
cing; at an average, three days in twelve throughout the 
year, fcarcely free from rain, far lefs from clouds. Thefe, 
attraftedby the hills, fometimes break in ufeful and refrefli- 
ing (bowers ; at other times fuddenly burfting, pour down 
their contents with tremendous noife, in impetuous torrents 
that deluge the plains below, and render the fmalleft rivu- 
let impaffable ; which, together with the ftormy winds fo 
common in this country, in the months of Auguft and 
September, frequently blaft the hopes, and difappomt the 
expectations of the huibandman. Snow has been often 
known to lie on the ground from three to feven weeks; 
and on the higheft hills, even in the middle of June, fome 
fpots of it are to be feen. To this various temperature of 
the air, and uncertainty of weather, the fevers and agues, 
headachs, rheumatifms, colds, and dyfenteries, which are 
the prevalent diftempers, may be afcribed. That it is iar,

Jrowever, from being unwholfome, is fufficiently evinced 
by experience ; for the inhabitants are, in general, as ftrong 
and healthy, and arrive at as advanced an age, as thofe who 
live in milder climates, and under a ferener iky. The 
gout is not known as a diftemper afFedling the inhabitants. 

Hills, Woods, Lakes, and Rivers. — The moft remarkable 
hill in the parilh, is that which, W. S. W. of the harbour, 
nfes above it, firft, with an eafy and gentle acclivity, but 
becomes fteeper nearer the top. It is called Ait Suidhe 
Tbuin, or Fingal's fitting place, becaufe on the top of it is 
a green hillock, on which, fays tradition, Fingal was wont 
to fit in ftate, point out the different courfes, and furvey 
his heroes purfuing the chace. - From this hillock, in a 
clear day, the lofty hills of Cuillin and Strath, the parifiies 
of Duirinifli and Bracadale, the Long Illand, North and 
South Uift, and Barra may be feeh ; as likewife the weft 
fide of Troternifti, Portree, Raafay, Applecrofs, Loch- 
Carron, and the interjacent feas. The fides of the hill are 
covered with feveral farms of different fizes ; and, except 
m fome places N. and S. and towards the top, which is 
either rocky, or covered with heath, the whole is good pa- 
fture or arable ground. Nearly oppofite to this hill, at a 
mile's diftance, S. E. of the harbour, rifes Bein-Dean-a- 
hhaig, or the hill of his defence, having alfo on its top a 
green hillock, called Cruachan Mhic Swain, (Macfwain's 
eminence), remarkable only for its fimilarity to that on 
the top of Ait Suidhe Thuik, excepting the tradition, that 
a fon of Swain, or Sueno, a Daniffi or Norwegian king, lies 
buried there, may be thought deferving of notice. On the 
fide of Bein-Dian-a-bhaig, that looks towards Raafay, and 
'^hich IS extremely fteep, rifes a number of rocks of coni 
cal form, green at their tops, or covered with heath ; be, 

tween 



^4^ Statijlical Account 



tween thefe rocks run fmall hollow vales, where flicep and 
goat find pallure ; and at the bottom of the hill, on the 
fame fide, are feveral caves in which fea fowl and wild 
pigeons nelUe, and into fome of which the fea, at high 
water, enters. The hill itfelf, on account of its height and 
peculiar form, is an infallible mark of the fituation and 
place of the harbour. On the Hopes of Ait Suidhe Thuin^ 
N. W. from the harbour, are to be feen the remains of a 
natural wood, confillmg chiefly of birch and alder, which 
about 20 years ago, ic is faid, was in a tolerable good con- 
dition, but is now much decayed. About 30 years ago, 
fome firs were planted on the farm of Scorrih-eae, north fide 
of the entry to Portree j but, on account of its eafterly ex- 
pofure, and the fea air, they did not thrive well. No more 
than 500 or 600 trees, well flieltered, have arrived at any 
degree of perfection. In Raafay, there are two or three 
fpots of natural wood, which, being iifually well kept, are 
of no fmall ufe to the inhabitants and their neighbours, 
and of cnfiderable emolument to the proprietor. The 
late Raafay planted feveral fpots near his houfe, of which 
the parts better flieltered have done well ; thofe more ex- 
pofed have thriven but indiiferently. 

There are many frefli water lochs, of which two only 
are worthy of notice, Loch fad and Loch-leathan, or the 
Long Loch and Broad Loch, one of them being long, and 
the other fliorter, but much broader. They are in the 
north end of the parifli, very highly fituated, of confider- 
able extent, and contain great plenty of white and red 
trout, flounder, and eel. The trout of Loch-leathen are in 
general ve I y large, fome of them weighing from i to 2, 
or 2| lb. Tiiey have no communication with the fea, but 
one from Loch-leathen, over a very high and extraordinary 
fteep prt'cipice, which forms a fingular and curious cafcade, 
that hom the. fea below appears beautiful and grand be-

jond defcription. The moft confiderable rivers are thofe 
of Higichari and Glenhhargil, which fcarcely deferve to be 
mentioned, but for the falmon caught in them in autumn 
and the latter end of fummer. The former, formed by 
many ftreams rifmg in the hills of Cuillifi and Stratb, run 
through a glen that divides MingnilK in Bracadale from 
the fodth end of Portree, and difcharges itfelf into an inlet 
of the fea, called Loch-Jligichan, two miles well of Sconfer. 
Having no bridge, in times of heavy rains the ftream is fo 
violent and impetuous, that travellers dare not approach it. 
The latter derives its fource from feveral fmall lochs in 
the moor N. W. of Higiedan, and after haviug run 2 miles 
through it, continues its courfe further for a mile and a 
half along the valley at the foot Ait Suidhe "Ihuin into 
Portree Loch. 

Antiquities and Curio^ties.— There are two Dunes, or 
Danifli forts, of round form, that bear marks of a very 
high antiquity, one old caftle, formerly the feat of the 
Lairds of Raafay ; and two Roman Catholic chapels. One 
of the dunes is fituated on the coaft ; the other, inland. Of 
this laft, fcarcely 6 feet above the foundation remain and 
withm it is full of rubbifh; the other is in a more entire 
ftate, and, like moft of the fame kind in the Highlands and 
iflands, feem to have been built by the Daniih or Norwe 
gian mvaders, rather as watch towers and ftrbng holds to 
receive and fecure their plunder, than as places of conllant 
or comfortable habitation. Ca/i/e Broichin, lituated near 
the north end of Raafay, on the eaft coaft, is a land-mark 
 well known to mariners. The rock on which it ftands 
nearly round, and covering an area of little more than 70' 
feet fquare, ,s about 40 feet high, except in one place 
where was the ftair that led to it ; and is itfelf, caftle like' 
placed on another rock, 60 feet at leaft above the level of

the fea. It is compofed of different kinds of burnt ftone 
lime, and fhelJ, that have all the appearance of being jum- 
bled together, fonae time or other, by a volcanic eruption, 
and is of fuch firm and folid confiftence, that the largeft 
hammer, wielded by the ftrongeft arm, could fcarcely 
make any impreffion upon it. There are feveral rocks of 
the fame kind in that part of the ifland ; one of ^hich, 
more curious than the reft, rifes higher than that on which 
the caftle ftands, clofe by it, like an old and ruinous wall, 
from 5 to 8 feet broad, and 40 long, and in moft places it 
is covered with ivy. This curious rock, on account of its 
ruinous and decayed appearance, was called Broichin, and 
from it the caftle got its name. The caftle was built with 
ftone and lime, is two ftoreys high, befides an attic one; 
the rooms are all very fmall, except one, fuppofed to be 
the kitchen, and two others, about 11 feet fquare, and as 
many high, in which are chimneys. In the middle was a 
fmall open court, in which was a well, but whether fup- 
plied with water from a fountain in the hill above, orfroift 
the rock itfelf, is not known. It is not long fince the 
laft part of the roof came down, and fome broken joifts 
ftill remain fticking out in the fides of fome of the rooms. 
John Garbh is faid to be the laft who dwelled in it. This 
John Garbh was one of the predecefiTors of the pre- 
fent Laird of Raafay, and lived in the times of James VI. 
of Scotland. He was remarkably ftout and athletic, of 
extraordinary perfonal ftrength and valour, and therefore 
was furnamed Garbh, a word which is exprefiive of lufti- 
nefs and ablenefs of body. Many are the ftories related 
regarding his afts of provvefs and fortitude, as likewife of 
feverals of his countrymen, who are faid to have been in 
p-eneral of more than ordinary fize and ftoutnefs, but border- 
ing rather on the marvellous, feera not altogether worthy 
of much credit.

With regard to the Roman Catholic chapels, no man 
alive remembers to have feen any of them with a roof 
on them; the walls are pretty entire. One of them is in 
Kirktown in Raafay, and is furrounded with a plantation of 
trees. In one of its windows are the bones of a man, ama- 
zingly large, preferved by the inhabitants with a kind of 
religious care, as a monument of the great ftrength and 
lize of their forefathers, though the prefent generation is 
in thefe refpeds but little fuperior to their neighbours. 
For the fame reafon they (hew, about the middle of the 
ifland, near the high road, a large round ftone, which they 
fay "yohn Garbh, the forefaid chief, and one or two of his 
people, ufed to lift on their knees : Such is its weight, that 
fcarcely could the united ftrength of two of the ftouteft men 
now to be found in the country be able to raife it one inch 
from the ground. On the right hand, coming into Portree 
between the towering cliffs above mentioned, and where 
the fir was fome time ago unfuccefsfuUy planted, is a high 
rock, waflied at the foot in fome places by the fea ; on the 
top of this rock is a beautiful plain, confiding of near 4 
acres of good arable ground ; and above it is a fteep decli- 
vity, almoft equally high with the rock below. Near the 
weft end of this plain is the other Roman Catholic chapel 
formerly mentioned ; and there, before Portree was ere£led 
into a feparate parifli, and fome time afterwards, was th&amp; 
only burying ground in this end of the barony of Troter- 
nilh ; but now, on account of its retired fituation, it is al- 
moft entirely given up, a new place of interment being 
marked out at the church of Portree, about 45 years ago, 
Where the whole people have at length begun to bury their 
dead. Down through the declivity two oblique path* 
were made to the plain and chapel; and two others lead 
from the Ihore, one at each end of the rock below. In 
different parts of the plain are fnrings of excellent water •

and at the bottom of a rock, near the top of the declivity 
above, IS a cave, fuppofed to be very deep, into which, far- 
ther than 12 yards, few have ever thought proper to enter. 
Near ij yards within its mouth it becomes darker, and 
begins to defcend -, if a ftone be thrown down here, it is 
for fome time heard to make a kind of rattling noife, as if 
it were tumbling doxvn a flone ftair, to the found of which 
the cave echoes extraordinary loud ; but whether, when 
the found feems to ceafe, the ftone reaches the bottom, or 
the cave takes a different direaion, cannot be determined. 
About i4 mile from hence, along the iliore, down towards 
the north, are two other caves that merit particular atten- 
tion. One of them is extremely narrow without ; but 
within becomes very fpacious and higli ; capable of con- 
taining with eafe at leafl: 500 perfons. Below its mouth, 
up from high water mark to the level of the cave, the hoi- 
low rock is faced with a perpendicular wall, of large plain 
ftone, about 12 feet high, having feveral fteps fo narrow, 
that only one man can afcend at a time. Within, the air 
freely circulates ; in the middle is a well ; and if they had 
no fire arms, one man could eafily defend the paftage 
againft a hoft of foes r fo that it feems to have been defign- 
ed both by nature and art, as a place of fecure retreat, 
though, if the tradition be true, it proved otherwife to one 
party that retired to it for fafety. For the ftory goe^, that 
in the troublefome and barbarous times, when the neigh- 
bouring diftri£ts plundered and deftroyed each other, and 
the weak were always a prey to the ftrong, many often re- 
treated to this cave as a place of concealment and fecurity. 
At one time, however, they within, deeming themfelves,

thered to death in their fleep, or niiferably perilhed in the 
flames. In confirmation of this tr3dition, a man, not long 
fince dead, found, about 60 years ago, a large brafs kettle 
in a dark corner in the farther end of the cave, an*d bones 
of different lizes are ftill to be feen in it. It abounds in 
JlalaBites, which partly hang from the arch above, and 
partly fall down; many of them having feveral holes 
through and through, and are great curiofities. The other 
cave is not far diftant, and is fuppofed to be feveral miles 
deep. It is faid of this cave, that, a very long time paft, 
a piper, and four other men, with two maftiffs and lighted 
candles, went in to it for the purpofe of inveftigation^ and 
to find its depth ; but that none of them returned to give 
any information regarding it. The piper, fays the ftory, 
was heard at Loch-fad, (more than a mile diftant), playing 
a tune, purporting, that the candles went out, his compa- 
nions w€re loft, and himfelf never returned. This is not 
the only cave in Sky, concerning which fuch ftories are 
told • but with what degree of credit they flionld be recei- 
ved, every man may judge for himfelf. Among the num- 
ber of natural curiofities may juftly be reckoned the caf- 
cade above mentioned. The ftream from Loch-leithan 
which, m that part, is the boundary between the eaft fide 
ofSnuortand this parifh, running over a very high pre 
c.p.ce, as already obferved, and breaking, in white foam 
on the top of another rock below, forms a fall of water 
beautiful and magnificent in the extreme. Within the 
cafcade the rock is gradually hollowed, almoft from the top 
anto a wule fpace, where a great number of men might' 
wKh eafe, fit round a table, without being in the leaft in! 
cnmn.oded by the water falling without. To this place,

cularly on the fouth fide. 

Birds, and other Sea and Land Animals. — Here are np 
wild or domeftic animals which are not common to the 
neighbouring parifhes. The wild birds of all forts moft 
common in the country are, Solan geefe, gulls, cormorants, 
cranes, wild geefe, and wild duck j eagles, crows, ravens, 
rooks, cuckoos, rails, woodcocks, moor-fowl, partridges, 
plover, wild pigeons, and blackbirds, owls, hawks, fnipes, 
and a variety of fmall birds. In mild feafons, the cuckoo 
and rail appear in the latter end of April ; the former dif- 
appears always before the end of June ; the latter fome- 
times not till September. The woodcock comes firft ii^ 
Oftober, and frequently remains till March. The tame 
forts of fowl are geefe, ducks, turkies, cocks, pullets, and 
tame pigeons. Of quadrupeds, there are black cattle, hor- 
fes, fiieep, goats, dogs, cats, rats, and mice. The total 
number of black cattle, from one year old and upwards, is 
1954; of horfes, 362; of fheep, 1828; of goats, 156. 
There are likewife a few red deer ; and the fox ufually 
makes havoc among the flieep. There is np fox-hunter in 
this barony ; but there is a certain fum collefted yearly 
with the rents, for fox-money, which, at the year's epd, is 
diftributed among all that may be adlive to deftroy that 
hurtful animal, in proportion to the number they indivi- 
dually kill. Two fpecies of ferpents are to be found in the 
hills of this country, whofe bite, though not fatal, is very 
venomous, attended with much pain and great fwelling, and 
often confines the patient more thaji fix weeks to the houfe, 
which probably would not be the cafe, if medical affiftance 
were timeoufly called for. Some of* them are met with 
above 24 inches long. The one has yellow fpecks ; the 
pther black, whofe bite is the moll venomous, and, unlefs

properly managed at firft, is very dangerous. The head of 
the ferpent that inflifts the wound, mixed with certain 
herbs, and applied to the parts that are moft afFedted, is rec- 
koned good to carry off the poifon, and abate the fwelling. 
There have been inftances of cattle wounded by them in 
the tongue or lips that never recovered. Of amphibious 
animals, feals and otters are frequent here ; the value of 
whofe Ikins, as well as of the oil made of the fat of the feal, 
is well known. Whales and cairbans, or fun-fifli, come in 
fometimes to the Sounds after their prey, but are rarely pur- 
fued with any fuccefs. The fiflies commonly caught on 
the coaft are herrings, ling, cod, fcate, haddock, makerel, 
lythe, fye, and dog-fifli ; this laft is of little or no ufe for 
food, unlefs among the poorer fort of people, but its liver 
is of value on account of the excellent oil which is made 
of it. The average price of ling at home is L. 13, 13 s. 
per ton ; when fold, one by one, if frefti, the price is 
from 3 d. to 5 d. ; if cured, from 5 d. to 7 d. The barrel 
of herrings feldom fells under 19 s. which is owing to 
the great difficulty of procuring fait, even fometimes at 
any price ; and the fame caufe very often hinders ma- 
ny from fifhing more than is fufficient for their own 
ufe. The obvious method of remedying this, and which 
would be attended with infinite advantage to the High- 
lands and iflands, is fo well known, and has been al- 
ready fo often fully and ably treated of by others, that 
to enlarge upon it here would be fuperfluous. Syes under 
one year old are called cuddies, and are caught in great 
quantities in the latter end of harveft, throughout the win- 
ter, ^nd beginning of fpring. There are two ways of fifli- 
ing the cuddie ; the ope js by means of a rod, from the 
top of which, fufpended by a line confiding of half a dozen 
hairs or threads in thicknefs, hangs a fmall hook, on which 
bait being artfully fixed, it is let down into the fca ; ni 
that maimer an expert fiftier catches feveral hundreds in an 

eveuing,

th. f; u '"^ "'"^ expeditious way ofcatchin. 
the ../^,,, ,he„ ,t is in greater plenty on the coaft, is with 
a fort of cree , called jahK The jabh commonly confifts 
of three pr four ftrong rods, from 8 to lo feet long, laid 
acrofs each other m the middle, and gently bent uptards, 
t.ll they are fixed at the ends to a large hoop, from four 
to fix feet diameter, which forms its mouth : On the infide 
It is^all hned with a narrow net, made for the purpofe to 
• • retam the fifh and to let out the water, tightly tied to 
Its ribs and mouth ; and it has a long handle reaching its 
bottom, where the rods crofs one another, and to which, and 
^to the mouth, it is well faftened with a ftrong cord. This 
mftrument the fifher, ftanding on a rock, preffes down fide- 
ways into the fea, till the lower part of it reaches the bot- 
tom, the mouth being nearly right above ; then himfelf, or 
an affiftant, throwing out the bait in fmall bits over it, he 
holds it firm in that pofition till it be all cov^ed with \ud. 
dies, attrafted by the bait, when he raifes it up gently, and 
often brings in many hundreds at a time. The fummer is 
the baft feafon for the larger fye, and the moft common 
method for fiftiing it then is this : A little before funfet 
feveral perfons go out in a boat ; two, three, or four of 
whom fit in its ftern, each having a filhing-rod or two, fur- 
nifiied with fine white or gray lines, and flies made of white 
feathers, or hair on their hooks, which they hold out as far 
as they can after the boat, while two more are rowing it 
forwards ; in this manner, till it becomes dart, they con- 
tinue going backwards and forwards among the fifti, which 
always purfuing the fly, and endeavouring to fwallow it, 
fix on the hooks in fuch quick fuccefilon, as keep the fifiiers 
often conftantly bufy in taking them in. . Every farm on 
the coaft, of which there are 34 in this parifh. has a boat 
or two, and fometimes the far greater number of thefe are 
out in fearch the of fyi in the fame evening. 

Population^ 



of Portree. 



Population^ ISc. — About 15 years ago, when the mini- 
fter perfonally took the laft lift of them, the number of 
examinable perfons in this parifh were 1248, of which 930 
were in Portree, and 318 in Raal'ay, Since that time the 
increafe has been conliderable : After the exadleft inqui- 
ry, the whole number of fouls appears to be 1980. There 
being no parilh regifter, the births and deaths cannot be 
well afcertained ; and as to marriages, they may be reckoned 
at an average 10 every year. Of perfons above 90 years 'old, 
. there are 2; between 70 and 90, 22. The number of wea- 
vers in the parilh is four ; of weaverefles, 12. There are 
2 blackfmiths, 5 carpenters, 8 tailors, and 3 fhoe or brog- 
makers ; but the generality of the people make their own 
brogs. There may be reckoned fix petty merchants, be- 
fides the innkeeper of Portree, with whom it has been al- 
ways cuftomary to keep a large alTortment of hardwares 
grocery goods, and fundry other things neceflary for the 
ufe of the country., 

Although in thecourfe of the feven laft years, feveral yef- 
fels went from Sky to America with emigrants, very few 
left this parifti. The fubdivifion of lands, (a method gene- 
rally prevailing), at the fame time that it makes the people 
poorer, on account of their little progrefs in agricultural 
.improvements, evidently helps t(X increafe the popuh- 
^tlon ; and the prefervation of many lives is owing to' the 
praftice of inoculating that now univerfally prevails. 

^gricuhure.—Voxtite, "like the far grcatea part of this 
.ifland, is much lefs adapted by nature for agricultm-e than for 
pafture, and feldom, unlefs in very good years, fupplics it- 
felf wuh a fufficiency of provifions. Yet, though the foil is 
not very fertile or rich, it might with p^opei' management 
be made to produce more plentiful crops. But the general 
run of farmers are fo prejudiced in favour qf o^d cuOoms, 

and 



Statijlical Account 



and indeed not much inclined to induftry, that they will 
not eafily be prevailed on to change tliem for the better  
efpecially if the alteration or amendment propofed be at- 
tended with expence. Therefore, with refpeft to improve- 
ments in agriculture, they are llill much in the fame ftate as 
they were 20 or 30 years ago. Ploughs, on a new and' 
improved model, that in comparifon to the advantages 
derived from them, might be had at a moderate exr 
pence, have lately been introduced into feveral diftridls 
around, where their good efFeas are manifeft, in impro- 
ving the crops and diminifliing the labour of man and 
bead ; but the Laird of Raafay only, and one other gentle- 
man in this parifli, have yet ufed them. The cafcroim, a 
crooked kind of fpade, which being already well known, 
requires no defcription here, is almoft the only inftrument 
for labouring the ground ufed among the ordinary clafe of 
tenants. Where the foil is very wet, or the ground rug- 
ged and fteep, no agricultural tool can be ufed with greater 
propriety and advantage than the cafcroim\ but, notwith- 
ftanding, it employs, for the greatelt part of the fpring, at 
lead: 2-5ths more labourers than wowld be neceffary, if 
ploughs were ufed where the nature of the ground would 
admit. Let it be hoped then, that this tirefome inftrument 
of vaft unneceflary toil and labour, will be foon laid afide, 
except in thofe places where the plough can be of no fervice. 
Many hands would thereby be gained for improvements, 
and other ufeful employments, to promote the public wel- 
fare, and the ftate of agriculture would be greatly melio- 
rated. The moft effedlual way for obtaining this defirablc 
end, it is fuppofed, would be to diftribute the farms capable ' 
of being ploughed, into more equal and larger portionis than 
at prefent •, for by thi^ means, the mode now in praclice of 
dividing lands into fmall lots, in different proportions, 
vvould be ftopt ; and every farmer, having alwajrs the fame 
field to manage, would naturally be more careful and 
~ induftrious

induftrious to cultivate it to the beft advantage. In few or 
no places is the tillage continued above three years in one 
and the fame place ; and to produce a tolerable good crop 
the ground muft be manured fome one of thefe years ; which 
is done the firft, fecond, or third, according to the nature 
of the foil ; before it is again tilled it lies fallow 3 or 4 
years, and fometimes longer. The principal manure ufed 
is the dung of houfed cattle, mixed with ilraw, and fome- 
times with mud ; and fea-weeds, caft in great quantities in 
fome places, in the winter and fpring, on the ftiore, and 
which,, of a certain kind called leatbagan, or tangle, that is 
very rarely manufa£tured into kelp, the people themfelves 
cut during the fpring tides, and carry to land in their boats. 
The former is preferved in large heaps till the time of lay- 
ing it on the ground arrives, and is chiefly ufed for oats 
the latter for barley and potatoes. Sowing time ufually 
commences about the 20th of March, and harveft feldom 
before the middle of September. Except a little barley, 
fmall oats may be faid to be the only crop produced, and 
potatoes the only ferviceable root. Of this laft, there are 
vaft quantities grown annually, which, with herring and 
other fifli, are the chief food of the bulk of the inhabitants 
for more than half the year. 

Prices, TV ages, 'iJc — Here, and in every other part of 
the country, the prices of provifions were far lower about 
30 and 40 years ago than at prefent. The old people fay, 
that in their time the boll of meal fold for 6 merks Scots ; 
the double ftone of butter and cheefe, tron weight, for 6 s. 
6d. and other necelTaries in proportion. But thefe mat- 
ters have fmce undergone a vaft change ; every article has 
been increafing in value, and the difference of prices is now 
fenfibly felt. Except in the parifh of Kilmuir, and the 
neareft part to it of Snizort, little or no meal, the produce

of the coun try, is at prefent any where fold ; and there the 

" ZTSTV"'^""^" ^^-^^'-P^^^- Some fell their 
butter and cheefe at 17 s. the double flone. and none under 

14 s. Cattle that formerly fetched only from L. i, 10 s. to 
L._2, 10 s^ have fince fold for from L. 3 to L. 4, xos. the 
price of Iheep and weathers now varies from 4 s. to 6 s. and 
of horfes from L. 2, 10 s. to 6 guineas. This difference of 
prices may be accounted for from the increafe of popula- 
tion, and mtroduftion of paper currency into the country; 
the latter of which, occafioning the circulation of money in 
greater plenty, helped to diminifh its value. 

Some fervants Hioes juft now coft their maflers nearly as 
much as their wages 20 or 30 years ago amounted to. The 
common wagps for men-fervants is from L. 2, 10 s. to L. 3, 
10 s. and of overfeers fi-om L. 3 to 5 guineas, befides their 
fhoes and maintenance, and fometimes the grafs of a cow, 
and tillage of a little lands ; when they have grafs, or any 
tillage, their other wages is ' fomething lefs. A woman-' 
fervant gets from 12s. to aos. with fhoes; houfekecpers 
more ; but this flatement regards only the gentlemen 
tackfmen, 6f whom there are but five in the parifh. The 
other tenants generally get theirs at an eafier rate, the rea- 
fon of which is, perhaps, that they eat at the fame table 
with themfelves, and feldora work but when their maflers 
partake of the labour. The increafe in fervants wages is 
in a great meafure owing to many of the young people, 
particularly the men, going out the beginning of every 
year to the low countries for work, from which they do 
not begin to return till the latter end of Oflober ; alfo, 
fince the manufacturing of kelp became an objeft of im- 
portancc, great numbers prefer it, though troublcfome, to 
any other work, becaufe in it they can earn from i s. 6 d. 
to 3 s, per week, according to their labour. In other in- 
flances labourers are feldom hired for the week or daj^ %

iome farmers, indeed, have cottars, the half of whofe 
weekly work they have, and fometimes more or lefs, for a 
little grafs, and what ground they can labour the reft of 
their time. The quantity of kelp made annually in the 
parilh is little more than 35 tons ; for the three laft years 
the value of kelp was very low, few getting L. 4, 10 s. and 
many not above L. 3 ; this year, however, it promifes much 
better. 

Church, Poor, School, i^c. — The Proteftant religion, ac- 
cording to the eftabliftied form of the Church of Scotland, 
is the only religion profefled. There are four places of 
worfliip, but only one church, which was built a few years 
after the ereftion of the parifli in the year 1726; it is 
Hated, but rather fmall, and indifferently finillied within. 
The heritors are two, Lord Macdonald, and Mr Macleod of 
Raafay, the latter of whom generally refides in the parifli. 
The ftipend is not quite I coo merks Scots, and the glebe 
may be worth L. 6 a-year- There is no manfe. The 
Crown is patron. Mr Hugh Macdonald, the prefent in- 
cumbent's predeceflor, was firft miniller of the parifli. Mr 
John Nicolfon, the prefent minifter, is a bachelor, in the 
88th 3'ear of his age, and 39th of his miniftry ; a man of 
immitive manners and exemplary life ; lincere, benevolent, 
and charitable, of untainted rectitude and uprightnefs, and 
of fuch indefatigable perfeverance in the difcharge of his 
paftoral office, that being appointed to preach in Kirktown 
in Raafay once every month, and once a quarter in another 
part of that ifland, of no eafy accefs, he has not been abfent 
above four times on the ordinary days, during the whole 
courfe of his miniftry, till the beginning of fpring laft, 
when he got a fall that diflocated his flioulder, and conflned 
him to the houfe during the reft of the feafon. Till that

arithmetic, writing, and reading. Not long afterwards, 
the late Sir James Macdonald, who died at Rome in 1 766, 
much efteemed and lamented, obferving the central litua- 
tion of Portree, fixed on it for the feat of the fchool, and 
ordered a large and commodious fchool houfe to be built. 
But of the L. 25 granted by the Committee, iive were 
withdrawn feveral years ago, to make up a falary for a 
miffionary appointed on the eaft fide of Kilmuir ; which 
miflion the funds of the Committee were not able to con- 
tinue long, and therefore there now is none, but needed. 
To the fchool of Portree numbers come from ail parts of 
the country. It is generally very full every winter and 
fpring; and the number of fcholars in fummer is feldom 
lefs than 30. It has often, from time to time, fent many 
itudents to the Univerfity, who afterwards, in different ca- 
pacities ferved, and ftill ferve their country, with honour 
and credit. At prefent, there are three young men ready 
for College. 

Mvantaga, W,._Were it turned to the ufe that nature 
itfelf points out, Portree enjoys one great advantage, which 
few or no places can boaft of, and that is its noble and ex. 
cellent port, called from its excellence Oe„ Acer/aid, or the 
Harbour An inlet of the fea, acrofs whofe mouth lies 
Raaray, fpread,„g.,relfinto an oblong, well n,eltered on

and beft ^mproveable lands in the parifh lie round abou 
he h rbour. Th.s far then Portree appears to be the moft 
eligible fituation for founding a village that can be devifed ; 
and farther in other requifites and conveniencies, it is no- 
thing behind. Situated in the verj centre of Sky, and it 
may be faid of all this part of the Highlands and Iflands, 
none of the lochs or bays on thefe coafts moft famous for the 
herring-filhing, are far from it, and many are very near. 
In the founds without are good banks for the ling and cod 
fifhing, and all the furrounding feas abound in various forts 
of other fifli. On. the beech, becaufe of its fteepnefs, and 
the groat abundancg'tof good ftone in the rocks above a 
breaft work or quay might be built at a comparatively 
fmall expence. On the other fule of the harbour are very 
promifing appearances .of coals ; and a little beyond, near 
Its mouth, aslikewife ^fn the ifland of Raafay, are inex- 
haulhble quarries of diiFerent forts of fine free-ftone *; and 
hard by, at Sconcer, is abundance of limeftone. Quite at 
hand are two fmall rivfers that nfever dry up, and feveral 
fountains of good and wholefome water ; fo that in all 
points of view Portree has every advantage and conveni- 
ency requifite for the building of a village ; and therefore 
there can be no doiibt; but were it once begun, and fuitable 
encouragements given, it would foon be in a very flourifli- 
ing condition. Indted, fuch is its inviting fituation that 
there are, at prefent, no iefs than 30 families about the 
place without lands; and who, for the moll part, have no

other means of fubfiftence but by fifliing, ferrying to Loch- 
Carron, CiQiorn Strath, and other places, going on errands 
and exprefles, and other occafional employments. There 
is a very good harbour in Ronay, but no veflels put in 
there, unlefs forced by the weather or other accidents. The 
conveniency of the fchool is a great advantage ; and it is 
alfo a confiderable advantage, that from Sconcer to Acer- 
faid, and thence down to Snizort, is the beft piece of made 
road in all Sky. Here, too, the latter end of every May 
and July, is held a well known fair, to which all Sky, ex- 
cept the diftrifts of Strath, Heat, fome from Uift and Har- 
rifli, bring their cattle. The fair commonly continuegr- 
from Wednefday till the following Saturday ; and while, 
during that time, the cattle of others, fome of them after a 
long driving through moors and bad roads, are Handing on 
the moor, thefe in the neighbourhood of Portree are eafily 
fent to grafs every night, and brought back again next 
morning, by which means they look much fuller and bet- 
ter. But with refpedl to the farms immediately near the 
market-place, this manifefl: advantage is perhaps often more 
than balanced by the damage which their grafs, and fome- 
times their corn fuffers. The numbers that, on thefe occa- 
fions, flock from all parts to Portree, are immenfe ; and 
though there is a large, commodious, and well kept inn at 
Acerfaid, many, even of the beft, are often put to their 
flnfts for lodgings. Five miles fouth from Acerfaid, at 
the meeting of the three principal lines of road in Sky, is 
the public houfe and poft-office of Sconcer, from which, by 
means of two runners, and the port from Invernefs to Dun- 
vegan, all the letters of Strati), Heat, TroterniOi, and 
Mingnifli are diftributed.

the Danifii, fome from the Gaelic, of which inftances have 
been already given ; and further, Aird-du, or Black Pro- 
montory, from du, black, and aird, a promontory ; Bail- 
mainrJJj, or Middle Town, from bail, a town, and mainifhy 
middling, or in the middle. Of thofe of Danifti origin, 
Maanijh, and Raafay \ the former from Nijlj or Nefs, which 
plainly from the fituation of thofe places whofe names have 
that termination, fignifies a point or cape ; the latter from 
Ai or Ay, an ifland. The firft parts of the names, the lig- 
nification of which is not now well underftood, are only par- 
ticles or adje£lives, expreflive of fome particular circura- 
ftance, property, or quality of the places. The inhabitants 
are as humanely and generoufly difpofed as any of their 
neighbours. The gentlemen tackfmen, or firft clafs of far- 
mers in Sky, do in general enjoy the benefits of a liberal 
and polite education, and thefe ineftimable advantages they 
are willing to bellow on their children. The common 
people are naturally endowed with a ftrength of mind and 
fprightlinefs of difpolition that greatly diftinguifli them from 
others of the fame rank and condition. Their inquifitive 
turn, and fondnefs for news, frequently induce them to ad- 
drels all they fee for information ; and their queftions, and 
flirewd remarks, are often very furprifing. This curiofity 
is no where more confpicuous than in Portree, and perhaps^ 
there are few places that afford more frequent opportunities 
of gratifying it. A fort of coarfe woollen cloth called cloa, 
or caddoes, the manufafture of their wives, made into fliort 
jackets and troufers, is the common drefs of the men. Th&amp; 
philibeg is rarely wore, except in fummer and on Sundays, 
on which days, and fome other occafions, thofe in better 
ciicumftances, appear in tartans, a bonnet, and flaort hofe.

and fome in a hat, fliort coat, waiflcoat, and breeches of 
Scotch or Englifh manufafhare. The women are in gene- 
ral very cleanly, and fo exceflively fond of drefs, that many 
maid-fervants are often known to lay out their whole wages 
that way. The men in general are middle fized ; there 
are at prefent in this parilh 5 men about 6 feet high, and 
none exceed that height. The height of the women is 
from 5 feet 2 inches to 5 feet 6\; they are in general 
handfome and well complexioned. Some fpirited young 
men are fond of the military profeffioii : but here, as like- 
wife in the other parts of the country, the generality feem 
to have loft that martial difpolition, which was lb charac- 
teriftic of their fathers. When any is enlifted for the fer- 
vice, his relations are, for fome time, inconfolabie ; and, 
in particular, the mothers, fitters, and wives, would rather 
have their refpeftive relatives to pafs the moft miferable 
and wretched life with themfelves at home, than fee them 
go into the army. If go they will, it would not give 
them near the concern were it along with their chief, his 
connexions or dependents, with whom they are acquainted ; 
and who, they are impreffed with the idea, have a greater 
right to them, and would be more careful and tender of 
them. However, the different recruiting parties through 
the country this year have been pretty fuccefeful. The 
men of Raafay are excellent fifhers and excellent fea- 
men-, to their infular fituation, perhaps, abounding 
in a variety of fifli, this dexterity may in a great mea- 
fure be attributed ; they are more expert in filhing, and 
appear to be fonder of a feafaring life than moft of their 
neighbours. During the fpring, and greateft part of fum- 
mer, numbers of them are employed in the ling and cod 
fifliing, and then many of them engage on board the her- 
ring bulTes, where they commonly remain till the fifhing 
feafon is over, when they return home with their earnines

the country, if a report was annually given in of the number of the fmall 
clafs of tenants, to whom 2 barrels of fait might be diftributed upon oath, 
for the purpofe of curing the relative quantity of herrpgs to be eat with

kind, but by far of much lefs magnitude. Along the fides^ 
and ftretched out from the bafe of thefe grand appearances, 
are extenfive trads of heath and mofs. Such parts of thefe 
traas as are in fome degree elevated, afford fafe pafturing 
ground for yell cattle. Such as are low, overgrown with 
foft and deep mofs, quagmires here and there interfperfed, 
prove often fatal to quadrupeds of every kind ; beneath all 
thefe mountains, trads. of heath and deep mofs, are narrow 
glens, vallies, and fmali plains, beautified with little natu- 
ral mounts, ridges, and hollows j ail thefe are wholly green, 
affording plentiful pafture, during fummer and harveft, for 
milk cows, fome goat, and flieep. By the clofe of harveft, 
or beginning of November, cattle are fent to winterings *, 
where they continue till the beginning of February or 
thereby, at which time they are taken thence, houfed, and 
fed; , the milk cows, in preference to all, are paftured 
through the day, if poffible, in the moors, or, if prevented by 
one or more bad days, are fupported fparingly within doors. 
As to the lower part of this parifh, called in Gaelic Fa- 
Un-AJJint, the furface is much the fame ; it has its hills, ISc.

But perfefUy diminutive when compared with thofe of the 
height of AiSint. The numerous inhabitants here on their 
fmall particular divifion of a town or farm, praftife much 
the fame method with thofe on the height in rearing 
eattle, which is the principal ftaple of the whole parifh, 
and the only one of the height of Affint. But the inha- 
bitants of Fan- Affint,. or Lower Affint, have the additional 
advantage of fifhing in- the furrounding offing, bays, feas, 
and ocean, when they pleafe, and when the weather will 
permit them. But of thefe bays, "iJc. in their proper place. 

The particular traft of the parifh called Me-in-Affintj, 
i. e. the middle of Affint, is a perfed wild, covered with, 
heath, mofs, heathery hills, and rocks of fmall lize, and 
freffi water lochs, which are numerous. This tradl con- 
lifts of the outlkirts of all' the farms on the whole coaft of 
the pariffi, and is ufed moftly in common, and as tenv- 
porary winterings, but not fafe. 

Situation. — This pariffi is fituated on the W. N. W, 
eoaft of Scotland,, within the county of Sutherland, the 
prelbytery of Dornoch, Synod of Sutherland and Caithnefs. 
The fynodlcal annual meeting is held alternately at Domoclj 
and Thurfo ; the latter a town in the county of Caithnels ; 
the former, the only Royal Burgh in that of Sutherland. 
The diftance betwixt Thurfo and Dornoch is 43 computed 
miles-, thence to Affint 30 miles like meafme, at leaft. 
Three rivers, and feveral confiderable rivulets, interfeft the, 
road betwixt Affint and Dornoch ; therefore, when the wea- 
ther turns out rainy, and continues for but 24 hours, or 
thereby, the very rivulets, and efpecially the rivers, are fo j 
many tremendous torrents, not to be forded, and when 
raffily attempted, the confequence feldoni fails to prove 
fatal ; along thefe 30 miles, there is not one bridge, nor 
%ut one or two fmall boats, of the ffiape or figure of falmoa 

coblesi,i

the preceding hazardous inconveniencies, is in a tolerable 
degree opened up, excepting five miles in Finevin, the 
property of the late adive and gaUant Sir John Rofs of 
Balnagown, whom the narrator has often heard fay, that 
he would foon drive his carriage to Kan- loch-elfh, which 
could be eafily efFefted, there being no bog nor mire in the 
traa of thefe few miles, only ftones of fuch bulk as might 
be taken up by any ordinary man. and removed to a di- 
ftance ; the bottom is gravel. Sir Charles Rofe, fon and 
fucceflbr to Sir John, would have only to fay, «' Let thefe 
" five miles be opened for a road;" and it would readily 
be done. 

Boundaries.— ABnti, fituated as above, and lying on the 
W. N. W. coaft of Scotland, is thus bounded ; on the N. 
it is divided from the parifli of Edrachililh, by a great arm 
of the fea, called Kilis *, of confiderable breadth, as it en- 
ters from the ocean, probably more than two, if not three 
leagues ; it indents, running betwixt both parilhes with 
little variation, in a direftion from W. to E.' If we rec- 
kon from the point, or land-end of Rowftore of Affint, 
which projefts into the ocean confiderably more than the 
oppofite northern coaft of Edrachili/h, the Kilis may be 
found in length f fix leagues at leaft, as it terminates at tlie

bafes of Edrachllilli and Affint, lofty mountains. At one 
league's diftance from the inland end of the Kilis, there is 
a particular part of it, called Kilis-cu-ig *, acrofs which a 
Hone may be flung ; there the natives fwim their hardy 
breed of cattle, from either fide to the other, as often as 
their bufinefs requires. Advancing eaftward a very fliort 
diftance from Kilis-cu-ig, the Kilis expands to a confide- 
rable extent, and at length terminates in two lochs, vh. 
Loch-glen du of Edrachilifh and Lockunapool of this parilh. 
The herring-buffes repair yearly to thefe, and the other 
lochs of the Kilis, and feldom have caufe to repent, as they 
faU in with fifli, are well iheltered on one or other fide of 
the Kilis, and have good anchoring ground. 

Lochunapool above mentioned, ends at Glen-culof Edra- 
chililh, the only farm in this quarter of the county belong- 
ing to the Honourable family of Reay, and in contacl with 
Affint. The boundary by land, through hills, moors, ls?c. 
is fomewhat differently reprefented. The polTeffors of Glen-

cattle graze in common only for about three months in 
the year, on thofe very high and bleak fummits. Quitting 
inarches with Edrachililh as above, this parifh, at the very

Be-a-kichand Gone-vaul-hill, the latter ftill belongs to this 
parilh ; the march is continued by a burn, which defcends 
from the pafs betwixt thefe two very high hills lafl 
mentioned; at the difl:ance of a mile from its fource, it 
forms a loch called Du-loch-more f, the ftream ifliiing 
from it at the diftance of about half a mile, falls along a 
precipice ; here the march forms a curve to Fowran-bal-

a great lake called Loch-me-addy ; from the fpring of 
Glaik-na-crev-ftieUich to this laft loch, the courfe of the 
march is from S. to N. From Loch-me-addy the march 
aflumes a direftion from E. to W. in this manner : A great 
body of water iffues from that loch ;y t forms a channel of 
no great length ; it is contrafted to the breadth of an ordi- 
nary river, and refigns at laft its great ftream to another 
equally large lake called Fane-loch ; betwixt thefe two 
great lochs there is in the channel above mentioned one ford, 
it is called U-y-farn * ; it is dangerous, being only incohe- 
rent ftone and fand heaped together, by ftro'ng winds which 
prevail here the go of harveft, more or lefs through winter, 
and efpecially beginning of fpring ; fome perfons, though but

At about the middle part there is a ftem or cruive, having 
two chefls, acrofs to catch falmon, and to prevent their get- 
ting up to a great pond below the fall, whence they cannot 
be taken by reafon of great ftones, roots of trees, and other 
obftacles carried yearly there in time of great fpeats ; no 
filh was ever known to have furmounted the Cafcade. This 
river at laft difembogues itfelf into the ocean, at a very fliort 
diftance fouth of Inverkirkag farm houfe. There, at cer- 
tain times of every tide during the iifhing-feafon, fifliers ply 
with a yoal, (a little boat), oars, and n^ts, to catch falmon. 
The quantity taken throughout the feafon is faid not to ex- 
ceed one and a half laft, though in a favourable year, the 
iifhing may turn out to a few barrels more ; however, the 
falmon, in regard of quality and relifli, are allowed not to 
yield to any in Great Britain, being fpawned in a river 
whofe many fprings are the pureft fources, and alfo being 
catched inftantly as they come from the ocean.

all along particularly pointed out, the narrator now pro- 
ceeds to defer ibe the coaft of this pariQi from the river of 
Kirk-ag to the point or land end of Row-ftere, from which 
place he began to fliow the circuitous march of it.

Gourfe from KIrk-ag river to the point of Row-ftore, runs 
from S. S. E. to N. N. W. All this coaft is of importance, 
as the fea abounds with every fpecies of fi(h, cod, ling, l£c. 
there are likewife a variety of Ihell fifli, ^1%. oyfter, lobfter, 
\£c. But the annual refort of herring to this and neigh- 
bouring coafts, S. and N. of the parifh, (now for feveral 
years pall), is what affords great advantage, both in refpeft 
of living and profit to thofe refiding there, far fuperior to 
all the refources which the inhabitants refiding on thfe 
heights of it can have. By the fide of Loch-Inver is the 
filhing fiation of Culag, built at the expence of L. 2000 
; Sterling, by John-Jofeph Bacon, Efq; of the Ifle of Man, 
and one Mr Donald Rofs partner, for a certain fiiare of that 
fum. Of late years the leafe and buildings have been all 
transferred to other adventurers. There is a fmall cruive 
on the little river of Culag, where perhaps a barrel of fal-

are of no great extent. They are not to be approached 
but when a fair and calm day oifers, by reafon of the bil-

the eaftern end of it lies fo near the mainland part of Old- 
ney farm, by reafon that the breadth of the channel divi- 
ding them will not exceed 20 yards ; this alfo is the channel 
formerly mentioned by the Gaelic name of Dorny-elan- 
aul-da ney, having a harbour on each fide of it. The 
'length of it will perhaps meafure an Englifli mile ; the 
breadth varies much in many places, and where broadeft, 
will probably not exceed a quarter of a mile. Its infular 
■fituation makes it valuable, as its pafture and little corn is 
fafe from being trefpaffed on by neighbouring cattle ;-be- 
fides that it anfwers in its turn, with other grazings, as 
part of the milch cow pafture throughout fummer. During

This ifland is a pendicle of Inver farm. It is rather flat, 
though not wholly fo. It partly abounds with heather, 
9n4 i'weet grafs. It is much longer than broad ; the former

The narrator having all along mentioned in fubjoined 
notes, or in the body of this Statiftical Account, the feveral 
farms which fell in his way, of a long and wearifome cir- 
cuit, it would btcome hira now to proceed to the imme- 
diate difcuflion of the more important particulars of this 
detail ; biit the mention of thefe are for a little deferred, 
until, with equal impartiality, the names at leaft of the in- 
termediate farms are fimply recorded. The defign of 
which is, That in the event any thing ufeful, meriting en- 
quiry or infpeftion, mayoccur in what remains to be addu- 
ced, any perfon, from whatever quarter, may know where 
to find and fee fuch objects, without guide or reward to 
any. Therefore the names of all the farms and inhabited 
places, not formerly mentioned, will foon follovv in courfe. 
But to give as clear an idea as poffihle of the different trafts 
and direftions in which thefe places are fituated and found, 
the narrator will fuppofe, that a traveller fets off from In- 
ver-kirk-ag lliore for Ledbeg on the height of this parifli ; 
in this event he will either keep by the fouth fide of Su-il- 
vine, or Suggar-loaf-hiU, and find the path difagrecable, 
abounding with ftones, in fome parts with rocks ; and in 

cafe.

The ancient Divifion of the Lands of the whole Parijh.— 
The ancient divifien of the parifti, to -this day retained and 
known by all here, was into davochs of land, which are 
four : ijl, The davoch of Ard-Affint, including the whole 
traft and farms thereon, from Skiak river all along to the 
jnarch of Lcdmore, at Auld-an-nakal gach, iSc. to Knock- 
an, as particularly mentioned in the preceding pages. This 
davoch was the only one which fufTered confiderably by 
feudal differences and powerful jurifdiftion, now happily 
■abrogated fince 1748. 

•id davoch, Ed ra-ifk, extends from Inver-kirk-ag river 
to that of Inver ; its hill pafture lies towards Su-il-vine and 
Canifp mountains. 

davoch, Row-ftore, lies extended along fliore from 
Inver river to Garve-auld of Clafhnefly. The pafture for 
yell-cattle is the out-fkirts of all the farms, and called Me- 
an- Affint, formerly defcribed.

auld of Claftmefly, along the coaft of Kilis, to the march 
of Unapool (as formerly reprefented) with Glencul of 
Edra-chililh pariih. The hiU-pafture of this davoch is in part 
a divifion of Me-an-Aflint, to the boundary of Glenlerag 
farm by Loch-iiedd. Glenlerag, Ardvare, Ry-an-traid, 
and Unapool, have out Ikirts, each of their own. For rea- 
fons which will appear in the fequel, the fubdivifions of thefe 
four davochs muft not be omitted, for they are ftill retained 
and known by the natives and by attending to it in its 
proper place, a pretty exud calculation can be made of all 
.the live flock of every fpecies of cattle in the parifli.

labourer employs a conliderable part of that time in ga- 
thering earth, which he forms into an oval or quadrangular 
figure i above that are l^id ftrata of dung, lime, and 
whatever elfe may enrich his dunghills, to which a conli- 
derable addition is made by the litter of cattle, hpufed 
early in the fpring. If that feafon be favourc^ble, the til- 
lage commences at or about the middle of Febru- 
ary. Oats are fown in March and beginning of April,

Fields to tie laid down with heaf-^ and fuch as are to be 
planted with potatoes *, after havifig been once ploughed, 
are thereafter manured, and upon their being tilled a fecond 
time, ate inftantlj fown, and harrowed. Sea weed is 
the principal manure, all along the Ihore. Some little 
trails of moor and barren ground are yearly evety where 
brought into cultivation by potatoe-planting ; but the whole 
arable ground, ploughed and delved throughout the whole 
parilh, does not probably* bear the proportion of one acre 
to an hundred, of what is hill pailure, moor and mofs. 
The old Scotch plough is the only one ufed here ; four 
hardy native horfes are yoked to it. The other imple- 
ments of hufbandry are harrows, the crooked and ftraight 
delving fpades, Englifti fpades, fome mattocks, cabbies, 
crook-faddles, and creels. It is with thefe two laft men- 
tioned that the manure is carried on horfeback to the field, 
as neither cart nor waggon are yet ufed here. 

W Time and HarveJl.—^ttA time, as above mentioned, 
if the fpring proves favourable, begins early in March, 
and in that event, the labouring is finifhed by the clofe of 
Way, or fome days thereafter. If the hafveft be a good 
one, the crop will be feciired by the lattef end of Septem- 
ber'; but this happens very feldom, by reafon of excefllve 
rains, which, if they come on in March, lengthen the la- 
bouring to the 24th of June, and of courfe very probably 
the ingathering of the crop is protradled to the end of Oc-

theie rams continue, and change to fleet and iroft,. which 
lomet.mes happens, the whole labour of the year is erther 
lolt, or, the crop is rendered unwholefome for man and 
beaft; ofconfequence ficknefs prevails among the people, 
and the lofs of cattle is inevitable. 

Climate, Lifeafes, In general, the climate is rainy, 

as much fo at leaft as in any traft of equal extent on the 
W. N. W. coaft of North Britain. The rain continues hot- 
only for hours, but often for day^ ; nay, for weeks, efpeciallj 
ifthe wmdperfeveres for fo long a time to blow from the 
weft; if irom that quarter it veers to the fouth, its conti- 
nuance there will not be long, but returning, recommences 
Its unwelcome ftiowers. When the wind fliifts from W. 
to N. in this event it rains gently for two or three days; 
thereafter the atmofphere clearing upj the weather becomes 
dry and chilly, and continues fo as long as the north 
wind prevails. With eafterly winds there is always dry 
fertne weather here, having little or no change to the con- 
trary. During the fouth wind the weather is favourable 
but no fooner does it veer to the weft, and continues to 
blow hard, than in a few hours it begins to rain. Notwith- 
ftanding-, 

* Harveft 1771 was^avourable, the crop was good, and fafely got in. 
A very great fall of" fnow took place in the beginning of January 177Z, 
which continued with intervals until near the end of March; intenfe froft 
fucceeded in April ; fo that, notwithftanding almoft the whole crop, and- 
all the provender had been given to the cattle, yet more than one third ot 
the live ftock of this pariih died. Harveft 178^ was very bad ; very little 
of the crop was- fecured. It was moftly loft, b''ing covered with fnow. 
Spring 1783 was more favourable than that of 1771, confequently lefslofs 
of cattle. At this very time, -xh: September 24. 1793, the barley is not 
cut down, therefore a very late harveft is dreaded,

Itanding that fuch in general is the climate here, yet there 
is a coniiderable difference betwixt tiie heavineC; of Ihowers 
and other yearly Itorms falling on the heights, in compwri- 
fon of thofe which fall on the lower parts of the panih, 
called Fa un Affint ; in the laft neither iliowers of rain, nor 
ftorrns of fnow are fo violent; whereas on the heights they 
are often felt feverely : In IHort, fome winter ft-afons pafs 
Hear thefliore, with little or no fnow, but only imenfe froft^ 
while at the fame time, the fartheft inland end of Slifli- 
a-ehililli, and the whole heights of this parifli, groan under 
a load of both. But though the climate be thus rainy, 
and the air moift during deluges fuch as have been defcri- 
bed, yet upon ceafing of the rain, a..fmart eafterly wind 
ariling, and continuing for the fpace of 34 hours, will per- 
feaiy abate the waters, carry off all fuperfluous rain from 
the furface, and moifture from the air. That the weather 
here is very changeable cannot be denied ; fometimes very 
ferenc and pleafant, but oftener the reverfe, which is 
the.ftate of all places in fbch northern latitudes, abound- 
ing with lofty hills, as this pariOi does. However, that the 
air here is healthful will eafily be admitted, as it is a faft 
well known, that people from South Britain, and from the 
Ifle of Man, have lived comfortably here ; and, .t this 
very time, natives of the Eaft and Weft Indies refide in 
this pari/h, enjoying perfeft health, acquiring a habit and 
conftitution of body almoft equally robuft as that of the 



natives.

Injlances of Longevity. —Mrs Chriftian Gray, daughter 
of the Reverend Mr Alexander Gray, (the late learned and 
worthy Epiicopal parfon here), died at the age of ,00 
years at leaft. The narrator faw and often converfed with 
her for one or two years after his admiffion in the 1765. 
She retained the memory of every thing of importance 
that came within her knowledge to the very clofe of life. 

Hugh Matthifon, tenant in Baddy-danoeh by Loch-Inver, 
was, by his own account, 95 years of age. He enjoyed 
good health, and went a fiftiing in his little boat until within 
fame few days of his death. 

John Mackenxie, tenant in Claflimore, fays, that he 
is at the clofe of 100 years at leaft. He can ftlU threlh 
corn, and do other domeftic affairs. 

Mrs Mackenzie of Glenlerag, who died much about 
1767, faw the fourth generation lineally defcended from 
heri She was upwards of 100 years, and retained her me- 
inory, i^c. to her death. 

State of Property : Whether chwigeable or not. The 

property of this parifh has perhaps undergone as few chan- 
ges as any. Tradition, and even documents declare *, 

that,

of this parifli ; and if the narrator remembers well. Sir Robert Gordon of 
Gord'onftoun hints at this fadt, in his hiftory of that ancient family.

that it was a foreft of the ancient Thanes of Sutherland. 
One of thefe prime Thanes gave- it in vaflalage to one 
Mac-Kry-cul, who, in ancient times, held the coaft of 
Coigach, that part of it at the place prefently (1793) 
called the village of Ullapool*. The Noble Thane 
made AlTmt over in the above manner, as Mac-Kry-cul 
had recovered a great quantity of cattle, carried ofE 
from the county of Sutherland by foreign invaders f. 
Mac-Kry-cul's family, by the fate of war in thofe days 
of old, being reduced to one heir-female, Ihe was gi- 
ven in marriage to a younger fon of Macleod. laird of 
Lewis, the Thane of Sutherland confenting thereto ; and 
alfo making this parilh over to the new married couple, 
together with its fuperiority, The refult of this marriage 
was fourteen fucceffive lairds here of the name of Macleod J. 
In i66o, or about that tiipe, this parifli and its fuperiority 
became the property of the Earl of Seaforth, who made it 
over to a younger fon of his family, whofe fucceflbrs poffef- 
fed It for three or four generations : Thereafter it was pur 
chafed by Lady Strathnaver, who gave it as a prefent ta 
her Noble and no lefs deferving grandfon, the late Wil- 
liam Earl of Sutherland, father of the prefent Right Ho-

* Mac-Kry-cul is reported by the people here to be the potent qian, 
of whom are defcended the Macnicols, Nicols, and Nicolfons. 

f This Noble family, in refpedl of antiquity, is equal to any. Some 
are of opinion, that a prince or chieftain of the German Celt! (whom the 
Roman hiftorian mentions, Tac. ger. 30. i.) was progenitor of it Be 
that as it will, it is fad. that rhe county of Sutherland, in the Gaelic Ian- 
jTiage is called Shir-ri-acht-chatt ; the natives, by the fame language, ar« 
'denominated Chattirk ; and the Earl called Mor-ir chatt. Further, 
there is early mention of the Thanes of Sutherland in Bucha- 
nan's hiftory of Sc-otland; for proof of .this the hiftory of the nlurper 
Macbeth may be read, who, to poflefs the frown, aflaflinafed his Oivn 
-coufin. King Duncan I. and put to death foon thereaftt-r tlie Thinesof 
Caithnefs, Surhei'land, Rofs, and Nai-rn, &amp;c. in the year 1043. Hovwever, 
the furvivors of thefe Thanes, corjjoining with the other great chieftains 
of Scotland, expelled the ufurper, and placed Malcolm III. on the throne

tbfe ^th book of fame hiftorian, that in the year 1370, or thereby. 
King David II. preferred Alexander, fon to the Earl of Sutherland, by 
faid David's fecond fifter, to fuccced him as King of Scotland; th? nobi- 
lity accordingly fwcre fealty to him; but Alexander dyin^ foon after, 
the King was rtrconciled to Robert Stewart, the fon of his eldeft fifter. 
In fhort, this Noble family always concuirrd in promoting and efTeiflijig 
the general good and happinefs of the ftate or kingdom. As evidence oi" 
tills, read Dr Smollet's hiftory of 171 5, vol. 10. where the patriotic con- 
dua of John Earl of Sutherland, in the Houfe of Peers, againft the EarJ 
of Anglefy, &amp;c. will appear confpicuous. 



fhe narrator came here, the crop was loft, alfo the peats al- 
moft. In fpring 1772, in confequence of the preceding 
indifFerent harveft, one-fourth part of the cattle perillied. 
In particular, the cafe was, That a great ftorm of fnow 
came on in the beginning of January it continued off and 
on till the beginning of April, when it was carried away 
fuddenly by a great and ixncommon deluge of rain. Froft 
continued throughout April : In a word, though all the 
provender, and even the corn was given, the cattle perifti- 
cd. The 1782 was bad ; but nothing fo dlftrefling as the 
laft mentioned. This fame 1793 has been diftreffing through- 
out the whole of it ; the crop is for the moft part damaged, 
pid the beft of it hurt. In fliort, by obfervation, the narra! 
tor can trirly fay, that every 9th or 10th year turns out di- 
ftrefling, either by lols of crop, lols of cattle, perhaps both, if 
the fpring proves not favourable ; and in the fame proportion 
of years prefently mentioned, there is generally a failure of 
credit by drovers in more or lefs degree ; for, as they drive 
all the cattle fold here, and other neighbouring northern 
parifties, to the fouthern markets, they muft neceflarily feel 
the effefts of bad feafons and times ; and fuch is the cafe 
here at prefent. The intermediate years betwixt every 
9th -or loth year, are, upon the whole, not to be com- 
plained of. 

Crop of the -whole Parijh, &amp;c. and Number o/SouIs.^The 
crop of the whole parifti confifts of oats, the fmall black 
kmd, of barley and potatoes. When good years occur the 
produce of all thefe, on the heights of the parifh, may fuffice 
for fix or feven months at moft. For the lower parts, and 
along the whole coaft, it will probably ferve for ten 
months ; and in cafe of a good herring-fiftxing, and plenty 
of them fecured for family confumption, the year may paG 
tolerably wdUn this quarter. But in bad years, no lels

than 1500 bolls at leaft, (and that ufed with the greateft 
ceconomj, as an addition to what may remain of the pro- 
duce here), willferve the whole pariHi, which the narrator 
believes to contain 3000 fouls. The people refiding on 
the height, though by far the fewer, will confume more 
viftual, in proportion to their number, than thofe of the 
low coaft will ufe ; and this by reafon of the more or lefs 
fupply of filli from the fea contiguous to them, which the 
inhabitants of the height can have no advantage by. 

Price ofViBual and Provifions — The price of viclual 
has of late years rifen very much. About twenty years 
ago, the writer of this account has known the boll of 
viaual fold for 8 s. Sterling ; a live wedder at 5 s.; the 
ftone of butter, equal to 24 lb, Englilh weight, fold at 6 s. 
Cheefe per ftone, at 2 g. 6d. fometimes at 3 s. ; a good fat 
Highland cow at L. i, 15 s. or thereby ; but now the cafe is 
very much reverfed. The vidtual now-a-days draws here, 
communihus annis, L. i Sterling at leaft per boll, if import- 
ed, expence, \ic. included. If carried from the county of 
Sutherland, or that of Rof*, in this cafe, fervants, horfes 
and hamefs, with tear and wear, muft be prepared, and will 
be either five or fix days betwixt going and returning. At 
this very day fhepherds draw from 13 s. to ij s. for a good 
■wedder. The butter fetches 10 s. per ilone ; cheefe per 
Hone 4 s. and fometimes 5 s. The price of black cattle is 
very changeable here, as already hinted at in the preceding 
page, and the reafon for it is the inftability of droving. 
Further, it may be eafily obferved and admitted, that the 
multiplicity of licenfed ftills in the low corn-counties, tend 
greatly to the rather too great increafing price of viftual. 



Wages, &amp;c. and Price of Labour. — Wages to domefti^ 
feyvants is not high here j one with the other included will 

not 



ofAJinU 



not exceed L. i Sterling annum. The great concern of the 
farmer, or any other head of a family here, is to provide 
provifions, cloathing, bedding, %^c. for his herds, milk- 
maids, ISc. The dearnefs of thefe feveral articles, together 
with the expence and trouble of carriage, mentioned above, 
is the reafon why the fees of dcmeftic fervants cannot be 
fo high in this as in corn-parifhes. Of old times, and at 
this very day, there is a proverb ufed in the Highlands, 
which, when tranflated, expreffes literally, That it is 
for decent food and accommodation, and not for wages, 
they (domeftic fervants) ferve. Labour by the day is ac- 
counted high, being 8 d. lo d. ISc. \ and therewith they 
are fed thrice a-day. The reafon why day labourers are 
fo high in their demand, is, that all thofe not ferving in fa- 
milies always refort to the numerous fifhing-veffels on the 
coaft, where men well fkilled in packing, may gain at 
lead 2s. per day; ftrong old women, and induftrious laffes, 
I s. 6 d. per day, by gutting the herrings. 

Caves and Pigeons. — There is a very large one in Lofty- 
fu-il-vine, another at Knockan ; alfo a very fpacious one at 
Cul-kin-ach-na-karnan, Go-an-dun-an *, otherwife called, 
Go-na-kal-man. This cave is no great diftance from the 
point or land-end of Row-llore. Befides thefe there are ma- 
ny more ; to fuch, and to the clefts of rocks, the pigeons 
refort to hatch and for flielter. There are no other dove- 
cotes here. 

Woods* 

• Go-an-dun-an, called fo by reafon of its being near the remains of a 
dune, built by Scandinavians, when upon their beinjr defeat near Dor- 
noch, and in the adjacent parts of the county of Rofs. To that place they

Woods. — There are fome birch-trees thinly fcattered: 
here and there by the coaft of Slifli-a-chi-lilh, all along 
from Unapool to Oldney, both places included. There is 
alfo of the fame kind in many different thin plots, far 
diftant from one another, from Oldney :to Inver-kirk- 
ag; but this laft mentioned trad lies, at the diftance of 
at leali two long miles from, the coaft. From Poul-a-gar- 
vir, on the fouth. fide cf Inver river, thence along in an 
eaft diredtion by Lower and Upper Tubegges winterings, 
there are woods of the fame kind. In like manner, there 
is from Little Afiint, towards Tumore, the north fide of 
Loch Afiint. The whole woods, though of no great value, 
are of confiderable importance to the parifli, as, in time of 
great ftorms and falls of fiiow, every fpecies of cattle re- 
fort to them for flielter ; nay, they browfe on the copfe ; 
however, there are in many places fome flender trees, 
which, if prfiferved, as now by the prefent faftor, will cer- 
tainly anfwer the end which the late good Earl had in 
view ; which was, that thefe woods fliould repair and build 
the houfes of all his Lordfliip's tenants, alfo the ofiice-houfes 
of wadfetters and feuers, in the event they thought proper 
to build here for themfelves *. 

Gardens^ is'c. — There are fmall gardens, which afford 
cabbages, is'c. hut. there are no orchards. 

Ke/p, Is'c. — There is no kelp made here. The littre 
fea-ware that is, grows within the harbours formerly men-

The formers houfes along the whole coafl being built 
cither oppofite or adjacent to the harbours, for that very 
reafon the iate Noble Earl thought it of greater general 
good, that the feveral farms fliould have the fea-ware to 
improve the uncultivated heathy furface, and thereby add 
to the comfortable fubfiftence of his tenants, rather than any 
trifling pittance whatever that might be offered to his 
LordOiip's faftors ♦ ; and the fame plan the prefent Noble 
proprietors have adopted. 

FiJJjerles, i^c.— Herring-fiftiing has been formerly diC- 
cuffed. But it is a faft, that feveral years paft a very de- 
cent, devout, and beneficent man, one Mr Richard Keld, 
(he was one of a fifliing companyjat Whitby), came to this 
Goaft, having two fl'oops, purpofely to make trial of cod 
and ling fifliing. His principal ftation he fixed at Cul- 
kin-drumbaig ; yet, though rather late in his fetting out 
from Whitby, he fucceeded well. He meant to have takea 
a feu of fome acres there, with intention to build a fifliing 
ftation. For that purpofe his intention was communicated 
by the narrator to Colonel James Sutherland, of Uppall, 
then faftor ; but the fliips belonging to his company ha- 
ving been taken up in government-fervice as viduallera 
at the commencement of our differences with our Ameri- 
can colonies, Mr Keld's defign did not take place. Mr 
JCeld, after having returned to England, exchanged one or 
two letters with the narrator, wherein he fays, that though 
by reafon of his late fetting out for the fifliing ground, h; 
was fliort of his complement, yet that the quality of his

inns, except honeft tenant's houfes, at certain diftances here 
and there, on the feveral tracks or roads not cleared up, 
where the weary traveller may now get a good, clean 
Highland woollen plaid, and a comfortable paUet or couch 
to fleep on. There are no briciges betwixt Affint and 
Dornoch, nor one betwixt Affint and Tain, excepting that 
called the bridge of Grug-ag, near Kincardine, Rofsfliire. 
If there were bridges, the road is well opened to Brae of

length; no houfes ; none of accommodation ; that whole

that come to our coaft and fafe harbours, do well for them- 
-felves and owners. Lieutenants Mackenzie of Ledbeg, 
and Scobie of Crom-auld, hire a floop from Lei th yearly, 
(and that but of late), to carry away their falmon, and

Jncient State of Population.— T)ras parifli having been a 
forell ; having undergone as few changes as any whatever 
of its extent ; it is eafy to fuppofe, that though mankind 
were at firft but few, they would gradually increafe ; be- 
fides, civilization being introduced by the fucceffive pro- 
prietors. Alfo, that by far the greater number of inha- 
bitants were fituated on the coaft, and having harbours, 
therefore the common flcill, knowledge, and induftry of 
the natives, together with their bed exertions engaged to 
reduce a rugged foil ; to fuch endeavours, the health, the 
fupport, and equal increafe of the inhabitants are owing. 
The narrator is perfeftly perfuaded in his own mind, that 
the natives are a third more numerous than when he firft 
came in 1766 •, which increafe, imder the bleffing of God, 
the narrator afcribes to the caufes prefently mentioned, as 
alfo to the benignity of the fucceffive landlords or fuperiors. 
The prefent number of inhabitants, including young and 
old Yolks, is thought to be 3000. 

Dhtjion of Inhahitants^ i^c. — There are no religious

Indies. Whatever occupation a man may follow here, he 
is more or lefs engaged in labouring the ground, tends a

ftate of decay, vi^. the caftle of Ardvra«k, the refidence of 
ponald.Bane-MoreMacIeod, laird of Afllnf, it was built 
in the 1597 or 1591 ; the figures are rather worn. It was 
a place of ftrength and defence in its day. 

The other houle was built by the Earl of Seaforth's fon, 
in a modern manner, of an elegant figure, and great ac- 
commodation. It had fourteen bed-chambers, with the 
conveniency of chimnies or fire-places. Both houfes are 
fituated by the north iide of Loch Aflint, and not far from 
the parifli kirk.

this barony and parifli was divided into 32 oxgates of land. 
Some of them are ^ more, and others are lefs rated by the 
old valued rent, as they may have been judged of greater 
or lefs value, according to the extent, ^^c. However, it 
is highly probable that the following calculation may be 
pretty fure. Then, taking all the oxgates, one with the

Coal and Fwf/.— The height df this parKh abounds with 
limeftone. There is no faying but coals may be under it, 
if the vaft quantity of nioor and mofs above it may be 
confumed. It were to be wiftied that a trial was made, as 
the drying and fecuring of fuel is *, for the moft part, a 
very troublefome and an expenfive affair. What are called 
peats are only ufed here. 

The Rent of the Part/h.— The old valued rent of this 
parifh is 4000 merks Scots, exclufive of the few falmon- 
fifliing rivers already mentioned. The real prefent rent is 
about L. 1000 Sterling. 

Iron Mines.— Iron mines were dug here of old. The 
ore was alfo fmelted in different places of this parifh ; but 
the vaft woods being confumed by Scandinavian invafions, 
it was of courfe given up but if coal were found, that 
work might be ftill tried. At Tubeg particularly, thefe 
mines were dug, i^c. ; charcoal was plentifully got, the 
bounds being one thick foreft. John Sinclair, ftill living, 
found a piece of iron ; it was of ftiape roundilh it was not 
caft into bars then; it weighed from 17 to 20 pounds 
weight. This John Sinclair and his mafter caufed the 
fmith to work it as (caibs) edgings for labouring imple- 
ments. 

Marble. — There is plenty of marble at Ledbeg, Ry-an- 
tr?.-id, and Ardvare, clofe by the Kilis, i^c. 

State of the Church, is'c. Schools. — The church and 
manfe had a very flight repair feven or eight years ago j

fo flight indeed, that owing to the very high winds which 
occafionallj prevail here, many of the flates of both are dri- 
 ven or fallen o% and the rain gets in, particularly into the 
manfe, and the gkfs windows of both kirk and manfe are 
greatly injured. At fame time that kirk and manfe were 
repaired, there was a very decent parochial fchool-houfc 
built ; the windows now require a repair of glafs, and th.e 
roof that of a little thatch. Winds occafionally blow ex- 
tremely high here. There are two preaching places, one 
at Achnahiglafh, otherwife called Kirktown; the other 
preaching place at Torbreck, one Englifli mile diftantfrom 
Loch-Inver. The diftance betwixt Achnahiglalli and 
Torbreck is eight long computed miles. 

The minifter's fljpend was, a few years ago, augmented. 
It amounts to L. 87:4: 4^ Sterling, and L. 3 Sterling to 
furmfli communion-elements ; in aU, L. 90 : 4 : 4 There 
is no vidhial-ftipendi and to fay truth, no fuch could 
at the prefent period and ftate of agriculture be expeaed. 
But the providing of visual muft be of great expence to 
every minifter here. The glebe is half an oxgate of land ; 
the grafs part of it is diftinft by itfelf ; partly rocky and 
mountainous; the lower part, or fields, is what is here 
called nin-jig *. The glebe goes by the name, The half 
oxgate of Ca-more. The prefent incumbent caufed build 
« very litttle Highland mill, of the fimpleft conftruaion, 
on the north fide of Fraligal river, and on a particular part 
of the glebe there. The viaual of whatever kind is car- 
ried at a vaft expence, and grounded here, apd faves the 
expence of a fervant.

* That is, half of every little field. The glebe halfs are for moll part 
next the grafs of the glebe. It would be defirable that thefe low grounds 
or fields were divided into two equal halves, and not run-rig, as it 
would have a tendency towards improvement. The prefent minitler has 
launched too much on reducing aad improving the furface of his farm and 
gk'be.

Within lefs than one year preceding this (1794) date, 
thx:re are two fchoolmafters ; the parochial ; the other very 
humanely granted by the Honourable Society for propa^- 
gating Chriftian Knowledge. The former has L. 8 : 6 : 8 
Sterling yearly falary ; the latter L. i3, which was obtamed 
by the application of a few gentlemen graziers here, and 
the narrator gave his concurrence. 

Marriages, ^c— The neareft account that can be given, 
after ftrift enquiry, is the following, -vh. jo marriages and 
10 baptifms, communibus annis. 

Burial Grounds — As for burial places, at a confiderable 
diftance one from the other, there are no lefs than fix. i/, 
At Ach-na-hi-glaQi, 'or Kirktown ; 2^, At Ged-a-vo-lich, 
by the weft of Loch-Nedd ; 3^, At Ardvare, where, as 
formerly faid, there is plenty of marble under the heather, 
which indeed the narrator came accidentally to know of, as 
hehappenedto be travelling alone, and miffed the road-track; 
4f/j, At Oldney Ifland ; 5//&amp;, At the farm of Store •, 6thy 
At Inver farm, near the entry of Inver river to the har- 
bour of fpacious Loch Inver. All thefe burial places are, 
for the moft part, inclofed with a dry ftone fence. The 
inhabitants have a regard for the memory of their de- 
parted friends and relations, perfeftly detached from what 
we call idolatry, as it only confifts in doing all the good 
poffible to the furvivers of the departed. 

State of tJje Poor, and their Funds. — Properly fpeaklng, 
though many here are poor, they cannot be reprefented as 
a burden to the parifti. The natives are all connefted by 
alliance. "When any one becomes old and feeble, their 
neareft relations build a little comfortably houfe for them,

At this period, the pooreft ftranger, even though unac 
quamted, finds charity and fafe /helter. But there is a 
very great diftance (and now no places as of old)' in the 
^vildernefs betwixt this parifli and the inn at Brea of 
otrathokell. Such being the condition of the poor in 
Affint panlh, there are no public funds. The little trifle 
of money that is colleded every Sabbath day after divine 
^vor^llip is ferved, is yearly diftributed amongft the moft 
friendlefs and deferving poor. 

Emmem M//.-^There are noije fuch here in point of 
. grandeur and wealth, except the proprietors. There were 
indeed, men of confiderable and acknowledged education, 
literature, poliflied manners, and hofpitality, viz. Mr 
Mackenzie, late of Ardloch, and Mr Roderick Macleod, 
late of Lcdmore. But the narrator fliould have mentioned 
gs the firft, a gentleman whom he never faw, but heard of 
his charafter, and that was the Jleverend Mr Alexander 
Gray, the laft Epifcopal parfon here. He, by all accounts, 
■\;pas an eminent claffical fcholar. He cpujd fluently fpeak 
the European languages of his day, for wliich reafon he 
was preferred as travelling governor to John Earl of Su- 
therland, when his Lord (hip made the tour of Europe. It 
is faid the Highlanders in friendly converfation called him,

A few high military charafters might be mentioned ; 
but fuch are prefentlj paffed by, as the naming of them 
would fwell this tedious account too much. 

Antiquities.— \\. is at leaft prefumable, if not highly pro- 
bable, that Scandinavian idolatry did prevail here. The 
reafon for ^ntertaining this opinion is, that in ifland Old- 
ney there is a confiderable cairn of ftones, which might 
originally have been a little temple ; in that cairn is yet 
to be feen a hollowed ftone, having a lid, or cover of ftone ; 
it is not a Popifh font, for this reafon, that one Donald 
Macieod, alias Machomafh, once refidenter on Oldney- 
mainland, and other old men in the neighbourhood, all of 
' them honeft undefigning men, declared to the narrator, 
that about 60 years ago there was a round ftone within 
the hollowed one, of the lize and ftiape of a large egg, for 
which efpecially, as alfo for the adjacent burial ground 
there, they and their forefathers had the greateft venera- 
tion : That the above old people faw that round ftone : 
That on account of its variegated minute colours of bright 
and ftiade, it was always fliown to ftrangers : That it was 
ftolen, or privately taken away by a feafaring man, to 
whom, in the ufual manner, it was fliown as a curiofity. 
Whether that round ftone was or Was not the ftone of Loda,' 
mentioned by the immortal Ofllan, the narrator leaves to 
be decided by refearchers in antiquities ; however, that no 
lefs ancient bard than fweet, fings of '* Sniven and the 
" ftone of power." The occafion was, Starno King of 
Lochlin, having been defeated by Fingal,

There is the cleareft evidence of the Druids having been 
b«e m times of old, as to this day there is on the bounds 
ofClachtollfann (three miles direftly inland from that 
fhore) a prodigious pile of huge ftones clofe by a great rock, 
having an entry through no lefs than We moderns would 
call two half-moons ; next appears, an entry by a porch. 
The narrator made an excurfion from Torbreck to the 
•eery place ; he wifhed to have entered ; but fmall ftones 
and earth had fo much filled up the entry, that he could 
ttat make his way. However, a boy who attended went in. 
He had in command not to go farther than the firft apart- 
ment he fliould meet, for fear of miffing bis way in return. 
Having returned, he reported, that there were feveral 
paffages off the large room, into which he entered, and 
that he thought thefe by appearance led to different cham- 
bers. This ancient ruin, in the Gaelic language, is at this 
very period called, Ty-tal-vine-na-drui-nich, /. e. The 
earthly habitation of the Druids *. 

Further, at Ledbeg, a Druidical pruning hook was 
found feveral years ago, in time of peat-cutting. No per- 
fon here could tell what it was, or intended for, until the 
prefent Earl of Briftol, then Biftiop of Derry, happened, in 
couTfe of his northern excurfion, to pafs a few days and 
nights in this parifh. It having been fliown to his Lord- 
ffiip, he inftantly declared it, a Druidical pruning hook. 
His Lordlhip further added, that feveral fuch were found 
in England, and to be feen in the mufeums of the literati 
there. If the narrator remembers, Dr T. Smollet, author 
of the biftory of South Britain, (vol. i. at the very begin- 
ning) makes mention of the Druids and their pruning 
hooks, with which they did yearly cut the oak mifletoe,

thereby pretending to foretel either a favourable feafon, 
or the reverfe. Mrs Mackenzie of Ardloch made a prefcnt 
of this Druidical hook to his Lordfliip. 

Adjacent to the prefent parochial kirk is to be feen the 
onlj remaining part of the firft of that kind that was built 
here. The cafe was, one iEneas, or Angus Macleod, laird 
of Aflint, having gone to Rome to vilic the Popej and the 
Pontiff conferring favours, the laird in return vowed, that 
when he returned to Aflint, he would build and endow a 
kirk, which the laird performed, to the amount of the fiftbi 
part of his then yearly rent. The only veftige of this an- 
cient building is a vault, a burial place ; it is high arched. 
The prefent Mr Macleod of Geanies, Sheriif-depute of the 
county of Rofs, as immediate defcendent of thefe lairds, 
gave it a repair a few years ago, but not to the better, as 
one William Cowie, from Tain, employed, pulled dowa 
an upper apartment which was over the arch, which the 
natives reported to be a place for private devotion. Heath 
now grows on the top of the arch. 

Mifcellaneaus Obfervations. — The Highland girls of this 
parifti for the moft part marry at the age of betwixt i6 
and 21 years; the lads at that of betwixt 20 and 25. There 
are fome inftances of women bearing children to the age of 
50 years at leaft. It is no uncommon fight to fee a grand- 
mother give her breaft to her own grandchild to fuckle. 
Some fond mothers nurfe their children for two years. 
Other mothers nurfe their infants for three ; and truly the 
narrator has ften a boy at his mother's breaft at the age of 
four years, and then break haflc-nuts under his teeth. 

As for dunes, there are fome to be feen here : iji. That 
rery large one at ClachtoU, clofe by the fea, towards the 
farm of Store. It exceeds by far any of the kind the nar- 
rator ever faw. Three circular out- works at regular di- 
ftances, furround it on the land- fide ; the boillerous ocean

defends it on that quarter towards the offing. This dune 
if any, is worthy of taking a draught of. ' 

Idly, There is one at ClaflinelTy, built on thd clefts of 
two rocks, which ftretch out into the turbulent fea there. 

Zdly, There are ruins of a dune in the middle of Loch- 
Ardvare ; the great dune, one at Achamore, the other at 
Achnaheglafli, have been taken away to build office-houfes 
and fences. Befides the above dunes, there are alfo to be 
feen here Cairns, i. e. great heaps of ftones; they are cir- 
cular at the bafe, and raifed in the centre, forming, in fome 
manner, the figure of a cone. The traditional account of 
them is. That they were the fepulchres of the ancient na- 
tives, to prevent the then^nuraerous wolves from devour- 
ing the bodies of their departed relations. In fupport of 
this account, there is even to this day a Gaelic phrafe com- 
nion here, and among all Highlanders, vi'^i. " Mo vis mifli 
*' beo, dei do vas, cara mifli cloidh, er do charn-nan;" i. e. 
« If I be alive after your death, I will carefully lay a ftone 
" on your cairn," i. e. grave. 

The volcanic influence feems to have had effeft here. 
This opinion is founded on the following particulars : On 
the bounds of InchnadafF farm, near its march with that of 
Stronchruby, not fifty yards from the highway, is to be 
feen a very large piece of lime ftone, or rather lime, that 
fufFcred fufion, for it has fome large common granite ftones 
firmly fixed in it. In fome parts' of its fuperficies it is full 
of pores, and black. In lliort, it has all the appearance of 
having fiifFered the greateft poflible heat. Is this the effedl 
of a volcano, or is it not ? Again, from Loch Ah, near 
Layne, a river iflues, which holds its courfe fometimes 
through mofs gravel, and fplintcred rocks, at length it en- 
ters into Loch Aflint at Inchnadaff" ; all the track from 
this laft mentioned to Layne, being five Englifli miles, 
abounds with limeftone in different forms ; but on the op- 

pofite 



of AJftnt. 



p«f,te fide of the river Ah, there is not the fmalleft piece 
of limellone to be found. It only abounds with heather, 
moors bogs, and high rocky hills : This fevering of the 
high limeftone rocks from the oppofite mountainous bleak 
hiJls, joined with the confideration of the river's channel 
above mentioned, can hardly be accounted for but by a- 
fcribing them to fome uncommon convulfion of nature. 

CharaBer of the People, Sifc— They are in general civil 
fober, and hofpitable to a high degree ; but they begin 
fcmvf to obferve, that neither they themfelves, nor their 
fervants, meet equal returns of kindnefs and attention 
when abroad, as they anxiouOy afford here in their 
own homely manner. They are patient of hunger, cold, 
and fatigue, by fea and land, as emergencies may require. 
In general, they are ferious and devout, and do not approve, 
but highly diflike the contrary charafter wherever feen j 
yet, when imprudently provoked or infulted, they will 
fhew themfelves not devoid of refentment. They are 
now becoming every day more induftrious and attentive to 
donicitic affairs. Their manners are fimple and chafte ; 
few mftances, comparatively fpeaking, have occurred here 
to the contrary, for thefe twenty-five years paft ; and 
when they have happened, they were candidly acknow- 
ledged. 

Their ftated cuftoms are few. In time of the holidays, 
relations and neighbouring families mutually vifit, are inno- 
cently chearful and facetious. In the proper feafon of the 
year they repair to the low-country markets to fell cattle, 
and ocher produce of their farms ; in return, they carry 
home viftual, and other articles neceflTary for their families. 

The ftature of the inhabitants is in general of the 
middle fize. Middle fize here is called five feet five or fix 

Vol. XVI. D d inches.

inches. There are fome fix feet high, and but a few above 
that ftandard. 

Advantages and Di/advantages.—The greateft advanta- 
ges of this parifh are, that it moftly lies on a coaft having 
fome harbours, ^c. Its great difadvantages are, that the 
climate is both ftormj and rainy, efpecially at the heights 
of the pariHi, ^c. as particularly defcribed in a preceding 
part of this account. 

By what means the Situation of the Inhabitants and Parijl, 
might he meliorated.— good roads and decent inns. If a 
road were opened from Lairg by Braemore of that parifh ; 
thence'by Rofehall,Tu-tom-tar-vach, by finvin, and Garva- 
chirn, thence to Auld-an,na-kal-gach, the prefent march of 
this parifh with Balnagown property ; any perfon would 
■walk eafily enough betwixt Dunrobin and this parifll of a 
fnort day. Befides roads carried on in Affirit, and inns built, a 
few bridges would be neceffary. One ftore-houfe, if not two ; 
at Loch-Inver one ; at Unapool another ; the former would 
be fufficient to ferve the low, the latter to ferve the higher 
parts of Slilh-a-chilifh, and inhabitants of the height. The 
virtual of the Honourable proprietors put up in thefe florc- 
houfes would prevent the exorbitant prices of importers, 
and fecure the money to the former. People of enterprize, 
charafter, and credit, defirous of profecuting fiflieries and 
manufaftures, fiiould he encouraged to fettle in all places 
where there are harbours, for there is command of mofs 
and water-falls along the coaft, alfo plenty, or rather a pro- 
fufion of flron? and limeftonp to build ; for though there is 
no limeftone in the low part of the parifli, if the roads were 
opened, lime might be had from the height, or from Glcn- 
cul-edrachililh by fea; by fuch being introduce!^, there can

be no faying to what great number the inhabitants might 
increafe, and live much more comfortably than they pre- 
fently do. Even although gentlemen of enterprife ftiould 
not come, villages might be built in or near the harbours, 
which in courfe of time would not fail to produce the 
aforefaid valuable purpofes to the Honourable proprietors 
and the people at large. By either of the above taking 
place, the parifli would find a market at home for all its 
produce, and be able to make better returns. It is as eafy 
and fafe to fail to any part of the world from this coaft, 
and return to it, as any other part whatever of Great Bri- 
tain. In Ihort, the height of this parifli fliould not be de- 
populated for fear of further encroachments. It is a pity 
a charity fchoolmafter were not fettled with a moderate 
falary at Ned, and another at Ledmore. Preparatory to 
the above fuggefted, and other improvements, the proprie- 
tors ought to fend a perfon of fouijd judgment to view and 
determine on the whole.

Situation and Extent. 

' I ^HE parifhes of EfSe and Nevaj, 3 — 4 miles front 
weft to eaft, and 2 — 3 from north to foiith, are bound- 
ed on the eaft and fouth bj the parifli of Glammis, on the 
fouth-weft by Newtjle, on the weft and north by Meigle 
and Airlj ; lying in the prefijytery of Meigle, commif- 
fariot of St Andrew's, fynod and county of Forfar ; in 
extent amounting to 8 fquare miles, that is, about 5120 
Englilli or 4096 Scotch acres ; whereof about 2500. are 
cultiv ed, 530 in pafture, 220 covered with wood, and the 
Remainder heathy and barren. 

Surface 



of EJJie, and Nevay. 



213 



Surface and Soil— The northern declivity of the Slclla 
hills compofes one half of both pariflies. The foil of this 
divillon is a thin black mould, on a bottom of mortar ; but, 
its expofure notwithftanding, it is more fertile, and yields 
earlier crops, than any part of that ridge which fronts the 
fouth. Towards the fummit of the hills the foil degene- 
rates, and is fit for planting or pafture only. The higheft 
part of the fouthern boundary does not exceed 950 feet 
above the level of the adjacent plain. 

The foil of the lower part of the parrfli is various. In 
Nevay, a level and marfliy tra£t, containing fome mofs on 
a ftratum of fand, is a continuation of the extenfive mofs 
of Meigle, No marl has been found in the former, though 
there be abundance in the latter. That traft flretches 
eaftward to the church of Eflie, and north to the Dean. 
Some plots of it are cultivated ; the reft affords indiffe- 
rent pafture. A low and flat territory, north of EfTie, 
confifts of a flrong and rich clay, ill cultivated, and liable 
to be partially inundated by the river, which, in time of 
heavy rains, overflows its low banks. To the eaftward of 
the church the foil is thinner, but friendly to vegetation. 

Climate,— K greater quantity of rain falls in this difkid^r 
than in the low country fouth of Sidla. Laft fpring (1793) 
the fields in this neighbourhood were refrefhed by co- 
pious ftiowers, while the Carfe of Gowrie, and territory 
to the eaftward, remained dry and parched. The reafori 
of this difference feems to be, that all clouds and vapours 
from the fouth wcft are divided near the mouth of the river 
Earn, and attrafted partly by the Sidla Hills, and partly by 
an elevated ridge ftretching along the north coaft of Fife ; 
fo that little rain from that quarter falls upon the interval 
between thofe mountains. But, favoui'ed as Strathmore is 
in thj3 refpefl, the weather in general is extremely vari- 
able.

a rainy feafon the hufbandman cannot always collcft 
day labourers fufficient to manage and bring home the 
crop, fo that part of it is fometimes loft. This inconve- 
nience is never known where cottagers are one of the pro- 
dudtions of the foil. 

The beft arable land is let below 20 s. the acre. No 
rent is paid per advance. No fervices are required, except 
the carriage of fome coals from Dundee. A few of the 
tenants have power to fubfet ; but this privilege is not ge- 
nerally granted. The valued rent of both parifhes is about 
L. 1200 Sects ; the real rent is L. 1270 Sterling. 

An acre of good land well cultivated produces, in fuc- 
eeflion, 10 bolls oats, peafe 5 or 6, wheat 8, turnip valued 
at L. 5 Sterling, barley to bolls, fown grafs 180 — 240 
ftones of hay, beiides another crop for green feeding the 
fame feafon. The prices of grain and hay .are regulated 
by the market at Dundee. The expence of labour, provi- 
fions and implements of hufbandry is the lame as in the 
neighbouring parifli of Meigle, (fee Vol. I. p. 515.) 

Inclofures. — ^Inclofing and fubdividing, partly by ftone- 
walls, and partly by a ditch and bank fet with quick, were 
introduced about 30 years ago by the proprietor ot Nevay. 
A great proportion of the whole diftrifl: is now inclofed 
•with fences of the latter kind, which ftielter the fields from 
inclement blafts more effeaually than ftone walls, but in a 
calm and moift feafon prevent a free circulation of air, and 
thereby prove hurtful to the crop. The ditches, however, 
being fufficient drains, render the fields in all feafons fit for 
cultivation. The pradlice of pruning hedges, fo as to make 
the top flat and the fides perpendiciilar, prevails. A bet- 
ter plan has been adopted in fome neighbouring dilhldls, 
to flope both fides gradually till they meet in a fiiarp 
ridge at top. By this mode of dreffing a hedge, every part 



of Ejfie and Nevtiy.

of the plant being expofed, receives its proper nourifliment. 
In Nevay, rows of trees are planted in the hedges, which 
embellifti the country, but eventually niuft be prejudi- 
cial to the thorns, and the adjoining part of the fields. 

Manures. — Befide the dung of the farm-yards, and com- 
poft, confifting of weeds, ditch-fcourings, ruins of mud- 
walls, i?'c. confiderable quantities of marl are ufed. This 
excellent manure, whofe qualities and operation are now 
well underftood, is fetched from the mofles of Baikie and 
Meigle. The original price is 8 d. per boll, containing 8 
folid feet. Sixty bolls are allowed to an acre ; but, by many 
experiments formerly made in the parifli of Bendochy, it 
appears that a larger proportion will not injure the foil, if 
it be not overcropped. Marl incoiporated with compoft an- 
fwers better than when mixed with farm-yard dung. It is 
ufually fpread on the furface of fallow, or on grafs, fome 
time before a field is broken up. 

Live Stoci.--lAtile attention is paid to the different 
breeds of animals. 141 horfes are ufed for the purpofes of * 
hufbandry ; but moft of thefe are purchafed from diftant 
counties. No black cattle are employed, though a few are 
reared. Sheep are entirely banilhed. 

Mines, iSc. — Near Caftletown there is one mineral 
fpring, and another on Sidla, a mile fouthward of Eflie ; 
but their qualities and virtues are unkfiown. A fmall vein 
of filver ore, too inconfiderable to be wrought, was difco- 
vered feveral years ago in the fouth-eaft corner^ of the pa- 
nib. An excellent freeftone quarry, in the parilh of Ne- 
vay, at the foot of Sidla, has been lately neglefted. The 
ftone is of a light grey colour, and admits of a fine poliflb.

Fuel. — Peats are found in the mofs of Cookftown. The 
apprifed value of every car,t-load, together uuh the ex- 
pence of digging, vpinning, and carrying it two or three 
miles, may amount to 2 s. 6 d. Three cart-loads for do- 
mellic ufe are fcarcely equal to one boll coals of 56 ftones. 
avoirdupois weight, the price of which, including carriage 
1,2 miles, is 9 s. The fcarcity and dearnefs of fuel have 
induced many of the inferior clafe to leave this part of th€ 
country. 

Plantations. — There are few trees in this diftrifl, hedge-^ 
TOWS excepted. • On the eftate of Dunkennie, a mile e? ft- 
■ward of the church of Effie, a fmall thriving plantation of 
Scotch fir diverfifies the fcene and part of Sidia Hills was 
planted by the late Earl of Strath more. A plantation of 
forelt: trees on a barren traft to the weft ward, would b&amp; 
equally ornamental and ufeful. 

Houfes. — There is no town nor village in Effie or Nc- 
vay ; for the cottages near the church of the latter d» 
not tnerit either of tliefe appellations. The farm-houfes 
and offices, with a few exceptions, are neatly built of fub- 
ftantial maibn-work. The dwelling-houfe confifts of tw» 
flories covered with fkte. The huts of fubtenants and me- 
chanics have ftill a mean appearance, though more com- 
fortable than at a preceding period. The farmer's mode 
of living is as much improved as his habitation. His at- 
tire is decent, his houfehold-furniture not inelegant, and hi» 
table plentifully ftored. In affluence he rivals the mid- 
dling order 6f proprietors, and in hofpitality excels them. 

Antiquities.— Ahoxxt a mile weft of the church of Effie, 
on the north iicie of the turnpike-road through the Strath, 
there is an ancient fortification, furrounded on the v eft, 
fouth, and eaft fides, by a very deep and broad ditch, and

on the north by a rivulet, whence the ditch was filled 'vith 
water. Within a vaft earthen mound or rampart '.s 
area 120 yards In length, and 6c in breadth. Some anti- 
quaries have afcribed this work to the Romans-, but uirir 
route lies 2 miles northward, on the oppofite fide of ihe 
river Dean. Some coins of Edward 1. having been found 
in the area, it is probable this fort, or caltle, as it is Vul- 
garly called, was conftrudited by the army 01 that invader. 
Veftiges of a large encampment may be traced at no great 
diltance on the farm of Ingleltowp, a name which feems to 
favour my conjefture. At the ;hurch of Effie there :j a 
Jttone 6 or 8 feet long and a broad, with feveral hiero-ly- 
phical charadlers engraven upon it, reprei'enting a hunting 
match. The purpofe for which this inonument was eretled 
is unknown. At prefent it lies in a rivulet, and mult foon 
be defaced. 

Population.— ^The population of this diftrid has remained 
ne?rly the fame for a cencury paft. A. D. i'J'2'J, it con- 
tained 640 inhabitants. According to the report made to 
Dr Webfter, the number of examinable perfons was 5005 
and there are now (^A.D 1793) 630 fouls. Houfeholders 
132, fervants of both fexes 102, weavers 29, tailors 4, 
flioeniakers 5, wrigUts 5, mafons 4, blackfmiths 3. Ave- 
rage of marriages 10, of births 20, of deaths I2. 

ManufaElures. — No manufafture has been ever eftablifli- 
ed in thefe pariilies, owing to their local fituation, and di- 
ftauce from any confiderable market-town. 

Roach. — A turnpike-road from Perth to Aberdeen tra- 
verfcs ihe parifli of Effie; and near the manfe a toll bar

Glammis, and another from Newtyle, to that fea-port, 
■were lately completed ; and the diftance between one or 
other of thefe places and the moll remote point in the di- 
ftrift does not exceed four miles. 

Church, l^c. — There is a fmall church in each parilh, 
where divine fervice is performed alternately. The church 
of Effie is fituated on an eminence, 2 miles weft of Glam- 
luis, and 5 from Meigle ; that of Nevay ftands on a riling 
ground, formerly furrounded by a marfh 2i miles S. W. 
of Effie. Both are mean fabrics. The date of the union 
of thefe parifhes was prior to the middle of lafl century. 
The manfe, near the church of Effie, has a commanding 
profpea to the weft and north-weft. It is well built, and 
the offices are in good conditio. 

By an old decreet of locality, the ftlpend was afcertained

Name, Situation, Soil, i^c* 

'JpHE name of the parifh is Strath/wordle, but for the 
fake of brevity it is called Strath, which is Gaelic, 
and fignifies a valley ; but fwordle has no affinity to the 
Gaelic : probably it is of Danifli origin. There are two 
farms in this ifland called Swordle, one of them in the 
middle of this parifli. Strath is lituated in the county of 
Invernefs, prefbytery of Sky, and Synod of Glenelg. The 
form of the parilh is very irregular. Its length is about 
13 Scotch miles, and its greateft breadth 3^ miles. It is 
bounded on the E. by the fea, which divides it from the 
mainland of Applecrofs and L-Khailfh; on the S, and S E. 
by the panlh of Sleat ; on the W. by the parifh of Bi uca- 

dale ;

dale ; and on the N. and N. W. bj the parifli of Portree. 
The middle of the parifh is flat, but the greater part hilly. 
The hillb on the north fide of the parifti are of a conical 
form, and very high. Such as have afcended their tops 
are of opinion, that volcanic eruptions have once takea 
place here, as tne rubbifti which is to be met with along 
their fides and at their bottom is not unlike lava. The hills 
that lie in the other diftrias of the parifh are covered with 
heath. The foil is various ; in fome parts clay, in fome 
places a black loam, but by far the greater part mofly. 
There is great abundance of limeftone ; fome marble, but 
of an inferior kind, and too porous to admit of a-fine po- 
lifti. There is likewife a very good quarry of freeftone, 
chiefly of a light blue colour. In the fmall illand of Pabba 
there is the appearance of iron ore. Marl in abundance is 
found here in different places. The air is moift and foggy : 
More rain falls in this parifti than in any other part of Sky. 
The moft prevalent diftempers are rheumatifms, colds, and 
nervous fevers, 

Ft/1:), Kelp, Harbours, IJlands, ^c— The fifli caught oa 
the coaft are cod, ling, mackrel, fcate, flounder, lythe, fye, 
cuddies, and herring, but verj- few of thefe are exported. 
The herring for a few years back have not frequented the 
lochs of this panfli in fuch quantities as formerly, nor have 
they ftaid fo long — About 100 tons of kelp are made here 
annually, which, four years ago, told for 'L.S per ton; but 
for thefe three laft years, has fallen to L. 4, and even to 
L. 3, 10 s. The two fmall iflands of Pabba and Scalpa 
conllitute a part of this parifti-, they lie to the eaft of it, 
and are diftant about two thirds of a mile. The former is 
only a wmtering pla(.e for cattle, of which it may iupport 
ftom 70 to 80 for half a year. The latter is 3 miles in 

length.

length, and from i to 2 in breadth, and is inhabited. The 
harbours are Loch Slapan, Loch Einart, and the Sound of 
Scalpa, where veffels of any burden may fafely anchor. 
There are fome frefh water lakes which are ftored with red. 
and white trout, and in one of them there are a few Sal- 
mon, which are caught in a copious rivulet that runs from 
one of the lakes to the fea. Oyfters, lobfters, crabs, lim- 
pets, fpout-fifh, and various other forts of fliell-fifti, are to 
be found on the Ihores. The birds that moft commonly 
frequent the fliores are the wild goofe, folan goofe, cor- 
morant, fcale-drake, duck,' teal, fea magpie, crane, curlew, 
plover, fandy lark, with gulls of different kind*. In the 
hills are deer, moorfowl, and black-game; the wild pigeon, 
hooded crow, and eagle, neftle in the rocks. 

Population. — "With refpe£l to the ancient ftate of the po- 
pulation of the parifli, little is known. There is every 
reafon to believe that it has confiderably increafed within 
tiiefe 20 years. The increafe may be attributed to inocu- 
lation for the fmall-pox having been praflifed here for at 
leaft 25 years, and to the letting the lands to fmall tenants. 
About 15 years ago, the whole parifli was in the hands of 
a few gentlemen, fome of whom had four or five farms ; 
but the number of gentlemen-farmers is now reduced to 
one or two ; and the other farms are let to fmall tenants, 
and ten families, confifting of five perfons each at an ave- 
rage, are now living, where formerly there were not above 
three. Ten years ago the lift of examinable perfons con- 
tained upwards of 1200*; none included under 9 years of 
age. The prefent population, according to a lift made out 

in June 1794, is 1579 fouls.

There are here no extwordi nary inflances of longevity, 
fcut there are a few now living between 80 and 90 years 
of age. There is no tradefman here that confines himfelf 
folely to his trade, but is. occafionally a farmer, finierman, 
weaver, tailor, fhoemaker, or carpenter, b'.c. There is no 
feftary of any kind or denomination in the parifh. The 
heritors are two, Lord Macdonald, and Mr Macalafter 
of Strathaird. 

Produce, Rents.— t\i&amp;r&amp; is no grain raifed in the pariili 
but oats, which are fown in April, and reaped from the 
firfl; of September to the middle of Oftober. Potatoes 
make a principal article of the food of the lower clafles qf 
people. They are planted in April and May, and ready 
for digging in Aiiguft and Septembet. The parilh an- 
nually imports a great quantity of meal. The farmers de- 
pend on the fale of black cattle for the means of paying 
their rents, and fupplying their families with what other 
articles of provifion and clothing they may need. There 
iare 2,5 farms in the parifh, and only about 15 fmall 
ploughs of the Scotch kind are employed, drawn by 
four horfes yoked, a-breaft. Many of the fmall tenants 
turn up the ground with the Coifchroim, (crooked 
fpade.) The rent of the parifl:i, without including the 
kelp Ihores, is about L. 1300. There are in the parifli 
2213 black cattle, 501 horfes, 2486 fheep, and upwards 
of 180 goats. Black cattle fold this year from L. 2 to 
L. 3, 8 s. per head. Sheep at 6 s. Butter and cheefe, 
very little of which is fold from the parifli, fells at 
prefent, the former i2s. and the latter 5 s. per ftone. 
iFor geefe, ducks, hens, and eggs, there is no market, 
nor limited price. The yearly wages for men-fervants 
are from L. 3 to L. 5, behdes 3 pair of Ihoes. To an over-

feer from L. 4 to L. 7, befides the fowing of 'fome feed. 
Women-fervants have from 12 s. to 20 s. befides fhoes. 

Stipend f School, Poor. — The value of the living may be 
about L. 80, including the glebe, and a fmall allowance for 
communion-elements. The Crown is patron. There is 
no manfe. There are three different places of worfliip, 
but only one church, which was formerly a Popifh chapel. 
At two of the places of worlhip the minifter preaches at 
the fide of a hill when the weather is fairj when other- 
wife, he enters into one of the tenant's huts, with as many 
of the people as can follow him. The number of poor on 
the parifh-roU is 15. There is no fund to provide for 
them, but what arifes from the weekly colleftions, and the 
fines of delinquents, which together generally amount to 
between L, 4 and L. 5 yearly. There is a parochial fchool, 
where reading, writing, arithmetic, and Latin are taught. 
The falary and fcholar's fees may amount to L. 22 annu- 
ally. The number of fcholars attending in winter will be 
about 60 •, in fummer fcarce the half. An additional 
fchool is much needed in the parifli. 

Antiquities, Natural Curiofities, Language.^ln theparifh 
are the remains of four Popilh chapels, -viz. one at Ai(k, 
one at Kilbride, one at Kilmori, and one in the fmall ifland 
of Pabba. On the weft fide of the parilli are the ruins of 
feven towers of a circular form, erefted on rocks •, every 
one of ^hefe towers are built in fight of one or more of the 
fame From the fouthmoft of thefe towers are to be feen 
others in the patiih of Sleat, and from thefe laft, others on 
the oppofite fhore of Arifaig. On the eaft fide of the pa, 
rifi. are a number of tumuli, and in fuch of them as hav« 
been dug up were found urns full of alhes. There

tradit?on that a battle was fought here by the Danes. In 
the dillria of the parifti called Strathaird, are a number of 
caves. A man entered lately into one of them, with a 
lighted candle, in order to examine it, but could not pro- 
ceed, by reafon of its dampnefs, and the drops of water 
that fell from the top of it. In one of thefe caves Charles 
Steuart, the Pretender, lodged for fome nights in 1746. 
In the higheft part of the iHand of Scalpa there is a petri- 
fied rock of mofe, in which are a variety of fhells ; and in 
many other places throughout the higher parts of the ifland, 
great quantities of fhells are to be met with feveral feet 
under ground. In the fmall ifland of Pabba, formerly 
mentioned, are to be feen, in the rocks and ftones in the 
ftiore, feveral petrified fifh, of different fizes, generally in- 
deed below ten inches ; but there are eels of nearly double 
the length. Some appear whole, and others broken, and 
when ftruck forcibly with a ftone or hammer, they often 
fplit in two, and the marks of the bones are vifible in the 
rock. The language fpoken here is the Gaelic,' yet few 
of the names of places feem to be derived from it. 

Mijcellaneom Obfervations. — The people in general are 
of the middle fize. In a tolerable degree they enjoy the 
comforts of life. Their drefs, diet, and lodging, however, 
ftand ftill in need of amendment. It is the general opi- 
nion, that their condition would be ameliorated if they had 
longer leafes, and greater encouragement for improvements. 
They much regret that their proprietors ftay too fliort time 
among them, to obtain a full and true account of the real 
Hate of the people. The inhabitants, for want of a fuffi- 
cient capital, are unable to profecute the fifhing to any ex- 
tent. But if the proprietors would take the fifh and black 
cattle in payment of the rents, or even procure good mar- 
kets 



?2,8 Statijlical Account 

kets for both, it would undoubtedly fpur on the tenants to 
iaduftry. Would not the bounties ;and premiums (exclu- 
five of the fifh) be of effential benefit to the Highlands, if 
the inhabitants could obtain them ? Would not the money 
thus acquired be m part, at leaft, laid out in improving the 
country ? Peat is the only fuel ufed here \ a great part of 
the fummer is wafted in digging and leading them home. 
The roads through the parifh are very indifferent There 
is but one inn in the parifh, yet whiiky, brought froni 
Ferrintofh, is fold by the bottle in many places. If this 
praftice is tolerated, there -is danger that the people be- 
come poor, quarrelfome, and immoral. There are two 
tryfts for cattle held in the parifh annually, on the 
laft week_pf the months of May ajid July. There is one 
ferry (on the poft-road from Invernefs to this country) at 
Keil, the S. E. extremity of the parifti. Salt is often here 
a fcarce commodity. It has happened, oftener than once, 
. that an ounce of fait was not to be had here, at the very 
time when the greateft ftioals of. herring entered the lochs; 
and a barrel of herring has fold frelh lifor 2 s. which, if 
faked, would have fold for 12 s. Some wafte lands have 
lately been improved. Mr Macdonald, tackfman of Scal- 
pa, has given encouragement to a few families to fettle on 
a part of his extenfive farms, and this colony, from the af- 
fiftance given them by that gentleman, and their own inr 
duftry, are now in a thriving condition. The mode of 
dreffing the corn to be ground by what is C2X\t6i. .Gradan, 
is here ftill in ufe. By this operation they fave the trouble 
of threfliing and kiln-drying the grain. Fire is fet to the 
ftraw, and the flame and heat parches the grain ; it is then 
made into meal on the quern. This meal looks very black, 
butt.iftes well enough, and , is efteemed very wholefome. 
The whole of the work is performed by the , women. The 
■• - only

only apology given by themfelves, for this mode of pre- 
paring the grain, is,-, that the quantity of grain which the 
generality have is very fmall, and many of them are at a 
great diftance from a mill. The cattle do not want the 
ftraw,becaufe they lie out all winter in good pafture, and 
as fnow does not lie long on the ground, they can always 
have enough of food.

Name, Boundaries, and Extent. 

IN the charter granted by King David I. to the Abbey 
of Selkirk, mention is made of Bothenden, which feems 
to favour the conjefture of this parifli being named after a 
St Bothen or Bodwin, and the fcite can ftill be pointed out 
of his tower near the village. Yet the name may be de- 
rived from a den or dean in the bow or curve of a fmall ri- 
vulet, which is defcriptive of the place where the church is 
faid to have once flood. It is bounded on the N. by Mel- 
rofe parilh ; on the E. moftly by St Bofwells, though 
partly alfo by Langnewton annexed to Ancrum ; on the S. 
by LiUiefleaf ; on the W. by Selkirk 5 and on the N. W. 



ofBowde?!. 231 

by Galaflilels. Its greateft length from E. to W. is 6 
miles. Its greateft breadth from S. to N. is about 4|. 
miles. At an average it may be about 4 by 3 miles. 
The whole parifli having been meafured, either for the di- 
vifion of run-rig lands, or for being let by the acre, b 
known to contain nearly 6700 acres *. 

Surface., Soil, and Climate. — The furface is much varied. 
One of the Eildon hills, and one half of another, are in 
this parilh. From one broad and elevated bafe, three co- 
nical tops arife, which, from their lituation in a flat coun- 
try, more than from their height, are feen at a great di- 
ftance. Some parts of them alfo being covered with a 
kind of red ftone, without a pile of grafs, have a Angular 
and ftriking appearance. Several little eminences and 
ridges nin from W. to E. with fmall vallies of fine mea- 
dow between them, all abounding with fprings of water, 
which, when coUefted, run into Tweed, about two miles to 
the eaftward of this parifli, except one or two ftreamlets 
which fall into Ale water, its fouthern boundary. In ge- 
neral, the whole parifli is naturally grafly, except about 
200 acres, including the higher parts of thefe ridges, which 
are inclined to broom or furze, and about the fame quan- 
tity bearing a kind of ftunted heath. , About 3-4ths of the 
parifli have been, at one time or another, under the plough. 
The other i-4th conflfts of bog, mofs, and plantations of 
fir and foreft trees. Of thefe laft there are too few, efpc- 
cially as they are profitable to the proprietor, as well as to 
the farmer, for flielter, and to the people for fuel. There 
is fome old wood, but of no great extent. Two- thirds of 
the parifli are inclofed moftly with ditch and hedges of 

thorns,

thorns, which thrive well when properly taken care of. 
,The foil of far the greateft part is a white binding clay on 
a tilly bottom, which retains moifture, becomes hard in 
drought, and can only be laboured and fown to advantage 
when the feafon is neither too wet nor too dry. About 
i-6th of it is well adapted to wheat ; another i-6th is 
ftiarp, lets water eafily fink, is very manageable, and 
produces good turnips, corn, and grafs. Moft of the parifli 
is, on the whole, as well fuited to pafturage as to tillage, 
and will pay as well. The expofure in general is high and 
eafterly, which, together with the clayey foil, renders the 
crops often late, precarious, and apt to fufFer much from 
rainy harvefts and early frofts. In the 1782, a great deal 
of corn was uncut at Martinmas, and feveral farmers, in- 
ftead of paying their rents from their crops, were obliged 
to purchafe grain. Many oats yielded that year no more

Farms, Rents, Heritors.— T\\t farms are very unequal,

all of whom occafionally refide, and about 50 fmall feuers 
in Bowden and Middleham, who pay of teind, feu, life, to 
his Grace about i-8th of the yearly value of their fub- 
je£ls *. 

Cultivation, Manures, and Produce. — There were for- 
merly 26 ploughs in the parifli, each drawn by 2 oxen, 
and 3, or at leaft 2 horfes ; and 10 or 12 drawn by 2 horfes 
only. No oxen are now employed. Some attempts to 
worTc them by themfelves are not likely to fucceed ; fer- 
vants being prejudiced againft them, and doing all in their 
power to prevent this praftice from taking place. There 
are at prefent 44 plouglis, each drawn by 2 horfes, and both 
driven and held by one man. The change has not contri- 
buted much to raife better crops, or to benefit the farmer. 
The Englifli plough, with the broad or plate fock, is uni- 
v^rfally ufed -, though fome are returning occafionally to 
the old Scots plough, which is certainly preferable in ftony 
or ftrong clay lands. Several moffes in the parifii and 
neighbourhood, abounding with fliell marl, have lately been 
drained. Thofe in the parifh belong to the Duke of Rox- 
burgh, and the marl is ufed only by his tenants j but in 
the neighbourhood, it is fold at 6 d. pcr cnx^ drawn by one, 
and at 9 d. per cart drawn by two horfes, and can be car- 
ried 6 or 7 miles to good advantage. Thirty of the one, 
or forty-five of the other, are laid on an acre of the Iharp. 
dryland. Strong clay lands require more. Lime is aifo 
brought from Mid LoLhi^n, about 28 miles, at the rate of 
12 s. /fr cart, containing nearly 3 bolls of llielis, and ufed 
in the proportion of 6 carts to 25 of marl. Both .contribute.

to raife excellent crops of corn and grafs. Lime produces 
better grain, but marl anfwers beft for grafs, efpecially for 
pafture. After trying many varieties of every grain, the 
moft approved are now white oats, barley bear, • (fo 
called to diftinguifh it from rough bear, or big) ; early 
peafe, here called hot feed; and Kentifh, or Cleaveland 
wheat. Very little rye, is fown, and no flax but for family 
ufe. On about 1650 acres, about iioo bolls of diffe- 
rent grains are annually fown •, nearly as follows, viz. I20 
of wheat, 100 of peafe, 750 of oats, and 130 of barley; 
■which laft is followed by a hay crop. There are befides 
140 acres, yearly, in turnip; 50 in potatoes; and i6p in fal- 
low. Turnips are generally fucceeded by barley ; potatoes 
fome times by barley, but more commonly by oats; fallow 
partly by wheat and partly by oats ; and lands, ploughed out 
of lee or pafture, are always fown with oats. After maintain- 
ing the inhabitants, the annual exports may be about 350 
bolls of oat-meal, at L. l, 5 per boll ; 300 ditto of barley, 
at 18 s. ; and 450 ditto of wheat, at L. i, 2 s. amounting in 
all to L. 1202, 10 s. per anrtum. 

Horfes, Black Cattle, Sheep, and r-Foo/.— There are 160 
horfes of different ages in the parifli, one-fourth of which are 
too young for labour. The black cattle of all ages may be 
540. About QO are reared ye«rly, and about 50 are ftall- 
fed for the butcher, which weigh at an average from 45 to 
CO ftone of i6 lb. Dutch v;.ight *. The cows of the fame 
breed, when fattened, weigh about 36 ftone. About 80 
fwine are annually fed, n;cftly by tradefmcn. ihey

for 4 months on the refufe of potatoes, and a little bruifed 
oats or barlej, they weigh 10 or 12 ftone. Being killed fo 
young, they are very fine food, and of great fervice to a 
family. The number of fheep is about 2300, mofll3rof 
the white- faced long-bodied kind, and weighing from 
12 lb. to 141b. /er quarter. Till of late, little attention 
was paid to the improvement of viool \ but now the en- 
couragement given by premiums, and the force of example, 
have, perhaps, carried the ftock of fheep here to as great 
perfedtion in that refpea as the climate and foil will admit* 
The wool has fold for 18 s. per ftone. The common dif- 
eafes of the Iheep are the rot, a kind of confumption occa- 
fioned by overftocking the paftures, and by rainy feafons, 
efpeciaUy a rainy autumn ; and the Jurdjf, or water in the 
head, which attacks them when about a year old, chiefly in 
the months of April, May, and June; and is of fo eorrofive 
a nature as to perforate the ikull into holes large enough to 
admit a pea or fmall bean. One (beep in 40 falls by this 
difeafe. Such as are afFefted by it become at firft giddy, af- 
terwards ftupid, and feldora or never recover. No ewes are 
milked. The cheefe and butter, made from cows milk, 
are moftly confuraed in the pariOi, efpecially the latter; 
which is much ufed in faking the fheep, at the rate of 
from 4 lb. to 6 lb. to the Scotch pint of tar. 

Popu/ation.— The population of this parifh in 1755 a- 
mounted to 672 fouls. At prefent (January 1794) the

About one third of the inhabitants are Burghers and 
Antiburghers. The latter have a meeting-houfe in the 
parifh the congregation of which, from this and other pa- 
rifties, pays their minifter L. 60 per annum. There are 4 
corn-mills, each of which draws fome multures; but that 
fervitude is beginning to be abolifhed. A threfhing machine 
is newly erefted, which does a great deal of work ; but 
when the prime coft, and intereft thereon, tear and wear of 
every kind, the number of hands, and the extraordmary 
wafte of horfes, are all taken into the account, it may not 
be of great profit to the proprietor. ^^^^

FueUnd Labour.— There are no manufaaures, owing to 
the dearnefs of fuel. Coals muft be chiefly depended oa; 
and they are brought a8 and 30 miles frona Lothian, at 
the rate of i s. per cwt. Few or no peats are to be had ; 
but the people are much benefited by weedmgs of 
plantations, which are frequently fold in the neighbour- 
hood. Small feuers and tenants, who have not ground 
enough to employ themfelves and horfes, drive coal, lime, 
and marl for hire •, the lime at 9 s. and the marl at i s. 4 d. 
/)tfr two-horfe cart, or at 4 s. per day for a man, cart, and 
% horfes. The wages of a man-fervant, who eats in the 
houfe, are from L. 7 to L. 8 Sterling per annum. Maid- 
fervants get L. a, 10 s. and L. 2, 15 s. for the fummer, and 
L. I, 5 s. for the winter half-year. But a married farm- 
fervant, who provides his own visuals, receives about the 
value of L. 14 or L. 15 Sterling in oats, barley, peafe, flax,, 
potatoe, and the maintenance of a cow through the year. 
Upon thefe wages he may bring up his family in a decent 
manner, and give his children a tolerable education, if he 
and his wife be induftrious and frugal. In harvelt, which 
commonly lafts about four weeks, a man gets L. i, 6 s. and 
a woman. L. i, and their maintenance. At all other times, 
a man gets is. 2d. per day, and a woman yd. or 8 d. in 
fummer *, and a man i s. in winter, both furniftiing their 
own viftuals. Men working by the piece do atleaft i-4th,. 
if not i-3d more than on day's wages •, which makes their 
employers let as much work by the piece as they can. A 
mafon earns i s. 8 d. and a carpenter i s. 6 d. /)er day with- 
out viftuals. A carpenter gets i s. and a tailor 8 d. witli 
their vl£luals. Servants wages are doubled within thefe 
40 years.

Statijlical Account 

Di/ea/es.^No difeafes are peculiar to this parilh. Fe- 
vers, at an interval of perhaps 8 or lo years, have proved 
mortal ; and the natural fmall-pox carry off many 
children. Inoculation, that falutary mean of preferving 
them, is far from becoming general ; the Seceders being 
much prejudiced againU it, though in many families it has 
been attended with its ufual fuccefs. Confumptions are 
not unfrequent ; but, on the xvhole, the people enjoy good 
health. ^ ^ ^ 

Eccl'JiaJlical State, Schools.^Tht church is old long 
narrow, and needs reparation. A vault adjoining to it is 
the burymg-place of the ducal family of Roxburgh. The 
coffins are above ground ; and fome of them, by the dates 
upon them, have ftood upwards of 200 years, and are ftiU 
entire. An excellent manfe and office-houfes are newly 
finiflied. The ftipend confifts of 5 chalders of vidual, Lia 
meafure, 2-3ds of which are oat-meal, and i-^A is blrley, 
400 merks in money, and 40 merks for communion-ekL 
raents. The glebe is 16 Englilh acres, about 3 of which 
are meadow. The Duke of Roxburgh is patron. The 
parochial fchoolmafter at Bowden has a falary of L. 8, 6s. 
8 d. ^terling, and about 70 fcholars. Of thefe, 30 read 
Englifii at I s.per quarter, 25 both read and write at i s. 
6 d. and about 15 commonly are taught arithmetic, book- 
keeping, and mathematics, on fuch terms as can be agreed 
upon. The fchoolmafter has about L. 3 for colledting poors- 
rates, and a dvvelling-houfe and garden worth L. 2, making 
in all about L. 30 yearly. There is alfo a fchool and a fchool- 
houfe at Middleham. The mafter has a falary of L. 3, and 
gets his viftuals, during the teaching feafon, from the different 
families, according to the number of children they have at 
the fchool, which, at an average, is about 30, fo that he 
cannot draw annually above L. 7 or L. 8 Sterling. 

Poor. 



of Bowden. 



^39 



Poor. — The number of poor on the roll for the laftfeven 
years has been 20. They are all maintained in their own 
houfes, or boarded in other families. The annual fum ex- 
pended upon them, may amount to L. 65 Sterling, which 
is levied at two different times in the year from the pro- 
prietors and tenants equally. This affeffment is laid on 
by the proprietors but the tenants have a vote in the di- 
ftribution of it. The collections at church on Sundays are 
fmall, and do little more than pay the falaries of the pre- 
centor and beadle. There is only one beggar in the pa- 
rifli ; but ftroUing poor from other places come among us 
at all feafons. 

Roads. — The roads are pretty well taken care of by the 
, Juftices of the diftrifl. Formerly i s. 6 d. for each man, 
and a s. for each horfe, were levied annually for llatute' 
labour. By a late aft of Parliament, it is now laid on ac- 
cording to the valued rents, and paid by the poffeffors. 
The management is veiled in Juftices of Peace and Com- 
miffioners of Supply, and other truftees. The utmoft they 
can exafl: Ls 10 s. Sterling on the L. ico Scots of valued 
lent, but they can make it as low as they pleafe when the 
ftate of the roads allow. 

Birds and Beajls. — There are plenty of partridges, fome 
plovers, woodcocks, fnipes, curlews, and other birds, both 
ftationary and migratory, which are common in this part 
of Scotland, Little injury is done by birds of prey j but 
much was formerly fultained from foxes, to which the furze 
and brufli-wood on the lower Ikirts of Eildon, both in this and 
Melrofe parifti, afford cover. Of late, however, their num- 
ber has been dimi.iiaied by the Noblemen and Gentlemen 



Statijlical Accvunt 



of the Caledonian Hunt, and others who keep hounds. 
Hares abound. 

CharaBer of the People. — The people in general are 
fober and induftrious. Few of them engage in adventures 
or fpeculations, except in the line of farming, and even there 
with a prudent caution. Their divlfions, in religious opi- 
nions, do not now occafion fo great a want of cordial inter- 
courfe as formerly, and the prejudices of fefts are dailj 
dying away. 

Antiquities. — The remains of a military road, with cir- 
cular ftations or camps, at the diftance of two or three 
miles, fuppofed to be Roman, can be traced, running nearly 
N. through the centre and broadeft part of the parilh, about 
a mile to the wellward of the church, from Beaulieu in the 
paritli of Lilliefleaf to Caldlliiels in the parilh of Gala- 
fhiels. ,ln fome places, all veftiges of it are deftroyed by 
the plough ; but in other places traces of it are ftill vilibie, 
in the form of a large ditch, about 20 feet wide •, and in 
feme fpots, of two ditches of that width, at the diftance of 
5a feet. The camps or ftations are all on eminences in 
view of each- other; and different weapons, or inftruments 
of war, have been dug up by people ploughing or ditching 
around them, as well as in the adjacent moffes. 

There was, not long ago, a flrong fortification, of its kind, 
at Holydean or Haliedean, once a refidence of the family 
of Roxburgh. The court-yard, containing about \ of an 
acre, was furrounded by ftrong ftone and lime walls, 4 feet 
thick and 16 feet high, with flanting holes, between five 
freeftones, about 30 feet from each other ; from which an 
arrow or a mufket could have been pointed in different di- 
reaions. Upon an arched gatew'ay in the front there was 
a ftrong iron gate. Within the court ftood two ftrong 
° . towersj 



of Bowden. 



241 



towers, the one of 3, the other of 5 ftories, confifting of 8 
or 10 lodgeable rooms, befides porters lodges, fervants 
hall, vaulted cellars, bakehoufes, ISc. The roof and floor- 
ing, being all of the ftrongeft oak, if kept in the ftate in 
which they then were, might have flood for a century. 
But during the minority of the prefent Duke, while he 
was abroad, without his knowledge, his then commifllioner 
ordered this building to be moftly pulled down, merely for 
the fake of getting the freeftones in them to build a large 
farm-houfe and appurtenances, at the diftance of 3 miles, 
though the difliculty of feparating thefe flones from the 
lime made them a dear purchafe. Some of the vaults ftill 
remain, and are ufed by the tenant ; and about 160 feet of 
the court wall are perfectly entire, which makes the de- 
molition of the reft to be much regretted, as the whole 
building was ftately and ornamental to the place, as well as 
venerable for its antiquity. One ftone, prefer ved from the 
ruins, and now a lintel to the door of the farm-houfe at 
Holydean, has in the middle an unicorn's head and three 
ftars, with this infcription on either fide :

About 140 y?rds from tbe principal houfe on the top of 
a precipice hanging over a burn, there had been a chapel or 
place of worfliip, and a burying ground, as appears from a 
number of grave flones, handles of coffins, and pieces of hu- 
man bones, which have been dug up from time to time. 
Hence probably has arifen the name Holydean or Halie- 
dean. 

The greateft curiofity, perhaps, of its kind in Britain, is 
a ftone dike without lime, which inclofes about 500 acres 
of this farm, and has ftood more than 300 years, yet is ftill 
a tolerable fence. It has at firft been 6 or 7 feet high 



242 Statijlical Account 



■with capftones. In an old tack, this inclofure is called, 
" The great deer park of Haliedean," and was once full of 
wood ; but it has long been fubdivided, and all the trees 
cut down, except a few old birches. 

Here, as well as in other parts of Scotland, many birch, 
fir, and oak trees have been found in the moffes ; fome qf 
them 3 feet in diameter, and feveral of the firs and oaks 
quite found. They generally lie from 3 to 8 feet below 
the fur face. Human bones alfo, and many horns of diffe- 
rent animals, have been dug up, quite beyond the fize of 
the largeft to be any where feen at this time. How the 
former were laid there, and how the latter acquired their 
enormous fize, leaves room for conjeaure. Where they 
are found, the fubftance of the mofs is condenfed fog, to ap- 
pearance as frefh and diftinft as that upon old lea ground. 
This too may afford matter of curious fpeculation. 

The family of Carre of Cavers deferves alfo to be naen- 
tioned, as one of the moft ancient in the S. of Scotland. 
Their chief refidence, for many generations, has been in 
the parifli. George Carre, Efq; of Nilbet, a Lord of Sef- 
fion, was defcended from a branch of this family. They 
are fuppofed to have fprung from Kerr of Ferniherft. One 
of their anceilors claimed the title of Lord Jedburgh ; but 
from the different manner in which they fpell their name, 
it feems probable, either that they are a diftina family, or 
s» very old cadet.

The obfervations that occur in the Statiftical Account 
of thefe two parifhes, as to the foil, climate, fiiliing, price 
of provlfions, equally apply to Anltruther Eafter, and need 
not be repeated here. 

Church, Stipend, yc—Till the year 1636, the town of 
Anftruther, and the barony, was in the parilb of Kilrennie ; 
but though the church was at Kilrennie, th'^ fftinifter re- 
fided at Anftruther, and was ftyled the mihifter of that 
town. In the above mentioned year, the town of Eafter

Anftruther was creeled into a feparate charge, andachnrcb 
built. The ftipend arifes from the tithes of the fifli, a grant 
from his Majefty of part ©f the bifhops rents, and fome 
money mortified for that purpofe, and may be reckoned 
between L. 70 and L. 80. Sir John Anftruther is the 
patron. 

Population. — ^In 1744, the number was 1000; in 1764, 
it was 900 ; at prefent, it is fuppofed rather above 1000. 
The average of births 36 ; deaths 24. 

Port, Shipping, l^c. — In 1710, Anftruther, which for- 
merly was a creek of the cuftomhoufe of Kirkcaldy, was 
made a port, and a cuftomhoufe eftabliftied. 

In 1753, a new key was built; and to defray the ex- 
pence an aft of Parliament was procured, laying a tax of 
twopennies Scots upon every pint of ale brewed or fold in 
the burgh. For fome years of late the produce has not 
been more than a third of what it was at the beginning. 

In 1768, the tonnage belonging to Anftruther Eafter was 
80 ton-, it is now 1400. 

Ship-building has been carried on for fome years to a 
confiderable extent.— There is a thread-manufaaure. 

Poor.— The poor are fupported by the weekly collec 
tions-, befides which the ftiipmafters have a large fund, from 
which they are able to make a decent provifion for the 
widows and orphans of their Society. The trades have a 
fund for their poor.

THE PARISH OF HOY 

T^OES not furnifh much room for Statiftical invefliga- 
tion, and the few obfervations which occur refpecling 
it may be comprehended within narrow bounds. The 
origin of its name cannot now be afcertained. 

Situation and Extent. — The parifh is fituated in the 
county of Orkney, Synod of Kirkwall, and Prefbytery of 
Cairftons. It is of a triangular form, furrounded by the 
parifhes of Walls to the fouth fide ; the parifties of Orphir, 
Stennis, and Stromnefs, upon the eaft and north fide j and 

the

the Atlantic Ocean to the weftward. The parlfh from 
N. W. to S. E. is about 9 or 10 miles long, and in gene- 
ral is about 6 miles broad. It may be called a very hilly 
or mountainous diftrift. One of thefe hills in particu- 
lar being fo fteep in many places of it, is almoft inacceflible 
on account of rocks of an uncommon fize. Someftrangers 
■with their mathematical inftruments have computed the 
height of it, from the water's edge to the top, an Englifti 
mile. There is neither pafture nor heath grows upon it, 
and it only ferves as a fine mark for mariners or feafaring 
people to bring them into a fafe harbour. 

Soil and Climate. — The land or arable ground in this 
place is generally wet and fpongy ; the foil light, and bet- 
ter calculated for grafs than for grain. The air is healthy, 
and the people generally long-lived ; one perfon, in parti- 
cular, who had refided in the parifh from his youth, died 
fome years ago at the advanced age of 100. 

Sheep. — The principal circumftance for which this parifti 
is remarkable is their ftieep, if they were properly taken care 
of as in other countries to the fouthward \ but no arguments 
will prevail with the country people of the parilh to take 
better care of them, except their landlords would interpofe 
their authority, which they will not. The flieep all run 
wild in thefe mount^iins, and are never got until they run 
them down with their dogs, and by that means they are 
much abufed. Some of thefe fheep will run with three or 
four years wool upon them, and when hounded by their 
dogs, they run g -nerally to the rocks, where there is no 
po'ffibility of accefs to them. Many of their young lambs 
are devoured, and picked up by eagles and other birds of 
prey, which are very numerous in this place ; and in the 
winter-feafon, when the (heep come down to the fea-fide 

to 



of Hoy and Grcemfay. 547 



to feed upon fea- weeds or ware, they are often carried away 
by the high tides that commonly take place in ftormy 
weather. As to the number of their fheep, it would be no eafy 
matter to afcertain, as the people are at great care and 
pains to conceal it ; but by a gerieral calculation they may 
be computed at idoo or 1200. 

ProduBions — The quantity of grain produced here is 
very inconfiderable, and their farms are fo very fmall, 
that when they have paid their rents to their landlords, 
which are colleded commonly in kind, they have but a 
very fcanty fubliflence to fupport themfelves and families, 
and are often reduced to buying of meal for their families. 
The only grain they fow. is black oats and bear. The 
planting of potatoes, which of late has taken place among 
them, may in time be a great advantage. 

Rent of the Parijh. — The whole rent of this pari/h does 
not exceed L. 250 Sterling ; and as the whole pariOi was 
feued off the biftioprick in former times, and that at the 
higheft rate then paid, the whole rent paid to the proprie- 
tors muft be very fmall. There are four heritors in the 
parifli, and only one of them refiding in it. 

State of the Church, The whole of the church 

about nine years ago fell down of itfelf before the heritors 
would offer to make any reparation on it, and at laft they 
rebuilt it, and that in a ver flight manner, fo that it is 
not above half finiflied. The prefent incumbent was fet- 
tled as miniaer in April 1742 ; he was married, and had 
a very large family of children, once to the number of 22 
but are now reduced to 4 fons and 2 daughters. The fti' 
pend amounts to 92 meils of mah, and 6 barrels of greafe 
butter. The prices of thefe articles are very precarious, 

and

and at an average do not exceed betwixt L. 60 and L. 70 
Sterling, befides a fmall glebe not exceeding L. 3 rent 
yearly. The manfe is in a very ruinous condition, though 
built fince the incumbency of the prefent minifter, and 
that of the very worft materials that could poflibly be got, 
fo that now it is dangerous to walk upon the floors, as the 
whole of them are worm-eaten. 

Population. — The population in 1755 was 520 of late 
it has confiderably diminiftied. The inhabitants may now 
amount to 250. The number of burials do not exceed 3 
or 4 each year •, the births are from 6 to 8. There is no 
village in the parifli. 

Antiquities.— There are few antiquities in this parifti 
worth mentioning ; only there is a large ftone, called the 
Dwarf Stone, which meafures 32 feet in lc*igth, i6i broad, 
« feet 5 inches in height, hollowed in the infide, and di- 
vided into three different apartments •, in one end there is 
a bed, 5 feet 8 inches long, and 2 feet broad ; and in the 
other 'end a fmall room, and in the middle part an area, 
where there has been a fire-place, and a hole at the top to 
let out the fmoke. There are feveral beautiful glens among 
the hills, furrounded with very high rocks, and at the 
foot of thefe rocks a fine plain of grafs, grown level as a 
bowling-green, where there are the fineft echoes reverbe- 
rating from one rock to another every fyllable you exprefs 
for fome minutes-, there is alfo in this parifl. a profpeft of 
one of the richeft lead mines that has been known. Mr 



of Hay and Gramfay. 



fJdes the lead, he could extracl: 46 ounces of filver out of 
each toil of ore. 

Fuel. — The principal difadvantage, notvvlthftanding the 
great and high mountains we have in this parifli, is the 
fcarcity of fuel, man j df the inhabitants being obliged to 
go a great way out of the parifli among thcfe hills, to cut, 
win, and carry their peats down to the fea-fliores, where 
next they are obliged to carry them in their boats by- 
water to a very great diftance. The prefent incumbent 
has been obliged to carry his peats by water during all the 
years of his incumbency for 5 or 6 miles, which is attended 
with a great expence upon fo fmall a ftipend. 

"Prices of Provi/ions. — The prices of vivers in this parifli, 
and in the neighbourhood, has turned out fo high, even to 
triple value of moft articles more than it was at the pre- 
fent incumbent's being fettled here, owing chiefly to its 
beirig in the neighbourhood of Stromnefs, where there is a 
fine harbour, and much frequented by Clipping, fo that 
when come off a long voyage, and out of provifion, the 
fmall petty merchants in Stromnefs come over here, and 
buy up iheep, hogs, and cattle at any price, as they are 
fare to make confiderable profits by the hands of thefe 
ftrangers. 



THE PARISH OF GR^MSAY 
Is but a very fmall ifland, a mile and an half in length, 
and a mile in breadth, confifting of 35 or 36 families, in 
very Imall farms, where the cure was ufed to be ferved by 
thfeminifter of Hoy every third Sabbath ; but the fmall 
kirk or meeting-place there threatened] to fall down of it-

felf, the minlfter applied to the Prefbytery for a vifitatioit,. 
and by the oaths of fufficient workmen of each craft, got 
it declared ruinous, and it ftlU continues fo, which obliged 
the minifter to leave the place, after he had ferved 36 years 
and upwards. It is alfo cbfervable, and very Angular, 
that it pays neither ftipend, nor has any glebe. 

Population.— The population of the parllh is much the 
fame as it was 50 years ago. Its inhabitants may now a- 
mount to about i6o ; the number of burials do not exceed 
■ 3 or 4 each year ; the births about 8 or 10 yearly. There 
is no village in the ifland. 

Fuel— The principal difadvantage under which this pa- 
rifli labours, is the fcarcity of fuel. The common people 
burn turf or peat, which they are obliged to carry from 
Hoy and other places. 

5cW..-There are no fchools in either of the parillies 
of Hoy or Gr^mfay, owing to the proprietors, who cannot 
be prevailed upon to fettle a parochial fchool, and for that 
reafon, the Society for propagating Chriftian Knowledge 
have for fome years paft withdrawn their chanty fchools; 
and notwithftanding the minifter of the V^^^^ 
the commiffioners of the county to interpofe the. autho- 
which he did by petition, and under form of mftru 
Int above 30 years ago, yet to this day he never got any 
Xerance upon it; and now the minifter. bemg reduced 
by old age and infirmities, is not. in condition to go 
about fuch matters.

Situation, Extent, Sif c. 

I ""HE parifli of Weftray comprehends in it the iflands 
of Weftray and Papa Weftray ; thefe iilands are li- 
tuated towards the N. and lie in the extremity of the 
country on that fide: W eftray, the largeft:, is diftant from 
Kirkwall, the borough town, about the fpace of 20 miles. 
The lefter ifland, Papa Weftray, lying to the N. of Weft- 
ray, will be difl:ant from Kirkwall 24 miles- The ifland 
of Weftray is of an irregular form, being indented with 
bays and jutting out points of land. This ifland lies in a 
direftion from E. to W. being in length between 9 and 10 
miles Englifh ; towards the weft: end, it ftretches out into 
a confiderable breadth, being about 6 Englilh miles over 
in that part; there is likewife a ridge of hills on the 
wefliern extremity of this ifland, of a confiderable height, 

called 



Statijlical Account 



called Fitty and Gallo, ftretching from S. to N. in a line 
of between 3 and 4 miles. This ifland towards the E. and 
a little removed from Fitty and Gallo hills, is about 2 
Englifli miles over ; but about the middle fpace of the 
ifland, the breadth is fcarcely an Englifh mile over. Froni 
I guefs of the eye, there does not appear to be above i-8th 
part of the furface of tliis ifland under cultivation. 

The ifland of Papa Weftray, lies on the north fide of 
Wefliray, and is feparated from it by a found, or ferry, 
between 2 and 3 miles over. The length of this ifland is 
between 3 and 4 Englilh miles, of an oval form, and lies 
in a direftion from N. to S. being about an Englifli mile 
in breadth in moft places. This is a very fertile ifland, 
containing fome of the beft pafl:ure and arable lands in the 
whole country ; and, to appearance, there is a greater pro- 
portion of this ifland under cultivation than that of the 
ifland of Weftray. 

Agriculture, Sii'^.— Agriculture in this parifti, as well as 
in the other parts of the county of Orkney, is carried on 
in the fame way that it has been done lor many years paft. 
The fields are all open, without inclofures, neither are there 
any green crops raifed here, fuch as hay, turnip, 'iSc. ; the 
people here now begin to plant potatoes, and this they do 
to advantage, both with refpeft to produce, and the im- 
provement of the ground. There is one gentleman in the 
ifland of Weftray, who fows a confiderable quantity of 
peafe yearly, both of the white and gray kind ; the only 
produce is ftraw for his horfes, the grain feldom or ever 
comes to any perfeaion. The farmer here generally ufes 
a plough with one ftilt, much in the form of the old Ro- 
man plough. The only rotation of crops is fmall grey oats 
and bear, commonly caUed big ; the time of /owing tlie

pats is in the month of March, and fometimes they fow 
this grain in the end of February, if the feafon is favour- 
able. The only manure here" is fea-weed or ware, with 
the help of what houfe-dung they can produce. The fea- 
weed is no doubt a very rich and produdtive manure, but 
is of little ufe to the ground but for the prefent crop. 
This they lay on the fields which had produced oats the pre- 
ceding feafon, and this is done immediately after harveft, 
and during the winter, as often as the wind and tides bring 
this manure afhore. In the fpring feafon, after the oats are 
fown, the farmer gives the wared land one ploughing, 
which they call their fallow. Sometimes, when the ware 
does not come afhore in the winter feafon, it comes at the 
time of their fallow, which obliges the farmer to put it on 
the land immediately from the ftrand. This manure does 
not anfwer fo well for moft fpils as the winter ware, yet 
it generally anfwers pretty well. When the ware here is 
got in the proper feafon, it is carried up from the ftrand, 
and laid in heaps on the banks, and there it is allowed to 
lie till it acquires a conliderable degree of heat or fermen- 
tation ; this is reckoned a good preparation for this kind of 
manure, and in this way is moft produftive. There is a 
variety of foils in this parifti, and they differ very much from 
one another in the fame corner. There is a good deal of 
the land compofed of a rich black mould •, fome again con- 
fifting of black mould with a mixture of fand ; in other 
parts, clay mixed with fand ; in fome places, black mould 
mixed with peat mofs ; and finally, there is much land 
confifting of nothing but pure fand ; when plenty of good 
ware is laid on fuch foil as this, it will yield a tolerable 
crop. The ground here is generally of a free and light 
nature, and cannot bear much labourin g. The farmer gives 
the bear land one ploughing only after the fallow, at the 
Mme hp fows the feed, the foil being fo light and free, it | 

requires

requires very little of the harrow, which inftrument is gene- 
rally made with wooden teeth. In fome places, it is true, the 
better and more fubftantial farmers, and where the foil is 
ftronger, begin now to ufe the iron-teethed harrow. How- 
ever, it may be depended upon as a certain fa£l, that agri- 
culture will only be a fecondary confideration in this coun- 
try, while kelp continues to fell at any tolerable price \ and 
in this the landholders cannot be blamed, as the kelp yields 
them ready and certain profits. Many of the lands in 
Orkney, which are burdened with high fuperiorities, with- 
,out this valuable article of k^lp, would have long ago been 
in the hands of the fuperior. 

Churches, ^r.— There are three churches or places of 
worftiip in this parifh, two in the ifland of Weftray, one of 
which is called St Mary's, and the other Cro&amp; Kirk ; St 
Mary's kirk is diftant from the manfe above 4 Englifh 
miles •, the other, Crofs Kirk, is diftant 3 miles, and the 
kirk or place of worftiip in the ifland of Papa Weftray, is 
diftant from the manfe a fpace of between 8 and 9 Enghfh 
miles. The minifter preaches in thefe diiferent parts of 
worftiip by rotation, at leaft when the weather permits him 
to pafs the ferry to Papa Weftray. It muft appear pretty 
fin-ular, that all thefe places of worftiip are placed at fuch 
. dlftance from the manfe, the fpace between the manfe 
and the place of worftiip in the ifland of Papa Weftray, is a 
journey which can fcarcely be accompliflied m the fpace of 
two hours. 

This charge n,ight have been rendered more commo- 
dlous for the minifter, and centrical for the people, by re- 
ng the manfe fron its prefent fituation. But though 
Te'^ffent incumbent petitioned the 
Dofe they would not agree to any propofal of th.s kmd 
prefent incumbent could not afford to lay out money 



of Wejlray. 



in a procefs of this kind, without public aid, bj whicli- 
he has hitherto not profited ; and therefore judged it 
more eligible for himfelf to put up with his prefent fitua- 
tion, than involve himfelf in a law-fuit, which might be 
attended with an expence far above his circumftances to 
ftear. It may almofl indeed be looked upon as a problem, 
why the manfe fhould be placed at fuch a diftance from 
the places of worfhip. In anfwer to this, prior to, and 
during the incumbency of Mr William Blaw, who was or- 
dained to this charge fome time after the Revolution, there 
was one of the places of worfhip only one mile diflant from 
the manfe. But this houfe was fufFered to go to ruin in 
the time of Mr Blaw's incumbency, and was never after 
repaired or rebuilt to any of the prefent incumbent's two 
predeceflbrs. For a confiderable time there was only one 
place of worfhip in the ifland of Weftray, and this too be- 
coming ruinous in the lafl incumbent's time, the heritors 
at laft thought of building a centrical church for the whole 
ifland but however beneficial to the heritors, minifter, and 
people, this fcheme was entirely dropped, and upon this the 
heritors refolved to have two places of worfhip as formerly, 
to the great inconveniency both of the minifter and people.

This is the amount of the ftipend of Weftray, as given in 
by the prefent incumbent's predeceffor to the Court of 
Seffion, as far back as the year 1773, when he commenced 
a procefs of augmentation againft the heritors of Weftray ; 
and in the month of Auguft 1777, he obtained from the 
Court a decreet of modification, decerning and ordaining the 
ftipend of Weftray and Papa Weftray to have been for crop 
and year of God 1773, fince fyne and in time coming, 36 
miels 3 fettins of bear, 4 miels a fettins of malt, 4 i^eils

Scots, and L. 33 : 6 : 8 Scots, for furniftiing the commu- 
nion-elements. It appears, therefore, by this ftate, that the 
ftipend of Weftray, by the above decree of modification, is 
L. 778 : 13 : 4, Scots, and reckoning along with this the 
value of the glebes, and a little kelp burnt by the minifter, 
the ftipend of Weftray may be about L. 70 Sterhng com- 
mumbus annis, J3ut after all this account of ftipend, it 
muft be underftood, that there is no decreet of locality paft 
on the decreet of modification, in which cafe, all this aug- 
„,entation, which amounts to L. 19 : 3 = 9 Sterling /..r an- 
num, remains in the heritors hands, ten years of which be- 
long to the prefent incumbent, and the other ten years

Blaw, the firft fettled here after that period, there is no re- 
cord of the date of his fettlement or death. Mr Andrew 
• Cowan, fettled 27th June 1735, died 28th July 1760. Mr 
Nicol Spence, fettled 22d July 1761, died 25th April 
1783 : And Mr James Izat, fettled 15th April 1784. 

Poor — The number of poor on the roll in the iflands of 
Weftray and Papa Weftray are 60 and upwards, for the 
fupport of which the money arifing from colkaions, fines, 
^c. is by no means adequate. All the money coUefted 
in this way, good and bad, does not exceed L. 9 Sterling 
yearly, from which muft be dedufted one third part at leaft 
for bad copper, and out of the remaining fmall fum, the 
precentor and kirlc-officer are paid their refpeftive falaries 
It may be a fubjeft of enquiry then, by what means are 
luch a numerous poor fupported ? Surely, at this rate, one 
Ihould thmk that they muft be in a very deplorable condi- 
tion fhey are fupplied from the families who are in any 
kmd of tolerable circumaances. Such of the poor who are 
able to come out, go from houfe to houfe ; thofe again 
who are confined by old age, infirmity, or diftrefs of any 
kind employ fome friend, neighbour, or acquaintance, to 
alk alms for them ; but to fuch as have no body to pro 
cure any thing for them in this way. the neceffaries of life 
are fent to their own houfes. It is a confideration, in- 
deed, which ,s very n.uch to the credit and honour of this 
place, tl^at by fuch a mode the poor are tolerably provided 
for; at the fame time, it is no doubt a very cfnLer b b 
burden on the inhabitants. ""aerable

After all, the tninifter of Weftray is very fenfible, that 
if any plan could be adopted here for eflablifhing a poors 
rate, this would lay the burden of the poor more equally 
gn the inhabitants of any parifti, and more efpecially on 
tha rich landholders, who are unqueflionably obliged to 
affefs themfelves for the fupport of the poor, when the 
public funds of a parifh are infufficient for this purpofe. 

Schools, Wc—With regard to the ftate of this parifh as to 
a fchool or fchools for the education of youth, and their 
inftruaion in Chriftian knowledge, it has been in a 
very deflitute condition for many years paft. In the year 
J 792, there was a teacher firfl fent from the Society for 
Propagating Chriftian Knowledge; but he, upon obtaining 
a better place in his own country, vi% the county of Mo- 
ray left this parifh a little before Whitfunday laft. By, 
another application to the Society for the continuance of 
their bounty, there is fome profped of a fchool being again 
eftablifhed in this place, upon the fame bounty, at Whit- 
funday firfl. It mufl naturally occur to every thinking 
and well-difpofed mind, that the numerous youth in this 
^lace mufl be in a very deflitute condition for want of edu- 
cation, when they grow up to men and womens eftate_ 
..ithout being taught to read. In a lift of the number of 
fouls, which was accurately taken up in this parifh two 
• vears a^o, the number of children at ten years and under 
iriifed to 360. What is to be expeaed from children 
thus trained up in ignorance, and depnved of the mean f 
religious knowledge in their youth ? It - ^0° obvious o

bread by fifliing. It is true, thefe boats fometimes go ta 
fea for the purpofe of fifliing cod, cooths, and tibrics, which, 
are the fmall or young cooths. All the fifli the people, 
take in this way are confumed in their own families ; and 
all the fifli they can catch are but a fmall pittance for their 
fupport. Fifliing on this coaft would be a very precarious 
bufinefs ; there has fcarcejy been taken here, for years part, 
fifli of any kind. The above boats are neceffarily kept by 
the people for paffing ferries, and thereby tranfporting hi- 
ther and thither whatever the inhabitants of thefe iflands 
have occafion for.. 

Fijhery, i^c. — There is cod-fifliing, though very incon- 
fiderable, both on the fouth and north fide of We'ftray 5 
but the north fea is by far the befl: fifliing ground, where, in 
fome particular feafons, there has been both cod and ling 
tak^n, though not for years paft, in any confiderable quan- 
tities. 

Cooths are a fpecies of fifli, which in this country they 
call grey fifli.. The proper feafon for taking thefe fiflu 
commences about the middle of June, and continues till the 
month of Auguft, and fometimes longer, if the weather be 
favourable. 

The time of fifliing the young cooths or tibricks, begins 
about the middle of Auguft, and continues through the 
winter, if the feafon is favourable. 

Tliere is another fpecies of fifli caught here, called the 
dog-fifli, about the fize of a middling cod, with a large 
head ; they are but a coarfe kind of fifli ; what renders 
them valuable is, that their livers yield a goodly quantity 
of the very heft oil. The feafon for catching thefe fifli is 
the fame with that of the cooths.

Shipping, \^&amp;. — Two floops of between 70 and 80 tons 
burden belong to the ifland of Weftray. Thefe veflels for 
the moft part are employed in carrying kelp to the mar- 
ket. 

On the N. and W. of the ifland of Weftray, there is one 
good fecure harbour, called Pyrawall ; this harbour can 
admit veflels only of a fmall burden. 

Antiquities. — At the head of the bay which forms the 
harbour ftands a ftately Gothic ruin, called the caftle of 
Noltland, part of which has never been finiftied. This 
houfe is built at a fmall diftance from the fliore, and ftands 
on an eminence gently declining towards the fea. The 
face of the ground between this ruin and the fea is a beauti- 
ful green, covered with the richeft pafture in the fummer 

feafon. 

* Perhaps it may appear pretty odd that the lift of (hoemakers is fa 
Anall, and that there is no mention of coopers. The reafon is this, that 
many in the parifli can make Ihoes of a coarfer Icind, yet they do not live 
by this bufinefs; fo in like manner there arc feverals, who can work in

/eafon. There is a traditionary account here, that this 
houfe was intended as a place of retreat for Mary Queen of 
Scots and Bothwell from the then prevailing difturbances ; 
but upon Mary and Bothwell's defeat, the caftle of Nolt- 
land, and fome adjoining lands, were granted to a gentle- 
man of the name of Balfour, who put the Balfour's arms 
on this houfe. This gentleman was either a brother, or a 
near relation of a Sir James Balfour, who was Governor of 
the Caftle of Edinburgh at that time. Though this caftle 
of Noltland, and the adjoining lands, are now the property 
of another family, yet Mr John Balfour of Trenaby, the 
defcendent and reprefentative of the above proprietors of 
Noltland, has ftill a confiderable property in Weftray. 

In feveral places along the ftiores of the ifland of Weft- 
ray you meet with graves, which are certainly of a very 
Ancient date. On the north-weft fliore of this ifland, and 
not far from the houfe of Trenaby, fome of thefe graves 
were opened a few years ago, and among the afhes were 
found one or two (hort fabres or fwords. which were per- 
feftly entire as to the ihape, though much confumed with 
tuft. There was alfo found at the fame time, in one of thefe 
graves, a fmall drinking veffel, though it could not be ea- 
faly diftinguifhed of what materials it was made. When or 
how thefe bodies came to be lodged in this place, at fuch a 
diftance from the common place of interment, is not eafy 
to conjeaure. But when fpeaking of thefe things, the mi- 
nifter of Weftray muft take notice, that there are two re- 
markable graves by the fea-lhore, at half an EngHfti mile 
from the manfe. The one of thefe graves is large, the 
other of a fmall fize ; the latter, which is at fome diftance 
from the larger grave, is placed within a fmall circle of 
ftones, which is equal with the furface of the grave The 
pofitton of thefe graves is from N. to S. with four .rev 
ftones fet on edge, and placed at equal diftances from one 

another.

another, and in a crofs direftlon from the one end of the 
grave to the other. Thefe graves are certainly of very- 
great antiquity, and perfeftly agree with Offian and Fin- 
gal's defcription ; which, as above, is four grey llones 
placed on edge and acrofs the grave from head to foot, and 
at equal diftances from one another. That thefe places are 
fepulchres of the dead, there can be no doubt ; the minifter 
of Weftray faw; on this fame ground (which confifts entire- 
ly of fand) dilTerent human bones, and particularly a Ikull, 
pretty entire. 

Fuel. — There is only one peat mofs in the ifland of 
Weftray, and none other in the parifli ; this is the exclufive 
property of one heritor, who a few years ago has prohi- 
bited almoft all the inhabitants from the benefit of this 
mofs, excepting his own tenants. Neither can this necef- 
fary article be procured from any of the neighbouring 
iflands, the proprietors there being equally tenacious of 
their property, and, at the fame time, under fome appre- 
henfions of thefe raoffes wearing out, neither money nor 
jntereft can prevail with them to ferve the inhabitants of 
Weftray with an article fo much needed. This is a moft 
diftreffing confideration to a great number of the inhabi- 
tants of Weftray ; and indeed it appears limply impoffible 
for a great many of thefe to fubfift, unlefs a fupply of coal 
be henceforth imported.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q260405">GLENELG</name> 



(County of Inverness, Synod of Glenelg, and 
Presbytery of Lochcarron), 



By the Rev. Mr ConN Maciver, Minijler.</head>

<p>

Origin of the Name. 

GLENELG, the ancient and modern name, I's fuppofed 
to be made up of the Gaelic words, gkn, fignifying 
a valey, and% hunting; ox glen, a valley, and elid, a 
roe. 

Situation, Extent, and Surface.— The parifh lies in the 
County of Invernefs, Synod to which it gives its name, 
and prefbytery of Lochcarron. It is divided into three 
diflrifts : jjl, Glenelg, where the church and manfe are fi- 
tuated, the property of Colonel Macleod of Macleod ; %d, 
Knowdort, feparated from Glenelg by an arm of thL fea 
called Lochurn, the property of Macdonells of Glengarry 
and Scothoufe ; 2d, North-morror, feparated from Know- 



266- Statijlical Account 

dort by another arm of the fea, called Lochneavis, the pro- 
perty of the family of Lovat. The pariih may be fuppo- 
fed to extend from N. to S. about 10 miks, and the fame 
number of miles from E. to W. It is bounded on the 
E. and E. by the parifli of Glenfheal, county of Rofe, a 
ridge of hills making the divifion •, on the S. E. and S. by 
the out-lkirts of the countries of Glengarry and Lochaber ; 
on the S. W. by the frefh. water lake called Loch-morror,. 
this lake dividing the parifh of Ardnumorechuan from that 
Gf Glenelg ; and on the N. W. by the navigable and much 
frequented found that feparates the illand of Sky from the 
continent of Great Britain. 

In the diftrift of Glenelg there are two vallies, through 
each of which a- river runs; the inhabitants refide in fepa- 
rate villages on^ each fide of the rivers ; their arable land 
extending along the banks, and on the declivity of the 
hills; fome oT them alfo dwell on Lochurn-fide. In this 
diftrift the foil is good ; part of a deep black loam, and 
part of a fandy gravel, formerly the bed of the rivers, 
yielding crops of potatoes and oats, and the hills aiFord good 
pafture for cattle. In Knowdort the inhabitants dwell in 
■villages bordering on the fea, along the fides of Lochurn^ 
and Lochneavis ; here the foil is in general light, yielding 
crops of barley^ oats, and potatoes. The hills, though high,^ 
are moftly green to the top, and afford excellent pafiure for 
all kinds of cattle. North-morror is rocky and mountain- 
ous, moftly adapted for cattle. 

Air and fT/mfl^e.— The air is moift,.thfe rains being fre- 
..qiient, as the wind moftly blows from the S. and W. ; not- 
withitanding, the people are healthy. The conftant but 
moderate exercife, which is neceffary for herding the cat- 
V tie, and the fea-air enjoyed' during the fifliing-feafons, are 
. favourable to health. There are- at prefent in the diftrift

Seed-time and Harvejl. — The oa^s are commonly fown 
in the latter end of March and beginning of April ; imme- 
diately thereafter the potatoes are planted, and then the 
barley. The hay-harveft commences the latter end of 
July and beginning of Auguft moftly raifed from meadow 
ground ; the barley and oats are cut down in September . 
and Oftober ; but owing to the deluges of rain that too 
often fall about this feafon of the year, the Kay as well as 
other crops are often not fecured till November. Gra- 
zing feems to be the only kind of farming for which this 
country is adapted ; from neceffity, and not choice, agri- 
culture is carried on the frequent rains, together with the 
inundations of the rivers, prove fo deftruftive as to render 
the crops fometimes infipid and ufelefs but the price of 
meal, which is confiderably advanced fince the late corn- 
bill pafled in Parliament, will ftill urge them to continue 
their old method of farming with all its difadvantages, it 
being impoffible to purchafe the quantity required at fuch 
exorbitant prices. In the moft favourable fqafons, the crops, 
raifed are barely fufficient for the maintenance of their 
families during three-fourths of the year ; and in fummer, 
the fupplies from other market^' are always fcanty and 
precarious, owing tq the tedious navigation, from the eaft 
of Scotland, and the impraaibility of land-carriage over a 
hilly diftria, more than 50 computed miles in length. 

Blad Cattle and Sheep—The cows in this pariffi are of a 
good kind, well ffiaped and piled, and being feldom houfed, 
very hardy i and thofe reared, on the larger farms are per- 
haps equal to moft ftocks on the weft coaft, particular atten- 
tion being paid by the farmers in keeping handfome and 
proper bulls but they juftly complain, that the prices 
fetched are not equal to the expence and pains taken m 
rearing them : fuch cattle, when fold in parcels, give from 

L. 3, 



of Glenel^. 269 



L. 3, 10 s. to L. 4 Sterling ; and thofe fold bj the lower 
clafs of tenants fetch from two to three guineas each. The 
eftate of Scothoufe, as alfo a great part of Glengarry's pro- 
perty, together with one farm on Macleod's eftate, are 
moftly laid out in fheep-walks ; the fheep are of the black- 
faced kind, and are thought to be good, as the wedders of 
three years old, reared on two of the farms, have hitherto 
given from 15 s, to 16 s. each at an average. The white 
wool fells from 6 s. to 8 s. and the tared wool from 4 s. to 
6 s-. the ftone. The quantity fold is fuppofed to be up- 
wards of 1500 ftones, Greenock, Dumbarton, and Liver- 
pool, being the ports to which it is carried, and fome of it 
alfo difpofed of to the country people. Emigration is thought 
to be owing in a great meafure to the introduftion offlieep, 
as one man often rents a farm where foi^merly many fa- 
milies liv,ed comfortably ; and if the rage for this mode of 
farming goes on with the fame rapidity it has done for 
fome years back, it is to be apprehended emigration will 
ftill increafe. But this is not folely the caufe ; the high 
rents demanded by landlords, the increafe of population, 
and the flattering accounts received from their friends in 
America^ do alfo contribute to the evil. 

Jz;^.— Skate, ling, and cod are to be got along the coaft 
of the panft, but fythe or pollock is caught in the greateft 
abundance, which in Summer is chiefly the fupport of the 
poor people. The herring-fidiing deferves to be particu- 
larly mentioned, as in Lochurn they make their appearance 
fo early as July, and continue from that period to the mid 
die of autumn. Here the buffes from the frith of Clvde 
commonly affembleflrft, befides a vaft number of boats, whicH 
croud together from the neighbouring parifhes and ifles ad 
jacent It xs computed for fome years back 30,00a barrels 
have beeii annually caught in this loch ; but the want of

fait prevents the natives from turning to advantage this 
bounty of Providenfce, which from their locri fituation 
thej nnight otherwife do 5 at prefent, they are content with 
fiJliing a barrel or two to help the niaintenance of their fa,, 
milies. Certainly it muft be an impolitic law that impofes 
fo high a duty on one of the moft necelTary articles of con- 
lumption iu life. 

Birds, and wild Animals, — The migratory birds arc, the 
fwallpw, the cuclyoo, the field-fare, and wood-cock. Thp 
birds of prey are the eagle, the raven, and grey crow, with 
three fpecies of the hawk, and two of the kite. The game 
birds are, the tarmargan, groufe, black-cock, fnipe, heath- 
hen, with a few partridge. The aquatic birds are fuch as 
are common on the weft coaft. The deer and roe ftill fre- 
quent the hills and woods on Lochurn-Cde ; the mountain 
hare, together with the fox, the badger, and weafel, are na^ 
tives of this country; and the amphibious animals are the 
feal and otter. 

^[ides. — The tides run ■^ery ftrong, both in Lochurn and 
Lochneavis ; but the moft remarkable current in this parllli, 
or perhaps in all the weft coaft, is to be feen at Kylerea, the 
name of the found that feparates Sky from the main land ; 
at fpriug-tides it runs fo rapidly as to render it impoflible 
for any veffel to pafs through with a frefh breeze, and the 
wind never fo favourable. Mackenzie, in his cliart, rec- 
kons its velocity equal to nine notes an hour. Over this 
found the black cattle annually driven to market from Sky, 
and pare of the Long-illand are made, to fwim ; and though 
the current is fo very ftrong, yet few accidents happen. 
The number cannot be exaftly afcertained, but in general 
ibey may be reckoned about sooo. .

doch Macleod, and John Morrifon. The church is fituated

ber of fcholars that attend may be about 45. The falary 
is 300 merks Scots, paid by the Laird of Macleod and the 
tenants of his eftate ; the other diftrifts were never ceffed 
with any proportion •, the ewioluments arifmg to the fchool- 
mafter are trifling, fo that his income will not much exceed 
L. 20 Sterling. It is melancholy to think, that in every 
part of Scotland fo little attention ftiould be paid to the 
moft ufeful members of fociety. In this diftrift there is a 
fchool, folely at the expence of the inhabitants, who fen4

CharaSer of the Inhabitants. — The tackfmen of this pa- 
rilli are very refpedable, both with regard to information 
and propriety of condud, they live comfortably, and are 
hofpitable to ftrangers ; the lower clals of tenants are fober 
and ftriaiy honeft, and by no means deficient in charity to 
the poor. If a manufadure for coarfe cloths on a fmall 
fcale was eftablilhed in a village lately planned out by the 
Laird of Macleod, it could not fail of fucceeding and em- 
ploying many idle hands. The raw materials are to be 
had in die parifli, and can be conveyed by water from each 
fliepherd'3 ftorehoufe at an eafy expence. A net-manu- 
fafture might be carried on with advantage alfo j the fpin- 
ning of the hemp and twining of the yarn would employ 
the old, and the paaking of the nets promote induftry 
among the young ; very little capital would be requifite for 
both branches. In this village there arc at prefent up- 
wards of 100 fouls., 

Mifcellaneous Ohfervations,—The valued rent of the pa- 
rifli IS L. 3565 Scotch 5 the land-rent cannot be afcertained, 
but muft exceed confiderably L. 2000. As there are no 
markets for provifions, their prices cannot be exaftly 
known ; every family kill for themfelves what butcher 
meat is requifite. Men fervants maintained in the family

men from lo s. to L. i, befides ihoes, and other eafualtics. 
Wrights receive x^. per daj, and their vichjals ; a tailor is 
paid piece, befides his viftuals. The roads are bad; 
Government propofed, after the year 1745, to make a mi- 
litary road from Fort Auguftus to Barnera barracks in this 
parifh, and to build bridges over the rivers and burns, fo 
as to render it paffable for the troops and other traveller?; 
The bridges were firft erefted by contraaors, who made 
choice of thofe parts over the waters where materials could 
be had at the cheapcft rate ; by this means the roads were 
unavoidably lengthened, and carried over fteep and high 
precipices, up and down hill. This made the charge more 
troublefome and vexatious to the military who laboured at 
the roads, that in no place or part was the road made fuffi- 
cient, or of proper dimenfions, Provoft Brown of Elgin 
was employed in fummer 1793 to furvey this road, attend- 
ed by a country gentleman, well acquainted with the pro- 
per line to be followed ; and as he has given in his report, 
it is hoped Government will foon fee this neceffary mea- 
fure put in execution. As this line of road is the fhorteft 
from the metropolis to th^ ifland of Sky an,d the Long 
Ifland, and many bridges being already built, by which 
much expence might be faved, it mufl appear the more eli- 
gible to have this line continued. From its prefent fitua- 
tion it is impoffible to ride it; by this means travellers 
are neceflitated to freight velTels from Argjlefhire at au 
enormous expence. A ftage-houfe in the middle of the 
bill would be highly proper and neceflary.

As there are the remains of a Roman camp within one 
mile's diftance of the town, may not Whithern be a cor- 
ruption of Via TerticEy i. e. Legionis, •uel Cohortis ? Via

Whithern. In Britain, the V is often changed into W,

The Town defcrihed. — The town conlifts chiefly of one 
ftreet, running from N. to S. From this ftreet there are 
feveral alleys ftretching to the E. and to the W. About 
the centre of the town, there is a good hall for public meet- 
ings, adorned with a fpire and turrets, and provided with 
a fet of bells. A beautiful ftream of water, over which 
there is a good bridge, runs acrofe the main ftreet, dividing 
it nearly into two equal parts. The houfes are generally 
covered with Hates, and made very commodious.

Ancient Church, and Priory, — Ninian, who went to 
Rome in the year 370, was ordained a Biniop of the Bri- 
tons, and founded a church here in the fourth century, 
which he dedicated to St Martin *. Of this church, no! 
thing now remains but ruins, and four Gothic arches, 
which make part of the prefe.nt place of pubh'c worfliip. 
Thefe.are upon high ground, on the weft fide of the town.

of the peninfula formed, on one fide by Wigton Bay and 
Solway Frith, and on the other by Luce Bay. From the

of Galloway, the ancient Navaritum Cherfonefus and Pro- 
montorium. From N. to S. it meafures about feven miles

The face of the country is improving daily, Sot only 
by the cultivation bellowed upon the land, but by a 
paflion for planting which fliews itfelf among the land- 
holders. From the fubterraneous timbers found in aU 
the moffes, it appears, that this peninfula had been once 
well clothed with oaks, firs, l£c. It was afterwards ren- 
dered perfeaiy bare, of every tree and ihrub. 

Ptete^.— About the year 1722, William Agnew, Efq; 
late of Caftlewigg, began to plant upon his eliate, and may 
be coniidered as the fether of this important fpecies of im- 
provement in this neighbourhood. His nephew Hugh Ha- 
thorn, Ef,, foeceeded him, and planted with great fpirit 
and fuccefs ; &amp; that now, every fpecies of oak, alh, bLh 
and fir, are m great perfeffion in the foreft ; and thefe, 
wuhfmglerows, verges and clumps, have a very happj 
effea upon the appearance of the country 

The beeches upon this eftate are of a very large girth 
and great he,ght ; and the balm-of Gilead fir is'fuper

don market, and is e,ual to any fold there. Here an at'

rooms are large, confidering the time in tvhich they were 
built. This feat looks down upon a fine low country, of 
extent enough to give the beft efFeft to a grand chain of 
mountains, which are adorned by woods running along 
their bafes, and waflbed by the river Cree. It alfo has a 
view of the Bay of Wigton. The veffels moving upon 
this bay and the river now mentioned, add much to the 
beauty of the fcene. 

The garden is large, continued in the ancient ftyle to 
correfpond to the houfe, and well provided with fruit. The 
box hedges and yews are remarkable for their beauty, and 
fevcral curious plants flourifh here, particularly the tulip 
tree. 

Hugh Stewart, Efq; of Tonderghie, has built a very 
handfome houfe, which commands a view of England and 
tlie Ifle of Man. His lands being expofed to ftorms from 
the Atlantic Ocean, he has had great difficulties to con- 
tend with as a planter ; but his found judgment and per- 
fevering temper, which have enabled him to give the high- 
eft degree of improvement to his family-eftate, will fecure 
him of victory oVer thefe difficulties, or make them an 
eafy conqueft to his fon. Upon this eftate, the effeas of 
jnarl are feen to the greateft advantage. The land being 
covered with this manure, a moderate cropping takes place. 
After which it is laid down in the beft order ; and produ- 
ces the fineft and moft luxuriant pafture. 

The Earl of Galloway, and his brother the Honourable 
Admiral Stewart, are both planting in this parifli, and im- 
proving its appearance. 

-Jurnips bV.— The land here is well fuited to turnips, it 
being lharp and dry, and never expofed to fevere frofts. 
This crop, however, isfeldom ufed, though its effefts xn fat- 
tening old, and in giving bone to young cattle, are great

and evident. It is long before the tide of opinion turns in 
favour of management plainly advantageous in the higheft 
degree. The writer of this report remembers the time in 
which there was fcarcely a turnip field to be feen in North- 
umberland, Roxburghftiire, or Berwickfhire, where fuch 
fields are now fo much and fo juftly valued. The fallow 
preceding the turnip, and the turnips themfelves, being of 
fuch high confequence to a wife fyftem of agriculture, it 
cannot be doubted that the people will foon fall into the 
general ufe of this crop. Thofe who hold this reafoning 
very cheap, perhaps remember when their fathers (like 
fome people in Yorkfliire now) thought themfelves well 
employed in paring and burning their fine land. 

This praaice is everywhere reprobated in Galloway, 
where burning is never performed but in deep molTes. 
The prefent averfion to turnip and fallowing, will foon 
Ihare the fame fate. The good fenfe of the people, and 
their mcreafing attention to potato crops, perfuade me of 
this. Potato crops are valuable, but riot in the fame de- 
gree with turnip, as they do not allow fo much time for 
fallowing, and as the potato remains in the ground till the 
feed IS ripe. This laft circumftance exhaufts the foil. 

Fallows were fo much valued in the days of Virgil that 
they were fometimes continued through two feafons. '

Good dwelling-houfes, and ofEce-houfes upon farms, add 
much to the appearance, of 'a country ; and fure no fet of 
men deferve good lodgings more than farmers do. In 
this parifli thefe have improved very much within the laft 
twenty years. They are often covered with flate, and di- 
vided into convenient apartments. Sheds and ftraw- 
yards are coming into general ufe. 

^/r.-^Here the air is dry and healthy, and I never heard 
that any difeafe became epidemic. 

Courfe of Crqfs.— The land being covered with lime, 
marl, or fea-ftiells, is opened with beer (big), or oats, and 
three crops of thefe fucceed each other. With the laft is 
fown rye-grafs and clover feeds, which is cut in the fum- 
mer after the grain has been reaped. This hay-crop, as 
the rye-grafs generally prevails, is almoft as fevere upon 
the land as oats. 

Increafe and Weight of Grain. — The average increafe of 
beer, is about eight-fold, and of oats about five-fold. Bar- 
ley weighs about 52 lb. bear, 46 lb. and oats, 36 lb. avoir- 
dupois, the Winchefter bulhel. 

Coajl ; Head-lands and Bays. — The extent of coaft is 
about nine miles. The jhore near Burgh Head is bold, and 
everywhere rocky. Ax this headland a lighthoufe would 
be of the greateft ufe to the trade in thofe parts. Befide 
the headland now mentioned, there are Port-Yarrock Head 
and Stun Head ; and the bays are thofe of Port Allan, 
Port Yarrock, and Ifle of Whithorn. 

Tides. — From Port Yarrock round Burgh Head, the 
tide flows clofe along the fliore three hours, and ebbs nine. 

From

From the Rofs of Kirkcudbright tto the Mull df Gallo- 
waj, it flows and ebbs fix hours. 

Sea Fight.-^Tht only fea fight fpoken of as having ta- 
ken place near this fhore, is that of Commodore (now Ad- 
miral) EU.ot, in the jear 1760, when that brave^ and ex- 
perienced officer defeated the French fquadron under Thu- 
rot, killed Thurot himfelf, and made prizes of all his fhips. 
liie britiflx Iquadron was greatly inferior to the French in 
every thing but courage and management. The people in 
this part of the country, and the nation in general, owe 
great obligations to Admiral Elliot, who quieted their 
iears, and placed them in fafety.

together and ftuck to the rock, is more than I can account 
for after careful examination of it. 

The benevolence and zeal of the gentlemen and people in 
the neighbourhood, in comforting and aiding thefe unfor- 
tunate men, were fuch as did honour to their feelings ; and 
the piety of the late Hugh Hathorn, Efq; of Caftlewigg, 
on whofe fhore the rock was, led him to call it, the Rock 
of Providence.

Upon the eftates of Robert Hathorn Stewart, Efq; of

pearances of copper. Some time ago, a company of mi- 
r^^rs undertook to work it, upon condition, that Mr Stew-

at that time ; but furely it cannot be difcontinued long j 
and as foon as a perfon of fpirit and property knows of it, 
it will be duly attended to. An old miner examined it 
lately, and was delighted with the appearances, lamenting, 
at the fame time, his want of power to engage with it. A 
fine ftream of water runs over the ore, and on one fide it is 
waftied by the fea, fo that large veffels can come within 
100 yards of it. The Ifle of Whithorn, a fafe port, is at 
hand. From this port veffels fail to Whitehaven and 
Workington in four hours; to the Ifle of Man, in tljreej 
to Dublin, Greenock, and Liverpool in eighteen. Upon 
the lands of Tonderghie, pieces of fine copper have been 
often found. Lately, a piece of a circular form was found, 
weighing 3 ftone and 5 lb. avoirdupois ; and fix pieces in 
an earthen veffel were difcovered in the garden of one of 
his tenants.

The caftles now mentioned all look to the Ifle of Man, 
and are probably the remains of thofe places of defence, 
raifed againft the Scandinavian rovers, who ufed to make 
that ifland the place of their rendezvous, and from whence 
they ufed to annoy the Hebrides, Ireland, and Great Bri- 
tain. They not only look to the Ifle of Man, but ftand 
upon that Britifli ground neareft to it. 

The Roman camp mentioned above, fee p. 2,76, is the 
only one of that defcription in the parifh. It is much de- 
faced ; yet its remains plainly prove its origin, and that it was 
Cajira Stativa. It is upon the lands of the Honourable 
Admiral R. Stewart. 

Two urns were found on Captain Hathorn's lands, in a 
good ftate of prefervation, and are now in his cabinet, 
Oue large piece of copper, of a circular form, was alfo 
found by one of his tenants, while drefling a field, and 
brought to him. There is in the fame gentleman's cabi- 
net a natural curiofity, which, though a little out of place, 
I fliall mention here. It is a ball, which was taken out 
of a bullock's ftoraach, about the fize of an orange. This 
ball, being perforated, appears to be a concretion of hair 
which the animal had fwallowed. 

longevity.— There have been feveral inttances of longe- 
vity here, and perfons between 70 and 80 years of age 
abound. Laft year (1793) ^ man died, who was faid to 
be upwards of 100; but though there are evidences to 
Ihew that he was a very old man, there are none to fix the 

year of his birth. 

Mrs Macmillan, widow of Bailie Anthony Macmillan, 
late of this burgh, died this year (1794) in her hundredth 
year. She lived in this parifli, and near neighbourhood 
of it," all her life, and was connefted with fome of the beft 
families of the county. Her age is well authenticated. 

She

''•f She left two fons, one of them a prefent magiftrate in 
the burgh, and two daughters. Upon enquirj', 1 have 
found that Mrs Macmillan was blefl'ed with a good natural 
temper, and was always the friend of peace ; that Ihe en- 
joyed an eafy and uniform flow of fpirits, and was greatly 
elteemed by her neighbours as a perfon of the belt moral 
charadler. She was remarkable for cleanlinefs in her per- 
fon, at her table, and in her houfe ; and to the end of life 
fliewed great attention to her drefs. To all her other ac- 
complilWnts fhe added thofe of religion, the duties of 
which ihe performed with an attention and zeal, highly 
worthy of imitation. Religion appeared in her with a 
fmiling countenance, guided her honou.ably thiough the 
difierent ftages of life, and miniftered to her joy in its 
evening. Her fenfe of duty led her to induftry ; and her 
religious principles and feelings bellowed upon her con-

pleafed to beftow upon them, when they alk alms at their

Emigration, — In the year 1774, a few people emigrated 
to America. They left their native country, their rela- 
tives, and abounding means of enjoyment, to fettle in 
woods, among favages and wild beafts. Many of tliefe de- 
luded creatures were rich, and left very profitable leafes, to 
bemoan their folly in uncultivated deferts. 

Produce.— Th{s parifh has grain enough for its inhabi- 
tants, and alfo much for exportation. In 1782-3 it enjoyed 
its ufual plenty.

Manures.— In many places there are very large pits of 
fine marl ; and fea-fhell may be procured in any quantity 
at a low price. 

Advantages for 'Trade. — The advantages of this neigh- 
bourhood for trade are obvious. Its grain, and herds of 
black cattle; its flocks of ftieep, with fine wool ; its rivu- 
lets, and water-carriage to the beft markets, all point it out 
as the feat of commerce. 

Repeal of Coal-tax. — The goodnefs and wifdom of Go- 
vernment have removed one great obftru6lion to the trade 
of this country, by taking the duty off coals borne coaft- 
ways. For this, men of all ranks feel grateful to Parlia- 
ment ; and becaufe of it, Mr Dundas will .be remembered 
with applaufe for ages to come. 

Salt Laws. — The falt-laws have a moft unfriendly opera- 
tion upon this parifh and neighbourhood ; and need only 
to be read to be condemned by every wife and patriotic 
llatefman. » 

In Chelhire there is a ftratum of rock fait, upwards of 
50 feet in thicknefs, and fait, fprings, appearing every 
where in that county, flrew it to be amply provided with 
that valuable article. Were this treafure open to all his 
Majefty's fubjedls equally, either without any tax, or upon 
a moderate one, the greateft advantages would arife to 
trade in general, and in particular to the exportation of 
falted provifions. But it is locked up from the community 
at large by feveral ftatutes, which feem to have proceeded 
from partial views, and a Ihort-fighted p,olicy. Thefe ftatutes 
forbid the refining of rock fait into white fait in any but a 
few places therein fpecified. All England, excepting thefe

perpetual by 3d Geo. I. c. 7. but is not exaded. No man 
of enlarged views will grudge the Irifli this advantage. 
Let them enjoy it, only let us enjoy it along with them., 

Rock fait refined, and made into white fait, is eight 
times as ftrong as that made in the frith of Forth; and at 
Liverpool the former is fold, the beft at 8 d. and fmall at 
5 d. buihel, exclufive of duties; while that made in 
the frith of Forth is fold at 1 s. 3 d. Here is a temptation 
to fmuggling, which cannot be refifted ; and this ruinous 
contraband trade flourifhes in the weft of England and 
Scotland. 

Were the duty on fait 'taken ofi^, and Scotland put upon 
the fame footing with Ireland, the great wafte of beef and 
tallo^y, proceeding from driving our cattle to the Englifli

of lofmg that provifion. I think 1 hear fome felf-conceited . 
perfon cry out. Why don't they fend to a licenced cellar or 
warehoufe, and get fait in a legal way ? Why, I tell thee, 
thou wifeacre, that in thefe places there is little other than 
fmuggled fait. Wifdom calls for a review of the fait laws ; 
and juftice and impartiality require at leaft their equaliza- 
tion. 

Were the duty on fait taken off it, and laid upon Bri- 
tilh fpirits, much good would arife from the commutation 
to the public. It would tend to foberife the people, and 
to lead them to the ufe of malt liquor. At prefent, there 
is little malt liquor fold in this country. 

The duty on Englifti fait is 5 s. per bufhel, weighing 
561b.; but I never heard of i s. of duty being received, it 
being all fmuggled. Make the duty lower, and it will be 
paid. 

Harhour at IJle of Whithorn, i^c. — At Ifle of Whithorn 
there is a good natural harbour, improved by a quay. It 
is narrow at the entrance, but very fafe for veflels when 
in. Eight or nine fmall floops belong to this place, in 
which about 30 mariners are employed. They bring coal 
and lime from England j carry fea-fliells from the river 
Cree, and take away the grain, potatoes, with fome fat 
cattle, flieep, and fwine to the different markets. Here is 
ftationed one of his Majefty's revenue cutters. 

Farms. — The average rent of land is 12 s. 6 d. per acre. 
Farms are from L. 30 to L. 300 per annum, and houfes are 
let at L. 14, and downwards. 

Schools. — There are three fchools, one of which- is efta- 
bliflied by law ; the mafter enjoys a falary of L. 9.

Inns, y..^Here are 4 inns, and la ale, or rather whiikr 
houfes. Such houfes are much too numerous in this coun- 
try. and the morals of the people are greatly injured by 
them. They retail a bafe fpirit, fo low. as to price, that 
fixpenny worth of it is enough to make any man mad. 

^///.—There are 5 corn mills in the parilh, 4 of which 
go by water, and one is driven by the wind. 

Cottasers.^The eiFeds of employing cottagers upon 
farms are very friendly to population. Their children arc 
a ftout and a healthy race. 

Tmrning, Tanning of leather has been carried on 

for feveral years to a confiderable extent. The tanner fees 
our own cattle driven to England, and then fets off for 
Ireland to buy raw hides.— Several cotton manufadures 
have commenced. 

Stillatory.—nexe alfo is a ftillatory, which pays to the 
revenue L. 729 per annum, befides malt-duty. 

State of the Country before the Union. — Before the Union 
of the two kingdoms, this parilh had nothing to trade with 
but black cattle, and a fmall quantity of bear or big. The 
laft of thefe laft articles they fent to Map for brandy. 
Agriculture was then fo little regarded, that landholders 
were often obliged to lend oxen, and horfes, and feecJ-corn 
to their farmers. 



Heritors. — The heritors of this parilh are, the Right 
Honourable the Earl of Galloway, 'iJc. is'c. i^c. John 
Hathorn, Efq; of Caftlewigg ; James Murray, Efq; of 
Broughton ; Robert Hathorn Stewart, Efq; of Phifgill ; 
^ Hugh 



of Whithorn.

Hugh Stewart, Efq-, of Tonderghie ; the Honourable Ad- 
miral Keith Stewart ; the Honourable Sir Stair Agnew, 
Baronet, of Lochnaw-caftle.i 

Crofters, — Belides the above, there are five fmall land- 
holders, called crofters in this part of the country. There 
has been a great change of property in this parilh within 
this century J as I am informed, there were 22 confider- 
able landholders in the country part of the parifli, befides 
eight crofters in the town. 

John Hathorn, Efq; of Caftlewigg, and Hugh Stewart, 
Efq; of Tonderghie, are the refiding heritors. 

The fmall proprietors are, Bailie Donar, Mr Macgoan, 
Mr Anthony Macguffock, Mr John Sorry, Mr Charles 
Broadfoot. . All thefe live in the town excepting Mr Mac- 
goan. 

Labour and Provifons, is'c. — Of late years the prices of 
labour and of provifions have become very high. This 
has been accompanied by a great change in the way of li- 
ving among all ranks of people. 

About 60 years ago, there were no clocks, watches, or 
tea-kettles, but among people of fortune, or fome of the 
minifters. In farmers houfes there were no windows of 
glafs. The light was admitted through openings on each 
fide of the houfe, and that in the windward fide was filled 
with ftraw in blowing weather. 

Clothing. — The modes of clothing and living were in 
proportion, and confifted of the pooreft fare and coarfeft 
apparel : Now they live as well as any in Great Britain of 
their rank. The men are clothed, fometimes with home- 
fpun, but more commonly with YorkOiire narrows, cotton 
velvets, and corderoys. The women appear in printed 
linens, cottons and muflins. Here I fpeak of men and 

women

women of the loweft ranks in lifej fervants, cottagers, and 
mechanics. 

Clocks — Ahnoft every houfe has a feven-day clock j and 
watches are near as common as breeches. 

Progrefsjnce the Umon.— Before the Union of the two 
kingdoms, the glorious era of Britain's peace and profpe- 
rity, there was not a floop, Hiip, or veffel of any kind to 
go to fea in, in this neighbourhood ; but now we fee their 
canvas fpread all round the coaft, and importing from the 
Weft Indies, and the different countries in Europe, every 
thing tending to ufe, to ornament, or luxury. 

Wealth. — The trade and improvements in agriculture 
have introduced wealth among the people ; real wealth, 
proceeding from growing Ikill and increafing induftry. 
This wealth has funk the value of money, in a proportion 
almoft incredible, as will appear from the following tables, 
fhewing the ancient and prefent prices of provifions and 
labour. By ancient, I mean no more than about 60 years

Every thing elfe is in proportion with thofe ^entered in., 
'the above tables. To thefe things the change in the way 
of living is to be added. Tables are conduced in a diffe- 
rent ftyle; and ale has given place to punch, and punch to 
wine. 

When the particulars ftated are duly attended to, Mr 
Keith's conclufion from fimilar premiffes appears reafonable. 
" Upon the whole matter," fays he, " this much feems to 
" be certain, that for all domeftic ufes L. 100 at the time 
" we are now fpeaking of," a7in. 1563, " was, at a mode- 
" rate computation, as valuable in all points as L. 700 are 

" now a-days." N. JB. Keith wrote, I think, before 

the year 1740 *, 

EffeBs of the Decreafe of the Value of "Money upon ihe 
Minijiers of Religion. — This great change in the value of 
money has ruined many who were dependent on falaries 
fixed 80 or an lOO years ago j and unlefs relief is given, 
many more muft fuffer the fame hard fate. No fet of 
men feel this change more than the minifters of this Na- 
tional Church, who are generally paid, not in kind, but in 
money. When their ftipends were firft appointed, L. 60, 
according to a fafe calculation, was equal to L. 180 now. 

The progrefs of fociety calls aloud. Confine not the mi- 
nifters of religion to their ancient appointments. Why ? 
fay the needy, the greedy, and the gracelefs, Is not a poor 
church moft like to be a pure church ? Thofe men who 
iiave hackneyed this faying allow, when their intereft is 
out of the way, that poverty is often as great an enemy to ^ 
Virtue as wealth. We plead not for overgrown wealth. 
We only humbly crave, that our income may rife as the 
neceflary expence of living increafes.

^ That the poverty of the minifters of religion is not only 
injurious to them, but alfo to the peace and order of fo- 
ciety, will be allowed by every perfon who thiiiks a Na- 
tional Church of any ufe. He who is in eafy circumftan- 
ces will be forward in afts of goodnefs, and Ihew a pattern 
of that charity which he recommends. He will difFufe a 
fpirit of contentment; joy, and induftry, every where about 
him. In him the Church will find an enlightened friend, 
and the State a prudent, firm champion. When he goes 
about the facred duties of religion, he commands refpeft by 
the mtegrity and benevolence of his life, which gives 
weight to all he fays. He, on the contrary, who lives on 
L. 75 or L. 80 per annum in a parifti where there are many 
tithes, is in danger of becoming fallen and indifferent to a 
Government where he fufFers fo much injuftice.

It might mean the patron faint. Thus, pronounceti

Bullet* renders Bothwell,,"' a caftle upon an eminence j''" 
from Both, which he interprets " eminence," and wall, in 
compofition well, " a caftle," 

The firft fenfe feems to fuit the lituation of the caftle, the 
town, and the parifh : For the Clyde encircles a great part 
of the caftle f , paffes near to the town or village ; in a 
flood, covers the low ground befide the hill on which it 
(lands ; while the two Calders almoft^furround the reft: 

Situation arid Extent. — Bothwell was a great, noble and 
ancient barony, extending from Clyde to Weft Lothian. 
It is fituated in the nether ward of the county of Lanark, 
in the preft)ytery of Hamilton, and Synod of Glafgow 
and Ayr : bounded upon the S. by the Clyde, and part of 
South Calder ; on the W. and N. by North Calder ; on 
the E. by the Shotts. It is of an oval figure, extending 
from W. to E. broadeft toward the middle, and contrafted 
at both ends ; about eight miles-and a half in lengthy and 
four at the greateft breadth. 

The great road from Glafgow to Edinburgh goes through 
the whole length of the parifli, ^nd divides it nearly into 
two equal halves ; enters it at the weft point, by a bridge 
over the Calder, about a quarter of a mile north from 
where it joins the Clyde, and miles from Glafgow. Af- 
ter a very fteep afcent, which is foon to be levelled, it goes 
along upon a flat of 4 or 5 miles, and then afcends confider- 
ably towards the eaft, as it approaches the high lands of

the Shotts. The ground to the fouth of the road gradual- 
ly declines toward the river, which gives a fine profpeft of 
the Clyde, Hamilton, and the adjacent country. 

The great flat of the upper part of the parifli is, at a 
medium, 300 feet above the level of the fea ; that toward 
the Clyde is greatly lower. 

The church and village of Bothwell is 361- miles from 
Edinburgh, per feftion from the great road leading to the 
village i 8 from Glafgow ; 27 from Stirling ; 17 from La- 
nark. 

The diftance from neighbouring pari&amp;es, (bearing and 
diftance from the church), are thefe : Hamilton, fouth- 
eaft,. feparated by the Clyde, 3 miles diftance. Blantyre, 
upon the fouth, feparated alfo by the Clyde ; diftance, 3 
miles* North -weft is Old Monkland, feparated by North 
Calder ; diftance, 3 miles. Upon the north, New or Eaft:

Upon the north-eaft, the Shotts, diftance 8 miles. Cam^ 
bufnethan E. N. E. feparated by South Calder, diftance S 
miles. Upon the eaft, Dalziel, at 3 miles diftance, fepa- 
rated by the South Calder. 

Surface and Soil. — The parifli rifes gradually from the 
Clyde to the north, and ftill more to the north-eaft. Upoa 
the banks of the river, fouth from the church, a large flat 
fucceeds ; at the termination of which, an afcent takes placft 
toward the middle, or the line of the turnpike, twhere it' 
refts in another large level, extending almoft the wholq 
length of the parifli, but rifmg in fome places toward the^ 
north, and very confiderably to the eaft. 

There can fcarcely be faid to be either mofs, moor or 
morafs in the parifli. If there are fome fpots of the two 
M, they are fo finall as not to deferve confideration. la 
general, all is arable.

The foil IS chiefly clay, of various mixture, loam, fari^ 
and nil, and ome of a lighter mould. It is good toward 
the Clyde, where there is more warmth and Ihelter; and 
there is a great deal of excellent ground in the parifh. 

Placed in fo fine an expofure to the fouth, occupying fo 
large a fpace, and fo commanding a view of one of the 
fineft countries in Scotland, the fituation is from thefe cir- 
cumftances very beautiflil, and peculiarly adapted to the 
purpofes of cultivation. 

Air and Climate.- The air is good, and the climate 
healthful. A ridge of high hills, about ten miles north, 
carry off the clouds and vapour, that may be raifed from 
the Atlantic, or otherwife. A long ftretch of high ground 
does the fame fervice on the fouth ; and the parilh,. on ac- 
count of its feparate ftate, happily remains unaffefted, 
while the ftorm is driving along both. The chief incon- 
venience arifes from the clay foil tenacioufly keeping up- 
on the furface the rain that falls in winter. But the de- 
cliniEg pofition of the parifli, the good roads and ditches, 
ferve as drains, and prevent any feniible bad effefts upon 
the health of the people. Their houfes are placed upon a 
dry fituation, and well covered. There is no difeafe pecu- 
liar to the parifh. When the fmall-pox enter a 
from their clofe connexion and mode of frequent vifiting 
each mother in diftrefs, the infedlion becomes general, but 
feldcim fatal. The air at, the eaft end is fharper, the ground 
confi derably higher, and the fnow lies longer. 

M; tny arrive at old age ; yet the employment of the huf- 
baud Bian is not the moft favourable for a very advanced 
life. Engaged in inceffant toils, driven often from the ex- 
trem: ty of heat to cold, expofed to all the inclemencies of 
the el ements ; thefe wear out the beft conftitutions ; and

Wood and Planting.'^ — The woods are chiefly befide the

there is a good deal of coppice, and feveral large planta- 
tions. Some of fir, planted many years fince, had arrived 
to a confide r able fize, and were lately fold to a good ac-

Many plots and ftrips were made lately, and promife well. 
♦ One of the fineft places in the parifli d.erives its name * 
from the extenfive woods and plantations about it. 

The woody banks of the Clyde and Calders, are fre- 
quented by the ufual tenants of the groves of Caledonia,' 
particularly the thrufli and blackbird. The village and

with the mufic of thefe two melodious birds, efpecially the

Ecclejiajiical State. — The Duke of Hamilton is patren. 
The ftipend received no alteration fince 1650 till 1781, 
though the rental of the parifli was much more than dou- 
bled in that time. It is now 6 chalders and i boll of meal, 
I chalder of bear, and L.46, 18 s. in money. 

The -church was repaired about 16 years fince ; the

The glebe confifts of above 4 acres arable j but is defi- 
cient of the legal quantum for pafture. 

The 



of Bothwell. 



The incumbent has expended confiderably upon the 
manfe and garden, and has lately planted an orchard of a 
choice colledHon of fruit-trees, which he hopes will yield 
a benefit to his fuccelTors of L. 30 annually. 

It is to be wifhed that fome general plan was adopted, to 
put and Jkeep manfes and glebes in proper order Intrants 
often find all in ruins. Compofed of , the mod fuperficial 
materials, and given to the lovveft undertaker, they need 
patching every 12 years ; whereas, if manfes were made 
good and fubltantial at firft, they might laft with little 
charge for 80 or roo years, and would be a great faving to 
the landed intereft. 

A houfe of the Relief perfuafion was built in the year 
1763, The congregation is fupplied from this, and five; 
neighbouring pariflies.

that fo the parifli might be furnifhed with a man properly 
accomplifhed for that important truft. But this mofl; equi- 
table meafure was defeated. A party of portioners, and 
other heritors, eleded one, to whofe qualifications ftrong

Poor—The poor are fupplied from an affeffment, fixed 
by a meeting of heritors and church-fefTion, who meet once 
in the fix months, examine the poors roll, and appoint fuch 
a fum to be levied for the enfuing half year, as the ftate of 
the poor requires. The landed property pay the one 
half, and the houfeholders the other. As the parifli is af- 
fefled, the Sunday collections are fmall ; and are applied 
to keep the poor rates in moderation, to aid fuch as have a 
fmall allowance, and to keep others off it, by giving them 
incidental charity. At an average, there are about 25 up- 
on the roll ; and the fum alotted for the current year, is 
L. 73 : 18 : 8 Sterling. 

By the mode of Sundays colleftions in Scotland, the^ 
poor are in general fupported by the poorer part of focie- 
ty ; but a legal aflelTment fecures the contribution of all ranks 
in the parifh, fedlarifts, and efpecially the opulent proprie- 
tors, whether refident or not.^ Its increafe, however, ought 
to be jealoufly watched, and as much as pofTible prevented. 
The following regulations may be of ufe. » 

To prevent any from fettling in the parifli, whofe cir- 
cumllances may fbon, or immediately, need fupply; or 
to have an obligation from the pariihes whence they come, 
that they fhall fupport them. — Not to raife the ftent upon 
every exigency, but to make a colleftioa among the heri- 
tors, or at the church, for that purpofe. — Never to flackea 
the hand of induftry, by giving too early, or too much 
for this would render it a nurfery of floth and idlenefs. 
A little exercife cheers even the languor of age, and fvveet- 
• ens both the cup and the relt of the labouring man. The 
real circumftances of every poor perfon fhould be precife- 
ly known, as reprefentations may be biafled by favour or 
influence ; that when application is made, every proper ob- 
ject may have the necefl'ary relief, and no part of the pu- 
blic charity ftiall be mifapplicd. — To admit no perfon upon

the roll, unlefs an intimation thereof is lodged with the 
church-feffion fix weeks before the meeting, that the feffion 
may inquire into the ftate of the cafe, and report the fame 
to the meeting. 

By fuch provifions as thefe, the much dreaded evil of 
poor-rates in this country, may be prevented, and an ef- 
feftual fupport for the poor fecured ; vagrant begging fup- 
prefled, and their children educated in knowledge and vir- 
tue. 

Rent and Inclofures. — The old valuation of the parifh 
is L. 7389 : 16 : o/r Scots. 

In 1650, the rental of the parifli was L. 1950 : 18 : 5^ 
Sterling. In 1782, L. 4431 : 7 : 4 Sterling. But the real 
annual value cannot be well afcertained, as a good deal of 
the beft is in the hands of proprietors and portioners. It 
may amount to between L. 5000 and L. 6000 Sterling. 

The croft acres round the two principal villages, are 
eftimated at L. a yearly. The outfield is from 10 s. to 
L. I. 

The land is not let by the acre, but at the Jlump of the 
farm, and the accumulated value eftimated. 

The farms are generally fmall, which is one great caufe 
of the increafe of population. In this refped, fmall farms 
are public benefits ; but large farms, ,held by wealthy far- 
mers, tend more elFedhially to advance ihe value of the 
ground. 

They are commonly from L. 30 to L. 70. Seven about 
L. ICO, and one or two batween L. 100 and L. aoo. 

The rent of farms has been confiderabl;' increafed with- 
in thefe 20 years, fome more than doubled. 

There are a great many inclofures in the parifli, confift- 
ing chiefly of thorns. Thefe around the gentlemens feats

are generally in good order ; but fuch as are in the hands 
of tenants, are imperfea. 

The Hope hedge, inftead of being planted upon the top, 
is very unfavourable ; excludes fun, rain and dew, from 
the root of the plant ; and the breaches of youth continue 
through age. The nurfing a young hedge requires a good 
deal of attention; a farmer of fmall extent grudges the 
charge. It would be for the intereft of the proprietor to 
make fome allowance, or to divide the expence of rearing the 
hedges for 7 or 8 years, till they are eftabliHied ; the far- 
irier being bound to niaintain them during his leafe.

Roads and Bridges.— -The pariOi is well appointed 
roads. The great road from Glafgow to Edinburgh, goes 
through the whole length of the parifh, as has been alrea- 
dy noticed. The road from Glafgow to Carlifle enters the 
pariih on the weft, a litple to the fouth of the Edinburgh 
road, by a bridge over' the Calder very near to Clyde, 
goes along the pleafant banks of the river, paffeth through 
the village at the church, and croffes the Clyde at Both- 
well bridge. The mail coach goes the fame courfe twice

There are feveral feftions from the Edinburgh road,

and is propofed to be rebuilt upon a larger plan, which 
will be a great improvement to this part of the country. 
There are two bridges over North Calder, on the weft cor- 
ner, where the Edinburgh and Carlifle roads enter the pa- 
rifli, and other two over the fame water, on the roads to 
Airdrie. Three are upon the South Calder •, one of them

Price of Labour and Provijtons. — The price of labour 
here, as in the neighbourhood of Glafgow, has been within 
thefe feven years confiderably advanced. A principal 
ploughman, or man-fervant, is from L. 10 to L. 12, with 
his board ; a young man, next to him, who drives the 
plough, and works with him, is from L. 5 to L, 8 ; a maid- 
fervant in the houfe, from L. 3 to L, 4 orL. 5 ; a common 
day labourer, formerly lod. or is. is now is. 4 d. ; in 
hay-time, i s. 8 d. or 2 s. j the women 8.d. ; a houfe-car- 
penter i s. 6 d. or i s. 8 d. ; a mafon 1 s. 8 d. and i s; 10 d. ; 
a tailor i s. with board. 

The advance of wages is feverely felt by the fmall far- 
mer. But his aaing the principal part himfelf, till his 
children grow up to affift him, is a confiderable faving. 

Hamilton being fo near is reforted to for butcher-meat. 
Glafgow regulates the price of grain. The produce of the 
dairy is generally carried there ; and poultry is often dear- 
er here than at that town, being carried thither in hopes of 
a higher price.

received a confiderable improvement within thefe 20 years. 
The outfield was frequently ploughed, but -the crop not 
worth the labour; now every pendicle is attended to, and 
exhibits, when the feafon is favourable, tolerable good 
culture. It is not long fmce they difcovered the happy 
efFefts of lime on the ftrong clay. It is now very gene- 
rally ufed ; and when judicioufly applied, produces very 
good crops. It is brought from the lime-works in burnt 
fliells, and laid on at the proportion of from 50 to 100 bolls 
per acre. To do the field juftice, it will take 100 bolls to 
each acre. The boll is 7 d. at the kiln, and confifts of the 
wheat firlot, or Winchefter buftiel. They have flridlly no 
regular rotation. The ufual one is fummer-fallow, with 
lime and dung ; firll year wheat ; 2d peafe ; 3d oats, fown 
with grafs, cut one year or two, and paftured as many ; or, 
inftead of oats, the 3d year barley, prepared with frequent 
ploughing and dung, and laid down with grafs-feeds, which 
is a courfe more favourable to the ground. 

As it is but a fmall part of the farm that a fufBcient 
quantity of dung can be procured to prepare for wheat, 
other parts are limed on the pafture, two or three crops 
taken, and laid down in grafs ; a green crop generally fuc- 
ceeding oats. 

The introdudion of wheat has been attended with one 
good circumflance, the cultivating, or bringing in, as it 
may well be termed, of that poor ejected alien, the outfield ; 
for the fummer fallow is frequently applied there, and 
being furnilhed with lime and dung, a pretty good crop of 
wheat is produced, with one of peafe, and another of oats. 
By repeated applications of this nature to the outfield, it 
has made very grateful returns, producing a crop of wheat 
from 7 to 10 bolls an acre, with two more proportionably 
fertile. . 

By 



of Bothwell, 



By this attention to the outfield, it is obferved, that the 
croft has failed for fome years of the great crops it ufed to 
produce, owing to the farmer carrying all the dung and 
manure he can procure to his wheat-land, as he chiefly de- 
pends upon that crop for his rent. 

Barley, for the fame reafpn, is now lefs cultivated, as it 
■interferes with the manure of the wheat ; and, on account 
of the binding quality of the clay, it will not grow, unlefs 
it be cheriftied with refrefhing Ihowers foon after it is fown -y 
for this caufe, it is judged a precarious crop. 

Beans, mixed with peafe, ufed to be raifed from the 
croft ground in great abundance. But in bad harvefts, it 
is extremely difficult to get them timely dried and ilacked, 
without which they are in a great meafure loft. So that 
wheat, oats, and hay, are likely to be cultivated as the 
fureft crops. 

Potatoes are planted by every farmer, but chiefly for 
private ufe. Tradefmen depend much upon that valuable 
root. The hard foil is not fo favourable as a tender and 
quick foil for that crop. ' 

The clay is equally unfriendly to flax ; and no more of 
it is fawn than is neceflary for the ufe of each family. 

They fow in March, or as foon as the feafon. will per- 
mit, and the foil is fo dry as to admit them to go Upon the 
fields. 

Their harveft is earlier than fome of their neighbours \ 
efpecially that part of the parifli which lies toward Clyde. 

After all the manure that can be applied, the goodnels 
of crops in this parifii depends particularly upon the feafon. 
From its declining attitude to the fouth, but efpecially from 
the ftifFaefs of the clay, it needs frequent Ihowers, flrft in 
the fpring, to bring the grain equally through the hard 
foil ; and then a regular fucceffion of ftiowers to dilfolve 
the clay, elfe it forms an impenetrable cement, excluding 

all 



3 ^ ^ S tatijlical Account 

all dew and moifture from the root of the plant. But wlien 
the ground is in pretty good order, and is favoured with 
frequent rains, it never fails to produce excellent crops. 
This IS fo remarkable, that the crop about the village of 
Bothwell is looked to bj the inhabitants of the moorilh 
part of the country as the index of the feafon ; and when 
It is very luxuriant, they confider it as a certain fignal that 
a greater quantity of rain Jias fallen, than fuits their fitua- 
tion. 

As a proof of what returns the beft foil will yield, thefe 
are attefted by credible authors, who both fowed and reaped 
the field. In fome places the crop has amounted to 15 
bolls of ozts per acre ; one acre of the glebe produced, 30 
years fmce, 18 bolls of beans ; and one in the holms yield- 
ed above 20 boUs of wheat, or 80 Winchefter bufliels. 
They were doubtlefs in high cultivation. 

The grain is of a fuperior quality. The converfion at 
the mill is little ftiort of meal for oats. It is purchafed for 
feed by other parts of the country. The Scots plough, 
upon a lighter plan, with three horfes, is generally ufed. 

There is excellent butter and cheefe made in the parifli ; 
but the dairy is not carried to any great extent, owing to 
the fmall farms, and the little portion allotted for paftiire, 
they depending chiefly upon the arable crops for their 
profits. 

The number of milk-cows are in proportion to the fize 
of the farm, and will be from 6 to 12, or 14. They rear 
their black cattle and fome horfes, both of which are ge- 
nerally of a good breed. 

It is expefled, that here, and in other parts of the coun- 
try, a more favourable rotation will take place. In Read 
of that ruinous practice of conftant ploughing and fcourging 
the foil, equally impoverifliing the tenant and the farm, 
more will be allowed to grafs, and lefs ploughed. The

exceffive rate of labour and wages, and the advanced price 
of hay and grafs, it is hoped will produce this moft de.' 
lirable improvement. 

This parifh poffeffes peculiar advantages for improve- 
ments, in the ftrong fertile- nature of its foil ; in the happy 
fituation of its farms and fields ; in its vicinity to Glafgow, 
Hamilton and Airdrie ; in the ftore of coal ; in every 
eftate being watered by the Calders, or the Clyde, and 
adapted to the purpofes of machinei'ies and manufadlures ; 
and in the high degree of cultivation it has already attained. 
Upon thefe accounts, landed property here is of a fuperior 
value ; and when agriculture fliall be profecuted with 
greater vigour, this parilh mufl: ftiU hold the very firft place

parries and Minerals. — The parifh abounds in free- 
ftone. The quarries toward Clyde are of a red colour, 
fome of a fmooth furface, and very durable. In the upper . 
part of the parilh are feveral free quarries, of a beautiful 
white ; and the houfes of the new villages are all neat, and 
well built. 

There is an excellent going coal in Woodhall-lands, 
The price at the pit is 2 s. 9 d. Sterling per ton. The 
lands of Stevenfton, Olelano, and Jervifton, have alfo coal. 
The price was lately confiderably advanced, but is again 
fomewhat reduced. The chief confumption is in the pa- 
rifh and neighbourhood. ,

^ In general, the farmers are an induftrious, fober, and 
virtuous people ; regular in their attendance npon public 
worfhip ; juft, charitable, ■and humane ; conftantly engaged 
in the culture of their fields, they are happily removed 
from the arts of circumvention to acq^uire wealth; orthofe 
of diflipation to obtain licentious pleafure. 

The firft day of the new year is their only holiday, 
which they fpcnd in friendly vifits and mutual congratu- 
lations. Curling is their chief amufement in winter. 
Their weddings are celebrated with a decent cheerfulnefs. 
After partaking of a plentiful entertainment, the evening 
is fpent in feftive mirth and the fecial dance. 

Rivers.-— The only river is the Clyde, which waters the 
parilh along the fouth fide, in a gentle declivity, with beau- 
tiful windings, and here and there fliallows, for the fpace of 
three or four miles. It is ftored with trout and falmon, 
which are taken with the rod or net. At the end of har- 
veft, and fometimes in winter, it overflows the holms or 
low grounds; but the experience they have had warns 
them timely to remove the crop out of danger. 

The water of North Culder rifes from the Black Loch 
in the parifli of Eaft Monkland, and continues its courfe 
weftward for about 15 miles, till it falls into Clyde, at the 
bridge above mentioned ; and for 7 or 8 miles feparates 
the parifh from the Eaft and Weft Monklands.

The water of South Calder rifes from feverai marfhes 
and fens in the parifhes of Shotts and Cannibufnethan, and 
having continued its courfe for 15 miles, fails into the 
Clyde a little below Orbiefton. 

They are generally {hallow in fummer; but in wintet 
and rainy feafons, they pour a great quantity of water into 
Clyde. 

The ftream of the North Calder is confiderably leflened 
by the water being taken into the Monkland Canal at 
Woodhall. 

Thefe two waters are chiefly diftingui/bed for the reman* 
tic fcenery of their banks; upon which account, all the 
gentlemen who live in that part of the country, have pla- 
ced their feats upon the banks of the one or other of thefe 
two C alders.

uaries : 

Two fons of the Rev. Mr William Hamilton, Meflrs 
Robert and Thomas, fucceeded each other as Profeflbrs of 
Anatomy in the College of Glafgow. 

The laft was fucceeded by his only fon, Mr William 
Hamilton ; a young gentleman, who, by his diftinguiflied 
abilities, and indefatigable application, foon acquired a very 
high degree of fame in his profeffion. He died in early 
life ; his lofs was deeply ^felt, and univerfally regretted. His 
feehng heart, and gentlenefs of manners; his endearing 
fympathy with the dittreffed, almoft foothing away pain ; 
his r;ire and amiable virtues, will long live in the memory 
of his friends, and in a very ext^nfive circle of fociety.

In this lift muft be included the late Daniel CampbeH, 
Efq; of Shawfield, brother to the prefent proprietor. 

He was one of the mcft accomplifhed gentlemen his 
country has produced. Nature was liberal to him of her 
choiceft gifts : Tafte and elegance feemed natural to him : 
He poflefled the graces in perfedion : The fine arts were 
his favourite amufements. He fat in two Parliaments, and 
gave fuch proofs as declared him qualified to have made an 
eminent figure in the Britifli Senate. Above all, the in- 
effable fweetnefs, the flowing fenfibilities of his heart, en- 
hanced every accompliftiment, gave a charming luftre to 
the whole man, and rendered him at once admired and be- 
loved by all who knew him. 

To thefe may well be added Mr William Aiton, author 
of Hortus Kewenjis, 3 vols. He was a native of this parifli, 
educated under the friendly ftiade of the laft gentleman's 
family. He went to England in 1754. In 1759 he was 
pointed out to the Princefs Dowager of Wales and his pre- 
fent Majefty, as a man beft qualified to form a botanical 
garden at Kew. Under their encouragement, he ftudied 
and laboured for 34 years, coUefting from every corner of 
Britain, and the remoteft climes, every rare and valuable 
produftion of the vegetable creation. 

How far he fucceeded in a taflc fo arduous and laudable, 
the prefent highly finifhed ftate of that place, the unani- 
mous approbation of the beft judges of the .botanical fcience, 
and the accurate defcription given by himfelf, are, and it 
is hoped fliall continue to be the mofl: ample teftimonies 
for ages. 

In him the gentleman and the Chriftian were happily 
united. By his patronage, multitudes with their families 
are noiv comfortably fettled in the world. Placed in the

ander Duke of Albany againft King James IIL It was 
then given by King James IIL to the Lord Monipenny, 
from whom it was foon retaken, as having been given by 
the King in his minority ; an,d was thereafter given by him 
to John Ramfay his favourite, who enjoyed it till the 
1488, when he was forfeited for counterfeiting a commif* 
lion under the great feal to the Earl of. Northumberland; 
then the lordQiip of Crighton was gifted by King James IV, 
jto Adam Hepburn Lord Hailles, whom he created Earl 
of Bothwell. It continued in his line till November 1567, 
when James Earl of Bothwell was forfeited for the murder 
of Henry, father to King James VL Thereafter it was 
given by that King to Francis Stewart, fon of John Abbot 
of Kelfo, who was natural fon to King James V. ; and he 
being forfeited for crimes committed againft James VI.

that the different parts of the edifice retained each the

Hamilton tower, and the Cuming tower ; and fome are ftill

enlarged and improved it ; their arms were found in dif-

at the weft end, was taken down 1719, to admit of a mo- 
"dern addition, to accommodate the congregation. The roof 
is arched and lofty, and from within makes a very fine ap- 
pearance. It is lighted with a tire of large windows on 
each fide, and a great window in the eaft end ; in the up- 
per part of which the Douglas arms are cut, and at the 
fouth corner of the window, within and without, quartered 
in ftone with the Royal arms, probably pointing to the 
Earl of Douglas's marriage with King Robert's . grand- 
daughter. The Hamilton arms are engraved in the centre 
of the, arch, which fupports what is called the organ loft. 
•The arched roof is covered with large polifhed flags of 
ftone, fomewhat in the form of pan-tiles. The whole edi-

from the old caftle, and at once commands the charming 
group of beauties, arifing from the banks, the river, the 
ruins, and the adjacent country. The apartments, like the 
great objefts that furround them, are marked with a dig- 
nified fimplicity. The banks are broad and extenlive ; 
exhibit a very pifturefque fcene ; have been much impro- 
ved of late, with pleafure walks, huts and Ihrubbery. The 
walk from the houfe, along the fummit of the bank, and 
round the ruins, is moll delightful. Nature is truly Great ; 
her fteps are carefully followed, and a good tafte difcover- 
ed. A grove of oaks occupies one part of the banks, al- 
ready confiderably advanced, and will make a venerable 
figure in future times. The park is inclofed with a re- 
markably good wall. There are few places more favour- 
ed from fituation, or capable of greater embellifhment. 

The firft who had the merit to difcern the beauties of 
thefe banks, even in their rude ftate, covered with natural 
wood, and to plan and commence improvements, was the 
late Lady Lucy Douglas*.

Author ; and participated in thofe pleafures which were 
pure, ferene, and congenial to her own mind.

Wood/jal/,~^the feat of Walter Campbell, Efq; of Shaw- 
field. It is fituated on the banks of the water of North 
Calder, about five miles north-eaft from the church. The 
houfe is large, with fome noble apartments, and a good 
library. The inclofures and plantations are numerous and 
«xtenfive. Two avenues from the great road to Edin- 
burgh, from the eaft and weft, each about a mile and a 
half in length, paffing through belvideres and funk fences, 
form a fine approach. It has lately received a complete 
imelioration from the prefent proprietor. A beautiful 
piece of water has been formed, upon the banks of which 
modern gardens, peach-houfe, vineries, and orangery, are 
built to a great extent. Pleafure-walks are made along the 
banks of the Calder, and both fides ornamented with plant- 
ing. The Monkland canal adds to the fcenery, and will 
advance the value of the coal in the eftate. The fields have 
been laid down in great order; plantations thinned ; fine- 
viftas opened; and a more elegant and cheerful afpeS 
given to the whole. Few places in the weft of Scotland 
are upon a more liberal fcale ; few gentlemen underftand 
die improvements and interefts of their country better 
than the proprietor, or have done more than he upon his 
Several feats. 

Mijcellaneous Remarks. — Beauty of Clyde/dale, or Fine 
3Profpe6is. — There are many of thefe in the parifh. One 
is, the view from the weft point of the village of Uddin^- 
llon, down the river. It terminates upon Daldowie, where 
tiature, aided by an excellent tafte, has formed one of the 
moft beautiful places upon Clyde. 

But there is another profpe£l: which merits particular 
notice. It is the eaft brow of the hill, upon which the vil- 
lage of Bothwell ftands. This feems to be the great pro- 
•auoutory which nature has eredled to contemplate the beau-

ties of the Fa/e of Clyde. There are none in the central line 
of the river above this ; and after it quits this^pariih, it lofes 
its noble woody banks, and generally falls into a flatnefs 
en both fides. 

This eminence commands the moft rich and pleafant 
profpeft of an inland kind in Scotland. It would require 
the pen of a Thomfon to do it juftice. 

On the right hand, and fouth fide of the river, the refi- 
dence of the Duke of Hamilton, called the Palace, Ghatel- 
herault, and the town, appear juft under the eye, amidft 
extenfive pleafure-grounds, which may vie with many of 
the fineft places in England. A little above this, the vale 
is contrafted, the banks are wide and deep, with a gradual 
•declivity on both fides, which are occupied by gentlemens 
feats, highly cultivated and embellilhed. Woods and plan- 
tations ftretch along the banks. Numerous orchards are 
interfperfed through the groves. Thefe, in the fpring, give 
a great part of the vale an Italian afpe£l, or rather, 

■ " The bloom of blowing Eden faij'." 

In autumn they are richly loaded with fruits, and may be 
called the Garden of Scotland. Beautiful meadows cover- 
ed with flocks, and rich fields of corn, adorn the holms and 
plains. Nature difpenfes her pleafures with a liberal hand. 
Hill and dale, wood and water, are finely blended together. 
So great a coUeftion of rural charms, variety of fcenery, 
exquifite arrangement, and vaft extent, render the whole 
moft enchanting. The river, with its purling ftreams and 
meanders, diflfufes fertility and beauty through all the vale,

The beauties of Both well banks were celebrated in an- 
eient fong, of which the following incident is a ftriking 
probf : 

" So fell it out of late years *, that an Englilli gentle- 
man, travelling in Paleftine, not far from Jerufalem, as he 
pafled through a country town, he heard by chance a wo- 
man fitting at the door, dandling her child, to fing, 

" Bothwcll Bank, thou bloomeft fair." 

*' The gentleman hereat exceedingly wondered, and forth, 
with in Ei^glifh faluted the woman, who joyfully anfwered 
him, and faid, She was right glad there to fee a gentlemen 
of our ifle •, and told him, that fhe was a Scotch woman, 
and came firft from Scotland to Venice, and from Venice 
thither ; where her fortune was to be the wife of an offi- 
cer under the Turk, who being at that inftant abfent, and

very foon to return, fhe intreated the gentleman to ftay 
there until his return the which he did ; and fhe, for 
country fake, to Ihew herfelf more kind and bountiful unto 
him, told her hufband at his home-coming, that the gentle- 
man was her kinfman ; whereupon her hufband entertained 
him very kindly, and at his departure gave him divers 
things of good value." 

In confirmation of this account of the view, a good part 
of thefe banks is now occupied by two gentlemens feats, 
Sweethope and Bothwell Park. They are both elegant, 
fet down on account of the profpedl, and both enjoy it in 
perfeftion. 

A new line of road is formed from Hamilton to Lanark, 
along the fouth banks of the Clyde, and througl^fhe whole 
length of the vale ; it is jufl finifhed, and makes one of the 
mofl pleafant rides in Scotland. 

Means of Improvement, — One principal abje(3: is the 
communication of a greater meafure of ufeful knowledge 
to the great body of the community. Parochial fchools in 
general are not fupplied with fuch able teachers as they 
were 50 years ago, owing probably to this, that they who 
have got a good education, find a more generous encourage- 
ment from the manufacturing or commercial departments, 
which formerly were upon a fmall fcale in this country. 
Parochial and public fchools fhould be efpecially direfted, 
i/?. To the inflilling of virtuous principles ; teaching the 
youth an abridgment of the Chriftian religion ; its incon- 
teftible evidence ; its incomparable excellence, as fecuring 
the quiet, order, and dignity both of the individual and the 
community. 

The great defign of education is, to form the mind to 
the love and praftice of virtue. How mournful is it to ob- 
fcrve, that this imi-ortant objeft fcems forgotten, if not 

esipnlled 



33^ Statijlical Account 

expelled from the modern plan of education. A fyllem dT 
religion and virtue, or any book relating to the Scriptures; 
IS not taught in the higher or lower feminaries of learning ; 
a few queftions of a Catechifm are got by mte, after the aU 
phabet, and feldom repeated, as if it were an infuk to art 
advanced under/landing. This may juftly be confidered as 
the great caufe of the immorality of the age. When a youth 
is fent abroad into the world, without a rational perfuafion 
of the importance of religion ; of his obligations to virtue"; 
deftitute of one argument to defend himfelf againft the at- 
tacks of its adverfaries, what can be expefted, but that he 
will fall an eafy prey to the allurements of vice. Hence, 
in high life, infidelity and impiety ; in lower ranks, mif- 
taken yie^s of religion, bigotry and fuperftition, inftead of 
the weightier matters of the law. 

What a reproach to this age, with all its boafted inr- 
provements in arts, in philofophy, and under the laft dif- 
penfation of Heaven, tb be outdone by ancient heathens ia 
their plan of education. They taught their youth deeds, 
and not words : they enforced juftice, generofity, magnani- 
mity, all the virtues. Hence the illuftrious charaders they 
reared in all ftations and capacities, hitherto, alas! unequal- 
led in any fueceeding age. 

Quid mufse fine moribus van£B proficiant?

(1794) have enjoined, that a more particular attention 
fliall be paid in parochial fchools to teaching the youth the 

principles

and requires an adequate remedy. t ^ c 

When the virtuous Pilot has brought the veffel of State 
through the perilous ftorms that affault it, fafe mto the ha- 
ven of peace, would it not be a talk worthy of his head an^ 
heart, to invigorate the falutary rules refpeftmg fchools 
and colleges ; to add new ones, if judged expedient ; pomtmg 
the whole to the effedual eftablilhment of a fyftem of national 
virtue. What fo likely to fecure the noble purpofe of the 
Royal proclamation ? What more defirable to the mofl: 1 
virtuous Sovereign in the world, who, by a thoufand. daily 
proofs, fliows, that the virtue, felicity, and glory of his 
people, is the fupreme and conftant wiQi of his heart ! 

The prefent alarming effeas of a long unprincipled, 
though fajhimahle edmation^ in a neighbouring country, 
holds forth an aiaful admonition to the nations. 

1. The Latin language ought ever to be held as an in- 
difpenfable qualification, elfe youths of genius may lofe the 
©nly opportunity of riling in the world; perfons indifferently 
qualified will be put into the office of fchoolmaftcrs ; and lite- 
rature at laft will be baniflied from the country. Befides this» 
the youth ftiould be taught the principles of reading and wri- 
ting the Englifh language with propriety; the principles 
of hiftory principles of geography ; principles of mecha- 
nics ; the pra61:ical parts of mathematics ; and, 

3. The principles of agriculture: The rudiments of 
which may be reduced to as fimple a fcale, and be as eafily 
taught, as book-keeping. It is now taught in the uhiver- 
fity of Edinburgh. A fmall compend may be made, and 
illuftrations procured on the moft material parts, and com- 
municated to the youth, when his underftanding is fuffi- 
ciently opened, and he is about to leave the fchool, and be- 
take himfelf to the employment of agriculture.

Th,s country is employed in agriculture, manafaaures, 
^d coa,„,erce. The education ftould be adapted to thefe 
objcfts. Academies, upon a fimilar plan, eftablilhed m 
towns, and endowed with proper falaries, would be much 
for the benefit of the public. The bulk of mankind have 
i.e»her ttme nor money to procure a liberal education ; a 
fcheme of th,s kind brings inflruftion within their reach, 
and tends to reconcile them to it; would produce genius 
and improvements in mechanics, manufaflures, in afl pro- 
ieHions ; and communicate to the generality of the people 
jarioos branches of knowledge, of which they are at pre- 
lent deftitute. 

The foundation being thus eftablifhed upon a well con- 
duded education, it may be proper to add fome of thefe 
means which might improve the prefent ftate of agricul- 
ture in the parifli. Let it fuffice to name the moft ob- 
vious.

in England, have had a confiderable influence to bring that 
foil to its high ftale of improvement. This country, from 
its bleak fituation, and thin air, requires warmth to tiouriik 
its plants. 

A Belt of Wood round the Farm-houfe would be an im» 
provement. 

Thefe circular clumps, rifiing here and there amidft in- 
clofed fields and lawns, would not only (helter, but give the 
whole country the look of a mod extenfive pleafure- 
ground. 

To moderate the high Price of Wages is a moft important 
objeft of good policy. The feat of manufactures being in 
the neighbourhood is not a fufficient plea ; the wages have 
been high before the manufaftures were fo fiouriftiing; 
and there is flill a great number who, from early habits, 
prefer the labours of the field. Gentlemen in other coun- 
ties have eftabliftied proper regulations for this article, and 
it is certainly the intereft of gentlemen and landholders to 
confine this charge within due bounds. 

The 'Two-horfe Plough would fave the one half both of 
men and horfes, and efpecially the confumpt of oats. The 
oats confumed by three or four horfes upon a fmall farm 
muft be very great. Lord Karnes has calculated, that the 
quantity of oats confumed yearly by the work-horfes in 
Scotland, amounts in value to L. 261,940, 16 s. 

The Leafesfor two 19 Tears are moft preferable. They 
give encouragement to the farmer to expend liberally in 
improvements, becaufe he confiders it as a patrimony to \ 
his family. He trufts, that what he throws away his fon 
Tvill recover with increafe. Short leafes and poor farmers 

are 



33^ Statijlical Account 

are the great bars to improvements. If it is objeaed, that 
an advance of rent is expeaed at the end of the firft 19 
years, that may be agreed upon at certain periods of the 
leafe ; and if judicioufly managed for 38 years, it would be 
worth a third or a half more than it was at the beginning. 

A morefavourahle Rotation would be highly advantage- 
ous ; a great deal more in grafs, and lefs in tillage. This 
would be the eafieft method to put farms into good order, 
and to keep them in it. The half of feed, labour, and ma- 
nure might be fpared ; the work done in proper feafon, and 
at the half of the expence. 

A generous Indulgence upon the part of the Proprietor to 
the tenant may fometimes be very expedient ; remitting 
him fome part, or allowing fome deduftion, in proportion 
to his liberal improvements. It is not requifitc, where 
farms are in good order ; but conlidering the general condi- 
tion of tenants, it is impoflible farms can be improved 
otherwife. Whereas, if fuch a meafure was adopted for 8 
or 9 years, at the beginning of the leafe, the farmer would 
be enabled to apply a double quantity of manure, and 
thereby greatly advance the value of the ground *. 

But 



* A gentleman of property in tile neighbourhood, fince ttefe remarks, 
lias favoured the writer with a few lines, reprefenting, in ilrong terms, 
the injury done by hunters to the Farmers in this parifti. He obferves, that 
the exercife Ihould be confined to an open country, and dry fields ; for, 
if purfued in a deep loamy foil, as here, the damage may foon be very 
great, involving wheat, fown grafs, hedges, and all V€getation in ruin. 
In a word, he does not know a greater grievance that a poor farmer la- 
bours under. The hint deferves notice ; it comes from a gentleman who 
is drefling hia farm with a degree of tafte equal to any in the country. 
To this, perhaps, it will be faid, that gentlemen mull have their fport. 
Yet, with all deference t« tiat nobU and ancient profcffion, may it not be

But for thefe, and more effential improvements, we look 
*Q the Board of Agriculture, where, from the diflinguiflied 
abilities, zeal, and application of the Honourable Prefident 
and his coadjutors, and the countenance of our moft gra- 
cious Sovereign, there is good reafon to expeft, that the 
greateft benefit will accrue to the country. 

Farmers here, and in the neighbourhood, have been for 
fome time fubjeQ: to inconveniencies. The advantages 
arifing from their nearnefs to Glafgow are of late im- 
paired, granaries being eftablifhed there, and fupplied with 
Englifti and foreign grain, the brewer and baker are fur- 
nifhed in larger quantities, and upon a certain credit. The 
fmall portion of the farmer meets not with fo hearty a re- 
ception as formerly. The price of wheat, it has been ob- 
ferved, is fuppreffed till after Candlemas, when mofl of the 
"fmall farmers are obliged to difpofe of it. The value of 
their crops have not increafed in proportion to the ma- 
nufaftures about them ; fervants wages high manure 
fcarce, and the price advanced ; a fupply of horfes not to 
be had, but at a very confiderable charge.

There is no gentleman but will reply, that nothing can be more diftant 
from their fentiments. What pity then, but fome regulations were made 
hy thefe gentlemen themfelves, to prevent fuch ravages, and to fecure 
foih.of a certain defcription, which nature meant not to be Iparted with. 
The meafure is much wanted, and would be highly conducive to the po-

IN the courfe of time, the name of this parilh has under-

of Moray, it is denominated Ecclefia de Ruffus. How long 
this had been the received orthography, feems not very 
clear but from the commencement of our prefbyterial 
record in 165 1, I find it written, at fucceflive periods, Raf- 
fart, Raffard, and for about 60 years back, ahnoft invari- 
ably Rafford. Being no adept, however, in the ancient 
Celtic or Gaelic languages, I will hazard no conjedlure a- 
bout its true etymology. 



Situation, 



of Raffbrd. 



339 



Situation, ISc. — It is fituated in the county of Elgin, 
prefbytery of Forres, and Synod of Moray j extends from 
N. E. to S. W. above 8 Englilh miles in length, and from 
5 to 3 tnWts in breadth. On the E. it is bounded by the 
pariflies of Alves and Elgin ; on the S. by thofe of Dallas 
and Edinkillie ; on the W. by the river Findhorn, and the 
parifti of Forres ; and on the N. by that of Kinlofs. 

Soil, 5ifr.— The face of the country is much diverfified ; 
part of it being low, flat, and fertile ; part of it elevated, 
moorifh, and rocky. The complexion of the foil, too, is 
Various ; conliftingiof a deep and rich clay, a hot and blow* 
ing fand, a black and (hallow mould, bottomed with rock ; 
though the greater part is compofed of a rough brown gra- 
vel, where the bottom is a continued ftratum of fmall peb- 
bles, fo clofely compared that no ploughfliare almoft can 
pierce it, and having the appearance of calcination. 

Climate, h'c. — The oir can hardly be faid to poflefs any 
fpecific quality ; it is rather dry than moift, rather healthy 
than otherwife. The moft prevalent dijiempers, at lead 
fuch as generally prove moft fatal, are fevers, confumptions, 
and afthmas ; thefe may partly be owing to the heat and 
drynels of the foil, to the clofe and fmoky air of the dwell- 
ings, as well as to the nature of the food, efpecially pota- 
toes, on which, for feveral months of the year, many o£ 
the poorer clafs are almoft wholly fuftained. 

Htlls. — The hills, none of which are remarkable fof 
height, are chiefly covered with heath, futze, whins, and 
juniper. They produce abundance of excellent peat, turf, 
fallen fir, and other fuel, and afford extenfive pafturage for 
iheep and black cattle* 



Minerals, 



Statijlical Account 



Minerals. — Here are two valuable quarries, the ons of 
freeftone, the other of grey flate, both of which are deem- 
ed inexhaulHble. The acceCs to both is eafy, and the ma- 
terials are inuch efteemed in buiJding, for their eafinefs in 
working and durabilitj. 

Cattle. — :The native breed- of cattle is fmali •,. an ordina- 
ry ox or cow feldom outweighing 70 or 80 lbs. a-quarter. 
The horfes are very indilFerent, except with the beft far- 
mers. Sheep are numerous, fmall lized, and moftly white ; 
their wool is fine, and the mutton very delicate. 

Population. — According to Dr Webfter's report in 1755, 
the population of RafFord then amounted to 13 13 fouls. 
From an accurate lift taken in 1791, the number of 
parifhioners did not exceed 1072 j, of thefe 488 were 
males, and 584 females j about 840 were found ex- 
aminable, i. e. abbve 7 years old. The number of houfe- 
holders was exaftly 238 ; of whom 136 were married, and 
had iflue ; 16 were married, and hadnoiflue; 18 were 
widowers 48 widows ; the remaining 20 unmarried, and 
3 of them bachelors. The annual medium of births for 
the laft 7 years, as they ftand on [the record, may be com- 
puted at 32 ; of marriages, at 8 But of the deaths no ex- 
aft regifter has been kept, owing chiefly to that relu6tancc 
with which the tax on burials was paid by country peo^ 
pie*. 

Poo^.-^About 40 poor are fupplied from the parifh 
funds. Our capital ftock is L. 50 Sterling, and our week- 
ly colledlious amount from 2 s. 6 d. to 3 s.

longemty.—Y^y^ of the natives are remarkable for lon- 
gevity. There are now only about three individuals in 
the parilh v.hofe ages exceed 80, and the generality of o\&amp; 
men feldom attain that period. 

Agriculture.— bulk of the people are employed \u 
agriculture, and fome have pretty extenfive farms, though 
few have begun to inelofe their grounds, or to lay down 
green crops. This defed may be partly owing to want of 
due encouragement, as well as to ancient prejudice, to whick 
lall caufe it is perhaps too often afcribed. Of late, indeed^ 
feveral of the farmers have built decent houfes, for whicb 
they have an allowance from the landlord, and a fpirit of 
improvement begins to prevaiL Thofe whofe farms are 
in good order, yoke two horfes only in a plough, with 
which an expert band will make very neat and excellent 
work ; but the greatell number difeover a predileftion for 
oxen, of which they generally couple 6 together, and ia 
the hilly parts, (or as they are called provincially the 
braes), where the farms are fmall and the tenants poor^ 
the yoke is frequently compofed of two cows, and two hor- 
fes to lead. 

Occupations, is^c. — Spinning flax is the great occupation 
of the females, moft of which they raife at home, and make 
into Iheeting, diaper, and fackcloth ; for little of the native 
growth is fine enough for fliirting. Many of the poorer 
clafs, too, fupport themfelves by fpinning. to yarn-merchants, 
who allow them from 10 d. to I s. per fpindle. 

Of handicraftfmen weavers are the moft numerous clafs, 
amounting to 16 or 17, including journeymen and appren- 
tices. There are 4 tailors ; 3 bkckfiniths ; 3 millers ; 5 
joiners, and fome of the farmers work in wood, and make

whole, a fenfible, decent, and ferious people. In former 

Umes, indeed, the high and myftical doftrines of Calvinifm 
being umverfally taught, and admired as the only fyftem 
of orthodox belief, had dilTeminated among the ignorant a 
fpint of wildnefs and bigotry; but this, for more than half 
a century part, has been gradually fubfiding, and it is hum- 
bly hoped, that the rigid and fallible dogmas of men will 
no longer be fubftituted for the pure and rational truths of 
the gofpel. On the other hand, as no earthly community 
is perfea, the moft prevalent vices I have had occafion to 
remark in this, are falfehood, intemperance, fenfuality, and 
petty thefts ; thefe perhaps will be found moft congenial 
to mild and temperate climates. 

Heritors, ^c.— The heritors are the Earl of Moray, pro- 
prietor of Tarras and Cluny ; the Honourable Lewis Duff of 
Elervie ; Alexander Penrofe Gumming of Altyre, and Jo- 
feph Dunbar of Grange, Efquires. The valued rent of 
the parifli amounts to L. 2612 : i8 : lO Scots ; and the an- 
nualrent, of which a great part is vidlual, may be eflima^ 
ted, communihus minis, about L. 1600 Sterling. 

EJlates,lSc. — The Earl of Moray, though he has no family 
feat, holds fome of the fineft lands in the parifli ; his people, 
too, furpafs moft of their neighbours in the decent appear- 
ance of their houfes, and the order in which they keep their 
grounds. In Tarras they raife plentiful crops of wheat, 
3 barley.

barley, oats, peafe, beans, — flax and potatoes ; thefe laft 
are found an ufeful mean of improvement. The mode of 
preparation is this : An exhaufted field is let out in par- 
cels, rent free, to poor people in the neighbourhood, wbo 
on their part furnifh the manure, labour the ground bj trench- 
ing it with the fpade, plant and reap the crop. In this 
manner, the bottom foil, which is a ftrong clay, being ex- 
pofed and meliorated, acquires a degree of fertility which 
it does not lofe for years after. The oats produced here 
are of a fuperior kind, and highly efteemed for fowing. 
The lands of Cluny, fituated in the hilly part of the parifli, 
are fomewhat cold and backward ; the foil, however, is 
powerful, and the corn pretty good of its quality, and the 
whole eftate is accommodated with abundance of fuel and 
pafturage. Here is the flate-quarry formerly mentioned, 
which is rented from the proprietor by the taekfman of 
the farm wherein it lies, and by him let out to the quar- 
riers, at the rate of 40 s. per icoo rough flates. 

The barony of Blervie is a valuable eftate, comprehend- 
ing large and fertile fields of corn, which produce grain of 
an excellent quality, efpecially barley, oats, and rye. There 
are confiderable trads of moorifh and hilly ground upon it, 
where the pafture in general is very dry and falubrious. It 
is alfo well fupplied with fuel ; for though in fome places, 
by the abufe of thofe who have long had fervitudes upon 
them, the peat-moiTes have fuffered dilapidation, yet in 
others they ftiU remain unbroken ; and wherever the pro- 
prietor's people find a deficiency of peat, they have re- 
courfe upon the moors, which furnilb them with turf fuf- 
ficient to make up their annual complement. Mr DufF 
has built a very neat modern houfe, which he has greatly 
ornamented, by planting the adjoining hills, improving his 
farm, and laying out his fields to advantage. The ancient 

family 



344 



Statiftical Account 



family feat belonging to the Dunbars, is moftly demoliib- 
ed J all that remains of it being a high tower, which, ftand- 
ing on elevated ground, 'commands an immenfe profpeft, 
including almoft the whole Moray Frith, with a great part 
of the counties of Elgin, Nairn, Invernels, Cromarty, RoCs, 
Sutherland and Caithnefs. 

Eaftward from this about two miles, ftands the caftle of 
Burgee, the feat of Dunbar of Grange. It is a large and 
beautiful fabric, confifting of a fquare tower of fix ftoreys, 
built in 1602, and an adjoining manfion founded about a 
century later. The gardens occupy feveral acres, contain 
a variety of fruit-trees, and are Ikirted with double rows 
of fine fpreading beeches. In approaching this place, 
which is very confpicuous, the mind is powerfully im- 
prefled with an idea of ancient magnificence. Here is the 
freeftone quarry alluded to page 340. from which, though 
great quantities of materials are conftantly taken, the pro- 
prietor derives almofi: no pecuniary advantage. It is fur- 
ther remarkable, that though Mr Dunbar's rental has fu- 
Itained little or no alteration for more than 80 years 
though the whole of his lands are very improvable, and 
abound with every needful accommodation ; yet his peo- 
ple are not affluent, their farms are poorly cultivated, and 
their houfes mean. Thefe defedis muft doubtlefs in fome 
nieafure be attributed to want of leafes, which, on account 
of certain family embarraffments, that gentlemen is not 
difpofed to grant them- Being reftrifled, too, from cut- 
ting peat in the moffes of Burgle, they confume a great 
part of the fummer in providing their fuel, which they 
muft bring from the moffes of Altyre in the oppofite ex- 
tremity of the parifti, where Grange has a fervitude. This 
inconvenience ftill further aggravates the want of agricul- 
tural improvement in his eftate. 

Altyre 



'of Rqfford. 345 



Altyre was formerly a diftina parifh, belonging to the 
-parfonage of Dallas, and was annexed to RafFord by aft of 
Parliament 1661. The walls of the old church remain en- 
tire, which till of late, that Mr Gumming erefted a new 
tomb, had been the burying-place of his anceftors time out 
of mind. The Cummings of Logic, who. are a branch of 
this family, and moft of the ancient refidenters, ftill conti- 
nue to bury here. The foil of Altyre is generally thin, 
but fliarp and produaive. It commands a prodigious ex- 
tent of hill and pafturage, and the peat-mofles are inex- 
hauftible. The prefent proprietor has brought his farm in- 
to the higheft order, and obferves a judicious rotation of 
green and corn crops, which feldom fail to be rich and a- 
bundant. He has planted about 1000 acres, with fir and 
other timber, which are advancing rapidly and decorating 
the place. The family feat is an old plain building, with n 
two neat modern wings, and though well fitted up and 
commodious, is not fuitable to that ftyle difplayed by its 
ingenious owner everywhere around it. Of late,*however, 
he has adopted the idea of building a new manfion, on a 
very fuperb and elegant plan. Here is a fpacious garden, 
abounding with a variety of excellent fruit and culinary 
ft^ifFs. On the north and eaft it is inclofed with a high 
wall, which is covered with a number of fine efpaliers, con- 
fiding of apples, pears, cherries, plumbs, apricots, neaa- 
rines, peaches, l^c. all of the rareft kinds, and mofl: exqui- 
fite flavour. For fome time, Colonel Gumming has refi- 
ded, with his family, in Tarres, where he has a fine houfe 
and a confiderable property. 

Church, Stipend, l^c. — The church is nearly centrical, 
being fituated about 3 miles fouth-eafl: from Tarres -, it 
was rebuilt in 1754 j and the manfe in 1746. In the times

of Diocefan Eplfcopacy, this was the feat of the fubchanter 
of Moray. Mifs Brodie of Lethen is patron. The fti- 
pend, by decreet in 1752, is 76 bolls 3 firlots barley, and 
349 : 13 : 4 Scots, including 100 merics for communion- 
elements. A procefs of augmentation is now depending 
before the Court of Teinds.— The falary of the fchool is 
16 bolls of bear; it has long been in a flourilhing ftate. 
By his unremitting attention to the morals as well as profi- 
ciency of his pupils, during a period of more than 40 
years, the prefent teacher has acquired a juft degree ot ce- 
lebrity. Many charaders now refpeaable in the literary, 
the commercial, the civil, and military departments, among 
others the learned Redior of the High School of Edin- 
burgh, who is a native, received their claffical education 
here. 

Ohelijk. — The only piece of antiquity worthy of remark, 
is the itanding pillar near Tarres, commonly called Sueno's 
Stone. It is allowed by all journalifts who have viewed it, 
to furpafs, in elegance and grandeur, all the other obelilk$ 
in Scotland, and is faid to be th^ fineft monument of the 
Gothic kind to be feen in Europe. Some time ago, when 
it was like to fall, Lady Anne Campbell, late Countefs of 
Moray, caufed it to be fet upright, and fupponed with fe- 
veral fteps of freeflone. The height of this ftone cannot 
now be eaflly afcertained ; it rifes about 23 feet above 
ground, and is faid to be 12 under it. Its breadth is about 
4 feet. What is above ground is vifibly divided, on the 
eaft fide, into feven parts, containing a variety of military 
fculptures. The greateft part of the other fide is occupied 
by a fumptuoiis crofs, under, which are two augull perfon- 
ages in an attitude of reconciliation.

347 



The Reverend Mr Cordiner of Banff, in his letters to 
Mr Pennant on the antiquities and fcenerj of the north of 
Scotland, has exhibited a fine drawing of this monument, 
and his remarks on it appear to be more fatisfactory than 
any I have read. He fuppofes it to have been erefled in 
memory of the peace concluded between Malcom and Ca- 
nute, upon the final retreat of the Danes from the king- 
dom. This event is faid to have happened about the year 

1012. 

But to whatever tranfaftlon it may allude, it can hardly 
be imagined, that in fo early an age of the arts in Scot- 
land as it muft have been raifed, fo elaborate a performance 
would have been undertaken but in confequence of an 
event of the moft general importance. It is thei-efore fur- 
prifing, that no more diftina traditions of it reached to the 
ara when letters were known.

Situation, l^c, 

THE united pariflies of Whitfom and Hilton, in the 
prefbytery of Chirnfide, Berwickfliire, are conjeau- 
red to extend in length from W. to E. about 4i miles 
Englifh ; from S. to N. the breadth does not exceed H miles.

(f Wbitfom and Hilton. 349^ 

Tarms l^c —They contain the following farms ; in enu- 
merating' and defcribing which, I begin from the weft, and 
go eaftward. 

I. The firft I {hall, take notice of is Weft-laws, the pro- 
pertV of Robert Hepburn of Clerkington, Efq; confifting.of 
about 665 acres ; the rent of which is only L. i^o, upon a 
leafe ; which, from change of times, has proved moft dif- 
advantageous to the proprietor, without much enriching 
the humane, but indolent tenant ; as the leafe foon expires, 
k will, no doubt be more than tripled. Weft-laws contains 
a great deal of fertile, dry, and well-expofed grounds ; but _ 
much of it marftiy and wet, and many negleded fields, 
over-run with whins, Uc. but very capable of being im- 
proved, when a new leafe and an enterprifing tenant ftiall 
fall to its ftiare. The farmer's old, plain, and unadorned 
manfion, office-houfes, and the cottages of his hinds and de- 
pendents, form a little village on one of thefe long emi- 
■ nences with which this part of the country abounds, from 
which elevation the farm derives its name •, this fituatioa 
commands a fine profpeft, and may eafily be rendered dry 
and commodious. 

1. Weft Newton, the property of Charles Buclian, Efq; 
confifts of 250 acres, rented at L. 130, upon a new leafe„ 
(for it has long been occupied by the prefent tenant and 
his father), which commenced at Whitfunday 1794, the 
validity of which is now difputed by the proprietor, in a 
procefs before the Court of Seffion. Seventy acres of it are 
bad, extremely fo, being moory and marfhy, from the wa-- 
tery fituation of the farm, which renders it often inacceip' 
fible from moft quarters-; it is ufually called BuchanV 
Me.

tonUnll, Lfq; confifts of about .50 acres. a.uch exceeding 
indeed m moxfture. but containing n.ore good, dry, and 
fertile ground than the former. It is rented at L 160 
upona leafe nearly expiring , and this farm, along with 
17 detached acres at tlie norch-eaft corner of it, rented at 
L.17, and amounting, with the rent of Eaft Newton to 
L. 177, conftitutes the property of Mr Dickfon in this'pa- 
nth at prefent. 

4, Langrigg is, as its name implies, a long narrow ftrip of 
land, conhfting of 155 acres Scots meafure, or 186 Engliih. 
It is low, but well improved and fkilfully cultivated, as it 
has very long been in the occupation of the proprietor, its 
rent cannot be precifely afcertained, but it is not over-rated 
m Its prefent ftate at L. i Sterling per acre, and of courfe 
gives L. 186. It is the property of Jofhua Tart, Efq-, and 
gives a vote for a Member of Parliament. This eftate 
pays only 6 s. 8 d. to the minifter, the fuppofed converfion 
of a boll of oats of old ; the new ftipend not yet localled. 

5. Ravelaw and Eaft-Laws, the property of Sir Alex- 
ander Don, Baronet, occupied in one farm, confifts of 466 
acres, the rent of which is L. 372. Along with fome wet, 
marfii, low lying ground, it contains no fmall proportion of 
good, fertile, dry, and well expofed grodnd, well improved, 
and Ikilfully cultivated. 

6. In our progrefs, there occur certain fmall portions of 
ground, too fmall to conftitute a farm, yet not to be omit- 
ted in this account of the parilli. ly?, the 17 detached 
acres at the north eafl corner of Eaft Newton, already 
mentioned as part of the property of James Dickfon, Efq; 
occupied by cue family j thefe few acres are exceedingly 

fertile.

fertile, and well improved, rented, as before ftated, at L. 17. 
Adjoining to which, on the eaft, lies a feu of John Bow- 
maker's, about n acres, now occupied hy an ingenious 
cart-wheel and plough-wright and fmith, the onlj confide- 
rable mechanic in this parilh ; his rent L. 14 Sterling ; thefe 
acres are remarkably good and well cultivated ; thej reach 
to the glebe of Whitfom on the eaft, which glebe is rather 
incommoded by a feu of a fmall fraftion of an acre, and a 
houfe upon it, inhabited by one old woman on the north of 
themanfe; and ftill more efFeftually has this glebe been 
hurt by clay huts ; a fmall inclofure of 4 good acres, now 
rented at L. 6, on the fouth fide of the glebe, (which the 
minifters of this parilh had very long poffeffed at a fmall 
rent), being taken from them on a pique of the Laird of 
Wedderburn, and the refumption ratified by the Court of 
Sefiioii ; it now belongs to the Earl of Wemyfs. 

7. Handie's-hill, a gradually afcending ridge of a confi- 
derable length, leads from the manfe eaftward to the vil- 
lage of Whitfom. Handle's hill belongs to the Earl of 
Wemyfs, and is one of thefe farms afterwards to be men- 
tioned, as conftituting the very copfiderable farm occupied" 
by John Hogarth. 

8. The village of Whitfom, the only one now in the 
united pariflies, is very inconfiderable, and has no trade 
nor manufaaure of any kind , it is principally formed by 
the houfe and offices of the farmer of Whitfom on the weft 
end ; the houfe and offices of a feuer at the eaft end • a 
fine modern houfe of a feuer on the fouth - eaft ; the fcho'ol- 
xnafter s houfe and fchool, with a few private weavers and 
flioemakers, thefe conftitute the whole village, which con- 
tarns 143 fouls. The farm at tli. weft end of Whitfom 
belongs to Bofwell of Blackadder, Efqj rented Tt 



35^ StatiJlicaJ Account 

L. 342, for not many more than 342 acres. The feu at the 
eaft end of Whitfom belongs to John Cunningham, who 
occupies alfo Aitchifon's feu ; thefe two feus contain 38 
acres, well worth as many pounds. The feu on the fouth 
fide is John Herriot^s, of 60 acres, which are rather under- 
valued at a guinea an acre, equal to L. 63. Indeed, all the 
lands about this village are moft fertile excellent foil, and 
fine expofure. 

9. We (hall next enumerate the farms occupied by an 
opulent and confiderable farmer, John Hogarth, under the 
Earl of Wemyfs, their proprietor : 

ijl, Hurdie's-hill, already mentioned, which contains 
5 families, and forms a fort of fuburbs on the weft end of 
Whitfom. 

2d, Hilton, about three-fourths of a mile to the eaft af 
Whitfom, formerly a fmall village, with a kirk and manfe, 
both now in ruins, in confequence of the annexation and 
the different arrangements made by the farmers. The 
whole old paxifti, exclufive of Tandinfield, contains only 
9 families, confifting of 50 fouls. 

3^, The Weft Vaults, which, along with Eaft Vaults, 
under another tenant, contains ,28 fouls in 7 families. 

^tb, Cantrigg and Deadrigg, on the fouth fide of the pa- 
rifl., containing 29 fouls in feven families. All thefe are 
moft fertile ground, efpecially near the old viUage of Hil- 
ton, where the fields are not exceeded in fertility by any 
part of the county at a diftance from the towns. 

10 South of Hilton lies Tondinfield, the property of 
Anthony Fofter, Efq; occupied by a farmer, who does not 
refideuponit. It contains 270 acres, rented at L. 220 : 
The foil, expofure, and cultivation excellent, as the name 
.^^ems to imply containing, in 7 families, 32 fouls. 



of Whitjom and Hilton. 



353 



11. On the north of Hilton, on Hilton-hill, lies Myre- 
fides, well named from its low, marllay fituation, divided 
into two parts, one of them a feu of George Purves, con- 
fifting of about 20 acres, fuppofed equal to L. 15 j and a 
fmall farm of about 40 acres, part of Mr BofweU's ellate, 
which pays L. 38 of rent to the proprietor, and L. 6 to an 
old farmer for quitting it to the prefent tenant. 

12. Immediately north of Myrefide lies the farm of 
Dykelhead, the foil much inferior to the foil of Hilton and 
Tondinfield, and rented low accordingly at L. 132, part of 
Mr BofweU's eftate, as is Hkewife now French-Law, within 
thefe few weeks purchafed by him from a Mr Scott of 
Alnwick, at nearly 40 years purchafe, rather from its con- 
tiguity to his other grounds, than its fertility, which is cer- 
tainly, however, fuperior to Dykelhead ; it is conjedlured 
to have got its name from the French, either as allies or 
foes, having made a neighbouring eminence their ftation 
while in this part of the country j the rent is L. 50. To 
the north of it lies Moorhoufe, a very fmall detached piece 
of ground belonging to the fame proprietor; the moft 
northerly, and the very worft foil in the parifli. * 

13. North-weft of Dykelhead and French-Law, the feu 
of Leethead, belonging to Robert Chirnfide, confills of 44 
acres, moft of it good fertile ground, well worth L, i Ster- 
ling /cr acre. Here rifes Leet, which, inconfiderable as it 
IS, 13 the only ftream which has obtained a name in tliis 
parifh ;^ it is minutely defcribed in the account of Swinton, 
where it becomes more confiderable.

Wemyfs. Wynnefield confifls of 650 acres. The farmer's 
houfe is a little more than an Englifli mile upon a public 
road, very gradually floping from Hilton-hill, and the fer- 
tility and value of the land fenlibly declines as it recedes 
from Hilton ; and this decreafe in the goodnefs of the foil' 
is moft perceptible on the north fide of the road. 

Population.- — According to Dr Webfter's report, the po- 
pulation in 1755 was 399. At prefent, this parifli contains 
in all 590 fouls ; of which number, ao6 are men ; 246 wo- 
men ; and 139 children at or about 10 years of age. One 
of thefe men is 93, and one woman 94 ; this old woman is 
found and healthy, and as flie came in with the century, fo 
there is good reafon to believe flie may fee it out. 

E'cclejiajiical State. — The prefent- incumbent is Mr John 
Waugh, in the Szd year of his age. He was ordained' 
adiflenting minifter in Alnwick in 1743, and admitted^ 
minifter of Whitfom at Whitfunday 1755; he is a wi- 
dower, and has 3 children ; the eldeft, a daughter, married 
to the minifter of Swinton ; the fecond, Robert Waugh,, 
furgeon of the 93d regiment; and the third, John Waugh, 
minifter of Menmoor in^ Angus-fliire, in the preftiytery of

The annexation, which had been fome years before de- 
'creed, took place in 1735, by the tranflation of Mr George 
Home from Hilton to Whittingham in Eaft Lothian. Mr 
Waugh's immediate predeceflbr in Whitfom was a Mr 
Calder, brother of Cadwalleder C alder, Efq; author of a 
very neat account of the Five Nations of Canada. The 
church was, in my remembrance, a miferable thatched build- 
ipg, which, though now flated, is ftill very ill feated, nar- 
row and incommodious. It will be acceptable to all con- 
:erned, if the Earl of Wemyfs, patron and principal pro-, 
prietor, refume a plan of John Stewart, Efqj his predecef- 
for in the eftate of Vaults, and in the patronage of Whit- 
fom, (as Robert Johnfton, Efq; of Hilton was in the eftate 
and patronage of Hilton), of building a handfome church 
upon Handle 's-hill, a moft commodious fituation both for 
the villagers and the parilh at large, and not more remote 
from the manfe than the prefent church, which is moft in- 
conveniently detached both from the village and from the 
manfe. All the parifliioners are ftaunch Prefby terians, 
either of the Eftabliftiment or of the Seceffion ; the Sece- 
ders are not above i in. 12 in proportion to the adherers to 
the Kirk. 

Poor.— The poor have, till very lately, been fupported 
by the ordinary colledions on Sunday, and the box was 
rather rich j but of late a very flender tax has become ne- 
ceffary. 

SchooL^Tht fchoolmafter of the united parifh has a fa- 
lary of about from L. 8 to L. 9 Sterling, a houfe, a fchool, 
and a very fmall garden, with kirk-dues, and fome perqui- 
fites arifing from his collefting the road-money. However, 
by the prudent choice of fchoolmafters, fome able teachers 
have occupied this place, and have had great numbers of

praftical arts derived from them ; and fome very worthy- 
members of fociety in the learned profeffions, and in infe- 
rior lines, owe their education to Whitfom fchool, till they 
went either to the Univerfities, or to their ^pprenticefhips. 

Miscellaneous Ohfervations. — The grains fown in this pa- 
rifh are oats, barley, wheat, peafe, beans, veatches, rye very 
feldom -, and the roots cultivated in the fields are potatoes 
and turnips ; no graflfes have I met with but rye-grafs and 
clover, red or white. No animals are to be found, but 
horfes, by which the whole tillage is performed ; black 
cattle, ftieep, and here and there an afe for medical pur- 
pofes. No curiofity occurs here, except that Deadriggs 
certainly derives its name from fome flcirmifhes of the ho- 
flile borderers ; and that Eaft and Weft Vaults got their 
names from certain Vaults, formed of old in feveral places 
of this parifh, for fecreting their effefts, upon any alarm 

from the fouth. 

It is rather extraordinary, that no one heritor or proprie- 
tor has fo much as a houfe within the parifh, except Jcftiua 
Tait Efq; This circumftance cannot have a good effeft, 
butmuft retard the civilization of the parifhioners, and

1. I have not been able to afcertain the acres nor the 

rents of each farm of Bofwell of Blackadder ; 

but his acres, on the whole, are nearly about 960, and his 
rent very exactly L. 560.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q29833">PETERCULTER</name> 
(County, Synod, and Presbytery of Aberdeen.) 
By the Rev. Mr George Mark, Minijier,</head>
<p>


Origin of the Name, 

'TpHE latter part of the name is variouflj written, sb 
fancy fuggefts. By fome it is written Coulter; o- 
thers write Culture, &amp;c. In our oldeft parifh-regifter, 
which begins with the year 1674, it is uniformly written 
Culter. This, probably, is neareft to the original word, 
which feems to be a Gaelic compound, confifting of cul^ 
" the back," and tir, " a country *." 

Extenty 

* To account for this etymology, it is to be obferved, that the parifli- 
clmrch Hands on the north bank of the river Dee, which feparates two 
large trails of country. Near to the church are ferry-boats, which con- 
ned the Unes of communication between the two countries. Here are 

united 



of Feterculter.

Extertty ^c.— From the eaft point, this parilh ftretches 
S. W. and W. 8 miles. Towards the intermediate point, 

where 

united fevcral roads, which lead from different points, and here is the 
chief pafTage acrofs the river, next to the bridge of Dee, from which it 
bears weft about 6 meafured miles.— Gaelic had certainly been the lan- 
guage of the inhabitants at a very early period ; and when they travelled 
from the north into the fouth, or from the fvuth into the north, they 
would naturally fay, they were going to eul tir, the back or extremity of 
the country. — ^When Popery became the eftablilhed religion, chapels had 
been built on tlie oppofite fides of the river, and dedicated to their re^ 
fpecflive faints, Mary and- Peter ; and to the names of thefe faints, the an- 
cient name of the place had been added. To- them were confecrated, not 
only the chapels, but the neareft wells ; the one called the Lady^s, and 
the otlier Beter^s well.. A few paces from the church there is a high, 
and fteep bank, called Peter's heugh. I am inclined to think that the 
name of the parifli is Gaelic, becaufe feveral places in it, and around it, 
do evidently derive their names from that language. For inftance, fouth- 
weft from the church is the barony of Kenarty, or Kean-ardc ; fo called 
from the ancient feat of the barons, which was fituated on the top of 
fmall eminence, at. the extremity of higher ground. As we go eaftward 
to Aberdeen, next to the eftate of Culter, by the lands of Murtle, fo call- 
ed from mur (or muir)7//, " the turn or reflux of the fea." The tides, 
when they rife higheft, do not now reach within two or three miles oC 
thefe lands ; but it is probable that fome centuries back, they had flowed 
that far. In feveral places the fea has receded, and a recefs of it has beea 
obferved at Aberdeen. Befides, the progrefs of the tides might be ob- 
ftrudled by the Dee ihifting its bed ; or by the great quantity of mad, 
fand and Itones, carried down with its rapid ftreams.— As we proceed 
towards Aberdeen, the next eflate is called Cults, or Cultis, from cuff 
" the back," and teas or deas, " fouth it having a warm expofure ta 
the fouth, and a hill behind it, to flielter it from the north and aorth-eaft. 
Its fitualion anfwers to the fituation of a place called Sunnyfide. In the- 
north corner of the parilh there is a farm called Leuchar, which fignifies 
a place where rulhes grow. On that farm they abound. In the north, 
fide of the parifli there is a farm called Auchlee, in Gaelic Aucb-laodh, i. e. 
« Calf-field." It had been noted for rearing calves. — Many more inftan- 
ces could be given. In proceeding to the weftward, I find the names of 
places, except thofc v/hich are modern, to be Gaelic, or tranOations 
from it.

where it Js indented by Dalmaik, it does not extend above 
5 or fix miles. It is in many places 5 or 6 miles broad. 
This parifh is of a very irregular form. The burn of Leu- 
char or Culter, parts it into three divifions ; the weft, and 
the fouth and eaft divifions. That burn flows from the 
Loch of Skene fouth ward, and after dividing the parifties 
of Echt and Skene in that quarter, it turns eaftward along 
a large trad of peat mofs, called Leuchar-mofs ; and there 
it gets the name of Leuchar-burn. Proceeding towards 
the fouth-eaft 3 miles, it is in that courfe the boundary be- 
tween the parifti of Skene and the weft divifion of this 
parifli *. It then receives the burn of the Ord, and runs, 
in a line almoft at right angles to its former dire6lion, from 
a fouth-weft corner of Skene, to a north-eaft corner of Dal- 
maik ■■, fo that it quite interfedts this parifli, which is there 
only a mile and a half broad. At the N.E. of Dalmaik, 
the burn of Gormack falls into it ; and then it is called 
the Burn of Culter. Thence it direfts its courfe fometimes 
eaftward, fometimes fouthward, and walhing part of Dal- 
maik, and the north-eaft fide of the barony of Kenarty, falls 
into Dee at the fouth-eaft corner of the glebe f . — The 

weft 



* Leuchar-burn, prior to its jnnition with the Burn of Ord, pafles 
tiirough an extenfive flat, partly meadow, partly fwamp, and fome of it 
arable. But it is fo liable to inundations that none of it can be ploughed 
but in a very dry feafon. At the end of the flat there is a cataraA. Some 
time ago, a mafon was employed to cut the rock and deepen the channel, 
that the plain might be drained- By fome defe5l, however, in the plan 
or execution, or in both, the end was not attained. 

■j- I have been the more particular in tracing the courfe of the Burn of 
Culter and Leuchar, becaufe in that tradl a canal might be formed be- 
tween the river Dee and Loch Skene. Into the north corner of that 
lake runs a pretty large ftream, after gliding through 3 fmooth valley near 

to 



of Feterculter*

weft divifion approaches to the figure of the larger fegment 
of an half-elipfe, and is feparated from Dalmaik by the 
Gormack-burn, which makes an oval fweep from the 
N. W. to the N. E. point. Its length is 3 miles, its great- 
eft breadth as many ; but it diminifhes at the north-wefl: 
boundary, to a quarter of a mile. It contains ten ploughsi 
Culler burn feparates the eftate of Culter from the barony 
of Kenarty, which makes the fecond or fouth divifion of 
the parifh, extending from the burn to the fouth-weft, be- 
yond the church of Dalmaik. In that direction it is above 
3 miles long. In fome places it is 2 miles broad, in others 
I mile ; and towards the fouth-weft boundary, it is not ma- 
ny paces in breadth. — The eaftern divifion may be faid 
to be a many-fided trapezium. Its breadth from N. to Si 
is 5 or 6 miles ; except on the W. fide, towards the burn 
of Leuchar, where it diminifties to 3 miles, and at laft to 
the half of that meafure. From E. to W. it meafures 
from 5 to 3 miles. This is the largeft divifion, and com- 
prehends the eftates of Culter and CountefiTwells, and the 
lands of Murtle. — The figure of the parifli being fo irre- ' 
gular, it would be difficult to compute its fquare contents* 
There was never any furvey made of it, except of Coun- 
tefiTwells and Murtle.

be carried forward, between Caftle-Frafer and Keranay, to the river Don, 
joining it not far from the termination of the intended canal betwixt A- 
berdeen and Monymuflc. When we confider the prefent ftate of the 
country, its population, improvement, opulence, commerce, &amp;c. the 
conftrutftion of fach a canal feems to be a remote event ; but it may, 
like other events of a fitnilar nature, be anticipated by the contemplative 
mind.

Surface^ Soil, Climate, i^c. — The face of the parifli is 
very rugged and uneven, with flopes and hollows, rocky 
eminences and marfhj flats interfperfed. Here and there 
(lands a fnnall conical hill or a cotiical ridge, furrounded 
with arable ground or with fwamps, traverfed fometimes 
by a rivulet. Towards the river, the uncultivated ground 
is covered with furze and broom ; the furze predominates. 
As we retire from the river northward, there is much 
moor-ground, covered with fliort heath, and fcattered bufh- 
es of broom and furze. In two of the higher hills, which 
are not, however, of great height, the heath is long enough 
to afford Ihelter to moorfowl; but that fpecies of game 
does not abound here. Partridges are very numerous. — 
Towards the river, the foil is gravel and fand, with a fmall 
mixture of earth. Here and there are interjedled fmall- 
fields of a fine black mould, fit for any garden produdlions, 
or for any farinaceous grain. Northward, on the higher 
ground, the foil is a red earth, with a: clay bottom. On 
the lower ground, it is a mixture of black earth or peat- 
mofs. In many places, the furface is covered with rocks 
and lai-ge ftones, fit for nothing but building fences ; but ia. 
the fouth and weft divifions, granite is found. In the lat- 
ter, there is a quarry of great extent, which has never 
been opened. It is believed that it would fnrnifh mate- 
lials for building a very large city,, perhaps for building, 
feveral cities. Here ftones 7 or 8 feet long are found on- 
the furface. 

The banks of the Dee are noted for falubrity of air. In 
this parifti there is little variation of climate. The houfes 
are generally built on high ground, and in a dry fituation ; 
and the people are healthy. I have not, however, heard 
of any remarkable inftance of longevity. Several exceed 
80, but few or none arrive at the age of 90 years. Rheu- 
matifm prevails among both fexes, efpecially among the 

males- 



of PetercuUer.

males. The opennefs of their houfes ; a fcanty provilion 
of fuel ; the variablenefs of the weather, againft which 
they do not fufficiently guard ; and the want of care, after 
being heated at work, — may be reckoned among the cau' 
fes of this malady. Confumption cuts off many young 
perfons. Five are now alRided with that difeafe, and two 
have died lately. Cancerous diforders are not unfrequent. 
The wind-colick, and other flatulent complaints, are very 
common.. This may partly proceed from their living fo 
much on vegetables, without being able to procure animal 
food. Few children efcape the fmall-pox in the natural 
way, for inoculation is not praflifed among them. Seldom' 
are either the fmall-pox or the meafles fatal. For acci- 
dental hurts, for whatever difeafes require chirurgical or 
medical Ikill, the parifliioners are recommended to the 
Infirmary of Aberdeen, where great attention is paid 
■to them, and many are benefited by that ufeful.infti- 
tution. The phyficians obferve, that fcrofulous difor- 
ders are more comm.on among the country people than 
is 'generally believed. — Although there cannot be great 
difference of climate in fo narrow a compafs, yet the 
ihow is often deeper, and the froft is more intenfe in the 
interior parts of the pariOi, than on the river fide. Here, 
a fouth expofure, and a thin dry foil, give a greater elFea to 
the rays of the fun. Thefe caufes contribure to make the 
■crops more early, and likewife more produaive. 

Property, Agriculture.— AXmoik two-thirds of the parifli 
belonged to,the late Mrs Udny Duff, and go now to her 
fuccelTor. About a fixth part, or more, belonged to the 
late Mr Burnett of Counteffwells, who left one fon, now 
a mmor, attending fchool in England. The other fixth 
part, comprehending the greateft fhare of the lands of 
Murtle, belonged to the town of Aberdeen. The town 
divided their property into four lots. Three lots were 

3 feued,

feued, or let in fee ; the fourth was let in leafe. Mr Wat^ 
fon, Advocate in Aberdeen, feued the lot of Bingle. The 
lot called Mains of Murtle has pafled through various 
hands, and is now the property of Mr Gordon, merchant 
in Aberdeen. Both thefe gentlemen have built neat coun- 
try feats, at which they occafionally refide. The large a.nd 
commodious manfions of Culter and Counteffwells are at 
prefent uninhabited. The lot of Oldfold belongs now to 
Profeflbr Ogilvy of King's College, who has let the whole 
of it to one tenant. A fmall houfe, the feat of the former 
proprietor, is ^uite defolate and ruinous. It is more than 
half a century fince a part of the eltate of Drum was an- 
nexed to the eftate of Culter. In this parifli, the barony of 
Kenarty, or fouth divifion, containing 4 or 5 ploughs, and 
alfo the weft divifion, belong now to the proprietor of 
Culter. The 4 lots of Murtle are inclofed and fubdivided, 
partly by hedging, and partly by ftone fences. Some of 
the inclofures have been trenched, cleared of ftones, well 
manured, and brought to a ftate of improvement far from 
being defpicable. Mr Watfon has favoured me with the 
following detail relative to his lot, which is fubjoined in 
the note below *. The ufe of lime, as Mr Watfon obferves, 

is 

* My feu is called BingMIl, not Bingle, in the original writs. It is ^% 
years fince I feued if. In extent it is 170 acres. At that time only 4a of 
thefe were arable; the remainder being covered with heath, furze, broom, 
briars, ice! I planted 60 acres, and trenched and improved the reft at a 
very confideiable expence ; fo all of it now bears crop but that under 
wood. I put 7000 plants into every acre ; that is, 420,000 plants in all : Of 
thefe were firs of all kinds, alfo oak, elm, a(h, planes, &amp;c. befides many fruit- 
^rees in my gardtjns. They thrive ; and many of the firs are already 1 5 and ZO 
feet high, and more. In one of the plantations a Druid's temple was 
difcovered, which I inclofed. Near to it there is a large tumulus, or 
cairn, which, it is faid, was once the burying place of the anc.ent famiiy 
of Drum, my farm having been their family feat fome centuries back. 
. That old family were formerly proprietors of it and Murt-hiU, or Murtle, 
■ ' and 



of Peterculter, 



is common ; but it is ufed in fo fmall quantities, that no 
great advantage is .in general reaped from it. They muft 
bring all the lime which they ufe from Aberdeen, for there 
is no limeftone hitherto found in the parilh. There may 
be 3 or 4 farmers here, who annually bring out each be- 
tween 30 and 40 bolls of unflaked lime, or ftiell-lime, which 
is equal to thrice that meafure of flaked lime. Few of the reft 
ufe above 10 or 12 bolls in a year, and fome of them none 
at all. In the eftate of Culter, and the lands in this parilh 
now annexed to it, there are 23 or 24 farmers j and al- 
though 3 or 4 farms be fometimes let to one tenant, no 
farmer pays above L. 40 of rent j fome from L. 20 to 
L. 30; and fome from L. 10 to L.20. Thefe farmers ) 
have fo many Subtenants ; but everyone of them is re- 
ftrifted to a certain number of fires. The peat-mofs be- 
longing to the eftate of Culter is almoft exhaufted, and the 
tenants are prohibited from felling any peats. They and 
the tenants in the barony of Kenarty, may cut fuel in the 
mofs of Leuchar, which fupplies the weft divifion, but is at a 
great diftance, and the road is very bad. In the lands of Coun- 
teffwells peat-mofs abounds ; and therefore, when Mr Bur- 
jiett purchafed that eftate, the farms were divided into fmall 

pofleffions, 

and of a great tra£l of country around befides. In digging up the foun- 
dation of fome old walls, which were faid to have been part of the man- 
lion of that family, ray workmen found near an handful of filver coin, 
about the fize of fixpences, infcribed Davidus Rex. About that time a 
report was prevalent of a bull's hide, filled with money, being funk in a 
bog. In trenching, the labourers went deeper here than any way, in full 
expectation of difcovering the treafure, but were djfappointed. — In the 
plantations there are foxes, hares, and deer, &amp;c. When I began to improve, 
the ufe of lime was fcarcely known, except at Culter, where foot and 
lime were both ufed. Of the latter I drove out many cargoes. The 
country people then faid, Iivasnot -wife enough ; but when they faw the 
crops it produced, by the different methods of ufing it, they changed their 
opinion, and very foon ufed it themfcJves, and found the benefit of it, 
Now it is quite common.

Formerly tnere were from 10,000 to 12,000 on it; but the 
tenants fay, that they cannot now keep any, fince fo much 
hill has been mclofed and planted. It I's to no purpofe to 
expatiate on the ad^^antage of keeping fteep ; to recom- 
mend to them to employ a herd to tend feveral fmali flocks 
joined m one, and each perfon to pay according to his 
number of flieep. They will not alter their plan. Molt 
of the tenants keep the old track, they fow Scots barley 
and oats alternately; few fow peafe. It is common to ma- 
nure 2 or 3 acres annually, by making a fold, and keeping 
their cattle inclofed there all fiimmer and harveft, except 
the time they are on pafture in the morning and afternoon. 
The common Scotch plough is moftly ufed, and is fome- 
times- dra^vn by 10 or 12 fmall oxen under yoke, fome- 
times by 4 horfes, and fometimes both by oxen and horfes 
6 or 8 in number; nay, we are ftill fo Gothic in fome pla-

inftances could be product of ploughs, of Englifii con- 
ftrudHon, drawn by 2 horfes, or by 2 large oxen in 'traces, 
without a driver. It is to be regretted, .that the inftances 
are fo few. 

Of the eftate of Culter, ico acres are planted with firs 
and other trees. Of the eftate of Counteffwells, 140 acres 
are planted with firs, and 10 acres with trees of various

In all of them there is game, as in the plantations of Eingle, 
and various finging birds, the thrufli, linnet, goldfinch, \Sc, 
In fevere winters woodcocks are numerous in the woods 
of Culter. I have heard a fportfman fay, that he has, ia 
one day, killed 7 or 8 of them. — As plantations have in- 
creafed, ftieep have decreafed. There were 7 farms in the 
lands of Cuiter and Murtle, on each of which there was a 
flock of llieep, and now a fingle animal of the kind is not 
to be feen on any of them. 

There are in the parifli, of one kind or other, 132 hor- 
fes, 79 carts, about 1000 black cattle, 49 ploughs, 2380 
ilaeep. All the horfes, except about 20, are of a fmall fize . 
and the black cattle and flieep are generally of a fmall breed. 
The rent of fome of Mr Gordon's property is L. 3 an acrcj 
of fome L. i, lo s. and of fome a guinea. Of Mr Watfon's 
property, only a few acres are let to tenants, who pay a 
guinea per acre. In the lands of Counteffwells, the rent of 
an acre of arable land, is, I believe, in general a guinea- 
Some of the inclofures in grafs, being only 3 or 4 miles 
from Aberdeen, let at more. In the eftate of Culter, the 
rent of an acre of infield * may be 10 s. 15 s. or 20 s, ^ 
that of an acre of outfield, 2 s. 6 d. or i s. ; one would think 
fome of it dear at i s. The crop many times will not 
Gompenfate the expence, and they own it j but tliey 
fay, that they till it to renew the grafe; poor too is that 
grafs. The valued rent of the parilli is L. 2163 : 9 : 8 
Scots, or L. i8o : 5 : 9| Sterling. The real rent is above 
L. 1200 Sterling ; and there are 3 falmon-fifhings belonging, 
to the lands of Culter and Kenarty, whofe rents amount to 
L. 50 Sterling, or upwards.

Statijlical Account 



Church, Manfc, Stipend, ^c— In the year 1779, a fmall 
elegant church was built, and completelj furniflied with 
new galleries and feats in an uniform manner. Three 
years prior to this, the manfe got a new fubftantial roof. 
Then, and in 1779, it received other alterations and re- 
pairs, which made it, though it be but fmall, a comfortable 
habitation. It is built of ftone and clay, and is faid to be 
more than ico years old ; therefore it cannot long remain 
tight and found, unlefs the exterior coat of plafter be kept 
quite entire, by being frequently renewed ; already the 
rain penetrates the wall in fome places when it blows a 
llorm. About 3 years ago, a complete fet of new and neat 
office-houfes was finilhed in a very fubftantial manner. 

The ftipend is L. 38 : 5 : 3 Sterling, 394. bolls of oat- 
meal, and Si bolls of bear. In this ftatement I include 
L. 3, 15 s. or thereabout, allowed for communion-elements, 
and fome allowance for grafs-money. 

The ground deftined for mefluage, or glebe and manfe, 
\^c. is below the legal dimenfions. Although preventive 
methods have been ufed for fome time back, the river Dee 
and the water of Culter have made, and do annually make 
encroachments on the ground allotted for grafs to the mini- 
fter's cattle. 

The proprietor of Culter is patron ; but the right of pro- 
perty is at prefent difputed. 

School, is'c, — Some years fince the fchoolmafter's falary 
was only L. 5 : ii : i^; but the minifter applied to the 
heritors and the prefbytery, and got it augmented to L. 8, 
6 s. 8 d. ; he alfo receives L. 1 : 14 : 2 from a fund left by 
two of the late proprietors of Culter, Sir Alexander Cu- 
ming and Patrick Duff, Efq; for teaching fome fcholars of 
a certain defcription •, he likewife gets L. 3 for afting as 
feflion-clerk, with fome other perquifites, which are but

fmall. By a rule lately eftablifiied, he ought to receive 1 s. 
6cl. for teaching Englifh ; 2 s. per quarter when writing or 
arithmetic is added ; and 2 s. 6 d. each quarter for teaching 
L?itin. 

Many in the parifti complain, that they are far from 
fchool, and that their children are not able to go to it. 
For fome time I cannot fav that it was well attended by 
children near or far olF. But we have now got a fchool- 
mafter of approved affiduity and care, and the number of 
fcholars has been doubled. Laft fummer there were from 
40 to 50 at fchool at the fame time. Soon after he took 
oip fchool in the end of laft autumn, above 60 fcholars en- 
tered. 

Population^ \3c — In 1755, according to Dr Webfter, 
there were 755 fouls. At prefent, there are 220 families 
in the parifli ; 456 males, and 546 females, or 1002 fouls. 

Their divifion, according to age, Hands thus : 
Under 10, - 212 From 50 to 60, - 84 

From 10 to 20, - 195 From 60 to 70, - 85 
From 20 to 30, - 140 From 70 to 80, - 41 
From 30 to 40, - 121 And above 80, - 6 
From 40 to 50, - 117 

In the year 1776, and for fome time after, the number 
of inhabitants was above 1040. There was then a nume- 
rous family in the manfion-houfe of Counteffwells, and 
now there is but one fervant. In Culter-houfe there was 
lately a throng family ; now there are only three fervaiits.

From 1773 to 1783 the average of births is ai ; from 
1783 to 1793 the average is 16; but the accuracy of the 
regiiler cannot be much depended on. From the beft in- 
formation, however, it appears, that this parifii was more 
populous 40 or 50 years fmce than it is now. One reafon 
is, that 3 lots of the lands belonging to the town of Aber- 
deen were feued, or given in fee, and a fourth lot was let 
\\\ leafe to one tenant ; on this lot the number of families is 
reduced from 14 to 3 ; from 60 perfons to 20. On the lot 
of Oldfold only one family refides ; formerly it was inha- 
bited by 5 or 6 families. Qn the other two lots, Single 
and Mains of Murtle, the number of perfons and families 
is much the fame now that it was forty years ago. On 
Bingle there will be an increafe foon. Another reafon to 
be affigned for the decreafe of population is this, m^ny 
young perfons go to manufafturers and tradefmen in Aber- 
deen and its vicinity; there, fo many hands are employed, 
and fo great encouragement is fometimes given, that whole 
families migrate thither at once. This does now and then 
happen, when a farmer raifes the rent of his crofts, or when 
any difcord arifes. Jience it is, that on fome farms we 
find two or three cottages in ruins ; and on other farms, 
fome cottages in ruins, and fome of thofe which arc (land- 
ing, uninhabited. 

Of burials and marriages no regiller is kept. The num- 
ber of marriages is annually about live. Tiie number of 
t|ie dead brought hither for interment, from Aberdeen and

its neighbourhood, exceeds the number of perfons who die 
within the parifti. 

Parochial Funds. —O at funds for the fupport of the poot 
confift of the intereft of L. 100, the weekly colieaions in 
the church, mortcloth-dues, (b'c. Tlie church- feffion have 
alfo in their management annuities paid from the eftate of 
Culter, amounting to L.6, or more, and a legacy of L. 4c, 
the intereft of which muft be paid to the defcendents of one 
tnan and his wife, while they claim it. The lift of poor 
contains 50 perfons. They all receive fome {hillings at 
each of three ftated times of the year. They likewife re- 
ceive occafional fupplies, as neceffity requires. The annual 
penfion of fome does not exceed 12s.; fome get more than 
L. I ; and a few of them get more than L. i, 10 s. The 
diftributions, communibiis annis, exceed L. 30 ; fome years 
they amount to L. 40, with L. 3 or L. 4 to the infirmary 
of Aberdeen, over and above. By the frequent ufe of 
hearfes, the income from mortcloths has greatly decreafed. 
In the year 1782 and 1783 a confiderable part of our ftock 
was laid out in the purchafe of meal and grain. By a pro- 
per diftribution of thefe, by a fmall ftiare of vidtual fent b}'' 
Government, and by donations from Mrs Udny Duff of 
Culter, and Mrs Irvine of Drum, the poor on the roll were 
made comfortable, and feveral perfons, who had fulFered by 
deficient crops, received a feafonable aid. Two or threti 
of the poor only go about as mendicants. 

Although there be not at prefent any gentry who attend 
our church, the colledion made on Sabbaths does honpur 
to the charitable fpirit of the congregation. 

Alehoufes^ Morals, l£c.-^\n this parifh there are three 
houfes where ale and fpiritous liquors are fold. Forty 
years back there were four times that number, and ine-

briation was too prevalent. Then ale and a few drams 
conftituted the treat, now punch is more common. Tliofe 
three alehoufes ferve chiefly for the accommodation of tra- 
vellers, and of perfons who meet to tranfaa bufmefs. I do 
not perceive that thej are prejudicial to the morals of the 
panihioners. In this place it is rare to fee a perfon intoxi- 
cated with liquor *.

* I do not mean here to affirm, that we are free from excefs of every 
kmd. All clafTes exceed in the ufe of tea and tobacco, particularly of the 
latter, as it ,s confumed in fnuffing, chewing, and fmoking. This laft 
Ipecies of coarfe luxury is too much pradlifed by both fexes. I have 
known fome perfons fo much enflaved to it, that they carried their to- 
bacco-pipe with them on Sunday, for the puipofe of fmoking on the way 
to atid from church. 

Dr Cullen very properly clalTes tobacco among fedativ.s or narcr,tic.T. 
The fmoking of it occafions to beginners fits of ficknefs, fevere, although 
of fliort duration, and fometimes proves an emetic. In long pradlition- 
ers, it produces fome degree of torpor and low fpirits, or d'fpofes to fleep. 
In melancholy people, it tends to increafe the difeafe. It aUb impairs the 
eye-fight, and fome have thought that it is adverfe to the genial powers. 

It is to be regretted that fo large remittances are fent from thefe king- 
doms, to procure a very pernicious article of luxury. When America 
was a part of the Britifli Empire, this branch of commerce was encou- 
laged as a favour done to our colonies. For their fake, the cultivation of 
tobacco was prohibited in Britain. One who is bat little converfant in 
politics would think, that this indulgence ought to have terminated with 
the commencement of the American revolt, or of American independ- 
ence. But this .claims not much attention, if we could be fupplied with 
a better fubftitute. Such a fubftitute might, perhaps, he found in camo- 
mile flowers. By mixing them with tobacco in fmoking, a flavour is pro- 
duced much more agreeable than that of tobacco alone. I believe that they 
are applicable to moft of the ufes to which tobacco may be apph'ed'. 
They are lefs noxious, and pofTefs more virtues. They are, or they ought 
to be, an ingredient in the Kritidi herb tobacco, and Britifh herb tnnS. 
By chewing a few of them, a flight diforder of the (lomach may be re- 
moved. In attacks of the wind-colic, many have rccourfe to tobacco ; ca- 
momile flowers are preferable; and the chewing of them might be faund 
ufelul in cafes of dyfpcpfy or i^trophy.

The people are, in general, a6live, fober, and indu- 
ftrious, of a humane and peaceable difpofition, decent in 
their behaviour, and come to church clean fed decent in 
their drefs. In fome, perhaps, the features of the felfilli 
principle may be too plainly difcerned. 

I have been nigh 20 years here, and I have not heard &amp;f 
any perfon, belonging to this place, capitally tried ; and 
only of two or three who have been imprifoned or banifh- 
ed. 

All the parifliioners are of the Eftablifhed Church, ex- 
cept a very few who are of the Epifcopal Church, and 
three or four women who attend the Seceders. A few 
young perfons do alfo refort to fome church,^ or Chapel of" 
Eafe at Aberdeen, although it be at a greater diftance thaa 
their pariih church. It is pretended that they go to hear 
favourite preachers, thofe eminent for popularity ; but I 
have heard it alleged, that they are drawn thither by mo- 
tives not purely of a religious nature. 

MamifaBures. — The late Mr DuiF of Culter granted a 
long leafe of fome acres of ground, clofe to the public road, 
and along the burn of Culter, to Mr Bartholomew Smith, 
art Englilhman, for the purpofe of erecting a paper-mill. 
In the y^ar 1750, Mr Smith erefted a mill, with proper 
edifices and machinery; andon iit January 1751, he com- 
menced the bufinefs of paper making. This was the firft 
attempt of the kind in the north, and fucceeded. The 
work is now carried on under the diredtion of Mr Richard 
Smith, the leflee's fon and fucceffor, who generally era- 
ploys lix men in the different parts of the procefs. For- 
merly they manufadured fuperfine paper, and paper for 
notes to the Aberdeen bank. I have written on fine poft 
.paper which was made at this mill, equal in quality to any 
that I have ever feen. At prefent the fabrication is chiefly 

confined

S tatijlica I A ceo unt 



confined to common paper for printing and writing, to 
pafteboard, cartridge-paper, and all kinds of wrapping pa- 
per, \Sc. For all thefe a ready market is found at Aber- 
deen, where the demand is greater than can be fupplied 
bj this and the paper-mill on Don. With the machinery 
of the paper-mill is connefted that of a barley-mill. 

I cannot help taking notice of the fituation of this mill, 
ivhich is beautifully romantic, or might be made fo. It 
flands in a bottom containing about 6 acres, almoft fur- 
rounded by a fteep hill, the front of which is feemingl^ 
compofed of the fegments of different circles ; the burn of 
Culter rolling along in a ftraight line, or parabolic curves. 
The precipice is higheft on the N. the N. W. and the W. 
thence declivous towards the fouth, at which, and the 
fouth-eafl point, there is fome opening. To the eye, the 
front of the fteep would feem, in fome places, to be nearly 
perpendicular, and the angle of declivity does not exceed 
23°. The perpendicular height is, in fome parts, about 
400 feet. A flream of water could be carried over a high 
part of the precipice, and would form a grand cafcade, 
which, with the planting of the circumjacent, flopes, would 
•ndd much to the beauty of the fc:«ne. 

About 5 years fince, a diftillery, coniifling of two (fills, 
(each containing 40 gallons), with proper utenfils, was 
erefled in the fouth-ea(l corner of this parilh, on the burn 
of Murtle, nigh to the fpot where a barley-mill formerly 
flood, and not far from the river Dee. When the duty 
v;as raifed, the bufinefs was interrupted for fome time; 
but it is now refumed by a company at Aberdeen, wlio 
proceed brlfkly, and make excellent fpirits. Although 
the dlftance from Aberdeen be only 5 miles, the fpirits 
dlftilled here cannot be carried to that market. Small is 
the quantity v/hlch can be vended within' the parifh, and 
they mufl therefore try to find merchants acrofs the coun-

try, until fome alteration ftiall be made in the laws now 
exiting relative to diftilleries. 

I fliall not be thought to digrefs much from the defiga 
of the ftatiftical volumes, when I obferve, that above fifty 
years back, in confequence of an agreement between the 
late Earl of Fife and the late Mr Duff of Culter, a faw- 
mill was conftruded on the burn of Culter, at its conflux 
with the river Dee. Fir-trees were brought down the ri- 
ver to it, from the woods of Braemar, and manufa£lured. 
But this work has been difcontinued thefe 40 years and 
more ; and people fpeak feelingly of the want of it, be- 
caufe during the time of its fubfiHence, the country was 
well fupplied with excellent timber. 

Stockings are manufadured here for the hollers in Aber- 
deen, as mentioned in the report from Fcht. 

Roads and Bridges. — Here we cannot boaft much of the 
excellence of our roads, although few places afford better 
materials. Some of the crofs roads are impaffable to car- 
riages, fome of them too bad for foot travellers, and feveral 
parts of the public road to Aberdeen (land in great need 
of repairs. By the exertions of Mrs Udny Duff, during 
two years before her death^ fome part of it was made tole- 
rable, and fome bad fteps were mended. Before her, the 
late Mr Burnett of Counteffwells was zealous in the fame 
caufe. Through his own eftate he got crofs roads made» 
which are now very ferviceable. As he was a gentleman 
of a benevolent and public fpirit, and was called away ia 
the vigour of life, his death might have been confidered as 
a public lofs. 

The Aberdeen road had at firft been ill projeared. To 
travellers it prefents an emblem of the elevations and de- 
prelTions which fretjuently occur in the journey of life. So 

much 



37^ 



Stafiftical Account 



much afcent and defcent, in fo quick fuccefllon, and in a 
fpace of fo few miles, can fcarce be met with in any other 
road. Some gentlemen in the neighbourhood, fenfible of 
this inconvenience, have thought of planning out another 
road, in a Ihorter line and a more level trad. But the ex- 
ecution will be laborious and expenfive, and to raife a fuf- 
ficient fund would be fomewhat difficult. The moft eli- 
gible refource, perhaps, would be, to obtain an aft for efta- 
blilhing turnpikes. 

I cannot finifh this article without mentioning, that few 
perfons perform the ftatute-work on the roads, and fome 
are fo unwilling to pay the commutation-money, which is 
low, that recourfe muft fometimes be had to the taking of 
pledges. Yet the generality clamour more than enough 
about the badnefs of the roads, particularly of the roads 
which lead to church. There may indeed be fome caufe 
of complaint, if what I have heard be true, that fome years 
the commutation-money has been colledled through whole 
diftridls, and none of it applied to the making ov repairing 
•of roads. 

As one travels along, he cannot help being offended at 
feeing feveral cart-loads of fmall ftones, which had beeii 
gathered off the fields, thrown into a pit or ditch at the 
road-fide, when they might have been better difpofed of 
to fill up pits and ruts, and broken places in the middle of 
the road. I am of opinion, that the farmers would readily 
•apply their gleanings in that manner, if any gentleman, 
■who takes a concern in the public roads, would exprefs a 
wifh for its being done. 

There are two arched ftone-bridges in this parifli. One 
of them is over Leuchar-burn, near its junftioh with Gor- 
mack-burn, on the road leading from Aberdeen to part of 
Cromar, i^c. It is in bad repair. A part of the battle- 
ments or parapet is fallen down ; fo that a beaft and cart

fell over it, more than 15 years ago, and both were de- 
ftroyed. It was built in 1608, and repaired in 1710. Jt 
has both thefe dates. Near to this bridge are the remains 
©f a rampart called the guard-dike. Tradition informs, 
that a ftrong guard of armed men was ftationed here, to 
prevent all communication between the found and the in- 
feded, while the plague raged in Aberdeen and its envir 
rons, about 130 years ago. 

The other bridge is over the burn of Colter, on the Dee- 
fide road, a little below the paper-mill. This is a good 
fufficient bridge, and in good repair. It does not bear any 
date, but it had been widened above 40 years fince. For- 
merly it did not eafily admit carriages, for it had been 
built before they were much ufed in this country. 

Clofe to the lower fide of this bridge, there is a rock on 
each fide of the burn, projefting a little, and inviting, one 
would think, to throw an arch over there. The fummit 
of the rock is more than 30 feet above the bed of the nV 
yer. If a bridge had been conftruded on that foundation, 
it would have added fome grandeur to the afped of the 
place ; the public road might have been fliortened ; and a 
fteep afcent might have been avoided. That afcent is, by 
much labour, now made eafier. 

There are other two arched * flone bridges ; each of 
which has the fite of one pillar in this parifh, and of the 
other in the parifh of Dalmaik. One of them is over 
Garvock-burn,son the road leading to- the houfe of Drum ; 
the other, which is a very fmall one, is over a rivulet, on 
the road leading to the manfe and church of Dalmaik, two 
ar three paces from the minifter's garden. 

* There are feveral bridges in this parifii compofeH of long fto,nes laid 
,»Hr,zor,tally, aa4 fuppor.ted at each ead by a ftone wall.

'thunder and Lightning. — On Saturday, loth July* 
1779, we were vifited here by a fatal thunder- ftorm. The 
morning of that day was bright and hot. At noon the he- 
liiifphere was overcaft. A ftorm gathered in the north, 
and made its progrefs fouthward over this place. About 
3 o'clock the explolion of the thunder-cloud, then vertical 
to us, was tremendous indeed. At that inftant, a farmer's 
fon with two fervants were loading their carts, on a heath 
about a mile fouth, with ftones for building the church. 
The two fervants, and two of the horfes were killed. The 
farmer's fon was ftruck to the ground, and remained fome 
time in a ilate of infenfibility. Next evening the two 
fervants were buried here in one grave. A ftone was fet 
Up at the fatal fpot, with the initials of their names. 

The ancient poet's verfes may be philofophic, but are 
not fufficiently defcriptive of the thunder-ftorm which I 
have mentioned :

bv hghtiungi h commonly called the Hill of the Old-town 
It does noir rife to a great height, and has a pretty exten- 
live plam on the top, partly cultivated. On the N. E. 
end is the farm of Oldtown, and the farm of HiUtown on 
fhe S. W. end. Betwixt them lies a heath. On the N. W. 
fide of i't, a wall and ditch run from N. E. to S. W. about 
3 quarters^ of a mile, along^ the flope of the hill, which is 
there^ fepara^ed from the public road by a fmall valley. 
From each end of this wall, and almoft at right angles to 
it,.Tamparts had been carried S. E. towards the river Dee, 
which is about a mile diftant from the angular points. 
Farm-houfes, huts, folds, and tillage, render thefe ramparts 
mdiftina ; but it is manifeft that they had not been carried 
all. the way to the river. The inequality and rocky na- 
ture of tlie gfound would have rendered that a difficult 
work. It is probable that there were then thickets and 
places of bofcage on the river fide, and they might have 
cut down trees to complete the" barricacfe in thefe parts. 
At the N.E. and S. W. angles, there had been half-moon 
work conflruded. The top of the bank is, in fome places, 
S or 9 feet above the bottom of the ditch. In moil pla- 
ces the height is about 6 feet. But in the courfe of cen- 
turies/mnch'of the wall muft have tumbled down, and 
much of the ditch muft have been filled up. 

No hiftory, to which I have accefs, makes mention of 
this military work. Tradition has done no more than 
tranfmitted fome names. The rampart is called " Nor- 
man's dike;" half cultivated lands adjacent tc^it, are call- 
ed " The Norman faughs." A large fountain, clofe to 
the eaftern rampart," bears the name of " Norman's well." 
Thefe names, together with the form and fituation of the 
work, fcrve to fliew that it has been a Danifli encampment. 
For we know that the Danes and- Norwegians invaded 

France 



of Peterculter, 



France in the 8th century. They entered the Seine and 
the Loire in their boats, and plundered the country to the 
gates of Paris. At length the French were forced to re- 
fign I^ormandy and Britany to Rollo, their general, anno 
^16. After that, they were frequently called Normans. 
Norman, too, was fometimes the name of their generals or 
chiefs. About the fame time, they haraffed the coafts of 
Britain, and continued their invafions to the 11th century. 
In fome of their lateft defcents, it is likely that they had 
penetrated into this country, and formed the encampment 
which I have mentioned. Confidering the nature of the 
country, the pofition was well chofen. Few places, fo 
near the public road, and of fo great extent, could be fo 
eafily fortified, or take in fo diftind and fo wide a pro- 
fpea. 

Some think that it might have been an encampment of 
William the Conqueror. He was, indeed, at war with 
Scotland, for fome time preceding the peace concluded in 
1072 •, but hiftorians fay, that his armies never came far- 
ther into the north than the town of Perth.

Advantages and Difadvantages. — Farmers and crofters, 
and cottagers, are near to a good market, for what they 
have to fell ; but perfons who need to buy, pay as high a 
price for poultry, eggs, milk, l^c. as is paid at the market- 
crofs of Aberdeen. The price of labour is generally the 
fame here and in town. It is an advantage to be near to 
a good fea-port, efpecially to thofe who carry lime to their 
farms. It may foon be found an advantage to all clalTes, 
if coals fhall become their general firing ; and that period 
does not fcem to be very diftant. If people could be re^ 
conciled to the ufe of coals, and were accuftomed to the 
proper management of them, they would find them cheap- 
er firing now than peat and tilrf; and although plantations 

become 



^tatijlical Account 

become frequent, it ha, „„. yet been found tl-at wood i» 
very cheap firing. 

A difadvantage arifes to our farmers from the nature of 
the foxl. Thm and" fteril, it is foon over-run with heath, 
whins or broom, when it is left ley ; 1 fay, when it is un- 
ploughed and unfowed. The ufe of lime does not afford a 
remedy; and marl, as far as I know, has not been difco- 
vered in any part of this country. To this noxious ten- 
dency of the foil, it will hardly be thought a fufficient 
counterbalance, that young broom is ufed for thatching 
houfes inftead of ftraw ; that old broom and old whins ferve 
tor tuel ; and young whins, properly prepared, make ex- 
cellent food for cattle, particularly for horfes ; llieep are 
very fond of them. One would think that their wool 
might be improved by fuch aliment. AH vegetables con- 
tarn a fait and an oil, fome more, fome lefs ; whins feent 
to contam a good deal of both. Certain it is, that when 
horfes are fed with bruifed whins, they get a fleek glitter^ 
ing pile, and grow plump and agile. The fame effeft is 
produced by giving them feeds of boiled corn, mixed with 
fait. On this principle it is, that fome farmers, when they 
ftack their hay, ftrew fait on the different ftrata. The fu- 
perior fmenefs of Spanilli wool is generally acknowledged* 
It is well known that the Ihepherds of that country lay 
flates with fait on them over the pafture-ground, and the 
flieep, as they go along, lick up the fait. I have been in- 
formed, that in fome places, barren fpots, after being pretty 
well cleared of Hones, are fowed with whins, which are 
mowed down with a fcythe, at a proper age, and bruifed 
for food to cattle. In the year 1775, the crop on Dee fide, 
after a dry fpring and fummer, was far from being luxu- 
riant ; it is yet diflinguiflied as the year of the Ihort crop ; 
in the fucceeding winter and fpring, almoft every body had 
recourfe to whins for provender to their cattle. Some 

2 prepared 



of Peterculter- • 3S3 



prepared them by threfhing them with flails, others b^ 
beating them with mallets in a ftone trough. This is pre- 
ferable to threlhing, efpeciallj if the mallets be hooped 
or caped with iron. But thefe methods are tedious and 
toilfome, and many might have a machine moved by war 
ter for executing this work. Here a quellion occurs, -vzui. 
What kind of a machine would be fitteft for the purpofe ? 
The only one hitherto tried, is conftruaed on the model of 
a waulkmill or fullingmill. With fortie alterations and im- 
provements it might anfwer the end ; but I am of opinion* 
that two thick weighty miU-ftones, to go upon their edge, 
like to thofe ufed in oil-mills for bruifing linfeed, would 
anfwer better. 

Mifcellaneous Ohfer-vations.—lt. is thought impolitic to 
allow corporations and focieties to purchafe much land, and 
there feems to be a general prejudice againft if, becaiife, 
when they get polfeffion of any heritage, they retain it. 
This is confidered as a bar to that rotation of property fo 
beneficial to fociety, and fo favourable to the fpirit of eur 
terprize. If this prejudice cannot be removed, it may be 
diminifhed, by confidering, that although corporations fel- 
dom make an entire and unreferved fale of their property, 
they frequently make a partial difpofal of their right, when 
they feu, or let their lands in fee for this gives a perpe-^ 
tual right to the feuer, or holder, and his heirs, on paying 
- a certain yearly rent. But it is generally required, that 
he fink a particular fum, or pay down fome hundreds of 
. pounds as a gratuity, at the conclufiori of the bargain, more 
or lefs, according to the value and extent of the land. Thus 
there arifes a twofold property : A fixed annual fum is 
paid to the corporation, as original proprietor or fuperior ; 
but they have no concern with the land tior" the tenants.

The holder has as full and indifputable a right to thefc a, 

m cafes of fee-fi mple. 

This kind of conveyance is attended with feveral advan. 
tages. The gentlemen who take the lands in fee do for 
the moft part, lay out money largely and judicioufly, in 
trenchmg, draining, fencing, planting, manuring, l^c. 
Large trafts, formerly ufelefe and rugged, are foon convert- 
ed mto fruitful and pleafant fields. Labourers find health- 
ful employment. Tenants are furniflied with crofts, or 
imall farms, m a more improved ftate than thofe around 
them ; and although the rent of an acre be three or four 
times as much as the rent of an acre in the common ftate 
of cultivation, they have a better bargain. Much has been 
done by gentlemen feuers in this parilh, as has been already 
mentioned ; and in the neighbouring parifii of Skene, a 
confiderable extent of land having been lately let in fee by 
focieties in Aberdeen, the face of a rough bleak country is 
in feveral places much altered to the better. 

On property of the fame kind around Aberdeen, we, 
year after year, behold villas rifing, and various improve- 
inents going forward. About 40 years back, the vicinity 
of that town exhibited a profpedl as wild and barren as can 
be well imagined, confiding of rocks, marflies, fton_y heaths, 
and fpots over-run with broom, briars, thorns, and whins. 
Now it prefents us with a beautiful landfcape, of fmall neat 
houfes, gardens, nurferies, plantations, bleachfields, fine corn- 
fields, l^c. It is to be prefumed, that fuch beneficial alterations 
had not taken place, if the ground had belonged to private 
proprietors, becaufe they feldom or never let any part of 
their lands in fee; a method of transferring property, 
■which well fuits gentlemen who like rural amufements, 
but do not chufe to lay out much money on land. This 
country is often infefted with vagrants of various defcrip- 
tlons, who, by threats or other wife, compel people to give

Ukewife pick up poultry, apparel, and what they can lay 
hold of. Their exadtions are oppreffive, their numbers 
often formidable, and it hurts the feelings of the humane to

cious courfes. It has been propofed to build a corrc£lion 
and work houfe for this fliire, and the fliire of Banff. The 
gentlemen of both counties have taken fome fleps to for- 
ward this laudable meafure, and all the families in the 
country have reafon to wifli them fuccefs. It is to be ho- 
ped, that the more public concerns of the nation will foon

I have heard it fometimes afferted, and never denied; 
that the nver Dee appears as large, and contains as much 
water at Kincardine, as here, or at the bridge of Dee a 
courfe of 24 miles, in which it receives confiderable addi- 
tions. This obfervation muft fuppofe, that the river is as 
rapid at Kincardine as it is here, or at the bridge of Dee ; 
and then it remains to be confidered, on what principle thJ 
faa is to be explained. SayJfome, on the principle of evapo- 
ration. But it is well known, that in the fame climate, 
the quantity of water evaporated in the fame time, is in 
proportion to the furface expofed ; and therefore the fame 
caufe would produce the fame efFeft in other rivers. As 
the Dee runs upon a gravelly and fandy bottom, it is pro- 
bable that fome of the water finks, and finds a fubterrane- 
ous paffage. 

At certain feafons, when the river is in a proper ftate, 
feveral rafts are floated down. The rafts are formed about 
7 or 8 miles above this. Farther up, fingle trees only can 
be floated down the river, becaufe of the rocks, flialiows, ' 
catara6ls, l^c. which occur. 

It has been obferved by others, that the river Dee fre- 
quently overflows the contiguous flats. In autumn 1789, 
the Haugh of Murtle, meafuring 26 Scots acres, was cover- 
ed with a deep current, and the whole crop, computed at 
more than 150 bolls of oats, was carried away by the river,, 
the firft night after it was cut down. The crop of this 
Haugh is often expofed to a fimilar fate. Some years ago, 
the late Mr Burnett of Counteflwells, and Captain Hen- 
derfon of Newton raifed an embankment, at their joint 
expence, acrofs the head of a Haugh, with a view to fecure 
their flats below. This work has been ufeful, but has not 
prevented the ravages of an high inundation. In the year 
1790, not only a part of the crop of the Haugh of Murtle 
was carried down, but alfo the crop of the Haugh of Cults, 

which

-which is below the embanrkment. About two miles below 
this Haugh, a good deal of corn was taken out of the river, 
:ared for, and ftacked ; it was claimed by the tenant, who 
poflefled a part of the Haugh of Cults, and whofe crop was 
then carried away ; but the man who faved the corn would 
not give it up. This was a fubjeft of litigation before the 
Sheriff, until the litigants found it expedient to terminate 
the difpute over a glafs. The latter part of the narrative 
may, perhaps, need an apology, becaufe it relates to ano- 
ther parifti. 

A long time fince, the river Dee had, for the fpace of a 
quarter of a mile, entirely fhifted its channel, a little be- 
low this church, and cut through a part of the eftate of 
Culter. F ormerly, the whole of that eftate, and of this pa- 
rilh, was fituated north of the river, which was the boun- 
dary. Now, a fmall farm, belonging to the eftate of Cul- 
ter, is fouth of the river. This farm is called the Infch, 
and had long been an ifland. Here is a falmon-fifliing, 
which yields about L. 40 Sterling of yearly rent. The 
old channel was lately very diflindl, but is now divided be- 
twixt the two neighbouring proprietors, and put into a ftate 
of cultivation. I cannot learn from record or tradition the 
exaft time when the courfe of the river was altered; but 
according to the beft information which I have got, it can' 
not be lefs than two centuries back. This had probably 
happened when a gentle thaw fucceeded a long and intenfe 
froft, when there was water enough to break and float the 
ice, but not enough to carry it over the fliallows ; at thefe 
it fticks and ftops the current, which recoils, and carries 
back the ice with amazing force and velocity ; the channel 
K crammed with fheets of ice ; many are thrown at fome 
diftance, and the water flufts its courfe. About 12 years 
fince, the ice was repelled in this manner up the river Dee 
^nd from it, up the burn of Culter, fo that it was thrown 

over

over tn J garden wan, 8 feet high, and 300 paces from the 
rjver. A thriving hedge, and fome thriving joung trees, 
were cruflied to the ground. 

Eels.-^A great number of young eels, of the common 
fpecies, make an annual proceffion up ahis river, which 
may be clafled .among thofe wonders with which nature 
abounds. Impreffed with the ideas which this phoenome- 
non at firft excited, I beg leave to give a fhort account of 
It. The time of their appearing varies according to the 
nature of the feafon, and the ftate of the river. It is fel- 
dom earlier than the middle of May, nor later than the 
middle of June. About 15 years ago, when I firft obferved 
them, they came in the firft week of June ; there was then 
fome flood in the river, and the eels kept near to the bank, 
and near the furface of the water. They proceeded in re- 
gular rows, clofe to each other, and 7 eels in a row. The 
arrangement and movement of the whole feemed to re- 
femble that order which is the efFedl of djfcipllne. They 
continued running three days. They were moft numerous 
the firft day ; fewer, almoft by one half, the fecond ; and 
on the third day, they came up only in a ftraggling man- 
ner. They were 9 inches long, and 3-4ths of an inch 
round. 

This year, (1794), the feafon being mild, and the river 
low, the eels made .their appearance 15th May-, but they 
were not above half the fize of the former, and lefs regu- 
lar in their ranking and moving. They continued to run 
four days, with fome intermiffipn on the i6th and 17th, 
but very numerous towards the evening of the i8th May. 
Many of them kept near to the edge of the river, efpecially 
where there is a rapid current ; but feveral feemed to be 
Scattered all over the breadth of the river: For this year I 
pbferyed more* go up the burn of Culter than I could dif- 

cern, 



of PetercuUer. 389 

cern In the river, the burn being always rapid, all of them 
muft keep clofe to the edge. Here it is necelTary to re- 
mark, that when they come to the mouth of a burn or ri- 
vulet, fo many fwim up thefe ftreams, and the reft proceed 
in their courfe up the river.. I ,am informed, that they can 
by inftina diftinguiOi thofe burns and rivulets which have 
their fource in Jakes, moraffes. of peat-moffes, from thofe 
ftreams which derive their chief fupply from fountains ; 
and that the latter are little frequented by them. They 
go up Culter burn in great numbers, and proceed up Leu- 
char burn, a branch of it, to the loch of Skene. They re- 
turn in harveft ; and the particular time of their regrefs 
varies likewife, according to the nature of the feafon. In 
different years it may be varioufly reckoned from the laft 
week of Auguft to the end of Ociober ; fome of them are 
at this time an ell in length. Thefe have probably conti- 
nued in the loch or burn more than one feafon, for their 
length in general does not exceed two feet. Tenants who 
live on the banks of a burn fometimes build a fiOi-garth, 
or dam, with an opening to receive a kind of ofter balket, 
or what they call an hofe-net for catching fifli. They catch 
fome trout and fome pike, but eels in great abundance, at 
the feafon of their returning to the fea, and fometimes 
cure them in large earthen jars, or in fmall calks for win- 
ter provifion. I have been told thatj in the beginning of 
fummer, the young eels are to be feen in the river in 
fhoals, filling the water, like the herring, from top to bot- 
tom j this I have never obferved. But when a ftrong flood 
and contrary wind retard their progrefs, many of them go 
up fmall rivulets, and more of them than would fill a 
buftiel or two are f. metimes colIe£led at the foot of a bank 
or precipice ; man;* of thefe cannot return to the river, 
and ferve for food t'. due a d other aquatics, or any pif. 
,c;vorous animals. For hke. caufes, the eels may be col/

lefted ;„ ,hi, manner, in dead water at the edge of the ri 

ver whteh probably gave rife to the opinion of their prt 
ceeding m fhoals. ^ 

Struck with the appearance of the eels when I firft ob- 
^rved them, I made an attempt to calculate what number 
intgh pafs m a daj. or in a feafon, and found it to be lefs 
than I at firft imagined. Having only made an obferva- 
tion or two, I am not fupplied with fufficient data for 
accuracy; but I /hall compute by my firft obfervation. 
Some affert that 2 eels, at leaft, pafs in one fecond : Say 3 
m 2 feconds, or 90 in a minute ; and there being 7 in a 
row, the number is 630 in a minute, or 37,800 in an hour; 
which, being doubled for both fides of the river, makes 
T 5,600 in an hour, or 1,814,400 in a natural day; the half 
4f which might be added for the fecond day, and an eight 
part more for the third day. Another conceit occupied 
my mmd, and that was, what number there might be at 
once betwixt this and the mouth of the river, a fpace of lo 
miles, fuppofing both fides of the river covered zs per ob- 
fervation firft, the ranks clofe, 7 in each rank, and each of 
them 9 inches long? But I fliall not tranfgrefs farther on 
the reader's patience with this theory or calculation. I 
fliall only remark, that the number which appears here 
muft be lefs than at fome diftance below this, becaufe fo 
many of them make their way up every rill and burn 
which runs into the river. 

It is fcarce neceflary to mention, that eels make a like 
annual proceffion up every river, water, and rivulet, which 
difembogues into the fea. 

Whimjical Bivifion of Parijhes. — Sometimes a part of a 
parilh lies on each fide of the river, although there be no 
bridge, and the communication by boat be frequently im- 
pradlicable. Generally the parifli-churches ftand on the 

banks 



of PetercuUer, 



391 



banks of the river, when it is the boundarj, and little at- 
tention has been paid to the convenience of the parifliioners. 
They had been built when Popery was the eftablifhed re- 
ligion, and care was taken that the clergy fliould not want 
fifh in time of Lent. 

Sometimes the church (lands in one of thf reraotefl cor- 
ners of the parifti. Mary Culter was lately an inltance of 
this, and the church was hard by the feat of the principal 
heritor. Dalmaik is another inftance ; but the church is 
at a confiderable diftance from the feat of the principal and 
only refiding heritor. The fituation of that church is pe- 
culiarly fingular. A narrow ftrip of the parifh runs down 
about a quarter of a mile to the N. E. betwixt the river 
and a wing of this parifli ; on the N. E. point of this ftrip 
the church and manfe are built. The minifter's peat-ftack, 
fome of his office-houfes, and the half of the glebe, are in 
this parilh ; the other half of the minifter's glebe is in his 
own parilh, and, as far as it extends to the weftward, takes 
in the whole breadth of that part of the pariih. Several 
of the parifhioners, in travelling the dired road to their 
own church, pafs through a part of this parifh. Some farms 
in Dalmaik and in Durris pay ftipend to the minifter of 
Banchory Ternan, and thefe farms are called Half Parijh, 
It would feem that the time was, when the parfon of Ban- 
chory poffeffed fuperior influence, and got a flice off'the 
living of his two neighbours. Some farms on the boun- 
dary of this parifti and Banchory Davinick pay ftipend to 
both minifters, and they too are called half-parifti. But 
there is a farm in this parifti, of an internal fituation, which 
pays ftipend to the minifter of Banchory Davinick. It is 
in the eftate, and near to the manfion-houfe of Culter, not 
above a mile and a quarter from our church, but nia'h to 
four miles from the church of Banchory, and on a different 
fide of the river. We have not records old enough to il- 

luftrate 



' 39^ Statijlkal Account 



luftrate the caufe of this annexation ; but I beg leave ti 
offer a conjefture. It had probably taken place during the 
eftablifhment of Popery, and the farm of Glaifterberry had 
then been in the pofleflion of a feudal baron, who, being 
accuftomed to command in the field, could not brook the 
control of a rigid ecclefiaftic. The clergyman of the pa- 
rifli had probably fummoned him to fatisfy for fome of- 
fence ; but the baron not deigning to fubmit to the ftrift- 
nefs of his difcipline, found means to get himfelf and his 
dependents put under the care of the neighbouring prieft. 
Hence, the ftipend received by the minifter of Banchory 
from the farm of Glaifterberry, is faid to be paid pro cnra 
animarum. A change of jurifdiftion, fimilar to this, has 
been lometimes efle£led in matters civil as well as eccle- 
fiaftical. It is well known, that when the family of Cro- 
marty fet up a rivalfliip to the family of Seaforth, they had 
influence enough with the Scotch Parliament to get a part 
of the fliire of Rofs detached, and formed into a new county,, 
now called the fliire of Cromarty. To caufes of a like na- 
ture it is, perhaps, owing, that the natural boundary of 
flbires, commiflTariots, l^c. has been altered, and that fome 
eftates, lying on the north fide of the river Dee, are now 
in the fliire of Mearns. 

The fame fpirit which I fuppofe to have actuated the ba- 
ron of Glaifterberry, is ftill predominant in many. Seve- 
ral years ago, a clergyman here gave a very general and 
gentle rebuke to a company, who came into church about 
the middle of the fermon. One of them was fo much affront- 
ed, that he never returned to his parifli-church, and has put 
himfelf under the care of another paftor. If he pofl'cfled 
influence, he would, no doubt, carry fome of the ftipend a- 
way with him too, and get his feceflion juftified by fanaion. 

I fear, that a democratical and levelling fpirit lurks m 
the breaft of too many. Of thofe who have any religion,

eadi family, or fmall number of families, if tliey could af- 
ford it, would have their own teachers ; and many of thofe 
who have little or no religion, would readily affent to th? 
abolition of the clerical order, if they could, like the French 
Convention, withdraw ftipend and payment for all forms 
of worfliip whatfoever. They would abolifli the common 
week, and fubftitute the conventional decade; apian of 
profit and of lofs, by which mafters do every year gain the 
labour of fixteen days, and fervants are deprived of as many- 
days of reft. The next ftep may be, to take away days of 
reft altogether. By a dafh of conventional authority, they 
have fubverted the law of order and fubordination, which 
is the law of heaven : They have annihilated the mutual 
obligations of mafter and fervant, parent and child, fove- 
reign and fubjed ; and thus they have oppofed the appoint- 
ment of God. For, although it be common with many in 
great towns, to laugh at the laws of their country, and the 
religion of their Maker, yet moft of us acknowledge the 
authority of the facred oracles, and we learn from them, 
that the " powers which be are appointed by God and 
we infer, that they are appointed for wife reafons : Among 
other reafons, for the following ; that the refpeft and obe- 
dience due to earthly mafters may be improved into reve- 
rence and refignation towards our Mafter in Heaven ; that 
the filial aff'edicus may rife into the warmeft gratitude, the 
moft entire confidence, and fupreme love towards the invi^ 
fible, the univerfal, and moft beneficent Parent; and that 
the loyalty and allegiance due to the lawful fovereigns of 
this world, may be advanced into unftiaken fidehty and 
entire fubmiffion to the Almighty Sovereign of all worlds, 
who wjil bring the Sovereignty of the people, as well as 
thrones and dominions, into fubjeftion under Him.

think, of inferiors rifing and ranking with themfelves. Of 
this clafs there are fome who rail againft the arbitrary mea-

Sometimes the cry is, " We have an expenfive govern- 
ment, a corrupt adminiftration, and a degenerating con- 
ftitution." With feveral perfons, thefe may be only 
words of courfe. They hear other men inveigh againft 
gbi'ernment, and they believe that any one may do the 
fame. But fuch language muft, on fome occafions, be con- 
fidered as a fjmptom of political difeafe, and an indication 
of revolutionary principles. It is juftly deemed bafe, and 
highly criminal to traduce a private perfon ; and I cannot 
Well comprehend how it has been thought fo innocent to 
malign thofe who bear offices of public trnft, dignity and 
importance. In the fair way of eftimating crimes, this 
ought to be branded as complicated guilt. Amongft other 
heinous tranfgreflbrs, who ore referred to the day of judg- 
vient to be punijhed, the Apoftle Peter mentions them who 
defpife government ; who defpife the authority of their go- 
vernors ; prefumptuous, or daring, and fclf willed, they are

.anthonty. The guilt is greatly aggravated by the tendenc/ 
of fuch language, and the efFeft which it produces ; fuch a» 
prejudices and unfavourable impreffions, a fpirit of difloy- 
alty and difcontent, which lead to fadion and confpiracy. 
All this the railers againft government have generally in 
view. Such perfons may aflume the name of patriots and 
friends of the people ; but they muft furnifti us with a new 
gloffary before we can underftand them. To the word 
patriot, we miift not affix the antiquated idea of one who 
is a lover, a difinterefted benefaftor of his country ; but we 
mull underftand by it, one who ftudies to embarrafs public 
nieafures, to oppofe or elude the laws, and fometimes to 
embroil the ftate. If we take our definition of patriots 
from that clafs of men on the continent, we muft add, they 
are thofe men who trample on the laws of 'equity, ajienat^ 
property from its rightful owners, feiz.e on public funds, 
transfer as much of them as they can to their own ufe, and 
apply the reft to the purpofes of murder, bribery, and lu- 
xury ; or, in other words, men who attempt to mlflead the 
people by fophifms and pompous founds, cajole them with 
vain hopes, and perfuade them to facrifice their fafety and 
peace, and to engage irt ravage and maffacre; men who 
would hurry multitudes of people out of the world, or 
make them miferable while they are in it, and all this to 
promote the interefted views of a junto y views of ambition 
and aggrandifement, perhaps of malice and refentment. 

They who complain fo much of the infolence of arifto- 
crates, and the dcfpotifm of rulers, ftiould confider what 
kind of rulers they are like to have, if the revolution, fo 
much defired, took place. In fermentations and ebullitions

purfue fuch rapacious, oppreffive, and bloody meafures, as 
muft ftiock any feeling heart. 

Amongft our felf-conceited politicians, another topic of 
declamation is, *' the folly of involving us in a war fo ex- 
" penfive and unneceflary, and fending troops to afll.ft the 
" Dutch, when they did not want our affiftance." That 
there are Jacobins and malecontents in Holland, as well as 
in Britain, needs not to be doubted ; one would even be 
led to think, that there were a correfpondence betwixt 
them, elfe how could the fentiments of the Dutch have 
been known fo well and fo early aniongft us ? Thefe gentle- 
men will not pretend, however, to have been admitted into 
the fecret counfels of the two cabinets ; nor can they affirm, 
that the Dutch governmetit did not want our affiftance. By 
their fending an army into the field, to co-operate with us 
and the other allies, they gave an irrefragable proof of the 
contrary. It has been fliown by writers on, the fubjed, 
that we were bound by treaty to defend them. We were 
called to do it by a principle of common honefty. Befides, 
to defend the Dutch was, in effe6l, to defend ourfelves, ac- 
cording to that well known naaxim of antiquity, 

Nam tua res agitur, paries cum proxiraus ardet: 
Et negledla foleiu incendia fumere vires. 

When your next neiglibonr's houfe is all a flame. 
If you negledl it, yours will be the fame. 
Fires neglecfted increafing ftrength acquire; 
Cities tlicy fack, and level the lofty fpire. 

When a neighbour's houfe or his field is on fire, one 
ought to do all he can to extinguiffi it, for the fafety of his 
own. If the next houfe is in danger of fire, he ought to 
do all in his power to prevent it. This is fuggt fted to us 
by the general principle of felf-prefervalion. It is the die 
tate of common policy and of common fenfe. The Dutch 

navy, 



StatijHcal Account 



navy, and naval ftores, would be a great acqulfition to the 
French; the Dutch failors would be a much greater; and 
Britain ought to make every exertion in order to prevent 
their getting fuch an acceffion to their marine. 

Thofe perfons who exclaim fo vehemently againft the 
prefent war, do juftly expofe themfelves to the fufpicion of 
being republicans and jacobins. They feem to be out of 
temper that their views have been fo long difappointed; 
If we had not gone to war with France if the alien bill 
had not pafled ; if our fleets and forces had not beert 
vigilant, Britain had, before now, fwarmed with French 
jacobins. Before this time we had beheld, many of us had 
experieticed, the like tragical events, the like ihftances of 
rapine and barbarity, of confufion and carnage, which have 
been exhibited on the continent. Writers on the fubjeft 
are clearly of this perfuafion. But the declaimers them- 
felves need no proof; they have the molt fatisfadlory in- 
formation, they have entire conviftion in their own breads; 
Here, it is not to be forgotten, that after the French had 
proceeded fo far in the reform of their government ; after 
affaffinationS and malfacres were committed^ and commo- 
tions prevailed throughout the kingdom, one of our Sena- 
tors, one of thefe called Men of the Peoplcj faid in the: 
Houfe of Commons, that " our miniftry ought to take ad- 
" vantage of the diftradled ftate of France ;" a fpeech which 
plainly infinuated our going to war. The fpeeches of the 
fame gentleman now abound with bitter inveftive againft 
the prefent war, which was not commenced on our partj 
until our allies were attacked, and we ourfelves daringly 
threatened ; was not commenced until war became una- 
voidable, unlefs we were tamely to give up every thing 
valuable to us as Britons, and dear to us as men and Chri- 
ftians.

It is caufe of regret, that the war has proved fo difaftrous, 
and that many of our difafters are to be afcribed to the 
bafenefs of traitors among ourfelves, who give to the ene- 
my all the intelligence and aid in their power. We may- 
be perfuaded, that feveral of our fliips, in the lift of cap- 
tures, have been freighted with warlike ftores and provi^ 
fions for the enemy's ufe, and have purpofely thrown 
themfelves in the way of French cruifers. It is hard to 
fay what fuccefs they may have in alluring our failors into 
jtheir fervice ; but we know, that by want, bad bread, and 
bad treatment, they have brought many of them to their 
grave. It is treafon to take part with the enemies of the 
King and the nation, or to aid them in the manner now- 
mentioned. To pray for fuccefs to them, or to pray againft 
the fuccefs of our own troops, if it be not a degree of trea- 
fon, does certainly come very near to it. It fhews that 
there is abundance of treafon in the heart, and in the 'm- 
tention. People do hereby ftiow the ftrongeft inclination 
to fide with the enemy, and that nothing but want of 
power and opportunity prevents them from doing it. One 
is furprifed to find an orator pleading publicly before a moft 
venerable Court, in behalf of fuch petitioners ; and gloff- 
ing their prayers as mere willies that a junto would not 
prevail againft France. Qf that junto Britain is a part. • 
In the laft feffion of Parliament fome fpeakers reprefented 
it as the principal. It is now like to ftaad fingle in the 
conteft ; and therefore to pray for fuccefs to the French 
or to pray that Britons may not prevail, is nothing lefe 
than praying, that the Britifti throne be pulled down, and 
the Britifti conftitution levelled in the duft ; that Britain 
may become a feftion of the French republic, one and 
divided, and thus be enflaved to the moft arbitrary and exe- 
crable tyranny that ever exifted. "

Loud alfo are the complaints againfl: manifold and enor. 
mous taxes, which are faid to be /jig/jfy opprejjive. 

Thefe complainers Ihould confider, that unlefs mankind 
were to roam like the beafts of the defert, there mull be 
government, and government muft have a decent fupport. 
Thus is the neceffitj of taxes fixed. As a nation improves 
in arts and manufaftures ; as it extends its commerce and 
empire, in that proportion the expence of government in- 
creafes, and taxes muft be multiplied ; but the nation ha- 
ving become richer, is abler to pay them. When the ru^ 
lers and the public fervants of a great nation can appear 
with fuitable dignity at home and abroad, that nation be- 
comes refpeftable in the eyes of foreign powers ; refpedl 
and fafety are fecured even to its fubjeds. 

Amidfl: the extravagant murmurs which have been heard 
againfl taxes, what is become of boafted patriotifm ? By 
"true patriotifm we are taught to make great facrifices to 
the public good ; — i-to facrifice eafe, power, pleafure, and 
wealth, in order to maintain the rights, to promote and 
defend the honour and happinefs of our country. There- 
fore, grumbling muft, in this cafe, betray a felfifti and for- 
did fpirit, — a fpirit too much enflaved to mammon. — Even 
when taxes have rifen to exorbitance, and may be confider-. 
ed as a grievance, we are diredted to fubmit : " Ye muft 
f« needs be fubjed, not only for wrath, but for confcie^ce 

fake," — not only for fear of puniftimcnt from man, but 
out of obedience to God. " For this caufe, ye pay tri- 
" bute alfo," l^c. Rom. xiii. 5, 6. " Indeed," fays the 
fame Apoftle, *' there is altogether a fault among you, 
** that }'e have contefts with each other : Why do ye not 
« rather fuffer wrong ?" He condemns their having quar- 
rels wit-. eac - other at all, w ether they went to law or 
not. Much more would he condemn infurreftion, violence 
and depredation. He upbraids them that they did not ra- 
^ ther 



&amp;f Peterculter. 401 

tlier fuffer wrong. " All men," lays a writer on this paf- 
fage, " cannot receive this faying, or will not receive it. 
" Many aim only at the obfervance of this rule, / will 
*' neither do wrong, nor fuffer wrong. Thefe may be ho- 
*' fteft heathens, but no Chriftians." It were well, how- 
ever, if people would abftain from doing wrong : They 
would be lefs expofed to the fulFering of wrong. Our re- 
ligion does herein give us an effential leffon of prudence. 
For it is certainly much better to pay a few fliillings more 
yearly, than to facrifice peace, public and private, — than to 
hazard the life, property and happinefs, of many thoufands. 
PerCons who pretend to be Chriftians, flioiild know fome- 
thing of the value of a human foul. Some authors have 
faid, that in worth it outweighs worlds. Its happinefs, then, 
is not to be fported with, nor to be wantonly endangered 
for mere trifles. It is no light matter to be the caufe of 
murder and bloodQied They who do not acknowledge 
facred writ, may learn from hifl:ory, and from their own 
obfervation, how awfully that threatening has been veri- 
fied, " He that ilieddeth man's blood, by man fliall his 
" blood be flied." But to be the caufe of precipitating in- 
to eternity, thoufands and ten thoufandd of immortal fouls, 
whether prepared or unprepared, is a degree of enormity 
and guilt too great for us to eftimate. The French have 
tried to procure themfelves a temporary relief from the 
bitternefs of thefe reflexions, by rejeaing the principles 
and fears of religion. 

If people would confider the ravages and defolations, the 
miferies and diftrefles, which follow in the train of infur- 
reclion and rebellion, they would pay the taxes and live 
in quietnefs : Th.y would retrench fome expences in drefs 
and table, or apply an hour or two more, each day, to their 
lawtul occupation ; rather than indulge a fpnit of envy and 
difcontent, the fource of dmoyalty,-the lource often of

bitter malice and revenge againd legal government. Of 
thefe it may be faid, more juftly than in the inftance in 
which the expreflion was lately applied by a popular ora- 
tor, that they draw every thing into their vortex. No prin- 
ciple is ftrong enough to oppofe their force, no horrors are 
fo ghaftly as to reftrain their violence. If private revenge 
be juftly condemned as bafe, unmanly and wicked ; re- 
venge of a public nature, revenge againft eftablifhed go- 
vernment, muft be much more criminal : For who can li- 
mit its pernicious tendency, or fay how far its dire^l ef- 

fefts may reach ? Contingencies often oblige rulers to ^ 

increafe the public taxes ; fuch as wars, conflagrations, na- 
tional loffes and calamities, l£c. The inconfiftence of thofe 
who exclaim againft taxes, and with the fame breath wifti 
fuccefs to the French, muft excite indignation ; becaufe the 
longer the French are fuccelsful, the longer muft the war 
be continued and taxes be increafed. But I truft, that in 
Great Britain, the true lovers of their country are moft" 
numerous, by a very great majority ; and what has a vir- 
tuous and refolute majority to fear ? They will fpend the 
laft farthing which they can afford, they will fpend the laft 
^•»rlc of life, and fell it dear, rather than fubmit to the 
French. If French principles, political and religious, pre- 
vailed, this world, to any good perfon, would not be worth 

the living in. One's indignation muft likewife be rai- 

fed at hearing of a popular orator introducing into his po- 
litical harangues, either as a pattern or an apology for the 
feditious, the effufions of Mr Burke's enthufiafm relating 
to America. Many men, as wife as Mr Burke, have been 
in error, and have retraced. The Americans, perhaps, 
have no great caufe now to thank Mr Burke, or any who 
then favoured their caufe. But America is at prefent out 
of the queftion. The French Revolution carries a very 
different afpeft. Mr Burke has publiihed to the world hia 

fentiments

Sentiments on this fubjeft, and it were better to bring them 
into the view of malecontents, than his extravagant rhap- 
fodies on American fuccefs. Many of the Americans are 
now ripe for another revolution, and the orator will cer- 
tainly be on the fide of the infurgents. They are contend- 
ing for liberty. Between their ideas, and the ideas of 
French republicans, there is a ftrong aflbciation. One 
would almoft pronounce them infpired by the fame demon. 
The taxes brought America into my mind. I have heard 
it mentioned in company, that the Americans paid five 
times or ten times more taxes now than formerly : And it 
was anfwered by fome violently attached to them, " What 
« then? they have themfelves the power of impofing thefe 
taxes,"--a very difputable point ; but let it be granted 
and It IS affigning the fame reafon for their conduft. that is

in a trice, and to any extent the Convention thought pro- 
per. In the Auftrian Netherlands, which they lately in- 
vaded, young men were required to make roads and canals. 
Six thoufand girls were put under requifition, to attend 
their lick foldiers. In confequence of this requifition, fome 
thoufands of children may appear in proper time, and they 
will no doubt be claimed as the property of the Republic. 
They will be dedicated to Mars, and taught to celebrate 
the rites of the French idol Virility. But this is not all ; 
men, horfes and waggons, were put under requifition, to 
carry all the valuable property of the invaded country to 
Paris. — In fhort, what is the French army, but a multitude 
of lawlefs armed tax-gatherers, or oppreffive free hooters ? 
They nrft plunder to clothe and feed, and enrich them- 
felves^iand then they are ordered to lay heavy contribu- 
tions on the conquered towns and territories, to enable the 
Convention to profecute their levelling and bloody plans, 
or to fupport their extravagant luxury. For it has been 
?ifferted on good authority, and many will readily believe 
it, that Parifian luxury, formerly without parallel, has now 
rifen to a moft gigantic height. 

It may be alleged, that thefe extraordinary methods are 
at firll neceffary, but a milder fyftem will be foon adopted. 
Believe it not. It is againfl experience, againft the doc- 
trine of habits, againft the love of power, fo natural to the 
human mind ; and againft our knowledge of French men, and 
French manners. They will continue the fame arbitrary, in- 
folent, rapacious depredators, till it fliall pleafe Providence to 
overturn their prefent fyfiem. It is enough to ftiock a 
ferinus mind to hear of the abfurd and wild conceits, ex- 
prefled by modern patriots and malecontents. If we pro-

ceiTors to judge for us, or to chufe a political conftitution 
for us? — Such querifts ought to be reminded, that of thefe 
impertinent inquiries there is no end, till they arrive at 
that impious one. What right hadjfhe Supreme Being to 
call them into exiftence, or to determine the place of their 
habitation ? They forget that they are as clay in the hands 
of the potter. If thofe who preceded them had no right 
to chufe. a form of government for them, as little right 
have they to chufe one for their fucceflbrs ; fo that every 
generation might claim the right of chufing their own form, 
of government. Thus, in every period of 30 or 40 years, 
this point muft be agitated and determined. Any perfoa 
who can refledl, may ealily forefee what would be the con- 
fequence, amidft the various opinions, the various views 
and attachments of mankind, amidfl: interfering interefts, 
and oppofite p^lans and purfuits, fuch political quarrels and 
ftruggles muft arife, as would haften the extin6lion of the 
human race. 

Suppofe a forward inexperienced youth has fucceeded 
to the eftate of a father, who, after confulting the bell jud- 
ges, and procuring the beft plans, had been at pains to build 
a proper, commodious, and fubftantial houfe for his heir ; 
inftead of being pleafed with the father's folicitude and at- 
tention, the conceited youth exclaimed. What a fool ! to 
pretend to plan and build a houfe for him. He refolves to 
pull it down, and to build another to his own liking. A 
neighbour of prudence and experience came and expoftula- 
ted with him ; told him, that although the houfe did not 
entirely correfpoud to his ideas, it was convenient and com- 
fortable, and might with a few alterations be much impro- 
ved, perhaps might be made fufceptible of elegance and 
grandeur ; if he pulled it down, he might be buried in the 
ruins, or while he reared a new fabric, the fcaffolding night 
give way, and he be cruflied to pieces. But all the cala- 
mities 



4C6 ' Statijlical Account 



mities which can happen in this inftance, afford no ade- 
quate reprefentation of the inexpreffible ills which muft 
proceed from any violent attempt to pull down an old, and 
rear up a new fabric of a political conftitution. If the old 
Conftitution be juftly held in veneration, the dangers ex- 
ceed calculation, the difficulties are almoft infurmountable, 
unlefs the people who live under it have become quite 
venal, worthlefs and degenerate. 

I do not mean to apply the foregoing remarks to the 
people of this pariOi, or any part of the neighbourhood  
but when I go about through the country, I am frequently 
told that the French have many friends amongft us; and 
I fometimes hear complaints and grievances repeated. 
Thus my apprehenfions may, perhaps, be too much awa- 
kened. After all, I affirm, that if there be 50 perfons in a 
ftiire difaffeded to Government, and attached to French po- 
litics and French principles, that is too great a number ; 
becaufe pernicious principles often fpread as quickly as any 
infedion ; and in matters relating to our beft interefts, here 
and hereafter, there ffiould be but one mind, and that ma- 
nifefted by the united energy of the whole nation. No- 
thing fliould appear, but a jioble and virtuous emulation, 
who fliall be foremoft in ferving their country. 

If it flaall pleafe Providence to reftore peace to us, if the 
alien bill be repealed, and a free intercourfe be opened with 
France, the friends of Britain, and of Britifh privileges, 
cannot have too ftrid an eye on thofe who have given 
caufe to fufped their loyalty. Democratical orators, who 
wifti to find the greateft part of the nation fools, or to make 
them fuch, will tell us, there is no danger that French 
principles prevail in Britain. Orators fometimes argue and 
fpeak againft conviction. Thefe gentlemen, perhaps, do 
themfelves know, where Britons of Fi-ench principles are 
to be found, and fhrewdly conjeClure that many more

would avow them if a favourable opportunity offered. 
French principles are too flattering to many claffes of peo- 
ple; to the young and the ignorant, the difloyal and diffo- 
lute, the ambitious and thofe of defperaie fortunes, to the ' 
idle and the indolent, who hate to earn a fubfiftence by 
lawful induftry, and would wifli to fee plunder authorifed 
as in France. Such charafters are to be found in too many 
places •, perfons who would readily profcribe our nobility, 
gentry and clergy, and eagerly feize on their property. It 
may not be improper, therefore, to renew an old advice : 
" Let no price or promife bribe you to take part with the 
" enemies of your King and country. Whoever wins, you 
" are loft. If your Prince profper, you are proclaimed 
** rebels, and muft expeft the confequence. If the enemy 
" prevail, you will be reckoned traitors, and though your 
•* treafon be accepted, you will be hated, fufpefted and 
*• defpifed." 

I have touched the outlines of fome of the topics of the 
day. They have been difcuffed with ability in Principal 
Campbell's Sermon on the American War, in Dr Hardy's 
Patriot, and Dr Young's Effays on Government, ^r. It 
2S a pity that thefe publications are fo little confulted or 
perufed with fo much prejudice. Thofe who write on 
that fide, are often branded with the epithets, minijierial 
tools, court Sycophants, the flaves of defpots, S/c. But men 
ought to liften to reafon, to weigh evidence, and regard 
truth, from what quarter foever they come ; and not aban- 
don themfelves to paff.on, refentment and prepoffeffxon, 
which hmder us from difcerning what is right and fit, ei! 
ther refpedlmg ourfelves or others. A paflionate and re-

founds the ideas of juftice, changes humanity into crueltyy 
and all order into confufion. It is in vain, therefore, to af- 
fert, that the people of Britain are incapable of the barba- 
rities perpetrated in France. The contrary is well known. 
Political rage, the love of power, and thirft of lucre, trans- 
form men into favage monfters. The engaging timidity 
of the fair fex is loft in more than mafculine hardinefs ; 
the ufe of the cudgel is fubftituted for the exercife of the 
fan ; and their mufical accents converted into hedoring 
vpciferations. 

To conclude : After confidering French principles and 
politics, as explained by their praftice, the beft interpreter j 
after contemplating their views of univerfal depredation 
and felf aggrandizement ; I rauft conclude, that it were 
better for every Briton able to bear arms, to ftep forward 
in defence of our invahiable privileges, and refolutely die 
in the ftruggle, than fubmit to the French. It were 
better for pofterity that Great Britain were turned into a 
defart, and they forced to feek an afylum among untutored 
Indians, than become a fedion of the French Republic. 
Thefe fentinients may be thought unbecoming the clerical 
charader. I do not think it. All Chriftians are exprefsly 
required to lay down their lives, rather than renounce their 
religion ; and where can we lay them down more proper- 
ly than in the field, againft the enemies of truth, who bring 
in deftruftive herefies, denying the Lord that bought them? 
The fpirit of the gofpel is indeed the fpirit of peace, but it 
is at the fame time the fpirit of heroifm.

Short Account of the Orkney IJlands. 

^ I^HE Orkney iflands were originally governed by their 
own kings, as we are informed by hiftorians, and bj 
the poet Offian, of ftill greater antiquity. Thefe iflands 
having been fubdued by King Kenneth Macalpin, about the 
middle of the ninth century, continued from that period 
annexed to the Scottifli throne, until the end of the eleventh 
century, when they were alFigned by King Donald Bane 
to the King of Norway, to whom they were fubjeft until 
the middle of the thirteenth century ; when they were 
Uansferred by Magnus King of Norway to Alexander 
Vox. XVI, 3^

King of Scotland. But akhough thefe iflands ivefe tl/us 
ceded, the Norwe,^Ians ftill afferted their right to them, 
and often poffeffed ' them, until the year 1470, wheit 
James III. of Scotland married Margaret, daughter to the 
King of Denmark, with whom they again paffed to the 
Crown of Scotland, in lieu of her dowry ; and upon the 
birth of her fon (James IV.) they were finally ceded ; 
which was afterwards confirmed, when James VI. of Scot- 
land married Ann daughter of the King of Denmark. 
Thefe iflands having been fo long' and repeatedly in the 
poffeffion of the Danes and Norwegians, many of the 
names of places and perfons are derived from the DaniHi. 
or Scandinavian language. 

Ncwie and Situation — Stromnefs and Sandwick are 
names to be found in Sweden, Denmark, and Iceland. 
The firft of thefe may derive its name from StroiUy or 
Strau?n, and Nefs ; this lad meaning an extended point of 
land, and Strom the ftrong tide off that point. The parifh 
of Sandwick, as. well as the parilh of the fame name in the 
Shetland ifles, of a fimilar fituation, may derive its name 
from SandzxiA Wick, as there is a fandy bay on the weft 
lide of this parifh, Wick fignifying a bay or inlet of the 
fca. The centre of thefe parifhes lies in latitude 58^ 59' ; 
on the weft end of the ifle of Pomona, or mainland, late 
the biflioprick, now the ftewartry and county of Orkney, 
in the S^nod and County of Orkney, and in the prefby- 
tery of Cairfton j and Stromnefs is the feat of the faid pref- 
bytery. 

Thefe pariflies are bounded by the parifb of Birfay on 
the N. ; by the loch of Stennefs on the E. by the channel 
of Hoy Sound on the S. ; and by the Atlantic Ocean on 
the W. Mr Murdoch Mackenzie furveyed the fea coafts 
of thefe pariflies in 1740 or 1741. 



of Sandwick and Stromnejs. 411 



Tigiire and Extent. — The parifli of Sandvviek is nearly 
-circular, and indented on the eaft by the loch of Stennefs. 
The fcene which this parifti prefents to the eye is, that of 
arable ground, interfperfed with grafs grounds of a lively 
green, and here and there we meet with barren breaks,, 
ftony and exhaufted, which have been ftripped of their foil, 
either for fuel, or to enrich and manure thefe pleafant cul-. 
tivated fpots. The raolTes having been exhaufted, and 
jnoft of the hills ftripped of their verdure, it may be pre- 
fumed this pariih has been long inhabited. 

The parifti of Stromnefs is of an irregular figure. On 
' the weft fide, fronting the Atlantic Ocean, is a chain of 
hills. It Hopes towards the fouth ; and all along the chan- 
nel of Hoy Sound is a traft of fertile fields, agteeably in- 
terfperfed with grafs and arable grounds. From this part 
of the parifti, there is a view which has a good deal of the 
fublime in it ; the mountains of Hoy, and fometimes a caf- 
cade of water from thefe mountains ; to the weftward of 
which appear the hills of Strathnaver, and thofe as far as 
Farouthead and Cape Wrath. Thefe, with the vaft At- 
lantic Ocean, form a fcene pidurefque and fublime, which 
is heightened when the fouth-weft wind blows ftrong, 
which leads diredly from the Atlantic Ocean. It is this 
wind which blows with the greateft violence here, and 
makes the greateft fea. The poet Virgil's defcription of 
this wind might well apply to this place, 

'■ Grebe rque procellis, 
Africus, et vaRos volvit, ad littora fludus*. 

The fertile pleafant fields of this part of the parifti, and 
the fublime profpeft, induced George Graham, the laft 
Bifhop of Orkney, to build a houfe here, where he refided 

-fome

fome pan of the year. This houfe is yet ftandlng. Tlic 
epifcopal arms, and the date of the year in which it was 
built f 1633), are cut in free ftone above the door. 

Thefe pariilies were never furveyed with a view to af- 
Certain the precife number of acres which they contain. 
Mr Murdoch Mackenzie principally direfted his attention 
to the feaicoafts, which he has delineated with great exaft- 
nefs. It may be prefumed, however, that his map is as 
near the truth, with regard to the real extent of thefe pa- 
rifties, as any idea we can form. By his map it appears, 
that thefe pariflies are 9 Englifh miles long, and from 2f 
to 5t miles broad. If we fix 3^ miles as the mean breadth, 
•which cannot be far from the truth, then thefe pariflies 
.contain 314 fquare miles, which, at 640 acres to the fquarc 
mile, will be in whole 20,160 Englifti acres. 

Sea Coajls. — The whole weft coaft of thefe pariflies, ex- 
cepting the Sandy Bay in the parifli of Sandwick, are bold 
and elevated, riling perpendicularly from 100 to 400 or 
500 feet in height •, which, together with the mountains of 
Hoy, make it eafy to the mariner to diftinguifli this coaft. 

The mountains of Hoy are feen from Cape Wrath, which 
lies diftant from Hoy 17 leagues. Along the weft coaft of 
thefe pariflies, at one league's diftance from the fliore, there 
is 40 or 50 fathoms depth of water. There are no flioals 
in the channel of Hoy Sound, on the fide next thefe pa- 
riflies, but two i which may be avoided by keeping two 
cable lengths from the fliore ; one of thefe ftioals is vihble 
at two hours ebb. As the coaft can be feen at a great di- 
ftance, and there are no flioals but thefe two, which are not 
dangerous, there are confequently few veflels wrecked on 
the f a coafts of theie pariflies. The velocity of the fpring 
ti4es in Hoy Sound is 7 miles in the hour ; that of neap 
t;des 3 mile?, It is high or flack water in Hoy Sound at 



qfSandwick and Stromnefs. 413 

10 o'clock, on the days of new and full moon, and in the 
harbour of Stromnefs at 9 o'clock. The flood fets from 
the N. W. An hour before flood is perceived in the chan- 
nel of Hoy Sound, a ftream fets from the north, along the 
weft coafts of thefe parifhes, keeping this fide of the Sound, 
and continues in this direftion ; at half ebb another ftreara 
fets from the fouth, along the fouth fide of the Sound, and 
continues till high water. Thefe ftreams, when known and 
attended to, help to facilitate the entrance of fhipping into 
the harbour of Stromnefs. This harbour lies at the fouth 
or fouth-eaft extremity of the parifh. The entry to it is 
from the fouth, and is about a quarter of a mile broad. 
There is a fand hank at the entry, on the weft fide, which 
is not dangerous. Two fmall iflands or holms lie on the 
eaft fide of the harbour. It is well flieltered from the weft 
and north winds, by a hill that rifes above the village of 
Stromnefs, and ftretches along the harbour on that fide. 
There can be no fea in this harboiir with the north-eaft 
winds, as it is land-locked on that fide, and the violence of 
the fea, with foutherly winds, is broken by Hoy and other 
iflands, which fence it from the feas that lead from the 
German Ocean into the Pentland Frith. It affords fafe 
anchorage, although the ground has becbme rather oozy, 
from being much ploughed. The ftreams which run into 
it, carrying mud along with them, have made it more flial- 
low than formerly it was. There is little or no tide in it. 
It is not a mile long, and not half a mile in breadth. Vef- 
fels of I coo tons burden may anchor in it. A fliip of war 
of 40 guns has anchored here, and had fuflScient depth of 
water. Although it is fmall, this is one of the fafeft har- 
bours to be found along the north coaft of Britain, being 
ilieltered by high lands on the one fide, and on the other 
i&amp;de by iflands :

Very large velTels ufually anchor in Cairfton roa^, with- 
tmt the fmall ifland or holm, that bounds the harbour on 
the eaft. fide, where there is alfo very good anchorage 
greater depth of water, and more fpace ; but there is tide 
here, greater fea, and it lies more open and expofed. The 
ebb tide, with a wefterly wind, makes a very rough fea 
near the coaft, efpecially at the top of fpring tides, and is 
called the rojl. The weft coaft of thefe parifties ftretch 
iiearly in a ftraight line from north to fouth. The extent 
of the fea coaft of thefe parifties is about 18 miles. 

Soil — The foil of thefe parilhes is various. In fomc 
places a black earth, mixed with fand, prevails ; in other 
places a ftiff clay; black earth alone is found in fome 
places •, in others, clay mixed with fand. In the hills of 
Stromnefs parifli there is a great mixture of fand. The 
hill that rifes above the village of that name, is covered 
with a great number of ftones and rocks of a granite kind, 
which prefents a very rough and barren appearance ; but 
when thefe ftones and rocks are removed, the foil, although 
ihallow, is pretty fertile. On the weft fide of the pariftl 
of Sandwick, near the Sandy Bay, there is a good deal of 
fandy foil, and an extenfive rabbit-warren, which liesnorth- 
eaft from the Bay. This fandy foil has probably been 
blown from the Sandy Bay, as tJie fouth-weft winds are the 
moft violent, and it lies in the direction of thefe winds. 
The right to the rabbits of this warren is claimed by one 
heritor, and determined in the courts of law to belong to 
him alone, although there are feveral heritors who have 
arable and grafs grounds here, interfperfed with thofe of 
, the

ttie heritor having the esdufiVe right to the rabbits. There 
is" alfo what maj be c&amp;lled perpetual foil in thefe parillies, 
fince it has been cultivated, and has produced crops of bear, 
without intermiffion, for 50 years, neither fallow nor green 
crops- intervening. If, with this management, it produces 
crops fufficient to reward the farmer's toil, what might be 
expefted from it, if permitted, to reft ? but neither example 
or perfuafion will convince the farmer of this, nor even the 
fweet Mantuan bard's obfervation, 

Nec ulla interea eft inaratEe gratia terrx*. 

Clvnate — The air is often raw and damp, In the foutI- 
ern extremity of the pariffi of Stromnefs, along the chan- 
nel of Hoy Sound, it is, perhaps, not fo raw as in other 
parts of this county; the mountains of Hoy attraft the 
clouds, -fo that it often rains on that fide of the channel, 
when the inhabitants on this fide enjoy clear weather! 
The vicinity of thefe hills, by attrafting the clouds and 
vapours, probably produces a quicker circulation, as well as 
a purer ftate of the air, on this fide of the channel, which is 
Gonducive both to health and vegetation.

vail- in Winter arid fpring, efpecially in rainy feafons, when 
the air is not purified by froft, and when long trads of

years ; a few are to be found of the age of 80 years ; but 
very few arrive at 90 years. A farmer in the parifti of 
Stromnefs died laft fpring in the 94th year of his age, who 
was married to one woman 69 years, who bore to him 8 
fons. She is % years younger than her huftand, and is ftill 
alive. This man, till within two years of his death, went 
as ufual about his affairs, cut and brought home his peats, 
and ftiot with his gun. ,He was regular and temperate in 
his life, and retained his faculties to the laft. The oldeft 
man in the parifli of Sand wick is 88 years old. There are 
in the parifli of Stromnefs two men of 86 years, one wo- 
man of 90 years, and one of 92 years. There are feveral 
paft 80; but it is not unfrequent, that when they pafs that 
period, their memory decays, and their faculties are im- 
paired. 

Hills, tales, Mojfes. — A great part of the weft coaft of 
thefe pariflies confifl:s of hills, occupying an extent of nearly 
5 miles in length, and 1 or 2 miles in breadth. Some of 
thefe hills take their name from the next inhabited town 
©f land; others are diftinguiflied by particular names, ma- 
ny of which terminate in fiold, which means hill. The 
names are Cringliefiold, Baillifiold, Keirfiold. This laft is 
a fmall hill, in the parifli of Sandwick, very beautiful and 
pleafant, rifing with a gentle afcent it is about a mile and 
a half in circumference, is always covered with a green 
verdure, and affords good pafture to flieep. It is peculiar, 
however, to the ftieep that feed upon this hill, that their 
teeth foon become yellow. There are two or three fmall 
lochs, but no moffes in the parifli of Sandwick ; there are 
two fmall moffes in the parifli of Stromnefs, but no lochs. 

Cultivated and uncultimted Grounds.— As there has ne-

riflies, if it is delired to know the number of cultivated acres, 
it muft be fupplied from conje£lure, which probably in this 
cafe is not far from the truth. -A plough turns from 4 to 14 
Orkney planks *. The medium may be about 8 Orkney 
planks arable ground to each plough. The iniield and out- 
field grafs, exclufive of hiil-pafture, may be about as much, 
or rather more. From the beft conjefture that can be 
formed on this fubje£l, the divifion of thefe parilhes in 
cultivated and uncultivated grounds is as follows : 

Acres. 

Arable ground, 227 ploughs, at acres to each 

plough, - - - 2116 

Arable fpots cultivated about the village of Strom- 
nefs, - - - 30

Two fmall lochs in the parifh of Sandwick, 640 
Hills and uncultivated grounds, - 14,158 



Total, 20,l6o 

Thus it appears, that the arable ground is not one-ninth 
part of the whole, and that the grafs-grounds are only one- 
eighth part of the wliole extent ; that two-thirds of the 
whole confifls of uncultivated hills and brakes, of no ad- 
vantage but to give a little fuel, and pafture about 2000 
fheep:

parts of this county. In holding this plougli, t!ie plough- 
man bends to the foil, and may well be denominated cur- 
vus arator, as Virgil does the Roman ploughman. - The 
two ftilted plough is ufed by a few, which anfwers bcft for 
tilling oat-land, and the other for tilling bear-land. They 
till with three horfes abreaft ; fome till with two horfes i, 
but few till witl\ four horfes* Oxen are little ufed in til- 
lage, but they are ufed for harrowing, and carting peats. 
Harrov/s with wooden teeth are for the mod part ufed \ 
a few ufe Iron -teethed harrows. Crebris infeBahere rajlris, 
is an injun6lion which the farmers here do not much pracr 
tice, as they think the foil cannot bear much harrowing, 
and that it produces a fhort light crop. They till rather 
fhallow, and rely more on the quantity of manure than on 
any thing elfe, for raifing a good crop. Fallowing is rarely 
or not at all ufed by the fmall farmers. The firft relieving 
heritor, William Wall, Efq; fallows a proportionable 
quantity of his farm yearly, and confequently raifes grain 
of a fuperior quality ; he is alfo making inclofures. On 
the upland farms, diftant from the manure of fea-weed, a 
fpot of half an acre oii each farm is laid lea, which they 
plough before or after harveft, and fow it with bear the 
following year ; but as the weeds have generally flied 
their feeds before this ploughing, it can be of little advan- 
tage. This, however, is all the reft the land has. 

Rotation of CrQps.-~\i there was a proper rotation" of 
crops, the land might receive fome reft by this means y 

" Sic quoque miltatis rtquiefcunt factrbus arva*." 

But the conftant rotation of crops, is that of oats and bear 
in alternate fucceffion. Some fpots have yielded crops of 

bear

bear yearly, without a change of crop, for 50 year?. No 
peafe or turnip are raifed, but; by the firft refiding heritor 
already mentioned. A fmall fpot on each farm is planted, 
with potatoes, of which nor»3 were planted 50 years ago j 
but they now conftitute a principal part of food. 

Carts. — There were no carts here 50 years ago. They 
are now getting into ufe. They are fometimes drawn by 
ft lingle horfe, but more frequently by oxen. The number 
of carts is,

S^ed-time and Harvejl. — Oats are fown in March, and 
l;he firft of April. Bear is ufually fown from the ift to 
the 20th day of May. The fummer is employed in pre- 
paring fuel, and carrying home peats. The crop is reaped 
from the 'loth Auguft, and if the feafon is favourable, har- 
veft is done by the laft of September or the firft of O£to- 
ber. HieT?is ignava colono is verified here, for there is no 
labour carried on during winter, except thralhing and pre- 
paring the crop. Then it is that the farmer enjoys the 
fruit of his labour, and to this feafon they look forward for 
the reward of their toil. They make malt, and as the ex- 
cife is compounded, the greater part of them brew ale, and 
drink it with one another alternately. There is no doubt 
but a great deal of the crop is confumed in this way ; but if 
ufed with moderation^ it is what they are entitled to from 
the labours of the year, and the feafon perhaps requires it. 
Mirth and hilarity appear in a circle of neighbours met ' 
thus to enjoy themfelves during the rigour of the feafon, 
s^nd here the poet's defcription is realifed : 

Frijoribus 



420 



Statijlical Account 



" Frigorlbus parto agrlcolas plerumque friiuntur, 
" Mutuaque inter fe liti conviyia curant ; 
" Invitat genialis hiems, curasque relblvit*." 

Manure. — In the upland farms, diftant from the fea, the 
only manure they have is the dung of their horfes and cat- 
tle, with feal and divot cut from the hill and brakes. 
They build a fpot of lo or ii feet in diameter with feals, 
■which they fill with dung, afhes, and cut feals. Thefe 
compoft dunghills are carried on the land in fpring, fpread, 
and tilled down. 

Sea-weed. — In parts near the fea^ they principally de- 
pend on fea weed or ware, which, with fome little dung^ 
and houfe manure, raifes excellent crops. In fome places 
of the pariih of Sandwick that lie in the vicinity of^ the 
fea-lhore, they put, in winter, fea-ware on their grounds ; 
in fpring they put on the dung from the compoft dung- 
hills ; and if plenty of fea-ware is drove afliore, they put 
on fea-ware again, before they till and few with bear. 
The ground, thus thrice manured, produces a luxuriant 
appearance of crop, and a good one if the feafon is dry •, 
but if the feafon is wet and jainy, it falls down before it is 
iilled, and then feldom ripens well. 

Marl, — In a few places marl is found. It is taken up 
in fummer, and laid to dry. Then it is laid on lea-grounds 
and fpread, and in harveft it is tilled down. 

Lime. — There is appearance of limeftone in both thefe 
parilhes. There is limeftone in the parifli of Sandwick, 
which lies in the diredion of from S. S. W. to N. N. E. ; 

an-d

of Sandwick and Stromnefs. 421 



and excellent lime is made there by the firft refiding heri- 
tor William Wall, Efq; but none is ufed as a manure. 
The petrified fand in thefe pariflies alfo burns to lime. 

Crops. — The crops are very unequal in produce. In 
the months of July and Auguft the appearance is very pro- 
mifing, but the ftorms of wind in the month of Septem- 
ber often injure the crop. Thefe- gales are ufually from 
the W. and S. W. and fweeping over the Atlantic Ocean, 
are collefted, as it were in a narrow flream, by the moun- 
tains of Hoy, and aft with great violence. The two moft 
violent ftorms at the harveft feafon, for 30 years paft, were 
in September 1765, and on the 14th Auguft 1778. The 
fea-fpray has been known to reach 12 miles diftant from 
the craggy weftern coaft of thefe parifties, which makes the 
fodder fait, and often .hurtful to cattle. The fear of thefe 
ftorms may be faid to hurt the crop' every year, as it indu- 
ces the farmers to cut down their crop before it is fully 
ripe. As their farms are fmall, and their circumftances 
ftraitened, thefe confiderations, joined to the recolledion of 
what injury their crops have formerly fuftained, make' 
them eager to begin harveft ; and if it be obferved to them, ' 
that they lofe by this conduft, they anfwer, that a green 
fheaf is, better than a lhaken ftieaf. It may be thought 
that this might be remedied by fowing more early, and 
confequently bringing on the harveft before the autumnal 
and equinodial gales come on ; but the fpring feafon fel- 
dom admits of this. In fome places where the grounds are 
dry, they do fow more early when the feafon admits of it ; 
but neither does this always fucceed, becaufe there often 
happens fuch cold weather in May, as nips the crop, makes 
it fliort and ftinted, thin, and fmall in the ear. The un- 
certainty of the feafons hurts the crop, both as to quantity 
and quality. As the farms ar» fmall, the prefent neceffity 

of ,

of the farmer cannot permit him to fallow anj confiderable 
part of his grounds; it confequentlj follows that the grounds 
are very dirty and full of weeds, by which alfo the crop is 
hurt. 

It may confeqnently appear, that this climate is better 
adapted to raifing crops of grafe, but that has not been at- 
tempted, except in very fmall fpots. Straitened circum- 
llances, fliort leafes, and the payment of the rent in malt, 
are bars to this. To carry this plan into execution, it 
would be neceflary that the proprietors^ or the tenants, 
fhould have the command of money to defray the expence 
of inclofing, which has not been the cafe with the refiding 
proprietors, or their tenants, for 'fome time part. It would 
alfo, perhaps, require a better market for cattle than is to 
be found at the village of Stromnefsi 

!From the great uncertainty of the feafons, and confe- 
quent variablenefs of the crop, no precife or fixed eltimate 
can be made of the whole produce. The ground that each 
farm contains is not afcertained, and few or none keep an 
exad account of the produce of their farms, nor can they 
well do it, as they are in the praflice of keeping up their 
ftpck of horfes by buying young ones of a year old, on

they are reared fit for tilling. If an eftimate was made of , 
the whole produce, it would be mere conjefture. If we 
were to hazard fuch conje6lure, the principles upon which 
we would proceed would be thefe. We would firft afcer- 
tain the number of acres cultivated by each plough, and 
then fix on what we know an acre of middling foi^^as, or 
may produce, in feafons not unfavourable. Upon thefe 
principles it will ftand thus :

As the rent continues to be paid, for the moll part, in

very inconfiderably in denomination. The rents of the 
biflioprick or Crown- lands, which, together with the feu- 
duties payable to the Crown, amount to one-half of the 
whole rents, have rarely been augmented. But although 
there is no rife in the rent as to the articles paid in kind, 
yet thefe articles have increafed in value. The real rent

Is, nearly one-fourth part of the whole produce, . after de- 
ducting feed and multure j that therefore the lan^s are mo- 
derately rented. But this will not appear to be the cafe, 
when we confider, ift, The want df good and regular mar- 
kets for the produce ; 2dly, The increafed expence of 
farming, and efpecially of fervants wages ; 3dly, The dif- 
ficulty of obtaining fervants, even at the advanced wages. 

Services.— tenants of the refiding heritors ufually 
aflift for 2 days in carrying home dn their horfes the pro- 
prietors peats, and this is almoft the only fervice required 
of them. All fervices are the remains of the old feudal 
fyftem, and it is argued that they ought to be abolifhed, as 
they impede improvements. But fuch fmall fervices as 
thefe are no bar to improvements ; for the tenants of the 
non-refiding heritors, who pay no fervices, do not improve 
their lands more than thofe tenants do who perform thefe 
fervices. 

State of Property.— In the times of Epifcopacy, the Bi» 
fliop held the property of about one half of the. parilh of 
Sandwick, and a fmall property in the parifti of Stromnefs ; 
fo that, with the feu-duties payable to him from the other 
proprietors, he received nearly one half of the rent of both 
pariilies. Thefe lands being now vefted in the Crown, are 
fet in tack by the Exchequer to the Right Honourable 
Lord Dundas of A&amp;e, for a yearly tack-duty. George 
Graham, Bifiiop of Orkney, pofl^effed, as private property, 
nearly one third part of thefe parifhes, which property is 
now transferred to William Watt, Efq; Thefe two great 
proprietors, with two more heritors, of whom James Rid- 
doch, Efqi ColleaorofhisMajefty'sCuftoms, is one, re- 
ceive among them about three-fourths of the rents; and 

the 



428 



Statijlical Accomtt 



the remaining fourth part is the property of nearly I0! 
fmall heritors. 

As the biflioprick lands are annexed to the Crown, and 
cannot be transferred, it is only the remaining part, the 
property of private individuals, that can come into the 
market for fale. Within thefe laft 20 years, above one 
half of this remaining faleable property has been fold, and 
fome of it at from 30 to 50 years purchafe. There is no 
reafon to regret that property changes its mafters, for thefe' 
new proprietors are the beft improvers of the foil, by 
inclofing, adopting new modes of agriculture, building com- 
fortable houfes, and erefling mills. 

About 70 years ago lands were fold at 20 years pur- 
chafe, and below it ; but fince the village of Stromnels has 
increafed in number of inhabitants, in wealth and trade, 
lands have rifen in value ; as the fhopkeepers, who have 
made any money, chufe to veft it in lands or houfes, the 
inland trade being limited, and they do not incline to efta- 
blilh manufactures, or engage in foreign trade. The de- 
mand alfo by fliipping of fome of the articles raifed, and 
the increafed prices given, have tended to raife the value 
of property, although thefe prices are ftill inadequate to 
what the farmer might expeft, confidering the great inr- 
creafe of expence in rearing thefe commodities. 

Heritors. — At the time of the laft valuation or extent ia 
1653, there were 145 heritors, exclufive of the biflioprick 
lands then vefted in the Crown. At that time there was 
but one proprietor of the name of Halcro, and four of the 
name of Sinclair, of very inconfiderable property, although 
thefe were the greateft names in this county formerly; 
one of the Sinclair's having born the title of Prince of 
Orkney, and Duke of Oldenburgh, and was allied by mar- 
' tiage to the royal family of Denmark. — In 1753, when a 

modified 



of Sandwich aud StroMnefs. 42,9 



iflodified ftipend was obtained, the number of heritors was 
140. At the prefent time (1794) there are 95 heritors. 
The great proprietors are Lord Dundas, holding in leafe 
the Crown-lands ; William Watt, James Riddoch, William 
Graham, and William Honyman, Efqrs. Thefe hold 
about three-fourths of the property. 

In the village of Stromnefs there are a22 inhabited 
houfes, the property of 59 proprietors. Many of thefe 
houfes are occupied by the proprietors, and were never let 
for rent; but thefe houfes either are, or might be rented 
as follows :

From the high price of materials and workmanfliip, 
building is as dear here as in many other parts of the king- 
dom. The beft houfes, when rented, do not give above 
3 per cent, of the coft in building ; fmall houfes give 5 or 
6 per cent. ' It may be thought that traders of fmall capi- 
tals might employ their money to more advantage than in 
building houfes which give fuch poor returns ; neverthe- 
lefs, thofe who can afford it, rather chufe to build, and oc- 
cupy a houfe of their own, than pay the moderate rent of 
fuch a houfe. Small quays are raifed to defend the houfes 
next the fea, and fome houfes are erefted on foundations 
built in the fea. 

^ Farm Stoch'ng. ~~The number of horfes in the following 
lift will appear great, when compared to the number of 
acres cultivated, and the quantity of grain raifed. It is 
the pride of the farmers to keep as many, and as good hor- 
fes as they can afford, and therefore they give them a con- 
liderable part of the oat-crop. It is ufual at a marriage, 
when returning from church, to try who can ride foremoft 
to the wedding houfe, and they are as keen in the race, and 
perhaps as much elated with the vidory, as thofe of higher 
rank are at Newmarket.

labourers receive 10 d. or i s. in fummer, and 8 d. in win- 
ter, p^r day, without board. 

Price of Grain and Pro'vifions.^Hh^ price of grain va- 
ries greatly. When the crop is good, the price falls very 
low, as it is but feldom any is exported ; and, when it is 
exported, the lower ranks murmur. When the crop fails, 
the price is high, occafioned by the additional expence of 
freight and infurance upon what is imported. Oat-meal 
varies from i s. 3 d. to 2 s. 6 A. per ftone ; malt from 11 s. 
toi7s.^.rmeel, of 114 ftone Dutch ; beef fells at ix d

Population. — In the procefs for augmentation of ftipend, 
(1754), tiie minifter of thefe parifties reprefented to the 
Lords Commiffioners for the valuation of teinds, that thefe 
parifties contained 2400 examinable perfons, and in 
whole 3000 people ; that of thefe there was in the village 
.of Stromnefs 1000. There are at prefent (1794) in the 
village of Stromnefs 1344 fouls, and yet the whole popu- 
lation is only about the fame as that ftated in 1754; by 
which it appears, that the population of the two country 
parifties has decreafed, in the fame proportion as that of 
the village has increafed. By an exa£l lift, taken in June

M mufaBures.- — Coarfe woollen cloths and fluffs are made 
for houfeliold-ufe. but in no great quantity. Linen is alfo 
inade for twearing apparel. The principal manufaftures 
carried on here, are knitting ftpckings, and fpinning linen 
yarn. In the firft of thefe they greatly excel, and from

Kelp — As the weft coaft of thefe parifhes is high and 
rock J, the quantity of kelp made is not confidcrable. The 
fea-weed on the fhores is cut and burnt oply once in two 
or three years. Ko kelp is made from the fea ware thaf 
is driven afliore from the ocean. About 150 tons may be 
made once in three years j that is, at an average, 50 tons 
yearly •, of which about 8 tons are made in the parilh of 
Sandwick, and about 42 tons yearly in the parifh of Strom- 
nefs. 

Fijheries. — The fifh caught here are cod, ling, Ikate, 
holybut, haddocks, lobfters, \Sc. Cod and ling are caught 
about a league's diftance from the wef^ coaft of thefe pa- 
riflies. Three boats only ate employed in this fifhing in- 
the parifh of Sandwick, and as many in the parifli of 
Stromnefs. The outfit and expence oh this fiftiing, and

parifh of Stromnefs. 

Lohjiers. — A couple of boats in the parifli of Stromnefs 
are employed in catching lobfters, which are fold to the 
fmacks, who carry them to London^ 

-It was ufual for a floop to go once a-year, about 
Martinmas, to the fmall ifle or rock of^ Soullkerry, which' 
lies W. N. W. about 10 leagues diflant, and there kill, 
feals, which refort to that rock in great numbers. The 
furge is fo great around that rock, that it often happened 
they could not efFecl a landing ; or, if the men were landed, 
they, and the feals, which they killed, could not be got off 
but with, difficulty,, and confiderable rifk. In November' 
1786, a floop upon this adventure, from the village of 
Stromnefs, was driven by tempeftuous- weather to the 
North Faro Ifles, and there wrecked with 22 men aboard, 
3 of whom were faved, and 19 periflied. Since that fatal 
accident, this perilous fifhing has been abandoned; 

Sillock FtJJjing.-^Tht mod beneficial, and moft generally 
ufeful fifhing, is that of the fillocks, a fmall grey filh, which 
are caught in great numbers, from September to March, in 
the harbour of Stromnefs, to which they ufually refort for- 
food and flicker. This is a fifli of a fweet and pleafant

to ICQ men and boys may be feen catching them in good 
weather, either with bait or fly, in boats, or along the 
^uays, in the harbaur of Stromnefs. 

^ Village of Stromnefs. — This village, fituated on the wefc 
fide of the harbour, near the fouthmoft extremity or nefs 
of this parifh, from whence it derives its narne, was, in ther 
beginning of the prefent century, very inconfiderable, con- 
lifting only of half a dozen houfes with flated roofs, and 
a few fcattered huts, the firft inhabited by two gentlemea 
of landed property, and two or three fmall traders ; the 
laft by a few fifliermen and mechanics. Two fmall veflels, 
df 30 tons each, were all that then belonged^ to it. Thefe 
Were employed in catching cod and ling at Barra, and 
made ufually once a year a voyage to Leith or Norway. 

In 17 19, this village was affefTed by the borough of 
Itirkwall, in the payment of cefs or ftent, in terms of the 
rath a6t of King William and Queen Mary, rft Parlia- 
ment 1690, by which aft it is declared. That the exporting 
OT importing of native or foreign commodities belongs only- 
to freemen, inhabitants of royal boroughs, excepting the 
articles of corn, cattle, minerals, coal, fait, lime, and ftone. 
By this aft the boroughs were not authorifed to admit the 
traders in villages to a participation of trade. This defeft: 
of the law, as it then flood, was remedied by the 30th aft- 
of King William and Queen Mary, ill Parliament 1693 ; 
by which aft it was- declared, " That the benefit of trade 
" allowed to royal boroughs, might be communicated in 
favours of burghs of regality, barony, and others, on their 
relieving the royal boroughs of a proportion of the tax: 
"laid' on them." By the articles of Union, 7th aft of 
Queen Anne, article 21. of Parliament i. 1767, it was de- 
dared, « That the j:lghts of royal boroughs fhouJd remain 
* . "entire.

entire, as they then were, after the Union, and notwith- 
" ftandmg thereof." Upon thefe afts the borough of Kirk- 
wall claimed right to exaft, from the village of Stromnefs, 
a proportionable fhare of the cefs and burdens, which, by 
the tax- roll that borough was liable to pay ; and that 
upon payment of fuch proportion, the borough of KirkwLll' 
would admit the inhabitants of the village of Stromnefs to 
a communication of trade, which was accordingly complied" 
with, and was continued from 1719 to 25th May 1743, ' 
when the inhabitants of the village of Stromnefs refufed to 
pay the cefs or ftent to the borough of Kirkwall, alleging, 
that the fum laid on them was more than theit proportion 
and more than their trade could bear ; and, befides, that it 
was partially laid on the feveral traders of this village, and 
not m due proportion to the extent of theit trade. The 
magiftrates of Kirkwall ftated to the Honoutable the Con- 
vention of Royal Boroughs, that, by the tax-roll, they were 
liable in payment of cefs and ftent, (Scots) L. 687 o o

a 

of this village was fmall, and, as it depended on the refort 
of fhipping, it was uncertain : That the borough of Kirk- 
wall enjoyed great advantages from its right to vote for a 
member of Parliament ; from being the feat of Juftice : 
That the revenues of the borough were great, from their 
burgage-holdings, cefs of houfes, fiars, markets, and cu- 
ftoms ; and, therefore, one fixth part of the whole burdens, 
inftead of one Uiird part demanded, would be found a full 
and equal proportion for the village of Stromnefs ; which 
fixth part of the whole they were willing to pay. This 
offer was rejefted. The matter was brought before the 
Court of Seflion; and on the 17th February 1754, a deci- 
ilon was obtained, declarmg, " There was no fufficient right 
" in the borough of Kirkwall to aflefs the village of Strom- 
" nefs, but that the faid village fhould be quit 'thereof, and 
" free therefrom, in all time coming." From this deci- 
fion the raagillrates of Kirkwall appeale'd to the High 
Court of Parliament, and this caufe was heard at the bar 
of the Houfe of Lords, the 1 6th January 1758, when the 
decifion of the Court of Seffion was affirmed. By this deci- 
fion the village of Stromnefs, and all the villages through- 
out Scotland, became free and independent of the Royal 
Boroughs. Before this ■ procefs, the trade of this village 
was greatly cramped by its dependence on the borough of 
Kirkwall, as well as during the procefs, by the expences in 
fupporting it; which expence hurt the circumltances of 
many of the fmall traders ; and ope of fhofe who firft fug. 
gefted it, and was mofl adive in promoting it, (Alexander 
Graham), was thereby rendered unable to carry on tr ,de 
whofe widow is mil alive, and redticed circurprtances! 
The prefent Lord High ChanceUor of Great Britain, (then 
Mr Wedderburn), was counfel for the inhabitants of this 
Tillage, at the bar of the Houfe of Peers. 

Since

Statiflical Account 



Since this ftruggle for independence, the trade of the 
village has greatly increafed, which is in a great meafure 
owing to the refort of fhipping to this place. 

While the American Colonies were connefted with, 
and dependent upon Britain, feveral American veflels came 
here, and entered their cargoes at the light of the officers of 
the cuftomhoufe of Kirkwall, preferring this place even 
to Cowes, in 'the Ifle of Wight. The advantages refulting 
herefrom to this village, induced fome mercantile people 
at the borough of Kirkwall to attempt bringing thefe vef- 
fels there •, and, in order to efFeft this, they reprefented the 
harbour of Stromnefs as a fmali creek, to which the port 
of Kirkwall was preferable. 

The American goods were unloaded, and weighed aboard 
an old and large difmafted velTcl, which lay in the harbour 
of Stromnefs for this purpofe. This difmafted veffel or 
hulk was brought to the harbour of Kirkwall, with a view 
to bring the American veflels there ; but this did not fuc- 
ceed, as they then preferred going to Cowes, in the Ifle of 
Wight, and entering at the cuftomhoufe there, on their 
way to Holland and the Eaft countries.

From this abftrafl, taken from the cuftomhoure-booksj • 
it appears, there were 19 veflels ente'-ed in three years, 
whofe cargoes confided of 44,454 cwt. 3 qrs. 91b. rice; 
the duty on which, if not exported, would have been 
L. 14,182 : 8 : 64:; but, as the whole was exported, the 
drawback on exportation reduced this duty to L. 1419^ 
15 s. 3^d. 

Since the independence of America, all hopes of the 
produce of the Southern States of North America palling 
this way are loft. The produce, however, of our fettle- 
ments at Hudfon's Bay ftrll pafs this way. 

Hudfon's Bay Companfs S'-^zj&amp;j.^Hudfon's Bay was dif- 
covered by Henry Hudfon, in 1610. France, after difpu^ 
ting the right to it, finally ceded it to Britain, at the treaty 
of Utrecht. Since 1670, the trade to that couritry haS: 
been carried on by a Company, who have an exclufive 
chnrter. The capital of this Company, originally 
L. 10,565 : la. : 6, has been increafed to L. 104,146, 17 s. 
6d. This Company fits out three Ihips, from 150 to 40a: 
tons each, which carry out provifions, guns, powder, ftiot, 
hatchets, cloths, ISc, to be exchanged with the Indians for- 
beaver, and other furs. Thefe veffels ufually arrive at the 
harbour of Stromnefs about the firft of June, where they 
flop for two or three weeks to take aboard men for their 
fettlements. They engage ufually from 60 to 100 men, 
natives of this country, to go to thefe fettlements, every 
year They have about 400 or 500 men in thefe fettle- 
ments, of whom it is prefumed three-fourths are Orknefe, 
as they find them more fober and; traftable than the Infh, 
and they engage for lower wages than either the Englifh. 
or Irifii. The yearly wages they give is, houfe-carpenters, 
from L. 20 to L.36; blackfmiths, from L. 20 to L. 30 ; 
failors, from L. 18 to L. 25 i boat-builders, from L.20ta 

L. 3.P ; 



of Sandwick and Stromttefs. 443 

X. 30 J bricklayers or mafons, from L. 20 to L. 25 ; tailors, 
from L. 10 to L. ij ; labourers, from L. 6 to L. 18. The 
Company raifes the wages of thefe men in proportion to 
the time they remain in their fervice, becaufe the longer 
they are, the better they are acquainted with the bufinefs, 
and confequently more ufeful. \ 

The Company's Ihips ufually return to the harbour df 
Stromnefs about November, to land thofe men who choofe 
to return home. The returns to the Company by thefe 
ihips, from all their fettlements, is ufually from 8o,coo to 
100,000 beaver ikins, or other furs equal in value to this 
number of beaver; for all other furs are computed by 
their relative value to the beaver, as are alfo the goods 
-fent out from Britain ; and confequently the Company's, 
accounts with their fadors in thefe fettlements are kept in 
beaver, as ours are in pounds Sterling. 

It has been faid by a great writer, (Abbe Raynal), th^ 
the murmurs of the nation have been excited againft this 
Company, both on account of their monopoly, and alfo on 
account of the great profits they make ; which might in- 
deed have been great fome time ago, when their trade was 
more extenfive, and not checked by the interference of the 
Canadian traders, and when the expence of fupporting 
their extenfive fettlements was lefs : but, of late years, it 
is afferted, that they do not divide above 6 or 8 'per cent. 
which is no more than the Eaft India Company, and other 
trading companies in Britain^ have divided. 

If the murmurs of the nation have been excited, becaufe 
of the monopoly which this Company enjoys ; fo alfo, of 
late years, there have been great complaints in this coun- 
ty, both on account of the fmall wages given to the labour- 
ers, and the great number of them engaged, while the far- 
mers are left without fervants. The conftant drain of 
^xi from this county to the Greenjand and Iceland filh- 

cries,

Statijlical Account 



cries, the coal-trade, and his Majefty's navy, together with 
200 fencibles raifed, has tended to fofter thefe complaints, 
which are principally direfted againft the Hudfon's Bay 
Company, becaufe they make a yearly demand, and at 
once, and therefore the more perceptible. We cannot 
complain that our men are called away to fight our wars ; 
this we can only regret, and that the fituation of things 
makes it neceflary, occafioned by the turbulence of a neigh- 
bouring nation.

Tarn multsc fcelerum facies ; non uUus aratro 
Dignus honos ; fquallent abdudlis arva coloni's, 
Et curvE rigidum falces conflantur in enfem*. 

In time paft, when there was not fuch a demand for 
men from other quarters, the number neceflary for Hud- 
fon's Bay might well have been fpared from this county ; 
and although it is no doubt better for a country to keep its 
natives at home, provided they can be ufefuUy employed, 
cither in agriculture or manufaftures, yet where there are 
not man^ifaftures, or improvements in agriculture, thus to 
employ them, it is then better to hire them to thofe who 
can ufefully employ them ; and alfo better, that they go to 
hunt the harmlefe and ciyilized beaver, than, like the Swifs, 
to fight the wars of other nations for hire. As to thefe 
men being idle and ufelefs to their own country when they 
return, it may be obferved, that feveral of them are per- 
haps fo before they go there, and that this is what often 
induces them to go.

tion, reprefent to thofe who go, ift. The dangers to be en-

feverity of the climate, and the danger of being froft bit ; 
3dly, The hazard of being cut off by the Indiaiis ; yet all 
this does not deter them from going. But even allowing 
that all thefe dangers are exaggerated, as they perhaps are, 
fince few are froft bit except through their own inattention, 
or cut off by the Indians except when it is occafioned by 
their own imprudence ; yet ftill their folitary fituation 
there, might feem of itfelf fufficient to weigh againft all 
the pecuniary advantages they can hope to reap in the 
Company's fervice ; fince they are cut off from family and 
friends, and from all focial intercourfe but with the natives, 
where

Notwithftanding this, too, yet from a reftleffnefs of difpofi- 
tion,a delire of change, and fmall as the wages are, yet as they 
are better than the farmers here can afford to give, the Com- 
pany always procure a fufficient number of men to go to 
that bleak climate. For their fuccefs in procuring thefe 
men, they are perhaps indebted to their agent at the vil- 
lage of Stromnefs, who is a man well qualified for bufinefs, 
and attentive to the interefts of the Company. This agent 
pays away yearly for the Company from L. 2000 to 
L. 3000 Sterling, which no doubt greatly tends to quicken 
the little trade of this place.

From the above lift it appears, that the average number of 
veffels which pafi this waj in a year, is 3 1 2^. Before the 
peace in 1763, 450 or joo veffels have paffed this way in 
a year. The reafon why the number paffing now is not 
fo great as formerly, is, that many now go through Pent- 
land Frith, who formerly ufed to pafs by Stromnefs, as 
they have now become better acquainted with that frith. 
And as a light-houfe is now erefted on the Pentland Skir- 
xies in that frith, it may be prefumed that ftill a greater 
number will pafs that way, and a lefs number by Strom- 
nefs.

atfs. It has been fuggefted, that for the fafety of the trad&amp; 
pafling by Stromnefs, it might be neceflary to eredl a fort 
at the entrance of the harbour, fiiice the the French priva- 
teers, in time of war, have entered Hoy Sound, and hav&amp; 
been within two miles of the harbour. But from the above 
lift it will appear, that the number of veffels pafling this 
v^^ay is not fo great as has been fuppofed. A frigate fta- 
tioned here, it is probable, would be of more effential fer- 
vice, both in defending the harbour, and in fcouring the 
coaft. 

Shipping huilt af, and belonging to Stromnefs. — Several 
fmall veflTels, from 30 to 90 tons, hiive been built here.. 
There are at prefent (1794) 2 brigs and 4 floops belonging 
ta the village of Stromnefs, in all about 500 tons. Two 
of thefe floops are ufually employed in the herring-fifliing,. 
Thefe veffels. go abroad in queft of freights, as the trade 
of this place cannot give them employment, as will be

trade abroad; money received from dipping for freOi pro- 
vifions, orfpent by feamen in the public inns; remittances 
irom thofe m the fervice of the Hudfon's Bay Company. 
Thefe fources are more than fufficient to balance the a- 
mount of imports, as appears evident, fmce the flyle of li- 
ving has been greatly increafing for fome years pad ; new 
houfes have been built every year ; the trading people 
have purchafed lands when they came into the market for 
fale ; and there have been only two or three bankruptcies 
among them for 30 years part ; and prior to that period, they 
wereftill more rare, and almofl miheard of; fo that, if what 
great writer (Lord Kames) obferves be true, that the num- 
ber of bankruptcies prove the increafe of trade, then the 
trade of this village has been, and ftill is low. 

As the whole exports and imports amount only to 
L. 65(59 : 16 : 8, if we were to fuppofe a nett profit on the 
whole of 20 per cent, this would only be L. 1313 : 19 : 3, 
which, if divided among a6 Ihopkeepers, would be L. 50, 
lbs. 8^ d. to each. This would appciar a fum fmall enough 
for the fupport of a family ; neverthelefs, by oeconomy 
and ftria attention to their affairs, the greater part of them 
increafe their capitals, build houfes, -purchafe lands, and in 
a courfe of 30 years, are in circumftances to fetire from 
bufinefs, having realifed L. 1000 or L. 2000, upon the in- 
tereft, or returns of which, thpy live comfortably, and with 
which they are as well fatisfied, as the great merchants in

Retailers 



of Sandwich arid Stromnsfs. ^51 

^ Retailers of Ale and Spirits — As the excifs of this county 
is compounded, many of the farmers brew ale for fale du- 
ring whiter, fo that- the. number of pccafional retailers can- 
not be precifely afcertained 5 and although a great deal of 
grain is confumed in this, waj, and there are complaints 
againft it, yet it may b? prefu^ied, that it is neither fo per- 
nicious to the health, the morals, or the circumftances of 
the people as drinking fpirits, which prevails in other coun- 
tries among the lower clafle.s, ^and at all feafons of the 
year; whereas this practice of brewing ale prevails among 
the farmers here only during winter, or the firft of fpring. 
Nor is it here the fottilh enjoyment of drinking alone J 
they often have mufie and dancing at thefe meetings ; 



and, fliook to notes 



Of native miilic, the relpondent dance. 
Thusjoeurtd fleets with iJicm the winter night*. 

The regular and conftant rerjillers of ale and fplrlts are : 
Retailers of ale, 23 in the village of Stromnefs ; retailere 
vf fpirits, 3 in Sandwich parifli, 3 in Stromnefs panUi, and 
^ i1^ the village pf Stromnefs^ 

Church, Patron, Stipend,— tliete is a church in each of 
theCe pariOies, The parilli church of Stromnefs formerly 
flood a mile, diftant from where the village is fituated ; 
at prefent, the parifb^church ftands in the village, of Strom- 
hefs, and the old pariQa^church is ruinous. The prefent 
church was built in 1717, and is not large enough to ac- 
commodate the people of the parifh and village, as the in- 
habitants of the village have increafed greatly fince that 
time. The church of Sandwick was rebuilt in 1670, by 
Andrew Honyman, BiOiop of Orkney; and again rebuilt 

* Thomfon's Seafons Winter, iine 531.

in 1757. It was dedicated to St Peter, as was alfo the ol^ 
parifh-church of Stromnf fsj now ruinous. The minifter 
preaches lat each of the two parifh-churches alternately. 

The rigbt'of prefenFfation-formerlj in the biftiop, pafled 
to the CrowiT,' upon the abolitiob of Epifcopacj, along with 
the bifhoprick lands ; and is »6w«^vefted in, and exercifed 
by the Right Honourable Lord' Dundas of Alke, who 
holds the biflioprick. lands in leafe from the Exchequer. 

The ftipend, by decreet of the Court of Seflion in 1753, 
is 96 ni eels of malt; L. 15 money, (in lieu of 6 barrels 
butter\ L. 10 money, (in lieu of vicarages), and L. 3, 6 s. 
8 d. for communion-elements. It is troublefome to colle£l 
this ftipend, as it is paid by nearly 100 heritors. When 
it is regularly paid, and malt fells at lo s. per meel, it is 
"worth L. 76 : 6 : 8, including the money allowed for com- 
munion-elements. The village of Stromnefs pays no part 
of ftipend, although the population of that village is not 
far ftiort of that of both the country pariflies. 

There is a glebe in each of thefe pariflies, and both may^ 
be worth about L. 9 Sterling yearly rent. The minifter 
of thefe pariflies formerly refided in the parifli of Sandwick 
until the year 1780, when a new manfe was built in the 
parifli of Stromnefs, about a mile from the village. 

lAJl of Minifiers of thefe Pariffjes^-^Mv John Nift)et, ad- 
mitted 1715, died 1746, was 31 years minifter; Mr Jamea 
Tyrie, admitted May 1747* iied 1778, was 31 years mini- 
fter; Mr John Falconer, admitted 1779, died 1792, was 
13 years minifter ; Mr William Cloufton, admitted 1794* 

Schools.— -Thttt is no parochial fchool in either of thefe 
pariflies. The Society for propagating Chriftian Know- 
ledge gives L. 8 yearly to a fchoolmafter, and L. 3 yearly 
. to * fchool-miftrefs, both in the village of Stromnefs. The- 

fchoot

fbhool-fees are, from 6 d. to i s. quarterly, for teaching to^ 
rtad and write ; and i s. 6 d. or 2 s. lor writing and arith- 
metic. The fchools are, 

In the village of Stromnefs, one grammar-fchtiol, where- 
■Latirt- is taught. Four fchools, where the fchoolmaftera- 
teach reading, writing, and arithmetic^ Three, fchools,, ira 
which fchool-miftrefles teach reading, knitting ftockings, 
■and fewing white feam. 

In the parifti of Sandwick, one fchool, in which a fchool- 
miftrefs teaches to read. 

There are ufuallj from 200 to 350 fcholars at all thefe 
fchools. 

Poor. — There are about 50 poor perfons in the pafilh: 
and village of Stromnels, and 12 poor perfons in the parifh 
of Sandwick, to whom the feflions give money twice or 
thrice a-year. The funds for their fuppoi t are, from coL- 
leftions received at church on Sabbath, and on occalion of 
adminiftering the facrament of the Lord's Supper, dues of 
pall or mortcloth,^ and' fines all which, in. the parilh of 
Sandwick, may amount yearly to about L. 4

Fuel, — As there are no peat-mofles in the parifh of Sand- 
wick, the inhabitants of that pariih bring their peats from 
the moffes of the neighbouring parifli of Harray, diftant 
5 or 6 miles. This employs them and their horfes the 
greater part of the fummer, when, otherwife, they might 
be employed in cleaning their lands, and preparing manure, 
fo that this di fiance from' fuel is confequently a great b^r 
to improvement, either in the way of inclofing, fallowing, 
or railing green crops. The fmall mofTes in the parifli of 
Stromnefs at prefent fupply the parifh ; but it is probable 
that, in 30 or 40 years hence, thefe moffes will either be 
exhaufted, or covered with water, fo as to be inacceffible. 
The inhabitants of the village of Stromnefs cut part of 
their peats in the parifti-moffes ; but the greater part of 
this village is fupplied with peats brought by fea from other 
parifhes, the diftance of 5 or 6 miles. The duty being 
now taken off coals, the inhabitants of this village will pro- 
bably ufe peats for their kitchen- fires, and coals for other 
fires. 

Roads. 



of Sandwick and Stropinefs. 



Roads, — There are no made roads through thefe parifhes 
but one of two miles in length, which leads from the vil- 
lage of Stromnefs towards the road that leads to the bo- 
rough of Kirkwall. The roads through the parifh of Sand- 
wick are naturally good, as the ground is dry. The roads 
through the parifti of Stromnefs are, for the moft part, bad 
in winter, as the grounds are wet. In one or two places 
tfie roads are fcarcely palTable on horfeback ; and although 
the inhabitants of two or three parifhes muft pafs by thefe 
bad roads, in carrying the produce of their farms to fale at 
the village of Stromnefs, yet it has never been attempted 
to make thefe roads better; although this might be done 
at no great expence of labour. 

^^r/^^...-There is only one bridge, and that in the pa- 
rilh of Stromnefs, at the entrance to the loch of Stennefs 
where it communicates with the fea. This bridge may be' 
about 100 or 130 yards ; it has no arches, but inftead of 
thefe logs of wood «re laid acrofs 3 or 4 openings, through 
wh.ch the fea paffes. It is thought by fome, Lt if the 

^//^...._.There is a millftone quarry on the weft 
coaft of the panfl. of Sandwick, out of which about xo 
millftones are wrought annually, at the price of as. for 
each mch that the ftone is thick in the eye. From this 
quarry moft of the mills in the county are fupplied. 

S/ates.^Th.re is a flate-quarry in the fouth-weft extre 
mny of the parifh of Stromnefs, from which from 30 1 J 
to 40,000 f^at^s are annually fCd. They are ftrong,'thick

got. They are better adapted to this climate than Eafdale 
Elates and yet, becaufe thefe laft have a preferable appear- 
ance, they are more ufed at the village of Stromnefs, not- 
withftanding that the parifti flates are cheaper, can be 
brought by water, and confequently not dear in carriage. 

Limejlone. — There is plenty of limeftone in thefe parifhes, 
but through the fcarcity of fuel wherewith to burn it, and 
Kof hands whereby to work, it, there is no iime made in the 
parifli of Stromnefs, and but an inconliderable quantity in 
the parifli of Sandwick, by the principal heritor there. 

Freejione. — Freeftone has been lately found in the parifh 
of Sandwick, but it is hard, and not of good quality. 

Minerals. — There are appearances of lead and iron ore 
in the parifli of Stromnefs. The lead-ore in the clefts of 
the rocks has the appearance of melted lead. In 1755, 
miners from England wrought the lead-mines, and fent 
away a X)nfiderable quantity of the ore ; but, either the 
ore was not rich enough to repay the expences, or the vein 
was fmall and foon exhaufted, or the work was unlkilfully 
carried on, and too cxp. nfively managed \ for one or other 
of thefe reafons it was abandoned. A few years afterwards 
the attempt was again made to open the lead-mines in an- 
other part of this parifh, which alio failed. 

Mineral Springs.— There are fome mineral fprings in 
thefe parifhes. There is one in the vicinity of the vUlage 
xf Stromnefs, which has been tried for fcorbutic complaints, 
^nd has fometimes proved fuccefsful. 

Birds.— The birds, both domeflic and migratory, are fuch 
»s are common to other parts of this county. About 80 
, years 



of Sand wick and Stroinnefs, 457 



years ago, moorfowl frequented fome of the hills, and were 
flipt within a mile of th^ village^ of Stromnefs \ but now 
there is no heath there, nor are moorfowl to be found in 
either of thefe parifhes. 

Plants. — There are no plants here but fuch as are com- 
mon in this county, and have been repeatedly defcribed. 
The fcurvy-grafs abounds in many places, and grows on 
the roofs, and along the walls of old houfes in the village 
of Stromnefs. Small black, or whortle berries, probably 
fimilar to the vaccinia nigra of Virgil, but of inferior qua- 
lity, were formerly found ori the hills in the vicinity of 
the village of Stromnefs ; but none grow there now, and 
they are rarely to be met with on any of the hills of thefe 
pariflies. 

Molucca Beans. — Thefe have fometimes, but rarely, 
been found along the fea-coafts of thefe parillies. 

Claik Geefe, Barnacles. — Thefe have been found flicking 
to pieces of timber, as defcribed by Wallace in his delcrip- 
tion of Orkney, and alfo by Sir Robert Sibbald, in his Na- 
tural Hiftory of Scotland, book 3. part 2. chap. 12. under 
the article Concha Atlatifera. A late author aflerts, that 
the barnacles lay their eggs, and leaving them at the mer- 
cy of the waves, they ftick to what they happen to meet 
with, rotten timber, or 'maritime plants, and fo are 
hatched. 

Figured Stones. — On the vpefl fide of Sandwick parifh, 
along the craggy clitls, are found, horizontally laid, caufe- 
ways, or ftratums of figured itones, of various irregular fi- 
gures, the work of nature, and tht elFed of time ; but 
none of thefe figured Itones bear any rekmblange to birds

or fiihes. Near to thefe figured ftones, there is, in a chafiu. 

m thefe craggy dlffs, a figure bearing a refemblance to a 

bifliop drefled in his Epifcopal robes*. 

On the eaft fide of the parifh of Sandwick, near the con- 
lines of the parifh of Stennels, are to be feen the beds, from 
whence it is fuppofed the large (landing ftones, which com- 
pofe the druidical templfe ereded in that pariOi, have been- 
taken. This bed, from whence thefe ftones have been 
taken, is about a mile and a half diftant from the place- 
where thefe ftones are erefted. They muft have had, in 
ancient times, fome method of moving large bodies,, that 
has not probably been^ handed down to us. 

Antiquities. —ThQx^ is in the parifh of Stromnefs, con- 
tiguous to where the church of that parilh formerly ftood, 
a fpot of ground of about half an acre, which bears the 
name of the Moaker-houfe, (monks houfe), which has pro- 
bably been the feat of fome religious houfe in the times of 
Popery. On the weft coaft of the parifti of Sandwick, 
clofe by the fea-ftiore, is to be feen the ruins or remains of 
a large Vpuilding, which yet bears the name of the Caftle of 
Snufgar. 

Tumuli. — There are feveral tumuli, barrows, or bury- 
ing-places, in thefe parifties. One of thefe, containing , 
three ftone chefts, was opened iit the parifli. of Sandwick, 
by Sir Jofeph Banks, in prefence of Dr Solander, Ir Van 
Troil, and Dr Lind, on their return from Iceland in 1772. 
In one of thefe chefts or coffins was found a human flkele- 
ton, lying on its fide, with the knees bent ; in the hollow 
of which was found a bag, which appeared to be made of 
rufties, and contained a parcel of bones bruifed fmall, and : 

alfo 

* See a particular account of thefe figured ftones in the ift volume ^ 
tliC'Tranfadtions of. the Antiquarian Society of Edinburgh. 



Sf Sandwkk and Stromnefs. ij^^ 

fome human teeth. It was fuppofed by Sir Jofeph 
•Banks and Dr Solander, that this bag contained the re- 
■Hiams or afhes of his wife, or of fome near relation, after 
"Durning. 

In the fecond of thefe chefts was found a Ikele.on in a 
fitting poSure, as if feated on the ground, and the legs 
flretched out horizontally. To keep the body erea, Danes 
were butlt up oppofite to tl,e breaft, as high as the xrown 
of he head The whole was cohered with a large ftone. 

In the th,rd cheft was found, in one end, the bones of a 
human body thrown together promifcuonily ; i„ th. other

Jiearin? of it, and fuppofing that it contained fome money, 
went to the place clandeftinely on the night, and broke it. 
Some of its fragments were fent to Sir Jofeph Banks, who 
could not difcover whether it was made of ftone, or fome 
Other compomid matter. 

Thefe tumuli were probably raifed before the introduc- 
tion of Chriftianity into thefe iflands, and by confequence 
?it leaft twelve or thirteen centuries ago, or more, if what 
hiftorians tells us be true, that Servanus, (St Serf), precep- 
tor to the famous Kentigern, was Biftiop of Orkney about 
the year 560; and it is to be prefumed, that Chriftianity 
was preached here before the regular eftablifhment of bi- 
fliops : And the inhabitants of thefe iflands having recei- 
ved Chriftianity, continued, in fo far as w^ know, to be 
lleadily attached to it, and therefore would probably then 
xelinquifh. their former method of burial ; and as a proof 
of their attachment to Chriftianity at a later period, they 
fent, in 1071, one of their clergy to the Archbifliop of 
Yo-k who then poff^ffed a jurifdidion over the Church of 
Scotland, defiring that he would conftitute that clergyman 
to be their bifliop. 

Chapels - The remains of feveral old ruinous chapels are 
to be found in thefe parilhes, but there are no particular 
traditions concerning them.

Eminent Men. — Thefe pariflies have produced no men 
eminent in literature, arts, or arms, nor have any relided 
here diftinguilhed for rank, unlefs George Graham, the laft 
Bifliop of Orkney, who had a country feat in each of thefe 
parifhes. — Several young men have gone abroad in th6 
feafaring and mercantile line, who have rifen to opulence, 
and it is to thefe lines that their genius and opportunities 
lead them. As the village of Stromnefs cannot be confi- 
dered as of more than a century's ftanding, there has not 
as yet, perhaps, been time enough to prove whether the 
genius of the people of this village may lead them to ex- 
cel in literature, and the higher attainments of fcience ; 
and they are, perhaps, as ufeful to themfelves and their 
country, in the proteffions they at prefent purfue, as they 
would be in thefe. 

Treatment of Pnpwrecked People. — Thofe that have the 
misfortune to be fhip wrecked on the coafts of thefe parifh- 
es ufually receive all neceflary affiftance- The charge 
made for fuch affiftance has indeed been fcrupled, and con- 
fequently often fettled by the Vice-Admiral Depute. In 
1771, a flopp laden with geneva and lintfeed, was wrecked 
clofe by the parilh-church of Sand wick; and, as no other 
fecure place could be had fo near, the minifter of thefe 
parifhes, (Mr James Tyrie), from a principle of humanity, 
and hearkening to the didlates of benevolence, rather than 
to prudence and a ftrid regard to the duties of his ftation, 
conft-nted, along with the heritors, that the cargo lliould 
be lodged in the church, until it could be conveniently re- 
moved

-oved to a place of fafety. I„ ,788 a Ihip laden with . 
dears was wrecked at the fame place. The cargo was fa. 
ved by the affiftance of the people of that parifh, but the 
•^aptam, or owners, either refufed or delayed to pay the 
lalvage as previoufly agreed upon. This delay in pay- 
ment occafioned the plunder of the cargo of a fmall floop 
wrecked in the fame place in 1790. The people, difap! 
pointed of their juft espeftations of the falvage due them 
for the former wreck, would not work to fave the cargo of 
this floop, nor was there any perfon of fufficient influence 
»n the parifli to direft them. The Captain took little con- 
cern in the matter, and the Vice-Admiral Depute was 
•diftant 15 miles. As the mob often are influenced by paf- 
fion and refentment rather than by juftice and reafon, they 
thought this was a proper opportunity for repaying them- 
felves of the falvage due them for the former wreck, as 
if all veflTels were the property of one man, not confidering, 
that in thus doing what they thought an aft of juftice to 
themfelves, they were doing injuftice to the proprietors of 
the cargo. Others thought, that as no perfon appeared to 
direa them to fave the cargo, there would be no injuftice 
in taking away what, in a few hours, would be loft in the 
fea, and confequently of no value to any perfon. The car- 
go was confequently plundered, and feveral perfons were 
criminally tried before the Jufticiary Court, but none were 
condemned ; all were acquitted. This is the only inftance 
wherein any perfon belonging to thefe pariflies has been 
criminally tried — The Ihipwrecks on the coafts of thefe 
pariflies are not many, as may be feen by the following 
lift for the period of 33 years laft paft.

higher price got for beef, butter, poultry, &amp;c. but it does 
not tend to raife the price of grain, for grain is generallj 
as high, and fometimes higher, in other parts of the coun- 
ty, than it is here ; and when the little advantages which, 
the farmer has by the higher price of thefe fmall articles, 
are balanced with the difadvantages he feels from the fear- 
city of fervants, and their increafed wages, both occafioned 
by the frequent opportunities which the young men have 
of going abroad, it will be found that the farmers advan- 
tages are not great ; which appears evident from this, 
that the farmers were in as good circumftances 50 years 
ago as they are at prefent. 

The inhabitants of the village of Stromnefs certainly 
feel the advantages refulting from the refort of ftiipping, 
for there are feveral who leave their mechanic trades and 
betake themfelves to traffic with the fhipping, and in a few 
years raife fome little capital, and build houfes. By the 
refort of fliipping a readier fale is found for the ftockings 
manufadtured here, which is one of the greateft advantages, 
as it encourages honeft induftry. The money fpent here 
by feamen, or given for provifions, circulates, and tends to 
increafe the wealth of the place ; but it alfo probably pro- 
duces thefe efFeds : The ftyle and tafte for better living is 
hereby increafed, and this tafte being once acquired, leads 
many to go abroad to acquire wealth to gratify it, which 
occafions a fcarcity of hands for the purpofes of agricul- 
ture. 

It might be reckoned among the advantages, that there 
is plenty of limeftone in thefe parifhes ; but through the 
fcarcity of hands, and of fuel, it is of no fervice— The 
fcarcity of fbel is a great difadvantage, and in a few years, 
muft hurt agriculture, and leffen the value of property .-I

The payment of the rent moftly in malt is a bar to im- 
provements, becaufe, on fmall farms, they cannot afFord to 
pay the rent, and alfo fallow any confiderable pait of their 
lands. 

Means hy which their Condition might he ameliorated. 

The condition of the farmers might be ameliorated by 
thefe means ; ift, To grant them long kafes : 2dly, To 
repair their hotlfes : 3dly, That the proprietor inclofe, at 
his own expence, one or two acres on each farm : 4thly, 
That the proprietor fupply the farmer with grafs-feeds. for 
the firll year to fow thefe two acres, and diredt him in the 
management, and make it a nullity in his leafe if he doe^ 
not keep the like quantity of ground in fown grafs, for a 
certain number of years, until he is fenfible of the benefit 
of it : fthly, That one-half the rent be converted to mo- 
ney : 6thly, That the roads be made good : 7thly, That 
the limeitone be burnt, fince, dear as the fuel is, it may be 
burnt to advantage- 
As there is plenty of water, » tannery might be efta- 
blifhed near the village of Stromnefs. Some branch of 
manufadiure might be eftablilhed, wherein to employ the 
women to more advantage than knitting ftockings. 

As the genius of the people is turned to fea-alFairs, it 
would be of great advantage if there were a few men of 
fpirit and enterprize, and poflefled of capital fufficient Jo 
carry on the herring fifliery, rope-making,, fail-making, 
net-making. As there is a great refort of Ihipping, there 
would be a readier fale for fome of thefe articles than at 
Cromarty, where fome of thefe branches were carried on 
by the late Mr Rofs of that place.

Name^ iSc. 

TN the records of the prefbytery, the name of this parifh 
is varioufly fpelled Deare, Diere, Bier, and Beer. The 
laft now prevails ; and the word is faid to be of Gaelic ori- 
gin. Be a'r'y contrafted for Be adhra, fignifies, The wor^ 
Jhip of God, and may have been applied to this plate, be- 
caufe here probably the firll church in this corner was 
erefted. Deer is the mother-church of the prefbytery. 

The parifh of Fetter- Angus, which is a detached portion 
of the county of Banff, and lies along the north-eafl fide of 
Beer, was annexed to this parifh in the year 1618. Before 
that period, the cure of the former was fcrved by the mi 
mfter of St Fergus. The foundation of the church, which 
like the parifh, has been fmaU, is to be feen, and the church- 
yard is ftiU ^fed for burial-ground.

Situation, Extent, Wc— Deer is fituated almoft in the 
centre of the diftrid of Buchan, and is bounded on the N. 
by the parifli of Strichen ; on the E. by Lonmay and 
Longfide ; on the S. by Cruden and Ellon ; and on the W. 
by Newdeer. From N. to S. its greateft extent is lo 
miles ; and its mean breadth may be 5f miles. The high 
road from Aberdeen to Fraferburgh cuts it longitudinally, 
i and interfe6led by the roads from Banff and Old Meldrum 
to Peterhead. One branch of the river Ugie runs through 
the middle of the parifh ; the other branch enters it for a 
Ihort way on the N. E. Thefe, and the other ftreams in 
the parilh, turn 13 corn-itiills, 3 fulling-mills, 2 lint-milJs, 
and a fet of bleaching machinery. 

Surface and Soil. —There is no hill of any confiderable 
altitude in this parifli. Irregular ridges of riling grounds 
run through it in every diredion, forming a multitude of 
vallies equally irregular. Some of the uplands are covered 
with heath, and a poor kind of grafs ; others are planted 
with wood ; many of them are cultivated ; and moft of 
them fufceptible of cultivation. The braes, and lower 
parts of the parilh, are in general beft cultivated, and well 
adapted either for corn or pafture. An irregular plain of 
confide rable extent, lying round the church and village of 
Deer, . is reckoned one of the beft fummer fcenes in the 
nocth.

State 



of Deer. 



State of Propef'ty. — This parifh contains 120 old ploughs 
of land, in former times one tenant poffeffed a plough^ 
and had always under him feveral cottars^ or fubtenants, 
who held of no other fuperior, and were bound to perfonal 
fervice for part of the rents of their crofts. There are ftill 
fubtenants on the larger farms. The generality of tenants, 
however, hold immediately of the heritor j and the prac- 
tice of dividing the ploughs, which is very general here, 
accommodates the farms to the circumftances of the loweft 
clafe of people, and holds out to them a more independent, 
though feldom a lefs laborious way of life than the fub- 
tenants enjoy. There are at prefent about 350 tenants in 
the parilh. Nineteen years is the moll common term of a 
leafe. 

Farming, ^c.— -The old fyftem of hufbandry prevailed 
univerfally in this place till about 40 years ago, when the 
introduaion of lime gave it a new turn. Watering begaiy 
to be ufed here about the fame time with apparent fuccefs ; 
but experience at laft ftiewed it to be unfit for this foil! 
Water, however, has been applied in this country in gene- 
ral only for raifing crops of corn; and, perhaps, if watered 
meadows were laid out in the accurate manner in which 
they.have been done in Wiltlhire, and other counties in 
the fouth of England, they may be, allowing for the diffe- 
rence ;of climate, nearly equally beneficial here. Soon 
after water began to be ufed as a manure, the fowing of 
turmp and grafs-feeds was introduced into the pari/h and 
fince th.s was generally praftifed, agriculture has under- 
gone little alteration. Lime is always the firft ftep in im 
prove.r.ent, and the farm is afterwards managed by white 
and green crops and pafture. Some perfons have cfta- 
bhmed a recu).r rotation of crops on their farms; but. 
this IS very far from being the general praftice. The iort-

nefs of the leafes is particularly an obftacle to fyftematic 
farming. The beft rotations eftabliflied here, though not 
the beft to be wiflied, are on infield, or ftrong land, iftyear,

and 2d, oats ; 3d, dunged and turnip, or peafe ; 4th, 1)ear 
or oats; 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, pafture *. 

The lateft improvements in the farming line which have 
taken place here, are the revival of work-oxen, two-horfe 
ploughs, winnowing machines in mills and bams, different 
fpecies of early oats, particularly Magbiehill loats, and 
brick pavement in corn-kilns. Four or fix oxen are ufed 
in a plough, yoked with collars. Brick pavementfo r 
kilns deferves the attention of every farmer. A kiln, 9 
feet in diameter, cofts L. 3 Sterling, and will dry 8 or la 
bolls a-day. 

The rent of land in this parifti is as follows : Infield, 
from 10 s. to L. 1 per acre ; outfield, from 2 s. 6 d. to 12 s. ;

meadow, from 7 s. 6d. to 15 s.; pafture and hill-ground, 
from 6d. to 2 s. 6d. 

Rearing of cattle has, for thefe ten or twelve years paft, 
been the moft lucrative part of the farming bufinefs, great 
numbers having been bought by drovers for the Engliidi 
market. A couple of oxen fells at from L. 10 to L. 20 
Sterling. Sufficient attention, however, has not been paid 
to the breed. The breed of horfes has been much impro- 
ved of late years, by means of itinerant ftallions, and their 
value is generally double that of oxen. The number of 
black cattle in the parifh may be eftimated at 3400 j the 
number of horfes at 700. 

Produce. — About 20,000 * bolls of grain are raifed an- 
nually in this parift), of which one-fifth may be barley. It 
is fuppofed, that 4000 bolls of meal and grain are in ordi- 
nary years exported. Oat-meal fells at from 10 s. to 16 s. 
per boll of 8 ftones Dutch. Bear-meal is of one-fourth lefs 
value. No lefs than 3000 bufhels of malt, according to 
the excife-books, are annually made, and as the hear of 
this country is inferior in weight to that of the more fou- 
thern counties, the price of malt is feldom more than 4 s.- 
above the price of oat-meal current at the time. Sixteea 
hogfheads of lintfeed, ihoftly American, are fown annually 
in this parilh. This is reckoned fufficient for 36 acres ; 
and the produce, on an average, does not much exceed 
1000 Itones of fcutched flax. The tenant of one of the 
lint-mills has, tor feveral years paft, received the greateft 
premium for raifing flax of any in the county. Hay is fold 
at 6 d. per ftone, equal to 20 lb. Dutch. An acre of tur- 
nips, when carried off the field, fetches L. 4 Sterling. Po- 
tatoes are univerfally cultivated, and fell at jd.^r 6d. 
per peck, of 2 ftones Dutch. Cabbages are planted in the

Ihirtage, Multure, and Sermces.—Klmo^i all the tenants 
are bound to grind their corn at a certain mill ; a pradice 
attended with many inconveniencies. Why fliould a mil. 
ler be on a different footing from any other tradefman ? 

Multure is generally high in this parifti *. In fome mills 
it is converted, and paid with the rent ; and fhould be fo 
in every cafe. This, however, is not always praaicable, 
as the rent and multure are often paid to different heritors ; 
to remedy which would require a ilatute, abolifhing thir- 
lage, and empowering every landholder to redeem his 
eftate from this burden. And a ftatute, which equally re- 
fpedls the good of the heritor and tenant, which would put 
a flop to an intricate and unreafonable pra6lice obtruded 
on the prefeht times by the ufe and wont of darker ages, 
and which would at once prevent law-fuits, mifunderftand- 
ings, and complaints, certainly merits attention. Services 
are not univerl'ally abolifhed. 

ManufaSijires. — A great deal of flax is given out to fpin 
jn this parifli for the Aberdeen and Peterhead manufac- 
tures. A confiderable quantity of linen-yarn, fpun from 

home- 



f Multure moft commonly is one-fixteenth of the whole grain raifed, 
except what is ufed for feed, whether milled, fold, or malted. This, 
with the bannocks, kna-vcjhips, and other namelefs mill-tolls, (which are 
foroetimes one-fourth, fometiraes one-eight and one-fourth of the multure, 
and at fome mills alraoft twice as much as at others), forms a heavy bur- 
den on improving tenants; nearly thus :

of Deer. 

Home-grown flax, is annually exported to the fouthern bo- 
roughs. In and near the villages of Stewartfield and Deer, 
3000 yards of linens, checks, and linfey-wooHeys, are every 
year made for fale. The Aberdeen merchants hkve been 
long in the praftice of giving out wool to be knitted into 
ftockings. Spinning and knitting form the chief employ- 
ment of the women •, and a very confiderable fum of mo- 
ri^y is brought into the parifb yearly from thef6 fources. 
A woman earns 2 s. or 2 s. 6 d. a-week. 

In the year 1783, a bleachfield, and complete fet of ma- 
chmery, were erefted by the lat^ Mr Burnett of Denns in 
the neighbourhood of his village of Stewartfield. At pr.- 
fent there are about 350 pieces of cloth, and about 600 
fpmdles of yarn, bleached annually. The Honourable 
Board of Truftees, a few years ago, gave L. 30 Sterling for

In the fouth-weft fide of the parifh, there is abundance 
of that fpecies of quartz called felt-fpar, or rombic quartz, 
both above and below the furface of the ground. The 
late Mr Garden of Troup, to whom tl^e eftate belonged on 
■which it is found in greateft plenty, fent a fpecimen of it 
to a glafshoufe in Newcaftle, which was approved of, and 
a confiderable quantity was in confequence exported ; but 
the expence of land-carriage, or fome other caufe, foon put 
a flop to this branch of commerce *. 

Pieces of cryftalized quartz are likewife met with occa- 
fionally; the pureft in the form of regular hexagonal 
prifms, pointed at the ends. 

A dark blue, and a very white granite, are the ftones 
moft ufed in building. 

Church, Poor, and School. — A commodious church, fuf- 
ficient to contain 1400 perfons, was built in the year 1789, 
for L. 700 Sterling. The ftipend may be valued at L. 80 
Sterling. The glebe meafures 2.9-^- acres nearly; the 
greateft part of it good land. Mr Bafil Anderfon is the 
piefent incumbent. The crown is patron. 

There is a Seceding meeting-houfe in the parifh, and an 
Englifti Epifcopal chapel, where moft of the gentry in the 
parifti and neighbourhood attend. There are 39 men and 
47 women prefently upon the poors lift +, who receive from 
6 s to L. 2 each per annum, in fmall fums quarterly. The

weekly colleSions amount to no lefs than L. 40 Sterling a- 
year ; which, with what is collefted about the time of the 
communion, the intereft of a bill of L. 45 Sterling, 7nort~ 
cloth-money, forfeited matrimonial pledges, makes 
about L. 60, which is annually dilburfed by the kirk-fefllon. 
This fum, together with what is diftributed by the other 
congregations, is found adequate for the ordinary neceflities 
of the poor ; and when an extraordinary cafe occurs, inti- 
mation is made from the pulpit, and a colle6lion made foe 
the purpofe. 

The late Mr Burnett of Denns left, by deed of fettle- 
ment, the lands of Andiefwells and Backhill, renting about 
L. 18 Sterling for the behoof of the indigent and infirm oa 
his own eftates in this parifh ; with this referve, that if 
ever poor-rates be eftablifhed here, the mortification lhall 
ceafe. 

The emoluments of the fchool and feffion-clerkfhip a- 
mount to L. 3c per annum. The number of fcholars, ac- 
cording to the feafon, varies from ao to 50, who pay quar- 
terly as. 6 d. for Latin, a s. for arithmetic, and i s. 6 d, 
for Englifli. The fees for other branches of education are 
at the difcretion of the teacher. 

Villages and Population. — There are three villages in this 
parifh, two of which have been built within thefe 35 years ; 
Fetterangus, by Mr Fergufon of Pitfour, and Stewartfield, 
by Mr Burnett of Denns ; the village of Deer is upon the 
property of Mr Ruffel of Moncoffer, and is of very long 
ftanding. Owing to thefe, and the fplitting of farms, the 
population of this parifli has very much increafed. In the 
year 1750, the number of communicants in the Ellabliihed 
Church was 718; for fome years ^oafl, the number has. 
been little fliort of 1400. By a corred lift, taken in the

The parifhioners are in general, a decent, fober, charitable

favourable to virtue ; public worfhip, and the ordinances of 
religion, are attended with a laudable punctuality. 

Difeafes, l^c. — No difeafe has of late years raged here 
with greater mortality than a putrid fore throat. It 
chiefly attacked children, fometimes cutting off two, three, 
and four of a family. Inoculation for the fmall-pox 
has been practi fed here with fuccefs. Laft year (1792) a 
furgeon of this place, humanely inoculated gratis above 
100 children, moftly of the lower clafs, of which- only one 
died. Many people after all are very much averfe to in- 
oculation. Confuflt{)tive complaints are not unfrequent 
among the young ; rheumatifm afflidls thofe of riper years.

It is an uncommon circumftance, and fliews that this place 
no means unfavourable to health, that there is jufl 
now in the village of Deer a family of five perfons, in 
which there has been neither birth, marriage, burial, nor 
bedrid perfon thefe 50 years ! The mother of this family, 
who is the oldefl perfon in the parifli, thinks herfelf about 
her hundredth year. It is equally worthy of obfervation,

There are 2 four-wheeled chaifes and a hearfe in the 
parifh. 

About 900 acres have been planted iij this parifti, moft- 
ly with Scotch firs at firft, and afterwards filled up with a 
variety of other trees, of which Mr Fergufon's plantations 
amount to about 650 acres. Pines and larches have in ge- 
neral thriven better than the Scotch fir. Larches, indeed, 
have fucceeded on northerly expofures, where every other 
kind of wood, which was tried, had failed. Of hard wood, 
beech, afli, birch, oak, and plane trees, have come to confi- 
derable fize. Hedge-rows to a great extent have in many 
places been planted round inclofures, along with ftone and 
»urf fences. 

There is plenty of game in this parifli, as groufe, par- 
tridges, woodcocks, fnipes, and hares ; befides wild pigeons, 
wild ducks, teals, herns, and occafionally wild geefe and 
fwans; there are alfo' hawks, owls, and great numbers of 
crows, (which are very dcftruftive), and finging birds, as 
the thrufh, blackbird, linnet, goldfinch, Sifc. Foxes infeft 
this place, together with badgers, otters, polecats, wea- 
fels, l^c. 

The ftreams here abound with falmon, and excellent 
trout of different kinds, and angling is a favourite diver- 
fion. 

Seed-time is from the middle of March to the end of 
April. Harveft commences about the beginning of Sep- 
tember, and commonly lafts fix weeks. In the year 1782, 
the crop in this parifh was fuppofed to fall fhort about one 
half of the ufual produce. Twelve hundred bolls of bear- 
meal and peafe were imported, moftly by refiding heritors. 
The tenants, however, got the better of this flroke by an 
extraordinary crop in 1784, which, with the nie of cattle, 
brought this country to a pitch of profperity, which it pro- 
bably never before enjoyed. ^

A canal betwixt this place and Peterhead is prafticable 
•n a very moderate expence. Should fuch a meafure ever 
be put in execution, and long leafes with progreffive rifes 
of rent be granted, the agriculture and manufaftures of this 
diftria would be improved, and the population increafed to 
a degree that is at prefent only conceivable. 

Since the duty was taken off coals, the ufe of them in- 
creafes here daily ; and to thofe who are more than a cou- 
ple of miles diftant from mofs, they prove as cheap fuel as 
peat, the procuring of which is a very tedious and expen- 
five work. The time that would be gained by the ufe of 
coals for agricultural improvement, is a matter of fo great 
importance, that nothing but want of experience could hin- 
der the farmer a moment from adopting them. 

The great quantity of linen-yarn fent out of the parifli 
might be bought up at home, and would afford a goodopen- 
ing for a thread manufadory. 

Antiquitieu-^Yh^ antiquities of this place are, druidical " 
circles, fmgle monumental pillars, cairns, in-trenchments, 
and an abbey. 

There were, not many years ago, the remains of up- 
wards of a dozen druidical circles in this parifli. One of 
t-hem, fituated on the hill of Parkhoufe, not far from the 
village of Deer, is the moft entire. The horizontal ftone 
on the fouth is 14 feet long, containing about 350 folid 
feet. At the diftance of about 500 yards, on the north- 
eaft fide of the fame hill, were, not long ago, the ruins of 
a fmall village, fuppofed to have been the refidence of the 
druids. A number of little yards were to be feen all a- 
round It ; one of which ftill retains a fuperior verdure, and 
ferves now to Ihow the fpot where the village once ftood.

name of the hourachs. The walls were built of ftone and 
clay ; the floors were paved with ftones. A farmer in the 
neighbourhood, about 20 years ago, applied the ftones, 
which were all of fmall fize, to ered inclofures. In remo- 
ying the rubbifh, he found a cylindrical ftone, like a fmall 
mi!I-flone ; probably part of the quearn, or hand-mill, an- 
ciently ufed in this country for grinding corn. Two cir- 
cular huts, containing fome afhes, feem to have been corn- 
kilns. 

A cairn on the hill of Auchmacher was opened fome

<p>

Situation., Extent, i^c. 

THE parifli of Legerwood lies in the {hire of Berwick^ 
in the prefbytery of Lauder, in the Synod of Merfe 
and Teviotdale. It is nearly on the confine between Lau- 
derdale and the Lammermuir-hills. Immediately around 
it are the pariflies of Gordon, Earlfton, (or EIreflington), 
Melrofe, Lauder, Weftruther.— It is an area of about three 
miles in length by two and a half in breadth, or of nearly 
eight fquare miles. It confifts of an affemblage of hilJs, 
gently rifing to a confiderable height from the eaftern bank 
of the Leader. Anciently, as we have reafon to believe, 
thefe hills, and the intermediate glens,, and all the circum- 

jacent 



of LegerwoocL 



4§5 



jacent country, were covered thick with wood. The Bri- 
tons, the Romans, the Anglo-Saxons, the Pi6ls, the Scots, 
fucceflively pofleflbrs of thefe regions, confumed by degrees 
the greater part of the woods, in the ravages of war, in. 
opening paffages through the country, m fuel and donaeftic 
ufes, in clearing the ground for cultivation. The marfhes 
and the ftrata of peat-earth likewife evince, that much of 
the {landing timber was anciently fulFered to grow to de- 
cay, to fall down, and to moulder away on the ground 
where it had been produced. Here,, as in almoft every 
other part of Scotland, the deftrudlion of the native woods 
appears to have been fucceeded on the hilly grounds by the 
growth of heath, on the Jower and flat trafts by the flag- 
nation of water, and by mofles and water-plants. Such 
was the general afpe£l of the lands of this parifli, except 
on fome narrow fields around the farm-fleads, till it was 
happily changed by the cultivation of thefe lafl ,30 or 4a 
years. 

Soil. — On the lower declivities of the hills, and in the? 
narrow vales dividing them, the foil is commonly a deep 
ilratum of blackifli mould, compofed of fand from commi- 
nuted fragments of the adjacent rocks, of the exuviEe and 
remains of decayed vegetables, and of oils and falls from 
the atmofphere and from manures. On the cultivated up- 
lands the ftratum of the foil is more fliallow, and is of a red- 
difli colour, as containing a larger fhare of ftony matter 
from the rocks, and a fmaller proportion of vegetable 
mould. The marfhes prefent deep flrata of peat-earth, of 
which the appearance and qualities are fufficiently, known. 
Its compofitioa is evidently, where it is the mofl perfeft, 
from the remains of decayed ligneous vegetables, with the 
occafional intermixture of a portion of the remains of gra. 
mineous vegetables, and fometimes of a little fand. Some-

times, by the efficacy of its feveral ingredients, vegetables 
of all forts, and even other fubftances, are long preferved 
from decay in fuch beds of peat-earth. Hence are the 
trunks, not only of oaks, but alfo of other trees, often found, 
tinconfumed and frefh amidft ftrata of this earth ; and 
hence the graffes, which often appear in a ftate of good 
prefervation, in peats of a light, fpungy confiftency. The 
chemical conftituents of pure peat-earth, are plainly, car- 
bone or pure coal, oils of different forts, the refinous ex- 
trad of vegetables, and fimple earth. On the dry heathy 
heights in this parifti, the foil is commonly a thin layer of 
.gravel, of peat-earth, or of both together. 

Climate. — As to climate, the fnows and frofts of winter 
a£l here fometimes perhaps a little longer, and with fome- 
what more feverity, than in the more fouthern, lower ly- 
ing, and more richly cultivated lands of the Merfe by the 
relative highnefs of its fituation, too, this parilh is not a 
little expofed to the winds and rains of fpring and autumn ; 
and where the foil is thin and dry, its vegetation is liable 
to be parched by the droughts of fummer. In the end of 
April 1795, the progrefs of the labours of fpring was 
nearly eight days later here than on the low grounds of 
Mid-Lothian. 



Difeafes. — The difeafes with which the inhabitants of 
this parifli are liable to be afflided are, the epidemical dif- 
eafes common through the whole kingdom, fmall-pox, 
meafles, b'c. and thofe other diftempers which are ufually 
thought to be produced by exceffive toil, and by unfeafon- 
able expofure to a cold and humid atmofphere, fever, cough, 
catarrh, rheumatifm, confumption, l^c. They are men- 
tioned in this place, becaufe there is believed to be always 

an

an intimate connexion between the difeafes prevalent in 
any diftrid, and the nature of its climate. 

Wild Animals. — The wild animals of this parifh are not 
now numerous. The fox fometimes infefts the fheep pa- 
ftures. Hares are plentiful. Thofe little mifchievous qua- 
drupeds, which prey upon poultry, have not yet been wbol, 
ly exterminated. The houfes, barns, and barn-yards are 
not free from mice and rats. Adders, although rare, are 
fometimes feen balking among the heath, in the warm days 
offummer. The rivulets afford trouts. The trads covered 
with heath, are frequented by muirfowls, and the corn-fields 
are haunted by partridges. During the long continued and 
intenfe feverities of the winter 1794-5, many of thefe wild 
animals periled by cold and hunger, and many, in the ex- 
treme weaknefs to which they were reduced, became an 
eafy prey to whoever chofe to purfue them. One gentle- 
man had a number of hares taken alive, which he con- 
fined in an apartment, and fed plentifully with corn till the 
fnow began to difappear, then generoufly fet them at 
liberty. 

Number of Inhabitants,— Tht number of the inhabitants 
of this parilh has increafed, in proportion as its cultiva. 
tion has been extended and improved. In the year 1755, 
the population of Legerwood was flated to Dr Webfter to 
amount to 398 fouls. It is inhabited at prefent by 424 
perfons in all, of both fexes, and of every age and condi- 
tion

dent. 

Farmers.~ThQ whole lands of the parifli are divided 
into 17 farms, large or fmall, which are occupied by as 
many different farmers. Thefe farmers, and the hinds, la- 
bourers and ihepherds in their fervice, with their refpeftive 
families, compofe almoft the whole population. 

HuJhandty.—B.ixi!a^ndTy is, then, almoft the only mode 
of iuduflry purfued here. Until within thefe laft 50 years, 
the farmers of Legerwood were almoft exclufively graziers 
and ftiepherds. What little tillage they carried on, for the 
purpofe of raifing bread-corn for the immediate fupply of 
their own families, was upon a plan of agriculture which 
has fince appeared to have been extremely unikllful. The 
ground was broken up with a fallow ; three fucceffive 
crops of oats were then raifed upon it ; after this, it was 
left for eight or nine years unploughed, that it might, in 
this period of ceffation, recruit its exhaufted fertility. 

At length, as a more enlightened and induftrious agricul- 
ture began to advance, with its improvements from the 
fouthern diftrifts of Berwickftiire, northwards, through the 
reft of Scotland ; the farmers of Legerwood were by degrees 
convinced, that even as graziers they fliould be greatly 
gainers by a more extenlive, and a mor« fkilfully conduced 
tillage. They adopted, one after another, that rotation of 
crops which ftill prevails in the parilh. The fallow is dif- 
'.ifed ; ley is for the two firft years after it has been broken 
up, fown with oats ; on the third year it is manured with 
dung, and fown with turnip-feed, or with peafe, if dung be 
wanting for manure ; yet a fourth year, the fame field is 

ploughed. 



Gf Legcrwood. 489 

iplcfughed, and the feed is now oats or barley, with grafs- 
feeds. Where the foil is light and thin, only three fuc- 
ceffive crops are raifed upon it ; the fecond of the crops of 
oats above mentioned being here omitted. After this ro- 
tation of crops, the field remains unploughed, till the gralTes, 
of which the feeds were mixed with the laft feed of barley 
or oats, begin to be exterminated from the fward, and the 
native heath and bog-grafles to be unfeafonably renewed. 

The manures employed in thefe procefles of agriculture 
are folely dung, as is above mentioned, and lime, imported 
from Mid-Lothian. The dung from the ftalls of the cattle 
is carefully accumulated in the farm-yard, and is, in the 
proper feafbn, conveyed thence to be fpread upon the fields 
under tillage ; or the cattle are at times folded in the fields, 
fo as to manure the ground of the fold as they drop their 
dung, without farther caTe on the part of the owners, than 
that of removing the fold occafionally from one fituation 
to another. The diftance of the lime-kilns of Mid-Lothian 
would render lime an eflormoufly expenfive article of ma 
nure to the farmers of Legerwood and its neighbourhood 
were xt not that grain and other things are ufually carried 
to Dalkeith market, in the carts which return loaded with 
lime. Fields covered deep with ftrata of peat-earth are 
often quickened by the manure of lime to ama:.ing ferti- 
lity. Where the foil is of fufficient depth, dung often pro- 
duces an exceffive luxuriancy of crop, in which the vL- 
tation is wafted in ftraw and empty ears.

Statijlical Account 



Potatoes are cultivated in confiderable quantities in tUa 
pariai, as over the reft of Scotland ; but do not enter inva- 
nablj into the rotation, and are not in anj peculiar degree 
a favourite article of crop. 

Various forts of feed-oats have been tried here. Blainf- 
lej oats and red oats are the two fpecies the moft generally 
Ibwn. Red oats are found to fucceed peculiarly well on 
the foil and in the climate of Legerwood ; yielding, at an 
average, eight bolls in the hundred of larger increafe than 
any other fort of feed oats ; thickening furprifingly on the 
field as they grow up, from a thin fowing; enduring the 
autumnal winds with comparatively little fliaking of the 
ears ; affording the befl flraw ; and giving, in meal, half a 
ftone more from the boll of rough corn, than the Blainfley 
oats yield. 

But turnips are, above all others, the favourite article of 
crop. They are precious, as green food, equally to Iheep 
and black cattle during winter ; the manure and culture 
neceflary to produce a crpp of turnips, ferve admirably to 
prepare the field for the cultivation and produce of the en- 
fuing year ; the wafte of the turnips that remains uncon- 
fumed by the cattle, forms alfo a rich manure to the ground 
on which they are fcattered. 

Horfes are the only beafts of draught or burden employ- 
ed in this parifli. All the implements of hulbandry, carts, 
ploughs, harrows, 'iSc. are of the moft advantageous con- 
ftruftion known in the county. A double plough for tur-

by one or two horfes, is alfo in ufe here, and is found to 
afford a very convenient abridgment of labour. Two 
threfliing-machines have been already ereded in this pariftj, 
and there is a third about to be fet up in the prefent fum- 
mer (1795), at the firft coft of from L. 60 to L. 100 Sterr 
ling. But this expence is quickly i-epaid by the faving of 
labour, wUich is obtained from the ufe of the threfliing- 

machine.

machine. Here are two corn-mills, which are in part fup- 
ported bj the reftri^lions of thirlage upon the lands of the 
parifli. Happilj, modes of mutual accommodation have 
been generally adopted between the farmers, the millers, 
and the landholders, which prevent thefe reftriftions from 
being felt as intolerably grievous. The ploughmen in this 
parilTi are eminently dexterous and ll-cilful. Three fmiths 
and two joiners perform that work in wood andiron, which 
js requifite to repair, from time to time, the implements of 
farm -labour, He. 

Yet, however Ikilful and induftrious the agriculture of 
Legerwood, even a ftranger might judge, at a firft afpeft, 
that the feeding and fattening of flieep and black cattle are 
the primary objeds of the induftry of the farmers of this 
parifh. 

Inclo/ures, Roads, i^c. — No inconfiderable portions of 
the lands ftill lie here and there in undrained marflies, or 
are bleakly covered with their native barren heath. Here 
is a general want of inclofures ; and thofe which appear 
are chiefly turf-dikes ; for indeed the climate, and the nib- 
bling of the fheep, are unfavourable to the thriving of 
hedges; and flones, for ftone walls of any kind, are ex- 
tremely fcarce. Except in two or tliree inftances, the pa- 
ri/h bye-roads are in a very indifferent ftate. The uplands 
and flopes are bare of wood, as in thofe wild fcenes into 
which the improvements and decorations of cultivation 
have not yet been admitted^ 

Jmma/ StocL— The horfes and other animals maintained 
on thefe farms are numerous. An hundred and i\x horfes, 
old and young, are kept for the faddle or the draught, and 
to fupply the gradual waae. The flaeep are no fewer than 
3769. The black cattle are prefent 55^; and here are 
59 fwine. 

The 



Statijlical Account 



The flieep are of a breed from Northumberland, valrr- 
able alike for mutton and for wool. They are annually 
fmeared with butter and tar, mingled in the proportion of 
four pounds of butter to one pint of tar. Thej, equally 
with the black cattle, feed' in winter on- hay and turnips ^ 
and in fummer find their food on. the open paftures. 

Grofs yearly Produce — ^Upon thefe lands, with this ftock, 
and by thefe modes, of management and: cultivation, the 
farmers of Legerwood furnifli a grofs annual produce of 
6000 bolls of corn^ worth;- L.4500 o o-

Surplus of the yearly Produce. — Thus, of the grofs pro- 
duce of the lands, there remains, after the dedu£tion of 
thefe various items of annual expenditure, only the fum of 
L. 2000 as a compenfation for the toil and Ikilful manage- 
ment of the farmers j as intcreft upon the value of their 

unperilhing 



of Legerwood,

imperlfhing ftock ; as a gradual repayment of that part of 
their ftock which is funk in improvements upon the lands j 
and as clear profits upon the various bargains of fale and 
purchafe which thej tranfaft in the courfe of the year *. 

This would appear no very confiderable return, if we 
fhould compare it with the value of the ftock and labour 
by which it is produced ; and again, with the profits which 
the fame quantity of ftock and labour would afford in feve- 
ral departments of trade and manufadures. Yet it exhi- 
bits, in no unpleafing light, the advantages which attend 
the profecution of agriculture, where the huftjandraan is 
encouraged by a leafe fufticiently long, and reafonable in 
its terms, to lay out his fortune freely in the cultivation of 
his farm, and to exert upon it all his induftry and inge- 
nuity. For moft of the lands in this parifti are poffefled 
by the tenants upon long and eafy leafes, which have given 
great encouragement to bold and expenfive agricultural 
improvements. By this management, the landholders are 
perhaps ftill more highly gainers than their tenants ; be- 
caufe, in xhtjirji place, rents that are ealily made out of 
the lands, are pundually paid, without deficiency or liti- 
gation ; and, in the fecond place, becaufe the value of lands 
is much more rapidly augmented in thefe circumftances, 
than in the cafe of fliort leafes and racked rents. 

Hinds. — The circumftances of the country, and the ge- 
nerofityofthe farmers, are fuch as to reward the toil of 
the hinds, or labourers, in. this parlfb, with a very liberal 
fhare of the produce of the lands. Married are almoft al- 
ways preferred to unmarried male-fervants, ftiepherds, or 
ploughmen. They are fettled in fnug cottages on the farms 
to which they for tlie time refpeaively belong. In grain,

money, and other articles for their fupport or accommoda- 
tion, they receive an yearly wage, varying with circum. 
fiances from L. 15 to L. 20 Sterling. Befides, each hind, 
poffeffing a cottage, is, at the fame time, obliged to furniih 
to his landlord and employer, a female-labourer, his wife, 
daughter, or fervant, to work occafionally throughout the' 
year for the hire of 8 d. a-day. 

Markets for Exports.— Oi the grain, peafe, wool, oxen 
and flieep annually produced in this parilh, the owners, af- 
ter referring thofe portions which are neceffary for the va- 
rious ufes of domeftic confumption, fell the reft to dealers, 
who refort hither to purchafe them, or export them forfale 
to the markets of Dalkeith and Kelfo. The wool is com- 
monly purchafed by or for woollen-manufafturers from 
England, Galalhiels, or Peterhead. Some Iheep of that 
age at which they are termed hogs, and a few black cattle, 
are occafionally fold into England, But, for grain of all 
forts, for oxen, cows, and Iheep, Dalkeith is the ordinary 
and principal market. Formerly here, and in the neigh- 
bourhood, were feveral dealers in meal, who purchafing 
the corn from the farmers, manufaduied it into meal for 
the markets of Kelfo, Lauder, and Dalkeith. At prefent, 
the two millers of the parilh ftill continue very properly 
to deal as meal-mongers ; but moft of the grain is exported 
unground. 

Imports. — As to the requifite imports of coals, lime, gro- 
cer's goods, draper's goods, hardware, ftationer's goods, i^c. 
thefe are all obtained from Kelfo, Lauder, Dalkeith, and 
Edinburgh. Kelfo affords the beft and moft convenient 
market for butchers meat. Lauder is the neareft poft- 
town, but too fmall a place to ferve to any confiderable ex- 
tent as a market. An attempt which is now made to find 

coals

coals on the Earl of Lauderdale's eftate, near Blackfliiells, - 
if fuccefsful, will furnilh a confiderably nearer market for 
this article of fuel, than thofe coal- works immediately a- 
round Dalkeith and Edinburgh, from which it is at pre- 
fent procured. 

Eoufes. — Here are, at Corfbie, at Weftmorayfton, and 
at Whitflade, three ancient towers, monuments of that ftate 
of the arts and manners of our anceftors; in which, faving 
ecclefiaflical edifices, there were no buildings in this coun- 
try, but the fortrefs and the cottage ; and in which, all the 
accommodation that was fought in a houfe, was barely 
Ihelter and fecurity. The prefent dwelling-houfes are 
difperfed over the farms ; only, on the farm of Legerwood 
(proper), is there fuch an alTemblage ©f houfes together, as 
compofes a hamlet, or incipient village. The houfes of the 
farmers are commonly of two ftories in height, handfomely 
and comfortably fitted up within, with a fquare of ofiice- 
houfes and a kitchen-garden contiguous, and having flocks 
of poultry feeding round them. The houfes of the hinds 
are dry, fnug, and comfortable, affording to thefe honeft 
labourers better domeftic accommodation than the greateft 
noblemen enjoyed five or fix centuries ago, in the ftrongeft 
and moft fpacious of thofe caftles, the ruins of which we 
flill admire. 

Ma7ineri, U'c—The inhabitants of this parifti appear to 
be in general healthy, fober, virtuous, induftrious, and in- 
telligent. Except about 40 Diffenters, they are all con- 
tent with the religious inftruftion to be received in their 
parifh-church ; the minifter of which enjoys a living of 
about L. 90 Sterling in yearly value, with a manfe and 
glebe. The children of the hinds are carefully fent to th 
parifti-fchool, to learn reading, writing, arithmetic, and the

farmers are enabled to give their children all the real ad- 
vantages of what is ufually called a liberal education. Moft 
of the articles of drefs ufed here are imported, not manu- 
fadured within the parifli. Here are two or three tailors, 
and one weaver — The language of this parilh having, for 
thefelaft 1200 years, been chiefly Saxon, is at prefent,

Origin of the l^ame» 

T^HERE was an eftablifliment for the Templars, or Red 
Friars, made in this place by King David I. of Scot- 
land ; hence the name of the parifli. 

S'ltofl^/o;?.— Temple lies ii Engliflj miles %th fronx 
Edinburgh. That part of the pariih which is fituated in 
the immediate vicinity of the church, is bounded on the S. 
and S. W. by the county of Tweeddale ; on the W. by 
the parifb of Pennycuik ; on the N. W. and N. by the pa- 
rifli of Primrofe ; ontheN. E. and E. by the parifli of 
Borthwick ; and on the S. E. by that of Heriot. Its great- 
eft length may be about 9 miles, and its greateft breadth 5. 
But befides this, there is another part of the parifli, Ivin J

four Engllfn miles to the eaftward, quite detached by a part 
of thd parifli of Borthwick, and infulated by the parifhes 
of Borthwick and Newbattle. It confifts of about 30Q 
acres of clay foil. I do not know how it became annexed 
to this parifti. 

CIi7nate.—r¥r:Qm. the fituation the air is cold ; the froft 
fets in early in the feafon, and continues late in the fpring; 
at other times the air is damp, occafioned by the hills at- 
trafting the lowers, and the mofs retaining the moiaure. 
So much is this the cafe, that the parifli never fufFers from 
want of rain, yet tlie people are in general healthy. 

Soils. — The arable part of the infield land confifts of light 
foil, chiefly dry and lharp, upon a gravel bottom ; the 
pther parts of the parilh confift of land of the fame quali- 
ties ; of mofly land of from three inches to two feet deep 
of mofs, chiefly wet, upon a clay or gravel bottom j and 
of mar{hy land, the foil of which is a mixture of clay and 
fand, upon a bottom of mofs, or clay, or gravel. 

Population and Price of Labour. — The number of fouls, 
from a lilt taken in 1793, was 593 ; fince that time it has 
^iminilTied, from the coal npt being wrought now upon the 
lands of Stobs, the property of James Dewar, Efq; of Vo- 
grie •, but there is a profpefl: of the number being again 
filled up, from a manufadlure being about to be eftabliflied 
in the fame place. Like other parifhes in limilar lituations, 
the number of inhabitants has greatly decreafed within 40 
years. From a lift of the examinable perfons, or of thofe 
upwards of eight years of age, taken in the year 1772, 
their number amounted to 604 ; and in the year 1755, ac- 
cording to Dr Webfter's ftatement, their number amount- 
ed to 905.

Preceding the year 1794, the average for 10 years of 
Baptifms, in a year, was ijl 
Marriages, — — 
Funerals^ — — 16 

From this, the decreafe,of the population is evident. Of 
the prefent inhabitants there is but a fmall proportion Se- 
ceders. The people in general are quiet, and no difturbers 
of the public peace. They are moftly employed in agri- 
culture and pafturage. The ihepherds, inftead of wages, are 
allowed to pafture a certain number of flieep, along with 
their mafters flock. They live comfortably in their way, 
and not unfrequently make a little money, with which they 
are fupported in the decline of life, by employing it either 
in buying oats, which, when made into meal, they fell, or 
by ufing it in feme other kind of fmall traffick. The wa- 
ges of a hind or cottager may amount to (all his advanta- 
ges confidered) from L. 10 to L. 16. His wife in harveft 
works for the cottage they live in ; and all his family capa- 
ble of work, are obliged to labour, on being paid, for the 
farmer, when he needs them. The wages of a mari-fer- 
vant, who eats in his mailer's houfe, is from L. 5 to L 7 
in the year; of a day-labourer, from is. to is. ^^.per 
day ; of women, that work at hay or turnip, 6 d. per da} ; 
of tradefmen, from i s. 6 d. to 2 s. per day. Women ferl 
Vantsget from L. i, 5 s. to L. a in the half year; they

Statiftical Account 



have more wages in fummer than in winter, from the de- 
mand for ewe-milkers, and there being more employment- 
for them in the field at that feafon. 

Landed Property and Farmin^.--The property of this 
parifh is chieflj vefted in Dundas of Arnifton and Hepburn 
of Clerkington, the valued rent of the two remaining heri- 
tors amounting only to L. 439 : 5 : 5 Scots. The valued 
rent of the whole parifli is L. 4399, 10 s. Scots. 

A good deal has been done towards inclbfing the ground,, 
and in improving the country by plantations of trees. The 
proprietors have alfo been at confiderable pains and ex- 
pence to fecond the natural tendency of the foil to paftii- 
rage, and have, with this view, laid out much of their befl 
land in grafs-fields, cultivated in a fuperior ftyle, and which 
now make great returns. But till of late, the farmers 
have fhown no fpirit for improvement. Six years ago, 
none of them but one raifed turnip, and ten years ago none 
of them but one raifed clover and rye-grafs. Since thefe 
periods, however, confiderable progrefs has been made, as 
will appear by the fubjoined lift of cattle fed upon turnip. 
Much of the land is well adapted to the culture of turnips 
and potatoes, and for raifing crops of hay, and thefe modes 
of cultivation will probably become more extenfive and 
perfeft, when the roads through the parifli fliall be made 
good and eafy fop conveying the produce of the foil to 
market. The other crops raifed are barley and bear, oats 
and peafe. The barley is raifed in the lower part of the 
parifti, and fold' to brewers and diftillers at the fiars of the 
county. The bear is raifed in the higher part, and fold to 
the fame perfons at the 2d or 3d fiars. The oats fowa 
here are the common oats of the country, known by the 
name of Blanllie oats, and red oats, that anfwer well in our

coM climate upon ftrong land only *. A few Cairnwath oats 
are alfo fovvn here, they are about lo days earlier than the 
common oats, and produce a greater quantity both of oats 
and ftraw upon bad land than either of the other kinds^ 
but arc long in the body, and hufky. When fown upon good 
land, they produce an excellent crop of good' grain. The 
oats are either fold in the Dalkeith market, the beft grain 
market in Scotland, or made into meal for the ufe of the- 
farmer's family. The peafe fown are either the late feed, 
the Peebles and MagbiehiU, or Montgomery peafe. The 
lafl of thefe is the earlieft. The country is indebted for 
th^m to the late Mr Montgomery of MagbiehiU \. they 
are chiefly made into meal^ and ufed in the fame way. 
The horfes are improved in fize and ftrength ; the cattle 
are larger and better formed thaa formerly ; a cow feeds 
to from 24 to 34 ftones, an ox to from 30 to 46. The 
breed of fheep is the fame which has long prevailed in the 
fouthern diftrifts of Scotland, mvz,. the black-faced and grey- 
faced coarfe-wooUed Iheep; They are much better boned, 
from fewer being kept upon the fame ground than former- 
ly, and weigh, when fed, from 10 lb. to 16 tb. a -quarter. 
As many flieep are reared in the parifh, they are difpofed 
of in the following manner : Some are fold when lambs 
to the butcher ; others when hogs, or of one year old \ 
others as fat ewes ; other ewes, when lean, at Martinmas, 
for feeding or keeping ; and a few are fold youngs wedders,, 
or three years old.

■ known by the name of barley corn. They were brought from Linton, 
J»ceblesfhire, by Mr Dawfoii, farmer at Frogden, Roxburghfliire, and 
meliorated, by being fown upon his well-cultivated land. They wer« 
.-^irroduced lately into this rountry under the title of red oats. ..

for marriage, and from the intereft and capital of a fum of 
L. 126 that had been collected when the heritors were re- 
fident in the parifli. That fum is faft diminiihing, there 
being now no refident heritors, but the fmalleft, who is a 
Seceder. Subjoined is a lift of the receipts and difburfe- 
fnertts in the years 1753 and 1793 :

The difference between the receipts and difburfements in 
1793 was made up by money taken from the capital in the 
preceding year. There have been no begging poor in the 
parifh for upwards of 20 years. 

Kcclsjiajlical EJleihiyJ:}me7it. — The ecclefiaftical eftablifli- 
ment of this parifli confifted originally of three chapels, one 
at Temple, one at Clerkington, and one at Morphet. The 

patronage 



of Temple, 



503 



patronage of the firft belonged to lands the property of 
Dundas of Arnifton, and that of the other two to lands the 
property of Hepburn of Clerkington. ■ From the union of 
thefe chapels arofe, at an early period, the prefent pariflx 
of Temple ; and the right of prefentation to it has followed 
that of the original eftablifhment, Mr Dundas having one 
'oice of it, and Mr Hepburn two. The ftipend is paid 
partly in money and partly in grain, and amounts to L. 82, 
16 s. 8 d. at the legal rate of converting grain by the Court 
of Teinds. The glebe is fmall, and the value of it to the 
minifter is ftill farther diminifhed, by the arable part of it 
being at a diftance from the manfe, and uninclofed. The 
manfe is an old houfe, and has lately undergone a partial 
repair. The church is an old Gothic building, is ill feated, 
and very cold in winter, from having bad doors, and no 
cieling. 

Manufaaures.--T\itxQ has as yet been no manufaaure 
carried on in the parifh ; but lately a company from Eng- 
land have begun to build a mUl for making gun-powder. 
This is the firft eredion of the kind in Scotland.

Situation, f^c» 

MANY places, on both fides the borders of Scotland 
and England, received their prefent names from war- 
like exploits that took place during the unhappy conteft, re- 
fpefting the independence of Scotland, in which the two 
nations were fo long engaged. It is probable, that the 
name Morhattle was given to this parilh at that period, al- 
though the particular circumftaace that gave rife to it is 
now, perhaps, unknown. The pari][h is bounded on the 
N. by Linton ; on the E. by Yetholm ; on the S. by PIou- 
nam ; and on the W. by Eckford. 

Rivers. — The principal rivers or waters in the parifti are

are to be found. The f aim on in thefe, and all the other 
waters in this didridl of the county, are not now nearly fo 
plenty as formerly ; owing, it is believed, to the cruives, 
and other machineries placed in the Tweed, a little above 
Berwick, by which the fiih, in their paflage up the river, 
are intercepted and killed. 

Villagt. — The only village in the ;parifh is Morbattle. 
The ground upon which it is built was, not very many 
years ago, feued out by the Marquis of Tweeddale, for the 
terms of nineteen times nineteen years, at the rate of L. 5 
per acre Englifh. The houfes, which are moftly of one 
ftory high, and covered with thatch, xire built an4 kept in 
repair by the feuers. About 380 acres, adjoining to the 
village, were, till of late, occupied in two farms, for which 
was paid L. 64 of rent annually. Thefe farms, at the ex- 
piration of the leafes, were parcelled out into fmall por- 
tions, as might belt fuit the conveniency of the feuers in the 
village. They are now fubdivided int« about 26 fmall 
pendicles or paffles, for which is paid of yearly rent L. 230. 
The greatefl fubdivifion pays only L. 22, ios. Sterling. 
The rife of the rent of this land, which was almoft altoge- 
ther outfield and hilly, is, perhaps, more than that of any 
other part of the parifh. The ground, inftead of being 
rendered worfe by the fmall occupiers, is much improved. 
It receives a confiderable quantity of manure, and care is 
taken to cultivate every inch of it, in the beft manner pof- 
fible. Being thus improved, it is extremely ferviceable in 
helping to fupport many induitrious families. This village, 
xvhen-the accumulation of fmall into larg^ farms took place 
in the neighbourhood, feafon ably afforded a comfortable a- 
fylum to feveral farmers and cottagers, who were forced 
to abandon the abodes of their forefathers. The inhabi

duftrious. Some of them find employment in working 
their horfes and carts, in agricultural operations ; frequently 
in carrying lime and coals to the farmers in the vicinity ; 
and alfo in cultivating the fmall pieces of land they have in 
leafe, without which they could not fupport their horfes 
and cows. Some of the villagers are day-labourers, whilft 
pthers are occupied at their feveral trades and handicrafts, in 
the cuftomary work of the country. The leifure hours of thefe 
tradefmen are laudably filled up in managing their fmaH 
pafBes, and kail-yards, in which exercifes they find a more 
profitable and healthful amufement, than they could poflibly 
do in frequenting alehoufes or barbarous diverfions, a prac- 
tice which too hiuch prevails with many mechanics in fome 
of the great manufa£luring diflrifts of Britain. The wo- 
men are employed chiefly in fpinning linen -yarn, and ma- 
naging their fmall dairies, principally in making butter 
and cheefe, fome little of which is ufually carried to mar- 
ket. 

The inhabitants, by thefe means, are happily removed 
from the direful flate of abfolute fervitude, and from total- 
ly depending on the caprice of others. They have a fpur 
to aftivity and induflry, from a view of rendering better 
their cii cumftances in life. This excitement, which is one of 
the llrongeft principles of human adlion and felicity, would 
be ftill ftronger, had they an opportunity of getting in leafe 
more land added to what they already poffefs, in proportion 
as they were able to ftock and manage it, or were fmall 
farms to be got in the neighbourhood. Miferable, indeed, 
muft that clafs of men be, who are deprived of thefe, or fi- 
milar excitements to aftion. The ftate and manners of 
fociety Ihould every where be fo formed, that people in the 
loweft ftations of life may have a foundation on which to 
build their hopes of advancing their circumftances by fru- 
trallty and indullry. Such a view of their condition has a 
" great

^feat tendency to call forth every adlive power of the hu- 
man nature to make them combat, with firmnefs, every 
oppofition that may occur, and, with refolution to over- 
come the difficulties that lie in the way. Animated with 
luch a profpedt, they will early acquire habits. of induftry : 
A manly fpirit will ftimulate the whole of their condadi:, 
and naturally lead them to abhor every unworthy puriuit : 
Succefs, in a greater or lefs degree, will crown their lau- 
dable endeavours. A condu6l and a refult quite the re- 
verfe muft infallibly charafteriTse thofe unhappy creatures, 
whofe lot in fociety precludes them the hopes of ever rai- 
fing their condition above that of mean fervitude. The 
depreffion of all that is manly in the foul ; a rooted envy 
at the profperity of others, which they can never attain j a 
chilling profpe£l of nothing but infignificancy, obfcurity 
and poverty to themfelves and their offspring ; and a long 
train of other evils, are the natural confequentes of fuch a 
forlorn fituation. Perfons thus depreffed are unavoidably 
capable, and frequently willing to engage in the moft ini- 
quitous, bafe, and cruel deligns. To prevent any clafs of 
men from falling into fo deplorable a condition, every pre- 
caution fliould be taken by the community. This ought 
efpecially to be done with refpeft to the department of 
agriculture. Encouragement fhould be given to the mean- 
eft fervant of rifing in the line of his bufmefs till he become 
a matter. And are there not many knowing .and wealthy 
farmers in Britain, who can remember the time when they 
were employed in the loweft fervice of hufbandry ? This 
encouragement is indeed held out to mechanics, and to 
thofe engaged in moft other purfuits of life j but this can 
hardly be faid to be, at prefent, the cafe with refpeft to 
farming, in thofe diftrifts, where large farms are univer- 
fally adopted. It is not in the natuie of things, efpeciaJly 
now when the neceflaries of life have rifen to fo high a

price, that a common fervant can, hj his whole income of 
about L. 15 a-year, maintain his family, and at the fame 
time acquire as much money as is requifite to ftock a large 
farm. He and his offspring, if they do not change their 
profeffion, muft remain for ever in a ftate of fervitude, 
poor, helplefs, and defpifed. It is happily otherwife in thofe 
places, where there is a proper mixture of great and fmall 
farms. It frequently happens that a fervant, by a few 
years induftry and economy, with- a little affiftance from a 
friend, accumulates a fum that enables him to commence 
farmer on a fmall fcale. In this new, but more advanced 
fituation, he exerts himfelf by every lawful means in his 
power ; he is fpurred on by a laudable emulation ; and, at 
the expiration of his leafe, is generally able to quit the 
fmall and enter on- a larger farm. Taught by this gradual 
progrefs through the various- ftages of his profeffion, he di- 
refts with Ikill, he rules with moderation, and he manages 
with economy. Were the inhabitants, in. fome places ef 
the ifland, favoured with fuch opportunities- of rifing in the 
line of their bulinefs, it is highly probable that the landed 
intereft would find their profit in diminifhing the extent of 
fome of their farms. That it was not alone the accumula* 
tion of fmall into great farms that bettered the condition of 
fome diflrii^ls, but in a great meafure the happy chang« 
that took, place in the mode of hufbandry and" farming, is 
a conje6lure that may fafely be ventured.. The time is* 
perhaps, at' no- great diftanoe, when- proprietors of eftates 
will find it as- much their intereft to diminilh, at leaft, fome 
of their farms, as they formerly imagined they did by en» 
larging them* 

Heritors. — The landed property of Morbattle is fobr 
divided araongft twelve heritors; but his Grace the Duk«. 



of Morhattle. 



of Roxburgh has by far the largeft portion. None of the 
heritors but one refide on their property in this place. 

Population. — As the increafe of the villiage is fuppofed' 
to be equal to the depopulation of the country part of the 
parifli, when fmall farms were ajinihilated, the prefenfe 
number of inhabitants is fuppofed to be nearly the fame as 
in the return made to Dr Webfter ia 1755^ which was 
then 789. 

Agriculture. — Little more than one fourth part of the 
parifli is at prefent under culture. It is certain, however^ 
from the traces of the plough which yet remain on the 
higher grounds, that much- more of this and the adjacent 
country was. anciently under tillage than at prefent. It is 
generally believed, that, during the long and cruel conteft 
between the two kingdoms, a great portion of the lands on 
the borders were kept under white crops, as it was not fo 
eafy for the plundering parties, in thefe unhappy times, ta 
carry off crops, of grain, as it was, had the land been ia 
pafture, to drive away the cattle. The drill turnip huf- 
bandry is carried on here with great fpirit, and is confider- 
ed as one of the chief improvements of agriculture in this 
country. Large fields of turnips are purchafed by the gra- 
ziers for feeding off with Iheep. The very fmall quantity 
of lint that is produced in the parilli is moftly dreffed or 
fcutched by the hand at the owner's houfes. 

MannfaBures.'-A.xiii^m and tradefmen are far from 
being numerous ia the parifli, there being no more than are 
necefl'ary to fupply the inhabitants in cuftomary work, ia 
which are employed 4 weavers, 6 Wrights and joiners, 
a fmiths, 3 mafons, 5 tailors, i flioemaker. Tailors con!

and receive 8 d. a-day, and their viftuals. Wrights have 

1 s. a-day and viftuals, or i s. 6 d. without them. A fmall 
quantity of linen-yarn is fpun, fome of it on the double- 
lianded wheel. This inftrument was introduced from Fife- 
fliire into' this parifti and neighbourhood, about 15 years 
ago, by Mrs Morrifon, wife of the Reverend David Morri- 
fon'j minifter in the Seceding meeting-houfe at Morbattle. 
But little more yarn is fpun than what is neceffary for pri- 
vate ufe. The women in this part of the country being 
accuftomed to work much in the agricultural operations of 
the field, are little difpofed for fedentary employments, and 
therefore, in general, fit down to the fpinning wheel with 
great reludlance. From the prefent difpofition and habits, 
both of males and females in this place, the introdudlion of 
liianufadlures among them would not, it is probable, meet 
with great fuccefs. 

Church. — The prefent church was built in 1757, and 
is a commodious place of worftiip. The ftipend, including 
the manfe and glebe, is worth about L. i6o. The Duke 
of Roxburgh is patron. The Reverend James Richardfoa 
fills at prefent the charge. A meeting houfe, adhering to 
tlie Antiburgher Seceders, was, a confiderable number of 
years ago, erefted in the village of Morbattle j where a 
clergyman of that perfuation regularly officiates, to a pret- 
ty numerous congregation collefted from all the neigh- 
bourhood. 

5'r/&amp;oo/.— The falary annexed to the parochial fchool is 
100 merks Scots, with a free houfe and kail-yard. Thd 
fchool-wages are I s. 6 d, for teaching the Englilh language ; 

2 s. for writing, and as. 6 d. for arithmetic and Latm. 
The number of fcholars is, at an average, about 25. His 
tjerquifites for the fefifion-clerkfhip are 4 d. for every bap-

tifm that he enrols in the, parochial records, and 2 s. 6 d. 
for every proclamation of marriage, with a trifle for wri- 
ting teftimonials, or certificates for charafter. His income, 
receives an addition of L. 3 or L. 4 a-year, for collefting 
the poor-rates in the parifli. But this and the feffion-clerk- 
jttiip do not belong to him as fchoolmafter they are given 
him at the option of the heritors, minifter, andfeflion. The 
whole income, however, is too fmall for enabling a teacher 
of youth to live in a manner fuitable to the ftation of fo 
public a charader. The feflion-records of this pariih com- 
mence in 1697. No regifter of burials is kept. 

Poor. — About 16 indigent perfons are commonly on the 
feffion-roll. Their principal fource of fupport is L. 1600, 
3 s. 8 d. Sterling, that was, a good many years ago, be- 
queathed to this pariih by Mr John More, a native of 
Morbattle, who made his fortune in the Eaft Indies, where 
he died. The money was left to the management of the 
heritors and kirk-feflion of Morbattle, and bequeathed prin- 
cipally for the fupport of orphans and infirm old people. 
It is lent out for interell on landed fecurity. Partly owing 
to this fund, the number of poor is probably greater thaa 
otherwife it would be, as people from the neighbouring 
parilhes refort here, from a motive of being fupported in 
old age, A fmall affeffment on the parifli is fometimes 
found to be neceflary. The colledions at the kirk, amount- 
ing to a very fmall funi, is commonly diftributed by the 
feffion to occafional poor. 

Difeafes. — This part of the country is not remarkable for 
any uncommon or peculiar difeafe. The inhabitants are 
generally healthy and ftrong, and many of them live to a 
good old age. The fmall-pox makes fometimes great ha- 
vock among the children ; and inoculation, the beft remedy 
3 yet 



Statijlical Account 



yet known for that loathfome difeafe, is not mucli prac 
tifed. 

Antiquities. -^Th^ remains of fevcral encampments, and 
rows of ftones, called tryjl-jlanes, are antiquities, probably 
of the moft ancient date in the pariOi. The tryft.ftanes are 
commonly on high ground. They are placed perpendicu- 
larly in rows, not unfrequently in a circular direftion. It 
jsfaid, as alfo the name imports, that, in times of hoftilities, 
they marked tlie places of refort for the borderers, when 
they were affembling for any expedition of importance. 
The ruins of Whitton-caftle and Corbet-houfe are the only 
remains of large buildings or places of ftrength in the pa- 
ri/h. 

Mijcellaneous Olfervatiom. — The roads in the parifh, of 
which none are turnpike, are very far fronri being good, 
and are often almoft impalTable. Two public houfes (fmall 
ones) in the village ferve the inhabitants and paflengers 
with refrefhment. Formerly there were four mills in the 
parifh ; now two are found to be fufficient to grind all the 
■corn that is -needed by the inhabitants. About 20 acres 
may contain all the growing wood in the parifh, and thefe 
were but lately planted. The chief dependence for fuel is 
on coal brought from the Englifh border, and which fells 
at a high price. There are a few peat-mofTes in the parifli, 
but the people, in general, are fo much occupied in the field, 
Iuring fummer, that the calling and preparing of peats arc 
grpatly negleifled.

Natne, Extent, and Surface. 

nPHE name of the parifh is faid to be Gaelic, and figni- 
fies a Cave/'m allufion to the number of natural 
caves on the fea-fliore, near the village of Eafter Wemyfs. 
Hence, too, aU that trad of ground between the lower part 
of the water of Ore and the fea, was, in old times, called 
Wemyfsfliire. The parifli is diftant from the Preibytery- 
feat about three miles, its greateft length, which is from 
S. W. to N. E. will not exceed 6 miles, nor its greateft 
breadth 1- It is bounded by the panlh of Dyfart on the 
W. ; by Markinch on the N. and E. ; the water of Leven 
feparate. it from a fmall part of the pariib of Scoonie on 
the N. E. ; and the frith of Forth waihes it on the S I},€ 
ground, which is in iome places high along the ll.orc, af-

terwards rifes gently to the N. The fhore, from high 
water mark outward, is lined with 'rocks, which are not 
high, being moftly covered at high water. 

Climate and Difeafes. — Like all the S. and E. ftiore of 
Fife, being much expofed to the E. winds in the fpring 
months, it is unfavourable to pulmonic complaints, but in 
other refpedts, the climate cannot be faid to be unhealthy. 
Some of the fifhermen are afilifted with calculous con- 
cretions : and the reafon which they generally affign for 
this, is their being fo much expofed to cold with wet feet. 
Many children die of the fmall-pox in the natural way. la 
the village of Buckhaven upwards of 30 were lately cut 
oiT. It is to be hoped, however, that the prejudice againft 
inoculation will not in future be fo general as it has been. 
Many perfons live to upwards of 80 ; and within thefe 
two years, 3 perfons have died above 90. 

Villages. — Wefler Wemyfs is a burgh of barony, with 
a bailies, a treafurer, and council. There are other 3 vil- 
lages on the coaft, vi% Eafter Wemyfs, Buckhaven, and 
Methil. There are a villages in the country called E. 
and W. Coaltowns. 

Soil and Agricultwre, — The foil varies both in the coun- 
try and on the coaft. In fome places it is fine black loam j 
in others light and brown, fometimes approaching to fand ; 
and a fmall part, particularly in the N. W. corner, is cold 
and wet. It is all arable, and, with a few acres:excepted, pro- 
duces good crops of wheat, bear, beans, peafe, oats, potatoes, 
and turnip. The farmers are, in general, adive and in- 
duftrious,' and attentive to every improvement in agricul- 
ture. In farms near the villages, land is let to trades 
people for planting potatoes, who muft all afford manure, 
' hand- 



of Wemyfs.

band-hoe their potatoes, and pay at the rate of L. 3 the 
acre. By this means the farmer procures a quantity of 
good manure, has his ground well cleaned, and an excel- 
lent crop of wheat or bear the following year. The plough 
ufed is Small's, which is drawn by two horfes, and held 
and managed by one mani There are no fheep, but a few 
kept by Colonel Wemyfs for family-ufe, and they are of 
a very fine kind. There are 16 farms, which are rented 
from L. 25 to upwards of L.400 a-year. 

A confiderable quantity of land near the coaft is rented 
by land-labourers, who refide in the villages, and though, 
with many of them, farming is only a fecondary objed, 
yet the land in general is well laboured, and produces good 
crops. Almolt all fow fome turnip for their cows in win-' 
ter, and feed their horfes with potatoes, which are generally 
boiled and mixed up with light corn. The fea-weed, or 
ware, which is driven in by the fca all along the fliore, 
makes excellent manure when fpread immediately after it 
is carried to the land. This land, which is ufually called 
the Acre-land, lets from L. i, 10 s. to L. 2, 15 s. the acre. 

Plantations. —There is but little old wood, excepting 
fome at the caftle of Wemyfs. The late proprietor, the 
Hon. James Wemyfs, Efq; inclofed a great part of the pa- 
riHi ; fome of it with ftone and lime, and other parts with 
ditches and hedge, and planted many thoufands of trees ; 
and his fon, the prefent proprietor, is going on with the 
fame plan. He has inclofed much, and for thefe 6 years 
paft has planted, of various kinds, upwards of 200,000 trees 
every year, in different places. All the plantations are in 
a very thriving way, and in a few .years will both warm 
and greatly beautify the grounds.

Fijhing and Buckhaven. — From the fcarclty of haddocks 
for fome years, feveral of the filhermen have entered into 
the navy, or on board merchant-fhips, and others have be- 
come day labourers in country work. Formerly there 
were in Eafter Wemyfs 5 boats, with 5 men each, and 
one in Wefter Wemyfs, with j men, and now there is only 
one boat in Eafter Wemyfs, and the crew confift of old 
men. In Buckhaven, the fifliing is ftill continued with 
little alteration in the number of filhermen ; and though 
fiih are much fcarcer than formerly, yet the fiftiermen are 
in fome meafure compenfated by the high price, and cer- 
tain market for thofe they catch. The filh ufually caught 
are haddock, cod, turbot, Ikate,' whitings, foles, flounders, 
makarel and herring. A confiderable quantity of lobfters 
and crabs, or partons, (and fometimes a few cray or craw- 
fifli) are taken, with trap-creels let down into the fea upon 
the rocks near the Ihore. A. worthy fiflierman affured me, 
that he has known, about 40 years ago, 2,5,000 haddocks 
caught by the fifliermen of Buckhaven in one day, which 
were fold from 6 d. to 10 d. the 100; now more is fome- 
times given for a finglc haddock. At prefent, moft of the 
fifti caught here are fent to the Edinburgh market, and the 
reft are fold in this neighbourhood by women, who carry 
them in creels on their backs. When fifliing was plenty, 
few of the fifli caught in this parifli were fent to Edinburgh, 
becaufe then the fiftiermen in the Eaft of Fife carried their 
fifh to that market, and thofe being taken in deeper water, 
and confequently larger, were always preferred. At that 
time moft of the fifli caught here were fold in the neigh- 
bouring burghs, or bought up by men who carried them 
in creels on horfes to a confiderable diftance, where they 
found a good market. This laft gave employment to many 
in the parifti ; and a few years ago, fome of them had got 
neat carts fitted up for the purpofe ; but of late, they have 

been 



of Wemyfs. 517 



been obliged, in a great meafure, to give this up, both from 
the fcareity and high price of fifli. Twelve boats, with 
6 men in each, ufed in the month of Auguft, to go from 
this parilh to the herring-fiftiing off Dunbar ; but the en- 
couragement for fome years paft was fo fmall, that they 
had entirely abandoned it. There is now, however, a 
profpeft of this fifliing being revived by the appearance of 
herring in the Bay of Inverkeithing ; if there is encourage- 
ment, the fiftiermen here will not fail to improve it. 

The fifliermen in Buckhaven generally marry when 
young, and all of them marry filhermens daughters of the 
fame village. I am particularly indebted to a very inge- 
nious and intelligent General for a letter written by my 
late amiable and worthy predeceffor, the Rev. Dr Harry 
Spens *, when minifter of this parifh, (dated Wemyfs, 20th 
Auguft 1778), from which the following particulars re- 
fpedting the original inhabitants gf Buckhaven, l^c. are 
tranfcribed : 

" As far as I have been able to learn, the original inha- 
" bitants of Buckhaven were from the Netherlands about 
" the time of Philip II. Their veflel had been ftranded 
" on the £bore. They propofed to fettle and remain. The 
" family of Wemyfs gave them permifBon. They ac- 
" cordingly fettled at Buckhaven. % degrees they ac- 
*' quired our language and adopted our drefs, and for thefe 
" threefcore years paft, they have had the charafter of a 

fober and fenfible, an induftrious andhoneftfet of people. 
" The only Angularity in their ancient cuftoms that I re- 
" member to have heard of was, that of a richly orna- 
" mented girdle or belt, wore by their brides of good con- 
" dition and charatler at their marriage, and then laid afide

" and given in like manner to the next bride that Ihouid 
" be deemed worthy of fuch an honour. The village con- 
" fifts at prefent of about 140 families, 60 of which are 
" fiihers, the reft land-labonrers, weavers, and other me- 
" chanics." 

Minerals and Fojfih. — There is a great quantity of free- 
ftone, but in general of a reddifti colour, open and porous, 
and apt to crumble when much expofed to the weather. 
There is limeftone, but it is faid not to be of a good quali- 
ty ; perhaps it would have been more valued had lime been 
in lefs abundance in the neighbourhood. Ironftone has 
lately begun to be wrought ; but what deferves here parti- 
cularly to be noticed is the excellent coal with which this 
parilh abounds, and which has been wrought for fome cen- 
turies. Tn the weft ground of the parilh, befides what is 
called Dyfart coal, (which is 21 feet thick, with 3 feet of 
coarfe coal left for a roof) of which a very excenlive field 
remains to be wrought in the eftate of Wemyfs, there are 
other 10 or II workable feams of coal, moft of which have 
been wrought above the level of the fea. The principal 
feam of the lo or 11 is now working between 50 or 60 
fathoms below the furface. This feam is 10 feet thick, 
but 8 feet of it is only wrought, 'oi'z. 5 feet of very fine 
fplint, and 3 feet of free, the other 2 feet being left for a 
roof. The water is raifed by a fteam-engine. The coal 
is brought to the pit-bottom by horfes under ground, and 
then raifed by horfe-gins. Coal for exportation is driven 
in large waggons from the pits to the harbour of Wefter 
Wemyfs. The other fcams in this part of the parifii, which 
have been wrought, arc all entire below the level of the 
fea, excepting one, a fmall part of which was wrought near 
the fea, about the year 1 656, at which time the water was 
drawn off by horfes.

In the eaft ground of the parilli there are feveral work- 
able feams of coal. The Right Hon. David Earl of 
Wemyfs, (a nobleman of a great and public fpirit), who 
kept a particular account of the coal, written with his own. 
hand, mentions feven feams of coal which he had cut 
through in making a level mine from the fea-fhore, which 
he drove upwards of 600 fathoms acrofs the metals. In 
working this level in 1671, he obferves, " 1 am ftill work- 
" ing that level in ftone, with two men in it daj and night 
^' (except Sundays). I give them 10 s. Scots a-day, their 
^' bearers 4 s. Scots a-day, the windles men get 6 s. Scots 
a day or night. I lharp their picks and furnifli their 
candles." The only feams that have been wrought in 
this part of the parilli for a confiderable time were, one 8 
feet thick, and 20 fathoms from the furface, and another 
much about the fame thicknefs, and 7 fathoms deeper. The 
main coal is 12 feet thick, of an excellent quality, and was 
always preferred at the foreign markets. It was formerly- 
wrought to a confiderable depth by two engines, at Kirk- 
land of Methil, which were driven by the water of Leven. 
To the S. of Kirkland this coal is cut off by a hitch or 
dike, which throws it down 30 fathoms. This has lately 
been cut out under the care of a very ingenious and aftive 
eugineer, and the coal is now working level free. A wag- 
gon-way of 2 miles from the pits to the harbour of Methil 
is now completed, and every thing promifes an extenfive 
trade \ and indeed, from this feam of coal, with others ly- 
ing contiguous, it would not be at all furprifing to fee, in a 
few years, Methil rank among the firft coal-ports in Scot- 
land *.

much fait IS made at them, both for land-fale and exporta- 
tion. ^ 

ManufaBures, Commerce, Ijf^-.— Almoft every fubflantial 
family ufed annually to make a few pieces of good linen, 
from yarn of their own fpinning, which was wrought by 
weavers in the pariHi, and generally bleached by the pro- 
prietors themfelves, and then fold in the' public markets 
held in this and the neighbouring pariOies for the purpofe. 
In this way the weavers had been employed time imme- 
morial till about the year 1750, that fome in Eafter 
Wemyfs began to manufadhire linen themfelves, and ever 
fince this bufmefs has been extended and improved. The 
linen now made is generally well known for its quality 
and finenefs. Moft of it is made from Scotch flax, the 
greateft part of which is fpun in the parifli. It is thought 
by manufadlurers to be fuperior to any in the country ; 
and in confirmation of this, it may here be obferved, that 
the premiums given by the truftees for linen and flieeting 
were adjudged for 5 years fucceffively to manufadm-ers in 
this pariili ; to one in the years 1785 and 1786, and to an- 
other in the 1787, 1788, and 1789. Since the latter pe- 
riod, the number of looms has increafed, and the manu- 
faftory varied ; part of the looms being now employed in

At Kirkland, in the N. E. extremitj of the parifh, oa 
the.river Leven, near the ports of Methil and Inverleven, 
a large fpinnlng work, has been carried on for fome time, 
by fome gentlemen of London and Dundee, under the firm 
of Aiflabie, Nielfon, and Company. They fpin a conli- 
derSble quantity of cotton and linen yarn, particularly of 
the latter, which they have begun to manufacture into 
cloth. Their yarns are approved of, and they are oelieved 
to be going on very fuccefsfully. The fituation of this 
eftablifhment is a very advantageous one, and it is capable 
of great extenfion, as well for bleaching and printing, as 
for fpinning the yarns and manufaduring the cloth. The 
company already employ about 300 people, and the bufi- 
nefs feems to be increafing. Previous to the eftablifhment 
of this work, there were at Kirkland only two or three 
houfes, but now a number of very neat and convenient 
houfes are built, and in a Ihort time it is probable that it 
will be a confiderable village. Kirkland is faid to have 
been the place firft propofed by the Carron Company for 
eftabiilhing their works. 

A little to the weft of Kirkland is a waulk or fulling- 
mill, and dye-houfe, where bufmefs has been long carried 
on, and is confiderably increafed of late years. There is 
only one corn-mill in the parifli, but there are others 
equally convenient on Colonel Wemyfs's property, lying 
in the parifli of Markinch. 

The maritime commerce has much inereafed of late. 
There are 10 fquare-rigged veffels and one floop belonging 
to this parifli, whofe regifter meafure may amount to up- 
wards of 1480 tons. They are moftly employed in the 
carrymg trade. They are generally loaded with coal out- 
wardly, and bring home wood, iron, fl-ax, from the 
Baltic to the different ports in the frith of Forth. Some

of them have been freighted to the Mediterranean, Weft 
Indies, and America ; and one is at prefent engaged bj 
Government in the tranfport fervice. 

At Wefter Wemyfs two Jhip-carpenters began to build 
fliips about feven years ago. The fituation is good, and 
they have found great encouragement. They employ 
about i8 apprentices, and feveral journeymen. Here fome 
of the beft veffels which have failed from the frith of Forth 
for the Weft Indies have been built, as well as fome for the 
Baltic trade. Other two (hip- carpenters have juft begun 
to build at Methil, a moft convenient fituation for the bu- 
linefs, and it is thought that they will meet with equal en-; 
courageraent with the former. 

A gentleman in Eafter Wemyfs, who carries on a confi- 
derable brewery, lately began to import wood from the 
Baltic, which has been of great advantage to the neighbour- 
hood ; and from the rapid and extenfive fale which he has 
met with, cannot fail to fecure benefit to himfelf. 

There are properly no merchants in the parifti, with the 
above exception. Some perfons fell a fmall quantity of 
neceflary articles ; but as there are opportunities every day 
of being provided xvith thefe at a cheaper rate from Kirk- 
caldy, they meet with no great encouragement. 

The fea-wced on the rocks upon the Ihore is cut every 
3 years, and yields about lOO tons of kelp. The time of 
cutting is in June and July. 

There are two good harbours in the parifli. One at 
Methil, which was built by the Right Hon. David Earl of 
Wemyfs about the year 1650, folely at his own expence. 
The other is at Wefter Wemyfs, but ^ when built is un- 
known. It was fome years ago greatly improved by a 
bafon for cleaning it. 



Exports 



ofWemyfs. 



Exports and Imports. — Coal and fait are the only exports* 
The quantity differs according to the demands. At an 
average there is Ihipped at Welter Wemyfs annually 6000 
tons of coal, moftly for Amfterdam, Hamburgh, and 
Middleburgh, being of a quality particularly fuited forlight- 
houfes. The light on the ifland of May, at the entrance 
of the frith of Forth, is fupplied from this coal *. 

About 40,000 bufliels of fait are annually flaipped from 
this pariih for the diflerent ports from Dundee to Inver- 
nels. 

The imports are moftly oak-timber for flaip-building, 
Memel and Norway timber, deals, lie. Gottenburgh iron^" 
deals and battons ; in all about 10 cargoes in the year. 

Bridges and Roads.— There are no bridges in the parilh, 
but a fraall one over a rivulet that pafTes through Eafter 
Wemyi^, nor is there any need for more. The turnpike- 
road from Kirkcaldy to Cupar by Kennoway, and to the 
eaft of Fife, paffes through the north part of the parifli ■ 
but from its diftance from the coaft, being near it mile'

Population has certainly increafed in fome of the villa- 
ges, particularly in Eafter Wemyfs and Methil ; but it has 
greatly decreafed in the country part of the parifh. In 
the feffion-records, there is mention of many places, of fome 
of which no veftige can now be traced ; and that which 
remains of others, is only a few afti-trees, which were ufu- 
ally planted round their gardens or kail-yards. This

Ecckjajlical State, Heritor, ^..^The church is an old 
Gothic building in the form of a crofs ; there are evident 
marks of confiderable additions to it, but no dates that can 
fix Its age. It was repaired and much improved in 1702 
and IS now a well-lighted, warm, and decent place of wor! 
fliip. The church and manfe are in the thriving village of 
Eafter Wemyfs, the moft centrical part of the parifti. The 
patronage belongs to the Town-council of Edinburgh. It 
belonged to the family of Wcmyfs till about the 1214, 
when Sir John de Wemjfs » gifted it to a religious houfc' 
at Sokraj in Mid-Lothian. The reafon he affigned for this 
donation is in thefe words, « pro anima mea, et anima 
" Comitis Duncani, et pro animabus patrjs et matris." 

Colonel William Wemjfs of Wemjfs, Efqj member of 
Parliament for the county of Fife, is fole heritor of the 
parifii, and his family refides in it at the caftle of Wemyl^ 
The ftipend, as fettled by the Court of Seffion February 
1794, is L. 50 of money, 64 bolls of meal, 32 bolls of bear, 
and L.j:n:ii for furnifhing communion-elements. 
The manfe was built in 1791, and, to the honour of the he- 
ritor, it is one of the beft in the country. Moft of the old 
offices were removed in the fame year, and a part of the 
old manfe was fitted up to fupply their place. The fite

this property is near the glebe, it is of great advantage for 
manure. For the kelp from the rocks the prefent incum- 
bent has received about L. 5, 5 s. every three years.

nour to the memory of Margaret, heirefs and Countefs of 
Wemjfs, and Countefs of Cromartie, his deceafed Lady, 
mortified a fmall fum of money for founding a ftipend or

iler of the parifli, for faid ufe, and the payment to be made 
on the firft day of January Old Style, being the birth-day 
of that illuftrious Countefs. The gift of prefentation is in 
the family of Wemyfs, and the prefentee to be tried and

in 1749; his falary is L. 250 : 3 : 4 Scotch money, and 
the intereft of L. 50 Sterling.

nan ftyles them, " Equltes Fifani illuftres." They went 
to Norway ; but unhappily for them and their country, 
the Princefs died at Orkney on her paflage to Scotland. 
As a monument of this honourable embaffy there is ftill 
preferved in the caftle of Wemyfs a large filver bafon, of 
an antique figure, which was given by the King of Norway 
to Sir Michael Wemyfs. 

Perhaps, under this article fhould alfo be mentioned a 
flpne, on the turnpike-road, about one-third of a mile after 
entering the parilh from the eaft ; it has ftopd time imme- 
morial ; is 4 feet in height above ground, and 3 feet dia,- 
meter, by fome called the Standing Stone, by others the 
Half-way Stone between Kirkcaldy and Kennoway. For 
what reafon it was placed there, the writer could never 
learn any thing fatisfadlory. 

The caftle of Wemyfs, fituated a little to the eaft of the 
burgh of Wefter Wemyfs, and clofe by the ftiore, on a 
clilF between 30 and 40 feet above the level of the fea, is a 
large and magnificent building. When it was built is un- 
certain, but part of the eaft wing is faid to be near, if not 
as old as the caftle of Eafter Wemyfs. It received confide- 
rable additions about the beginning of the 17th century, 
from the Right Honourable David Earl of Wemyfs, and 
his grandfon, being Lord High Admiral of Scotland, raifed 
a good wall, in the form of a fort, upon a beautiful bowling- 
green, and placed a few cannon to anf^er falutes from fhips 
as they pafled. The prefent proprietor laid out a piece of 
ground, fome years ago, in a garden, with high walls, an 
elegant green-houfe, hot-houfes, ^-c. ; and it is faid that 
there are few, if any gardens in Scotland, where there is fo 
much forcing as in this. It was in the caftle of Wemyfs 
tihat Lord Darnly h.ad his firft interview with Qi}een Mary, 
13th February 1565. The Queen was at this time on a 
^our of vifits in Fife, which, fays the famous John Knox,

cRufed wild fowl to be fo dear, that pai'tridges were fold 
at a crown a-piece. 

Perhaps in few parifhes has land been longer in the pof- 
feffion of one family than in this. Hugo, or Eugenius, 
fecond fon of Gillimachea], 4th Earl of Fife, and grandfon 
of Macduff, the firft Earl, got from his father the lands of 
Wemjfsfhire, l^c. ISc. and his defcendent is prefent pro- 
prietor of them. Gillimacheal was witnefs to the founda- 
tion-charter of the Abbey of Holyroodhoufe in the 1128^ 
The lands of Wefter Wemyls have been uninterruptedly 
pofleffed by the noble family of Wemyfs fmce the above 
period. The lands of Eafter Wemyls went off from the 
family, and were poffefTed by a family of the name of Li- 
vingfton, and then by the Colvills of Ochiltree ; but after 
200 years feparalion, they were again added to the eftate of 
Wemjfs, by the Right Honourable John Earl of Wemyfs, 
who was High Gommiffioner to the General Affembly of 
the Church of Scotland in the year 1641. 

Caves.-A.X. was obferved, that the parilh derives its name 
from the number of natural caves in it. There are feven 
a little to the eaft of Eafter Wemyfs, and all but one about 
ICO yards from high-water mark. Four of them were 
long ago fitted up for, and ftill are pigeon-houfes. There 
are two at the bottom of the cliff, and immediately under 
the ruins of the caftle of Eafter Wemyfs j one of them is 
called Jonathan's Cave, from a man who, with his family, 
r^fided fome time in it ; the entrance to the other is very 
narrow, but after having got through it, you find yourfelf 
in a very fpacipus place, in which is a well of excellent 
water ; it is annually vifited by the young people of Eafter 
Wemyfs* with lights, upon the firft Monday of January 
Old Style, but from what this cuftom took its rife the wri- 
ter could never learn. The feventh (the- neareft to the

ill ore) is called the Court Cave, and two reafons are affiga- 
ed for the name ; one is, that when the lands of Eafter 
Wemyfs were the property of the Colvills, they here held 
their baron-court •, another, that King James IV. in a fro- 
lick once joined a company of gypfies, who were here 
making merry, and when the liquor began to operate, the 
gypfies, as ufual with people -of their charafter, began to 
quarrel among themfelves ; upon this his Majefty attempted 
to mediate between the parties, but they, ignorant of the 
rank of their new aflbciate, were about to handle him 
pretty roughly for his goodnefs, which obliged the King to 
difcover himfelf ; in allufion to this affair, the cave was 
afterwards ironically called the Court Cave. There is an- 
other cave a little to the eaft of the caftle of Wemyfs, and 
much about the fame diftance from the fliore as the for- 
mer. This cave, which is about 200 feet in length, 100 
in breadth, and 30 in height, was fitted up about 60 years 
ago by a tackfman for a glafs-work ; but foon after the work 
commenced, the man became bankrupt, and the buildings 
were allowed to go ta ruins. 

Advantages and Difadvantages. — The parifli derives 
great advantage from the abundance of coal ; and when 
fifliing was plenty, living was much cheaper here than in 
moft places. One difadvantage which the commercial part 
labour under, is the want of a poft.office. Though Dyfart, 
which is the nearefl: poft-town, is not at a great diftance, 
yet as letters cannot be anfwered the fame day on which 
they are received, without fending them by exprefs to the 
office, much inconvenience is thereby occafioned, which 
could be eafily remedied at a very fmall expence, as the 
poft-boy paffes through Eafter Wemyfs on his way to 
Leven . 

CharaEld 



of Wemyfs. 



533 



CharaBer. — The people in general are fober and indu- 
ftrious, regular in their attendance upon public worfhip, 
and apparently contented with their fituations *. 



NUM- 



* At a period when the abolition of the flave-trade has become the 
fubjeft of I'arliamentary confideration, the following anecdote may not 
be difagreeable, as being perhaps the firft procefs of the kind that came 
before the Court of Seffion : — A gentleman from the Weft Indies, rc- 
fiding fome time at Methil, a negro fervant, whom he had brought with 
him, embraced at that time the Chriftian religion, and was baptized in 
the church of Wemyfs, September lo. 1769, by the name of David Spens. 
Soon after this his mafter refolved to fend him back to, and fell him as a. 
flaye in the Weft Indies ; but Spens getting information of it, imme- 
diately left his mafter, and went to the houfe of a farmer in the parifli. 
The mafter then raifed a procefs before the Court of Se{Eon againft Spens 
to return to his flavery, and againft the farmer for advifing him to defert, 
and alfo for proteifling him. To defend Spens from the oppreffion of his 
mafter, and to aflift him in aflerting, what they conceived, his juft rights 
and privileges as a Britifli fubjedl, the inhabitants of the parifli readily 
efpoufed his caufe, and raifed a confiderable fum of money. The caufe 
was enrolled January 1 770. Four lawyers were engaged; and on th« 
ad February, the caufe was ably pled on both fides. Memorials were 
appointed to be given in for both parties ; but foon after this the mafter 
died, and the caufe was dropt. To the honour of the lawyers engaged^ 
for the defendant, viz. MeflVs Crofbie, Al. Fergufon, Hay and Belfches, 
Advocates, and Mr Walter Fergufon, writer, agent, none of them 
would - accept of a fee.

Origin of the Name^ i^c. 

Is the pafe in mofl: etymological remarks, nothing 
certain can be faid as to the word Sleat. It is moft 
probably Danifh, and may poffibly allude to the peninfu- 
lar fituation of the place ; it is a fadt, that the names of 
many of the farms are in that language, fuch as Oftaig,

Situation, Extent, and Produce.— ^The parifii is ftretched 
N. E. and S. W. forming an extent of 17 EngliHi miles 
along the fea, having the mainland of Scotland oppofite to 
it on the eaft, -viz. the diflrifts of Glenelg, Knoydart, Mo- 
rar, and Arifaig, the breadth of the channel varying from 
a quarter of a mile to two leagues. Sleat is bounded on 
a the

the W. and N. by the parilh of Strath. The breadth o£ 
the parifti is from one mile to three and a half, being, like 
all parts of the iflatid of Sky, interfeded by different arms 
of the fea. 

The two extremities of the parifli confift of confiderable 
trafts of tolerable paflure-ground, well calculated for rear- 
ing black cattle, equal in quality to any the neighbourhood 
produces ; indeed, the whole weft fide of the parifli is made 
up of a pleafant mixture of arable and rough ground ; and 
there one may likewife find three confiderable ftools of na- 
tural wood, confifting of oak, aih, elm, birch, arn, rone- 
tree, hazle, willow, and other aquatics. 

Wood is peculiar to this part of the ifland of Sky, there 
being hardly a tree, natural or planted, excepting here; it 
may be fuperfluous to add, that this contributes much to 
the ornament, not to fay ufefuinefs of the different tenures 
on which this valuable commodity grows. 

The eaft fide of the parifli, particularly from the farm of 
Knock to Tormore, forming an extent of five miles in 
length, and from one to one and a half in breadth, is arable, 
the foil being deep clay, in fome places of a bluifti, in others 
ofarcddifli colour, exceedingly adapted to ditching and 
hedging; produces middling crops of oats and potatoes, 
though, in fpite of its fouthern expofure, the harvefts are in 
general late, owing to the ground being damp, and in fome 
places fpouty, added, as was formerly mentioned, to its 
clayey texture ; it cannot however remain a doubt, that 
by proper attention to inclofures and ditches, (fliould en- 
couragement offer), an induftrious farmer would here find 
a good fubjeft to fpeculate and praflife upon. The barony 
of Sleat is now fubdivided into 26 different farms or tene- 
ments, which at a moderate calculation, may fow about 20 
bolls each, in aU 520. There is hardly any barley, the 
fea-ware growing pn the ihore being almoft entirely laid

out in manuring potatoes. That ufeful root is much, and 
indeed neceffarily cultivated here, the inhabitants living 
great part of the year on potatoes, and various forts of fifb, 
chiefly herrings, flioals of which regularly and providen- 
tially make their appearance in almoft all the bays and 
lochs round the ifland, about the 20th of July, and gene- 
rally remain in kfs or greater bodies till the middle of De- 
cember. Nature, indeed, feems to have made fome pro- 
vifion for the fupport of the inhabitants of this land, as the 
filh cafts up nearly at the time that the meal is confumed. 
There may be planted in the parifli of Sleat about 300 
bolls of potatoes. Their meafure is a herring-barrel filled, 
of fuch they allow three to a boll ; what proportion this 
bears to the legal meafure in tlie Low Country, I know 
not, but there may be 900 barrels planted annually, but it 
is to be underilood, that this is almolt altogether done in 
the lazy-bed way. What attaches the inhabitants to this 
mode of planting potatoes is, that they conceive the ground 
requires lefs preparation than when planted in the drill. 
Of oats there are from 4 to 6 returns ; potatoes from lo to 
14 » there have been from 34 to 38 returns in the drill 
way, but this held nowhere but in fmall fpots, where the 
preparation of the ground was much attended to. There 
are only 1 3 ploughs in the parifti; the other implements 
of tillage are garden and crooked fpades. Lintfeed is fown 
here with fuccefs, though in fmall quantities, but enough 
to Ihow that the ground is well adapted to fuch purpofe. 

The fuel is entirely turf or peat ; it is unnecefTary o de^ 
fcribe the procefs of cutting and drying it ; but I am forry 
to obferve, that this article takes up a great proportion of 
the farmer's time, and that very often their labour is in 
vain, particularly when the latter end of fummer, and the 
begmning of autumn, happens to be rainy, which unfortu- 
nately is too often the cafe in the Weltern Highlands, and 

this 



of Skat.

Ihis circumflance muft make the hufbandman and grazier 
bid adieu to all regular calculation. 

At a moderate calculation, there may be 2600 head of 
black cattle in the parifli. It is impolBble to fay exactly 
what number is annually fold, as the fales muft depend upon 
a number of contingent circumftances. The breed of hor- 
fes is fma.ll, and entirely ufed for the different purpofes of 
agriculture, the number may be 250 or thereabout. As to 
flieep, the niimber in the pairifh is fo few, that it is hardly 
worth the calculating. Such as can afford to eat mutton are 
obliged to purchafe from the neighbouring Iheep-walks. 

Population. — In the year 1755, the number of fouls in 
the parifh was 1250; and now, notwithftanding emigra- 
tions, and repeated drains to the army^ the inhabitants a- 
mount to 1788. The proportion of males to females is as 
5 to 6 ; the number of deaths for years back is from 18 to 
28 ; marriages from 9 to 145 births at an average 40. 
There are now eight men in the ^arifti upwards of 80 ; of 
women above that age, five ; of that number, one is 98^ 
and another 95. 

Jnfiqiiities. -^Thtxe are two caftles in this parifti tole- 
rably confpicuous iji, Dunjkakh, built upon a rock, on 
the weft fide of Sleat », the communication betwixt this 
rock and the oppofite fide was kept up by a draw-bridge, 
but from the appearance of the mafon-work on that fide of 
the caftle, the arch feems to be modern ; the building ori 
the weft fide has every appearance of antiquity, part being 
circular, and covered from top to bottom with ivy. There 
has been a prlfon and draw-well 5 all this feems to infer, 
that the edifice was reared at different times, and perhaps 
in different ages ; he muft be an ill-informed reader that

well known works of Fingal. At the diftance of three 
miles on the eaftern fhore flands caftle /' Chamuis, i. e. the 
Caftle at the end of a Bay. This ftrufture is likewife 
partly ancient, partly modern, one fide being circular, and 
covered with ivy, the other being built in the common 
ftyle of mafonry. This caftle held out a fiege, if I remem- 
ber w^ll, in the reign of James IV. from the Macleods, 
who had obtained the Royal fandion for committing de- 
predations on the country. The fiege was raifed in a great 
meafure through the addrefs and intrepidity of a lady, 
ftyled, Mari Chai/lail, i. e. Mary of the Caftle, her refi- 
dence being probably in the caftle or neighbourhood pre- 
vious to the fiege ; it does not, however, appear, that this 
heroine fliarcd the fame fate with the Maid of Orleans. 
There are befides five duns, of which hardly any thing re- 
mains but the name; fuch as, Dun-Phaick in Kilmore, 
Dun-Flo in Tormore, Dun-Geilt in Carradle, Dun-Iflayin 
Oftaig, Dunan-Choinach ; the three firft are Danifti. At 
Dun-Flo there may be feen a number of human bones, a 
party of King William's troops having landed from a fliip 
of a Captain Porringer in the month of September 1688, 
after having burned the houfe of Sir Donald Macdonald, 
were by the natives forced to reimbafk after a Ikirmiih, 
in which the Royalifts were defeated with the lofs of %^ 
men. Dun-lflay feems to have taken its name from the 
following circuraftance ; a party of the inhabitants of that 
ifland, at a very remote period, landed in the neighbour- 
hood of this rock, where they fortified themfelves, and 
were at length cut oft' by the inhabitants. 



Church. — The parifti-clnirch was built in the year i68r, 
and has lately undergonre repairs j it is the largeft ftnidiu*e

of that fort in the ifland. There is no manfe or defigned 
glebe, the prefent incumbent being accommodated' with a 
farm and tolerable manlion-houfe. The ftipends amount 
to no more than the minimum, viz. 800 merks Scots, com- 
munion-elements, according to fome mens opinion, in- 
clufive. The King is Patron ; Lord Macdonald fole heri- 
tor. The real rent is L. 1300 Sterling, or thereabouts. 
All the inhabitants are Prefbyterians. 

School. — There is a parochial fchool, in which mofl 
branches of literature are at prefent taught by James Bcr 
verly, a native of Aberdeen, the number of fcholars at^ 
tending varies from 25 to 40. The falary and emolu- 
ments of the fchool may amount to L. 24 Sterling. There 
has been no Society-fchool fince the year 1778. 

Poor. — They are in number at this time 25, who are - 
fupported in fome meafure by the colledlion. They have 
been of late years much obliged to the donations of a gen- 
tleman, who is a native of this country, (a fon of the late 
incumbent of this parifli), Sir John Macpherfon, once Go- 
vernor-General of Bengal. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervatio7is. — There are no made roads 
in this parifti. There is an excellent and well-known har- 
bour, ip Ornafaj, a good deal frequented by fliipping, 
though they are generally Imall, owing to its local fitua- 
tion ; there is anchorage for veffels of almoft any fize ; I 
have often feen 100 fail riding at once in the bay, chiefly 
herring-buffes ; now and then, indeed, fliips from the Baltic 
touch here. Wages of men-fervants are from L. 2 to L. 3 
Sterl. each, befides ftioes; the wages of women from i2s. to 
L. I, and flioes. I conceive it unnecelTary to give any fort of

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1016944">PETERHEAD</name> 



(County and Synod of Aberdeen, District of 
BucHAN, and Presbytery of Deer), 



By the Rev. Br Moir, Minijier.</head>

<p>

Name. 

npHE prefent name of this parifK is Peterhead, formerly 
called Peter's-head, fuppofed to be derived from the 
promontory which lies between the town and the f$a, the 
TaiiaXov or Tat^a,ov ax^ov of Ptolemy, and to have the name 
of Peter, from being dedicated to a faint, or the Apoftle of 
that name ; though this is entirely conjefture. Some think 
the name has its derivation from the Greek word UsTpog, 
or the French word Pierre, each of thefe fignifying a rock, 
on which tjie town is founded ; others, that it takes its 
name from a Highland chieftain, called Peter, or Patrick, 
having loft his head on a plundering expedition to this 
parifli ; in fupport of this opinion, they fay Auchticgall, 
the name of a farm about two miles from the town,

that Cairngall, now in the parifh of Longfide, formerly 
part of this panih, was the place where they were encamp, 
ed. What truth is in either of thefe conjedlures, or if they 
deferve any credit, I leave to antiquarians to determine ; 
only obferving, the derivation from the Greek or French 
appears to have little foundation, as Peter was part of the 
name of this parifli before any part of the town was built ; 
befides, the town was formerly called Keith Inch, and re- 
tained that name till 1593, when it obtained a charter as a 
burgh of barony. 

Ancient Extent.— TTh^ moft ancient name of this parifh 
xvas Peter Ugie, which is to be found in many charters. It 
was formerly of much greater extent than at prefent, an4 
extended weftvvard on both fides of the Ugie (or its 
branches) in fome parts nearly "nine miles. In 1620, a 
great part of this pariQi was taken off, to form, with a part 
of Criraond, the pariih of Longfide, which for fome time 
was called Wejiern Ugie. 

Situation — -The pariHi is fituate in the county and Sy- 
nod of Aberdeen, difi:ri(fl:'of Buchan, and prefbytery of Jieer ; 
it is nearly 5 miles long from N. to S. and from 3 to 4 
from E. to W. ; bounded on tl^e S. by the pariih of Cru- 
den ; by Longfide on the W. j the water of Ugie, which 
feparates it from the parifh of St Fergus, on the N. ; and on 
the E. by the German Ocean. 

Surface. — The parifh is in general flat, with fome little 
eminences, which can fcarcc be called hills •, but from thefe 
little eminences, and the hollows formed betwixt them, 
the view is a little varied, and from the luxuriancy of the 
foil, were belts or clumps of trees interfperfed more fre- 
quently, of which there are very few, it would have a

pleafant appearance the S. and S. W. part being termi- 
nated by mofs and moor, has rather a bleak afpecl ; but 
the N. part has a variety of objedb to attrad attention and 
pleafe the eye ; the old caftles of Raven's Craig and iTiver- 
ugie, formerly feats of the Earl Marifchal ; the river Ugie, a 
fmall plantation of timber, fome elegant farm-honfes, the 
arches of the bridge of Inverugie, a windmill, a profpedl 
of the town, and fpire of the town-houfe of Peterhead, ter- 
minated by the fea, with a continued field of rich and fer- 
tile foil, capable of the higheft cultivation, render the pro- 
fpea very delightful. Moll of thefe objeds are obferved 
from the high road ; but on ftepping afide a few hundred 
 yards to Mount Pleafant, they are feen to greateft advan- 
tage, with a few trees, venerable for their fize and anti- 
quity, contiguous to the houfe of In-verugie, a corn-ttiill and 
extenfive bleachfield on the north fide of the Ugie, with the 
purling ftreams, ferpentine turns, and verdant banks of 
that river, which, taken altogether, form one of the richeft 
and moft beautiful lapdfcapes in Buchan. 

The farther account of this parifh will be divided into 
two parts, the country and the town ; I fiiall firft begia 
with the country part of the parifli. 

How of Buchan.— KhoMt a mile weft ward from the 
town 13 placed what is called the How, or Hohn of Buchan 
either from being the loweft part of that diftrid, or from a 
very flriking peculiarity, that on ftepping afide but a few 
yards from the high-road with houfes in your view on each 
fide, and going down a very fhort declivity, you foon fee no- 
thing before you or above, but a gentle rifing of the ground 
and the firmament. I am apt to think this peculiarity cannot 
now be found, from the ereaion of fome houfes lately in the 
panfii; at leaft, I have examined the fpot, without obfer- 
^ing the fame appearances which were there 30 years ago. 

The 



544- 



Statiflical Accbimt 



The ground in the parifh nfes gradually from the f^a f^ 
the wettward, nearly to the extremity of the parifh in moft 
places. The only eminence that can be called a hill, is 
the Stirling Hill, which feparates this parifli on the S. from 
the parifh of Cruden. The higheft part of this hill is fcarce- 
ly 200 feet above the level of the fea. In time of war, 
perfons often refort there to obferve if any Ihips are on the 
coaft ; it is feen at a confiderable diftance at fea, and was 
of great fervioe to the fifhers on this coaft as a land-mark, 
before they carried a compafs in their boats, which is only 
a late precaution, and ftill not generally ufed. 

Bays. — There are two bays in the parifh, the bays of 
Peterhead and Invernettie. The bay of Peterhead is formed 
by the town and neck of land, which projedls betwixt it 
and the fea on the N. ; this promontory is called Chalk 
Inch, Keith Inch, and Greenhill, is unqueflionably the 
eaftermoft point in Scotland, and ought to be called Bu- 
channefs. The bay is terminated on the S. by the lands of 
htvernettie, terminating in a point cilled Satie's Head. The 
other bay is formed from this point on the N. and part of 
the lands oi Boddom, the termination of the Stirling Hill 
on the S. ; this point is called Boddorn-head ; but in charts, 
and by mof^; ftrangers, is ftyled the Buchannefs. The di- 
ftance from Boddom-head to the eaftermoft point of Keith 
Inch, is about 3 miles ; and a line drawn through thefe two 
points is' confiderably to the eaftward of Satie's Head,- 
which divides thefe two bays. The fhore on the fouth fide 
of the parilk is rocky and Itigh ; at the head of each 
bay there is a fandy beach. In the bay near to Boddom- 
headf there is a fmall rock about half a mile, or a little 
more, from the land, called Skcrra, in maps denominated 
Craig Hurlie, where people often go to gather dilfe, where 
fome fea-fowl refort, and where the free mafons of this 

town

545 



town ufed fometimes to hold their meetings, when mem- 
bers were admitted into their fociety, and before the pre- 
fent Keith Lodge was erefted in the town of Peterhead. 
The bay of Peterhead affords a very fafe anchorage for 
fhips of any burden, in all fir on g gales of wind from the 
weft, W. N. W. or W. S. W. and when they blow from 
this quarter with any degree of violence, moft fhips going 
either to the N. or S. are obliged to return hither for fliel- 
ter ; and in particular, when the wind blowsffrom W.S. W. 
they can fetch no harbours on this coaft, nor either the, 
frith of Cromarty or Forth, and their only place of refuge 
is the bay and harbour of Peterhead. 

Prefent Extent. — I know of no accurate furvey of this 
patifh, which afcertaius precifely the number of acres in it ; 
I think they may be eftimated at 700c; 5000 of which 
may be arable, and 2000 mofs and moor, which moftly lie 
in the S. and S. W. parts of the parifli. 

Soil. — The foil is of great variety, from a fandy loam 
and hazly thin foil, to a rich deep black earth, and a ftrong 
clay foil ; I am of opinion the greateft part of the arable 
land, from the nature of the foil, is capable of as high cul- 
ture, and, if properly managed, would produce as weighty 
crops as the fame extent of land in moft parts of the 
country. 

The air is cold, when compared with that in other 
pj^rts of the country, at leaft in fummer ; in winter the : 
frofts are not near fo intenfe as in other places ; the air is 
rather moift. In fummer there is a mift or fog proceeding 
frequently from the fea, which fometimes extends no far- 
ther than the town of Peterhead, and which is often pecu- 
liar to this parilh, but it is by no means unwholefome, and 



546

thouj^h ftrangers complain of it, I do not think their health 
or the health of the inhabitants injured hy it. 

There are no difeafes peculiar to this parifh • 
rheumatifm, phthifis pulmonalis, fcrofula and toothachl 
appear to be mod frequent. In 1782, the influenza was 
ver^. prevalent, but not fatal, excepting in two old perfons. 
Ihe putrid fore throat has within thefe ^few years made 
us appearance, and has proved fatal in many inftances. 
Notwithftanding the moifture of the air of Peterhead, there 
IS no inftance of a real intermittent fever or ague being 
hatched in this parifh. Many people have agues, but they 
brmg them from Holland, the fea-ports in the Baltic, the 
fenny counties of England, or the fouth of Scotland. 

Pleunfies and peripneumonies are rare, though they 
fometimes happen. 

Fevers are very frequent ; but whatever appearance 
they may affume at firft, they generally terminate in a low 
nervous fever. From a very attentive obfervation and 
extenfive experience, I can fpeak with confidence of the 
danger of blood-letting in general in fevers, unlefs there is 
appearance of inflammation on feme particular part. 
There is, however, a general prejudice in favour of this 
praaice ; when a perfon falls fick, he firft bleeds, and then 
confults his phyfician. 

Mineral Waters. — There are a number of chalybeate 
fprings in this parifti, and a very ftrong one in the town. 

Lakes and Rivers. — There are no lakes in this parifli, 
and only one river called the U^ie this river confifts of 
two feparate fmall rivers which take their rife about 18 
or 20 miles from the fea ; they are called the waters of 
Stricben and Deer, from pafling by in their courfe thefe

two villages ; the two branches unite in one flream about 
five miles from this place, -and then take the name of Ugie. 
The tide flows about a mile and a half up this river, as far 
as the bridge oi Inverugie, which is very neat, conlifting of 
two arches, and was confidered of fuch importance to this 
country, as to obtain an ad of Parliament for its eredion in 
the reign of James VI 1. Small coafting veffels may enter 
the river with the tide, and fometimes come in, but very 
feldom ; it might, however, be eafily rendered navigable, at 
leaft a canal might be made; to communicate with the river. 
Such a plan has been in contemplation, the expence has 
been calculated by engineers, and I am informed it mi^ht 
be executed fo as to reach a village in .the centre of a very 
fertile and populous part of the country, about lo miles 
from the fea, at a lefs fum than L. 4000 ; but no exertions 
Have yet been made to carry this into effeft, though the 
proprietors of the ground through which the canal muft 
pafs, are m very affluent circumfta^ces, and by means of it 
the greateft advantages would accrue to a large diftdft of 
thear property. In this parifli there are feveral fmall ri- 
yuletsorftreams of water running in diiferent diredions, 
.n wh.ch there areafewtrouts and eels; from thefe 
or fmall W, four m,lls are fupplied with water for grind- 
ing gram mto meal and malt, and there is one mill on the

The rent of the fahnon-fifhing is L. loo Sterling; and the 
number of barrels caught annually is at an average from 
to 60 ; a few, for fome years, have been pickled for 
the London market, owing to the tackfmen, who relide in 
Peterhead, having very extenfive connexions with that 
branch of trade elfetvhere. Frefli falmon are fold at 2^ d. 
per pound, formerly at 2 d. There can, however, be no 
ground of complaint for the price being advanced, confi- 
dering the high price this article gives in other parts of 
the country. There are no pikes nor fhell-fifti in the river, 
except the pearl mufcle, in which pearls of value are fome- 
times found. 

Loch of Myrejide, — I have faid there are no lakes in this 
parilh. In winter, however, a fmall loch is formed in one 
part of the parifli, a confiderable extent of ground being 
overflowed from the particular lituation of the adjacent 
fields, and the ditches not being kept in proper order to 
carry ofi' the ftagnate water, called the Loch of Myrefide, 
where perfons fond of Ikating fometimes find amufement, 
■when it is frozen over with ice, and where wild ducks, 
wild geefe, and fometimes. fwans refort in winter. The 
lands overflowed by the water are meliorated in the foil, 
and would be more fertile if the ditches were kept in pro- 
per order. 

S.ea-Fifh.—'Y\ytx^ is great variety of filli caught in this 
pirifli on the coaft, and of an excellent quality, fuch as had- 
docks, whitings, flounders of all kinds, roughback, plaife, 
fole, halibut, turbot, fkate, dog and cat fifli. The lobfter 
and crab, and other fpecies of cancer, are common ; the 
lobfters formerly were more frequent, and purchafed m 
grear quantities for the London market ; there are at pre- 

fent not above 4000 annually fent from this parifh. The 

fi&amp;ers

fiftiers complain of the difficulty of finding them, and arc 
hired to fifli for them, in other places in the Murray Frith^ 
where they are more fuccefsful, and where one man will 
gain from L. 20 to L. 30 Sterling during the fifhing feafon. 
The haddocks and cod are in abundance ; great quanti- 
ties of each are fold fr'efh to fupply the town and country 
at a confiderable diftance, and from 400 to 600 barrels are 
faked, and fent from this parifli to the Xo«^ozi,imarket every 
year. Great quantities of large cod and ling are catched 
in the fpring on Rattrayhead, and on a bank which lies 
from 30 to 40 miles eaft of this town. They are dried 
upon the rocks, and after fupplying the demand in this 
part of the country, are fent to the fouth country, where 
they find a ready market, and defervedly are in very high 
eftimation. They fell here from L. I to L. 1, 10 s. the 
dozen ; about 3 d. each pound ; and are caught chiefly by 
the fiftiermen of Boddom. The greatefl: part of the cod's 
founds, in this parifli are permitted to remain and rot on 
the fea beach, or are caft into the dughill, though the ufe 
and value of them as an article of food and delicacy at 
table have been known here for many years. The crews 
of the fliips that have been fent from this town to Barry- 
head, preferve the founds, tongues, and palates of the cod 
caught there, and the owners have always found a ready 
market for them. The haddocks are in feafon and greatefl 
perfeftlon in the months of May and December. Cod are 
good at any time of the year ; of late the haddocks have 
been of a larger fize than ufual i this feafon they are very 
fcarce. 

From the dog fifti a confiderable quantity of oil is ex- 
tradled; the fifli is feldom eaten in this place, frequently 
bought to be caft into the dunghill ; a good nura!)tr are

fent fell from 4 d. to x s. Sterling each, and are rilg e ve-

living being much changed in this place. Greater quanti- 
ties might ftill be caught if eels were ufed for bait • the 
eels that are found here are fometimes employed, and an- 
W better than any other bait. The lamprey eels might 
be tried, which are found in England, and are purchafed by 
the Dutch in large quantities, from whom many leffons 
might be obtained in the article of fiflii„g. They fifli for 
cod on this coaft every fummer, and for herrings, which 
Irequently are very numerous; but none are caught here 
hy the natives of this place, though they are perfeclly ac- 
quainted with the manner of catching them, and fend feve- 
ral fliips every year to the Hebrides for that purpofe. Laft 
year m the Murray Frith, within twenty miles- of this 
place, herrings were in fuch plenty, that children, fitting on 
a rock on the fliore, and dropping a line with two or three 
fmall notched hooks fafiened at the end of the line, and 
pulling it up briikly, caught the herrings by the belly in 
great numbers, which, were fold through the country at a 
very fmall price. At that time I do not recoiled to hear 
of a fingle fliip on the coaft employed in catching them. 
The cat filh, though reckoned a delicacy by fome people, 
is feldom ufed here. There are great varieties of gray 

fifli,

fifB, called featlis, podlers and haddocks, which appear to 
be of one fpecies. Mackarel is likewife found here in great 
perfeftion, and fells from i d. to 2 d. each. They are ge- 
nerally caught with a white feather fattened on a hook, 
the boat failing with a quick motion. The ufual bait for 
fifli caught here, are haddocks, flounder, cod» fand eels, 
limpets, log, flirimps, muflels and crabs. The muffels are 
brought from the Newburgh at the mouth of the Ythan, 
about fifteen miles from this place. 

Fijhing Towns. — There are two fifliing-towns in this pa- 
rifh, the town of Boddom and the Ranheads in the town of 
Peterhead. In the fea-town of Boddom, there are at pre- 
fent five boats which pay rent to the proprietor. Thefe 
employ thirty hands. There were lately fix boats ; one of 
them was loft at fea with four of the men ; it has not fince 
been replaced. Many of the young men of that town are 
now fadors. There are befides two fmaller boats in town 
for the [old men. The fhore of Boddom is very rocky 
and high. The town is placed on the top of a precipice, a 
few feet only from the brink of it. There are fix caves 
betwixt the town and the fouthern boundary of this pa-, 
rifti. Some of them are very high, and run in within the 
land fixty yards ; one of them is immediately below the 
town, and fome of the houfes are above the arch. In the 
caves, vaft numbers of pigeons and cormorants conflantly 
refide. 

On the eftate of Boddom are the veftiges of fome fait 
pans, fait having been manufaftured there in the laft cen- 
tury. The whole mofs of Boddom is faid to have been^ 
exhaufted by fupplying fuel for making the fait ; and Sa~ 
tie's Head, formerly mentioned as a head-land, forming the 
boundary of the bay of Invernttth on the north, is faid to.

have derived its names from being in the neighbourhood of 
the fait manutadure. 

Sea Animals, Shells and Plajits, — There are no remark- 
able fea-animals. The feal, porpoife and ftar-fiai are to be 
found. There are fome fponges and coralines, and vari- 
ous kinds of fliells, fome of them beauiifully turbinated. 
The fea-plants are babby-ware, tangles, badderiocks and 
dilfe. The ware is ufed as a marfure ; from 40 to jo tons 
of kelp are made annually and exported, Dilfe and bad- 
deriocks are reckoned a great delicacy by many people, 
particularly country people, who refort here to the mine- 
ral well in great numbers in fummer, and would not think 
the water could have any eflPeft, if they did not eat them iu 
great quantities. 

Tide. — The tide flows from the horth from Rattry-head 
in the parifti of Crimond fouth and fouth-eaft, and ebbs ■ 
north ahd north-weft. In fpring tides it runs three miles 
and a half in an hour. In fome places from head-lands clofe 
in fhore, there is a confiderable variation, and currents in 
different diredtions, and only underftood by the pilots, 
who are perfedtly acquainted with them. 

Light-houfes. — There are no light-houfes in this parifh. 
I have often thought it would be of the greateft benefit to 
Ihips if one was eredled on the Stirling hill, which is a land- 
mark in the day-time to fliips at fea ; but I am informed 
by feafaring people, though it would be a proper place 
from that circumftance, yet, from the frequent mifts at fea, 
it would not eafily be obferved from fo liigh a place ; but 
there is little doubt of a light-houfe being ufeful, and even 
necelTary, either on t\iQ Keith Inch in this parifh, or on a 
fmall eminence in Broadland oppofite to Rattry-head in the 
J parifh 



Peterhead. 

oari/h of Crimond, which is nearly half way betwixt this 
town and the light-houfe at Kinnaird's head, in the parifh 
oi Fraferhurgh, at the mouth of the Murray Frith. That 
light is probably of great fervice to prevent ftiips being 
wrecked on Rattry-head which come from the north and 
down the Murray Frith ; but fliips failing to the northward 
are frequently wrecked on Rattry-head, or rocks near it, 
before it is poffible for them to fee the iight-houfe at Kin- 
naird's head ; and I have reafon to think it will be found, 
that there have been as many, if not more wrecks from 
Rattry-head to the Buchannefs fince that light-houfe was 
erefted, than at any period during the fame length of time 
before it was eftabli/hed. 

Battles. —Thtre is no tradition, or any account in hlftory 
•with which I am acquainted, of any battles in this parifh, 
or fea-fights near the coaft. There is a tradition of a duel 
or accidental rencounter betwixt two men a long time ago. 
One of the parties was killed, and buried in the fpot ^here 
he fell. This is not above two hundred yaxds diilant from 
the manfe, and though placed in a fertile field, which has 
frequently been ploughed and trenched, the graye remains 
to this day untouched. 

Forts and Moat.-^Th^rt are two forts" fituate about two 
or three miles weft of the town, both of fmall extent The 
moat, parapet, foot-bank, baftions, i^c. are very confpicu- 
mis. One of them is called Bowan's hillocks, probably 
Bownefs, from being erefted when bows were ufcd The 
other IS at Mount Pleafant, diredly oppofite to the houfe of 
Inverugie, in the parifh of St Fergus. 

There is a fmall moat on a little eminence, called the 
M.^te.htll, a mound of earth evidently artificial, and

which probably in former times was a place for diftribnting 
juftice during the feudal government. 

Old Cajiks. — There are two old caftles in the parifh, 
ifl, Old Craig or Raven's Craig, formerly, and for a long 
time, the feat of a branch of the Marifchal family. It 
ftands on the fouth fide of the Ugie, in the north-weft part 
of this parifti. At a very diftant period, it has been a 
place of very great ftrength, and, before the introduaion 
of gun-powder, could have refifted any attack. There are 
evident marks of the river having been carried round the 
houfe. The wails are very thick, and fortified round. 
Though daily mouldering, the greateft part ftill remains. 
Foxes lodge below the ruins, and ravens hatch their young 
on the top of the walls. Two fmer ruins are fcarce to be 
feen than the Raven's Craig in this parifh, and Inverugie 
in the parifh of St Fergus, on the oppofite fide of the river, 
about half a mile's diftance. The eftate and parifli of St 
Fergus firft belonged to the Cheynes, but the two caftles 
by intermarriages became the property of the Marifchal 
family *. 

2dly, 

* As the noble family of Marifchal had, for many centuries, in their 
pofleffion the parifhes of Peterhead and St Fergus, fome account may be 
expen:ed of them. 

Cambden and Boethius fay, that the family of Keith derive their origirj 
from the Ceiti, a people bordering on the Saltus H'u elniis, who gave the 
firft check to the conquefts of the Romans in the time of Auguftus Cajfar, 
but being routed in the reign of his fucceflbr Tiberius, part of tliem fet- 
tled under their leader Battus, at the mouth of the Rhine, and from his 
name the country was called Batfavia, In the reign of Corbridus 11.

In the time of Malcolm ll. who began His reign in 1004, a complete 
vidlory was obtained over the Danes, under the command of their Gene- 
ral Camits at Barry, a few miles below Dundge. This viflory is, by the 
Scotch hiftorians, chiefly attributed to the valour of the CeUi, under the 
command of Robert their leader, who is faid afterwa-rds to have killed 
Camus in fingle combat. In regard of fo great fervice, the King was plea- 
fed inftantly to bellow upon Robert the honour of knighthood, and 
created him Heritable Great Marifchal of Scotland, (but not a Peer), 
which office his pofterity continued to enjoy until the attainder of George 
the lOth Earl Marifchal in the 1715. The King beftowed feveral, lands 
on Robert, particularly fome in Eaft Lothian, called from his name and 
office! Keith Marifchal, and the fmall illand in the Forth, called Inch 
Keith, It is not very eafy to fay when the family became pofTefTed of the 
eftate of R.aven's Craig in this parifli ; the houfe is fuppofed to have been 
built in the lath century, and to have been inhabited by fome of them till 
a connexion was formed by one of the family marrying a Mifs Cheyne, 
heirefs of Inverugie, in the parifli of St Fergus. 

Sir Robert Keith. Great Marifchal. who is faid to be the thirteenth ge- 
neration in a direct line from the above Sir Robert, was very inftrumental 
in gaining the battle of Inverurie, which was the flrll vidlory King Ro- 
bert Biuce obtained in 1308. The King rewarded his bravery, by be- 
•ftowing on hira his own lands of Hall-Fore/i near to Kintore. At the 
Parliament holden in Perth 1326, the King gave him a confiderable fliare 
of the Earl of Buchan's eftate, who had been forfeited for adhering to th^ 
Englifh interefl. 

Sir Edward Keith, Great Marifchal of Scotland, and grandfon of the 
laft Sir Robert, had two fons, vi-x,. Sir Edward, who fucceeded him, and 
Sir Jbhn Keith, who married Mary Chein, daughter and coheirefs of Sir 
Reginald Chein oilny^mg\s. John Keith had got from his father the 
lands of Raven's Craig, which then comprehended a confiderable part of 
the parifli of Peterhead ; and he and his fucceffors are defigned proiuif- 
cuoufly by the titles of Raven's Craig, Inverugie, ard Craig Inverugie. 
John Keith's marriage with Mifs Chein feems to have been betwixt 
1354 and 1360. In 1535, William 4th Earl Marifchal married the eldeft 
daughter of Sir William Keith of Inverugie. and by this marriage became 
proprietor of the eftate of Inverugie, Raven's C ai-, Wc. The lands par

bay, about 3 miles diftance from the town. It {lands on a 
promontory betwixt two very deep fiffurcs, with high crag- 
gy rocks on each fide, where the fea rolls in a confiderable 
way with great force, and fuch impetuofity when the wind 
iblows from the eaft, that the fpray of the fea is often car- 
ried over the top of the houfe ; the chafm on the north fide 
is within a few feet of the houfe, which is built on the top 
of a precipice the houfe is not inhabited, and is in ruins ; 
the walls are ftlll remaining. It muft appear ftrange how 
fuch a fituation fiiould at firft have been chofeh, and yet 
fuch fituations are frequent on this coaft. Dunroter, (for- 
merly a feat of the Earl Marifchal), the old caftle oi Slains,

Boddom caille fome time formerly may have been a for- 
trefs ; there were feveral cannon remaining there lately, 
and there is one not yet removed. The houfe was inha- 
bited about the beginning of this century. 

Mill, and fome Rums. — There is a common meal mill^ 
lituate in an estenfive, romantic, folitary den, about 3 or

to be " Terras de CorfarftoTun, Buck'a, Scotfrnll et Raven's Craig:' Thtf 
lands of Tortotjloivn, probably the fame with Corfaiftawn, Scotlmill, and- 
Raven's Craig, with the fuperioiity of the town of Peterhead, and i'^mc 
lands round it, which formerly belonged to the Abbey of Deer, were in 
pofleffiaii of the Marifchal family till their forfeiture. The MarifchHl 
family were iK)t raifed to the Peerage till 1450, when William, 'Great 
Marifchal of Scotland, v;a5 called by the King's writ (not by patent) to 
fit in Parliament by the title of Lord Keith, and in 1451 by the title of 
Earl Marifchal.

4 miles wefl of the town ; the houfe containing the mill is 
built to a rock, and feems to be an obje£l of conliderable 
antiquity. 

There are likewife the remains of an old building, fituate 
upon a fertile hill, about a mile N. W. of the town of Pe- 
terhead 9 part of a wall ftill remains, and a pavement of 
fome extent overgrown vi?ith grafs. A neighbouring well 
ftill retains the name of the Abbot's Well. Some well 
drefled ftones, that have been evidently taken from the 
ruins, are obfervable in the adjacent buildings. Many flates 
have been dug up about the place, and a few corns, the in- 
fcriptions of which were entirely obliterated'; human bones 
have likewife been found inclofed in cells built of ftone. 
There is no tradition to afcertain precifely what thefe ruins 
are ; from the name of the well it is fuppofed to have been 
an Abbey. It is more probable it was the refidence of 
fome monks belonging to the Abbey of Deer, which had 
very extenfive property befote the Reformation, and pof- 
feffed a great part of this parifli. The ruins of the Abbey 
are ftill to be feen at Old Deer ; feveral of their monks 
poffeffed extenfive farms at a diftance, and fome of them 
probably enjoyed the farm in this neighbourhood, and at 
the fame time might have a place of ivorftiip and burial 
place ; and if the Abbot occafianally vilited them, or with- 
out this circumllance, they might give to their well the 
name of the head of their order. 

Natural Curiofuies. -^Khout two years ago, on digging 
for a well for the accommodation of the family at the mtnk 
at the depth of about 8 or lo feet, a complete ikeleton of I 
./..r was found ; the greateft part of the ribs fell inime 
diately to duft on being expofed to tiie air; the horns were 
more entue, and one of them is ftill preferved as a curio 
i5ty. One of my predeccftbrs, who was fettled here about

70 years ago, having refided in his younger years In the 
high country, I fufpeded the deer might have been fent to 
him 5 his widow, however, who is ftill alive, affured me a 
few weeks ago there was no fuch animal fent during 
his refidence here. There is no doubt, at a very di- 
Itant period, there were large woods in this parifli as 
roots of trees ^re found every day in the moffes It is 
very extraordinary, if it fhould have remained entire for fo 
long a tiipe; and it is not eafily to be explained, how an 
entire Ikeleton fliould have been found, unlefe thefe animals 
once refided here. 

A pretty large piece of amher was lately found on the 
fea-beach, a little below the manfe, and is at prefent in my 
cuftody. This probably has floated hither from the Baltic, 
where amber was found in the days of Tacitus, and is ftill 
to be got in confiderable quantities. Camden mentions a 
piece of amber being found at the Buchannefs inthis parifh, 
of fo extraordinary a fize as almoft to ftagger belief. 

Mines and parries,— T\\q hills on the S. and S. W. 
parts of the parifli, if they deferve that name, are covered 
with heath there are no volcanic appearances in the parifli, 
petrified parts of animals, or petrifying fp rings or waters ; 
there are no coal-mines, lime, or flate quarries, but inex- 
hauflible quarries of excellent granite, of which all the 
houfes in the town of Peterhead are built, and great quan- 
tities exported to the London market, and for different 
parts in England ; the granite admits of the fineft polifli, 
and lapidaries are frequently employed in forming it into 
various fliapes for different pieces of furniture. There 
are fome cryftals found lodged in rocks of granite, Foffil 
fliclls are found in great quantities 20 or 30 feet above the 
prefent level of the fea ; and it is remarkable that fome of 
them are of a larger flz,e than any tliat are now to be found 



on 



of Peterhead, 



on the coafl. There is great variety of pebbles to be foun^ 
on the fea-fliore, very beautiful for fhape, colour, and polifh, 
and fome of them of confiderable value. 

Pejl Ground.— In the end of laft century the plague was 
in the town of Peterhead. The perfons infefted with this 
difeafe were removed out of the town ; temporary huts of 
timber were ere£led for their accommodation to the north- 
ward, betwixt the town and blockhoufe, on a piece of wafte 
ground, where the cattle of the feuers xvere paftured ; the 
people who died there were buried on the fpot, and the 
houfes turned down and covered with earth ; it was after- 
wards called the peft-ground, and was never ploiighed or 
touched, till about 20 years ago, when this common was 
difponed as property to the feuers of Peterhead ; it was 
then trenched, and feveral pieces of timber were found not 
confumed; fome timorous people were under apprehenfions 
that bad efFedls might have enfued from breaking up this 
ground. 

Pits — On the remoteft extremity of this parifh, on the 
fouth fide of the Sadie-hill of Invernettie, oppofite to the 
Den of Boddom, (which lies betwixt the Sadie and Stir- 
ling-hill), there are a number of pits call up along the 
brae, without any order, of fuch a fize as to contain 3 or 
4 perfons. By tradition they are the Paights or ^Bs 
houfes, and the people in the neighbourhood believe the 
Pias. who they imagine were of a diminutive fize. dwelt 
there ; but this appears incredible ; and it is more probable 
that m the time of incurfions by the Danes, of which there' 
are certam accounts in the neighbouring parifti of Gruden 
fome of them had entrenched themfelves there for a fliort 
time, in order to be concealed, for which the place is ex 
tremely proper, as to this day no dwellin.g-houfe is in fight

of It; on the fouth fide there is an impaffable morafs, and 
formerly it probably was inacceffible on all fides. A gen. 
tieman who has feen thefe, fays, he has feen in Ireland pits 
fomewhat fimilar, near the high-roads, where poor people 
came out with their children begging for charity ; but 
thefe pits never could have been formed for that purpofe, 
as no high-road is near them, nor any apparent inducement 
for their refidence there. 

Meteors and Hurricane. -^On the loth of November 
1766, when affiaing at the communion at St Fergus, a 
neighbouring parifh about 5 miles to the N. W. of this 
place, I obferved in the evening a very extraordinary ap- 
pearance in the air ; looking to the S. E. about a mile 
from the church, there was the appearance of a light fome- 
what like the aurora borealis. The rays gradually became 
more vivid and ftationary, feeming like a gleam of fire, 
extending about a quarter of a mile from E. to W. It 
continued for feveral hours, and then difappeared. I have 
never heard of fuch .a phenomenon in this country, though 
I am informed it is frequently obferved in the Weft Indies. 

In January 1773, there was a remarkable high wind, 
which truly might have been called a hurricane, it un- 
roofed many houfes here, &amp;nd in feveral parifhes at fome 
diftance from this place, deftroyed a great number of trees, 
which were old, and of a large fize many were torn up 
from the roots, and fome entirely fplit. At the manfe of 
Peterhead it did confiderable damage the flates were torn 
oifthe houfe j the top of the peat-ftack beat into duft like 
povvder ; the ricks in the corn-yard turned down, and 
fiieaves carried to the diftance of fome hundred yards; a 
hay-rick, in the form of an oblong fquare, was cut through 
the middle as with a knife, from one end to the other. 
The wind blew from the S. W. 

In 



of Fetetheadi 

In 1783, the meteor fo generally taken notice of was 
obferved here. 1 was from home, about 20 miles from this 
town, in a chaife, after fanfet', when there was a thick fog; 
a fudden light came into the chaife like a flalh of light- 
- nmg. The lunar rainbow, which bj fome people is rec- 
koned a rare objea:, has been frequently obferved here. 

Land Animals.-— T\ietQ are no quadrupeds or birds pecu- 
liar to this parifh ; a few, however, may be mentioned. 
There are, befides domeftic animals, the fox, polecat, otter^ 
weafel, hare, mole, ground mice, and water rats ; I have 
never beard of a badger being feen here, though T am not 
certain but they may be found, as I once faw one which 
was killed in the pariflv of Longfide, a few miles from this 
place. 

5zV^j.— The cuckoo, lapwing, corn-rail, woodcock, field- 
fare, bat, blackbird, and fwallow, make their appearance 
regularly once in the year at different feafons. I once faw, 
m the end of the year, 2 or 3 woodpeckers, but they were 
never obferved afterwards. There are various fpecies of 
hawks, and a few owls ; an eagle was once killed in this 
panfli, the only one I have heard of being obferved 
durmg my refidence here ; fwans fometimes pafs oVer the 
town, but do not fettle here ; wild-geefe are very frequent- 
ly to be found in the parilh during the autumn and winter ' 
when an intenfe froft has fet in for fome time, vaft flocks of 
wild-geefe, of a fmaller fize than what afe commonly found 
here, pafs over the bay of Peterhead in one direction, half-

do not refide here, but are frequently to be feen, and are. 
often caught with bait. There is a great variety- of other 
fea-fowl, which are common on the eaft coaft. Great num- 
bers of wild.duck, are to be found in the parifh ; muirfowl 
are to be got in the moors ; partridges, fnipes, and plovers 
are in great plenty; the fmaller ' birds, which are to be 
found in neighbouring parifhes, are numerous. The cuc- 
koo and corn-rail generally appear in the months of April 
and May, and are feldom heard after the month of Auguft. 
The lapwing generally arrives in February or March, and 
leaves this country in the end of autumn ; lapwings of late 
have been obferved to refide in this part of the country all 
■winter ; the woodcock makes his appearance about the 
end of harveft ; they arrive here very lean, and in a few 
days become very fat ; there can be little doubt of their 
coming from Norway and the eaft country ; they are ge- 
nerally obferved firft on the eaft coaft. If there be any 
doubts of their coming from the eaft country, they may be 
removed by a fad, of which I was informed by a gentle- 
man of veracity. About 5.0 years ago, he was' in company 
with one of the proprietors of the loch of Strathbeg, about 
10 miles north of this place, in the parilh of Lonmay, 
which at that time was intended to be drained, and which, 
they had been furveying. In the evening, after funfet, be- 
fore it was quite dark, he heard a great noife, like the flut- 
tering of a flock of birds, and £aw fomething like a cloud 
before him ; on examining more particularly, he found a 
very large flock of woodcocks perfefl;ly exhaufted, and not 
able to ftir from the place where they had fettled ; they 
were likewife entirely emaciated. 

A few weeks ago, during the fevereft part of the win- 
ter, (1795), I obferved a ftrange bird, which I had never 
feen here before ; it was about the flze of a corn-rail, had 
£k long bill, with long legs, fome red fpots on its head, the

There was alive in 1790,^ and ftie is not yet dead, a poor 
woman, who declared fhe was then 105 years old, and a 
few days ago told me fhe was now 109 years of age. This 
declaration appears to be fufficiently authenticated from 
anfwers flie gives to queftions refpefting paft events, and 
other collateral circumftances. She is by no means de- 
crepit, as one might naturally exped ; ftie ftill continues 
to travel through th^ country as a beggar, and fays, the 
only uneafinefs Ihe feels, is a fmall degree of wearinefs from 
carrying her meal bag, which is generally pretty full. She 
has the appearance of being only betwixt 70 and 80 ,.years 
of age. When the laft lift of the inhabitants of the town 
of Peterhead in 1790 was taken, there were two perfons 
from 90 to 95 years of age, one perfon of 87, one of 85, 
two of 85, and 21 from 80 to 85. In the fame lift the; 
females exceed the males 336; that is, they are nearly as 
13^ to 10. The number of houfes was about 5*0. 

The population in the country part of the parifti in 1794 
was as follows : 

1794. Males, - - - 518

In the fea-town of Boddom, always conlldered as part of 
the country, there were, females 106, males 86, total 192. 
Families in the country 259; of which, in the fea-town of 
Boddom there were 49. From the rapid progrefs of ma- 
nufadlures in the town of Peterhead lince 1790, I fuppofe 
there is at prefent in the whole parifti about 4100. 

Dr Wehjler's account in 1755 queJliondble.—.\ find in Dr 
Webfter's report in 1755, the inhabitants of this parifti are 
reckoned to be 2487. I have great doubts of this being 
accurate, and therefore have not ftated it in my account of

the population at different periods. When I was fettled in 
X763, 1 never heard of any hft being taken hy Dr Web 
fter; and when 1 vifited parilh next year, Ld took an 
accurate M both of the town and count.^, r^.ny i„ th^ 
par./h were much offended at me; they had never heard 
of fuch a thing being done before, and compared my con- 
dua to the fxn of David in numbering the people. iLuld 
not have apprehended there would have been a great in 
creafe in the population, but there is no reafon to fuppofe 
there would have been 60 people fewer in 1764 than in 
1755. unlefe the long continuance of the war Aould have 

f. T.'"^xr"f r"'' ^" ^^"^^"ifl^-g the numbers in the parilh. 
If Dr Webfter calculated the number of the parilhoners 
from the regifter of baptifms, I am certain there were no 
lufJicient data on which he could proceed. 

Religious Se&amp;s.--lnxUYxi^s of 1764 and 1769, which 
were accurately taken by myfelf, by vifiting every family 
m the parifh, there were no Diffenters from the E/hibliJJj'ed 
Church but Epifcopals, that perfuafion for a long time was 
the prevailing mode of religion in this parifli, and it is ftiil 
profeffed by the wealthieft inhabitants of the town. They 
were all then of the Scotch Epifcopal Church ; lince that 
time they are divided into Scotch and Englifh Epifcopals. 
From two notes, which I have received from the minifters 
of both thefe congregations, I find there is at prefent nearly 
1100 Epifcopals. Since 1769, there were a few Roman 
Catholics in the pariflj for a few years ; there are none at 
prefeht with whom I am acquainted. Somewhat more 
than 20 years ago, a Seceder meeting-houfe Was erefled 
about 8 or 9 miles from this place ; fince that time a few 
Seceders have been in this pari/b, but they are not at pre- 
fent numerous ; I really do not kuqw their precife number, 
nor could I eafily afcertain it ; a church was built by them 



a 



of Peterhead, 567 

a few years ago ; they have worfhip there frequently, and 
a congregation is collefted from different parifhes ; but in 
fo far as I can difcover, it has made little impreffion on the 
members of the Eftabliftied Church here, who are more 
numerous than at any former period, if one can judge from 
the number of communicants, the regular progreflive in- 
creafe of the colledlions for the poor every Lord's day, and 
the numerous complaints for want of room in the churchy 
which is now far from being fufficient for thofe who vf\Ci\ 
to attend public worfliip there, and many are obliged to 
take feats elfewhere, for want of room in the church. There 
have been at different times attempts to colledl a congre- 
gation by Bereans and Methodifts, but they have hitherto 
failed. In general I believe it will be found, there is lefs 
of animofity from a diiference of religious fentiments in 
this parilh, than in mod pariihes that are fo populous, opu- 
lent, commercial, and in particular where fo many manu- 
faftures are eftablifhed. 

Valued and real Rent.— The valued rent of this parilh is 
L. 4523 : n : 8 Scotch money. The real rent is not eafily 
afcertained ; I think it is from L. 2800 to L. 3000 Sterling, 
and is much more than double of what it was 30 years 
ago. 

Farming.— There is a confiderable alteration on the mode 
of farming during that period. Forty years ago, excepdufr 
about the town of Peterhead, there was no fown grafs^ 
turnips and potatoes were not cultivated, and were brought 
by fliipmalters as rarities to their families from N-orway 
and Ire/and. For fome years paft it has been common co 
export, of one crop, 1000 bolls of potatoes to Norway and 
England from this parifli. 

About the town of Peterhead crops of fown grafs have 
been raifed for thefe laft 40 years ; the mode of manage- 

ment 



568 ^tati/lical Account 

ment at firfl, and many years afterwards, was very parti- 
cular ; a perfon was engaged at the rate of lo s. to mow 
and cure an acre of grafs. There was a great deal of work 
employed m this operation ; it required four days to mow 
the grafs ; xt was permitted to lie in the fwarth feveral 
days, afterwards carefully expofed to the fun for a confide- 
rable time, and then put into fmall cocks ; thefe were turn- 
ed over regularly every other fair day, to balk in the fun, 
feveral weeks paffed before it was thought out of danger, 
and then put into a rick, or carried to the corn-vard! 
This pradice continued till Dr Anderfon's method of cu- 
ring hay was publifhedj fmce that time there are many 
inftances of large fields of hay being entirely out of danger 
in the courfe of eight days, after beginning to mow the 
grafs, without any expofure to the fun, excepting what is 
unavoidable in reducing the number of cocks. I wifli I 
could fay the praftice was univerfal. There are many in- 
ftances which might be mentioned of good farming in this ; 
parilh, both by the proprietors and farmers, at fome parti- 
cular times ; and in many places the land is in a very high 
ftate of cultivation. At prefent I fee no fteady plan of 
good hufbandry, and in particular no proper rotation of 
crops ; there is not an acre of wheat nor of lint in the pa- 
rifli ; very little fallow, and very little expence bellowed 
on liming or dunging, though both lime and dung may be 
had in fufficient quantity, and on moderate terms, com- 
pared with thofe in other places. 

Thirty years ago perfons were hired to carry the dung 
of the town of Peterhead to the fea ; it was confidered as a 
nuifance, and might have been obtained by any farmer 
without paying any price for it j it has for many years 
been purchafed at a pretty high price, and fome of it car- 
ried into neighbouring pariflies ; but ftill there is a great 
deal negledled, and caft into the fea. 

It 



of Peterhead. 



Tt will naturally be enquired how this ihould happen. 
The firfl obftacle is prejudice ; the fecond, poverty ; the 
third, manufaftures j and the fourth, the heritors not re- 
fiding on their eftates, granting proper leafes, nor looking 
out for fome tenants of experience, enterprife, and wealth, 
who might fet an example to thofe around them. The 
greateft part of the tenants are natives of this parifh, bred 
as farmers by their parents, who, from tlie lownefs of their 
rents, were enabled to'fupport their families, and pay their 
rents with the old mode of farming ; .and they feldom think 
of looking farther than the prefent time, to provide fome- 
thing for their family, or againft any difafter that may be- 
•fal them ; the rents have been raifed, and with difficulty 
are paid by the prefent tenants, not, in my opinion, by the 
produce of their crops, but by the money received for ma- 
nufaflures by the females in their families, an accidental 
high price for cattle for feveral years, and employing their 
•horfes to lead peats to the town of Peterhead in fummer, 
when they might be more properly employed in fallowing 
a'few acres of their farm, and carrying lime and dung. The 
-truth is, a great part of the beft land in this parilh requires 
a great deal of lime and dung, from the ftiffnefs and naturt 
of the foil, to make it mellow, and 'fit to produce proper 
crops ; but when this is done, it will produce as weighty 
crops as any land in the country, and may be very pro- 
'duaive by a proper rotation of crops for many years, with- 
out receiving any manure. 

^ There are a confiderable number of fields in fown grafs 
in the panfh ; the crops are generally oats, bear, (no bar- 
ley), peafe or beans, or peafe and beans mixed together 

The lands, unlefs when broken up out of ley, are dunged 
forbear; afterwards two crops of oats are taken, fome. 
imes a crop of peafe, and then dunged for bear; formerly

given up. There are flill fome brooked oats, but there is 
now more attention paid to the nature of the feed ; Blainf 
lie, and what is caUed the Chief Baron's oats are in repute, 
and frequently purchafed for feed. 

There are a great number of bawks in the parilh which 
remain untouched ; 30 years ago, on an eftate within a 
mile of the town of Peterhead, I am informed it was an 
article in the leufes of the tenants not to break them up. 
They were called meadow ground, and their cattle paftured 
on them in fummer. There are a number of inclofures, 
moflly of earthen fences, with a ditch in the infide, which 
is found with fome attention to be a fufEcient fence. 

There are fome earthen fences, with a thorn-hedge. 
The thorns are much ncglecled ; I have no doubt of their 
thriving here with proper attention. There are a few in- 
ftances of the thorns being a complete defence, without the 
leaft attention being paid to them iince they were planted. 
There are feveral with ftone dikes on one gentleman's 
eftate, who at one time was at confiderable pains in impro- 
ving his farm. About the town of Peterhead, and in fome 
other parts of the parifli, there are a confiderable number 
of inclofures, partly of ftone, and partly an earthen fence, 
called her? a half dike ; but where ftones can eafily be 
had, they are the completeft fence, and' in many refpeds 
preferable to any other mode of inclofmg. Earthen fences 
can be built from 2 d. to 3 d. per yard ; faced with ftone, 
four feet high, 6 d. ; complete ftone fences of the fame 
height It r s. Sterling. 

The fize of the farms is fo various, that it is not eafy to 
afcertain what may be the average rent. They are in ge- 
neral from L. 2 to L, jo or L. 60 Sterling. There are only 
three above L. 100, and one farmer pays rent nearly to the 
extent of L. 200. Thefe large farms are not under the imme- 
diate management of the principal tackfmen ; and to an in- 
telligent farmer, nothing will more quickly convey a juft 

idea 



of Petef-head. 571 

idea of the flate of agriculture in this parifh, than the irre- 
gular fiae of the farms, which are determined more by local 
circumflances, than a general fpirit for improvement. 

Rent of Land.—lh the country part of the parifh I do not 
think there is any eflate which yields above 12 s. at an ave- 
rage jft^r acre, arid there are not many that can be ellimated 
at ICS. The lands in the vicinity of the town of Peterhead 
let at from L. i, to s. to four guineas each acre. Here there 
IS a fpur to induftry, and in confequence great exertions are 
made, and very weighty crops are raifed, particularly of 
potatoes, bear, and grafs. There is fcarce a day-labourer 
or manufadlurer who does not raife potatoes, by takino- a 
few falls of ground, from 4 d. to i s. each fall, trenchtng 
and hoemg the ground, and taking up the potatoes, with his 
own hands. He is employed about this work, after he has 
fpent the day at his ordinary employment, which tends to 
promote his health, gives a wholefome nourifliment to his 
family, and enables him to go on at his fedentary bu- 
linefs at home with more animation and fpirit. In confe- 
quence of the general attention beftowed on raifing pota 
toes, I think the manner of managing that crop is as well 
underftood here, as in any other part of the kingdom, and 
as weighty crops are raifed as in any other place. The 
ground IS generally trenched out of ley, fometimes after it 
has earned one crop of oats, without any manure ; by fre- • 
quent hoemg, the weeds are kept down in fummer, and ' 
the potatoes are taken up with a fpade. The expence of 
the management of one acre, exclufive of re.t and feed, is 
not lefs than five guineas ; but it is not uncommon to h ve 
above 50 bolls, of 3. ftone Dutch weight each boll, from 
an acre. An ordinary crop is ellimated at 40 bolls which 
are generally fold at 8s. per boll, and I Im a^Tn ^

feffion yielding a crop in that proportion. The potatoes 
mott cultivated here is the kidney, planted at the di- 
ftance of 12 inches each way, fometimes 10 and 12 inches. 
Sometimes they are liable to the curl, but not frequently. 

There is always an excellent crop of bear and grafs im- 
mediately after the potatoes the grafs frequently fails the 
fecond and third year, but the ground may be afterwards 
trenched for potatoes ; and with a rotation of the fame crops, 
the fame procefs continued for many yeai's, without any 
more dung or lime, where the land has been previoufly 
brought into good order by proper tilth and manure ; at 
leaft I have feen this fairly tried in different fields, without 
the ground being injured. The common praftice is, to 
trench out of ley for potatoes, the next crop bear, and the 
third crop grafs; a judicious farmer, however, recommends 
from his own experience, to take firft a crop of oats out of 
ley, next a crop of potatoes, and then fow bear and grafs- 
feeds, and by this means he thinks the grafs will remain 
longer. . In confequence of this advice, I have tried one 
field in this manner ; the grafs had an excellent appear- 
ance laft autumn, after the bear was cut down, and bids 
fair for a good crop next feafon, and confirming the obfer- 
vation I have received. 

Turnips, before potatoes were introduced, were fown, 
and the next crop bear and grafs-feeds ; on the lands, with- 
in two miles of the town of Peterhead, they are not found 
in general to anfwer ; there is fometimes a full crop of tur, 
nips, but the bear crop generally fails ; this is imputed to 
poaching the ground in carrying off the turnips, which is 
probably the cafe, as the clay being near the furface, the 
water Hands in pools all winter, and chills the ground per- 
haps by a careful hand pulling the turnips, and carrynig 
them off the field, this inconvenience might be obviated; 
this however has not been tried.

Tn a word, a general mode of good hufbandry being in- 
ttoduced, muft depend upon the proprietors of the land; 
giving long leafes, encouragement for houfes and improve- 
ments, parcelling out their farms in prOj^er lots, (for with- 
out this there can be no proper rotation of crops), abolifli- 
ing thirlage to their mills, which is the moft injudicious 
tax on improvement that ever was introduced, and mtro- 
ducing two or three fubftantial farrhers from the Lothians,- 
or Carfe of Gowrie, on their own terms, who would foon 
convince their neighbours by their example, of the great 
improvement that may be made in this parilh, as the foil 
is excellent, and there is- eafy accefs to manures of every 
kind. 

It muft be acknowledged there are ftrong reafons for this 
plan not having been adopted hitherta-, many of the heri- 
tors have but moderate incomes; they cannot afford ta- 
lower their rents ; they are ready to accept of the higheft 
offer •, the prefent tenants are unwilling to relinquifli the 
place of their nativity, and promife a rent which is more 
than they can eafily pay, from the old mode of farming v 
but which, by the money acquired from manufadtures, and 
letting out their horfes, they continue to pradtife, and ftrug- 
gle with poverty, and the difficulty of fupporting their 
credit ; but there are, and have been more opulent pro- 
prietors, who have feldom fliown any inclination to intro- 
duce fome farmers capable of fetting a good example, with 
fuch encouragement as would induce and enable them to 
fettle in this paridi. In the neighbourhood of the town of 
Peterhead, ther-e are crops of bear from 12 to 16 bolls per 
acre ; eight bolls, however, is reckoned a great crop. There 
are inftances of from 300 to 450 ftona weight of hay (20 lb. 
Dutch each ftone) produced .from one acre ; 200 ftone is^ 
reckoned a good crop-, 50 bufhels of rye-grafs feed are fre- 
quently produced from one acre ; I am likewife acquainted, 

with 



574 Statijlical Account 

with 63 ftone weight of fkutched ]int being produced from 
one acre There is, however, a great prejudice agaiuft this 
crop m th:s parifl, ; it is thought to exhauft the foil more 
than any other crop. The expences are heavy, from few 
perfons being acquainted with the difFerent parts of the ma- 
nagement of it ; and there is no lint-mill within fix miles 
of the town. 

It is not eafily fettled what may be the average from 
one acre of oats in the parilli ; I fcarcely think it can be 
called four bolls ; from fix to eight bolls is reckoned a very 
weighty crop ; but there are many fields fown with oats, 
which do not pay feed and labour. One farmer in this pa- 
rifli, who has lately taken a large farm of above 230 acres, 
and has at prefent above ico acres in his own pofi-effion, 
candidly told me a few weeks ago, that from 12 bolls of 
oats which he fowed laft crop, (and that crop was in gene- 
ral very rich elfewhere), there was only produced 20 boils, 
and of crop 1793, he had not three returns. The foil in 
general, however, is calculated to produce weighty crops of 
oats, and of a good quality, and will feldom fail to do it, 
ixnlefs when injured by previous bad management. A 
gentleman, who had a fmall eftate within three miles of 
the town, broke up a field of ley, which had been limed 
about 12 or 14 years ago, and had carried fome crops of 
grain after it was limed ; he took three crops of oats fuc- 
celTively without any manure; and in 1793, from the field, 
which confifts of fix acres, he reaped 60 bolls ; it was not 
fown down with grafs- feeds, but laft year he drew above 
L. I each acre for the natural grafs, great part of which was 
fo luxuriant as to be cut for hay. I do not mention this 
with a view to recommend the mode of management, but 
to fliew the nature of the foil. 

I am likewife acquainted with another fmall field, about 
two miles from the town, the produce of which, with the 

rotation 



/

575 



rotation of crops, I had often obferved with furprife, and 
had at firft fet down from recolledlion, but which I now in- 
fert in the words of the tenant, who is ftill alive, and o'ave 
me the account in writing : " On mj farm there was a 
" field of four acres, which, for 25 years during my refi- 
" dence there, yielded alternately full crops of grain, - vi^i. 
" beans, bear, and oats, without any manure ; I have rea- 

Ibn to think my predeceffor, for 5 or 7 years immediate- 
" ly before my entry, employed it in the fame manner." 
The number of bolls from each acre was never afcertained, 
but the field always attrafled my attention, as producing 
the richeft crop in the neighbourhood, before any improve- 
ment was made on the lands near the town of Peterhead. 

In a word, I am fatisfied the greatefl part of the parifli is 
- capable of the highett degree of cultivation, and I hope 
foon ihall arrive at it. 

Sea-fand has only begun to be tried laft year ; on thf 
-fea-coaft, to the northward, for upwards of 24 miles, it has 
been ufed for fome time with great fuccefs, and is even 
preferred to lime ; it may truly be called fhell-fand, and is 
more calcareous than what is found on the Qiore in this 
parifh. 

It is not poffible to afcertain the precife quantity of grain 
raifed in this parilh ; I am apt to think it is not fufficient 
for the fubfiftence of the inhabitants. 

Gardeuing is in its infancy, and is making very flow 
progrefs. 

Confiderable attention is paid to the daifj by feveral 
perfons in the parilh, though in general little attention is 
paid to the breed of the cows. There are a few of an ex- 
cellent fliape, and they give large quantities of milk, from 
8 to 12 puus each. Six pints, 1 am apt to think, is mor^ 
than the average from the cows in the parilh. There is 
butter and cheefe of an excellent quality, the butter gives 
from 6 d. to 8 d. the lb. 20 ounces Dutch, or nearly 22 

ounces 



57^ 



Statijliccil Account 



ounces Englifti, being the ancient Scotch trone pound; 
liheefe from 3 s. to 5 s. the ftone, 20 lb. Dutch each ftone. 
1 know of three cows for feveral weeks one fummer, 
yielding each of them daily i lb. of butter, i6 ounces 
Dutch each pound \ and of one cow, which calved about 
Chriftmas, yielding 11 lb. of butter in five days, the pound 
:onlifting of 16 ounces fhe gave from 8 to 9 pints of 
milk, and was fed with hay and cabbage. A farmer, who 
has an extenfive farm, and is very attentive to his dairy, 
informs me, that with good management " A cow will, 
during the fummer, be worth about L. 5 Sterling. I 
have feven cows, which give about 8 pints of milk each 
** day, and yield me profit in that proportion." 

Leafes. — The leafes are in general for 19 years; fome for 
that period, and the life of the tenant ; there are a few for 
two or three nineteen years, with one or two lives. On 
the farms, which have the longeft leafes, the lands are in 
the higheft ftate of cultivation. 

Planting. — There is very little planting in the pariflb. 
There are fome trees at Invernettie and Little Cocklaw-; 
fome young timber at Alehoufehill, Blackhoufe, and 
Grange. At the manfe, within 200 or 300 yards of the 
fea, there is a thriving plantation of elder and willows 
lately raifed. I fliould not have mentioned this trifling 
circumftance if I had any merit in raifing the plantation; 
laft year there was a flioot of elder, the growth of the fum- 
mer, of five feet in length. It would add much to the or- 
nament of this country, if heritors would be at fome pains 
in raifing fuch trees as are fuited to the climate ; formerly 
there were large forefts in the parilh.

P/o»^/&amp;j.— The parifli was formerly divided into 52 
ploughgates, or, I fuppofe, -into- as many divifions as 52 
ploughs could eafily manage in the old %le of farming. 
At prefent, in the town and country, I do not think they 
exceed 90, though this cannot be eafily afcertainisd. 

There are a few Englilh ploughs drawn by two horfes, 
or two oxen ; in general four, fometimes fix horfes, are 
employed in dragging a Scotch plough ; many ploughs are 
drawn often by two horfes, with a cow and a young fteer ; I 
have even feen, and I obferved it laft year, a plough with 
cue horfe, a cow and a young fteer. 

Harrows, Fanners, and Carts.— -Thtxe are a few drag- 
harrows. Till lately^ many fingle harrows were ufed with 
timber tynes. They are ftill in general too light for the 
foil. 

There are no threihing-machines. Fanners have been 
lately introduced, and are now pretty numerous. 

The carts in general. are very fmall, and of a bad con- 
ftruStion. A boll of coals, weighing 36 ftone Dutch weight, 
is reckoned a fuflScient load for one horfe and cart when 
hired. There are a few carts of a better conltrudtion. 

Horfes, Cattle, Sheep, and Hogs. — There are in the whole 
parilh about 400 horfes, for the purpofes of ploughing, ri- 
ding, and carriages; 900 cattle, and 590 (heep; the Iheep, 
are moftly on the confines of the moor and mofs, and have 
a very fcanty pafture. In fummer, a few ewes and lambs 
are kept on tether, fcattered through the parifti, and excel- 
lently fed. Horfes are generally of a fmall fize, and there 
are few in the parifh of confiderable value. 

Excepting what is fed at the mills, hogs are very rare ia 
the parifli.

quifite in many, families to procure the neceffaries of life, 
rendered complaints of bad health much lefs freguent than 
ufual. - - 

Some difcoveries were made in confequeuce of the late 
harvefl: and fcanty crop of 1782. 

Bear was fown earlier than ufual in 1783, that there 
might be accefs to the crop as foon as poffible ; inftead of 
fowing that grain as formerly in the month of May, it was 
fown in the end of March and beginning of "April ; the 
pradlice has fince continued, and it is thought to be, both 
as to the quantity and quality of the grain, an advantage,-, 
•when the ground is in good order and free from weed&amp;. 
During the month of April, there is a fiilEciency of moi- 
fture in the "foil' j but in the month of May, particularly the 
latter part of it, when the drought is fevere, the greateft 
part of the feed often remains in the ground without fpring- 
ing till the later rains, which frequently do not fall, till 
the middle or end of July, iri confequence of which the crop 
is very defeftive, and unequally ripened ; when tbeire is 
fufficient moifture in the ground, it is not reckoned too late 
to fow bear on the lail days of the- toonth of May, but this 
is uncertain, and rt is of great importance to obferve the 
proper feafon for fowing bear, Which does not meet Avith 
that attention which it deferves. ' 

From a courfe of experiments made by Dr Ari^^rfbrt on 
different fpecies of grain of crop 1782, he found that oats 
when frefti, though only half-ripened, if once they germi- 
hate, will produce as weighty crops as oats fully ripened. 

In this parifh there was a field in 1782, which produced 
from 20 to 30 bolls of oats, which Were not frofted, but 
were never fully ripened ; they continued always green, 
and were cut doWn in the end of November, with their 
colour very little changed. *Thfc greiitdl part of them was 
fold for feed-o^ts,' nearly at the fame price with oat? fully 
c ripened. 



of Peterhead. 581 

Ripened, and imported from England. A gentleman , in 
the neighbourhood, who was always attentive to the inte- 
reft,of his tenants, by the advice of his overfeer, purchafed 
about 18 bolls of thefe oats for his eftate, and afterwards 
9ame on purpofe to thank the perfon who fold them, for 
the frefti oats his tenants had received, which, he faid, had 
anfwered better tl^n what bad the appearance of being 
much riper and fuller, but which had fufFered from the 
froft.. Part of the fame oats were fown in this parifh, and 
there was no apparent difference of produce next crop, be- 
tween them and oats of the beft quality that had been im- 
ported from England ; they were only fown a little thicker 
than other oats.. Two or three bolls of them were fent to 
the mill, and a boll fcarce yielded iiv.e pecks of meal. 

This ftrongly Ihqws the fallacy of arguing a priori in 
any thing relative to agriculture, as well as in other branches 
of natural philofophy. It is not fuppofed, that fuch oats 
will be preferred for feed in ordinary years ; but in years 
pffcarcity, and iimilar to 1782, the fa£l deferVes attention. 
. _There were fome peculiarities in crop 1784, which de- 
ferye being mentioned. During the ordinary feafon for 
fowing oats, which is from the beginning of March to the 
.end jof April, there were conftant fliowers of rain ; the 
fields were never dry j the greateft part of the farmers de- 
layed fowing till the feed-time was nearly elapfed the 
^rain was fown, but the rains continuing, the greateft part 
was never covered with mould, the ground being much 
ppached with the horfes and cattle in attempting, and barely 
.attempting to harrow it ; and great fears were entertained 
concerning, the crop. The feed, however, that was not 
covered, from the great moifture, all germinated, and took 
joot ; and there was the richeft crop, both of grain and fod- 
der that has been known in this century j it has often finc'e 
been compared with crop 1775, which was a dry feafon, 
3 ■ and

and produced a very rich crop, with very little fodder, and 
1 find the preference has in general been given to crop 
1784. The harveft was likewife rainy and late; the oats 
were filled,, but in general never ripened, or rather were 
never -of a proper yellow colour ; many farmers were too 
impatient; fome permitted their oats to (land all the month 
of November, and were fenfible they ripened more in that 
month, than at any former period. One farmer in this 
parifh difmiffed his reapers in the end of Odober ; he left 
one large inclofure where the oats were quite green ; they 
filled perfedly during the month of November, and gave 
as much meal as any oats on his farm. I could mention 
many other inftances in other years bf the propriety of not 
being too hafty in cutting down oats before they are com- 
pletely filled, though the feafon is late. On the whole, 
there never was a more plentiful crop than in 1784. Meal 
was felling about Candlemas next year at L. 8 Scots ; be- 
fore next harvefl: it could have been purchafed below' lo s. 
each boll, the laft crop exceeding every perfon's expe£la- 
tion, and what was more extraordinary, the oats that were 
green, and had been referved as of lead value, producingas 
much meal as thofe that appeared to be fully ripened. 

The greatefl part of the peafe of this crop was entirely 
loft, and never taken off the ground for want of good wea- 
ther to dry the ftraw. I had myfelf that year a field of 
from fix to feven acres in peafe and beans, four acres in 
beans, and two and a half in peafe ; the peafe were fown 
in the beginning of March, and completely covered, by 
getting the ground harrowed ; from that time to the end 
of April I only found one day for fowing my beans; they 
were fown, but I could only, from the conflant rains, givo 
the ground a flight touch with the harrow ; the greateft 
part of tlie beans being ftill uncovered, I colleded a few- 
bays, each; with a ftick in his hand, and puflied every benn

we dlfcove^ecf a few inches below the ground ; there was 
a moft luxuriant crop of peafe and beans, both of grain and 
fodder. The peafe, after they were cut down, were fre- 
quently covered with fnow, and in turning them a great 
part of the grain was loft ; I waited till near the end of 
November, and feeing no profpeft of preferving them in the 
ordinary manner, I took three Norway trees, of 10 or 
12 feet in length, tied them at the top with a rope, and ex- 
tended them at the bafe ; the peafe were built round the 
trees on the outfide, four fmall arches were left at the bot- 
tom, all was hollow within the trees, and open at the top 
before the rick was thatched ; the air ruihed in, went to 
the top, and in a few days the ftraw, which was formerly 
wet, was as dry in the infide as on the outfide ; the whole 
crop of peafe was contained in three ricks ; the grain that 
remained, and ftraw, was entirely preferved ; and if the 
c:iperiment had been tried fooner, the whole of the grain 
*ould have been faved. After the peafe were threftied 
out, I offered the draw for fale in 1785, at 3 d. each ftone ; 
I only fold at that time a few ftones; in 1786, there was a 
fcarcity of fodder; I fold the peafe-ftraw at 4d. each ftone; 
the farmers had fufpicions at firft of its being fpoiled from' 
age, and rotten, and were flow in purchafmg it ; it wa6 
however foon fold, and the perfon who bought the kft part 
of It came to me fmihng, and faid he had not bought cheap- 
«r or freftier fodder that winter, and that his horfes ap- 
peared to be exceedingly fond of it. This method of pre- 
fervmg peafe is very fimple, but notwithftanding of this 
circumftance, and though it is perfeftly underftood, and 
frequently pradifed in the higher parts of the county, 
wb«i-e there is plenty of timber, and was pretty generally 
known in this corner at the time, I have never feen it re- 
peated, and I am acquainted with many inftances of peafe 
being entirely loft fince that year. The want of timber 



can 



Statijlical Account 



can be no excufe ; as much more is wanted at moft farms 
in the courfe of the year,, and it does not fufFer by being 
employed in the manner I have mentioned. 

Many, by hurrying in their beans to the corn-yard in 
1785, loft them and. the fodder. I delayed touching mine 
till the laft day of November ; and in the night-time, with 
moon light, and a brilk breeze of wind from the weft, 
got them all out of danger ; beans are a hardy grain, and 
will remain long in the field, without receiving injury from 
the weather. I know no part of hufbandry in this parifli 
in which farmers are more apt to err, than in the manage- 
ment of their beans, by taking them too quickly off the 
field ; if not fufficiently dry, and even blackened, the fod- 
der and grain are both fpoiled. 

The foil in this parifli, whether it be a fandy or clay 
foil, is excellently calculated for railing beans. They are 
all fown in the broadcaft ; in this manner they have more 
fodder, but lefs grain, than if they were fown in drills and 
hoed ; but the fodder is fo valuable for horfes, (in my opi- 
nion nearly equal to hay arid oats), that there are great in- 
ducements to continue this praftice. Next to turnips, po- 
tatoes, or fallow, they are the beft preparing crop for grafi: 
It is rare to fee beans in the higher parts of the county; 
but they deferve tq be introduced, as 1 know few crops 
more valuable. ' * 

Births. It is not poffible to afcertain the number of 

births from the feffion-regifter, as many people decline en- 
tering their childrens names in the record. Since the pix- 
pofal of a Statiftical Account, I have inferted in a -private 
regifter all that I have baptized. The refult is as foUoxvs, 
for three years, from the 31ft March 1791 to the fame 
date 1794, 136 males, and 109 females: total. 245 J 
leverage each" year, nearly 8a.. From.. ?U the information 



of Peterhead. 



i can receive, there txiay be from 20 to 25 more baptized 
in the parifli each year^ 

Burials. — There is no regifter df burials kept by the 
feffion ; I have, however, requeiled the prefent fexton, fince 
he entered on his office, to niark accurately every burial in 
the church-yaird, and to keep a book for that purpofe, that 
he may know when it is proper to open a grave where a 
corpfe has formerly been laid down. This regifter, of which 
1 keep a copy, is now before me 5 and from the 2oth Janu- 
ary 1773 to the 20th January 1795, there have been bu- 
ried 1425 ; average for 22 years, nearly 6j. For the firft 
eleven years during this period, there were buried 672, 
average 61 ; for the laft eleven 753, average each year 6&amp;. 
This, however, does not accurately ftate the number of 
deaths in this parifh j many ftrangers are buried here^ and 
many are carried out of this place to other places. The 
fexton, however, alTures me, there are more carried out of 
this parifli than brought hither, owing to the number of 
new inhabitants who refide in the town of Peterhead. 

Small-pox.-^Xn 1774, I find there were 72 burials : of this 
number 27 died of the fmall-pox : in 1781, there were 86 
turials, and of this number 34 died of the fame diforder. 
Inoculation has been introduced here for thefelaft 25 years j 
but the praftiee is far from being general. 

Marriages. ~^lt is flill more difEcult to afcertaiil the num- 
ber of marriages. IJiave kept for feveral years a lift of 
perfons I have married ; but this only happens when the 
bride refides in this parifli, and- is a member of my congre- 
gation ; I have a note before me from the clerk, from the 
22d of May X791 to the ift of March 1794, of proclama- 
tions dunng that period, they amount to 84 j fo that at an 

Vai. XVI. .V

average each year they may be eftimatcd at 28 pair. Nei- 
ther does this afcertain the number of marriages, as the" 
bans of marriage are publiflied in the parifli where either 
the bride or bridegroom refides. I find from the 23d June 
1791 to the fame date in 1794, I have married only 54 
pair ; average each year during this period, 18. 

Mlnifters. — From all the information I have received, 
there have been here five Prefbyterian mlnifters fince the 
Revolution, Mr Guthrie, Mr Brown, Mr Farquhar, Mr 
Walker, and the writer of the prefent account. Mr Brown 
left this parifli, and was afterwards fettled at Behelvie, in 
the prefbytery of Aberdeen : Mr Farquhar went to Chapel 
of Garioch, in the prefbytery of Gariobh, and died only a 
few years ago. He was father of Mr John Farquhar, late 
minifter of Nigg, the author of two volumes of fermons,. 
which are fo generally and defervedly efteemed. They re- 
ceive an additional value from the charafter of the author, 
whofe life was a tranfcript of the fentiments he publiflied. 
He died at a very early age ; the warmth of his afFeftion: 
was the caufe of his death ; having overheated himfelf in- 
going to fee a friend, who was ill of a fever, he was in a 
few days feized with the fame diforder, which foon proved, 
fatal : 

Multis ille bonis ficbilis occidit,

My predeceflbr was father likewife of Mr Walter Far- 
quhar, fo eminent in London for his extenfive practice and 
Ikill in the medical profcflion. Both his fons were bora 
in this pavifli. The, prefent incumbent was fettled here 
in 1763.

Xiving. — ^The living, by a decreet of the court of teinds 
in 1792, which is not yet allocated on the different heri- 
tors, confifts of 5 chalders of meal, 3 chalders of bear, and 
-L. 41 : 13 : 4 Sterling of money, in which is included L. 8, 
6s. 8d. for communion-elements. 

The glebe confifts of different patches of ground, in 
all betwixt 8 and 9 acres, part of the foil very indiffe- 
rent, but now rendered more valuable by fome improve- 
ments of the prefent incumbent ; belldes a garden, aod fite 
for the manfe and offices, and a privilege of pafturage on 
the links before the manfe. 

Marife.'^ThQ manfe is very old ; was burnt in 1740; 
- rebuilt a little afterwards by the lafl incumbent, on a com- 
promife with the heritors.; the walls of I the former manfe, 
which were built with mortar, I am informed ftill remain. 
The whole of the houfe is very infufficient ; the offices 
V^ere built about 16 years ago, and with repairs to the 
manfe, which were only about L. 5, cofl the heritors L.90 
-Sterling, the whole that has been paid by them during my 
refidence here. It has coft me a much greater fum for 
fome additional accommodation, and keeping the manfe 
and offices in repairs, which are renewed every year. 

Church. — Tlie church was built in 1771, in the Kirk- 
town, and is an elegant building 78 feet long, and 39 
feet broad over the wajls, which are of a proper height to 
admit of the galleries being fufficiently raifed. 

From the pofition of the pulpit, and the arrangement of 
the feats, both in the galleries and on the ground-floor, it 
is the mofl convenient place of worfliip with which I am 
acquainted. The plan was fent by one of the heritors 
refiding at Edinburgh, and was got from an eminent ar- 
cljitedt there. 

There

There has been a great alteration in the flyle of building 
churches in the Synod of Aberdeen lince its erection, but 
■yvithout attending to the ftrift proportion and fimplicity of 
this plan, which might ferve as a model for any church, 
the pulpit being placed at an equal diftance from the eaft 
and weft end of the north wall, and every perfon both fee- 
ing and hearing the minifter. The whole expence of the 
building was only L. 520 Sterling ; and a fmall fund being 
obtained, by the rent of a few feats, which were fixed after 
the plan was completed, at prefent under the management 
of the kirk-fefiion, the heritors have paid nothing for re- 
pairs ever lince the church was built. 

The Scotch and Englifh Epifcopals and Seceders have 
each a very convenient place of worihip in the town of 
Peterhead. There is an organ in each of the Epifcopa} 
chapels. 

Poor. There are no affeffments on the heritors for the 

fubfiftence of the poor. They are fupported chiefly from 
colleaions in the church, which are very liberal. When 
1 was fettled in 1763, there was about L. 90 Sterling 
in the box •, the money at prefent fettled on intereft does 
not much exceed that fum. Thirty years ago, ordinary 
colleaions every Lord's day were from 7 s. to 8 s. ; they 
-are now from 18 s. to L. i. This, with the ordinary per- 
(juifites, under the management of the kirk-feflion, and the 
intereft of a fmall capital, affords confiderable relief to the 
poor, who for fome years have varied from 70 to 80. 
There are few beggars in the parifti, excepting on Friday, 
on which there is always a market in the town of Peter- 
head : many on that day come in from the neighbouring 
pariflies. At the communion, which is difj^enfcd once 
every year, there is colleaed from L. 16 to L. 17 Sterling. 
A colleaion of L.5 Sterling is fent each year to the In.

firmary of Aberdeen; and frequently very large collec- 
tions are obtained in the church for the relief of particular 
families, whofe fituatlon from fome unexpedled difafter re- 
quires immediate relief. Two annual diftributions are 
made in the months of May and November, befides giving 
largely at the communion, and on every Lord's day, to 
perfons, whofe fituation appears to the feffion fo indigent as 
not to admit of a delay till the ordinary time for diftribu- 
ting the poor's money. 

School.— The fchoolmafter's falary, for a long fpace of 
time, was 13 bolls 3 firlots of meal, from the country part 
of the parifh, and L.3 : 6 : 8 Sterling from the town. 
During the laft vacancy, which happened in 1788, the 
town of Peterhead petitioned the heritors of the parifli to 
permit them to get a fchoolmafter fettled by a comparative 
trial, to teach in concert with another fchoolmafter, fettled 
by Dr Anderfon's truftees, who have the appointment of 
feveral charity fchools ; that thefe two might form a kind 
of academy for teaching Englifh, Latin, Greek, writing, 
arithmetic, and book-keeping, the elements of mathematics 
and navigation •, and engaged that if this fcheme were 
adopted, they would advance the fchoolmafter's falary to 
L. 15, befides the meal payable by the country part of the 
parifli, and give both the fchoolmafters places for teaching 
in the town-houfe. 

The heritors granted this petition ; Mr Adamfon was 
found beft qualified on a comparative trial, and prefented 
by the town of Peterhead. His falary at prefent is 13 
bolls 3 firlots of meal from the country part of the parifti, 
L. 10 from the town of Peterhead, and L. 5 from the mer- 
chant's box ; he has likewife a fee of L. 2 : 15 : 6 as feffioQ- 
clerk. The whole of his emolumentij, with fchool-dues 
and perquifites as felSon-clerk, will not exceed L.35 Ster- 
ling.

ling. His colleague, Mr Smith, has Sterling of fa 

larj. Mr Adamfon teaches Latin and Engliih, Mr Smith 
wmmg and arithmetic, in Separate fchools. The number 
of fcholars who attend both fchools is from 40 to 50, and 
IS feldom more. There are none at prefent who are taught 
Greek, or any p.rt of the mathematics, though Mr Adam- 
fon IS perfeaij qualified to teach thefe, and every other 
part allotted to him ; he is a young man of very great abi- 
hties. Mr Smith is likewife very affiduous in his depart- 
ment. There is befides another fchoolmafter in the town, 
.who teaches writing, arithmetic, book-keeping and Latin 
without any falary. He ha^ at prefent from 40 to.50 boys,,' 
and 17 girls. There are likewife in town 9 women, who 
teach the younger children reading, and the girls knitting 
and fewing; their number of fcholars at prefent in winter 
is about 150, and in fummer they are much more nume- 
rous 5 only one of thera has any falary, and flie has only 
L. 2, 5 s. Sterling from the parents, whof^ children attend 
her fchool. Ther^ is alfo in the fea-town of Boddom a 
fchoolmiftrefs, who teaches about 20 children to read Eng- 
lifli. Mr Shand, organift to the Scotch Epifcopal chapel, 
teaches to play on the harpfichord and guitar in the town 
of Peterhead, but does not meet with that encouragement 
which his talents and charadler deferves. 

Attempts have been made to improve the church-raufic

have been at an Univerfitj from this parilh fince 1763. 

Fuel.— The country part of this parifli is fupplied with: 
peat from the moiles-, the tbwn, partly with peats, and 
partly with coals. From the great prejudice in favour of 
peats, the moffes are nearly exhaulfed, and the whole parifli 
will foon be obliged to make ufe of coals. It will probably 
be of advantage to the farmefs, who employ a great part 
of fummer in managing and leading their peats, which, 
might be better employed in fallowing or driving lime and 
dung to their farms. 

Thirlage. — Every fpecies of fervitude is aboliflied, ex- 
cepting thirlage to the mills, which is univerfally confider- 
ed as a heavy burdenj, and a great bbftacle to improve- 
ment; 

7ro/erj.-— There are' irery few crofters in the parifh. 
Thofe who have large farms complain of the, want of them, 
ftom the difficulty of finding fervanti. ; 

Wages. — The wages of fervants have ijQcreafed very 
much. Thirty years ago, a man-fervant could have been 
hired for L. 2, 10 s. Sterling in the year ; they are now 
from L. 5 toL. 8; maid-fervants were from las. to 15 s. 
in the half-year ; they are at prefent from La I to L. 1, 10?, 
Day-labourers were 8 d. each day in fummer, without their 
viftuals, they are now i s. •, mafons and wrights were 1 s, ] 
they are now is. 6 d. ; in harveft, reapers get i s. each,

Language. 



Statijlical Account 



Language.— Tht language fpoken in this pariftx is thd 
broad Buchan dialed of the Englifb, with many Scotti- 
cifms, and ftands much in need of reformation, which it is 
to be hoped will foon happen, from the frequent refort of 
polite people to the town in furomer. 

The names of places in the parifli feem to be derived 
chiefly from the Engiifli and Gaelic. Thus, Alehoufe-hill, 
(a houfe which the family of Raven's Craig ufed to fre- 
quent as a taverrr^i Myrejide, Hayfieldy New/eat, Mount- 
F leaf ant ^ Scotch-mill are Englifh ; likewife, Stay the Voy- 
age, (a place where the family of Marifchal ufed to halt in 
their way from Inverugie to Peterhead), another Sttiy the 
Voyage, from a tenant of the former place having carried 
the name of his firft place of refidence to a houfe in the 
oppofite fide of the parifli ; Crofs-fold, from a place of wor- 
fliip having been in that field before the Reformation. In- 
vernettie, Auchtiegall, Glendenmy, and Balmuir, I am in- 
formed are Gaelic and Blackhovfe^ which was fuppofed to 
bfe Englifh, I am informed, is likewife Gaelic ; Blackhonfe 
being derived from Blockhoufe, which fignifies a place of 
defence in front of a caftle. The truth is, Blackhonfe, in 
this parifh, on the fide of the Ugie, is oppofite to the ruins 
of an Old Caftle, which belonged to the family of the 
Cheynes in St Fergus, and which was their place of refi- 
dence, long before the houfe of Inverugie was built, or 
they had any connexion with the family of Marifchal, or 
Keiths of Raven's Craig. 

Volunteers The people in general in the parifh are not 

fond of a military life ; but in the prefent war, when they 
are fenfible they have every thing that is valuable at fiake, 
many have enlifl:ed for the army and in the town of Pe- 
terhead, two companies of volunteers, 50 men each com- 
pany, have turned out with the greateft readinefs for the 

defence 



of Peterhead.

flefence of the town, and more if neccffarjr could eafily have 
been muftered j they have likewife begun to enlifl: for the 
navy ; and there is ho doubt that the necelTary comple- 
ment of 1 8 feamen, or 36 landmen, will foon be found. 

CharaEter. — The people in the country part of the pa- 
rifh are in general very diligent, temperate, peaceable, and 
inofFenfive in their manners. I know of no crime for 
which any perfon has been capitally convicted. They are 
very punftual in their attendance at church, and obfervance 
r of divine ordinances ; and their outward decency in times 
of public worfliip is very exemplary. 



TOWN OF PETERHEAD. 

Town. — About a mile fouth of the Ugie ftands the town 
•of Peterhead, latitude 570 30'--33" N. on a peninfula, 
which projefts into the German Ocean, and forms the 
eaftermoft point of land in Scotland ; it is called I'eter's 
Polle by the Dutch, and, as formerly mentioned, is fuppo- 
fed to be the Cape taken notice of by Ptolemy. An 
Iflhffius, w"hich connefts the town with the country on the 
N. W. is only about 800 yards broad. The reft of the 
town is furrounded by the fea, which on the eaft part is fo 
near the houfes, that a bulwark is raifed to proteft them 
from high ftream-tides. 

The town, with the adjacent lands, of confiderable value 
and extent, formerly belonged to the Abbey of Deer. In 
1560, qiieen Mary appointed Robert Keith, fon of WU- 
liam.4th Earl Marifchal, Commendator of Deer ; in 1587 



594 



Stc^tijlical Account 



by the title pf Lord 4ltreey having created the Abbey land* 
a temporal lordlhip in his favour j this peerage became 
extincl, and the Abbey lands fell to the Earl Marif- 
chal. Anno 1637, William 6th Earl Marifchal obtained 
a new charter from the Crown of the Ahhey lands, befides 
the tithes great and fmall of the parifh of Peterhead, the 
parfonage of the church, falmon and white-fifliing. The 
following lands are mentioned, as fituate in the parifti of 
Peterhead : " Terras de LehilL, terras de Munchijbill, ter- 
V ras de Granig, (at prefent Grange)^ de Raehill, (where 
*' the windmill at prefent ftands), de Fijherhurn^ de Peter- 
*' head cum Anchoragiis ejufdem." After the forfeiture 
of Earl Marifchal in 1715, the town, with the lands be- 
longing to that family in the parifh, were bought by a 
liihing company in England; which failing in 1726, fold 
the town and thefe lands to the Governors of the Merchant 
Maiden Hofpital of Edinburgh, at the price, if 1 am not 
milinformed, of L. 3000 Sterling. The rental amounted 
to 191 bolls of bear, 199 bolls of meal, a bolls of oats, and 
L. 80 Sterling of money, belides the feu-duty for property 
in Peterhead. The Governors let thefe lands to one tackf- 
man at L. 245 Sterling, at which rent it remained till about 
20 years ago. 

A few years before that period, the Governors expofed 
all their property in this parifh to faie, and it was purcha- 
fed by a gentleman at Edinburgh fpr L. 10,000 Sterling, 
who thought the price high, and had an option to confider 
for fome time, and relinquifh the bargain if he thought pro- 
per ; when the time was nearly elapfed, he gave in his re- 
nunciation, which was accepted very readily by one of the 
Governors, who never approved of the fale, and put the 
paper into the charter-chett, marking on the back of it, a 
miraculozis efcape. He was right in his opinion; i:i I7i3 
the rent was raifed to L. 870, and in 1794 to L. 1010 Ster- 



of Peterhead.

ling, befides t^ie money which the Governors are daily re- 
eeiving for ground which is feued off, and amounts in a 
few years to a very'confiderable fum. 

The town was formed info' a burgh of barony by Geotge 
Earl Marifchal in 1593 ; it was then Called Keith Inch. 
The number of feiiefs to whom the charter was granted 
was only 14. The ground feued out, about 3 acres; the 
purchafe-moHey 30CO merks, and the mail or feu-duty 
L. 7, IIS. Scotch. From the boundaries' of the different 
feus, they feenni to have been placed from the Ronheads and 
Keith Inch, the eaftern points, to the remoteft txtrertiity of 
what is at prefent called the town of Peterhead, for one of 
the feus is bounded by the Kirkburn, which divides the 
town ofi the fouth-Weft lide from the links, where no hou- 
fes are eredled. The original feuers appear to have been 
fifliers, for each of them is permitted to have a boat for 
white-fiftiing, on paying the teind-filh, and " fic as happens 
" to pafs to far fifhing, the faid Earl and his forefaids fliall 
" have fuch teynd thereof as the inhabitants of 
" pay." When the number of feuers ftiall amount to 30 
perfons, they were obliged to build a tolbooth, or pay 200 
merks to the Earl for building it; they were like wife enga- 
ged to build fufficient ftone flated houfes, 24 feet in length, 
and 1 5 in breadth, in fuch places as may be found moft fot 
the decoration of the burgh, and to pay L. 1 yearly till they 
build fuch houfes. They were farther obHged to build and 
ereft a bulwark in the mouth of the haven called Port 
Henry, (now the North Harbour), « for eafement of their 
" feafaring velTels, and Iball accomplilb the fame half a 
" year after that the faid Earl hath received the graffunn 
" of 20 tenants." 

The town at prefent holds of the Governors of the Mer 
chant Maiden Hofpital of Edinburgh as fuperiors. The 
Government of the town is veftcd in a bailie and 8 



coun- 
fcllors.

fellors. The bailie is named by the fuperidrs, and has hie 
commiffion from them ; .the counfellors are chofen annually 
by the feuers, at a general meeting called for that purpofe j 
4 of thefe are chofen from among the merchants, 2 from 
the ftiipmaftersy and 2 from the trades. The bailie exer- 
cifes his judicial authority, or legal jurifdiftion, competent 
in ,a burgh of barony ; and the counfellors, jointly with the 
bailie, have the adminiftration of the common good of the 
town ; the public revenue of which, about 30 years ago, did 
not exceed L. 135 Sterling ; it is now about L. 240, refulting 
from the fliore-dues, petty cuftoms, and the rent of fome 
land adjacent to the town, which was formerly a common, 
but now the abfolute property of the feuers. The whole 
of this revenue is annually laid out in improving the har- 
bour, fireets, other public works, and for the good of the 
town. 

The town is nearly in form of a crofs, and may be di. 
vided into four parts : The Kirk-town, Ronheads, Keith 
Inch or ^en%ie, and the town properly fo called. A fmall 
ropery is carried on^ a number of day-labourers and ma- 
imfadurers refide in the Kirktown, which formerly was 
disjoined from, but is now almoft conneaed with the town 
by one continued llreet. The feus extend no farther than 
the Kirktown to.the weftward, which is feparated by a. 
fmall rivulet from the manfe and the links, where there is 
excellent goljing- and where the young men of the town, 
and many far advanced in life, refort for amulement. For- 
merly there was a filhing-boat wkb a crew which belonged 
to this part of the town, but all the boats at pre fen t belong 
to the Ronheads, the north-eaft part of the town, where the 
filhermen. failors, pilots, and a few Ibipmafters refide 
Here there are 9 boats, which employ about 40 hands; all 
thefe fiQiermen are Hkewifc pilots, and are therefore not la

very-hardy and Intrepid as pilots, go out boldly to meet 
UL in the greateft ftorms, and have the charader of being 
as ready and difcreet as any on the coaft. On the Keith 
Inch, the north part of which is called the Greenhill, there 
are feveral excellent houfes, and fome refpeftable families 
Here, on the fouthermoft part, is an old caftle, built by 
George Earl. Marifchal in the beginning of laft century. 
He was employed at the Court of Denmark on an embaffy, 
and brought over the Princefe of Denmark, who was mar- 
ried to King James VI. It is faid he built this caftle from 
a. model of the palace of the King of Denmark v it has 
been long ufed as a granary and ftorehoufe, and though the 
tvalls-and roof are Handing, is in a ruinous ftate. 

Near this there is a fraall fort, and a guard-houfe, witR 
a battery of four 12, and four i8-pounders, brought here in 
the courfe of the laft war. There were once feven cannon 
placed at the mouth of the two harbours, befides fome brafs 
pieces in the tolbooth, which were all. carried to London 
after the year 17 15. The Keith Inch formerly at ftream- 
tides was entirely feparated from the town, the tide flowing 
from the North to the South Harbour. This is now prcr 
vented by a mound of earth, raifed fo high as never to be 
overflowed by the fea ; onthe nortli Tide of this are placed 
the fleili-houfe,, a. number of fheds for coals,, lime, and tim- 
ber, and a fait manufafture ; on the fouth fide is the ware- 
houfe, two fmall docks or flips for fliip-bmlding, and the 
South Harbour. 

jFIrtrZ'0Kr5.— There are two harbours, the North and thfs 
Somh. The North Harbour is the oldeft. There is a 
pier of very large ftones on the north eaft; fide, without any 
cement, but which feldom needs repairs- v (hips fometimes

than ,t was formerly hy the channel being deepened. There 
are now two excellent piers on the fonth'and weft fides 
the harbofr, and they form with the ^uen^ie, or Keitk 
/..*,o„the eaftfide, acapacions bafon, where at prefer 
above 60 ft.ps may remain in great fafe.y, and with fome 
addxnonal expenee in clearing the channel, and ereai^ 
another pier or quay on the eaft fide, I am informed it mar 
contain about 100 veflels. 

The fouth pier, which fuftains the whole force of the 
German Ocean, (and at fome times, from the waves that 
break over the parapet, the appearance is verj grand and 
tremenduous), is 460 feet in length, 42 feet wide at the 
broadert part, 40 feet high from the foundation of the head 
to the top of the parapet. The weft pier is 633 feet in 
length, the parapet-wall 325 feet; the height at the head 
from the foundation to the top of the parapet-wall is 26 
feet. 

Thej are both of large pieces of granite, fquared and 
neatly dreflTed, and are thought of fufficient ftrength 
and firmnefs (with a little attention) to refift the force of 
the fea : the foot-path and quay is broad and commodious, 
and the workmanfhip on the whole is well executed. 

The two piers, with expences in deepening the harbour, 
have coft the town above L. 5000 Sterling ; of this they 
have received about L. 40CO from Government, the Go- 
vernors of the Merchant Maiden Hofpital, and contribu- 
tions from a few individuals. The depth of water is from 
12 to 14 feet at ftream- tides, and from 8 to 9 feet at neap- 
tides. 

Confiderable

Confiderable improvements may Hill be made on this 
harbour. By carrying the fouth pier farther into the fea, 
fliips of any burden that are employed in trade might find 
ftielter here. Without extending the pier, the channel 
may be deepened two or three feet, and the two harbours 
might be joined into one, by cutting the bridge which di- 
vides the town from the Quenzie. If this was accompliih.- 
ed, it would fave many valuable ftiips from being wrecked, 
which cannot, from llrong wefterly gales, fetch any of the 
friths, or any of the harbours betwixt them, but might 
reach this harbour ; and if the two harbours were united, 
they could go out to fea with any wind, which would re- 
move the great inconvenience to which fliips are fo fre- 
quently fubjefted by being confined in the South Harbour 
from contrary winds. I have feen this harbour full of 
fhips, which were detained for upwards of fix we^ks by 
the wind blowing' from the S. or S. E. 

This improvement has been pointed out to the inhabi- 
tants' by fome engineers, whom they have confulted ; there 
can be no doubt of its being pradicable, and of its utility 
when executed. By an eftimate from Mr John Gwyn, th? 
whole expence for making the two piers already finiflied, 
and uniting the two harbours, was only L. 6891 : 3 : 6 
Sterling ; but were it three times this expence, the advan- 
tages are obvioufly fo immenfely great, that it fliould be 
jittempted, and if once begun, there can be little doubt it 
would be executed. Perhaps it could not be eafily effec- 
tuated by the inhabitants of this town ; but the benefit they 
wpuld receive from this improvement is fo great, that I 
hope fome time foon they will ferioufly think of commen- 
cing it, even if they fliould mortgage the whole of their 
town's funds for that purpofe, or lend fome of their private 
property on the fecurity of the certain advance of revenue 
from the increafed nun^ber of fliips that would enter the

harbour; befides, it would be attended with fuch advan- 
tages to the trade and navigation of this ifland in general, 
that it is to be hoped, on a proper reprefentation, it might 
be accomplillied by a general contribution, or aid from 
Government, or bj obtaining an aft of Parliament for rai- 
ding the fliore-dues. The joining the two harbours was 
part of the original plan when the two new piers were 
erefted. When this work was begun, they had little pro- 
fpedl of receiving fo much money as was afterwards ob- 
tained ; and from what happened then, it gives encourage- 
ment to expeft that money would not be wanting, if fo 
ufeful an improvement was commenced. The Governors 
of'the Merchant Maiden Hofpital are much interefted in 
this plan being carried into effeft; the rife of their rents 
for lands near the town, and the value of feus would be fp 
much increafed, that the advantages accruing to them can- 
not eafily be calculated ; befides the fatisfaaioa of contri- 
buting to make Peterhead the greateft and moft thriving 
town in the north of Scotland. 

It deferves attention likewife, that in time of war, tills 
being a head-land, is ^he place where privateers moft fre- 
quently keep their ftation, and pick up Ihips which might 
find fhelter here, but for want of accefs to a harbour, are 
obliged to beat up againil the wind for feveral days. 

Mineral Well. — A little to the weft of the entrance to 
the South Plarbour is -the mineral well, the virtues of which 
have been known above 20D years. 

It has long been called the Wine Well. Tlie country 
people who refort hither in fummer, and the greateft part 
of the inhabitants of this pariih ftill give it the fame name. 
-Whence itfhould have received this appellation is not eafy 
to fay, nor is it of great importance to determine. Froni

This water has long been defervedly in repute, for ge- 
neral debility, diforders of the ftomach and bowels, flatu- 
lencies and indigeftion, nervous complaints which flow 
from thefe caufes, and difeafes peculiar to the fair fex ; and 
in all thefe diforders, I can from 30 years obfervation and 
■experience affirm, I know of no remedy more efficacious, 
when attention is paid at the fame time to regimen, exer- 
jcife, and amufement, and taking now and then a gentle 
emetic or laxative, as circumftances may require. In moft 
cafes where the mineral water is ufed, the cold bath is pro- 
per, and promotes its good effefts, which are an increafe cf 
appetite, flrength, and fpirits. 

There is no difeafe for which people refort to the well 
more frequently than gravel, though with a confiderable 
degree of hazard, as I have feen numerous inftances of ne- 
phritic paroxyfms brought on by the ufe of the water, and 
where calculi are formed in the kidneys or bladder, this ef- 
feft is naturally to be e^peded. 

The water, as a cleanfer and tonic, may have fome

etfed in preventing the difeafe altogether * ; but after a 
perfon has for forqe time been afflided with it, I think the 
cafe is verj different, and cannot fee fufEcient reafons for 
recommending the water but with the utmoft caution. 
If the water, from the quantity of fixed air, is fuppoftd to 
have a power to diflblve calculous concretions, fixed air 
maj be. given in any quantity, and is frequently recom- 
mended, without any of the Qimulating ingredients whfch 
are found in Peterhead water ; and if it is fuppofed to ope- 
rate as a cleanfer by its diuretic qualities, liquids may be 
given that are lefs irritating. 

Perhaps I may exprefs myfelf ftrongly •, but the fimple 
idea of driving gravel or fmall calcuH through the kidneys, 
ureters, or urethra, with cold iron, has always affeded m^ 
with fome degree of terror, efpecially when we muft be 
ignorant of the quantity of gravel to be difcharged, or the 
fize, fliape, and furface (whether fmooth or rough) of the 
calculi that are to pafs through thefe paflages. 

When a nephritic paroxyfm happens without the ufe of 
any medicine, and is probably an effort of nature from irri- 
tation, to throw off the peccant matter, how careful are we 
avoid every thing which may produce or increafe inflam- 
mation, and to prefcribe the gentleft diuretics, and the 

mildell 

* Perhaps a flcacly ufe of common fpring water, in place of ale or beer, 
might be equally fcrviceable, and lefs dangerous in preventing gravel. 
A gentleman, aged 42, wiih whom I am acquainted, has for thefe lafl 
20 years of his life fcarce fafted any malt liquor, from an apprehenfion of 
gravel, and has confined Iiimfelf to drinking cold w-ater. His grandfather 
and great-grandfather died of tliat diforder; his father was cut for the 
ftone. He himfelf has hitherto kept entirely free fum this complaint. 
From a fedentary life, and fevere ftudy, he has at prefent fome complaints, 
which probably are iinconneifl-ed with gravel ; but being apprehenfive of 
that diforder, he is thinking of trying the Peterhead water, becaufe bis 
fatiier thought he received benefit from it, who, after having tried it for 
near 30 years, was cut for the ftone.

blldeft diluents, to relax and footh, by fomefttations and 
bpiates, rather than irritate by tonics T^XiApviulants. 

The mineral water is fometimcs recommended for a fup- 
preffion of urine. When this proceeds ftora great debility, 
or a paralytic affeftlon of the longitudinal fibres of the bkd- 
der, it may then be fometinies ferviceable ; but when 
there ariy fufpiciofi of inflammation, or when it proceeds 
from fpafm, I ihonld ridt think it lafe to recoiiirhehd the 
water; and conCdering the difficulty of deterrtiiriihg from 
which of thfefe caufes the difo'rder iiiay proceed, the utmoft 
caution is tnore neceflary, 

Dr Laing has recommended it likewife for dvopfy. Of 
the propriety of tbi^ I have great doubts. There are many- 
diuretics prefcribed in that diforder, which are certainly 
tnore efficacious, and when tonics are indicated, they may 
be giveti fn a niore concentrated form; ivhea the difeafe 
proceeds Only from relaxation, perhaps no great danger is 
to be apprehended from ufing the water j but when it pro- 
ceeds, which is frequently the cafe, from obllruftions in the 
iiver, I {hould be afraid to recomtiiend it. I would not 
wiffi to interdidl a droplical perfon, who may hav^e a great 
cKirft, thie ufe of drink ; but perhaps a folution of cream of 
tartar, iri common water, which is gently laxative, diuretic, 
and deobftruent, and which has. been fo ftrongly recom- 
hjcnded by Dr Home in Ris Clinical Ledlures, in dropficai 
bail's, would be more proper for allaying thirft. 

It is really liot poffible preciftly to afcertain what quan- 
tity of the mineral water may be takeri in cafes where it \i 
proper to ufe it freely. 

It is prudent to bifgin with fmall quantities, and increafe 
the dofe as the ftoraach, or the ftrength of the perfon will 
permit. When the appetite is meuded, and the water 
|)a;ires off eafily, the perfon need not be uneafy at thinking 
he has taken too large a quantity. I hr.ve known it drunk 

with 



6^4 Statljlical Atcount 

with fafety to the amount of two Scotch pints in thecouri^ 
ot the day ; though there are not many who can-eafily take^ 
10 large a quantity. 

It is certainly taken, to moft advantage at the fountain^ 
head, or in the roona where the company aifTcmble to drink 
the water ; there are many inftances, however, of people of 
great ilfritability, and who are very weak, beginning to 
drink it in bed in the morning with fuccefs. 

There is frequently a numerous genteel company here, 
drinking the- water during the feafon, which depends very 
much on the weather ; it commonly begins in the month 
of June, and terminates in Auguft or September. 

There are fuch crowds of country people who refort to. 
it in the month of July, that frequently the fpring does not 
afford fo much water as they would drink, and before 6 or 
7 o'clock in the morning, the well is often literally dry. 
The company indeed at that time are not eafily fatisfied,.. 
for many of them drink, from 6 to 8 Scotch pints in the 
day, befides from a mutchkin to a Scotch pint of fea-water» 
and eating laj-ge quantities of dilfe. They cannot be con- 
vinced, that the mineral water ca« be of any fervice to 
their complaints without proving laxative, which is not ita 
ordinary effe£l, and they have generally very fevere exer- 
cife during the time they remain here; they are often 
much reduced in their ftrength before they leave this place 
they frequently alk advice in what manner the water, 
fliould be taken, but with great reludlance follow it, if the 
water has no fenfible eSc&amp;s during their ftaj here. 

They come here indifcrimlnately for all difeafes, without 
taking any previous advice. I have feen many, who were 
in the laft ftage of a confumption, and others who had been 
drinking the mineral water for feveral days in large quan- 
tities, with conftant fever on them, and whom, with difli* 
culty I have perfuaded to return home. 

I They 



of Peterhead. 



' They come in great crouds hither, from the diftance of 
30 or 40 miles ; and in the higher parts of the county, fer- 
Vants frequently make it an article in their agreement with 
their mafters, to have 5 or 6 days of the Wine Well at 
Peterhead, whether they have any complaints or not. 

Many have applied to me for advice. In general they 
fay their complaints are gravelifli ; but, on enquiring more 
minutely, it is flatulency and indigeftion, which is com^ 
monly called a windy gravel: and I believe this is one rea- 
fon why the water is heM in fuch repute for gravelifb 
complaints. When I have reafon to think it is really gra- 
vel, I always advife them to drink the water very mode- 
rately, if I cannat perfuade them to abftain from it alto- 
gether, and moft frequently fend them home, with advice 
to take fuch medicines as appear moft proper for them. 

There are great numbers who refort hither, with cuta- 
acous eruptions, fcrofula, and glandular fwellings ; thefe 
find much more benefit from the fea-water and bathing in 
the fea, than from the mineral water ; but they muft drink 
out of the Wine Well, whatever their diforder may be. 

Dr Laing has recommended the Peterhead water for the 
fcrofula, from its affinity to muriated harytes. I have not 
feen any efFefts from that medicine, which lliould induce 
me t6 give the mineral water a preference to fea-water and, 
bathing in the fea. Indeed, I know no difeafe, in the treats 
ment of which one can fpeak with lefs confidence of the 
effedls of medicine, it is fo fiuftuating in its appearance, and 
the alterations, that appear in the patient, depend fo much 
on the different feafons of the year, peculiarities of age, and 
Gonftitution, that what is merely the efforts of nature, is 
frequently attributed to a medicine, which may be in 
vogue, or may ferve a prefent intercft. 

Great exertions have been made for the accommodation 
of the gecteel company who refort hither on account of 

their

their health, and perfons of every kind may find con- 
venient lodgings. ■ Two cold baths, a room where the com- 
pany may aflemble to drink the water, a large room for 
dancing, a billiard-room, and other accommodations, have 
been built by the fociety of Free Mafons, and are to be 
found in the Keith Lodge, immediately contiguous to the 
well, which was erefted about 30 years ago. They are at 
prefent employed in adding to the lodge an hotel, with a 
large fuite of bed-rooms, for the accommodation of the wa- 
ter-drinkers ; and which, by being feparated from the New 
Inn only by the high-road, and immediately oppofite to 
it, will be found extremely convenient, and, it is hoped, 
agreeable to the company who refort to this place. 

The New Inn was originally built by the late Earl of 
Errol, from a defire to promote the intereft of this town, 
and for the accommodation of the water-drinkers. A great 
number of houfes, where elegant lodgings may be found j 
have been erefted by many of the inhabitants, merely with 
a -view to accommodate ftrangers. There is only wanting 
a warm bath, and a bathing machine on the fea-beach. 

The company deferve every encouragement, as the mo- 
ney left by them in fummer is very confiderable. 

Buildings. — Were a perfon, who had re Tided in Peter- 
head about 30 years ago, to come here for the firft time 
fince that period, he. would be very much furprifed with 
the prefent appearance of the town, both as to its lize, and 
the improvement in the ftyle of building. Several acres 
which were imder the plough, contiguous to the pvincipaf 
Hreet, have been fened, and a;re now decorated with fome 
of the beft ftreets and houfes in town. One acre, which' 
at that period yielded from L. i to L. i, 10 s. Sterling of 
rent, would now produce nearly Lj 150- Sterling for boufe- 
rent. 

thirty 



of Peterhead, 



'Hiirty years ago, peat-ftacks aod dunghills flood on the 
principal ftreets in front of the houfes j thefe nuifances are 
now removed, and it is allowed by ftrangers to be as cleaa 
end neat in its appearance as any town in Scotland. 

The houfes are not magnificent, but they are commo- 
dious aod elegant, and are built of the finell granite, which 
is drefled fo as to have a moft agreeable appearance, and 
remains long without being fullied by the weather. 

Near the head of the principal ftreet, where the tolbooth 
formerly ftood, is an elegant town houf^, 60 feet long and 
40 feet wide, with a fpire, which is no feet from the 
threlbold to the ball ; within the fpire there is an excellent 
bell and a very fine clock. This houfe has coft L. i6oo, 
and before being finilLed, will coft L. 2000 Sterling. 

Water. — There is no foft water in the town. This is 
inconvenient for the purpofes of wafliing, and deprives the 
inhabitants of one great luxury, the pleafure of drinking 
pure fpring water, and this circumftance is peculiarly dif- 
agreeable to ftrangers. 

The water within the town is feldom ufed for tea ; wa- 
ter for that purpofe is brought from a well about 70 yards 
eaftwards from the manfe, where there is a ciftern which 
was formerly open, and where people employed to carry 
the water dipped their ankers very freely, without much 
attention to cleannefs. That nuifance is now removed; 
the ciftern a few years ago was covered ; the water taken 
from this well is not foft, but it is pleafant to the tafte, 
and is fuppo£d to extras the tafte and flavour of tea bet- 
ter than water that is much fofter. It has for time im- 
memorial been called the Tea Well, and many people 
fubfift entirely by carrying water from it to the town. 

The water in the town, and at a fmall diftance from it, 
h found from a long experience to be well calculated for 

making 



6o8 



Statijlical Account 



making beer of a fuperior quality to what is produced frona 
the beft water in other places. This town was once famous 
for having ale of an excellent quality, and it was then to 
be found in moft houfes. Formerly confiderable quantities 
of beer were exported from Peterhead, and they are alive 
in this town, who have feen figns upon taverns in Edin- 
burgh, '* Peterhead beer and ale to be fold." There is 
ftill ale to be found in this town in many private houfes, 
which fupports its forn^er charadler; but at prefent the 
fupply is moftly from a brewery in the neighbourhood, not 
in this parilh, and two fmaller ones in the town, and from 
which the inhabitants frequently get ale of a very good 
quality. It muft appear likewife extraordinary, but from 
whatever caufe it may proceed, nothing is more certain, 
than that the wheaten bread of this town is of a very fuperior 
quality to that in moft other places ; ftc angers, of whom 
there are great numbers here in fummer, all take notice of 
it ; and I have feen many people who have been in moft 
towns on the continent of Europe, who declare they never 
faw better bread in the courfe of their travels. Shall this 
be attributed likewife to the water? or the air of the town? 
Many perfons who have been accuftomed for a ftiort time 
to eat the bread of this town, have fent for it from the di- 
iiaace of upwards of 30 miles. 

Trade and Shipping. -^Thh town has for a long time 
been a place of forae trade ; aid at a diftant period, (hips 
have failed from this to the Baltic, Mediterranean feas, and 
America. From the teftimony of a very refpcftable in- 
habitant, a few days ago, aged 92, who is very diftinftin 
her recolleaion, I am informed, in 1720 there were only 
three Ihips which failed from this place. By the fame 
perfon, though this may not be the proper place to men- 

tioa it, I am informed, that before the year i745» ^^"^ 

potatoe5 



of Peterheadi,

potatoes brought to this town were imported from Ireland 
that in that year fome were brought from Strichen, about 14 
or 15 miles from this place, probably from Lord Strichen's 
farm ; that 60 years ago there were no carts in the town 
or parilh. 

From an anonymous manufcript, which appears to de- 
ferve fome regard, I find there were only fix fhips belong- 
ing to this town in 1727. At prefent there are 26, and 
2 ready to be launched. Some are employed in the fo- 
reign, the greateft part in the coafling trade. The (hips 
are from 40 to 200 tons, and will amount nearly to 3000 
tons dead weight. This is more than double the fliipping 
of Banff, a royal burgh, the metropolis of that county, and 
a town of great opulence. 

It is only of late that the trade of this town has been 
in a proper channel, and any attention bellowed on fifhings 
and manufadures. Much remains ftill to be done ; bat 
from the exertions that have been madcj and ftill continue 
with increafing ardour, it is to be hoped this will foon be 
the moft thriving town in the north of Scotland. 

Formery there was too much connexion with an illicit 
trade from Gottenburgh and Holland, that has now almoft 
ceafed. 

The fifli on this coaft are all caught by boats. I have 
often been furprifed attempts are not made to carry on this 
bufinefs with fliips, as the Dutch filh on this coaft every 
fummer. Ships are fent every feafon ; and I believe, du- 
ring the greateft part of the year from London, who fupply 
the market there with live cod and flat fifh, which they 
catch in the Pentland frith, in that neighbourhood, or on 
this coaft. There are two, fometimes three velfels, fent to 
fifti at Barrahead ; they carry out 16 fifliermen each, and 
tlie average cargoes of each velTel are from 12 to 14 tons of 
dried cod and ling, befides the oil from fun-fifli which they 

Vol. XVL a H catch,

catch, which is fometimes confiderable. The cod-filh 13 
generally fent to the Mediterranean, and for 20 years back- 
wards has been thought a good trade. 

Some years ago there were two veflels fent to Iceland 
from this place to fifh for cod ; but after a trial- for feveral 
years, the trade was dropped. The like number of veflels 
was fent to the herring-filhery, which in general was not 
thought a profitable trade. 

There is one fliip fent to the Greenland fifhing, which, 
raufters 36 men ; fhe has hitherto been rather-unfuccefsful ;.. 
it is hoped, however, the company concerned with the ihip 
will ftill continue the trade, as the fitaation of this place i%- 
certainly favourable for an enterprife of this kind. 

The principal attention at prefent is bellowed on manu- 
fadlures, in which many different companies are concerned.* 
This was introduced only in 1764, by two young ladies of 
the name of Park, who began the manufafture of white 
threads on a fmall fcale ; and when it was commenced, 
there was no yarn could be fpun in the town above four 
hanks. The fpinfters were foon brought to fpin from eight 
to ten hanks. The Mifs Parks were fo attentive to the bu- 
linefs, and fo honeft: in their dealings, that their threads 
were as much efteemed as any in the kingdom. They ex- 
tended their bleachfield, and were always certain of a ready 
fale for any quantity they manufadlured. They have re- 
tired a few years ago from bufinefs. 

There are now in thefparifla and neighbourhood, witli 
which the merchants here are connefted, five bleachfields, 
where threads of an excellent quality are manufadlured. 

A woollen-cloth manufafture has been eftablifhed for a 
confiderable time, and another for cotton for feveral years. 

A fait manufafture has lately been eftabliibed here j likc- 
wife a nail and tin raanufa£lure, both in their infancy, but

-will probably foon increafe, as there is a greater demand 
for thefe articles than the company can find hands to fur- 
niih. 

A few years ago there was a diftillery for whilky, which 
was permitted to be reftified ; there was a very good imi- 
tation of gin, brandy, cinnamon water, and other foreign 
fpirits. The whifky and cinnamon water were excellent. 
The late ad of Parliament put a flop to this diftillery. A 
few months ago it was in contemplation to make bricks 
and tiles ; the clay on th€ piece of ground pitched upon 
for that purpofe was not of fufiicient depth. This mauu- 
fafture is much wanted, and probably will foon take place 
in fome other part of the parifh. A tannery is inftantly 
to be eftablifhed. 

The town is excellently fupplied with tradefmen of all 
kinds, particularly wrights and mafons, many of whom 
are not only fit to perform the operative part of their bufi- 
neis, but qualified to give and execute plans of houfes, and 
are employed for that purpofe, not only in the town, but 
in many places in the country at a confiderable diftance. 

All kinds of houfehold-furniture are made in the neateft 
and moft fubftantial manner. There is one turner, who 
employs two or three hands befides himfelf ; he is a very 
ingenious yoHang man, and turns a variety of articles fo 
neatly, that his fliop is reforted to by moft ftrangers who 
frequent this town, and his goods are commiflioned from 
many places at a diftance. 

There is frequent intercourfe betwixt this place and Nor- 
way and the Baltic. The coal-trade is carried on pretty 
brifkly. A great quantity of goods is imported from Lon- 
don, fuch as porter, hops, flour, fugar, tea, fruit, fpiceries, 
i^c. which not only fupply the town, but a large diftridt 
of country.— A great part of this trade formerly be- 
longed to Fraferhurgh, a fmall town about miles from 

jchis,

this, at the entrance of the Moray frith it has now taken 
a different channel, and confiderable quantities of goods are 
tranfported by carriers to Fraferburgh, and the neighbour- 
hood of that town. 

The trade with London is moftly carried on by fhips be- 
longing to a company at Banff, who have a few fhips con- 
ftantly employed in bringing goods from London to Peter- 
head, Fraferburgh, and Banff. There is generally one of 
thefe traders here every two or three weeks. I am glad to 
find the merchants in this town are to employ their own 
fliips in this trade. There is a very great value of eggs, 
butter, cheefe, fometimes of beef and pork, exported from 
this port to London. 

A great quantity of viftual is exported from this har- 
bour, and purchafed moflly by merchants in this place, 
partly on commifljon, and partly on fpeculation. 

There are many articles from the Carron Company 
brought hither \ likewife from the manufaduring towns of 
Manchefler, Leeds, Sheffield, and Birmingham. Goods to 
a confiderable amount are imported from Sunderland, 
Newcaitle, Hull, Leith, Glafgow, Aberdeen, 'iSc. ; and 
by a lift I have feen from the waiter of the principal 
Inn here, I find the number of riders and merchants on 
bufinefs, who lodged there from the i6th of May 1793 to 
the i6th of May 1794, was 153. A ftate of the trade 
and manufaflures in this town will be befl known, by ex- 
hibiting as accurate an account of the imports and exports 
3s can be obtained.

Prior to 1792, there was an annual importation of iron 
from Sweden of about 30 tons ; fince that time it has been 
brought coaftways from Leith and Aberdeen, and the quan- 
tity is fuppofed nearly the fame. 

Tiles, bricks, and flates are imported, fuppofed to the va- 
lue of L. 600 Sterling each year. 

From the variety of packages, and incorreft manner of 
clearing out bale goods at the Cuftomhoufe, it is impoffible 
to afcertain the quantity of goods under that denomination ; 
but from Leeds, Manchefter, Birmingham, Carron, Glaf- 
gow, 13 c. they may be eftimated at L. 6000 Sterling an- 
nually. The grofs amount in value of goods brought hither 
from London, in groceries, teas, hops, flour, grafs-feeds, 
porter, and many other neceffaries and luxuries of life for 
thefe three laft years, is fuppofed to be L. 12,000 each 
year. 

It is fuppofed there is not lefs than 9000 lb. of tea im- 
ported. 

From 20 to 24 pipes of red Port and white wine are im- 
ported by way of Leith •, 22 pipes, at L. 50 Sterling each

From 10 to 12 puncheons of rum, bought at Leith, Glaf-

L. 600 Sterling. The value for any other fort of foreign 
ipints IS not confiderable, excepting what is fmugded, 
"Which is not known. 

The quantity of Britiflx fpirits fold here is from 4000 to 
5000 gallons; at4s./.r gallon, L. 900 Sterling; this in- 
cludes whilky, and all forts of Britifh made fpirits. 

From 806 to 900 kegs of fpruce beer are imported from 
Bant%ick; alfo a confiderable quantity of afhes, honey, 
ropes, ISc. fuppofed to be L. 1500 Sterling. 

From L. 200 to L. 300 Sterling value in clover and flax- 
feed has been annually imported from Rotterdam for fome 
years paft. 

Exports. — I have formerly mentioned, that there are 
about JO tons of kelp made on the fliores of this pariOi ; 
from 400 to 600 barrels of cod caught here, faked, and fgnt 
to the London market ; from 20 to 30 tons of dried cod 
and ling, caught at the Hebrides, exported from this place, 
and generally fent to Barcelona; about 400 barrels caught 
in the Highlands, are annually exported from this harbour. 
About 50 barrels of falted falmon caught in the Ugie muft 
be included in the exports. About 1000 bolls of potatoes 
raifed in the pariflh, and moflly on the lands adjacent to the 
town, are fent each year either to Norway or EnglamL 
From 600 to 8co tons of kerb and carriage-way ftones are 
annually fent to London, Lynn, and other places, and are 
generally fold here at 13 s. per ton.

For two or three years pall, from 130 to 140 tons of 
Butter are annually fliipped at the port of Peterhead, which 
is all made and cured within the fpace of from 15 to 18 
miles in the vicinity of the town of Peterhead. This is now 
moftly fent to the London market ; formerly all the butter 
from this corner was fent to the different ports in the frith 
of Forth ; part is Itill fent thither. For fome years paft the 
butter has fold from L. 56 to L. 60 Sterling ^^^r ton ; on an

1^0 to 180 tons cheefe are annually fhipped ; they all go 
to the different ports fouth from Aberdeen to Berwick, and 
fell from L. 17 to L. 20 Sterling per ton. On an average, 
17.0 tons, at L. 18, 10 s. will be L. 3.145 Sterling*. Of

purports more than one half of what is ftateil in the eftlmate.

late years a good deal of beef and pork has been fent to the 
London market, and anfwers very well. 

About 60 boxes of eggs, each box containing 150 dozen, 
and fuppofed to be worth at London L. 400 Sterling in all, 
exported annually from this town. 

ManufaEiures. — There are 5 2 twift- mills in the town of Pe- 
terhead, employing conftantly 334 people in doubling, twill- 
ing, and making up threads, and will manufafture 104,000 
fpindles of yarn ; this will employ 800 fpinners, who will 
earn 2 s. 6 d. per week each. The greateft part of thefe 
threads are bleached, and made from Dutch flax, a conflde- 
rable quahtity of the yarns are bought at Banff, Huntly, 
Keith, \Sc. The threads are fent to the London market ; 
and when manufadlured, will fell for about L. 20,000 Ster- 
ling. Women-fervants employed in doubling, wiU earn 
from 2 s. 6 d. to 4 s. per week ; men fervants employed in 
heckling, twilling, \^c. will earn from 5 s. to 8 s. per 
•week. 

The perfons concerned in this trade are as follow : 

J. Arbuthnot, Scott, &amp; Co. 18 mills, employing 117 fervants, &amp; 36,000 fpind. 
J. Burd &amp; Co. - 15 ditto, ditto 99 ditto, &amp; 30,000

This manufa^Elure is rapidly incfeafing, and one company 
is inftantly going to add fix twift-mills to thofe aheady 
employed. The cotton-cloth manufafture lately eftablifted 
by Meffrs J. Arbuthnot, Grant, and Company, employs 
30 weavers. This company fpins their own cotton upon 
four jehnys ; their goods, when manufaftured into cheques,

Sterling annually. The woollen-cloth .manufadure carried 
on by the Meffrs Arbuthnots, Dalgarno, and Company 
employs fix weavers, and one fpinning jenny for.; clothing, 
or big wheel yarn. Their cloth confifts Jluffs, fey s, f ur- 
ges, mankies, duffles, and it is thought will fell for about 
L. 1800 Sterling per annum. 

The Meffrs Kilgours atKinmimdie, in theparilh of Long- 
fide, employ in this town and parifli 16 women fpinners, 
and 6 weavers, whofe work will amount, when manufac- 
tured, to L. 6qo Sterling each year. 

They bring their wool from Norihumherland, and chiefly 
fleece-wool. All the fervants employed in the above ma- 
nufaftures are fuppofed to be conftantly employed ; but as 
many of them have families, and others work to private 
cuftomers, there is at leaft one-third more engaged in the 
different branches of manufafture than ftated in the above 
account. 

Meffrs, Gordon, Baron, and Company at Aberdeen, em-

the courfe of a year, it is fuppofed will amount to L. 1206 
bterling. 

It is but fair to mention, that feveral gentlemen in this 
town have connexions in trade, that cannot be faid to be- 
long properly to this place, particularly Meffrs James and 
Thomas Arbuthnots, who are concerned in the manufac- 
ture of kelp, and in the falmon-fifhing, to a very large ex- 
tent in different parts of the kingdom and are likewife 
concerned as fhip-owners; and the Meffrs Huchinfons, and 
other merchants, who employ a number of fliips, their own 
property, of great value, in carrying goods to merchants in 
different places, fome at a very remote idiftance ; befides 
fome others, that have confiderable tranfaftions, that cannot

* The Meffrs Arbuthnots were early promoters of the fifliings and ma- 
nufactures in this place, and are ftill connected with them ; they are 
likewife tackfmen of the falrnon-fifliing on Ugie. The Meffrs Hutchin- 
ibns are likewife connected with the fifhings, and other branches of trade, 
belonging to this town. It is to be regretted that the fifliings have not been 
extended farther. The lobfter-fifliing, from Peterhead to the Pentland 
fnth, is an objedi- of confiderable importance, and has been in the hands 
of Englifli merchants for thefe laft 30 years. The fifliers in the town of 
Peterhead are fo well acquainted with the method of taking them, that 
many of them are employed in different parts of the Moray frith by agents 
fettled in Peterhead by different companies in England. There are vaft 
varieties of flat fifli on this coaft, or at no great diftance from this place, 
which might be caught with a trail net, which has never been attempted. 
Herrings are frequently on the coaft, but a boat or fliip never was fent in 
fearch of them. The Dutch catch them every fummer, as well as cod. 
Ships pafs every week from the Pentland frith with live cod, and flat fidi, 
for the London market. Great quantities of large ling and cod might be 
caught here, and dried on the rocks, beHdes what are taken by the fifliers 
of Boddom in boats. 

There is ftill room for improvements in the manner of catching fifli.. 
In the Mediterranean, lifli are caught in nets with flambeaux in the night 
time. In the rivers in Scotland it has long been a pradlice to kill, 
falmon and trouts with lighted torches in the darknefs of the night. It 
has 'often been fuggefled to make Jtrial or tliis raethcnl with falmon at 
fea, but it has never been attempted.

properly be placed to the trade of this place, particularly- 
one of the name of Findlater, who deals very extenfively, 
both in the foreign and domeftic trade ; two years ago tra- 
velled "froni Peterfburgh to Mofcow, and this year intends 
being at Conjlantmoph. 

Fairs. — In the town there is a weekly market on Fri- 
day ; and two^nnual fairs, one in the month of May, and 
the other in November. 

Taverns^— ThtvQ are 30 taverns in the parifli, all in the 
town, excepting two in the country part of the parifh, and 
thefe are in the fea-town of Boddonu 

Shops. — There are about 35 flxops in the town ; of thefe, 
there are 20 dealers in tea, and 18 dealers in fpirits. 

Flejh-market. — Prior to 1792, in the flefli-market 250 
oxen and cows were killed each year, 600 fiieep, and 60 
fwine, befides calves, which were numerous. For thefe 
laft two years there is above one-fourth of an increafe in 
thefe different articles ; but the precife number of each can- 
not be afcertained. 

Excife and CuJIoths. — The duties for excife for ale and 
malt laft year were L. 273 Sterling. Duties on licenfes for. 
fpirits, teas, tobacco, wine, l^c. were L. 176 Sterling. 
From the 5th of January 1792 to the 5th of January 1793, 
the amount of the duties on cuftoms paid for goods im- 
ported from foreign parts was L. 557 : 5 : 9 Sterling. 

Poji-office. — There is a poft-ofRce here, which -remitted 
to the General Poll-office laft year of poftages, free of all 
e;cpences, L. 280 Sterling; G years ago £,119, and 12

years ago L. 60 Sterling. There are at prefent 6 poHs ; in 
a few days there will be 7 polls, or runners, every week. 

Bank Agents — There are two agents in this town for 
the two banks at Aberdeen ; and belides what tranfa£tions 
may be made for other banks, it is fuppofed thefe two 
agents do bufinefs, in the courfe of one year, to the extent 
at leaft of L. 120,000 Sterling ; and I am glad to find the 
credit of this place is much refpefted, not only from its opu- 
lence, but the fairnefs of the tranfadlions of the inhabitants. 
A bankruptcy is a very rare occurrence in this town •, and 
when it does happen, the lofs fuflained by creditors is not 
very confiderable.

eggs were at i d. each dozen, they are now from 4 d. to

at any price, from the brifk demand for the London mar- 
ket. Forty years ago, from the ift of December to the 
middle of March, no frefli beef was to be found, and there 
was no regular market. At that time beef was fold from 
10 d. to I s. 2 d. Scotch per lb. ; beef now cofts from 3 d. 
to 44 d. Sterling each lb. Thirty years ago, veal was ne- 
ver fed ; and when expofed to fale, was purchafed at 6 d. 
each quarter ; it is now excellently fed, and fells from 3 d. 
to 5 d. each lb. ; lamb at the fame price, fometimes 6d. 
From 1760 to 1753 mutton was fold by the quarter; a 
butcher then began to fell it by weight at if d. per lb. 
The inhabitants were much difpleafed at him for this in- 
novation, and raifing the price. Mutton now felJs from 
1^ d. to 3 d. and fometimes 4 d. each lb. In 1753, butter 
fold at 2-jd. each lb. it now fells from 6d\ to 8 d. Hens 
30 years ago were fold from 4 d. to 5 d. each ; they now 
fell from 8 d. to 10 d. : chickens were i d. ; they are now 
from 2 d. to 3 d. each. Haddocks were id. each dozen, 
and fometimes only that price each fcore ; 'they frequently 
now coft I d. each, and if large, a higher price. Lobfters 
were frequently purchafed formerly for i d. each ; they are 
now from 2 d. to 4 d. Sucking pigs, 20 or 30 years ago,

Review

Statijlical Account 



Remew of Population.— T\,oyx^ the population of the 
panfli has already been mentioned, it maj not be improper 
to ftate the population of the town of Peterhead, and the 
value of property at different periods. 

In I593» there were only 14 feus, allowing to each fa- 
mily 4, this makes the number of inhabitants at that time 
56. From an anonymous manufcript, I find in 1727 there 
was fuppofed to be in the town about 230 families, which, 
fuppofing it to be accurate, would make the inhabitants to 
be at that time about 900. In 1764, they were 1266; in 
1769, they were 1518 ; in 1790, they were 2550 ; and at 
prefent they are fuppofed to be about 3000. Dr Laing 
eftimates them in 1764 at 1500 ; but this is a millake, as 
that year I vifited every family in my parifli, and I am 
confident no lifl was taken that year, or in 1769, excepting 
by myfelf. The lift in 1790 was taken by the managers 
of the town, at which I was not prefent : of the accuracy 
of it, however, I have no doubt. From this ftatement 
it will appear how rapidly this town has increafed in po- 
pulation thefe laft 30 years. In a few years, probably lefi 
than 40 years from the time I took the firft lift, I make no 
doubt the number of inhabitants will be trebled. 

Value of Feus at different Periods. — The value of the feus 
and property in the town has ^increafed very much ; in 
1593, from confidering the charter, each acre appears to 
have coft about L. 50 Sterling. Since the Governors of 
the Merchant Maiden Hofpital became proprietors, they 
have feued off land at the rate of 16 s. per fall, and i d. 
of feu-duty for every foot of front, or at L. 128 Sterling 
per acre. Now they have refolved to fell none under L. i, 
ios./(?r fall, or at the rate of L. 240 /»fracre; with id. 
for every foot of front as feu-duty. There are many in- 
llances, hov!\iever, of much higher prices being paid in Pe- 
terhead ;

4erhead; lately 3-4ths of an acre were purchafed for L. 90, 
and in two years afterwards were fold for L. 200 Sterling. 
A fite for a houfe, confifting only of five falls and five ells, 
fold for L. 37 Sterling a few months ago ; that is, nearly at 
the rate of L. 1150 per acre. About 20 years ago, the 
Governors alked L. 150 for one acre; a gentleman only 
offered L. 1451; on this acre houfes to a great value are now 
ereded •, but were there no houfes, it would probably fetch 
eight times the money that was formerly aflied for it. An- 
other acre, about 30 years ago, was purchafed for L. lao, 
one fourth part of which would at prefent fetch from L. 400 
to L. 500 Sterling. There are fome particular fituations, 
where L. 100 would be obtained for a fite for a houfe, with 
very little back ground. 

Within thefe few years more houfes have been built 
than at any former period in the fame fpace of time^ lately 
four new ftreets were opened, on which a number of houfes 
are already built, and feus daily giving off. Within thefe 
laft two years, in the courfe of I2 months, I am informed 
L. 4000 Sterling have been expended on building houfes. 

CharaEier. — The inhabitants are in general very atten- 
tive, very induftrious, fober, difcreet, and humane. They 
are very regular in their attendance on public worfliip, and 
thefe good qualities may in general be applied to the whole 
of the parilli. 

Style of Limtig. — The ftyle of living is much changed of 
late ; but the inhabitants, for the moft part, are economi- 
cal, and live within their income. Luxuries of life are now 
more frequent than formerly, both in drefs and entertain-' 
jnents i but, on the whole, there is lefs of diflipation, extra- 
vagance, and drunkennefs, than in any town of the fame lize 
and opulence with which I am acquainted.

Among the lower claffes dram and tea- drinking is too 
frequent, and the too general fubftitution of fpirits in place 
of malt liquor has a pernicious influence on their health and 
morals. 

When I was fettled in 1763, there was no poft-chaife ; 
there are at prefect two in the town, which are fufficient 
in winter, but in furtimer they cannot fupplj the demand 
for chaifes from the inhabitants and company who refort 
hither. Thirty years ago, as far as I can recoiled, there 
■was no clothier's fliop ; the inhabitants in general were fa- 
tisfied with cloth manufa£lured at home, or goods retailed 
here from Glafgow, or commiffioning cloth from Aber- 
deen. There are at prefent three clothiers fliops, who 
have all kinds of cloth from the difierent manufafturing 
towns in England, befides fuch goods as are made at Paif- 
ley and Glafgow. There are two Ihops who fell only goods 
from thefe two manufa(fl:uring towns j frequently different 
people find it their intereft to bring goods from thefe pla- 
ces, and refide in this town till they are fold. 

Hhits of Improvement. — In a word, the town of Peter- 
head is in a very thriving ftate, and would be much more 
improved if there was a Jirm and Jleady police^ fome nui- 
fances removed, greater exertions made to improve the 
harbour, foft fpring-water brought into the town, which 
might be found at no great diftance, the ftreets better pa- 
ved, and illuminated with lamps in winter ; it would like- 
wife contribute much to the ornament of the town, if fome 
regular plan could be adopted as to the fize of the houfes 
in the new ftreets that are lately opened.— There is no 
greater defefl: than the ivant of a proper fchoolmiftrefs of 
cduc:uion, manners, and charafter, to teach the young girls 
liich branches of education as are only to be found in lar- 
ger towns at a very high expcnce.

I fliaU only add, th^t if more liberal ideas were enter- 
tained of the education of children, it would make a fa- 
vourable alteration on the manners and fentiments of the 
inhabitants, and gradually introduce a more general defire 
for the improvement of the mind and the heart.

From the above abflraft it appears, that the trade of this

pofed to be left by the company who attend the mineral 
well, and the amount of the trade carried on by merchants 
refiding in the town, but which cannot properly be faid to 
belong to this port, by which I do not mean any illicit 
trade, I have no doubt the trade of the town of Peterhead 
would be found to exceed L. ico,coo Sterling each year. 

P. S. Upon revlfing this abftraft fevcral weeks after it 
was finifbed, I am feniible fome deduiSVions will be made, 
as the Meffrs Kilgours do not refide in this town, and part 
of the vidlual, butter, and cheefe are exported by mer- 
chants, who have their refidence elfewhere ; but having 
likewife difcovered, that no mention is made of cart-

lue fet upon the carts, cart-wheels, ploughs, labouring 
utenfils, and houfehold-furniture, fent to the country, which 
IS very confiderable, and that no ftatement is made of the 
freights drawn for fhips employed in trade not connefted 
with this port, I am very confident I have no reafon to 
make the amount of the trade lefs than I have reprefented 
It; and if I were to make any alterations, it would be 
only to ihow, that the trade probably is confiderably above 
L. 100,000.

Name, Situation, and Extent. 

^T^HIS parifh at different times has been named St Colm, 
from the name of the faint to whom the old church 
was dedicated, and Longmay, Longmey, and Lonmay, from 
the name of the eftate on which the church now Hands. 

It is lituated in the prefbytery of Deer, and in the Synod 
and county of Aberdeen. Its length is 10 Englilh miles ; 
its greatcft breadth fcarccly four miles. It is bounded on 
the S. E. by Crimond ; on the S. by Longfide and Old 
Deer ; on the S. W. by Brechin ; on the W. and N. E. by 
Kathen ; and on the E. by the German Ocean.

Statijiical Account 



Soil and Climate. — The foil of the parifh is various. The 
air, efpecially on the coaft, is rather moift, but not un. 
healthy. 

Mineral Springs. — There are many mineral fprlngs in 
the parifti, but they have never been analyzed ; and from 
the celebrity of the mineral well of Peterhead, at 12 miles 
diftance, they are little ufed. 

Lake. — There is only one lake, lying on the boundary 
betwixt the pari flies of Lonmay arid Crimond. It is now 
called the loch of Strathbeg. It was formerly a fmall rivu- 
let, called indifferently the burn of Strathbeg, and water of 
Rattray. Buchanan calls it Ratra afnnis. By a ftorm the 
mouth of it was fliut up, and fucceffive banks of faud have 
been thrown up by the fea, and the rivulet- has, in the 
courfe of a little more than a century, become a lake of 
550 Scotch, or 700 Englifli acres. For feveral years paft 
it has not increafed in magnitude ; the evaporation from 
the furface being equal to the quantity of water emptied 
into the lake. "Were a perfon to meafure with tole- 
rable accuracy the quantity of water which runs into 
this lake, it would poffibly afford data for jiroving, that 
the evaporation from the Cafpian Sea is fnfficient to 
counterbalance all the water poured in from the rivers 
which empty themfelves into it. An' attempt has been 
lately made to drain the lake of Strathbeg; but the 
perfon who made the attempt failed in his circumflances, 
which has fufpended the work. It is faid, however, that 
he is foon to refume it. His reward is a long leafe of the 
grounds covered by the lake. The fiilies contained in this 
lake are, red and white trout, eels, flounders, and large frefli 
water mufcles, commonly called pearl mufcles. No pearls,

however, have been found in the mufcles taken out of this 
lake. 

The foil in the bottom of this lake is not deep, but is 
feemingly of a marly nature, owing, perhaps, to mufcle- 
Itiells decayed. 

Rivers, Is'c. — ^No navigable rivers run through the pa- 
tifti, but a confiderable ftream, one of the branches of the 
Ugie, runs by the north and fouth-eaft boundaries. A ca- 
nal could be carried along both branches of the Ugie at no 
great expence, and with the moll beneficial cbrifequences 
to the agriculture and commerce of Buchan. 

This parifh has above four miles of coaft, and the Ihore 
is flat and fandy. The fpecies of fifli caught on this coaft 
are turbot, holibut, plaice, Ikate, ling, cod, fand-eel, had- 
dock, whiting, cole-fiih, flounders, foles, and mackaral. 
Sometimes, but rarely, fea-bream, wrafle, and dorce. Her- 
ring alfo are found, but there are no herring-nets. One 
trial was made of fifliing for falmon, and was tolerably 
fuccefsful. 

Sea- wreck of feveral kinds is found on the coaft j and 
kelp is made, but in fraall quantities. 

There are two filhing-towns belonging to Mr Gordon of 
Buthlaw. One of thefe was lately built, and confifts of 20 
tiled houfes, placed in two parallel rows, with a ftreet in 
the middle. 

Mqfcs. -There are feveral extenfive raofTes in this pa- 
ri Qi. A large one belongs to Mr Milne of Crimond-mo- 
: gate, another to Mr Gumming of Kinithmont. The 
other heritors, Mr Duff of Logic, fon of the late Admiral 
Duff, Mr Bifl-et of Rathon, and Mr Frafer of Park, have 
alfo mofTes, which abound in the whole diftrift of Buchan.

M'/z^raA.— No marble, freeftone, or flate, and not much 
moorftone, are found in this parifti. But a blue Hone has 
been quarried on the eftate of Cairnefs, belonging to Mr 
Gordon of Buthlaw. This, contrary to the nature of the 
blue ftone commonly found in Aberdeenfhire, cuts as well 
as granite, and makes beautiful afliler work. Of this ftone, 
Mr Gordon has lately built an elegant modern houfe, on a 
plan given by Mr Playfair. 

No coal mines are found in this parifli ; but linif.ftone is 
found in great quantities on the eftate of Craigellie, about 
2 Englilh miles from the church, and is much ufed for ma., 
nure. 

^adrupeds. — The quadrupeds found in this pariih, be- 
lides horfes, fheep, hogs, black cattle, dogs, and cats, are 
moles in great numbers, foxes feen fometimes, otters in the 
lake of Strathbeg, obferved but feldom, polecats, weafels, 
common and Ihrew-mice, hares, rats, and water-rats. 

Birds. — The birds and wild fowls are of various kinds ; 
jack-daws, magpies, the cuckoo, fwans, and wild-geefe, (in 
Strathbeg after harveft, and till the fpring), barnacles fhot 
on the coaft, duck in Strathbeg at all feafons, teals on the 
coaft, foland-geefe paffing in fight of land, common gull, 
and great black and white gull, tarrock, heron, curlieu, 
woodcock, fnipe, jack-fnipe, lapwing, (not fo numerous as 
formerly), fand-pipers, green plover, coots, land-rail, grous 
in the mofles, partridges, quails, Iky-lark, ftarlings, field- 
fare, generally appearing before fnow, thrufh, blackbird, 
chatterers, croffbill, feen but rarely, greenfinehe?, gold- 
linches, chafHnches, yellow hammers, red fparrows, hedge 
fparrows, redbreafts, water-wagtails, fwifts, fwallovvs, and 
white-ears.

Pop7ilation. — The return to Dr Webft^r in 1755 was 
1674 fouls. The number of inhabitants of all ages at pre- 
fent is about 1650. Of which, 311 are Scotch Epifcopals, 
and 17 are Seceders. If we may judge from the fituation 
of the church of St Colm, (of which part of the weft glebe 
ftill remains, and which ftood on the north-eaft part of the 
parifli, 10 miles frona the fouth by weft extremity), popu- 
lation has formerly been very thin in this parifli, except on 
the fea-coaft. 

Agriculture. — The agriculture of this diftrift, though 
certainly improved of late years by the introdu£lion of 
lime and green crops, has not advanced fo much as might 
have been expefted. One great error of the Buchan far- 
mers, which is apt to ftrike even a ftranger riding through 
the country, is the ploughing too feldom. In deep clay 
foils, where, in the county of Angus, three ploughings are 
always ufed, beans are frequently fown broadcaft after one 
ploughing, and bear after beans in the fame manner. Yet 
a very good crop of drilled beans is to be feen this year 
(1795) upon a farm in the perfonal poffelGon of one of the 
heritors. It is alfo to be remarked, that a rotation of crops 
is not yet eftabliftied in this diftria. While the heritor 
only ploughs where he cannot get grafs to grow any longer, 
the tenant fometimes ploughs as long as corn of any kincj 
will grow. A regular rotation of crops, adapted to the dif- 
ferent foils, is too little attended to in this diftrift ; and now 
that lime is very generally ufed, the lands may fufFer from 
injudicious cropping. 

Rent of the P«r/.— The rent of this parifli is about 
2000 guineas •, and may be fuppofed to increafe with the 
improvements in agriculture.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4819450">PREMNAY</name>



(County and Synod of Aberdeen, Presbytery of 

Garioch.) 



By a Friend to Statijlical Inquiries.</head>

<p>

Origiji of the 'Name., i^c. 

PREMNAY is fituated in the county and Synod of 
Aberdeen, and in the diftrift and prefbjtery of Ga- 
rioch. Its name is derived from the Gaelic. It is bound- 
ed on the S. by the mountain of Bennochie, which feparates 
it from the parifh of Keig ; on the W. by the parifli of 
Leflie ; on the N. by Kinnethmont and Infch ; and on the 
E. by the pax-ifli of Oyne. 

Extent. — Premnay, exclufive of the uncultivated and un- 
inhabited part of it on Bennochie, is a long flripe of land, 
lying along the water of Gady, (which runs through it), 
and is about four miles long by one and an half miles broad. 
It contains nearly 3000 acres, (exclufive of the mountain of 
^cnnochie), about 2000 of which has been made arable, and 
^ nearly 



Statijlical Account 

nearly looo of it limed, inclofed, and planted with hedge- 
rows on one eftate. 

Soil-.T\it foil is various. On the banks of the Gady 
in general, it is very rich ; on the fide of the mountain of 
Bennochie it is much poorer. In feveral places a ftrong 
■clay ; and on fome fmall knolls or hills on the north fide of 
Gady, a fandy loam, which in fome places is lliallow, and 
eafily hurt in dry feafons, but is in general both early and 
fertile. 



Mou7itain.~T\iQ mountain of Bennochie is one of the 
largeft in the county of Aberdeen. It is nearly looo feet 
above the level of the fea, and about 750 feet above the 
level of the water of Gady, oppofite to the church of Prem- 
nay, and its bafe may cover an area of about 4000 acres, 
the greateft part of which is unarable. The name Ben' 
nochie is faid to fignify. Hill with the paps, from its having 
feveral tops. It is a royal foreft, though no trees are now 
raifed, excepting a few on the Ikirts of the mountain. It 
appears from the Latirus Lejlceana, that it was formerly 
fortified ; and the remains of a ftone wall are Hill fianding 
near its higheft top. It fupplies the inhabitants of the 
neighbouring parifl:ies with peats for fuel ; but in rainy fea- 
fons it is very difficult of accefs. It contains ftones of very 
fine granite, which are much efteemed, and carried feveral 
miles. 

River. — The fmall rivulet Gady, produces very good 
trout, but no falmon. It is ufeful in turning different corn- 
mills in this and the neighbouring parifiies. 



Manure. — The only manure, except the dung raifed on 
tlie farms, is lime brought from Aberdeen, a diflance of

24 miles. But if the projefled canal were carried to Infch, ' 
it would be eafily within the reach of the farmers of this 
parifti. 

Agriculture. — About 24 years ago the greateft part of 
this parifh was uninclofed and unimproved. But at that 
period, Mr Gordon, late proprietor of the principal eftate, 
began to improve his lands on a great fcale. Carts 
from Aberdeen, loaded with lime, were hired to Inverury, 
a diftance of 14 miles, and Mr Gordon's own horfes and 
oxen went to Inverury, and brought the lime from that 
town to Premnay. The fields were inclofed and planted 
with hedge-rows, and in general were thoroughly limed. 
Proper farm-houfes, and other neceffary buildings were 
efefted ; and the lands, after being feveral years in the pro- 
prietor's own hands, were let to different farmers. The 
eftate has fince been fold at 60 years purchafe of the old 
rent, before the improvements commenced. Yet the ex- 
pence of improving the lands at fuch a diftance from a fea- 
port, has hurt the fortune of the intelligent and public fpi- 
rited gentleman who improved them. It may here be re- 
marked, that it is more prudent for a landed gentleman to 
improve one farm, and then let it, and afterwards to im- 
prove the other farms in fucceflion, than to attempt im- 
proving the whole at once. Labourers cannot eafily be 
had ; the price of labour is fuddenly raifed ; the difficulty 
of hoeing large quantities of turnips, of cutting down 
and flacking large quantities of hay, and of har verting 
large quantities of grain in rainy, or in late feafons, be- 
comes very great, efpecially where many of the labourers 
mufl travel two or three miles to and from their work ; 
and a gentleman improves at a greater expence than what 
is incurred by a common farmer,. who is his own overfeef. 

Befides, 



^4^ Statijlical Account 

Befides, as the market price of every commodity is regu- 
lated by the proportion between thofe who buy and thofe 
who fell, when his improvements are finiflied, a gentle- 
man, who has his whole ejlate in the market at once, cannot 
expedl the fame rent for it, as if he let every other year a 
newly improved farm to a pradical farmer. Perhaps the 
moft advantageous way in which an eftate can be impro- 
ved, is to give the farmer encouragement, and even affift- 
ance to improve it. For example, if the neceffary quan- 
tity of lime cannot be afforded by the farmer, the proprie- 
tor may give as much lime as is wanted, and alk for his 
payment a gradual increafe of rent. The writer of this 
article knew a gentleman who raifed his rents from 15 s. to 
L. 2 an acre in this manner. He gave his farmers 50 bolls 
of lime to each acre. This coft him at that time about 
L. 5, 5 s. In three years the additional rife of rent indem- 
mfied him j and yet his farmers paid their rents regularly; 
and one of them received L. 11 from his landlord, or the 
rent of 5! acres, for two acres of fown grajfe. The only 
difficulty here is to find tenants in whom one can con- 
fide. 

Population. — The population of this parifh has fluctuated 
very much. In Dr Webfter's account it was 448. About 
14 years ago it was as low as 260, after the old farmers 
were removed. Three years ago it was 471 examinable 
perfons, or about 550 of all ages ; and at prefent it is only 
about 450. 

ManufaBiires, — Small quantities of Knt are raifed for 
private families ; but the knitting of {lockings is the only 
manufadlure of any confequence. 



Proprietors, 



of Prem?iay.

- FroprietorSf is'c. — Of thefe there are four, but none of 

1 

them at prefent refide in the parifli. The rent of the pa- 
riiOi amounts nearly to L. looo. 

• Kcclejiajlical State — Mr James Douglas is the prefent 
minifter. His ftipend, by a late decreet, is worth L. loo 
Sterling. Colonel Hay of Rannes is patron. ' The church 
was lately rebuilt^ and the manfe repaired and enlarged. 

Characier 6f the People, and Mifcetlaneoiis ObferDations, 
—They are in general fober, honeft, and induftrious.' 
Where an eftate is newly peopled, the farmers cannot be 
fuppofed to be fo tiiuch attached to the foil, of to the pro- 
prietor, as where they have refided on thef lands from their 
infancy. And it fometimes happens, that a ftranger will 
take an improved farm, with a defign to fcourge it. This 
cannot be juftified by the laws of morality. On the other 
hatid, an indulgent landlord is refpefted by his old tenants ; 
and whenever the rents of an eftate are raifed beyond a 
certain fum, the proprietor feldom gains fo much in point 
of real interejl, as he lofes in point of refpeftability of cha- 
rader. In the diftria of Garioch, nominal rents have pro- 
duced bad payments and difpirked farmers. A little far- 
ther advancement in the knowlege of farming, and a little 
more indulgence from the proprietor, will, it is hoped, foon 
produce in a country naturally fertile, rents that are regu- 
larly paid, and farmers who ate enterprifing and inde-* 
pendent.

APPENDIX to the Statistical Account of 
the Parifh of Inveresk, 



BY defire of the patron of the parifii, a meeting of 
heritors was held in November 1794, to confult 
about repairing or rebuilding the church, when an enquiry 
was directed to be made refpedling the number of perfons, 
who could be accommodated with feats in the prefent 
church, and the number who might be expefled to require 
feats, if there was a church built of fufficient dimenlions. 
The refult was as follows z

The heritors having met after this enquiry was made 
and reported to them, Refolved, after having confidered it, 
That as neither the walls nor roof of the prefent church are 
ruinous or infufEcient, that there appears no neceffity for 
pulling the church down at this time, jand rebuilding it. 
This refolution was made, though it was underftood that 
the town of Muffelburgh was willing to be at two-thirds 
of the expence in rebuilding the church. 

N. B. It is proper to obferve, in juftice to this populous 
parifli, that however wavering many of them may have 
been in their political opinions during the years 1792 and 
1793, it is certain, that no more than 30 joined thofe dan- 
gerous focieties, who ftyled themfelves Friends of the 
People. 

It is neceffary to add, that there is a miftake in the 
Statiftical Account, which ftates the revenue of the town 
of Muffelburgh at L. 1500, as it does not amount now to 
more than L. 1200, having been reduced by the fall of the 
rent of their mills.
