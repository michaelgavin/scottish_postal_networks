PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1011681">COUPAR OF ANGUS</name>. 

(Counties of Perth and Forfar. — Presbytery of 
Meigle. — Synod of Angus and Mearns.) 

By Mr John Ritchie Student in Divinity at Markinch.</head> 



<p>Situation and Extent. 

THE parifli of Coupar lies towards the center of the 
fpacious valley of Strathniore. Though defigned of 
Angus^ thegreateft part of it is fituated in the county of Perth. 
The diftance from the latter is 1 2 miles, and from Dundee 
nearly the fame. The river Ilia is its northern boundary. 
The length of the parifli is about 5 miles, in the diredHon of 
S. W. and N. E. The breadth is from 1 to 2 miles. Kw- 
loch and Batmyle, formerly belonged to this parifli, but are 
now annexed to that of Mcigle.

bank fro t 1 ""''"^''^ ^^^'Sht. The afcent o this 
banyro. the fouth is eafy ; fro. the north it is fteeper 
Connguous, on the north fide, he the Haughs of Ifla con 

haughs produce excellent crops of corn and grafs. It fre- 
quently happens, that, after northerly rains, the Ifla is P^ell- 
ed to fuch a degree, as to lay the adjacent banks and haughs 
under water to a great extent, and, in time of harveft, thefe 
uundat.ons have been known to carry off large quantities of 
corn. Wherever the ground is elevated in any degree, the 
iod IS hgnt and gravelly; i„ the low grounds the foil is either 
of a clayey or loamy nature. The ^Tattort Mire is a common 
of confiderable magnitude, containing nearly 2co acres. The 
people of the parifli were wont to repair thither for turf and 
fods, which they ufed in part as feuel. It is now totally ufe- 
lefs in this refpefl. Several overtures have been made to 
have this common partitioned among the heritors, but none 
W yet fucceeded. Were it drained, and fheltered with 
plantmg, it might turn to advantage. It now prefents a 
bleak and barren appearance in the heart of a rich corn 
country. The only plantation ground Is in the weft end 
of the parifL, containing from jo to loo acres of common 
fir, the property of Lord Privy Seal. In many places of the 
pari Oi and country adjacent, we meet with a red earth bf a 
clayey undluous nature, commonly called mortar, and fome- 
times ufed in building. It is found a few inches below the 
furface, and reaches to a confiderable depth. Below this ftra- 
tum of red earth is found a foft ftone of the fame colour, 
which is, evidently, the fame earth in a confolidated form. 

Agriculture. ~T^z lands are now generally inclofed with 
thorn hedges. Formerly, the diftinaion between Outjidd and 

Itifield 



of Ccupa'r of Jngus.

itijield was conftantly obferved. The former was cro^^ped al- 
te;-nately with oats and bear j the latter, after a few fucceflive 
crops of oats, was fuffered to lie out a number of years in lea. 
Tlie run-rigg prevailed, too, in many places. Thefe abfurd 
praftices are now worn out, and the modern improvetrients 
generally introduced. Ploughs drawn by caitle were former- 
ly in ufe. Thefe are now luceeded by ploughs with two 
horfes abreaft, wheie one man both hold-: and drives. 

Produce and Cattle. — Li !it- feed is fcjwn in confiderable quan- 
tities ; and. when the feafons prove favourable it fucceeds 
very well ; the lippie of feed frequently giving a flone of drel- 
fed flax. Half a century ago no wheat was railed' in Conpar. 
The quantity is ftill inconfxderable, owing to the difficulty of 
procuring manure. No field bt^ans are railed. Oats, barley, 
and peafe, are the grain in moft requeft. The barley Is either 
fold to the brewers in the town of Coupar, or carried to the 
neighbouring ports, where it is either ^malted or pm on Oiip- 
board. The other grain, made Into meaj, generally finds a 
ready market in the populous village of Coupar. i iic prices 
of the corn are tiie ijme as in the neighbouring pardhes. The 
grafles fown are rye-grals and red clover. No hay is made but 
for home confumption, A few acres are generally fallowed in 
fummer, and tields ol turnips reared for the cuttle agaiidt win- 
ter. Each tenant brings up young cattle in proportion to the 
extent of his farm. Thefe he difpofes of to drovers, or fuch 
as keep grafs parks, who feed them, and take them to Fal- 
kirk to meet the linglilh merchants.. There are no (heep 
kept in this diftria. Potatoes are raifcd in large quantities, 
and are of great fervice to the poor. . It is not much above 20 
years, fince this ufcful root came into general ufe in this parilh. 

Leafes,-T\.t farms are commonly let for a term of i years, 



4 Statiftical Account 

a period by far too fliort to roule the exertion of the tenant, 
and induce him to employ that labour and expence,in n.elio- 
rating the foil, which he might have m his power. Proprie- 
tors of land, it is prefumcd, would find it ultimately to the 
advantage of their eftates, did they give more fcope to the 
farmer, by granting him a leafe of triple the ordinary time. 
In fuch a cafe it might be ftipulated, too, (hat the proprietor 
Ihould receive a certain fum of money upon the expiration of 
an ordinary leafe. At the commencement of the latelt leafes 
the rents have been nearly doubled. The land, at an average, 
brings about i(5s. per acre, though fomc farms are let at above 
20 s. per acre. The number of acres in the whole parilh, by 
a grofs calculation, is about 2400, without including the com- 
mons j and the prefent rent is 2214I. 

Climate, Difeafesy ^c. — Remarkable inllances of longevity 
have feldom occurred. A poor woman died a few years ago, 
who muPc have been 1 16 years, from what flie remembered 
to have leen. The fituation of the parilh is healthy, there 
being no marfliy ground or ftagnant water, nor any thiwg to 
obftrud: a free circulation of air. There are no difeafes pe- 
culiar to the place. Nervous and hyfterical diforders are faid 
to 'be much more common now than formerly, owing, with- 
out doubt, to the v/ay of Hving, particularly to the more fre- 
quent ufe of fpiritous liquors and tea. The prejudices againft 
inoculation are far from being removed, efpecially among 
the poorer fort. 

Toivfi, Roads, tsfc — CouPAR is divided by a rivulet, which, 
turning the mills of Kethock^ with two others in its courfe, 
falls into the Ifla *, about 5 miles to the weftward. The 



* The'bridge over the /Jla, near Coupar, was built in ^I^S' 

There 



of Coupar of Angus, $ 

Abbey with that part of the town which lies on the fouth of 
this rivulet, falls within the county of Forfar. The reft of 
the town and parlfh are in the county of Perth. The ftreets 
are paved, and have lately been provided with lamps. The 
town has received confiderable ornament, as well as advan- 
tage, from the excellent turnpike roads that have juft been 
finiflied. The Ptrth road, from the weft, falls upon the crofs 
in a direa line of about a mile; with this the Dundee road, 
from the fouth, forms a right angle and, when the latter is 
carried diredly through she town, to the eaft, as is in con- 
templation, and the ground on each fide feued for building, 
the beauty will be nearly completed. Several good houfcs 
have lately been butk here. I he fteeple was built in 1762, 
on the fpot where the prifon of the court of regality ftood. 
The view from the Beach Hilly northward of the town, is An- 
gularly delightful. Thf eye contemplates the meanders of the 
river Ifla, in its courfe through a fertile and extenfive plain ; 
and, on the other fide, a champaign open country, variegated 
with thriving villages and fruitful fields. Hiere is a weekly 
market on Thurfday, and fairs in April, May, July, and De- 
cember. Coupar is fuppoled to have tripled the number of 
its inhabitants within the laft half century. This increafe is 
chiefly owing to the encouragement given to the manufac- 
turing of linen in this part of the country, and partly to the 
mcnopolifing of farms, by which fmall tenants and trades 
people have been obliged to remove to manufa£luring towns. 

Villages, MillSf ^c. — Next to Coupar, the greatcft villages 
are Balbrogie, JVe/ltotty and Cadam ; and the number of fami- 
lies in the largeft of thefe does not exceed 35, There is fcarce- 

ly 



There is no bridge between that and Perth on the one fide, nor 
between it and the bridge of Deane on the other.

Stati/iical Account 



ly a garden In the parifh that defcrves the name; culinary 
produaions being more regarded than ornament or ele- 
gance. There are 2 rivulets and 5 mills ; i in Coupar, 3 in 
Ivethock, and 1 in Balgirlho. 

ManufaBures.—Thtrt is a tannery in Coupar, which was 
built in 1 78 1, wherein about 2600 hides of different kinds 
are dreffed annually, and 9000 ftone of bark ufed. There is 
alfb a very confiderable linen manufadure *. In r 792, there 
were flamped at the ftamp-ofEce in this town, all manufac- 
tured in the courfe of that year, and within the bounds of 
the parifh, 97,810 yards of brown linen (in about 600 reed), 
and 116,793 yards of /^flr/;. Both thefe kinds are fent to 
the Englifh market. The linen is whitened at the bleach- 
fields in the neighbourhood, is ufed for buckrarn and hat 
linings, and is worth about 9 d. per yard. The harn is ufed 
for pack-fheet, and is worth about 5 d. per yard. There is 
but one bleachfield in the parifh, viz. that at Balgirfho, at 
which there are annually whitened about 200,000 yards. The 
number laft year (1793) was only 90,000 yards. There are 
4 whifky flills in the parifli, 3 of 40 gallons, and i of 30. 

Population,— ^Tht population of this parifh has increafed 
confiderably within thefe 40 years, as will appear from the 
following Table ; 

POPULA- 



* The introduflion of the linen manufaflure, into this pariAi 
and neighbourhood, was principally owing to George Young, 
late a mercliant in this town, a man of an uncommon capacity 
for bufinefs and improvements. This man found means, hy 
petitioning the Board of Truftees for the Forfeited Etlates of 
Scotland, to procure a furvey, and eflimate of expence, for a 
Canal between Perth and Forfar by this place. The pUn 
was formed on a fcale too expenfive for the flate of the country 
at that time, and was confequently drop:.

Rent^ Heritors, Church, Poor, ^c. — The valued rent of the 
parifli is 6669 1. 14 s. 4 d. Scotch. The number of heritors 
is 35. The chief proprietor is the Earl of Murray. The 
Crown is patron. The ftipend is 500 merks Scotch, and 6 
chalders of victual, with an allowance for the communion ele- 
ments. The glebe is inconfiderable. The manfe was built 
anew in 1781. The church was repaired in 1780. — There

ed by the collections at the church doors. The colleaions, 
at a medium, including mort-cloth fees, and dues for mar- 
riages, amount to about 56 I. per annum. The poor's- money- 
is diftributed to them monthly, and they are allowed from 
2 s. to 5 5. at a time. There is an Antiburgher and a Relief 
meeting-houfe in Coupar. The latter was built in 1792. They 
are both well filled, but chiefly from the neighbouring pa- 
rifhes. 

The fchbol was rebuilt in I792, and is large and 
well lighted. The average number of fcholars is about 60. 
The mailer is in a valetudinary ftate, and the fchool is taught 
by an affiftant. EngUfh is taught for is. 6 d. Writing and 
arithmetic at 2 s. 6 d. and Latin at 3 s. per quarter. The 
falary is n 1. 2 s. Sterling. -Sir John Sinclair, or any- 

other public fpirited gentlemen conne61:ed with Parliament, 
who have the inrei^eP. of their country at heart, muft be con- 
vinced of the neceffity of adopting Ibme plan, to put the pa- , 
rochial teachers in Scotland on a more refpeClable footing. 
Their fituation, at prefent, is not equcjl, in point of emo- 
lument, on an average, to that of the meaneft mechanic or 
day labourer. 

Bifadvantages. — The fcarcity of fuel, and the great diftance 
from any fea-port, are incoiiveniencies feverely felt by the in- 
habitants of this diftriCt, The mofles, the nearelt of which 
is 6 miles diftant, are either totally exhaufted, or rcftridted 
to the tenants of the ground. To have coals from Penh or 
Dundee is found, therefore, to be the cheapeft expedient. 
Thefe, confidering the diftance they have to be driven, and 
the high expences of carriage, prove very expenfive to the 
poor tradefman. Much, too, of the farmer's time, t!\at would 
have been laidj^out in improving his f:;rm, is indifpenfibly loft

• See Vol. T. No. IJII. 

t On the center of this camp, Malcolm IV. founded an 
Abbey for Ciltestian Monk;, A. JD. 1104, and endowed it with 
large revenues. This houfe was /oundei-i by advice of the Ab- 
bot ot Mclrois, who was of the fame order ; and it is faid the 
Moiiky were long remarkable for their piety and exemplary 
lives. From the pavemer-t, and oafes of pilars, and fiibterrane- 
ous pailages that have been difcovered, this Abbey appears to 
have been a houfe i l confiderable magnitude. Next to the 
Scottifh Kir.gs, the Have of Ekrol were the principal bene- 
fadtors to the Abbey of Coupar. The latter granted it the lands 
of Lidutrpnlc;, feverai acres of arable laud on the banks of the 
Tay, and liberty of iifliing on that river. The Monks were al- 
lowed free pailagc v.iih their cattle over all tiie lands belonging 
to the houfe of E.iol Gilbert Hay, Conftable of Scotland, 
granted them the patronage sf the Chin ch of Errol, and Chapel 
of Inchmartin, with all their pertinents and riv^hts. In return 
for thefe immnniiies, the houfe of Errol claim'ed the privilege 
of burial ia the Abbey. The lafl Abbot oi Coupar was Do-

lar fquare of 24 acres. Here the half of the Rorr.an army 
are fuppofed to have encamped, while the other remained at 
Campmuir, a village near two miles S. W. from this place. 
There are no veftiges of a Roman way, nor ?nv Bruidical 
circle or cairn in the parifli *. The Beach HUi oppofite to 
Coupar, Stob'crofs oppofite to Balhrogie, and the TfiUh Know 
oppofite to Cronan, are evidently railed by art, though tradition 
is fiknt rcfpedting the caufe. On the firft of thefe a Roman 
urn was found ; and it is laid, that jultice ufed to be adminif- 
tered here, in ancient times, in the open air. The following 
names of places, in the vicinity of Coupar, are faid to be de-

NALD Campbell of the family of Argyll. At the Reforma- 
tion, this man is faid to have divided, among 5 natural fons., all 
of the parifh that belonged to the Abbey, viz. Balgeirftio, Ke- 
thock, Denhead, Cronan, and Arthurilone. Some time before 
the Reformation, this houfe began to fall into decay ; and, at 
laft, a number pf furious reformers from Perth completed its 
ruin. 

* Lately, in digging at the weft end of the church, there 
were found upwards of a dozen of ftone coffins. Some were 
formed of one entire ftone; others were made up of iwo pieces 
brought together in the middle. The infide imitated the ftiape 
of the human body, being wideft at the fhoulders, narroweti: at 
the neck, and having the place for the head rounded, in fonie 
there were found feveral fkeletons in the natural pofltions, with 
layers of earth placed between them. The covers of moft of 
thefe coffins confifted of feveral flat ftones ; but no date, or cha- 
racter of any kind, was obferved, whereby a conjeiflure might 
have been formed of their age, or the perfons therein depolit'cd. 
The cover of one was of an entire ftone, at the foot of which 
there was faintly vifible fome rude kind of ornament, and on the 
right fide a capital Englifti D was obfervable. One, being mea- 
fured, was found to be 6 feet long within, 18 inches broad at 
the ftioulders, ■ i|. inches wide at the feet, and 15 inches deep. 
One appeared to have been, originally, too narrow, as the (ides 
thereof were widened, feemingly to let down the arms of the 
corpfe. Several fmall figures, cut out of ftone, and reprefeating 
wanlors, have been alfo dug out from among the rubbilh.

frugal, and induftrious. They are hofpitable and obliging to 
itrangers, and charitable to the poor. In their dealings thev 
are open, unfufpeaing, and fincere. Their ftature is of the 
middle fize, few exceeding 6 feet high; and their general ap- 
pearance indicates ftrength and vigour. Their hair is gene- 
rally of a darkifh hue, though fome are to be feen with yellow 
or flaxen locks. In the article of drefs, cxpence and finery 
are much more ftudied than formerly. Not above 40 years 
ago, the broad blue bonnet, with a coat of home manufac- 
ture, was univerfally worn by the men. The tartan plaid, 
applied cloiely over a head drefs of linen, was in ufe among 
the women. At prefent, few, fervant lads are to be feen at 
church without their coats of Lnglilh cloth, hats on their 
heads, and watches in their pockets. At the period juft re- 
ferred to, a watch, an eight day clock, or a tea kettle, were 
fcarcely to be met with. At prefent, there are few houfes 
without one or other of thefe articles ; perhaps one half of 
the families in the parifh are poflefled of all of them.

cropping and improvements, that is followed in Coupar and 
the neighbouring parifl^es, is pradifed here, and the produce 
is much in the fame proportion. Here, too, the fame dif- 
advantages, fcarcity of firing, and the diftance from lime and 
coal, operate as a check on the induftry and improvement of 
the farmer.— There are a few dealers in cattle in the parifh, 
who keep grafs parks, and drive their fed cattle to Falkirk, 
or to England —There are now no flieep in the parifh. A 
few were kept to pafture on the hill of Peatie till lately. 

Rent and Proprietors.— Tht valued rent of the parifti is 
5129I. 16 s. 8 d. Scotch. The prefent rent is unknown. 
The land, at a medium, lets at 17 s. Sterling per acre. — The 
number of heritors is 8, whereof 7 are refident. Lord 
Aboyne is chief heritor. 

Eccleftajiical State. — The Crown is patron. The ftipend 
was formerly 8 chalders 9 bolls 7 pecks of visual, but has 
been lately augmented. The church was built in 1768*, 
and repaired in 1791. The manfe was built from the foun-

John Haliburton. 

Poor and School. — The poors money, colle£led at the church 
doors, together with a rent arifing from a mortification on

Bleachfields^ Longevity, ^c. — There are 3 bleachfields in 
the parilh, Borland, Baldinnie, and Kirk-Jieps. The two firft 
whiten annually 100,000 yards, the laft about 30,000 yards. 
— Few very remarkable inftances of longevity have occurred 
within the recolledlion of the inhabitants, though to hear of 
people dying at the advanced age of 90 and upwards is not 
uncommon. There was a man alive laft autumn (1793) at 
the age of 106. There are no epidemic difeafes peculiar to 
this parifli. Inoculation for the fmall-pox is by no means 
general, efpecially among the lower clafles.

Namfy EreBion^ and Extent. 

THE antlent name isLoinn, derived from Luidhoin, which 
fignifies, in the Erie, or Gaelic, lodged or bedded bear, 
becaufe the lands contiguous to the church are of a good 
quality, and yield excellent bear. The modern or Englifli 
name is Latheron. — The parifli was formerly divided Into two 
parilhes at leaft, if not more. In the title-deeds of Borg, a 
part of the eftate of Dunbeath, it is defigned the town and 
lands of Nether Borg, lying in the parifli of Dunbeath, and 
fliire of Invernefs *. — The parifli Is 27 miles in length along 
the fea cofl:, and from 10 to 15 miles in breadth in different 
parts. 

Roads. — The principal, or only proper road from the 
fouth to Caithnefs and Orkney, along the Ord of Caithnefs,

n.fters houfe. divides itfelf into two roads, the one paffin, 
^long the rea.fide to Wide, and the other croffing the count 
try by the Caufaymire towards Thurfo. 

Surface, Hills, Sea Coajl, Soil, ^c^The appearance of 
the par.fh is diverfified, partly flat and partly hilly, or moun- 
tamous.^The coaft is bold and rocky, rifing perpendicular, 
m many parts loo yards and upwards, above the level of the 
fea.-There are immenfe trafts of mofs and muir ground- 
There are three large hills or mountains (befides many fmal- 
ler ones), Morvine, Scarabine, and Maiden-Pap. The top of 
Morvine is fuppofed to be more than a mile above the level 
of the fea. With a clear flcy, one will fee from it a part of 
I o or 12 different (hires. There is a fine fpring near the 
top of it. -The coaft is interfedled by feveral ftraths, on wa- 
fers running from the hilly part of the parifli towards the 
fea. The ftraths are furrounded with hills or high lands, 
which are covered with heath or pafture, interfperfed with I 
little brufliwood. The foil in general is fliarp, in fome parts 
a ftrong rich clay, in others inclining to grit, or gravel, but 
in moft parts interfperfed with maffcs of detached rocks, and 
loofe ftones, the naked rock appearing often in the arable 
lands. The cultivated lands are generally fliallow, yet'pro- 
duftive of pretty heavy crops. What is not cultivated has 
in general a poor appearance, excepting the pafture and 
woodlands in the different ftraths. 

Climate, Difeafes, and Longevity — The climate in general 
is dry and healthy.— The moft prevalent difeafes are fevers, 
fluxes, and rheumatifms. Fluxes were very prevalent among 
the common people in 1782 and 1783, owing, it is fuppofed, 

to 



of Lather on, *^ 

,0 the unfavourable feafons, and the corns being damaged. 
Whv rheumatifms are much more frequent among the coun- 
try people now than formerly, no other caufes can be affign- 
cd, than the immoderate ufe of fpirituous liquors, and that 
they now wear linen next their Ikin, inftead of a coarfe kmd 
of woollen ftuff of their own making, which they formerly 
ufed to wear. Severals have died lately about 90 years ot 
age; one man in particular, Henry Christian m Lyb- 
fter, died in 1786, who could not be lefs than from no to 
,20 years of age, by his own account. He was confidered 
as an old man in the infancy of the oldeft people alive in his 
neighbourhood. 

Mheral Springs, Rivers, Lakes, b^r.-There are many 
fprings in the parifh flightly impregnated with iron, though 
none of any great importance — There arc three fmall rivers, 
Dunbeaih, Languoalh and Berrindale. The two laft join with- 
in 100 yards of the Tea. In thefe rivers are caught falmon 
and trouts.— There are two fmall lakes, Ranga and Stempjier, 
where trouts and eels are found. In the fide of the former, 
there are the ruins of a fmall fortification, and contiguous 
to the latter, the remains of a Druidical temple, and the 
arch-druid's houfe. 

Fineries.— There are no fewer than 20 difi'erent fpecies of 
filh caught on this coaft. Befides the various kinds of fiOi 
confumed by the inhabitants, fuch as turbot, Ikate, haddocks, 
whitings, cuddings, fellags, dog-fifh, mackerels, flounders, 
&amp;c. there are three filhings carried on for exportation, the 
cod and Ung, the herring, and the lobfter. The cod fiftiing 
has been carried on for many years. The ftations are Dun- 
beath, Toife, and Clyth. The herring fifliing was only at- 
tempted within thcfe four years, and promifes to be fuccefs-

who ,s pnncpally fupported by the people who have the be- 
xiefit of hearmg him.-Excepting the few families above 
mentioned, all the inhabitants belong to the eftablifhed

100 merks Scotch, with 20 I. Scotch for officiating as feffion 
clerk and precentor. He has alfo 6 d. for every baptifm, 
6 d. for each certificate, and is. 7 d. each for marriages. 
-There are 2 fchools eftabliflied here by the Society for 
Propagating Chriftian Knowledge. There are 3 or 4 other 
fchools in diftant parts of the parilh, fupported by the inha- 
bitants. 

Poijr.—The number of perfons commonly on the poor's 
roll is from 70 to 80.— The only funds are the Sunday col- 
Icaions, and the fines paid by delinquents ; the former is ve- 
ry trifling, being fcarcely 3 1. Sterling. The confequence is, 

that 



hf Latheron, 



tiiat fuch of them as are able to walk about, go from door to 
door, not only within the bounds of the parifh where they re- 
fidc, but alfo in the neighbouring parifhes. Two caufes may 
be affigned for the colleftions being fo fu lall, namely, too great 
a difregard to public worfhip among thole of z J'uperior Jla- 
iion, and the poverty of the common clafles, together with 
their being too fond of drinking whifky. 

. Rent. — The real rent is about 1900 1. Sterling. The va- 
lued rent, in Scotch money, is 3940 1. 14 s." 5 d. 

Agriculture and Produce.— There is a good deal of grain 
raifed in, and exported from this parifh. — There are three 
kinds of oats, white, black, and grey, bcfides beans, potatoes, 
and peafe. — Sowing of grals and turnips is only in its infancy. 
This is no doubt partly owing to the fhortnefs of the leafes, 
and partly to the want of inclolures. The feed time com- 
mences commonly about the end of March, or beginning of 
April, and the harvefl about the beginning of September. 
The crops on fome of the ftrath grounds, at a diftance from 
the fea, are very apt to be hurt by frofts, blafling, or mildew, 
particularly on the Highland eflate of Braemore. The in- 
habitants in thefe parts fuffered very much in 1782 and 
1784. The common mode of farming among the tenantry 
is to few bear and oats alternately, excepting what ground 
they lay down with potatoes. If the land in this parifh had 
the fame juftice done to it, which other parts have, by be- 
ing refted, and raifing green crops, there is no doubt that it 
would yield as luxuriant crops as moft parts of Scotland. 
But the cattle being fmall, little is done by the plough. They 
go four a.breaft, and the driver goes backward, with his face 
to the ploughman and the cattle.

Prices of Labour ard Provi/ions.-Thcfc two articles are 
greatly increafed of late years. A day-labourer gets from 
8 d. to 1 s. a day i women 4 d. and 5 d. Men fervants from 
3 1. to '41. bcfides 6 boils of meal, or their maintenance in 
the houfe ; women fervants, befides maintenance, receive 
from 30 s. to 40 s. a year.-Pork and mutton fell commonly 
at 3 d. the pound, and even beef in fome feafons of the year. 
There is no market in the parifh, nor any one nearer than 
20 or 30 miles. The gentlemen, for the moft part, muft 
therefore kill for their awn ufe. 

Services — It were greatly to be wifhed that fervices were 
entirely aboliflied, as they are much againft induftry and 
improvement. However, according to the prelent mode of 
firming, fome fort of fervices may be abfolutely necciTary. 
Although unlimited fervices are wearing out by degrees, yet 
they are ftill continued in fundry refpeas, which is both fla- 
vifli and detrimental to the tenants. I'hey have a tendency 
to hurt their morals, as well as to hinder induftry and im- 
provement.

* According to tradition, William Sutherland was the 
laft who uo&amp;lhd the caRle of Ben indale. He was called Wil- 
MAM More Mackhhin, e. Big William the fon of Hector, 
implying that he was of a gigantic fize. He went to Orkney 
with one of the Earls of Caithness, and was killed '^J'^f'^- 
milh there. Before he fee out on this expedition, it is faid he 
was prepoil'effed with the opinion, that he never would return 
to his native country. He lay down on the ground above Ber- 
rindale inn, contiguous to the burial place, and caufed the 
length of his body to be cut out in the form of a grave, which 
to this day retains the name of the long grave, and nieaiures 
about 9 feet 5 inches. 

The following Memoir rcfpe^ing ihe giganiicVJ'\Lh^ hU, 
grand/on to Hector More of Lancwkll, has 
been communicaied by another hand. 

About the end of the T5th century, Hfctor Sutherland, 
commonly called Hector More, or Meikle Hcaor, was proprie- 
tor of the eftate of Langwell. He was delcended of the fa- 
mily of DuFFUs, and refided in a caftie on the rock at the wa- 
ter mouth of Berrydale, the ruins of which are Hill vifible. He 
built a houfe at Langwell, for his eldeft fon William, who mar- 
ried a beautiful woman, and refided there. — Some little time 
afteiwards, William's wife was in child bed of her firfl: child, 
and Robert Gun, tackfman of Bfaemore, came over the hills to 
Langwell, accompanied by iome of his clan, on a hunting par- 
ly, Robert Gun propofed to his friends, that they would pay 
a vifit to Hedtor More's fon, and his young wife, which they 
accordingly did. Robert Gun, upon feeing the woman in bed, 
fancied her. Upon their way home, Gun declared to his com- 
panions, that he would have William Sutherland's wife to him- 
ielf, and that the only means by which he could accomplifli his 
defign, V7as to take away her hufband's life. His friends, whofe 
confciences were not more^ftrait laced than his own, having ap- 
proved of his intention, they accompanied him the next day 
over the hills, and lay in ambulh in the woods near William 
Sutherland's houfe, until they oblerved him come out to his 

garden*

lefled feveral of his friends, and by feme means or other got 
yoiincr William fosnnich intoxicated, that he was carried to bed, 
•and Robert Gun put his fitter to bed with him.— When Wil- 
liam awakened next morning, he was furprifed to find Gun's 

fifter in bed with him She told him, he might recoileft that 

the ceremonies of marriage paa betwixt them the preceding 
evening, and that fhe was now his lawful fpoufe. He got up 
in a patfion, and declared that he was impofed upon, and that 
he would hold no fuch bargain. 

Robert Gun flattered him, and faid, that as he was now mar. 
ried to his fifter, he would make the match as agreeable to him 
as polfible, by putting him in poffeifion of the ettate of Lang- 
well ; and, in order lo accompliih his promife, he, with a few 
of his conneaions, concealed themfelves near Heflor More's 
caftle on the faid rock, until early in the morning when the 
draw-bridge was let down, they forced their way into the cat- 
tle, and carried Hedlor More (who was then an old feeble man) 
out of his caftle, and left him ip a cot-houfe in the neighbour- 
hood, where he remained for fome little time,, and afterw-ards 
went to Sutherland, and paffed the remainder of his days with 
one of his relations, Sutherland of Rearchar. 

Robert Gun then returned in triumph to Braemore, and 
conduiled William Sutherland and his efpoufed wife to the 
faid caftle, and gave them alfo po/Tefllon of the eftate of Lang- 
well.— William being very much dilfatisfied with Robert Gun's 
conduifl, and not liking the company of his fifter as a fpoufe, 
went and complained of his grievances to the Earl of Caith- 
nefs, who promifed him redrefs as foon as he returned from the 
Orkneys, where he was going to quell a rebellion, along with 
the Baron of Roflin, and wiflied that he, (William) being a very 
flout man, would accompany him. William confented to do 
fo; and returned to Berrydale to bid his friends farewell before 
he would go on fo dangerous an expedition. Juft as he was 
parting with them at the burial ground on the Breas, on the 
eaft fide of the water of Berrydale, he told his friends that he 
fufpedled he never would return from Orkney ; he then laid 
himfelf down on the heath near the faid burial ground, and dc- 
fired his companions to fix two ftones in the ground, the one at 
his head, and the other at his feet, in order to fhew to pofterity

feated them, and the Earl with his fon, and William More Su-

jnen who furvived, carried back the Earl of Caithnels's head, to 
be interred in his Lordfliips burial place in Caithnef,. 

* The old caftle at Achaiftal was built and pofTefTed by John 
Beg, third fon to the Earl of Sutherland. In thofe times 
parties of robbers or freebooters ufed to infeft this county. A 
pirty of thefe came to John Beg's houfe, and infjfted that he 
Ihould pay a certain fum in name of tribute to them, other- 
wife they would plunder his houfe, and carry away his' cattle. 
John Beg feemed very paflive to them, and entertained them 
very fumptuoufly, until he got them all intoxicated, by ftrong 
ale mixed with the juice of nightjhads, when he ordered them 
to be conveyed to the upper apartments of his caftle. He then 
removed his family and furniture, and put them on board a 
velTel at the water mouth of Berrydale ; and having colle^ed 
a great quantity of ftraw and brufli-wood into the lower part 
of his houfe, he fet fire to it, which foon deftroyed the robbers 
and confumed all the caftle, excepting a part of the walls! 
John Beg returned, with his family, to Sutherland. Tradition 
gives no account of the time in which thele tranfaflions hap-

within, that a pcrfon of an ordinary fize may almoft ftand 
erea. ' The walls are well built, and covered with flags. 

Caves, es-r.-A great many caves are to be met with on 
this coaft, fome of which run up lo far under ground, that 
i^one have been able to get to the end of them. They are 
inhabited by vaft numbers of feals. many of which are kil- 
led by the inhabitants in the month of November, m their 
fubterraneous habitations. The employment, however, is 
dangerous ; for fhould the wind blow hard from the fea, 
thefe adventurers are in danger of being loft. 

Advantages and Di/advantages. -This parifh has feveral ad- 
vantages. The fea coaft, as has been obferved, abounds with 
great variety of fifti. The prices of labour and provifions, 
although increafed of late years, are ftill reafonable in com- 
parifon of moft other parts of the kingdom. As an z£t of 
Parliament has lately been obtained to convert the ftatute 
labour into money, it is to be expefted that good roads and 
bridges, of which there is much need, will be the happy con- 
fequence. The want of harbours is a very great difadvan- 
tage. There is not a proper one from Cromarty to Orkney. 
And the want of proper markets for the produftions of the 
parifti is another. The fhortnefs of leafcs, and the want of 
inclofures, are alfo great impediments to induftry and im- 
provements in agriculture — fhere are by far too many 
whifky houfes In the parifti, which is a great incitement to 
the lower claffes of people, to hurt their health and morals, 
and to confume their time and fubftance- The want of 
juftices of the peace is another great difadvantage. There 
is only one gentleman who afts in that capacity, in this very 
populous and extenCve parifh. The confequence of this is, 
that the police is very much neglcfted. If the cafe were 

other- 



3 2 Statl/Iical Account 

otherwife many grievances would be redrefled, and man 
d.fputes fettled, without going before the flieriff-court - 
There 3s an old pradice, which ftill prevails in fame places, 
and which is very detrimental to hufbandry. It is common- 
ly termed rig and rennet. A number of tenants have their 
houfes perhaps clofe to one another. Inflead of every one 
having his land in one place, it is fcattered here and there, 
feveral tenants having different fliares in one field, or a rig a 
piece alternately. Befides flopping the progrefs of improve- 
ment, wrangling and flrife among neighbours, in Towing and 
reaping, are often the coniequences. If fome manufa^ures 
were eftablifhed on this extenfive and populous coaft, they 
would be of great confequence to the inhabitants. If they 
drank more beer, and lefs whilky, it would contribute great- 
ly to their happinefs and comfort. Thefe, and fome other 
difadvantages, under which the inhabitants labour, will no 
doubt be remedied in due time *. 

* As the boundaries between Caithnefs and Sutherland lie 
in this pHrifli, it may not be improper to give the following ac- 
count of them, as inferted in M'Farlane's Geographical Coiiec- 
tions, (A. M. S, in the Advocates Library) vol. I. p. 198, where 
there is a defcription of the parifli of Latheron. 

" The hill of the Ord is that which divides Sutherland and 
*« Caithnefs. The march is a fmall rivulet, called the Burn of the 
« Ord^ which takes its rife from fome fprings near the top of 
*« the hill. The fouth fide of the hill is very fteep, floping all 
«« along to the top of a rock, which is many fathoms high. 
* Crofs the fouth fide of this hill is the common pafTage to and 
«* from this country. The road hath not been fo very dange- 
«* rous as at firft view it would appear to the traveller, for the 
*« whole face of the hill to the top of rhe rock has been covered 
*' with heath, fo that though a perlbn's foot might flip, he was 
• not in great danger ; hue whether through moor burning, or 
" fome other accident, it hath happened fome few years ago,

" ThiTfeems to put the matter beyond all doubt, in addition 
to whfch it may be obferved, that the mountam of the Ord 
exorefsly included in the charters of Langwell. 

The people of Sutherland are ready to acknowledge that the 
burn of the Ord is the boundary, but fome in the neighbour- 
•hood pretend, that they have acquired a ferv.tude of comrnou 
over the ground in the neighbourhood, though fituated m the 
county of Caithnefs. But it feems impolEble that charters, r.- 
Laedto lands in the county of Sutherland c^n be the means of 
acquiring even a right of common, over lands m another coun- 

tv, that of Caithnefs. . , , i j- -r u 

The Burn of the Ord is certainly the natural divifion be- 
tween the two counties ; and until the roads were made th? 
cattle and flieep of Sutherland could hardly get mto Caithnefs 

at that place. _ j . l ..u »• »^ 

When the roads were made, it was agreed by both parties to 
begin at the burn of the Ord, as the point of divifion between 

the tvFO counties. , . , , ry- . u 

The point was incidentally decided at the Circuit Court, 
when the bridge was ordered to be built over the Burn of the 
Ord, as being the boundary. , , , 

Within thefe few years, Mr Howlfon, who rents the kelp 
fhores on the eaft coaft of Sutherland, as is aflerted on the au- 
thority of Mr Gordon, late of Aufdale, quarrelled his men for 
going farther than the Burn of the Ord, being beyond their 
right and privilege. 

Many old men now living can fufficlently prove the bounda- 
ry in queftion. William Campbell, late of Aufdale, an old man 
above 80, knew it well.

Form, Extent, River, and Surface. 

1 T is nearly of the form of an oblong fquare, extending a- 
1 bout 4 miles from E. to W. and 3 from S. to N. The 
river Tyne, running in a direaion from W. to E. divides ,t 
into 2 nearly equal parts, which rife from it by a gradual and 
eafy afcent ; and the fouth, after rifirg nearly to a level with 
the north part, Hopes gently to the fmall rivulet of Kinchey, 
which divides this from the parifti of Ormifton. 

Soil, Cultivation, and Produce. — Iht foil in general is vret 
and clayey, and confequently not adapted, for the turnip fyf- 
tem. The old Eaft Lothian mode of farming is to be met 
with here, and not the beft mode even of it. Upon two 
farms, indeed, where the foil is fit for raifmg turnips, that 
fyftem is adopted, and, in the execution of it, there appears 
a great degree of Ikill and attention. One of them, poffel- 
fed by Mr Alexander Wight, writer to the fignet, has 
exhibited, for fome years paft, a ftate of cultivation not fur- 
paffed, if equalled, in any part of this county.

Farms and Land lets from 1 2 s. to 36 s. per acre. 

The farms are of various fizes : They are not too large, nor 
are they of that diminutive fize, which, though it may give 
the appearance of population to a country, mult prevent the 
markets from being fupplied to that degree with grain, that 
is requifite for the luccefs of manufa^ures, and will always 
produce a difpirited and unlkilful tenantry. The valued rent 
is 65 19 1. 8 s. 4 d. Scotch. The real rent may be fomewhat 
above 3000 1. Sterling. 

Minerals and Mineral TFaiers.—Free ftone is found in ma- 
py places, and there are two quarries of it for fale. Coal 
abounds in this diftrift. It has hitherto been dug only in 
two places, in the higher grounds ; the one on the fouth and 
the other on the north fide of the Tyne. From thefc pits 
coal is obtained for a great part of the fouth and eaft diftrifls 
of this county, and a good deal is carried to Lauderdale. A 
pit has alfo been funk lately near the Tyne, and an engine i&amp; 
creating for clearing away the water, as the feam of the coal 
lies much deeper than the bed of the water. Lime-ftone 
may probably be found in many places ; kilns, however, are 
eredted only upon the eftate of Pencaitland ; and Ibme idea 
may be formed of their extent, from the circumftance of 45 
cart-loads of coal, weighing each 1 5 cwt, being frequently 
ufed in the fpace of a week for burning the ftone. — There 
are feveral fprings of water of the mineral kind. They have 
never met with much attention from the public ; but are 
held in high eftimation by the common people, for fcorbutic 
diforders.

known. After a late or wet harveft, putrid fevers,' indeed, 
are prevalent ; and in thcfe cafes, the adminiftrators of the 
poor's funds give affiftance, where it is necefTary, with their 
ufual humanity fumifliing medicines, and paying for the at- 
tendance of a lurgeon. 

Woods. — There are 155 acres of natural wood, confifting 
of oak and birch, and about 191 are planted with foreft 
trees. Sir Andrew Lauder has kept a regiftcr of the increaf- 
ed Cze of a number of trees near his houfe, and intends to 
continue it. The following is an extradl from this regifter :

IS pleafant, has a /ombre appearance, and inftantly fills tha 
mind of the fpeftator with the idea of the folly of engaging 
deeply in fadion, whereby an ettate, (of which this is a part), 
more valuable and more commodious than any other of the 
fame fize in Scotland, was loft for ever to its owners. The 
young woods on the eftate of Fountainhall, it has been ob- 
fcrvcd, have of late fuffered much from fquirrels, which 
were introduced fome years ago at Dalkeith, and have fpread 
to this neighbourhood. They have attacked the Scotch firs 
in the proportion of about i in 20, and almoft every larix 
and elm. Already many of each of them are killed. If the 
harm they do in other places be as great, and be progreffive 
as they multiply, this intended improvement will be unfor- 
tunate. 

Populatiou. — From the number of births regiftered during 
the laft 10 years, compared with a like period at any time 
fince 1750, it would appear that the population has been in- 
creafing in that degree which might be expected in a diftridl 
like this, where the whole inhabitants are not employed in 
agriculture. This may be the more readily admitted as fuf- 
ficient evidence of the fad, that in the country parifhes, ma- 
ny of the common people, fince the date of the tax upon the 
regiftration of baptifms, do not regifter the births in their 
families ; a circumftance to be regretted, as it may, in the 
courfe of events, be attended with bad confequences to their 
pofterity. From various enumerations, however, taken at 
different periods, it is certain that the increafe has been by 
no means uniform, as yf'iW appear from the following table.

^othuu. The county, however, have at laft turned their at- 

nfiderahle Tu. for one, and ereaed a toll-bar upon another 
cf h great roads , by .eans of .hich, it is expeaed they 
- II be put mto good repair, and prove, in that event, of 
«^uch unhty to the country. Notwithftanding the bad ftate 
which the roads in general are, much has been done for 
them by Sir Andrew Laudeu, on the fouth fide of the 
lyne. From his accurke reports, given in annually to the 
juftices of the peace, it appears, that, befides the faithful ap- 
phcation of the ftatute money, he has,frorn the year ,770 to 
thisprefent date (February ,794), expended 500 1. and in 
proportion for other roads, befides thofe on his own eftate ; 
and there is reafon to believe, that a fimilar expenditure may 
be expeaed from him for the future. Commendation is 
here by no means necefTary, but a wifh may perhaps be ex- 
prefled, that proprietors in general would fhew a like atten- 
tion to that obvious faa, that good roads are the firft and 
moft beneficial improvement to a conntry. 

r,-%^/.--There are 4 villages, viz. Ea/er znd Wejer Pe?i. 
eatthnds. Winton, and Nijhet. In thefe all the trades people 
refide. In the village of Nifbet there arc 2 weavers, who 
employ 8 looms for country work. They are the only wea- 
vers in the parifh who are independent of the farmers, and 
confequently employ additional hands. This little faa, per- 
haps, deferves notice. In the formation of villages, proprie- 
tors have too generally favoured the introduaion of trades 
people, from the fole confideration of raifing their rent-roll, 
by letting a very few acres at a much higher rate than far- 
mers 



of Fencaitland*

mers could pay for them. It would be better policy, as well 
as more gratifying to every liberal mind, to permit this ne- 
cefiary and important clafs of people, to fit at very cafy rents, 
and free from every fervitude to the farmers. In this way | 
they would feel themlelves comfortable, and be pleafed with 
their fituation. P'armers, and confequently landholders, 
would reap cflential advantages from the increafe of their 
numbers, and their thriving condition ; and there would be 
no neceffity for their retiring to the great towns, and increaf- 
ing there, the mafs of an unhealthy and debauched rabble. 
The above 4 villages contain only 5 1 2 fouls ; but it is better 
that this number fhould occupy 4 villages than one. There 
is a fallacy in the idea, that villages in the country are in a 
more thriving ftate the more populous they become ; for in 
the fame proportion as they contain above 200 fouls, they 
will be found to be declining, often in induftry, and always 
in morals. Proprietors, therefore, in the country, who have 
proper ftations for villages, would confult utility as well as 
ornament, by the ereftion of two fmaller, inftead of one large 
village. And while they give every reafonable encourage- 
ment and fecurity to villagers, they fhould be equally cautious 
relative to feus, as the proprietors of them, when neceflarily 
removed, are too apt, rather than fell their property, to let 
it to any beggar or vagabond. 

Provifiom and Wages. ^VxoMi^ions of all kinds have rifea 
in their price one third completely, during the laft 20 years. 
A hen cofts 1 s. a chicken 6 d. eggs 4d. per dozen, butter 
p d. per pound, cheefe 6 d. The rife of wages has been pro- 
portional during the above period. A labourer receives daily 
10 d. in winter, and i s. in fummer. A young man fit for 
farm work, receives maintenance and 7 1. for the year. A 
farm fervant, who lives in his own houfe, has an annual in- 
come

come of 14 1. The wages of an able workman at the llme- 
kilns are i^d. and, at piecework, he may earn 2 s. 6d. 
The colliers are paid by the quantity of coal they throw out, 
and have a free houfe, together with coals for fuel. A col- 
lier, with a bearer, at the rate of working 4 or 5 days in the 
week, earns 65 1. annually. Thefe great profits, as might be 
expected, are, in general, thrown away in a very injudicious 
manner, which tends not a little to produce a fcarcity, and 
to raife the price of coals at the pit. It were, therefore, to 
be wifhed, now that they have got their liberty, that fome 
meafure could be taken, from which they might find it nc- 
ceflTary to ufe it with more difcretion. This general iiric- 
ture applies by no means to the colliers on the eftate of 
Fountainhall, fome of whom are decent in their morals, and 
in affluent circumftances. Perhaps the fmallnefs of their 
number prefcrves them, in fome degree, from that diffipa- 
tion which fo generally charadlcrifes that clafs of people, and 
on account of which alone, can they be deemed, by the pub- 
lic, unworthy of their great earnings. 

Bleachfields and Mills, ^c. — There is one blcachfield, and 
there are i lint, i ftarch, i thread, 4 barley, and 4 corn 
mills. There are feveral threfliing mills, and one in particu- 
lar built lately on the eftate of Fountainhall, which is 
wrought by water, and, it is laid, performs fome additional 
operations above any other hitherto erefled. A confider- 
able improvement is evidently obtained by thefe threfliing 
mills, when they are driven by water ; but when horfes muft 
be employed, it is not to be rated high. In this diftrift 
there are many circumftances favourable to the introduftion 
and fuccefs of manufaftures but here, as in the Lothians in 
general, this important national objeft meets with lefs atten- 
tion than in other parts of Scotland, where difliculties, that

a woollen manufatfture in this country, and many gentlemen

of it ; — two circumftances, either of which will always be fatal 
to any (imilar undertaking. The nature of manufadure will 
not admit of fpecuiation, nor accord with affociations or

School.^ThQ average number of fcholars is 50. The pay- 
ments are, for reading, i s. 2 d. ; for writing, i s. 6 d. ; for 
arithmetic, 2 s. quarterly. The falary, which was 100 merks, 
was doubled fome months ago by the heritors, upon a peti- 
tion from the fchoolmafter. This is the more fingular, as 
it was in this county that the oppoution originated, againft 
the requeft of the fchoolmafters of Scotland, for fome fmall 
addition to their falaries. Such landholders as are averfe front 
this meafure, are ftill, it feems, to be informed of the good con- 
fequences, that have followed from the education which the 
common people have received at their parifli fchools ; other- 
wife they would not, probably, hefitate to raife thefe ufeful 
members of fociety to a fituation as lucrative, at leaft, as that 
of a ploughman. It was no doubt a queftion in policy, 

Whe- 

* It is fomevvhat remarkable, that during the incumbency of 
the late Mr George Anderson, a period of ^6 years, not one 
individual of his pariiliioners left the ellablillied church. This 
fa5t, though not without a parallel, is to be accounted for, with- 
out doubt, from the prudence of his deportment, and the modera- 
tion of his principles, in coiijuntflion with the example of the heri- 
tors. Indeed it will be generally found, that every clergyman, of a 
limilar defcription, if aided by the attendance of the refiding he- 
ritors upon the public ordinances of religion, will lead his 
hearers, in the fpace of a few years, into the fame train of 
thinking with himfelf. This, it may. be hinted, is the meafure 
to be employed for checking the Seceflion, rather than having 
recouife x.o fcnlpn cvertures, or inquiries concerning the growth

Whether the common people fhould receive education ? Hu- 
manity revolts from the idea. Faas prove ignorance to be 
pernicious. 

Poor.—Tht fum expended annually for their fupport is 
nearly, at an average, 70 1. In the year 1 782, it was 1 12 1. 
None below 60 years of age are received upon the penfion 
lift, as an admiffion, it is thought, to an aliment that is cer- 
tain, at an earlier period, might be unfriendly to their induftry, 
and to the honeft pride, which ought to be cherilhed in the 
loweft clalTes, of eating their own bread. When any, how- 
ever, below that age, are in diftrefs, they never fail to receive 
a proper fupply 5 and the fum given away in this manner, 
is not lefs than what is expended for the penfion lift.' — No 
where, probably, do the poor receive a larger allowance, or 
meet with more cordial attention. Indeed the funds of the 
parifh, though they have entirely arifen, excepting a dona- 
tion of 100 1. from collections fiiice the year 1704, are now 
fo confiderable as to fupply thefe charitable demands, and 
preclude any chance of an affelTment at a future period. The 
pracftice followed hitherto by the refiding heritors, of not al- 
lowing the colledtions to be leflened, by their occafional ah~ 
fence from public ivorJJAp^ has tended greatly to increafe tliefe 
funds. Were this pradlice to take place in other parifiies, 
and to be adopted alfo by non-rejid'mg heritors, (and no good 
reafon can be affigned why it fliould not), it is likely that 
afleffments, fo much and fo juflly dreaded, would, in mofl: 
cafes, be avoided : For though the farmers know they have 
only a temporary intereft in thefe funds, and the loweft clafs 
are aware that it belongs not to them, in any view of the 
matter, to maintain the poor, it is not to be doubted that, 
both thefe claffes would continue, as hitherto, from a reli-

gious principle, to throw in their mite, if they favv a proper- 
tional contribution from the whole heritors. 

Characla- and Mode of Lwwg.—Tl,^ people in general are 
Jatisfied with their condition, and are induftrious. It is not 
remembered that an inhabitant of this parifh has been pu- 
nilhed by the civil magirtrale for any crime. All of thern 
can at leaft read the Bible"; and the greateft part of the 
young men, whofe parents could afford but little for their 
education, attend the fchoolraafter in the winter evenings ; 
who, for a fmall confideration, teaches them writing, and 
the common rules of arithmetic, by which means they ac- 
quire good habits, and become ufeful as farm and family fcr- 
Tants — The mode of living has. become more expenfive than 
formerly among the farmers.— The loweft clais of people 
confine their tafte. and expence to their drefs ; and in this 
refpea they are not behind others in the neighbouring diG- 
tri£ts. In confequence of this rage for finery, though much 
more harmlefs, in every view, than tea and dram drinking, 
(which pervade alraoft every town and great village), the 
common people, in the country through Scotland, will be 
found at prefent to be living almoft as poorly as they did 50 
years ago, when their income was one half lefs ; for it is by 
no means to be placed to the account, (as fome feditious fp'trits 
have of late fliamelefsly attempted to perfuade us), of the bur- 
den of government taxes, which, it is well known to every 
perfon, duly informed about the matter, amount not to more 
annually than 2 s, 8 d. on the neceffary articles of confump- 
tion, in the family of a farm fcrvant, confifting of 6 perfons.

<p>

Etymology of the Name. 
X ECROPT is derived from two Gaelic words, wluch Cg- 
X-i nify one half firm or dry land, alluding to the natural 
divifion of the pariOi into high and low, dry and wet foil. 
One half is upland or elevated ground, the other is a dead flat 
of clay land, which muft have been one continued morifs, 
when the fea retired from the extenfive valley, in which the 
Forth now winds its way to the ocean. 

Situation^ Form, Rivers, Extent, Surface^ ^c. — About two 
thirds of this parifh are fituated within the county of Perth, 
and one third in the county of Stirling. Its latitude is 56". 
n'. N. and its longitude 47'. W. of Edinburgh.— Its form 
is not far removed from an equilateral triangle. — The river 
^eath bounds it on the S. W. where it meets the Forilj and 
the Jllan on the E. The fouthern point is where the Allan 
falls into the united flreams of the other two. From E. to 

W.

W. ,t extends about 3 miles, and nearly about as much from 
N. fo S. It contains about 2000 acres of ground, one half 
of which is a rich clay, the other half up-land, or what is 
generally called dry.field. The clay foil on the fouth is di- 
vided from the up-laud by a beautiful bank, which crofles the 
parilh, almoil parallel to the north fide, and nearly at one 
third of the diftance between it and the fouthern extremity. 
—In all the clay land there is not a fingle ftone or pebble; 
it is therefore inclofed and fubdivided with hedge and ditch, 
or with open drains. The up-Iand, which is feparated from 
the carfe by the bank, and rifbs backward with a gentle af- 
cent, is alfo inclofed, either with ftone walls, or hedge and 
ditch. 

Prcfpea.-^Yrova the bank up Lecropt, there is one of 
the fineft profpedls in this part of the illand, which has 
been always admired by every perfon of tafte. The 
Forth, the Teath, and the Allan unite their flreams, 
and form the largeft river in North Britain, in the cham- 
paign country, on the fouthern borders of the parini. 
Their waving banks being clad with the richeft crops, the 
fnug fteadings of farms, the hedges neatly trimmed, the 
lofty trees, through which the fmoke afcends from the dwel- 
lings, and the bufy hand of man, engaged in the various o- 
perations of agriculture, beautify and enrich the fcene.— On 
the oppofite fide of this fertile valley, the Caftlc of Stirling 
rears its head in rude magnificence, on the fummitof a rock, 
and leads the mind to review the hiftory of -years that are 
paft, when it was the refidence of the antient kings of tJcot- 
land. The huge rock of Craigforth on the one fide of the 
Caflle, and the Abbey Craig on the other, form, with the 
Caftle itfelf, three vaft and detached piles, about the 
diftance of a mile from each other j and, like the pyramids

America. Whether this phenomenon be owing to the current 
of the general deluge, or to the direftion in which the earth re- 
volves round its axis, or to the eaftern inclination of the coun- 
try, is perhaps uncertain j but there appears to be no doubt, 
that It is owing to fome general caufe; and there is as little

rapid, gathers a tail on that fide to which the current flows.

Soil, Cultivation, Minerals, ^c.-Th^ foU the carfe has 
been rendered more produflive. by draining the fwamps, by 
laying a greater quantity of lime annually on the land than 
ufed formerly to be done, and by freighting the ridges in 
feveral places. The foil in the higher grounds is in general 
loam upon a till bottom, and in many places a ftifF till, with- 
out any mixture of W, efpecially where the land is fpouty 
A great part of the upland, fo lately as 20 years ago, was 
covered with furze and broom, which have been grubbed out 
by the farmers, fince the knowledge of improvement, and 
the defire of induftry have been introduced into this coun- 
try ; and their labour has been amply rewarded by abundant 
crops. The land, where furze ufed to grow, is now a ftrong 
generous foil ; and its ftrength may in every cafe be eftima! 
ted by the Cze and luxuriance of the whins, in its natural 
ftate. The foil which carries broom, in its uncultivated ftate, 
is not fo ftrong as the former ; but it is a trufly foil, and 
will make good returns of the ordinary crops, when tenderly 
dealt with, and allowed occaConally to reft in grafs. Where 
whins and broom are mixed, the foil is ftrong or hght, in 
the degree in which either of thefe prevails ; and to encou- 
rage the hufbandman ftill farther, fuch land feldom requires 
draining, where thefe plants are found. Blocks of granite 
have been blown in different places off the higher grounds 
and removed at confiderable expcnce ; and land which was 
lately in a ftate of nature, lets i^ow at a guinea an acre in.

covered drains have been made i but in the clay land the

93. Several perfons. now alive, enjoy good health at the 
age of 80. The people in general are healthy and hardy, 
inured, from their infancy, to the laborious exercifes of agri- 
culture, which, by their improved ftile of living, they are 
not only enabled to undergo with fuccefs, but with comfort 
and eafe. 

Produce^ ^c. — The produce is wheat, barley, oats, peafe, 
beans, clover, and rye grafs ; and in up-lands lefs wheat and 
beans, but in their place more turnips, flax, and potatoes of 
various kinds. — The wheat is fown in the latter end of Sep- 
tember, and during the whole month of Odober, ufually af- 
ter fummer fallow. The farmers begin to fow peafe and 
beans in February, and oats as early in March as the feafon 
will allow. The lowing of barley is generally finifhed by 
the ift of May. Potatoes are planted about the middle of 
May, which is alfo the feafon for the barley feed time in the 
up-land. The turnips are fown in June. The wheat yields 
about 10 bolls an acre, having 8 or 10 chalders of lime laid 
on the preceding fallow. The harveft begins about the mid- 
dle of Auguft, and is finifhed in 6 weeks thereafter, when the 
feafon is favourable. The wheat fells generally at 21s. and 
fometimes more, by the boll ; the barley from 18 s. to 22 s. ; 
meal commonly at i6s. The barley is fometimes fown by 
itfelf, and fometimes mixed with Chefter bear. The oats.

moft frequently cultivated in this parifh, are the old Scotch 
kind. The Cupar Grange fpecies is alfo introduced. The 
beans have always a mixture of about one- third of peafe. 

W^ages and Prices of Proviftons. — Servants wages have rifcn 
confiderably wirhin thefe few years. A bred ploughman 
cannot be hired for a year under 9 I. or 10 1.; a maid-fer- 
vant charges 3 1. and upwards. Common labourers get i s. 
a day and their victuals. Beef fells at between 4 d, and 5 d. 
per lib. ; mutton commonly at 4d.; a pair ef good barn 
fowls at 2s. 6d. ; eggs at 6 d. or 8d. the dozen ; butter at 
lo d. the lib. i and cheefe at 4d. 

Farm Houfes. — The farm houfes have lately undergone 
great improvements, owing to the general fpirit of induftry, 
and the defire of convenience, which has been fpreading for 
fome years through this part of the kingdom, in every de- 
partment of rural economy *. The dwellings are well light- 
ed, and confift of 3 or more apartments ; and the farmers 
have generally a clock in every family, and other furniture 
in proportion, comfortable and convenient. — They have kilns 
for drying grain, with brick floors, and fome with caft iron 
floors. 

Cattle.— 'In the carfe farms, few black cattle are kept, but 
they pay great attention to the rearing of horfes. In the

* About 20 years ago, the houfes were meanly conftrufled, 
without light, without air, and without accommodation, which 
muft have been very injurious to the health of the inhabitants, 
and, together with the wetnefs of the foil, proved the concomu 
tant caufes of premature old age, and of many local diflempers. 
The late Archibald Stirling of Kier, and moll of the other 
CTonrietors, at the end of the laR leafes, inclofed and fubdivided 
the farms, built neat fteadings of houfes in centrical places, and 
covered them with tiles or blue flates.

more elevated parts of the parifli, the farmers rear more 
cows, and pay confiderable attention o the dairy, which to 
them' is a great fource of profit. Their foil is well adapted 
for pafture, whereas the clay foil is more produaive in bear- 
ing crops of grain. There is no mountainous ground in the 
parifli, and therefore there are no fiieep farms fome large 
incisures, which are let to graziers, are flocked with flieep : 
And from the richnefs of their grafs, and their vicinity to 
the market, they make good returns. 

Mofs.—\i is evident, from a variety of circumftances, that 
the flat land in this neighbourhood was formerly covered 
with a ftratum of mofs. This mofs was compofed of the de- 
ciduous parts of trees, which Iprung up from the rich bed 
of clay that was expofed, when the fea retired from that ex- 
tenfive valley, in which the Forth flows from the head of 
Monteath to Borrowftounnefs. Marine fliells are found in 
the body of this clay. The roots of large trees are found 
adhering to its furface, and their trunks and branches are 
mingled with the mofs above ; which is a fufficient proof 
that there was no mofs when the trees were growing *. 

Woods, 

* By what caufe thcfe trees, which in this valley are moftly 
oak, were felled, is not, perhaps, fo evident ; but by whatever 
caufe this took place, when the trees fell, the whole plain mull 
have been an immenfe and wild morafs, when the water from 
the higher grounds was interrupted in its progrefs, and render- 
ed ftagnant by leaves, and branches, and large logs of wood. 
The richnefs of the foil below would foon produce a rank 
growth of t"he long graffes, and other plants peculiar to marfliy 
ground. When the furface was fomewhat confolidated by the 
annual decay of thefe plants, it would become a valt quag-mire, 
acquiring a gradual confiftency, enabling it to carry heath on 
the top. From being flow mois it would become lirmer,^ efpe- 
cially at the fides, where there was lead water, and where the 
mofs was lefs deep, by reafon of the higher ground dipping iiT-

the diRance of the rifing grounds, or other obHru^ftions by 
which the morals wjs inclofed, wherein they were formed. It 
IS an abfurdity to alledge, that peat earth grows, any more than 
other earth. No fpecies of earth has vegetable life. It indeed 
produces plants which have vegetable lii^e, and thefe plants, re- 
turnmg to their firft principles, increafe the mold. The plants 
which grow on dry ground, when not carried off, add to the 
flaple of the foil, and form a mold, fimilar in its qualities to 
that on which they grew; and the plants, which are natural to 
Jand-locked moralfes, (among which that plant, ftriflly called 
P!o/s, is always to be found), the leaves, and branches, and bark 
of trees, where they happen to fall, uniformly produce a black 
mold, known by the name of peat earth. 

In the middle of the carfe of Lecropt, there remained, till of 
late, 60 acres of mofs, originally formed in this manner. The 
people in the adjacent farms were in the praflice of cutting 
peats from it, which rendered the mofs very irregular. The 
low mofs at the fides was from 4 to 6 feet deep, and the high 
mofs in the middle from 7 to lo feet. This mofs was, about 8 
years ago, taken in leafe from Mr Stirling of Kier, by a far- 
mer in the neighbouring parilh. He was baffled at firft iu ma-

and occafjonal fupply of timber for the various purpofes of 
hufbandry. The only tnvh^v trees in the Carfe are faugh,

miniftering to the convenience of the country. There is, par-

beer, and porter, are made — This village is fituated on the 
Allan, a river more remarkable, at this place, for its roman- 
tic fcenery, of a deep glen covered with a variety of wood, 
and its tumultuous current, than for the quantity of its water. 
The Allan, within a ftiort fpace, drives feveral mills, for meal, 
barley, and flour. There are, particularly, 3 mills for making 
a coarfe paper, known by the name of Caliender paper, which 
clothiers ufe in prefling cloth. The village has alfo the ad- 
vantage of being fituated in a plentiful country, near coals, 
and at the reparation of the two great military roads, the one 
going by Callander, to the weft of Scotland, and the other, 
by Crieff, to the north : So that no fituation feems to be bet-

which praaice it feems, from fimilar inftitutions, was not un- 
common in thefe times.

from a variety of caufes, the peculiar tenets of that perfuafioa 
took early a deep root in this neighbourhood. A great va- 
riety of opinions have fprung up fince that period. We have 
Burghers, Antiburghers, Cameronians, Bereans, and perlons 
who adhere to the prefbytery of Relief. But it ought to be 
remarked to their credit, that perfons entertaining all thefe 
different opinions live vsrith thofe of the eftabliftied church, 
and with one another, in friend/hip and brotherly love. The 
acrimony of fpeech, the fournefs of temper, the ftiynefs of in- 
tercourfe, and the relu(5lance to perform good ofiices, which 
charadlerifed religious parties fome years ago, have now given 
place to Chriftian benevolence, and the fvveet intercourle of 
fecial affedtion. The intolerant heat of party zeal has be- 
come more moderate 5 and the mild fpirit, which the gofpel 
breathes, polifhes the ferocity of nature, and fmooths the 
ruggednefs of the human heart. Men have, difcovered, what 
they ought always to have known, that their opinions, with 
regard to fpeculative points, are often as diffc-rent as their 
faces ; and that the harmony of fociety, and the intercourfe 
of life, ought not to be interrupted by the one more than by 
the other J that meeknefs and forbearance become Chriftians; 
that rudenefs of manners is different from purity of morals ; 
that afperity of temper is no mark of foundnefs in the faith ; 
and that it is a precept of the highefl: authority, to « love one 
another.^'

Atniquhies.--An artificial eminence, on the eaft fide of this 
parifli, feems to have been a poll of the Romans, near their 
great road to the church at Ardoch. Kier, already lo of- 
ten mentioned, is one of a chain of rude forts, (which are all 
called Kiers), that run along the north face of the Strath, or 
Valley of Monteath. Thefc forts are at prefent in ruin?, and 
are difccrnible to ftrangers only by knolls of a green (urface, 
covering a great heap of loofe ftones * ; but well known to 
the inhabitants of the country, who carry away the ftones for 
building inclofures and houfes. One of thefe forts was fitua- 
ted at the place of Kier. There are alfo Kiers at Achinfalt f, 
at Borland at Balinachader at Tar \\, and in many other 
places in that dirediion, all fimilar to one another, in refpeiSt 
of fituation, conftru(5lion, profpe£t, and materials; which is a

fpring of water, or a running brook, and commanded ^n exten-

quarter, it is probable, no danger was apprehended.

good price and ready money, for whatever they can fpare for 
fale. They are near plenty of coal, which contributes to their 
domeaic cooifort; and abundance of cheap linie enables them 
to improve their ground.— Bad roads are a great difadvan- 
tage. Another inconvenience, no lefs feverely felt, is the 
want of good water in the Carfe. There is but one fmall ri- 
vulet in the pariih, which is employed in carrying away the

Caledonian line was about 3 or 4 hours match, in moll places, 
from the Roman wall ; and this chain of forts, whether it was 
conllrufled by Galgacus, who was no his fagacious thui

decency and fobriety. None have been banifhed, or hav^ 
fuffered the higher pains of law, in any other rcfpedt, for 
mifconduft, in the memory of man. Remote from the temp- 
tations and lurking places of great towns, where the profli- 
gate expeft to elude the eye of the world, and to efcape the 
lafli of the law, in a crowded population, every man confiders 
himfelf as known to his neighbours, and that he has both his 
own reputation, and the credit of his anceftors, to fupport by 
his condu£l. Habits of induftry have become familiar to the 
people, whatever obje6l they have in view. In literature 
they have not been deficient, when their genius led them to 
the purfuit of ftudy, and the improvement of the mind. One 
minifter, one preacher, and three ftudents, .now alive, drew 
their firft breath in this parifti. — A ^remarkable change has 
lately taken place in the article of drefs. The love of (how 
is natural ; and imaginary wants are fometimes no lefs cla- 
morous than thofe which are real. But, if the increale of 
their earnings do not furnifli the labouring part of mankind 
with this increafe of luxury, their favings, upon which they 
are to begin the world, muft be lefs at prcfent than when their 
wages -were more moderate, and tjieir clothing lefs expen-

Name, Situation, and Extent. 

ABOUT a quarter of a mile to the fouth of Prcfton-pans 
ftands the village of Preston, which, though at 
prefent but fmall, was formerly of confiderable extent. When 
fait pans were ere(5led in its neighbourhood, they would na- 
turally be dlliinguillied by its name. The building of the 
town of Prefton-pans is fuppofed to have taken place after 
that of the fait pans. In the laft century, and at the begin- 
ning of the prefent, the town was commonly named Sa/t- 
Prejlon. Of the origin of the name of Prefton, nothing fa- 
tisfa^lory can be traced. — This parifli is near 3 miles in

Agriculture —Tht rotation of crops, moft approved of at 
prefent, is a white and green crop alternately Fallowing is 
httle praaifed. The land is cleared of weeds, by fowing in 
dnlls, and horfe-hoeing the interftices ; and women are often 
employed to pick them out with the hand. The land de- 
igned for wheat is ploughed as foon as it is cleared of the 
preceding crop. If the land is heavy, the wheat is fown about 
the middle of Oaober; if light, about the beginning of Nov. 
The land defigned for oats, pcafe, and beans, is plowed in 
February. Oats are fown about the end of March and be- 
ginning of April. If the land is dry, peafe and beans are 
fown in drills as early as poffible in February j when broad- 
cnft, they are fown early in March. When peafe and beans 
are to be fown in drills, fbmetimes the land gets two plow- 
ings, the firft after harveft, the fecond at the time of fowing, 
the feed being thrown into every third furrow. The land 
^lefigned for barley is three times plbwed. The firft 
plowing takes place immediately after harveft ; the fecond 
in the fpring, as foon as the land is dry, commonly at the 
end of March or beginning of April. If the land be fii.0i- 
ciently dry, March is reckoned preferable. After this fecond 
plowing it is harrowed. The third plowing takes place

heavy ; about the middle, if it be light. Scotch barley is 
dually Town about the beginning of May in heavy lands ; 
later in proportion they are lighter; and in the lighteft, 
not till the end of May. Potatoes are planted con.monly 
after the fecond plowing of the baney land, though the 
beft fealbn is reckoned to be about the end of April or be- 
ginnivig of IV'ay. Turnips are Town the firft or iecond week 
of June. When the land has not been fun)mer tallowed, 
one boll of wheat or barley, one boll and h.lf of peafe at 
leaft, and rather more than 5 firlots of oats, are fown upon 
an acre; when lumtner fallo*ed, fouiewhat lefs than 3 fir- 
lots of wheat or bsrky ; when grafs feeds are fown, an acre 
takes about »6 or 18 hb. weight of clover, and one peck of 
rye-grafb. Dung is the chief manure. The quantity requi- 
fite for an acre is about 26 two horfe cart-loads of good fta- 
ble dung. The land inclining to clay requires fomewhat

of Ai!guit, and ends on the firft or fecond week of Oftober. 
In the year 178s, early oats wer6 intro duced here. They 
were ibwn on the 5th of April, and reaped on the 21ft of 
July, in the ye.ir following thty were fown on the 31ft 
of M;.rch, and reaped on the 25th of July. The harveft 
for the other grain was in the fame proportion later than in 
the former year. Thefe oats, being ripe fo much fooner 
than the other kinds of grain, fuffered fo greatly from the 
birds, that the fowing of them was difcontinued.

to 3 I. 10 s. per acre. Almoft all the pariOi is inclofed.' 
Walls built of ftone and mortar form a great part of the in- 
clofures. They are an immediate fence, take up lefs room 
than hedges, and afford no fhelter to birds. The common 
height is 41 feet above the furface. The price of building is 
3 1. 5 s. per rood, materials furniflied by the builder. In- 
clofures have confiderably increafed the rent of the lands. 
The ftate of property has been fluduating. Within the 
prefent century, the whole lands in the pariOi, with the ex- 
ception of 4 or 5 acres, have been fold once, and fomeof the 
eftates much oftener.

Prices of Grain and Provifions. — The price of grain is, in 
a great meafure, regulated by the higheft fiars of Eaft Lo- 
thian. Beef iells from 3d. to 4^ d. pet- lib. ; mutton and 
veal, from 3 d. to 5 d. ; pork, from 3 d. to 4 d. •, good lamb, 
from 13. to 3 s. per quarter ; fowls, I s. fometimes more \

is feldom under 9 d. per hb. 20 ounce Dutch. 

ManufaBuhs. — There are at prefent 10 Salt Pans in 
the parifh, but only 6 are wrought. When the weather 
is dry, and the coal good, a pan may be drawn 5 times in a 
week. Each draught requires 3 fiihngs of water, and yields, 
in fummer, about i8bulhelsf, in winter about 16. The 
difference is owing to the fca water being ftronger in fummer 
than in winter : For the fame reafon, in winter it requires 
26 or 28 hours to a draught ; in fummer only 20 or 22. The 
procefs is fometimes retarded by the badnefs of the coal. 
When the fea water is good, a Scotch gallon of it will yield 
of fait nearly one lib. Avoirdupois. The draught confumes

from 18 to 26 bolls of fmall coal or culm. The price of the 
coal is about 8 d. per boll, when laid down at the pan. Two 
men are employed in working a pan ; their joint wages from 
17 s. to 20 s. per week. From the time the fak is drawn 
till it is fold, the wafte by lying in the girnel is computed at 
1 bufhel in 10. The better the fak is made, the wafte is the 
lefs. When it is conveyed by land, a high wind occafions.a 
greater wafte than a moderate rain. Three buftiels in 40 
were formerly allowed for wafte, when it was carried coaft- 
ways. A late ad of Parliament reduces the allowance to 1 in 
40. The original coaft of a fait pan amounts to about 300 1. 
Sterling ; and once in 3 years it cofts about 40 I. for repairs. 
The price of fait at prefent, duty included, is 3 s. per bulliel. 
The average made in this parifti, during the 5 Lift years, is 
10,750 bufliels 4 gallons per year. 

A manufadlure of ^one ivare is carried on a little to the weft 
of the church. It commenced about 40 years ago, and belongs 
to Meflrs. Cadell. White ftone ware, and cream coloured 
ware, (of late the laft chiefly) are manufa6lured. About 40 
men, and upwards of 30 boys, are employed. The wages 
of the men are from 6 s. to 15 s. per week. Some of them, 
when working by the piece, earn more than 15 s. The wa- 
ges of the boys are from i s. to 2 s. per week. The boys are 
taken at 8 years of age, and continue till they are 14 or 15, 
when they are either bound as apprentices, or go to other 
occupations. About 24 tons of coals are confumed per 
week ; the price is 5 s. 6 d. per ton, when laid down at the 
work. The clay ufed in the manufacture is brougkt from 
Devonfliire, the flint from Gravelend ; white and red lead 
from London, Hull, and Newcaftle. The price of the clay 
is 10 s. per ton, freight 14 s. per ditto ; the price of the flint 
is 1 8 s. and 20 s. per ton, freight 8 s. per ditto. Fire clay is 
found in great plenty in the neighbourhood. This manu- 
facture 



of Prefio7i-pans, 



faflure circulates upwards of 25 1. per week. At MorlWs 
Haven there is another manufadure of the fame kind, with 
the addition of broivn ware *. About half the number of 
men and beys are employed as at the former. Clay for the 
brown wnre is found hard by the work. A third manufac- 
ture of the above articles was carried on at the Cuttle, but 
has been difcontimed for a year or two; it is, however, a- 
bout to be refumed. The fales, for- articles of earthen ware, 
are computed at upwards of ^(.00 \- per annum. Befides the 
Scotch market, the ware is exported to ir.oft of the fea ports 
in Europe, to the Weft Indies, and to North America. — 
There is a brkh and tile -work adjoining to the old church- 
yard. Six men are employed. The wages of each, at a 
medium, are is. per day. This leafonM 3 kilns were fired 
with lilcs, each kiln containing 10,000. Of bricks 107,000 
were made. Each kiln with tiles ccnfumed 2 1 cart-loads of 
coals, at 3 s. 6 d. per cart-load of 12 cwt. One cart load, 
partly great coal, partly culm, is required, at an average, for 
3000 bricks. A little to the weft of the above there is an- 
other tile-work by the fea-fide, where 9 kilns were fired, 
each kiln containing 9000 tiles, and confuming 20 cart-loads 
of coals. Three men are employed at 7 s. each per week. 
Tiles, including a duty of 8 s. are fold at the r;ite of 2 I. i ' . 
per thoufand. Bricks, including a duty of 2 s. 6 d. at the 
rate of 17 s. 6d. per thouland.

folely to the oil of vitriol ; of late it has been extended to the 
other articles above mentioned, as well as to lukite afies and 
Glauber falts. Upwards of 50 men are employed about the 
works. Some of them are occupied during the day, and 
fome of them during the night ; becaufe great part of the 
operations require conftafit attendance. They are bound 
under indentures for 21 years, during which time they are 
paid weekly 6 s. for ftatcd wages, with a proportional allowr 
ante for extra work, in which they are frequently employed. 
Brimft one and faltpetre are the raw materials ufed in the 
manufadlure of oil of vitriol. The faltpetre is piirchafed 
chiefly at London at the Eaft India Company's fales. The 
brimftone is imported from Leghorn. About 60 tons of 
coals are confumed per week. Each bottle of oil of vitriol 
contains, at a medium, 140 lb. EngHfli weight ; of aqua- 
fortis, about 100 lb. ; of fpirit of fait about 100 lb. The 
prices of the articles vary according to the price of the 
materials. At prefent oil of vitriol is fold at 3 Id. per lb, ; 
aquafortis at from 74 d. to ic d. per lb. ; fpirit of fait at 6d. 
per ib, with 3 s. for each bottle and bafket 5 Glauber falts at

fiffjerles.— The chief fifliery is that of o^ers. There are 
at prefent lO oyfter boats belonging to the parifti. Each boat 
requires 5 men but the profits are divided into 6 (hares, 
one (hare being applied for upholding the boat There 
are not, however, above 23 regular fifhermen ; all the other, 
.vork occafionally on land or fea, as they find moft for the.r 
advantage. A boat feldom returns with more than 400 or 
500, often wich fewer*. The prefent price is 15 d. per 
hundred. A hundred, as fold by the fifhers, contams 33 
,varp, equal lo fix fcore and twelve. The retail hundred 
contains only 30 warp. Four oyfiers make a warp. Three 
or four times in a feafon, a boat fails with a cargo of them,

* About 20 years ago. the fcalps were fo produclive that 
6coo oyfters and upwards were frequently dragged by one boat 
in a day. The price at that time was 6 d. per hunared. 13e- 
fides the confumption in the neighbourhood, they were export- 
ed to Newcaftle, Hull, and London. A merchant at Leith, m 
the year 1773, contiafled lo fliip oyaers on comiuiBion lor 
London. ' He purchaled for 10 different companies, and for 10 
years paid 2500I. Sterling fier a««K»/ for oyfters. The value 
of the home confumption was eftimated to be flill greater. For- 
ty beats were then employed, of which 16 belonged to Coc- 
ken7ie in the parilh of Tranent ; 1 6 to Prefton-paus, Cuttle, and 
Weft Pans ; and 8 to Fifherrow. The oyfters for the London 
market were packed in barrrls. Twelve velTels were employed 
in the trade, from the middle of January to the middle of May. 
Each veflel carried, at a medium, 320 barrels ; each barrel waS 
fuppofed to contain 120c ftzeable oyfters. A pattern was given 
to eveiy boat, with iiijuncaions to barrel none of a fmaller lize ; 
but thel'e injiinaions were lar from being ftridly obferved. 
Thirty cargoes have been fliipped in a feafon. The oyfters 
were dropt in bays at the mouth of the Thames and Medw.iy, 
and other grounds, to fatten until the fall, when they were 
dredged and fent to market. This trade was given up in the 
year 1786, owing to the fcarcity and advanced prices of oyfters, 
the price having rifen from 4 s. 6 d. to 7 s- and 8 s. per barrel. 
During fome of the laft years in which it was carried on, part 
of ihe cargoes were made up of oyfters from Newhaven. The 
Icalps were greatly exhaufted by this trade.

-It :s an open boat *. n^anned with 6 men. It brings no car- 
go homewards , being open there is nothing to defend goods 
fro;r. damage. The prelent price at Newcaftle is 2 s per 
hundred. Oyders are carried to Glafgo-.v by land. Two 
earners, wuh 4 one-horft carts, come from Glafgow toEdin- 
bnrga w.tb goods, and return loaded with oyfters, which 
they purchafe at Prefton.pans and Cockenzie. The medium 
is about 9000 in each cart. Oyfters are found on a ftrong 
clay bottom, cn rocks and ftones, and fometimes, though 
but fclnnly, in what is called by the fifhers fea taihe, Thefe 
laft are of a very inferior rpality. Thofe caught neareft to 
the town are ufually the largeft and fatteft ; hence the large 
ones obtained the name of Pandoors, i. e. oyfters caught at 
the doors of the pans. The fea water, a little frcftiened, is 
reckoned the moft nourifhing to oyfters. This may be one 
reafon why thofe caught near to the town and fhcre are fo 
large. Sand is prejudicial to them. The fiOicrs dredge 
from 4 to 15 fathoms depth of water. When they drive the 
dredge, they begin the oyfter fong, which they fing till the 
dredge is hauled up. The large oyfters are picked out and 
kept ; thofe that are too fmall for prefent ufe, are thrown 
back into the fea. An oyfter is reckoned fizeable, when its 
fliell is an inch and a half in diameter. Buckies, clams, fea- 
urchins, ftar-fifti, and corfe-fifli, are found in the oyfter beds. 
The two laft mentioned, efpecially the corfe-fifli, prey on' 
oyfters, and likewife on mufcles. The fcalps reach from the 
fliore about 6 miles into the Frith, and extend both to the 
eaft and weft of the boundaries of this parifii. In May the 
oyfters caft their fpat or fpawn. They are fickly in June and

July ; but recover in Auguft. For this reafon, the proper 
reafon for dredging commences on the iftof September, and 
ends on the laft of April. The common obfervation is, that 
the oyfter feafon^ lafts during all the months in which the 
letter R occurs. But the fifliers have not confined them- 
felves flri£lly to thefe months ; and this is another caufe of 
the fcarcity *. That the fcalps may recover, it would be 
proper to dredge very fparingly for a year or two, to take no 
ovfters but fuch as are fizeable, and at no time to dredge ia 
the months of May, June, July, and Auguft. The young 
fry are faid to acquire fliells in 24 hours; but do not become 
falcable in lefs than 2 or 3 years. Oyfter ftiells make an 
excellent lime, remarkable for its whitenefs. They are ufed 
likewife as a medicine — Befides oyfters, many other kinds 
of filh f are caught in their feafon ; cod, Ikare, flounders, 
whitings, mackerel, lobfters, and crabs. 

Boats,— Ihc oyfter boats are of diS'erent dimenfions.

* Some of the aged inhabitants report, that, about 60 or 70 
years ago, oyfters were in little eftimation. In a judicial de- 
claration, emitted A. D. 1776, by a refidenter here, then 67 
years old, he deponed, that he remembered when there were 
rot above 3 or 4 boats employed : That they feldom caught 
above 6co in a day ; and that there was little or no demand, or 
fale for them, at that period. 

-j- Haddocks formerly were plentiful, but of late years they 
have not appeared. Two years ago herrings were caught in 
great numbers near the town, in the month of Auguft. Ia 
the parifti records it is narrated, that in the fame month, A. D. 
1695, the herrings approached fo near to the Ihore, that the in- 
habitants went out with fieves and riddles to catch them. It is 
impoffible to fpecify the prices of the laft mentioned kinds of 
fith, as they depend on the quantity caught, and, of confe- 
qucnce, vary every day. It is certain, however, that the prices ' 
are more than tripled within thefe 20 years.

came trade meafures 33 feet in keel, 38 aloft from ftem to 
ftern, 1 2 feet 9 inches in breadth, and 4 feet 8 inches in 
depth. 

Harbour. — The only harbour in the parifh is Morison's 
Haven, fo called from a family of the name of Morifon, 
who were formerly proprietors of the eflate of Preftongrange. 
About 80 or 90 years ago, it was called Ntiuhaven^ and often 
' Acheson's Haven, from an ancient family, the progenitors 
of the prefent Lord Vifcount Gosford in Ireland *. It is fi- 
tuated a little to the weft of the town. It has about 10 feet of 
water at ftream tides, but might be deepened fo as to draw 
12. It is reckoned one of the fafeft harbours in the Frith. 

Trade f. — The exports at prefent are only fifli, and the 
different articles of nianufa£ture which have been already

* Gosford, which was a principal feat of this antient family, lies 
5 miles eaft of this, in the parifti of Aberlady. Their Scotch title 
was Glcncaimey. Mr Alexander Aitchison of Edinburgh, 
now claims being the lineal reprefentative of this family in Scot- 
land. 

f Before, the Union, a confiderable foreign trade was carried 
on here, efpecially in Dutch and French goods. Befides the 
home market, thefe goods, together with fait and tobacco, were 
carried to the north of England, and many of them were fmug- 
gled into that kingdom with great profit to the adventurers. 
From England they brought wool, and exported it to France. 
They exported likewife malt, fall, and coals. In confequence 
of the duties that were impofed after the Union, the trade, ef- 
pecially with England, was much lefs advantageous. It was, 
notwithftanding, ftill carried ou to a confiderable extent. In 
the year 17 19, 41 cargoes were delivered at the port; of Pref-

barley, oats, potatoes, and hay, arc fuppofed to be confumed 
than are raifed in the parifh : Lefs peafe and beans. Con- 
fiderable quantities of cabbage plants are raifed. The {tTiion 
of fowing them is Lammas. Befides the fale in the neigh- 
bourhood, 150,000 at a medium are fent annually to Gla(^ 
gow, and about 70,000 to Falkirk and Carron. The feverer 
the winter, the demand for them is the greater. The price 
is from 3 s. to 6 s. 8 d. per 1000. The principal market for 
garden produdlions is Edinburgh, 

Cujlom-Houfe. — A cuftom-houfe is eftablifhed here, the ju- 
rifdidtion of which extends from the Figgat Bourn on the® 
weft, to the mouth of the Tyne on the caft. The pprt is 
Morifoo's Haven : The creeks, the Figgat Bourn, Muflel- 
burgh, Port-Seton., Aberlaciy, and North Berwick. There 

Vol. XVII. K are 

ton-pans, 19 of which were imported in fhips belonging to the 
town. Of thefe cargoes 21 were wholly from Norway, 6 from 
Sweden, 1 from Dantzic, 2 from Dantzic and Norway, 2 from 
Bremen, 5 from Rotterdam, 2 from Havre de Grace and St. 
Martin, i from Oporto, and i from Maryland in North Ameri- 
ca. This laft cargo confided of 102 hoglheads of tobacco, 59 
of which were delivered at Prefton-pans, and the remainder was 
carried to Leith. Some years after this period, leveral of the 
veflels belonging to this port were loft at fea. This, together 
with the check it received at the Union, gave the trade a blow 
from which it never recovered. No perfon of entcrprife or ca- 
pacity, or pofTeffed of a fufficient ftock, made any perfevering 
efforts to re-eftablilh it. Purchafers not finding fuch an affort- 
ment of goods as formerly, had recourfe to other ports; and a. 
bout the year « 743. it entirely ceafed. The harbour moftly 
ufed by the traders was Port-Seton, about a mile to the eaft, in 
the parifb of Tranent. Before the Union, and for fome years 
after :t, the Dutch trade centered chiefly in Prellon-nans and 
Queensferry,

Prefton-pans, 2 at Cuttle. 4 at Weft Pans, 4 to the weft of 
Fiftierrow at Pinkie Pans, and 6 at Duddingfton Pans. 

Markets, Mills, b'f.— There is a butcher market in the 
parifti every Wednefday and Saturday, which is fupplied by 
butchers from Tranent and JVIufTelburgh, no perfon of that 
occupation refiding in the parifli. Though nine tenths of 
the lands are rented, there is not one family who depend for 
their livelihood folely on farming.— There are only 5 brewers 
in the parifti *. There are two mills, one of which, at the 
weft end of Cuttle, is turned by the water of a coal-level ; 
the other, at Morifon's Haven, is turned by the fea water, 
collefted at the flow of the tide. They are employed in 
grinding flint for the ufe of the potteries. 

Stage and Tolls. — A ftage coach goes to Edinburgh and re- 
turns every day in the week, except Sunday, It departs at 
9 o'clock in the morning, and ?.; rives at Edinburgh aboiir 11., 
It leaves Edinburgh at 4 in the afternoon, and arrives ar Pref-

Church and School.~Tht great body of the people adhere 
to the eftabliflied church. About a twentieth part of the

Poor. — The number of poor oa the ftated penfion lift 
amounts to 42. Their penfions are fettled by the kirk-feffion, 
and are increafed or diminifhed as their circumftances re- 
quire. No penlioner with a family receives at prefent more 
than 2 s. per week, and no individual more than is. 4d.

'^^ ^ Siatiftical Account 

of a houfc and garden at Prefton * ; and perqulfites fcJr mort- 
cloths. Frorn thefe funds, a fum of nearly 30 1. per annum 

s appropnated for the ftated poor. The refidu; is left in 
the hands of the kirk-feffion, to be diftributed, as an interim 
iupply, to thofe who are fuddenly reduced to want by mif- 
fortune or difcafe. Out of it. likewife. are paid fmall falaries 
to the feffion-clerk, precentor, and beadle; fchool wages for 
the education of a few poor fcholars ; fums occafionally for 
clothes to the poor; and the funeral expences of the pen- 
fioned poor. In addition to the 30 1. above mentioned, the 
heritors and feue^s are affefTed to the amount of what more 
IS necefTary for the maintenance of tTae ftated poor. The he- 
ntors are afTcITed in proportion to their valued rents ; the 
feuers in proportion to the value of their fubjeas. The pro- 
portion paid by the latter is to that paid by the former, as t 
to 6 ; correfponding to the fuppofed value of their different 
properties. Houfes belonging to heritors, for which they 
draw rent, (their family feats excepted,) are afleffed after the 

fame 

of every parift in which he had property. In the bequeft a 
right of prefentmg the poor perfon. or perfons, to whom the 
intereft of it is to be given, is referved to the heir of entail. 

* A. D. 1753, the heritors, and fome of the feuers, applied 
to Parliament, and obtained aa ad for impofing a duty of two 
pennies Scotch on each Scotch pint of ale brewed, broueht in- 
to and vended m the parilh; the money arifing from whi?h was 
to be applied for repayment of a fum to be advanced for pur- 
chaling a chanty work houfe, for conveying foft water to the 
town of Prellon-pans, and for repairing Morifon's Haven For 
the firft mentioned purpofe a houfe was purchafed at Preflon 
with a fmall garden ; but, after a trial of a few years the fcheme 
not anfwermg, it was givei up. Befides the utter averfion which 
many m aclual want had againft entering into the houfe the 
espence was found to be greater than when the penfioners had 
a ftated allowance given to them, and were permitted to fpend 
It alter tbcir own way. Since that time, the rent of the houfe 
and garden have made a part of the poor's fund.

fame manner as thofe of the feuers, and are included with 
them in the payment of the fixth part of the afleffinent. The 
afleffing of thele fubjeds by the real rents was confidered as 
ineligible for many reafons. When a proprietor occupies his 
own houfe, it is difficult to afccrtain what the rent ought to 
be. Tenants and landlords may not always be difpofed to 
give the neceffary information, efpecially when they have an 
intereft in with-holding it. Even where the rent is afcertain- 
ed, there muft be a difference in affeffing old and new houfes, 
though the rents be equal, on account of the neceffary repa- 
rations which the former require. This it is not eafy to ap- 
preciate. Ten per cent, may be an equitable dedudlion for 
one houfe, but not for another. For thefe reafons, the other 
mode of affeffing, by the value of the fubje£ls, was adopted 
about 8 years ago, and the proportion, with concurrence of 
the heritors, fettled as it now ftands. The value of the fub- 
je£t, or fubjedls, belonging to each individual, is eftimated by 
perfons of Ikill and of charafter ; and the affeffment is levied 
in proportion. The medium of the whole difburfements to 
the account of the poor, for the 5 years preceding 1793, is 
about 137 1. Sterling per annum. The fum paid as the week- 
ly maintenance of the ftated poor, for the prefent year (1792), 
is 2 1. I s. 6 d. ; which is lefs than it has been for many years 
paft *.

* During the years 1782' and 1783, owing to the fcarcity 
which then diftreffed the country, the number of the poor, and 
the fum neceffary lor their fupport, was greatly increafed. 'The 
rate for aated penfioners, in 1783, amounted to 3 1. 10 s. per 
week, befides what was given to the occafional poor. The num- 
ber of poor continued to be greater than ufual for feveral years 
afterwards.

fortable allowance till he is again able to work : And, in the 
€vent of his death, or that of any of his family, a fum of 
money is given, to help in defraying the expence of the fu- 
neral. There is an abufe to which inftitutions of this fort 
are liable, which ought to be guarded againft, viz. permitting 
fubfcribers to become members of more focieties than one, 
which may furnifh a temptation to the indolent and avari- 
cious, to feign indifpofitions difficult to be detefted, and, of 
confequence, occafion a mifapplication of the fund. 

Charitable Foundation — ^James Schaw, proprietor of the 
cftate of Prefton, bequeathed the lands and barony of Pref- 
ton, with the refidue of fome other funds, for maintaining 
and educating boys, whofe parents are in poor circumftances. 
He died A. D. 1784. The houfe of Prefton was, according 
to the terms of the deed, fitted up for the reception of the 
boys; and the eftablifhment commenced in February 1789. 
There is a mafter, houfc-keeper, and two maid fervants. At 
firft 15 boys were admitted. The number was afterwards 
increafed to 24. Two have died. They are taught Englifh, 
writing, and arithmetic j and, as they grow up, fome manual 
employment, viz. to knit flockingsj to mend their clothes 
and (hoes, &amp;c. Four names have a preference, in the fol- 
lowing order: Schaw^ Macneily Cuningham^ and Stewart. The 
age of admiffion is from 4 to 7. They may remain in the 
houfe till they are 14. They muft be free from the King's 
evil, and from all contagious diftempers. The truftees are 
empowered to bind them as apprentices, or otherwife to fet 
them out to bufinefs, as they fliall judge beft.

chapmen of the three Lothians meet annually at Prefton- 
pans and eleft fome of their number, for the purpofe o£ 
holding courts to enforce the obfervance of bye-laws, to which 
they are bound at their entrance into the fociety. They elefV, 
on this occafion, a provoft or prefes, a depute, a clerk, a 
trealurer, 6 bailies, aqd feveral counlellors. There is one 
bailie for Prefton-pans and Cockenzie j one for Haddington 
and North Berwick; one for Dunbar and Oldhamftocksi 
one tor Mullelburgh and Dalkeith; one for Queensferry and 
Borrowltounnels; and one for Linlithgow and Bathgate. Af- 
ter the election they march in a body, preceded by mufic, to 
the crols at Prciton, there drink a few bottles of wine, and 
then return. In the towns where their booths are erected at 
fairs, the bailie for that town gets a pawn from each chap- 
man, who is bound to attend a meeting of the whole num- 
ber, at an appointed hour in the evening, or next morning. 
Here the behaviour of each during the fair is inquired into. 
If any of the bye-laws have been tranfgrelTed, a fine is cxafled 
and paid. If the offence has been grofs, they are expelled. 
The fines arc depofited in the hands of the treafurer, and arc 

applied 

• The place of meeting, formerly, was in an open field ad- 
joining to Prefton, on the fecond Thurfday of October, at which 
lime a fair Wis held there, called St. Jerome's Fair About 
the year 1732, this fair was transferred to Prefton-pans, where 
it v,.s held for about 20 years, and was then given up. No in- 
formation has been obtained, that can be depended on, as to the 
tin e when this fociety was firlt inftituted, nor how they came 
to hold their annual meeting at Prefton. The members re- 
fiding in Eaft Lothian were always the moft numerous, which 
might be a reafon for holding che meeting in this county; and 
Prefton, being fituated at its weRern extremity, is the town 
neareft to the other two Lothians. In the year 1636, they ac- 
quired a right to the Crofs there, which they ftill preferve. So 
much is Prefton now decayed, that this crofs ftands in a field. 
The number of pack-horfe chapmen is much fewer than it once 
was, and they are ftill on the decline. About 50 years ago, 
fhere were 1^ in Eaft Lothian, all of whom had a good trad^.

applied to relieve the widows or families of thofe members 
of the fociety who need fupply, and fometimes thofe who 
have been unfuccefsful in bufinefs. They cannot proceed to 
an eledion unlefs fome married members be prefent; but the 
prefes is ufually chofen from among the unmarried j it being 
fuppofed, that thofe of this defcription will more readily at- 
tend the fairs. When a new member is admitted, he pays 
fome entry-money, which is added to the common ftock : 
The fon of a member pays lefs than a ftranger. At prefent, 
the number in Eaft Lothian who keep pack horfes docs not 
exceed 6. Perfons living in the country are now more in 
the praaice of purchafing articles of mcrchandife in towns, 
where the affortments are better, and to which the accefs is, 
by good roads, rendered more eafy than it formerly was. 
The whole members of this fociety at prefent are about 24 
in number. 



Battle of PreJion.^On the eaft of the inclofures of Prefton 
was fought the battle of Prefton, A. D. 1745, in which the 
army of the Rebels obtained the vidlory over the King's for- 
ces. The action began early in the morning of the 21ft of 
September, O. S. The Highlanders, in their accounts, ufu- 
ally gave it the name of the Battle of Gladfmuir ; though 
Gladfmuir is at leaft 3 miles diftant from the fcene of aflion. 
There was, it feems, a tradition among them, that a battle 
was to be fought on the Moot- of the GledeSy which, in the 
iffue, would infure to the rightful Sovereign the peaceable 
pofleffion of his throne. They made the application that 
was moft favourable to their views. 

Eminent Men. — This parilh has been the refidence of fe- 
veral men of eminence, viz. the Honourable James Erskine

He was afterwards appointed one of the Senators of the Col- 
lege of Juftice, and one of the Lords CommiiTioners of Jufr 
ticiary* Some gentlemen, of the firft merit in their feveral 
' lines of life, were educated at the fchool here, viz. the late 
Colonel Campbell Dalrymple, youngeft fon of Lord 
Drummore, who was GoverrJour of Guadaloupe after it was 
taken in the war of 1756; Sir Robert Murray Keith, 
anci his brother Sir Basil Keith ; the laft of whom, after 
an honourable life in the navy, died Governour tsf Jamaica. 
The firft ftill lurvives, an honour to the corps diplomatique, 
as a member of which he has done eminent fervices to his 
King and country. 

Minerals. — There is plenty of coal, particularly in the eflate 
of Prefton-grange \ but none is wrought at prefent, nor has 
been for more than 30 years. The parifh is fupplied with 
this article from the pits in the parifhes of Tranent and, In- 
verelk. Whin-ftone rock is al£b found here. There do not 
appear to be any free ftone quarries worth the working. 

Advantages and Difadvantages. — Among the advantages are 
to be reckoned the fifhery, and vicinity of coal. Among the

difadvantages, the fcarcity of foft water. The convenience 
for fea bathing is alfo a confiderable advantage, as it renders 
the town much reforted to in fummer. The accefs to the 
fea is immediate. At high tide it flows clofe to the town/ 
and even at low tide does not recede to a great diftance. 

Pcptilation. — From accurate lifts taken this year (1792) 
compared with the return to Dr Webfter in 1755, the popu- 
lation of this pariQi appears to have increafed above one-fifth

Sheep and Wages. — The number of fheep in the parifh la 
about 12,000 j they are of the long white-faced kind, which 
bear the fliort clothing wool. The breed has been much 
meliorated of late, by means of rams got from the borders of 
the Cheviot hills, and the wool now fells at from 14s. to 17s. 
per ftone. A common labourer will earn 14 d. per day in 
fummer, and rod. in winter. A man-fervant employed in 
farm work, gets from 6 1- to 7 1. per annum^ with viftuals ; a 
maid-fervant, from 3 1. 10 s. to 4 1. 10 s. A fhepherd, on a 
farm where the mafter refides, inftead of wages, is allowed 
to keep fheep; and on a led farm, is allowed three fcore 
' and ten, and a milk cow, which may be valued at 18 1. 

Proprietors^ Rent, — There are 1 1 heritors in the parifh, 
and, except the Duke of Buccleugh, all the principal ones re^ 
fide in it. The valued rent is 18,921!. i6s. 8 d. Scotch. 
The real rent is about 4700 1. Sterling. 

Population.— The number of births, deaths, and marriages, 
cannot be precifely afcertaincd, as few of the Seceders enter 
their childrens names in the parifh regifter. From Dr Web- 
jfter's report, however, it is certain, that the population of the 
parifh has increafed confiderably within thefe 40 years. The

the duty, is partly paid by the Duke of Buccleugh, and the mi- 
nifters of Cavers and Hawick, and partly from a fubfcriptipn 
by the people. The number of poor receiving weekly ftipport 
is about 40, for which the heritors affefs themfelves, to the 
amount of 140 1. yearly. The weekly collections arc given 
by the kirk-feffion to the poor not belonging to the lift of 
penfioners.— 1 here is, in the village of Denholm, a Camero- 
nian meeting-houle, which is attended by feveral of the in- 
habitants and neighbourhood, who are between 2 and 3 miles 
diftant from the kirk j few of them, however, join in com- 
munion with them. 

Eminent Men.— l.oxA Heathfield *, fo juftly famed for his 
military exertions, particularly his gallant defence of Gibral- 
tar, 

* George Augustus Eliott, Lord Heathfield, the 9th 
fon of Sir Gilbert Eliott, Bart, of Stobs, was born at the pater- 
nal eftate in the year 1 7 1 8. He ftewed an early inclination for 
a military life, and foon became an officer in the 23d regiment 
of foot, the Royal Weifli Fiifileers. He left this regiment, and 
went into the corps of engineers at Woolwich, where he conti- 
nued til! the year 1740, -when he became adjutant in the 2d 
troop of horfe guards. He ferved in Germany, and was woun- 
ded at the battles of Dittengen and Fontenoy. In March 1759, 
he was appointed to the 15th regiment of light dragoons ; and, 
in the Auguft following, headed the fecond line of horfe under 
the Marquis of Granby, at the battle of Minden. Being con- 
ftituted a lieutenant general, he was, in 1762, ordered from 
Germany, for the parpofe of afflfting, as fecond in command, 
at the memorable redu«fllon of the Havannah. He was ap- 
pointed Commander in Chief in Ireland in 1774, but being dif- 
guHed, on his arrival, he made a requeft to be recalled, which 
was complied with; and, upon the death of Lord Cornwallis, 
he was made Governor of Gibrakar in his place, which fortrefs 
he bravely defended during the late fiege, in the years 1779. 
1780, 1781, and 1782. In 1783, he was granted a penfion of 
2000 1. per annum, and created a Knight of the Bath ; and, in 
1 787, was raifed to the dignity of a peer of Great Britain. The

family of Stobs, now reprelented by Sir William Eliott, Bart, 
one of the principal heritors of this parifh. 

Antiquities — The remains of the Roman or Saxon forfifi- 
cation, called Catraih runs through this parHh, from S W, 
to N. W. towards Selkirk and Galla Water. There are fe- 
veral camps to be found in the upper part of this parifii. 
Some of them appear to have been Roman camps, and others 
Saxon *. 

NUM- 



hononrs which he had thus juflly acquired, he did not long en- 
joy, for he died in the year 1790. 

* At a place called Carienrigg, a number of Roman urns 
were dug up about 5 years ago; but when thefe camps were 
formed, or the urns depofited, the prefei.t incumbent has never 
been able to difrover. At Prieft-haugh. a great number of gold 
coins were found, fuppofed to have been depofited by fome of 
the attendants nf Qi^ieen Mary, when fhe vifited Bothwell at the 
Hermitage C '^le At a Imall wood, near Cailenrigg Chapel, 
the famous John Armstrong was taken and flain.

FarrHi Situation, and Extent. 

THIS parifti is of a triangular form, and terminates In 
a point in the eaft, where the four panllics ot f ol- 
warth, Fogo, Edrom, and Langton, all meet. It is about 3, 
miies long, and its utmoft breadth about 2. 

Soil and Cultivation. ^Hht foil is various ; the greateft part 
clay, and lome of that on a tilly bed, which is beft adapted 
for grafs ; other parts of it are gravellifti, and fome landy. 
0(i the north-weft there is a conlitlerable extent of muir. — 
The whole of the parifh is inclofed, excepting a Imall farm, 
and the muir allotted by the proprietor to the ule of the 
village, for pafture and fuel. Above 1500 acres are m 
old grafs, and lubdivided into inclofures of from 10 to 30 
acres, all of them luffi(iently watered. Thefe are let annu- 
ally by public roup, and bring very high r-^nts, for the ac- 
commodation of thole farmers, who breed more ilock than 
they can maintain at home.

Produce, Proprietor, and Rents.— T\i^ principal crops ia 
the parifh are oats and barky, a few peafe, and louieti.ucs a 
little wheat. Turnips have of late years become a ijiore ge- 
neral crop, and fucceed well. I here is a confiderable quan- 
tity of old timber, of good fize, befides much young plant- 
ing, which are, in general, very thriving Great attention 

has been paid by the Earl of Marchmont (fole proprietor 
of the parilh) to the dreffing of the hedges ; many of them 
are allowed to be the fineft in the country. The valued 
rent of the parifh is 1624 1. Scotch. The real rent is about 
1000 1. Sterling. Grafs land lets at from 10 s. to 30 s. per 
acre ; arable land from 1 7 s. to 20 s.

of Polivarib* §$ 

Village, Climate, and Dlfeafes.-^ht village of Polwarth is 
r^,nted on very wet, and even Iwampy ground, lo that aU 
^ot in Ly Lure they have a hole dug to collea the un- 
L water, which requires to be often emptied .n wet w^ea- 
ther ■ and yet the inhabitants are very healthy, being n.,ther 
l^b^k to rheumatic nor aguifh complaints. The prefent 
incumbent, who has been minifter of the parifl. 24 years, 
does rot remember any epidemical diftemper preva.hng m 
the vilhge * — The houfes are very much fcattered, not a- 
bove 2 or 3 at mott being fituated clofe to each other. It ,s 
probably owing to this circumftance, that epidemic d.ftem- 
pers do not fpread—In the middle of the village there are 
two tkorn trees, at about 6 yards diftance from each other, 
around which, it was formerly the cuftom, for every new 
married pair, with their company, to dance in a ring from 
hence the fong of Polivarth on tke Green. But this cuftom 
has fallen much into difufe, there not having been above 2 
inftanccs of it thefe 20 years. 

Manner of Xm^^.-Almoft every houfeholder, along 
with his houfe. rents a fmall portion of land, called an acre, 
but which is often nearer tn^o. With the produce thereof, 
together with what they can fpare from their gardens, and 
the ufe of a confiderable extent of muir, which they enjoy 
by the indulgence of the proprietor, they are enabled to keep 
one cow each, and moft of them what is called a folhtver. 
As the rents of their fmall poffeffions are very moderate, 
they live comfortably, and feldom remove, moft of the fa- 
milies having been in the village for feveral generations 

back i

UNITED PARISHES OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12055291">COLVEND 
AND SOUTHWICK</name> 

(County of Kirkcudbright.— Synod and Presbytery of 

Dumfries.) 

By the Rev. i^r James Little, Mimjler.</head>

<p>

Origin of the Names. 

THE name of the parifli of Col vend appears to have been 
antieritly Culwen. In the 15th century, a Johannes 
de Culwen^ the ance/tor of the prelcnt family of Curwen 
of Workington y in Cumberland, into which the name, when 
unconnefted with the territory, hath been corrupted, married 
a daughter of the family of the Stuarts, Lords of Galloway; 
Tvhich is vouched by the principal contradl of marriage, in 

the pofieffion of the Curwen family South wick appears 

to be a compound of the Englifh word fouihi and the Saxon 
word uoicy which fignifies, in that language, the ivinding of a 
river, 

Situationy Extent y and Form. — This is one of what are called 
the ten parijhes *, which lie within the ftewartry of Kirkcud- 
bright, on the eaft fide of the water of £7rr, or Orr, but 
within the prefbytery, fynod, and commiffariot of Dumfries. 
The river Urr feparates it, on the W. from the parifli of 

Buittle. 

* The other 9 are Urr. Kirkpatrick Durham, Kirkgunzeon, 
New- Abb ..y, Kirkbean, Troquire, Terregles, Lochrutton, and 
l^irkpatrick Irongray. 



of Colvend and SouthwkL 99 

Buittle. It extends, in length, from E. to W. along the 
coaft of the Solway Frith, about 8 miles, and in breadth, 
from N. to S. about 4 miles, forming nearly a right angled 
parallelogram. The parifli church ftands 20 miles S. W- froni 
Dumfries, 16 miles E. from Kirkcudbright, and 9 leagues, by 
water, N. of the town of Whitehaven in Cumberland. 

Surface, Soil, Hills, ^c.—Thc furface of this pariOi is ex- 
tremely rough and irregular. No extenfive trads of arable 
laud, or regular fields, are here to be met with 5 but only 
fmall fpots and patches, and even thefe much broke and in- 
terrupted by. rocks, large heaps or cairns of ftones, and im- 
penetrable copies of thorn, furze, and briers or bramble. The 
furface is generally uneven, all afcending or defcending, but 
the many rifing grounds and hills are not very high. For 
near 2 miles towards the E. end of the parifh, along the coaft, 
the country becomes more fmooth and flat, and the fields 
more regular, and moftly arable: But along the northern fron- 
tier, efpecially towards the N. E. extremity of the parifli, 
there are very mountainous grounds covered with heath, and 
running in a chain, into the fklrts of the large and confpicu- 
ous mountain Crotufell *. In fuch a country, it is next to 
impoffible to afcertain the precife quantity of arable ground, 
or evea to conjecture what proportion it bears, to the many 
fpots and large tra£ls of what may be pronounced incapable 
of cultivation, and utterly unimprovable. The foil is, for the 
mofl: part, a light loam, warm and fertile, adapted for paftu- 
rage rather than tillage. It would be much more produdlive, 
were it not for a pernicious mixture of coarfe fand, or rather 
large particles of flint and crumbled granite ftone, which too

and Weftmorland, many of the large trails of high mountainous 
ground are called /^///. '

haft,Iy abforbs the natural moifture, and faon exhaufts the 
ilrength of manure and improvement. Of late years, confide- 
rable and pretty (uccefsful efforts have been made, for clear- 
mg the ground of ftones and bramble, extending the quan- 
tity of arable land, and building fences ; fo that now almoft 
all that will admit of culture, or improvement, hath been ac 
tually brought under the plough. 

,. Sea Coajl.—Tht fea coafl here along the frith is remark- 
ably bold and rocky, forming high and tremendous precipices, 
from which the tide ebbs, leaving dry a large trad of flat 
fand, from whence, at low water, may be viewed fome pi^u- 
refque and magnificent fcenes : High and pointed fpires, at 
the bafes of which are pafTages through them in form of rude 
arches ; fpacious and regular anphitheatres, and mouths of 
caverns running up under ground into the land, farther than 
any human being hath ever adventured to explore. In the 
ci-evices of the rock, but generally where the precipice is over- 
hanging, or mofl inacceffible, is found the marine plant /am' 
fyhtre, well known as a preferve or pickle j to the dangerous 
expedients for gathering which, as alluded to of old by Shake- 
fpeare *, the people here are, at this day, no Grangers. To- 
wards the eaft, about the mouth of Southwiek water, the 
coaft becomes entirely flat. 

Frilh^ Rivers, isfc — The Sokoay Frith^ here, is 9 leagues 
over. By it there is frequent communication with the towns 
of Whitehaven, Partoun, Harrington, Workington, Mary- 
port, and Allanby, in the north of England ; from whence 
lime is imported, and conveyed into the interior parts of

the country up the water of Urr ; which is 2 miles broad at 
its confluence with the frith, and is navigable from thenge 
about b miles by veffels of 80 tons burden. This navigable 
river, about 2 miles from its mouth, forms within land a large 
bafon, commonly called Gibb's Holdj into which large veflels 
are often obliged to put, in ftormy weather, vv^here they are 
well flieltered and fafely moored. The water of Southwick 
is a fmaller ftream, which falls into the frith towards the eaft 
end of the parifh, and alio affords a convenience for impor- 
tation of lime J being navigable for near 2 miles by veffels of 
fmall burthen The navigation, however, of the Solway Frith 
is every day becoming more difficult and hazardous, by the 
large fand banks which lie in its channel, on which many 
fliipwrecks happen ; and which within thefe few years have 
rifen nmch higher, and extended themfelves much farther 
out towards its mouth, feeming to threaten, at no very diftant 
period, to fliut it up altogether. 

Climate, and Difeafes. — This part of the country, enjoying 
a free circulation of air, a warm dry foil, and, like all other 
rocky countries, many fprings of excellent water, might be 
expe£ted to be more healthy than it is really experienced to 
be. Exccffive falls of rain, brought by violent foutherly and 
fouth-wefterly winds, blowing in from the neighbouring At- 
lantic, have of late years been feverely felt here ; and have 
probably contributed to the frequency of flow fevers, fluxes, 
catarrhs, and confumptions, but above all to rheumatic com- 
plaints, which unlverfally prevail here. In autumn 1772, the 
infedlion of a malignant fever was communicated to this pa- 
rifti from abroad,, and made great havock : It was 3 years 
before the infeftion was quite extinguiflied. The fudden and 
loud gufts of fouth-wefterly winds, feveral of which have been 
e?cperienced in this part of the country, uncommonly violent 

within

within thefe kft 12 years, are by fome conjeaured to proceed 
from volcanic eruptions from the bottom of the Atlantic 



ocean. 



State of Property.^ThQ old valued rent of the parilh is 
3183I. Scotch. The prefent rental cannot be precifely Hated: 
Accefs cannot be eafily had to the knowledge of the rent of 
fonie farms feveral grounds are in the natural poflVffion of 
the proprietors: It may probably be fomewhat between 2500I. 
and 3000 1. There are 22 heritors, fome of whom have pro- 
perty in the parilh to the extent of "i 00 \. per annum ^ fome fo 
low as 7 1. Ten of thefe are refident. There are no towns or 
villages in the pariai. The farms are generally fmall: There 
are about 130 tenants, or perfons who may be faid to occupy 
land in the parifh, not more than one or two of whom farm 
to the extent of 100 1. of yearly rent; many fo low as 5 1. 

Produce and Cultivation. — The kinds of grain produced here 
confift chiefly of oats and barley; and of green crops, pota- 
toes, turnips, and clover. The rotation of crops ufually ob- 
ferved is, firft 2 or 3 fucceffive crops of oats ; then the ground 
is fummer fallowed, and dunged, with a green crop of pota- 
toes or turnips; laftly, a crop of barley, along with which are 
fown ryegrafs, and red and white clover feeds : After one 
crop of hay is taken, the ground is paftured 4 or 5 years be* 
fore it is again opened up. Lime is ufed as a manure, and is 
imported from Cumberland, at i s. the Carlifle bufliel. Shells 
are found in great abundance on the (hore, and have alfo 
been much ufed, but are experienced to be rather too ftimu- 
lating a manure for fo very thin and light a foil. The great 
excellency of (hells, as a manure, is for breaking or loofening 
a ftiff clay, or a heavy wet foil. The farmers here, and all 
ever Galloway, at length convinced of the benefit and impor- 
tance

their black cattle out in the open fields all wititer, and are 
now beginning to feed them in houles or {hades. The foil, 
not only of this parifh, but of almoft the whole county, be- 
ing warm and dry, in wet fummers produces luxuriant crops 
of corn and grafs. The crops here have been very plentiful

Exports, Prices of Wages, "S'c. — Unpromifing as the appear- 
ance of the country is, this parifli produces confiderably more 
grain than is conflimed by the inhabitants. There are ge- 
nerally exported from it, annually, about 2500 Wincheftsr 
bufhels of barley to Whitehiven, Lancarter, a:id Liverpool; 
and from 3000 to 4000 ftones of oatmeal to the fea-port and 
manufadluring towns in the weft of Scotland j befides con(i- 
derable quantities of potatoes to the Engliih market. The 
exporting prices of barley here have been, on an average of 
the laft 10 years, 2s. 8id. per Winchefler bufhel, and of 
oatmeal i s. p^d. per ftone of 17 lib. 10 oz. averdupois. Po- 
tatoes are fold at from 20 s. to 30 s. per ton. The prices of 
butcher meat here are regulated by the Dumfries market. 
The fmaller articles of provifion, fuch as buiter, fovvls, eggs, 
gtc, are rather high, as there are very frequent opportunities 
of conveying them to the fea-port towns in the north of Eng- 
land, where they find a ready marker. The wages of me- 
chanics, and prices of labour of all kinds, have of late years 
rifen very high here, as in all the other farming counties in 
the fouth of Scotland. 

Woods and Plantations. — From the great quantities of large 
■and full grown oak timber, ftill in good prefervation, which 
are dug up in the many i-nall Ipots of peat mofs in the pa- 
rifli, it vvould appear that natural wood had abounded in it. 

Indeed, 



Siati/lical Account 

Indeed, the vulgar tradition is, that, a fev^ centuries ago, it 
was wholly a wood or foreft. There are ftill fome natural 
wood-lands in the interior parts of the parifh ; and feveral 
Imall plantations of barren timber have been made lately, 
which thrive well. Very many attempts are now making to 
rear fruit orchards in the parifh j but, owing to the extreme 
thinners and lightnefs of the foil, and the unfavourable expo- 
fure of this part of the country to the fouth-wefterly wind*, 
they do not promife much fuccefs, 

FiJIj, 555*^.— The kinds of fifh taken here are falmon, white 
flounders, plaife, fome foles of a very large fize, Ikate, and, 
very rarely, turbot ; but the great ftaple is cod, of which 
large quantities, and fome of excellent quality, are taken here, 
and carried to Dumfries, and other neighbouring fmaller towns, 
and fold at from i d. to 3 d. per pound. Of flicll fifli, large 
quantities of cockles and mufcles are found on the coaft j al- 
fo flirimps, wilks, and other fmaller kinds, of little value. No 
companies are aflbciated here for the purpofe of carrying on 
any fiflieries. JVJoft part of the inhabitants, however, near 
the coaft, are occafionally employed in filhing, but all as fingle 
adventurers. The fiiallowncfs of the water near the Ihore, 
and the roughnefs of the fea in the cod fiOiing feafon, render 
the ufe of boats in fifhing dangerous, and almoft impradticable. 
The fliores produce 15 or 20 tons of kelp once in 5 or 6 
years ; an article reduced nearly one half in price fincc the 
barilla aft was pafTed in 1781. 

Ecclefiajlical State. — The church, which is fituated near the 
S. W. corner of the parifh, one mile N. from the frith, and 
at the fame diftance E. from the water of Urr, was built in 
1771, is very plain, but large and commodious. The manfe, 
\vhich ftands about a quarter of a mile N. E. of the church,

' upon the banks of a 'ake of 50 acres extent, and in form' of 
a crefcent, was built in 1763, for what was at that time un- 
derwood to be the legal allowance, locol Scotch, and con- 
ffquently upon a nr.all plan, and poorly ex,ecuted, In (777 
it was repaired, and fome additions mnde to it. The ne 
confifts of about 6 acres. The annexed parifh of South- 
wick lies to the eaftwird, and the nuniher poflifles alfo a 
glebe there of about 8 acres. Although the walls of the old 
church of Southwirk, which Oands in a very romar.tic fmall 
ftrath, about 4 niil;s E. from the parifli church, Itill remain 
iti many places at their full heighth, yet there is not; the 
fmalleft tradition of any incumbent there, or of any c.ircum- 
fiance relating to it as a feparate charge. It appears to have 
been annexed to Colvend ever fince the reformation. In Fe- 
bruary 1650, Mr David Hope, then incumbent, obtained de- 
creet againfr the heritors of both narifhe?, modifying the fti- 
pend at 3 chalders of victual, two thirds meal and one-third 
bear, and 400 1. Scotch of money, with 50 merks for commu- 
nion elements. By a new decreet in i7S9, the {lipend was 
modified at 8ocI. Scotch, with 40 K Scotch for communion 
elements, and the victual continued. However long thefe 
parilhes have been united, their antient boundaries are ft ill 
diftindlly known. Colvend is to Southwick *, in' jwint of 
rental, extent of territory, and population, nearly as three to 
two.

Populaiion — Although the number of births, which is 
generally about 36 annually, greatly exceeds the number of 
deaths, which is from 1 8 to 24, yet the population feems 
not to have increafed much thefe 18 years. This, and the 
excefs of the number of females to that of males, may be 
accounted for, by many of the young men going to fea, or 
to fettle abroad. In 1772, by an epidemical malignant fe- 
ver, and in 1774, by emigration, the population of this pa- 
rith fuffered two fevere ihocks, from which it hath fcarcely 
yet recovered. Notwithftanding thefe circumftances, how- 
ever, there has been an increafe upon the whole v/ithin 
thefe 4c years. The number of inhabitants at prefent, 
(1794) is, Males - - 456

Horfes and Blach Cattle.— ThtrQ arc in the p^rini upwards 
of 200 horfes, being confiderably more than are fufficicnt 
for all the purpofes of agricuhure ; but fo it generally hap- 
pens where there are many very fmall farms. There are 
kept about 650 milk cows or breeders, all the offspring of 
which are prelervcd, and carefully reared to aged cattle. 
' There are about 1300 rifing cattle, from i to 4 years old, 
kept the year round, at which age, when they are arrived, 
they are fold lean to the graziers on the fouth-eailern coun- 
ties of England, at from 7 1. to lol. a-head All thefe are 
of the true Galloway breed, moftly wanting horns, not of 
the largeft fize, but very handlome. The breeds both of 
horfes and black cattle in this pariih have been much im- 
proved within thefe 5 years. 

Skeep and Goats. — There are about 2000 fheep kept in the 
parifti, and about 100 goats in the more remote and moun- 
tainous grounds. Among the fheep there are fome flocks 
of - the brown-faced fmall old Scottilh kind, with fine Ihort 
wool-, the greateft number are of the black-faced kind- There 
are alio a few upon the lower and more improved grounds 
of the larger breeds, with white faces, which have in later 
years been introduced from England *.

%rred with veins of flint or Ipar. They furnifl. excellent 
inatenals for walls and fences. There is likewife a quarry 
of a free or fofter fpecies of granite, on one part of the 
inore, which is worked for mill-ftones, and from whence all

There are very many fmall fpots of peat mofs in 
the parifh, which are now much exhaufted. The prepara- 
tion of this kind of fuel, upon which the- fole dependence 
of the generality of the inhabitants has hitherto been, is 
here attended with vaft expence of time and labour, and af- 
ter all they are -but poorly fupplied. However humane the

♦ About the year 1780, there was found upon the eftate of 
bouchwick, belongmg to Sir James Riddell, Bart, in the mid. 
die of a large granite ftone, when blalled with gun powder in 
a focket exaaiy fitted to it, a piece of the fame kind of fLb- 
ttance, fmooth and polilhed, in form fomewhat refemblin^ a 
rude hatchet, it was about 9 inches long, 6 broad at the^'one 
end, and 3 at the other end, about the thicknefs of the palm of 
the hand ; one of the angles at the broad end a little more acute 
than the other, the corners a little rounded, and fliarp round 
the edges. The virtuofi, to whofe infpeclion it was fubmitted, 
did not hefitate immediately to pronounce it to be a haichet' 
which had been ufed by the Druids in performing facrifice! 
which conjefture they imagined warranted by the vellige of a* 
Druidical temple very near the place where it was found : But 
this depends upon an hypothefis which admits rather of fome 
doubt. When the fize, the firmnefs, and folidity of the mafs 
in which it was found, are confideied, and the difficulty of af- 
figning any period fince the creation as the commencement of 
the formation of fuch a mafs^ — indeed our entire ignorance of 
the nature and progrefs of fuch a procefs, or the time it would 
require, — it mud be oxvned it becomes rather problematical, 
whether this hatchet is the work of arc, and ever exiRed in a 
ftate feparate from the ftone out of which it was taken ; or if 
the phenomenon is only a lufus naturae.

burying ground* around it, now occupied as a barn yard.— 
At fhc lcuth.veft corner of the parifti, on a very high pro- 
jnontory, or head of land, formed by the juraion of the 
Water oi Urr with the Splway Frith, there are the vertices 
of a work of ftrength, fuppofed to be Danifh; the fofse is 
fiill very apparent. It bears the name of the Cajlle-hill of 
Barclay. Upon the br.nk of the lame river, on the eaft lide, 
about two miles farther up. upon the narrow top of a fmall, 
but bigh, fteep, and rorky nill or mount, have lately been 
diicovered the vcftiges cf another woik of ftrength, which, 
from the fcanty remains of its materials that are to be found, 
antiquarians fuppofe to have been a vitrified fort. The 
place is called the Moat of the Mark, or Merkland of Bar- 
clay \. 

Manners The Ifle of Man, which lies 24 leagues diftant 

to the S. W. the higher grounds of which are in fight here, 
is well known, before the lordfhip of it was purchafed by 
government in 1765, to have been the great channel of a 
contraband h-ade with France, to the fecret operation of 
which, the nature of this country as above defcribed, but 
then in a ftill more'unpoUftied ftate, was moft favourable. 
Having the advantage of many fecret caverns, impervious 
thickets, devious paths, and unfrequented trails, which af- 
forded innumerable and fecure hiding places, it is not to be 
wondered at, if the inhabitants were generally and deeply 
engaged in it, and confequently addifled to idlenefs, and to 
that fpecies of intemperance to which the ftaple of that 

trade

tvade immediately miniftred. But the abolition of that trade 
has had a happy eftcd upon the improvement of the country, 
and the manners of the people in this corner; and the traces 
of thefe more licentious times, which were a . proverbial re- 
proach to this parifh, are now almoft wholly obliterated. 
The prefent generation are trained up in habits of fobriety 
and induftry, for which, and for their attention to their 
farms and refpedive occupations, they are perhaps now no 
lefs remarkable, than they were in thofe more diffolute times, 
for their diffipacion. 

Difadvautages.—TixQ moft ftriking which occur apply to 
the whole county of Galloway, as well as to this parifh, 
namely, the difadvantages under which the farmers and 
breeders of black cattle, the great "ttaple of this part of the 
country, labour in marketing th'em.—A number of young 
fellows, of the very loweft clafs, who diflike, or affed to be 
above labour, turn what are czWtd jobbers, fcour the country, 
and infefl: the cattle markets, and, by picking up the youn'er 
cattle, intercept a profit between the breeder and grazier, to 
the prejudice of onp, or perhaps both of them. This is an 
evil which it is imprafticable to reftrain, unleis by fomething 
like the following method : That the farmers in general, for. 
their mutual advantage, fliotild enter into a concert, where- 
by it fliall be underftood, to be laid down as a rule, that 
thofe who rear the cattle fhall fell them only to thofe, who, 
they know, can graze tliem upon their own farms or pofllf- 
lions; and that thofe again fhall buy only from thofe, whom 
they know to have reared them, or who have kept them at 
leaft for months. — Another evil, of which the confequenccs 
have been, and prcfently are, fevereiy felt by many, is the 
frequent and weighty failures of the greater drovers, that is, 
thofe who yearly buy the aged cattle through tlie country, 

colfea: 



cf Cohend and Souihwkk,

collect them into large droves, and carry them up to the 
markets in the fouth-eaft counties of England. They ge- 
nerally buy upon credit ; payments are not expected, until, 
in the courfe of 4 or 5 months, they are enabled to make 
them from their returns in the Englilh markets, and confe- 
quently muft, in a great meafure, depend upon their fuccefs 
there, which they themfelvcs have the exclufive privilege of 
reporting to the farmer their creditor. Of thefe adventu- 
rers, virho thefe many years have obtained the credit and 
confidence of the country, the greater number have at one 
time or other failed, and fome repeatedly. By fuch failures 
large fums have been loft, honeft and induftrious farmers- 
much hurt and reduced, and whole families ruined. It were 
to be wilhed that the Englifti graziers, or cattle merchants, 
were to be feen buying their cattle in our own markets, ra- 
ther than that our farmers fhould be obliged to run fuch, 
rilks, in trufting their property to fo great extcht, in the 
hands of people, fo many of whom they Jiave experienced 
to be unworthy of their confidence, in order to get it dif- 
pofed of in the remoteft parts of the illand.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4986712">BUITTLE</name>

(County and Synod of Galloway. — Presbytery 
OF Kirkcudbright). 

By the Rev. Mr George Maxwell of Glenann^ MiniJIer 

of that Parijh.</head>

<p>

Nawey Situation, and Extent, 

VARIOUS opinions are entertained as to the derivation 
of the name. Some have thought that Boot-hill^ or 
Butt-hill, was the original name of that territory which now 
compofes the parifli of Buittle, on account of the frequent 
mufters of cavalry, or archers, that muft have taken place in 
the vicinity of the caftle after-mentioned. With as much 
probability, however, it may be fuggefted, that the word 
Buittle is but a contraftion of Bo wet-hill or Bowet-hall, an ap- 
pellation ooccafioned by the beacons in the neighbourhood of 
the caftle alluded to i or the great light which it difplayedon 
feflive orfolemn occafions. Men of the name oi Booile, too, 
are frequent in England, and fo.be found in Scotland — Buit- 
tle is one of thofe pariflies in the ftewartry of Galloway, 
that border upon the Solivay Frith, and have the advantages 
of navigation. From the march of Crofsmichael, upon the 
north, Buittle extends fouthward to the fea. This is the 
length of the parifli, and includes about 8 miles. On the 

whole 



of Bmttk. 



115 



whole of the eaft fide It is bounded by the river and parifh^ 
of Urr. ■ From thence to Kelton and Rerrick, which are 
conterminous to Buittle, on the weft and fouth-weft, its ave- 
rage breadth may be 3 miles. 

So//, Surface, Hills, The foil of Buittle is like mofc 

of the land in lower Galloway ^efpecially near the mouth of 
the Urr), kindly and fertile, even beyond  its appearance. 
The lurface of Buittle is unequal, and juftifies Buchanan's 
remark upon Galloway in general: — " Nufquam fere in 
« montes attollitur, fed collibus tantum frequentibus intu- 
«' mefcit." The hills, however, being mollly green and 
without heath, have lately drawn the attention of the induf- 
trious j nor have their pains been ill repaid, as the foil is 
often found deeper on the heights than on the lower ground. 
It is here to be obferved alfo, that there are few hills in this 
part of Galloway, where cultivation is at all pra^licable, that 
do not bear diftindl marks of the plough. The depths of 
the furrows, too, plainly declare, that this tillage has not 
been cafual, or merely experimental, but frequent and fuc- 
ceffive. This fliould fet both the antient population and in- 
duftry of this part of Scotland in a more favourable light, 
than that in which they are ufually beheld. It alfo afl'ords 
probability to a tradition repeated by the country people to 
this day, " That at a time when Scotland was under a pa- 
« pal interdicl, or fentence of curling from the Pope, it was 
« found that his Holinefs had forgot to curfe the hills, 
» though he had commanded the land, ufually arable, to 
*« yield no increafe ; and that while this fentence remained, 
* the people were neceffitated to feck tillage ground, in 
*' places unufual and improbable*." The grafs through

the greater part of Buittle is excellent, being moftly what Is 
called the Sheep^s fefcue grafs. Ey.clufive of other good pro- 
perties, it may be adverted to, that this plant deties cx-irpa- 
tion by either bad farming or bad flocking: For oftt-n when 
land is fo much plowed that it will bear no more corn, and 
even the roots of the larger graifes are deftroyed, we (ee the 
field covered with the fefcue m a very fhort time. Again, by 
overftocking a pafture, the feed ftalks of moft graffes are 
eaten up, and the very roots preyed upon. But the prodi- 
gious crop of fmall feeds, light and eafily transferred by the 
winds, afforded by the fefcue, hinders its deftruftion tn the 
former fenfe \ and the fmallnefs of its fibrous roots in the 
latter. 

Flatus t ^f.— -The natural produaions of Buittle differ 
little from thofe of the lower parts of Galloway in general, 
and which, in all probability, will be particularly mentioned 
in the account of every parifh belonging to that diftridl:. 
The plants and flowers in Buittle are no ways remarkable. 
Even by gentlemen in affluent circumftances, that cultivation 
of the earth, which produces an immediate return, and con- 
ne(fts with general utility, is preferred to attempts of unprofit- 
able cnriofity, as to rearing exotic plants, or even thofe of 
this climate that are of a precarious growth. This parifh, 
indeed, abounds fo much with excellent natural fhelter, that 
it is believed few plants or trees would fail here, that fuccecd 
well in any other part of Scotland, if not of Britain. With 
great fafety one might take any bet, that, commumbus diebus^ 

the 

fubmitted to him, were under the Pope's curfe for a good ma- 
ny years, and that Galloway acknowledged his authority pret- 
ty early, every one knows ; but if the above tradition, as ftand- 
Jng connected with this fa.5t, is true, we may place it amoog th^ 
few benefits that fuperftition has conferred on ipankind.

the thermometer (lands higher during the year in Bulttle 
than at London. For fome ages, this pariOi was, in confe- 
quence of the above natural advantages, diftinguiflied as a- 
bounding with orchards. Of late, however, thefe have fal- 
len much into decay. It has indeed been complained of, 
that for many years paft the growth of fruit-timber, and of 
trees in general, has been lefs favoured by the temperature 
of the air than formerly ; and fome gloomy philofophers 
have dreaded, that Scotland might experience the calamities 
pf Iceland, or Danifti Greenland. Even under lefs dreary 
impreffions, candour muft admit, that, for thefe 15 or 20 
years, new plantations have not come on fo vigoroufly as 
could have been expc£ted ; and that the fruits, fuch as ap- 
ples, pears, &amp;c. have not ripened to the degree of perfecStion, 
that even middle aged people affirm to have been formerly 
common. 

Animal Fkivers. — Till of late, perhaps. It has not been 
much adverted to, that the animal flower, or water polypus, 
is even common alongft the fliores of Buittle, Colvend, and 
very likely around the whole coaft of the Stewartry of Gal- 
loway. The form of thefe polypufes is elegant, and pleafant- 

diverfified. Some are found refcnibling the fun-flower, 
fome the hundred leaved rofe, but the greater number bear 
the likenefs of the poppy. The colours differ as much as 
the form. Sometimes the animal flower is of a deep purple, 
frequently of a rofe colour, but moftly of a light red or 
flefliy hue. The moft beautiful of them, that could be pick- 
ed up, have often been carried from the fliore of Colvend, 
12 or 15 miles up into the country, where they have lived, 
fed on worms, and even bred for feveral weeks, and might 
have exifted much longer, if they could have been fupplied 
with fea-water. In a word, it feems probable, that an In- 

duftrious

duftrious naturalift might difcover, orx this coaft, feme of 
thofe lingular animals, not much inferior to thofe produced 
m the Antilles, and other tropical countries. 

Hi/h.^As the fouth end of Buittle is wafhed by the Sol- 
way Frith, a good deal of fifli is taken, and much more 
might be had. As other fubfiftence is plenty, however, and 
as labourers and their families are maintained by their em- 
ployers, neither choice nor neceffity leads any one to follow 
the fifhing bufinefs, much farther than as an amufement. 
Neverthelefs, it is believed by many judicious people, that if 
a few filhermen from the Highlands fhould fettle about the 
mouth of the Urr, they would find profitable employment, 
and be of fervlce to the country around. The fifli Hfually 
taken at prefent are, falmon, cod, flounders, gtc Cockles, 
mufdes, and fcveral other kinds of fhell fifh are alfo to be 
had in tolerable plenty. 

^adrupeds — The quadrupeds are entirely of the com- 
mon fort, and the black cattle (which are almoft all polled) 
arc of a good {hape. During the time that a farmer fociety 
fubfifted at Dumfries, which invited the tenantry to fhew 
iheir beft breeding cattle, and diftributed premiums, the 
mould of cattle was vifibly improved. Since that fociety 
was dropt, farmers have become, it is thought, more carelefs, 
both in Buittle, and in many parifhes around. The breed 
of horfes is much improved, fo far as concerns the purpofes 
of agriculture but the old hardy Galloway fpecies is moftly 
extinct. Sheep are kept in fmall numbers, being thought 
prejudicial to the paftures where black cattle are fed ; nor is 
the growth of wool attended to, or confidered as an objcdt 
«f profit, unlcfs on the fmall fcale of domeftic oeconomy. 



Birds, 



of Buiitte^ 



j5;^.^j..__To mention the feathered race might here feem 
to be a matter of levity ; but when it is confidered that they, 
perhaps, of all living creatures, have the moft delicate fenfa- 
tions, as to climate and the ftate of the air ; that nature has 
enabled, and even inftrufted them, to choofe or to change 
their refidence accordingly ; and that their appearance or ab- 
fence may afford no contemptible eftimate of the increafing 
warmth or cold of any country, (things much connected with 
the ftate of agriculture), one may venture to hazard ridicule 
on this fubje£V. Perhaps inattention to fubjefts not vifibly 
hnportant, and ignorance of natural hiftory, might hinder 
our anceftors from remarking upon birds any ways fingular. 
If that has not been the cafe, this country has lately been 
frequented by feveral that ufed feldom to appear in Scotland. 
Since fome groves of pines came to be of a rcfpeftable 
growth, the crofs-bill has been frequently feen, and it is be- 
lieved breeds in the country. The bull-finch is common, and 
pheafants have been obferved, which, in all probability, muft 
have come from England. Quails, hardly known a few years 
ago, are now in abundance. In hard winters, too, the Bohe« 
mian chatterer, and even fome Ardlic birds have vifited us. 
The common moor and black game have difappeared from 
this parifh, fince agriculture became extenfive, and the heath, 
broom, furze, &amp;c. were deftroyed. Other game would be 
very plenty, but the game laws have never been rigoroufly 
executed in this part of the country, unlefs when people 
break fences, difturb cattle, and do the farmers wanton mif- 
chief in the courfc of their amufement. 

Minerals,— h.% to minerals or foffils, little can be here 
mentioned, ferving either to gratify curiofity, or prompt in- 
duftry. Rock cryftals, but of no great brilliancy, are often 
foundr Talcs and fpars rf feveral kinds are pretty frequent-

* Though the writer of this account propofed to be concifc 
on the fubjea of antiquities, he cannot help mentioning here 
certain fubterraneous pafTnges or galleries, difcovered in this 
neighbourhood. Thefe are dug through a firm kind of gravel 
perhaps iron ore; nor h the roof fupported by wood or 
arched with ftone. Into one of thefe lurid grottos, the preVent 
Mr Maxwell of Terraughty, when a boy, defcended, and tra- 
veiled farther than perhaps prudence could choofe to accompa- 
ny curipfity. The upper part of this paflage or cave he de- 
fcribes as above ; " the bottom (fays he) was like an ill Pwept 
" kirk, and here and there were heads of fpears, and human 
bones." If thofe excavations were ought elfe than iron 
mines, they muft have been places of fepulture. Tacitus, how- 
ever, plainly fays of the Germans, Funerum nulla aiubitio, fepul- 
chnim ce/pes erigit\. And though Caefar calls the funeral ob. 
fequies ot the Gauls, Sumptuoja et magnifica pro cultu, he fays no- 
thing of their carrying the bones of the dead into caverns. It 
would be mere pedantry to fhcw, that a work, fuch as that a- 
bove defcribed, has as little to do with the religion of the Gauls 
and Germans, as with their funeral rites, and the conclulion 
muft be, that fuch works are perfectly Scotiilh. Any inquifi- 
tive gentleman, wifhing to know farther on this fubjeft, might 
apply to Mr Maxwell of Terraughty, whofe affability and good 
fenfe need no commendation. Or if any antiquary choofes to 
repeat Mr Maxwell's experiment, the inhabitants of Auchen- 
reoch, near Spottis-hall, will yet point our. the entrance. Pity 
but the celebrated Mr M-Pherson would explore this def:enfus 
Avernii the world might be bleffed with an appendix to Fingal, 
and with recent accounts from the fpiritsof Lodaand of Dr Sa- 
muel Johnfton. In feveral parts of this country, too, there are 
oblong fquares, made with banks of ftone. in the centre there is 
a hearth; and, in digging up the banks forming the fquare, col- 
lars, chains, hooks, and forks have been found. Such places 
have, by fome ingenious gentlemen, been fuppofed to be ac- 
commodations for burning dead bodies ; and certain niches in 
the furrounding banks, undcrftood to be receptacles for the 

bones.

in different parts of the country, would lead one to think 
that iron had been wrought in this part of the world, at a 
Tcry early period. Tiiere is ftill marl in almoft every mofs ; 
but, as lime can be had by water carriage, marl is now but 
little valued. 

Farms, Rents, and Proprietors. — The generality of farms 
in Buittle are of moderate cxte^jit. Some there are of 300 
acres or more ; but thefe, (with an exception or two), con- 
lift of broken or hilly ground — ^There may be about half a 
dozen farmers in the parilh, who pay 20c 1. a ye;jr of rent, 

or

for holding living bodies as dead ones, th^re is room to believe 
thofe oblong fquares were places of facrifice, or of puniflim-nt 
which are moftiy found fynonimoifs terms, when human facri' 
fice is in the queftion. The Scotch are affuredJy either of Ger 
man or Gaelic extradion, perhaps a mixture of both. As to 
the funerals of thefe nations, Tacitus exprefsly fays the Ger 
mans ufed the roguj in the common manner ; and Caefar f-vs' 
the Gauls burnt their dead, but flates no peculiarities • on the 
contrary, he rather tranfcribes Homer on the fubied Reeard 
,ng the religion of theft- nations, however, Tacitus fav^^ the 
Germans did , offer human facriSces to Mercury ; and Caeftr 
(lb. V,. cap. 16.) fays, The Gauls offered human facrifices.'fome 
of a Pnvate fome of a public nature. He adds, that they fa! 
cnficed m th.s laft manner criminals, as moft acceptable to the 
Gods ; but mnocent people, ,f criminal, could not be found 
One of the oblong courts or fquares is not tar from the cavern

mofl common rent is from 70 1. to iro\, per annum. ..In. 
deed, in Buittle, property of the landed fort is not ill divid- 
ed, either among the landholders or the tenantry. There 
are 15 heritors in the pari fli the largefl: eftate is about 
1000 1. per aTinumy and there is only one below 70 1. 

Fuel, Cultivathuy and Produce — From a port in the Urr, at 
JJarlochan, or Qarden- Creek, the greater part of the parifh is 
fupplied with lime. That port Hes on the eaft fide of the 
parifh, and is centrical. At Munfhes, about a mile farther 
ijp the river, fome is alfo landed. Lately (and moft time- 
oufly) coal has been imported at a reafonable rate, namely, at 
10 d. the Carlifle bufliel. While this country retains its for 
ber fenfcs and habits, it cannot readily forget the perfons 
by whofe. interpofition and efforts this dcfirable event has 
been brought about. — Tillage and pafturage are afmoft e- 
qually obje£|:s to the farmer here The greateft tillage per- 
mitted is one third of the arable, which is certainly more 
than is profitable After liming, three white crops are taken, 
txvo of oats, and a third of barley. If, after the third white 
crop, the farmer dungs and has a green crop, a fourth white 
crop is permitted, when the ground is always fown out with 
red clover and rye-grifs, the only foreign grafles propagated: " 
White clover, and the perennial red, are fo cornmon in the 
fields, and rife naturally in fuch plenty, that the bought feeds 
of thefe plants are feldom ufed. Not much wheat is fown. 
The foil, though kindly, is light ; but that is not the only 
reafon. — The ftraw of wheat is not ufed as fodder in this 
part of the country, though it is in England ; and this, to a 
farmer in thefe parts, is a great draw-back on a crop, as moft 
pf the farms can maintain more cattle in fummer, than can 

prpyided with food in winter : For the fame reafon, fal-

Whitehaven, and the other towns on the oppofite fide of the 
Solvvay Frith, is daily, it is believed the utenfils of hufbandry 
are juft as well made here as any where elfe, and better ac- 
commodated to the ftate and fituation of the ground, than 
could be done by a ftranger tradefman. No oxen are ufed 
for draught, probably owing to the temptation people have 
of felling thofe home-bred horfes, that are good, to the Eng- 
lifli and to jockeys in general. The breeding of black cat- 
tle, too, is followed by almoft every farmer, as far as the 
nature of things will permit. 

Prices of Labour^ Improvements ^ ^c. — The vvages of fer- 
vants are, for lot-men, as they are called, or cottagers, about 
T4 1. per annum ; but the articles of maintenance furniflied 
are, perhaps, efti'nated in GiUoway, 2 1. or 3 I. a year lower 
than in Lothian, and fome other counties of Scotland La- 
bourers, by the day, get from i s. 2 d, to i s. 4 d. — Farm 
houfes are gen'.rally very good, as well as offices. In a word, 
the continual repair of drovers, cattle-dealers, and even la- 
bourers, to England, and the fpirit of improvement that has 
prevailed in this country for thcfe 20 years paft, has made 
the farming of thcfe parts nearly equal to what it is in the 
fouthern part of the ifland, in all ordinary matters, and due 
regard being had to »he means of the inhabitants of the dif- 
ferent countries. As a teft of the happy confequences, 4 or 
5 of the beft farms in Buittle, which, about the year 1747, 
v.'ere rented at 200 1. Scotch, or 400 merks each, now pay, 
(or would pay if cut of leafe), 230 1. a piece, whilft the te- 
nants would live incomparably better than tUeir predectfTors. 
One prejudice fecms much to obrtruft the furcefs of the far- 
mer in this part of the world — it is that of fowing too late. 
The fields, where the corns fliaken by violent winds, if enrly 
i^ou^'hed, have been known to yield a refpcaable crop in 
^ the

the following feafon, in fpite of the rigours of winter ; and- 
though conftant experience declares, that the oats, fown in 
the beginning of February, afford the moft profitable return, 
Hill the fowiug of that grain is delayed till the middle of 
March ; nor is the feed barley committed to the ground fooner 
than the middle or the latter end of April. The harveft, 
as might be expe^ed, correfponds with the feed time. Sel- 
dom does it begin before the middle of September, and it 
is often later, as the foil and expofure of the ground, or as 
the nature of the feafon, may decide. 

Leafes. — In farming, as in moft other concerns, a man's 
exertions depend very much on the prudence of thofe prin- 
ciples, in which his endeavours originate. In Galloway, and 
perhaps elfewhere, one maxim feems for ages to have fetter- 
ed the ha,nds of induftfy. The farmer reafoned thus with 
hindfelf : — ' My forefathers and I have ITad this prefent pof- 
' feffion, in which I am now fettled, by fucceffive leafes of 7 

* years, or lefs, for ages. The rent has been ftill the fame ; 

* but to keep it from rifing, we have not only omitted every 
' improvement, but, in many inftances, we have, to our own 
'■ detriment, been obliged to labour for the depreciation of 
« the fubjeft. This is the confumate prudence of the farmer ; 

* and departing from this maxim, every farmer may expect 

* to find his ruin, either in the avarice of his laird, or in the 
 envy of his neighbour ; as the latter will offer, and the for- 
« mer chearfully receive, whatever any parcel of ground can 
« afford, let it be improved at whofe coft, or by whofe in- 

* duftry, it may.' Two methods of refuting this dangerous 
maxim feem to have been adopted in England. The one is, 
by leafing the ground from year to year, and ftipulating, an- 
nually, what improvement is to he made, and whether at 
the coaft of the landlord 05 tenant. The mode of farming is 

thu9 



^26. Statijiical Account 

thus too fixed. • The other is, that of granting leafes for 
lives, or for a great number of years, upon fines, &amp;c. fo that 
themtereftof the tenant in his poflbffion becomes greater 
than that of the proprietor. In this part of the world, a 
medium has been fought. Few leafes are granted for lefs 
than 19 years 5 and it is now, indeed, not fo much the quef- 
tion with a tenant, whether his induftry will redound uhi- 
mately to the benefit of his landlord,^ or of a fucceeding. te- 
nant, as whether it will pay him, (the prefent poiTefl-or) in 
conformity to his IkiU and outlay.— « If the farm (now rea- 
« fons the latter) is worth 10 1. a year more, at the end of my 
* leafe, I may juft as well give that for it, as for any other of 
' equal value.' After all, it is probable that longer leafes 
than thofe of 19 years would be favourable to permanent 
improvements, fuch as hedges, &amp;c. and it mull be owned, 
that as the leafe draws near a clofc, the tenant is often found 
comporting himfelf, as if under a conviftion that he inhabi- 
ted hoftile ground. To fay the truth, however, that nar- 
rownefs of mind, or arijlocratical pride, which adjufted every 
matter of leafe, to the vifibje purpofe of keeping tenants ia 
abjea dependance upon their landlords, has of late been 
put very much to the blufli. Through all Galloway, as well 
as in Buittle parifli, a prodigious alteration took place in ■ 
landed property, through the fatal American war, and the 
fgarce lefs deplorable concern of the Douglas and Heron 
Bank. Moft of the efiates brought to falc in this countv, 
were purchafed by natives of it— men acquainted with the 
world, and in afiluent circumfl:ances. Thefe knew better 
things than to ruin themfelves with Baillie work *, to put 
their importance on the number of kain hens paid them by 
ragged cottagers j or to recommend their own affability, by

cultural and mechanical knowledge, it is a queition but the

may hold good, «« Univerfa pecoris quam frumenti fertiliorr 
More eipecially of late, many creditable people have conten- 
ded, that the improvement of the breed of (heep, and the 
growth of wool, would render this country more valuable to 
all concerned, than ever it has been heretofore ; perhaps it 
might here be equally tedious and impertinent to enhance 
the idea. 

Roads, Woody tsfc. — ^The roads are tolerable, rather bc- 
caufc the foil is hard and dry, than becaufe the manage- 
ment of them hitherto has been judicious, or the expendi- 
tures regarding them liberal. There is not one village in all 
the parifli, nor is there any kind of manufacture. Indeed, 
for many years pall, the want of fuel feems to have a£led as 
a prohibition rclpedting both. Even the veftiges oi Ibme 
villages, of which we read in the charters of lome eftates, 
cannot now be difcerned. Of wood there may be growing, 
and even fit for cutting, at this day, to the value of 1 0,000 1. 
and the late plantations abundantly repay the care and in- 
duftry of the owners. Afh and oak are the trees moft com-

mon;— the larix is th? favourite plant of the day ; but' Iti 
rapid and towring growth renders it incommodious to be in- 
terfpcrfed in plantations. It feems thus to be threatened 
with exile to the tops of hills. Even there, few of the fpe- 
cies fail. 

Sr^ci^//.— Knowledge, as to both its ftate and extent, is as 
refpeaable in Buittle as could well be fuppofed, whilft the 
opportunities of acquiring it are confidered. There is a 
public fchool, to which moft of the children attending it 
travel fome 2, fome 3 miles. The fchoolmafter is chofeti 
from year to year, as it is called, and the only fecurity for 
his falary of ro 1. is the good will of the heritors. There 
is alfo a cheaper fchool, having a ftipend of 3 1. per ammmx 
Thus the whole funds of public inftrudlion, for the rifing 
generation, for the whole parifh of Buittle, are 13 I. Ster- 
ling !_What can be the meaning of this parfimony ? Is it 

from the learned, the well informed, the religious, or is it- 

from the ignorant, " the mole-ey'd, half dilcerning," and 
confequeutly unprincipled, that civil fociety juft now ftands 
in dread ? — From fome circumftanees, one would think it 
Was from the former. 

Foor. — Buittle has no poor's rate, in confequence few 
poor, and no travelling beggars. The collections in the 
church, joined to the prudent charity of well difpofed per- 
fons, afford abundant fupply to thofe really in need. — Vaga- 
bond beggars, the fcum of cities, who beg half-a-crown z 
day to drink it at night, are pretty numerous, and oftea 
troublefome j nor is the law of the land very ftriClly execu- 
ted, in repreffing thefe pefts of fociety. Indeed, the failure 
of raanufadlures at prelent, affords them too good an extufc 
for their idleneft.

think thcmfelves competent, and intcrefted i.. this mafter,: 
tD decide. Country clergymen may well be excufed, for jg-. 
norance in concerns very little allied to the fuccels of their 
labours. Certain it is, however, that the ruins of Buittle 
Caftle denote it to have been a place of ftrength, and even 
magnificence. It now belong-s, with its precinfts, as con- 
tained in the charter, to Mr Murray of Broughton, the re- 
prefentative of the Caillie family. The vaults and ditches 
of Buittle Caftle, are all that remain of this proud ftrufture. 
They have baffled the ravages of time for feveral centuries, 
and may for feveral more. The vaults are covered with 
large afti trees ; and into thefe fubterraneous parts of the 
Caftle, no perfon has ever penetrated, though it might be 
done with eafe and fafety, probably with much gratification 
to curiofity.—Befidcs the Caftle of Buittle, the only other 
remembrance of ages equally rude and remote, which ftiall 
be mentioned here, is one of thofe ruins, coinmonly called 

vhrified 



X Probably it was built by Allan, Lord of Galloway, huf- 
band to Margaret, the eldefl daughter of David Earl of Hun", 
tindon, and father of Dervigilda the mother of John Baliol. 
About 7 years ago, there was found in a lump of lime, taken 
from the ruins of the Caftle, an old coin of yellow metal, a 
ftiade lighter than commoji brafs. On one fide were infcnb-ri 
the names of Nuremberg, and feveral other towns in Germany 
or Flanders, with the vpord Pfniniiig, and on the other fide a 
coat of arms fuppofed to be imperial. The date of the coin 
was 12 20. From this, indeed, nothing conclufive can be affirm- 
ed ; only about, the year 12 20, Earl Allan mnft have been 36 
years of ape, and muR have attained to the meridian of his 
good fortune and power. After belonging to the Baliols, the 
Cummings, the Douglafes, this Caltle feems to have becom^ 
the property of the Lennoxes of Caillie.

^on in the lower parts of Galloway, and the one now allu- 
ded to ftands on the north-weft border of Buntle panfh, 
within a farm called Laftle-Gcver, which lies along the march 
of Kckon.

• Few people are ignorant of the romantic opinion advan- 
ced and adopted, refpefting thofe vitritied forts, as they are 
"lied, namely, that they were ft.uflures of dry ftone, cemented 
a d c;nfolida';d through fui^on, which was P--;f ^7 le -g 
fire to immenfe pHes of green timber, all around the wall or 
cartle that was to be thus ingenioufly hniihed. 

The difficulties vifibly attending this theory would not be 
few, if detailed, and may fafely be left with men o lenfe. but- 
fice it to fay, that Caeiar leads us to conjeaUres fully more pro- 
bable than the above. That author tells us f, that the Gauls. 
^vhom he calls genus funnnae folertiae, built almoft every wall 
with a kind of wooden frames, in which the upright beams were 
placed about two feet from one another, and the void Ipaces 
filled iip-vviih ftone. Caefar commends the invention, a» a wall 
thus conftruaed did not cafily yield, either to the ram or to 
fire But in Scotland, a few centuiiea ago. it will hardly be 
denied, that moll of the caftles, not taken by fcalade, were re- 
duced by rolling banks, or huge falcmes of wood, which were 
pulhed up to the walls, and then fee on fire. When one, there- 
fore, lights on a mafs of vitrified ftones, here and there inter- 
fperfed with fragments of burnt wood, and bits of charcoal, he 
is almoa as ready to believe, that fire has been employed for 
demolifhin^, as in ere^ing the pile, whatever ingenuity may ad- 
vance to the contrary- This obfervation, however, is not offer- 
ed pragmatically. If made before by any body, no doubt it has 
been already decided upon. Speaking farther of the upright 
bsams, Caefar lays, " revinciuntur intror/us, et multo aggers vef- 
" tiuntur." Now a'^ger more frequently lignifies a bank of 
flones, than a bank of earth. He obferves afterwards, that the 
thicknefs of a wall thus formed was very great — ^'■ Materia — 
" per, 'etuis traliibus, pedis quadragenos plsrumque introrfus revin^ia.^* 
— Agreeable to this, thele walls, commonly called vitrified, are 
ever found, in this part of the ifland at leaft, exceeding thick ;

Climate and Characler.^As the foil of Bulttle Is in general 
dry, as the air of it is good, and the traft of country it com- 
prehends warm, good health and length of days are corre- 
fpondent to thofe aids of both. « Medicina fumma medica^ 

mentis non uti." With this moft important maxim of phy- 
fic, the inhabitants of Buittle arc well acquainted, without 
confiilting antiquity. There is a furgeon about a mile from 
the border of the parifli, and an attorney at nearly the fame 
dittance. Either, or both of them, will come if fent for, 
but this is as feldom as pollible. Indeed it is juft rather than 
complimentary, to fay, that the morals of the inhabitants of 
this parifh, as feldom need the interference of law, as their 
health does the aids of phyfic — Religion is (till reverenced, 
and they effeem a Chrijlian Church the beft temple of reafon. 
To mention politics might be extraneous and petulant, rather 
than fervlceable to the work for which this article is defign- 
ed, were it not that it becomes every good citizen, at a time 
like the prefent, to omit nothing that may any wife increafe 
public confidence, or allay capricious innovation. Indepen- 
dent in their fentiments, and in their circumftances, the peo- 
ple of Buittle, (like many of the county to which they be- 
lon/r) feem neither fo befotted as to imagine, that any human 
form of government is without infirmity, nor fo infatuated 
as to believe, that every thing is^wrong in our own, and that 
reformation muft be fought in anarchy. The apoftles of Mr 
Paine feemed at one time afliduous, and his works, (and 
works of lefs merit too), were as common as the church ca- 
techifm. They ar^ now forgotten. One idea has of late 

this

walls of caftles muft have been proportionally more flender than 
thofe of large towns. In either cafe, however, the quantity of 
wood in iuch builaings muft have been very great, and fufl^- 
cient to vitrify many kinds of ftone, if the wood was once fair- 
ly fet oa fire.

iiiore affefled the public mind. That fpirit of unity and in'^ 
divifibility, that is, of arrogance and depredation, which has 
fo fatally attra^ed the rabble of Paris, may prevail in 
Edinburgh or Glafgow :— Should that be the cafe, the 
peaceable and unarmed inhabitants of the country know 
what awaits them. On this principle, it is believed, more 
national guards might be enllfted in this quarter in one day, 
than all the declamations againft regal tyranny, or parlia- 
mentary corruption, could alTemble in a twelvemonth. The 
lowering the freehold qualification, and the abrogating or li- 
mititig the law of patronage, have been the ultimatum of 
propofed reformation in this country. 

Difadvafifages.—U thefe and the like are fpeculative and 
imaginary grievances, we have but few refal ones to complain 
of. Inftances, however, of this kind might be given. TW 
PENTE of the wsters, (as modern naturalifts fay), which is 
manifefted by the retreat of the fea on every weftern coaft, is 
abundantly remarkable on the fliores of the Solway Frith, 
Many acres there, which were barren fand 30 years ago, are 
now good pafture land; and in the middle of this arm of 
the fea, banks or mountains are daily increafing in fize, fo 
that they will foon be iflands, and will foon be arable. The 
confequent fhallownefs of the Frith, and of the river Urr, 
renders it therefore impoilible, that the navigation of the Urr 
can be carried on by vcffels much above 50 tons burden; 
and thefe can only find accefs at the ufual landing places, 
(and the moft ufeful), at fj)ring tides. Now, as the law 
flands, the fees, Sec. of the cuftom-houfe, are as high for a 
veflel of 50 tons as for one of 500, and as high for a boat 
of 5 tons, as for a floop of ^o. In a few years, however, the 
trade of this river muft be carried on, perhaps, by vefTels as 
fmall or fmaller than any we have mentioned ; and the pro- 
portioning 



Staiijlical Account 

portioning of cuftom-houfe fees, and the fhortening of de- 
lays incident or ufual there, will then be objcfts of corre- 
fpondent magnitude. But the Statistical Account is 
not meant as a magazine of grievances. May providence 
avert greater than we have felt, perhaps than we have ima- 
gined ! 

The author of this article, having thus noticed every thing 
in the parifh, where he does his duty, that he conceives help- 
ful to public utility, and connedcd with the patriotic work 
he would wifh to fupport, claims from the reader that in- 
dulgence, in refpea of literary endowment, which may well 
be looked for, by one who appears in print, from no view of 
profit or of praife, but (like many reverend gentlemen) from 
compulfion. Minus aptus acutis naribus—U it is now ac- 
cepted, he hopes it may be a while before he has occafion to 
repeat the above apology. Devoid of thofe brilliant talents, 
and ill fupported by that profound erudition, which Dodtors, 
Chaplains, and Aliuoners only poiTefs, the humble parfon of 
Buittle doubts if he has perfuaded the world, that in his 
humble parifli, " all is for the beft."— Happy fhould he be, in 
believing, that the fenfe of the public admitted things to be 
tolerable.

Situation. River^ Extenty ^c. 

THE parifh of Cupar is fituated in the middle of thtf 
peninfula of Fife. The river Eden divides it into 
two parts. It is of an irregular figure, meafui-ing from eaft 
to weft 5 miles, and neilrly of an equal extent from north to 
fduth. 

Eiymologies.—Thi etymolog;^ of the name of the parifli. 
is unknown. The names of different places in it are evi- 
dently of Gaelic original ; fuch as Pittencrie^y (Gaelic, Fit' 
nan-craobh), Englifh, the dale ; Kingajk^ (Gaelic, ceann-gaijk),

verned by a provoft, three bailies, a dean-of-guild, 13 guild 
counfellors, who choofe one another, and 8 tfades counfellors 
or -deacons, elefted by the 8 incorporations— The town of 
Cupar is the moft wealthy community in the county of Fife. 
Its annual revenue, at prefent, amounts to 430 1. Sterling. 
In conjunction with the towns of Perth, Dundee, St. An- 
drews, and Forfar, it fends a commiiEoner to Parliament. 
The revenue arifing from the poft-office, in 1763, was 20 L 
per quarter ; it now amounts to 90 1. Sterling per quarter.

Builaifigs; bfc. — Cupar, efpecially when approached by 
the turnpike road from the eaft, has the appearance of a 
neat, clean, well built, thriving town. The fireets, within 
thelaft twelve months, have been all completely paved at the 
expence of the corporation. There are no houies in ruins, 
and none untenanted. Upwards of a third part of the town 
has been rebuilt, during, the Lift 25 years, in a neat and 
handibme ftilc. Confiderable additions have alfo been made.

* The number of females, fo much exceeding that of the 
males, mull be accounted for chiefly from this circumftance, 
that the youth of Cupar, at all times forward to engage in the 
military life, are many of them, at prefent, abroad in the fer- 
vice of their country. The population has advanced rapidly 
cf late years, owing to the extenfion of the linen manufadlure, 
and to the increafed demand for hands employed in ercJling 
new buildings, and in carrying on important and extenfive im . 
provements in gardening and agriculture. 



Siati/iical Account 

No lefs than 70 houfes, chiefly for manufaaurers and labou- 
rers, have lately been built on St. Mary's Water, or, as it is 
called, the Lady Burn. A ftreet, in a better ftile, \L begun

fouth fide of the town, 

CW/^.—The parochial church of Cupar, in early times, 
flood at a confiderable diftance from the town, towards the 
north, on a rifing ground, now known by the name of the 
Old Kirk.yard. The foundations of this ancient building 
were removed by the prelent proprietor, in 1759 j and ma- 
ny human bones, turned up in the adjoining field by thq 
plough, were colkaed and buried in the earth. In the year 
1 415, this ftrufture had become ruinous, or incapable of ac- 
commodating the nqmbers who reforted to it. In the courfe 
of that year, the prior of St. Andrews, (the head of all the 
regular clergy in Scotland, and poffeffed of immenfe re- 
venues), for the better accommodation of the inhabitants 
of the town of Cupar, and that the rites of religion 
might be celebrated with a pomp, gratifying to the tafie of 
the age, eredted, within the royalty, a fpacious and magnifi- 
cent church. The year in which this eredlion took place," is 
afcertained by the following extra£l from the Book of Paifley : 
— " Sal : Hum. 1415. In Cupra de Fyfe fundata ejl nova 
parochialis ecclefia^ quae prtus dijlabat a Burgo ad plagam ho- 
' realem." This church was built in the beft ftile of the 
times, of poliflied free ftone, in length 133 feet, by 54 in 
breadth. The roof was fupported by tvyo rows of arches, 
extending the whole length of the church. The oak cou- 
ples were of a circular form, lined with wood, and painted 
in the tafte of the times. In 1785, this extenfive building 
▼vas found to be in a flate of total decay. The heritors of

on the fame fite, ,a church on a more convenient pUn. This 
plan they have accordingly carried into execution, at a very 
ponfiderlble ejcpence ; and the new church of Cupar is by 
far the moft convenient and elegant ftrufture of the kind, to 
be found at prefent in the county of F.fe. It is to be re- 
gretted, however, that the new building was not joined to 
the Ipire of the old church, which Hill ftands. The veftry, 
or feflion-houfe, by intervening between the church and 
fpire, gives a detached and aukward appearance to both. 
The fpire has always been confidered as a very handfomc 
Oruaure, and appears light and elegant when viewed from 
the eaft or weft. It was built by the Prior of St. Andrews, 
in 1415, only up to the battlement. All above that w^s 
added in the beginning of the laft century, by Mr William 
Scot *, who was for many years minifter of Cupar. 

County Room. — Duripg the period in which the church was 
eredted, the gentlemen of the copnty, by lublcription, and 
by an affeffment on their valued rents, bui^t on a large fcak, 
and in the modern talie, adjoining to the town-houfe, a 
room for their ufe at head courts, for their accommodation 
at balls, &amp;c. A tea-room, and other apartments, have fince 
been added.

receptacles of the accufed, the profligate, and the guilty 
--The prifons of Scotland, (if with propriety we can give 
that name to the dungeons in which, all over the kin^? 
dom, criminals are confined), accord but too well with the 
barbarifm which marked and difgraced that remote pe- 
nod, in which moft of them were creeled, and with that 
favage and illiberal fpirit, which feems to have dictated 
no inconfidcrable part of our criminal code. The pri- 
fon of Cupar, which is the public jail, for the very popu- 
lous and wealthy county of Fife, yields perhaps to none, in 
point of the meannefs, the filth, and wretchednefs of its ac 
commodations. It is, in truth, a reproach to the town in 
which it ftands, a difgrace to the county which employs it, 
and a ftain on that benevolent and compaffionate fpirit, which 
diftinguifhes and dignifies this enlightened age, and which has 
led it kindly to attend to " the forrowfui fighing of the prj- 
" foner," to meliorate his fituation, and foothe his woes. 
How would the feelings of the benevolent Howard, who, 
with unparallelled aftivity, and aftonifhing perfeverance, un- 
fhaken and unterrified, like a kind angel, went through every 
land, demanding and obtaining comfort to the wretched, and 
liberty to the captive !— How would his feelings have been 
Ihocked, if, in his compaffionate toiu-, he had turned afide 
iqto the peninfala of Fife, and vifitcd the cells of Cupar ! 

The apartment deflined for debtors is tolerably decent, and 
well lighted. Very different is the ftate of the prifon under 
it, known by the name of " the Iron-houfe," in which per- 
fons fufpedled of theft, &amp;c. are confined. This is a dark, 

damp.

damp, vaulted dungeon, compofed entirely of ftone, without 
a fire-place, or any the moft wretched accommodation. It 
is impoffible, indeed, by language, to exaggerate the horrors 
which here prefent themfelves. Into this difmal recefs, the 
beams of the fun can with difficulty penetrate. Here « is 
« no light, but rather darknefs vifible :" A few faint .rays, 
entering by an irregular aperture of about 9 inches fquaj*e, 
barely /"uffice to difclofe the horrors of the place. An open- 
ing, or flit, on another fide of the dungeon, thirty inches ia 
length by two in breadth, but almoft filled by a large bar of 
iron, ferves to admit as much frefh air as merely to prevent 
fuffocation. As the affizes for the county are held at Perth 
only in fpring and autumn, prifoners have frequently been 
doomed to lie in this cold dungeon, during the rigour of the 
fe-vereft winters.— The confequences may eafily be appre- 
hended. It is to be hoped, however, that the period is now 
happily arrived, when the landholders of Scotland, having 
more humane fentiments and enlarged views, than thofe who 
went before them, will attend to the wretched ftate of the 
different county jails, and be difpofed to follow the example 
of the neighbouring kingdom, in which, of late years, many 
prifons, bridewells, &amp;c. have been erefted, on plans of the 
iTioft extcnfiye benevolence, and of the foundeft and moft 
enlightened policy. A fum of money, adequate to the ex- 
pence of building a prifon on a modern improved plan a 
penitentiary-houfe, with accommodations alio for the defti- 
tute fick, might, it is believed, without much difficulty, be 
procured in the rich and extenfive county of Fife, were a few 
men of rank and public fpirit to patronize and fupport the 
benevolent attempt. "Were the fum to be levied from the 
three different orders of men, who are chiefly to be benefit-

and farmers, the proportion neceflary to be advanced by in-

feldom vifits his work-houfe or his (hop. and when the elec- 
tion has at length taken place, and the Icenes, wh.th Kad fo 
much engroircd and falcinated him, have van.lhed, he awakes 
to folitude and want, and, with extreme difficulry, can pre- 
vail on himlelf again to enter on the rugged tafks of patient 
induftry. But the (ucccfs of uianufaaures in Cupar has 
hitherto been retarded by another caule. of a very different 
nature, the great expence of land carriage. St. Andrew's, 
Leven, Newburgh, and Dundee, are the neareft fea- ports, 
though all of them are diftant 9 Englifli miles. Thus the 
manufacturer nnift bring to Cupar the raw materials he ufes, 
at a very heavy expence ; and his different articles, when fi- 
nilhed, cannot be again conveyed to the Tea fhore, but at an 
additional charge. 

Advantages to he derived frcm a Navigable Canal — To en- 
ab'e the induflry of the inhabitants to rile fuperior to this 
natural difadvantage, it has been fuggefted, that a navigable 
canal might be formed, nearly in the courfe of the Eden, as 
high as Cupar. The river falls into the fea about 9 miles 
below the town. The greater part of the channel is already 
navigable. The tide rifes as high as Lydox Mill, little more 
than 3 Englifh miles from Cupar. The fall from the town 
is very gradual, and to the place to which the tide rifes, 
thought not to uQ more than 26 feet. It is thus evident, 
that a navigable canal might be formed, as far as Cupar, at 
no very formidable expence. The advantages to be derived 
from this cut, to the inhabitants of the town and of the 
neighbouring country, would be great indeed, and could not 
be eafily calculated. Cup.ir is already the llore-houfe, to an 
cxtenlive tra61 of country, for iron, tar, ropes, bricks, tiles, 
wine?, fpirit', grafs feeds, foap, candles, f bacco, tea, fugar, 
fruits, and all kinds of groceries. The faving in the carriage

which prevail in this place, with remarking, that the fe^a- 
risg in Cupar live on good terms with their neighbours, the 
naembers of the Eftablifhed Church;— that their different opi-. 
nions in religion feldom interrupt the focial intercourfe of 
life, or prevent them from doing kind ofHces to one another ; 
— that a more liberal and benevolent fpirit begins at laft to 
prevail ; and that, except among a few, that gloominefs of

jj^;..— Though the parifh of Cupar is very populous, yet, 
during the laft 20 years, there have never been, at any time, 
more than from 4 to 7 beggars belonging to it. The num- 
ber of begging poor is at prefent 5- The number of poor 
houfe-hoJders, however, is very confiderable. Fifteen receive 
from the kirk-feffion a weekly allowance, proportioned to 
their various claims A fir greater number are fupplied oc- 
cafionally. Paroclual afleflments, for the maintainancc of 
the poor, in this part of the kmgdom, are yet unknown ; 
yet a more decent and adequate provifion is made for the 
fupport of the indigent in Cupar, than in moft parifties, 
perhaps, where thefe obtain, and where the population is 
equally great. The poor receive annually, coUedted at the 
doors of the 'hurch, beiween 70 L and Sol.-, and 16 1, as 
the intcreli of a fund in money, which has long been their 
property, — In a building which ftands near to the church, 
known by the name of the Alms-Houfesy and under the ma- 
nagement of the kirk- ffcflion, a few aged and infirm women 
are lodged, and, in part, fupported, out of the above fund. — 
But, befides the confiderable fupplies, which the poor thus 
receive from the ordinary parochial fund, they are indebted 
to the liberal fpirit of public bodies, and to the compafllon 
of individuals, for eflential and feafonable fupport The 
town of Cupar, greatly to their credit, give liberally out ojF 
the revenue of the burgh, to the indigent and diftreflTed. 
The incorporations, too, as far as their fcanty funds will per- 
mit, contribute to the relief of their decayed members. A 
fociety has been formed, among tradefuien and mechanics, 
which has the bappieft efFen:s. By contributing, when in 
health, a very fmall fum weekly, they provide for their 
fupport in ficknefs and old age. The ladies of feveral 
of the principal heritors of the parifli, who conftantly 
refide in it, have each of them their lift of weekly pen- 

fioncrs.

laid to have almoft no begging poor belonging to it, yet ther« 
is no town perhaps in Scotland, of the fame extent, where 
a greater number are daily leen infeiiing the ftreets. C.ipar 
being the principal thoroughfare, on the great turi.pike road 
leading through the county of Fife, and no plan being ftea- 
dily followed, to prevent the nua.erous vagrants paffirig from 
north to foiith, and from fouth to north, to beg the whole 
round of the town, the inhabitants are daily fubjeied to their 
iuiportunities and extortions. To the difgrace of the police alfa, 
feveral houfes are ftill to be found in Cup;ir, that harbour the 
idle and the profligate, from whatever quarter they come. 
In the day they prowl in the neighbourirrg country, giving 
out, that they are poor from the parifh of Cupar, and beg 
or plunder by turns, as opportunities offer. At i;ighr, 
•they return to the infm:i0us receptacles which they had kft 
in the morning, difpole there of their fpoils, and riot and ca^ 
roule, at the cxpence of the fimple, the fober, and the in- 
iultrious. In truth a iuni of money could not be laid, out 
by the community fo frugally, or io much to the advantage 
of the town and of the neighbourhood, as in hiring a per- 
fon, whofe fole bufinefs it ihould be to prevent foreign poor 
from begging in Cupar, and to apprehend all vagrant ftraa- 
gers, who cannot give a proper account'of themCelves. 

It is hoped, that it will not be deemed improper, or in any 
■degree difrefpeittul to the laws and conftitutioq of the coun- 
try, to conclude this article with obferving, that the a61s of 
the Parliament of iScoiland, intended to operate for the re- 
gulation and maintenarxc of the poor, are many of them be- 
come of little ufe, and inapplicable to the prefent flate of fo-

have often been ftated to the public. It is unnecefTarv here to 
repeat them. F rom what has been repre(ented, with refpcft to 
the maintenance of the poor of Cupar, it is evident that a de

a praflice, that has been attended with fuch pernicious effedls 
wherever it has been eftablifiied. If the landholders of Scot-

ot mini fters and kirk.feffions, in the management of the funds

refted m the comfort of thofe with whofe welfare their own 
profpenty is mtimately connefled— while they reprobate paro- 
chial affefTments, and all their baleful conlequences to fociety, 
they will chearfully follow the only plan, which, in many pa- 
Tilhes, can prevent their eftablifliment— they will regularly con-

two apartments, vrhich have feparate entries, and which have 
no communication with each other. In the one are taught 
Latin, French, Geography, &amp;c. ; in the other, Englifli, writ-

Eden on the fouth, and the ftream of St. Mary on the 
north, fenced from the violence of every tempeft, by the 
green and fertile hills which almoft encircle the town, and 
bound the plain of Eden, they often enjoy a happy exemp-

which frequently vifit and afflift tradts of country, at no 
very confiderable diftance. The running waters, which ne-

* Tames Wemyss, Efq; of Winthank, who was born In the 
bednning of 1696, died in the month of March laft, (1793) in 
his 98th year. This gentleman, whofe ftature did not exceed 
the common fize, but who was handfome and well made, pofief- 
fed a very uncommon degree both of bodily and mental vi- 
gour. Through the whole of life, he never failed to rife in the 
morning at an early hour ; was frequently on horfe-back ; was 
no enemy to the free circulation of the glafs, though, upon the 
whole, he might juftly be faid to be regular and temperate* 
He poffefTed, in an eminent degree, the politenefs peculiar to the 
laft age, and long remained a venerable fpccimen of the antient 
fchool of manners. He was the only perfon, the writer of thefe 
ftatements ever knew, who retained, in extreme old age, the 
fame ufe of all the mental faculties, which had been the poffef- 
fion and enjoyment of youth and manhood. When he was up- 
wards of 90, he not only regularly amufed himfelf, feveral hours 
every day, with reading, particularly hiftory, but could give 
a diftinift account of the fubjeft to which he was direfting his 
attention. He had never, in the courfe of his long life, been 
confined to his bed a fingle day by ficknefs. And even when 
he began to feel the gradual approaches of age, and decays of 
nature, he was in a great meafure exempted from the weak- 
nelTes and fufferin^s incidental to this mournful period. Though 
he was born in one century, and lived to fee almoft the conclu- 
fion of the next, and thus ought to have paffed through the fe- 
ven ages of human life marked by the Poet, yet the defcrip- 
tion of the laft ftage, given by the bard of nature, was by no 
means applicable to the concluding period of his exifteiice. He 
never, indeed, reached the " laft fcene of all, that ends the 
*' ftrange, eventful hiftory of man, fecond childiflinefs, and mere 
«« oblivion." Attacked at laft by the refiftlefs power of fever, 
he retired to his apartment, and, after a confinement of 4 days, 
yielded to the uuiverfal law of nature. 

The venerable Sir Robert Prkston, late minifter in the firft 
charge at Cupar, died in September 1791, having nearly com- 
pleted the lixty-firft year of his miniftry. He was firft admit- 
ted a minifter of the church at Arbirlot. in the county of An- 
gus, and cui-lived, during the couife of feveral years, all the

amounted to no lefs a number than 80 Mr William Miller 

of Star, and Mr Alexander Melvil of Kilmaron, were born in 
Cupar in the courfc of the fame year, and lately died in it, at 
no great diftance of time from each other, about the age of yo. 
The union of the laft of thefe two with his wife had bfifted 
upwards of 60 years — David Brown weaver, and his wife, who 
both lately died, had lived in the married ftate during the fame 
uncommon length of time. — There were living, about 10 years 
ago, 5 men in the town of Cupar, all confiderably upwards of 
90, and who all died nearly about the fame time, viz Walter 
Douglas, mufician, 96 years old; David Brugh, gardner, 95 j 
John Lorimcr, weaver, 94 ; James Anderfon,^ wright, 9 1 ; 
and — i Lumifdain, day-labourer, 92. The tirft of thefe, 
Walter Douglas, who died in his 97th year, was town-drum- 
mst, had ferved the corporation in that capacity 74 years, 
and, at the time of his death, might perhaps have been juftly 
accounted the oldeft office-bearer in the kingdom. He was 
of low ftature, but broad chefted and well built. Through the 
vhole of life, he could only command coarfe and fcanty fare, 
and knew none of the advantages of warm and comfoi table 
lodging. Angling was his favourite amufement, and he con- 
tinued to fifli on the river till v.ithin a little df his death. He 
was of a family in the town, who had long been noted for their 
longevity. His brother John died nearly of the fame age with 
himfelf, after having buried a fon upwards of 72. Some of the 
fame name ftill refide in the town, who preferve a ilriking hke- 
nefs to the family, who pofTefs the fame robuft appearance and 
vigorous frame, and who bid fair to equal the age of their fa- 
thers.

to riik a general action, complied with the requell. The prin-

Ooi'/ Hill, and which commanded a full view of the whole plain

Knox, having compietely delfroyed the religious houfes at

Tuch as Sin, Death, &amp;c.) were frequently exhibited The 
place, where thefc enrertainments were prcfented, was called 
the Playfield*. " Few towns of note," fays Arnot, in his 

Hillory 

• The pieces prcfented in the Playfield of Cupar, however, 
feem not, at ihe aera of the Relormation, to have had any con- 
nexion with religious lubjeds, but were calculated to mterel^ 
and an.ufe, by exliibiiing every variety of charaifler, and every 
fpecics of humour. To lUuflrate the manners which p'cvailed 
in Scotland in the i6th century, and as a fpccimen of the dra- 
matic compofitions which pleal(;d our fathers, Arnot, in ihe 
appendix to his Hiilory, gives a curious excerpi from a manu- 
fcript comedy, whicn hears to have been exhibited in the Play-

Agricultuve.—Y\kt though poffefling nr.tural advantages 
fuperior to thofe enjoyed by many neighbouring counties, 
was, till of late, far behind them in the important know- 
ledge, and valuable improvements of agriculture- — fhe her- 
ring fifhery, the making of fait, the burning of lime, and 
working of coal mines, circumftances which mirht naturally 
have been expelled to accelerate a nneliorated hufbandry, 
contributed long to retard its progrefs. Occupied entirely 
in the purfuit of thefe objefts, the great landholders in Fife 
were unhappily diverted from paying that attention to the 
furface of the ground, which would not have failed to have 
made a more certain and valuable return for the expcnce 
which they often incurred, and the activity and indullry 
they exerted. Daring the laft 15 years, however, in many 
diftri£ts of the county, the landholders and farmers have 
adopted and profecuted every plan ol modern improvement, 
with a degree of eagernefs, perfeverance, and fuccefs, not 
furpaffed in any corner of the ifland. That part of the coun- 
ty, in particular, which lies between the Eden and the Fay, 
naturally fertile, has been Inbjecled to a new and better mode 
of cultivation. The farmers in this diftrift, with a liberali- 
ty which does them honour, readily acknowledge, that they 
are indebted for many effential improvements, which are 
now general among them, to the example of thofe who have 
come to fettle in Fife, from the oppofitc country of the Carfe 
of Gowrie. 

Improvements, — The grounds adjoining to Cupar, on the

^ho have fpared no expence to drain and inclofe .hem who 
have enriched them vith abundance of manure, and en.- 
ployed them in a proper rotation of crops, have entirely 
char.Ped their appearance, and now afford a pleafing proof 
of the power of tultivation. From the improvements which 
have been mentioned, the ereftion of handfome houfes,- by 
the different proprietors, and the plantations which h.ve 
been formed, the whole prefents to the eye the appearance 
of what the French call ferine orne. 

Bills, Plantathm, es-^.-The country around Cupar can. 
not be laid to be level, as the grounds, in general, rife to a 
confiderable height on both fides of the Eden ; yet there 
are no hills in the pariQi, except thofe of WemyCs-hail and 
Kilmaron, both of which are cultivated to the top. There 
arc extenfive and thriving plantations on Cupar Muir, but 
no trees of age or fize, except at Carflogie and Tarvet, the 
family feat of Patrick Rigg, Efq; of Morton. At the laft 
mentioned place, the plealure grounds, laid out with tafte, 
around the fpacious and elegant houfe lately built there, de- 
rive much of their beauty from the appearance of the an- 
tient and lofty trees fcattered through the lawn.

ral of an excellent quality, black and deep, on a dry whin- 
ftone bottom. The foil on the fouth fide of Eden, as loon 
as you leave the valley, is cold and thin, and, in general, on

ber of acres, m proportion to the extent of the parifl, are

labour beftowed on it, by the inhabitants of Cupar, as that of 
the potatoe. Tljey have good reafon to join with thofe who 
affirm, that the potatoe is the richcfl: prefent, which the new 
world ever made to Europe. The produce of an acre is from 
40 to 100 bolls. The average crop, on good ground, 60 
bolls. The difeafe peculiar to this plant, known by the 
name of the curl, has not yet materially afl^e^ed the crops in 
the neighbourhood of Cupar. The kinds commonly plan- 
ted are, for the table, the long kidney, and the London dropper.

Roads, esfr.—Turnpike roads began to be formed in the 
parifh of Cupar, only within thefe few years. The meafure 
inet, atfirft, with almoft univcrfal oppofition from the adja- 
cent country. The farmers, fowever, have already entirely 
changed their opinion with refpcft to turnpikes ; they pay 
chearfully at the toll-bars, and feem, in general, to be con- 
vinced of the vaft importance and utility of the roads that 
have been formed. The turnpikes, in the neighbourhood 
of Cupar, are n^ade on an excellent plan, are formed of the 
beft materials, and contain a hard and foft, or fummer and 
winter road.— The crofs roads in the parifli are, in general, 
exceedingly ill kept} nor is it likely, that by the ftatute la- 
bour, as at prefent applied, they will ever be in better order. 
As improvements of every kind have advanced fo rapidly, 
during the laft 7 years, it muft appear an unaccountable de- 
fca, that To very common, and fo very ufeful a machine, as 
that of zJilUyard for weighing hay, coals, &amp;c. has never 
yet been ereftcd in the town of Cupar, nor on any of the

the price of provifions, till within the laft 30 years. An in- 
creafed population, and new modes of life, have of late oc« 
cafioned an immenfe additional confumption of filh, poultry, 
See. — In the Cupar market, beef, mutton, pork, and veal, 
fell at an average at 4 d. per lib. Dutch weight j hens, 13 d. 
each; geefe, 3 s. each; rabbits, 6 d. per pair ; pigeons, 3 d. 
per pair; butter, 9 d. per' lib.; beft cheefe, 5 d. ; coarfe 
cheefe, 3d. tron weight; oatmeal, 13 d. per peck; pota- 
toes, 44. d. ; eggs, 4 d. per dozen ; falmon, 5 d. per lib. — 
Though the price of provifions is thus high, and though 
there has been alio a great rife on the necelTary articles of 
leather, foap, fait, candles, &amp;c. yet the labourer at prefent is 
better lodged, better fed and clothed, and can give a more de- 
cent education to his children, than his father, who paid only 
6 d. or 7 d. for a peck of oat meal ; li- d. for beef and mut- 
ton per lib.; who bought eggs at i d. per dozen ; butter at 
5 d. per lib. ; cheefe at i i d. ; and haddocks in abundance 
at I d. or 2 d. per dozen. This improvement in the fitua- 
tion of the labourer is owing chiefly to thefe caulbs : i/. 
The proportion of the price of his own labour, and that of 
his family, to the price of provifions, is more in his favour 
than at any precedmg period. 2^/^, The introduftion of the 
potatoe, which has been long in general cultivation, affords 
a vaft addirional lupply of food to the labourer anJ his fa- 
n^ily, and enables him, at the fame time, to rear pigs and 
poultry. 3^, He can depend on being employed Ling 
the courfe of .he whole year, an advantage which his father 

who received only c d w (\a c u- . , * 
'7 5 cl. 01 6 d. for his day's work, could not 
always command.

CharaSler of the People. — The labourer and the mechanic 
arc in general able, by the exertions of their induftry, to 
make a decent livelihood for themfelves and their families •, 
they poffefs more forefight and economy than thofe of the 
fame rank in the neighbouring kingdom. They cherifh the 
laudable pride of not being indebted for their fupport to the 
parochial fund, or to the humanity of the charitable. They 
are in general contented with their humble fituation j friends 
to that government which extends protection and fecurity 
to their dwellings j and have had the good fenfe to reiifl: 
and to defpife the attempts of thofe, who have endeavoured 
to make them believe, in oppofitlon to their own happy ex- 
perience, that they are burdened, opprelled, and wretched.  

Marnier s. The manners of the inhabitants of Cupar, of 

better rank, are, in general, correal and polite. Gentlemen 
of the military profeffion, having fpent their youth in the fer- 
vice of their country, frequently fix their refidence here, in the 
decline of life. Formed in that fchool, which has long been 
diiVmguifhed by the eafe and politenefs which it communi- 
cates, they have contributed to diffufe an elegance of man- 
ners.' To this circumftance alfo, perhaps, it is in fome mea- 
fure owing, that families refiding in Cupar, and enjoying on- 
ly a limited and narrow income, make a decent and refpec- 
. table appearance; and are enabled, by habits of attention 
and economy, frequently to exercife an elegant hofpitality.

miles and one fixth. It is five m'les and a bait in length, 
and contains between 7000 and 8000 acres. — At the h.ad of

is ufcd in general. Farmers are not fo fond of fowing 
wheat as formerly. The culture of turnips is judged of 
more confequence, and keeps the land in good heart. A 
rotation of crops, as follows, has been adopted ; fallow, tur- 
nips, cats, pcafe, barley with grafs feeds, hay, pafture for 2 
years, oats, and then a fallow. Upon lighter ground, ijl, crop 
oats ; 2aly, Turnips, peafe, or potatoes j -^dly, Barley ; ^thly. 
Hay i then oats, &amp;c. as before. After this rotation, there 
is no need of a fallow,--The diftance from lime is 25 miles. 
—There is a marl mofs at the eaft end of the parifh, and 
another at the weft — The manure in both is of an excellent 
quality. Its effedts are more difcernible on grafs, than on 
land in tillage. There are other two moffes in the neigh- 
bourhood, at 4 miles diftance, from which confiderable 
quantities of marl are brought. The old maxim, " The 
*' fodder is beft which carries corn on its top," is entirely 
eScploded. Sir John Buchanan Riddell, proprietor of a great 
part of the parifh, and who propofes ftaying here, at leaft 
occafionally, is rapidly carrying on improvements. He has 
marl on his eftate, yet the expence mufl be confiderable. It 
is rot to be doubted but they will turn out to good account, 
and his plantations add to the beauty of the place. Swift 
obferves, « whoever could make two ears of corn, or two 
«' blades of grafs to grow, upon a fpot of ground where only 
" one grew before, would deferve better of mankind, and 
*' do more elTential fervicc to his country, than the whole 
« r^ce of politicians put together *." Oxen are not ufed in

In place of plowing matches, which fometimes are attended 
with a confiderable degree of confnfion, and feme difagreeable 
confequences among the fcrvants, might it not anfwer better, if, 
forinftance, the proprietors of ten ploughs were to colleil 50 s.? 
the land to be marled before fowing, and the whole work during 
tj^e feafon reviewed j a premium of 1 1. 5 s. to the beft upon the

Prices of Provifions and ia^^Jwr—Provifions are higli 
priced Butcher meat is often fold at a dearer rate than in 
Edinburgh ; butter at lo d. per lib. (24 oz.) a pair of fowls 
at , s. 8 d. fornaerly only i s. 5 cheefe 6 d. per lib. formerly 
o^d ; and other articles in proportion. The manner of 
living is greatly changed, being much more expenfive ; yet 
the farmers are In better circumftances, and much bettec 
lodged than they were 30 years ago. The wages of a man 
fervant are from 6 1. to 8 1. Sterling ; and thofe of a maid 
fervant from 3 1. 4s. to 3 1. xk,^. per annum. A day-labourer 
gets 10 d. with his ;neat, or is. 4 d- without it ; a taylor, 
8 d. with, or I s. without it i a wright, i s- 6d. i a mafon, 
I s. 6 d. ; a man for weeding potatoes or turnips, 8 d. In 
harveft, a man gets i s. 4 ^ woman, i s. a d. For 20 
years paft, work of every kind has rifen in expence one third. 
It is more than probable the rife will ftill be higher. The 
fchool fees alone are moderate. Some farmers have their 
corns threfhed for 4 d. per boll, with maintainance j a ditch 
3 feet deep dug, with the thorns let, at 8 d. per rood, and a 
double ditch at i s. 4 d. 

P.Qads^ Fuely Dl/eafes, ^c.—The roads are in a bad ftate, 
but will be put in good repair, as money for the ftatute la- 
bour is to be exafted, as far as law allows. One great incon- 
venience the people labours under, is the diftance from coab, 
which is not Icfs than 30 and 32 miles. Some peats may be 
procured here, but fo high priced, that coals at 15 s. the 12

^gucs, 20 years ago, were very fre- 
quent ,n the village, the road being almoft impaffabic on ac- 
count of putrid ftagnated water. This being removed, and the 
road formed and finifhed, aguifh complaints have almoft totally 
difappeared. It is unfortunate that this corner fhould be fo 
bare of trees, there being plenty of ground well adapted 
for large plantations, particularly of firs. The weedings 
would be ufeful as fuel; the body of the tree profitable, in 
a panfh fo remote from the fea coaftj and the ground en- 
riched by the leaves. 

Populaiion.^lt is generally believed, that the population is 
greatly diminifhed, there being veftiges of confiderable vil- 
lages, where now there ftand only one or two houfes. Since 
the year 1760, 9 farms have been added to fuch as lay adja- 
cent ; and though the rent of each was not very confider- 
able, yet the honeft tackfman cleared with the proprietor, 
and brought up and educated his children, who proved ufe' 
ful members of foclety. But whatever diminution may have 
lately taken place in the population of the parifh, from thefe 
and fimilar caufes, it is certain, that there has been an in- 
creafe upon the whole, within thefe 40 years, as appears from 
the following comparative flatement :

Mamifaaures.^'M.znj packs of lint, till of late, were fent 
from Darlington, by Newcaftle, to be fpun. The yarn was 
returned by the fame conveyance. At prefent the fplnners 
are employed by the manufaaurers in Hawick. The quan- 
tity of cloth woven for fale is not great. 

Eccleftnft'ical State, — This parifli belonged formerly to the 
diocefe of the Archbiftiop of Glafgow, who built tlie kirk 
betwixt the pth and loth century. There is paid to that 
univerfity, the yearly fum of 5 1. 7 s. 6\ d. called the BiJJjofs 
Coat. The kirk was rebuilt in the year 1 77 1, and is commo- 
dious and well feated. The Duke of Roxburgh is patron. 
The ftipend, at the converfion of grain, is about 1000 1. 
Scotch, and 50 1. ditto for communion elements. The manfe 
was built in the year 1 762, very fuperficially and confined. 
An addition was made to it 15 years after, and the houfe is 
this feafon to get feme necelFary repairs. The glebe is of a 
tolerable good quality, meafuring near 1 1 Englifh acres *. 

School. — The heritors, a few years ago, voluntarily raifed 
the fchool-mafter's falary from 100 merles to 100 1. Scotch. 
They are contrafting for a new fchool and fchool-houfe. 
His emoluments, as teacher, precentor, and feffion-clerk, do 
not exceed 1 7 1. per annum. 

Poor. — The poor are fupported by the intereft of 105 I. 
Sterling funk money, and an affeflment on the land, the one 
half paid by the proprietor, and the other half by the te- 
nant. The weekly collcdliions fupply fuch as occafionally

need affiftancc. When a perfon is admitted a pauper, a 
bond is figned, conveying a right to the heritors of what 
effe£ts they have. This prevents impofition. If in value 
the tfFeas exceed the expenditure, the furplus is given to 
the neareft relations of the deceafed. 

Antiquities * — In this parifh lies the feat of the ancient 

family 

* Upon inclofing the grounds of Bewliehill, the workmen 
came to loofe e irth, fott and black, and found a great number 
of human bones, feemingly burnt to a certain degree. The 
fpace was upwards of 20 ieet diameter, being of a circular form, 
and feems to have been an outport of a Roman camp, the vet-- 
tic;es of which are to be feen in a neighbouring parifli, at 3 miles 
dfftance. The rage of conqueft knows no bounds, but the Al- 
mighty brings good out of evil ; for, by the invafion of the Ro- 
mans, and the fuccefs attending their arms. Providence pave J 
the way for publiihing and introducing Chriftianity into this 
ifland. Military weapons have been found, and Ipears ftiarp oa 
both fides ; large quantities of human bones, feme with ribs 
adhering to the back bone; heads,' in fomethe teeth almoft freili. 
One body was pretty entire ; contiguous to it were the rinuius 
of a horfe. Frequent fkirmifhes had occurred in that corner of 
the parifh, with the foldiers of Charles H. A numerous party 
of Preftyterians, who were marching to join their brethren at 
Bothwell Bridge, being attacked by fome troops of dragoons, 
fled to Bewlie Mot's for refuge ; unable to extricate themlelves,' 
many periflied in the mud. When the old church of LiUies- 
Leaf was taken down, in 1771, there was found, below one of 
the feats, a coffin containing teveial hnman heads. We may 
fuppofe that they had been cut off by friends, that they might 
not be fixed upon the ports of any of the neighbouring bo- 
roughs, as it was not pofiible to drag out the bodies without be- 
ing difcovered. What a blefled toleration do we now live un- 
der? And if the conftitution under which we live, in the courfe 
of time, needs repairs, tender and delicate Ihould the hand be 
that touches it. Our fathers told us of frequent meetings in 
Lillies-Leaf inuir, for the worfhip of God. The devout aliem- 
bled at the hazard of their lives ; the place they chofe was retir- 
ed ; and one of their number was placed on a riling ground, to 
give the alarm on the appearance of danger. — Alexander.

not the very oldeft in Scotland *. 

CharaEler and Manners. — ^The people in general, a very 
few excepted f, are fober and attentive to bufinefs, there be- 
ing plenty of work for fuch as chufe not to be idle, or half 
employed. They are regular in attending the ordinances of 
religion, and many have made no fmall degree of improve- 
ment in Chriftian knowledge. They adhere ftridtly to the 

ttandards 

Home, great-grand- father of the wife qf the prefent minifter, 
a man eminent for his piety, and fimplicity of manners, came 
from the Me'rfe to join with his fuffering brethren in Divine 
fervice. Under the influence of that principle which «♦ thtnk- 
eth no evi/" he informed a gentleman, on his returning home, 
where he had been, who gave information to the fervants of 
government, whereupon he was apprehended, condemned, and 
Jianged at the Crofs of Edinburgh, 

* Tradition fays, this family fixed itfelf betwixt tha feventh 
and eighth century. A late well informed and elegant hifto- 
rian was of this opinion. As pofitive proofs, Walter Riddell 
of Riddell married Violet Douglas in 936. About and after 
that period, grants of land were made by the kings of Scot- 
land, and by fome of the Popes, particularly by Pope Alexan- 
der II. A place of worfhip was eretfled near the houfe of Rid- 
dell, which had a burying ground, called Chapel Park. When 
in tillage, human bones occafionally have been plowed up. 
This burying place was transferred to the prefent church-yard. 
Upon the outfide of Riddell ayle, there i$ infcribed H. R. 1110. 

•\ Previous to the rupture with America, a woman guihy of 
child-murder petitioned for banifiiment, which was granted. 
She denied to the father her being with child, and would not 
hearken to his propofals for marriage ; yet, fo violent was his 
attachment to this monfter of depravity, that he accompanied 
her to America, in the hope llie wopld relent, and at laU give 
him her hand — A well difpofed woman, upwards of 70 years 
of age, at times fubje^t to religious melancholy, alked of a 
neighbour a good book to read ; Amhroje's War •vjU/j DrSils was

a decent education. The fchool fees, for the children of 
inch as are not in good circumftances, are paid from the 
^.cekly colleaions. The Seceders of different denominations 
„e obliging in their manners far from a narrow contraacd 
fpirit, no clergyman could wilh for better neighbours.- 
There arc two political focieties a few miles diftant, who call 
themfelves the Friends of the People ; but, though they arc 
anxious to add to their numbers, not a fingle perlon m this 
parifti has joined them.-The drcfs both of the men and 
the women has undergone a moft furprifing change, within 
thefe 40 years. Thirty-two years ago, there were only 7 
hats in the church, but at prefent there are not as many 
bomuts.

(County and Presbytery of Peebles.-Synod Ob 
Lothian and Tweedale)., 

the Rev. Mr Patrick Robinson, Minijler.</head>

<p>

T 



Namey Situation^ and Extent. 
'KE village of Edlestown, from which this parlfl^ 
takes its name, is fituated 17 miles fouth from Edin- 
burgh, and 4 miles N. from Peebles, on the poft road from 
Edinburgh.-The length of the parifh, from N. to S. is 10 
miles, and its greateft breadth, from E- to W. 7 miles. 



Hill, Pro/pea, Lake, River, ^-r.— Dundroigh, or Druid's 
Hill, which is fituated two miks eaft from the church, is 
2100 feet above the level of the fea, from which, in a clear 
day, can be feen the Cheviot Hills, with part of Tiviotdale, 
Annandale, Clydefdale, PerthQiire, Fifefhire, the Frith of 
Forth, the city of Edinburgh, and the counties of Eaft, Weft, 
and Mid Lothians.— There is a lake about 2 miles to the n! 
E. of the village of Edleftown, nearly of a circular form, and 
about 2 miles in circumference. The only fpecies of fifli 
which it contains, are pikes and eels. This lake gives rife to 
the water of South Efk, which empties itfcif into the fea at 
Muffelburgh. Edleftown Water, which paiTes this village, 
J\nd runs into the river Tweed at Peebles, takes its rife from 

various 



va&amp;ous fprln^s 'on the north arid nofth-weft boundaries of 
the parifh, and at Cowey's Linn has a fall of 35 feet. There 
are no difeafes peculiar to this parifh. The ague is not known 
in it. In the year 1783, the poor were .liberally fuppUed ; 
and the Inhabitants of the parilh, during that year, were 
more free from ficknefs than ufual. 

Surface, Cultivation, Produce, Exports, b'^.— Though the 
^ greateft part of the parlfli confifts of hill ground, and is de- 
voted to the pafturage of fheep and black cattle, yet every 
sftorc farm, one excepted, and on ivhich a fhepherd only re- 
fides, contains as much arable land as occupies from one to 
three ploughs.— The crops confift of beans, Town grafs, oats, 
peafe, potatoes, and turnips. The cuhure of turnips and 
fown grafs hay, becomes every year more extenfive ; and as 
it is found profitable to the farmer, as well as ornamental to 
the country, there is little doubt that it will foon be general. 
—The produce, after fupplying the demands of the parifli, 
enables the farmer to export annually from 1100 to 1200 
bolls of bear ; and their exports of oats and peafe, taken to- 
-gethcr, may amount nearly to the fame number of bolls. 
The grofs rent of the pariih is doubled within the laft 20 
years. All the tenants are in a thriving ftate, and many of 
them are opulent. 

Prices of Provijtons and Labour,— -The ncareft market for 
provifiions is Peebles, which is well fupplied with meat of all 
kinds, the prices of which are nearly the fame as at Edin- 
burgh. The wages of fervants and labourers have increafed

Staii/lical Account 



Caufes of Depopulation.— Tht above extraft cannot afcertain 
the number of marriages which have aftually taken place 
within the parifh, as proclamation of banns is made when 
only one of the parties refides in it i but the regiftcr of bap- 
tifms applies ftriaiy to the ftate of the parifh, from which 
it appears, that its population has decreafed gradually fmcc 
the year 1762, which may be accounted for from the follow- 
ing caufes : Firft, 14 cottages, formerly occupied by married 
fervants, have been allowed to fall into difrepair. idl^. 
Twelve of the farmers are batchelors. ^dly. Two of thofe who 
are married have no children 4/% Other two do not refide. 
Sihly, Two are widowers. 6%, Of the 13 heritors, 8 are 
non-refident, iji which number ate included all the great land- 
holders ; and, laftly, of the remaining 5 who are refidcnts, 
only one is married, whofe landed property does not exceed 
17 1. Sterling per annum. It is therefore prelumable, that 
ibme of the above caules of the depopulation of this panlh 
may not be permanent ; and that at fome future period, \X 
may be reftored nearly to the population af the year 1775. 

Borfes and Black Cattle — Ali the above mentioned iock of 
horfes, black cattle, and fheep, are reared within the panrt]. 
The horfes are of the fame breed vrith thoie ufed for draught 
all over the fouth of Scotland. A few horfes are occalio» 
jaaily bred for fale, and bring from 10 to 20 jiuineas, accor- 
ding to their age or figure. Many black cattle are fold an- 
nually, fome in milk, and fome lean to graziers and feeders ; 
but more generally, fince the introdu^lion of turnip hufban- 
idry, they are fold fat to the butcher in February and March. 
Many of them arc fold at the fair, which is held annually for 
that purpofe, on the 25th of September. The average 
weight of cows bred here, is 30 (lone, and of full aged bul- 
locks, 



t/EdleJlon, iSg 

locks, 40 ftone ; but fomc of both" kinds confiderably exceed 
thefe weights. 

Sheep and JFcoL-Thc iheep arc all of thb Tweeddale 
breed The ftore-mafters leli their draught ewes with lamb 
in April, at from .10 1. to ill Sterling per fcore. Fat 
lambs are fold from the ift of July to the 2Sth of Septem- 
ber, and bring, at an average, 61. the fcore. Wedder and 
ewe hogs are fold in June, the former from 8 I. to 10 1. the 
fcore, and the latter from 61. to 81. per ditto; but the beft 
of the ewe hogs are referved as ftock. Ewes, which have 
not had lambs, are fold to the butcher in, July and Augull, 
at from lis. to 13 s. each j and old ewes, which have nur-. 
fed lambs, bring from 9 1. to 10 1. the fcore, in November 
and December. The yeld ewes weigh, at an average, 10 lib. 
Dutch, per quarter, and the old ewes 8 lib. per ditto, and 
carry from 3 lib. to 5 lib. tron of tallow. The flicep are all 
fmeared with tar and butter in November. They are fhora 
in June and July ; and the wool is fold from 5 s. to 7 s. pej?* 
ftone tron, according to its quality and cleannefs. 

Churc/j, School, and Poor.—Tht. church is fnppofed to be 
above 200 years old. Some of the feats in it bear date 
160©. The money Itipend, including too merks for com- 
munion elements, is 661. 13 s. Sterling, with 53 bolls 
I firlot I peck 2 lippies of meal, and 21 bolls i firlot i peck 
and 2 lippies of bear. Lord Eiibank is patron. — The fchool- 
mafter's falary is 8 1. 6s. 8 d. Sterling, befides 16s. 8d. as 
fcffion-clerk, and i 1. 6 s 8 d. Sterling, as colledlor of the 
poor's rate, which was eftablilhed here in 1752. — The annual 
affelTment on the heritors and tenants, by equal proportions, 
for 20 years paft, has been only 5 1. Sterling. The heritors 
and the minifler have a meeting on the firft Monday of May, 



Sfatljlical Account 



and another on the firft Monday of November annually, for 
fixing the quantum of the poor's rates, admitting penfioners, 
and granting them annuities, according to their neceffities 
There have been no beggars in the parifl, fince the eftablilh" 
«nent of a poor's rate. The penfioners on the heritor's lift 
are all houfe-holders, and receive from 2 1. to 3 1. Sterling 
per annum. They have a fund of 325 1. Sterling at intereft, 
vrhich IS annually increafing; and it is probable, that, a few 
years hence, it will not be neceflary to continue the parochial 
aflefTment. The one half of the weekly colleaions in the 
church, after paying the falarics of the feffion-clerk and kirk 
officer, is appropriated to the fupply of the poor who are not 
inrolled. 

Charaaer and Antiquities. ^Hht inhabitants of this parifh 
are generally oeconomical, induftrious, and regular in their 
attendance on the ordinances of religion.—There are no re- 
mains of antiquity in the parifh, excepting the veftiges of 
Viro circular encampments, vulgarly called rings.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q881185">BL AIR.GOWRII!</name> 
(County of Perth.— Presbytery of Meigle.— » 
Synod of Angus and Mearns.) 

By the Rev. Mr James Johnston, Minijler,</head>


<p>
Origin of the Name. 

THE name of the parifh is Blair-Gowrie, fo called 
from the village near which the church ftands. In 
old papers it is fomctimes written Blair-in-Goivrie, Various 
etymologies and interpretations of it have been fuggefted. 
Like many other names of places in the parifli, it is probably 
Gaelic. In that language Blaar is faid to be defcriptive of a 
place where rauir and mofs abound. Thus Ardhlair is the 
height in the muir or mofs. The muir of Blair- Gowrle, a- 
bounding with mols, is in the near neighbourhood of the vil- 
lage, ^he Waltonun of Blair ^ the Lochend of Blair ^ Little 
Blair y and Ardhlair^ are names of places on the borders of the 
muir. 

Extent^ Situationf Sutface, Soil, i^c.-^the extent of it is 
confiderable, being about 1 1 Englifli miles long from S. to 
N and in iome places not lefs than 8 miles broad ; but, (as 
muy be feen from Mr Stobie's map of Perthlliire), the figure 
is irregular, being frequently interfered by the parifhes of 
Kinloch, Bendochy, and Rattray. The connected part of it

Th?' "T- 'f'' '""^ broad. 

The par^flx ,s divided into two diftrias by a branch of the 

G amp.n mountains, which is the northern boundary of 
this part of the beautiful valley of Strathmore. The L 
thern diftria, which lies in the ftrath, is about 4 miles Ion., 
and from one to two miles broad. In general it is flat. The 
northern diftria, which includes the detached parts of the 
panfh, IS high ground, very uneven in the furface. The a- 
rable la,d in it is ia general floping, and, in many places, 
very fteep. The hills are moflly covered with heath. Some 
of them may be about 600 feet above the level of the fea. 
The fod m both diftrias, as may be fuppofed, is various. A- 
long the fide of the Ilia, it is a deep rich loam, free from 
Itones. Immediately north from that, it is a ftiff loan. upo« 
a till bottom, wet and fpouty. This laft is a prevailing foil 
an the panfh, and alfo a light dry earth full of ftones, on a 
gravel bottom. In many places there is a thin ftratum of a 
light black earth, either upon gravel or cold tiU. There are 
confiderable trac^ of hill, muir and mofs, and more than 
1 000 acres are covered with wood. Not above a third part 
of the parilh confifts of arable ground. 

Climate and Difeafes. — The climate varies in different parts 
of the parifh. It is often mild and temperate in the fou- 
thern diftria, while it is fharp and cold in the northern. A 
remarkable difference is felt, on leaving the former to go to 
the latter. In both, however, the air on the whole is very 
falubrious, and the inhabitants are not fubjea to any pecu- 
liar diftempers.. Formerly, indeed, the lower part of the pa- 
rifli was much diftreffed with the ague, but fmce fome of the 
lakes have been drained, that difeafe has totally difappeared. 
The rhcumatifm is the moft common diforder, particularly 
si,tnong the poorer clafs of the people, when well advanced

!n life. Inoculation for the fmall-pox is now a good deal 
praaifed, and is almoft always fuccefsful in preventing the 
fatal cffeds of that difeafe. There are no inftances of extra- 
ordinary longevity in the pariOi at prefcnt, yet there are many 
perfons living and vigorous, who are above 70, and fome above 
80. There is only one perfon above 90.' It may be here 
mentioned, that the lady of a confiderable proprietor in the 
parifli died not long ago, who faw in her own houfe eighty- 
four returns of Chriftmas. The manfion-houfe is clofe ad- 
joining to fevcral lakes. 

Riversy Cafcades, Ftp), Birds, Scenery, The IJIa, which 
wafhes the northern part of this parilh, is the moft confider- 
able of our rivers. It has been frequently mentioned in former 
reports* As its banks are low in this parilh, it often fuddenly 
oversows them, and occafions confiderable lofs and difappoint- 
ment to the hufbandman. This was remarkably the cafe ia 
harveft 1789. — The next in fize is the Ericht, which, from, 
its rapidity, has acquired the appellation of the Ireful Ericht. 
It is formed by the junilion of the ^rdle and the Black- 
Water, It runs along the eaft fide of the parifli for about 
9 miles. Its channel in general is very rocky and uneven, 
and it often varies in its depth and breadth. The banks in 
many places are fo low, that it frequently overflows them, 
and does confiderable damage, cfpecially in harveft. In other 
parts they rife to a great height, are very rugged, and often 
covered with wood. About two miles north from the village 
of Blair-Gowrie, they rife at leaft 200 feet above the bed of 
the river ; and on the weft fide are formed, for about 700 
feet in length, and 220 feet in height, of perpendicular rock, 
as fmooth as if formed by the tool of the workuian. The 
place where this phenomenon is to be fcen is called Craig- 
Imh, where the traveller may be furiiHhed with one of the

moft romantic fcenes in North Britain. Here hawks neftle, 
and their young ones have been frequently carried away by 
falconers from difFerent parts of the kingdom. Here, alfo, 
the natural philofopher and botanift may find ample amufe- 
mcnt. Two miles farther down this river is the Keith, a na- 
tural cafcade, confiderably improved by art. It is fo con- 
ftrudled that the falmon, which repair in great numbers to it, 
cannot get over it, unlefs when the river is very much fwel- 
led. The manner of fifiiing here is probably peculiar to this 
|)Iace. The fifliers during the day dig confiderable quanti- 
ties of clay, and wheel it to the river fide immediately above 
the fall. About fun-fet the clay is turned into mortar, and 
hurled into the water. The fifliers then ply their nets at 
difFerent ftations below, while the water continues muddy. 
This is repeated two or three times in the fpace of a few 
hours. It is a kind of pot net, fallened to a long pole,, that 
3s ufed here. The river is very narrow, confined by rocks 
compofed of fand and fmall ftones. The fecnery, efpecially 
on the vsreft fide, is very romantic and beautiful. Many gen- 
tlemen from all quarters repair to this river for amufement. 
From the Eeith for about two miles down the river, there is 
the beft rod fifhlng to be found in Scotland, efpecially for fal- 
mon. The fifiiing continues from the beginning of April 
to the 26th of Augufl:. The fifhing with the pot net is con- 
fined to a fmall part of the river, near the Keith. When the 
water is very fmall, which is often the cafe in fummer, the 
£fla are caught in great numbers, in the different pools, with 
a common net *. They are neither fo large nor fo rich as 
thofe of the Tay. The fifliing on this fide of the river was

Lakes, Iflands, ^..-The parifh abounds with lakes of 
different fiies. Till lately there were more, but lome have 
been drained, and now lupply the neighbourhood with peats 
and marl *. in the lakes which ftill remain, great quantities 
of pikes and perches are caught, partly with the rod, anc. 
partly with nets. They are much frequented by wild towis 
of different kinds. In the middle of one of them are the 
remains of an old building on a fmall ifland in it, in which 
tradition fays treafures were concealed in perilous times. A 
diftria in this county is faid to have acquired the appella- 
tion of Storemotmt from this circumftance. Curling is an 
exercife at which the inhabitants of this diftridt excel. 

Minerals and Mineral Springs.— Thtve is no lime-ftone in 
the pariOi, neither is it well fupplied with free-ilone, though 
there are two quarries of this kind. Some whin-ftone qua- 
ries have been wrought, and muir-ftone is found in great 
plenty. There is one chalybeate fpring In the Cloves of 
Mawes, which was formerly much rcforted to by perfons in 
its neighbourhood. It has been ufed, it is faid, with fuccefs 
in fcorbutic diforders. There are appearances of feveral

Population — No dependence can be had on the pari/h re- 
^ifter, for the number or proportion of births and burials. 
This may in fome meafure be accounted for, from the gteat 
influx of emigrants from other parifhes, efpecially from the 
J-Iighlands, who fettle here as fervants, &amp;c. By comparing 
the report made to Dr Webfter, however, with tl^e refult oif 
an accurate enumeration made in Oftober, November, and 
December 17931 enabled to ftate the cxa£l increafe, 

which is but fmall in proportion to the influx of ftrangers 
within thefe 40 years.

ManufaEiures, Mills, ^c.—Thc principal branches of ma- 
nufafture carried on in the parifti are fpinning and weaving. 
The women fpin with both hands.— Befxdes the flax ralfed 
in the parlfli, confiderable quantities of foreign flax are fpun ; 
and the yarn is either wove in the parifti and neighbourhood, 
or fent to Dundee. Confiderable quantities of houfehold 
cloth are wove here, and about 50,000 yards of yard-widcs, 
part of which is bleached in the neighbouring parifh of Rat- 
tray ; but a greater proportion is fold in the village of Blair- 
Gowrie, and fent green to London. There are 7 meal mills, 
2 lint mills, and i fulling mill in the parifli. The rate of 
multure paid at the meal mills, is, in general, about a twelfth 
part of what is ground. 

Cattle. — A good number of horfes are reared in the parifk. 
They are of very different fizes and value. A confiderable 
proportion of them are very good draught horfes, but a ftill 
greater proportion are fmall and ill kept. The former kind 
are worth from 15 1. to 25 1. each ; the latter, from 8 1. to 
12 1. Many black cattle are alfo reared in the parifli. Thofe 
in the northern diftridl: are very fmall, but they are confi- 
derably larger in the other. Great numbers arc fold out of 
the parifli, when 3 or 4 years old, particularly of the ftots. 
The flock of fheep is much diminiflied. They are moftly 
{ of the white-faced kind, of a very fmall fize, and are fold at 
from 6 s. to ps. a-piece. Their wool fells at about 14 s. per 
frone. From 8 to 10 fleeces go to a ftone. Too little atten- 
tion is paid to this valuable animal in this parifli. 

Prices of Prov'ifions and Labour. — A boll of oat meal, wcigh» 
ing 8 ftones, fells, at an average, at from 14 s. 8 d. to i() s. i 
a boll of wheat at 20 s. ; barley at 15 s. j oats at 13s.; and 
peafe at 13 s, 4 d. Beef, rautron, and pork, arc fold at from

feed fown in her matter's grouud, or an equivalent for it, if 
he be not a farmer. 

Ecclefioftical State, Schools, 6r.-The ftipend, as fixed by a 
decreet of the Court of Teinds, in 1791, is 5 chalders of 
grain, two thirds meal and one third bear, with 45 1. Ster- 
ling of money, and 5 1. for communion elements. The 
glebe contains 9; acres, of which 4^ are good foil ; the other 
5, lately obtained in lieu of grafs ground, are of an inferior 
quality, and at a confiderable diftance from the manfe. The 
right of patronage is vefted in Colonel Allan Macpherfon of 
Blair- Cowrie, and Colonel William Lindfay of Spynie, ia 
confequence of his marriage with one of the co-heirefles of 
Ardblair.—The church ftands on high ground, about 200 
yards north from the village of Blair- Gowrie, having a deep 
den, planted with different kinds of trees, immediately be- 
hind it. It was built in 1767, and is a plain fubftantlal edi- 
fice, at prefent in good repair, but cold in winter. It would 
be much improved with being ceiled, and having porches at 
the doors, which are In the ends of It. The manfe and a 
fet of offices were built in 1771 j but the offices were fo ill 
executed, that, after the prefent incumbent was fettled, It was 
found mora expedient to rebuild than repair the greater part 
of them, which was accordingly done. Both manfe and 

offices 



Siatijlical Aceouni 

offices are now In good order, as are alfo the fchool anl 
fchool.houfe. There is one eftablilhed fchool in the parifh, 
m which reading Englifh, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, 
and fome branches of mathematics are taught. From 30 to 
50 fcholars attend, according to the feafon of the year. Ths 
prefent teacher, who has long taught fuccefsfuliy, lately ob. 
tained a fmall augmentation of falary ; but even with this 
addition, it is only 200 merks. The fchool fees are, per 
quarter, i s. for reading Englifh ; i s. 6d. for writing, arith- 
metic, and Latin. The whole emoluments, exclufive of a 
free houfe, do not exceed 22 1. a year, a reward by no mean* 
adequate to the abilities and application of fo important an office. 
There is one charity fchool occafionally taught in the head 
of the parifh. In the winter feafon, there are two or three 
private fchools kept up by the tenants, in corners remote 
from the parochial fchool. 

Poor.-^ThtTt are no begging poor belonging to thepariffi. 
For many years paft, the average number on the poor's roll has 
been 14. The heritors and kirk-feffion meet twice a year to fet- 
tle the roll. From 2s. to 5 s. are given to each monthly, accor- 
ding to their refpedlive circumftances. They alfo receive occafi- 
onal donations, efpecially in winter. Occafional charities are 
likewife given to individuals, and families not on the roll, 
which is attended with good effects, and often prevents them 
from coming on it. The fund for the fupport of the poor 
arifes from the intereft of a fmall ftock, from the colleaions at 
the church doors, from the dues of the mort-cloths, and from 
the rent of the feats in the galleries of the church, amount- 
ing in all to about 35 1. Sterling. The fum expended has 
not varied very much for thefe 16 years paft, except in 1783, 
when it was much greater, than in any other year of the pe- 
riod mentioned. The members of the kirk-feffion arc very 

careful 



cf Blair-Gowrte, 



careful in guarding, on the one hand, againft impofitlon, and, 
en the other, that no neceffitous perfon be neglefted *. 
Though there are no begging poor belonging to the parifh, 
vet the parifliioners are much opprelTcd with beggars and va- 
grants from other diftrifls, many of whom are very worth- 
lefs. 

Village and Markets, bfc The village of Blair- Gowrie is 

pleafantly fituated on the north fide of Strathmore, almoll clofe 
upon the river Ericht, It was made a borough of barony, by 
a charter from Charles I. in 1634. The whole of it be- 
longs, in property or foperiority, to Colonel Allan M'Pher- 
f^n, who is proprietor of about a fourth part of the parifli. 
The fituation of the village is very healthy, and it is well 
fupplied with water. — There are 3 fairs held in it annually, 
and fomc attempts have been made to have a weekly market 
in it, but with little fuccefs. The village is well fupplied 
with butcher meat and other articles. Ic has increafed very 
much within thefe few years. As it is fituated on a military 
road, any of the inhabitants may retail ale and fpirits, on pay- 
ing t s. annually. There are no lefs^than 19 dram-lhops ia 
it, which mufl: be attended with bad conlequences to the mo- 
rals of the people. 

Bhac/j field, Cloth, Stamp- office, 6^.— There is a bleach-fitid 
in the pariili of Rattray, about a mile from Blair- Gowrjc. 
The cloth is whitened as it is fcnt from different quarters. A-

 In 1782, the harveft was late, and the crop was much inju- 
red. In 1.783, the meal was fcarce and high-priced. The kirk- 
f-llion employed the poor's Rock in purchafmir meal at a diftance, 
^yliich was fold at prmie cod. A fmali proportion of the- bai-ley 
irieal, voted by Parliament for the relief of the HighLmd!;, was

wove in the parifli. The cloth fells at about 84, d. per yard. 
Confiderabie quantities of houfehold cloth, and fome Heffiaa 
ftiifFs are alfo wove in the diftria.—There was formerly a 
fiamp-office for ftamping cloth in the village. This was difcon- 
tinued for fome years, but was again cftablifhed in 1 7 85. The 
following abftracl was taken from the books, containing the 
number of yards ftampcd for the laft 8 years ; and refers not 
only to the cloth wove in the parifla of Blair- Go wrie, but aL

to what is whitened at the bleach-field.

Ztate of Property, Inclofuresy ^c. — There are 22 heritors, 
nnd a great many feuers in the village of Blair- Go wrie. Onfy 
one of the greater heritors refides in the parifh. Many of 
them are poflefled of confiderabie eftates in other parifhes. 
Moft of the fmaller proprietors refide upon, and farm part of 
their own property. The real rent cannot, therefore, be eafily 
afcertained. Good ground, in farms, gives from 15 s. to 21s. 
and fome of it 30 s. per acre. The land around the village 
lets at from 30 s. to 43 s. The number of acres in the parifli 
is not known, as part of it has not been meafurcd. Some 
progrefs has been made in inclofing, within thefe 6 years, but 
ftill at leaft three fourths of the parifli lie open, and very 
few farms have been fubdividcd. The inflofures arc cither

ftone dykes, or hedge and ditch. Probably fufficient atten- 
tion is not paid to this laft kind of fence ; the young thorns 
fliould be more cheriflied and better defended, in order to 
fecure good fences. One property in the northern diftrid is 
almoft completely inclofed and fubdivlded, and lets, from 
year to year, confiderably higher for pafture than it would 
Jo upon an ordinary leafe for tillage. About 4 7^3" ago, 
above a fourth part of the parifh was fold at 36 years pur- 
chafe, and is likely to turn but a good bargain. The rent of 
land continues to rife in this parifh. 

Agriculture, Produce, l^c.—T^Q ploughs are of the Scotch 
make, confiderably improved. Within thefe 1 2 years, there has 
been a very confiderablc alteration in the mode of plowing. 
In general the plough is now drawn by two horles, and driven 
by the man who holds it. In breaking up old ley, or in 
giving the firfl. plowing to ftifF ground, ' 3 horfes are fome- 
times yoked i and, in one or two corners, the plough is drawn 
by 4 horfes yoked a-breaft, and driven by a man who holds 
the hor/es by the halters, and walks backwards. In general 
the farmers in the northern diftridt are very induftrious j buc 
they are only emerging out of the old method of culture. 
The diftinftion of out-field and in field ftill takes place in fome 
degree. Turnips and fown grafs are only beginning to find 
their way into this diftridl. The want of inclofures, and 
•winter herding, are great obftacles to their progrefs, particu- 
larly in th(»fe corners where flieep are kept. The tenantry 
here labour under many difadvantagcs. Much of their time 
in fummer is confumed in procuring fuel ; they are far from 
manure •, the ground lies open, is full of baulks and large 
ftones, and In fome places it is very wet and fpouty. This 
laft circumftance, with the coldnefs of the climate, many 
plead as an apology, for not having more of their farms in 

fowji

fown grafs for fummer feeding and hay. They allow that 
white clover and rye grafs fucceed with them, but complain 
that the roots of the red clover are frequently thrown out in 
fpring. Inclofing, draining, and clearing the ground of 

ftones, are much wanted in this diftria The crops raifed 

in it are barley, oats, potatoes, a fmall proportion of peale, 
turnips, fown grafs, and fome flax. All the flax railed in the 
pariih is fpun in it ; and the rents of many of the fmaller farms 
are moftly paid, with the money got for the yarn, fpun in the 
ivihter months. 

Improvements^ Farm Rents^ Greater progrefs In im- 

provement has been made in the fouthern diftriiH:, than in 
the other. Here the new method of hufbandry is more ge- 
nerally pra^lifed, • and excellent crops are raifed of wheat, 
peafe, barley, oats, potatoes, turnips, grafs, and alfo fome 
flax. But even here fuflicient attention is not paid to a proper 
rotation of cropping. The following rotations are moft uni- 
•verfally obferved. Where wheat is raifed, the rotation is this ^ 
after grafs comes oats, then fummer fallowing ; then wheat^ 
peafe, barley, oats with grafs feeds. The dung is given tq 
the wheat. In the diviuon for peafe, potatoes and turnips 
are raifed along with the peafe, and get a little dung. Some- 
times the grafs is kept 2 or 3 years,, but more frequently 
only one year. On the farms where wheat is not fown, the 
following rotation takes place : After 3 crops of grafs, th? 
ground is broken up for oats, of which pne crop is taken. 
The oats are followed with turnips, potatoes, and peafe in 
one diviflon. Barley, with grafs feeds, fucceeds the green 
crop. The dung is given to the green crop. In the divi- 
Con for oats, a proportion of flax is fown, and not unfre- 
quently a crop both of barley and oats is taken after the 
green crop and the grafs feeds in that cafe are fown with

the oats. The farms in both diftfias afe of differ-ent fizcs, 
from 10 1. tb 130 1. Part of the parifti is Ifet in frtiall pcflef- 
fiohs of a few acres to trades people, add this is one reafon 
for the great number of ploughs and horfes ; as there ate 
often a plough and twb horfes, where the poffeffion does 
not exceed twelve acr6s. Where the farmer does not 
carrv on his work with the affiftance of his children, it 
is generally dbne by ffervdhts vho hve ih the family, except 
in harveft, for which additiotial affiftance is fecured fon^e 
months before. Sometimes a houfe, kail-yard, and an ac^e 
of land, are given to trades people, who pay their rent by 
affifting in harveft, atid at turnip cleaning. Oats are fown 
from the middle of March to the middle of April i then 
peafe and lint-feed. Bear is fown in May, and turnips in 
Jurte. The harveft generally begins in the end of Auguft : 
It is fomevvhat later in the northern diftridl. The parifti 
more than fuppiies itfelf vvith grain ; confiderable quantities 
of it, particularly of barley, are fold out of it. 

Roads and Bridges. — The great road, from Coupar of Angus 
to Fort George, pafles through this parifti. It was made at 
the expence of Government, and is kept in good repair by 
the ftatute labour of thfe country, with the occafional affift- 
ance of military parties: It is regretted, that a different di- 
rection was not given it, after it reached Blair-Gowrie. Had 
it been made to crofs the Ericht at Blair- Gowric, run a- 
long the eaft fide of that river, re-crofs it near Craig-faall, 
and keep lower down in its courfe through Mawes, the high 
ground, over which it now pafles, would have been avoided, 
and the traveller would have been faved many a long and 
fteep afcent. The great road from Dunkeld to Kirriemuir 
alfo paftx:s through the parifti, and cuts the military read at 
right angles : It is kept in tolerable repair. The crofs roads 
^re many. Till lately, the ftatnte Ij^bour was exaded ir^

lued rent. There are no turnpikes. Befides many fmall 
arches over fmall ftreams, there are 4 bridges, two on the 
military road, one over the Black-Water, and one over the 
Ericht. The two laft were built by fubfcription. 

Gentlemen^ s Seats. — -Newton-House, once the feat of 
the proprietors of the Barony of Blair-Gowrie, and lately 
poffeffed by the prefent proprietor, is an old building, fome- 
thing in the ftile of a caftle *. It ftands about the middle 
of the fouth Hope of the range of high ground, which bounds 
Strathmore on the north, and has a moft commanding view, 
not only of Strathmore, but alfo of part of different counties. 
—-About half a mile farther weft, lies the manfion-houfe of 
the old family of the Blairs of Ardblair. That family were 
long the proprietors of a moft extenfive property in the pa- 
rifti, and are ftill poflefled of a fifth part of it. 1 he manfion- 
lioufc feems evidently to have been furrounded with water 
on three fides. The lake has been drained, and a confider- 
able treafure of mofs and marl has been thus difcovered. — 
The proprietor of Blair-Gowrie and Mawes lately built a 
moft fubftantial and commodious houfe, with offices, about a 
quarter of a mile fouth from the village of Blair-Gowrie, on 
a beautiful flat near the banks of the Ericht. When the 
planting has got up, it will be a moft delightful habitation.

^«^;j«;V/V/.-There are the remains of feveral Druidical

is a circular mound, or mote-hill, where,, it is fa.d,Earl Gow- 
rie held his regality courts. It confifts of ftrata of earth 
and gravel, and is furrounded on the top with a dyke of the 
fame materials. There are fome largfe cairns *. Befides 
thefe, there are many fmaller tumuli running through the 
parifli in different dircdlions, from an encampment in the 
aeighbouring parifli of Kinloch f . 

Difadvantages.-^The time confumed in providing feed 
corn and turf, and in bringing coals from Perth and Dundee, 
is a great bar to improvement. The diftance from thefe 
towns is a great difadvantagc. This will, in fome meafure, 
be removed by the propofed bridge over the Ifla, near its 
junflion with the Tay, and the road leading from the bridge 
to Perth, which will ftiorten the diftance from this parifli to 
that town about 4 miles. The tenants are beginning to bring 
lime from Perth they will do it more cafily, when the road 
is made and the bridge built. Converting into money the

in diforder. Many of them were killed in their flight through 
this parifh. This opinion feems well founded, and is probably 
"well fupported, by thofe who are more concerned to defend it.

Situaiiofij Extent, Rivers^ Surface^ and Soil. 

CARDROSS is wafhed on the eaft border by the river Le- 
ven, and on the fbuth by the Frith of Clyde. Its 
length, from Dumbarton Bridge to its boundary with the pa- 
rifh of Row, is about 7 miles ; its breadth, from the conflux 
of the Leven and Clyde to its jundion with the parifli of 
Bonhill, is 3 miles. The fituation of the parifh is peculiarly- 
beautiful : The Clyde runs for 7 miles along its coaft, and, 
being partly oppofite to the flourifhing towns of Port-Glaf- 
gow and Greenock, it commands a profpe^l: of the whole 
Ihipping, that great fource of induftry and wealth to the 
wettern part of Scotland. The ground along the Frith has a 
gradual afcent from the fhorc, for upwards of two miles, till 
it terminates in a ridge of hills, which feparate it from 'the 
lands in the neighbourhood of Leven and Loch-Lomond. The 
foil contiguous to the Ihore is of a light gravelly nature ; but, 
at a fliort diftance, it contains a confiderable mixture of clay. 
The lands adjacent to the Leven partake foniething of the 
nature of carfe.

Agriculture.— .Vzrmmg has not yet made that progrefs, 
which, from the advantageous fituation of the parifli, might 
have been expeaed. It has, however, for thefe lo years 
paft, been making rapid advances. In order to promote this, 
the proprietors have contributed much. Befides their own 
example, which feldom fails to produce in the end the beft 
effeas, they have inclofed almoft the whole grounds, and 
laid them out, in many places, in fuch divifions and fubdivi- 
fions, as are beft fuitecT to their refpeaive farms. Farmers, 
and, indeed, men of every defcription, overcome with diffi- 
culty prejudices which they have early imbibed. Thefe pre- 
judices operate as a fecond nature, and, for a long time, bid 
defiance to the foundeft arguments. It is a praaice in this 
parifh with many, of never beginning to plough till the loth 
day of March. However inviting the feafon may be prior to 
this period, it matters nothing ; they adhere to the cuftom of 
their fathers. To begin folBncr, it is thought, would prove 
detrimental to the foil, and injurious to the enfuing crop. 
This late plowing occafions a late feed-time, and of courfe a 
iate harveft, a circumftance which is, for the moft part, ac- 
companied with many difadvantages. This prejudice, how- 
ever, is beginning gradually to lofe its influence, and in a 
ihort time, it is hoped, it will be effcaurJly removed. 

Prcduce. — The common produce of the parifh Is oats and 
bear ; and, of late, where the foil is of a flronger quality, 
confiderable crops of wheat, peafe, and beans are raifed. Po- 
tatoes are every where cultivated. The farmers, within thefe 
few years, have begun to fee the advantage of green crops ; 
accordingly a number of fields are laid down in clover and 
yye-grafs, but the culture of turnips is only in its infancy.

Manure. —Thtrt is plenty of lime-ftone on the lands of 
Camis-Efkan, the property of the family of Colgf ain : Large 
ijuantities are regularly burnt, with which the neighbourhood 
is fupplied. The expence of burning is confiderable, as the 
coal is brought by water from Glafgow, at the rate of be- 
tween 5 s. and 6 s. the 12 cwt. On the fhore there is a good 
deal of fea ware driven in, during the winter and fpring, 
which is carefully coUefted, and when laid upon lee ground 
proves an excellent manure. Befides this, which is called 
bloiun ivare^ large quantities of it are cut every third year. 
This, adhering to the ftones and rocks within water-mark, 
grows in three years to a confiderable length, and contains a 
greater abundance of thofe falts and juices which promote 
Vegetation. As Cardrofs lies oppofite to Port-Glafgow and 
Greenock, and as the Frith is only from 2 to 4 miles in 
breadth, there is an eafy accefs by water to thefe towns. In 
confequcnce of this, it has become an object of great impor- 
tance to the farmer to import from them ftreet dung i and, 
although this is done at great expence, each full cart, includ- 
ing every charge, amounting at leaft to 2 s. Sterling, yet the 
returns amply compenfate the whole trouble and outlay. 

Drainingy l^c. — Few of the farmers in this pari/li are pof- 
felTed of a capital, fufficient for carrying on extenfive im- 
provements. They with difficulty flock their farms, which 
are rented in general from 20 1. to 50 1. Sterling. They em- 
brace the readiefl: methods in their power, of raifing articles 
to pay their rents, and cannot afford to wait thole diftant, 
though fure returns, with which the improving farmer muft 
lay his account. Before this parifh can be improved, a large 
capital mufl be employed in draining. The climate, hke that 
of every other parilh near the mouth of the Clyde, is wet. 
In confequcnce of the heavy, and almoft inccffant rains, 

which 



212 



Staiijiical Accounl 



which fall in the harveft and winter months, the lands are 
for a long time drenched in water, and, of courfe, rendered 
much lefs valuable both to the proprietor and tenant. No- 
thing but draining can remove this inconvenience, and faci- 
litate improvement; and as the proprietors are chiefly inte- 
refted in this, their exertions, it is hoped, will every day be 
more and more employed to promote lo important an end. 

Cattle. — Formerly almoft every farmer kept a few fheep ; 
but now, excepting on three farms, this prafticc is entirely 
given over. Too little attention, in general, is given to the 
breed of milk cows. It is alfo a pra6lice too much follow- 
ed, to overftock the ground in confequence of which, the 
growth of the cows is injured, and the produce of the dairy 
diminiflaed. The breed of horfes is greatly improved. Their 
price, in the Glafgow market, is from 15 1. to 30 1. Sterling. 

Farm Houfes, — It muft afford great pleafure to the traveller 
to obferve the neat farm houfes, which are interfperfed 
through this country. In this parifh they are every year in- 
ereafing in number, a circumftance which does no fmall cre- 
dit to the proprietors. Sir Archibald Edmonston of 
Duntreath, Bart, member of Parliament for Dunbarton.fliire, 
in this, and, indeed, in every other parifh where his exten. 
five property liesj has furniflied an example, which, it is hop- 
ed, will foon be generally followed. His tenants are all well 
lodged, and, comparatively fpeaking, elegantly. Inftead of 
the old low-built and confined houfes, which their fathers in- 
habited, Sir Archibald has given them houfes and offices 
fuited to their refpective farms, upon a plan, which conveys 
an idea of neutnefs and improvement that is highly pleafmg. 



Woods 



of Cardrofs* m 



jfToods and Fuel.-The natural wood is confiderable ; it 
will bring, at a cutting, betwixt 2000 1. and 3000 1. Sterling. 
Befides this, there are nearly 200 acres planted with Scotch 
firs larixes,&amp;c. Thefe plantations are all fucceeding well, and 
teing laid out with judgment and tafte, give an appearance 
of improvement to the country, whkh cannot fail to pleafe. 
Coal is the principal fuel. 12 cwt. of which, brought by wa- 
ter, cofts in the Cardrofs Bay, where it is unloaded, 5 s. Ster- 
ling. Many of the farmers bring their coals from Kilpatnck, 
and pay at the pit 2 s. per cart. Attempts have been made 
to find coal in this parifh, but as yet they have proved un- 
fucccfsful. 

Retits, Proprietors, ^f.— The valued rent is 3 cool. Scotch. 
It is difficult to fay what the real rent amounts to, as many 
of the proprietors retain confiderable farms in their own 
hands. The value of land, however, muft be on the rife. 
The gteat influx of ftrangers, in confcquence of the manu- 
faaures upon the Lcven, occafions an increafing demand for 
whatever the parifli produces. Thus the farmers find a rea- 
dy and convenient market at home, a circumftance which 
cannot fail to accelerate the improvement of the country, and 
increafe the real rent of the proprietors. In the neighbour- 
hood of the Leven, many inclofures are let upon ieafes, for 
between 2I. and 4I. Sterling per acre. There are 13 heri- 
tors, 3 of whom poffefs more than two thirds of the whole. 

Roads The two great roads through the parifh, the One 

leading to Loch- Lomond, the other running along the Clyde^ 
are kept m the beft poffible repair. To thefe the ftatute 
labour, now comniuted, is annually applied. Great praife, 
however, cannot be beftowed on the crofs or parifli roads. 
But as the cominiffioners muft be fenfible of the necefllty of

Print-fields, — The print-fields of Dalquhurn f and Cordate 
are by far the moft confiderable and extenfive of any in Scot- 
land.

land. Meflrs Stirlings, who purchafcd this field from the 
original proprietors, are well known. At firft they had a 
£eld at Daiholm^ in the neighbourhood of Glafgow, where 
they carried on the bufmefs of printing to a confiderable ex- 
tent. Upwards of 20 years ago, they removed from that fi- 
tuation to the river Leven in this parifh. To this they 
might have been led by a variety of circumftances, but by 
nothing more than by the foftnds and tranfparency of the 
water of the Leven, fo peculiarly fitted for the purpofe of 
bleaching. A neck of land, in the form of a peninfula, oc- 
cafioned, it would appear, by the river forfaking its former 
channel, was the place marked out as the moft proper to an- 
fwer the end which they propof'ed.^ Accordingly, in 1772, 
a purchafe was made of this fpot, called Cordale^ and upon 
it houfes have been built, and machinery conftrufted, to an 
extent, and upon a plan, which muft have coft the company 
an amazing fum At thefe fields, the property of this com- 
pany, there were employed, in fummer 1792, 876 perfons. 
Of thefe 300 were girls {pincellers)^ and about 130 were 
boys, from 8 to 15 years of age. It may be proper to ob- 
ferve, that the boys are in general healthy, aaive, and lively, 
having nothing of that pale and fickly look, which too often 
marks thofe boys who are employed in the cotton fpinning. 
The wages for one month, July 1792, amounted to within a 
trifle of loool. Sterling. It would be to no purpofe to en- 
ter here into a minute detail ; the Statiftical Account of the 

parilh 

kerchiefs, it is true, were then printed ; but nothing fine or va-. 
luable in the printing line was carried on, till about 20 years 
ago, when it was purchafed by a company in Glafgow, under 
the firm of M'Alpine, Fleeming, and Co. Buildings were raif. 
cd, and machinery conftrufled, by this company, at great cx- 
pence; an extenfive capital was employed, and every appearancQ 
promifed fuccefs. This flattering profpeiEt, however, was foon 
clouded. Difputes arifing among the partners produced ^ fiilc 
the property, and a diffolution of the company. 



* ^ ^ Staiiftical Account 

parifli of Eonhlll, already publilhed, contains all the necef- 
fary information : To it the reader is referred *. Suffice it to 
obferve, that every divifion of labour takes place at thefe two 
fields, which is known to facilitate the work, and to carry 
the art to a high degree of perfedion. The goods manu- 
faaured are faid to rival, in the London market, to which 
moft of them are fent, even thofe of the fineft quality that 
are the manufadure of the firft print-fields in England. 

Villages,— In the yt^T 1782, the hands employed at the 
above fields had become fo numerous, that it was extremely 
difficult to accommodate them, in houfes and lodging in the 
neighbourhood. Mrs Smollett of Bonhill, whofe lands 
lay moft contiguous, readily embraced this opportunity of 
improving her family efiate, and of accommodating the pub- 
lic. Accordingly, a village was planned by the advice, and 
under the direftion of her fon, now her fucceffor. No fooner 
was this plan adjufted, and the terms of building fixed upon, 
which are from 9 d. to i4d. the fall, upon transferable leafes 
of 99 years, than a great number of fteadings were purcha- 
fed, and houfes immediately built. The firft ftone was laid 
in 1782, and the village was called Rentoun by the feuers, in 
compliment to the prefent Mrs Smollet, who had been aftive 
in encouraging an undertaking of fuch importance, both ta 
her family and to the public. Since the above period, the 
Tillage has rapidly increafed. It confifts of three principal 
flreets, which run in a dire^ion from north to fouth, paral- 
lel to one another. Thefe again are interfered by a number 
of other ftreets, all laid ofF at regular diftances. The de- 
mand for houfes, every where upon the Leven, has, within 
thefe few years paft, been very great. In confequence of 
this, befides the village of Rentoun, a number of houfes have

from Mr Dennifton of Colgrain ; and a village is juft row 
begun upon the property of Mr Graham of GTtmore, 
which, it IS probable, when the prefent ftagnation of bulincfs 
is over, will fall: increafe in population. 

Dijiillery, Miils, Ferries, effr.— There is one diftillerf, 
which confumes of the produce of the parilh about 500 bolls 
of bear and barley. 1 he number of public houi€s, or rather 
whifky (hops, has of late been greatly diminilhcd. The 
Jultices have for this year given licence to only two in the 
vill.ige of Reiitoun, to lell Ipirits of home produce, i'here 
are three corn mills, at two of which the multure on the af- 
tri£ted lands, is nearly in the proportion of one peck and an 
half the boll, confifting of 8 ftoncs. This proves a great difi 
couragcment to iniprovcnjtnt. ifaere are 4 uifferent ferries, 
two of thcle are of great antiquity, as appears from the char- 
ters of the proprietors. The prices of labour, viiluals, gcc. 
are nearly the lame as in Glalgow and its neighbourhood.

ipnng and fummer months. Along the Cardrofs fhore there 
are many fuch inclofures, but thofe moft happily fituated are 
the properties of Mr Denniftoun of Colgrain, and Mr Noble 
of Noble-Farm. The rights to thefe yare fiQiings prove them 
to be of very high antiquity, being granted by crown char- 
ters above 500 years ago, and confirmed by all fubfequent 
charters. By thefe, the prr.prietors of the Ibil have the right 
of exercifing yare fifliings uppn the {hore to low water-mark. 
;ome of thele rights extend as far as a man can ride beyond 
low water, and from that throw a twelve-feet fpear. This 
extent of fhore, during the htrring feafon, is attentively 
guarded, that the tilh which may entrap' tjiemlelvcs in 
thefe yares,may neither be alarmed by, nor taken in the nets 
of the boat-fiaiers — It is remarked, from the earliell ac- 
counts of this kind of filhnig, th.it the herrings vifit the 
river Clyde, at nearly 3 equal periods m 100 years, each pe- 
riod confifting of feverai years hfhirig. The mode ot fecu- 
ring what filh may be in the yares, is with a hond-net.- By 
ancient cmlom, two thirds belong to the yare proprietor, and 
one third to the fiflier, if a tenant up.m the adjoining lands. 
But when ftrangers are permitted to fiih, they have only one 
fourth part of their fuccels allov/ed them. 

Churchy i2c. — The church of Cardrofs originally flood in 
the eaftern extremity of the parii'h, oppofite to Dumbarton, 
and feparated from it by the river Leven. This lituation 
muft have been very inconvenient to the parifh, and there- 
fore, in 1643, ^ ""^^ church was built in the place where it 
now (lands, the moft centrical, indeed, that could have been 
chofen, and the moll convenient to the pariih at large. The 
church is a neat building, well lighted and well (eated. It 
underwent a complete repair in 1775} and, by the care and

eft franknefs, Mid out 200 1. Sterling in repairing of the manle 
and offices; The crown is patron, and the nunifter titular. 
Cardrofs Is one of the few parilhes in Scotland, where the 
right cf titular is vefted in the incumbent. Frqm a late m- 
veftigation, in afcertaining the right of patronage, it appears, 
that it was neither a menial church, nor ever annexed to any 
religious houfe, and therefore, as the Crown is patron^ it 
-continues at this day precilely in the fame ttate as before the 
Reformation •, with this difference only, that there has been 
a dilapidation of 1 1 bolls of meal. Belide the parilh church, 
there are other two houfes for public worfliip \ the one of 
'the Burgher perfuafion in the village of Rentoun ; the other 
of the Relief, lately built in the neighbourhood of Dumbar- 
ton. Thefe diffenters confift chiefly of people connedied 
with the printfields. The farmers, in general, are attached 
to the eftablifhment, 

School. — The fchoolmafter draws no falary from the heri- 
tors. ' The emoluments of his office arife from his fchool, 
which, at an average, may be frequented by 40 or 50 fcho- 
lars, and from a donation of the family of Kilmahew. This

tereft of 100 1. Stprling funk for the behoof of the fchool- 
mafter, and placed under the management of the heritors. 
Befides this fum, which was be(|Ueathed for the above pur- 
pofe by a younger branch of the family, the proprietor him- 
felf executed a deed, difponing to the public teaclier a right 
to an acre of land, a cow's pafturc upon a fpecified farm, and 
5 bolls I firlot of bear, payable from certain other farms up-

clerk may be equal, communibus annis, j 1. Sterling. 

Poor—The poor are fupplied from two fources—from the 
weekly colIe«ion» which, with the proclamation money, may 
amount annually to upwards of 30 1. Sterling ; and from a 
legacy bequeathed a few years after the Revolution, by a Mrs 
Muir, a native of this parifh, and originally of the name of 
Watfon. This legacy confifted of 500 1. Sterling, to be ap- 
plied under the dircftion of the ufual managers of the poot, 
for the behoof of the indigent living within a certain diftrift 
of the parifh, fpecially named in the deed of mortification. 
The above fum was, early in this century, laid out in the pur- 
chafe of land, which, bv the lafl let, produces a revenue upwards 
of 70 1. Sterling per annum. There are no begging poor, and 
the heritors have never as yet been fubjVfled to any afleflT- 
ment. The number upon the feflion roll varies, bur, in ge- 
neral, there are a dozen and upwards, who receive quarterly 
a fmall contribution. The number entitled to the benefit of 
JVIrs Muir's mortification alfo varies according to circum- 
fiances,- 

Eminent Men. — Contiguous to the village of Rentoun, in 
the old houfe of Dakjuhurn, was born the celebrated Dr 
Tobias Smollett. He was the grandfon of Sir James 
Smollett of Bonhill, Bart, a gentleman of confiderable pro- 
perty in this county, a member of the laft Scotch Parlia- 
ment, and a commiflioner in framing the Unioil. The fa- 
ther of Tobias being a younger Ton, received, according to 
the cuflom of his country, only a fmall (hare of Sir James's 
fortune, and, dying at an early period of I fe, left his family, 
confiding of two fons and a daughter, in circuniflances not

the moft affluent. The two brothers received the rudiments 
of their education in the Ichool of Dumbarton. The dd^r. 
^hofe nan.c was James, was bred a loldier, and amongft h.s 
acqua.nt.nce was diftinguifhed for his addrds, and thoie ta- 
lents of wit and humour, which pfterw.rd. char^^enfed 
Tob.as. A premature death, (he having perilhed at fea off 
the coaft of America), robbed the world of thofe talents, 
which, if ripened by time and liudy, might have (hone forth 
with diftinguifhed luf\re. Tobias, the younger, was educated 
in the medical line, lerved an apprcnticeQiip to a furgeon in " 
Giafgow, and loon after aaed as mate aboard a man of war. 
In this capacity he was prdcnt at the iiege of Carthagena, 
the particulars of which he defcribes in Koderick Random 
with lo much life. Tobias could not long contuiue in this 
lituation. His afpring genius difdaincd the drudgery to 
which his profefTional line expofed him. He was a man of 
the mofl polifhed manners, and finefl addrefs, talents which 
feldoro fail to recommend tiie phyfician. But with thele he 
poflefled a pride which counteraited their liifluencc. He 
could not f\oop to that infinuatit.g flattery f.. prevalent ia 
the world, of which even the wile and knowing have often 
become the dupes. His mind was chir-fly turned to the ftudy 
of lite and manners, in delineating which he is perhaps fur- 
pafled by few. In this particubr, as a painter of life and 
charaaer, he has rcficaed the bigheft honour upon the place 
of his nativity, and mult ever be confidered by his country 
among the tult of her Icn;* in literary reputation. As a hif- 
torian, he may be inferior to Hume and Robertlon m refine- 
ment of thought, and political obfcrvation •, but when the 
fubjeft leads to delcripticn, or to the delineation of character, 
his powers appear unrivalled. To the greateft genius, he 
joined the mofV unremitting application. One proof of this 
cannot fail to be noticed, which is,tlaat in kis than 14 months

Origin of the Name. 
T^ROM whence the name of this parifli has been derivedj 
X cannot be determined with any degree of certainty. 
There is, howrvcr, no improbabihty in fuppofing it to come 
from the word a;; or which, in the Norfe or Norwegian 
language, is faid to fignify an ifland, and the nauie of that 
animal to which we are indebttd for fo confiderable a part of 
our food and clothing The animal here ahuded to is the 
flieep, for the breeding and pafturing of wh ch the ifland 
has been reckoned rather remarkable, and ther^fo^e it has 
been, with lome propriety, tiled Shapmjhay, or the Sheep- 
Ifl.ind. Eut with more probability liill, it n ay ptrh.ips be 
derived from the Saxon language. If we may credit the 
poet CLudian, the Sixons early inhabited this country, and 
had even the misfortune to bedew it with their blood. «' Ma»

middle of the ifland in queftion j and from the combination 
of the naii.e fhcep with this word, the whole i)arifli may 
have got the name of the Sheep Valley, or Shapinfliay. But

Situation, Extent, Form, Bivifion, l^c.—To the north of the 
taftpartof the main-land, from which it is diltant about 
one mile, and three fr6m Kirkwall, this illand extends al- 
moft in the form of a crols, from Stromberry to Nels, near 
7 miles, and from the Gait to the foot of Shapinfhay, nrtore 
than 5. The body of the crofs flretches from fouth-weft 
to north-eaft, and the arms from fouth-eaft to north-weft. 
Almoft around the whole illand, the fliores are low, pretty 
level, and, to a confiderable diftance inland, covered with 
rich fields of grafs and corn. Tow?,rds ihe middle, the land 
rifes confiderably higher and as the hand of induftry has 
never difturbed its repo^e fince the creation, it exhibits the 
appearance of a barren wafte, fit only for fheep pafture. 

Ancient Cujlom. — As all the lands on the fhore are pro- 
perly, fo the whole of the hill ground is commonty, and 
they are divided from each other by what is here called a 
hill- dyke, a fpecies of fence, it is believed, almoft peculiar to 
this country. The period when this kind of fence was 
firft in ufe in thefe iflands is loft in the mift of ai.tiquity. 
They are common through moft of the iflands. They are 
built of turf. They crumble down in winter, are repaired

^'gam m tlie fpring when the corn begins to rife, and cverv 
proprietor, or his tenants, are conipelled not only by the 
ufage of the place, but by bye-laws enacted for the purpofc, 
to repair and keep up a part of the hilUdyke, proportioned 
to the extent of their farms, or his property. Thefe feeble 
fences, if they deferve the name of fences, are intended to fu- 
perfede the neceffity of herding domeftic animals. Early 
in the fummer, when the corn begins to fpring, the young 
cattle, and particularly all the flieep, are inclofed within 
them, rather to wander about than to feed, till the end of au- 
tumn. So long as the nights are (hort, the weather mild, and 
the paftufe tolerable, they continue within thefe limits with- 
out much reludlance; but when the feafon advances, hunger 
and cold impel them to leap the dykes in purfuit of better 
nouriflhmen!, and more fheher. Inftcad of their bein? di- 
reded by the tender and attentive care of a flaepherd, they 
are then attacked with flicks and ftones, and hunted by dogs, 
-^vith more fury than is commonly ufed to ravenous beafls in 
other countries. Hence thefe animals, which under proper 
management might be a fource of wealth to the proprietors, 
and a benefit to the country at large, arc decreafing in num- 
l)er, and degenerating in quality fo faft, that in a fhort time, 
if the mode of treatment is not altered, they will not be worth 
the raifing. To protedl thefe harinlefs, and very ufeful crea- 
tures from their, various enemies, to watch over the young 
and the old, and the difeafed and, upon occauon, to lead 
them to proper fhelter and pafture, fo as to render their fleece 
and their carcafe important objedls of rural oeconomy, herd- 
ing them is abfolutely necefTary. So blindly attached, how- 
ever, are the ordinary clafs of people here to antient cuftoms, 
and fuch rooted averfion have they to difcover what ftore 
they have to their landlords and to their minifters, that no 
force of example, no influence of authority, no arguments

drawn (rtm either humanity or from intereft, can prevail with 
them to adopt a meafure which in every refpeft appears 
To reafonable. A procefs is faid to be at prefent depending, 
which will in the iffue certainly determine how far cultom, ia 
regard to hill dykes, is to be confidered as the law of the 
country. But in whatever way the law may determine this 
point, we, from a fincere regard to the intereits oi the coun- 
try, cannot help wifliing that the cuftom of the diftridl, ia 
regard to this matter, would yield to the ftatute for herding 
of cattle. 

Formerly there are faid to have been near 3000 fheep ia 
the ifland, and now, owing to a variety of caufes, they do 
not exceed the half of that number. The black cattle a- 
mount to about 800, and the horfes only to 250, owing to 
an infcdtious diforder having fome years ago entered the pa- 
rifli, and in a few months carried off great numbers of them. 
As there are few evils but what produce fome good, this 
diforder, which the people at the time had good reafon to 
confider as a misfortune, may, it is hkely, in the end, turn 
cut to their advantage, in fo far as it has compelled them, ia 
fpite of their averfion to novelties, to employ oxen inftead of 
horfes. To the regret of all good farmers, fwine are raifed ■ 
here in vaft numbers; and what adds much to the evil, they are 
under the very worft of management. In the fummer feafoa 
they are driven to the hill with the flieep and young cattle, 
where they commit depredations without moleaation ; and 
at the end of harveft, when the fruits of the earth are re- 
moved, they come down in legions, fierce and hungry, and 
are allowed to roam at large around the fliores, to the'almofl: 
utter deftruaion of fome of the beft land of the ifland.

receives from thcfe deflruaive animals, and the clumfy awk- 
"ward way in which it is cultivated, it wduld produce no fort 
of crop whatever. Oats and bear alternately, however, it 
produces, as alfo pretty good potatoes, and formerly flax of a 
tolerable quality, was raifed on it. To prepare the land for 
thefe crops, which are of the utmofi: confequence to the in- 
habitants, as they make the principal part of their food, far 
too little attention is paid. Unacquainted with the mode of 
farming in a more favoured climate, the farmers are at no 
pains to make the diredion of the ridges anfwer to the nature 
of the foil and the fituation of the land ; they never ftraight 
nor raife them, nor water-furrow their ground, nor do they 
ever think of plowing it till within two or three weeks of feed 
time. The whole winter's induftry is thus in a great mea- 
fure loft j the land lofes the benefit which it might receive 
from the froft and fnow ; and, as the labour is not properly 
divided, but comes almoft all on at one feafon, this cir- 
cumftance obliges them to purchafe more cattle, and main- 
tain more fervants than otherwife would be necelTary. The 
plough which is in general ufed, is but ill calculated to obviate 
the difadvantages that arife from unfeafonable labouring. It 
has only one llender ftilt, to which as flender a beam is jSxed, 
and has neither reeft nor mould- board; the ploughman holds 
it by this ftilt, and direfts it by a ftiort batton held loofe 
in his hand for that purpofe. Defeaive as this inftrument 
muft appear, it has been honoured by a comparifon with the 
plough defcribed by Virgil and Columella, as ufed by the 
Romans, to which it no doubt bears fome refemblance, and 
the parallel has been drawn between them with all the pa- 
rade of pompous ignorance. But if the form of the plough 
be exceptionable, the mode of yoking the cattle is not lefs 
fo. Inftead of placing them in a hne, or two and two toge- 
ther, as is comcr.'on in the fouth of Scotland, four of them,

To every intelligent farmer, it is an objed of much impor- 
tance to clear his land of thofe weeds with which it is mofl: 
infefted, and the methods he makes ufe of for this purpofe, 
are either to apply proper manure, to raife potatoes, turmp,

of plants that tend to obftrua the growth of corn, our ordi-

ver them with fome fea-weed, fow them immediately, and as 
foon as the feed is committed to mother earth, they carelefsly 
fold their arms, fatisfied they have done their duty, and leave 
the event to divine providence. Neither are they more en-

cation of manures. Some of them have excellent marl almoft

now and then with fuch alterations and unprovements as 
are fuggefted by reading, by experience, and oblervation ; 
while others, unfliackled by prejudice, have adopted a 
mode which is in every refpedt rational as well as ufeful, 
which in time mull have influence in the way of example, 
and which, conildering the circumftances of the coun- 
tn; and climate, would do them no difcredit among the 
moft intelligent farmers. In this laft clafs may juftly be ran- 
ked the only refiding heritor of this pariHi, who, in the 
fpace of 7 or 8 years that he has pofTelTed the eftate. has to- 
tally changed the face of that part of the ifland. Previous 
to his purchafe, nothing was to be feen over its whole ex- 
tent, but a dreary wafte, interfperfed with arable lands ill 
cultivated, a few miferable hovels thinly fcattered over its 
furface, under the name of farm houfes or cottages, which 
were not fit to flielter from the rigours of the climate a few 
ragged inhabitants, dirty through indolence, lean with hunger, 
and torpid by defpair. Every thing on this eftate now happily 
wears a very different and more pleafant afpedt. An elegant 
houfe has been built, and an extenfive garden laid out; the 
lands are fubftantially inclofed, and judicioufly cultivated with 
the Englifli plough ; many barren fields are, by cultivation, 
made fertile ; fummer fallowing, with a change of feed and 
rotation of crops, is introduced with good effedl ; and the 
loil, which formerly bore with relui^ancc coarfe grafs, and 
fcanty heather, and puny oats and bear, now chearfully pro- 
duces oats, rye, barley, peafe, wheat, potatoes, clover, and 
turnips, in confiderable quantity and of a good quality. To- 
gether with thefe improvements, the fame gentleman has 
erefted a little village by the fide of the harbour of Elwick, 
in which he has placed joiners, carpenters, weavers, tailors, 
flioemakers, coopers, and labourers of various forts, furni- 
ihcd them with work fufficient to employ th?m ; and thus

enabled them from the fruits of their induftry to marry early, 
and to produce numerous families. In flaort, Cliffuale, 
tvhich is the name of this gentleman's ieat, taken m con- 
junaion with its appendages, exhibits to the eye of a Granger 
coming from the fea, or from Kirkwall, rather the appear- 
ance of a neat little villa in the vicinity of fojne opulent city, 
than of a gentleman's houfe recently raifed in a remote fe- 
queftered part of the kingdom. That the former proprietor 
did not make fome, or all of thefe improvements upon the 
eflrate, while it was in his hands, was neither owing to his 
want of lenfe nor of virtue, for he had a large (hare , of 
Ijoth; but to his being obliged to live at fome diftance, in 
order to difcharge the duties of a troublefome office, which 
required all his attention, and of his wanting the means 
of exciting and rewarding induftry, by the expences he in- 
curred in maintaining a numerous family. The heritors 
of this parifli are, the Crown for the bifliops lands, of 
which Sir Thomas Dundas is tackfman ; Robert Laing, Efq; 
of Strenzie, and Major Balfour of Elwick, who together 
poflefs the whole ifland. This parifh formerly made part of 
the temporality of the bifhopric of Orkney. The eftates of 
Sound, and How, and Hammer, the former the property of 
Major Balfour, and the latter of Mr Laing, are feus froni 
the bifhops of Orkney. How is the feat of Mr Laing, where 
he has an old houfe pleafantly fituated amidft rich corn fields 
and fine grafs ; and which, were he to refide there, and 
turn' his attention towards improvement, might foon be made 
one of the mofl: fertile and pleafant fpots in Shapinfhay. 
In the neighbourhood of this place he has had lime kilns 
for many years pafl, by which he has put in motion a 
confiderable quantity of induflry. The lime is prepared 
from flones which contain about one half of calcareous mat- 
ter, and are blown by gun-powder from rocks under the 
high water mark, and the produce, amounting fome feafons 



to

to 3000 barrels, finds a ready market and a good price 
through the ifland, particularly in Kirkwall. 

As no meafurement of this parifli has ever been taken, 
the proportion which the uncultivated lands bear to thofe 
that are cultivated, cannot be afccrtained with any degree of 
exaanefs ; but the latter, it is certain, have been divided in- 
to penny lands, and the rental of the ifland is faid not to ex-

the profits of the glebe, may amount to about 90 1. Sterling ; 
and befidcs the prefent incumbent, who was fettled 12th

foundation of the chapter, made by Biftiop Reed, no men* 
tion whatever is made of the minifter of this parifti, as a- 
mong the feven dignitaries, or feven canons and prebends 
that compofed this chapter. The minifter of South Ro- 
raldfliay was provoft or dean •, the minifter of Birfay arch-,

Antiquities. — The genius of fuperftition has been as aaive 
here in antient times, as in moft other places ; for we find 
it has been employed in raifing feveral little chapels in va- 
rious parts of the parifti. What good purpofe they could 
fcrve, it is not very eafy to imagine, efpecially when built, as 
they fomctimes were, on holms or uninhabited iflands. In

Elharclholm, which is a place of that kind, and connected 
with, and belonging to this parifla, there is dnc of thefe cha- 
pels, that iu every refpea refembles the other infignificant 
huildings of the fame nature fo much, as not to deferve a 
particular defcription. On the higheft ground, and near the 
center of the parifh, there is, as in mofl of the other iflands, 
a wart or ward-hill, which commands an accurate and exten- 
five view, not only of this, but of 15 furrounding parilhes. 
To me this appears plainly to be artificial, and though one 
of the. largeft kind, is certainly one of thofc tumuU which 
arc fo frequently to be met with in thefe iflands. Thefe tu- 
muli, or little mounds of earth, fcem to have been raifed to 
cover the dead bodies, and perpetuate the memories of dif- 
tinguiflied perfons •, for in almoft every one of them that has 
been opened, there have been found bones, and fomctimes 
burnt earth, and not unfrequently urns containing half burnt 
bones and afhes. In fupport of this opinion we may have 
recourfe to Tacitus and Verfligan, who inform us that both 
the ancient Romans, and Germans, and Saxons, obferved 
the cuftom of laying their dead bodies on the ground, and 
raifing over them heaps of earth, covered with turf, in the 
form of little hillocks. To the eaftward of this little wart 
or ward-hillock about an Englifli mile, is a high ftone, called 
the Stafidittg Stone of ShapifiJJjay. Above the level of the 
ground it is 12 feet high, and perhaps 5 or 6 below it ; its 
breadth is between 4 and 5 feet ; its thicknefs a foot and a 
half ; and from its being clothed in mofs or fcruf, it has a ve- 
ry venerable majeftic afpeft, and feems to have weathered 
many ages. In both its form and dimenfions, it very much 
1 efembles ftones that are found ftanding in many of the other 
iflands, particularly, the circle and femicirde in the parifli of 
Stcnnes ; and it has perhaps been erefled either as a place 
of vvorfhip, or facrifice, or to be a monument of fome fignal 

battle 



battle or viflory, or to preferve the memory of fome cele- 
brated hero who had fallen in the field of battle. Towards 
the north fide of the ifland, and by the fea fide, is another 
large ftone, called the Black Stone of Odin, Inftead of 
ftanding ereft, like the one above mentioned, it refts its huge 
fide on the fand, and raifes its back high above the funoun- 
ding ftones, from which it feems to be altogether different 
in quality. How it has come there, for what purpoie, and 
what relation it has borne to the Scandinavian god with 
whofe name it has been honoured, not only hiftory or re- 
cord, but even tradition Is totally filent. As the bay in a 
neighbouring ifland is diftinguifiied by the name of Guuden, 
or the Bay or Guo of Odin, in which there is found dulce 
that is fuppoled 'to prevent difeafe and prolong life; fo 
this ftone might have had fandity formerly which is now- 
forgotten, when the only office that is afligned it is to 
ferve as a march-ftone between the ware ftrands or kelp 
fhores of two conterminous heritors. On the weft fliore, 
oppofite nearly to the rock or Ikerry of Vafa, where the tides 
are rapid and the fea is fhallow, wc meet with a place knovsrn 
by the name of Grucula or Agruola. Thither, tradition re- 
ports, one of Agricola's fhips, in his celebrated voyage a- 
round the ifland of Britain, was driven by violence of wea- 
ther, and ftrandcd i and what feems to evince that the tra- 
dition is founded on truth is, that Roman coins are faid to have 
been found here, by the late Mr Fea of Cleftron. Though 
Agricola's fon-in-law, Tacitus, not only mentions his having 
been in thefe iflands, but alfo his having conquered them, 
and difcovered Thule, till then involved in darknels, and co- 
vered with fnow, no fuch difafter is defcribed by his ftrong 
and elegant pencil. From his filence, however, we cannot 
juftly infer the event never happened, efpecially .as he men- 
tions the Orkneys in fuch a rapid and fuperficial manner.

the moft remarkable pieces of antiquity in this, and indeed 
in the other iflands, are thofe large ruins commonly deno- 
minated Pia.houfes. Here they are frequently met with a- 
long the fea fliore, two or three of them at no great diftancc 
from, and in general raifing their conical heads in view of 
each other. They are Ctuated, for the moft part, on the 
raoft pleafant fpots j they are covered with green, and o^iia- 
mented with flowers and herbs of various forts } and fuch of 
them as have been examined by the eye of curiofity, have 
difcovcred confiderable variety in both their form and di- 
menfions. Moft of them are circular j fome of them verging 
towards an oval fhape \ fome of them are very large, others 
of a fmaller fize ; in general they are built without cement, 
in fome few inftances with it ; and, from the remains of the 
moft entire of them, it would appear that they are wide at 
the foundation, and are contradled as they advance upwards, 
fomewhat in the form of a kiln, and that they were clofed 
or covered at the top is probable. The infide of fuch of 
them as we have feen, however, is divided into a great num- 
ber of apartments, many of which feem to be of a very 
whimfical and inconvenient form, and all of them are fa 
fmall as to be unfit for any permanent accommodation for 
man. To what purpofe, therefore, has fuch a quantity of 
labour been wafted, in eredling fuch large and mally piles, and 
that at a period when induftry was certainly not ranked among 
the number of the virtues ? As there was a time, perhaps, 
when each of thefe iflands, efpecially of the larger kind, was 
a ftate within itfelf, governed by its own prince or its owa 
chieftain, thefe buildjngs might have been created as forts to 

defend

Height have taken their ftations, and annoyed the boats at- 
tempting to land with their arrows, or fink them with darts* 
ftones, or other miffile weapons j and to fhew that this opi- 
nion is not entirely founded in fancy, thefe ruins are moll 
frequently to be met with near bays, beaches, or other land- 
ing places. From their internal flrufture, confiding of a va. 
riety of little cells, there is no abfurdity in fuppofing they 
have been intended as places of fecurity for treafures, for the 
moft valuable furniture, and for provifions. Thither they 
might" bring thefe articles, and whatever elfe they put the 
greateft value on, depofit them with care, and, collefting 
their force around, defend them to the utmofl: extremity. 
In thofe that have been dug up, there have always been found, 
half burnt ftones and earth, together with a confidcrablq 
quantity of alhes, and many human bones, and the bones of 
various other animals. From this circumftance, we may be 
allowed to conjefture that they have in the early ages, long 
before the pra^ice of burying in church-yards, ferved as fe- 
pulchral monuments for princes, chieftains, heroes, and other 
diftinguilhed perfons. But whatever was the view, with 
which they were at firft erefted, and to whatever purpofc? 
they were afterwards applied, they are very numerous through 
the iflands in this country, and are fometimes to be met with 
on the coaft of Caithnefs. Of the fame nature with them, 
perhaps, were the buildings named Danes Raths in Ireland, 
'Ware, in his antiquities of that kingdom, informs us, that; 
Turgofius the Norwegian, in the year 835,raifed thefe round 
works or fortifications, which are yet to be fecn in many 
parts of Ireland. The Cartilla Brigantum, mentioned by ; 
Juvenal in his fourteenth Satyr, were probably of the fame 
kind. Near Cliffdale, fome fhort time ago, when the work- 
gicn were digging for the fouijidation of a howfe; they difcoX

vered a fubterraneous building of a Angular nature. It had 
been formed by digging the earth about 3 feet deep, and 
ereaing piliars of ftones buUt one upon another to the height 
.of 4 feet, to fupport a flat roof of broad ftones or flags that 
-covered the whole building, which was compofed of two 
hexagons contiguous to one another, and their diameter about 
8 feet, and of a redangle as large as both. As the whole fa- 
,bric was confiderably below ground, and no veftlge whatever 
to be feen.on the furfacc, it perhaps has been ufed as a place 
• for concealing various articles of value, for which it feemed 
..well calculated. However that may be, there was found in 
Jtagold ring of an uncommon conftrudlion. The outfide 
of that ring was broad and large, compofed as it were of 
.- three cords twifted or plaited together i the infide was much 
narrower, and pretty well fitted for the ufe of the finger. 
;No infcription whatever appeared on any part of it ; and at 
othe joining, inftead of being foldered, it feemed to have been 
beaten together with a hammer. Near this place there were 
lead mines attempted to be wrought formerly ; and the firfl: 
fpecimens of the ore were fo promifing, that a company 
in the fouth granted their obligation to the proprietor for 
500 1. a-year, in order to obtain his pcrmiflion to work them. 
The fum ftipulated procured his confent ; they began with 
fpirit, and advanced a confiderable length, when either their 
affairs went into diforder, or they found that the veins went 
too deep, or in the diredlion of the fea, or that the ore did 
not prove fo rich as it promifed, which conftrained them to 
relinquifli the undertaking. 

Harhour. —^Tht harbour of Elwick, which is the only one 
that belongs to this ifland, is as excellent for its extent as al- 
moft any one in this country. In this harbour, as well as 
around all the coaft, it is high water at three quarters of an 

hour 



of ShapinJJjay, 25^ 

hour after 9 o'clock, when the moon Is new and full. It has 
from 4 to 6 fathom water, over a bottom of hard clay co- 
vered with fand. On the weft fide of it is a fine beach, with 
abundance of excellent frcQi water ; and as it opens to the 
fouth-weft, it is extremely convenient for fhips bound to the 
fouthward. In antient times it feems to haVe been called E- 
lidarwick ; for we are informed by an Icelandic manufcript, 
lately tranflated, that Haco king of Norway, 1263, lay with 
his fleet in*a harbour of that name, near Kirkwall, in his 
way to the Hebrides or weft of Scotland. He had planned 
an expedition againft Alexander III. king of Scotland, and 
after he had lain in this harbour till St. OWs Wake, he 
failed fouth before the Mull of Ronaldftia, with all his navy. 

Inditjiry and Manufaaures.— The boats belonging to this 
place are about 80, moft of which are engaged in filhing, 
and in carrying the rents and feu-duties, which are paid in 
kind, to Kirkwall, except about 20, that are the property of 
Major Balfour, who frequently employs them otherwife. 
The fame gentleman has 8 veflels, 4 brigs and 4 floops, that 
are almoft conftantly employed in the trade of this country, 
and require 50 failors to work them, Befides cultivating 
their little farms, and preparing the produce of them for 
their landlords and for the market, the men are employed in 
fiftiing what are called Jil/ods for their daily fupport, and the 
w6men in fpinning tow and linen yarn for fale, and in work- 
ing up the wool of their ftieep, which is of an excellent qua- 
lity, for clothing to themfelves and their families. There are 
few tradefmen in the parifti, except thofe in the village lately 
crc£led on the banks of the harbour of Elwick. Their in- 
duftry is not only beneficial to themfelves, but to others in 
the way of example, and to the public at large^ by enabling 
them to rear numerous families. The fummer months are 

occupied 



^iatiflical Account 



occupied in burning kelp, which is the great manufaaure of 
this country. The men almoft of the whole iflands, and 
many of the women, alfo exert themfelves in this fpecies of 
Induftry ; and their joint efforts fome feafons produce up- 
wards of 3000 tons, which, at a moderate rate, brings near 
SOjOoo 1. to the inhabitants. As it occupies the induftry, and 
conftitutes the principal part of the riches of the place, every 
attention fhould be given it by thofe that are friends to their 
country. The proprietors of lands, and their tenants and 
cottars, the tradefmen in the towns of Kirkwall and Strom- 
tiefs, as well as in the country places, and merchants or 
fhopkeepers every where, derive from it much benefit. To 
them only who have ftated falaries it is detrimental; by in- 
creafing the quantity, and thereby diminifliing the value of 
money, and without adding to the ftock, raifing the price of 
provifions. Its being extremely ufeful, however, will fervo 
as an apology for our confidering its nature, the purpofes to 
which it is applied, the mode of manufaauring it, and the 
means by which that mode may be improved. 

Kelp — Kelp is compofed of the afhes of various fea plants, 
cut from the rocks, or coUedled on the beach, and burnt in 
kilns or pits made on the fliore for that purpofe. It confifts 
chiefly of the fixed vegetable alkali^ in a confiderably cauftic 
ftate, never altogether pure, but intermixed with other falts 
and particularly with Glauber's falts, and muriatcd and vitri- 
olated magnefiae. The fixed vegetable alkali is the only valu- 
able part of the kelp, and to it the other 3 kinds of fait are found 
to bear but a fmall proportion ; they do not hurt it materially 
in the manufaflures in which it is ufed, and if they did hurt 
it, a feparation from them could, with no great difficulty, 
be obtained. If it is pure, or nearly fo, it anfwers every 
purpofe of the pnrefl: pot-afhes, which is a lixivial fait, ob-

tained by the burning of wood, and which can be obtained 
only at a very high price, and from a foreign country. la 
that cafe it fupplies place in bleaching, in the manufaaure 
of foap, of allum, of glafs, and perhaps is neceflln-y in feme 
other of the moft important manufactures of Britain. The 
whole tribe of fea-weeds is capable, by burning, to produce 
kelp ; but what are made ufe of here for that purpofe are the 
four following forts : 1/, The tangle, {Fucus Digitatus^ Lin.), 
the top of which is here called red ware, whofe roots are 
fixed in the rocks, and are very feldom left dry even at the 
loweft fpring tides. 2^//y, The fea-oak, [Fucus Veficulofus, 
Lin.), which we denominate black tang, and which grows 
next to the former, nearly at the loweft ebb. T^dlyy The knot- 
ted fea- weed, (Fucus Nodof us, Lin.), or,, as it is fom^times 
called, the bell-wrack, and here the yellow tang, which in. 
general occupies the middle fpace between the low and high 
water marks. 4thiy, The jagged or ferrated fea- weed, {Fucus 
ScrratuSf Lin ), commonly known by the name "of prickly 
tang in this country. Thefe four kinds of fub-marine plants, 
with fome others of lefs confequence, are cut from the rocks 
it! the fummcr feafon with hooks, carried up on barrows ta 
the beach, where they are fpread to dry, and are afterwards 
burnt into afhes. The kilns that are made ufe of for this 
purpofe, are either erected with ftones on the fand, or dug 
in the beach, of a circular form, and about 12 inches deep 
and 4 feet broad. In thefe they make holes for the free cir- 
culation of the air while they are burning, and after they 
have continued to burn till they imagine they have about one 
third of a tun of kelp, they begin to ftir it ftrongly, or to 
rake it with a clumfy inftrument of iron formed for the pur- 
pofe. Much of the excellence of the kelp depends on the 
perfection of this operation. Great care muft be taken to 
keep it free of fand, of ftones, and of every fort of extra- 
VoL. XVIL H h neous

«eous matter. The contents of the kiln muft be made per. 
leaiy liquid, and foniewhat refembling the metal in a fur- 
nace ; and in this ftate it is fometimes very difficult to pre- 
erve it of the rcquifite purity. The liquid requires to be 
left in the pit to cool, which it generally does in about two 
days, when it congeals and hardens into a folid ponderous 
mafs, which is broken and piled up on the fhore, till an oc- 
cafion occurs to Ihip it for the market. In a manufa^ure 
of fo great importance as that of kelp, every attempt fliould 
be made to meliorate its quality. This, it is believed, may 
be done by cutting the fea- weeds fomewhat earlier in the 
feafon, and allowing them to lie as fhort time on the fhore 
to dry as pcffible, making the kilns fo much larger as to 
burn a greater quantity of kelp at a time ; and of fuch a 
conftruaion as to prevent the intermixture of other mate- 
rials, by raking it thoroughly into a liquid ftate, aud by 
conveying it from the kilns, as foon as it is cold, to a ftorc- 
. lioufe, to flicker it from the hurtful influence of the weather. 
To increafe its quantity is alio an objedt of importance, and 
to do it in fome meafure there is little difilculty. The plants 
on the rocks that afi^ord this article, arc feldom cut with fuf- 
ficient care ; they are burnt only every two or three years, 
V'hen they might be burnt annually j too little attention has 
been beflowed on the cutting of tangle and red ware and 
carrying it a-rfiore in nets and boats confl;ru6ied for the pur- 
pofe ; nor has almoft any perfon in this place attempted to 
extend the foil for thefe plants, by placing broad wcightv 
ftones, or even wrecked v/ood, on thq fliores, in convenient 
fltuations. Were thefe circumflances attended to, and the 
praflice hinted at followed, our kelp fliores, which yield at 
prcfent fo confiderable a treafure, inight nearly double the 
quantity. This parifli produces every year about 1 2o tons,

and, trifling as this quantity rr.ay appear, it has a confader- 
able influence on the condition of the people. 

PGpulaticn.— The number of our people, In 1755, was only 
642, and amounts now to 730, confequentiy there is an in- 
creafe of 88. The caufe of this increaled population, we 
are able to trace to the refidence of a fingle proprietor. A- 
mong the people in a country parifti, whofe farms are fmall 
and whofe tacks are only verbal, the refidence of heritors, if 
they be men of fenfe and virtue, is of the greateft advantage. 
They filence difputes, and terminate any differences that may 
arile, by their authority 5 they fet an example of induftry, 
and by their fmiles or their frowns, not only diainguifh the 
deferving from the worthlefs, but reward the one, while they 
punifti the other. Beyond all difpute, whatever promotes induf- 
try alfo promotes virtue ; and whatever weakens vice and ftreng- 
thens virtue, has an evident tendency to proiriOte population. 
Befides thefe means, the proprietor alluded to has made ufe 
of others ftill more efFe£tual. Finding, on his entry, a pau- 
city of hands for executin'g his plans of improvement, he 
ibon erected between 20 and 30 new houfes, which arc filled 
with young people that have married, and with families 
from other iflands. Thefe have almoft all of them nume- 
rous families of children ; and, what is a clear evidence of 
their vaft increale is, that about 17 years ago the youngeft 
child in the fmall diftrifl of Sound, was 13 years of age, and 
the fame diftricl contains now, at and below that age, about 
70 children. As there has been no regifter of deaths kept 
here, we cannot compare the births and deaths together, in 
order to alcertain the extent of the increafe ; nor have the 
regifters of the marriages and baptifms, on account of the 
laft minifter's infirm ftate of health for fome time before his 
death, been brought down to the prelent period. From the

As there is plenty of excellent peat in the parlfli, as the 
air is wholefome, and food is in tolerable abundance, the 
people live long ; and, what is of far more confequence, they 
are, even at an advanced age, both vigorous and healthy. In 
proof of this, we may obfervc, that there are feveral above 
90, fome of whom work every day in boats and otherways j 
and that laft harveft, which was no lefs long than rainy, 
fome that were between 80 and 90 years of age, were em- 
ployed conftantly in the laborious talk of fhearing. To the 
iame purpofe it may be obferved, that a gentleman of curio- 
fity, fome fhort time ago, wrote to a woman in this parifli to 
know her age, as he had been informed it was uncommon ; 
the woman was no lefs diftinguifhed for her good fenfe thaa 
her veracity, and wrote him for anfwer, that fhe was born 
1688. She fpecified many remarkable events, which flae 
diftindlly remembered j and concluded her letter by inform- 
ing him, that although ihe was at that time 97, Ihe had writ- 
ten

ten it without fpeaacles. To conclude, in order to give this 
parifh the decree of profperity of which it is capable, the 
heritors foould refide on their eftates, and by the combined in- 
fluence of their money, their authority, and example, point out 
to them the road to happincfs. The farms, which at prefent 
are too fmall, Ihould be 2 or 3 of them joined into one ; tacks 
of confiderable length fliould be granted ; the rents and feu- 
duties ihould not be paid in kmd, but in money ; and fer- 
vices of every fort fliould be aboliflied, with a view to induce 
men of fubftance and induftry to become farmers. If, to 
thefe improvements, a better mode of agriculture were ad- 
ded, and were the people that could be fpared from the mak- 
ing of kelp, and the cultivation of the ground, employed in 
fifliing, and fome beneficial manufaaure, Shapinfliay would 
foon raife her head high among her fifter ifles, and would 
not fufi'er by a comparifon with almoft any other ifland b«- 
longing to Scotland.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1016323">LUSS</name>

(County and Presbytery n,. 

^ lERY OF Dumbarton—Synod 

OF Glasgow and Ayr.) 
By the Rev. Mr John Stuart, MinlJIer, '</head>

<p>

Situation, Extent, Ereclion, and DisjunBions. 
•THHE parifh of Luss is fituated in the county and pref- 
J- bytery of Dumbarton, and in the fynod of Glafgow 
and Ayr. It is about 8^ Englifh miles long from S. to N 
and from 2£ to 5 miles broad. It is bounded on the fouth 
by the parifhes of Bonhill and Cardrofs ; on the north by the 
panfli of Arrochar ; on the eaft by Lochlomond ; and on the 
weft by the parilh of Row. It was formerly of great extent 
reaching, on the weft fide of Lochlomond, from the one end 
of that lake to the other, and comprehending fome of the 
lands on its eaft fide, together with moft of its iflands. 

By an aft of the Privy Council, In the year 1621, the 
lands of Buchanan were disjoined from (his parifh, and an- 
nexed to that of Inchcalloch. About the year 1650, the 
lands of Auchindcnnan, Cameron, Stockrogert, and Tulli- 
chewen were disjoined from it, and annexed to the parifii of 
Bonhill. In 1658, the lands of Arrochar were disjoined 
from it, and formed into a feparate pariOi. But the lands 

of 



of Lufs. 

of Calclanach, Prefstelloch, and Conglens, belonging once to 
the parifli of Inchcalloch, are now annexed, quoad omma, and 
the lands of Bannachrae, belonging properly to the pariflx 
of Row, are contidered as annexed, quoad facra, to that of 
Lufs. 

SoiL Surfacey Clmate. Longevity, and Di/eafes.— The foil is 
in general light and gravelly, but in fome parts there is good 
loam. The principal level land lies near Lochlomond, and 
chiefly where the rivers dilcharg£ themfelves into it, formed 
probably in the courfe of ages, by the fand and foil carried 
down from the higher grounds by the torrents. Scarcely one 
twelfth of the furface is arable. The greateft part is hiUy 
and mountainous. The climate is mild and temperate. Snow 
fcldom lies many days on the low grounds. In fevere win- 
ters, the degree of cold has been found to be confiderably 
greater near Glafgow and Edinburgh than in this country. 
Hollies, and other plants in the hedges and gardens, have 
there been killed by the froft, when here they remained un- 
hurt. The mountains and woods break the force of the 
winds in every direction •, and the exhalations from that part 
of the lake which never freezes, may perhaps likewife ferve 
to temper the atmolphere. The air, though often moift, is 
remarkably healthful. Many of the people live to a great 
age. The venerable lift of old perfons, in the little village of 
Lufs, in 1769, is well known *. A man who refided in it

death, and whofe ages, in 1793, when added together, made 
310 years. The eldeft of the brothers is ftiU in good health, 
and has at prefent alive 3 fons and 4 daughters, 54 grand- 
children, and 10 great-grand-children. In 1793, there were 
likewife 4 fillers german living in the parifli, whofe ages to- 
gether made 312 years. The people are fubjea to few dif- 
cafes. Fevers and confumptions are the moft common. The 
former of thefe are generally imported from other parts, and 
fpread by infedlion, 

Lake and ProfpeEis, — Lochlomond, either for extent, or 
variety and magnificence of fcenery, is not perhaps to be 
equalled by any lake in Great Britain. Its beauties arc fo 
well known, and have already been fo well defcribed by 
others, as to make any new defcription of them unneceflary *. 
There are feveral fine views of them to be feen from the 
high road on each fide of it, and from the adjacent heights, 
each of which has its admirers. Thofe which are common- 
ly reckoned beft, are from the top of the higheft hills in 

the

the Iflands of Inchtavanach and Inchmurren, the Stronc hill 
rear Lufs, and the point of Farlcin ; but, in order to have 
this laft view in the gttatell perfcdtion, it is neceffary to a- 
fcend conliderably higher than the line ot the road. Loch- 
lomond is about 24 Ecglifh miks long, in lome p^rtb above 
7 miles broad, and contains above 20,oco acres ot water, its 
depth fouth from Lufs fcldom exceeds 20 fathoms, or 120 
feet. North from that it is much greater. Oppolitc to the 
point of Farkin it is 66, and a little farther north 80 fa- 
thoms. For about a mile fouth from Tarbet it is, with little 
iifFerence, 86 fathoms ; but about two miles north from it, 
oppofite to Alt-garv, it is 100 fathoms, which is probably the 
^reateft depth of the lake. Beyond that its depth gradually 
diminilhes to its north end. The north and deeper part of 
Lochlomond is never covered with ice ; but fouth from Lufs, 
in fevere frolts, its iurface has been lo completely frozen, as 
to render it lafe for men, and even tor iiorlts and loaded 
fleds, to go from each fide to the different iflands. Ic is re- 
markable, however, that part of tiie narrow lound between, 
the iflands of Inchtav?nach and Inchconagan, the avtragc 
depth of which no where exceeds two fatlioms and a half, 
and where there is no perceptible current, yet was never 
-known to freeze, not even in the yc-r 1 740. '1 his, perhaps, 
may be owing to fome fprings rifing there, fed by the/ adja- 
cent high grounds. After great fl ods in winter, the fur- 
face of Lochlomond has been known to rife about 6 feet 
higher than it is after much drought m fumnier. Its average, 
height above the level of the lea is 22 feet ; but that it is 
now confiderably higher than it once was, and is therefore 
gaining upon the ground, there is clear evidence. Acrols the 
channel of the river Falloch, at the north end of the lake, 
there are ftones fixed at regular diflances, once evidently in- 
tended for enabling paflengers to ftep from one flde to the 
Vol. XVIL I i ^.ther, 



242 Siatijlical Account 

other, but now never covered with lefs than 4 or 5 feet depth 
of water. Near the middle of the Bay of Camaraddan, 
when the water is low, there is a heap of ftones to be feen, 
where the Colquhoun's of Camftraddan are laid to have orce 
had their family refidence. Cambdcn, in his Atlas Briiati- 
fitcoy defcribes an ifland as exifting there in his day, in which 
there was a houfe and an orchard*. About 5 miles farther 
fouth, at a diflance from the ftiore, there is another heap of 
ftones, faid to be the ruins of a church. A field oppofite to 
it is ftill called Ach-na-heaglals^ or the churth-field. This 
rife of the furface of the lake, is probably owing to the fand 
and mud fubfiding near the mouth of the Leven, and dam- 
ming up the water. 

IJlands. — There are at prefent about 30 iflands in Lochlo- 
mond, fmall and great. Moft of them are hnely wooded. 
Some of them are inhabited, and prove, at times, commo- 
dious afylums to the difordered in mind. Ten of them are 
confiderable in fize; four of thefe belong to the pari (h of 
Lufs : ly?, Inchiavanach^ above , three quarters of an Er-glifh 
mile long, and about two furlongs and a half broad, conrains 
135 Scotch acres, of which 127 are under a good o«k wood, 
which is moderately valued at 1000 1. each cutting, once in 
20 years. The remaining acres are outfield, and c^rry at 
times a good crop. The ifland is not at prefent inhabited. 
A monk is faid, at a remote period, to have fixed his refi- 
dence there, from whom it derives its name of Inch-ta-vanachy 
i. e. the ijland of the monk's houfe. A fweerer retirement, 
or more adapted for contemplation, he could not perhaps 
have chofen. 2diyy Inchconogan^ fituated on the eaft fide of

and fir wood, ^dly, Inchmoaft, u e. the mofs yie, lying a lit- 
tie to the fouth of Inchconagan, about three quarters of a 
mile long and a quartfer broad, contains 99 acres, mofily of 
mofs, from which the village of Lufs and the neighbourhood 
are fupplied with peats, ^thly, Inchlonaig, near a mile long» 
and above a quarter of a mile broad, contains 145 acres, 66 
of which are under a natural wood of old yews. The whole 
ifland has for many years been kept as a deer park by the fa- 
mily of Lufs. 

Phenomena,— Loc\i\ovnonA has been long famed for three 
tfonders, fifi -without Jlns, -waves -without -wind, and a 
footing ijland. Vipers, which abound in the iflands, and arc 
fo far amphibious as to fwim from one to another, are pro- 
bably the fj)} ivithout fins. A man of undoubted veracity, 
who lives in the village of Lufs, affirms that he has feen one 
of them attempt to get into a boat in which he was, and 
that it was inftantly killed. A fwelling -wave vSithout any 
nvind perceptible at the time, is not peculiar to this lake. It 
may be obferved, wherever there is a great extent of water, 
if a calm immediately fucceeds a ftorm. But independent of 
any commotion in the atmofphere, at the time of the re- 
markable earthquake at Lifbon, in 1755, the water of Loch- 
lomond rofe fuddenly feme feet above its former level, and 
was otherwife uncommonly agitated ; and fomc phenomena 
of this kind, obferved at a remote period, may have been the 
Kvonder alluded to. A fmall ifland lying neaf the weft fiiore 
of Inchconagan, is called the Floating Ifland. It is now, at 
leafl, fixed there j but that it may have once floated is cre- 
dible. In that cafe, it muft probably have been a mofl'y frag- 
ment, detached by the waves from the neighbouring ifle of

grafles, gales, or Dutch myrtles,, willows, &amp;c. In a fmall 
lake in the Highlands of Perthfhire, a Jioaiing ijland of this 
kind adually exifts *. 

Rivers. — There are 4 rivers in the parlfli, all of which dif- 
charge themfelves into Lochlomond, but none of them arc 
remarkable for fizc; ly?. The river Froon, which rifes in 
Glenfroon, and enters into the lake near the fouth end of 
the parifh. zdly^ The river of Finlafs. -i^dly^ That of Ltifs. 
And, 4^/6/^, That of Douglafs^ which forms a great part of 
the boundary between the parifhes of Lufs and Arrochar. 

Woods, ^c. — There are 880 acres under natural wood. 
Of thefe there are about 700 almoft entirely under oak woods, 
which have been ufually cut down once in 20 years, and at 
laft cutting produced about 14000 bolls of bark f. A cutting 
of the whole oak woods of that age, at an average of prices 
for 15 years paft, may be valued at 7600 1. They are of 
fuch extent as to admit of their being properly divided into 
20 feparate hags or parts, one of which may be cut every 
year. The cutting commences about the beginning of JVJay,

From the foregoing table of marriages, baptifms, and bu- 
rials, as recorded in the pariih regilttr, it appe.u's that the 
population, for 20 years pait, is not very different from what 
irt -was at the beginning of this century. About 35 years 
ago, upon the introdud'tbn of fouth country fheep, an union 
of farms took place, which, at the time, muft have dimini- 

fhed

fej ,he number s lU.le. But that lofs has Gnce been more 
!bl„ co,„penra.ed, by the additional hands employed ,n the 
flace-quarries and other works. 

Agriculture, Produce, and Imports.-Tht principal crops arc 
cats, bear or big, and potatoes. Peafe and flax are bkewife 
raifed, but in fmaller quantities. Upon fbnae of the farms, 
artificial gralTcs have of late been cultivated with luccels. 
Oats peafe, and flax, are fown from the middle of March 
to the end of April, and bear from the end of April to the 
bePinning of June. Potatoes are planted from the middle 
of April to the loth of May. The crops are commonly 
reaped from the beginning of September to the beginning of 
Oaober, and all got in before the middle of that month. 
But in unfavourable feafons, the harveft is fometimes not 
over till the loth of November. The pariQi does not fup- 
ply itfelf with meal. About 200 bolls are annually im- 
ported. 

Horfes aud Block Caitk. — Few horfes are br.-d in the pa- 
rilh They are generally bought at the diflerent markets, 
fbr the purpofes of agriculiure. Cows are moflly kept for 
the convenience of families. Befides maintaining the llock, 
however, a few calves are fattened every year tor the butcher, 
and fonie young cattle are reared for lale. 

Sf,ffp. — The higher grounds are now flocked almoft en- 
tirely with Ihetp, of which there are about 7500. They arc 
all of the black-faced Linton kind, and kept almoft entirely 
for breeding, for which the nature of the pafiure is more 
adapted than for fattening. A breeding ftock of 600 flieep,

The profit arifing from fuch a ftock, feems inadequate to 
the trouble and r.ik i but it is to be obferved, that, m moft 
fhecp farms, there are fome low arable and grafs grounds, 
the produce of which, in diimating their value, is feldom 
taken into the account. Much depends upon the tuiics, and 
n^uch upon management. In the event of a fevere winter 
or f ring, the number of lambs for fale falls often one third 
ftort'of the foregoing ftatement. The dife.f. called braxy,

when 'the lean efcape. It is moft fatal to them on a change 
of weather from froft to thaw, or thaw to' froft, but efpecially 
during hoar froft. In open winters few fuffer by it. Taking 
care that the pafture is neither too rich nor too poor, is rec- 
koned the moft efFeaual way of preventing it, and changing 
the pafture immediately, the moft eflxaual way of curing it.

or half an acre of land is annexed. The tenants of thj 
foaller farms, as well as the cottagers, depend often more 
upon days labotir, or feme other employment, than upon the 
produce of any land they polTefs. 

Wages, Provyions, Fuel, es^.—The common wages of men 
fcrvants are from 7 I. to p I. a year, with their maintenance i

• State of Property, esf^.^There are 3 heritors, one of whonn 
refides occafaonally. Sir James Colc^jhoun of Lufs, Bart, 
is proprietor of far the greateft part of the lands in the pa- 
rifh The family refidence is about 3. miles louth from Luis, 
at Rofedoe or Rofsdow, I e. the black promontory or head- 
land a name which is not now very applicable to it, as it is 
finely wooded, and the black mofs which once abounded 
there is now moiily converted into meadow. There is an 
excellent modern houie there, which commands fome nobler 
views of the lake, it was built by the late Sir James Col- 
quhoun, who refided in the pariQi for many years, the in- 
fluence of whofe authority and example, in checking all ten- 
deticy to dilorder, and in promoting the interefts of virtue* 
and religion, is ftiU fenfibly felt, and his memory, therefore, 
much and juftly rcfpefted. 

Minerals There are two flate quarries, one upon the 

eftate of Camftraddan, and the other upon the eftate of Lufs. 
From the former of thefc, for 5 years paft, from 250,000 

to 



2^4 Siatijiical Account 

to 360,000 flates, and from the latter quarry, from roo,ooo 
to 170,000 Hates have been annually exported. Some of 
them were fent to Greenock, Glafgow, and Paifley, but 
the greater part to the banks of the Leven. and acrofs Loch- 
omond to Stirlingfhire. The flates are of an excellent qua- 
hty and were fold at from i 1. 4 s. to U. 15 s. the thou- 

cl\ T employed in the 

Camftraddan quarry, and about 10 in the other. Some of 
them work upon days wages ; but the greater part by the 
piece. They commonly get at the rate of 15 s. per ,000 
and It takes i s. 4 d. per 1000 to lead the flates from the 
quarry to the fhore. In the fouth end of the parifh there 
.s hkewife a very good free-ftone quarry, from which the 
ftones to the houfe of Rofedoe. and the other principal houfes 
m the parifh, have been taken , but it is only wrought occa- 
fionally. 



Mamf/ac^urrs.^la 1790, a cotton-mill was ercfted near 
the village of Lufs It is of the fize moft fuitable to the 
place, fufficiently large to give bread to fuch as might other- 
wife be in want of employment, but not to give encourage 
ment to the vices which are fo apt to abound, wherever a 
promifcuous multitude of people are afTembled. From 30 
to 40 hands, young and old, have been ufually employed in 
it. Of late, owing to the general ftagnation of trade, little 
work has been carried on in it. A thread manufafturc, upon 
a fmall kale, is lifccwife carried on at Dunfin, near the fbuth 
end of the parifh. 

A^jtiquitles.^Ahout a mile and a quarter fouth from Lufs, 
there arc the remains of a large or heap of i^ones] 

called Carn-ma-cheofoig, or, the Cairn of St. Kefog, who is 
aid, at ac early period, to have fuffcred death there, and 

to 



to have been buried in the chureh of Lufs. He was long 
revered, therefore, as the tutelar faint of the par.ft In 
he church-yard there are fon,e ftone coffins of confiderable 
antiquity. Each of them.confifts of one entire ftone, w.th a 
cavity cut out of it, fit for holding a dead body at .s full 
length, and a ftone lid for covering it. There is no mfcr.p- 
tion upon either of theau 

Church t, b-^.-The church is uncommbnly good. It was 
built in I77i by the late Sir Jan.es Colquhoun of Lufs, 
.vithout layi-ng any part of the burden upon the other hen- 
tors The manfe was built in 1740, is infufficient, and at 
prefent in need of repair. The hving confifts of 72 bolls of 
oat-meal, at the rate of 81- ftones per boll, 6 bolls of bear, 
J 9 1. 12 s. 94- d. Sterling in money, and a good glebe. There 
is a procefs of augmentation at prefent depending. Sir 
James Colquhoun is patron of the parifh. 

Schools 

* The high veneration in which the memory of this faint 
was held in early times, appears from a charter to John, Laird 
©f Lufs, preferved in the chartulary of Lennox, which Robert, 
Kin? of Scotland, conErms in the loth year of his reign : 

" Omnibus hoc fcriptum vifuris, vel audituns, Malcolmus

with the confent, and at the defire of their refpeftive patrons, 
ereded into prebendaries.

Schooh and P....-.There are two fchools, for each of 
Which a good houfe has been lately built. One of thcfe is 
the panlh fchool, in which the number of fcholars is gene- 
rally from 30 to 50. The falary is 10 1. Sterling. The 
Ichool fees for reading Englifh are i s. 6 d. per quarter; for 
reading and writing, 2 s. ; for arithmetic, 2 s. 6 d. ; and for 
Latin, 5 s. The other fchool is fupported by the Society 
for propagating Chriftian Knowledge. The number of fcho- 
lars who attend it, during the whole or part of the year, is 
about 80. The emoluments of the fchoolmafter confift of 
13 I. Sterling of falary, a dwelling houfe, garden, cow's grafs, 
and fome fchool fees. Ihe children of the poor are taught 
gratis. 

The Society have likewife of late allowed a falary for a 
fewing fchool at Lufs. The number of poor, at prefent up- 
on the roU, is 10. Some of thefe get weekly, and others 
occaConal fupplies, according to their neceffities. The fuuds 
for their fupport arife from the colledions on Sunday, rents 
of feats in the church, marriage and mort-cloth dues, and 
the Interell of 150 h Sterling of ftock, amounting, at an a- 
veragc, to 37 1. Sterling yearly. L. 50 of the faid ftock 
were bequeathed by the late Robert Carmichael, Efq; of 
Broomley. 

Language and CharaBer, — South from Lufs, Englifli, and 
north from it the Gaelic, is the prevaiHng language. The 
fervice in church is performed in each of thefe. The peo- 
ple, in general, are fobcr and indui'lrious, humane and cha- 
ritable. They are regular in their attendance on the ordi- 
nances of religion. The example, in this refped, of the fa- 
milies of chief rank for many years paft, has, without doubt, 
had confiderable influence upon thofe in inferior ftations. 



RoadSf 



if Lufsl '2.^7 

Roads, Ale.houfes, b'^.-The roads have of late been much 
attended to, and are at prefent in good repair. In the 1786, 
an aa of Parliament was obtained for converting the ftatute 
laliour of this county into money, which has had good ef- 
fefts —There are 9 licenfed ale and whillcy houfes, and one 
inn. Four years ago there were 5 licenfed fliUs for diftil- 
ling whilky i now there is but one of 36 gallons. 

Advantages and Di/advantages. ^The principal difadvanta- 
ges under which this pari(h labours, are the great expence 
of fuel, the fcarcity of natural manures, and the high price 
of labour, and of every neceffary of life, owing to the neigh- 
bourhood of fo many great manufaauring concerns ; but 
that neighbourhood, on the othtr hand, is a great advantage 
to fuch as have any articles to difpofe of. 

Hints for Improvements. — Woods in general, and oak 
woods in particular, are now become valuable every where, 
and efpecially upon the banks of Lochlomond. Whatever, 
therefore, relates to their improvement, muft be well wor- 
thy the attention of every proprietor. An acre of oak wood 
here, at an average, is worth from 10 s. to 12 s. a year j 
which is a much greater return than could be had from as 
much ground of equal quality in any other way whatever — 
The firft great objeft to be attended to, is the inclofing the 
great body of the wood with a fufficient ftone dyke. The 
temporary wooden fence, which is commonly raifed round it 
every time it is cut, feldom lafts above 4 years, and often a-, 
mounts to one third, fometimes to one half the cxpence of a. 
i\one wall. The wood thus inclofed fl^ould, as foon as cir- 
cumflanccs will permit, be taken entirely into the proprie- 
tor's hands, whofe interefl: it will be to encourage the natu- 
ral growth of oak, afli, holly, and other valuable timber, and. 



to

to plant all the vacant fpaces with trees fuited to the foil 
Oak woods are never entirely out of the reach of cattle, and 
they ought never, therefore, to be permitted to enter them. 
yor 4 or 5 years, all agree they muft be carefully prcferved from 
them ; and, after that time, if they are thriving, and thc5/ is 
Sufficiently thick, the pafture in them is no object. As to the 
age at vphich an oak wood Ihould be cut,there are different opi- 
nions. That there is a period, however, beyond which it fliould 
3iot be permitted to grow, cannot be doubted. After it is cut, 
4he moft vigorous flioots are always obferved to fprlng from 
well rooted young flocks, from 3 to 6 inches in diameter. 
Some of thefe will grow the firft year from 4 even to 7 feet 
in height, and near the ground will meafure above half an 
5nch in diameter. In proportion as the parent flocks are 
older and larger, the flioots are lefs vigorous, and when the 
ilocks are 13 or 14 inches in diameter, there are cither no 
young fhoots at all, or they are very feeble. If the great 
object, therefore, be to produce, at ftated periods, a quanti- 
ty of bark for the market, it muft be the ruin of a copfe 
3cept for that purpofe to allow it all to grow very old. If in 
this country it exceeds much the ufual period of 20 or 22 
years, the bark becomes inferior in quality, and the Jlool will 
fufFer more by age, than the additional value of the timber 
and bark can compenfate. In order to make any oak wood, 
however, fell to advantage, it is neceflary that there fhould 
be a certain proportion of timber of different flzes, as well as 
bark. At every cutting, therefore, it is ufual to leave fo 
xmriy Jiandard trees of different ages, for the benefit of future 
fales. Thefe fliould always be healthy and vigorous, and 
either in tlie outer fkirts of the wood, or in vacant fpaces, 
where they are detached from other trees. When left vvith-

the plants from the feed, and the expence of gettmg then, 
from a nurfery, is the great bar to the general u e of them 
That bar might here be eafily removed ; the hollies wh,ch 
„row wild in the woods, naturally lay their own branches,

rooted plants could foon be got, which might fafely be tranf- 
planted at fuch an age as to make almoll an immediate

The having the whole lands of a country engrofled into 
a few hands, is certainly much againft the public intqreft. 
Every man, however, who depends entirely upon the pro- 
duce of his fields, ought to have, at leaft, as much land as is 
fufficient for affording himfelf and his family a comfortable 

fubfiftence

therefore, „.ll permit, their boundaries ought to be th 
great boundaries of nature. When the pafture of a hill or 
mountam ts parcelled out among two or ,h„e different te. 
nants, without any inacceff.ble gulli,, or rocks to form a line 
of reparation, the cattle of each will be conftantly trefpaffin, 
fomewhere, and therefore conftantly chaced from one part to 
another, fo that neither will receive much benefit from it 
Common pafture, in fuch a cafe, is feldom found to be a re' 
medy for the evil. Whatever wife and juft regulations may 
»t firft be laid down for fixing the proportion of cattle to be 
kept by each, they are never in faft adhered to ; and the 
ground is always overftocfced. 

The prefcnt breed of Iheep in this parifh may perhaps be 
changed with advantage. In every attempt of this kind 
however, great caution is necefTary. The trial fhould firft 
be made with fmall parcels, and rather by the proprietors 
than by the tenants. Sheep are delicate animals, fubjeft to 
many difeafes, and when they are taken from one country 
to another, or even from one farm to another, it takes

soing tenant the ftocfc of fteep upoa it. wh.ch he reckons 
« the rate of at lead J s. a head more valuable to h.m than 

to any other. , , i j j 

Though the tenants are now more comfortably lodged 
than they once were, there is ftill, in that refpeft, room for 
improvement. In a country which abounds fo much with 
flates, it may appear furprifing that fo few of the houfes 
Ihould be covered with them, though there can be no doubt, 
but in the iffue, they would be found lefs expenfive than 
any thatch which could be ufed. The great obftacle to the 
ufe of them for that purpofe, at prefent, is the expence of 
the timber required. That obftacle, it is hoped, will in 
time be removed. When the extenfive and thriving plan- 
tationsi in different parts of the country, have grown up, 
timber will be more eafily got. 

All thefe improvements, however, are more wanted in 
many other parts than here, where fome of them have al- 
ready taken place. Within thefe 26 years, above 4000 1. 
Sterling have been laid out upon the eftate of Lufs alone, in 
inclofing the woods and arable grounds with fufficient ftone 
dykes and other fences, and in planting ; not to fpeak of the 
fums expended upon other improvements. Within the 
fame fpace of time, near 100 acres of wafte land have been 
brought into tillage, and now produce tolerable crops.

Name, Situation, and Extent. 

THIS pariOi confifts of four iflands, Eigg, Rum, Canna^ 
and Ifle Muck. It was a part of the parifli of Sleat, 
'Until the year 1726. At its ereftion into a feparate charge, 
it was called the parifli of Eigg, (it being the moft valuable 
ifland, and that in which the minifter refides), or Short Ifles. 
In procefs of time, the name was, by an eafy tranfition, 
changed from Short to Small Ifles. Eigg is fituated in the 
county of Invernefs, the other three iflands are in the coun- 
ty of Argyle. The parifli is in the prefljytery of Sky and 
fynod of Glenelg. Eigg is between 4 and 5 miles in length, 
and from 2 to 3 in breadth. Through the middle of it 
there is a hallow, called, in Gaelic, Eagg, hence the ifland 
derives its name. It is computed to be about 8 miles wefl: 
from the point of Arrifaig, the neareft part of the main land. 
Riim is fituated about 5 computed miles W, N. W. from 
Eigg. It fcems to derive its name from the Gaelic word 
Mhum, fignifying extent, as it is the mofl: extenfive of thefe 
iflands, being 8 miles long, 8 miles broad, and containing 
above 22,000 fc^uare acres. Canna is 4 computed miles wefl: 

from 



of Small IJles. 273- 

from Rum, and is about 4 computed mile, long, and one 
broad. Ifle iVIuck lies about 4 W S. W. from the 

ncareft part of Eigg. is between 2 and 3 miles in lengrh. and 
one in breadth. This .Hand is caliea m Gael.c, EilUan nan 
Muchd, which, literally tranfln.ed, is, IJlund of Swine; hence 
Me Muck, and Buchauan very properly calls it Lijula For- 



corum. 



Jppearance,^The ifland of Eigg is partly flat, but princi- 
pally hilly and rocky. The hills are covered with heath, 
which, in fomc places, is mixed with coarfc grafs. Its low 
grounds are partly deep, partly (hallow, and tolerably pro- 
duaive, where there is a depth of foil. Rum is in general 
hilly, mountainous, and rocky, much fitter for pafture than 
crop Canna is partly high, and partly low ground, the high 
good for pafture, and the low tor crop Ifle Muck is pretty 
low, excepting one hill of no confiderable height ; its foil is 
in general good. The height of the Rum hills alone feems 
worthy of notice, but for want of proper inftruments, it can- 
not at prcfent be alcert,iined. Oi thefc the fummits are iiU 
moft wholly rocky and barren. 

Vegetable and Jnimal ProduBions. — The parifh produces, 
barley, oats, potatoes, flax, kails, and a few other garden 
ftufts in fmall quantities. In Canna, great oats anl'wer pret- 
ty well ; on Eigg, the cultivation of this grain has been at- 
tempted for two years pafl:, but did not fucceed. Af er it 
tomes to the ear, it is lodged, and great part of it rot', on 
the ground, owing to the frequent and heavy falls of rain. 
On barley and fmall oats, the rain has often a fimilar efJr(5V, 
though not in an equal degree. It is with reafon believed, 
that green crops would anfwer better. The crop leJdom af- 
fords the inhabitants a competent iubiiftence. For fcveral

all got ,n tm near the end of November. The fhores would 
produce about 50 tons kelp annually, if the leafon was very 
favourable, but the quanuty muft depend greatly upon t J 
weather. The animals reared in the parjlh are horles, horn- 
ed cattle, fteep, and a few goats, Horles are reared for lale 
in Rum only: They are hardy and h.gh mettled, though of 
a fn.all fize. The horned cattle of Canna and Ifle Muck 
grow to a confiderable lize. owing to the finenefs of their 
grafs J but, when carried to market, they are liable to a dif- 
temper called the bloody urine, which of courfe reduces their 
pnce. Moll of the farmers in E.gg, and the principal tackf- 
nian m Canna, rear a few of the fmaller forr of fheep for 
the ufe of their families. One farm in Eigg was begun to 
^be locked with black faced Iheep, about two years ago. 
They feem to multiply and thrive well. There are no fheep 
in Iflc Muck. In Rurp, there is a confiderable number of 
Wi native Iheep; their fleih is dehcious, and their wool 
valuable. A quantity of it is fent yearly to the Redcaftle 
market, near Invernefs, where it often fells at 14 s. the 
Aone, while other wool fells about half that price. This 
ifland fcems beft calculated for rearing fheep, being almoft 
wholly covered with hills and high mountains, but the pro- 
prietor's attachment to the inhabitants, has hitherto prevent- 
ed its being flocked with ihem only. In Rum there were 
formerly great numbers of deer ; there was alfo a copfe of 
vpod, that afFprded cover to their fawn from birds of prey,

fomctimes at a great diftance from the fhore, even near the 
tops of high hills. Their young, before they leave the neft, 
are as large as the dam, tranfparent with fat. and delicious 
to the tafte of many. It is believed, that the young puffia 
becomes To weighty with fat. as to be unable to take the 
Avmg and leave as neft : To remedy this inconvenience, the 
old puffin is raid to adminifter forrel, to extenuate, and ren- 
der it fit for flying. It is, at any rate, a known faft, that 
forrel is commonly found to grow near the puffin's neft. 
There is a fmall kind of black crow peculiar to Eigg, having 
its body, back, head, and neck, of a greyiffi blue colour, and 
feemingly of the fize of a pigeon. In Tome of the high hills 
of Rum, ptarmigans are found. In refpeft of fize, they are 
fomewhat lefs than groule ; and, for fccurity againft birds of 
prey, they affiime the colour of the ground ; in cold fcafons 
they are white as fnow ; in other feafons they are fpotted 
white and blue, like the craggy cliffs among which they 
live. Here plovers are not numerous. There are a few 
curlews, fnipea, and herons, with many other birds, of too 
little importance to be feverally mentioned. Our migratory 
birds, are rails, cuckows, woodcocks, fwallows, ardic gulls, 

and

arc too well known to be inUftcd on.

ding to the fituation of the coafts of the -flaods On the 
u h coa. of Eigg, there is a f.all .fl.nd calied E.llan Chaf- 
tel which is good for pafture, and a pend-cle of a con.guous 
farm in Eigg. A few pcrlons, tending cattle, hve upon it 
during a part of the lumnrer months only. The found be- 
tween th,s ifland and Eigg, makes a tolerable harbour for a 
few veffels not exceeding 70 tons. It has no great dep h of 
water, and conlequcntly, with faring tides, fuch vefllls arc 
apt to take the ground, the conkqucne of which, in leverc 
weather, might be dar.gerous. This harbour is in the 
courfe of veffels from the point of Ardnamurchan to iflft 
Oronlay in Sleat, oppofitc to Loch Urn, and nearly equi- 
dittant from the latter and Tobermory. There are two- 
entrances to it, the one from the fouth-weft, and the o- 
ther from the north-eaft, in a line par.aid to the above 
courfe, and fo muft be a good outlet for either ot the aforc- 
faid harbours. Within this harbour, a pier has been built 
by the u.habitants, for the Itcurity of filhmg bo4ts and (mall 
Teilcls, but on a plan not lufficicnily cxtcutivc for atcoaimo-. 
datmg veffels of the above ii,enlioi.'cd fize •, beiides that, it 
has been neglcdlcd for lome time, and become in a manner 
ruinous. If a pier, properly planned to afford protc^ion in 
ca(e of ftorms, were built here, this harbour might facilitate 
the navigation of herring buffcs, both north to the fi'i ing, 
and iouth to the market, it lies in a centrical fituation, be- 
tween the two former harbours, and, if accommodated as a- 
bove, might prevent buiTf^s, when overtaken by contrary- 
winds, or dUagreeable weather, from drivrng back to either,.,

und on the fouth fide of this harbour, a pier was begun a 
few years fince, which is ftill carried on. but not finifhed. 
This IS fuftained as ftatute labour. This harbour, to be fre- 
quented, needs only to be better known, as it is not only 
commodious in itfelf, but lies convenient for fupplies of beef 
and mutton at a very moderate rate. On the fouth-eaft fide 
of Canna lies the Sand IJland, feparated from the former by 
a very narrow found, which ebbs dry for the greateft part 
of every tide, and at high water, fifhing-boats can with dif- 
ficulty pafs through it. This ifland is valuable, and fit both 
for crop and pafture. It has 4 tenants on it, who hold of 
the proprietor, and pay about 60 1. rent. Between this ifland 
and Canna, lies the well known and n.uch frequented har- 
bour of that name. This harbour is fafe. efpecially for fl.ips 
©f moderate fize ; it is, however, fhallow and confined, and. 
Without a favourable wind, it is diflicult to enter or to leave' 
it ; and this ificonvenience is increafed by a large rock with- 
out the mouth of it, which is fometimes wholly under water.

in Ifle Muck. ,72. in all 1208. lefs than the prefent popu a, 
tion by 131 ; to which, if the number of emigrants hereafter 
p^entioned be added, the population feems to be greatly on 
the increafe. 

There are 8 male and 6 feiinale weavers, i houfe-carpcn. 
ter, and 5 boat-carpenters, 5 taylors, and 2 fmiths. Moft 
of thefe, befides their refpeftive trades, fpend a confiderablc 
part of their time in fifhing. labouring, and other neceffary 
occupations. There are few or no feamen, except thofe who 
follow the fifhing during a part of the year. There are two 
merchants, who bring their goods from the Glafgow market. 
There is one clergyman of the Eftablifhed church, on«: Ro- 
man Catholic prieft, one furgeon, and one fchooln^after ; ali 
thefe have their refidencc in Eigg,. 

In Eigg, 8 tenants pay rent to the proprietors ; in Car.na, 
5 ; in Ifle Muck, 24 5 and in Rum, 43, 

In the years 1788 and 1790, 183 fouls emigrated from 
this parifti to America, and 55 to the mainland of Scotland 
and to neighbouring iflands ; of thefe 176 left Eigg. A 
principal Caufe of this emigration was, that the country was 
overftocked with people, arifing from frequent early mar-- 
riagcs •, of courfe, the lands were able to fupply them but 
fcantily with the neceflaries. of life. It is not unfrequent, 
upon thefe occafions, for a parent to divide with his newly 
married fon, the pittance of land (fometimes a very fmall 
portion of a farm) poflefled by him, which muft: reduce botl\ 
to poverty and mifery. Another cau^fe of the emigration is,

that the Jfland of Elgg, which was formerly In part rented by 
fmall tenants, was divided among 8 principal tackfmen. 

Stones.^ln various parts of the coall of EIgg, there are 
bodies of free ftone, fome of it too foft, and fome of it fuffi- 
ciently folid to bear the chiffel ; but hitherto it has been 
converted to no ufeful purpofe that I know. On the N. W. 
fide of the ifland, there is alfo a body of fhelly limeftone. 
yielding fine lime, and not difficuh to burn ; this, if fuel 
were plentiful, might afford excellent manure. In Rum, 
there is a kind of light red rock, which has an affinity to ve- 
ry hard free ftone ; it drelTes well under the hammer, and is 
very fit for rough building. In one particular fpot, it is 
found in pretty thin flags, not difficult to quarry, fome of 
them about 5 feet fquare ; fome of them have been fquared 
vrith the hammer, and floors paved with them to very good 
ipurpofe. In this ifland, alfo, cryftalline and pebble ftones, 
not large In fize, but of great folidlty, are found. Glafs has 
been cut by fome of the cryftals. The pebbles are of various 
colours, and admit of a very fine polifti. 

Inundations. — On the north fide of Rum there is a rivulet, 
taking its rife in fome of the higheft mountains, which has 
often overflowed its banks, and, fpreading over the valley 
through which it runs, done confiderable damage to the 
growing corn, and fwept along fome of the peats cut in the 
neighbourhood. 

Language. -^The language, principally fpoken, and univer- 
fally underftood, is Gaelic, and from it the names of places 
feem mofl^ly to be derived ; yet it mufl: be confefled, that 
there are names of places, which the prefent inhabitants do 
not fully underftand, that feem to be derived from a lan- 
guage

WildForreft)-, Canna was called An i-eillan tarJfu^n, (the 
Ifland lying acrofs) and Ifle Muck, Tirr Chrainne, (the 
Sow's Ifland). But thcle may be fuppofed poetical names, 
given by the Gaelic bards ; and the fuperftitious are faid to 
have ufed them, and them only, when at fea, and bound for 
thefe iflands.

and tranflated to Uift in 1756. The prefent minifter is 
married, has 3 fons and 2 daughters. A manfe, for the firft 
time, was built in Eigg in 1790, and a preaching houfe in 
Eigg, for the firft time alfo, in 1793. 

State of the Poor. — The number of poor, on the kirk fef- 
fion roll, of the reformed religion, is 19, and thofe of the 
Roman Catholic, 20. They indifcriminately travel, and re- 
ceive alms through the parilh. There is no fixed fund, ex- 
cept about 30 s. a year given by Mr M'Lean of Coll, for the 
poor in Rum. The feflion fund confifts only of a little mo- 
ney colle£led on Sabbaths, and of fines paid by delinquents. 
This money is, once a year, diftributed among the poor of 
the reformed. The prieft is left at liberty to uplift fines 
from delinquents of his own perfuafion, and to apply them in 
a fimilar manner.

with viauals mafons, about 2 s. without viftuals ; aoema- 
kers at 8 d. with visuals. Taylors are generally paid by th^ 
piece work. In a fituation like this, it is difficult to afcer- 
tain the expence of a married common labourer in hufban- 
dry. The terms allowed them have no fixed ftandard. Ma- 
ny of them have one fourth of the crop they make with th« 
plough, being generally barley and oats, and a third of the 
crop they make with the fpade, and manure with fea-warc, 
which is principally potatoes, and grazing for two cows with 
their followers. This muft afford them but a fcanty fubfaf- 
tcncc efpecially in years of fcarcity, when they have a nu- 
merous family of weak children but, with the aid derived 
from the fhore, they are enabled to live. Thefe are fimply 
the wages of the man's perfonal labour, his wife giving na 
affiftancc, except a few weeks in harveft, to reap the crop. 
Single male fervants in hufbandry receive about 3 1. in mo-

to 3 1. a year, with fliocs and perquifites. Female domeftic 
fervants receive from 12 s. to 20 s. with flioes and feveral 
other perquifites. The average price of horfes may be about

being always in view of two others in oppofite dircaions

of firength. There arc no barrows or tumuli in the parifli, 
except one in Eigg, on the farm of Kiell Donnain, near aa 
old Popifh chapel, from which it lies at the diflance of about

t^^n a number of bones, but no fcull appeared among them 
it was again buried, at the diftance of a few yards from the 
place where it formerly lay. 

Among the curiofities of this parifh is tbe Compafs Hdl la 
Canna. It is called Compafs Hill, from its extraordmary ef- 
fca upon the mariner's cori^pafs. When a compafs is brougH 
to a particular fituation thereon, its needle is immediately 
reverfed. The fame efl^ft is produced by a fleep rock on 
the north fide of the entrance of the harbour, when a com- 
pafs is brought near it. In Rum is a well, called^ Toba. 
Dearg, (Red Well), the water of which is highly mmef al|, 
but very little ufed by the natives. 

If bafalticpillarimaybc confidercd as a fiifilcient proof 
of volcanoes, many of them appear in Eigg and Canna. Iq 
Canna they appear far diftant from the fea in Eigg, not on- 
ly near the fea, but near the top of its higheft hills. Even 
Scure Eigg, the higheft hill in that ifland, feems to be prin- 
cipally formed of a rock, having much of a bafaltic ap-, 
pearance. Along the coaft of Eigg, rocks are found remark- 
ably light and porous, which renders it probable that they 
have been once tortured in the fire. Even places may be 
pointed out, where fmall portions of thefe rocks feem to have 
been formerly in a liquid ftate. There are feveral caves a- 
long the coafts of the different iflands in this parifli, fome of 
which are not altogether unworthy of notice. On the S. 
W. fide of Eigg, there is one called Uamha Chrabhuidh (the 
Cave of Devotion), in which the Roman Catholic inhabitants,

te ght at the entrance, about 60 feet ; its length, ,20 feet 
and us breadth 30 feet. Near the entranced; this c5 
feme parts of the rock feem to have been once in a liquified 
ftate. At no great diftance eaft of this cave, is Uar.^a 
Fhrmne, (the Cave of Francis) remarkable not only for its 
form, but alfo for the murder of the inhabitants of this ifland 
by Aliftair Crotach, L.ird of M'Leod. The entrance of this 
CAVC ;s fp fmall, that a perfon muft creep on four for about 
12 feet; It then becomes pretty capacious, its length being 
213 feet, breadth 22, and height 17. With regard to the 
murder above mentioned, it is faid that fome of M-Leod's 
vafTals, returning from Glafgow, touched at the harbour of 
Eigg. Some Eigg women were then tending cattle in Eil 
lean Chaftell, the fmall ifland which forms this harbour. 
The ftrangers vifited, and maltreated the women. Thei^ 
friends having got information, purfued and deftroyed thofe 
ftrangers. This treatment of his vafTals, M'Leod confidered 
as an infult, and came in force to revenge their death. The 
inhabitants, apprifed of their danger, flocked to this cave 
for concealment, excepting 3, who took other places of re- 
fuge, and a boat's crew then iri Glafgow. M'Lcod, after 
, landing, having found no inhabitants, believed they had fled 
to the main-land, and refolved to return immediately to Sky. 
The people in the cave, impatient of their confinement, fent 
a fcout to reconnoitre, who imprudently fliewed himfelf up. 
on an eminence, where he was readily obferved by the ene- 
my, then aaually under fail for Sky. Unfortunately for the 
inhabitants, there was new laid fnow upon the ground. 
M^Leod re-Ianded, and traced the fcout to the cave's mouth : 
He ofi^ered, upon delivering up to him the murderers of hi^ 
people, to fparc the other inhabitants. The terms were re-

t confined air of this cave, the bones are Ml pretry frelh,

About 40 flculls have been lately numbered here. It is pro- 
bable a greater number was deftroyed ; if fo, their ne.gh- 
bouring friends may have carried them off for buriJ m coa- • 
fccratcd ground. 

Seafaring, b'f.-As to feafaring. the people appear fond 
of fifhing only. They feldom enter on board the navy, un- 
lefs compelled. There arc but two decked veffels, of about 
25 tons each. The number of fiOiing-boats is about 15, 
and ot 1 aflage boats to, from 2 to 4 tons each. Eleven 
young men in Rum inlifted in the Breadalbanc fencible re- 
gimei.ti m March 17^3. In E.gg and Canna there was no 
Tecruiting carried on and in ifle Muck, none inlifted, 
though rtquirtd by the proprietor. 

Way oj LmtJg.—Thc people appear neither expenfive nor 
luxurious. They live chiefly upon potatoes and hcrrii.gs ; 
and among the n ore opulent tackfmen, a difli of tea 4nd a 
dram of wh iky are their greatelt luxuries. 

Mvaniages and Di/advantages.— The healthy fituation of 
the pariQi, and the filhing grounds near its coalts are among 
its greateft advantages. Eigg fceuis pretty equally divided 
as to crop and palture grounds, and, in plentiful feaions, 
fhould maintain its prefcnt inhabitants. Canna, llle Muck, 
and Rum, are not inconveniently fituated, mutually to affift 
each other, if a plan proper for this purpofe were adopted. 
Kum might help the iunimcr grazing of Canna and Ifle 
Muck, and render their cattle fitter for market. Canna and 
Ifle Muck might afford a furplus of crop to fupply the inha-

bitants of Rum. In the former iflands fuel 1, fcarcc ; in the' 
latter, mofs is plentiful. Indeed the people of flc Muck get 
a great part of the:r fuel, and fummer graf for ti«,r horles, 
in Rum, as a gratuity, during plcafure, from its proprietor 
to the proprietor of 111c Muck, who is a cadet of his tamlly. 
Some benefit may reiult to Canna from its harbour, which 
is much frequented by the trade from the Baltic and its 
neighbourhood. It might be cxpeded that Rum would 
largely ftare in this benefit, if its harbour was geiitrailf 
known 

The difadvantages of this parifh arc not few. In this ex- 
tcnfive parilh, confifting of fo many iflands, where the navi- 
gation is tedious and dangerous, efpecially to the iflands 
more remote from the clergyman's refidcnce j the diltance 
from the harbour of Eigg to the harbour of Canna, being 
computed 3.0 miles ; to that of Rum 16, and to that of ifle 
Muck, 6 miles : His attendance on each cannot be fo fre- 
quent, nor his labours fo beneficial, as their wants neceflariljr 
require. Notwithftanding his exertions, the people muft be 
liable to a fedudtion into a fuperftition, fubverfive of morali- 
ty and of genuine piety ; and the more fo, as its emiflarics, 
now tolerated by law, traffic among them without controul. 
Hence the neceflity of eftablifliing amiflion in two of thcfe 
iflands is thought evident. The want of fchools is another 
difadvantage. The ambulatory fchool, once eftablilhed in 
this parifh, by the Society in Scotland for Propagating Chrifl 
tian Knowledge, was removed in Suaimer lyya. Till fum- 
mer 1 793'} a parochial fchool was never obtained : It is now 
fixed in Eigg» a"d the only one in the parilh. From this 
fchool, children in the other iflands, efpecially the poorer 
fort, can derive no benefit. Ignorance muft be the confc- 
quence, and they may not only be an eafy prey to feduccrs, 
but woffc qualified to ait their part as ufeful membera of lo- 

ciety.

tory of Snrhngfh.re. informs us. that as early as .he ,4th

made m agriculture), the yearly feu duty paid to the Crown, 
cut of the parilh of Bothkennar alone, was no lels than 26 
•halders of visual. beOdcs 6 chalders pa.d to rhe Abb.cy of 
CaH,buiJccnncth.. About that time, or probably at a Uer 
pengd, the price of grain was fo very low, that the proprie- 
lors of land m the pariftes of Au-th and Bothkennar, had i( 
, IP thczr option, when paying the feu-duty, to pay either ^ 
mcrk Scotch or a boll of wheat. The former wi/ely chof^

Sterling. This parifh is almoft a continued flat ; there if

Whole of if, and not a ftonc to be fecn, unlefs brought from 
•ether places. Excepting the roads, there is not a fpot of 
ground uncultivated. The method of cultivation, the tim* 
of fowing and reaping, the wages of fervants, tjadcfmen, and 
day-labourers, the prices of coal, grain, and provifions, are 
'in general nearly the fame as in the parilhes pf Airth anjl

H„= referred. There are 12 orchards in tlA parim th^ 
of which is about 3 acres in extent. They produce 
chiefly appies and pears, and. in good fruit feafons, bnng the 
proprietors a plentiful return. 

Population, b-.-According to a lift of the inhabitants, 
taken by the prefent minifter in 1783, the number o foub 
was then about 730 but fince that t.me . has conhde.ably 
decreafed, owing, among other cauks, to the fl.ppmg hav- 
ing been, in a great n.ealure, removed from Carron fhore to. 
Grangemouth, on which account, feveral houles in this pa- 
rifh have been taken down, and others are left without in- 
habitants. In the year 1793 ^n^^her lift was taken, from 
xvhich it appears, that there are now only 144 faauhes, and 
in all about 6co inhabitants, of whom 303 are n,aks, and" 
297 females; 164 married, and 43^ unmarried; among" 
which laft, 45 are widowers and'vvidows, and 133 children 
below 10 years of age. The nun.ber of marriages, baptilms, 
and burials, for the laft 10 years, according to the parilli

There are 38 farmers, and about 86 fervants, 2 mafons,

and 1 fchoolmaftcr. The people, in general, attend the 
Eftabliflied Church; of thofe who do not, there are about 
9 Buruhers, an equal number who are connefted with the 
Relief cor.gregatiun in Falkirk, 8 Antiburghers, 2 Camero- 
nians, and 2 Epilcopalians. The inhabitants are, for the 
innft part, fober, induftrious, and kindly affe^ioned one to 
another, mviintaining a decent and becoming refpedt to the 
ordinances of religion ; whilft, among the few di/Tenters from 
the E'tabhlhfd Church, there is very little of that narrow 
bigotted f'jirir. for which the feftaries in other corners 
have been too frrquently blamed, 

Clifnaie, tsfc — Notwithftanding the low fituation, the cli-

Church. Manfe, e^^. -The church was rebuilt in a mo-

worftip, fufficient to accommodate 5 or 600 people eafdy. 
The manfe and office houfes are at prefent repa.rmg at a 
very confiderable expence. The glebe is about 4 acres of 
very sood land. The ftipend, partly in money, and partly 
iaviaual, is generally about xool. Sterling. TI.ere have 
been only 4 prefbyterian minifters in this parifh fince iLpil- 
copacy was abolifhed. The firft, viz. Mr Lindfay, after- 
wards tranflated to Perth, was fettled here in 1721-2 j was 
fucceeded by Mr Penman, in 1744; after him, Mr Nimmo, 
author of the Hittory of Stirlingfliire, was ordained in 1765. 
The prefent minifter was admitted in July 1783. The he- 
ritors are 22 in number, of whom only 10 refide within the 
bounds of the parifh. The principal are, Lord Dundas of 
Alke, Mr Ogilvie of Gairdoch, and the heirs of the late 
much relpeaed General Thomas Dundas of Carronhall, all 



Sfaii/Iical Accouni 

^^'^ patronage belongs to the 
^-1, of A,rth, who have always excrcifed that right in a 
-anner that does them the higheft honour. The late Mr 
Graham who had a particular pleafure in promoting the 
happmefs of thofe around him, (although not a member of 
the Eftablifhed Prefbyterian Church), was accuftcmed to in- 
dulge the people with the choice of their own paftors ; by 
domg fo, he obtained juft and univerfal efteem while he liv- 
ed, and on this account his memory will long be highly re- 
Ipedlcd. If other patrons were of the fame difpofition, the 
law of patronage, fo long complained of, would ceafe from 
being a grievance 5 and inftead of that frequent difcord and 
animofity, which are fo deftruaive to the civil and religious 
mterefls of our country, peace and harmony would every 
where prevail. 

School and Poor.^ThtTt is only one fchool in this parifh, 
at which 50 or 60 children are yearly taught Englifli, writ- 
ing, arithmetic, Latin, Greek, &amp;c. The fchoolmaflcr has a 
houfe and fmall garden. His falary is only 100 merks 
Scotch, which, together with voluntary contributions from 
fome of the heritors, his fchool wages, and perquifites as 
leffion-clerk, fcarcely exceed 20 1. Sterling per amium. It is 
much to be wifiied, that, in this age of liberality and im- 
provement, fomething were done for the encouragement of 
Ichoolmaftcrs, many of whom, having families to fupport, 
muft. often be flraitened to obtain even the necefTaries of life. 
—The poor in the parilh are not allowed to beg from door 
to door. The number upon the SefCon roll is at prefent 7, 
who receive a weekly allowance, befides a few who act oc- 
cafional fupply. They are fupported by the weekly collec- 
tions, with the intereft of 130 1. Sterling, which together 
amount at an average, for 10 years part, to 34 1. lo's. yearly.

Roads and Improvements. ■^'Y^t roads in this parilh, which 
old people reniember to have been once fcarcely paffable, 
are now in general good, unlefs for a fhort time during the 
winter, when the ground is very wet, or when covered with 
water, owing to the tide and land floods meeting together. 
Within thde few years, a confiderable extent of ground has 
been gained in this parifli and neighbourhood from the Frith, 
which, though defended at a great expence, will foon be- 
come a valuable acquifition to its pofleflbrs. There is a 
bridge foon to be built over the river Garron, a little above 
Grangemouth, and a new road to be carried from thence 
acrofs this parilli, towards Alloa and Stirling, which are 
likely to be of great advantage to the inhabitants, and will 
open a nearer and more agreeable communication both to the 
north and fouth.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q840684">WHITEBURN</name>

(County and Presbytery of Linlithgow ^Syno* 

OF Lothian and Tweedale.) 



Written in 



1793-</head>

<p>

Name. 

WHITEBURN, now commonly written and pronoun^* 
ced Wbithurn^ according to feme, took its name 
from a confiderable number of families, of the name of 
White, living along the fide of a bum or rivulet, which runs 
through great part of the parilh ; but more probably from 
being near another of the name of Blackburn^ 

Extent, — The parifli is about 6 miles long, and, at an ave- 
rage, between 2 and 3 broad. It is bounded, on the eaft, 
by Livingfton ; on the weft by Shotts, and part of Cambuf- 
nethan ; on the fouth, by Weft Calder j and on the north, 
by Bathgate and part of Shotts. 

Situation and Surface. — This parifli is in the county and 
prelbytery of Linlithgow, and {ynod of Lothian and Twee- 
dale. The foil is generally what may be called loam, 
inclining to clay ; and, in fome places, having a mixture of 
anofs, with a ftrong clay or till bottom. 



Towards 



of Whltehurn. '^99 

Towards the middle of the weft end, there Is a high ridge 
abouc two and a half miles long, and, in feme places, above a 
^ile broad, of very deep barren mofs. part of which how- 
ever, is known to contain a valuable Team of coal ; and pre- 
parations are now making to have it wrought. The lame 
Lm of coal has been wrought for above feventy years paft, 
at Burr,har. in the adjo.ning p,.i(h of Shotts and ftill con- 
tinues working •, having now approached within a few hun- 
dred yar.'s of the boundaries of Whiteburn parifh. The 
parUh ,s chiefly under rdiage a few black cattle being paf- 
tured upon particular fpots of almoft every farm. 

Climate and Difeafes,-The climate is damp and cold, 
though not unhealthy. Rheumatifm, flow nervous fevers, 
and confumptions, are, perhaps, the moft general difeafes. 
Inrtances of longevity are not unfrequent. Several perlons, 
within the laft 50 years, have died upwards of 90; and at 
prefent there are fome living between 80 and 90. The fmall- 
pox is not remarkably mortal 'here, though inoculation is 
extremely little in ufe. The few inftances, however, where 
it has been praftifed, have been always fuccefsful, no perfon 
in the parifli recolkaing a fatal experiment of this kind ; 
but ftill the prejudices of the common people are inveterate 
again ft this falutary pradlice. 

Jlivers. — Almond water runs through the north part of 
the parifti, and Breich water along the fouth fide of it. The 
canal propoled to be cut between Edinburgh and Glafgow, 
muft be carried through at leaft a part of the parifli. The 
whole parifli is well fupplied with good wholelbme water, 
from fprings in almoft every (],uarter of it. 

Hor/cs, 



-^"^^ Siatl/lical Account 

par^'^"' ^''^-There are about 200 horfes In the 

grounds have been moftly inclofed and tilled. A good ma- 
ny horfes and black cattle are bred for fale. 

P^«/../.«._The population of the pari/L is certainly in- 
creafed wirhin thefe 40 years In t„ • 
110, f., 1 T /X It amounted to 

12. fouls Laft year, when a pretty exacl account of the 
numbers of rhe parifh was taken, they were found to be 
1322 fouls. When the firft calculation was n.ade, there was 
no vdlage in the parifl. : At prefent there is a village, which 
conta,ns about 500 fouls. But the cot-houfes, which were 
.ormerly fcattered through the parifh, are now almoft all 
demo .fl.ed, and thofe who poffelTed them have removed to 
the village. A perfon who has refided long in a public fta- 
tion m the parifh, remarks, that not above a third part of 
the prefent heads of families are natives of the place. 

Extent of Farms.— Thtrt has been little alteration in the 
extent of farms for the laft 50 years. 

Births^ Deaths^ and Marnages.—The number of births 
cannot be given with precifion ; but they are computed

fome bury in Weft-Calder, and fome few in Livingfton 

The marriages are from 1 2 to 15 annually. A great propor-

Rent of the Parijj — The valued rent of the pnrifh is 
4244 I. 2S. I id. Scots; the real rent is about i8col. or 
2000 1. Sterling. The rent of farms is in general from 7 s. 6d.

Trades. — In the village there are 3 fhopkeeners. Within 
the pardh there are 20 weavers, who wotk chiefly for Glaf- 
gow aiid Lanark. About 50 young people, from y to 30 
years of age, arc fcniploycd in the floweripg of mullins for 
Glafgow, earning ufually about lod. or is. a day. in the 
village there is a cotton manufadtory, employing about 30 or

beginning of May. There is little more meal madd than 
what is ofed in the parifli, the farmers generally thinking it 
more advantageous to difpofe of their oats to the public- 
houfes in their neighbourhood. The oats produce from 9 
to 1 3 j)ecks of meal from the boll. Both fpring time and 
harveft are generally wet. 

Ecdefinjiical State of the PnriJJj —Thtre are thtee clergy- 
men in the parifli ; the miniiters of the Eftabllflied Church, 
of the Burgher, and of the Antiburgher congregations. To 
the EftabliOied Church there adheres about a third part of 
the parifh. To the Burgher congregation belongs by far 
the greater part of the remaining two thirds. Only a few 
individuals of this parifli belong to the Antiburgher congre- 
gation, the reft of its members coming from Weft Calder, 
and other parifties. 

Perhaps the following circumftances may, in fome mea- 
fure, at leaft, account for the great proportion of Seceders in 
this parilh. Whiteburn was formerly part of the parifti of 
Livingfton ; but was disjoined from it, and erected into a 
feparate parifh, anno 1730. The erc£lion was made in con- 
fequence of a fum of money having been raifed, by a volun- 
tary fubfcription over all Scotland, which, after building a 
chiirch and manfe, and purchafing ground for a glebe, was 
thought fufFicient, by its yearly produce, for the maintenance 
of a pariOi minifter. Several of the heritors were liberal in 
ful'fcribing, aclive in procuring fubfcriptions, and zealous in 
carrying on the procefs of erection before the Court of 
Teiuds, Irom entertaining the idea, that the minilkr was to 
be chofen by the parifh at large. The patron of Living- 
fton, however, was found, by the Floufc of Lords, to be. f.v 
neceffitate, patron of Winteburn, whicli lud been disjoined 
from it. And this gave fuch univerfal offence in the pn'ifli, 
as threw the greater part of it^ gradually, into the Secefllon. 

Another 



of Whiuhurn. 3^3 

Another circumn.nce farther increafcd the diffaiisfaaion of 
fome of the fmaller heritors, and their inclination to fccede. 
They Imagined, that the rent of certain lands in the panQ. 
of Shotts, which had been purchafed with the (ublcription 
money, was to be all the maintenance to which the,r m.ni- 
fterwastobe entitled: But this turned out to be by no 
means the caie ; for a few months after the decreet of pa- 
tronage by the Houfe of Lords, the minirter was preferred 
to 28 1. 6 s. .8 c". additional ftipend, out of ihe teinds of the 
parilh,*by the Lords Commlffioners of teinds for Scotland. 
The chagrin occafioned by thefe two circumftanccs conti- 
nues Hill fo ftrong, that not many, even of the mcft fcnfibla 
in the p.^r'fh, can talk with any degree of patience of patro- 
nage, or augmentation ot ftipends. 

Sir WiU-.am Auguftus Cunningham, Bart, is patron of the 
parilh. The prclent incumbent, Mr James RhinU, was ad- 
mitted min.fter of Whiteburn in 1790. His only predecef- 
fors were Mr Alexander Wardrobe, deceaied ; Dr Porteous 
of Giafgow; Proftffor Baron of St. Andrews; and Mr 
Sommervjlie -of Stirlmg, to the lall of whom he fucceedcd. 
He has been married about twelve months, and has one child. 
His income is 125 1. of ft.pend, and 3 1. 6 s. 8 d. of com- 
munion elements, which, with the man fe and glebe, may be 
eftimated in all at 140 1. per annum. Of the Ripend, ico 1, 
ai-ifes from a feu of two farms in the parifh of Shotts ; and 
the remainder is the augmented flipend. The church is a 
good, large building ; but (lands much in need of being re- 
paired. The manfe is an old, but tolerably good, houfe, and. 
in decent repair. 

Poor. — The number of poor upon the parifli roll is ufually 
about 10. They are maintained, at prefent,, by the col- 
ledtioos in the church, and by a voluntary fubfcription over 
the parilh, which dre diflributed by the fcffion, under the

Manners and Morals.— A tolerable degree of induftry pre. 
vails in the parish, and rhe morals of the people are as good 
as throughout the country at large. 

Advantages and Bifadvoniages,~ Y\x&amp; great difadvantagc. 
under which the parifh labours, is wetnefs in almoft all lea- 
fons, p Tticularly in feed-tune and harveft. Coals abound in 
the parifli, and are to be had both in it, and the ealt part of 
Shotts almotV adjouiing to it, at 6 d. per load, weighing two 
and a half, cwt. Lime is eafily driven from the neighbo ir- 
ing p;iriihes of Bathgate and Livingftone, .is the high ro. ds 
from Glafgow to Edinburgh, and from Borrowiiounnel.s to 
Cleugh, run through the pariih in oppofire directions. Frec- 
ftone quarries are open in feveral parts of the parifh. 

Edinburgh affords a ready market fo'- moli of the pro- 
duce of the farms, as calves, poultry, cheeie, and butter, 
which are bought up, and taken there by carriers. There 
3s alTo a confidevable traffic in ij ilk cows, to fupply the 
Edinburgh cow-feeders. The parifli and neighbourhood 
abounds with dealers in black cattle. Thel'e dealers, by re- 
quiring grafs parks to hold the catrle they have on hand, 
giv-e great encouragement to inclofing and planting. For 
fucb parks as are tolerably fenced and fheUered, thev pay 
from 155? to 25 P. p^r ncre. Many people in thr parifh 
make a I'velihood by keeping a horfe and curt, with which 
they drive gnin from Leith and Dalkeith to Glafgow, and 
often bring a load of pig-iron, in returning, from the iron 
works lately eftabliflicd in that neighbourhood.

G'afgow and Ayr Its centre is about S nrdles diftauffrom 
Gla.gow, and nearly -as far from Pa.fley Its lengrn, from 
caft to wf ft, is 6 miles, and i^s breadth about 34. It ftands 
high above the level of Clyde, There are no coofiJerai.le 
hills, in it, but the face of the ground .s beautifully diveifi- 
fit-d by a great variety of waving (wells. It rifes gradu-llj 
from the eaft extremity to the well, where the moor or com- 
monty lies. 

Soil and Produce.— Thz foil is all of a light and quick kind, 
Iving on a bed ot rotten rock, excepting lome fmall tracks in 
the lower part of tke parifh, v\hich have a clay bottom. It 
is chiefly remarkable for its fine pailure. It prod crs grafs 
both in greater quantity than common, and likcwiie ot the 
very beft kinds , and it every wh-^re abo'iU js with a profu- 
fion of white c!ovfr. The greater part :f he lands is in

vaftly greater than can be anfwered. It has nothing of that 
rancd t.fte, which butter made on deeper and heavier foils 
IS fometimes found to have ; and it keeps in good condition 
for a very long time. Potatoes are raifcd for domcftic ufe, 
and fome brrley and oats, but fcarcely (b much of the l.tter 
as can fupply the parifh. It is but a few years fince fown 
grafTes were introduced. Lefs attention, perhaps, than they 
deferve, have been paid to thcfe, on account of the great 
crops of natural grafs which tlic foil, in many places, is fitted 
to produce Two hundred 'ftone of this grafs is often raifed 
upon one acre; in fome particular fpots, 260, or even 280, 
and this, too, for a great fucceffirn of years. This natural 
grafs fells one penny, or three-h;Ufpence per ftone cheaper 
than the beft clover and rye-grafs. field turnips have hi- 
therto been fown only in fmall quantities. 

Cows.-Mo^ of the cows here are of a middle fize, and 
of a brown a-d white colour. They give from jo to 15 
Scotch pints of milk per day. Some of them, durmg the 
prime of the grafs, give 17 or 18 pints. There are not 
a few farmers, however, whofe cows, upon, an average, 
do not give above 8 Scotch pints per day. This is owmg to* 
their want of care to get a proper breed, and to their keep- 
ing more of them upon their ground than it is able fuffi. 
cicntly to pafture. Their cjucys, too, are much injured, by 
being kept in the Moor of Mearns, where they are only 
half fed; and from this circumfhnce, they never afterwards 
attain the fize, nor give the quantity of milk, which thofc 
cows do that have been reared with care at home.

jMoor -The commonty belonging to the heritors is about 
1600 acres in extent. It is always covered with the moft 
beautiful verdure, and produces very good grals and clove.-, 
without any heath or bent. Were k once divided, it would 
need nothing but Iheker and inclofing to render it extreme- 
ly valuable. At prcfent the heritors receive liule benefit 
from it, as it is under no proper management. ^^^'^J'l

about three miles in circumference, and abounds wiih char 
and trout. The other two, the Little Loch and the Black 
Loch, are of a fmallcr fize. Thefe lochs afford plentiful

of Mearns, 3^9 

Two bleachfields have been lately eftablifhed. One of 
thefe, at Wellmeadow, employs 13 men and 26 women. 
The other, at Broom, which has jufl: begun work this fum- 
mer, employs 11 men and eleven women. 

Church, Poor, and Sdool.-Sir Michael Stewart of Black- 
hall, Bart, is patron. Ihe Ihpend is 5 chalders of meal, 
and 271. 13^' Sterling of money. No augmentation has 
ever yet been demanded. The glebe confifts of about 4 
acres of arable land. A very good manfe was built in 1 789, 
and the church was fitted up in a very neat and commodious 
manner in 1792. There has long been an Antiburghec 
meeting houfe here. The congregation, which is not near 
io numerous now as formerly, is n.ade up of people belong- 
ing to this parifh, and to fome of the adjoining parifees. 
There are, likewife, in the pari(h, a few Burghers and Ca- 
ineronians. It is pleafant to lee the happy efFtdls of tolera- 
tion. Time has fottened the rancour ot party among thele 
feceders from the hftabiilhed Church, and almoft all of 
them live in good neighbourhood, and dilcover a Ipirit of 
Chriftian charity and moderation. 

There are but few po( r m the parifti. Thefe. are fupport- 
cd in the ufual way, by colle^:tions made at .the church, by 
the interell of a fmall accumulated fund, by the profits of 
the mort-cloth, and by the dues arifing from the publication 
of the banns of marriage. There are no begging poor be- 
longing to the parifli. 

There is a parochial fchoolmalter, who has a falary of 81. 
6 s. 8 d. Sterling, befides the ufual fmall fchool-fecs, and an 
allowance of 30 s. as fcffion clerk. There is the fame realon

P?/«/a/i^«.— From an accurate account taken in 1792, it 
appeared that there were in the parifli 1430 fouls at that 
time. Of males, 675— of females, 755.

According to Dr Webfter's account, in 1755, ^^t^ere were 
886 fouls in the parifli. 

The prefent very confiderable increafe of population, is 
chiefly owing to the introduction of manufactures, and to 
the addition of inhabitants to the village of Newton. This 
is the only village in the parifli, and it has of late increafed 
greatly. There are_at prefent 47 families in it. The moft 
of thefe are the families of tradefmen and common labourers. 

CharaBer of the People. ^The people of this parifli are fo- 
ber, induflrious, and oeconomical ; refpeclful to their fupe- 
riors, and uncommonly friendly and obliging. They are ra- 
tional in their religious fentimcnts, and moderate in their 
religious zeal. All of them are ftrongly attached to our 
prefent civil confl;itution, and cautioufly avoid giving coun- 
tenance to any change or innovation in it. It is happy for 
them, that they pretend not to make politics their fludj'. 
They mind the duties and bufinefs of their own ftation, and 
wifli to enjoy, with thankfulnefs and peace, the many blef- 
fings which a kind providence bellows on them. 



M'tfcellaneous Obfervaitous, — The only antiquity here is the 
Caftle of Mearns. It is a large fquare tower, fituated on a 

rocky 



^ Mearns* ' ^ T 



rocky eminence, and commanding an extenfive and beauti- 
ful profpea:. It is not known when it was built. It is fup- 
pofed to be feveral hundred years old, and to have been ufed 
as a place of defence, it was furrounded by a ftrong wall, 
and the entrance was fecured by a draw-bridge. It is now, 
however, greatly difmantled and out of repair, the family of 
Blackball, to whom it belongs, havmg their refidence at 
Ardgowan. 

The roads are in good condition, and the befl materials 
are every where at hand for making them. The great road 
from Glafgow to Kilmarnock runs through the whole length 
of the parifh ; as does alfo the road fronj Glalgow to Stewar- 
ton. The road from Paifley to Kilbride and Hamilton 
crofles the parifh from north to fouth. Tliere are alio oa- 
ny private roads. Thefe were formerly made and repaired 
by flatute labour, but an adl of Parliament is now pafled, for 
converting the ilatute labour of this county into money. 
There are no difeafes peculiar to this pariHi. Inoculation 
for the fmall-pox is gradually gaining ground. There is 
neither free-ftone, nor lime, nor coal in the parifh, but all 
thefe are to be had in plenty at no great dilkncc.

The population, In 1755' 

What accounts for this increafe of 71 is, the fettlement of 
a colony of Highlanders, who had been forced, to emigrate 
from Strathnaven, where their farms were converted mto 

llieep pafiure. . . , - 

Thefe people, it would appear, had been comfortaDly fi- 
tuated in their former refidence, as they all brought with 
them, to this place, a very confiderable flock in horfes, cows, 
flieep, and goats, and alfo in grain. As to all other proper- 
ty, every man of them might truly fay, Omnia mea mecunt 
porta. Their houfehold furniture mufl therefore be defcrib- 
ed negatively. No bed, no table, no chair. Thefe the 
Highlander does not reckon among the necelTaries of life, as 
he can make the earth ferve him for all the three. 

In his fhealing, compofed of earth and a few flicks, you 
find no other furniture than a few difhes for his milk, and a 
barrel for his meal : So true in faft, as well as philofophy, is 
the maxim, Natura contenta eft paucis.

It may be thought, perhap., that the horfes are valued 
too low i but the faa is otherwife. The horfes in this rfland 
are mferior in value to thofe of the main land and North 
Jfles. This is owing, probably, to the number reared in the 
ifland, and rhe lefs frequent renewal of the breed, from the 
horfes annually imported into this country from Strathnaver 
and Sutherland, as well as to the very different manner ia 
which they are maintained here and in the main-land. In 
the. latter, there is a great emulation among the farmers to 
have the beft horfes. Their horlcs are confequentiy fed at 
an extravagant expence, and thereby rendered of a better 
quality. 

The above ftatement of the flieep Is formed from a plan 
adopted about two years ago, by Mr Moodie of Mil/etter. 
According to this plan, the whole were converted into a 
common ftock, betwixt Mr Moodie himfelf, his tenants, and 
a fhepherd ; but the tenants not entering heartily into the 
fcheme, the bufinefs now refts almoft entirely betwixt Mr 
Moodie and the fhepherd. 

The trial is yet of too flaort a {landing to form any cer- 
tain judgment how far it may be fuccefsful, or other wife ; 
only this much already appears in its favour, that the fouth 
country flieep have agreed very well with the change of 
pafture. 

Until the above alteration took place, the number of 
flieep in the parifli was ulually about 2000, dilHnguiflied by

above 150 different marks ; and, being the property of the 
inhabitants in general, were left to range at random over 
the ifland. They were never houfed, nor one of them taken 
without a dog. They feparated themfelves into different 
flocks, and had their particular places of refort, the lame 
flock always frequenting the fame place. Evrry owner knew 
the marks and haunts, not only of his own flieep, but alfo, in 
general, thofe of all his neighbours ; lo that if any of them 
chanced to ftray into a new walk, they were foon difcovered, 
and their owners, without any trouble or expence, knew 
where to find them. 

Where fheep are fo wild as to be taken only by means of 
a dog, it might feem extremely difficult to take any particu- 
lar one out of a large number ; but thofe in the pradice of 
it can, in a. few minutes, take one of auy given defcription 
out of a thoufand. 

Sheepmen are commonly fworn to fidelity in their office'i 
and when a flieep is to be taken, one of thele fets out with 
his dog cloltf at his foot, or carrying him in his arms, that 
the flieep may allow him to approach near enough to difco- 
Ter the mark. This point gained, he advances more brilkly, 
when the flock begin to break and divide before him, and, 
in proportion as the divifion which carries with it the mark- 
ed one diminilhes its number, it incseafes in fear and fpeed. 
The man, no longer equal to the taflc, afligns it to his com- 
p^iion, by this time grown impatient to a£l his part. Such 
ftjeep as now happ^-n to be before the clog, begin prelcntly 
to break into new divifions, whilfl: the fheepman, keeping a 
fliarp eye on the obje£l: of his purfuit, diredls every motion 
of his dog by a different call, by the courfe he himfelf takes, 
or even by the waving of his hand j all which being readily 
underftood and obeyed by a well trained dog, the vidim is 
foon feized, and, for moft part, wuhout receiving any ma- 
terial

terial injury. The more fagacious flieep dogs trip them over by 
laying hold of one of their fore legs, and thereby effeflually 
prevents them from advancing a ftep farther. When the 
flieep finds himfelf thus overcome, he ceafes all further ef- 
fort, and lies almoft motionlefs at the feet of the do? until 
the flieepman lays hold of him. 

Climate — The Orkney Iflands, fituated at the extremity 
of the ifland of Great Britain, can only have a land breeze 
from two or three points foutherly. As the wind, in every 
other direction, comes from the German, Northern, or At- 
lantic oceans, it muft neceffarlly be damp and cold. That 
this is the cafe in Orkney, will appear from the following 
circumftance : Planting of wood has frequently been tried in 
different places in this illand, and always without fuccefs ; 
fo long as the plant is fheltered by furrounding houfes, or 
high walls, it will make progrefs ; but, where thefe are want- 
ing, it may indeed live, perhaps for ages, but will never be 
able to reach its natural perfedlion. A plant of a(h, for ex- 
ample, 3 feet in height, may, in the courie of 7 years, equal 
a wall of 6 feet high ; but it might ftand a century without 
gaining 3 feet more in height, or 3 inches more in diameter. 

^Agriculture. — The only kinds of grain ufually fown here 
are a fmall kind of bariey, and Imall grey oats. Now and 
then, a few people, by way of trial, fow white oats and pcafe, 
an experiment that has been tried repeatedly for generations 
paft, and which every new comer from tlie fouth country may 
perhaps repeat for generations to come ; but of which the 
advantage will never be fo apparent as to bring it into gene- 
ral practice. 

It may be allced, What fhould hinder white oats from

aiion, the foil, the feafon, and the climate, are unfavourable 
to them. Thefc yield very little to art 5 it therefore be- 
comes the bufinefs of art to adapt herlelf to them, h is for 
this rcafon that the farmers in this county do not begin 
their oat feed till the beginmng or middle of April j nor 
their bear feed, till the beginning or middle of May, the 
feafons when the one and the other are ufually over in the 
fouth of Scotland. Not that the farmers here are not equal- 
ly aware, as their neighbours, of the danger of a late harvellj 
but that their experience convinces them no lels of the dan- 
ger of too early ajeed time. 

It muft not, however, be denied, that the improvements 
which might be niade here, by inclohng, fallowujg, and 
green crops, have been hitherto too much ncrgktted. 

Churches y Manfe^ The church of Walls formerly 

flood at the Kirkhope, but is now m a more centrical litua- 
tion, on the louth lide of the Loughope It was built aDout 
the year 1743, and ialt year was thoroughly repaired, it is 
rather fmall for the parifh. but cojnmodioufly contrived and 
well feated. The church of Flota had ftoou tor many years 
without a roof ; but, about 1 2 years a^o, it was roofed in, 
being thatched with heather, and furniihed with new Icats 
and new windows. 

The manle was built in 1782, not where it formerly ftood, 
and where the glebe Itiil is, on the top of the Hili of Fea 
on the fouth fide, but on the north lide of Longnopc, al- 
moft oppofite to the church. Tae former fituation, i;» point 
of profpea, drynefs of its liance, and convenience in being 
near the church, as well as in lome other relpedts, was far 
preferable to the prefcnt. But in a co ntry where there are 
few days, even in fummer, that a fire can be dil^.enlcd with, 
the article of fuel comes to be a matter of material confc-

manfeon the north fide, where there is peat ground in abun- 
dance, and very near, rather than where it formerly was, with 
the above advantages, btit with the difadvantage of carrying 
peats from a confiderable diftance, both by land and water'^ 
with much trouble, and at a confiderable expence. 

When the prelent manfe was built, it was likewife inten- 
ded to excamb the glebe ; and it was in great forvvardnefs to 
be accomplilhed, when fome eledtion punftilio put a flop to 
it. Mr Moodie of Melfetter, on whole property the manfe 
iiands, fliU propofes to complete the excambion, to which 
the prefent incumbent is ready to accede, being perfuaded 
that it would be for the intereft of his fucceflbrs, as well as 
for his own. 

The prelent rent of the glebe is 5 1. 1 1 s. in money ; and 
the tenant has lately had a imall croft, formerly let to a cot- 
tar, given him without any additional rent. The glebe was 
much injured in the laft incumbent's * time, by a planking 
which never was authoriled by his prefbyteryj but, as the

Produce. — The quantity of kelp made yearly is about 80 
tons, and cofts from i 1. 5 s. to i 1. lo s. per ton of 24 cwt. 
for burning. About 20 years ago, for the fame quantity, 
the prices were only from 15 s. to 20 s. or, on the very worft 
fhores, i 1. is. 

Pi^j, The cod fifhing here is extremely precarious ; the 

fifh being Tome feafons remarkably plenty, and at others 
equally fcarce. At iome periods, for months together, there 
will not be fo many fifli caught in a boat, as, on a divifion, 
to be a fifli for each man. At other periods, on the fame 
ground, and in the fame fpace of time, the boars will be 
loaded as deep as they can fwim. From 50,000 to 70,000 
cod have been often cured here in one feafon. 

When the fifhing is good, there may be about i2 boats, 
with 6 men each, that ufually follow that bufinefs; at other 
times, about half that number follow it occafionally. Everv 
cod, meafuring 14 inches and upwards, from the Ihouider 
fin to that next the tail, cofts 2 d. All under 14 inches to 
1 1 inches coft i d. each. 

The lobfter fifliing is carried on in Orkney by about 60 
boats, with only two men to each boat. At an average 
they may catch about 2000 lobfters to each boat, making 
annually from 100,000 to 120,000 fifh, at r^d. each. The 
number of boats have been conftantly increafing for thefe 
feveral years paft, and are flill increafing; but it is not like- 
ly that the number of mi caught will be thereby increaied : 
For it is found by experience, that all the fifh on any parti- 
cular fpot are fpon picked up, and that, at the end of a fiQi- 
ing (ealbn, they become very fcarce every where. 

P..r._The number of poor in the parifla is, in ordinary, 
about 20. The annual colleaions feldom exceed 3!. I'o s.

This is totally insflequate to their fupport; but the charity 
of the parHh nor to be eftimated by the trifle contributed 
in nrioney. i he r^eople are far from being deficient in this 
virtue ; tnany of them poflefs it in a confiderable degree, 
and exercife it liberally in proportion to their abilities. They 
occafionally fend fupplies of the neceflaries of life to the 
nbodes of the neceffitous ; and if, at any time, this fupply 
fails, the latter make an occafional tour, and the intention 
of the vifit is perteftiy underllood. The charitable knovr 
the neceffitous, and the neceffitous know equally well the 
charitable. If there be any who are unable to travel, their 
cafe is always particularly attended to. When the prefcnt 
incumbent firft underltood how trifling the funds were, and 
the dcftijute and helplels condition of feme of the poor, he 
was much concerned to thmk of the mifery to which fome 
of them might fometimes be reduced ; but was no lefs pleaf- 
ed to be informed, that there exifted here a fpontaneous 
mode of charity, founded on the principles of nature and 
duty, equal in hs effeds to any political inftitution what- 
ever, 

CharaBer. — The people are very peaceable and inoffenfivc, 
Jipviarently very fimple but infant abundantly fhrewd. Their 
addrefs is without embarrafllnent or rudenefs, but not with- 
out a degree of politeneis and good manners, though fome- 
times an affectation of refinement in the laft, makes it ridi. 
culous. What has been faid of their charity, may ferve as a 
criterion ot their fenfe of religious obligation. Being ftran- 
gcrs to all the different opinions of fed-iries, they are Aran- 
gers alfo to thfe vain difputations, violent diffentions, and 
flrifes about words, fo frequently to be met with m other

Their attendance at church, and on all religious ordi- 
Bances. is punOual ; and their fervices are performed with 
all that outward leriouCners and folemnity, that ufually indi- 
eate the inward fincerity of the heart. 

5;W..~-Ember geefe are plenty here in winter, but, being 
birds of p'^flage, they dilappear in (pring, and do not return 
till the end of harveft. How this bird hatches its young, re- 
mains a profound fecret, both as to the manner and the 
place. That it fhould be in either of the ways commonly 
fuppofed, under its wings, or in the fands, are conjedures 
attended with many difficulties, that render both very im- 
probable. But that they do not breed any where here-abouts 
is certain, as their eggs are never found here, nor their young, 

till fully grown. 

This bird is alfo remarkable for its ftrong ftruaure of bo- 
iy ; 'for though confiderably lefs in fize than the common 
grey goofe, it weighs a great deal more. They fomctimes 
weigh 18 pounds. It is never feen on the land ; and though 
it has pretty large wings, it is never feen to fly. Every wa- 
ter fowl takes the affillance of its feet to raife itfelf out of 
the water, when k is going to fly ; but the feet of this bird 
are fo much in a right line with its body, that they can 
never be brought far enough forward to affifl: it in rifing out 
of the water. Nor docs nature feem to have intended that 
it ever fhould fly ; for in whatever manner it is attacked, 
purfued, or fuddenly furprifed, it always has recourfe to div- 
ing for its fafety. Being a bird of paffage, it differs from all 
others, in preferring, on that occafion, the medium of water 
to that of air ; and as it makes its way, probably with equal 
fpeed, by means of its wings, (for fea fowls are frequently 
feen ufing their wings under water), fo it accompUfhcs it 
with equal certainty,

Stamical Account 

The lyar bird is .ot peculiar to this ifland, but abounds 
far mor. here than in other place, of the country. The food 
Of th,s b,rd is nor known ; only bv irs being web-footed, and 
leen always flying and hovering over the Tea. there can be no 
doubt but that, in Tom. fhape or orher, it derives its fubfiftcnce 
from that element. The ftomnchs of the young ones do 
not ferve to ascertain their food ; they contain nothing but 
a thm oily fubflance which flows readily by the bill, when 
they are hung by the feet. 

This bird n.akes its neft, by digging a hole horizontally 
m the loofe earth, found among the fl^elvings of high rocks 
The holes are commonly of that width and depth, that ' 
man's hand and arm can reach the birds, of which 'there 
only one in each hole. One of them mav weigh nearly a 
pound weight, and is fo fat, that one half of it will run to an 
oil. Some reckon it the moft delicious morfel in the world, 
and others the moft deteftable. * 
Whether the lyar, or lyar catcher, be the greateft curiofi- 
ty, I fliall leave the reader to judge. The former, as if in- 
ftin^ively warned of the adventurous boldncfs of the latter, 
chufes a retreat for hatching its young, feemingly perfeaiy 
inaccefllble to every creature not furnifhed with wings. 
Rocks perpendicular, or fomctimes projeaing far beyond 
their bafe, and in height from 1000 to 1300 feet, promife 
the defired fecurity bat in vain. The lyar- catcher fwings 
hinifeif over by means of a rope, and lowers himfelf, or is 
lowered down by his afilftants, who hold the rope, till he 
reaches his intended {Ration. He then crawls, and clings, 
and climbs, till he has taken every lyar in that quarter. In 
purfuit of the fame game, he fometinnes, by a fecond rope, 
/nakcs a fecond defcent ftill farther down the precipice. In 
this lafl: ftation, he may have 500 feet perpendicular rock 
over his head, and 700 or 800 feet below, him, hanging over

the ocean; yet fuch is the love of fame, of feme fort 
or other, or fuch the difference of human conftitutions, 
that the adventurer repeats here his manoeuvres, with the 
greateft feeming unconcern. And indeed his unconcern 
mud be real ; for if he fhould once begin to fhrink or ihudp 
der at his awful fuuation, he would loon tumble headlong, 
to the bottom, an event that fometimes, though but rarely, 
happens. Having colledled his prey, he adjufts it to his 
fhoulders and back, taking care that it may not incommode 
him in climbing. He then returns, and climbing where he 
can, and affifled by his rope where he cannot, he regains 
the fummit, bringing with him the value of only a few ihil- 
lings in his moft fuccefsful adventure. 

Em'tmnt Men. — The only perfon born in this parifh, 
whofe merits claim a place here, was ComnioJore jai..es

ing run off from fchool, entered himlelf on board a man of 
war, where his good condndt gradually advanced him to the 
rank of a commodore, in the lervice of her Majelly Queen 
Anne. How well his fervices were received, and how much 
he was refpcdted, may befl appear from the following letter, 
written by Charles 111. King of Spain, to her Majefty Queen 
Anne.

Stiuaiion, Name, and Extent. 

IT is bounded on the weft by the parifh of Urray ; on the 
north by a range of common, dividing it from Ferrin- 
tolh ; on the eaft by Kilmuir Wefter and Suddy ; and on 
the fouth by the Frith of Beauiy, along which it is plea- 
fantl/ fituated. 

The origin of the name is uncertain. Tradition make? 
the burying ground, which gives it to the parifii, to be that 
of Irenan^ a Daniih prince, who fell in battle on its confines, 
where cairn Irenan ftiU cxifts. The greateft length, from 
north-weft to fouth eaft is about 5 miles, and the greateft 
breadth about 2. It is wholly the property of two refiding 
heritors, Mr Grant of RedcalUe, and Mr M'Kenzie of Kil- 
coy. 

^o'll. — In this there is a confiderable variety. Light loam, 
gravel, and deep blue clay, are to be found on the fame farm. 
Some fields are covered with Imall ftones in remarkable a- 
bundance; 100 cart loads have been thrown off an acre, j'et 
on the next plowing, a fimilar fource of amufement has pre- 
fented itlelf to the farmer. A confiderable track covers a.

33^ Siaii/lical Account 

remarkably thick ftratum of reddift free-ftonc, which ex- 
tends almoft due north to the Frith of Dingwall. It is eaC- 
ly hewn. and. when properly fekaed, very eligible for build- 
ings of any defcription. 

Several fmall veins of wilks, and other fliells, are found. 
, There is neither marie nor lime-ftone ; nor have the efFeas 
of either (with very immaterial exception) been hitherto tried 
on the foil. This will lead the reader to infer, that the 
ftate of 

Agricultural Improvement is backward in the extreme. Of 
this a juft idea will be formed, when it is mentioned, that al- 
though about 2000 acres are in culture, there is not a two 
horfe plough in the parift, and very few, iron included, 
worth above fix or feven HHllings, thofecf .the proprietors 
excepted. The farms are almoft entirely under a conftant 
fucceffion of corn crops, barley and oats alternately, a very 
fmall extent being altogether for peafc, and an inconfider- 
able proportion, which exhaufts a large (hare of the manure 
of the year, appropriated for potatoes. The farmers have 
no inclofures, and of courfe confider the vicinity of any as 
an intolerable grievance, fo that their fields from autumn, 
until the briar appears in April, are one undiftinguifhed 
common, through which horfes, oxen, and fheep range pro- 
mifcuoufly. 

To a perfon unacquainted with the circumfi^ances of the 
country, this ftatement will appear unaccountable ; he will 
look on the inhabitants as labouring under obftinate preju- 
dices, or ftupidly incapable of learning the beneficial fyf- 
tems of others ; but to neither of thefe caufes is it to be at- 
tributed ; ly?, The proprietors do not appear to have looked 
on the introduftion of the modern fyftem of farnjing, as an cb- 
jeft adequate to (what they conceived) the unpleafant neccfllty 
of granting long Icafes, to the tax on their properties of an in- 

creafci

ci-eafed melioration, as well as the inducement which they 
would probably require to hold out to improving tenants ia 
a diminution of the rent. No man of this defcnption can 
commence his operations on a proper kale, without a capital 
equal to at leaft 5 years rent, for reafons obvious to every 
peribn in any mealure acquainted with hu£bandry j and no 
man, who is in poffcffion of a capital to this extent, will be 
induced to take a farm, unlefs he can have the proipca of a 
comfortable maintenance, and full melioration tor nis expen- 
diture in building and improvements. The rent that can be 
afforded by fuch a farmer muft of courfe be proportionally 
low, as the fum which he advances on entering, as the value 
of his flocking, (fay the neceffary horfes, farming utcnfils^ 
gtc), together with the probable requifite expenditure, are 
high ; becaufe he has to add the annual interelt of taele, be- 
ing at leaft 8 per cent, to his rent. It is therefore evident, 
that the difference betwixt the value of melioration, expen- 
diture, and flocking, necefTary for the preient mode of con- 
ducting hufbandry, and the value of thoie as requilite for 
the effedlual introduction of the more generally approved 
fyftcm, muft be altogether againft the proprietors. This 
difference is very confiderable. 

Let us view both in a few particulars, as in their probable 
confequences affeCling the lands in this parilh. l^irft, By 
the preient fyftem of farming, it is believed that the full 
melioration does not exceed two-thirds of the rent, lay, (for 
the fake of even numbers) 1400I. the intereft of which is an 
annual tax. on the different properties of 70 1. But by the 
modern fyftem, 3 years rent for melioration will be requilite, 
fay 6300 1. raifing the tax to 315 \, per annum. 

Farther, by the prefent fyftem, the different operations of 
huftDandry are principally carried on by oxen. Horfes are 
(I believe with very few exceptions) ufed for conducting the

modern fyftem. Suppofc that 200 horfes may be able to la- 
bour what is now done by 600 oxen. Suppofe the value of 
the neceffary ftocking to be thus mnch the fame, calculating 
each pair of horfes as equal in value to 6 oxen, fay 24 1, which", 
for the above number, fuppofed neceffary for the purpofe of

twhich in this parlfli would be near 40 per cent, of the rent. 

Add to thefe, the very material difference in the expen- 
diture for farming utenfils, manures, and improvements, the 
material deficiency in the article of manure, together with 
the prodigious public lofs *, which would refult from the uni^ 
verfal adoption of the modern plan of ufing horfes infteacl 
©f oxen. 

Thefe circumftances fhew, that the introduflion of the 
more approved plans of hufbandry would not, in a pecunia- 
ry view, be fo advantageous to the proprietors as might at 
firft be imagined. And indeed it is a well known fait, that 
very diftant as farms in this part ot the country molt un- 
queftionably are from improvement, yet that from the incon- 
fiderablc neceffary expence of an mtrant tenant, the average 
rent of iome of them equals that ot ioiue in the county of 
Effex. 

But other circumftances have contributed to that back- 
wardnefs in agricultural improvement, too evident in this

confiders the enthufiafm that leads ,0 it. and it w,ll rivet his 
prejudices againft improvement. 

An M^entaaual farmer, whofe bread depends upon 
his induftry, and who is little removed from their own fphere 
m hfe, (the Hugh Reoch, mentioned in the very ingenious 
ftatiftical account of Alloa), is the man who will moft effen- 
tially contribute to introduce an alteration of fyftem, and a 
fpirit of improvement into any diftricl. His neighbours will 
obferve, and are, in very few inftances, fo blind to their in- 
tereft, as if able, not to imitate his exertions. 

But the agricultural ftate of this parifli will farther be ac 
counted for, when it is mentioned, that leafes are, with very 
few exceptions, unknown. The farms on the moft confi 
derable property have for many years been held only from 
year to year. The longeft leafe recollefted, with the excep. 
tion of the life-rent of one fmall farm, is lo years, and very 
few have exceeded 5. What inducement does this prefent 
for improvement ? How can that man embark in any plan 
for ameliorating his farm, who knows that he only hangs 
out a bait for the grafp of avarice, and that ingenuity and 
induftry tend only to ruin him ? It is to be hoped that the 
more enlightened policy of the fouthern counties will foon 
be more generally adopted in ours, and that the proprietors 
\vill delight in receiving " the blefmg of them that are ready 
" to perifhi" the juft rcconipence gratefully paid to the lord 
of their manor, by induftrious, flouriOiing, ufeful members 
of fociety, and accompanied, let it not be thought of little 
ralue, by their prayer for his enjoying the bleffing of the

%ord. of lords. From the above ftatement it will be infer- 
red, and with juftice, that the farmers in this parifh, and in* 
deed throughout this country, are, in general, poor; fo nauch 
fo, that although kales fliould be granted, it would take 
fome confiderable time before they poffibly could adopt aa 
improved lyikm of hufbandry. What ! will a mere theorift 
in farming exclaim. Is not one fyftem of hufbandry as eafily 
followed as another ? " Does not the modern fyftem require 
fewer {ervants, and lefs feed ; and does it not yield more 
luxuriant crops ? Let ail thele be granted ; but what this rea- 
foning is to a poor tenant, the following fads will tend to 11- 
luftrate. By the prelent fyftem, it requires the utmoft ex- 
ertion of his induftry, and an almoft uninterrupted fuccef- 
fion of crops, to pay his rent and lervants, and afford a 
maintenance, ver^ fiber indeed, to his family. It may be af- 
firmed, that on a farm of 30 acres, 2 1. per annum has not 
been cleared, at an average, by any one farmer, for 20 years, 
by farming alone. Let us fuppofe a man in this predicament, 
from obfervirg the fuccefs of others, anxious to lay a fifth 
part under grafs, fay 6 acres i before he can poffibly do this 
an inclofure is neceffary, which, if built by the proprietor, 
exhaufts, by the payment of 7^- per cent, intereft, the fuppo- 
fed, or rather real average, profit. Let him, however, per- 
fevere to manure this properly, he ftarves the reft of his 
farm. 

The grafs is notwithftanding fown at an extra expence of 
20 s. per acre, and cut the fecond year ; but when he calcu- 
lates profit and lofs, he finds a deficiency of 24 bolls, the 
ufual average produce of 6 acres ; the fame the fecond year 
of the improving a^ra, 48 bolls and 61. } fb that before he 
can experience the benefit of a grafs crop, his corn yard

of all reafons, becaufe he has no market. This is not mere 
theory, it is founded on faft ; and the cirtumllances are 
mentioned merely for the purpofe of pointing out to Ipecu- 
latifts in farming the almoft infurmountable difficulties which 
muft be encountered by poor men, whofe backwardnefs in 
ameliorating their farms, they are too often difpoied to 
afcribe to ignorance, indolence, and obftiriacy. 

Let not the generous heart, therefore, load them with in- 
vedlive, or treat them with feverity, for thinking once and 
again before they enter on meafures which, however fenfible 
they may be of their good efFedts when perfevered in, may 
eventually prove their ruin. To the benevolent mind, on 
the contrary, it will aflFord pleafure gradually to lay open to 
their view what may be moft conducive to their benefit, to 
llimulate their exertions by fuitable encouragement, and to 
fee them contented and happy in the pofl'effion of thofe 
comforts which are fuited to their fphere in life. To this 
mode of condu£l, it is to be hoped, that the farmers in this 
parifh may have the comfort of looking forward. It is with 
much pleafure mentioned, that the prefent proprietors offer 
premiums to encourage the induftrious ; pay the expence of 
fmall temporary inclofures, to enable them to experience the 
utility of fown graffes ; and allow melioration for comfortable 
houfes. A number of farms have undergone judicious dl- 
vifions of from 20 to 60 acres each. Cuftoms and carriages 
have been converted ; run ridges have been aboliftjed ; and, 
it is not doubted, that proper leafes will be given to thofe 
who difcover a wifh to improve. Nor will they experience 
that this treatment of their inferiors will run in oppofition 
to their intereft. The above mentioned divifion of the farms 
they will find particularly beneficial. From the too preva- 
lent praftice of uniting fmall farms, it is conftfied that a 
proprietor may have his rents coUedled with fomewhat lefs

trouble, and his property maybe brought with more rapidity 
to its utmoft value ; but this plan is certainly objeaionable 
for two reafons of indifputable importance, ly?, Suppofe 
the mode of farming the fame, it is clear that the occupier 
of 30 acres, being the aBual labourer^ is able to pay a higher 
rent than can be afforded by thole who employ fervants at 
extravagant wages, and are often, through their negligence 
or villainy, expol'ed to impofition and confiderable lolTes. 
The different operations of hufbandry are performed oa 
farms of this extent, not by the carelefs menial, but by the 
united exertions of a family, happy in themfelves, and each 
feeling an iiitereft in adling his part. But, ^dly^ In a na- 
tional view, the coniolidation of farms is ftill more ferioufly 
objcdtionable. Its cffe£ is immediate depopulation. It com- 
pels the poor aborigines^ " Patriae fines et dulcia Imquere 
** arva" to emigrate, friendlels and unprotected, to other 
countries ; or to crowd into towns, with the view of grafp- 
ing at the cafual lources of earning their pittance, which 
may occur.

lation betwixt the years 1755, (when the return was made 
to Dr Webfter), and 1795, it is neceffary to obferve, that its 
boundaries have undergone confiderable alterations, in con- 
fequcnce of a decreet of the Court of Tcinds, pafTed in the 
1756, annexing the neighbouring parifh of Suddy to thofc 
of Killearnan and Kilmuir Wefter. The moft accurate me- 
thod will therefore be, to compare the returns of the three

It is much to be regretted that the pr.ce of ardent fpr.ts 
has not rifen in this part of the country, in proportion to 
the advance of tax. The diftiUers having in general no ca- 
pital, are frequently under a neceflity of felling the.r wh.lky 
at a confiderable difadvantage and the number v.ho are 
thus fituated, fupply our confined market fo abundantly, 
that thofe who are pofl^effed of capitals cannot avail them- 
lelves of them by a retention of the commod.ty, until the 
advance in price ftiould yield a reafonable profit. Of conle- 
quence, while barley fells, as it now does, at a guinea per 
boll, the price of the gallon is only 3 s. and it is a.^ually re- 
tailed in our dram houfes at 3 s. 8 d. which is no more than 
it fold for before the laft additional 50 per cent, was levied 
on each ftiU. Hence it is evident, that that tax has no effca 
in rendering fpirits more inacceflible to the lower ranks, and 
that it is principally, if not altogether, paid by the diftiller 
out of his profits, not by the conlumer ; haw far he is able 
to afford this will be feen thus: The quantity of barley al- 
lowed to be diftilled by each poffeffor of a 30 gallon ftill, is

The average produce of each 4 bolls is highly rated at 9

The refufe for cattle may be worth 5 s. which is in faft the 
only profit to be derived from diftilling in this country. 

It will be alked, Why then fo many diftilleries ? For thefe 
reafons : Diftilling is almoft the only msthod of converting 
our vidlual into cafli for the payment of rent and fervants; and 
whilky may, in fa£t, be called our ftaplc commodity. The 
diftillers do not lay the proper value on their time and 
trouble, and of courfe look on all, but the price of the barley 
and fire added to the tax, as clear profit ; add to thefe the 
luxury of tailing the quality of the manufafture during the 
procefs. 

A very beneficial alteration in the diftillery law would be 
a more frequent renewal of licences fuppofe 6 months in- 
ftead of 12. As it now exifts, the diftiller becomes bound 
for 45 1- for a 30 gallon ftill, from the ift December to the 
ift December, let the prices of barley and Ijpirits be what 
they may ; of courfe, he is under the necelSty of continuing 
to diftil, however exorbitant the firft, or cheap the laft. This 
has two bad conffqucnces, when a crop is unprodudlive, it 
raifes the price of meal on the one hand, and renders 
fpirits a dangerous dr;ig on the other. The above alteration,

without Injuring the revenue % would, in a great meafure, 
prevent both. The price of fpirits would find Us level m 
proportion to that of gr.in, and the mean of intoxication 
would not offer itfelf to the lower ranks, with fuch permcious 
facility as it now does in confequence of a glutted market. 

" Fuel-i:ht only firing in this parifh is a yellow fpongy

pared off the common. Newcaftle coals are ufed by thofe 
who can afford the outlay of cafii, together with burn wood 
and peats, fubjeding luch a family as the incumbent's, for a 
fire in a room and a kitchen, and occafionaliy in bed rooms, 
to an annual heavy expence of from lo to 14 +^ 

Several circumftances indicating the exiftence of coals have 
occurred in different parts of this country ; but a peculiar 
difadvantage which prevents dilcoveries of this kind, is, that 
the perfons who are beft qualified to make them, and who 
are of courfe employed, arc, in general, notorioufly interefted 
in crufhing the attempt. Until fome man of Ikill and ipirit 
fhall be induced, by a participation of the profits, or other- 
, wife, to make proper experiments, we (hall probably remain 
as we are, in the want of this very eflential comfort of life.

To Mr Grant of Redcaftle the fucceeding gcnerition will be 
much indebted for his extenfive plantations of oak, larch, 
planetree, afh, elm, and Scotch fir, fenced by at leaft 20,000 
yards of an inclofure but, however great the exertions of in- 
dividuals may be, a bar has hitherto prefented itfelf to the 
general improvement of the country, in an extent of unap- 
propriated muir, perhaps the moft confiderable in Great Bri- 
tain. It is lamentable to obferve, that the peninfula formed 
by the Friths of Beauly and Dingwall, (commonly defigned 
the Black Ilk) contains, it is believed, from 30 to 40 fquare 
n'iiles, abundantly capable of improvement by agriculture or 
planting, which ftill continued in their natural ftate, not 
Viforth one penny per acre, yet a continual fource of jealoufy 
betwixt the conterminous proprietors. It Is the more fo, as 
the propriety of a divifion is admitted on all hands as the 
power of the Court of SefTiOn, under the act 1695, to carry 
it into effefl is undoubted, and as nothing is wanting but co- 
operation. 

Some of the proprietors are now induced to look to the 
well known philanthrophy of the Agricultural Board, for 
that ciieftual interference for carrying this very deiirable ob- 
jca.into efl.l'ft, which might prove tedious, vexatious, and 
irkfome, to any private individual. It would be an objeft 
highly deferving of their attention, which, without fubjeaing

poor of this parifh were given to the late proprietor of Red- 
caftle on perfonal fecurity ; his property was fequeftrated, 
and judicially fold, anno 1789 ; and while thefe creditors 
who had heritable bonds were all paid, principal and intereft 
and luch as accepted of them, liquidated penalties, the wido J 
and orphan have not, for many years, - received a penny of 
either, and are now involved in a procefs of ranking, of whicli 
the terniination and refult are yet uncertain. 

The poor of the two neighbouring parifhes are in the fame 
predicament, which is mentioned as a caveat againft over- 
ftrained delicacy in the requifition of" proper fecurity, by all 
who are intrufted with the management of public funds ; 
and particularly by thofe who ad for the indigent and the 
dcftitute. 

The number of itinerant poor has undergone a very plcaf- 
ing decreafe of late, by the introduaion of a branch of the 
Invernefs hemp manufactory. 

An agent diltributes hemp to be fpun for faiUcloth, and 
pack-fheeting, furnifhing an eafy employment even to the 
aged and infirm, by which they can earn from 2i-d. to 6 d. 
per day. What renders this of peculiar utility to them is, 
that as they are not reftricled in time, it does not prevent 
their attention to other necefTary bufinefs ; they can occupy, 
in fpinning, thofe hoprs which would otherwife pafs in idle- 
nefs ; and a ftimulus to exertion is found in immediate pay- 
ment on performing their engagements with fidchty. 

Manners of the People. — Thefe have, during the currency of 
the lafl: 40 years, undergone a very plcafing alteration. The ' 
generality of the inhabitants were then ignorant in the ex-

Heal eftablifhments. As a ftriking inftance of this the fol. 
Iwing circumftance is mentioned : The late encumbent .a, 
fettled minifter of this parifh in May iTSS; he, 8 months 
thereafter, pnblicly intimated, .fter lermon, h. mtenuon of 
catechiiing the inhabitants of a particular diflr.a on the fol- 
lowing rueld.y ; but, on going to the houfe wh.ch he had fixed 
on as the place of meeting, not above three mdes from the 
church, he found a convention of only a few old women 
Having never before feen their ininifter they appeared much 
aoitated, telling him, however, that he might have faved 
hlmfelf the trouble of coming to their town as they had no 
whifky. They retired, one by one, and alarmed the neigh- 
bonrhood, by faying, that a ftrange Excifemanhad juft come 
to luch a houfe. Since that period the change is ftnkmg 
the affiduity of the minifter, in the difch.rge of his parochial 
duties, was attended with much fuccefs ; his exertions were, 
as he has often gratefully acknowledged, powerfully aided by 
the introdudion of a * fchool, (fupported by the Society for 
Propagating Chrii^ian Knowledge), at which from 60 to 90 
children have been taught gratis. The houfe of God is now 
attended with regularity and devotion •, they have learned, 
not indeed the cheaflefs refinements of modern Philofophy. 
but in the perufal of the gofpel ot peace, to find a healing 
balm to footh and to comfort them under the preffure of all 
the calamities of life. 

May they increafe in thofe virtues which are pure, peace- 
able, gentle, of good report, and eafy to be intreated ! 

* The very inadequate falary payable to the parochial 
fchoolmafter is much againft the parifh ; it is only 8 1. 6 s. 8 d. 
The office of fchoolmafter has been vacant fmce Martinmas, be- 
caufe no qualified perfon can be got to accept of it. What a 
pity is it that the pecuniary reward of a defcription of men, 
among the moft. uftful in fociety, fhould exceed only, in a mere 
Uifle, the wages of a common hireling.

' Geography and Natural Hi/lory. 

THE anclept name is Bocharin ; in the original fignify- 
ing the bow about the cairn, or rocky hill, from its 
furrounding nearly three parts of the bottom of the moun- 
tain of Beneageen. The length, between the parifli of Mort- 
lich, at the weft, and the pariflrof Bellie, at the eaft, is from 
7 to 9 Englifli miles ; the breadth, from the parifh of Bo- 
triphnie, at the fouth, to the higheft cultivated land on the 
mountain, northward, is from 2 to 3 Englifh miles ; but the 
figure of the panfli is To irregular, that thefe meafures are to 
be regarded as the mean, rather than as the particular length 
and breadth. 

The general appearance of the country may be conceived 
as an extenfive valley from eaft to weft, having all the arable 
land hanging on the declivities of both fides, there being lit- 
tie or no plain on the banks of theibrooks, which, rifing in 
the hills, bend their courfes to either hand •, to Fiddich, on 
the weft; and, by the eaft, turning by the nor.h-weft to 
Spey. From this general defcription, Airndilly. the leat ot

L clouds borne along from the ocean by the north and 
north-wefterly winds, on which account the harvefts are 
..ther late; and, though the air be n^oift. yet there .s no 
diftemper generally prevalent. The people are v.gorous and 
healthy -, and feverals attain to the longefl term of human 
life, there being at prefent feveral men, each 80, and one 
woman accounted 100 years of age. 

The water of Fiddich, turned almoft at right angles, from 
an eaftern to a northern courfe, along the weft end of the 
parifli fteals in to the river bpey. which is only navigable 
for aoating timber down from Strath Spey, part of wh.ch is 
manufaaured into plank, deal, Ipar, and fcantling, by two 
faw-miUs at the Boat of Brigg. It is hardly neccffary to no- 
tke here the excellent falmon caught in the Spey, as the 
public are already fufficiently apprifed of this particular. 

The charter of Moray has preferved the memorial of the 
bridge over Spey at this place. Part of the foundation of 
the fouthern pier ftill remains. It has been fuppofed the 
bridge was of timber. Here alfo ftood the Chapel of St iV/- 
cholas—^^ -^d recepUonem Paiiperiim tranfeuntium" Both the 
bridge and hofpital were extant in the year 1232 ; but few 
particulars of their hiftory or deftruaion remain. 



Statl/iical Account 



It may be mentioned, that it is fuppofed praaicable t6 
build a ftone-bridge here for about the fum of 3000 1. Ster- 
ling, which, befides certain conveniencies peculiar to this 
fituation, would comprehend alfo all the requiGte accommo- 
dation to the public ; for. If the high-way vyere continued 
from where it joins the road bejween Keirh and Fochabers, 
at the fouth end of the laft of thefe villages, in the fliorteft 
courfe, to the Boat of Brigg, the diftance from Cullen to El- 
gin would not be increafed above 5 Englifh miles on the 
whole, on a road as firm, and lefs expofed to depth of fnovv, 
than the prefent high-way from Fochabers to Elgin. 

Population.— The ancient ftate of the population of the 
parifh cannot now be afcertained, farther than that it does 
not appear that the number of farm-houfes, or the extent of 
arable laiid, has been any way materially altered from what 
they were in times very remote. 

Of late years, the population has been rather on the de- 
creale, owing to feveral fmaller farms, on which from 2 to 
6 families refided, being reduced into a fingle farm, and oc- 
cupied by a fingle family. 

At prefent, the number of perfons amounts to 1 294, of 
whom 588 are males, and 706 females. 

They all refide in the country, and follow the occupation 
of hufbandry, with the exception of the few craftfmen who 
are requifite for that objedl-, and for the more immediate ac- 
commodation of the people. There are none who have left 
the parifli for want of employment ; yet a few go fouthward 
in fummer, on account of the higher wages given in that 
part of the kingdom. 

There has never been any accurate regifter kept of bap- 
tifms, marriages, or burials. Thefe particulars, therefore, 
tfannot with any fatisfadtory prccifion be afcertained.

ProduHions of the Parijh. —Oits. barley, and peafe, are the 
kinds of corn principally raifed. There are fields of (own 
grafs, bearing, however, little proportion to the natural lie 
grafs and common pafturage. Of the corn, there may be 
about two third parts in oats, the remaining third irf, barley 
and peafe, in which part the potatoe and flax may be alfo 
included. 

The oats and peafe are fown from the beginning of March, 
as the feafon allows, to near the middle of May ; and the 
barley feed-time is generally completed before the ill of 
June. The harvefl: begins from about the middle of Auguft 
to the middle of September. In loaie years, of late, it has 
not begun before the firft week of Oflober. Its conciuiion, 
of courfe, miift be at different times and it has been, of 
late, accounted early, if completed by the end of November. 

On the eftate of Airndilly, if the different banks and 
clumps be regarded as a whole, there is a confiderable ex- 
tent of natural wood, in which wild cherries, plumbs, and 
geens, are interfperfed. Qn "this eftate there are alfo exten- 
live plantations of fir and pine, and other foreft trees ; and 
fimilar plantations have alfo rifen up on the eftate of Auch- 
luncart, and on the lands in this parifli appertaining to the 
Earl of rindlater, and which are not deftitute of natural - 
wood. 

The black cattle among the country tenants, though not 
of great bone, are accounted handfome, and of a fine figure. 
The ordinary price of a yoke of oxen may be from 8 1. to 
15 1. Sterling J and fome have been fold at a higher rate. 
A milk cow may fell from 3 1. or 4 1. to 6 1. Sterling ; and a 
fcore of wedders, with the fleece, from 61. to 9 1. Sterling. 

Mifcellaneous. — It muft be accounted a difadvantage to the 
greater part of the parifli, that it is fo much expolcd to rain

in the end of fummer, and during the autumn ; and, from 
the coldnefs of the foil, the fnow lies long in the fpring, To 
that the feafons are later ; much of the corn not fully ripen- 
ed ; much loft and much vexatious trouble in h-arveft:, evils 
to virhich the oppofite fide of the Spey are comparatively not 
cxpofed ; while, on the other hand, the near and more eafy 
accefs to the cattle fairs during the fummer, the abundance 
of natural pafture and lime-rtone, are advantages which the 
neighbourhood on the north fide of that river do not fo 
amply poflefs. 

, The parifli is at prefent pofleffed by 4 heritors. David 
MDowall Grant, Efq; has the lands of Airndilly, Papeen, 
Newtown, Gallval, and Auchmadies. The Earl of Findlater 
holds the barony of Mulben, the lands of Cairnty and Mul- 
deiry, Andrew Stewart, Efq; writer- to the fignet, has the 
barony of Auchluncart. Archibald Duff of Drummuir, Efqj 
has the farm of Knocan. The valued rent of the parifh is 
2840 1. Scotch. The real rent of the whole has not been 
afcertaincd. 

The Scotch is the only language fpoken in the parifii j 
but, with a few exceptions, the names of the places belong 

to the Earfe tongue. 

There are no funds for the fupport of the poor, except 
two fmall mortifications, amounting only to 81. 10 s. Sterl. 
together. The number of poor on the roll may aipount to

The ruin of the caftle of Gallvall is the Only remam of 

any thing that can be deemed antiquity in the pariOi. It 
was built fronting the eaft, on the north fide of the valley 
towards the weftern end, where/the declivity hath fallen 
more gently into an inclined plain, and Ihot a promontory 
into the deep defile, formed by the courfc of the fiream of

, It is alfo by the charter of Moray inflruaed, that, be- 
tween the year 1203 and 1222, William, the fon of William 
Frelkyn, obtained the confent of Brucius, Bifhop of Moray, 
for building a domeftic chapel, for the more commodious 
performance of the offi-es of devotion. It flood on its own 
confecrated burying-ground, forfaken only in the courfc of 
the laft 60 years, about co yards from the north end of the 
caftlei and, though only 24 by 12 feet within, muft have 
been the parent of the prefent parifh church, which, with 
feveral others, was ertaed ar the private expence of James VI. 
for civilizing the north of Scotland, in the year 1618, at 
which period the parifh of Airndilly may be fuppofed to 
have been annexed. 

A part alfo of the parifli of Dundurcos has been of late

allowance for communion elements, is only 7^1. ^s. 2-d

Although it is not certainly known that any man of pecu- 
liar eminence was born in the parifli, yet it may be proper 
to notice, that Mr J ames Fergufon, the aftrononier, received 
the rudiments of his education here, under the patronage of 
the grandfather of the prefent Mrs Grant of Airndilly. Mr 
Fergufon has him/elf publiflied his life : It is only neceflary

therefore here , to add, that, while . little boy who could 
hardly read, and employed in tending the cows, the famly 
clock was the firft obj.a which elicited thofe fparks of me- 
chanical genius which in due time fhone with fuch a bnght 

and vigorous flame* ^ . , 

Ihe people, on the whole, are induftrious, economical, 
obliging, and kind, according to their manners and circum- 
ftances'^ very attentive to the national religion 5 and there 
is no remembrance of any having been judicially punifhed 
for the violation of the laws of morality or juftice. Thev 
appear, in general, to enjoy the neceffaries, and many of the 
comforts of life, and to be contented with that fituation in 
the world which has been allotted to 'them by Providence. 
There are means by which their circumftances might be 
meliorated but, it being extremely probable they will not 
be adopted, it may be deemed officious to enumerate them 
here. 

The difficulty and cxpence of procuring hands for the 
operations of agriculture, and the want of all police, either 
conventional or legal, refpeaing this object, has of late been 
fo heavily and univerfally felt, that perhaps any fpeculation 
that might contribute to turn the attention of the more dif- 
cerning to this interefting objeft, may not be deemed entire- 
ly nugatory. 

In fo far as" this grievance hath arifen from the diminilhed 
value of money in the prefent opulent age, when, as in the 
days of Solomon, it may be faid " of fiher^ that it is not any 
« thing accounted ofy' it cannot be regarded as any caufe of 
complaint ; for the price of labour muft be proportional to 
that of other articles : But, in fo far as the evil arifes from 
the combined fraud, the falfehood, the ftubbornnefs, and 
the domineering infolence of that rank of fociety, it ought 
to be reprefled, although in due confiftence with the rights

of men ; and much delicacy, in this regard, is no doubt rc^ 
quifite. It might tenfl, perhaps, to check the evil, were 
every agricultural fervant, by law,, obliged to produce to the 
mafter with whom he engages, and to the church feffion of 
the parifh, when required, a certificate from the mafter 
whom he left, granted before two le;Lial witnefl^es, of the 
wages which he received, and of the dilcretion, fidelity, and 
diligence, which he maintained during the period of his pre- 
ceding fervice ; the engaging mafter to forkit equal to a 
quarter of year's wages, and the fervant as much, to the pa- 
rifh fund, for every omifiion of luch formality; to be re- 
covered at the inftance of the cafhier of the lefl^ion, by the 
warrant of one juftice of the peace, or other judge ordmary, 
in the fame fummary manner in which the fines are levied 
on the abfentees from the ftatute labour on the roads. 

Thofe who have been attentive to the operation of any 
new law, will be able perhaps to form a judgment of the ef- 
fect of fuch an eftablilhment, were it fo framed as to admit 
of equal execution in England and in Scotland. It does not 
appear that it could be attended with much inconvenience to 
either party i and, while it would, in general, prevent im- 
pofition on the mafter who engages, by an exaggerated ac- 
count of the wages paid by the laft mafter, as is now fo ge- 
nerally the cafe, it would, m many inftances, have the effea 
of rendering the fervant difcreet and diligent during the 
term of his fervice, when fo much as a quarter's wages de- 
pended on his behaviour. 

Other improvements refpeaing diet, and the hours of la- 
bour, might be fuggefted ; but it is probable the effeft alone 
of the certificate may render thefe unneceffiiry : At any rate, 
if regulations refpeaing the contraft between mafter and 
fervant ftiall be taken under the confideration of Lcgiflature,

that man cannot be fatisfied with the fimple element alone of

Synod of Perth and Stirling.) 

By the Rev. Mr Patrick Stuart, Minijler,</head>

<p>

Namty Situation^ and Extent. 

'' I/' HE name of this parifh is evidently Gaelic, and feems 
, to fignify the chapel, church-yard, or burying place 

of the pool * ; the ruins of an old chapel, and the church- 
yard, being jStuated on a bank of the river of Lochy, and 
having one of the deepeft pools in the river juft behind 
' them. From this circumftance the parifti feems to have de- 
rived its name ; but as the word Killin may fignify in Gaelic, 
too, the burying place of Fingal f, a tradition prevails, owing 
probably to this very circumftance, that that great hero of 
the Highlanders was interred here, and that it is thence that 
the parilh derives its name. A fmall eminence in the neigh-- 
bourhood of the village of Killin, has been accordingly 
pointed out as his grave, but on being opened fome years ago, 
no veftige appeare'd of any perlbns having been interred 
there. The parifli is fituated in the north-weft corner of 
the county of Perth, in the diftridl called Brgidalbane, and 
in the prefbytery of Dunkeld, and fynod of Perth and Stir- 
ling,

Hog It Is about 28 ft'^tute miles in length, and, in moft 
places, from 6 to 8 miles in breadth. It is bounded by the 
parifh of Kenmore on the eaft, by the parilhes of Coinne and 
Balquidder on the fouth, by the pariili of Arrochar on the 
fbuth-weft, by that of Clochandylart or Glenorchay on the 
weft, and by parts of the parifh of Fortingal in Gienlyon on 
the north. From the pariOi church, which is fituated in 
the village of KiHin, at the weft end of the lake called Loch- 
Tay, the parifti extends 8 miles eaft along the fouth fide of 
that lake, and to the weftward about 20 miles, through a 
valley, the eaft end of which is named Glendochart, and the 
weft end of it Strathfillan. A village called Glenfalloch which ' 
breaks off from Strathfillan, and is about 7 miles in length, 
lying towards the fouth- weft, belongs alfo to the parifli of 
Killin, Towards the north lies Glenlochy, a valley about ^ 
10 miles in length. It is feparated by a ridge of mountains 
from Glendochart and Strathfillan, and run? parallel to them, 
terminating, Hke Glendochart, in a pretty extenfive plain, at 
the weft end of Loch-Tay. Moft of the farms in Glenlochy 
belong, according to the antient arrangement of ihefe pa- 
riihes, to the neighbouring pariflies of Kenmore and Weem, 
but, from their vicinity, depend entirely on Killin for church 
privileges, though not formally annexed thereto, quoad facra; 
and the cafe is the fame with the farms to the eaftward of 
the village of Killin, for two or three miles alongft the north 
fide of Loch-Tay.

is favourable. As it lies moftly on gravel, however, it is apt 
to be parched up in dry fealbns, particularly alongft the de- 
clivities of the hills. A confiderable part of the foil' in the 
parifli too is wet and marfhy. This kind abounds moft in ' 
the plain which lies at the weft end of Loch-Tay, and in the

bottoms of the valleys of Glenlochy and Glendochart, which 
are fubjea to the ov,erflowings of the rivers of Lochy and 
Dochart running through them. (IWe rivers, being fud- 
denly fwelled by the rains, defcend frequently with confr- 
derable impetuofity, overflowing their banks, to the no fmall 
'prejudice of the fields and meadows which lie along the fides 
of them. The furface of the ground in thie parifh is gene- 
rally unequal. The bottoms of the valleys are moftjy level, 
confining chiefly of meadows and arable ground. The hills 
rife with a gentle flope, and are cultivated and inhabited in 
many parts a good way up. They rife, in m^ny places, to a 
confiderable height, and carry rich grafs to the very top. In 
the, higher parts of them, it is generally interfperfed with 
pretty rank heath, which the fhepherds of late years have 
been at pains in burning, and the fheep, fince the more ge- 
neral introdu£lion of them into the country, contribute to 
keep under. 

Lakes and Rivers. — Loch-Tay, by the fide of which a great 
part of the parifli of Kiliin lies, is the only remarkable lake 
in the country. It is a frefh water lake, 15 Englifh miles in 
length, and reckoned aboUt a mile in breadth. It lies from 
weft to eaft, and out of it the river Tay ifl!ues. Thei;c is 
another lake ;iit the weft end of Glendochart, called Loch- 
dochart. ,It lies alfo from weft to eaft, is about 3 miles in 
length, anci forms the boundary betwixt StrathfiUan and Glen- 
dochart. The river of FiUan falls into the weft end of it, 
after running for 7 miles through StrathfiUan, and the river 
of Dochart ifiucs out of it, which runs for 8 miles through 
Glendochart, before it joins the Lochy and enters into 
Loch-Tay. The river of Lochy, runs for about 10 miles 
through Glenlochy, and thefe rivers of Lochy and Do- 
chart evidently give their names to each of the valleys 

through 



rf Killin. 37* 

through which they run. They are but fmall, and moftly 
clear and rapid, being formed chiefly of the ftreams that 
fall into them from the adjacent hills. There is another 
fmall river, named Falloch, which runs through Glenfalloch, 
and feems to give its name to that valley. It difcharges it- 
felf into the north end of Lochlomond, 

Salmon and trout are the kinds of fifti that abound 
moft in the lakes and rivers of this parilh. The falmon of 
Loch-Tay are rich and large ; and it is a remarkable circum- 
ftance refpeaing this lake, that, excepting for about two 
months in the middle of winter, the falmon are found clean 
therein during the whole year. They go weft the river Do- 
chart in confiderable numbers in the Ipring and lummer 
months, but few qr none of them are found in the Lochy ; 
owing probably to fbme confiderable falls in that river. 
There are fome trout of a large fize found in Loch-Tay, but 
they are rare ; and the trout in the rivers of Lochy and Do- 
chart, and in fome lakes in the adjacent hills, though pretty 
numerous, are generally of a fmall fize. Loch-'l ay, and the 
rivers that fall into it, have alio eels, pike, and perch in 
them. The char, too, are in the lake, but they ordinarily 
keep by the depths, fo that they are leldom got but in the 
end of autumn and beginning of winter,, vsrhen they proceed 
up the rivers in great numbers to Ipawn *. 

Hills and Woods. — The parifh of Klllin abounds In high 

hills, 

* Tli'ere is a circum Ranee not unworthy of notice, that the 
Earl of Breadalbane has, by his chaiteri, the ])riviiege of fifli- 
ery for faimon upon Loch-Tay at all lealons, -without any re- 
ftr^int from ftatutory reftriaion. This privilege is laid to have 
been intended, for fiipplying with tilh the nuns of a convent 
upon the iiland at the tall end of Loch-Tay, founded, it is laid,, 
by one of the Scottifli Queens,

hills, which are not rocky, but covered with grafs and heath 
in moft parts to the tops of them. The higheft mountain 
in the parifli is Benmore, which is fituated by the fide of 
Lochdochart, in the pafs betwixt Glendochart and Strath- 
fillan. Its figure is conical, and, by Stobie's map of the 
county of Perth, its elevation above the level of the fea is 
3903 feet. It was in former times a deer foreft, but is now 
converted into a fhecp walk. 

There is a confiderable quantity of wood in the parifli, 
both natural and planted ; and it thrives very well in moft 
parts of it. Even in Strathfiilan, and in the higher parts of 
the parifh, where there is now rather a want of wood, it is 
very evident it once abounded ; the trunks of trees being fo 
frtquent in the ground ^ that the natives within thefe few 
years made a pradlice of digging them up, and ufing them 
for light and fuel. The natural woods confift chiefly of oak, 
afh, hazel, alder, and birch; and the plantations of Scotch 
and lilver fir, plane, beech, and elm. 'i hey are now moflly 
inclofed, and taken fufficient care of by their feveral pro- 
prietors. 

Game, ^c. — There is a great variety of game, both in the 
woods and hills of the parilh. The moft numerous wild 
quadrupeds are hares of both kinds, , the white and common 
hare. Roes are in fome ~of the^ woods, but they are rare. 
"Wild cats, martins, weafels, badgers, and otters, are not un. 
comiiion. 1 he fox, which was formerly fo deftruftive to 
the Iheep of the country, is now moftly extirpated. — Of 
the winged kind, tarmagans, dotterels, and - plovers, are on 
the tops of the mountains j grous and black game in the 
hills; and partridges in the corn fields. The ravenous birds 
that prevail u.oft, are eagle?, hawks of different kinds, ra- 
vens, crows, and magpies. Ducks of various kinds, herons, 



of Killin. 373 

rea-gulls, and wild geefe. frequent the lakes and rivers. The 
LLo, fwallow, and other migratory birds that are c_ 
in the reft of the internal parts of the kingdom, pay their 
Itl vifit here. Some birds are found in th.s coun ry 
..ich are reckoned rare ; as the rcaup-duck, the .^r^ 
thering.ouzel. the greater fpotted wood-pecker, the 
hatch, the greater and leffer red-poUs, &amp;c. 

Clmate and D\feafes.^1\^t climate is various, but generally 
moift and cold. This is much owing to the particular htu- 
ation of the parifh. The diftrift of Breadalbane, m which 
it Hes, is one of the hightft in Scotland, and fartbeft remo- 
ved from the fea and as it abounds in high mountains, 
the clouds, floating in the atmofphere, frequently break up- 
on the tops of them, and fall down in rain through the val- 
leyc. The fnow, too, refts long upon the hills ; and, owing 
to thefe circumftances, the fpring is generally late and cold. 
But when rummer commences, by the re flea ion of the fuu 
from the adjacent hills, the heat is much greater than in le-^ 
vel countries, and vegetation advances with great rapidity. 
The difeafes that prevail moft among the inhabitants arc 
fuch as are principally owing to the influence of climate, as 
rheumatifms, pleurifies. Sec The people are, in general, 
however, very healthy, which is much owing to their fober 
and induftrious mode of living. Seventy and eighty years is 
not an uncommon age attained by them, and there have 
beep more than one inftance of perfons in the parifli who 
have outlived their loodth year within the prefent century. 

The 

* The height of this country is intimated by its name, Braid- 
Alha'wn being a Gaelic word, which fignifies the higheft part of 
Scotland ; and as an evidence ot its height, it is to be obferved, 
that at Carn-drom, in the weft end of the parifti, the waters 
divide, and run paitly into the eaftern, and partly into the wef- 
lern fea.

The great mortah'ty. occafioned in former years by the fmall. 
pox: among the children, has been of late in a great meafure 
prevented by the introduftion of inoculation. 

&amp;tate of Property.-Thc landed property of the parifl, is 
divided among 5 proprietors, who all hold their lands of the 
Crown. More than half of the land in the parilh is the 
Earl of Breadalbane's property. Mr Drummond of Perth 
has one farm therein, on which there is a feu of lomc acres, 
with a long leafei and the remainder is divided among three 
gentlemen, who have each of them a right to a freehold 
qualification in the county, have places of refidence, and or- 
dinarily rtfide in the parilh. The valued rent of the whole 
parilli is,, 3 1 1 5 1. 6 s. 8 d. Scots. The real rent amounts to 
about 3000 1. Sterhng, 

Cultivation and Produce — As this parilh was never com- 
pletely furveyed, the exad number of acres it may compre- 
hend has not been afcertained ; nor the proportion that the 
paflure ground therein bears to the arable. The greateft 
part of the land is evidently calculated for pafture; but 
there' is alfo a coniiderable quantity of arable ground, which 
is kept in conflant tillage. The principal crops railed in 
this parifh are oats, peale, potatoes, flax, and bear or big. 
Oats and peafe are fovvn commonly from the beginning to 
the end of April j bear and potatoes from the beginning to 
the middle of May. A confiderable quantity of flax is railed 
in the parifh, and fown about the end of April. The rota- 
tion of crops ordinarily obferved, is to fow oats in lea ground, 
or after fallowing ; potatoes or bear after oats ; and flax af- 
ter bear or potatoes. The increafe from thefe difi^erent kinds 
of feed varies much, according to the quality of the. ground 
and the nature of the feafon. Oats generally return from 

3

. to 4 after the grain fown ; barley and peafe from 3 to 5 ; 
potatoes from 10 to 16 i and flax from half a flone to a ftone, 
after the lippy of leed. Oaring greatly to the Icarc.ty of m- 
clofures, turnips and fown grafs are little cultivated m the 
parilL, except by a few, gentlemen, with whom they anfwer 
well, and who derive much benefit from them. The harveft 
lafually begins abont the middle of Auguft, and the crop, 
except in very wet and cold feafons, is fecured by the end of 
September or beginning of Oaober. 

Trice of Grain and Provj^ons.— The grain produced in 
this pariih itfelf is never fufhcient for fupplying its inhabi- 
tants with that article. There are, befides, fome hundred 
bolls of meal imported into it annually. The average price 
of oats here is 12 s. of bear 16 s. and of potatoes 45. per 
boll. Oat meal is ordinarily fold at i6s. and bear meal at 
12 s. per boll J but in the years 1782 and 1783, oat meal 
fold here at 1 1. 3 s. and 1 1. 4 s- per boll ; and the different 
crops failed fo far, in this and the adjacent couotries, in 
thefe two feafons, that the natives of this parifli had been 
much at a lofs for meal at any price, were it not for fome 
peafe meal brought from the fouth, which ferved greatly to 
relieve their diftrefs. The price of beef, mutton, veal, and 
pork, is generally regulated by the prices of our cattle mar- 
kets, being about 3 d. per lib. of 174. oz — Butter is pd. per 
lib. of 22 oz. tron weight. — Cheefe varies in its price, ac- 
cording to its richnefs and age, being from 5 s. 7 s. per 
ftone of 22 lib. 

Price of Labour. — The price of all kinds of labour is 
greatly advanced here of late years. The wages of men la- 
bourers arc I s. a day from the ifl of March to the ift of 
November, when they furnifh their own provifions. Men 

working 



37^

working at peats are allowed 8 d. per day, and women 6 d, 
with their meat. The wages of a carpenter and mafon are 
from I s. 6 d. to 2 s. per day ; of a taylor, i s. without meat, 
or 8 d. with it. Domeftic men-fervants get from 7 1. to 
lol. Sterling of wages, and women from 2 I. to 3 1, Ster- 
ling. 

Villages, iifc — Kilh'n and Clifton are the only villages in 
this parifh. The village of Killin is fituated at the weft end 
of Loch-Tay, betwixt the rivers of Lochy and Dochart, 
which join a little to the eaft ward of the village, before they 
enter the lake. The windings of thefe rivers through the 
plain at the end of the lake, and the furroundmg hills, in 
mapy parts Ikirted with wood, ferve to render the fituation 
of the village both pidlurefque and j.leafant. In fummer, 
particularly, there is a variety in the fcene that moft ftran- 
gers are pleafed with ; and it is one of thofe landfcapes that 
Mr Pennant was fo much gratified with, as to give a view of 
it in his tour. The village itfelf is but fmall, and formed 
on np regular plan. It contains only about 150 fouls, but 
the diftrift of country that furrounds it, is for feveral miles 
clofely inhabited. Moft of the villagers are tradefmen, who 
have an acre of ground, alongft with a houfe and garden, 
for each of which they pay rent to the Earl of Breadalbane. 
There are 6 fairs held here annually, at which a good num- 
ber of cattle is ordinarily fold, with a confiderablc quantity 
of woollen and linen yarn, b^ifides a variety of other articles 
imported and exported out of the country. At Killin, too, 
the family of Breadalbane held their baron-bailie courts, for 
fettling any little differences which' may occur, and for main- 
taining order among their tenants. Clifton is a fmall village, 
which lies in the weft end of the parifli. It cpntains about

200 tjcrrons, who have hitherto earned their bread princi- 
pally in working at a lead mine in that neighbourhood. 

Inns, Ak'houfes, $5*^ —There are feveral houfes in this pa- 
rifh in which ale and Ipirits are fold, but nOne that deferve 
to be termed inns except two. One of thele is in the vil- 
lage of Killin, and the other at Tyndrum, in the weft end of 
the parifli, being a proper ftage betwixt Killin and Dalmaly 
in Glcnorchay. A diftillery, too, has been ereaed lately in 
the neighbourhood of the village of Killin, which is the on-» 
ly one in the parifh. 

^oads and Bridges. — The diftricTt of Breadalbanc, in gene- 
ral, in which the parilh of Kiilin is fituated, is well fupplied 
both with roads and bridges. The military road from Stir- 
ling to Fort William pafles thtough a great part of this pa- 
rilh i and the improvements made lately on that line of 
road, with the great order in which it is now kept, fcrve to 
render the communication of this country with the fouth of 
Scotland, and the weft and north-weft Highlands, eafy and 
agreeable. The country roads through the parifh were ori*- 
ginally made, and are ftill kept in repair, by the ftatute la- 
bour, which is exadlcd in kind. 

State of the Church.-^ I'he Earl of Brendalbane is fole pa- 
tron of theparilli. The church was built in 1744, and, 
were it properly finilhcd within, might vie with moft coun- 
try churches for ricatnels and elegance. Befides the pafifK 
church, which is fituated in the village of Killin, there are 
two other chapels in thd parifh, the one at StrathfiUan *, and

be dipped in the Saint's Pool, it was neceflUry to perform cer- 
tain ceremonies, in which there was a mixture of Druidifm and 
Popery. After remaining all night in the chapd, bound with 
Topes, the bell was fet upon their head with great folemnity. 
It was the popular opinion, that, if ftolen, it would extricate 
i^felf out of the thief's hands, and return home ringing all the 
way. For fome years pad this bell has been locked up, to 
prevent its being ufed to fuperftitlous purpofes. 

It is but juftice to the Highlanders to fay, that the dipping 
of mad people in St Fillan's Pool, and udng the other ceremo- 
nies, was common to them with the Lnwlanders. The origin 
of the bell is to be referred to the mod remote ages of the 
Celtic churches, whofe minifters fpoke a dialed of that lan- 
guage- Ara Trode, one of the moft antient Icelandic hifto- 
rians, tells us, in his 2d chapter, that when the Norwegians firft 
planted a colony in Ireland, about the year 870, " Eo tempore

*« Tum erant hie viri Chriftiani ; quos Norwegi Papas appel-

hajula both fignify hand.bells. See Du Cange. Giraldus 
Cambrenfis, who vifited Ireland about the end of the rath cen- 
lury, fpeaks thus of thefe relidls of fuperftition : " Hoc non

whom learn Latin, Greek, and French with him. There 
are 3 other fchoolmafters in the parifli, who teach only the 
reading of Englifh and Gaelic, with writing and arithmetic ; 
and 3 fchoolmiflrelTes, for teaching fewing and knitting of 
ftockings. One of thele fchoolmafters has a falary of 14].

fchoolmlftrefles have each of them 5 1. Sterling from the So- 
cicty annually. 

Poor — The average number of poor receiving alms in this 
parifli, and the adjacent pjrts of the pari flies of Kri\m tc 
and Weem, is about 80. fhe annual fund for their renef 
IS about 30 1. produced by the colledions in church upon 
Sundays, mort-cloth dues, fines on delinquents, and the in- 
terefl of a fmall fum appropriated tor their ufe. About 10 
of thefe are confined to bed, who receive the greateit part 
of their fubfifl:ence from the chnrity cf their neighbours m 
more affluent circumflanccs. Here it is but doing jutttce tp 
the inhabitants to obferve, that they are, m general, remark- 
ably charitable. The nobie family of Breadalb^ne, in parti- 
cular, deferve much praife. For many years paft, they hav« 
been in the ufe of giving meal annually to the poor of the 
pariflics ot Killin and Kenmore, to the amount of above 100 
bolls. A great number of beggars from^the neighbouring 
counties infell the parifh, parficuiarlv in the fiimmer anc^ 
harvefl months, many of whom are neither needful nor de- 
fervlng of charity. 

Population, — By a late furvey, there are at prefent 2360 
fouls in the parifh, 11 35 of whom are males, and 122-, fe- 
males. Among thefe are 36 weavers, 22 taylors, 19 flioc- 
raakers, 14 wrights, 9 flaxdreffers, 7 merchants, 6 fiuiths, 
and 2 bakers. There are 1 1 36 inhabitants in the adjacent 
parts of the pariihes of Kenmore and Weem. It might be 
apprehended that this parifli has been greatly depopulated 
within ihefc 60 years, by the union of farms, and the num- 
ber of flaeep introduced into it ; and it mufl be admitted, 
that, owing to thefe caufes, the number of the people has 
dccreafed confiderably in the higher parts of the parifh with- 
in 



of Killm, 



in that period. But, fo far as the population of the parifl, is 
to be judged ot from the leffion records, it may be concmd^ d, 
that it has increaled m the lower parts dv reef, and particu- 
larly in the village of K.Uin, w.th the diltrift of country 
that lurrounds it, nearly in the fame proportion in which it 
has decrealed in the higher p.rts. The rcgifler of births ia 
the parifli has been kept with much exiianel. during the 
period fpecified. from which it appears, that the toui num- 
ber of births in the parifh for 60 years, preceding the year 
1790, amounts to 69:6. at the a nnual average of 115, with 
little differ.- nee. An abftr^a of the births and marriage^ in

Number of Horfes, ^c.-^Tht number of horfes In the pa- 
rifh is computed to be about 400, and of black cattle froox 
1780 to 1800. They are moftly of the Highland breed, 
except a few of the lowland or mixed breed, kept by fome of 
the gentlemen and better farmers. Stocking with (heep is 
now become fo prevalent, that all the extenfive grazings in 
this country are laid under them. The number of fheep 
fuppofed to be in the pariQi, at prefent, is from 26,000 to 
27,000, and all of them of the Linton breed. Since pota- 
toes have become more plentiful, fwine have become more 
numerous. There are about 150 of them at prefent in this 
parifli. 

Mines, Minerals, ^c.—Thc only mine in the parifti is a 
lead-mine, which has been wrought at Cam drom, in the 
well end of it, for thefe 40 years paft. But it is given up 
for the prefent, which proves a temporary inconvenience to 
a number of poor people in the village of Clifton, in its 
neighbourhood, who depended chiefly for their fubfiftencc 
upon the employment they got in it. There are no mineral 
fprings of any note in the parifh. Search has been repeat- 
edly made for coals, but hitherto without fuccefs. Peat?, 
and feme barren timber, are the only fuel ufed. Limc-ftonc 
abounds in moft parts of the parifh. 

jyiifcellaneous Obfervations. — Towards the beginning of the 
prefent century, the people of the country were rather averfe 
to induftry. The fpirit of clanfliip which prevailed was 
very unfavourable to it. The different clans fpcnt a great 
part of their time in avenging themfelves of each other j the 
man who could beft handle his fword and his gun was deem- 
ed the prettieft fellow and the attentive induftrious man 
was a charaiter held in a degree of contempt. The people, 

m

in general, were confequently poor, rents were III paid, and 
fometimcs not at all. The family of Breadalbane. who w.rc 
fupenors of the country, adopted very wife plans for its im- 
provrment. A Sheriff-fubftitute was got to Kiilin for fet- 
tling differences j a check was given to knavery; the fober 
and induftrious among the people were fupported and en- 
couraged ; and the turbulent and irregular expelled the coun- 
try, to which they were fo much attached, that it was rec- 
koned no fmall puniihmcnt by them. Thefe means, toge- 
ther with the happy change in the times, have had very 
good effects. The people of Breadalbane are now fober, re- 
gular, and induftrious. They are, in general, rather in cafy 
than affluent circumftances. They pay thdr rents punau.il. 
ly, and live comfortably. Moft of the farms in the lower 
parts of the parifh are divided among leveral tenants. The 
arable and pafture ground being feparated, each has his own 
divifion of the arable, and their cattle feed in common in the 
pafture ground. In this manner they live harraonioufly to- 
gether; and pofleffions defcend, particularly on the Breadal- 
bane eftate, from father to fon. Gaelic is the language gene- 
rally fpoken in the country ; but moft of the younger neopfc 
underftand Icfs or more of the Englifli language, and can 
converfe in it. They make a praftice, when young, of go- 
ing for fcveral years to ferve in the low country, principally 
for the purpofe of learning the Englifh language. The ge- 
nerality of the people are lively and intelligent, without be- 
ing turbulent, have a competent (hare of knowledge, and at- 
tend religious ordinances regulai-ly, and with great decorum. 
Scarcity of fuel, and diftance from markets, are the principal 
difadvantages to which this parifh is fubje^; but the laft of 
thefe difadvantages is now greatly alleviated by the goodneis 
of the roads leading into it, and palling through it. '

Situation^ Name, and Etaient. 



HE name of this parifli was anciently written Aber- 



X buthcnoth, as appears from feveral old writings extant 
in the neighbourhood \ but whence it could be derived is iin- 
ccrtain, as there is no river, or rivulet, whofe influx vyithin its 
bounds could have occafioned it, if we except one called Fo- 
thy or Forthy, which falls into the tiver Bcrvy, on the wef- 
tern boundary of the parifh i but that rivulet has born its 
prefent name above 600 years in the bounding charters of 
fome neighbouring cftates. Perhaps the river Bervy, of old, 
may have born another name, which occafioned the name of 
Aberbuthenoth, by its iiiflux into the fca, which is about a 
quarter of a mile below the extremity of this parifh. 

Tlie parifli is nearly of an oblOng triangular form, with the 
exception of two Lnns which form a projedlion fouthward 
of the water of Rervy^ which is the boundary of the reft of 
that fide, dividing it from the parifhes of Bcrvy and Garvock, 
five miles in leng-'h. 

Upon the wett fide it is bounded by the pari flies of Fordun 
and Gkrb-.rvy, or the great hollow of the Mearns, the rivers 




Vol. XVII.

Bervy 



Siatiftical Account 



Bervy and Forthy forming this line of divifion, for the moft 
part about three miles in length ; and on the north eaft fide it 
is bounded by the parilhes in Glenbervy and KinnefF, about fix 
' miles in length, back to the river Bervy, where the fouthern 
boundary commenced, forming a fliarp angle near the mouth 
of that river. 



Surface. — The furface is unequal, prefenting particularly 
ttfro rifing grounds or ridges, with hollows or valleys betwixt 
them, and the boundaries of the parifh on each fide, whei:e 
the ground again rifes to ftill greater height. The one of 
thefc ridges commences at the eaftern angle, running weft- 
ward about two miles, where the other begins a little ob- 
liquely upon the one fide toward the Bervy river, forming a 
wide hollow betwixt it and the northern boundary, which 
reaches to the weftern boundary, and joins the hollow of the 
Mearns. The narrow valley in which Bervy river runs, is 
highly pifturefque and beautiful, containing the manfions of 
Arbuthnot and Allardyce, with the church fituated betweeri 
them. 

SoU.—Tht foil IS various. Along the fouthern valley it 
is ftrong clay ; upon the rifing grounds above mentioned it 
is Hght land •, and in the bottom of the northern valley it is 
wet and fwampy, being moftly in rough pafture i but the 
fields toward the northern boundary, where the ground again 
rifes, are more dry, and of* a lighter foil. 

The air, in general, is m6ift| owing to the nature and po- 
fitlon of the furface, its natural wetnefs and exhalations from 
the ftreams with which it is watered ; yet it has never been 
obferved to be particularly unfavourable to health ; and the 
inhabitants, in general, are of good fize, and many of them 
live to a great age.

Minerals. — Within this parifh there are fcveral freeftnne 
quarries of excellent quality. In one fpot there is a roci? full 
of pcebles, with feme green jafper, of confiderable beauty. 
No coal nor lime-ftone have ever been here difcovered i but 
fome chalybeate fprings indicate the prefence of iron. 

Fuel. ^The common fuel of the farmers is coal brought 

from the Frith of Forth, and landed at fome of the neigh- 
bouring creeks upon the coaft. The fuel of the poorer fort 
is a coarfc fort of turf from the moors, and fiill a worfe peat 
fod dug firora the mprafly grounds. 

Heritors^ tsfc. — The proprietory are four in number, of 
whom only one is refident, the Vifcount of Arbuthnot, By 
a map of the county, executed in 1774, it appears that there 
are in this parifh 7785 Scotch acres, or 9893, Englifh, of 
which about one third may be fuppofcd arable, the reft being 
wet rough pafture and moor. The moft of the land lies 
open. The rent is various, according to the different foils 
and progrefs of improvement, from i 1. to 7 s. 6 d. per acre, 
arable, with the pafture gratis. The rent of the whole parilli 
ii about ic^ooi. Sterling, of which a confiderable part is 
visual. 

Ploughs.— Accord'mg to the old manner of eftimating the 
extent of farms by ploughs of four horles, there are here 
reckoned 54 ploughs •, of thefe there are 14 poflellions rated 
at 2 ploughs each ; twenty-two of one plough each ; five of 
half a plough ; and 6 of a quarter each. At prefent. moft: 
part of the ground is tilled by the common foot- plough, with 
four horfes, or fix oxen, and fome of the improved gronnd 
with two horfes. Box oxen are little ufed for the plough,

Produce.^rht produce of the par.ih is more than fuf, 
ficlent for its own fupply. The moft general crops of grain 
are oats and bear, with a little barley and wheat- Turnip^ 
and potatoes are likewife very general. A confiderable quan- 
tity of clover and rye-grafs now begins to be fown, though not 
fo much as is necefTary to good farming, upon even the im- 
proved lands ; the ground not being fufficiently refted, an4 
the horfes chiefly fed upon ftraw. Upon fhe cftate of AI- 
lardyce, very confiderable improvements have taken place un- 
der the direaion and encouragement of Mr Barclay of Ury, 
now proprietor of thefe lands. By the leafes granted by him 
for the laft fourteen years, the tenants are bound to a mode 
pf cropping the improved ground i to divide it into a courfe 
of four, five, or fix crops, with a reftriftion not to take more 
crops of grain than the rotation of fix admitted, viz. turnip, 
barley, and grals, not lefs than two years, to be broken up 
with two fucceffive crops of grain of different kinds each 
year ; and if any of thefe be wheat, it mull be the firft after 
grafs. As might be cxpe^ed, the tenants have cliofen to 
hold the courfe of fix, preferably to the four or five years. 
(The information in this article is furnifhed by Mr Barclay 
himfelf). By thefe judicious rules the value of the eftate is

Of late, the pr^ftice of farmers letting ground to cottagers 
who do their work begins to be here laa alide as every 
where ehe through the country ; b, which, in a Ihort time, 
there muft be a great deficiency of hands properly trained 
agriculture ; and fervants drawn from towns, ne.ther poffefs 
that hardy vigour, temperance, nor induftry Jo requifxte to 
the employment of the hufb.ndman. The ordinary wages 
of a farm lervant, or ploughman, livjng in his matter's fauidy, 
is from 8 to 10 1. per anuum. The wages of a labourer i s. 
per day, without viftuals, or 8d. with them- The women 
are much e.nployed in fpinnmg coarle flax to mauufaaurers 
inMontrolci by which they have, for fome time, gai.ied 
from J s. to 4 s, per week. Tae wages of a woman farm ibr- 
vant is from 3 1. 10 s, to 4 1. per annum, with a confiderable 
difficulty of procuring them from the increaled profit by ina- 
nuf"£t'ires. 

There is a fmall quantity, from 400 to 500 yards of the 
coarfeft linen manufadured here, and bleached at hoire. 
J^ikewife a fmall quantity of ticking and lagkir.g, from 200 
to 300 yards, at 10 d. and i s. to i s, 3 d. per yard. Thefe 
are for hoine ufe, and tor lale at the fairs through the coun» 
try. 

There are no villages in the parifli, except about 20 houfes 
in one place, moftly occqpied by ft-adelmea. iradefmen?

The general charaacr of the people is induftrious and fo- 
ber, little difpofed to change of place or employment. 
Hence the population has been lb ftationary. 

Bcckftapcal StaU.-^With refpeft to the ecclefiaftitral ftate 
of the parifh : The Vifcount of Arbuthnot is patron of the 
church The clergyman has a living of 64 bolls of meal 
and bear, and about 42 L Sterling, befides a fmall glebe of 
little value. The prefent incumbent was fettled in the year 
1780 The church is a very antient fabric of afhlar work, 
but now in very bad repair. The manfe is almoft ruinous, 
but is about to be repaired. To the church is adjommg aa 
aylc of beautiful antique workmanlhip, which was built by 
an Alexander Arbuthnot, (defigned, in the appendix to Spo- 
tifwood's Hiftory), brother to the Baron of Arbuthnot, and 
parfon of Arbuthnot and Logie Buchan. He was elefted 
the firft Proteftant Principal of the King's College, Aber- 
deen, in the year 1 569. The lower part of this ayle was in- 
tended, and has been ufed as a burial place for the family of 
Arbuthnot. And in the upper part was a well finiflied a- 
partment, filled with books chiefly in divinity, many of 
which remained there till of late. This was Mr Arbmh- 
not's library, which he bequeathed for the ufe of the clergy 
of the Mearns. There are 4a Epifcopalians in the parifh, 
and no other diffenters. 

pgor. The number of poor ih the parifli is about 2a. 

The provifion for them confifts of the collc«^lions at the 
church, amounting annually to about 16 1. and the intercft 
of fome mortifications and feat rents, amounting to ill. los. 
making in whole about 27 1. 10 s. /

c l. 173, 8d. Sterling, together with lo bolls 3 firlots of

and , hool.hou,e .,ke all the reft of the public buildings 
here, are m fo bad repair as ,o be unfit for the reception of 
any perfon. *^ 

Ant}quitles.^Vr.d.r the article of antiquities and antient 
records, it ,s generally believed that feveral interefting parti- 
culars might be had from the old writings of the family of 
Arbuthnot, if accefs could be got to them. There is in ge- 
neral circulation, in the neighbourhood, a paper, of which 
the original remains with that family, bearing to be a judi- 
cial proof led by an ecclefiaftical fynod in the year i2o5, 
with rdpea to part of the property now belonging to them, 
in which feveral circumftances are deferving of attention i 
particularly, therein mention is made of water corn-mills 
having been of a date prior to that period, which is contrary 
to the opinion of fome of our late hiftorians. 

There is no vifible remain of antiquity within this parifh, 
except fome lines of a rampart thrown up in a regular n.an- 
ner upon a projeaing point near to Bervy river, which is faid 
to have been the refidence of a family of the name of Gel- 
lendris, who bequeathed the property to the Archbifliop of 
St Andrews, to whofe fuccclTors a leu-duty is ftiJl payable b^ 
the prefent proprietor. But this fortification has as .r.uch 
the appearance of being Roman, and bears the general name 
of the Caftledykes to this day. 

Eminent Men,~^\n former times this parifh was not defi- 
cicnt in producing men emment in public life. The family 
of Sibbalds of Kuir was one of the moft antientMn the coun- 
ty, poflcflcd of very extcnfivc property there. Among the 

laft 



of ArhuthnoU ^95 

laft of them was Dr David Sibbald, who having been pre- 
ceptor to the Duke of Gloucelier, ion to Kmg Charles I. 
fuffcred much on account of his loyalty m the civil wars, 
was impriloned in London, and had his eftate forfeited. 
However, he lived to fee the reftorat.on of Kmg Charles II. 
and died in his own houle of Kair, in the year 1661. 

It aho delerves to be mentioned, that the celebrated Dr 
Arbuthnot, phvfician to Queen Anne, and one of the trium- 
virate with Mr Pope and Dr nv.ft, derived his birth and 
early education from this parifh. He wa. fon to Alexander 
Arbuthnot minifter here, who was deprived for non-con- 
formity in the year 1689. Dr Arbuthnot received the firft 
part of his education at the parifh Ichool of Arbuthnot, 
from whence he and his elder brother Robert (afterwards a 
banker at Paris) removed to the Manfchal College of Aber- 
deen, abuut the year 1680. 

Language.-^ h.s the names of the different farms in this pa- 
tifli are, for the moft part, of Gaelic original, it would leem 
that, in former times, the Gaelic langu age had generally pre- 
vailed here. To perfons acquainted with that language, 
thefe names all appear to be defcriptive of the iituation and 
elrcumftances which diftinguifh the feveral places Much in- 
formation might poffibly be derived from this fource, joined to 
the written evidence connedled with the diftr £t where pro- 
perty has been more fixed than in moll pans of the county.

Situation. 

AFTER a courfe of many miles from weft to eaft, the 
Doveron, by altering its direfHon to the north weft, 
forms an acute angle ; and, winding through a beauiiful and 
fertile vale, continues to flow in that dire6lion,^tiil it falls in- 
to the Tea at Btnff which is abwut lo Englifh miles diftant 
from this place. On the Ibuth a! d eaft lidcs of this angle, 
lies the par fli of Turreff, that of Forglen of Old Townan 
being contained within it, on the oppolite bank of the river. 
Near the angular point, where the Bur/i of Turrcft' falls in- 
to the Doveron, ftand the town and kirk of Turreft", from 
whence to the extremities of the parifli, the diftance on all 
fides, except weihvard, is nearly the fame, and no where ex- 
ceeds 4- EngliQi miles ; fo that a circle, of which the town 
of Turrtff is the center, and the radius 4! mile?, will in- 
-clude borh this parilh, and a great part of that of Forglen. 
The other neighbouring pariflies are Alvah, King-Edward, 
JVJonquhitcr, Auchterlift, and Inverkeithing.

Neme. Antiquities, $5'^.— According fo fome, Turreff, in 
the Gaelic language, fignifies towers. According to others, 
it fignifies a mount or height. The fituat.on ot the town, 
and the vulgar pronunciation, Torra, an old law term figni- 
fying a mount, favour the laft luppofition. But the. former 
is no lefs probable, becaufe near the church-yard gate, and 
on the fouth fide of the ftreet betwixt it and the crofs, part 
of tlie vaults of an ancient tower is to be leen, from which, 
or f^me building of that kind, the weft end of the town is 
ftill, called the Caftlehill. 

It is highly probable t^iat Lathmon, the Piaifli prince, 
whom Offian celebrates, had his feat in this p,;r;lh. Not 
only do Lathers and Durlaihers' bear a Itrong relcmblauce 
to Lathmon and Dunlathmou, but the laiidfcape draWn by 
nature exaftly correfponds with the dtlcriptioh of the poet. 
We may oblerve on the bank ol the rivcr, *' tue green 
« dwelling of Lithmon." We may wander, with " the blue- 

ey'd Cutha in the vales of Dunlathmon j" and the halls of 
Nuath are only wanting to realife ttie delcription of the dy. 
ing Oithfna. " High walls rile on the baiik of Durranna, 
" and'fee their mofly towers in the llream." A rock alcends 
behind them with «« iis bending firs." On a tarm.,adjoining 
to Lathers are the remains of a Druid temple. 

A fpot of ground on the iouth fide of the town called 
Templc-bra&amp;, and a houfe called Temple feu give' reafon to 
fuppofe, that the Knights- templars once had a footing in this 
place. This is the , more probable, a', lonae of the old pro- 
prietors of this houfe, held their charters from tlie Lords 
Torphichan, to whom a confiderable pjrt of their lands had 
been given by the Crown, after the order of Knights-tem- 
plars was diflblvcd in the^ beginning of the 14th century. 
—Some houfes called Abbey-land, MaiJon-DieUy or houfe of 
r?fuge, point out the fituation of an holpital or alms-houle, 

founded 



39^ Sfatifitcal Account 



founded here In 1272-, by Alexander Cumin Earl of Buchan. 
This hofpiral was. among other., dedicated {^anHo Co^gano) 
to St Congani fuppofed to be the tutelary faint of the place, 
from whom one of the annual fairs held here is called 
Cowan Fair. It was endowed with an yearly payment of 5 
chald^rs of grain, inftead of the tythes of the Caftle of Ke- 
nedar. and a piece of land called Knockaibie. This piece 
of land., according to the defcriprion of its fitnation and 
marches, in the charter of foundation, comprehended all the 
lands, except Balmellic, prefently aftriaed to the Mill of 
Turreff. The hofpital was to contain a mafirer and 6 chap- 
lains, whofe office it was to fay daily prayers for the fouls of 
the dead, and who were to appear in the drefs of fecular 
monks. Out of its revenuss the mafter was appointed to 
furnifh with a dwclling-houfe, and to maintain 13 decayed 
hufbandmen from the country of Buchan. The holpital was 
to be a fandliiary for criminals ; but the mafler was bound to 
deliver up for trial all manifelt malefaflors ; and if any of the 
people of the lands belonging to the hof|.ital (over which the 
Earl of Buchan retained the right of criminal jurifdiftion) 
fhould be capitally convidted, their efcheat was to belong to 
the hofpital. This charter is dated at Kcllie, on Sunday af- 
ter Candlemas 1272, in prefence of William Earl of Mar, 
Lord Allan Hoftear, Lord Regenalde Chen, Lord Andrew 
of Garmack, Lord Philip of Melgredum, Meldrum of that

The prefent fchool-houfe was the Eplfcopal Chapel in 1 745, 
when a partv of the Duke of Cunaberland's army den^ohfli- 
cd the feats and pulpit, and were prevented from lettmg fire 
to the houfe itlelt ,by the interccffion of Mr Andrew Ker, 
who was then minifter of this panfh. 

About the beginning of iaft century, in compenfation, it is 
fuppofed of foioe privileges of which the feuers and inhabi- 
tants of T-rrefF had been deprived about the time of the 
Reformation, Lord Errol fettled an yearly falary of iool. 
Scotch, and 14 acre of land, for the maintenance of a fchool- 
mafter to jeach their children. This falary has been regu- 
larly paid by the proprietors of Delgaty, who have the right 
of prefenting to the office. As none of the other heritors 
contribute in any manner to its fupport, the fchool cannot 
be denominated parochial. As leffion-clerk, the fchoolmaf- 
ter receives an annual falary of 2 1. 4 s- 5 J for regiftering 
a baptifm 10 d. of which the kirk officer gets one third ; 
and for proclaiming a purpofe of marriage, 20 d. of which 
the kirk-officer likewile gets one third, when the bride re- 
fides in the parifli. The fchool is at prefent attended by 30 
fcholars, who are taught to read Englifh at the rate of 2 s. 
and Latin and arithmetic at 2 s. 6 d. per quarter. 

About the year 1727, Mr William Mefton, formerly one 
of the profeflTors of the Marifchal College, but obliged to 
give up that place in 17 i ^, on account of his political princi- 
ples, commenced an academy in Turreff, for inftrudiing 
young gentlemen in fuch fciences as were then taught in the 
univerfities. This academy, which was quite unconnefted, 
with the fchool, continued to flourifh for leveral years. In 
an account of the life of Mr Mellon, prefixed to his poems, 
a duel fought by two of the ftudents attending this aca- 
demy, viz. Mr Gordon of Embo, and Mr John Grant oF

The poor's funds are managed by the kirk (bffion, which 
meets every fourth month, to dift;ihute to the poor a fum of 
money proportioned ro their neceffitirs, and rhe ftne of the 
fund. A d.fpofition to his effrds is generally required of 
every penfioner, previous to his being entered upon the roll : 
At his death, they are fold to defray the exj^ence of his fu-

Ihc number and neceffities of the poor were fo much in- 
creafed by the bad crop in 1782, that, to fupj ly them, bclides 
the ordinary coU^aions, fome nical fent by government, and 
20 1. fent by an tii.known hand, the leffion found it necefla- 
ry to take 40 I. from the capital ftock. By means of more 
liberal collections in the church, and partly by two legacies 
of 2G 1. each, and one of 5 I. which, agreeably to the will of 
the donors, were given to poor people not on the liftof pen- 
fioners, but who would otherwile have become fuch, the 
ftock is now equal to what it was before the year 1782.

Antwtt and Prefent Proprietors, Rent, ^c^Thc cftatc of 
Durlaithers, which had been long in the polTeffion of Demp- 
Iter of Auchterles, afterwards of Meldrum oi Laithers of the 
family of Meldrum of Fyvie, was afterwards the property of 
John Ramfay of Barra ; which, by judicial fale in 1722, was 
purchafed by Alexander Gordon of Auchintoul a general in 
in the Ruffian fervice ; whofe grand niece, Mifs Catharine 
Gordon of Auchintoul, is now the proprietor. In 1723 the 
€ftate of BalquhoIIie was fold by the Mowats, the proprietors 
of the antient Mount Alto, to Alexander Duff of Hatton, a 
man of great charader in the ciuntry. Lady Ann Duff, who 
was married to Alexander his Ibn, is lifcrentnx of BalquhoIIie ; 
and his grandfon. Captain Peter Duff, is the prefent proprietor 
of Hatton. 

In 1726 the eftate of Fintray, then the property of the 
Porbefes of Touchon, was bought by the late Lord Bracco, 
father of James Earl of Fife, thd prcicnt proprietor. 

The eftate of Torrie, which had remained in the poffef- 
Jfion of the Barclays for* 400 years and upwards, was /old by 
them in 1752 to the late Earl ot Fmdlater, at 10,000 1. 
whofe fon fold it to the managers of Gordon's hofpital and 
the infirmary of Aberdeen in 1792 at 21,000 1. Sterling. Ex- 
cept the lands of Fintray already mentioned, part of the 
eftate of Caftletown, which is the property of - William Ur- 
quhart of Craigfton, and part of the eftate of BalquhoIIie, 
all that part of the parifh to the north of the burn of Tur- 
reff, and eaft of the Doverne, called the eftate of Delgaty, 
is the property of Captain Francis Garden of Troup, and 
was bought by his father, Peter Garden, Eiq; from the late 
Lord Errol In 1762, at 20,000 1. and is now of rent about 
1400 1. yearly. In 1767 the eftate of Muirelk was fold by 
James Brodje to Alexander Dirom, Sheriff fubftitute of Banff", 
fliire, at 5700 1. whofe fon, Major Alexander Dirom, is the 

pre-

prefect proprietor. The eftate of Gafk. which belonged of old 
to the Forbefes, and more lately to the Fordyces. was fold by 
the daughters of John Fordyce of Galk to James Mackie la 
,769 ; who fold it to George Robinfon now of G.ik. writer 
to the fignet, the prefent proprietor, in 1781. This cftatc 
has been an independent barony of itfelf forfeveralcentar.es. 
It appears upon record, that in 1375* belonged to the lu- 
rins of Foveran, who flourifhed in Aberdeen(hire, in the days 
of King Robert Bruce. Afterwards it came into the family 
of Burnet of Leys. Thomas Burnet of Gaflc was killed at the 
battle of Flowden ; and King James V. renewed the gift of.thc 
lands to his Ton William, then, and on that account, declared a 
9I. land of old extent ; on whofe retour, A. D 1 5 I4, does the 
prefent proprietor of Gafk hold his freehold at this day. Oa 
this place is lately built a modern houfe. in a pleafant fi- 
tuation, beautified with planting. Within the laft 40 years, 
the land rent of the parifh is fuppofed to be doubled, and to 
have increafed more within that period than for 200 years 
before. This, among other caufes, may be afcribed to the 
praftice of giving an additional yearly rent at the commence- 
ment of every new leafe, inftead of a graffum, which was 
the general practice before the middle of this century. 

Thevalved rent of the parifh 1554591.25. 10 d. Scots; 
and the real rent, valuing meal and grain at 10 s. for each 
boll of 8 ftone Amfterdam weight, is about 2800 1. Sterling. 

Services, or work done by the tenant to the heritor in 
harveft, and on various other occafions, not improperly called 
bondages, alfo the payment of Oieep, poultry &amp;c. called 
cuftoms, ftill conftitute a great proportion of the rent 
of fome eftatcs. The commutation of thefe into money, 
which has already taken place in the eftates of Fintray and 
Torvie, it is hoped will be foon univerfally adopted. Exac-

Mxtent, Soil, Agriculture, The parifh contains 

about i5,8y6 Scotch acres, of which one third at leaft is co- 
vered with heath. The hills and heath ground being ndged, 
appear to have been under cultivation at fbnic former period; 
at leaft that partial kind of it, called balk and burral, which 
confifted of one ridge very much raifed by the plough, and 
a barren fpace of nearly the fame extent, alternately. A 
much greater quantity of this fort of land was in tillage be- 
fore, than fince the years of famine in the end of laft centu- 
ry ; when many entire farms, of a wet or late foil, were allow- 
ed to lie wafte and uncultivated. Since the introduaion of 
lime and agricultural improvements, the above method of ma- 
naging out-field land has been relinquiOied ; and fmall black 
oats, which was the only fpecies of grain (own in this kind 
of land, have given place to white oats. 

The current of the Doverne being lefs rapid below than 
above the town of Turreff, the haughs and meadow ground 
along its banks are more extenfive and fertile. Though the pa- 
rifli contains almoft every defcription of foil, that fpecies cal- 
led a light loam is moft common. Part of the lands in the 
Ticinity of the town lets at 40 s. per acre. The medium 
rent of land in the country part of this panlh is nearly the 
fame as in the neighbouring parifhes, and may be known hj 
confulting the ftatiftical reports of them. 

Compared with what it was 20 years ago, the ftate of a- 
griculture is now much improved ; at the fame time, the 
want of inclolures, the prevailing practice of keeping too 
great a proportion of land under crop, and the extent of bar- 
ren ground, fhow that much remains to be done.

preceding, their progrefs m .ft bt flow. 

For many years paft the powers of lime in promotmg yc- 
getation has been known, and the quantity put upon land, 
for that purpole, is annually increafing. But, long after its 
firft introduaion, the method of cropping land, after the ap- 
plication of lime, retarded rather than promoted the melio- 
ration of the foil. F.r a field after being limed, by having 
three or fometimes four crops of oats m lucceffion, without 
the afliftance of dung, was necvfTar.iy reduced to a more im- 
poverifhed ftate than before. But expene.ce loon taught 
the in^propriety of a praftice, which no doubt arole from 
confidering lime not as a ftimulus, but as a manure, and is now 
adopted by thofe only of narrow circumftances and whofc 
views reach no farther than a little prelent profit, or an in- 
demnification for the price of the lime. 

The quantity ufually given to an acre varies from 40 to 
80 bolls of powdereil lime *. It is, perhaps, a fortunate cir- 
cumftance, that lime has hitherto been applied to land fo 
fparin^ly, for 80 bolls, which is not more than what is ne- 
ccflary to have the defired effea. when accompanied with a 
proper rotation and interchange of green crops, would, by a 
contrary management, render the land unfit for producing a 
crop of an V kind. For fome years paft, the importation of 
ihell lime from England has been gaining ground \ which

the old iyften. of farming regains, h gives pleaLHfob 
|erve. that the fplrit of improvement is rapidly extending it. 
happy influence. The advantages of fallow and green crops 
are generally kno«rn, and the number of acres under turnip 
potatoe, and fown grafs is annually increafing. ]„ different 
parts of the parifh, farms are to be found, which exhibit fpe- 
cimensofextenfive improvement and Ikill in the manage- 
ment of them. Of thefe none has a jufter claim to be par- 
ticularly mentioned, than that of Haughs of Afhogle poffef- 
fed by George Gerard of Atidftrath. In the year 1780 
when his leafe commenced, the produce of the farm was hard- 
ly fufficient to nraintain the fervants and cattle neceffary to 
work it. Since that time, upwards of 200 acres, of which 
a great part was formerly entirely barren, and the reft in a 
very impoverifhed Hate, have been brought to produce weigh- 
ty crops of corn and grafs. The rotation adopted by Mr 
Gerard, is oats, turnip, and fown grafs for ihree or four years. 
The produce of this farm, which in the year 1780 was only 
900 threaves, amounted to 2700 threaves in the year 1790. 
By the melioration of the foil and pafture, the number of 
cattle has been increafcd, and the breed improved in the fame 
proportion. In 1780 the hill pafture, which could then main- 
tain a flock of flieep of the Scotch breed only, the medium va- 
lue of which did not exceed 6 s. a head, now maintains a 
flock of a mixed breed in the proportion of \ Englifh to \ 
Scotch, the wethers of which give from 18s to 20 s. each. 

In a fimilar manner, the farm of Mains of Torrie is mana- 
ged by Mr Irvine i and extenfive improvements begun by 

the

pdund of dcduftlon of rent, had no fmall efFe^V in regij- 
iating the price of that article, and keeping it within the 
i-each of the poor that year. For -many years paft, cattle 
have been the moft profitable part of the farmers ftock, and 
the ftaple commodity of the parifh. The number of black 
cattle, amiually reared in the parifh, is fuppofed to exceed 
what it was 40 years ago, in the proportion of 3 to i. Tur- 
nip and Town grafs, which are more commonly applied to 
rearing for the drover and grafier, than feeding for the but- 
cher, together with a greater demand from the Englifll mar- 
ket, have been chiefly inftrumental in promoting the breed- 
ing of young cattle. The parifh can fpare from 300 to 400 
yearly. Though the breed, both with refpedl to fize and the 
quality of wool, is much improved, the number .of fheep, 
kept at prefent in the parifh, is perhaps not above one fixth 
of the number which it contained half a century ago. 

The breeding of cattle, and particularly horles, would be 
tarried to greater perff-dlion, and attended with more profit, 
were the fields more generally inclofed. Though it can boaft 
of producing mariy excellent draught and faddle horfes, yet 
a great part of thefe, ufed in the parifli, is brought from-other 
parts of the country. 

By a f\ronger breed of horfes, and a more improved con- 
ftru£tion of ploughs, carts, and other implements of agri- 
culture, its operations are now greatly facilitated, and the 
increafing price of labour in fomie meafure compenfated.

Peat and turf are principally uled for fuel. Though there 
is very little of it in the parifh, moft of the people have a 
r'ght to mofs in lome of the neighbouring parifhes ; a 
Tight which heritors were formerly careful to fecure to their

peat at the rate of ics. 6d. for a /padis caj.wg, i e. for as much 
peat as can be laid and dried upon 480 ells fquare. The 
niore exuedirious methods of carrying on work do not now, 
as formerly, n^ake it neceffary to employ the whole fummer 
in bringing home fuel ; nor, fince improvements in farming 
began, can fo much time be afforded for that purpofe ; but 
the time necelT^rily conlumed in providing peat, and the dif- 
ficulty of obtaining a lufficienr luppiy in wet feafons, make 
this a very expenfive article, and point out the propriety of 
the late falutary repeal of the coal tax. 

Mr Garden of Troup, who in many refpcfls fhews a laud- 
able dcfire of encouraging agricultural improvements and 
promotmg the good of the country, has lately inclofed and 
planted with foreft trees about 600 acres of barren ground 
on his eltate in this panfh. Plantations of the lame kind, 
though lels ( xtenfive, have been made on the eftatcs of Laiih- 
ers, Muirefk, and Galk. At Balquhollie, called Hatton Lodge, 
there is a cordiderable quantity of wood of a more advanced 
growth ; but it will be long before the parilh can iupply it- 
felf with this article. 

One of the greatefl- difadvantages of this parifli is the want 
of fones ; ol- which few are to be found above ground fit 
for bnildinv;. and of which, there is only one quarry of any 

con(equence as yet dircovered. Hence the want of inclofures,

ind fubftantial houf«, for though they are more commodi- 
ous and fubftantial than in former times, except thole ot the 
more opulent farmers, very lew houfes in the country are 
built entirely of ftone. 

ManufaBures, e^-^.-Next to cattle and grain, the articles 
for which money is brought into the parilh, are iinen-yarn, 
either made of lint of the growth of the country, or ot fo- 
reign lint given out to be fpun by manutadfurers ; Itocki.gs 
made of wool given out by manu^adurers, or of wool bought 
by the makers and fold to merchants, called market or car- 
go hofe ; cheefe and butter. For lome years paft great quan- 
tities of the laft article have been bought up by merchants 
in different parts of the country, and lent to Edinburgh, and 

other large towns. 

About the year 1760, a carpet manufaaure was cftablifhed 
here, which was earned on with luccels tor ieveral years, and 
was not entirely given up till about 17^0. 

In 1767, Peter Garden, Eiq; ot Uelgaty and one Mr Ba- 
ker began a thread and linen manufacture, and alio laid out 
a field, and erefted houfes and machinery for bleachiug li- 
nen. The partners finding themlelves Infers, the linen ma- 
nufafture was dropped about ten years after. A manuiacturc 
of thread, which generally employs about id hands, is llill 
carried on ; and about 400 or 500 pieces of cloth were whi- 
tened at the bleathfield laft feafon. In the year ending No- 
vember 1793, about 666 yards of linen, and 6696 yards of 
harn or brown linen were ftampcd here for fale. Oi the 
firft kind, it is fuppofed that more than the quantity here ipe- 
cified, ar d of the laft, Icarcely one third, was thea made in 
the parilh. At prefent, one weaver only makes linen for laie on 
his own account ; the reft, as well as all the other handicraftf- 
men, depend upon the cafual employment of the country around ,

and have fmall pieces of land, which employ the greatefl: pari; 
of their time. 

That the attempts to eftabliOi manufaaurers in this place 
have hitherto failed, cannot be afcribed to any local difadvan- 
tages. Situated in a hea'thful and pleafant country, furroun- 
ded with a great extent of fertile and improveable land, ha- 
ving the command of abundance of water, and the privilege 
of nine yearly fairs, Turreff leems to be well calculated for 
carrying on any branch of manufafture with fuccefs. Being 
diftant only ten miles from the ports of Banff and Macduff, 
the expence of fuel cannot be mentioned as an obltruft on, 
which a fpirit of indullry and interprife may not eafily hir- 
; mount. 

Mr Geor^Tc Robinfon of Banff has revived the manufac- 
tury begun by Mr Baker; and Mr Kenp, near Turreff, has 
begun a thread manufadlory, on the eftate of Galk in the 
vicinity of Turreff.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1012028">MORTLACH</name> 

(CouNTT OF Banff.— Presbytery of StrathbogiBc 
Synod of Moray.) 

Bythe Rev. Mr Geo^g-e Gois^-DO-s, lately Minijer there, an.d 
now one of the Minijers of Aberdeen,</head>

<p>

Name. 

THE name is very ancient. About 800 year?: ago, in the 
charter given by Malcolm the Second to the firft Bif- 
hop of this early See, — and how long before, no body can fay, 
it was called Murthelack or Murthlac, much the fame as at 
preient. 

ttpnohgy. — The word is moft probably of Gaelic origin, 
derived from Ibmething local. Becaufe the church is in a 
deep though narrow valley, fome naturally enough think it 
a corruption of Morlay, Great Hollow. Others again chufe to 
bring it from mortis lacus, the lake of death ; alluding to a 
battle which was fought here, and which fliall afterwards be 
taken notice of. But this feems only a fancy of Buchanan, ahd 
is far fetched : More conjeilures have been made, and on the 
whole the etymology is doubtful : Luckily however, like ma- 
ny an obfcurity of the kind, it is of very little importance. 

Situation. — Mortlach is encircled by fix other pariflies, ha- 
ving Glafs on the eatt, Gabrach and Tnveravcn to the fouth, 
Abcrlour on the weft, with Boharpi and Botriphny towards 

the

the north; and feveral of thde. it is not unlikely, are the 
Pffspr.ng of the n.other church. It is in the county o. Ba.ff^ 
in the Commifl:.r.ot of Aberdeen, and in the province ot JVJo- 
«y ; lying nearly 50 miles to the weft ward, but a httle to the 
north, from the cny of Aberdeen, and about 30 fouth weft 
from the town of Banff, the capit.l of the (hire. Since the 
170^ It has been, by an aft of the General Affembly, in the 
prefbytery of Strathbogie and fynod of Moray : Before that 
time, tr was in the pnfby .ry of Fordyce and fynod of Aber. 
0een : And ,n a co.m.air^n with Fordyce, the mm.ltcr of 
Mortlach, it is faid, has ftiil a vote for delegates, from that 
prefb. tery, to ekft the profeffors of Divinity of Kmg's ..oilegs 
of Aberdeen, and has alfo Tome trull and management lu cer- 
tam lands or fums of money bequeathed to that univerfi. 

Extent, ^r.— The form of the par fh is irregular, and not 
cafily delcribed, fo as to be underftood. The belt idea of it 
would be obtained by a map from adlual lurvey. Its greateft 
length from the head of Glenrirmts t.. the oppofite eud near 
the Spey, that is from fouth to north, is eleven or twelve £n- 
glifh miles i and its greateft breadth from the banks of Do- 
yeron to the foot of Btirinnes, that is from eaft to welt, may 
be about as much. It confifts of the lands of Edinglaffic and 
Glenmarky, which are Lord Fife's,— of the Lordlhip of Au- 
chindown, Glenfiddich, and the greater part of Glenrinnes, 
the Duke of Gordon's,— of Dulianfide and a part of the 
Lordfhip of Balveny, Lord Fife's again,— and of the barony 
of Kinninvie, which is, and for centuries has been, in the 
poffeffion of a branch of the old family of Balquhan, and of 
which James Leflie, Lsqj the only refiding heritor, is the pre- 
fent laird, and makes a very good one, being kind to his te- 
nants, an honeft hofpitable gentleman, and an excellent 

farmer. 



of Morilac^* 



farmer Mr Duff of Dfumuir is likewift a proprietor iri 
IVIorrlach, having a fmall piece of ground in it, called Loch- 
end, n^ar the kirk of Botriphny. 

The arable fields, which, by a rough guefs, may be from 4 
to c ^houfand acres, lie ch.eflv pretty h.gh along the F,ddich 
and DuUan, two beautiful rivulets or on the fides of nils 
falling into thefe , or on the more gentle dccliv.t.es of the 
mountains. The lands of Gienmarky and Edingbffr^ are re- 
mote and disjoined from the reft of tht par.lh. Almall ftream 
called Mafkv, running with rapidity down the glen, meets 
with the Doveron near the noule ot Edingl, ffie, where that 
river takes a plealant winding towards Huntiy on the eaft* 
There are fome low' or haugh grounds, but not very confide^ 
rable. The extent of meadow grafs, coatler greens, moor, 
and hills,— which lalt arc in general covered with heath, and 
but little improveable except by planting, n)ay amount to 
about twenty times as much as the cultivated field* 

Lahdfcape. -^Thc appearance of the country is very fine* 
Variegated with hill and dale, wood and water, growing corns 
and palture covered with flocks, v looks both beautiful and 
rich : And even in Winter, the tree Ikirtiiig the river banks 
with their fnowy foliage, and the lofty mountains all in white, 
exhibit a divtrlity of view abundantly pleafing and grotefque^ 
Fiddich-fide is one of the lovelieft flraths to be feen in any 
country. There are fome landkapes, efpecially in Gler fid- 
dich, and about Pittyvaich, Tininver, and Kmninvie, which 
any one, who has a tafte for fuch things, will not grudge a 
dav's ride or two to come and fee They are a mixture of the 
fwect and the wild ; nnd furnifh a great deal of picflurefque 
and very rural fcenery : If a Fho-nfon or an Allan Ram- 
fay had lived here, t'^ey would have been famous in fbng*

What goes by the name of the Gianr's Chair, formed by the 
wearmg of the water of DuUan many an age ago, with a pret- 
ty httle cafcade, called the linen apron, and their furrounding 
drapery, is another. 

Soil and ^/V.~The foil is almoft intirely ohhe loamy kind, 
deep enough and fertile : Any exc eption of its inclining 
cither to {and or clay is fcarce worth the mentioning. THe 
air is pure and wholefome, though it is rather moid than 
dry ; and fair weather is fometimes enjoyed on the farms be- 
low, when there are fogs or rain, or perhaps fn ow, on the 
heights around : But this is no doubt more or Icfs the cafe 
in every highland fituation j though many a remark muft 
one make in an account of this nature, equally appliciSble to 
a fliire or even a larger dillridl, as to a parllh. 

Healthy Spirits, Ages, Isfc. — The writer of this kndws of 
no diftemper peculiar to the parifhioners of INJortlach ; nor 
of any, which can be faid, above all others, to be prevailing; 
and on the authority of a Phyfician, who has long known the 
country and the people well, he can with the greater confi- 
dence fay, that there are none. Here, as in other places, while 
many of the ailments of the more affluent j rocced from 
their living in luxury and too freely, to colds and toofcanty a 
fare, may thofe of the lower clafs be frequently traced. There 
are no inftarices of very extraordinary longevity : But many 
arrive at the age of 70, fome to 80, and one now and then, 
though rarely, to 90 or upwards. The inhabitants may be 
faid, on the whole, to be lively, a£live, and vigorous ; though 
from the backwardnefs of the feafons for feveral years, and 
other difficulties in the way of their getting a comfortable 
fubfiftence, both the fpirits and ftrcngth ot the ordinary far-

mer and the labouring man are weaker and worfe than they 
were, it muft be owned,— and owned with particular regret ; 
for fuch men, engaged with heart's eafe in the healthful pur- 
fuit of agricultural employments, are the very nerves and per- 
manent riches of a country. 

Springs. — Here are feveral fteel or chalybeate fprings ; and 
fome of them pretty powerful. One, in particular, near the 
old caftle of Auchindown, has been found, on chymical exa- 
mination, very much to refenible the Peterhead water, and 
to be as light as it. They are of ufe in gravelifh complaints 
and diforders of the ftomach. There is likewile, below the 
houfe of Kinninvie, a fpring of a petrifying quality, on the li- 
mits between Mortlach and Boharm, 

Rivers. — Fiddich and Dullan, the two little rivers of 
this parifh, have been already mentioned. Dovcrn is much 
larger than either of them. But Mortlach can fcarce claim 
any property in it ; as it only borders, for a few hundred 
yards, upon one of its extremities. Fiddich rifes in Glen- 
fiddich, towards Strathdon ; and Dullan, in Glenrlnnes, on 
the boundaries of Glenlivet. They join a little below the 
kirk, near the houfe of Tininver, and fall into the Spey a- 
bout 4 miles below. After their confluence, Fiddich is the 
name. Their whole run may be about a dozen or fourteen 
miles each ; and there is good angUng for fmall trout, in plen- 
ty, on them both. 

Ifl^^.— From the public road, leading from this to Botriph- 
ny, may be feen, on the left, in a den confined by two al- 
moa perpendicular hills, a fmall but deep lake, called Loch- 
park, the fource of the Ifla, which flows into Doveron in the 
parifh of Rothiemay. It is frecjuented by wild dugl^s, and is

above the Tea. from which it makes a good hnd nurk in 
faiUng into the Moray- irith, is above 2630 leet i aiid from 
its bafe, about i68o. 

^mdrupeds, — Befides the tame and domeftic quadrupeds, 
which are every where, here are foxes, weafels, hare;^, lome 
badgers and otters. In the foreft of Glenfiddich, there is 
abundance of red deers— a thoufand and more wi;h a 
few roes. 1 he farmers round it think them by far; 
too numerous: And yet 40 ^ r 50 of them fometimes m ore 
flock, with their itateiy carriage and branchmg horns, 
on the tops of thofe fylvan and romantic lulls, make a noble 
view. The Duke of Gordon has m lummer refideuce in this 
glen, as a convenience for fowUng, and taking a fliot at thq 
deer. 

£irij.— The (helter and accommodation of the woods bring 
together a great variety of fingm^ birds, makmg an aviary of 
nature, the m»rt mnocent and mel .-dious ot all, happy and un- 
confined. The black bird and thruOi, gold-finch, bull-finch, 
linnet, and robin, blend their notes, and compofe a delightful 
concert. Many other birds there are, but none of them un- 
common. The migratory cuckoo, green-plover or lapwing, 
and the fwallow, pay their annual vifit, and are always wel- 
come Tor the fportfman, there are moortowls or groufe, 
Lridse^, and a few fnipe : The black-cock alfo is to be me^ 
^'ith in Glenfiddich, and fome ptarmagans have been feen on

Population.— Vvom the lift of baptifms, and the recolleaioa 
of theoldcft refidenters, .t would appear that Mortlach was 
more populous 50 or 60 years ago, than it is at this day.

Barons of Exchequer, in the view of an approaching icarcity of 
grain, the inhabitants of every age .mounted to 2 1 69 ; of whom 
there were about 560 under t .vclve. Ten years afterwards, 
in 'he 1792, when again, in likr manner, exaftiy taken by

fuch numerous families were both but few. 

Of the above 415 houfes, farmers might be faid to polTefs

for finding the population, by multiplying the births by 26, 
feems from this inftance to be exceedingly erroneous, for the 
produa of fuch multiplication would not in the prefent cafe 
be the half of the reality. The decreafe in the laft 10 years 
is very obfervable, and is probably to be afcribed to the cala- 
mitous eighty two. The difference betwixt the 1766 and 
the 1788 in the foregoing table, the baptifms in the one be- 
ing more than three times as many as thofe in the other, willal- 
fo ftrike one : And for this difference no fatisfadtory reafon 
can be affigned. It is likely, that, in the latter of thofe two 
years, the effedts of the 1782, which reduced the country in 
general to much want and a train of confequent diftrcffes, 
were at their height \ that the grcatcft number of emigrants 
had then left the parifh, in fearch of employment and main- 
tenance, among the farmers towards the fouth or in the ma- 
nufadluring towns ; and that, after that period, they began to 
return, to find home more comfortable, and to increafe. 
Such is the attachment to one's native foil, that it is feldom 
deferted but either from necefiity or the gratification of an 
ambitious defirc i and as foon as circumftanccs will permit, 
or the paffion is cured, it is commonly reforted to again. Of

fon, will yield about 8 ftones of meal. Potatoes alfo are raif- 
ed, and found very ufeful. And there is fome flax ; the ex- 
periments of which fliow, that it might turn out a profitable 
article, if the management of it, after being pulled, were bet- 
ter underftood, and if there were a ready market. It is at 
prefent but a bye kind of a crop, and therefore negleded. 
Tor want of Ikill and attention in the grafing, watering, and 
milling, it is often much injured. Failing in fuccefs through 
bad ufage, it uojufily receives the blame ; and the farmer is 
difcouraged from extending his attempts. 

This panfh, which is a plentiful one, after fupplying itfelf, 
can, in the opinion of fome of the moft intelligent on this fub- 
jea, fpare, in ordinary years, about a thoufand bolls of bear, 
and five or fix hundred of oats and oat meal. The oat feed 
feafon is from the beginning of March, or fooner, if the wea- 
ther will allow, till towards the end of April. And bear is 
fown from the middle of April, to near the end of May. Bar- 
ley harveft, generally fpeaking, begins about the firft or fe- 
cond week of September ; and the oats may be faid to be 
reaped in the month of Odlober, though fomctimes earlier 
and often later. Ea^Iy oats, which have been much and be- 
neficially ufed fince the 1782, ripen almoft in the fame time 
the bear. After the winter fnows, however, or heavy rains,

there muft be the difference of 8 or lo days, at leaf!:, in the 
time of fowing, hi the different parts of this extenfive court- 
try ; and even the fame kind of grain, fown in the fame day, 
will be ready for the hook leveral weeks fooner in Balveny 
and Kinninvie, than in Glenrinnes and Glenmarky. In this 
view, A'uchindown and Edinglaffie have an intermediate 
place, being neither fo early as the two firft of thofe diftrias, 
nor fo late as the other two *. 

Cattle and PaJIurage.— As to the live ftock here, there will 
be about 2000 black cattle, from 300 to 400 horfes for 
plough, cart, and harrow, 4000 or 5000 ftieep, fome goats, 
and a few fwine about the mills and diftilleries. The black 
cattle are of the middle fized and bandfome highland breed i 
the ox from 5 to 8 guineas, and the cow worth 4 or 5, as 
the prices happen to go. Many of the farms, having plenty 
of fummer grafs, are well fuited for cattle and corn too. 
There are alfo fome very good fheep-walks, one of the befl: 
of which is in Glenmrarky. The ewes and lambs, which 
are moftly now of the black-faced Linton ibrt, fell from 5 1. 
to 7l. the fcbre and wedders much about the fame; But 
all fuch calculations muft be underftood with a little latitude, 
and as only there anc| thereabout. It is impoffible to make 
them otherwife. • The white-faced (heep, who may be ftiled 
the aborigines of the country, arc wearing put ; and yet, tho' 
fmaller, they are allowed by many' to yield both the fwer.ter 
mutton and the finer wool. Wool fells from iosj to 16 s. 
per ftone, according to the quality and demand ; but the 
ftone confifts, it Teems, of 22 lib. Dutch ; one inflance, 
among a thoufand, of the great propriety of fimplifying our

little praaKed here, though it would probably anf«.er very 
^ell. As a fpecimen, fome have lately been reared to the 
value of 15 I. and 20 1. Sterling. 

Woods — There are fevera! plantations of firs in Mortlach, 
and fome of them full grown, the property of Lord Fife and 
Kinninvie; in whole from 300 to 400 acres; and about the 
like quantity of natural wood, chiefly aller and birch. The 
oldeft fir- wood is on a piece of rifing ground, planred about 
60 or 70 years ago, then arable, and (b fertile as to be called 
the meal-girnel of Tininver, of which farm it was a part, and 
ftill is. It feems it h;\s then been the opinion, that a rich 
mould, if not necefl^ary, was at lead very favourable for lueh 
a purpofe ; though it is fince known, that firs will profper 
in wafles fit for nothing elfc. Some elms, planes, and oaks, 
have thriven pretty well. One old oak, in particular, in the 
Cr^ig of Balveny, though not a very large tree, has a refpcc- 
table appearance. The a(h, too, appears very congenial to 
the foil, and rtioots up luxuriantly ; and, amidrt the trees of 
native growth, there is a great variety of (hrubs, many 
of them flowering. There is, however, an ample fcope 
for planting here; and, when it is fet about, attention will 
ilo doubt be paid to the ufeful and beautiful larix. If coal 
be not difcovered, timber, as a fuel, will, ere lon^, in many 
parts of the parilh, be a much wanted fuccedaneum for the 
exiiauftcd moffes.

af pears from their dreis, their vivacity, their fecial and mer- 
ry meetings, their warm attachments, their keen rt-Centments, 
their activity on occafions, and indolence on the whole, their 
intelligence, and their love of their country. 

l^ames of Places.— The names of places, except fuch as are 
of late cultivation, are all Gaelic, and commonly delcnptivc 
either of the fituation or ot fonje noticeable circumltauce. 
Of ^his^ examples would be neetliefs. Let the two rivuiets 
fuffice. Ftd^tch, or Iiiodhtdh, means woody \ and its banks 
are almoft covert-d with trees. Dullarit or Tuilan, lignifies 
rapid; and it tumbles from pebble to pebble almollt all its 
pourle. 

Rent. — The real rent of this parifti, which arifes entirely 
from lands, is 2000 1. Sterling and upwards. Some neceli.ry 
information on this ht-ad havmg betn with-held, from a 
j[eal('uly of an improper ufe being made of it, it cannot be 
^xadtly ftated : But the valued reqt, as taken in the year 
l!6yo, is 3900 1. bcotch. 

Farm^houfes — There is neither town nor village in all the 
parilh : The whole is country. Tht Kirktown of MortiacK 
is only 2 or 3 houfes on the glebe, or about the church. 
The farm-houles are getting a more decent look than they 
had i and it is to be hoped they will yet mend in this re- 
fpeft. 1 hey are built for the moft part of granite ftone, 
and thatched with draw. A tew, however, are flared j and 
feveral gentlemen farmers, fome of whom have retired from 
the army, beating heir (words into plough fliares, have both 
their dwelling houfes and offices very fubftantial and com- 
jnodious. It were to be wiaied that heritors would be fome-

Vhurch, except about 30 or 40 Roman Catholics, perhaps

ment, is rare. 

Gef7eyalCharaaer.~^kz to the charafler of the people at 
large, much may juftly be faid to their praife. Like the 
people of other diflrifts, they are not without their faults ; 
and there are fome inliances of great worthleffnefs, almoft 
in every parifii, to be regretted. It here obvioufly occurs, 
that a miniiler may be induced, from various motives, to go 
to the extreme of truth, on the favourable fide for his flock; 
His regard for them may blind and mifle;id him j or, by 
condemning them, he may think that he obliquely condemns- 
himfelf; at leaO", if another did it, he might perhaps be led 
too readily to think fo. Few chufe to depreciate their own 
importance; few to diminifli the happy effcfts of their paf- 
toralcare; and fewer ftill are inclined to render ihcmfelves 
ungracious. Thus it may often place a clergyman in a deli- 
cate fituation to be obliged to charafterize his parifhioners ; 
and, though a man of honefty and refolution wouki, in any 
neceffary cafe of the kind, immediately determine that he is 
to fpeak or write the truth, yet fuch charafters, which in 
general will be found to be only an indifcriminate repetition 
of the fame and the fame good qualities, are ftirely to be re- 
ceived as probably partial. But, unlefs there be an egregi- 
ous delufion indeed, it can be told with pleafure and with 
the ftridteft impartiality, of the people of Mortlach, that,- 



of Mdrtlach, 425' 

with few exceptions, they are, and long have been, induftrU 
ous, honeft, neighbourly, fober, and humane; peaceable, or- 
derly, and affeaionatcly attached to^ the free and glorious 
conftitution of Britain ; decent in obferving the ordinances 
of religion, and rationally imprtffed with the great end of 
them all, as aiding and fubfervient 10 piery of heart, uprighc- 
nefs of condua, and purity of life. If fome of them b.e ftill 
too much given to frets,- or fuperUitious remarks, they are 
commonly of the harmlcfs kind. 

Inoculation One thing, however, truly to be lamented, is 

their yet too great diflike to inoculation for the fmall-pox, 
the negle£l of which, though ir is in ufe rather more than it 
was, makes this very infe£tioui- and virulent difeafe frequent- 
ly mortal; and it is the more difficult to, overcome lo uufur- 
tunate a prejudice, as, in a great degree, it has its ongm in 
confcience, however erroneous and mifinformed. But, it is 
to be hoped, both for the iake of their children, and as an 
expreffion of their thankfulnefs to God for fo gracious a dif- 
covery, that they and others around them, for they are not 
fingular, will loon fee this matter in another and jufter light, 
and chearfully, with a dependence on fuccefs from Heaven, 
embrace the benefit of fo kmd a mean afforded by Providence, 
They are, in general, much dilpoled to chearfulneis and con- 
tentment, but keenly alive to a fenfe of injuftice, rigorous 
exadions, pr any fpecies of oppreffion whatever. That they 
have a martial genius, there is little doubt j but our ordinary 
wars, it appears, do not call it forth ; for they are nut fond of 
a military life : Indeed, the bufinefs of a foldier is held rather 
in low eftimation among them. They feem to confider it as 
poor, diffipated, and flavifh. As to fize, ilrength, com- 
plexion, abilities, or any other perfonal or mental qualifica* 
tion, there is here nothing remarkable.

as in moft 6ther places, Is poorly rewarded for his trou- 
ble : Mr Alexander Thomfon, the prefent one, has beea 
long much efteemed as a teacher, and is a very defer- 
ving man. The whole emoluments, including falary, fees, 
a donation by Duff of Dipple, with perquifitcs as fcffion 
tierk and keeper of the regifter, amount to but about twen- 
ty guineas, for which, befides the other duties of office, a 
moft faithful chat-ge is takfen of 30 or 40 fcholars, at leafl,

Moires Burfaries. — There are four buffarieis at the King's 
College of Aberdeen for boys educated here, an endowment 
which is a great encouragement, and has been of important 
fervice to many young men iq the parifh, and merits parti- 
cular notice. It is a privilege indeed, which, for the fake 
of the pariihioners, will no doubt be alvvays mofl facredly 
preferved. They arife from 600 1. Sterling, bequeathed to 
the above univcrfity, between 30 and 40 years ago, by Dr Alex- 
ander Moir, an Auchindown man, and for fome time the parifli 
fchoolmafter, for the education of four boys annually at the 
College, from this fchool, to be recommended by the minifter. 
If two or more boys fhould happen to be lent at the^ fame 
time, the belt fcholar, other things equal, is preferred : But if 
only one goes, he is entitled by ufe and wont, and writings 
explanatory of the will, without any competition, to the be- 
nefit of this legacy ; if found or fit for being received 
at a college at all, and if attefted by the parfdn of Mohlach 
as a proper boy and from this fchdol, for there muft be one 
burfary to be given away every year. Dr Moir died in St 
Cro.x where he had rhade his fortune, which was handlome 
as a phyiician. *

for another buvfc to the boys of this fchool : And if af the 
fame time he could think of the fchoohnafter, and leave any 
thing for him, it might be of much utility, as an inducement 
to a proper man either to come or to continue in the place. 

The Poor — The number on the poors roll, at an average, 
is from 50 to 60, and the funds for their relief, being the pro- 
duce of all the collections in church, except the yearly 
one for the infirmary of Aberdeen, and the inrereft of 1000 1. 
Scots, a bequeft of the fame Duff of Dipple who left a thou- 
fand merks for the Ichool, do not exceed twenty pounds per 
annum : So it is only a fmall affiftance, and not a iupport 
which can be derived from them. But even in the 1782 no 
body perifibcd for want ; though many were on fhort allow- 
ance : With fome (avings of former years, laid out in pur- 
chafing white j)cafe, almofl: the only grain than to be got, 
and the help of fome meal from government, a fliifi was made 
to meet the fucceeding crop. And, moft luckily for the poor, 
the prices for fpinning linen yarn, the chief employment of 
the women in this part of the country, were then very 
high. 

Price of Provijions and Rate of Wages. — Provifions of all 
kinds are confiderably dearer than they were about 20 or 30 
years ago, fome articles a third, and others a half, and they 
are ftill rifing in their value. The prices at preient are 16 
much fimilar to thofe which will be mentioned in the neigh- 
bouring pariflaes that it is nccdlcls to be particular : And 
the fame may be faid of the rate of wages, whether for ar- 
tificers, fervants, or d..y labourers. Ot the three, however, 
farm I'ervants have come to the moft extravagant pitch. In- 
deed as to the labouring ihan at fixpence a day with his victuals, 
when marnt,d and witli a few young children, it is rather fur-

get work all the year round, unlcfs the winter ieafon be un- 
commonly mild : Much, efpecially for clothing, muft depend 
on the induftry and economy ot the wife ; and after all, on 
their fmall and honert earnings, one would imagine tlicrc is a 
portion of luch a bleffing, as, in the days of oid, there was 
in the widow's barrel of u.eal and cruile ot oil. 

Advantages and Difadvantages.—lt may be remarked as a 
peculiar advantage to this panlli. that it is plentifully luppli- 
cd With timber, botti tor tiic purpoie ot bujlding and tor all 
farming utculiis, chiefly withm uicif, and partij Irom its vi- 
cinity to the Spey, wuicu ilwats down couvenientiy and at aa 
eafy cxpence, ttie trees ot GlenmtJre and otlicr higaland fo- 
retb, on the banks of ihat Itately river : And, as to its natu- 
ral diiaGvantages, it has few or nime, but luch as are almofl: 
infeparable from an inland and mountainous fituation. 

Meliorations. — But, undoubtedly, the condition of the pep-  
pie mij^ht in many reipcdts be made better. 

S/rvices. — Services or bondage, as a part of the value of 
their lands, do {t\\[ dilgrace the rentals of fome of the heri- 
tors : And thoUj,h they are required with great indulgence, 
and not nearly to the extent of the obligation in their tacks, 
yet they hang over the heads of the tenants, like a depretfing 
weight, and ought moft certainly to be abolilhed. 

Multures. — Multures, or aftridlions in the way of thirlage 
to any particular mill, thould alto be reafonably converted, 
and done away. Tne tarnier would then go with his victu- 
al, wherever he pleafed, and have nothing to pay but to the 
operative miller for his trouble and cxpencc 1 hus it would

. i?Wj-.-~Our bad roads are a great inconvenience and a 
great lofs ; and very bad they are in general, except where it 
ahnoft impoffible to make them fo. They are much ne- 
glebed, and never will be tolerable, it is to be teared, till 
either the ftatute labour be commuted, or turnp ikes eftablifh- 
ed. The people turn out to this work with rclu^ance, 
becaufe they do not experience the benefit of it ; for, by 
unikilful management, the roads are often worle rather than 
better of ail they do: And the overfeer. loth to impofe a 
hardlhip on thofe who are generally his neighbours, or to 
offend them, is too eafy in his duty ; and, on the whole, thtir 
work is a mere farce. The difficulty of providing fuel is aqo- 
the evil. Cutting, fetting up, and leading home the peats 
and turfs occupy the gr-arer part of the fuma er, from the 
end of the bear feed to the beginning of harveil. 

Coals muft be the remedy for this. Even with our 
' prefent roads, it is allowed, by thole who have made the trial, 
that they are the cheapeft firing : And if the roads were 
good, ol", which would be better (lill, if one might indulge 
the idea of a canal, there would be a mod comfortable re- 
lief in this requifite article. 

Game I^^^f/.r— The game laws, though not immediately con- 
nected with agriculture or the neceffaries of life, are loudiy 
complained of, by numbers in this part of the country, as a 
heavy grievance. It is 'thought exceeding hard, that a man 

dar« 



, of Mcrtlach. 437 

Ci^rt not flioot a hare or a patridge, on his own farm or in 
his own garden, but like a poacher or a thief; and that o- 
thers may come and do fo at his very door, to his great mor- 
tification, and perhaps to tlie injury of his crop. 

Surely the tax on licences of this kind can be nb mighty 
objca for the revenue ; and. it aids in fuppgrting and rivet- 
ting this purle proud and unjult procedure. In truth, thofc 
arbitrary ads are the vlleft vcftige of feudalifm and ariftocra- 
cy now remaining m our free and happy land j and it is to 
be lufpcdted that Britain may one day ladly mourn their ef- 
fects : For nothing can have a ftronger tendency to ener- 
•yate and enflave the inhabitants of any country, than a prohi- 
bition of the ufe of arms, to which thele laws eventually do 
amount. In the time of need, they will neither know how- 
to load nor tire. And, it ever an invahon Ihould come upon 
us, we will be able to do but little in our own defence. In-

Balveny houfe may be admitted here, a large and mo- 
dern manfion, one of the feats of Lord Fife, and built by his 
father, about a quarter of a mile below the old caltic, which 
will be mentioned loon. It has a flat roof, and is covered with 
lead. , 

It is a pity that this houfe is fo ill fet down, and that it 
lias no inhabitants. Lymg naturally too low, the architedt 
has contrived to fink it lower ftill : And yet, with the aflb- 
ciation of life and plenty and chearfulnefs within, it would 
communicate the fenfation of a very fhewy and plcafant dwel- 
ling but, as it is, it looks folitary and forlorn. 

Within this century, the mode of living is much altered here, 
and not to the better : On the whole it is not fo lirengthen- 
ing. The drinking of whifky inftead of good ale is a mi- 
ferable change, and fo likewile is the very general ufc of tea. 
Thele put together have been exceedmgly hurtful both to 
health and morals. Hence too many bcconie iippters^ ne- 
gle£t their bufinefs, and go to ruin : And hence it is thought 
that conlumptions, llomach complaints, and a multiplicity of 
dilorders, which go under the name of nervous, are more fre- 
quent than they were. It will probably be confidcred as 
a pretty curious fa^V, that inftead of two or three tea kettles, 
about 60 or 70 years ago, perhaps one for the laird, another 
for the parfon, and a third for the fa£lor, there are here now 
two hundred at leaft But while thefe remarks muft be made, 
as impartiality requires, it is agreeable, on the other hand, to 
obfervc a circumflance of a very different afpecH;. Some time 
ago, the country hereabout was too much given to the indul- 
gence

gence of a litigious fpirit, a fpirit, which, wherever it prevails, 
will not fail to four the temper, wafte the fubftance, and cor- 
rupt the principles of honefty : But now a law fuit is fcarce- 
ly heard of among them ; and when any little difference a- 
rifes, they refer it to a friend or two in the way of amicable 
decifion. This happy alteration is owing partly to dear bought 
experience; and partly to the removal of a judicatory at 
Keith, a village within a few miles of them, where a fubfti- 
tute of the fheriff of Banffftiire was wont to hold his meet- 
ings and difpenfe the law, and where fome pettifogger or o- 
ther was never wanting to fofter, if not to inftil, an inclina- 
tion to a procefs, as often as he could. A bleffing when a- 
bufcd is converted into a curfe, and now the people 
find, that though they are farther from the court, they are 
-nearer to juftice. To Keith, they had frequent occafions for 
the poft office, or the {hop or the market, and if the fmal- 
left difputable trifle happened to be rankling them at the 
time, the coal was blown j and they came home, buoyed up 
by their counfel, with the aflurance of ample f^tisfaftion and 
all their expence, though the affair generally ended in their 
pockets being picked, and their peace and good neighbour- 
hood dcftroyed. A caufe not worth a groat, on either fide, 
has been known to be contcrted for years, through all the 
rounds of the moft quibbling and tedious forms, and to coft 
€ach of the contending parties pounds inftcad of the original 
pence. 

Mortlach, though it has not much to (how that it is a fa- 
vourite of the mules, claims a relation to two Scotch fongs 
of no little vogue, Roy's wife in A devallach, and Tibbjr 
Fowler in the Braes. There are fome old men yet alive who 
remember to have leen the heroine of the latter., bhe lived,

Antiquities 'and Families of Note.— There are two old 
caftles, in this parifh, well worthy of notice. Auchindown, 
or Auchindunc, and Balveny : And when a ftranger is 
travelling through this part of Scotland, for curiofity 
or pleafure, they deferve his attention, and willcontribute 
to his amufement. Lcfs than an hundred years ago, both 
were inhabited. When they were firft built, it is not 
known, or by whom. The caltle of Auchindune ftands 
on a green mount of conical fliape, over the Fiddich : 
Its fitu ition is bold and commandmg. In the central apart- 
ment of the building, there is a piece of admirable workman- 
fhip, in grand and gothic ftile. If has been in the pofTefEon 
of the family of Gordon fince 1535; and of that name, 
there have been both Knights and Lords of Auchindune. 
Before that period, it belonged to ihe Ogilvies ; and, with 
all its barony, was a part of the Lordfliip of Delkford. Bal- 
veny caftle is another very magnificent ftrudlure. It is pla- 
ced on a beautiful eminence, on the banks of Fiddich like- 
wife, a little below its confluence with the Dullan, and has 
a variety of charming fcenery in its view. Tradition calls 
the oldeft . part of it, for it has evidently been built at diffe- 
rent times, a Pidtifli tower. In days of old, it fuccefCvely 
owned as its mafters the Cummings, the Douglaffes, and the 
Stewarts i and, after them, paffing through feveral other fa- 
milies in the i6th and 17th centuries, it became the proper- 
ty of Duff of Bracco about the year 1687, and is now the 
Earl of File's. In the 1446, there, was a Lord Balveny of

fefiivity and triumph. Many of diflinguifhed fame, though 
chiefly as warriors, have dwelt within them, for warlike feats 
were almoft the only accompliihments, which, in the days of 
their glory, conferred renown. 

There was another old building here, though of inferior 
note, at Edinglaffie : Oue occurrence about it, however, is 
very memorable. In 1690, the ye^ir of the eng?igement on 
the haughs'of Cromdale, iome of the highland clans, on 
their march from Strathfpey, through Mortljch to Strathbo-

day, burnt this houfe : For which, the laird, whole name was 
Gordon, took his opportunity of revenge, in their return a 
few weeks after, by feizi.ng eighteen of them at random, and

On the declining fide of a hill, bordering upon this parifh, 
betwixt Glenrinnes and Glenlivet, the battle of Glenlivet 
was fought, on the 3d of Oftobar 1594. The Earls of 
Huntley and Argyle were tlxe leaders of the two armies, of 
whom the latter, according to fome accounts, brought io,cco 
men to the field. Huntly was viiflorious, though his num- 
bers were, It is faid, but as i to lo. Many a gallant m"aa 
was killed. Adam Gordon's cairn, on the iide of the burn 
of Altonlachan, is a tefiimony of the place on which he fell. 
He was Sir Adam of Auchindune, and Huntly's uncle. Ar- 
gyle was only 19 years of age, of a refolute and noble fpirit,

Battle of Mortlach. — In the year 1016, Malcolm II, ob- 
tained, in this parifti, that fignal viftory over the Danes, 
which has ever fince given the place a fuperior degree of 
fame, and makes it refpecled as clafiic ground. Human na-

returns upon them from the Ibuth, with a powerful force j

^ard to give him battle. The armies get their firft fight of 
one another not far from the church of Mortlach and a 
very little to the northward of it they engage. In the be- 
ginning of the attack, while pufhing on with too ardent an 
impetuofity, Kenneth, Thane of the Ifles ; Dunbar. Thane 
of Laudian ; and Graeme. Thane of Strathern, are unfortu- 
nately flain. On the Ipfs of three of their generals, the 
Scotch are ftruck with a panic, an4 go into ccnfufion. Every 
thing was now in a moft doubtful fufpenfe, and too likely to be 
decifive. The King, who has the charaaer o( a brave, fenfi- 
ble, and pious man, is moft reluaantly borne along with the 
retreating croud, till he was oppofite to the church, then a 
chapel dedicated to Molocus. The narrownefs of the paffagc 
here abated a little the career of the purfuing Danes ; the 
flying army got a minute to breathe ; and, from the very fi- 
tuation of the ground, were again almolt necefiarily qoUea- 
ed. On a mere incident, a prefence of mind, or a happy 
thought, under providence, often depends the fate of war. 
The monarch was feized, .perhaps from the very appearance 
of the confecrated walls in that aera of fuperltition, with a 
devotional impulfc. He prays, pays his homage ^o the Virr 
gin Mary, and the tutelary faint, according to the manners 
of the times, makes a vow, is iiifpired with a confidence of 
the aid of Heaven, and addr^flcs himfelf, in an animating 
fpeech, to his countrymen and fellow foldiers, It was the

Danes were a cruel enemy. He Immediately takes the lead j

out a-ccrtain degree of enthufiafm, there is nothing great to 
be done. The charge, without delay, is generally and vigo- 
roufly renewed *, and, under the mingled influence of patr'N 
ctifm and religion, the Scotch carry every thing before them^

and w,n the day : And a bloody day it is reported to have 
been, though a glorious one, lor Malcolm and his vidoriou? 
troops. Some think that, for conveying its celebrity to fu- 
ture ages, was erefted the ftately obelinc ftill {landing at For- 
res. Certain it is, that Toon after the Danes finally left th.^ king- 
dom. There is an appearance, that the fecond and finifliing 
conflia, after rallying, happened a few hundred yard^ to the 
fouth weft of the Caftle of Balveny ; and probably the more 
ancient part of that building was then in exiOence ; for a 
fort is mentioned as near the field of battle. Perhaps it 
will be expeaed, that the flratagem of ftopping the courfe 
Dullan for a night fliould be t^ken notice of here, and 
the letting it down in a prodigious torrent on the furprifed 
Danes, thought to have been - drawn up on each fide of this 
little river, by which their army is faid to have been divid- 
ed, and to have, become an eafier conqueft. Such a thing 
may have been, and, from the prefent.face of the ground, is 
not incredible ; for the rivulet runs, about an Englifh mile 
above the church, ia a very contraftcd channel, between 
high rocks ; and beyond that there is a moft capacious bafon, 
for the water to flow quietly back for a long time indeed. 
Eut if fuch a manoeuvre was pradtifed at all, it is more likely 
that it. had been on Tome other occafion than that of the en- 
gagement jaft now related. See ForJun, Boece, &amp;c.

Situation and Name. 

FORRES, a royal burgh, fituated upon the Moray Frith, ; 
gives name to this parifh It lies in the fynod of Moray, 
and is the leat of the prelbytery of Forres. Forres, as an- 
tiently written, is of Celtic origin, ffgnifying its fituation up- 
on the fca. 

Et(tent and Boundaries.— T^t form of this parifh is irregu- 
lar, approaching neareft to a triangle, with a ftripe of moor- 
iih and hill ground, about three miles in length, ftretching 
from one corner. It is four miles in length, and about two and 
one half in breadth bounded upon the north by the bay 
of Findhorn, a large bafon of lhallow water, formed by the 
meeting of the tide and the river Findhorn ; on the north- 
caft by the parifti of Kinlop ; on the eaft and fouth by the 
parifli of Raflford. On the fouth-weft and noith north- weft, 
by the river Findhorn, which divides it from the united pa-

climate, ,s mfenor to no part of Scotland. The air is dry 
ferene and healthy. The tovvn. being built upon a rifinJ 
ground, about a mile from the Bay of Findhorn, commands 
an extenfive profpea of a rich and well cultivated country 
mterfperfed with the feats and improvements of many of the 
neighbouring proprietors. Lefs rain falis here than in moft 
^ther parts of the kingdom, the fliowers being attrafted by 
the Moray Fr.th on the north, and on the louth, by the hills 
which divide Moray from Strathfpey. 

Church and Stipend —Tht value of the living is 98 bolls 
of bear, 20 bolls of meal, and 490 pounds Scots, a glebe of 
4 acres, and manfe and ofijce houfes. The Earl of Moray 
is undoubted patron. The church was built in 1745. Its 
dimenfions, within walls, are 72 by 36 feet ; and it contains 
1800 people. 

The heritors of the parifli are the Earl of Moray, Sir 
James Grant of Grant, Robert Urquhart of Bandfyards, 
j^lexander Penrofe Gumming of Altyre, John Gordon of 
Grufliop, Dunbar of Grarye, Lcflie of Balnegeith, Urquhart 
of Tannachy, and Mr Strahan of Druimduan, with fome 
fmall proprietors, holding of the town of Forres. 

All thffe, except Lprd Moray and Sir James Grant, have 
^hcir refidences within the parifh. 

Population. — From an iftual furvey Kitely made, the num- 
ber of inhabitants was found to be 2987 ; of which number 
Jhere are.

The number of inhabitants in 1774, appears, from a£lual

of population of 194. 

The number of births, during a period of 1 1 years, from

being in the proportion nearly of 41 to 40, and the average 

Upon an average of the laft 1 1 years, the number of mar- 
riages of perfons refiding in the pai-ifli is 15 annually. 
. There are many perlons now living in the parilh of 80, 
but none whole age exceeds 92. 

There are i8 rarmers refiding in town, and 43 in the

Trade,— There are in. Forres 60 merchants and fliop- 
keepers, Theie were formerly pruicipally fupported l^y tra- 
velling and vending their goods in all the villages and mar- 
ket towns to the weft and north, particularly Suthei land,

can retail their goods nearly upon as low terms as the mer^ 
chants of Forres. 

Mafwers.- ^hont 50 years ago there were only 3 tea- 
kettles in Forres ; at prefent there arc not lefs than 300." The 
blue bonnets of Forres were then famous for good credit, 
and at that period there were only 6 people with hats in the 
town ; now above 400. Happy for our country did we 
keep pace in virtuous improvement, with the extravagant re- 
finement adopted in drefs and manners. About 30 years 
ago, 30 s. would have purchafed a complete hoHday fult of 
clothing for a labouring fervant ; according to the prefent 
mode of drefs, it will require at leaft 5 1. to equip him. 

Rate of JVnges.— About the year 1750, a fervant engaged 
for harvert had 4 d. a day with his viduals ; now 10 d. with 
two meals. For the whole time of harveft then, he had 10 s. 
BOW 25 s. A journeyman mafon had then i merk Scotch, 
without viftuals, now 20 d. A labouring man fervant had, 
at the above period, 15 s. 4 d. ; now from 2 1. los. to 
3I. I OS. in the half year. A woman fervant then had 
8 s. and 4d. and fome 10 s. half yearly j now from i8s. 
to 21 s. 

Ecclejiaflical State. — There are no fedVaries in Forres,, ex- 
cept a few Seceders. They are not upon the increafe. 

ProduBions of this Parj/Ij, — The foil and climate of this 
parifti will produce any crops that can be raifed in any part 
of Scotland. Harveft begins the firft'week of Auguft, and 
towards the end of that month, even during the late rainy 
feafons, it becomes general. It is no uncommon thing, in

Poors Funds.— hhont 125 perfons receive charity from the 
church and poors funds, many of whom are heads 0/ fami- 
lies. Amongft thefe there is annually divided about 40 1, 
arifing chiefly from the collections made at the church doors. 
But the poors funds have been lately conliderably augment- 
ed by a donation (eft by the Rev.' Mr Alexander Watt, late 
minifler of this parifh, of about 200 1. Befides the above 
fums, there is 15 l annually divided amongft the poor of For-

Schools. — In the town of Forres there is a grammar fchool, 
with a falary of 20 1. 5 and, from the abilities and attention 
of the prefent teacher, it has acquired a great charaarer. 
Latin, Greek, French, and the various branches of the ma- 
thematics, are taught with great fuccefs ; and a young gen- 
tleman may have board and education for 20 1, per annum. 
Befides the falaries given to the public teachers, the Magi- 
ftratcs give fome fmall donations to thofe who ketp private

There is likewife an EnglKh fchool, feparate from the gram-

every encouragement from the magiftrates that can render 
his fituation comfortable. '1 he price of education in this 
town, as in every other part of Scotland, is very low. The 
learned languages are taught for 2 s. 6d. per quarter; En^- 
lifti for I s. 6 d. per ditto. 

There is likewife a boarding- fchool for young ladies, where 
the various branches of needle work, mullc, and other parts 
of female education, are taught with great fuccefs. The 
miftrefs has a falary of j6 1. per annum fr6m the town ; and

tention is paid to the morals of youth in thefe different fe- 
minaries of learning ; and from the abilities of the prefent 
teachers, and attention paid to the fchools by the Magiflrates, 
ami the healthy fituation of the town of Forres, there is not, 
perhaps, a more eligible place for the education of youth any 
where. 

Rivers and F'lflj, — In this parifh there are no frefli water 
lakes, and the river Findhorn and the burn of Forres are 

t 

the only ftreanis in the parifh.' The fifh found in the river 
and bay of Findhorn, are falmon, trout, eels, flounders, and 
abundance of haddocks are taken in the Frith, which fup- 
pliqs the town of Forres and the neighbourhood. The qtian- 
tiiy of falmon exported from Forres, upon an average of 10 
years, from 177310 1783, was about 300 barrels annually, 
befides the hotiie confumpt, which is not very confiderable,. 
Since the 1783, the quantity of falmon taken is cor.liderably 
lefsi but laft year, 1792, the fifhing of the Findhorn h-.s

The pr.ce of falmon is 4 d- and for trout A. per lib. 

Nu.knt.on. eif.-The river Findhorn is navi.abl. for 
boats L farther thnn the tide flows, But did the uKreal, 
of commerce and manufadlures require it, ..here is no p ace 
where a cana. m^ght be more eafily made ^ 
the mouth ot the Bay of F.ncihorn, wh.cix ,s the lea poft of 
Torres, the diftance does not exceed 3 m,'.„ and tue tiUc 
flows in the bafon more than half that diftance ; and the le- 
vel ot the ground, at the foot of the eminence on which the 
town of f orres ftands, does not exceed ihf level of half tide 
by 14 fetf ; and that depth of a canal would carry boats 
and lighters at high water to the town , and fuch a canal 
would have the advantage of the burn of Forres to k^^ep it 
clear. The bafou already n,entioned is a triangular piece of 
low ground, p-.rtly of that kind of iV-^ clay ibil, cailtd cai ie 
ground ; and .partly of fine compact fand, mixed with light 
particles of earth waii^ed down by the floods. It is aii dry 
at low water, except the channel of the river, and a little 
fpace at the inlet at high-water. Its circumference wiU be 
at leaft ' 7 miles, and contains more than 2 fquare miles of 
ground, all of which might be recovered from the iea, ex- 
cept what is necefl'ary for a channel to the frefli water ftreams. 
A bar of fand, which ftretches acrofs the mouth of the ri- 
ver, prevents any furge from entering the bafon ; fo that an 
embankment would have no weight of water to lultain, but 
the fmall fetch of the lake itfelf. 

Liniejlone, ^c. — In all this parifli there is only one quarry 
of limeftone, upon the eftate of Mr Cuming oi Altyre. It 

not ufed in any great quantities. There is only one fmall 
patch of coarfe moor-ftone j and no detached flones are 

found

on m or about Forres, except what fupplies the town and it. 
Vicinny. 1 he (pinning of linen yarn has for 20 years back 
brought a confiderable lupply of money to this country. The 
fpinnmg of yarn, and manufaauring fuch of it as may be 
neceffary for domeftic purpofes, has employed a confiderable 
number of women, whofe earnings have been of great ad van- 
tage to themfelves, and beneficial to the public. The mer- 
chants are in the ufe of buying the yarn, and fending it to 
Glafgow, where there is generally a ready fale, unlefs the 
market is overftocked with Irifh yarn, which, only on ac- 
count of its cheapnefs, at certain times is preferred. But 
fmce the year 1784, the yarn trade has been gradually de- 
clining, owing to the increafe of machines for fpinning cot- 
ton in the fouth country, and the great quantities of yarn 
from Ireland imported into Glafgow, by which the price of 
yarn in this country has been greatly reduced. Many of 
thofb formerly employed in fpinning yarn for fale have of 
late taken to the fpinning of Dutch flax for the manufaflur- 
jng companies at Aberdeen and Invernefs.

,.ee The other dealers in that article fent at leaft 47,000

produced 7029 1. Sterling. The Truftees for Manufatoes 
and Improvements have given fome encouragement for the 
erefting of lint-mills in this neighbourhood, and thefe pro- 
mife to be of great utility ; and while they provide a proper 
and expeditious mode of manufaauring the flax, they wdl at 
the fame time encourage the raifing of that article m the 
country. Too much attention cannot be paid to this ufeful 
branch of trade, which employs thofe, and makes them ufe- 
ful to focicty, who would otherwife be a burden to the Hate. 

Rent.— In the neighbourhood of the town, land let fo high 
as 50 s. and fome of the fields clofe to the town at 3 1. an 
acre. Thefe are farmed by horfe-hirers, who lay them down 
ingrafs-, and, by the high wages they get for letting out 
their horfes, are enabled to pay this enormous price for the 
land.

Upon this eftate are very extenfive plantations of firs, in a 
very flourifliing condition, planted by the prefent proprietors 
and others, and which now yield a profit of lool. a year. 
There are likewife confiderable plantations of firs upon the

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q459768">KENMORg</name> 

(County of Perth.^-Synod^ of Perth an 
LING — Presbytery of Dunkeld;. 

By the Rev. Mr Colin Macvean, Mitiijle</head>

<p>

Name, Situation, Extent, ^c. 
nPHE name is evidently dorivt-d from the Gaelic Cean 
^ A mor, (pronounced Kenmore) in that language fignify- 
Ing great head : and is probably fo called from a beautiful 
head-land projeaing into the eaft end of Loch Tay, and on 
which the village and church of Kenmore are built. This 
parifh is fituated in that divifion of Perthfliire called Bread- 
albane, in the prefbytery of Dunkeld, and fynod of Perth 
and Stirling, On the eaft it is bounded, about two miles 
below the village of Kenmore, with the pariflies of Dull and 
W'-em i on the wtft, by a part of the pari Hies of Killin and 
Weem; on the fouth and north, by thofe hills which rife 
to a confiderable height from the fides of the loch, and bor- 
dering on the fouth with the pariHies of Comrie and Mo- 
nivaird, &amp;c. and on the north with the pariflies of Fortin- 
g )le and Weem. This parifli is about 7 miles in hreadtfa, 
and extends to the weft, from the village of Kenmore, on 
both fides of Loch Tay, about 8 miles, without any other 
pnriftj intervening. It is th*n im^rrfrdlrd, for a very /hort 
ipace, with Crannich, and pan of Aracrnaig, in the parifhes 

of 



t)f Kenmore, 



457 



of Weem'and Killin ; after which it continues on both fides 
to the weft end of the loch, on the north fide ; and nearly 
as far on the fouth. In a north-weft direftion from Killin, 
which is fituated at the weft end of Loch Tay, there is a 
beautiful and fequeftred vale, called Glenlochay, a confider- 
able part of which is in the parifh of Kenmore, although fome 
places of it are no lefs than 28 miles from the parifh church. 
Such of the inhabitants of this glen, and other parts ot the 
parifli, 9s are adjacent to Killin, attend divine fervice there. 
They have feats in the church of Killin •, and when any repairs 
are wanted, either for church or manfe, they perform car- 
riages, &amp;c. as were they parifliioners. Their elders have a 
feat in the kirk-leflion, and their poor are chiefly fupplied 
from the funds at Killin. It does not, however, appear, 
that their lands were formerly annexed, quoad facroy to that 
parifli. To Kenmore, alfo, belongs a imall part of Glen- 
quaich, which lies to the ibuth of the parifli, and is feparat- 
ed from it by a hill 5 miles over. The inhabitants of this 
glen depend for church privileges on the miffion of Amul- ^ 
ree. 

Lahs afid Rivers.— The only lake worth mentioning is 
Loch Tay^ which is 15 miles in length, and, in general, a 
mile in breadth, but two miles where broadcft. It is faid to 
be in many places 100 fathoms deep. This lake, which 
feldora or never freezes, abounds with falmon, pike, perch, ' 
eels, charr, and other trouts. The falmon are of an excel- 
' lent quality, and are found clean at all feafons. Lord Bread- 
albane has the privilege of fifliing them in the loch the 
whole year *. The principal river is the Tay, which iillies

^eous impulfe. The following copy of a letter, written by Mr 
Flemmg, contains a particular defcription of a phenomenon of 
tills Icind, which happened in the year 1784. 

MaK/e of Kemnore, Nov. 4. 1784. 

*' / »ot return from the excurfion on which I was when 
1 had the pleafure to fee you at Dundee, till laft Tuefday night. 
On my arnval 1 found your Jetter' refpefting the phenomenon 
that lately happened m this neighbourhood. Although ill qua- 
lifted to give you latisfadion upon this fubjed, I Ihall, however 
Comply with your defire, and give you the mott accurate ac' 
count of that phenomenon which I have been able to obtain. 

" On Sunday the 12th September, about 9 o'clock in the 
morning, an unufual agitation was obferved in Loch Tay, near 
the village of Kenmore. That village Hands at the eaft end of 
the lake, having the river, which there ilTues from the lake, on 
the north fide, and a bay about 460 yards m length, and 2co 
yards in breadth, on the fouth. The greater part of this bay 
is very fliallow, being generally no more than 2 or 3 feet deep ; 
but before it joins the body of the lake, it becomes fuddenly 
very deep. At the extremity of this bay, the water was ob- 
ferved to retire about 5 yards within its ordinary boundary 
and in 4 or 5 minutes to flow out again. In this manner it 
ebbed and flowed fuccefhvely 3 or 4 times during the fpace of 
a quarter of an hour, when all at once the water ruflied from 
the eaft and weft in oppofite currents, towards a lake acrofs the 
bay, and about the edge of the deep, rofe in the form of a great 
wave, to the height of 5 feet above the ordinary level, leaving 
the bottom of the bay dry, to the diftance of between 90 and 
100 yards from its natural boundary. When the oppolite cur- 
rents met, they made a clafhing noife, and foamed ; and the 
ftronger impulfe being from the eaft, the wave, after rifing to 
its greateft height, rolled weftward, but flowly diminifliing as it 
■went, for the fpace of 5 minutes, when it wholly difappeared. 
As the wave fubfided, the water flowed back with fome force, 
and exceeded its original boundary 4 or 5 yards ; then it ebbed 
sgain about 10 yards, and again returoed, and continued to 

ebb 



Kenmore. 459 

Roads and Bridges.— On both fides of Loch Tay are good 
tozds from Kcnmore to Killin. The one on the north fide 



was 



ebb and flow in this manner for the fpace of two hours, the eb- 
binos fucceeding each other at the diftance of about 7 minutes, 
and gradually leffening, till the water fettled into its ordinary 

•♦ At the fame time that the undulation was obferved in the 
bay on the fouth lide of the village, the river on the north was 
feen to run back ; the weeds at the bottom, which before point- 
ed with the ftream. received a contrary diredion ; and its 
channel was left dry about 12 feet from either edge. Under 
the bridge, (which is 60 or 70 yards from the lake), the cur- 
rent failed, and the bed of the river appeared where there had 
been 18 inches of water. 

" During the whole time that this phenomenon was obferv- 
ed, the weather was calm. It could barely be perceived, that 
the direaion of the clouds was from N. E. The barometer 
(as far as 1 can recoiled) ftood the whole of that and the pre- 
ceding day, about 2g~ inches. 

* On the next, and the 4 fucceeding days, an ebbing and 
flowing was obferved, nearly about the fame time, and for the 
fame length of time, but not at all in the fame degree as on the 
firft day. A fimilar agitation was remarked at intervals, fome 
days in the morning, other days in the afternoon, till the 15th 
of Odiober, fmce which time no fuch thing hab been obferved. 

" I have not heard (although I have made particular inqui- 
ry) that any motion of the earth was felt in this neighbour- 
hood, or that the agitation of the v/ater was obferved any 
where but about the village of Kenmore. 

1 hope the above account will furnifh an anfwer to moft 
of the queftions contained in your letter, if there be any other 
circumllance, about which you wifh to have farther informa- 
tion, it will give me pleafure to be able to communicate it.

was made by the prefent Jiarl of Breadalbane, foon after h. 
fucceded to the eftate, and folely at his own expence. 
Ihefe roads have hitherto been kept in repair by the fta- 
ture labour ; bur a propofal is now made to convert it into 
money. A more pleafant ride than that between Kenmore 
and KiUin, on either fide of the loch, is very feldom to be 
met with. Each of thefe villages is furnifhed with a good 
inn. A handfome bridge, of five arches, is built over the 
Tay at iCenmore ; and a great number of fmall ones are 
thrown over the torrents which defcend from the mountains 
into the loch, on both fides. Of thefe mountains, Ben- 
Lawers, on the wefl fide, is by far the highefi, being 401^ 
feet above the level of the fea, and is faid to be the fecond 
highefl: mountain in Scotland. While I write this, being the 
1 6th of May 1795, it is covered with new laid fnow, a con- 
fiderable way down its fides. It abounds with many rare 
plants, and is frequented by a great variety of quadrupeds 
and fowls *.

State of the Church and S./&amp;../.-The value of the living 
exclufive of the glebe and a fmall farm annexed to it which 
h incumbent enjoys by the beneficence of the Breadalbane 
Lily, for the rent of 5 s. yearly, is about 75 ^ The church 
and manfe were rebuilt in the handfomeft manner about 3S 
years ago, and are ftiU in-good repair. The church is ex- 
ceedingly neat and plain , it is built in form of a crofs and 
is ornamented with a fine tower fleeple. The manfe is large, 
handfume, and commodious. It is fituated on a rifing 
.round on the Touth fide of the loch, and commands a 
charming profpeft. Beneath is the village, church, bridge, 
loch, and the dilcharge of the river out of it. Oppohte is 
Drummond hill, rifing almoft perpendicular, and reaching 
to the height of about 500 feet above the level of the loch. 
This beautiful hill begins two miles below Kenmore, and ex- 
tends weftward 5 miles. It is covered, from one end to the 
other, with oaks, pines, larches, &amp;c. and forms a moft de- 
lightful and pidurefque objedf. The prolpea to the eaft of 
the manfe comprehends a confiderable part of Lord Bread- 
albane's pleafure ground, and plantings about Taymouth ; 
and is terminated by diftant hills. 1 o the weft is a view of 
the loch for about 5 miles, where it makes a bend to the 
fouth. Its fides exhibit a pleafing variety of woods and 
corn fields. The view beyond this is terminated by the 
lofty hill of Lawers, already mentioned. 

Having made mention of Taymouth, it may perhaps be 
expe£led that 1 fhould give a particular account of that place. 
This, however, is a talk to which I confefs myfelf unequal. 

Accurate 

plants. A non-defcript grafs, probably of the Poa genus, is 
found growing near the loot of the mountain. It is a beautiful 
grafs, and grows to the height of about 4 feet. This, with 
Ibme of the above mentioned plants, was lately difcovered by 
Mr John Mackay, an expert botanift, now in Edinburgh.

Befid« the parifli church, there is a chapel at Lawer, on 
«.e north fide of Loch Tay, where the minifters of Kan 
«.cre and Wee. preach occafionall,. Here the Soci . 
Propagating Chriflian Knowledge eftablifl,ed, in the year 
l7«o. a m,ffion, on a fund mortified by the late Lad, Gle- 
norchy, of which they have the managen,ent. Out of this 
fund one half of the miflionary's falary is paid; the hearers

Schools.^Th^ parochial fbhool, which is kept in the vii- 
age of Kenmore, is generally frequented by about loo fcho- 
lars, except in fumn,er and autumn, when many of the 
youth, being neceffarily engaged in hufbandry bufinefs, can 
not attend their education. The Society for PropagatinJ 
Chriftian Knowledge in Scotland maintains four fchools 
within the bounds of the pariih. Private fchools are alfo 
occafionally kept in different parts of the parifla, and their 
teachers fupported folejy by the fcholars parents,- At pre- 
Tent there are no fewer than four of thefe private fchools 
but the number of fcholars is not great. ' ' 

State of the Poor.-Tht number of poor upon the pariffi 
roll amounts to 40, exclufive of the poor of thofe parts of 
the parifh that are conneaed with Killin and Amulrec. The 
funds for their maintenance in this, as well as in all the 
neighbouring parifhes, arife chiefly from weekly collcaions

in the church, which, in this parifli, commumlus annis, a- 
xnount to 32 I. Befides this, they have 5 1. yearly, being the 
intereft of 100 1. which was mortified, about 60 years ago, for 
their behoof, by a near relation of the noble family of Bread- 
albane. They have alfo another fmall fum at intereft, which 
the kirk-feffion have been enabled, in times of plenty, to favq , 
out ot the funds. The noble proprietors already mentiotied, 
have, befides, been long in the pradiceof diltributing yearly, 
in the diftria o^ Breadalbane, from between 90 to ico bolls 
of meal, to widows and orphans, and to aged and intirm 
perlons in indigent circumftances, though not on the poor- 
roll- This meal has lately been converted into money, at 
}6 s. the boil. 

Population.— This parish feems to have undergone no con- 
fiderable change, with refpedt to popivlation, for Ibme tim« 
paft. The diftrias along the fides of Loch Tay have, froni 
time immemorial, been remarkably populous. In theft 
places, the tenants, in general, have but very fmall poflef^ 
£ons, feveral of them being crowded together in the fame 
farm. And although it is certain that the noble proprietor 
might incrcafe his rent-roll confiderably, by enlarging the 
pofleffions and leffening the number of tenants, yet, knowj- 
ing their attachment to their country, he allows them to re- 
main in the abodes of their forefathers. The only villages 
in the parifti are Kenmore and Sironfernafi, the latter of 
which was built a few years ago, and confilts of about 24 fa* 
mili.es. 

It appears, by the return made to Dr Webftcr in the year 
j['755, that the population of the parifli was then 3067. B;^ 
. a furvey taken in 1794-5, the population amounts to 3463. 
Of thele 152c are males, and 1943 are females The ave- 
rage number of n^ryiages yearly is 24, and of births 60. 

The 



'^^4 Statijlical Acccuni 

The number of burials is uncertain, as there are no lefs than 
6 burying places in the parilh ; and no regifter of burials 

In the parifh are 63 weavers, 38 taylors, 36 wrights, 26 
fhoemakers, 20 flaxdreffers, ,0 fmiths, 9 mafons, 8 coopers 
4 hofiers, and i dyer. In the above lift apprentices and 
journeymen are included. 

Agriculture and HuJbandry.-JTht richeft and beft cultivat- 
ed land in this country extends nearly a mile in width on 
both fides of Loch Tay. The foil, which is of a loamy tex- 
ture, has, in the courfe of time, been carried down by the 
rams from the higher grounds j and is enriched with the 
fpoils of decayed animals and vegetables. The hilly land 
chiefly confifts of a light mofly kind of foil, which naturally 
is not unfriendly to vegetation. Heath, bent, and coarfe 
graffes, are the general product of the hills and muirs ; but 
the vallies and water carried foils in the glens, &amp;c. produce 
good crops of excellent graffes. The grains chiefly cultivat. 
ed are oats, bear or big (four-rowed barley), beans, pealb, po- 
tatoes, and lint. The average return of oats is 3 or 4, and 
of barley 4 or 5. The return of hnt is commonly a flone

turn. The old fyftem of rotation, namely, the infield land 
with oats and bear alternately, and the outfield with oats and 
ley, is in general continued. Each farm is commonly /ub- 
divided among feveral tenants, a practice which does not 
merit the higheft approbatioji * Thefe tenants have each a 
feparate leafe or verbal bargain, the duration of which is 
moftly from year to year, at the will of the proprietor. Un-

der fuch a fyftetn, agriculture cannot be expected to make 
great progrefs. 

Horfes^ Cows, and Skeep.—-Ths Horfes, with which thi^ 
and the neighbouring parifhes are flocked, are of the High- 
land breed, and of about 12 ^or 13 hands high. They are 
very hardy, and eafijy fiipported. Their number, in this 
parifh, is 926. The cattle are alfo of the Highland kind ; 

are kept principally for breeding, and amount to 3028 » 

The number of flieep in the parifli amounts to about 1 1,480. 
They are of the black-faced breed, which, for about half a 
century paft, have gradually fucceeded the antient High- 
land, or native kind, a few of which yet remain in fome 
places in the neighbourhood. The above numbers of the 
live ftock are exclufive of followers. Some trials have 
lately been made to introduce the Cheviot breed of Iheep. 
Lord Breadalbane, a few years ago, complimented (bme of 
his principal tenants with a few of the Cheviot fiaeep, by 
way of trial. But none of the fheep graziers have difcover- 
ed any inclination to ftock their farms with them, in prefe- 
rence to the black-faced kind; 

Renidl.— The real rent of the parifh may be about 2800 1. 
Sterling, The value of land has r;fen confiderably thefe 
laft 12 years, in confequence of the rife in the price of Iheep 
and black cattle. The produce of the parifh is fuppofed to 
be rather more than tvhat is fufficient for the conlumpt of 
the inhabitants. 

Jniiquiiies.^On a fmall iflahd, at the weft end of Loch 
Tay, are the ruins of a priory dependent on the religious 
^ftablifhment 6f Scone. It was founded in the year 1122 
by Alexander L of Scotland, in which were depofited the

Several Druidical temples have, in this parifh, furvived 
the wafte of time ; and the more deftrudlive delapidations of 
the incurious and avaricious. One, perhaps the largeft and 
moft entire of any in Scotland, yet remains about two miles 
down from Kenmore, although not in that parlfli. It is. 
about 60 yards in circumference, and confifts of three con- 
centric circles. The ftones in the outermoft are not fo large 
as thofe in the inner circles, and are not, like them, fet on 
end. In this parifh are feveral Tiobaits, or wells, the wa- 
ters of which were, of old, fuppofed to be poffefTed of heal= 
ingquahties; fome were good for the toothach ; fome for 
fore eyes, &amp;c. Now, however, they are very feldom vi- 
fited *.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124640">KINLOGH</name> 

(County of Perth— Synod op Perth and St 
LING — Presbytery OF Dunkeld).

Name, Extent, Situation, Surface, Soil, b'r. 

KINLOCH takes its name from its relative fituation to 
the loch hard by it ; the word, in the Gaelic lan- 
gu,.vc,.fignifying the head of the loch. The parifh is about 
9 miles in length, from the rorth-weft corner to the fouth- 
eaft corner ; and one mile and a half is its greateft breadth 
from eaft to weft. The parifh church is di/lant from Perth, 
on the fouth, about 15 miles ; from Dunkeld, on the weft 
about 9 miles ; from Coupar-Angus, on the fouth- eaft, about 
41 miles ; and from blairgowrie, on the eaft, about a mile 
and a half From the lakes and fl;u lying grounds to the 
fouthward of the church, the ground rifes in elevation for 
feveral miles to the norrhward. The fourhern expofure, the 
flielter from the high grounds to the northward, the" beauti- 
ful lakes in the valley below, the plantations of wooden 
the eftate of Marlee. and the other plantations and gentlc- 
mens feats in the neighbourhood, all confpire to render the 
lower part of this parifli a beautiful part of this country. 
The foil, though in general good, is of various qualities and 

denomina-

geminations, from rich to poor, mortary. loamy, and fan- 
Jy foils. 

Uhs, Brooh, eff^.-Thopgh there is a great number of 
fmall brooks in this parifh, there are only two large ones, 
viz. Lornty^burn, and Lunen-burn. The former cuts the 
parifh acrofs from weft to eaft. On it there is one corn- 
mill. The latter is the boundary of the parifh on the fouth- 
eaft' On it there is another corn-mill in the parifh. There 
are ' three lakes or lochs in this parifh, viz. the Loch of 
Drumelie, the Rae Loch, and the Fenzies Loch, all the pro- 
perty of Mr Farquharfon of Invercauld. Drumelie Loch 
is fituated a little to the weflward of the houfe of Marlee; 
the Rae Loch about a quarter of a mile to the eaftward of 
it and the Fenzies Loch about a mile to the fouth-eaft of 
the houie. Thefe lochs abound in pike, perch, and eel. la 
Dvumelie loch are alfo to be had trout of a fuperior fize and 
quahty. In this loch, and in Lunen-brook which iffues from 
it and which communicates with a number of fine lakes to 
the weflward, are to be found trout in good order, that is 
fat, earlier in the feafon, than in any other brook, river, or 
lake in this country. This brook has a rich muddy bottom, - 
in which there is plenty of flick-worm, (a fpecies of food 
which the trout peculiarly delight in), and as there is very 
little current in the brook, that food is not fo apt to be fwept 
away by the fwelling flood, as it is in brooks and rivers where 
there is a flrong current. 

Marl, ^c.—in two of thefe lakes, there is ^ valuable 
trcafure of rich fhell marl. In the mofs or marfh which is 
connefted with the Rae Loch, there is a marl-pit, the firfl: 
that was opened in this country. It was partially drained, 
, and opened for public fale, about the year 1734. The drain 

has 



/

has been deepened by the prefent proprietor at different pe. 
nods of time, and at very great expence. The Fenzies 
Loch has alfo been partially drained, and a great quantity of 
marl has been taken out of it by means of boats and nets- 
This loch has every where a marly bottom, and the marl is 
m many places of a very great depth. The falcs of marl at 
thefe pits have been very extenfive j and the advantages de- 
nved, not only to the proprietor of the marl, but alfo to 
all the proprietors of land in this neighbourhood, and to 
their tenants, have been very great. And thefe advantages 
would have been much greater had the proper method of 
cropping lands, when they werefirft marled, been rightly un- 
derftood. Let it be obferved, that there feems to be a natu- 
ral and neceffary connexion betwixt fpring water and fhell 
marl : For, with refpeft to both the marl- pits above nam- 
ed, and all other marl-pits which the writer of this ftatifti, 
cal account has feen, a much greater quantity of water ilTues 
from the refpedive pits than the quantity that runs into 
them ; at leaft than the quantity that runs fuperficially into 
them ; and becaufe, notwithftanding of repeated trials, this 
writer has never yet feen marl found in any pit, marfh, or 
lake, into which as much water is obferved to run, as that 
which runs out of it. With refpcft to the fituation of marl- 
pits, let it alfo be obferved, with relpedt to thele in this pa- 
rifh, with refpeft to all the marl-pits in this country, and 
perhaps in every other country, that the circumjacent ground 
rifes from the pit on all fides, excepting that one by which 
the water ifTues from the pit. By attending to thefe two 
obfervatjo»s, a great deal of trouble may be faved in the 
courfe of fearching for mar] ; and marl may be eafily found 
in countries where it is not yet known. 

Marl, as a manure, operates chiefly upon the earth by fe- 
parating its parts, rendering it more penetrable to the roots 

of 



of Kinloch, 



47 1 



of plants, and thereby giving them accefs to draw nourifh- 
ment from many particles of earth which did not contribute 
to their nourifhment before iuch reparation. Therefore, the 
more thoroughly that marl is intermixed or incorporated 
with the foil to which it is applied, the more extenfive and 
powerful muft be its efftfts. 

Marl can, with more eafe or difficulty, be pulverifed and 
incorporated with the foil, in proportion as the marl is rich 
or poor. The richer the marl is, the lefs it has of a cohe- 
five quality, and therefore will be the more eaiily incorporated, 
and the poorer the marl is, the more it has of a cohefive 
quality, and therefore will be with the greater difficulty pul- 
verifed and incorporated with the foil to which it is applied. 

Marl, though fpecifically lighter than the foil on the liir- 
face of which it is laid, does, by feparating the parts of the 
circumjacent earth, loon fink below the furface. And if it 
be allowed to fink in lumps, that is, before it be pulverifed, 
a great proportion of that marl will never afterwards be got 
thoroughly to incorporate with the foil. The moft advan- 
tageous method, therefore, of applying this valuable manure, 
in order to obtain the full benefit of the quantity apphed, is 
to lay it on the ground while under a grafs crop, and leave 
it expofed on the furface over the winter feafon. The 
thickly interwoven roots of the grafs will prevent any confi- 
derable body of it from finking below the fuj-face, till it be 
reduced by the winter frofts and rains, and, in fmall parti- 
cles, wafixed into the earth. 

If marl muft be laid on ground under fallow, it fhould 
be previoufly put into a compoft hill with earth, and, by 
mixing and turning, thoroughly pulverifed. 

Marl put into compoft with hot dung, will, by the juices 
of the dung, be rendered more clammy and cohefive than it 
was before, and more unfit for incorporating with the 
earth. 

If

If you fow flax feed for the fecond or third crop on marl- 
cd ground, that is, while the influence of the ground is mofl: 
powerful, though the crop will have a promifing appearance 
till the beginning, or towards the middle of July, when the 
plant is about 7 or 8 inches long, about this time, (under 
the ftrong influence of the fun), the fwelling and agitatioh 
of the earth, occafioned by the pc^werful operation of the 
marl, break the tender fibres of this plant, while in its 
quickefl growth, and caufe it to decay. 

Agriculture, b^r.—This parifli produces wheat, barley,- 
oats, peafe, flax, potatoes, and turnip. Clover and rye-grafs 
feeds are lown extenfively. Potatoes are planted in much 
greater quantities, than they were a few years ago. Befides 
their great utility for the table, they are found to be excel- 
lent food for horfes and black cattle, and are ufed as fuch. 
A light, dry, or fandy foil, is befl for potatoes. The pota- 
toe called the London Lady is the befl: of the early fpecies 
of potatoes yet known in this parifh. The red-nofed- white 
kidney potatoe, and the long-white-kldney potatoe, which 
are equally great or thick at both ends, arc the befl: eating 
of the late fpecies of potatoes ; and the lafl: mentioned of 
thefe is equally prolific with the common-late-round-white 
potatoe. The dark red Lancafliire potatoe, if planted in a 
very dry fandy foil, is more prolific than any other of the 
fpecies above mentioned ; it is alfo more folid, a meafure full 
of this fpecies, outweighing confiderabiy the fame mcdure- 
fuU of any of the others. The above mentioned different 
fpecies are the befl: of all the variety of potatoes cultivated 
in this country. It has been found here by repeated expe- 
riments, that the befl method of preventing potatoes from 
degenerating, and of rendering them more prolific, is to raifc 
potatoes now and then from the feed that grows upon the 

plants 



of Kinloch 473 

nlant The procefs is eafy, viz. take 3 large ripe apples from 
3fteniof your favourite potatoe. Prefervc them carefully 
from the wmter frolls. About the beginning of April pre- 
pare a bit of good rich garden ground. With a wooder* 
pole form fmall drills in it about an inch deep. Pick the 
feeds out of the apples, and fow them as regubrly as poffiole 
in thefe drills, and cover the feed with about half an inch 
depth of earth. In the mean time prepare another piece ot 
good rich ground; and when the potatoe feedling plants 
have grown about an inch high above the ground, carefully 
raifc them, with as much earth about the plants, relp a^ve- 
ly, as poffible, and tranfplant them into the other piece of 
prepared ground, at the diftance of 10 inches betwixt the 
plants in the row i and the diftance of 14 inches betwixt 
k;^t rows. Hoe them when needful, and taisje them up 
when ripe. If they have been thus cared for, you will have 
many of them as large as fmall hen eggs the firft fealon. 
And, if you plant thelc feedhng potatoes in good grvound 
next fpring, give them plenty of room, and take good care 
of them, you will, againft next autumn, find their produce 
arrived at the full fize of potatoes planted in the ordinary 
way. And from the feed of thefe three apples, you will 
have, the fecond year, upwards of 4 bolls of potatoes. An4 
thefe potatoes, thus railed from the apple- feed, will continue, 
for feveral years, morp prolihc tha^i potatoes which have npt, 
for many years, been raifcd from the apple-feed. 

If you plant the early potatoe called thp ^iOndon-Lady, or 
the early potatoe called the Glory of England, in ricii, ciry, 
warm lying ground, in the beginning of A^iril, your crop 
will be ready for the market by the 20th of July. And if 
you then drefs the fame ground, and plant it with the lame 
fpecies of potatoes, which have been kept over the winter, 
and, by lying in a dry well-aired place, and by being fre-

quently turned, have been prevented from fpringing toq 
rnuch during the preceding part of the fummer, you will 
have a fecond crop of potatoes on the fame ground, ripe 
againll the middle of o£lober ; and the fecond crop will 
be much richer than the firft, though, in point of qualit^', 
the potatoes will not be fo dry and meally. The above di- 
re6liorjs are founded on ftricl experiment and obfervation. 

Improvements in agricuhure began a confiderable number 
of years ago to n^ake their appearance in this parifh and 
neighbourhood. Tor Ibme time they advanced but flowly, 
being utider the dire£lion of only a few individuals; bat a 
few years ago they became more general, and are now ad- 
vancing with rapid progrefs. Befides the deiire and hope 
of gain, a laudable fpirit of emulation fully appears now ac- 
tuating the public mind, and opens the fair profpeiEl of muK- 
tifarious improvements. 

Roads, ^c, — There are two public roads in the parlfli ; 
the one palling through the parifli from fouth to north, 
leading from the Boat of Kincleaven, to the Bridge of Cally, 
where it joins the military road which leads from Blairgow- 
rie to Fort -George. The other cro^^ing the forefaid road at 
the church, and pafling through the parifli from eafl to 
weft leading frofti Blairgowrie towards Dunkeld. The for- 
mer of thete roads was made many years ago, principally hy 
the f^atute labour, under the direction, and by the afCflance, 
of Mr Farquharfon of Invercauld. The latter is now mak- 
jna under the direftion of Mr Campbell of Achalader. The 
ftatute labour is here now converted into money, and the he- 
rirors Ceem determmcd that that money ihall be properly ap- 
plied. They fix upon a proper plan, and when the public 
fupd falls 11) ort of defraying the expence of executing that 
plan, they make up the deficiency out of their own private 

pockets.

l„e and Balleid. There are aifo plantations ot feveral fpe- 

c i s of fi- - °f r f "b 

pun ations on the eftate of Glaffdune. Of all the hr tr.be, 

the larix takes the lead, in every foil and fi.nat.n. Be.ng 
. quick grower, and of good quality, it has become a fa- 
vourite obj.a of the landed gentlemen, who income to tmprove 
Their pro erty by the plantation of wood. There are lar^ 
trees now growing at Marlee, which were planted by the 
nrefent oroprietor about 36 years ago, fome of which mea- 
L. r feet s inches in circumference, and above 70 feet la 
length. This gentleman has, for a great number, of year, 
back railed here from the feed, annually, a great number of 
ihou'fands of plants of this fpecies of fir, and annually tranf- 
„-medmnythoufandsof them to the north country, .0 
clothe and ornament a few of his lofty mountams of Brae- 
mar to ftand a beamilul monument of perfevermg mduftry, 
and'to ferve future generations with that valuable wood ! 

Mr Campbell of Achaladcr, who is fubftantially improv- 
ing the farm of Bailed, which he occupies, has introduced 
the larix as a fublV.tute for the thorn hedge. The larches 
are planted in double rows, at the diftance of about 1 8 inches 
betwixt the plants in the row, and the diftance of 14 inches 
betwixt the rows, the plants in the one row ftanding oppo- 
fite to the vacancies in the other. As the larix thrives in

Bills, Fuel Game, ^c.^Th.re are no hills In this parifh, 
excepting , he hill of Cochrage, belonging to Mr Campbell 
of Achaiader ; and it merits rather the names of a muir and 
mo(s. than that of a hill. It is of a conllderable extent, and 
contams a great quantity of peat.mofs. On this mofs, the 
inhabitants of this country, to the diftanee of a confiderable 
number of miles to the fouth-caft of the mofs, ufed princi- 
pally to depend for their fuel, peat and turf. But now thai 
the attention of the farmers is much taken up in the fum- 
mer feafon, with improvements in agriculture, the inhabi- 
tants of this parilh and neighbourhood, (excepting thofe re- 
fiding near the mofs) principally depend for fuel upon coals, 
driven from the fliores of Perth and Dundee. 

In this hill of Cochrage, there are a good many groufe or 
muir-fowl, and a few heath-fowl or black-cock. There were, 
no heath-fowl to be feen in this parifh or neighbourhood, 
till within thefe few years. They came from the woods and 
muirs in the neighbourhood of Dunkeld, and are now to be 
i'ctn in almoit every muir in this neighbourhood, where there 
is plenty of heath for food, and wood for fhelter. The nu- 
merous rifing plantations are alfo beginning to invite the 
roe- leer, wl ich, till within thefe few years, had not, for 
fonie ag s puft, made their abode in thefe lower parts of this 
country,

tn the lower parts of this parifh, hares and partridges 
abound. And about the latter end of autumn, a vaft 
number and variety of water-fowl, particularly the wild 
duck, and the different fpecies of teals, repair to the lakes 
before mentioned, and there continue to 8^^^^^/ 
onally the gleanings of the neighbouring corn fields tdl 
thefe fields are covered with fnow, or bound up with froft. 
Then they depend for lubfiftence on the open lakes, marges, 
and fprings. And when thefe axe all llmt up except a few 
powerful fprings, they betake themfelves to the open rivers, 
and there continue till the increafing frolb drive them, e- 
maciated, back to the fea fhores. A few of them remaia 
here over winter, and hatch in the fpring feafon. The 
wood-cock, alfo, who vifits us about the middle or end of 
Oaober, feeds in our woods till the winter frofts fet in, when 
he cannot, with his feet or bill, turn over the fallen leaves: 
Then he takes to the woods and thickets where fprmgs mofl: 
abound ; and when the frofts have long continued very in- 
tenfe, inftigated by neceffity, he wings his way to more lou- 
them' climes, where the loofe lying leaves of the woods, and 
the open marlhes and fprings, admit his long tender bill, 
and invite him to pick up, and fuck from their open ftores, 
the fcanty pittance of food which he demands. He revifits 
us about the middle of February, on his way to a more nor- 
thern climate, where he fixes his place for propagating his 
ipecies.— But why repair to thefe northern climates to pro- 
pagate thy fpecies ? Do the Norwegian woods afford thy 
tender young ones a more plentiful fupply of food, and eve- 
ry other thing iuited to their nature, than could be found in 
more fouthern climates ? In thefe northern climates, is the 
year far advanced before the fnows are diffolved ? Does the 
diffolution of the fnows and frofts afford plenty of fprings, 
and moifture in the woods ? If thou delighteft in the fmaU

'^1^^ Siafi/lical Account 

feeds of vegetables, doft thou find that, againfl the feafon of 
mcubation, they are not, by vegetation, rendered unfit for 
thy ufe ? Againft the time when thou haft got thy brood 
under thy wings, has the animating fbn produced, by hi^ in- 
fluence, plenty of animalculi and ihfeas amongft the fallen 
leaves of the woods, and encourage many fmall reptiles to 
come up to the furface of the earth, and mix among the 
leaves ? Doft thou find them in plenty for thyfelf and for 
thy brood ? and plenty of food alfo among the fprings ? 
Yes thou doft ; and with that plenty thou continueft, till 
thy young ones are grown up to full Cze and ftrength, and 
are fully fledged. And when the killing frofts fet in, and 
the falling fnows threaten to cover up thy favourite haunts, 
thou leaveft thy native woods, and betakeft thyfelf to thofe' 
in more fouthern climates. 

Afitiquities^ ^s'^'.— There is one Druidical temple in the 
parifh, on the road leading from Blairgowrie to Dunkeld, 
There is an old caftle at Glaflclune, fituated on the promon- 
tory of the fteep bank of a deep den. It appears from its 
fituation to have been a very ftrong hold, before the ufe of 
fire arms was introduced into this countrj'. Mr Campbell 
of Achalader is the prefent proprietor ; Mr Blair was his 
predeceflbr ; and Mr Heron, Mr Blair's. As to when it 
was built, and by whom, even tradition itfelf is filent. • 

A pair of very large deer's horns were found a few years 
ago, in a bed of marl, in Mr Farquharfon's marl-pit at Mar- 
lee. From their fuperior fize, and palmed forni, they ap- 
pear to be the horns of the elk-deer, antiently the ftately in- 
habitant of the Caledonian forefts. It is remarkable that 
deers horns have been found ' in different marl-pits in this 
country, in an entire ftate ; but never found in the mofs 
above the marl, nor in the ftratum of fand or clay, betwixt 

the 



nf Kinlcch. 479 

uppermoft and the lowell beds of marl ; nor In the ftra- 
1,1 of clay orfand below, the undermoft bed of marl; but 
i„ ,he bed of marl i.felf i which circumflance renders ,t pro. 
bable, that Ihell-marl is well adapted for prelervmg certam 

fubftances from decay. 

There is in a muir in this parifl., a vaft number of tumuh, 
called the Haer Cairns. In this muir, it is thought, that the 
famous battle between Agricola the Roman general, and Gal- 
gacus the general of the Caledonians, was fought. 

A particular detail on this fubjeft would ftretch this fta- 
tiflical account to too great a length. The writer, there-

CharaBer of the People. — In delineating the chara(5^er of 
the people of this panlh, 1 can conicientioufly fay, more e- 
fpecially comparing them with the inhabitant^- of many other 
diftridVs, that they have rational fentiments of religion ; that 
they are regular attendants on tl^e ordinances of divine in- 

flitution J 



of Kintoch\ 



ftltutlon; that, on the whole, they are difinterefted, benevo- 
lent, humane, and charitable ; that they are flow to Ipeak, 
inodeft in converfation, refpeclful to fuperiors, obedient to 
thofe who have the rule over them, quiet in their behaviour, 
and, from religious principle, thankful and loyal fubjects of 
the Britifh government. At the fame time, if. we keep 
in view the great ftandard of perfedlion, by which we ought 
to judge of the human character, I mean the laws of our 
holy religion^ arid the perfe£l pattern of perfedl excel- 
lence, which the Divine Author of it hath left for our 
imitation, I muft fay, that, upon a clofe examination, 
there are to be feen, oh the face of this fair character, 
ibme fpecks j and that there is good ground, and fair oppor- 
tunity, for improving, purifying, brfaamehting, arid adorning 
it. 

May a humble fenfe of fuch imperfections, ever keep our 
hearts open to the nobleft motives for improvements !

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q987782">INSCH</name>. 

(County and Synod of Aberdeen. — Presbytery 

OF Garioch). 

By a Friend to Statistical Inquiries.</head>

<p>

Origin of the Name^ Situation^ and Boundaries. 

INCH, or, as it is commonly written, Infch, feems to derive 
its name from its local fituation on a low flat, fituated 
clofe by the fide 6f a fmall rivulet. This parifh lies in the 
county and fynod of Aberdeen, and in that diftrift of the 
county which is called the Garioch, and gives name to the 
prefbytery in which Infch is fituated. It is diftant about 26 
miles from Aberdeen ; and is bounded on the fouth by the 
parifhes of Oyne and Pi-emnay ; on the weft, by Kinneth- 
niont and Gartly ; on the north, by Drumblate and Forgue ; 
and on the eaft by Culfalmond. 

Figure and Extent ; Soil and Proportion of Arable Land.—' 
Its hgure is that of an oblong Iquare, 5 miles long by 3 ia 
breadth Its area 15 miles, or nearly 7500 Scots acres. 
The land, in the fouthern parts of the parifh, is generally 
of a molt excellent fo 1, and produces rich and early crops j 
but along the ficTts of the hill oJ Fondland, and in the glens 
or narrow vHies, which rwn up from the lnv country 
throni-'h that hiU, the loii is not fo fertile, and the oops are 

late

late and precarious. About one third of the whole parifla (or 
2500 acres) is cultivated, at prefent, and 5000 acres are not 
cultivated. But it deferves to be noticed, that of this unculti- 
vated part, feveral hundred acres on the hill of Fondland,and 
in the glens or narrow vallies above mentioned, not only are 
arable, but were formerly under cultivation. Thefe are now ne- 
gleded, and produce nothing but heath. They were firll defert- 
ed by the farmers in the end of laft century, when that part of 
the country was almoft depopulated by 7 years of famine : 
And now they lie negleaed, along with many thoufand acres, 
in like fituation, in different parts of the north of Scotland. 

Bills.— The largeft of thefc is the hill of Fundland above 
mentioned, which extends into feveral pariflies, and is ele- 
vated about 800 feet above the level of the fea. This ex- 
tenfive hill fhelters the parifh of Infch, and a conliderable 
part of the dillrift of Gartoch, upon the north ; and hence 
partly occafions its great natural fertility. In the moil ele- 
vated part of Fondland, and in that part which is fituated in 
the parifh of Infch, are extenfivc quarries of fine blue flate, 
a confiderable quantity of which is yearly dug up, and ma- 
nufaitured for fale. This hill feems once to have been a 
■very confiderable hunting forefl. Its name, which is from 
the Gaelic, is expreflive of this ; for faoed^ in the Gaelic, 
flgnifies hunting. And, in the mofles of this hill, very large 
trees, particularly oaks, are frequently dug up. It now ar 
bounds in mofs, heath, and moor game, About half a mile 
from the town of Infch, flands the curious and noted hill 
of Dun-o-deer, with the ruins of a very antient caftle on, 
the top of it. Dun-o-deer, or Dundore in Qaelic, is faid to 
fignify the Hill in the Wood i and very probably all the lower 
grounds, around that ip.fulated hill, have once been covered 
with wood. It is remarkable fteep on all fides, is of a coni- 
cal fliapc, and' covered with a very fine green fward. Hec- 
tor 



t 



4^4 Btaiijlical Account 

tor Bocrhius calls it Bundore. the golden mountain in Garioch , 
and fays, that the teeth of the O^eep that paftured u -.n it 
were of the colour of gold. It ftill affords moft excdlcnt 
pafture for fliecp, hut has no fuch quality as is afcribed fo it 
by that very creJulous hiftorian. This hill is about 3000 
yards in circumference, and, above 300 feet high, andXeems 
to fpring from the level plain of the Garioch. It has been, 
probably in fome very early period, a volcano, though diffe- 
rent opinions are formed concerning this curious hill. 

'Rivers and prcjeBed C/j/w/.-^The Imall rivulets in this pa- 
rifh are not worth notice on their own account ; but ihey 
are very proper for fupplyins with water a projefled canal 
from Infch to Aberdeen. This canal has been fome time ia 
contemplation, and at prefent it is thought that it will fuc- 
ceed, at leall: as far as Inverury. The fubfcription for the 
undertaking is already fwelleJ to ?i great amount. But if 
Xht proprietors cf land wtre to carry on the canal, and to con- 
tribute fums proportioned to their property ; and if, inftead 
of 2 d. per ton for each mile, only a halfpenny per ton ijior 
defraying the expence of boats, and keeping the canal in 
repair) were exacted, a. number of heavy articles, fuch ns 
flones for London, and potatoes for Denmark and Norway, 
would be carried to Aberdeen, which could not be carried, 
if the canal dues or porterage be high ; and. the lands in 
this diftrift would foon increale in rent, much more than all 
the intereft of the money expended on the canal. Should 
this canal fuccecd, it is dificult to fay, hnw much the rich 
diftricH: of the Garioch, for which nature has done fo much, 
and art lo little, may advance in value in qo or 40 vears. 
From this parifli the fl.ite from the hill of Fondland would 
be exchanged for lime from Aberdeen.

Jgrkuhure.-^l^ brtter mode of cultivating the land is now 
adopter than what formerly prevailed. But a regular rota- 
tion of crops is not yet eftablilhed, though confiderablc 
quantities of turnips and potatoes are reared annually. Oats 
and barley are ftiU the principal crops in this parifh. Should, 
however/the canal above mentioned take place, many hun- 
dreds of acres, befides thofe which were once cultivated, but 
arc now deferted, would be brought into cultivation ; and, 
inftead of a poor ftinted fort of heath, would produce lux- 
uriant crops of corn apd grafs. 

Manure.— Tht only manure ufed in this parifh, except 
the dung ra.fed on the farms, is lime brought trom Aber- 
deen. There was a fmall quantity of marl on one farm, 
called Nether Boddom, but it was exh-iuf^ed feveral years 
ago. And fo ignorant were the country people of its pro- 
per value, that they ufed it as plaller to the walls of their 
houfes. It was, however, of coniiderable fervice to the farm 
in which it was found. Perhaps this fmall quantity is a 
proof that more marl might be difcovered in the diflria, if 
the proprietors would be at the expence of iearching for it. 

Population.— Tht population of this parifh has decreafed, 
within thefe 40 years. In l)r Webi'ter's account it is flated 
at 995 ; it is now only 900, or 95 lets. The population of 
the country parilhes in the north of Scotland decreafed 
much in the end of the lafl century, as may be fecn, by 
comparing the numbers who paid the poll-tax, (a number 
certainly fliort of the whole population), with the numbers 
given in Dr Wtbfter's account. There was, however, in the 
firft 60 years of this century, a rapid increafe of the popula- 
tion, which was brought pretty near to its former flare, 
when the fcarcity of mOfs in country panflics, and the de- 
mand 



Staiijllcal Account 

mand for labour about towns on rhe fea coaft, drew off a 
number of people to refide in the royal boroughs, or m-anu- 
faaunng towns. It is now chiefly in thofe par.fhes. in which 
manufaaur,ng villages are found, that the population is in- 
creafing. In all probability, however, it will increafe for 
fome t.me. The introdudlion of potatoes has added much 
to the quantity of human food ; and with an increafe of 
proviaon, there will always be an increafed population. 

VUlage.^Tht town of Infch, where the church ftands, Is 
fituated at the fouthern extremity of the parilh. It is a 
burgh of barony, has a weekly market, and two or three 
yearly fairs ; but they are much on the decline. The car- 
rying the canal to this vilbge would be attended with im- 
portant advantages, as it would become the market place for 
ali the upper parts of the Garioch. The feuers of this 
tot^rn are heritable proprietors of their houfes and fmall 
gardens. They are either /hopkeepers or mechanics ; and 
they rent fmall farms from Colonel Hay of Rannes, who is 
fuperior of the town, and proprietor of the lands in the 
neighbourhood, 

Mamfac7ures,~The knitting of flockings for the Aber- 
deen manufacturers is the principal employment of the wo- 
men of this ditiria. It is at prefent at a ftand ; and, from 
various caufes, is prefumed to be on the decline. 

Atitlquities — The old caftle, built on the top of the coni- 
cal hill of Dun-o-deer, is a very great curiofity. Tradition 
fays it was built by King Gregory the Great, more than 900 
years ago; yet a confiderable part of the walls are flill 
Handing ; and the materials of which the walls are built are 
pf a fingular kind, and have given rife to various conjcflures. 

In 



tj Infck 4^1 

In a periodical paper called the Bee, lately publlflied at Edin. 
burgh, there was lately given a very particular, and pretty- 
accurate defcription of the hill and caftle of Dun^o-dcer, 
with a copper.plate engraving. The author of that defcnp- 
tion fuppoles the materials of the caftle to be part of a v.tn- 
fied fort. But it appears at leaft as probable, tnat this mount, 
as well as the Top-o-Noth, another of the fame kmd, a fev. 
milcs dittant from it, have been volcanos, and that th«s old 
caftle has been built with fome of the volcanic matter dug 
out of the hill. The gentlenxn of the diftrift of Garioch, 
fome years ago, fubfcribed a few gumcas tor white-wralhing 
the ruins of this caftle, which were worth the expeuce of a- 
doming and preferving. 

Pro/.rzVfon.— There are 6 heritors, of whom Mr Gordon 
of Rothney is the only refident proprietor. The rent of the 
parifti is about 1200I. 

Eccleftajlkal The manfe of Infch was built in 177I ; 

and the church is lately repaired. Mr George Daun was 
admitted minifter of Infch in 1790 The it.pend is about 
70I. j but a procels of aug,mentaiion is depending, -bir Wil- 
liam Forbes of Craigievar is patron of the parifh. The 
•kirk-feflion, befides their other mnds, have the property of 
a fmall piece of Und, called the Bafs, which was bequeathed 
to them for the ufe of the poor, by an heritor of the town 
of Inlch, in the laft century. 

CharaSer of the People. — The people are decent in their 
behaviour, and indufirious in their occupations ; and, like 
the inhabitants of all country parilhes, more funple in their 
manners, and more pure in morals than the inhabitants of 

towns.

Origm of the Name. 

QUEENSFERRY (the pallage of the Queen) derives 
its name from Margaret, Queen of Malcolm Canmore, 
a Princefs celebrated for her charitable and beneficent virtues. 
She frequented the paflage much, and wa3 the great patronefs 
of the place ; hence the name by which it is nOw diftinguifh- 
ed certainly originated. 

Situation and Extent. — Qu^eensferry is fituated in the county 
of Weft Lothian, in the prefbytery of Linlithgow, aftd in the 
fynod of Lothian and Tweedale. The parifli is of fmall ex- 
tent, confifting only of the borough, (the royalty not ex- 
tending to the two ends of the town). It is an ereflioa 
within the parifh of Dalmeny, which took place in the year 
1636; is furrounded by that parifli on the fouth-wefl and 
eaft, and bounded by the Frith of Forth on the north. 

Manufaaures,^i:ht principal manufaflure of this place is 
that of foap. It was here that firft in Scotland the makin^r 
of brown foap was brought to its prefent degree of perfedlion" 

VoL.XVIL 3 ^j^.* 



Staiiflical Account 



This manufacture commenced about the year 1770, and has 
fince been carried on with varying fuccefs. From the year 
1783 to 1789, it Was a flourifliing and cxtenfive trade. 
There were 4 large works, which employed from 20 to 30 
labouring men, and paid an excife-duty from 8000]. to 
10,000 1, per annum. In the year 1789, the foap trade in 
Scotland met a confiderable check. It was for fome time 
almoft annihilated here. It has fince, however, happily re- 
vived, and is now carried on with a great deal of fpirit. 

Commerce. --li]xt commerce of this town has been for a 
long time in a ftate of decline. About the year 1640, the 
fliipmafters here were owners of above io veflels, moft of 
them large brigs, and generally employed in the carrying trade. 
But as this trade has been found often to Ihift its fituations, 
this place at prefent has none of it. About 9 years ago, 
fcveral veflels were built here, one of them a Ihip above 500 
tons burden, and fitted out for the Greenland fifliery. A 
trade was carried on by a very Ipirited inhabitant. But as 
lately he fold the whole of his {hipping, at prefent there is 
not a veflel belonging to this port. 

Fijhery. — Attempts have been made to eftablilh a filhery 
here, at leaft (iich a filhery as might fupply the town and 
neighbourhood, but hitherto without fuccefs ; although it is 
the general opinion, that 2 or 3 induttrious filhermen might 
fettle here to advantage. The filh to be found in this part 
of the Frith are cod, haddocks, whitings, fkate, flounders, 
herrings, crabs, lobfters, and oyfters. , There are alio fome 
very fine mufcle fcalps. The herring fiftiery, which has 
lately taken place in this neighbourhood, forms a mofl plea- 
fant article' in a ftatiftical account. 

It began at the end of the year 1 792, oppofitc to this, and 

in

in the part of the Frith without the Bay of Inverkelthing. 
During that feafon a plentiful fupply of good herrings was 
fent to the coaft towns, and to many inland places at a con- 
fiderable diftance. Next feafon the herrings were ftill more 
plentiful, and the markets more plentifully fupplied. Little 
was done in curing for foreign markets. The merchants, 
who were inclined to engage in the trade, regretted that they 
were not provided with the neceflary articles of barrels and 
fait. The laft was a feafon of an extenfive and profitable 
fifliery. From the middle of Odtober to the ift of March 
laft, from this place, you could count from 80 to 100 boats 
almoft every day bufily and fuccefsfuUy employed. Herrings 
were found in great abundance from Burntifland to above 
Borrowftounnefs. Fifhermen rcforccd to this trom all quar- 
ters. A fingle boat often came in with 30 or 40 barrels, 
which were fold for 8 I. or lo 1. A great number of herring 
bulTes came from Glafgow, by the great canal, and had a 
moft fuccefsful fifliery. Vaft quantities were cured and lent 
to the foreign markets. About 6000 barrels were cured at 
this port. The inland part of the country was plentifully 
fupplied, at the diftance of 30 or 40 miles, by land carriage. 
The retail price here notwithftanding, at an average, was not 
more than 6d. a hundred. 

It is a pretty general opinion, that the herring fhoals have 
former/y frequented this part of the Frith, and might often 
have been found in the places where the filhery has been 
lately fo fuccelsful. If fo, it is a lubjeft of much regret, 
that the opportunities of fuch a profitable fi£hery have been 
loft ; and the public are taught not to neglect to explore the 
feas which furround our ifland, as almoft every part of them 
is found to contain ftores not only fufficient to diffufe plenty 
among the inhabitants, but alfo amply to reward and enrich

tation trade. 

Harbour. ^TYxQ eaft pier was lately repaired, and lengthen- 
ed above 60 feet. Workmen are juft now employed in re- 
building the weft pier. When this work is finiQied, the 
harbour will be in a complete ftate of repair, which is of im- 
portance not only to the town, but alfo to the public. The 
materials for loap-making, as well as the greater part of the 
coals confumed by the inhabitants, are cai;ried by water. 
VelTels going up and down the Frith are often obliged to run 
in here in hard gales borne years ago, when the ports in 
Mid Lothian were fliut, a great number of vefTels loaded 
with wheat were delivered at this port, which would have 
been fcarcely pradicable if the ead pier had not then been 
repaired. The greater part of the lum expended in thefe 
repairs, amounting nearly to loool. has been raifed by fub- 
fcription. In aid of the work, the Royal Boroughs have 
given 100 1. 

Pojfage *. — There is much obfcurity about the founding 
of this palTage. The right of it is private property; and feems 
originally, to have been attached to the lands of Muiryhall, 
lying in the neighbourhood, confifting of about 17 acres, faid 
to have been gifted by Queen Margaret for upholding this 
paflage. The prefent proprietors are feveral gentlemen, both 
on the foutb and north fide. Till lately there were too de- 
Icriptions of proprietors, the proprietors of the vvater-pafTig'e, 
and the proprietors of the boats and yawls plying on the paf- 



lage.

Club built and kept in repair a fufficient number of boa s 
and ;awls, and tdok leaibs from the proprietors of the wa.r-

Such^vas 'the praaice till the yenr .784, -he" the proprie- 
tors of the water-palfage. refufing to grant leafes to the own- 
ers of boats and yawls, purchaled the whole of them, and 
have fince let them yearly by roup. By this change the 
public have gained feveral advantages. The boats and. yawls 
are kept in excellent repair, under the infpeaion of a jud 
cious perfon, ajjpointed by the proprietors. The rules and 
regulations of the paffage have been painted on boards, and 
affixed at fome proper place on the inns at both fides. Two 
gentlemen, one on this, the other on the north fide, are in- 
verted with powers to decide all matters in. di{\)ute ; fo that, 
if the regulations are not obferved, or more than the fares 
demanded", the public have themfeives only to blame. It 
has been much debated, whether or not the charter by which 
the paffage is held ihould not be taken away, indemnification 
given to the proprietors, and the riglu to the paflage laid 
open to every one who fliould chufe to ply upon it. Thtj-e 
is not much difiiculty, it is apprehended, in deciding 'thq 
t« lellion. A paffjge lb much frequented as this, muft be 
kept under fina regulations. Thefe are beft matle, and can 
on y be well obferved, by making the right ot the paffage 
private property, or by vefting it in fome company. Befides, 
were the paflage laid open to every needy adventurer, who 
might find means to fit out a boat or yawl, the public would 
have no fecurity that fuch boats and yawls would be kept in 
lufficient repair, or properly manned. From motives of 
profit, too, the owners of them might be tempted to rifle a 
paffage, which, from the weather, might be dangerous, or 
even fometimes fatal.

confiderable way among rocks and large flones. rendered 
ihppery by bemg covered with wet fba-weed. To this land- 
ing-place the boatmen are often obliged to carry, with much 
jeopardy to themfelves. the great mail on the north road 
The only fund for upholding the landmg.places, on both 
fides, is an appropriation of the 40th part of the grols freights 
called the ferry fiver, amounting, at an average, to about 
2S\' per annum: a fum far from being fufficienr. Occafion 
al aid has been given by the Royal Boroughs, and by the 
CommifTioners for the forfeited eftates. When, therefore 
it is confidered that this is one of the moft frequented paf! 
fages in the kingdom, and that it will continue to be much 
frequented from its many conveniencies, which are well 
known, every thing relating to its regulations, and the ftate 
of its repairs, is intercftmg to the public. The po ice of the 
country has been adively and ufcfully employed in making

and repairing roads and bridges-, and, it is humbly appre- 
hended, it would alio be ufefuUy employed in direamg its 
attention to the ftate of the landing places of this ferry, by 
takin^^ meafures for the railing and appropriating a lufficient 
fund "for building and kecpmg th. m m proper repair, by 
which the palTage might be rendered more late, and much 
more commodious *. 

Pdpulation.~-T\\t population of this parifh. as ftated to Dr 
We;?fter about 44 years ago. was 400. In 1791 an accurate 
lift was taken, when the number of fouls amounted to 505. 
It has fince varied little.

• Perhaps the beft way of effedVing this would be, by an aft 
of Parliament, for levying additional rales, and borrowing, up- 
on the credit of the fund, what might be neceflary for repair- 
ing the landing-places, and other improvements at the Ferry. ' 



49^ Statijlical Account 



Pf^r.-The pariQi funds are ample, confifting of the caU 
leaion at the church-doors, amoun-ing, at an average, to 
22 1. and of the intereft of a conliderable fum of money. 
The parifh being fmall, and the ftate of the poor perfcftly 
known to the fe/Tion, they have adopted it as a rule, not 
confidering the poor as the beft economifts, to give fmall 
penfions once a month, and to fupply them according to 
the exigencies, as in perfonal or family diftrefs, to give coals, 
pay houfe-rents, &amp;c. The average number of poor on the 
roll is 1 6. 

Siij,efid.— The ftipend was lately augmented, and is noW 
worth 105 J- annujn. There is neither manfe nor glebe. 
The Magiftrates and Town-Council are patrons. 

Sea-Bathing ^larters.-^ThQ water, rendered ftronger by 
the narrovvnefs of the Frith at this place'; its vicinity to 
Edinburgh; its eafy communication with that city; the dry- 
nefs and falubrity of the air ; the beauty and variety of the 
furrounding fcenery ; the excellent accommodation for lod- 
ging, all render Queensferry a moft convenient and pleafant 
lituatlon for fea-bathing quarters. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — The weather in this neigh- 
bourhood is particularly dry, and the climate healthful. 
Several perfons lately died in this parifli upwards of 90^ 
Por more than 12 years paft, there has been no epidemical 
difeafe except the confluent fmall- pox, as there are ftill fome 
people among us who, from fcruples, refift the falutary prac- 
tice of inoculation. 

This was originally a fea-faring town ; and a great propor- 
tion of its inhabitants are men who have been employed in this 
line, who, having acquired a decent competency, and having 

always 



hf ^eensferrp 



497 



always kept up a conneaion and attachment, have returned 
to their families and their friends, to fettle and fpend their 
days in the place of their nativity. Thus the fociety of a 
little town is continued, enlarged, and made more happy. 

From this circumftance, which muft have influence oii 
early education, and from a (ort of fea-buftle, which is every 
day to be feen here, on account of the palTage, it lias hap- 
pened that moft of the young men have been inclined to try 
their fortune at fea. During the late American war, there 
were from 30 to 40 failors from this town in his Majefty's 
fervice. In the prefent war there are 35. Some of them of- 
ficers in the army, or furgeons, or lieutenants and midfhip- 
men in the navy •, all of them employed in the fervice of 
their country.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q15261798">NESTING
In Shetland</name> 

By a Friend to Statijiical Inquiries.</head>
        <p>

' -' III—— Mill • 

Name, ^c. 

NESTING, like the greater number, if not ail the name6 
of places in the Shetland Iflands, is evidently of Nor- 
wegian extraction. Its meaning is unknown, the Norfe lan- 
gua\^e being at prcfent no longer fpoken in Shetland. The 
miniftry of Netting confifts of four different parts. The parilh 
of Netting, the parifli of Lnnnefting, and the parifli of Whal» 
fay. To thefe are annexed the detached iflands of Skerries, 
which, about twenty years ago, formed a part of a very exten- 
five charge, eftablifhed on the royal bounty, for a miffionary 
paid from that fund. For thefe many years the falary has 
been difcontinued , and, of confequence, the poor inhabitants 
of thefe detached iflands of Toula., Fair Ifle, and Skerries, 
who labour under many local difadvantages, inleparably an- 
nexed to their firuation by the God of Nature, have now 
to lament, that they are deprived of their only mean of reli- 
gious inttrutSion. There is however a fair profpedl of getting 
thib ufeful miflion re-ettablifiied by the Committee on the 
Royal Bounty. This miniftry forms a part of the prefbytery 
of Shetland, which has fynodical powers within itfelf, as no 

appeal 



49» 



tf Neffing^ 499 

ippeal lies from that prcfbytery, but to the General Aflem- 
bly. 

Fi/Ijerhs.— The inhabitants adventure in what we call the 
Great Fifheries of ling, cod. and tuilc ; but the principal 
part of their fubfiaence arifes from, the imall fifhing of piU- 
tock and fillock, which, except in very extraordinary years, 
they can purfue at no expence, and with great advantage, all 
the year rqund. 

Population.-^ThXs. rainiftry contains a greater nqmber of 
inhabitants, in proportion to the rental land, than any 
pthtr in Shetland, owing to the exertions of the two prm- 
cipal heritors, Mr Bruce Sreuart of Symbifter, and Mr Hun- 
ter of Lunna, in making outfets, or new fettlements, on 
grounds formerly uncultivated. Thefe improvements baye 
been attempted with the view of increafing the number of 
filhermen on their refpeaive eftates ; but when the tiihin^ 
fails, as it often does, thefe lettiers on new grounds become 
burdens on the proprietor j and, without tlie aflirtancc of 
their landmalter, muft ftarve, when the Imall filhing. fails for 
their fupport j for none of them, have a poflellion of land, that, 
with the beft cultivation, and in the molt favourable years, 
can fupply their families in meal, or any l?.ind of ^rain, for 
nearly one half of the year. 

So long as the prefent proprietors of VVhalfay and Lun- 
nefling are able to continue in the management of their own 
lands the tenants may continue, an,d the lands may be culti« 
vated j but, fhould the fucceiTors of thefe gentlemen have a 
lefs a£live, or a different turi) of mind, there is reafon to fear 
9 great decreafe of the population.

It is believed that the above ftate is not greatly under or 
above the truth, although it is juft now only ttatcd from me- 
mory There is no doubt, that theprefent population of this 
miniftry is confiderably increaled ; and I am inclined to be- 
lieve, that now (1793) the inhabitants are not under 1800. 
The ftipend of this miniftry is at prcfent one of the highefl: 
in thefe iflands. An augmentation was granted about 16 
ye.irs ago, which raifes the value of the living, commumbtis 
annisy to about 85 1. Sterling. But as both parfonage and vica- 
rage teinds are payable in butter and oil, the minifter's income 
will vary according as the prices of thde two articles rile or 
fall. When the butter and oil are at a high price, then the 
ttiinitter's ftipend is high iu proportion ; but when the prices 
of thefe two articles fall, the value of the living is in propor- 
tion diminiflied. 

Roads and Bridges.-r-The roads, bridges, &amp;c. are in the 
fame ftate here as in every other part of Shetland ; that is to 
fay, there are none. 

Ecclefiajiual State. — There are three churches, all in very 
good repair, in this exfenfive miniftry, where the minifter 
pfEciates in rotation i firlt, at Netting, fecond Sabbath, Lun- 



9j Bejiing. SP^ 

„a third Sabbath, Whalfay ; and, in the fummer, he vifits 
the detached iflands of Skerries, for a week in the year. 

Jgnculture.-^Tht agriculture in this miniftry is in the 
fame wretched ftate that it is in all the Shetland .flands. 
The people direa their fole attention to the fifli.ng, and con- 
lider the cultivation of the lands as only a fecondary objea:. 

Shipwrechs.—Oti the coafts of this extenfive miniftry fhip- 
wrecks often happen ; and it ought tabe mentioned, to the cre- 
dit of the inhabitants, that the poor fufferers have, on all oc- 
cafions, been treated with the greateft humanity. One in- 
ftance only, out of many that might be adduced, fliall here 
be mentioned. In the year 1780, a Ruffian fngate was 
wrecked on the iiland of Whalfay. Mr Bruce Stewart, the 
proprietor of that ifland, ordered immediately his tenants to 
fit out proper boats to fave what lives could be faved. Un- 
fortunately all their exertions, which were made at the rilk 
of their own lives, could fave only five of the Ruflian failors. 
Thefe five men were entertained by Mr Bruce at his hofpi- 
table manfion for feveral months, and fent home to their na- 
tive country. From the report of thefe five men, the Era- 
prefs of Ruflia gave orders to her ambaffador at the Court 
of London, to write, in her name, a letter of thanks to Mr 
Bruce of Symbifter which letter I have feen. It does ho- 
nour to her, as a Sovereign who deigns to interefi herfelf ift 
the kindnefs fhown to her fubjedts in diftrels. Many uiore 
inftances might be mentioned of the humanity Ihown by the 
inhabitants of this parifti to lailors in diftrefs. Unfortunate- 
ly, they have too many calls on their humanity in this way. 



Means of Improvement. — One obfervation applies to this mi- 
niftry, as well as to all the other pariihes in Shetland Iflands, 

namely. 



Stati/iical Aecouni 

no„,ely that they never can be made of fuch J.portance t. 
theBn.(hEcnp.re as they „.ight be, unlefs proper n.an^ 
faaures are introduced among them. Leafes granted, of a 
proper duration, and manufaauring villages eftablifhed. 

Conclufton.^lt is hoped that the account of the miniftcr 
of the parifh will render it unneceffary to make any ufe of 
this iraperfea Iketch, which is only wrote in a hurry from 
mere memory, by a perfon who refided there, in a puyic 
charaaer, about the year 1781, but who could not think, 
with patience, that there (hould be any blank in the Statiftical 
Account of Scotland, if it was in his pow^r to fupply it. </p>

Situation^ ^c* 

FT^HE pariOi of Largs is fituared in the diftria of Curi- 
JL ninghame, one of the divifions of the county of Ayr, 
at the northern extremity, about thirty miles due weft frorri 
Glafgow. It extends about nine miles from Eelly-burn, 
which feparates it on the north from the parifli of Innerkip, 
jp the (hire of Renfrew, along the Frirh of Clyde, which 
bounds it on the weft, in a line nearly parallel with the Ifle of 
Bute, to the parifli of Weft Kilbride, which bounds it on the 
louth at a little diftance from the vilLige of Fairly. From- the 
village of Largs, it extends about 7 or 8 mile? to the hill 
of Stake, the fummit of an extenfive ridge of hills running 
from Greenock to Kilwinning, and feparating the parifh of 
Largs from the adjacent country on the eaft. This circum- 
ftance, occaConed the common faying among the inhabitants 
of the inland parifhes, " Out of the world, and into the 
Largs." 

No parifli in the weft of Scotland, and few in the High- 
lands, can afford fueh a variety of beautiful and romantic 

fcenes. 

♦ *rhe Statiftical Account of Largs, printed in the It. volume, 
being rather ftiort and defeaive, the valuable addition to it, 
herewith printed, was fent by an intelligent and refpeaable 
friend to this great undertaking. 



Siatyiical Account 

fcenes. The hills, which begin to rife In the neighbouring 
panOies of Greenock, Kiimacolm, Lochwinnoch, Kilbirny, 
and Dairy, meet in a kind of general fummit at the eaftern 
boundary of Largs, from which they gradually defcend 
as they approach the fliore, till they terminate at laft in a va- 
riety of abrupt declivities, fome of which arc alrtoft perpen- 
dicular, as if part of their bafe had been torn away by force. 
Notwithftanding the vaft' height of thefe hills, they are 
covered, during the greater part of the year, with verdure, 
and afford fuch . excellent pafture for (heep, and fome of 
them for larger cattle, as can hardly be found elfewhers in 
fimilar fituations. 

Ihc quantity of heath, ev«n on the higheft hills, is com- 
paratively fmall ; and, from indifputable marks it appears, tha^ 
fome of them have once been cultivated^ 

Soil, Agriculture^ and Produce — The whole extent of the 
parifli of Largs may, from feveral furveys, none of which arc 
entirely accurate, be eftimated at 19,743 acres. The eftate 
of Bnfbane alone, with the fues belonging to it, contains 
9,748 acres, 2 falls, and 27 perches. The arable lands in 
the parifti, confift of about 4200 acres, rather more than one 
fifth of the whole. The refl of it is now wholly appropria- 
ted to pafture, though a far greater proportion bears evident 
marks of the plough. About a thoufand acres of the higher 
grounds are of Httle value ; the refl, however, is excelleriC 
for feeding fheep and rearing young _cattle. In the lower 
grounds a number of cattle are fattened, fo as to find a ready 
market in Greenock and other neighbouring towns. Ode 
ftock farm, the property of the Earl of Glafgow, yields very- 
near 500 I. yearly, neat rent 5 and feveral farmers, whole 
cattle are fed upon the paflure grounds only, make confider- 
able quantities of butter and cheefe. 

the 



of Largs* 



The foil of the arable grounds is of two kinds ; that on 
the fouth of Nodefdale water, comprehending Lord Glaf- 
gow's eftate, and great part of Mr Brijfbane's, is light and 
fandy, producing tolerable crops with little culture, if the 
feafon be not immoderately dry, whereas, that on the north 
lide is a light red kind of earth lying on rocky foundations 
of the fame colour, and inferior to the former, both for paf- 
ture and tillage. 

Neither lime nor cOals, worth working, have been dif- 
covered in the parilh, and cannot be obtained from any place 
nearer than Stevenfon, which is about 1 1 miles diftant from 
the fouth end of the parifll. Lime, therefore, as it can only 
be procured at great expence, is but little ufed. The moft 
common manure is a mixture of fea-weed and dung, or dung 
itfelf, where fea-weed. cannot be obtained. 

The fields thus improved, and after lying five or fix years 
in pafturc, yield tolerable crops ; and though the quantity of 
oats and barley, produced by thefe means, is, in general lefs, 
than in fome of. the neighbouring parifhes, the meal is gene- 
rally equal ; a quarter of oats yielding generally 20 pecks of 
meal, fometimes more. The great obftacle to any confider- 
able improvements in agriculture is a fpecics of traffic in 
horfes peculiar to this parifli. 

Farmers, mechanics, and even fervants, who can afford to 
buy a horfe, are eiigaged in it. Some individuals have h-ooi 
10 to a dozen of horfes, fome of them worth 1. or 20 1. 
for the purpofe of hiring them to the farmers in the neigh- 
bouring pariQies, from 20 "to 30 miles round. They are 
ufually let out from a guinea to 40 s. according to their 
quality, from the firft of February, fometimes to the 24th of 
March, but moft commonly to the loth of April, when they 
are all returned. Previous to this period, there are few 
horfes in the whole parilh j but ^ftcr it there arc fo many in 

Vol. XVn. -3 q *

every part of it as are fufficlent for the purpofe of plowlrrg, 
harrowing, and performing all the operations of hufbandry 
in two or three weeks. They are afterwards either turned 
loofe into the higher grounds, or let out for hire during 
the fummer feafon. 

Another praftice, which operates as an obftacle to agricul- 
ture, is that of importing oats from Ireland and the adjacent 
jflands, and manufafturing them at home. This fupplies the 
inhabitants with plenty. The furplus finds a ready market 
in Greenock, and the refufe contributes to feed the horfes. 

Unlefs the former of thefe pradtices, which is, in fomc 
meafure, encouraged by the latter, be abandoned, confider- 
able improvements in agriculture can hardly be expedled, 
and the nature of the foil can fcarcely admit of great im- 
provements. 

The arable grounds yield, in general, tolerable crops of 
oats and barley ; they rival every other in producing great 
quantities of potatoes, and of the beft quality. The orchards 
are, indeed, inferior ; but their gardens, in general, fuperior 
to moft in the fame latitude. 

An attempt to reclaim fome of the lands in the north end 
of the parifh, which arc covered with heath, might be worth 
the experiment, as they are not fo high as to preclude all 
hopes of fuccefs. 

The old Scotch plough is generally ufed. Mr Hill at 
Kelburn ufes the chain-plough, with Small's improved mould- 
board. 

Population. — Largs, though an extenfive parifh, does not 
contain a great proportion of arable ground. It has no com- 
merce, except a {hare in the coafting trade. It contains but 
few inhabitants. According to an accurate calculation made 

lately.

Mr and Climate.— As the parifli lies near the fea, and Is fur- 
rounded by very high hills, it has generally its full propor- 
tion of rain, which is very ferviceable to the light fandy foil, 
of which the greatefl: part of the parilh confifts. 

The air at Largs is commonly pure. The thick fogs 
which often farround Glafgow, Paifley, and the adjacent 
country, frequently cover the hills, but feldom vifit the low 
countries. In time of froft, this circumftance is peculiarly 
remarkable, while in other places the air is thick and hazy, 
here the Iky is clear and ferene. Many of the fickly inha- 
bitants of Glafgow and Pailley have felt fenfible advantages 
from the air of Largs ; fome of them have been entirely re- 
covered, and yet the parifh affords, comparatively, few in- 
ftances of longevity. 



The chief old perfons in it are, 
William Crawford 
James Martin, Largs 
Robert Adam, Kipping-burn 
Alexander Hair, Outer- wards

In 1754, James Hendry died at Tourgill, aged 103 years. 
^Qt if the inhabitants of Largs do not live longer than thofe 



of Largs, 



of other pariflies, they certainly enjoy better health. Medi- 
cal affiftance is feldom neceffary, unlefs for thole who have 
been infedled elfewhere. 

Cattle. Owing to a clrcumftance formerly mentioned, 

there are probably more horfes in this parifh than in moft 
others of the fame extent. As they are continually chang- 
ing their paftures, and frequently their owners, it is impof- 
fible to calculate their number with precifion. From the 
moft accurate and authentic information, there are at prefent 
in the parifh, 

309 horfes 
2009 black cattle 
3460 fheep. 

The flieep are moftly of the Golloway breed. A few of the 
larger kind of Englifh fiieep have been lately tried, and have 
turned to good account. 

The wool is generally fold to the people of Kilmarnock, 
from 6 s. to 12 s. per ftone, and about 570 ftone is fold an- 
nually. 

It may be added, that fome hx)rfes and bb.ck cattle are fed 
in Kelburn parks after the firft ftock is removed. 

Roads, ^c, — The great road from Glafgow to Port-Pa- 
trick runs through the whole extent of the parifti. Formerly, 
it went over fome high roads towards the north end of it ; 
but, about five years ago, a new road was made from Skel- 
murly to Largs, along the fhore. The expence of this is 
defrayed by a toll at Kelly-bridge, rented at 72 1. 15 s. The 
converfion of ftatute labour is 47 1. 10 s. The roads is kept 
an good repair j there are bridges upon it, three of which are 
lately built. 

The 



5i3 Statlflical Account 

The reft of the parifl,. however, is in great ..ant of roads. 
There .s „o pr.vate road, of any great extent, kept in even 
tolerable repair, except the road to Brifbane, which was 
xnade, and is ftiU kept in repair at the proprietor's expence, 
though It is the only communication with the upper end of 
the parifli where it joins Kilmacolm. 

It is propofcd to make two new roads ; one over the hills, 
fo as to communicate with Kilbirny on the eaft, and Dairy 
on the fouth eaft, and another through to Kilmacolm on 
the north eaft. Thefe improvements, which have been 
often talked of, but never executed, would add confiderably 
to the value of the lands, and convenience of the inhabitants, 
by openmg a communication with many parts of the adjacent 
country, at prefent, in a great meafure, innacceflible, except 
by foot paflVngers, or horles accuftomed to the roads. On 
the fouth and north of the village of Largs are two large ri- 
vulets or burns. The water of Nodefdale to the north, and 
Oogo to the fbuth. 

Nodefdale is a very impetuous ftream. It runs through 
Mr Br.fbane's plealure grounds, where it has often commit- 
ted great depradations. Mr Brift^ane has frequently endea- 
voured to imbank it, and has been at great pains and expence 
in raifing mounds of earth to turn its courfe, but in vain. 

As foon as the heavy rains come, it overcomes all obftruc- 
tlons, and, running with unufual impetuofity through a light 
and gravely foil, has, in the courfe of a few years, deftroyed 
many acres of land to the proprietor.

3uality. Since the fifhermen came from the north country 
great quantities have been caught, which are moftly fold at 
Greenock and Port- Glafgow. The falmon fifliing is at pre- 
fent rented at 27 1. Mr Brift)ane's proportion is 20 1. The

It would produce much more profit were they not difper- 
fcd in fo many places, and at fuch a diftance from each 
other. 

Mackerel, haddocks, whitings, and cod, are caught on 
every bank in large quantities. A fingle boat, with four or 
five hands, has been known to take twenty ftone of them in 
a day. In 1793, when a number of boats were employed, it 
is computed, that, for the fpace of a month, they took, at an 
average, 1 8 ftone every day. 

They are fold, at the village of Largs, from i s. 6 d. to 2 s. 
per ftone i and, when carried to Paifley and the neighbour- 
ing towns, they bring at the rate of 3 s. 4 d. 

Confiderable quantities of herrings were formerly taken on 
this coaft, and fmaller quantities are ftill taken at a little dif- 
tance from it. 

Proprietors. — The proprietors in this parifti are, the Earl of 
Glafgow, Thomas Briibane of Brifbane, Colonel Hugh Mont- 
gomery of Skelmurly, William Blair of Blair, and Thomas 
King of Blackhoufe, befides William Wilfon of Hailley, and 
Daniel Frafer of Hangenheugh, who hold of the family of 
Briftjane, and thirteen feuers upon the eftate of Brift)ane. 

Of the more confiderable proprietors, Mr Brifl^ane of BriA 
bane is the only refiding one. 

There have been few changes of property in this parifli. 
The lands of Kelbum have been in poffeffion of the Earl of 
Glafgow's anceftors upwards of 500 years. 

Colonel Montgomery's anceftor was a fecond fon of Alex- 
ander Lord Montgomery, who lived in 1440. They conti- 
nued, in a dire£t male line, till the eldeft daughter, and heir- 
cfs of Sir Robert Montgomery of Skelmurly, married Alex- 
ander Montgomery of Colsfield. She was mother to the 
prefcnt proprietor.

^.^,.,./...-There are feveral caftles, and houfes of con- 
Cderable antiquity, in the parifh. Skelmuriy caftle was built 
in 1502, and had a new addition in 1636. 

The old caftle of Knock was built above 300 years ago. 
It was the property of an ancient family, of the n.ime of 
Frafer, defcended from John Frafer, third fon of Hugh Fra- 
fer of Lovat, and his wife Ifabel, daughter to Sir David 
Weems of Weems. They had a grant of thefe lands from 
King Robert III. in 1402. It is now in ruins, and belongs 
to Mr Brilbane of Brifbane* 

The caftle of Fairley, formerly poffeffcd by the ancient 
family of Fairley. faid to be dekended from a natural fon of 
King Robert II. is now alfo in ruins. It was built in 1521, 
and is now the property of the Earl of Glafgow. The old 
part of Kilburn-houfe was built in 1581. 

In Brifbane-houfe is an old chair, made of oak, dated 
1357. The arms of the family are carved, on the back, 
which are. 

Sable, a cheveron, cheque or and gules between three 
cuftiions of the fecond, with the initials of J. B. and E. H. 
This chair, being ftill in excellent prefervation, may ferve for 
many centuries to fhow the name and family of Brifbane to 
fucceeding generations. 

There are two moats, or mounds of earth, at each end of 
the village of Largs, of that kind called Law-hills, at the 
diftance of four miles up the water of Nodefdale, at a place 
called Tourgill. 

There 



Staiiflical Account 

There is one of a fimilar appearance, but much largei»; M 
IS now generally thoughc to be natural. 

On the top of the Knock-hill is the vcftige of a im^l 
camp, with three regular entrenchments. Above Hailley. 
and direaiy oppofite to the camp juft nxentioned, about the 
diftance of three miles, are the remains of an ancient fortifi- 
cation, which is ftili called the Caftle-hili. 

There are likewife feveral tumuli in the parifli, generally 
believed to have been raifed after the battle of Largs, over 
the bodies of the flain. This battle was fought in the reign 
of King Alexander III. in 1263, between the Scots and 
Norwegians. The Scotch army was commanded by Alex- 
ander btewart, grandfather to the firft Monarch of that fa- 
mily. The Norwegians or Danes, under Haco their King, 
were routed with great flaughter, and many of them taken 
prifoners. Haco himfelf efcaped, with great difficulty, to 
his fhips. 

The field of battle is ftrll fbown. A large plain, to the 
fomhward of the village of Largs, is flippofed to have beea 
the fcene of adtion. Cairns of ftones were on it, formed, it 
was faid,' over pits, into which the bodies of the flain were 
thrown. A courfe granite ftone, about 10 feet high, flood 
jn the centre of this field, fuppofed to be eredted over the 
body of a chieftain. It has now fallen down. 

The Earl of Gbfgow and Mr Bnfbane had, each of them, 
Danifh axes found in the field. Mr Eriibane prefented one 
of them to the Society of Antiquarians for Scotland. 

Mr Wilfon of Hailley, having occafion for Hones to in- 
clofe part of his grounds in the year 1772, opened a fmall 
hill, called Margaret's Law, fuppofed to be natural, but 
found to be a collection of ftones, containing upwards of 
15,000 cart loads; in the centre of which were difcovered 
iiVe ftone coffins, two of tkem containing five fculls each, 

with

InTc' parifh of Dairy, on the fouth-eaft boundary of 
Largs, is a fa.m, called Camp•h^/^, where the Scotch army is 
faid to have been encamped previous to the engagement. 

Between that and the village of Largs is Routdonburn. 
ibppofed to derive its name from a detachment of Haco's 
army being r6uted there; and Do,. is a contradion for 
Dane. What renders this more probable is, that, on the 
bank of the Routdonburn, is a large cairn of ftones i upon 
removing part of which, lately, a ftone coffia was found. 
Between that and the lea is Burly-gate ; a little lower, in the 
Earl of Glafgow's plantations, is Killing-craig j and farther 
fouthward is Kipping-burn, where, it is faid, a number of 
the flying Danes were met by Sir Robert Boyd, anceftor to 
the Earl of Kilmarnock, afterwards the friend and confident 
of the famous King Robert Bruce, and put to the fword. 

Thefe names are a kind of confirmation of a batile having 
happened at this place. \ 

Mifcellaneous Remarks.— The inhabitants of this parifh are, 
in general, fober, induftrious, and economical. 'Ihough 
they enjoy very few conveniencies for making money, many 
of them are poiTtfled of confiderable funis. 

Almoft all of them ff udy to provide for futurity ; and 
thus they are enabled to make the moft of their iituation. 
Accordingly, they are in general richer than many in the 
adjacent panihes, whole advantages are greater.

,.This fair is famous over the weft of Scotland, and con- 
tinues from Monday to Thurfday. Great numbers of people, 
from 40 or 50 miles round, relort to it, Tome for bufmels, 
and fome for pleafure. Upwards of 100 boats are often to 
be feen, on this occullon, riding in the Bay. 

The whole week is a kind of jubilee to the inhabitants, 
and a fcene of diverfion to others. 

Such a vaft muhitude cannot be accommodated with 
beds ; and the Highlanders, in particular, do not feem to 
think fuch accommodation neceffary. They fpend the whole 
night in ruftic Iports, caroufing and dancing on the green 
to the found of the bagpipe. Every one who choofes is al- 
lowed to join in this, which forms their principal amufement. 

The candidates for the dance are generally fo numerous, 
that it is kept up without intermiffion during the whole time 
of the fair. 

This was formerly the general meeting place of Highlanders 
and Lowlanders, for the purpofe of exchanging the conmio- 
dities which each of them could fpure for others of greater 
utility. 

Since fliops have been opened, and pedlars have vifited 
the diflferent iflands, this fair has gradually decrealed ; it is 
f\ill, however, better frequented than any in the country. 
Few fcenes can afford objefts more worthy of attention to 
the philofopher, who wifhes to contemplate human nature 
in its fimpleft and nrioft undifguifed forms, or to the benevo- 
lent man, who rejoices to fee that a great part of human 
happinefs belongs to the virtuous poor. 

Conclufion. — Fairley road is one of the mofi: convenient in 
the Frith of Clyde. Veffels of any burthen may ride in it at 
all fealbns, and loofe from it with any wind. 

Oppofitc 



5=2P Staiiflical Account 

Oppofite the village of Largs, the water is feveral fathoms 
deep almoft at the very fliore. The inhabitants have gene- 
rally a tafte for the fea; and many of them' have money, 
which might be employed to good purpofe in trade. 

All circuu.ftances contribute to render Largs proper for a 
fea- port town. Jhe only obftacles are, the want of a har- 
bour, and good roads through the country, to facilitate the 
conveyance of goods by land. Were thefe to be removed, 
fome kind of manufafture to be eftablifhed, and an aft of 
Parliament procured for the roads, levying harbour dues, &amp;c. 
the numbers and wealth of the inhabitants would at once be 
increafed ; and this would operate as a ftimulus to the im- 
provement of the foil. A place poffeffing fo many beauties 
and natural advantages, with the addition of trade and ma- 
nufaiTlures, would have inducements not only to retain the 
number of inhabitants, but to allure others to fettle there. 
If the parifli, however, has not the advantage of more opu- 
lent diftridls, in trade, manufadlures, and commerce, it is en- 
tirely free of the vices which luxury introduces ; and, in this 
troublefome and diftrafted period, the inhabitants, with the 
exception of a few individuals, may be truly faid both to 
fear God and honour their King.

Situation and Extent. 

TtlE parifh of Lethendy is fituated in the county of 
Perth, within the bounds of the fynod of Perth and 
Stirling, and prefbytery of Dunkeld. Its extent, in a direft 
line from eaft to weft, is five miles j its greateft breadth from 
fouth to north, a rhile and an half. It is bounded on the 
eaft by the Burn of Lunan, which divides it from the parifh 
of Blairgowrie, on the fouth by Caputh, and on the weft 
and north by Clunie, parifties. From the eafteirn extremity 
the ground rifes gently weftward the whole length of the pa- 
fifli, except on the weft point, where it falls fuddenly for 
about half a mile. The river Tay formerly wafhed the fouth 
weft fide of this parifti. It has now retired fouthward to 
the diftauce of nearly two miles, by cuts made at differer^t 
periods, leaving behind it, in feveral places, vifible traces pf 
its former courfe. 

Soil and Climate. — The weft half of the parifti is a black 
^ mould inclining to a rcddifti clay, excepting fome fmall cor- 
ners, exceedingly rich, and well adapted to all kinds of crops. 
Vol. XVII.. 3 U Towards 



Statl/lical Account 



Towards the eafl:, the foil becomes blacker, more wet, and 
lefs produaive. From the fouthern expofure of the pariflr, 
the climate is perhaps a licile milder than that of the parilhes 
immediately adjoining. The difference, however, is not ma- 
terial. -Harvefl commences ufually in the beginning of Sep- 
tember, and is over by the middle of 0ftober. 

State of Agriculture.—ThAxtj years ago, the bell lands ia 
the parifh were under fheep pafture, and from a bad breed, 
and probably , unlkilful management, yielded but a poor pit- 
tance to the proprietor, and but a very fcanty fubfiftence to 
the tenant. Since that period, flieep have been banifhed 
entirely ; the ufe of marl has been adopted ; the wafte lands 
have been cuhivated \ the rental of the parifh trebled ; the 
condition of the tenants meliorated ; and the face of the 
country entirely changed. But rapid as this improvement 
has been, it was much longer of having reached its prefent 
flatc, than a judicious treatment of the foil would have 
brought it. This obllruftion is principally to be afcribed, to 
a miftake refpedling the qualities of marl; and an error in 
the fyftem of cropping. Experience has now proved, that 
there is no nutritive quality in marl, that it arts only as a 
ftimulus to the foil, which," if not enriched with' different 
manure, it foOn exhaufts, and reduces to a ftate of ahiblute 
ftcrility. Want of attention to this circumftance, confider- 
ably retarded the improvements in agriculture in this, as well 
as in many other parts of the cbuntry. The lands, when firfl: 
marled, produced abundantly for feveral years without any 
other manure ; and, while they continued to do fo, were kept 
hi a ftate of conftant tillage, and oats frequently fown in perpe- 
tual fucceffion. From this improper management, the nutri- 
tious part of the foil was cxhaufted, and required a reft of 

many 



x)J Lethendy. 523 

many years, in order to recruit its prolific powers. Even 
tJiis ceflation from tillage was not followed with any material 
advantage. Artificial grafles were yet unknown ; and the 
ground, thus reduced, derived but little nourifhment from 
the natural and fcanty produftions of the foil- Thefe niif- 
takes, however, have been difcovpred, and their efFefe have 
now, in a good meafure, ceafed. The neceffi^ of following 
marl with dung is admitted on all hands, and the introduc- 
tion of artificial graflies into the lyftem of cropping univer- 
fally adopted. 

But though this practice has been followed with very be- 
neficial confequences, there is yet much room for further im- 
provement. Perhaps the rotation of crops is not the befl: 
that might be devifed, and the proportion of green crop to 
that of grain is ftiU too fmall. No uniform rotation is adop- 
ted in the parifh, nor is it always invariable on the fame 
farm. Where any thing like a fyftem is purfued, the fol- 
lowing is the moft general : Oats, barley, oats, green crop, 
or fallow ; oats, barley with grafs feeds. Probably oats, 
green crop, barley with grafs feeds, would be a better rota- 
tion. The green crop in this parifli confifts of potatoes, 
turnips, peafe, lint, nearly in equal proportions. There has 
been no wheat fown in this parifh till within thefe few years, 
nor is it yet cultivated to any extent, though the foil is by 
DO means unfavourable to it. This is partly owing to the 
influence of cuftom, and the fize of the farms. A great part 
of the parifh is divided into I'mall farms of about fix, eight, 
or ten acres, Thefe are generally occupied by tradefmen, 
whofe ideas are not fufiiciently enlarged for following the moft 
approved modes of hufbandry, and who confider their farms 
rather as a matter of convenience, than of profit. Eut if this 
drcumftance is lefs favourable to agricultural improvements ;

the lofs is perhaps more than balanced by its beneficial influ- 
ence upon population and morals. By dividing their time 
betwixt the labours of the field, and their occupations within 
doors, they are vigorous and healthy, their offspring accor- 
dingly are numerous and robuft ; they grow up in the habits 
of temperance and induftry, and are ftrangcrs to thofe courfes 
of difllpation and vice, to which the youth in great towns are 
ever expofed, and often fall a facrifice. 

'Traduce. — 'V\\\s parifh produces, annually, 1614 bolls of 
oats, 1 roo bolls of barley, 100 bolls of wheat, 100 bolls of 
peafe, Linlithgow meafure, 250 (tone of lint, Amfterdam ; 
and there are, besides, from 40 to 50 acres under potatoe and 
turnip crops. The returns from the feed in oats and barley, 
are from 5 to 8, in wheat from 10 to 12. The produce, ia 
lint is fro m 2s to 25 ftone per acre, and in potatoes from 40 
to 60 bolls. 

Woodlunds, — There are in this parlfh from 50 to 60 acres 
of natural wood, confifting chiefly of oak, birch, and hazle, 
which, from its fituation on the higheli ground of the dif- 
tria, and being furrounded with rich corn fields, both vr,ries 
and beautifies the fcene. It is cut generally once in 20 years, 
and is valuable, chiefly on account of the bark, ihere is, 
befides this, a confiderable quantity of afh around the 
farm houfes, fufiicient, perhaps, for fupplying the parifh with 
the implements of hulbandry.

occurred, in the memory of man,, which has been the fubjea 
of a criminal profecution. And, if their religious knowledge 
is not very extenfive, they are ftill lefs verfant in political 
creeds. The fpeculations of this nature, which have lately 
fo much engaged the attention of mankind, and which have 
been difcuffed by all parties with fo great warmth and un- 
charitablenefs, are here treated with much indifference. 
They indeed hear, and talk of reforms, and revolutions, and 
plots, and confpiracies, and armed affociatious, but without 
being the Icaft alarmed, and without feeling themlelves dif-

pofed to take an aaive part in fupport either of the one or 
of the other. To the war, however, in which we are en 
gaged, though their limited information doe. not enable 
them to pronounce , decifavely upon its juftice or neceffity 
yet, animated with the love of their country, they fincerely

Mechamcs.^ThtTt are in this parifli 13 vvreavers, 5 join- 
ers, 4 mafons, 2 fhoemakers, 2 taylors, 2 blackfmiths, z 
coopers, and 2 flax-drefTers. . 

Churches — Notwithftanding the fmall fize of this pariQi, 
it is provided with three churches; one belonging to the 
Eftablifliment, one to the Antiburgher Seceders, and one to 
the Englifli Epifcopals. Of thefe, the Eftabliflied Church is 
by far the worft in point of ftruaure and accommodation. 
None of . the heritors refide in the p.irifh, and confequently 
lefs attention is paid to keep it in a ftate of any decent re- 
pair. The other two are more in the ftile of modern build- 
ings, and much better fitted up for the accommodation of the 
liearers. The whole parifli, however, are of the Eftabliflied 
Religion, excepting 24 Seceders, of whom alfo the greater 
part are women. The Englifli Chapel was ereded in this 
parifli, merely from its being the rnoft central fituation for 
accommodating a few families in the neighbourhood. 

' Manfe, Glehe^ and Living.~The manfe was built 8 years 
ago, and is a fmall, but fubftantial houfe. It is remarkable 
for its being the fubjedl of a long law-fuit, in which the 
principal heritor infixed that the Court of Seffion, in award- 
ing a fum for the building of a new manfe, could not exceed 
joool. Scotch, by the acl 1663. This queftion was tried 
before the Houfe of Peers ; and the judgment of the Court 

of 



of Leihendp 5^7 

of Seffion, whereby they had exceeded that fum, was af- 
firmed. 

The glebe confifts of about 6 acres of rich arable land. 
The living of ihe eftabliihed clergyman is 6i bolls and 9 
pecks of visual ; 17I. Sterling; 3^ "P^"'^' 43 PonltvY 
and the tenth of lint, lamb, and wool. 

SMmn/er.—The provifion for a fchoolmafter In this 
parifli is 40 1. Scotch, with the fchool fees, and 8 1. Scotch 
for adling as feffion-clerk. Even this paltry fum, it would 
feem, is reluftantly beftowed. The laft fchoolmafter died 
10 years ago; the fchool-houfe had been in ruins long be- 
fore ; and the heritors have never yet found it convenient to 
provide us either with one, or with the other ; an irrepa- 
rable lofs to the rifing generation. Some fteps, however, 
will foon be taken, for having this opprobrious grievance 
effedtually removed. 

Poor. There are no poor's rates eftabliflied in this parifli. 

The weekly collections in the church, with the intereft of a 
fmall fum of money, have hitherto been fufBcient for the 
fupport of the poor. There are, at prefent, 3 only upon the 
roll, aged, infirm people; and even thefe require but a fmall 
trifle, in addition to the fruits of their own induftry. The 
average weekly colkflion is from 2S. to is. 6d. Sterling. 

Prices of Labour and Prov'tfions — The wages of a man-fer- 
vant are from 10 1, to lal. Sterling a year ; of a woman-fer- 
vant, from 4I. to 5 1. with vi£lua!s. Day-labourers receive 
from [5 d. to 18 d. a day in fummer, and about i s. in win- 
ter, without victuals. Oat-meal is here the principal .food 
of the people; and generally fells at i s. the peck. Butter

fells at pd. per lib.; cheefe at from 4 s. to 5 s. per ftonci 
Amlteraam ; beet and mutton at from 3 d. to 4 d. per lib. 

Raads.^Thtrt are two roads which divide the parlfh near- 
ly into four equal parts, one of which runs from eaft to weft, 
and the other from fourh to rtorth. Eoth of them have' 
been long negleded, and are at prefent in a ftate of wretched 
repair. In winter, they are often totally impaflhble for car- 
riages of any kind. There is alfo a branch of road, prefently 
forming, leading along the fouth-weft fide of this parifh to 
the new bridge of Ifla, and to the turnpike road from thence 
Jo Perth, which will prove a confaderable benefit to the 
country. 

Gefieral O^/ervatiof/s. —This parlfh is but ill provided iri 
fuel. They carry their coal from Perth, at the diftance 
nearly of 1 2 miles, and pay for them at the rate of 5 s. for 
every 40 ftone weight. Peat-mofs, however, is more gene- 
rally ufed, which they alfo bring from a confiderable dif- 
tance ; and, taking into account the time and labour wafted 
in digging, drying, and carrying it home, is ftill more expen- 
five than coal. There is indeed a fmall quantity of mofs in 
the parifh, but the liberty of making it into fuel, is confined 
entirely to the tenants of the proprietor. 

Want of inclofares, is another difadvantage this parifh la- 
bours under. A fmall part of the parifh only is yet inclofcd ; 
and, from the fmall fize of the farms, and the want of fpirit, 
and even ability in the tenants, it is not likely that this object 
will be loon accomplifhed. It is hoped the proprietors will 
fee their own intereft in lending them fome alliftance. 

To make up, however, for thefe difadvantages. We have 
an eafy accefs to the means of improving the foil. There is 
great ftore of fhell marl in the neighbouring parifli of Kin- 
loch, 



cf Let bendy, 5^9 

loch, at the diftance only, of about two miles. This has 
contributed, in a great meafure, to the prefect improved Itatc 
of the country. There is alfo marl in the parifh ; but, as it 
lies at fome depth under mofs and water, and would be at- 
tended with fome difficulty in draining, it has never beea 
eonfidered as of much utility. Equally near, in the par.(h of 
Caputh, there is an inexh.mftible llore of iime-ftone, of a 
good quality. There are. at prefbnt, extenfive preparations 
making for burning it 5 and, notwithllanding the diilance 
from coal, it is expefted it can be fold lb low as will enable 
the farmer to ufe it with advantage. 

Long leafes, and moderate rents, are likcwife favourable 
circumftances in this pariQi. The leafes, in general, arc for 
19 years, and during the life of the holder after the expira- 
tion of that period. Some of them extend the length even 
of two lives. The rent of the beft land in the panlh does 
not exceed 20 s. and the greater part is below 15 s. per acre. 
Thus the tenants are in a good meafure independent, and 
enjoy all the neceflarics, and many of the comforts and coa- 
veniencies of life.

<p>

Name, Extent^ ^c. 

BALFRON is a word of Gaelic derivation, and Is faid 
to fignify the Town of Sorrow." On what account 
the place obtained this name is not certainly known. The 
form of the parifii is nearly an oblong fquare. Its length, 
from eaft to weft, is' fomewhat more than 8 miles ; and its 
breadth, from north to fouth, from i to 2 miles. It is 
bounded by the parifhes of Dryraen, Kiilearn, Fintry, Gar- 
gunnock, and Kippen. The greater part of the grounds in 
this parifli have the advantage of a fine fouthern expofure, 
rifing gradually from the water of Endrick, 

Climate, Soil, ^c, — The climate is wet, but not unhealthy, 
feveral of the inhabitants living to a great age j and there 
are few inftances of epidemical difeafes. An epidemical 
fever, indeed, prevailed in the winter and fpring of 1791, 
and carried off, in the village, upwards of 40 grown up 
people. But this mortality may be afcribed, not fo much to 
the unhealthinefs of the climate, as to the intemperance of 
the people at the time, and the damp flate of many new 

houfesj 



ef Balfron* 53* 

Boufes, which were occupied as foon as they were covered 
in, and plaftcred. 

The foil is various. In fome places it is light and fandy, 
but, for the moft part, wet and tilly. 

Agriculture is here in a ftate of infancy. The principal 
corn crop is oats. Barley is raifed but in few places i and 
green crops are feldom attempted. Among the difadvan- 
tages that have h.'therto retarded agricultural improvements, 
may be reckoned the badnefs of the roads, the diftance from 
foreign manure, and efpecially the poverty of the greater 
part of the farmers to whom the land is at prefent let, in 
Very fmall portions. Their rents are from 5 1. to 35 1. i two 
or three of them about 701.-, and one only up to 100 1» 
Sterling. But the difadvantages under which the parifti has 
hitherto laboured, are now in the way of being removed, or 
Ibfficiently compenfated, by the extraordinary advantages 
^rifing from fome new manufadluring eftablifhments and, 
in as far as their influence has hitherto extended, to improve- 
ments in agriculture, as foil has appeared very fufceptible 
of melioration. There is abundant reafon, indeed, for fup- 
pofing, that a fpirit for fuch improvements will not be difficult 
to excite j for, of late, many fubftantial inclofures have been 
made in different parts of the pariQi, and particularly on the 
eftate of Ballindalloch, where, in addition to thefe, there 
have been feveral plantations of wood formed, with an equal 
regard to beauty and utility. ■ 



ManufaBures, ^c. — About the beginning of the year 
1789, Robert Dunmore, Efqi of Ballindalloch, introduced 
a colony of cotton weavers into the parifti. For thefe, he, 
at firft, built a few houfes, at his own expence, in the neigh- 
bourhood of the church, and let them out at a fmall yearly 
rent. This branch of manufacture was immediately carritd 

on 



, Stattjlicd Acmni 



on to fuch an extent, that the value of goods manufaaufed^ 
during the currency of the year 1792, amounted to the fum 
of 7676 1. SterUng. 

^ In the fprlngof the year 1790, the public fpirited exer- 
tions of Mr Dunmore having been already direfted to this 
corner, he applied himfelf, vith fuccefs, to procure the erec- 
tion of a cotton mill in the neighbourhood of his new vil- 
lage ; and a happy firuation having been chofen on the banks 
of the water of Endrick, the work was carried on, through 
his means, with fuch aftonifliing difpatch, that, in the month 
of June of the fame year, yarn was fpun in it. This branch 
of ^manufacture, in December 1792, gave employment to 
390 people. Of thefe, 120 were men; 90 women; 180 
children, from 6 to 16 years of age. 

The cotton mill, thus erected, fully anfwered the purpofe 
of extending and improving the village. Mr Dunmore readi- 
ly feued out ground, to the new fettlers, for the fite of a 
houfe and garden, moft commonly to the extent of a quarter 
of an acre, and, at firfl:, upon fuch eafy terms as to afford 
them ample encouragement ; but here, as in many other 
cafes, well diredled liberality proved good policy ; for the 
confequent profperity of his village, and its manufaftures, 
foon enabled him to raife the rate of his feu-duty from 2 1, 
to 4I. per acre, without retarding the progrefs of building, 
qr at all diftrefBng the people. The houfes, in general, are 
fubftantial. Moil of them are covered with flate ; and fome 
of them are three ftories high. The village now confifts of 
105 new houfes, in which there are upwards of 430 rooms 
with fire places. 

For the rapid rife, and increafe of the population of this 
new village, we are partly indebted to a printfield and bleach- 
field, which Mr Dunmore, with the fame patriotic views, 
procured to be eftablilhed upon the oppolite banks of tha

Roads.— within thefe few years, the roads of this parifli, 
during the winter months, were almoft impaffible ; but in this 
refpedt alfo, we have derived much advantage from the in- 
troduftion of our manufaftures, and the fpirited exertions of 
the gentlemen who has fo laudably patronized them. In 
this particular line of improvement, indeed, the other land- 
ed proprietors, not immediately connefted with the mercan- 
tile or manufafturing interefts, readily afforded him the moft 
liberal and manly fupport, and thereby materially promoted 
both the particular interefts of the manufadluring eftablifli- 
ments, and the general good of the country ; in which view 
Peter Spiers, Efq; of Culcreuch, a confiderable heritor in this 
parifh, ought to be particularly mentioned with honour. In 
confequence of thefe exertions, a bridge of two arches, at 
Ballindalloch, has been thrown over the Endrick, which, 
when fuoelledy is a rapid and dangerous river. A turnpike 
road has been made from Glafgow to the village of Balfron, 
and leading from it into the military road between Stirling 
and Dumbarton. Another turnpike road has alfo been made, 
which, paffing through the eaft end of this parifh, leads from 
Kippen to Glafgow. Good crofs roads are begun to be 
formed, and confiderable progrefs has been made in them. 
Arches have been thrown over all the dreams of water, and 
hollow places ; fo that there is now the certain profpe£t of 
having good roads through every part of the parifli.

The people employed at the printfield and bleachfield, 
are almoft wholly of the Relief and Burgher Perfuafion ; and, 
befides thefe already mentioned as refiding in the village in 
December 1792, there were feveral families of the fame per- 
fuafions who had given a temporary adherence to the Eftab- 
L&amp;ed Church ; but at Whitfunday ,793 being joined, all at 
once, by fo many of their fed, each party immediately fet up 
a tent lor themfelves, and have ever fince been contending, 
with much animofity, for the honour of making profelytes! 
It is not, therefore, eafy to afcertain the prefent ftate of the 
parilh, with refpea to feftaries; and it is ftill more difficult 
to fay what it will be a few years hence. 

Till very lately, there was no regular record kept of births, 
deaths, and marriages. From Whitfunday 1 792 to Whitfun- 
^^7 I793» there were 67 births, 46 deaths, and 30 mar- 
riages.

thtrch and Stipend. Poor, School.^The manfe and offices 
were built new from the foundation in 1789, and the church, 
which is neat, and even elegant, in 1793. The value of the 
ftipend is from 70 1. to 80 1. Sterling, according to the rife 
or fall of grain, part of it being paid in meal and barley. The 
glebe confifts of about 18 acres. The Earl of Kinnoul is pa- 
tron. 

The poor have hitherto been well provided for, out of the 
colleftions made at the church, dues of mortcloths, and the 
intereftof about 100 L Sterling of poor's money but that 
they will continue to be much longer fo, out of thefe funds, 
confidering the great influx of inhabitants, is very doubtful. 
There are no vagrant poor in the parifh. 

The fchoolmafter's falary is 100 1. Scotch, out of which he 
pays, annually, 2 1. Sterling for a perfon to teach a fchool in 
a diftant part of the pm£h. Befides the parifli dues, which 
are now pretty confiderable, the fchoolmafter has fomewhat 
more than an acre of land, originally fued by the feffion for 
his behoof. This piece of ground was lately exchanged for 
an equal quantity, with much advantage to the fchoolmafter, 
by Mr Dunmore, as it flood in the way of fome of his im- 
provements. Upon the ground Mr Dunmore gave in ex- 
change, he built, at his own expence, a neat and commodi- 
ous fchool room, with a lodging for the mafter, of 4 rooms, , 
all under one roof, , 

Mifcellaneous Ohfervations. — Peat and turf, of which there 
are great abundance in the parifh, were, previous to 1790, 
almoft the only fuel ufed j but, fince roads were made, coal 
is chiefly burnt, at leaft by the people in the village. It is 
brought from Campfie or Baldernock, the carriage being up- 
wards of ten miles. Red and white freeftone are found in 
great plenty. There is alfo llme-ftone. Repeated attempts 

have

have been made to find coal, of which, in the opinion of 
good judges, there are the oioft flattering appearances, tho» 
hitherto without fuccefs. The price of labour, of all kinds, 
is of late advanced more than a third. In many inftances, 
it is doubled. In the, year 1787 the wages of an ordinary 
man fervant were from 4 1, to 6 1. a^year. In 1 794 they are 
from 8 1. to 10 1. A day labourer, in 1787, could have been 
hired for 7 d. or 8 d. per day ; but in 1794 they require i s. 
or I s. 6 d. or 1 s. 8 d. From the vicinity of Glafgow, and 
the eafy accefs to it, the price of provifions is now, in a great 
meafure, regulated by the Glafgow market. There is no 
public houfe in the parifli, excepting in the village, where 
there are a tolerably good inn, and two rcfpeclable public 
houfes. There are, befides, a great many low public houfes, 
which deal only in whilky, and which are produflive of the 
worft effects, both to the health and morals of the people.

ELY, the modern name, Elie or Ellie, the did riamej 
is fo called from A Liche, in Gaelic, " Out of the fea, 
" or out of the water," the town being built fo near the 
fea, that it wafhes the walls, in fome places. The houfes 
are preferved with great difficulty by fea dykes, notwith- 
ftanding which, the fea is yearly making great incroach-

of the fea, the fea is fifl: refuming what it gave. 

Ely has a moft pleafant, dry, and healthy fituation. The 
flriore is fandy, and (helving gradually ; is remarkably well 
adapted for fea-bathing ; and is, of late, much rcforted to for 
that purpofe. It is a mile and a half long, and about a mile

excepted, lately purchafed by Captain Chriftie of Bal- 
chriftie. 

Fi/Jjeries.—Thtvt are 8 fifliermen belonging to this parifli. 
They have houfes, rent free, from Sir John Anftruther, fu- 
perior of this place, on condition of their fupplying the town 
of Ely with fifli, at lead: three times a week. They are well 
fituated for carrying on the fiflieries, and, on the whole, are 
pretty fuccefsful. 

Lake. There is a beautiful lake, called Kilconquhar Loch; 

bounded by that parifli and Ely. In it there are plenty of 
pike? and eels. The fifliing, however, is of no great value, 
and will naturally be more fully defcribed in the Statiftical 
Account of Kilconquhar. 

Poor. — ^The feflion here maintains all its poor. No beg-  
gars belong to the parifli. There are about 20 regular pen- 
fioners, who receive a fmall funi monthly, befides others 
who get charity occafionally, as their wants require. The 
funds for their fupport amount tp about 50 1. per annum. 

Inclofures. — The whole parifli was indofed with ditch and 
hedge by Sir John Anftruther. The inclofures are kept ia 
great order, and are very ffauriflilng. The burgh acres, 
near the town, anno 1790, let at about 40 s, and the large 
farms at 30 s. per acre, but have fince rifen. Burgh acres 
now (anno 1795) let at between 50 s. and 60s. the acre; and 
large farms between 40 s. and 50 s. Sir John Anftruther 
lately let a farm, of near 100 acres, at 3 1. per acre. 

Fuel. — Coal is the only fuel ufed here. There is an ex- 
cellent coalwork, belonging to Sir John Anftruther, 3 miles 

from

from this parifh. The price of coals, independent of carnage, 
in 1790, was 3 ^. for 75 ftones, and 4 s. 4 d, for 75 ftones of 
a better quality, but is now 4 s. for 75 ftones of the firft fort, 
and 5 s. for the other. 

IV ages.— Men fervants wages, befides maintenance, were 
from 5 1. to 6 1. per anniim^ and women from i 1. to 2 1. the

Harbour, bfc. — There is an excellent harbour at Ely. It 
is the deepen in the Frith of Forth, Bruntifland excepted. It 
has remarkably eafy accefs, and is perfeftly lafe. It is the 
refort of more wind-bound velTels, than any other harbour, 
perhaps, in Scotland. It has alfo been the means of faring 
many a fhip, cargo, and feaman, that would otherwife have 
been driven out of the Frith j many of them being fo poorly 
manned and proviGoned, that they never would have been 
able to regain the coafl:. This ufeful harbour, however, is 
going faft to ruin. It were much to be wiflicd, that fome 
public fpirited perfon would recommend it to the attention 
of the Chamber of Commerce, or the Convention of Roval 
Burghs, to obtain fome aid to put it in a better ftate. An 
inconfiderable expence, in proportion to the importance and 
utility of the object, would completely repair it. It may be 
remarked, alfo, that the value of the flupping brought in, 
bears but a fmall proportion to that of their cargoes, which 
are often grain and other perifhable commodities, that might 
fuffer by being expofed to a ftorm, even though the Ihip were 
to weather it. There are, belonging to this place, feven 
icjuare rigged veficls, carrying 1000 or 1 100 tons, all employ- 
ed

ed in foreign trade, and one floop ufed as a coafter. Veff:ls, of 
aconfiderable fize, are built here. There is a manufaaure of 
check and bed tikes, and alfo of ropes, by the Meffrs Wood. 

Ecclefwjlk State —Sir John Anftruther is fole patron of 
the church ot Ely. There are a few Seceders, Independents, 
and Bereans ; but the great body of i:he people bc.long to the 
Eftabliftied Church. The ftipend of Ely is 80 I. old fnpend, 
and 20 1. lately given voluntarily by Sir John Anftruther, in 
all ICO 1. The fchoolmafter's falary is 1 1 1. Part of the 
pariih lies in the very heart of Kiiconquhar parilh, owing 
to this, that at the disjundion, the proprietor of Ely wHlied 
all belonging to that barony to be in the parifii. 

Mifcellatjeous Obfervathns.^l^tzr the town of EJy, is the 
cave of M«DufF, Thane of Fife, a ftupendous arch, in the 
face of Kmcraig rocks, fronting the fea. In this place,.Mac- 
duff hid and defended hiniielf. by a fortification, againft his 
purfuers, when he was flying from M^Beath, to the King's 
fon, Malcolm, in England. The inhabitants of Earlsferry, 
(fo called from E^rl M'Duff,) ferried him over to North 
Berwick and out of gratitude, when the King's fon was re- 
ftored, he got the town made a Royal Borough, which it 
ftiU is, and retains ail its privileges, but that of fending a 
member to Parliament, which privilege it loft., owing to its 
being unable to maintain its member, and its having petition- 
ed to be relieved from the burden. It is in the fame litua- 
tion with Falkland, Newburgh, and fome other towns in 
Scotland. Tradition fays, that, among other things, Mac- 
duft' obtained this privilege from the King, that, on the ap- 
plication of a criminal, the town is obliged to ferry him over 
immediately, and dare not ferry over his purfuers, till he is 
half way over the Frith. This, it is faid, was claimed and 

granted

, Extent. 

THE length of this pari Oi, from fouth to north, Is about 
5o miles, and its greateft breadth 20. It is bounded 
bytheparifliofKilmalie to the weft, by Fortingal to the 
fouth caft, by Laggan to the eaft, by Glenelg and Kintail to 
the north, and by Bolelkinc to the north eaft. Its appear- 
ance is very much divcrfified by ranges of lofty mountains; 
towards the extremities, interfeded by extenlive glens in dif- 
ferent direilions, and rapid rivers, which all difcharge them- 
felves into the river Lochy, the common refervoir, which 
runs into a branch of the Atlantic at Fort- William. 

Climate. -^From the vicinity of this parlfli to the weftern 
ocean, and its being furrounded by very high mountains, 
which attract the clouds, the climate is extremely rainy ; 
confequently, the inhabitants, though in other refpe£ts 
healthy, are frequently troubled with the rheumatifra.

J-gnculture-hz, made little ^progrefs in- this country, as 
the whole parifl. is more fuited to grazing, particularly fl.eep- 
farming ; another caufe that may be affigned for this, is, that 
the vvetnefs of the climate is an invincible bar to the raifing 
of corn, fnfficient for the fubfiftence of the inhabitants. The 
only crops are barley, oats, and potatoes ; the laft of which 
IS the ftaple commodity. The number of H.eep in this parifli 
amounts to about 60,000, that of black cattle to 1500, and 
the number of horfes may be computed at 500. 

Populathn.—Tht number of inhabitants amounts to about 
2400, of whom about 1200 are Proteftants, and 1200 Roman 
Catholics. The return to Dr Webfter in 1755, was 1400 
Papifts, and 1595 Proteftants, total 2^95. The decreafe 
confequently is, at leaft, 495 fouls. 

Wages and Prices. ^Mz{\ers of families in this country la- 
bour under difficulties in regard to fervants, being obliged to 
give a {billing per day to the men, and a lixpence to the 
women. The prices of moft of the commodities of life are 
exceedingly extravagant, oat meal in particular, which, com- 
mimibus annis, may be rated at 18 s. only 8 ftones to the boll 
and feed corn at the fame price. Owing to the want of a 
public market, the price of beef arid mutton cannot be af^ 
certained ; none being nearer than that of Invernefs. 

Manners.— fame hofpitality which charaaerifed the 
ancient Caledonians, of whom they may be conlidered the 
genuine defcendants, continues to be praaifcd. Another 

qualification 



of Kibnanhaig, 



545 



qualification which they have derived from tJieir anceftors, 
and which they poffcfs, in a confiderable degree, is courage. 
Civilization and induftry are making daily progrefs ; and were 
they fet upon a proper plan, and had due encouragement, 
they would become as flouriOiing as their local fituation 
would permit. From the well knbwn charafters ,of the pro- 
prietors, little doubt can be entertained that this will be xht 
cafe. 

Language— Gaelic is the langtiage of the natives, 
who fpeak it in as great purity as in any part of the High- 
lands. Many of them underftand the Englifh language, 
and fpeak it with accuracy. 

Church. — This parifli was formerly conne£led with the 
biflioprick, and afterwards with the fynod of Argyle, and^ 
prefbytery of Lorn, till the year 1724, when it was difmem- 
bered from faid prefbytery, and united to thole parilhes 
which now compofe the prt-fbytery of Abertarph, and form 
a part of the fynod of Glcnelg. The minifter's ftipend is a 
thoufand pounds Scotch, though there is ftill a great deal of 
unexhaufted tiends. There is neither manfe nor glebe ; in 
place of which the heritors allow the prefent incumbent 20 I. 
Sterling yearly. There are two miffionaries who are partly 
connected with this pariih, and two Roman Catholic, clergy- 
men. 

Schools. — ^There is one parochial fchool here, with a falary 
of 15 I. Sterling per annum^ and other pcrquifites arifing from 
baptifms and marriages, together with fchool-fees. Tiaere 
are generally from 20 to 50 fcholars thoughout the year. In

There are no funds for the. poor, but the weekly collec- 



tions. 



^w/i^rw/xVj- —One of the greatefl antiquities of this parifli 
is the old ruin of the Caltle of Inyerlochy. There was, at 
one time, a thriving borough, of the fame name, adjacent to 
this building, which fome of the old Scotch hiftorians call 
the Emporium of the weft of Scotland j but of this borough, 
there are now no other veftiges, than fome paved works ia 
different places, which were probably the ftreets of it. The 
caftle has furvived the burgh, and now ftands alone in an- 
cient magnificence, after having feen the river Lochy, that 
formerly filled its ditches, run in another courfe, and outlived 
all hiftory, and all tradition, of its own builder and age. It 
is a quadrangular building, with round towers at the angles, 
meafuring 30 yards every way within the walls. The towers 
and ramparts are folidly built of ftone and lime, 9 feet thick 
at the bottom, and drawing in to the thicknefs of 8 feet 
above. As to the height of the towers, they are not fo en- 
tire as to fhow what it was, nor are they all equally high, 
as it is probable they were all on a level at top and {landing 
upon uneven ground ; the weftern tower, which flood on the 
loweft foundation, is the higheft of them all, and the largeft 
every way. It does not feem to have been lefs than 50 feet 
when it was all entire j and the reft of the towers may pro- 
-bably have been about 40 feet in height. The rampart be- 
tween them feems, in general, to be about 25, and from that 
to 30. The inner area feems to have been uncovered ; but 
all the towers were, probably, roofed, by placing fome cover 
above a joifting of beams of wood, for which there are ftili 
remaining fome fquare openings in the walls at the top, as 

well 



of Kilmani'valg, 547 

well as below that, for the floors of the firft and fecond 
ftories. Ten or i2 yards without the walls, the ditch begins, 
which furroundcd the caftle from 30 to 40 feet broad, and 
was filled with water from the river. The whole building, 
including the towers,, covers about 1600 yards j and, within 
the outlidc of the ditch, are 7000 fquare yards, which is 
nearly an acre and a half of EngliQi meafure. 

At the hand gate, between the fouth and eaft towers, 
there are fome remains of a building for the draw-bridge. 
The gate is 9 feet wide, and arched to the fame height, 
with abutments of 14 feet at each fide, to ftrengthen it 
within. There was alfo another gate, direftly oppuiite to 
this one, of nearly the fame fize, which probably might an- 
fwer as a water gate, and lead into the river. Befides thefe 
two principal entries, three of the towers were provided with 
fally ports, one from each tower, well contrived, and clofe 
to the arrow-holes, which alio flanked and defended them. 
To the loweft ilory of each tower, there is a door, leading 
in from. the inner area of the cattle, and a winding ftair up 
to the fecond ftory through the heart of the wall. From 
the fecond ftory there is alfo a door on each fide of every 
tower, leading up to the top of the rampart, a curtain wall 
between the towers. This wall had a parapet oi flone, 2 
feet thick, outfide and infide, between which the troops 
might Hand in fecurity, and defend themielves with miffile 
weapons from the top of it. The whole was evidently de- 
fended by arrows. Every tower is built with loop holes on 
each fide of it, fo contrived as to flank the whole curtain of 
the rampart as far as the next tower. Thefe arrow-holes, 
or perpendicular flits in the walls, are well contrived to al- 
low the archers a free aim, and defend them at the fame 
time from any weapons without. The weflern tower, which 
is always called the Cumming's ioivcry is 42 feet diameter over 

wallsj 



54S 



Statiftical Account 



walls, and 24 feet within them. In the lowefc ftory of \t 
we find 3 arrow holes ; in the fecond ftory 4 ; and in the 
third ftory 8 or 9, all of them faced with free- ftone, 24. 
inches wide on the outfide, and extending to the breadth of 
7 feet within, and 6 feet high. There is a chimney in the 
middle ftory of each tower, large, and running through the 
wall obliquely, and alfo a window opening to the inner court 
of the building, ana a door on each fide, leadmg to the top 
of the adjoining walls, by ni'^ans of which all the towers and 
ramparts could eafily communicate with one ax^o^her. 

The middle ftory of each tower feems to have been allot- 
ted for the principal people to occupy, as it was furnilhed 
with a fpacious window and a chminey ; but the lower fto- 
ries had no light, except what came in by the arrow-holes, 
unlefs the door was open which led into the inner court. 
The whole building, ramparts, and towers, would require 
from 500 to 600 men to defend it, befides referves; but the 
number of troops that might occupy it cannot be exactly 
Jcnown, as the curtains of the ramparts, outfide and infide, 
are perforated, in many places, probably for beams of wood 
to form a (hade, under which men or cattle might lodge in 
fafety. 

From the name of the weftern fower, it is probable that 
this caftle was occupied by the Cummings in the time of 
Edward 1. of England, when they were moft powerful; and, 
previous to that period, by the Thanes of Lochaber, among 
others by the noted Bancho, predecelTor of the race of 
Stewart. There is a tradition, that this caiile was once a royal • 
refidence, and that the famous league betwixt Charles the 
Great of France, and Achaiu-: King of Scots, had been fign- 
ed there, on the part of the Scotch Monarch, about the laft 
years of the 8th century. But this point can be beft'deter- 
piined by thole who have accefs to our ancient records. 

What 



of Kilmanivalg* 54-9 

What credit can we give the conftant diminution of 
the fize of the human body, which auchors are lometunes 
fondly telling us of, when the arrow embrafures m th.s old 
ruin, are not an inch higher, than what would render them 
convenient for us, even at this day ? , . , r 

Another antiquity, which this pariCh can .boaft, .s tae .a- 
mous parallel roads, one of the mofl ftupendous monuments 
of human induftry, and which well delerve the attention of 
the antfquary. They arc to be feen in the eaftern part of 
this pari&amp;, on the declivitjes of fteep and lofty mountains, 
^yhich extend for 7 or 8 miles on each fide of the water of 
Roy, in the difeaion of fouth-weft and north-eaft, and the 
opening betwixt which forms the valley that goes under the 
name of G/enroy. There were originally 3 lines of thefe 
roads on each fide of the glen, each correfponding in height 
to the one oppofite to it ; the lowermoft, however, is in 
fome parts effaced, particularly on the fouth fide. They all 
run parallel to each other, and in an horizontal direaion, 
humouring the windings of the mountains. Their dimen- 
fions are various; in gener.'.!, they are from 60 to 70 feet in 
breadth; and the diftance betwixt two of them has. been 
found to be about 180. Similar roads are likewife to be 
feen in two of the adjacent glens, but not in fuch perfeaion. 

As there is nothing left upon record refpeaing the time 
when, the perfons by whom, or the purpofes for which thefe 
roods were confiruaed, we can only mention the common 
traditions concerning them. One is, that they were made 
by the Kings of Scotland, when the royal rcfidcnce was in 
the caftle of Inverlochy, which is not above 1 1 miles from 
the neareft of them ; and, what gives an appearance of truth 
to this tradition, in the opinion of thofe who maintain it, is, 
that the conftruaion of thefe roads wa-s fo vaft an underta- 
king, fis could not be effcaed by any vaflal or nobleman, 

however 



•S'"^® Btatiflical Account 

Wver powerful. Another tradition, which is that of the 
natives, ,s, that they were made by the Fingalians ; and. un. 
der the name of b'tngaUan roads *, they are ftiU known 
m this country. Of this the natives are convinced. fr„m 
this circumrtance, that feveral ot the h.lls ot this glen 
have retained, from time immemorial, the names of fome 
of the heroes cf Fingal ; fuch as, the hill of Gaul, the 
fon of Morni ; that of Diarmid, and of TiUan 5 and like- 
wife of Bran., the famous dog of Fingal, &amp;c. Now, the po- 
pular beuef cannot be conlidered as a direcl'proof of any 
opinion, yet we cannot help remarking, that the original 
tradition (which, in this cafe, has been always invariable) 
gives a ftrong degree of credibility to the exiftence of luch 
heroes, and renders it by no means improbable that thefe 
extraordinary roads have been the refuh ot their labours. 
The purpofe which they were defigned to ferve, feems to 
have been (agreeably to the common opinion) to facilitate 
the excrcife of hunting ; for, in ancient times, and indeed 
till within this century, the valley was covered with wood, 
which made it very difficult to purfue the deer, &amp;c. and ren- 
dered certain avenues necelTary for cffeding this purpofe ; 
• in corroboration of which opinion, it may be obferved, that 
upon the fides of the roads, there have been found fome 
flakes fixed in the ground, probably the remains of the pa- 
lings or fences, which in thofe days were made ufe of to con- 
fine the game, till they were driven in upon a field, called 
BaUna-fealg^ or hunting dale, where, the prefumption is, 
they were killed. 

* They are likewife called the Cafan, \. e. the roads, by way 
of eminence. They prove that Sir Alexander Murray of Stan- 
hope's celebrated plan for parallel canals, even in mountainous 
countries, is not imprafticable.

Name, Extent^ ^c. 

THE parifli of Aughtergaven is fituated In the flalre of 
Perth, within the bounds of the fynod of Perth and 
Stirling, and the prefbytery of Dunkeld. It is nine miles ia 
length from eaft to weft, and about five miles in brea'dth 
from north to fouth. Its general furface meafures above 
1 2,000 acres Scotch j but a great proportion of this con- 
fifts of hills and muirs, or wafte uncukivated ground. A 
fmall neighbouring parifli, called Logiebride, had formerly 
been annexed to Aughtergaven. No accounts can be had of 
the particular time when this annexation took place, from 
tradition, or from the records of prefbytery, in which the 
pariOi is always named Oughter, or Aughtergaven *. The 
people refiding in the diftrifts that belonged to Logiebride 
parifh continue to bury in the churchyard at Logiebride. 
A part of the church is yet (landing, and is ufed as a bury- 
ing-ground by the family of TuUybelton. It is diftant two 
Englifti miles from Aughtergaven church. Above 50 years

ago, the minifters of Au^htergaven occafionally preached at 
Logiebride, but none of the parifhioners remember of any 
minifter refiding there. The barony of Tullybeagles is in- 
cluded in this Statiftical Account. It is within the botrnds 
of the parifli of Methven ; but, from its proximity to Augh- 
tergaven, the people refiding in it have, for a long time, been 
accuftomed to attend public worfliip at Aughtergaven church, 
and to receive church benefits from the minillers of that 
parifla. 

Ecclefiajlical 5/^2?^.— The church of Aughtergaven is fitu- 
ated upon the flope of a rifing ground, half ^n Englifh mile 
eaftvvard from the manfe, and adjoining to the public road 
from Pertk to Dunkeld. It is diftant from Perth 8 miles 
and an half, and 6 miles and an half from Dunkpld. Like 
many old churches, it is of the form of a crofs, and its length 
difproportioned to its breadth. At prefent, it is in very bad 
repair. 

The manfe was built In the year r745 and has fince been 
frequently repaired. 

The ftipend, lately augmented, is now, in money, 72 I» 
jps. 8 d. Sterling, 5 1. for communion elements, and 
victual 41 bolls 3 pecks, 2 pecks meal, and 10 bolls bear. 

The glebe confifts of 41 acres of ground. There is another 
glebe at Logiebride of much the fame extent. The King is 
patron. 

School. — The fchoolmafter's falary is 8 1. 6 s. 8 d. Sterling. 
His falary as feffion-clerk is 2 1. Sterling ; and he receives, of 
kirk-dues, about 2 1. Sterling yearly. The fchool- fees are, 
per quarter, I s. 6. d. for reading, 2 s. for writing and arith- 
metic, and for Latin, 2 s. 6 d. Sterling;

^tate of the PooKt and their Funds. —the poor are not nu- 
merous here, and are remarkably well provided for. '1 I\e 
funds for their fupport arife from colleaions in the church, 
money for mortdoths, dues on marriages and baptifms, the 
rent of two lofts in the church, and the rent of a few acres 
of land belonging to the poor. The whole amounts to about 
26 1. Sterling per annum. Out of this income, there is a dif- 
tribution made, of fupply to the poof, by the kirk-feffion, 
every month. There are generally 6 or 8 paupers upon the 
lift, who receive from 5 s. to 10 s. per month, according to 
their neceffities. At an annual meeting of the kirk-feffion, 
held in November, a few pounds are diftributed in fmall 
portions, for buying clothes, coals, or other neceffaries, to 
any poor people of the pariili who chufe to apply for tliis al-

The valued rent of the parilh is about 5,000 1. Scotch money. 
None of the heritors refide at prefent in the parifh. 

Improvements in Agriculture, es-^.-The progrefs of im- 
provements in agriculture, in the manufaaures, roads, and 
buildings here, has been fo rapid within thefe ten years paft, 
that the country has affumed quite a different afpea from 
what it had before that time. Though good crops of oats, 
barley, and flax, were long ago raifed upon particular fpots of 
ground, yet, till the year 1784, or 1785, there were not 
above three or four farms upon a regular plan, and very few 
neat farm {leadings in the parifh. The public road from 
Perth 'to Dunkeld pafTed through a large plantation of Scotch 
firs, and then along a track of bleak, wet, muir ground, which 
tended to imprefs travellers with a very unfavourable opinion 
of the adjacent country. 

At prefent, there are from ao to 30 regular farms, from 
So to 200 acres each i and, upon all of them, neat elegant 
houfes and offices covered with flate. The farmers find it 
their interefl to adopt, in the management of their ground, 
the method recommended by the proprietors, of fummer fal- 
lowing, and mixing, akernately, white and green crops. Till 
lately, a field of wheat was feldom to be feen here, now, fe- 
deral of the farmers fow from 10 to 20 bolls of wheat yearly, 
and have excellent crops. To encourage them in raifing 
this ufeful grain, the Duke of AthoU has ereacd a flour 
mill upon his eftate in this parifh.

A turni.ke road from Perth to Dunkeld is no;, complet- 
ed. In entering the parifh, it takes a diffcretu dire^ioa 
from the old roads, and is conduded through the cultivated 
ground. Moft of the new built houfes and farm fteads were 
defignedly fituated near it, or within view of it, which is not 
only extremely convenient for the farmers but alfo tends to 
decorate and enliven the appearance of the country. 

In the year 1 7 84, Mr Dempfter of Dunnichen, Mr Graham 
of Fintray, along with feveral gentlemen in the mercantile 
hne in Perth, feued fome ground at Stanley from the Duke 
of Atholl, built a mill for Ipinning cotton, and foon after be- 
gan to erecT: a village in its neighbourhood,upon a regular plan, 
for accommodating the people to be employed in this manu. 
faaory. At that time, only a few families dwelt near Stan- 
ley ; and, except the land within the inclofures around Stan- 
ley Houfe *, moft part of it, thereabout, was almoft in a ftate 
of nature. His Grace the Duke of Atholl took under his 
own management 250 acres of this land, inclofed it, built 
upon it an elegant farm ftead ; and, within the courfe of a 
few years, imt roved it fo highly, that not long ago, this farm 
was let at the rate of i 1. 5 s. per acre. 

Near an hundred families now refide In the village at 
Stanley. Above 350 perfons are employed about the cotton 
mill, — of this number 300 are women or children under 
1 6 years of age. The boys and girls, though confined at 
work in the mill for many hours of the day, and, at times, 
during the night, are, in general, very healthy. 

Mtfcellaneous 

* Stanley Houfe is beautifully fituated upon the banks of 
the river Tay, in the eallern part of this parKh. It was built 
by the late Lord Nairn. The family of Nairn had another 
elegant houfe near Loak, the ruins of which are yet to be feen. 
Their place of interment is in the fouth ille of Auglitergayeu 
(cliurch.

Miscellaneous Ob/ervaiiom.— There is ftiU ample room for 
farther improvements in this parifh. Large trafls of ground, 
where the foil is tolerably good, remain unimproved.' The 
roads leading acrofs the country, from the public roads, are 
exceffively bad, and, in winter, almoft impaffible. Ditches 
for draining the low wet lands, hedges, hedge-rows of trees, 
and clumps of planting, for affording (helter, are much want- 
ed. 

Many of the tenants, who have only fmall poffeffions, are 
yet poorly accommodated as to lodging. This is partiy their 
own fault for, they certainly might, with a good deal of 
trouble, but without much expencc, render their little habi- 
tations much more comfortable than they generally are. 
Numbers of them live together in fmall villages, in imoaky 
damp houfes, built of turf and ftone^and thatched with ftraw 
or heath. The difeafes moft prevalent among them arc 
rheumatifm, deafnefs, and epidemic fevers. 

There arc feveral moffes in the pariOi. From thefe the 
people are plentifully fupplied with fuel. Of late, moft of 
the farmers, inftead of peat and turf, ufe coals, which they 
bring from Perth, and fometlmes from the coal pits near 
Kinrofs. They find it more profitable to employ their fer- 
vants and horfes in fallowing and improving their land, than 
in digging and driving peats during the fummer. 

Lime was firft applied to the ground as a manure here 
about 30 years ago j but it was long' after that time before it 
came to be generally ufed by the tenants. 

Marl has been found in different places of the parilh. A 
confiderable quantity of it was lately dug out of a fmall 
meadow upon the Duke of AthoU's eftatCj, and fold at a very 
moderate price. One of Lord Mansfield's tenants, who, by 
his activity and induftry, has greatly forwarded fome of the 
Improvements here, extracted, at different times, fome hun- 
dred

drcd bolls of excellent marl from an extenfive meadow up. 
on his farm. ^ 

A ftratum of marl was alfo difcovered, not long ago, in a 
hollow piece of ground, upon Mr Stewart of Grandtully's 
eftate, but it is buried under a great depth of mofs. 

Mr Robertfon of Tullybelton had the merit of introducing 
into this parifli the new method of farming by fummer fal- 
lowing, by a regular rotation of white and green crops, and 
fowing grafs feeds. 

Except one or two Druidical circles of large ftones {land- 
ing on end, fimilar to thofe that are to be feen in many 
other parts of Scotland, there are no antiquities here worth 
p^entioning.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6887651">MOCHRUM</name>

(County and Presbytery of Wigton.-^ynod o?: 

Galloway.) 

By the Rev. John Steven.</head>

<p>

Name, Extent^ ^c, 

CONCERNING the derivation of the name of this pa- 
rifh, no certain information has~ been obtained. It is 
fituated in the county and prelbytery of Wigton, and fynod 
of Galloway. Its greateft length, from eaft to weft, being 
about lo miles, and its greateft breadth between 4 and 5 
miles. It is bounded on the fouth by the Bay of Luce, on 
the weft by the parifh of Old Luce, on the north by thofe 
of Kirkowan and Kirkinner, and the eaft by Glafferton. 

Surface, Soil, and Climate.— 'The general appearance of the 
furface cannot be denominated either level or mountainous ; 
it is partly both. The flats, however, are not extenfive, nor 
are the hills of great elevation ; but, being intermixed with 
each other, at moderate diftances, they exhibit a variety of 
profpe£t not unpleaQng to the traveller, nor unprofitable to 
the owner. From the eaftern boundary, along the Bay of 
Luce, for fcveral miles, the foil, with a few exceptions, is ex- 
cellent, being moftly of a fine light, and in fome places, ,a 
ftrong deep loam. Approaching towards the centre of the

parift.it becomes gradually more thin and flony, while a 
large extent, on the eaft and weft fides, moftly confifting of 
rocky eminences, or^nofTy fwampsand lakes, exhibits a bleak 
and barren profpoa, and is chiefly ufed for pafture. There 
are, however, fcattered up and down in this bleak region 
fome fmal! pieces of good dry arable land. Owing, perhaps' 
to the general drynefs of the foil, the opennefs of the coun- 
try, and its fine expofure to the fea air, the climate is re- 
markably healthful. Fevers, or other violent difeafes, are 
not frequent, and are feldom mortal. The fad ravage oc- 
cafioned by the fmall pox is now much abated, by tht pre- 
vailing praaice of innoculation. The prejudices entertained 
by vulgar minds againft this falutary expedient, though not 
totally extirpated, are gradually yielding to the advice and 
example of the better informed. 

I Many of the inhabitants attain to old age, in the enjoy- 
ment of good health and vigour. A woman died lately, who 
had completed her 105th year j and, excepting a little dul- 
nefs of hearing, retained the ufe of her fenfes and faculties 
unimpaired to the laft. 



Sea Coajl — A flat fmooth gravel beach, moftly about 50 
yards wide, runs along from the eaftern, till within a mile of 
the weftern extremity of the pari/h, where it is intercepted 
by a fteep rocky hill projedling into the fea, and forming a 
bold inacceflibic fliore. On this beach, the road which opens 
the communication between what are called the Makers and 
Reins of Galloway, which formerly was almoft impaffibic for 
carriages, has, of late, been compietely repaired, and carried 
along the brink of the forefaid hill, clufe by the fea, in a di- 
reaion now wonderfully level indeed j for, to effeauate this, 
fuch deep caves were to fill up, and fuch immenfc rocks to

remove, as, not many years ago, would have been thought- 
utterly impoffible. 

Parallel to the beach, the land, rifing fuddenly, forms a 
fteep bank or precipice, which renders the accefs from the 
fliore into the country, in many places, rather difficult. 
Though there are various little bays, or creeks, where fmall 
boats can iand, there is only one place called PortwiUiam 
that deferves the name of a harbour. 

This port, though but fmall, is commodious and fafe, be* 
ing well (heltered by the land on the eaft, north, and weft 
fides ; and if a ftrong wall or rampart, which has fome time 
fince been begun to defend the fouth, was completed, it 
would affijrd a fecure harbour to a number of veflels, of at 
leaft 200 tons burden. 

' Few things, it is believed, would be more advantageous to 
Mochrum, than the reparation of this port, becaufe, being 
the only one convenient for, or belonging to the parifli, at it 
all exports and imports muft be made. A little to the eaft- 
ward of this, indeed, there is a fmall natural bafon, called 
the Rue of Doury ; but here the accefs is difficult, the water 
fliallow, and the anchorage infecure, except in particular 
winds. At Portwilliam ftands a neat fmall village of the 
fame name, which was founded by Sir William Maxwell of 
Monrieth, about 20 years ago, in honour of whom it is 
named. It confifts moftly of one row of low houfes, well 
built, covered with flate, and fronting to the fea. 

The inhabitants of every defcription are about 210. In 
1788 a fmall barrack-houfe was ere£led here for the accom- 
modation of the military, and cuftom-houfe officers occa- 
fionally fent to prevent the landing of fmuggled goods. 
This meafure feems to have been attended with complete 
fuccefs, as neither box, anker, nor bale, though not unfre- 
quent before, are now to be feen. The Bay of Luce every

where, but efpeclally near PortwiUiam, abounds with variety 
o excellent fifh, as falcon, herring, ..-Wcrel, d ^ 
W.t.ng. and others. Very fe. of the two fi ft, b t j n 
^derable quantities of all the reft are fo.eti.es caught , and 
here is every reafon to believe, that if this fifling was pur- 
luedwuh moreinduftry and Ml, it would abundantly re- 
ward the undertaking. To this, however, it muft be allow- 
ed, that the general fcarcity and high price of fait, is a very 
great difcouragement. At prefent, the fifhermen never at- 
tempt (what their circumftances indeed cannot afFord) to cure, 
or fait the fifli, excepting a few for the ufe of their own fa- 
milies. The reft are fold as- they are caught, at a ftiilling the 
l^one. The price of fait is commonly i s. 6 d. a ftone, and 
often not to be had at all. In the courfe of every 4 or 5 
years, the kelp fhore here, as it is called, is let by Sir Williana 
Maxwell the proprietor of it, for about loa pounds j whea 
a proportionable quantity of that article Is manufaaured, car^ 
ried to the Englifh market, and ufually fold at 5 1. a ton. 

Population — ^There is, perhaps, no country parifh in the 
county that has increafed fo much in population as Mochrum 
for thefe laft 20 years. The inhabitants, who now amount 
to 1400, it is certain, did not exceed half the number 
previous to that period. This increafe has been almoft en- 
tirely effedled on Sir William Maxwell's eftate, who, carry- 
ing on extenfive plans of improvement upon the lands which 
he held in his own natural pofleffion, had occafion to em- 
ploy a number of additional labourers, and thefe happening 
to confift moflly of young, ftout, newly married Irifhmen, this 
prolific race foon contributed largely to the human ftock. 

Of the lands which he had occafion to let, the worthy pro- 
prietor, too, very judicioufly divided feveral large farms into 
a number of rmaU ones, and thereby put it in the power of 

many- 



iff Mochrum, 5^3 

tfiany induftrious perfons to become farmers, by obtaining 
poffeffions adapted to their circumftances. 

Nor can it be denied, that the illicit trade, for which this 
place was, till of late, fo noted, however reprehenfible in it- 
felf, and generally hurtful, has contributed confiderably, both 
to the increafe of population, and the improvement of agri- 
culture here. n 

The principal conduflors of thaf bufmefs being chiefly 
men who had been bred to farming, in fome of the bell 
cultivated part^ of Ayrlhirc, were not ill qualified to give 
ufeful leffons on that fubjeft to the natives of Mochrum. 
On their fettlement here, having great command of men, 
houfes, and money, the lands which they took in leafe they 
improved with a degree of rapidity, and of fuccefs, unknown 
before in this part of the country. 

To fee, in the courfe of two or three years, a number of 
excellent farm houfes and offices erefted, where only a few 
miferabic huts flood before, thefe fields, which refembled a 
heahhy common neatly inclofed, fubdivided, and covered 
with luxuriant crops of grown clover and rye-grafs, was a 
fight not only new and ftrange to the farmers of Mochrum, 
but alfo to thole of Galloway in general. Every perfon 
talked of, and admired the great and fudden improvements of 
the Clone Company ; for fo were the fmugglers denomi- 
nated. 

The good effects of fucli an example in the parifh were 
loon apparent. Raifed, by a fenfe of fhame, for paft igno- 
rance and negleft, and encouraged by the profpedt of future 
gain, almoft every farmer, who had either money, or length 
of If afe, began to do fomething towards meliorating his pof^ 
I'dffioh. 

Here, it may not be deemed impertinent to remark, that 
in this, as in moft other diftrii^s of Galloway, the great bars 



5^4 Slatijlical Account 

to further In^provement would feem to be, the fl.ort leaf., 
and large farms. 

Very few proprietors let their lands for more than 19 
years, and thefe frequently in quantities of from 500 to 1000, 
Scotch acres, without fence or culture. 

Wjth fuch a leafe, it is pretty evident, that a poor farmer, 
can. do little to purpofe, and that a rich one will not. The 
farmer, in vain, attempts to accompliflx, perhaps with a hun- 
dred pounds or two, what would require ^^s many thoufands, 
and the latter foon becomes tired of laying out his money, 
where both principal and intereft fliall fo foon be loft, and 
prudently contents himfelf with fuch flight and temporary 
meliorations as may beft correfpond to the Ihort time which 
he is to enjoy them. Were the lands, and particularly thofe 
that are unimproved, divided into 80 or 100 acres, more or 
lefs, according to the circumftances and fpirit of the farmer, 
and let for 25 or 30 years, there is reafon to believe, that a 
great and happy change would foon be wrought on the face of 
this country. 

Sir William Maxwell, indeed, as already obferved, has let 
a part of his large eftate in fmall pieces, and the Earl of 
Galloway, who is alfo a proprietor here, is, of late, in ufe of 
granting leafes for 21 years, and the tenant's lifetime. It 
would, therefore, only be neceflary to unite the plans of the 
knight, and the peer : Like two equal feftions of the fame 
fubjefl, they would form an efficient and harmonious 
whole. 

That leafes, during life, will be produdlive of better effiidts 
than any ordinary determined fpace of time, is highly pro- 
bable, when it is confidered how naturally, and how fond- 
ly, almoft every perfon indulges the hope of attaining to old 
age. 

The

The fimple undefigning peafant put thus in poffeffion fits 
„ot down to ftudy tables of calculation, on the P-bab.lmes 
of life, the fecurity or the danger that are fuppofed to attach 
to its fucceffive periods, but felicitates himfelf with h,s owa 
adage, which he underftands far better; that whde a « fet 
day foon comes," he Ihall remain unaflFeaed by any fuch 
events, and continue to enjoy, undifturbed, the fruits of his 
labours to the end of a long life. 

Manures and Tillage,— Tht arable and pafture lands of the 
pariai,it is prefumed, may be nearly of equal extent ; and 
there is not much natural meadow ground. The lands are 
let from lo s. to 30 s. an acre, and no balliework or fervices 
are demanded. For many years paft, confiderable quantities 
of fine clay.marl have been dug in Sir William Maxwell's 
lands, 50 fingle horfe cart-loads of which being laid on the 
acre, produced abundant crops of grain and grafs. This va- 
luable treafure appears now to be nearly exhaufted, or is be- 
come fo deep and difficult to work as to exceed the expence 
of lime. 

All the lime ufed here, which may be about 12,000 
Carlille bulhels annually, is imported burnt from Whithaven, 
at I s. 2 d. or i s. 3 d. a bufliel, of which 45, 50, 60, or 
more are put on the acre, according to the ability of the far- 
mer, or the quality of the foil. Shell fand is alfo brought 
hither, in fmall veffels, from the ferry town of Cree, at 2 s. 
6 d. a ton, and of thefe 20 are ufually given to an acre, but 
this is only ufed upon lands fituated near the fhore, its great 
weight rendering it too expenfive to be carried far into the 
country. After the land has received one or other of thefc 
manures, or rather the ftiraulants, it is commonly plowe4 
and fown with oats for 2 years fucceffively, at the rate of 7 
•r 8 Winghcfter bulhels to the acre, and 5 or 6 feeds are the 

ufual

Siaiijlical Account 

.fual increafe. The 3d year, every good farmer allows to 
each acre about 50 cart loads of dung, or fea-weed, fows oa 
« 4 or 5 bufhels of bear, with 2 of rye.grafs, and 12 or 14 
i'is. of red and white clover. 

The ordinary produce of bear, upon land fo treated, is from 
10 to 14 feeds. The 4th year concludes the procefs with a 
hay crop, the acre commonly yielding between 200 and 300 
Itones. The land is then turned into pafture, for 6 years at 
leaft ; and, when opened again, is generally dunged on the 
^rft plowmg, and the fame order of cropping obferved as be- 
*ore. Ihe oats, when properly cleaned, weigh about 38 lbs. 
and the bear 48 lbs. a bufliel. 

Of the former, Mochrum annually exports about 6,oco, 
and of the latter 1 0,800 bufliels.-The oats at i s. lod. and 
the bear at 2 s. 9 d. 

This grain is chiefly carried to the markets of Liverpool 
and Whithaven, and fometimes a little of it is taken to 
Greenock. Some two-rowed barley and wheat are railed ; 
but of thefe the quantities are fo fmall, as fcarcely to deferve 
notice. It is a common obfervation here, that Galloway is 
not a wheat country, which is certainly true ; but owing, 
perhaps, more to this than any other caufe, that it is very 
little attended to, or fown. 

The harveft ufually' begins .about the middle of Auguft, 
and is finiflied about the end of September. 

Fallowing the foil is too feldom pradlifed, and turnips are 
fo rare a fight, that no fooner do they make their appearance 
in a field, than the neighbouring boys fet upon them, like 
apples in an orchard, and eat or carry them away. 

Servants' wages. — The ordinary wages given to a man fer- 
vant are from 4 1. to 5 1. in the half year, the tertn for which 
£hey are all engaged, and to a woman fervant from 30 s. to 

2l.

2 1 for the fame period. Every confiderable farmer keeps 
alfo at leaft one cottar or yearly man with his family, to 
whom he gives a houfe and yard, meal and potatoes, or other 
emoluments, to the amount ofisLorad. Of this laft 
defcription, the greater part are Irilhmen, efcaped from therr 
country and their loom, and are commonly good hands with 
a fpade or flail, but not dexterous in the management of 
horfes at the cart, or the plough. 

The horfes, of which there are about 280 in the parifli, 
are moftly all of the draught kind, or are ufed for that pur- 
pofe, and are partly bred here, and partly imported frona 
Ireland. About 15 and 16 hands is their ufual height, and 
as many pounds their price. Unlefs in very ftiff, or uncuU 
tivated lands, feldom more than two are put to a plough, 
and never more than one to a cart. The ufe of tracers, as 
they are called, ftill fo prevalent in many parts of Galloway, 
is totally exploded in Mochrum, becaufe, it is believed, that 
two horfes, put each to a cart, will do at leaft one third more 
work, and with greater eafe, than when yoked together in 
one. It is worthy of notice, that 20 years ago, there was 
only one cart in the pariQi belonging to a tenant, whereas 
there are now 170 of that defcription. 

The Scotch plough, improved, or the chain one, arc 
chiefly ufed. The latter is preferred where the land is not 
flony, being eafier drawn. The ploughman always drives 
the horfes for himfelf, when not more than two, and fomc- 
times even three, when yoked abreaft. The farmers begin 
to plow in November, and finifti by the end of February, 
when the feeds are fown, which are commonly all in the 
ground in the courfe of five weeks after, if the fcafon has 
been favourable. 

The horfes are generally fed with ftraw, and two feeds of 
oats a-day, when they plow ; and with rye-grafs, and three 
feeds, when they harrow the ground. 

Black 



5^8 Statijlical Accotmt 

Black Cattlc.^Th^ black cattle are not large, but very 
handfome, as tliofe bred in Galloway in general are. The 
whole number in the parifli may be about ,500. Every 
farmer rears as many as he can, and no more thinks of fat. 
•ting and killing a calf, than would an ancient inhabitant of 
Egypt. 

The cattle are ufually fold, at two years of age. for 5 I. 

a-head, to graziers or jobbers, and are moftly all, fooner or 

later, driven to the Englifh markets. 
As the chief quality regarded in a cow is to be a good 

breeder, fo no great attention is paid to milk, or manufac 
luring of it into butter and cheefe ; yet of thefc articles 
enough are made for the ufe of the inhabitants. 
. Some of the farmers, however, from a laudable defire of 
improving in this refpedl, have more ihan once introduced 
here the famous cows of Kyle. But, whether it was owing 
to a difference of pafture, of hard feeding, or of both, thefe 
were foon found to milk no better than the native breed ; 
and, being lefs efteemed in other refpe^s, efpecially on ac- 
count of their being horned, very few of them are now to 
be feen. When the cows get old, they are fold lean for be. 
tween 3 1. and 4 I. except what are retained for the ufe of 
the parifhioners ; and thefe, when fatted, commonly weigh 
from 25 to 30 ftones. 

5/^^^/.— this parifh has long been famous for excellent 
wool, on account of its ftiU retaining fome of the ancient 
breed of the Galloway flieep. Of thefe fheep, the moll dif- 
tinguifhing marks are, orange coloured face and legs, lliort 
thick wool, and very fmall fize. When at full growth, and 
tolerably fat, the wedder would not exceed 30, nor the ewe 
27 lib. J and it would require 18 or 20 of their fleeces to 
make a ftone of 26^ lib. 

Very 



of Mochninu 



5^9 



Very few, however, of this truly primitive breed, it is fup- 
pofed, now remain ; they have been either picked out, and 
fold off in quantities to thofe who were purfulng improve- 
ments in wool, or contaminated with the various other kinds 
of fheep in the neighbourhood. 

But, though thus evidently degenerating, the Mochrum 
wool (quantity and quality) is ftiU efteemed the beft in the 
county, and is generally fold from I2s. to 14 s. a ftone, 
when it is carried to the manufaaories of Kilmarnock and 
Glafgow. 

A few years ago. Lord Daer and Admiral Stewart pur- 
chafed here fome of the native ewes, in order to try a breed 
between them and Spanifli, Shetland, and other rams ; but 
both thefe public fpirited noblemen were unfortunately cut 
off by death, while engaged in this and many other patriotic 
experiments for the improvement of their country. 

The number of Iheep is confiderably diminiflaed fince the 
late improvements here. The whole ftock, at prefent, is not 
more than 5000. Being very hurtful to young thorn hedges, 
they are, with great propriety, forbidden to be kept where- 
ever the fields are inclofed with thefe. As they are, there- 
fore, molUy banilhed to the moor-lands, they are neither 
large nor fat •, but, when brought from thence, and fed on 
good pafture for a year, they improve greatly, and are ac- 
counted the very beft of mutton. On their ordinary foil, 
the wedders are fold, when 4 years of age, at i o s. a head, 
and are moftly driven to Ayr or Glafgow \ and the ewes, as 
they become old, are killed for home confumption. 

Swim. — x^lmoft every farmer keeps 2 or 3 pigs, and every 
houfeholder one ; fo that there is an abundance, if not an

C«n.V,.-_Near by the church, which is fituatcd aboat 
mile right into the parifh from Portvvilliam, there is a pretty 
large earthen mound, quite entire, with a deep ditch or fo/Tc 
round it. 

On the eaftern extremity of the fea coaft, at the fummit 
of a ieep bank, there are very diftinft remains of an Anglo- 
Saxon camp. And, within two miles of the weftern extre- 
mity, alfo hard by the fhore, ftand the ruins of a fmall manfe 
and church, called St finian's Chapel, probably from the 
famous Saint of that name. 

In the middle of the moor-land appears an old tower or 
caftle, whofe walls are very ftrong, and almoft entire j and, 
being nearly furrounded by lakes, when viewed at a diftance 
it has a mort curious and pidurelque appearance, refembling 
much a large Ihip at fea. 

It is called the old Place of Mochrum; and formerly belong- 
ed, together with a confiderable eftate contiguous to it, to an 
ancient family, of the name of Dunbar^ who refided in it, 
were created Knights of Mochrum about a century ago, and 
ftill enjoy that title. But the caftle and the property have 
now, for upwards of 60 years, been in poffeffion of the Earl 
of Dumfries, 

Plantations. — On thefe lands the noble Earl has lately be- 
gun to plant, in convenient places, confiderable clu.-nps of 
trees, which being at a good diftance, and well fiieltcred 
from the lea, there is reafon to hope they may do well ; a 
circumftance much to be wifhed, as they would be both 
highly ornamental and ufeful in that part of the p.irifh. 

In Mochrum, or in no other part of Galloway, fituated 
near, and expofed to the weftern ocean, do trees of nny kind 
feem to thrive. Owing to this caufe alone, Sir William 
Maxwell's extenfive plantations, which have had every other 

advantage 



cf Mochriim, 



advantage that either art or nature could beftow, have made 
little progrefs, except in low lituations, and not in fight of 
the fea. Wherever old Neptune gets but a peep. at them, 
they foon begin to ficken and fade. 

The lakes above mentioned, and feveral others in the pa- 
rifli, are ftored with perch and trout, pike and eel, of which 
conlidcrable quantities are caught at the proper fbafons. 

There are no rivers, but plenty of burns and Imall rivu- 
lets, as alfo of excellent Iprings, in Mochrum, 

There are two corn mills, the one a very good, and the 
other a very bad one ; and, as the farmers are not, in gene- 
ral, thirled t© either, they are at no lofs which to preier. 

No manufadlures have yet found their way here; but Sir 
William Maxwell has been propofing to have one erefted on 
fome of his fine fituations. The prefent number of me- 
chanics, of every defcription, is about 20. 

Poor. The lift of the poor feldom exceeds S or 10, who 

are lupported by begging through the panlh, and by the 
Sundays collcdions at church, which aunuaiiy amouut to 
about 20 1. 

The parifli, however, is continually infcfted with foreign 
beggars, and specially the Iri(h, who come over here in 
great numbers, as they fay, to vifit their friends a duty 
to which, it uiuft be allowed, they are exceedingly attentive. 

There is only one refiding ledtary in :he panlh, who goes 
under the name of Antlburgher. 

ScBools, — A very neat fchool-houfe was erected at the 
church 3 years ago, where 76 or 80 fcholars uiually attend, 
and are taught reading Englifli, writing, arithmetic, book- 
keeping, mathematics, French, and Latin, by a very well 
«jiialified teacher, who has lately beqn procured. The quar- 
terly

terly wages are from as. to 4s. according to what the youth 
are learning. 

The prefent falary is very fmall ; but there is every hope 
that the good heritors, who have been fo extremely indul- 
gent to the parifliipners in other refpeas, will foon augment 
it to fomething that may be adequate to the fupport of Tq 
ufeful a member of this foclety. 

Gentlemens Zcats.—Oi thefe there are none worthy of no- 
tice excepting Sir William Maxwell'.s, which is a very elegant 
and commodious edifice, only finilhed about two years "ago. 
It is fituated on a gently rifing ground, near the eafterr, 
boundary of the pariOi, and a fliort mile from the fea. It 
h3s in front, at a fmall diftance, a beiiutifu! lake of clear 
water, furrounded by a belt of thriving young planting ; as 
alfo the old family caftle, rearing its head amidft a clump of 
lofty trees ; while the oppofite fide commands a mofl: exten- 
live and delightful view of the Bay of Luce, the Mull of 
Galloway, the Rock of Bigfcar, the Ifle of Man, and even 
the mountains of Cumberland and ijMorn, when the weather 
is clear. 

Rental and Proprietors.— The grofs rental of the parifli is 
about 5000 1. 

Sir William Maxwell is by far the largeft proprietor, his 
eftate being nearly about one-third of the extent, and two- 
thirds of the value, of the whole furface. 

Next to him follow the Earls of Dumfries, Galloway, and 
Selkirk, and a few private gentlemen. 

Church — The manfe and offices are verv good, being al?. 
of late fubflantijlly rebuilt, and covered with flate ; and an 
excellent new church was completed about 4 months ago.

UNITED PARISHES OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7996117">WHITFKIRK
AND TYNNlNGil AME»</name> 

(County OF East Lothun.-Presbyterv of Dun- 
bar.— Synod OF LOTHXAN AND rWEEDALE.) 

By Mr James Williamson, junior of WhtekirK</head>

Situation^ Extent^ ^i, ^ Soil, ^c. 

THESE parifhes (which were united anno 1761) extend 
nearly 6 miles from fouth to north, and 4 from eaft 
to weft. They are bounded by the parjfh of Dunbar on the 
fouth-eaft, by Prefton on the fouth and fouth-weft, by North 
Berwick on the weft and north-weft, and on the north and 
eaft by the Frith of Forth. The general appearance of the 
parifli is flat. Behind the village of Whitekirk there is a ' 
hill, rather remarkable for the beautiful profpedl it affords of 
the Frith of Forth, and country adjacent, than for its height. 
The climate is dry, pleafant, and healthful. The inhabitants 
ars much lefs fubjeft to agues now than formerly. The foil 
varies in different parts of the parifh ; in general, it confifts 
of rich gravelly loams, highly favourable to the moft im- 
proved mode of agriculture. 

River.— -The river Tyne runs for about two miles through 
the fouthern part of the parifli : It rifcs in the moor of Mid- 
dleton } and, after a north- eaft courfe of nearly 30 miles, it 

difcharges 



ef WhitekirJi and TynnlngJjamel 573 

difcharges itfelf into the Frith of Forth In the eaft part of 
this parifti. The fi(h found in the Tyne are trout and gilfes, 
neither of which are remarkably plenty. A few falmon ar© 
fometimes found, but they are very rare. The right of fil- 
ing the Tyne up to the Knowmill, and the fea coaft at its 
mouth, from within a cable's length of Wellbarns burn to 
the water of Peffer, an extent of nearly two miles, belongs 
folely to the Earl of Haddington. A great number of feals 
are always to be feen fwimming about the mouth of the river, 
which are thought with probability to be one caufe of the 
fcarcity of other fifh. The tide flows about two miles up 
the water, and might be made navigable to that height at no 
great expence. 

Agriculture, Wages, ^^r.— This parlfti, in general, Is in 
the higheft ftate ot cultivation. The turnip hulbandry is 
now carried on to a great extent. About loo fcore of fheep 
are annually fed on turnip, and all fed in flakes upon the 
ground. The fbeep generally fed are Highland wedders, 
which are bought in O£lober for about 12 s. or 15 s. and 
fold again, from February to May, at from 20 s. to 25 s, per 
head, and will the-n weigh from 12 to 16 pounds a quarter. 
The number of fheep fed on grafs, during the fummer, will 
be about 50 fcore. There is alfo a confiderable number of 
black cattle fed annually both on turnip and grafs. Few 
fheep or oxen are reared in the parifh, but the mofl: of the 
farmers breed their own cows and horfes. The kinds of 
grain commonly raifed are, wheat, barley, oats, beans, and 
peafe. There is alfo a great quantity of turnip and fown 
grafs raifed annually, and potatoes fufficient to fupply the 
parifh. Each farmer raifes a few acres of flax for his own 
family and fervants. The ufual and moft approved rotation 
on thofe lands which are adapted for turnip-hufbandry, is.

derably above 5000, of which about 3000 are in tillage. 
There are 16 farms, which vary in fize, from about roo to 
380 acres. The rent of farms is much increafed within 
thefe few years, fome of them having tripled their former 
rent. The lands are generally inclofed ; and the farmers 
are perfeftly convinced of the very great advantage of inclo- 
fures. The price of labour has alfo been increafing for thefe 
fome years path A ploughman's wages are from 7I. to 
81. 10 s. a year, a day-labourer's from 14 d. to 15 d. per day. 
Shearers wages may be about is. a day, but they are alfo in- 
creafing. Women f^rvants wages are from 3 1. to 3 I. los. 
yearly. 

• Woods — When Thomas, Sixth Earl of Haddington, came 
to refide at Tynninghame, anno 1700, there were not above 
14 acres of planting upon the eftate, it being fuppofed that 
no trees could grow becaufe of the fea air and north- 
eaft winds. This Earl, at firft, either believed the com- 
mon opinion, or had no turn for planting ; but his Lady, 
being an aftive woman, began ; and, when her fuccefs was 
obferved, the Earl entered keenly into her plans. In 1707, 
the inclofiog and planting of the moor of Tynninghame were 
begun, to which they at that time gave the name of Bimihig 
Wood. Prior to that period, it was common to fome of his 
Lordfhip's tenants and a neighbouring gentleman, excepting 
a fmall part of it, for which one of the tenants paid a trifling 
rent. After the planting of Binning Wood, his Lord/hip 

inclofed 



of Whitekirk and tynninghame, ^77 

inclofed and divided his fields with ftripes of planting of 40. 
50, and 60 feet broad. The Eart Links, which are fituated 
clof&amp;upon the fea-beach, were at that time a dead and barren 
fand, with fcarcely any grafs upon them, and of nO uie but 
as a rabbit-warren. A gentleman from Haiiiburgh, happen- | 
ing to' be at Tynninghame, mentioned to Lady Haddingron 
that he had often feen trees growing on fuch a foil 3 this hint 
was taken, and the lin'ks planted j at that time, all who faw 
them thought the expence of trees and labour thrown away ; 
but, contrary to their expectations, they throve as well as on 
the beft grounds. The trees planted in the links are the 
Scotch fir 5 in Binning wood there is a great variety, viz. oak, 
afti, beech, elm, plain, fir, willows, and feveral others • the 
thinnings of vvhich have, for many years pafl, yielded a con- 
fiderable income, often above 500 1. a- year ; and, befides the 
advantage that is derived from the (helter which the plan- 
tations afixjrd, the grafs in the woods is much more valuable 
than it would have been, if allowed to remain in its original 
ftate. Binning wood confifts of about 300 acres ; the plan- 
tations upon the eftate have, at different times, been extend- 
ed, and there are now above 800 acres of ground planted at 
Tynninghame. In the united parifhes, altogether, there will 
be above a thcufand. 

Population.^ — As the fchoolmafter's houfe was unfortunately 
burnt in the 1760, the leffion rcgifters of the parifh of White- 
kirk were deftroyed at the fame time, which renders it im- 
pofiible to give any account of the births arid marriages in 
this parifn prior to that period. In the parilh of Tynning- 
hame, Which at that time was not united to WhitekVk, the 
average of births for 10 years following 1700 was ^3^,, and 
of marriages 6, the average for lo years foliovving ^750 was 
of births 17.'., of niarriagfs 3.

In the aceonnt in 1792, which, from the indifpofition of 
the minifter, is the lateft account that has been taken of the 
parifh, the number of families was 231, of fouls 994, of 
males 475, of females 519, all of whom are members of 
the national church, excepting 13 families which arc Sece- 
ders.

contained 3 villages, of which the leaft veftige is not now to 
be feen. In one of them were numbers of fifliers, and 
houfes for the curing of herrings. At prefent the number 
of fiOiing boats in the panfli is reduced to one. 

There are no manufaaures or trades people, but fuch as 
are neceffary for carrying on the bufinefs of agricuhure. 
There are two ale-iioufes, and three others licenfed to retail 
Britifti fpirits. There are 2 eftablilhed fchools in the pariOi, 
the one at Whitekirk, the other at Tynninghame. 

Poor— By the Sefiion Book of Tynninghame, it appears 
that a fcheme was propofed in 1745 by the Juftices of the 
Peace, and Minifters of this county, for ereding a general 
work'houfc for the maintenance of the poor of the county. 
The feffion did not accede to the propofal, as this parifli is 
furnifhed with poor-houfes of its own fufficient to lodge, and 
funds to maintain its own poor. The number ot poor m 
the parilh is not great ; they arc maintained by the weekly 
coUe£lions, and the intercft of 5 1 1 1. 10 s. 2| d. mortified to 
the fefiion. There is alfo 70 1. more mortified to them, buc 
the intereft is ftill paid to the fifter of the mortgager. 

Mifcellatieotis Obfefvations . — The extent of the Tea cofl; is 
about three miles. In the north part of the parlfli there is 
a number of rocks, which have been very taial to mariners 
at different times. Whhin thcfe two years feveral veflcls 
have been wrecked there ; and, to the honour of fome of 
the farmers in the neighbourhood, every exertion was made 
to fave the unhappy fufferers and their cffcdls, though, it 
muft be confeffed, the humanity of fome of the lower clafs 
ot people was not fo very confpicuous on fuch awful occa- 
fions.

On the top of Whiteklrk hill there is a cairn, which i. 
la.d to be the burial-place of two young men, who were killed 
by a derachment from the garrifon of the Bafs at the time of 
the Reformation. The people, with a very few exceptions, 
are fobpr, honeft, and induftrious j their drefs and mode of 
living are much altered within thefe 20 years. The roads 
are tolerably good, and much improved of late. For feveral 
years preceding 1794, with a view to leffen the number of 
crows, which in this parifh and neighbourhood deftroy a 
vaft quantity pf grain, the farmers afftiled themfelves in fo 
much a plough, and appointed a perfon to pay, from the 
common ftock, a penny for each old crow's head, and a half- 
penny for a young one : The effedls of this fcheme are now 
very perceptible, as the number of crows is now greatly re- 
duccd. • '

Extent and Boundaries. 
HE parifh of Glaflerton lies in the prefbytery and fhire 
^ ot Wigton, and in the fynod of Galloway. At its 
ea'ftandncrth-eaft confines, this parifh is bounded by the 
parifhes of Whithorn, Sorbie, and Kirkinner; on the weft 
and north-weft by the bay of Luce, and the parilh of Moch- 
rum on the fouth and fouth-eatt by the fame bay, ana the 
parifh of Whithorn. It meafures, in length, from its fouthern 
to its northern extremity, about feven miles and five fur- 
longs; at its greatefl breadth two miles and feven furlongs j 
where it is narrowefl, not more than a mile and a half. 

Surface and JfpeSt.—ln its natural afpeft the furface of the 
ground is rugged, unequal, and hilly, lowards the north, 
' it rifcs to an elevation fomewhat higher than the level of its 
fou:hern parts. The hills are rocky, and, for the mofV part, 

covered 



5"^^ Statijical Account 

covered with heath The lower traces lying among them are 
niarfhy. 1 he io.l is ufually loam, gravel, peat-earth, or clay. 
Granite and fchiftus compofe, for the .moft part, the ftrata 
of the rocks. Yet, beds of that mixture of carbonated lime 
and clay, which is known by the name of marl, have been 
h-erc and there difcovered ; and the marl has been dug for 
manure, till the pirs are now nearly exhaufted. The fea 
beach exhibits no fuch diverfity of the exuviae of marine 
'animals, as might prove very interefting to the lover of con- 
Chology. The ordinary indigenous graffes form the com- 
mon fward of the pafture-grounds. At the fea-fliore, the 
rocks rife over the waters, with a bpld, abrupt, beetling termi- 
nation of the land. Little native unplanted wood is to be feen 
within the parilh. Furze and wild fhrubs are more plenti- 
ful. The general courle and temperature of the weather are 
variable, but mild. The genial influence of fpring is cbm- 
■ monly felt here, as around all thefe wellern coafts, lomewhat 
earlier in the year than in the interior parts, or on the eaft. 
ern fide of the" kingdom. Frolb are rarely intenfe or long 
continued : Snow leldom accumulates to a great depth, or 
lies long upon the ground, borne fmall llreams, and many 
fprings, ferve to water the parifli j but it is neither bounded 
nor interfeded by any great river. Upon the rock within 
the fea-mark, at a place called IVlonreith, there grows a con- 
iiderable abundance of thofe manure plants, which are fre- 
quently burnt for the fake of the kelp or alkali of their aflies j 
but little of that fpecies which are employed in agriculture, 
as a rich manure, is to be feen on this part of the coaft. 

Wild Jmma/s.—The fox, the weafel, the otter, the hare, 
the moufe, the mole, are almoft the only fpecies of wild four 
footed animals now remaining in this parifli. The adder is 
the only formidable reptile. The wild fowls are numerous,

being of the fea partly, partly of the land. A great dlvcrfity 
pf lea filhes are found on the coaft. Trouts aad other cona- 
mon.fmaIl fifties aie taken in the ftreams of frelh water. 

Inhabitants.-Tht number of the inhabitants of the pariih 
of Gbfferton was in the year ifSh Sop. may be. at pre. 
fent, about 900 fouls. Of thefe 151 are refadent oa the 
eftate of Cattle Stewart. 

Heritors:— ^xT William Maxwell of Monrelth, the heirs 
of the late Admiral Keith Stewart, the Earl of Galloway, 

Robert Hawthorn Stewart, Efq; of PhyfgiU, and 

Stewart, Efq; of Caftle Stewart, are the principal heritors. 
Mr Hawthorn Stewart of PhyrgiU is the chief refident heri- 



tor. 



Partners. —Tht greater part of the inhabitants are ufually 
employed in the labours of , hufbandry,.as farmers, houle- 
fervants, cottagers hired by the year, or day-labourers. 

The farmers hold their poffeffions, for the moft part, by 
leafes, varying in duration commonly from the term of three 
to 19, or 21 years. For the green low arable lands of the 
parilh, the yearly rent varies, at an average, from 8 s. to i U 
ICS. an acre. The heath covered moors affording, at ara 
average, not more than from 2 s. 6 d. to 7 s. an acre of year- 
ly rent. The farnis differ in extent, and in the fum of the 
annual rent to the landlord, fome yielding not more than 
10 1. or 30 1. while others pay between 200 1. and 300 I, 
a- year. 

Black Cattle. — Tn the fural oecopomy of the farmers ia 
the parifh of GLiffcrton, the fi^ft objefl: is, the breeding and 
feeding of black cattle. Thefe are- commonly of the weH 
known Galloway race, not without fome occafional inter- 
mixture 



•^^"^ StaiiJIical Account 

mixture of the Irifh and Englill. breeds. But the pure Gal- 
lo^ay race is preferred to all others. The calves are all 
reared. For the firft eight months of'its life, the calf is 
uruallyleft to fuck its mother's milk. After attaining the 
lull age of one year, it obtains the name of a ftirk, and is fold 
to the cattle dealers at the average price of 2 1, 1 6 s. or 3 1 
At the age of three years, the bullocks and heifers of this 
panfh, are fold often at the rate of 7 I. or 8 1. a-head The 
common price for well grown and well fed oxen, at the age 
of four years, is from 9 K to i , 1. each. Old cows, wheh it 
« no longer eligible to keep them for producing calves and 
giving milk, are fold at the price of 8 1. or 10 1. each, to be 
fattened for the butcher. The green or heathy pafture of 
the fields ; cut grafs while it is ftill green and unwithered ; 
potatoes and turnips, ftraw and hay, are thejeveral forts of 
food with which thefe cattle are nourhhed. They are here 
and there wintered in fheds, and cow-houfes, as well to pre- 
ferve them from fuffering by the inclemency of the feafon, 
as that the refufe of their forage and litter, mixed with their 
dung, may accumulate for manure to the ground under til- 
lage. As much of the milk is confumed by the calves, the 
quantity of the butter and cheefe annually made is fmaller in 
proportion to the number of the milk-cows, than in the 
parifhes of Ayrfliire. 

Agriculture — Tillage for the produaion of grains and 
bulbous rooted vegetables, is, in its importance, the fecond ob- 
jea of attention, and fource ot profit, to the farmers of this 
parifh. Lime imported from Whitehaven ; marl dug from 
thofe pits which are now nearly exhaufted ; dung ; and com- 
ports of dung, earth, and lime, are the manures employed to 
fertilize the foil. From one fifth to one third part of the 
arable ground of every farm is annually plowed ; the re- 
maining 



of Giqferion. 58^ 



maining four- fifths, or two thirds, prefcrved for grafs. The 
tillage of every year is ufually commenced in Oftober and 
November. The ihain- plough has been tried ; but the com- 
mon old ScottiQi plough is generally preferred to every other 
model, as being the bcft adapted to the nature of the country. 
The plough is ufually drawn by two horfes, and the plough- 
men are, to a reafonable degree, alert and Ikilful. Oats and 
bear, or barley, are the grains chiefly cultivated. Seed-time 
is from about the beginning of March to the beginning of 
May. Potatoes have long been Ikilfully and fuccefsfuUy cul- 
tivated here. The culture of turnips, being recommended 
by the example and fuccefs of fome of the principal land- 
holders, begins to enter every year more and more into the 
ordinary agriculture of this parifh. Corn, for feed, has been 
occafionally imported hither, from the moft diftant parts of 
Scotland, and even England ; and it has been found highly ad-

ftill bringing the new feed corn from a foil as oppofite as pof^

The feafon for cutting down and gathering in the corn, is

Tartarian oats having been tried here, has been known to

Jiier. The corn cut down in harveft, is put up to dry for

the barn, in (hocks only. Large quantities of both potatoes 
and grain are annually exported. Sometimes the conrfe of 
crops, above defcribed, is fo far deviated from, that, after the 
third crop of grain, the field is manured with dung, and 
planted with potatoes or turnips ; after which it is, on the 
fifth year, fown with barley and grafs feeds. After the reap- 
ing of the barley, the field is left to enjoy the ufiial period of 
ceflation jfrom tillage. 

Sheep. — Sheep are the third in importance of the articles, 
of the ftock and produce of t'he farms in this parifh. The 
fmall white-faced race of the parifii of Mochrum ; the well 
known, fmall, black-faced breed of Galloway ; the variety 
produced by the ficilful management of the celebrated CuUey  
the Spanifh and the Shetland races of fheep, are all known 
and fed here. A mixture of the black- faced Galloway, with 
the CuTley breed, has been aUb tried. But the common 
Galloway race is the moft prevalent. Neither the Spanifli 
nor the Shetland fheep has, as yet, been found to thrive here, 
in ftach a manner as might encourage the common farmer to 
receive them into his flocks. The pradlice of finearing the 
flieep, annually, at the beginning of winter, with butter and 
tar, has begun to fall into difufe ; becaufe the ordinary tempe- 
rature of winter on thefe coafts, is extremely mild ; and the 
quality of the wool of fheep unfmeared is, for the moft parr, 
confiderably better, than the quality of that which is clotted 
with 'tar. The fineft wool is fold to the merchants at the 
price of 16 s. a ftone. Thofe lambs which can be annually 
fparcd for fale, are fold at the average rate of about 6 1. Ster- 
ling a fcore. Sheep of the age of 3 or 4 four years, arc 
bought from this pariflv, for the market, at the rate of 10 I. 
or 12 1. a fcore. In fome inftances, fheep of that age, have 
been fold here, at above a guinea a head.

S^/,;,._Svvine are fed in confiderable numbers, by the 
farmers and cottagers in this parilh. They are nounihed 
chiefly upon the refufe of potatoes, upon whey, and other 
fraall articles, which, but for them, might probably go to 
wafte. The pork is a flrong wholefomc food, and a lealon- 
able fupply to the labourers, in thofe times of the year m 
which it is lefs ufual to furnilh them with frefh beef and 
mutton. They may be dnven alive, even to a confiderably 
diftant place of fale : Or, they may be fattened and flaugtitcr- 
ed at home ; and the pork then pickled in barrels, or cured, 
as bacon, for exportation. 

Horfes The horfes of this parifh, are a flout, handfome 

race, very fit for the (addle, the load, or the draught. The 
breed has been diligently improved by the care of the gentle- 
^,en, landholders in Glafferton, and the neighbourhood. 
Moft of the young horfes are the progeny of ftallions intro- 
duced into this country by the Earl of Galloway, and the late 
Admiral Keith Stewart. It is probable, that the variety of 
the horfe now prevalent in thele parts of Galloway, has beea 
gradually produced by the continual crofling of the imall old 
Galloway breed, with foreign ftallions. 

Inclofures, l^c.—Thtk are all the capital articles of farm- 
ftock in this parifh. Poultry, and the ufual domdtic ani- 
mals, are kept about every farm-houfe and cottage. All the 
inftruments of agriculture are of a conltrudtion lufficiently 
fliilful and convenient. Inclofures, and the divilions of farms 
and fields, are formed commonly by the Galloway flone- 
dyke j which is Ibmetimes a double wall without mortar, 
and is often raifed to the height of 6 or 7 quarters of an ell.

fucccfsful here, on account of the vicinity of the fea, the rc- 
luftance of the foil, or other caufes. The roads are good, 
and perhaps fufficiently numerous and well dircdted : They 
are made, and from time to time repaired, at the expencc of 
15 s. Sterling, levied in converfion for the ftatute- labour, 
upon every hundred pounds Scottifh, of the valued rents. 
Peats, from the niorafles, arc the common fuel : Pit-coal is 
obtained, for the fame purpofe, from England, at the price 
C)f 1 5 s. a ton ; and it has lately begun to be ufed here in lar- 
ger quantities than formerly. The tarm-houfes, and the of- 
fice houfes refpeaively pertaining to them, are, for the moft 
part, commodious and fubftantial : The office-houfes ftand 
ufuaily at fome fmall convenient diUance from the farm- 
houfe. 



Markefs.—-tn comparifon with many parts of the country, 
the parifh of GlafTerton cannot be faid to be very difadvan- 
tageoufly fituate in refpe^t to markets for the exports which 
3t produces, and the imports needed for the ufe of its inhabi- 
tants. Whithern ; the iflc of Whithern ; and Port-William j 
the two laft fea-ports, are the neareft places worthy of being 
mentioned as feats of merchants, fhop-keepers, and artifans. 
But the exportation is chiefly to England, or to the fliires of 
Ayr, Renfrew, and JLanerk, in Scotland. The black cattle 
are exported, annually, by land, to the great markets and 
tryfts in the northern counties of England. February, May, 
and September, are the months in which black cattle are, 
every year, fent to the markets. The expence of lending a 
bullock, from this neighbourhood to St Faith's fair, may be- 
reafonably efliniated at ids. or 17 s. By the fatigue and 
hunger of the journey, the animal fuffers a lofs offlefh equi- 
valent to 17 s. more. The fheep, of whatever age, are e^- 
portcd by fea, to Whitehaven or Liverpool. For both flieep 

and 



of Glaferton, S% 

and black cattle, however, the eftablifhment, and e3cf«!»fion of 
manufaflures has begun to afford a partial market in the 3 
counties of Ayr, Renfrew, and Lanerk, which is little icfs 
convenient than the markets of England. The wool was 
formerly fold wholly into Ayrfliire, for the manufaaurcs of 
coarfe woollen liufB, which have been long carried on there. 
But the Englifli wool-merchants have lately lound their way 
hither. The furplus grain, whether barley, bear, or oats, is 
exported to Liverpool and Whitehaven : The quantity and 
value of the barley and bear exported, are grearer than taole 
of the corn. Lime and coals are, among other articles, im- 
ported from Whitehaven, ia return for the exports carried 
hither. 

Example of the Landholders.— YartKmntdy^ for the improve- 
ment of the agriciilture, and of the rural oeconomy in gene- 
ral, of the parilh of Glaflcrion, the principal refident b:ad- 
holders have paid extraordinary and highly fuccefsful atten- 
tion to this objeft, 

Robert Hanvthorn Stewart, Efq-, of Phyfgill, in the gene- 
ral management of his cftates, and particularly in^.the culti- 
vation of thofe fields which he retains in his own natural 
pofleffion i has eminently dilplayed that adive and vigorous, 
yet temperate and rational fpirit of improvement, which 
ever contributes the moft effectually to increafe the fertility 
of a country, and to excite and enlighten the rural induftry 
of its inhabitants ; becaufe it is equally remote from the folly 
of the agricultural projcdlor, who thinks no praftice in huHt 
bandry good, that was ever tried before \ and from the blin^ 
prejudices of the ruftic, who believes every thing to be abfurd, 
that has not been recommended by ancient cuftom in the 
place. Mr Stewart has fubdivided, and inclofed his fields 
yith excellent dry-ftone walls i has adopted the bell rotation

cf crOp« known in the country for that ground which ha 
fubjefts to tillage ; has imported grain for a change of feed, 
and flicep to ameliorate the breed of his flocks, from the 
inoft diftant parts of England. He has very fuccefsfuUy 
employed lime, fpread as a manure upon the unbroken lur- 
face, to improve the natural paflure of ground which it was 
not then eligible to plow. In the culture of turnips, a fpe- 
ties of green crop ftill too rare in this country, he has fet a 
very Ikilful and fortunate example. The ufe of potatoes, as 
a very beneficial fallowing crop, has been equally encouraged 
by his care and fuccefs. Having turned his attention parti- 
cularly to the grazier-farming, of feeding and fattening bhck- 
cattle for the market ; he has conduced this branch of huf- 
bandry with a degree of activity and Ikill highly advantage- 
ous to himfelf, and ufeful in the country. — It would be illi- 
beral and uncandid to omit mentioning here, that, from mo- 
tives of true public fpirit, Mr Stewart hasfhewn himielf par- 
ticularly friendly to thefe ftatiftical inquiries, to the relearchj 
es of the Board of Agriculture, and to whatever colledion 
or diffufion of ufeful information, tends to enlighten-and im- 
prove rural induftry and oeconomy. 

■ The houfe of Phyfgtll is fpacious and beautifully fituate. 
The circumjacent fields fpread out around it with a very fine 
effcdt. The vicinity of the fea-ihore is exceedingly interef- 
ting. The plantations, within thefe grounds^ are not exten- 
five, but not ftunted or dwarfiili. Mr Stewart has formed an 
excellent garden, which he has furroundsd with an uncom- 
monly good ftone and lime wall, full 14 feet in height. It 
affords great abundance of fruits, flower?., and pot-herbs, 
Tsoth ordinary and rare, and of the bed quality. 
' The late Admiral Keith Steivart of Glajferton had, for 
many years, applied himfelf, with great earneftnels, to 
l^eautify and improve, his eftate in this pari/h. He buiJt on 

it 



of Glajferton. ' 

It a (lately manfion-houre, formed an excellent garden and 
fcattered plantations over his grounds in that arrangement 
in which they feemed lilcely to thrive the beft, to afford te 
moft ufeful (helter, and the moft to gratify the eye of tafte. 
In his own natural poffeffxon, he referred nearly two thoU 
fand acres of land, almoft the whole eftate of Glafferton (pro- 
perly fo called). For managing the hufbandry of this traft 
of ground, he hired his upper farm fervants, from thole 
counties in England, of which the agriculture is efteemed to 
be the moft Ikilful. He formed, at the fame time, a fquarS 
of farm office-houfes, poffeffing every requifite accommoda- 
tion for every fort of animal-ftock, and for all the other ules 
of rural oeconomy. With equal attention, he provided all 
the beft inftruments of improved agriculture, and breeds of 
the beft races of the different forts of animals to be fed upon 
his lands. In the fyftem of farming which he thus adopted, 
four hundred black cattle, forty fcore of fheep, and a pro- 
portionate number of horfes, formed his animal ftock. Odt 
of tile 2COO acres, about two hundred might be annually plow- 
ed to bear crops and of thefe^fixty were ufually planted with 
turnips : Three hundred acres, nearly, were occupied by gar- 
dens, houfes, and woods : Two hundred acres more were rt- 
ferved as meadow ; one half bearing fown graffes ; the other 
half being bog, and affording only the unimproved natural 
fward. A number of day-labourers, varying from 50 to 76, 
were conftantly employed in the farm-work on thefe grounds. 
The ufe of oxen, for drawing the cart and plough, was zealouf- 
ly adopted. For this purpofe, the llouteft and largeft boned 
oxen were ufually felcdted, out of thofe droves of Irilh cattlt, 
which were continually imported, through this country, to- 
wards England. At the age of 4 years, tiiefe were yoked -Jii 
the draught : They were wrought, in this labour, for the next 
4 years: On the 9th year, they were freed from the yoke, 

and

and fattened for the butcher. While at work, thefe bullocks 
w.re plentifully fed with hay, ftraw. or occafionally potatoes 
w-tu the addition of a fmall weekly allowance of corn. The 
oxrtn thus fed and applied to labour, were found to have 
ne-rly the fame ftrength of draught as horfes ; but their 
P3ce, under rbc yoke, was fo much flower than the ordinary 
pace of the horfe, that three ploughs drawn by oxen, did not 
conur.only perform more labour than two ploughs drawn by 
horfe? would, u ithin the fame fpace of time, perform. The 
working bullock was, however, nouriOied at one half of the 
expence of the fuftenai^ce to the working horfe, and was 
much lefs liable to difcafe. For ploughing ftony unequal 
ground, the ox is lefs fit than the horfe; becaufe, when the 
plough chances to ftnke upon any obftacle, fuch as a rock 
or root, in the furrow, the ox is too indocile and refraftory, 
to ftep back with the fame readinefs as the horfe, and fuffer 
the ploughman to turn his inftrument afide from the obftacle 
which it cannot remove. AH the agricultural improvements 
af the lat^ Admiral Stewart were profecuted on a large.fcale, 
and at a great expence. So many of them were, of neceffiry, 
merely experimental, that they cannot be fuppofed to have 
every one already repaid the expence at which they were 
made, with a reafonable furplus of profit. But they muft, in 
the whole, have fo augmented the fertility of the foil, and fo 
5ncreafcd its value by the addition of fuch a capital funk up- 
on it, that the lands cannot, in the end, fail to yield an ea- 
:iarged produce and rental, more than fuiBcicnt to compen- 
fate, fully, all the care and expence at which they have been 
improved. This highly cultivated condition of the eftate of 
Glafferton, is undeniably a fine monument of the tafte, judg- 
ment, and ardent public fpirit of its late proprietor.

Mr Stewart of CaJ^/e. Stewart does not, indeed, refide upon 
his eftatc in this parilh ; bur it is, in his abfence, under the

quainted with the beft hufbjndry of England, and ©f this 
country; and nioft laudably 2calous to improve the agricul- 
ture of the county, and the value of the eftatfes under hig

ful pr:\£lice; and may beft promote the adoption of 
that mbrlfrn, improved, rural oeconomy which promife^ 
the higheft advantages at dnce to tHe tenant, and to hig

Price of Labour.— The price of labour would probably be 
much higher than it is, at prefent, in this paKifti, and 
throughout the county, were it not for the near vicinity of 
Ireland, and the continual emigration of great numbers of 
Irilli labourers. A ftout, alert, and Ikilful ploughman re- 
ceives, together with his bbard in his maftcr's houfe, 4 1. 
fterling of wages, in the half year. A good maid-fervant's 
wages are ufually from thirty to forty {hillings in the half' 
year, befide her board. Few or no artifans refide within 
this parifh, except fuch as are employed folely in the cufto- 
mer-work of their felloW-pariftiioners, and other near neigh- 
bours. Their wages are in a due proportion to thbfe of the 
hinds engaged in farm- labour. 

Church, ^c. — The church ftands near to Giaflerton- Houfe, 
and is romantically embofomed in wood, which fheds around 
it a venerable gloom, as if it were a druidical temple, or the 
facred grove of fome Syrian idol. It was built in the year 
1752. The wood was at a much later period planted around

the church yard, by the late Admiral Stewart, to hide the 
church, that it might not deform theafpedl of his ornamertt- 
d grounds. The manfe was built 1 8 or 20 years fince. The 
prefent refpeaable clergyman of this pariQi is the Rev. Dr 
Laing. 

Anitquit'ies and HiJ(yry.-^0( the ancient biftory of the pa- 
rlfh of Glaflerton, there has not been much recorded or i-e- 
membered. There were probably no fixed dwellings within 
its area, before the tfme of the Roman conqueft of thefc 
fouth-weft parts of Scotland. Whithern, and all its neigh- 
bourhood, were well known to the Romans : Veftiges of 
Roman encampments are ftill to be feen in thele environs. 
Ninian, the founder of the cathedral church of Whithern, 
and the firft bifhop of Galloway, is faid to have occafionally 
inhabited a cave which is ftlU fliewn on the fea-fliore of this 
parifli, adjacent to the houfe of Phylgill. It is probable that 
the Anglo-Saxons of Northumberland, at the time when they 
poffcfled the fea-coaft of Galloway, between the fixth and 
the ninth centuries, firfi: impofed upon this traft, the name 
of GlaJJerton; which, in the ancient Saxon language, and in 
its progeny, the modern German, fignifies the bare hill : a 
name which, at that time, might perhaps be intended to de- 
fcribe the lands to which it was given, as deftitute of wood, 
while the contiguous grounds were overgrown with it. On 
the verge of the fea-fhore, at a fmall diftance from St Nini- 
an's cave, are the veftiges of fome ancient caftle, which may 
pofBbly have been built in the eleventh or the twelfth cen- 
tury, (to judge from the mafonry of the wall, and the outline 
of the foundation), and which might be the original houfc 
or caftle of Phyfgill. In the courfe of the centuries fubfe- 
quent, the parifti was eredted ; its limits were defined ; the 
hufhandry of agricldture and pafturage, was, at length, 
fully eflabliflicd here ; the labourers of the ground were 

emancipated

pafled into the hands of the anceltors and predeccflbrs of their 
prefent proprietors j and that iyftem of life and rural oeco- 
notny, which we have furveyed, was at laft introduced. 

Improvements Suggefied.-^lt is to be wifljed and expefted 
from the liberal intelligence, and prudent adivity of the land- 
holders, and the inhabitants in general, of this parifh, that 
the culture of green crops may be more generally and heartily 
adopted ; that new efforts may be continually made among 
them, to bring ftill more and more of their molTes and muirs 
under tillage ; that the farms may be ftill more carefully in- 
clofed and lubdivided ; that the culture of wheat, in a cer- 
tain proportion, may be adopted into their agriculture, — 
fince where barky grows, wheat may, very often, be fuccefs- 
fully produced j that the crofs-roads may be multiplied apd 
improved ; that, by the increafe of navigation and trade at 
the neareft fca-ports, and the introdu9:ion of new manufac- 
tures into the county, — the great market for the produce of 
the parifh, may be, as it were, brought nearer to it ; that 
beef, mutton, and pork, may be prepared here in large ]uan» 
tities, for fea-ftores, and for other exportation ; that, with- 
out deferting their hufbandjy, thefe good people may tafce a 
profitable fhare in the fifhery of the coafts ; and, above all, 
that a parochial fihool, which is unaccountably wanting, may 
be fpeedily inftituted *. — H.

In confequerce of a letter from the Hon. Lord E{kgrove to 
Mr M'Courty, ftating fo.ne inaccuracies in the account of 
New Hall, and fuggefting the propriety of having them cor- 
reaed ; the tollowing more perfeft one has been drawn 
up, to be inferted, (in the event of another edition), im- 
mediately after the article Pennycuid Houje^ m the hiltory 
of that parini. 

New Hall Sp'ittaly ^c. 

NEW HALL, about three miles above Pennycuick, on the 
north fide of the North Elk, was in 1529, and durmg 
the reft of that century, in the poffeffion of a family of the 
name of Crichtoune How long it was a place, and inha- 
bited by them, before that period^ is uncertain ; but the 
Caftle of Brunftoune, the ruins of which ftill remain, about 
two miles down the river, and on the fame fide, was alfo oc- 
cupied, by a family ot that name, in 1568, at which time, as 
appears by this date on the wall, a part of it at leaft feems to 
have been built. Whether, prior to the date of the eariieft 
writing, it had received the name of New Hall, in contradif- 
tinftion to an old building that had formerly exifted, is 
not known i but that this was the cafe is probable, fronj its 
having been the opiniorji of oue of .it$ proprietors that it was 

once

once a religious houfc ; and alfo from the name of New 
^«./. having . been, given to a building i„ fomcwhat fimilar 
circumftances,clolb .byit, on the lands ofSpittal-, both of 
which particulars will be more fully ftated afterwards 

In 1646 it belonged to Dr Pennycook ; and in his works, 
he mentions fome particular plants found upon the grounds. 
He was alio proprietor of Romanno, a place not far diftant 
tothefouth, in theparifli ofNewlands, where, in 1677, a 
ferious fquabble, between two parties of gypfies, feems to have 
happened, that particularly attrafted his notice. In 1683, he 
built a dovecot on the fpot, apparently to ftew his wit, in 
the following very homely diftich, 

The field of gipfie blood, which here you fee, 
A flielter for the harmiefs dove fhall be. 
Along with this rouplet are, the date, his own initials, and 
thofe of his wife, ftill on the front of the pigeon-houfe ; and 
though his vcrfes are but poor produftions, and his wit of a 
low caft now, he was one of the poets of his day. About 
this time, alfo, fome farms, called Whitefield. between thefe 
two places, belonged to a fon of the hiftorian and Poet 
Drummond of Hawthorndean. Drummond himfelf died ia 
1649. 

In 17*3, about the time of the union, New Hall was ac- 
quired by Sir David Forbes, Knight, who was married to Ca. 
thsrine Clerk, fifter to the firft Sir John Clerk of Penny- 
cuick, and grandmother to David Rae, Efq; Lord Eikgrove, 
one of the Senators of the College of Jnfticc, another filler^ 
being married to Mr Brovrn of Dolphington. 

On the death of Sir David, it devolved upon his eldeft fon, 
Mr John Forbes, advocate, who, as well as his father, was a 
lawyer of very confiderable eminence. He was couOn-ger- 
man, and deputy at Edinburgh, to Prefidcnt Dmican Forbes 
of Cullodcn, when Lord Advocate j an apartment in the houfe

of the fields among the inclofures, to the eafl, are called the 
upper and nether (lower) Cumberland Parks. The viftory 
at Cullodcn fccms to have been peculiarly agreeable in thU 
diftridt. A farm to the fouth, the property of the Hon. Cap- 
tain Cochrane of Lamancha, is called Cumberland ; and on 
the front of the houfe belonging to it, is infcribed, " William 
Duke of Cumberland, Liberty and Property's defender. 
" Culloden Muir, April i6th 1746."— The bodily, as well 
as mental abilities of Mr Forbes, {eem to have been remark- 
able, for it Is related of him, that he once walked from 
Edinburgh to Glafgow, (44 Englifli miles), and after return- 
ing on foot, the fame day, danced at a ball in the evening. 

While inhabited by the Crichtons, it was an irregular 
caftle, and, with its appendages, covered the whole breadth 
of the point on which it ftands, formed by a deep ravine on 
cither fide, running up towards the Pentland Hills, from the 
glen of the Eik behind. The ground floor, . in the front o£ 
the prefent building, made a part of one of its towers ; it is 
arched above, with flits, for defence, on every fide, and its 
wall is fo ftrong, as, in one place, to have a clofet cut out of 
its thicknefs. Some vaults are left, underneath the remains of 
a fmall round tower, on the north, overhanging the eaftern 
' recefs, through which dcfcends a rivulet, in feveral beautiful 
cafcades, rendered dark, and extremely romantic, by the high 
and clofc, and wildly growing trees with which it is filled. 
Over the weftern, which is dry, though likewife {haded vvith 
thick foliage, on a point to the fouth of the garden, was the 
chapel and prifon 5 which lafl: is ftill remembered to have 
been ufed for refraftory coallers. A walk goes round this 
point, forming a noble terrace, from the wefl: end of the 
houfe, looking up the glen, and over to a mineral wefl among 
the copfe, and underneath the pines, on the other fide. The

Oaober 1 791 , he fays, In my infancy, when I ftaid at New 
« Hall, the chapel was in ruins, but the remains of the four 

* walls were feen, and the eaft gable, with a pointed arched 
 window, was pretty entire. On the weft end was a fmall 
« piece of ground, which was called the Chapel-yard, on the 

• north fide of which was a broad grafs-walk, fiiaded with a' 
» double row of line old fpreading beeches. I remember to 
« have heard Mr Forbes fay, that New Hall was a religious 

• houfe. The lands of Spittal were hofpital-lands, probably 
« endowed for fuftaining the hofpital, under the care and 

* management of the religious foundation of New Hall.' 
The territories of the church, from the names of manv dif- 
ferent places in the parifli, feem to have been very extenfive 
in this quarter ; and if New Hall was once a religious houfe, 
which is not unli-kely, it muft have been at a very early peri- 
od. There is a tradition liill handed about, that rhe pro- 
prietors of this place had the right bf pit and gallows, or 
the power, of life and death over their vaflals ; and, in con- 
firmation of this, a ftory is told, that one of them, after re- 
peated offences, having caught a young man breaking into 
the orchard, then at the foot of the caftern rccefs, gave or- 
ders that he fliould immediately be fhut up in the dungeon. 
His mother arriving at the caftle, in qucfl: of her fon, was 
told to go and get ibme refreflimcnt in the hall, and that fhe 

fliould

fiiould foon have a fight of him ; which {he accordingly did, 
and, on being taken to the bottom of the glen, found him 
hanging at a tree on the fpot where lie had been caught. 
As it was only done with the defign of giving the culprit 
and his mother a fevere freight, he was inftantly cut down, 
but it was too late 5 and among the many imprecations flic 
fent forth, it is faid one was a wiOi, « that no proprietors

 With imprecations.' Chapman*s Odyjfe^, 

Although the effefts of this curfe have, long fince, been cur- 
tailed and ended, it is ftill remembered as part of the ftory. 
Moans and fcreams are yet frequently heard, at night, on that 
fide of the houfe, among the trees in the deep recefs i and 
whether from the rapidity of its defcent, or its connedlion 
with this event, is unknown, but the ftream itfelf is ftill dif- 
tinguiflied by the name of the hanging burn 4 It is farther 
added, that, in order to do away the blafting influence of this 
malediftion, the mafter of the place fet out on a long pilgri- 
mage, and leaving an only fifler, of the name of Mary, be- 
hind, flie amufed her lonely hours with the beauties of the 
fcenery afound. About half a mile above the houfe, the 
banks of the Eflc widen and flatten for a confiderable way 
upwards, excepting at one place, about the middle of this 
expanfion, where, contra£led and divided by a crofllng ridge 
of limeftone, it forms a lin or fall, and, in fucceflive leaps, 
pours itfelf into a circular pool, that, under birches, flirub', 
and rocks, fpreads in front, upon a bank of peebles, betwixt 
and a little green facing the fouth. Up to this beautiful 
and fequeftered fpot looks a promontory, formed by the fud- 
den expanfion of the river's banks : That part of it, moft In, 
view of the lin, is marked by a round turf feat, that termi- 
nates a winding path, along the north brink of the glen, all

the way.-from the houfe ; and from the attachment of that 
lady to th.s feat in.particular, the whole eminence has got. 
nnd ft.U retains, the romantic title of Maris Bower. A lime- 
ftone rock in it, now working, has no oiher name but Mary's 
Bower Q^iarry. The winding path can 5e traced bv a 
flowering flirub, here and there, dropt fince, all its length 
xveftward ; and on the e.ift fide bi the feat, a fmall ftream 
precipitates over the lime-ftone craggs, amidft birches and 
copfewood, to the bottom of the glen, upwards of a hundred 
feet. The whole of this tradition was accidentally told by 
an old coaher, of the, name of James Dixon, in March 1787, 
on inquiring how the quarry came to get the name of Mary's 
Eower ; and has fince been heard from feveral others, with 
fome trifling variations ; but from all, this inference is clear, 
that, at a period fo early, as that fuch an occurrence could 
have happened, this place wa^ in the hands of an indepen- 
dent lay proprietor. In the title-deeds, the fortalice of Coal- 
towh is mentioned as belonging to it , and a field among the 
inclofures between the Cumberland Parks, and ftream cal- 
led Monk's Burn, to the eafl, is called the Coaltown Park, 
v/here the tower onee flood. 

In the time of Dr Penecuick, while Cromwell himfclf was 
following the King's army towards Worceflef, fome parties 
from General Monk's detachajent, left behind in Scotland, 
are faid to have been fent to this neighbourhood. According 
to this account, they had a fkirmifli on the Harleymuir, a 
little way eaft on the other fide of the water, and gave the 
name of the Siesl to a part of it that defccnds to the lower 
banks of the Elk, in a point formed by the glen of that river, 
and another that enters it from a rock on the fouth, called 
the Harbour Craig. This circumflance is alfo faid to have dif- 
tinguifhed a flream, that enters tlie glen of the Elk behind a 
cottnge, with its rural accompanyments, in fcvcral confider-

able falls, about d mile below the houfe, and oppofite to the ' 
Steel, by the name of Monk's Burn : One of the Pentland, 
by feme thought to be here a corruption of Piftland, hills, 
about a mile up, from behind which this ftream defcends, is 
called Monk's Rigg (ridge) j and the glade or holm through, 
which the Elk vvindsj and at the head of which the cottage 
ftands at its mouth, Monk's Haugh. Ac the iource of the 
ftream, however, from the weft fide of it, alcends one of the- 
.Spittal Hills, near the fummit of which is a petrifying fpring ; 
and, advancing a little fouthward, the other hill, from which 
alfo, a great way up, iffues fome lime-water of an incrufting 
quality, though not fo llrong. At the foot of this laft, in 
the verge of a rill coming down from between them, the old , 
houfe of Spittal, new roofed, and modernifcd, now Hands. 
In the title-deeds, the lands are dellgned, back and fore Spit- 
tal,. and behind, at the weil end of the hollow formed by the . 
hills, and on the lide of the Elk, \rhieh almoll: encircles 
them, are fome ruins once taken for the original Spittal, but 
which now appear only to have been appendages to it. From 
thefe ruins two paths lead, the cme to'the Fore, or as it is at 
prefent called, the Old Spittal, on the eaft through the pafs ; 
iwid the' other up the Elk, in the direriion of the Fruh of 
Forth. In the angle below the Old Spittal Houfe, formed, 
by the hill and Monk's Burn, a piece of very fertile ground, 
is Hill called the Glebe Croft ; and exactly oppodtc from, 
the other fide of the burn, rifes Monk's Rigg, wuh Moak's 
Road pointing direaiy to Queensferry and Edinburgh, with 
its font-Hone in view commanding all the louth country on' 
the brow, and the ornamented tup of the crols, formerly- 
eredted on its edge, lying at the bottom of the hill. Previ-.

already acquired their prefent defignations. As the monaf- 
tries of Dundrennan, Mclrofs, Newbottle, Newabbey, Glen- 
luce, Kello, and Culrofs» belonged to the order of Ciltertians, 
or Bernardines, who, by the religious profufenefs of King, 
or St David, and others, were extremely rich ; and the 
parifli had its old name from St Kentigern, who was of that 
order, and a monk in the Abbey of Cuirofs, founded by- 
Malcolm M' Duff Earl of Fife. The Spittal was probably a 
hofpitium or inn, and the road, with its croffes, which alfo 
ferved as land' marks, an accommodation for travellers paiEng 
from Qne monaftry to another j the Back Spittal fuiting iuch 
as went by the north fide of the hills. In confirmation of 
this, the weary and benighted traveller is ftill coniidered as 
having a right to fheUer and protedlion at the Old Spittal ; 
and one of the out-houfes, with fome flraw, is generally al- 
lotted for that purpofe. It is alfo remarkable, that there is 
ilill an inn upon thefe lands, though indeed on a different 
foundation, making the firll rtage on the great roads from 
Edinburgh to Moffat, and Dumfries and Biggar, along the 
foot of the Pentland Hills j and farther, it is called the New 
Houfe, though now a very old one, feemiiigly to dhtinguifli 
it from the Spittals, in the place of which it had been built. 
Thefe lands, till lately, held of Herriot's Holpital in Edin- 
burgh. The laft proprietor who refided at Spittal, where 
there is flill a comfortable flated houfe, and fome fine old 
afh trees, was a gentleman of the name of Oiwaid, who was 
accidentally fhot by his fervant who was walking behind 
with his gun, in going to Slipperfield Loch, in the parifli of 
Linton, to fhoot wild ducks ; and he lies in that church-yard, 
under the following epitaph.

The upper part of Monk's Burn runs upon rotten whin, 
of which all the Pentlaud Htlls, to the eaft of it, feem to be 
entirely compoled ; and aoout half way between Monk's 
Rigg and Haugh, near the burn, there is a chalybeate Ipring 
of a very Itrong quality. One of the Pentland Hills, along 
which a road to the north fide is formed, and in part metal- 
led, is compofed of a rotten whin, of a beautiful reddifh buff- 
colour, like Kenfington gravel, fo much admired for walks, 
or the appearance that feme kinds of clay takes when burnt. 

There is alio on the fide of the fame road a thin vein of 
clay, of a hght pink or lilac tint. This road has remained 
unfiniftied, and of courfe impaffible for fome years, although 
it might be compleated, in the moft fufficient manner, for 
lefs than 1 50 1. Sterling, which would give a full and eafy 
fupply of both lime and coal, to thofe on the north fide of 
the hlUsi while, by a ftrange overfight, during this time, 
very large iums have been expending by the inhabitants of 
that dirtria, in uneffe^ual trials to obtain what they can Co 
much more eafily, and with certainty, at fo Imall an expence, 
bring within their reach. On the eaft of Monk's Burn there 
is no lime ; biit on the weft, not only the low grounds are 
full ot both lime and coal, but incrufting, or Hme fprings, 
are to be found, more than two thirds of the way up, both 
the hills of Spittal and Carlops. This is contrary to what 
has been uffcrted, and to the theory of mineralogifts, that 
mountains are entirely compofed of primitive rocks, fuch as

A little below Monk's Haugh, furrounded with rifing 
knolls, and, on three of its fides, by the wooded banks of the 
river, fweeping round, far beneath, is a clear and deep Jake, 
without any vifible fupply or outlet, or change, at any time,1n 
its depth, its waters always touching the green fwjrd afthe 
foot of its dry. and undulating banks. Several years ago, the 
yawl of a pickeroon or provifion boat, that runs from one 
ifland to another, had been picked up in the gulf of Mexico 
by a veflel from the Weft Indies, and was Tent as a curiofiry, 
being built of cedar, to the proprietor. Being repaired and 
painted, it was put upon the lake, and adds to irs beauty. 
When, from the eaftern extremity, the glare of a fummer 
noon begins to mellow, the fifh begin to leap, and the boat,

tlie prcfent houfe of Pennycuick was built, and alfo, though 
i6 miles dillant, and in part over a very bad road, the 
church and fpire of Peebles. The 'ftone hardens when ex- 
pofed to the air, and refcmbles, in appearance, the Portland 
' ftone in England. 

On the fouth lide of the Steel, and weft from Harleymuir, 
at the meeting of two glens, is a Angular rock, of a coarfe 
freeftone grit, compofed of fmall remi-tranfparent peebles, 
refembling a ruinous" grey tower, called the Harbour Craig, 
(cragg). Among its rude pillars and crevices are a number 
of initials and dates, fome of them much earlier, but moft of 
them correfponding to the time of the commonwealth, and 
the reign of Charles the Second. They are faid to have been 
the work of fome of the Covenanters who took flielter about 
it, on the arbitr-ary proceedings and religious diflurbances of 
thofe times. The years 1662 and 1 666 are quite diftincl, 
among many others. On 28th November 1666, at Rullion 
Green, a few miles north, the battle of Pentland Hills \vas 
fought, and the laft of the party, that appeared in force, final, 
ly routed and difperfed, in their way back towards this 
quarter. 

The Building feems to have remained unaltered till the 
time of Sir David Forbes, brother to Duncan Forbes of Cul- 
loden, and uncle to the Prefident j when moft of the old 
caftle, and the religious houfc, if any of it remained, was 
pulled down, and the prefent double houfe erected in its ftead, 
with a couple of wings projeiTting from the front, and walls 
from thefe to two pigcon-houfes at a confiderable diftance, 
connecled by a h^ndfome iron rail. On the fouth-weft fide 
of this court was the garden called the Chapel-yard, men- 
tioned by Mr Tytler, between and the weftern ravine ; 
which, befides the beeches he defcribes, had alfb, on the 
fame fide, a fquare pond occupying its whole breadth, and 

on

on the fouth, next the recefs, a rmv of laburnums, now of a 
large fize. North of the court were the offices, and in front, 
up to the hioh road, diftant about half a mile, extended an 
avenue j-ointing to that end of the neareft hill, where, with 
an almo-ft equal arch, and the lame brightnefs of unbroken 
verdure, the northern hill of Spittal, on the other fide of: the 
Old Spittal Houfe, paffes behind it, and dips from the view. 
At fome diftance Irom the pigeon houfes, this was croffed 
by another avenue at right angles, ftretching fouth^eaft and 
north-weft. Behind the hOufe was a Imall level green, fur- 
rounded by a terrace-walk, terminating in an arbour to the 
caft, beneath which are fome very old elder or bowertrees, 
laburnums, and birdcherries. This arbour looks over the 
new walhing-houfe, on the holm, and river winding far be- 
low, before it turns round the Steel, that like a gently in- 
clined plain, croffing an opening in the glen^ (hows ifs higher 
bank beyond, on this fide of the lake. On the other fide of 
the fartheft Spittal Hi^l, the Efk takes its rife, and about a 
mile and a half weft, forcing its way midft rough and pointed 
rocks, in a deep ravine through the Pentland ridge, betwixt 
the louth hill of Spittal and Carlops, above where it is crofted 
by a bridge under the high road, it turns directly eaflward 
to the Frith of Forth. Above this bridge have been found 
feveral pieces of very rich iron ore j and a great way up 
the Carlops Hill, is a ftrong petrifying fpring. From this 
bridge, following the fhape of a glen in which it is fituated, 
runs a village, begun in 1784, with a triangular area at the 
turn of the pafs or den about its middle, and a ftreet, ftretch- 
ing from it to the bridge, and alfo fouthwards, forming part 
of the high road 60 feet wide. Moft of the houfes are 
covered with tiles and flates. Having purled its way from 
the bridge, beneath the wooded crapgs of the Spittal Hill, 
and a fteep part of the high road called Woodbrae, the river

way to Invereflc, Muflelburgh, and the Fritlrof Forth. The 
principal glen, at the back of the houfe, feparates Mid-Lo- 
thian from Tweedale. and Pennycuick pariili from that of 
Linton; but befides this one, withm a mile beyond it, tp the 
fouth, there are three others, with each its diftinft character 
and rivulet, all running parallel to it, and uniting their 
ftreams, in fucceffion, below the Harbour Craig. Thus united,, 
they join the Elk between and the lower end of the Steel, at 
a little haugh about a quarter of a mile below the houfe, 
which, by taking a fudden turn and circuit before they it?eet, 
they almoft furround. 

What makes thefe particulars interefting, is, that at this 
time, when the property of Mr Forbes, this place was dif- 
tinguiftied by Allan Rtimfay's attachment to it, as well as 
to the proprietor and his family, in conitcjuence of which

Between the houfe and the littk haugh, where the Eflc and 
the rivulets from the Harbour Craig meet, are fome roman-

filled with birches, fhrubs, and copfewood i the clear Itrearn 
purles its way paft, within a few yards, before it runs direftly 
under them, and projeaing beyond their bales, they give 
compleat beild to whatever is beneath, and form the moft 
inviting retreat imaginable, farther up, the glen widens im- 
mediately behind the houfe, into a confiderablc green or 
holm, with the hanging burn, now more quiet, winding 
among peebles, in Ihort turns through it. At the head of 
this howm, on the edge of the ftream, with an aged thorn 
behind them, are the ruias of an old wlfliing, houfe ; and 
the place was fo well calculated for the ufc it had formerly 
been applied to, that another more convenient one was builc 
about twenty years ago, and is ftill to be feen. Still farther 
up the burn, agreeable to the defcription in the dialogue of 
the fecond fcene, the hollow beyond Mary's Bower, where 
the Elk divides it in the middle, and forms a linn or leap, is 
named the How Burn \ a fmall inclofure above is called the 
Braehead park ; and the hollow below the cafcads, with its 
bathing pool, and little green, its birches, wild (hruU, and 
variety of natural flowers in furamer, with its rocks, and 
the whole of its romantic and rural fcenery, coincides ex- 
adUy with the defcription of Habby's How. It was fo 
designed, no doubt, to diftinguilh it from the upper divifion 
of the How, either for the fake of the vcrfe, and the allite- 
ration or initial refemblance, or which is more likely, bccaufe 
fome cottager of that name, in other parts of the poem called

Hab and Halbert, and a favourite in tlie family, had at that, 
or fome former period, chofen this fpot for the Icitc of his 
hur. There are ftill the remains of a cottage ou the top 
of the north bank, immediately over it, and the pool con- 
tinues to be the favourite place for bathh.g. Farther up hill, 
the grounds beyond the How Burn, to the weftward, called 
Carlops, a contraftion forCarline's Loup, were fuppofed once 
to have been the refidence of a Carhne or Witch, who lived 
5n a dell, at the foot, of the Carlops Hill, near a pafs between 
two conic rocks : from the oppofite points of which flie 
Vas often obferved at nights, by the fuperftitious and igno-

30 years ftanding in light of it; and from the open grouuds 
to the fouth, both it and the glen, with the village, and fome 
decayed cottages in it, and the Carline's Loups at its mouth,

proprietor, in compliment to Sir David Forbes, William hns 
evidently been placed before it, in preference to any otaer

after a vifit, the proprietor received the following verfes from 
Mr Bradefute author of the Statiftical Account of Dunfyre, 
and late minifter of that pariih, a refped^able and ingenious 
man, and v?ho, from his intimacy wiih the late Sir James 
Clerk, was alfo well acquainted with whatever related to 
Ramfay's compbfitions, and to the Gentle Shepherd in partis

Morning Walk at New Hall in Mid-Lothian, the feat of Ro, 
bert Brown, Efq; Advocate. 

Waked by the morning rays from fleeting dreams, 
I leave the couch inviting to repofe. 
To trace the fcenes which nature fpreads around ; 
To pleafe the eye or animate the foul, 

With recoUedtions drawn from ancient times. 

We enter firft the glen adorned with trees. 

Where varied fliades and pleafing groves delight 

The warbling birds that perch on every fpray. 

The lulling murmurs of the dlftant Efk, 

At bottom of the woods falutes the ear ; 

Beyond, the rifing heights covered with woods. 

And interfperfed with jutting rocks, invite 

The eye to trace, in beauty's waving line, 

The vivid landfcape, rich with deepening fliades 

Which here o'erhang the glafly glittering flream. 

Till from the widening vale the country op's. — 

The winding path now leads us thro' the wood. 

Where Elk pours forth her filver flowing ftreara 

In fweet retirement, and fequeftered fliade. 

We then approach the opening of the trees 

Where now the ruftic fwain enjoys the banks, 

Happy and blythe, not far his humble Cot, 

Cloathed with the fliining ftraw, whofe white-waflicd walls 

Appear contraflied with the ivy's green. 

Before the door the partner of his cares 

Turns fwift the wheel, and tunes the scoltifli fong, 

Eying

Eying alkance her young ones on the grafs, 

Left they too near approach the river's bank : 

The cattle fprcad around now browfe the herbs, 

Loaded with dews delightful to the tafte. 

The watchful dog guards well the ripened corns. 

And iaves the treafure for his mafter's ufe. 

Near this a plcafing riv'let glides along, 

Falls from the height, and forms the bright cafcade, 

Where hollow rocks furround the foaming pool. 

And form a fhade to fcreen the mid-day fun. — 

From this we mount the bank to view the Lake, 

"With Ihining furface drawn from chryftal fprings, 

Land locked and fmooth, where oft the finny tribe 

Rife at the glittering fly with eager hafte.— 

We now return and trace the river's banks. 

Studded with cowflips, and with copfewoods crowned. 

Beyond, the profpe£t 's barren all and wild. 

With hollow glens and deep fequeftered lawns. 

Now all at once, far up another glen, 

Midft awful folitudes and darkfome dells, 

A high tremenduous rock erefts his front : 

On near approach we found it deeply mark'd. 

With venerable names of thefe who fled. 

In Charles's haplefs days, the haunts of men, 

Purfued by unrelenting bands who fought 

Their death, and waged ignoble war. 

Here fad the preacher flood with folemn paufe. 

To mark, with outftretched arm, the fombrc heath, 

The field- of scottifh and of englilh wars ; 

Or what more near concerned the liftening croud', 

To point the fatal fpot on Pentland Hills, 

Where many a ploughman warrier fought and fell.— 

Slowly we turn and leave thefe gloomy fcenes,

Through which the murm'ring Elk pours forth his flream, 
And view a paft'ral and more pleafing fcene,

on paper or canvas, and a true iikenefs given, flie muft fit for 
her pidture. In this cafe ao violation of cuftom or incongrui- 
ty can ever take place. All Shenftone's infcriptions, and 
many of his other poecns, are mere expreffions of the feel- 
ing excited by the fcenes among which he lived, and in 
which he delighted ; and in this view, as containing the ori- 
ginals from whence his engaging defcriptions were drawn, 
the Arcadian fimplicity of the Leafowes, has been a greater ob- 
ject of curiofity and intereft, to people of genuine feniibility 
and tafte, than places crowded with the raoft expenfive or- 
naments. Befldes the national concern every Scotchman ia 
particular muft hsve,. in whatever relates to a pe*fo.rmaiice, 
which, as a paftoral comedy, has not been furpaliid, or per- 
haps equalled, in any language ; in the fame light, as the 
manners cannot be prefcrvcd, it was defirable to afcertain, 
at leaft, the fpot from whence Ramfay had got thofe pafto- 
ral defcriptions, and fcenes, which are fo inimitably aind faith- 
fully copied. Accordingly the Gentle Shepherd no fooner 
drew admiration, than every trifling ftrearnlet, in the direc- 
tion of the Pentland Hills, was honoured with a Habbie's 
How ; and having once got the name fixed upon it, the whole 
fcenery of the poem was applied to the neighbourhood, with- 
out producing any evidence, that Ramfay had ever refi;ied in 
the place, or had ever an opportunity ©f feeing the fpot itfelf. 
Some forgetting even that Habbie's How was a place, " Where 
a' the fweets of fpring and fummer grow," gave the name, as 
in the water of Glencrofs, to a fpot which has nothing pecu- 
har in itfelf or neighbourhood j which is away from all inha- 
bitants, bare, and furroundcd with marfhes i where there is 
fcarcely a birch, or fhrub, unlefs a ftinted folitary thorn, or

rowan fticfcing otit, as if dropt, by accident, -from a rock, dei 
ferves the name ; where not a flower, but that of whins, 
where the foil is dry, is to be found; and which Ramlay, 
froin having no apparent cotinedion with it, or its neigh- 
bourhood, in all probability never faw,: ot* evfen heard of, in 
his life. On this account, to remove the difagreeable and 
unpleafant fenfations arifing from every fpecies oi uncertain- 
ty, and as a matter of curiofity, it has been endeavoured to fix, 
with precifion, from whence the fcenes of the G-ntIc Shep- 
herd were drawn. Although unconnected with the honour 
and hlftory of Scotland, fuch a fubj €t is amufing, and as a 
matter of curiofity may lead to improvement. Curiofi y is 
one of our earlieft and ftrongeft inciteaieots to a£t on ; it js 
the only road to wildom ; it is the prime uiovcr ok philMio- 
phers, as well as of children j it is lively, enterra ning, and 
innocent in its gratification ; and what is the end of all oar 
purfuits, even the molt important, but the gratification of 
fome one of thole paffions or appetites arifing from external 
objp^lis, through the mediums of perception and emotion, 
which conftitute the very eiTcnce of our being, and without 
which life itielf is beyond our comprchenfion ? At this time 
New Hall, Carlops, and Spittal, all belonged to Mr Fofbes ; 
and it is fomewhat remarkable, that, while Allan Ramlay was 
encouraged by him, and Gay the poet was patroniled by the 
intimate friends of Sir James Clark at Pennycuick, the Duke 
and L'utchefs of Queenfberry, his coufin, Prelidcnt Forbes, 
was the chief fupport of Thomfon, who nuight often have 
been here along with him, and was alio diftinguilhed for the 
accuracy and engaging fimplicity, as well as richnefs, of his 
dcfcriptions of rural life and fcenery. ^ 

Thefe properties, on the death of Mr Forbes, were disjoinr 
ed, but are now again united ; the fartheft of the glens be-

the plantations have been much extended, both down to the 
lake and up towards the village, near which, on an eminence 
at the foot of the hills, a romantic and arcadian fcite has beeu

been built. On the other fiJe of the garden is a large field, 
called the Greenbrae-park, oppofite to the Steel and Harley- 
itiuir, which defcends to the river, fronting the fouth, and 
that has been about 50 years in grafs. In confequence of a 
competition with two gentlemen in the loweft parts of Eafl: 
and Mid- Lothian as to the quality of their paftures, a Wedder 
of two years old, that had been bred on the Harleymuir, of 
the Linton black faced kind, was fed other two years in that 
field, getting the common run of the flock ; and being killed 
in December 1787, one of the quarters, with the kidney, was 
produced, with thofe of the other two gentlemen's, at the 
French Tavern, Edinburgh ; and was adjudged by a Club 
to which the parties belonged, as alfoby Mr Bayle, the land- 
lord, to be the beft of the three. The quarter, before roaft-

found in the infide of the whole Wedder. On the fouth fide 
of the two rocks of Carlops, a fmall valley, called the Car-

ftands. Oppofite to the pafs formed by the rocks, it is open 
.and wide, and the fouth bank low and flat, with a hollow iiv

lop's Glen conneas it with the Efk at the village, making a 
pafs between the two, and the glen, defcending from the 
Harbour Craig, receives the ftream at its loweft extremity, 
and unites them betwixt the houfe and the Steel Weft 
from the rocks, the Dean runs along the foot of the Carlops 
Hill its whole length, and affumes a paftoral and Angular 
appearance. From the flat at the bottom rife three little 
green hills, at equal dilVances from each other, and alfo at 
equal diftances from the two fides of the Dean, called the 
Holehaugh Know, Dun Kaim, and the Picket Craig. The 
firft and laft are almoft perfeft cones, covered with dry green 
turf and of the fame fize, with this only difference, that the 
laft is ftiarper than the other, with a rocky fummit full of 
little caverns. Dun Kaim is triple the fize of the end ones, 
is of a long oval fliape, likewife covered with dry fmooth 
turf, and in the middle is quite flat on the top. It, and the 
Holehaugh Know, are feen from the public road. All the 
high banks and fcenery around, is of the fame uniform ver- 
dure ; and all the tranfitions, except the fummit of the Picket 
Craig, and the fharp point of the Know, are gradual and un- 
dulating. On the middle top of Dun Kaim it is propofed to 
erea the monument to Ramfay. From the bank below the 
Carlop's Hill, between the Know and Dun Kaim, defcends, 
in a high cafcade, a fmall rivulet called the Lin Burn, that 
after running over ftrata of iron, and red and white limeftone, 
immediately joins the Carlop's Burn, on the other fide of the 
Dean. On the top of the fame bank, oppofite to Dun Kaim, 
and in a parallel direaion, and at equal diftances, are feven 
natural pits or excavations of different depths and betwixt 
thefc and the Dean, the bank is compofed of another ftratum 
of lime ftonc, of a clouded mixture of greyiftt green, white, 
and pink colours. Farther on, and a little beyond the

^eep, that a hare being pufhed by the greyhounds, in courf- 
ifig, a few years ago, and having taken to one of them, was 
got out, with the affiftance of a terrier, with the greateft dif- 
ficulty. Over all thefe, fronting the fouth, rifes with aa 
iarch, the Carlop's Hill ; the fame bank, however, continues 
behind one of the rocks, which is a projeftion from it to the 
Elk, and the inclined plain above it at the bottom of the 
hill, direaiy over the vilfage, is called the Lead Flats. Out 
of the fmall diftria of country between this bank called Lead 
Flats, and a fmooth round hill betwixt and Linton, called Lead- 
law Hill, all the filver is faid to have been got, from the lead 
found there, with which Mary of Guife, Queen Mary's mother, 
paid her troops, during the turbulence of hr Regency. At 
the foot of the Dean, eaftward, before it contrafts and deepens 
into a glen, is a fdbterranean fpring, called the Rumbling 
"Well, which appears near half a mile fouth, on the other fide 
of a lime quarry, where, in confequence of a difpute between 
two of the workmen, about 12 years ago, a glove being put 
into it, was carried all the. way through, and came out at the 
place firfi mentioned. The ftream belonging to the third 
glen, that meets the laft one at the Harbour Craig, in confe- 
quence of the workings of the coal, although a much greater 
body of water, likewife difappears, about a quarter of a mile 
above that rock, and fuddenly burfts out with a fall, almoft 
in front of one of its fides. The lime-rock at the Rumbling 
Well is of a dark grey colour, almoft black, with a great

now working behind that rock, called the Harbour Craig

from thofe ofMairfield, and Monk's Burn, of a good qualit'y. 
In the fecOnd glen, a cfiimbling freeftone rock, the whole 
depth of the bank, J roduces a face of pure white fand, upon 
which nothing will grow. Between and the Rumbling \\ ell 
as alfo on the north fide of the houfe, was found a large piece 
of diamond fpar, and above the limeflione, fouth of the well, 
..is a thick bed of clay marl. In digging gravel, with which

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7222383">TIBBERMUIR</name>

By the Rev. Mr John Inglis, Mirtljier.</head>

<p>

Name, 

AMONG Grangers, and in the common almanacks of 
the country, the name of this parifh is Tippermuir ; 
but the orthography adopted in the title, which is univerfally 
in ufc among the inhabitants, is abundantly juftified by an- 
cient writings, and the probable etymology of the name. 
In a charter granted to the monaftery of bcone, in the reign 
of William the Lion *, it is written with the Latin termina- 
tion Tibbinnora: and in Fordun's Hiftory of Scotland, it 
is Tybirmore : Conformably to this ancient orthography, the 
name is undcrftood to be compounded of two Gaelic words, 
tuber and morey which fignify a large well, referring probably 
to a plentiful fpriog of water immediately adjoining to the 
church-yard. 

Extent, Situation, and Surface.— The parifli is, from eaft to 
welV, about 6 miles lont; ; and its breadth varies from one to 
three miles. It is bounded on the eaft by the parifh of Perth ;

on the north, the river Almond feparates it from the pari/h 
of R' dgorton, and a brook called the Poio, from that of 
Methven ; on the weft, it is bounded by the parilh of Galk, 
and on the fouth, by thofe of For;eyiot and Aiierdalgy. The 
furface, without being hilly, is confiderably diverfified. To- 
wards the weft, it exhibits a gentle, flope from fouth to north, 
terminating in a narrow track of level ground ; and towards 
the eaft, the greater part of the fields being fomewhat raifed 
above the level of the Almond, communicate, by a fteep 
defcent, with a delightful plain along the banks of the river. 

Climate and Difecfes, — The air, though rather moift, is not 
accounted unhealthy j and it deferves particular notice, that 
here, as well as in the neighbouring parifhes, the ague, 
which, from time immemorial, had been the moft common 
difeafe of the country, has, within thefe 20 years, complete- 
ly difappeared, without any natural caufe, of fiiftitient im- 
portance, being hitherto afiigned for it. 

AcreSy Soil, Proprietors^ anfl Cultivation. — The parlfh con- 
tains about 4O70 Scotch acres; of thefe 185 are under 
wood 5 96 are part of an extenfive mofs, which furniflies 
the furrounding inhabitants with peats for fuel ; 100 more 
arc in the ftate of uncultivated heath ; and the remainder, 
about 4289, are all arable ground. 

The cultivated land contains feveral varieties of foil. To- 
wards the eaft, upon the barks of the Almond, it is a Tandy 
loam; near to the town of Perth, fomewhat of a clayey 
confiftence ; and upon the hij^ber grounds, more light, and 
thin, wlih a gravelly bottom. Towards the weft, the bottom 
is rather cold, and generally tilly, which occafions many of 
the fields to be wet ; but the furface foil is, notwithftanding, 
tolerably fertile ; and though, in fome places, it partakes a 

little 



Tihbennttif, • 633 



little oF the nature of rhofs, the greater part may be claffed 
■ under one or other of the different kinds of loam. 

The whole pa^ifli, excepting about 500 acres, is the pre- 
perty of the Dulce of Athol and the Earl of Kinnouli and 
the land is cultivated by about 60 farmers, great and fmall, 
in a thriving condition. In no place, perhaps, are the late ra- 
pid improvements in agriculture more remarkably eXamplified 
than in this particular parilh. About 30 years ago, it was 
diftinguiflied by its poverty ; at prefent, its furface exhibits 
to the eye a rich and fertile profpedl, and the increafed 
wealth of the inhabitants very properly appears in th^eir inl- 
proved manner of living. It is alfo pleafant tO remark, that 
the fpirit for agricultural improvement flill appears to keep 
pace with, if it does not even anticipate, the farmer's acqui- 
• fition of wealth. In one particular view, indeed, the cha- 
racter of the farmer's mind has undergone a moft impor- 
tant and happy change : Formerly, he was fo obfHnately 
prejudiced in favour of the practice of his fathers, that he 
could not liften, without a fneer, to any fuggeftion relative 
to new improvements ; now his prejudices are fo completely 
removed, that h,e is eager to know and underftahd whatever 
improvements others are attempting, and even to adopt fuch. 
as appear to be reafonable, though at firfl: upon that fmall 
fcale which prudence undoubxedly dictates. "What better 
fubjea could the Agricultural Society defire to cultivate, 
than a farmer's mind in this particular flate * '

Staiijllcal Account 



The principal crops are oats, barley or bear, and clover 
with rye-grafs. Wheat alfo, though not hitherto univerfally 
cultivated, is becoming every ye?r more common. A preju- 
dice was long entertained againft fowing wheat upon fields 
that are naturally wet, from an idea that fuch a foil, when 
fwelled with the winter rains, would be apt to caft out the 
roots of the young plants ; but experience has clearly fiiewn 
that this objedion, however fpecious in theory, is not entitled 
to much pradlical regard where early fowing has been at- 
tended to, the wetnefs of the foil has feldom, if ever, prov- 
ed fatal to the crop of wheat. Peafe and beans having been 
found precarious crops, are rather lefs cultivated than they 
were fome time ago. Turnips, though not altogether ne- 
gle£led, are neither a general crop, nor raifed in great quan- 
tities. Where the fields are wet, the farmer is afraid of 
poaching the foil, in carting them off during the winter j be- 
fides, the confumption of the butcher market of Perth is by 
no means equal to the fupply of fat cattle which the wide 
2,nd ricli country around is capable of affording ; and many 
farmers, who might otherwife have large fields of turnips, 
are thereby induced to content themfelves with fuch a quan- 
tity as they find to be ufeful in rearing their young ftock. 
The ^quantity of potatoes is inconfiderable, being cultivated 
chiefly for family ufe. Flax is by no means a crop high in 
the farmer's eftimation ; befides the trouble attending it, it 

• has 

tenants ;— by granting them improving leafes upon moderate 
jermsr-—by lodging them in more comfortable houfes than had 
been formerly allowed to people of their condition ;— by per- 
fonal attentions, in which he did not fail to diftiuguifli the moR 
Ueferving ;— by manifeaing, equally in his words and anions, 
the intereft he felt in their profperity ;— he mfufed mto them a 
foirit fupcrior to their former condition, gradually enlarged 
their views, raifed, in fome fenfe, their rank in fociety, and thus 
Breoared them to devife and execute fuch plans of improvement

has the peculiar difadvantage of adding nothing to the dung- 
hill, which muft undoubtedly be an important objt£lion with 

' farmers who purchafe dung in the town of Perth, at the rate 
of 3 s. or 4 s. for the cart load, and afterwards carry it in 
fome inftances five or fix miles *. 

Since the late rapid introdudtion of fallow, wheat, clover, 
&amp;c. in this parifh, there has not been fufficient time for any 
particular rotation of crops obtaining fuch a decided prefe- 

^ rence, as to be univerfally adopted ; but the following is the 
rotation moft likely to prevail ; — ly?, year, fallow; — ^d, wheat, 
with the whole dung of the farm, and alfo lime occafionally ; 
— 3rf,'peafe, Or clover and rye-grafs, and perhaps a few tur- 
nips, which are found to anfwer tolerably well without dung j 
— 4/^, barley or bear 5 — 5/^, clover and rye-grafs ; — tth^ 
oats f . 

The Implements of hufbandry have been gradually improv- 
ing for many years. The old Scotch plough, indeed, long 
maintained its' ground in oppofition to a variety of others, 
which were fucceffively tried and abandoned ; but an Eng- 
lifli plough, with a mould-board of caft metal, which was

* Lime is the only other manure ufed in the parifli, and is 
procured at a rcafonable rate, at the port of Perth. 

f One objeaion, indeed, feems already to occur againft this 
mode of management, and may hereafter have influeuce. Re- 
peated fallows, that admit of no crop for the fealbn, are not 
perhaps ablolutely necciFary for the mere purpofeot keeping the 
land clean, provided that green crops, and particularly drill 
crops, be jud.uoufly mtroduced ; and though it Ihould even be 
lound impolCble, upon fome foils, to raife a good crop of wheat 
without a previous tallow, it may admit of a quellion, whether 
a crop of barley m place of the wheat, together with a jrreen 
crop in place ot the tallow, might not be more valuable than 
the crop of wheat that would be thereby fuperfeded ; and whe- 
i her the land might not alfo remain in equally eood, if not beC 
ter condition. o ;

lately introduced, has obtained a decided preference, and 
now almoft univerfally in ufe *, 

Upon the wet grounds, the feed time is often retarded by 
rains. In the year 1795, many of the farmers had it not in 
their power to begin the fowing of oars till the month of 
May; but this year, viz. 179(5, fome oats have been fown in 
the firft week of March— the one the lateft, and the other 
perhaps the/earlieft feed time that is remembered. In ordi- 
nary feafons, the fowing of oats is begun in the firO: week of 
April, barley in the firft week of May, and wheat about the 
middle of September. The improvement of the foil, and 
the pradtice of a more regular hufbandry, have rendered our 
haryeft feafon fomewhat/ earlier than fo-merly. It is com- 
mon to begin cutting wheat about the end of x-^ugufl: ; bar- 
ley in the beginning of September; and the other corn in 
courfe, without intermitting the harveft work. The average 
crop of oats upon a Scotch acre is 5 bolls ; of barley 7 ; of 
wheat 9, all Linlithgow m.eafure. About 1 boll and 2 pecks 
of oats produce a boll of meal. The average price of oat 
meal, barley, and peafe, is 15s. for the boll; of wheat, one 
guinea f . 

Nearly all the farms are inplofed and fubdivided v/ith 
ditches and hawthorn hedges, but all the inclofures of this 
kind are hitherto infufficient ; and this, it is believed, muft 
continue to be the cafe, till much more efftdlual means be 
employed for protedting and rearing the young hedges, and 
efpecially for faving their flioots from being croped by the 

farmer's 

* The plough alluded to does not appear to have any diftin- 
guifhtng name that is generally known. It is not Small's 
plough.

farmer's cattle. At prefent, the infufficiency of the inclo- 
fures appears to be attended with lefs inconvenience, becaufe 
there is very httle of the land in the ftate of pafturage ; but 
perhaps the want of fufiicient inclofurcs is one great rcafon 
why the pafture fields are fo few ; for wherever there is in- 
clofed ground in the neighbourhood, the proprietor finds it 
in his power, by keeping it in pafture, and letting it annually 
for the leafon, to draw fuch a high rent as is out of all due 
proportion to the rent of corn land. 

The valued rent of the parifh is 4921 1. Scotch money*; 
the real rent, about 3200 1. Sterling. The average rent of 
the Scotch acre is about 15 s. Sterling. 

ManufaBures. — To the enterprife and induftry of very 
early times f, we are indebted for a large canal or water- 
lead, drawn from the river Almond, which interfefts an ex- 
tenfive meadow, called Ruthyen or Huntingtower-haugh, in 
the eaft end of the parifli 5 and the peculiar advantage which 
this affords for manufaduring eftablifliments, has been very 
induftrioufly improved within thefe late years. One of the 
firft manufadlures attempted here waS that of paper j and at 
the mill ereaed for this purpofe, Morifon and Lindfay of 
Perth at prelent keep two vats employed in the manufaaurc 
chiefly of the coarfer articles, fuch as cartridge, blue, and 
other packing papers; the quantity manufaaured in one 
year is from 5000 to 6000 reams, and the number of perfons 
employed in the work from 25 to 30. The canal, however, 
and the adjacent grounds, offered more diftinguilhed advan- 

tages

tages to the manufaaurer in other departments; and accor- 
dingly a bleachfield, under the firm ot Richardfon and Co. 
whofe buildings and machinery were erefted here in the year 
1775, has become a very large and important concern. The 
brown cloth to be bleached is brought chiefly from Perth, 
Dundee, Dunfermline, Edinburgh, and Gla(gow ; but fuch 
is the increaiing charaiter of the field, and the high reputa- 
tion of the adting partner of the company, that, for fome 
years paft, a confiderable quantity of diapers in particular, 
have been regularly fent to him from Darlington in England. 
About 70 Scotch acres are commonly covered with cloth, 
and the work employs or maintains about 100 men, women, 
and children. There are alfo fome other fields in this pa- 
rifli, employed as bleaching ground, in connexion with a 
work, whole buildings and machinery are in the parifh of 
Perth *. And it ought not, perhaps, here, to remain unob- 
ferved, that at prefent the quantity of cloth bleached in the 
neighbourhood of Perth, far exceeds the quantity that is 
woven or otherwile raanufadured in the town and diftridl 
around. This would lead us to prefume, either that there 
muil be fomething in the fituation peculiarly favourable to 
the operation of bleaching, or that nothing is wanted but 
e^ual enterprile in the other departments : And that the laft 
fuppofition may be the juft one, is rendered probable, by the 
uncommon fuccefs of fome late attempts, of which a remark- 
able example naturally prefents itfelf in the cafe of a print- 
field, under the firm of Toutig^ i^o/r, Richardfon^ and Caio f, 
which was eftablifhed in this parilh upon the fame canal, fo 
lately as the year 1792, and has already become an object 
of fuch importance, as to be entitled to a diRinguiflied place

in this ftatiftlcal report. A bleachfield upon a fmall fcale 
gave way to this more important work on rhe fite of it ; and 
additional grou^id having been procured, as well as ad- 
ditional houfes ereiled, the work already employs about 
250 men, women, and children. The fpirit and fuccefs, with 
which the bufinefs is here condudled, may be judged of by 
the following inftance : In the year 1793, when the general 
ftagnation of credit, and the want of market for cotton goods 
in particular, induced many of the principal mSnufadlurers, 
either to difmifs a part ot their working people, or to reftri£t 
their employment to 3 or 4 days in the week, the managers 
of this printfield, though then but an infant Company, re- 
jedled fuch an expedient, and at the fame time adopted 
another well worthy of being imitated, if the fame neceffity 
fhould again occur. Inftead of difmiffing any of their people, 
or reftridting their days of working, they made a fmall re- 
duction, for the time, in the rate of wages, which enabled 
them more eafily to keep the ufual number of hands in con- 
ftant employment ; and while, in this way, the earnings of 
the working people were lefs impaired, the full benefit of 
their induftry was preferved to the public, and the vices that 
arife from idlenefs happily prevented, ihis work derives 
much advantage from the ftaple manufadlure of the country 
jiround being cloth of fuch kinds as are adapted to the pur- 
pofc of printing, and from a fafe, regular, and expeditious 
conveyance of goods to the London market, by means of the 
fmall veflels that are employed in carrying falmon from the 
port of Perth. Befides thefe things, the whole country 
around Perth affords peculiar encouragement to manufaftu- 
rers of every defcription, from the average prices of corn and 
butcher's meat being here confiderably lower than in the weft 
of Scotland, which is at prefent the principal feat of manu. 
faaures,~an advantage naturally derived from the fuperior

extent and fertility of the country, compared to the popula- 
tion of the town and its neighbouring villages. The high 
price of coals is perhaps the only peculiar difadvantage that 
attends the manufa£lurers of this diftridl ; and even this dif- 
advantage has been confiderably leffened by the wifdom of 
the Lcgiflature, in abohfliing the duty upon fea-borne Englifli 
coals. 

Wages.— The average yearly wages of a ploughman are

lias been lately repaired and rendered convenient. ' The

different times. The ftipend, in confequence of a late aug- 
mentation, confifts of 8 chalders of meal and bear, and 35 I.

toW of the kirk-feffion, to whom every allowance is made for 
rendering them comfortable, that would not operate to the 
difcouragement of induftry. Befides the intereft of 60 1, 
Sterling, and the collections at the church, &amp;c. a/mall paro- 
chial affeffment is made for their better fupport ; one half of 
which is paid by the heritors, and the other by the farmers, 
&amp;c. the mode of the ^ffclTment being regulated by an aCl and

which, compared with the nature of the work, muft give it 
importance in the view of the antiquary. It is nearly 1 8 
feet broad, 3 feet deep, and, according to the courfc of the

tions of the place ; for, when it approaches Perth, it divides 
itfelf into two branches, which furround the town in a deep 
bed, clofe to the fire of the ancient walls. , But it is chiefly 
in its connection with the corn mills, that we are enabled to 
trace its antiquity. The mills of Perth, as ferved by this ca- 
nal, or lead, having been originally the property of the kings 
of Scotland, are mentioned by them in fcveral very ancient 
charters \ and in the year 1244, we find Alexander II. grant- 
ing to the Monaftery of Black Friars of Perth, a pipe of 
water from this canal, which he there denominates his Mill- 
lead, conformably to the name of The Ktng's heady which it 
ftill bears *. Upon this evidence alone, the canal m queitioa 
may undoubtedly be ranked among the earlieft work of uti- 
lity in our country, of which we ftili enjoy the advantage. 
It is difficult, indeed, to give credit to our own aticejlors at fo 
early a period^ for all the entcrprife and indultry which it re- 
quired. And when we recollect its probable defign, origi- 
nally, as an aid to the fortifications of Perth, it will not per- 
haps be unnatural to fuppofe it a Roman work ; at leafl-, 

this idea will not appear improbable to thofe, who, from dif- * 
ferent circumftances, and particularly from the form and ar- 
rangement of the ftreets of Perth, afcribe the town itfelf to 
the Romans f.

t Whatever there may be in this fuppofition refneaine the 
canal. It appears to derive fome additional countenance from 
the family-h.rtory of the Mercers of Akiie, which enables us, Z 
far as we may confider ,t authentic, to trace the.cora mill of 
Perth, and confequently this canal or lead upon which they de-

Huntlngtower Caftle, formerly Ruthven Caftle, which 
js fituated in this parifh, may perhaps be entitled to attention 
as the ancient feat of the Ruthven or Gowrie family, fo re- 
markable for its fingular and myfterious cataftrophe : But an 
event which has been the ground of fo much controverfy as 
that which is known by the name of Gowriis Con/piracy, i$ 
evidently too great a fubjeft, either for examination or detail 



in 



1.44 fbove mentioned. Upon the authority of tradition, and 
fome mfcrjptions of uncertain date, together with the c W 
fiance of three m.ll-rynds being ftll a part of the Mercer's arms 
3t IS generally believed, by thofe who have inquired into' the fubl 
jea, that the corn-milis ferved by this canal were onginally the 
property of that family, and granted by them to the king, who 
in return, gave them a burial-place in the church of Perth' 
%vh.ch the family ft.ll pofTefFe^. And if we compare thefe cir' 
cumftances with a chapter of confirmation granted by David 
I. to the Abbey of Dunfermline in the year 1140. (See Sir 
James Dalrymple's Colledions) we find that the tranfadion air 
luded to, rauft have taken place, and confequcntly that the ca- 
nal itfelf muft have exilied, prior to the date of this charter : 
For the king, therein, either gives away for the firft time, or 
confirms what his predecefTors had done in giving away, the 
whole property of che church of Perth to that Abbey, in whofe 
poffeffion it accordingly remained till the period of the reforma- 
tion I and confequently, the royal grant of a burial-place in that 
church to the family of Aldle, as a return for their gift of the 
mills ferved by this canal, mud have been of earher date than 
the year 1 140, from vi^hich period the church and its appen- 
dages were no longer at the difp.ofal of tlje kings of Scotland. 
If this fort of evidence, then, can warrant us to believe that the 
canal in queftion belonged to the Mercers of Aldie before the 
year 1 140, there alfo arifes ftrong prefumption of its having 
been a work of ftill earlier execution ; for the nature and defign 
of the work wjU fcarce admit of our believing it to have been 
originally executed by the Mercers, or any private family whatr 
ever, but naluialiy lead to a fuppofition of its having been, in 
the firft inftance, a public concern, \yhiph, from circumftanccs 
now unknown, had at length come into the hands of a private 
family, perhaps orjly as far, as regarded its connc«5lion ^yith the 
corn. mills.

body, and prefented a memorial againft the illegal and op. 
preffive anions of his two favourites, whom they reprc 
rented as moft dangerous enemies to the religion and liber- 
ties of the nation. James, though he received their rc- 
monftrance with the complaifance that was neceffary in his 
prefent fituation, was extremely impatient to be gone j but 
as he approached the door of his apartment, the Tutor of 
Glammis rudely flopped him. The King complained, cx- 
poftulatcd, threatened, and finding all thefe without effea, 
burft into tears. * No matter, faid Glammis, fiercely, 
better children weep than bearded men." Thefe words 
made a deep imprefEon on the king's mind, and were never 
forgotten. The. conlpirators, without regarding his tears 
or indignation, difmifled fuch of his followers as they fuf- 
peded, allowed none but their own party to have accefs 
to him J and though they treated him with great refpedt, 
guarded his perfon with the utmoft care. This enterprifc 
is ufually called by our hiftorians, The Raid of Ruihven *.* 
Thofe concerned in the tranfadion were afterwards declared 
guilty of high treafon. 

An extraordinary exploit of a fair lady has likewife added 
to the renown of this ancient caftle, and has given the name 
of The Ma'tden^s Leap^ to the fpace between its two towers, 
which, though united by late buildings, were originally fepa- 
rate. A daughter of the firft Earl of Gowrie was courted 
by a young gentleman of inferior rank, whofe pretenfions 
were not countenanced by the family. When a vifitor at the 
caftle, he was always lodged in a feparate tower from the 
young lady. One night, however, • before the doors were 
• fliut, flie conveyed herfelf into her lover's apartment ; and 
 fome prying Duenna, acquainted the Countefs with it, who

f cutting off, as {he thought, all pofliblllty of retreat, haften- 

* ed to furprife them. The young lady's ears were quick,— 

* flie heard the footfteps of the old Countefs, ran to the top 

* of the leads, and took the dcfperate leap of 9 feet 4 inches 

* over a chafm of 60 feet, and luckily lighting on the battle- 

* ments of the other tower, crept into her own bed, where 

* her aftonifhed mother found her, and, of courfe, apologifed 

* for her unjuft fufpicion. The fair daughter did not choofe 
« to repeat the leap, but the next night, eloped and was mar- 

* ried 

After the forfeiture of the laft Earl of Gowrie, this caftle 
and the adjoining manor, were beftowed by King James VI. 
upon the family of Tullibardine, now united, by marriage, to 
the family of Athol, in whofe pofTeffion they ftill remain ; 
but as all idea of continuing this for a feat of family- rcfidence 
has been for fome time abandoned, the Duke has very wife- 
ly availed himfelf of the advantage which the local firuatioti 
affords for the different manufactures already defcribed \ and 
fuch is the change in the circumftances of the place, concur- 
iring with the genius of the times, that the fame caftle, iu 
which the prOud and powerful baron once confined his king 
as a prifoner, is now quietly occupied by a colony of callico- 
printers. 

Ttbhermuir was, at an early period, the refidence Qf feveral 
bifhops of Dunkeld, particularly of Bifibop Geoffrey, and 
Bifhop Sinclair, who both died here, the one in the year 
I24$h the Other in 1337 f. During their times, too, the

principal place of worfhip belonging to this parifh. was fh(J 
church of St Servanus *, (commonly called St Serf's Chapel) 
fituated on the north fide of the river Almond, and accor- 
ding to modern boundaries within the parifh of Redgorton 
The defertion of this church is afcribed, by tradition, to the 
melancholy accident of a child of the Lord of Ruthveh, who 
had been baptlfcd there, having, on the way home, been 
drowned in the Almond. 

At Tullilum too, in the eaft end of this pariCh, there was 
once a convent of Carmelites, but the name of the founder 
is not prcfcrved. Our beft information refpefting this place

Biftiop Sinclair's name, however, is ftill better known in hif- 
tory, and the honours that adorn it are not of an ecclefiaftical 
kind alone. A military exploit, that he performed in the glo- 
rious reign of Robert Bruce, fo delighted that wife and valiant 
prince, that he ever afterwards called him his Bijhop. Edward 
II. the Englifh king, taking advantage of the abfence of Robert, 
who was then in Ireland, had fent a great army into Scotland 
to take revenge for the lolTes of former years ; and the Englifii, 
having been thrice defeated by Douglas governor of the bor- 
ders, had recourfe to the expedient of fending a naval force in- 
to the Forth, to infeft and plunder the coaft. To check the 
progrefs of thofe who had difembarked, Duncan Earl of Fife 
a/Tembled 500 men, and marched at their head towards the 
enemy ; but having obferved their vaft fuperiority in number, 
he was returning homeward, leaving the country at the mercy 
of the Englifh, when Biftiop Sinclair, with ah)Out 60 attendants, 
fortunately met htm. Aftiamed of the Earl's timidity, the 
Bifhop laid hold of a lance, and called, with a loud voice, upon 
all the friends of their country to follow, him. Being readily 
obeyed, he charged the enenjy with fuch vigour, that he quick- 
ly routed them ; and thofe who efcaped from the field of battle, 
having precipitately fled to their fhips, nwny of them were 
drowned in thtir hurry to embark. Buchanan, Maitland,

is derived from Keith's Lives of the Bifliops, where we learn 
ihat Richard Inverkeithing Bifliop of Dunkeld built here 
a chapel and a houfe in I26a and that the Synods of the ' 
Diocefe met here till 1460, when Thomas Lauder Bifliop of 
Dunkeld removed them to his own cathedral. 

Tibbermuir has alfo given its name to the firft battle that 
was fought between the Marquis of Montrofe and the Cove- 
nanters, though the field of battle is perhaps as much, if not 
more, within the parifli of Aberdalgy. which at this place 
approaches very near to the church of libbermuir. Before 
the engagement, the Covenanters were addrefled by one of 
their enthufiaftic preachers, in a manner fuited to the geni- 
us of the times. * If ever God, faid he, fpoke a word of 
' truth out of my mouth, I promife you, in his name, affured 
* victory this day but the event was not of a kind to juf- 
tify much future confidence in his promifes ; — the Cove- 
nanters, amounting to about 6000 foot, and 600 horfe, were 
completely vanquilhed by about 1700 half-armed Highlanders 
and Irifli, who left 2000 of them dead in the field, and took 
2000 prifoners. 

Characier of the People, ^c. — The fobriety of the people 
may be in feme meafure inferred from the fingle circumftan- 
' ce, that there is only one ale-houfe, or whilky-fhop, in the 
parifh. Their induftry, too, may be accounted confiderable, 
from what has been faid of their agriculture and manufac- 
tures ; and if their minifter's report can be received as im- 
partial evidence, they are no lefs diftinguifhed by Chriftian 
charity, in the different branches of that cardinal virtue. 

The only peculiar difadvantage of outward fituation, un- 
der which they labour, is that of bad roads ; and if Ib^ie 
fpeedy and tffe«Slual method of improving them covicl be 
adopted, the relief would be great indeed ! In rAe mean

time, they are thankful for the advantage they derive from i 
lately-formed turnpike-road pafling through a part of the 
parifh ; and for the gradual, though flow, improvement of 
their other roads, which the {latutelabour is in the courfc 
of accomphihing.
