PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1011507">PEEBLES</name>. 

(CotJNTY OF Peebles, Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale, 
Presbytery of Peebles,) 

By the Rev. William Dalgliesh, D. D.</head>



<p>Name and Situation of the ^o%un and Parijh 

TpEEBLES, the name of the burgh and parifti, in the oldeft 
writings Peblis, feems plainly to have been taken from 
the pebbles with which the foil abounds, particularly where 
the town was firft built. Being the county town, and the 
feat of a preftytery, Peebles gives name tp both. The town 
ftands on the N. fide of the river Tweed, where Peebles' Wa- 
ter falls into it j the old town on the W., and the new on the 
E. fide of that water, joined by two bridges carried over it, 
Vol. XIL _ A and 



Statl/lical Account 



and communicating with the country on the S., by an 
cient and well built bridge of 5 arches over the Tweed. The 
landward part of the parifli is from E. to W. s\ miles, and 
from N. to S. 10 miles, and contains 18,210 acres. The ri- 
ver Tweed, running through it from W. to E., divides it in- 
to nearly equal parts. Peebles, called alfo Eddleftone water, 
fubdivides the N. part of it. The royal burgh of Peebles 
ftands in the centre, and in a fituation remarkably pleafant. 
It is built in a beautiful and healthy opening in a hilly coun- 
try. It has the Caflle of Horfburgh, fituated on a gentle e- 
minence on the E. ; the Caftle of Needpath, embofomed ia 
an amphitheatre of wood, on the W. ; the rich ftrath of Ed- 
dleftone water, adorned with gentlemen's feats, on the N. ; and 
a variety of thriving plantations on the S. Like as in the 
Tempe of Theffaly, th- river, in clear flreams, and beautiful 
windings, flows through the middle of the vale, which, on 
both fides of the river, is adorned with rich naeadows, and 
fields of corn. Verdant hills, covered with flocks and herds, 
rife gently all around ; and higher mountains, emitting fprings 
more falubrious than Offa or Olympus, rear their lofty fum- 
mits behind, and terminate the profped. The fituation of 
Peebles is as healthy as it is pleafant. The foil is dry, and 
the air well ventilated and pure. The Tweed runs through 
a track of 80 miles, taking the ftraight, and 100 miles, fol- 
lowing the ferpentine line of its courfe, and falls 1500 feet : 
But though it has finiQied one-third only of its courfe, it has 
fallen two-thirds of its defcent at Peebles, which is only 500 
feet above the level of the fea. Situated in a centrical part of 
the country, Peebles has the rains from all quarters, ma very 
moderate degree: fo that the average quantity yearly is only 
25 inches. And guarded on the N. E. by the higheft part 
of that long range of mountains which runs from Lammer- 
muir to the head of Eddleftone water, Peebles commonly is 
«ot vifited by the eaftern fog one day ia the year. _^ 



Of Peebles, 3 

Soily Culture^ and Rent of Lands, — The foil on the level of 
tlie Tweed, and Eddleftone water, is clay mixed with fand, 
and fit for corn or grafs. The lands rifing a little higher are 
generally loam on a gravelly bottom, and produce excellent 
barley, oats, and ull green crops. The foil on the fkirts and 
fides of the hills, is an eafy and rich earth, and thefe grounds, 
•where not inclofed, are kept alternately in natural grafs and ia 
corn. Improvements in agriculture have of late years made 
a rapid progrefs in the parifh of Peebles ; 1500 acres are al- 
ready enclofed. There are 700 acres more of infield ground, 
a great part of which will be enclofed in a Ihort time. Of 
outfield ground, which is fometimes in tillage, but more com- 
monly in natural grafs, for pafturing cows and horfes, ther:e 
are %oo acres. The other lands, being hillj', afford excellent 
pafture for flieep, and are employed for this purpofe. The 
lands nigh the towa are let at from 40 s. to 50 s. the acre. 
Within thefe ao years, the rental of the parifbis become dou- 
ble ; and in Jlo years, feptuple ; for the valuation in 1681 
was 5036]. Scots. The prefent rental is now above 3000 1. 
Sterling, paid to 16 heritors, of which two only, and the bur- 
gelTes, who are many ©f them proprietors of lands, refide in 
the parilh. The Peebles grey pea has long been in high efti- 
mation all over the country for fee4 ; as alfo are the oats, 
which, raifed from a warm foil, make exccilenJ: feed for lands 
that are higher and colder. With regard to potatoes, firft 
imported into Britain by Sir Walter Raleigh, and the moft 
ufeful root that ever was imported into this, or any other 
country, they are nowhere cultivated with more care, and 
raifed in greater excellence and increafe than at Peebles. 
Ground is parceled out for planting from i to 6 pecks, at 
1 s. 6d. the peck ; 110 or 12c fquare yards are ufually al- 
lowed to the peck. The proprietor or polTeffor of the ground 
ploughs it till it is clean, drives out the dung, and plants the 

■^2 potatoes

potatoes with the plough ; and befides having his ground 
cleaned and manured, has a reafonable rent for his lands, and 
price for his labour. The little tenants furniih the dung and 
feed, affift in cleaning the ground, and planting the potatoes, 
hoe and dig them after their hours of working, which contri- 
butes to their health, and have their potatoes for half of the 
price at which they could otherwife purchafe them, and which, 
to many families, furnifti a third part of their fubfiftence 
a very cheap rate. 

Animah.—'l\\^ Tweed abounds not only with trout, but 
Salmon, which vifit the higher parts of it for fpawning, to- 
wards the end of the year. Accordingly the Peebles Arms 
are 3 falmon, In the parifti there are 200 horfes, and 500 
cows, both much better than in former times. The number 
of ftieep is about 8000. The ancient kind is ftill generally 
retained ; but by their being kept fewer in number, and being 
better fed, they are much improved in quality. As the 
grounds in this part of the country are generally dry and 
healthy, the flieep are not fo liable to difeafe as in many other 
places. Of thefe, what is called the fichnejs, is generally the 
moft common and the moft fatal. It is an inflammation in 
the bowels, brought on by the full habit of the animal, by 
fudden heats and colds, by eating wet and frofted grafs, or by 
lying on wet grounds ; and might, in moft cafes, be prevent- 
ed by bleeding, by gentle treatment, and by change of paf- 
ture. It is a pity that the moft harmlefs, and the moft ufeful 
of all animals (hould, in this refpeft, have fo long been the 
moft negleaed. By a better knowledge of the difeafes of the 
flieep, their natural caufes, and the means of preventing or 
curing them, many thoufands of them might be annually fav- 
ed to their proprietor, and to the country.

Inoculation has been praftifed for many years in this 
county by able furgeons, with great fuccefs, and becomes 
more and more general. Above a thoufand have been ino- 
culated, without one dying. Nay, feme parents have even 
inoculated their children themfelves, and have perfedlly fuc- 
ceeded. The inhabitants of the parifli, in town and country, 
are generally healthy, and live many of them to very advan- 
ced 

* From the number of communicants in each parifh, entered laft century on 
the records of the preibytery, as the rule by which the money then given tp- 
their burfar was levied from the feveral parifhes, it is evident that the popula- 
tion of this panlh, and of this county in general, has.fince that time, decreafed 
more than oije-fourth part. This is owing to the annexation of farms, and throw- 
ing down of cottages, by which the great tenants are enriched, but the fmail 
ones, and the cottagers, are. almoft wholly extinguiflied ; and manufadtures not 
having been eftablilhed in towns and villages, the people muft go elfewhere as

.ced age. Lately there were 6 men living at the fame time, 
within fifty yards of one another, in the old town of Peeblc^, 
whofe ages together amounted to 518 years, and who, feveral 
of them, died near 100 years old. The people are regular in 
their attendance on the inftitutions of religion, fober, peace- 
able, and virtuous ; fo that, in the memory of the oldell per-i 
fon living, no native of Peebles has either been banifhed, or 
fuffered capital punilhment. In the way in which holidays of 
human inftitution are now obferved in Europe, it is of advan- 
tage to induftry, to virtue, and to religion itfelf, that we have 
fo few of them in Scotland. In every age and country, the 
Sabbath has been, and ever mull be, the great fupport of reli- 
gion and of virtue among mankind. Nothing has fo much 
liurt the devout fanftification of that holy day in other coun- 
tries, as men's being accuftomed to employ one part «f a ho- 
liday in devotion, and the other in diverfion : And nothing 
has tended more to preferve a due obfervance of the Sabbath, 
3 reverence of God, and veneration for religion and its ordi- 
nances in Scotland, than this, that our holidays are moftly ob- 
ferved with the fame religious fanftity as the Sabbath. 

•Stipend, Poor, Schools, &amp;c.— The church, which is eUgant 
and fubftantial, ornamental to the town, and commodious for 
the parilh, was finiflied in 1783. And the manfe was built 
in 1770. The ftipend is 1200 1. Scots, and 50 1. Scots for 
communion elements. The glebe contains 6 acres. The 
Duke of Queenfberry, as Earl of March, is patron. The 
poor have no regular fupport but from the intereft of between 
400 1. and 500 1. Sterling in the management of the kirk fef^ 
fion, the colleaions at the church doors on Sabbath, and the 
fmall fums arifmg from the ufe of the pall and hearfe, amount- 
ing to about 60 1. Sterling yearly : Befides what the magif-

and which they juflly vary as the exigencies of the times re-, 
quire^ As the hurgh is the greateft part of the parifli, the 
magiftrates and council have always appointed fchoolmafters 
for the ufe of the whole parifli ; one for teaching the Gram-, 
mar, another the Englifli fchool, and have provided them with 
proper houfes and falaries. Private fchools alfo have always 
cxifted, and of late have become rivals for fame of education 
with the public ones. All the mafters are able, and all of 
them are emulous, which to make the bell fcholars. A I thefe 
fchools no fewer than 250 children are at prefent educated, 
many of them from different parts of the kingdom, and who^ 
for boarding and clothing, bring into the town annually above 
1000 1. Sterling. Poor children are educated by the kirk-fef- 
fion from the poor's funds, and no part of them is more pro-i 
perly applied. The inftitution of parochial fchools is to the 
honour, as well as the utility,of Scotland. It fliows the wif- 
dom and patriotifm of our anceftors in a high degree. At 
thefe neceffary and ufeful little feminaries of literary and reli- 
gious knowledge, ellablifhed bj law in every parifli, many 
have received the firft principles of literature, who have be- 
come ornaments to their country, and bleffings to mankind. 
What a pity is it, that in a country of increafed, and of year- 
ly increaling opulence and cxpenfe, the falaries of fo ufeful a 
clafs of men are not increafed in proportion ! 

Modern Improvements in Trade and ManufaBure^ %£c. 

Formerly Peebles was fupported chiefly b^ the houfes and 
burgh acres belonging to the burgeflbs, by their merchan- 
dife and their trade, and by the many valuable commontiea 
granted by the kings of Scotland to the burgh for its loyal- 
ty and good fervices. Now, improvements begin to be car- 
ried on upon a larger fcale. Of late years, about fifty houfea 
W been built or thoroughly repaired. Woollen, linen, and

cotton weavers are making greater exertions, and larger houfe^ 
are built for them. The magiftrates have long provided the 
community with excellent flour, barley, corn, and fulling 
mills. Dr. James Hay of Hayftown, befides improving his 
valuable eftate, and letting an example of general improve- 
ment, has built a lint-mill for the accommodation of the 
country. Mr. William Ker of Kerfield, has creeled one of 
the completed breweries and diftilleries, and made a new and 
ufeful improvement in the art of brewing : Perceiving a part 
of the fine effluvia of the hop to fly off during the boiling of 
the worts, he contrived a moft; ingenious and elFedtual method 
of preferving it. He covers his copper with a clofe, but 
moveable top of the fame metal, having a pipe defcending 
from it, and carried through cold water, like the worm of a 
ftill, by which means the fteam is condenfed and conduced 
into a common receiver, where the oil of the hop floating on 
the furface of the vvatery part, is flcimmed oflT, and returned 
into the worts when the boiling is finiflied. By this means a 
third of the hop is faved, and the mofl; aromatic part of it is 
preferved, lo as to give the beer a finer flavour, and keeps it 
from fouring till it is brought to a greater age and excellence. 
He has formed a defign of ereding a woollen manufaflure ac- 
cording to the moft approved plan, which will alfo be of ge- 
neral utility. — By the great increafe of trade and opulence, 
the price of labour of all kinds has increafed one third part 
within thefe twenty years. Men fervants have 61. or 7 1., and 
maid fervants 3 1. Sterling of yearly wages, befides their vic- 
tuals. Common labourers have i s. a-day, without vidtuals, 
and mafons and carpenters is. 6d. All clafles are better edu- 
cated, better lodged, better clothed and fed than in former 
times. It is alfo happy for thofe in the lower, clafles, that

meal for twenty years paft, has not exceeded 9 d., or at tnoft 
10 d. the peck; and it is a received maxifii, that while -a 
labourer can earn a peck of oatnaeal in a day, he will, ia com- 
mon cafes, be able to fupport his family. 

Antiquities and Curiofities. — The ■ Celtae, a numerous and 
powerful people, who fpread over a great part of the north and. 
weft of Europe, and who, as Julius Csefar informs us, were, in 
the neighbouring country, called alfo Galli, were the firft in- 
habitants of Britain, and the Celtic or Gaelic was its firft and 
univerfal language. About the beginning of the Chriftian 
sera, the Romans fubdued and provinciated what of the ifland 
lies Couth of the Forth and the Clyde, and introduced in many 
places the Latin. The Saxons in the 5th, and the Danes in 
the 9th and lith centuries, made invafions and fettlements 
in Britain, and introduced their language. By thefe means» 
and by the great numbers of the Englilh, who, upon the 
Norman conqueft, came into the fouth of Scotland, and had 
lands given them, the Celtic language gradually gave way vx 
this part of the country, to the Roman and the Saxon, of 
which our prefent Englilh language is compofed. Of thefe 
things vettiges ftill remain in this parifti and in the neigh- 
bourhood. At Lyne, four miles weft from Peebles, is a dif- 
tinft Roman Caftra Stativa, 500 feet fquare, with two ditches 
and three ramparts, containing betv/een fix and feven acres. 
Three miles fouth from this camp, and on the other fide of 
the Tweed, is a hill called Cademuir, anciently Cadhmore, fig- 
nifying in Gaelic, " the great fight on the top of which are 
four Britifti camps, one of them much ftronger than the reft, 
Surrounded with ftone walls, without cement,' in fome places 
double, and where fingle, no lefs than five yards in thicknefs ; 
without which, and out of the ruins of which, have been.

creacd near 200 monumental ftones. many of them ftill ftand, 
ing, and others fallen down,~indications that in very early 
times, .vhen the Gaelic was the common language of the 
country, and when the Romans had as yet been the only in- 
vaders of it, a great battle had been fought on that hill, and 
that at the ftrong camp on the top of it, numbers had been 
killed, and were buried. On the extremity of the pariQi to- 
ward the N. W., is a high hill called Melden, properly Mel- 
tein, « the Hill of Fire," from the fires kindled on the top of 
it, anciently in worlhip of the Sun, or afterward to give fignal 
to the furrounding country, when enemies appeared in the 
Frith of Forth ; and round the top of it a large inclofure or 
camp is vlfible. Toward the eaft part of the parilh is a hill 
called Frineti, or properly Daneti or Danes'-brae, with two 
circular camps, of which the higheft has been furrounded 
with a ditch above ten feet in depth. Many other camps are 
to be feen on eminences and on the tops of hills, all over the 
country, veftiges of ancient invafion and danger. In later ages, 
when the ancient fmaller kingdoms in the ifland were formed, 
into the two larger ones of Scotland and England, as the Che- 
viot hills were a natural barrier between them in the middle 
of the country, invafion and war were made by the mouth of 
the Tweed on the E. and of the Solway on the W. ; yet 
fmall parties of the army often penetrated for plunder into 
the interior parts. The predatory difpofition, but too much 
exemplified by the nations, was praftifed all over the coun- 
try, and particularly toward the borders, where troops of 
freebooters made incurfions into this part of the country every 
fummer, for carrying off, under night, horfes, black cattle, 
and 111 eep. In defence againft thefe various depredations, 
llrong caftles were built, by the kings of Scotland, on the 
lower parts of the Tweed, and were continued by the land- 
holders along the higher parts of it, and on the waters which

on each fide fall into it. They were built of ftone and, lime 
prepared in the beft manner, aftid where larger, or fituated. 
nigh the caftra of former times, they were called callles, or 
when fmaller, were called towers. They confided common- 
ly of three ftories, the lower one on the ground floor vaulted, 
into which the horfes and cows were brought in times of dan- 
ger ; the great hail, in which the family lived; and the highcft, 
in which were the bed chambers, defigned for public as well 
as for private fafety. They were, by general confent, built al- 
ternately on both fides the river, and in a continued view one 
of another. A fire kindled on the top of thefe towers was 
the known fign of an incurfion of the enemy. The fmoke 
gave the fignal by day, and the flame in the night ; and ovev 
a track of country of 7omileslong, from Berwick to the Bield, 
and 50 miles broad, intelligence was, in this manner, convey- 
ed in a very few hours. As thefe buildings are not only anti- 
quities, but evidences of the ancient fituation of the country, 
and are now moil of them in ruins, it will not be improper to 
mention thofe along the Tweed for ten miles below Peebles, 
and as many above it. Thus, Elibank tower looks to one at 
Hollowlee, this to one at Scrogbank, this to one at Caberr- 
tone, this to one at Bold, this to one at Purvis hill, this to 
thefe at Innerleithan, Traquair, and Grieftone, this lafl: to

Nether Horfburgh, this to Horfljurgh caftle, this to thefe at

property and chief refulence of the powerful family of the

Sreaf part of the lands from that to Peebles, and fherifFs of 
the county: and fron, whom fpring the families of Lovat and 
Saltoun. in the N. The laft of that family, in the male line, 
1.1 T^veeddale, was the brave Sir Simon Frafer, who in 1303 
along, with Sir John Cummin, with only io,»oo men, repulfed 
and defeated 30.000 Englifii in three battles fought on one 
day on Roflin moor. He left two daughters co-heirelTes to his 
great eftate ; one of whom was married to the anceftor of the 
Marquis of Twceddale, and the other to the anceftor of the 
E.'irl of Wigtou, which families, therefore, quartered the arms 
of the Frafers with their own. And the caftle and large ba- 
rony of Needpath continuing the property of the Titeeddale 
family, and the town of Peebles much under its patroaage,. 
the Frafers arms are to be feen on the crofs to this day. There 
is good evidence, that Peebles and the neighbouring country, 
have been confiderably populous for above a thoufand years, 
and that they have been enlightened with the gofpel from a' 
flill more ancient period ; and that in after ages they received 
from the kings of Scotland, many expreffions of royal re- 
gard and munificence'. The firft teachers of Chriilianity in 
Britain, were called, in the original Gaelic language, Kule 
Dia or Culdees, that is, fervants of God, in dillir.aion to 
the former teachers of heathenifm, the Diuids, and taught 
the religion of the true God and our Saviour in much purity 
and fitnplicity for fnme centuries. When the ambitious biihops 
of Rome, in fucceilion to the emperors, formed their defign 
of univerfal empire, various religious orders were inflituted, 
and various religious houfes were built and endowed, in this, 
as in the other nations in Europe, to increafe the votaries^,

riches, and po\Ver of the Romifti hierarchy. The high church 
of Peebles, dedicated to St. Mary, which, from the remains 
of it in the church yard, was large enough to accommodate 
the parilh at this time, is reckoned to have been built, or ra-: 
ther rebuilt, in the nth century, when the churches were ge- 
nerally rebuilt in a better manner, as from lome very old free- 
Hone rebuilt in its walls, it is evident that it only fucceeded 
to one that was greatly more ancient. To the chaplains o£ 
St. Mary in Peebles, K. David granted the corn and wauk-t 
mills of Innerleithan, with the adjacent lands and very exten- 
five multures. 

On the difcovery of the remains of a human body that had 
been cut in pieces, and buried in a flirine of ftone, and of a 
crofs depofited near it, bearing the name of St. Nicolaus, it 
was believed, that St. Nicolaus of the order of the Culdees, 
and who was reckoned to have fufFered martyrdom about the 
end of the 3d century, when the perfecution of the Chrifti- 
ans under Dioclefian and Maximian raged in Britain, had been 
buried in that place. About the year Z260, Alexander III. 
at the requeft of William then bilhop of Glafgow, to which 
diocefe Peebles belonged, eredled on that fpct a large conven- 
tual church, dedicated to God and the holy crofs, and called 
the Crofs Kirk of Peebles, as an account of its eredtion ob- 
tained in 162), from records in St. John's college, Cam- 
bridge, and in poffeffion of the magiftrates of Peebles, more 
fully bears. It was built in the form of a fquare, with a 
col^rt in the middle, 124 feet by no over all. The church 
formed the fouth fide of the fquare, and was 104 by 26 feet 
within, walls. The front wall wa3 built with a fmall arch 
over the fpot where the crofs aad the remains of the Saint 
were depofited; fo that the religious, whether within or with- 
out the church, might perform their devotions at the facred 
fhrine. The fide walls were 22 feet in height, and the front 

adorned

adorued with 5 large Gothic windows. The other three fid., 
of the fquare formed the convent, of which the fide walls 
were 14 feet high, and x6 feet diftant from each other, and 
the ground floor vaulted. It was of the order of churches 
called Mmiftries, and contained 70 red or Trinity friars, an or- 
der mftituted in honour of the Holy Trinity, and for the re- 
demption of Chriftians who were made flaves by the Turks, 
to which a third part of their yearly income was to be ap- 
plied. Befides other endowments, its royal founder gave 
to the Crofs Kirk, about 50 acres of excellent land lying all 
around it. Friar Thomas its minifter, was chaplain to K. 
Robert IV. who gave to it the lands called the King's Mea- 
dow, juxta Villam de Pehlis, which defcription makes it pro- 
bable that Peebles was not as yet erefted into a burgh royal, 
though the charters granted to it afterward, fhow that it re- 
ceived this honour foon after, either from that prince, or from 
James I. 

A mile and an half below Peebles flood the hofpital of 
St. Leonards, called afterward by corruption, Chappel yards, 
founded for infirm and indigent perfons. In 1427, James I. 
gave this hofpital to his confeffor David Rat, of the order of 
the preachers ; a probable evidence that James lived frequent- 
ly at Peebles, and wrote there his poem, entitled, Peebles to 
the Play, in which he reprefcnts a great annual feftival of 
mufic, divetfions, and feafting, that had long been in ufe to 
be held at Peebles, attended by multitudes from the Forth 
and the Foreft, in their beft apparel. The time of this feftival 
was at Beltein, which, in the Gaelic language, fignifies the 
fire of Bell or Baal, becaufe on the firft day of May, our 
heathen anceftors, by kindling fires and offering facrifices on 
eminences or tops of mountains, held their great anniverfary 
feftival in honour of the fun, whofe benign influences on all 
nature begun tp be ftrongly felt at this time, and men wilhed

more and more to feel as the fummer advanced. The name 
Beltein-day, continued and gave defignation to theBeltein fair 
of Peebles, long after the religion of the countrjj and the 
feftivals of the feafon, were changed. Peebles is only 20 miles 
fouth from Edinburgh, lituated itfelf in a fine fporting coun- 
try, and on the ftraight road to the King's Forcft of Etterick. 
The kings of Scotland made Peebles their ufual fummer re- 
treat, for rural diverfion or the adminiftration of juftice. 
Many of the nobility accompanied them, whofe houfes in 
Peebles ftill bear their names. Extenfive lands all around, af- 
terward granted by royal charter in property or commontj 
to the burgh. Cadmuir, Hornidoun, Venlaw, and Glentorie, 
were the king's property and hunting grounds. The bridge 
over the Tweed feems to have been built at different times, 
and the whole flruflurc to carry evidences of fimilar anti- 
quity, as the Crofs Kirk, and mofl probably was erefted by 
king and fubjeds, as being moft necefTary and convenient for 
both. On the S. E. of Peebles, and other fide of the river, is 
the gallows hill, where criminals were hanged. On the King's 
moor, between that and Peebles, were the ancient tourna- 
ments exhibited. There the county militia, amounting com- 
monly to 300 horfemen, mufler every year at their weapon- 
fliawing in June and Oftober. Their horfe races continued to 
be held at Beltcin, till the middle of the prefent century ; and 
lafl year, when a part of that moor was converted from its 
original to a more improved flate, in a cairn of ftones, was 
found a Roman urn inverted, containing the blade of his 
dagger, and the afhcs of fome ancient hero who had been 
buried there. The town of Peebles originally extended from 
Eddleftone water weflward to the meadovo welljlrand, the crofs 
ftanding oppofite to the Ludgate. It was feveral times plun- 
dered and burnt by the Englilh ; fo that nothing was left ua, 
deftroyed but the churches, the manfe, and the crofs, which

being held facrcd, were commonly fpared. This induced the 
principal inhabitants to build a new town on the E. fide of 
that water, as being a fituation more eafily fortified, and to 
furround it with ftrong walls and gates, which continued till 
the two kingdoms were united. In confideration of thefe 
great lofles, and that the town of Peebles had always been 
diftinguiflied for loyalty, fidelity, and good fervices, not only 
the ufual privileges of royal burghs, but the cxtenfive lands 
already mentioned, and a toll on the bridge of Tweed, were^ 
by royal charters, granted to it at the reformation of religion 
in Scotland in the 15G0, when the needlefs multiplicity of 
churches was aboMhed, and convents were diffolved. The high 
church in the old town was demolifhed, and the crofs church, 
•as being nearer to the new town, was converted into the pa- 
rochial one, and employed in the offices of reformed religion, 
till January 1784, when the new church having been built 
within the town, was opened for religious worfhip by the pre- 
fent incumbent. The cloifler was converted into houfes for 
the fchoolmafters, and public fchools, and was ufed for thefe 
purpofes to the beginning of this century, when it became 
ruinous. In the year 1621, James VI. renewed and confirm- 
ed all the rights, privileges, and lands granted to the burgh 
by his royal predeceflbrs: and whereas a number of churches, 
chapels, and altars had, in times of Popery, been erected and 
endowed by pious perfons, in honour of angels and faints, for 
the purpofe of faying mafs for the fouls of their own friends 
deceafed, all thefe, with their revenues, his Mtijefty granted, 
in all time thereafter, to the magiftrates, counciland communi- 
ty or Peebles, on condition of a fmall annuity to be paid into 
the Exchequer, and their offering their daily convent prayers to 
Almighty God for his Majefty and his fucceflbrs. In times of 
Epifcopacy, the minilter of Peebles was Archdcan of Glaf- 
gow, parfon of Peebles and Mannor, and bad the parfqnage-

titiies of both pariflies, then worth 6000 merks yearly. The 
vicar in Peebles had the glebe of 80 acres, ftill called the Kirk- 
lands, though at the Reformation very little of thefe lands 
were left to the church, together with the vicarage-tithes, 
part of which is given by the patron of the parifh to the maf- 
ter of the grimmar-fchool. At the Reformation, and after- 
ward, when the lands and revenues of the chiirch were dif- 
pofed of to other purpofes, it would have been wifer to have 
referved a proper portion of thefe lands for the conllant fup- 
port of the parochial clergy, a fmaller part of it to be occii-* 
pied by themfelvea, and the reft to be let by them for their 
ufe. This would have been a better provifion for the efta- 
blilhed clergy, than either the ijjfa corpora tithes, which are 
often a check to agricultural improvements, and a bone of 
contention between the paftor and people, or ftipends modified 
out of thefe tithes, which decreafe in value as the expenfe o£ 
living inereafes. The fmall legal glebe of 4 acres of arable 
land, when ploughed by the parifhioners, as was formerly the 
cafe, might be fome advantage to the minifter. Now, whea 
he muft keep two horfes and a fervant to cultivate it, it is a 
lofs, in place of a gain. Whereas, if every minifter in the 
Church of Scotland, having a country parifh, had been pro- 
vided in a glebe of 20 or 30 acres, he would, without either 
lofs to himfelf, or avocation from the facred duties of his of- 
fice, have directed the proper culture of it, and generally 
would have fet an example of improvement in every parifli, 
which would have been followed, and proVed of great and ge« 
heral advantage to the country.

<p>
Nan^Bf Extent^ 

npHE name of this parifh is faid to be derived from the 
Gaelic language, and fignifies " a plain fituated be- 
" tween two rivers." If this be fo, it is perfeftly defcrip- 
tive of the fituation of the village, which ftands on a narrow 
ftrip of land between two rivers, both known by the name of 
Efk, the banks of which are beautifully wooded, and embel- 
lifhed with the feats of feveifal families of the firft diftinaion. 
The extent of the parifli i^ very- moderate, as it nowhere ex- 
ceeds a miles, . either in breadth or length. The foil is vari- 
ous, but, in general, the lower grounds are light, and inclin- 
ing to fand, and the higher, of a pretty deep clay. The whole 
of the parifti is arable, except a little on the banks of the ri- 
vers, which, for the moft part, are fleep,. and beautifully frin-

ged with wood. The foil produces every kind of grain, and 
is well adapted for raifing every Ipecies of forefl. trees, which 
arrive here at great perfedion. There are no mountains nor 
hills in the parifh : indeed almoft the whole of it might be 
confidered as a plain, did not the fteep banks of the rivers give 
it, in fome places, an uneven and broken appearance. 

Farms, and Rent of Land. — The farms are few in number, 
and neither large nor extenfive. This is owing to a multi- 
plicity of portioners, who either farm their own land, or let 
it out to gardeners, who pay a high rent for it. Agriculture 
is well underftood, not only in th; parifh, but in the whole 
country around, and has attained a high decree of perfection. 
Materials for the improving of land are at no great diftance, 
as lime may be procured in abundance in the neighbourhood, 
and the village affords a confiderable quantity of excellent ma*, 
nure. The rent of land here is, in general, high. Meadow, 
or pailure ground, whe^i inclofed, lets at from 3 1. to 5 1. the 
Scotch acre, accorxiing to its quality or vicinity to the village, 
Thofe farms which lie in the remoteft parts of the parilh, are 
let, fome of them at 1 1*, fome at 1 1. 15 s., and others at 2 1. 
the acre, in proportion to the quality of the foil. Land that 
has been under the plough, is, at prefent, picked up with a- 
vidity by gardeners, and brings fronl 3 1. 3 s, to 5 1. 10 s. 
yearly, according as the leafe granted happens to be of a long- 
er or fliorter duration. When tliere is any land in the mar- 
ket here, it fells at from 50 1. to 100 1. the acre, in propor- 
tion to its quality or local fituation with refpeft to the vil- 
lage. The parifli contains a confidei-able quantity of coal, but 
as it lies fo deep in the earth, that it cannot, in general, be 
come at with advantage to the proprietors, without the help 
of fire engines, there is little of it wrought at prefent. The 
inhabitants, however, fuffer no ihconvenience from this cir-

cumftance, as they are plentifully fupplied from a variety of 
coal-p.ts, with which the pariHi is furrounded. The ordina. 
ry price of this neceflary article, is from 2jd. to s^^d. the 
cwt. according to its quality; but during the courfe of laft 
winter, it was much higher, on account of an univerfal fcar- 
cxty, and an additional rife of price at the pits. 

Markets — With refped to markets, the parifli is very 
ponveniently fituated. One of the moft confiderable, perhaps 
the greateft market for grain of any in Scotland, is held in 
3Dalkeith every Thurfday, to which is brought, a very great 
quantity of oats (in particular) from all the neighbourhood, 
and efpecially from tlje fouth country. It is remarkable, that 
all the graiTi fold here brings ready money; a circumftance of 
much importance to the farmers, who generally purchafe here, 
fuch articles as they find neceffary for themfelves and their 
families, before they leave the town. A great proportion of 
the grain and meal fold at Dalkeith, goes to the fupply of the 
■weft country, about Carron, Glafgow, and Paifley. From 
Martinmas till about Whitfunday, there is likewife a market 
for meal, every Monday, and one for cattle, every Tuefday. 
We have alfo an annual fair held on the third Tuefday of 
'Odober for horfes and black cattle, &amp;c. This fair, it is faid, 
was formerly qf much more confequenc^, and better attended 
than it is at prefent ^. 

Population. 

* FrUes and fVages.—rThe village is abundantly fupplied with excellent but- 
(cher meat, which may be had in great perfeftion on the Thurfdays, and Satur- 
days. The butchers here contribute confiderably to the fuppJy of the Edinburgh 
market, and fome of them fell there the whole of what they kill. During the 
feafon of ywnter and fpring, the price of beef is ^d. the lb. avoirdupois, veal 5d., 
mutton 5d., and pork ^d. From the month of September till about the middl? 
of January, the price of beef and rnutton, is 3d. or 3 f d. the pound, but during 
fhe reft of the year, it is not lower than what has been mentioned above. In the

dergone, have coft as much as would have been fufficient to- 
build an excellent new houfe on a more defirable fituation. 
The ftipend is 95 1. ; but there is a profpeft of its being foon 
augmented, as the patron, with his ufual public fpirit, has 
generoufly propofcd it, though the whole burden of the aug-. 
mentation falls on himfelf. The glebe is about 6 acres, all 
arable, and from its vicinity to the village, is, on that ac- 
count, the more valuable. — As the parifti is populous, fo the 
poor are proportionably numerous. A good many of them 
receive a weekly allowance from the kirk-funds, of which 
the kifk-feffion has the management. Thofe who receive fup- 
ply in this manner, may, at an average, be about 16 or 18 
in the fummer feafon ; but in winter, their number is com- 
monly greater, as at that time of the year, fuch of them 33 
have health and ability to labour a little in the fields, find no 
employment. Befides the money arifing from the weeklj 
colledtions at the church doors, which, at an average, is about 
15 s. or i6s. a-week, the kirk-feliion has the management 
of the rents of a few acres of land, and fome fmall feu-duties 
belonging to the poor, the amount of which is about 30 1. 
Sterling a-year. To this' may be added, the money arif-

about 23 or 24, but fometimes there are 40 and upwards. 
To fupport thefe poor, the kirk-feffion pays annuall7, the

by the inhabitants produces about 45 1. yearly. There is a

ters, it ought to be obferved, that their attention, humanity, 
and liberality to the poor of this place, have, at no time, 
been wanting. The charity of the family of Buccleugh, in 
particular, is worthy of the higheft rank and moft opulent 
fortune — The grammar fchool here has long been in high 
repute, and at one period was confidered as the firft in the 
kingdom. It has produced fome of the greateft geniufes, and

of caules, which it is unneceflary to enumerate ; but the me- 
rit and abilities of the late and prefent reftors, have done 
much to reftore it to its former reputation. The teaching 
room is large, pleafant, well aired, and inferior to none pr 
this fide of the Tweed, in point of convenience and accom- 
modation. A confiderable number of young gentlemen are

burghers ; and the Metbodifts are inferior to them all in point 
of numbers. There is likewife one family of Cameronians, 
and another of Anabaptifts. Notwithftanding this great di- 
verfity of opinions, which prevails among the inhabitants in 
matters of religion, they live together, at leaft as far as is 
known to the writer of this account, in the practice of that 
charity, meeknefs, and moderation, which the Chriftian reli- 
gion requires of all its profeffors. There may, no doubt, be

Situation, Extent, Surface, Climate, \§c. 

'^HIS is one of the fmalleft pariOies in this part of Scot- 
land, and affords but little fcope for ftatiftical obfer- 
vati'on. The parifh of Libberton bounds it on the E., thofe 
of Carnwath and Carftairs on the N., and that of Lanark on 
the N. W. Thefe parities are fituated on the oppofite fide of 
the river Clyde, excepting a fmall part of the haugh ground 
belonging to Libberton. Upwards of fixtj acres belonging to 
Pettinain are likewife, at different places, thrown on the other 
fide of the river. The frequent changes of its courfe has, moft 
probably, been the caufe of this inconvenient fituation. Its 
figure is irregular, but may be confidered as a reftangle, near- 
ly 3 miles long, and 2 broad About 1700 acres are, in their 

courfe.

courfe, employed in tillage : the remaining part, which may 
be nearly of the fame extent, is either coarfe pafture-ground 
and raofs, or is covered with plantations of trees. The church 
and village are fituated towards the N. E. extremity of the 
parilh, about half a mile from the neareft part of the river ; 

miles to the eaftward of Lanark, and 7 miles to the north- 
weftward of Biggar. There is only one hill in the parifli 
that divides itfelf into two fummits, which are fometimes 
diftinguilhed by the names of Pettinain and Wed raw hills. 
The laft, and moft wefterly of thefe is the higheft, and rifes 
about 5CC feet above the level of Clyde, and about 1000 feet 
above that of the fea. The other part of the hill extends it- 
felf, in a long bending ridge, towards the S., and runs into 
the neighbouring parifti of Covington. Thefe high grounds 
are moftly covered with ftiort heath, intermixed, in feveral 
places, with bent, and other coarfe grafs. This gives them a 
bleak appearance, and renders them, comparatively, of fmall 
value. A large track of moorifla and mofly ground lies im- 
mediately behind the hill, on the S. ; and in fuch a high fitu- 
ation, that it would not be advifable to attempt to cultivate 
any part of it. The reft of the lands in the parijfli, which lie 
lower, are generally of much better quality, and more agree- 
able appearance. The haughs, or holms, belonging to this 
and the neighbouring pariflies on the oppofite fide of the river, 
are very extenfive ; and are clad in beautiful verdure during 
the fummer months. The Clyde, which has formed thefe 
haughs, by depofiting its mud, and which, by its frequent in- 
undations, annually enriches them, adds greatly to their beau- 
ty, by its various windings. The grounds, interpofed be- 
tween thefe haughs and the hill, are finely diverfified by beau- 
tiful fwells. The extenfive plantations of Weftraw, and the 
hedges, which feparate or fubdivide the farms, give a plea- 
fing look of cultivation to t^his part of the parifli. The weft

and fouth parts are likewife much beautified by f^rall planta* 
tions at Wettown nnd Clowburo, and by the hedges and other 
fences, which enclofe a great proportion of the low grounds. 
Part of the enclofures belonging to Carmichael, one of the 
feats of the Earl of Hyndford, falls within the boundary of 
this parifh on the S. W. and greatly improves its appearance 
m that quarter. Frona the height of the ground, the air muft 
be cold and penetrating. The river, where it runs flowly, is 
frequently frozen over for feveral weeks together, in a fevere 
winter. The froft is, probably, rendered more intenfe by the 
luoorifti and wet lands, which lie around the flcirts of the hill, 
as well as by the river itfelf. In the year Z782 and 1^84,' 
the crop was greatly damaged by it. 

Riuer, Fijh, ^ifc.— The Clyde, which rifes about 25 miles 
to the fouthward, is here fwelled into a large river. Along 
the upper part of the haugh-grounds, it runs with a pretty 
rapid current; but, about 2 miles below, its motion becomes 
much flower, and its depth increafes. For feveral miles down- 
wards, except in a few places, it continues very deep, and 
makes many beautiful windings through the haughs. About 
half a mile before it leaves the parifli, it ruflies with an im- 
petuous torrent over the rocks which lie in its bed. In the 
upper part of this courfe, there are feveral good fords ; but 
they are often rendered impalTable, efpecially in winter, by 
the heavy rains, or melting of fnow. In fuch cafes, the com- 
munication to the eaftward is by the bridge at Thankerton, 
in the parifli of Covington, which is at the difl:ance of i\ 
miles from the village of Pettinain. This very ufeful bridge 
was built about 14 years ago, by voluntary fubfcription, and 
cofl: upwards of 700 1. The country, on this account, i» 
much indebted to the public-fpirited exertions of the clergy- 
man who was then minifter of thit parifli, and of fome of

the neighbouring farmers. Hyndford bridge, which is placed 
about the fame diftance wcftward^ opens a rr?idy paifage to 
Lanark, and other places in that quarter. The inundations 
of Clyde, though, in general, they undoubtedly fertilize the 
adjoining haughs, are hurtful at particular feafons. In the 
fpring, the ploughed ground is, fometirnes, fo much v/aflied 
and fmoothed, that the feed cannot be fufficiently covered ; in 
feme places, where the current is ftrong, the foil is fwept 
?way ; the feed is frequently difplaced, and laid in the fur- 
Xovss. The fummer floods, by covering the pafture-grafs 
with fand or mud, make it unfit for the cattle, till it be walk- 
ed by the rains. But the greateft damage is fuftained when 
the corns are in the fhort-blade, immediately after the ear be- 
gins to make its appearance. A high flood, at that time, de- 
llroys, in a great meafure, the crop. The farmers are care- 
ful to prevent the lofs that might be occafioned from inunda.- 
tions in harveft, by removing the corns, as they are cut down, 
to higher grounds. Trout of a large fize, and deliqate tafte, 
abound in this part of the Clyde. They are often caught 
about 20, and fometirnes even 30 inches long. The red co- 
loured are preferred to the white. Tlie deepefl: places of the 
river produce, likewife, pike and perch. The beft feafon for 
catching large trout with the rod, is reckoned to be from the 
middle to the end of June. 

Soil, Agriculture, Produce, l^c — -The lands in the parilh 
are very different in quality. A confiderable part of them is 
moorifli and fpongy on the furface ; and as this kind of foil 
readily imbibes the rain, fo, when it lies upon a clayey till, 
which, in many places, is the cafe here, it retains it long, 
and continues wet through a great part of the year. The 
grounds which form the floping fides of the hill, are mollly 
of this fort ; and cannot be cultivated by the plough to any

confiderable advantage. Some parts of them, however, are 
more clayey, and yield pretty good crops : Other parts, which 
have a gravelly bottom, are dry and light ; and though they 
do "not give very plentiful returns, are more to be depended 
on than the wet lands. But the greater part of the arable 
ground, which lies towards the river, is of a dry and good 
foil. Near the village it is a rich loam, inclining, in fome 
places, to clay. Towards the N. E., it becomes light and 
fandy. In the weft end of the parifli, it is partly fandy, and 
partly clayey ; and, in the Clowburn lands, it is, in fome 
places, gravelly and fharp, in others, foft and mixed with 
clay or mofs. The bottom of thefe arable grounds is van- 
ous ; fand, clayey till, or gravel. . By proper management 
they may all be made to produce good crops. The foil of 
the haughs or holms is a mud which the river has brought 
down from the higheft parts of the country. In general, it 
appears to have a confiderable proportion of clay in its com- 
pofition, from its adhefive quality when it is moiftened by 
rain or the overflowing of the river. The depth of this mud 
is various, from 2 to 7 or 8 feet. Below it, there is gene- 
rally found fuch a ftratum of gravel and fmall ftones, as lie? 
in the fords. This ftratum may, perhaps, ferve the purpofe 
of a drain to the haughs, which are generally dry. A fm- 
gular faft feems to fupport this conjefture. A large haugh, 
tov^ards the weft end of the parifti, is not fo dry as the other 
grounds of this kind, nor do the crops ripen fo foon upon it 
as upon them. The foil of that haugh is not depofited upon 
a ftratum of gravel, but of mofs, which probably imbibes 
the water of the river, and communicates an uncommon de- 
gree of moifture to the fuperincumbent mud. 

The mode of farming is not very different from what it 
was 20 or 30 years ago. Men are naturally attached to old 
puftoms 5 and it requires fome time, and repeated obferva-

tice of thofe of his neighbours who turn ^^-r ands ^et^ 
account; and he learns, by experience, to foUow that plan 
which is beft fuited to the foil and climate of hxs own grounds 
There are feveral very judicious farmers ia to panfh and 
its neighbourhood, who have introduced many fubilantial im- 
provements, and whofe example will have its proper mfluence 
upop others. It is ftill, however, the pradice with many to 
lay all their dung upon the croft-land, except what the out- 
field may receive by folding, or in the courfe of pafture ; to 
take croDS of oats, and i of barley (or beer) * from the 
•former, and 3 or 4 crops of oats running from the latter ; 
and to lay out their ground without fowing any grafs-feeds. 
Too little attention, likewife, is paid to the killing of quick- 
grafs and other noxious weeds. A great part of the lands 
here is well adapted to the culture of turnip and potatoes. 
This has been carried on, for fome years, to a fmall extent ; 
and the good efFefts of it, in cleaning the ground, .and pre- 
paring it for barley and grafs-feeds, ought to render it more 
prevalent. The turnip are employed in feeding milch-cows, 
once^ or, at moft, twice a-day, upon the fading of the paf- 
ture grafs after harveft. When given oftener, they impart a 
difagreeable tafte to the milk and butter : but this may be, 
in a great meafure, prevented, by mixing with the milk, 
when it is put warm into the veffels, a fmall quantity of falt- 
petre diffolved in water. They are, likewife, very ufefully 
employed in rearing young black cattle, and in fattening for

tl^e butcher ; but fo fmall a quantity has hitherto been raifed 
iiere, that little attention has been paid to the laft of thefe 
objeas, though, in other places, it has juftlj been reckoned 
a verj important one. The potatoes are either confumed at 
home, or fent to Lanark, where they bring from 5 s. to 6s. 
the boll. They are found to be an excellent food both for 
horfes and black cattle. Formerly they were almoft univer, 
fally planted with the foot-dibble ; but this work is now ge- 
nerally done with the plough, in the drill-way. The haugh- 
ground is generally ploughed 3, and fometimes 4 years, for 
oats, and then allowed to lie as long in natural grafs. UfuaL 
ly it gets no other manure but what it receives from the cat- 
tle in pafturing, or from the mud or flime, which is left upon 
it by the inundations of the river. Some very fuccefsful ex- 
periments were lately made by manuring a part of it with 
dung and lime. The crops were greatly improved by this 
new treatment. Excellent wheat and barley have been raifed 
upon it. Peafe are reckoned a precarious crop, in this part 
of the country ; yet they are fometimes fown, with advan- 
tage, upon fliarp and clayey grounds. Beans are feldom plant- 
ed, and only in particular fpots of rich clayey land. Flax 
thrives well in many places of the parifh. It is common to 
have 4, and even 5 ftones of fcutched lint from a peck, It 
is not, however, of fuch a fine quality as in the lower parts 
pf the county ; and it is juftly reckoned a fevere crop. Se- 
veral ploughs, made after the model of Mr. Small's, and 
drawn by 2 horfes, are now ufed here. They are found to 
))e well adapted to the foil of the haughs, and to all ground 
that is free of ftones. In coarfe and ftony land, the common 
plough is found to anfwer better. The number of farms may 
be reckoned 16, befides fmail poffeflions : but one of thefe is 
tented by a farmer who lives in a neighbouring parifh ; and 
another was lately thrown into grafs. The principal crops

are oats, barlej of beer, and potatoes. Of oats, the beft croft 
land may be reckoned to yield from 8 to la bolls (Linlithgow

bolls ; and the other outfield ground from 2 to 4. An acre 
of barley (what is here called beer) gives from 8 to 13 bolls, 
of land that has been properly cleared of weeds, and other- 
wife prepared; of the foul land, from 6 to 9 bolls. From 
40 to 80 bolls of potataes, planted generally without dung 
upon the croft-land, is reckoned a good return from the acre. 
The produce of an acre of peafe varies from a to 8 bolls. 
Wheat has been tried with fomc advantage, in a favourable 
feafon ; but the fituation of the ground feems to be too high, 
and the frofts too fevere, to allow its being cultivated to any 
great extent. The fowing of grafs-feeds has increafed of 
late ; and the good crops of hay that have been produced, give 
reafon to hope that a ftill greater proportion of land will be 
employed in this manner. Two crops of hay have generally- 
been taken from the fmall fields that were laid down with 
fown grafs, after which they were paftured for 2 or 3 years ; 
But a fpecies of rye-grafs has lately got into the country, 
which continues only for i year, and which often difconcerts. 
this plan. Many of the farms here are remarkable for pro- 
ducing good butter and cheefe ; and perhaps there is not a 
greater quantity produced from the fame extent of ground in 
any place of this country. The pafture on the haughs is un- 
doubtedly very rich : and much attention is paid both to the 
breed of the cows, and management of their milk. 

The! horfes are of a large fize, and very fit for draught. A 
few are annually fold, at good prices. The number of work- 
horfes may be reckoned about 90 ; and of young horfes 44. 
That of the black cattle, of all ages, 366 ; and that of flieep 
about 450. Thefe numbers may vary a little occafxonally.

Population The return to Dr. Webfter in 1755, was 330. 

There is reafon to think that the number of inhabitants has 
decreafed fmce the beginning of the current century. It ap- 
pears, from an old regifter, that the average number of bap- 
tifms in a year was then ii^-. About 30 years ago it was 9 : 
and, for 12 years paft, it has been nearly %l. The account 
which the oldeft perfons give of the ftate of the parifti in their 
youth, fupports this conjefture. The farms, by being in- 
creafed in fize, have decreafed in number ; and many cotta- 
ges have been demoliflied. In 1780, when an exad lift was 
taken, the total number was 409 : At the prefent time (May 
1-^92), it is only 386. Of this number of perfons there are,

* Price of Labour, W^.-The wages of fervants and day-labourers have 
rifen confiderably of late, from the great encouragement that has been giveu 
at the iron-foundery in the neighboviring parifh of Camwath, at the cotton- 
„anufaaure near Lanark, and other great works. For particulars, fee the ac- 
count of the neighbouring parifh of Libberton. The demolifhing of the cot- 
taees may juftly be reckoned one great caufe ef the increafed price of labour,

whilft, from other cauf.s, the demand for them has become greater.

tains 26 families, and 110 perfons, it is about 4^ : In the 
country parifh, which includes 276 perfons, who refide in 51 
feparate houfes, it is nearly 5-. This difference arifes from 
the numerous families of fome of the farmers, who live in 
the country part of the pariOi. The number of married per- 
fons is 84 ; that of widowers and widows 18. 

The great part of the people are employed in farming, or 
in occupations relative to it. At prefent, the number of pro- 
fefled farmers, or of fuch as may be faid to live by this bufil 
nefs, is only 14 ; and of thefe fome poffefs but fmall farms. 
The fervants which they ufually employ, are about 60. But 
befides thefe, there is a confiderable number of perfons who 
have fmall poffeffions of land, and who foUo-^^, at the fame 
time, fome other employment. There are, iikewife, a few 
tradefmen, fuch as are ufually employed in the country; 
Wrights, mafons, weavers, and ftioemakers. Of thefe the 
weavers are the moft numerous, amounting, with journey- 
men and apprentices, to ii or 12. Some of them are em- 
ployed in the cotton manufafture, and ufe the fly-fliuttle. 
The inhabitants are generally healthy; and many attain to a 
great age. Very lately there were 5, and Hill there are 4 per- 
fons above So years ; 2 of them near to 87. A fewyears ago, 
a man died about the age of 9^, who had been bred a mafon, 
and had refided in this parifti till afhort time before his death. 
He was fo flout and healthy, at the age of 86, that he was 
able to work, for fome time, at his particular occupation. 
The health and longevity of the people may be owing, iu 
fome degree, to their being much employed in the open air. 
Stomach complaints, however, rheumatifm, and confumptions, 
are not unfrequent ; aud the fmall-pox and meafles carry off 
a number of the young. Inoculation for the fmall-pox has 
not yet become general, though it has been very fuccefsful 
wherever it was tried. The. houfes in the village, and over

great part of the parifli, are generally pretty neat and com- 
modious. This muft contribute to the health, as well as to 
the comfort of the inhabitants. 

Poor — The number of poor has been very fmall, for feve- 
ral years paft. This has been owing, among other caufes, 
to the care taken by the kirk-feflion to give a little aid be- 
times, to thofe that were likely to fall into neceflitous cir- 
cumftances; and thus, to prevent their coming upon the poor's 
lift. It is too often found that many of thofe, who are accuf- 
tomed to a regular fupply, become idle and improvident. By 
lofing their fenfe of independence, they lofe regard to cha- 
rafter. The manner of fupporting the poor, in this part of 
Great Britain, though it be well calculated to check thefe 
evils, cannot altogether prevent them. Wheit a fmall aflift- 
ance, feafonably adminiftered, will enable a poor man to con- 
tinue his occupation, and to earn his bread for many years 
it is certainly much better to afford it, than, by allowing him 
to fink into extreme poverty and wretchednefs, to be obliged 
to admit him as a conftant penfioner. The price of meal was 
fo much raifed in confequence of the great frofl in harveft 
1782, that it was thought neceffary to give fome temporary 
affiftance \o a number of the poorer clafs of people in this 
parifli. Meal, and beef (which was then cheaper than meal) 
were fold to them confiderably below the market price, till, 
by the next plentiful harveft, provifions were brought down 
to their ordinary rate. The fame plan, to a fmaller extent, 
was adopted in the end of 1 784, another hard year : and, by 
thefe means, the diftrefs, in which feveral induftrious perfons 
muft have been involved, was prevented. The annual intereft 
of 40 1. of ftock, together with the ordinary colledions, mort- 
cloth-money, &amp;:c. has hitherto been fufficient for the fupport 
of the poor.

been built towards the end of the lafl century. The date 1698^ 
is found on the bell-houfe. The ftipend confifts of 80 bolls 
of meal, 21 of bear, and 7 1. money. The Earl of Hyndford 
is patron. The glebe contains about 8 acres, part of which 
is very good land. The manfe was built in 1711 ; but has 
been repaired at different times— There is a good houfe for 
the fchool and fchoolmafter, and a fmall garden. His falary, 
including the annual produce of^ mortification, is 9I. lis. 8d. 

The number of fcholars is about 30 There are only three 

heritors, none of whom refide in the parifti. 1 he far greater 
part of the lands belongs to the Earl of Hyndford. 

Antiquities — In the confines of the parifli on the S., and 
on the high moorifii ground formerly mentioned, the veftiges 
of a large camp, or fortified ftation, are ftill x^xy vifible. It 
contains about 6 acres, which form an irregular figure, ap- 
proaching to that of a circular area. The wall feems to have 
been very thick and high, and to have been compofed chiefly 
of coarfe ftones, many of them a kind of flag, coUefted, pro- 
bably, from the adjoining grounds ; but there is no appear- 
ance of mortar or cement. It is fituatcd upon the fide of a 
deep mofs, within which, at a little diftance, are the remains 
of a fmaU fort, fcarcely including a rood of ground, which has 
evidently been connefted with the large one by a pafl^age 
made through the mofs. The figure of this fmall fortification 
is likewife round, and the wall of it has been built with the 
fame kind of ftones. The large camp includes feveral fprings 
of excellent water. Some urns were found, under the ruins 
ofthexvall, a great many years ago, by fome people that 
were digging out the larger ftones, for the purpofe of build- 
ing. They were each of them enclofed within four coarfe 
flag ftones, fet on edge, and covered with one laid flat. The 

fpace 



Slatijllcal AccLunt 

fpace incluclcd by tliefc (lags was filled to a confiderable depth, 
with a fine whitifli fand, among which the urn was {landing 
in an inverted pofition. Upon removing the urn, fomething 
of a foft flimj nature was found upon the fand, which, pro- 
bably, might be the afhes of human bones. A large urn, 
furrounded with five fmall ones, was found in the bottom of 
• a cairn of ftones about a quarter of a mile dlflant, and enclofed 
in a fimllar manner. This large camp has two fmaller ones 
in its view ; one of them to the north weftv/ard, upon the 
highefl top of the hill, and th;: other to the fouth eaftward, on 
the top of a little hiil in Covington parifb, each about the 
dlftance of half a mile. The firft of thefe appears to have 
been furrounded with two walls, between which there has 
been a deep ditch. The waUs have been built of large rough 
ftones, fuch as are found upon the hill. A vaft number of 
them ftill remain upon the place. This fortification has like.^ 
tvife been of a roundilh figure.. 

On the top of a little rifxng ground, about half a mile W. 
from the village, there h-s flood one of thofe long ftones 
which are known by the name of CrolTes. It ftill lies near 
the place, and a focket of ftone remains, in which it is faid 
to have been fixed. From this place, which is conncaed 
u-ith the plantations of Weftraw, there is a delightful view of 
the houfe and enclofures of Carftairs, yn the oppofi.te fide of 
the river. 

The houfe of Weftraw, or Wefterhall, (as it is fometimes 
fpelt in old writings), is probably ancient ; but.it has under- 
gone fo many alterations, that it has loft, in a great meafure, 
the appearance of antiquity. The lands of Wefterhall were 
giv,en to Sir Adam Johnfton of that ilk, in the time of James 
11. King of Scotland, in reward of his loyalty, and, in partir 
cular, for his aaivity in fuppreffing the rebellion of the Earl 
of Douglas. (Vide" Crawford's Peerage.) It is probablp 
• that

that when thefe lands in Lanarkfhire were alienated, the fame 
name was beftowed upon a part of the ellate in Annandale, 
in order to keep up the memory of this event. Ihe prefent 
Sir James Johnfton of Wefterhall is a defcendant of this fa- 
mily. There have been feveral other old houfes of fome note 
in the parifli, of which fome are in ruins, and others entirely 
demoliftied. One of thefe was at Clowburn, in which the firft 
tea ufed in this country is faid to have been drunk towards 
the end of laft century. It had been brought from Holland, 
according to the tradition, by Sir Andrew Kennedy, who was.- 
then proprietor of that part of the pariijb ; and who, being 
Lord Confervator of the Scots Privileges at Campvere, had 
received it as a prcfent from the Dutch Eaft India Company. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations — The cuftom of thirlage to mills 
ftill prevails in this part of the country : but there is fome- 
thing lingular in the ftate of this parifli in that refpeft. A 
few only of the farms are thirled (or bound to grind corn) at 
the mill within the parifh ; the great part are thirled to that 
of Carmichael. It is but a little more diftant than the other, 
and the multure is only one half.— A confiderable quantity of 
meal, as well as of butter and cheefe, is ufuaUy fent to mar- 
ket from this parifli. Formerly it was the praftice to fend 
the meal to Carluke, or farther, in its way to Glafgow. Of 
late a great part of it has been fold at Lanark, where the de- 
mand was much increafed fince the eredion of Mr. Dale's 
cotton-works — The moorifli and high grounds in the parifh 
might be rendered of greater value, and the country much 
beautified, by large clumps and belts of plantations. The great 
rife in the price of wood is another motive to this improve- 
ment. Within the laft 40 years, the price of hard wood has 
been doubled, and that of fir quadrupled. The large fize, and 
thriving ftate of the larches at Weftraw. feem to recommend

this kind of trees in. particular — ^The fuel generally ufcd in 
the parifli is coal, and a few peats, which are brought from 
the other fide of the river. The coal is moftly brought from 
Ponfeigh, which is near 7 miles diftant from the village. 
The roads have been greatly mended within the laft 20 years ; 
but the materials are generally foft, which- renders frequent 
repairs neceffary. Some of the crofs roads are very bad. 
The ftatute-labour is converted into money, and amounts to 
about I a 1. a-year. This fum, judicioufly laid out, will foon 
accommodate the parifti better in this important refped. The 
people, upon the whole, may be faid to live comfortably in 
their fituation. They are induftrious and fober, and, in ge- 
neral, pay a commendable regard to religious inftitutiong. 
There has only been one or two feceders in the parifli for ma- 
ny years paft.' There are 3 ale-houfes, T«^hich are fo little 
frequented, that the induftry, or morals of the people, do not 
appear to be, in any confiderable degree, hurt by them. Np

THIS parifli is the largeft of any in this country, but not 
of the greateft value, as It includes a common moor, 
which contains above 600. Englifli acres, of a very poor qua^ 
lity. There is no map of this parifh. In fome parts, it is 
between 6 and 7 miles in length, and as much in breadth, 
and is of a very irregular figure. The appearance of this pa- 
rifli is rather flat, there being no high hills in it, but a great , 
proportion of rifing grounds, of eafy afcent, and gentle declivi- 
ty, which are, with a few exceptions, all acceffible by the 
plough, and which, as well as the valleys and plain ground, 
are of a fertile foil, excepting the height^ about St. Abb's

ell part of that moor itfclf, which, in its natural ftate, produ-

coarfeft fort of grafs on the fwampy wettifli parts. This 
great common was, about 20 years ago, divided by the Court 
of Seflion among the heritors having intereft therein, after 
much litigation, and at the expenfe of 1500 1. and upwards j 
confiderable improvements, by enclofing, draining, and lim- 
ing, have been made thereon, by feveral of the heritors. But 
it is believed few of them will find thofe improvements turn 
Out to their advantage, as the foil, is, in moft parts, thin, mar- 
Ihy, and of the molTy kind, and the bottom of a tough, cold 
bluifii clay. The general opinion feems^o be, that the beft 
ufe that it can be turned to, is by planting it. There are fe- 
veral peat mofies in this extenfive moor ; but few of the peats 
are of the black hard kind : they are generally of a brownifli 
colour, foft and porous, and burn away in a blaze, are fitter 
for kindling than lafting fires, and as fuch they are now com- 
monly ufed. The mofles themfelves being much worn out, 
the digging and drying the peats has become more difficdt^- 
and cxpenfive, and they are now, from different caufes, in a 
good meafure, deferted, although peats and turfs were the 
principal fuel ufed in this parilh from tht earlieft times ; and 
this accounts for the barrennefs and fterility of the moor, as 
the furface muft have been repeatedly paired and carried off 
by the inhabitants, in the courfe of many ages.

arc plenty of ti;out3 of excellent quality, generally fmall : 
there ai-e indeed fome pretty large, from 16 to 24 inches in 
length, but none of the true falmon kind. There is alfo a 
beautiful lake of water, about a mile weft of St. Abb's Head, 
called Coldineham Loch. It is of a triangular figure, about 
a mile in circumference, and faid to be feveral fathoms deep 
in fome parts : the water is clear, and muft be produced from 
fprings, as there are no burns that run into it, and althougli 
it has no vifible outlet, the depth always appears to be the 
fame. The only fifa in it, are the perch from 5 to 8 inches 
long, compad and firm in appearance, but dry eating. Thia 
lake appears to be well'fuited for a pleafure-boat, but there 
is none on it at prefent. It is fituated many fathoms above 
the level of the fea. The extent of the fea-coaft, in this pa- 
rifli, is about 6 miles from Eyemouth parifh to that of Cock- 
burnfpath, and upon this part of the coaft, the promontory 
of St. Abb's Head is fituated, about which, and on the wefi:- 
ward of it, the fhore is dangerous and inacceffible, except at 
Lumfden fhore, at which there are feveral fiihing boats, 
and, on the eaftv/ard of St. Abb's Head, a confiderable part 
of the fhore is fmooth and of eafy accefs, particularly at Cold- 
ingham fands, and the farm of Northfield, where there are 
alfo feveral fiihiag boats : but there is no harbour for fhips in 
this parifii ; the only harbour in Berwickihire being at Eye- 
mouth, the befl and mo ft accefTible of any between Holy 
Ifland and Leith. There is a fine bay between St. Abb's 
Head and the fort of Eyemouth, in which fhips bound for 
Eyemouth call anchor and wait the time of tide for goiut^ 
into the harbour. Great plenty of filh are caught in the fea, 
on this part of the coafl, fuch as haddocks, whitings, cod, 
and ling; lobfters, crabs, and other fhellfifli; turbot, Ikate^ 
and herrings, all of excellent qualities, which, after fupply-

mg the people in this neighbourhood, are carried to Dunfe, 
Kellb, &amp;c., and a great part are carried to Edinburgh. The 
haddocks have ahnoft defcrted this coaft for thefe 2 or 3 years, 
but the cod and ling are more plentiful, and of better quality 
than formerly. The difFerence between the higheft and low- 
eft tides, on this Ihore, is about 20 feet \ and there are great 
quantities of fea-weed, commonly called fea-ware, thrown 
afliore here, the coarfer part of which is carried off with 
avidity, and applied as manure to the land near the fliore. 
The finer parts are manufactured into kelp, and produce fropi 
30 to 40 tons yearly. The greateft part of this finer fort, 
grows upon the rocks fituated between the high and low wa- 
ter-marks, and is cut and manufadured into kelp only once 
in 3 years. 

7ow« of Coldingham. — The town of Coldingham appears 
to have been of very high antiquity ; for the monaftery was 
one of the moft ancient and flourifhing on the eaft of Scot- 
land, and previous to the confecration of the famous St. Cuth- 
bert, the bifliop of Lindisferne, e. Holy Ifland, which was 
performed in the Cathedral of York, in the year 685, This 
monaftery, then a famous and ftately edifice, was confirmed 
and burnt *. The town of Coldingham ftands in a fnug dry 

valley, 

* It is faid (Sir D. Dalrymple's Annals, vol. I. p. 48.) to hare been febuilt 
by King Edgar, in the year 1098, and that at its confecration to the Virgin, he 
affifted in perfon, when it was conftituted into a priory of Benediftines, to which 
a colony of Monks from Durham were introduced ; and that for fereral fucceed- 
ing generations, it continued to depend upon the convent of Durham ; that: 
K. Edgar ordered a houfe to be built for himfelf, at a fmall dlitance from the 
church (part of the walls of which houfe are fliili to be feen, and afe called Ed- 
gar's walls at this day) ; and beiides this manfion-houfe, he beftowed on the

upon each fide of it, and is about a mile diftant from the fea. 
It is furrounded with rifing fields of gentle afcent, all of ex- ' 
cellent quality ; but there are no profpects from the town be- 
yond half a mile's diftance. It appears from old writings, 
U by parts of the foundations of old buildings, that feveral 
of the crofts about the town, now arable, had been anciently 
the fites of houfes and gardens. It muft, therefore, have been 
much more populous than it is at pfefent*. Before the com- 
mon moor was divided, this town was dull and unpleafant, m 
appearance, as all the houfes were covered with turfs and 
divots from that moor. All the inhabitants were averfe to 
the divifion, becaufe they forefaw, that this fervitude, and 
that of the peats and turfs for fuel, would be much con- 

fined.

* The prior refided here with all his train and dependents ; and the church 
and other buildings about it were extenCve and magnificent, but are all now in 
complete ruins, except the prefent kirk, which is dark within, and fliabby with-

the temporal lands which belonged to it, they had right to the diawn teinds of 
13 parifhes. After the general annexation, this priory was erected into a tem- 
poral lordlhip in favour of John Stuart, a natural fon or grandfon of K. 
James the 5th. It feepis he had fold a great part of the lands and teinds, and 
the remainder were carried off by the Earls of Heme, by decreets of apprifing 
and other legal diligences. They have been long in pofleffion, and partly by 
voluntary, and partly in confequence of decreets of valuation and fale, have

fined. But in place of their being fufFerers by the divirion, 
it has turned out much to their advantage, for great numbers 
of them were employed all the fummer time in digging and 
preparing peats and turfs ; but after they were, in a great 
meafure, reftriaed from that fervitude, they found more 
profitable employment, from the fpirit of improvements which 
had become general, and xvere foon able to get coals for their 
fuel : and they are now in a more thriving condition in 
tvery refped, than they enjoyed before the divifiou ; for, 
fince that period, they have not only built a good many new 
houfes, which they have covered with tiles, and fome with 
blue flates, but they have rebuilt feveral of the old houfes 
and covered them with this fort of covering ; and the town 
has now a more lively and cheerful appearance, and their 
wealth and population are vifibly increafmg. The number 
of fouls in this town, at prefent, is 718, whereof 317 are 
males, and 401 females. 

Population. — According to Dr. Webiter's report, the num-

Agriculture — iSefore the fplrit of improving land began to 
appear here, there wer6 3 confiderable villages befides the 
town of Coldingham, viz. Renton, Auchencraw, and the 2 
Preftbns ; but fince that, the heritors have built good farm- 
fteadings upon the mofl centrical parts of their outfields. 
Hence, the villages of Renton and Eaft Prefton, have difap- 
peared, and AuchencPaw and Weft Prefton have dwindled to 
l6fs than the half of what they were before that period. There 
are above 60 farms in this parifti, befides the acres that lie 
around the town of Coldingham. The rents of the farms 
are from acl. to 500 1. and upwards. Several of the heri- 
tors who poflefs their own properties, as well as our prmci- 
pal farmers, are inferior to none in induftry and Ikill for the 
improvement and management of land to the belt advaiiuge *. 

Some. 

* Previous to the year 1760, almoft the whole farms in this and the neigh- 
touring parifhes were laboured and cropt in the following manner, viz. about 
one-fourth of the arable land as infield, ahd the other three-fourths as outfield ; 
but for the better underftanding that mode of cropping and management, fup- 
pofe a farm confifting of 400 acres of arable land (befides meadow and marfhy 
ground unfit for tillage) to have been let, the tenant became bound by the 
kafe to fallow and dung one-fifth part of the infield yearly, and not to take 
above 4 crops thereof between fallowings, one of which to be barley, and an- 
other a peafe crop, and fo on through the courfe of the tack : and with refpedl 
to the outfield, he was allowed to have only one-third part of it in corn, in any 
one year, which third he was obliged to fallow, and to give it 3 or more plough- 
ings between Whitfunday and the enfuing feed time ; and after taking 3 crops of 
oats off it fucceffively, he was obliged to allow it to lie in ley for 6 years before 
it was again riven out and fallowed, and fo on vsdth the other two-thirds of the 
butfield, until the expiration of his tack. By that mode of management, the 
land was fo much wafted and worn out, that th« fourth crop of the infield, 
and the third from the outfield, frequently did not produce the double of the 
fetd ; and the orJy pafturC fuch a farmer had for fupporting his ftocking of

. Some years prior to 176®, a few individuals, of more than 
4,rdinary penetration and difcernment, having difcovered the 
mighty cfFefts of lime in Northumberland, they ventured to 
make experiments of its efFefts upon the lands in Berwickfhire ; 
and from their exertions and fuccefs, a fpirit of improvement 
became general: and in confequ^ce of the great demand for 
lime, additional lime-kilns were ereded, both upon this, and 
on the other fide of Berwick, and the great quantities pro- 
duced from them, as well as what was brought in fhips from 
Sunderland, and landed at Eyemouth, have been truly amaz- 
ing Our farming heritors and freeholders above alluded to, 
in this parifti, foon began and carried on the improvements 
of their feveral poffeffions, with equal fpirit and fuccefs. They 
foon difcovered the inefficacy and impropriety of their former 
rood.- of cropping, and relinquiftied it unanimoufly; and, in 
place thereof, adopted a quite new and different fyftem. They 
began it by fallowing and cleaning all their old infield, and 
then fowing upon it barley or oats, and red and white clover, 
with a fmall mixture of rye-grafs ; fome of them did, and o- 
thers did not lay their muck upon that fallow : becaufe old 
infield, even when it appears to be worn out and wafted by 
corn crops, will produce luxuriant crops of clover and rye- 
grals, without manure ; and fo it happened with thofe im- 
provers. They did not evan bcftow any lime upon that old 
inficid iallow, as lime has been found to have little effed up- 
on old irtfield ; and it only difcovers its powers upon frefli 
knd. And having thus difpofcd of their infield, by laying

it off in grafs, partly for hay, and partly for pafturage, which 
afForded them plenty of meat for their horfes employed in driv- 
ing hme, and carrying on their improvements in the next, and 
other years, they then applied their whole ftreugth for ma- 
nuring their outfield, at the rate of 40 to 50 bolls of lirae^ 
Ihells * to the Englifli acre, which, after being fallowed, and 
fo limed, produced three good crops, viz. oats, barley, oats ; 
or, oats, peafe, barley. They then fallowed, and, laying all 
their muck upon the fallow well pulverized, they formed it 
into drills^ and fowed turnips on the drills, which were eaten 
by their flieep in the winter, and then ploughed and fowed it 
up with grafs-feeds, in the fame manner as the infield ; and 
' fo they went on with the reft of the outfield, and by the end 
of 10 or 13 years, their farms were all thus improved, and 
were all managed and cropt thereafter as infield, and in the 
fgllowing manner, viz. Tfiey commonly allowed their fowa 
up grafs ground to remain in grafs for at leaft 3 years, fome 
4 or 5, and haying and pafturing it alternately j and after fow- 
ing it out for corn-crops, they took only three crops from the 
licheft and beft parts of . the farms ; thefe were oats, barley, 
oats ; or, cats, peafe, wheat, if the land had any tolerable mix- 
ture of good clay in it ; and they then fallowed it, fowed up 
the turnip-land with barley, oats, and grafs-feeds, as before. 
In their middling foil, they took only two crops of corn, oats 
and barley, and thereafter fallow, turnip, barley and grafs- 
feeds ; and in the weakeft and lighteft of their foil, they only 
took one crop of oats, and then fallow, turnip, barley, and 
grafs-feeds ; and in this fecond courfe they alfo gave it ano- 
ther liming of 25 to 30 bolls lime-fliells the acre, and com- 
monly with the fecond crop of the llrongcft and middling foils ;

and their whole dung and fulzie was always befiowed on the 
turnip fallow. 

Their chief objed is to have the lands laid down into grafs 
in good heart, and it will Improve every year, if paftured with 
Ibeep ; and after a farm is improved, in manner above writ- 
ten, our farmers have never lefs than half of it in grafs, and 
fomeofthem two-thirds; becaufe they find that fuch rich 
grafs fields bring them as much profit as their corn fields do. 
If fo, the lands muft be in the higheft condition, and may be 
kept fo by prudent management, at no confiderable expenfe. 
It is by too many corn crops, and too frequent crops of hay, 
that lands are deteriorated, to prevent which fliould be the 
chief attention of landlords and their managers. No fenfible 
honeft farmer will ever attempt to injure or run out his farm 
by fcdurging crops, towards the end of his tack ; and no ca- 
pricious fool will ever find fuch diftioneft means profitable. 
By departing from the old, and adopting this new fyftem of 
management, our farmers havp reaped profits equal to their 
expeftations ; their corn fields have been far more produdlive, 
and their flocking of all kinds bring them more than triple 
the prices they were fold at, before their farms were fo im- 
proved. Of late years, they have fold their hogs at or above 
ao s. a-head; their two-years old from 2js. to30s,; and 
their older flxeep between 30 s. and 40 s., and fome at higher 
prices. No pains nor expenfes have been fpared to procure 
the breed both of black cattle and flicep fitteft for their feve- 
ral paftures. In fmall farms, where there are no Iheep, the 
tenants let their turnip crops from 2 1. to 4 1. the acre. The 
turnip belonging to the greater farmers are eaten by their 
own flieep. Our bell landlords have no fcruple to let their 
farms to good farmers fcr 25 to 31 years, where the farms 
are not improved ; and indeed no tenant will take a leafe of 
any (hotter duration, where he has the farm to improve at his 

own

• wn expenfe. Many of the landlords allow the incoonng te- 
nants a confiderable dedudtion from the yearly rent, for buy- 
ing lime for aflilling them in their improvement *. 

ManufaEiures. — We have few manufadures in this parifh, 
owing to our diltance from collieries. But although our coals 
^re dearer, our grain is cheaper by l8d. or a s. a boll, than 
it is about Glafgow and Paifley. Our fupernumerary young 
men go partly to England, and partly to Edinburgh, and o- 
ther populous towns in Scotland, in quell of employment. 
Very few of them relilb eitl^er the (ailor or foldier's way of 
life. Our young women are, for the mpft part, employed in 
fpinning, of which they make very fmall wages, not exceed- 
ing 2 s. a-week. It is faid that fundry manufafturers in E. 
dinburgh, and other places, have of late years fent them quan- 
tities of lint to fpin here, which they return in yarn; ana that 
this employment increaCes every year, pur handicraftfmen

wife reaps in harveft for the houfe, and flie and her bairns, that can work, get 
from 3d. to 6d. a-day, for weeding turnips and potatoes, and for gathering and 
carrying ofFftones from the fown grafs grounds. The lotmen or threfhers of corn, 
get the 2Sth boll in name of wages; fome farmers give them a bottle of fmall- 
beer at a certain hour of the day, which is very neceflary, and it enhyens them 
much. A ploughman or carter who Uves in the farmer's houfe, gets from 61 . 
to 7I. yearly : a day-labourer gets lod. in winter, and is. the reft of the year, 
winter being reckoned at 4 months : mafons and wrights from i6d. to 2od. a-

gets from 3I. to 4I. a-year. All thefe wages, except the hinds and herds, who 
are paid in kind, have been raifed one-tliird part, at leaft, within thefe laft 40 
years. Even xU hind's and herd's are increafed. by the difference of their cow's 
meat and the fowing of potatoes ; fome of them are allowed to fow a peck or

and labourers feem to depend upon the farmers for their fub- 
fiftence, as they are principally employed by them. Ther© 
are, however, about 36 mafter weavers in the parifh, who, 
befides what they weave for the inhabitants, manufafture a 
good deal of linen and woollen cloths for fale. They are ge^ 
nerally in eafy circumftances, and fome of them are becoming 
rich in that line of life. 

Profejtons, Manners, &amp;c There are feveral fliopkeepers 

in the town of Coldingham, but none of them deal exten- 
fively. No writers or attorneys of influence ; nor is there 
one fingle juftice of peace refident in this large parilli. No 
Papifts, Epifcopals, or Unitarians. The eftablilbed Prefby- 
terian religion is the only manner of worlhip attended to and 
profeffed here ; there are, how^ever, a few feceders, who at- 
tend the Burgher and Antlburghar meetings at Ayton. They 
tax themfelves with a proportion of the expenfe of building 
the meeting-houfes, and the preacher's ftipend. Thus they 
facrifice their money, as toll- dues, for the fafeft or fureft paf- 
fage to the regions of complete happinefs in a future ftate. 
The generality of the people in this parifh are fober, frugal, 
and induftrious, plain and decent in their drefs and deport- 
ment, and very few of them difcover any defire for fineries, 
or expenfive amufements. The only extravagance they are 
guilty of is their breakfafting upon tea, in place of pottage, 
the conftant morning diet of their more athletic anceflors, 
which debilitates them ; (here I do not include the princi- 
pal families) and the immoderat'C ufe of whilky, which too 
many of the lower clafs are guilty of, which deftroys them. 
This is owing to the cheapnefs of thefe two fuperfluous and. 
pernicious articles, which appear to be obje£ls more fit for 
taxation than coals, candles, leather and foap, which are as 
fjeceffary ia the poorcft families, as their meal and milk. 

Exports^ 



Siati/iical Account 



Exports, &amp;c.~-The quantities of grain, particularly oats 
and barley, for we do not grow much wheat or peafe, as 
■well as the numbers of black cattle and ftieep, fold from this 
parilli, at Eyemouth, Berwick, and to mealmakers, communihus 
annis, are very confiderable, but cannot be afcertained with 
any degree of exaftnefs ; and it is impoflible to know the 
number of quadrupeds, without a fpecial furvey. All roots 
and vegetables neceflary for the kitchen are raifed in great 
plenty in this pariflij and we fell a great ftiare of our pota- 
toes : but there is neither hemp nor lint raifed here, except by 
fome individuals, who raife a little of the latter for their fa- 
mily purpofes, and their fervants for theirs ; and all our grain 
is commonly got into the barn-yards by Michaelmas O. S. 
except in cold wet feafons, fuch as the laft, and alfo except- 
ing the farms adjoining the common moor: there the corns are 
three or four weeks later in ripening than thofe in the warm- 
er and more fertile fields. 

Bifadvantages. — The greateft difadvantage peculiar in this" 
parifli, is the diftance and dearth of fuel. Since the divi- 
fion of the common moor, our chief fuel is coals, which we 
bring in carts from the collieries in Northumberland, ai the 
diftance of 14 miles from the centre of this parifti. The Au- 
thor of Nature, who always a(Ss for good and wife purpofes, 
for the general good of the whole creation, hath denied the be- 
nefit of coal-mines to every part of the county of Berwick; at 
leaft none fuch have as yet beeu difcovered. The legiflature, in 
fupplement and addition to our want of that neceflary article, 
did, in Queen Anne's days, faddle all water-borne coals that 
fhould be landed at Eyemouth, our only fea-port, with a 
duty of 3 s. 8 d. the ton, and at fame time exempted Dunbar, 
North Berwick, and all the other ports in the Frith of Forth 
from payment of any duty for coals. How far that law can

be reconciled with equity and juftice, which are, or ought to 
be the foundation of all laws, cannot be eafily conceived. 

Birds of Pafage, Sea-Fowl, &amp;c.-There are only two 
birds of paffage. the woodcock and the dotterel, ever feeu 
here ; the firft frequents the woods, and are few m nuinber , 
thefecond appear in tail nunabers on the heights They 
both arrive in the fpring, and are feldom feen here after the 
month of June. There is alfo a prodigious number of fea- 
fowls, known by the names of fcouts and kittywakes, with a 
mixture of fea-gulls, that arrive in the fpring yearly, upon 
the high and inacceffible rocks on the fouth fide of St. Abb s 
Head. They breed incredible numbers of young ; and about 
the end of May, when the young are faid to be ripe, but be= 
fore they can fly. the gentlemen in the neighbourhood find 
.fcxcellent fuort by going out in boats, and fbdotmg great num- 
bers of them ; when they are killed or wounded, they fall 
from the rocks into the fea, and- the rowers haul them^ mto 
their boats. Their eggs are pretty good, but their flefh is ve- 
ry bad 5 yet the poor people eat them. They leave the roc^^s 
about harveft ; and none of them are ever feen here before the 
next fpring. Where they go to in winter, nobody knows.

iy body of the name of Sprot, a notary in Eyemouth, pro- 
duced fome treafonable letters that palTed between Gowry and 
Logan ; and he was rewarded by being h^mged at Edinburgh 
crofs. There was a fortalice, or family caftle at Renton, an- 
other at Houndwood, one at Weft Prefton, and one at Eafl

The only camp that now appears to have been in thls pa-

of Auchencraw. It is of an oval form, and coptaii^s 5 or 6

Roads, &amp;c ^Previous to the year 1772, the roads in this 

county were repaired by the ftatute-work in kind, but which 
was much neglefted; and what part thereof that was performed, 
was always done in the moft flovenly and injudicious manner. 
By that time feveral inclofures were made by our improvers, 
vpon the fides of the highways. Neceffity is the ftrongeft 
prompter ; and the gentlemen being fenfible of the continual 
trefpaffes that muft happen to their fences, unlefs the roads 
were made palTable, they applied for, and obtained an ad p£ 
parliament for making turnpike roads, and for converting the 
flatute-labour into money. No turnpikes were ever ereded 
in confequence of that law, in this parifh ; but the ftatute- 
•work, fo -converted, was rigoroufly exa^ed, and applied un- 
der the diredion of the dillrid meetings. The amount of 
thefe converfions in this parifli, fince 1772, may be about 
3000 1. Sterling. The great poft-road leading acrofs the com- 
mon moor, naturally rough, wet, and deep, fwallowed up a 
great part of thefe cdnveifions for many years, and a new fe- 
parate turnpike ad was thought neceffary, for completing 
and uph'olding the repairs of that great road from Dunglafs- 
bridge to Berwick'bounds, which was accordingly obtained ; 
and at fame time a fine new bridge was built over the Peafe 
water, and that whole great poft-road is now completely re- 
paired. Hence this part of the poft-road, through Berwick- 
ihire, which was formerly the worft and moft; dangerous part 
of it, between Edinburgh and London, is now in perfed 
good repair 3 and the increafe of travellers, efpecially in car-

riages, far exceeds all expeftation ; and our ftatute conver- 
fions, which exceed 140 1. Sterling yearlj, will, it is believed, 
be fufficient for forming and fupporting all the other roads in 
good condition, under proper management, which hitherto 
feems to have been exceptionable. 

The greatcft part of the lands in this parilh have been en- 
clofed within thefe laft thirty years, (if we except the com- 
tnon moor), generally by ditch and hedge, and feme with 
ftone-fences ; and there is little doubt of the whole being en- 
clofed in a few years hence, (with the above exception). 
Thorn hedges thrive well here, fp do trees of all forts ; but 
our artificial plantations are few. There are a good many na- 
tural woods, near the head of the water of Eye. Thej con- 
Cft chiefly of oak, hazel, and birch. Some parts of thefe woods 
are let to tanners, who peel and carry off the bark of the oak

from S. to N. about 3 miles. The parifli in general is hilly, 
greater part of which is covered with heath. On the fide of 
the water of Whitadder, and the fmall rivulets which run in- 
to It, there are, in many places, confiderable tracks of low 
Ijing grounds which are naturally fertile, and which, when 
properly cultivated, are capable of producing all kinds of 

grain, 



Ztatyiical Accoiini 



grain, wheat not excepted. Befides the haugh lands, there 
are, in many of the higher parts of the pailfh, confiderable 
quantities of the land in tillage, the greater part of wliicU 
has been improved by lime brought from Eaft Lothian ; and, 
^n favourable feafons, the farmer commonly finds a very good 
return. The foil is light and dry. Tiiough, from the ele- 
vated fituation of the parifli, the climate is cold, yet it is in 
general healthy, and few difeafes prevail among the inhabi-« 
tants. 

' River. — The only river in the pari(h is Whitadder, wliich 
is here a confiderable tlream, being about 15 miles from its 
fource, and having received, in its courfe, the river Dye, the 
rivulet Monnynuk, and numberlefs other fmaller ones. It 
abounds with plenty of trouts, and affords excellent fport to 
the angler. Salmon and fea-trout are fometimes found in it 
in fummer, though feldom in great quantities. Prodigious 
Bombers of them come up during the prohibited months for 
filhing, and lodge their fpawn in the channel of the river. 
There is but too much reafon to regret, that the inhabitants 
deftroy them at that time, as it tends both to injure their own 
health, by making ufe of the fifli in the weak and unhealthy 
Hate in which they then are, and is a great prejudice to the 
faltnon-fiihing in the river Tweed, 

Po/)a/a^/o;7.--According to Dr. Webfter's report, the num. 
ber of fouls then, was 80. There are at prefent 164 inha- 
bitants in the parilh, of whom 85 are males, and 79 females ; 
all of whom, except a few mechanics, are employed in pur- 
pofes of hufbandry, either as day-labourers, hired fervants to 
farmers, or flicpherds. They are in general fober, frugal, 
and induftrious, and are contented with their fituation. When 

the 



Of Ahbay of St. Bathans, 



the prefent incumbent was fettled herc^in 1775, ^he number 
of inhabitants was 145. 

Agriculture — Though, like other parts of Lammermoor, the 
lands are in general more adapted to the bl-eeding of cattle 
and flieep than the raifirig of corn, jet, on all the difFerenC 
farms there are confiderable parts of the ground under culti- 
vation J and on fome of them diiFerent kinds of grain, parti- 
cularly early oats are produced, little inferior in quality to 
thofe that are raifed in the lower parts of BerwickOiire. The 
chief objecl:, however, that the ikilful farmer has in view in 
making ufe of the plough in this part of the country, is not 
fo much the immediate return from the corn he raifes, as the 
meliorating the pafture for his cattle and llieep, by fowing his 
fields with artificial grafs feeds, particularly rye-grafs and 
white clover, which thrive weU on all the dry grounds that 
have been improved with lime. Thofe who have followed 
this method, have not only been able to keep a much greater 
quantity, but have alfo. by this means, an opportunity of 
greatly improving the breed both of their cattle and flieep. Tur- 
nips are alfo raifed on moft of the farms in this neighbour- 
hood, though in much fmaller quantities than might be ex- 
-pefted, as the foil is peculiarly adapted to the cultivation of 
that ufeiul plant *,

The rental of the parlfli is about 600 1. a-year. The Crown 
is patron of the church. The value of the living, exdufiveof 
the manfe and glebe of 14 acres, is abottt 52 1. a-year. The 
church is a very ancient building; it was formerly large, nnea- 
furing 58 feet by 26, but a part of the wall was lately taken 
down by the defire of the heritors, and the fize of the church 
greatly contraaed ; it is ftill fufficiently large to accommodate 
the inhabitants of the parifli. 

Antiquities.— Betvften the church and the water of Whit- 
adder, are the remains of an ancient nunnery; it is almoft to- 
tally demoliftied, the ftones having been carried away for 
other purpofes ; from the veftiges, however, which are ftill 
to be feen, the building feems to have been of confiderable 
extent. From anj materials that I have been able to colka, 
this nunnery, of Abbay of St, Bathau's, feems to have been 
founded by one of the CountelTes of March, during the reign 
of King William the Lyon, who fucceeded to the Crown of 
Scotland in 1165, and reigned 49 years ; fo that it muft have 
happened between 1165 and 121 4. In 1296, Ada, Countefs 
of March, fwore fidelity for this nunnery to Edward I. King 
of England, who had then fubdued great part of Scotland ; 
and in return, dlreded a writ to the IherifF of Berwick to re- 
llore to the nunnery all its lands and tenements. It was a 
cell of South Berwick, and the nuns were of the order of 
Bernardines or Clftertians. This religious order had been 
begun by Robert, Abbot of Milefme, in the diocefe of Lon- 
grcs in Franct, in 1098— were called Monachi Abbi, White 
Monks, from their wearing white robes, except a black coul 
or fcopular_were called Bernardines from Bernard, the great 
propagator of the order, who founded 160 monafteries, di- 
vided into 36 provinces, whereof Scotland was 26th. and had 
I a monafteries— were called Clftertians from their chief houfe

and monaHerles In Ciftertlum iu France. There is ia the 
wall, near the altar-place in the church, a font aone with a 
lead pipe in the bottom, and from fprings in the braes to the 
fouth, the church and buildings adjoining had been fupplied 
with water by means of lead pipes, pare of which have been 
feen by people thereabout, after being dug up about 40 years 
ago. To the fouth, and round the church and nunnery, were 
gardens, now arable land, and on that account were called 
the Preclna Yards, and round the whole had been a walk of 
3 tire of ftones, which have alfo been feen by thofe who 
raifed part of them. After obfervlng that the nunnery lies 
upon the fouth fide of the water of Whltadder, it may be 
added, that there are pleafant haughs adjoining, fneltered 
from the north, by Shannabank wood of natural oak, on a 
fteep brae, rifing to a great height, and forming at top a fe^ 
micircle, and from the eaft, by Blackerftone braes and natu^ 
ral wood there. On the fou'th of thefe haughs, and at a fniall 
dlftance from the nunnery, iffues a fpring called St. Bathan's 
well, that neither fogs nor freezes, and pre\^ents a dam-lead 
from Whitadder ferving a corn-mill below, being locked up 
with ice in winter. About a quarter of a mile from the nun- 
nery, on the fame fide of the water, lie the foundations of a 
fmall chapel and yard holding that name; b-Jt there are no 
marks of people having buried in it : about a mile from the 
nunnery, on the other tide of the Whitadder, is Utaated Trois 
Fontaines (3 fprings or v^ells) on the fide of Manegnut water 
which empties Into the Whitadder here, where the remains 
of ai chapel and burying-ground are yet extant. It has al- 
ways been handed down, that a fubterraneous paflage went 
from the nunnery of St. Bathan's, below the water of Whit- 
adder, to this chapel, where the nuns pafled along to be con- 
feffed by the clergy from Goldxngham, who had a houfe ac

chapel. Trois Fontaines was alfo a cell of South Berwick ; 
but I have not been able to find any writings relating to it, and 
fo can give no further account of it. 

Trees, Game, &amp;c — On the lands of Abbay and farms ad- 
joining, grow naturally the oak, the mountain-aOi. the hazel, 
the birch tree, befides other trees ; the honey-fuckle, the a- 
nife, the rafp, the juniper, the brier, and bramble, &amp;c. On 
the lands are plenty of moorfowl, partridge, gray plover, 
hares, rabbits, &amp;.c. 

Country Seat — I beg leave to add, that about a mile eaft 
from the village of Abbay, is a country feat of the Earl of 
Wemyfs, called the Retreat. It was built by his Lordftiip about 
12 years ago, upon his eftate of Blackerftone, and though 
not within the bounds of this parifti, deferves to be taken no- 
tice of in the ftatiftical account of it, as it tends very much 
to beautify this part of the country. The houfe is of a cir- 
cular form, and built after a new and fingular plan : as the 
elegant fimplicity of the architedure, the neatnefs and con- 
venience of the different apartments, and the manner in which 
the grounds around it are laid out, do great credit to the tafte 
of the proprietor ; fo its retired fituation on the banks of the 
Whitadder, in the heart of a mountainous country, together 
with natural wood, and the extenfive plantations with which 
it is furrounded, render it a truly delightful and romantic re- 
treat. </p></div>

Presbytery of Jedburgh.) 

By the Rev. Mr. William Scott.</head> 


<p>
Nar/ie, Extent, Surface, Climate. 

SOUTHDEAN, the name of the parifti, is evidently de- 
fcriptive of its local fituation, and the fornier ftate of 
the furrounding country, as it is probable that all the neigh- 
bouring parifhes were anciently one continued foreft. The 
extent of the parilh is about 12 ntiiles long, and 7 broad j 
this proportion continues about 9 miles, and gradually di- 
minifhes into a narrow fpace. There are different kinds of 
foil ; gravel, a light black earth, and a ftrong clay, in the 
lower parts ; along the Jed, it is gravel, inclining to heath ; 
from thence, to the afcent of the hills, it is light earth, and 
upon their declivity, it is flrong clay. The prefent arable 
ground is v ery inconfiderable, as great part of the parifh is

more adapted to flieep paaure. The few hills are green and 
dry. The air is nioift and chillj ; greatly changes in different 
parts of the parilli : all kinds of farm work can be carried on 
in the lower grounds, when it rains, or even a fall of fnow 
appears in the heights. It is, however, a healthy parifb. 
There are at prefent inhabitants above 80 years of age. The 
difeafes moR common, are rheumatifms, pains in the flomach 
and bowels, owing, likely, to the low and damp fixation of 
their houfes. In former times, the fmall-pox frequently pre- 
vailed, and in fome feafons almoft depopulated the country. 
About 12 years ago, this fatal difeafe raged in the lower parts 
of Tiviotdale, which determined Lord Douglas to hold out 
the advantages of inoculation to the poorer fort in this pa- 
rifii. The phyfician, employed by his Lordfhip, was fuc- 
cefsful. Inoculation is now become almoft univerfcilly the 
pradice. 

Population — According to Dr. Wcbfter's report, the num- 
Ijer of fouls then, was 480. From tradition, as well as in- 
nun:erable veftiges and ruins of houfes, population muft hav^ 
been confiderable about a century ago, and from general opi- 
nion, it is greatly diminifbed. In a late mcafurement of the 
Foreft eftate in this parilh, the arable land is computed al 
4863 acres, the evident traces of former times ; the prefent 
arable ground is limited to a few hundred acres. It is faid, 
the examination-roll in J 724, amounted to upwards of 3600. 
An accurate lift of the inhabitants was taken about 17 years 
ago, and fell fliort oF '900. This decreafe became rapid, from 
the jun£tion of farms. There are at prefent 714 fouls in the 
parifh : above 10 years of age 569. The number of deaths 
canno' be To well afcertuincd, and the marriages Hill lefs. 
The annual number of births is 10,

Sheep, Horfes, &amp;c. — It has long been the fartr.ers greatefl: 
fludy to introduce the beft kinds of flieep. Individuals have 
much improved their flocks, both from acquired knowledge 
and information, and with more certain advantages, by their 
own experience, obfervation, and daily praftlce. Moft farm- 
ers keep a part of their fheep white. Snnearing, however, is 
ftill generally in praftice in this parilh. It is faid to increafe 
the quantity of wool. It preferves the fheep alfo from the in- 
fluence of rains, from fcab, and vermin of every fort. There 
are 130 horfes in the parilh, 42S black cattle, and it is be- 
lieved about 17,000 ftieep. The laid wool in this parifla, fold 
laft year from i8s. to 20s. the ftone, and the white wool at 
il. 4s. the flone. heven or eight fleeces go to a ftone. 

Stipend, School, Poor, &amp;c. — The King is patron of the old 
paiifli of Abbotrule, and Lord Douglas of Southdean. The 
llipend is 102 1. i s. Sterling, a manfe and a glebe ; in all 
amounting to 117!. Sterling yearly. The church was 
built in 1690, and the manfe in 1736, both in extremely bad 
order. The fchoolmafter is accommodated with a houfe and 
garden. The falary is 81. 443. 8 d. Sterling. This, with 
the fchool wages, and various emoluments, makes a living of 
20 1. Sterling. The number of poor is about 22. Their 
maintenance amoupts to 56 1. a-year, arifing from aflelTments, 
Sundays collections, and the mortcloth dues. 

Crops. — The chief crops in this parifli are oats and bai-ley. 
Potatoes are common. The culture of turnip has been at- 
tempted with good fuccefs. Part of the annexed lands of Ab- 
botrule is well adapted to turnip-hulbandry. Grounds ^overed 
■with brcom, heath, from this beneficial praftice, produces a-

bundant crops of clover and rje-grafs. Valued rent is 6387 1.

Proprietors, tenants, &amp;c.--There are 4 proprietors, 2 con- 
ftantlj refide. There are ii greater, and 19 fmaller tenants ; 
36 (hepherds, 4 mafons, 7 wrights, 2 blackfmiths, 5 tailors, 8 
■weavers, 

i'a^/.— The fuel made ufe of is of various kinds. Peat, 
from different moffes, conftituted formerly the principal fuel, 
and turf from the moors ; the whole fummer was fpent in 
collefting fuel. Peat and turf are now ufed in fraall quanti- 
ties. Coal at 4 d. the load, chiefly from Ryechefter in Nor- 
thumberland. A double cart carries 6 loads : the diftance is 
about 15 miles. The carriage colls 8 s. befides the purchafe- 
money. 

parries.— ThtTz are many quarries of free-ftone, and in- 
ezhauaible quarries of lime-ftone, in the higher parts of th^ 
parifh. There is alfo an excellent quarry of white hard ftone, 
which is ufed for chimney-grates, as it endures the greatell 
heats, and will laft for many years. 

Antiquities, — Many tumuli, commonly called cairns, are to 
be ftjen in different parts of the parilh. Stones have been led 

away 

* Scarcity I782 aitd 1783. — The crop was very deficient, and the poor were 
reduced to great diftrefs. Every method was taken by the attention of the he- 
ritors, to increafe the poor's fands. This could only reach to fuch as were upon 
tlie roll, and found inadequate to their neceffities. Many labourers fuffered the 
utpioft hardfliips ; and what added to the general calamity, the frolled oats and 
barley gave a noxious quality to the meah In thefe deplorable circumftances. 
Lord Douglas humanely direfted his agent in the country to buy good whole- 
fome food. The bounty was continued, both to the poor upon the lift, and all 
indigent houftholders in the' pa,rifii.

awa/ to the turnpike roads. In the centre of the heap, fquare 
flones were placed, fo as to form a kind of chert, and human 
bones were difcovered. There is alfo one place, where it is 
faid a chapel flood before the Reformation, 3 miles from 
the old church, but almoft no veftige of its walls now appears. 
There are ruins of many old towers, in mod parts of the pa- 
rifli. None of thera appear to have been large. In fome 
places they ftand nearly entire. At the village of Chellers, 
and marry other places, on the adjacent heights, there are like- 
wife to be feen the ruins of ftrong fortifications or camps. -The 
form is round, and, in general, quite diflinft. None of the 
camps are large, may comprehend above an acre of ground, 
and are furrounded with a double wall of earth. There is no 
appearance of any ftone-work about them, except in the mid- 
dle, which feems paved with freeflone. Each camp is appa- 
rently flationed within view of Southdean-Iaw, as tradition 
fays, a place of obfervation, on which fires were kindled at the 
approach of an enemy. 

Advantages and Difadvantages. — This parilli long laboured 
under the greateft op|)reffion ; the numerous droves of black 
cattle and fheep pafjlng into England, infefled and overfpread 
the befl paflure ground. Every returning feafon opened a 
new foene of difpute, teaiing, anxiety and diflrefs to the tenant. 
Many regulations were framed. Boundaries fixed. Lawlefs 
trefpafs maintained its ufual inroads. It does great honour to 
the gentlemen in this part of the country, that they have, with 
fpirited and determined exertion, defigned and extended roads 
of public advantage, and of parochial utility. The road 
from NewcafUe at the Carter-toll, branches into this pa- 
rifh in two diredUons : the one line leads to Jedburgh, and 
the other to Hawick, which at once reftores the farmer to 
the free and peaceable pofTefTion of his lands, gives aneafy ac-

cefs to coal and Ii'me at Ryechcfter, and perpetuntcs a commu- 
nication with the neighbouring kingdom, without molertation 
or injury. The principal difadvantage is want of fhelttr, de- 
fence from the- fcorching fun in fiimmer, and proteaion in 
winter from the piercing wind?, frequent and violerit rains, 
and deflroying blafts of fnow. The arable land in thi3 pHrifli, 
under the moft cautious and prudent management, fpcedily 
returns to its -native barren foil. From the fame caufe, the 
beft breed of fheep may degenerate into the mofl unprofitable 
animal; whilft growing fhelter furnirties certain experience, 
and eftablifhes the means of recovering high and expofed fitu- 
ations into a found and healthy ftate, and of improving an^ 
preferving the quality of the flock. </p></div>

already mentioned, which run along the N. and S. E. fide of 
it. Into thefe, feveral little rivulets, or, as they arc common- 
ly called, burns, from the high or hilly grounds, empty them- 
felves. 

Woods and Plantations. — There is a confiderable extent of 
natural wood in different parts of the parifla, coniifting chiefly 
of oak and afh, with fome birch and alder. In the woods up- 
on the eftate of Barjarg, is an oak tree remarkable for its great 
fize and age. At the root, it is r.bout 1 4!- feet in circumfe- 
rence, and it lofes very little of its thicknefs at the height of 
30 feet. Its age cannot now be afcertained, but it mult cer- 
tainly be feveral hundred years old. The higheft branches 
feem now to be beginning to decay. There are alfo fome 
plantations^ confiding moftly of fir. Thefe plantations, toge- 
ther with the natural woods, add much to the beauty of the 
place, and in ftormy wealher afford fhelter to the cattle graz- 
ing in them, and in the adjoining fields. 

Climate and Difeafes.-r-The. climate is rather moiil and damp, 
ovs'ins; to the contmued ridge of hills, on the S. fide of the pa- 
rifh, intercepting and breaking the clouds into rain, which 
is poured down on the fides of the hills, and thofe places that 
are near them, much more frequently, and more plentifully, 
than on the plain and level grounds at a greater diftance from 
them. To this caufe, perhaps, are to be afcribed the flow 
nervous fevers, rheumatifms, and afthmatic diforders, which 
feem to be more prevalent here, than any other difeafes.

take two or three white crops from it, after that a green crop, 
tr a fummer fallow, which is fucceeded by a crop of barley, 
tilong with which they fow grafe-feeds, und lay out the field, 
cutting the grafs two y«ars, and pafturing it two or three 
more, before it is bioken np again. They, for moft part, ufe 
the little clofe jointed Scots plough, commonly drawn by two 
horfes, and fometimes by three, where the land is ftilF, and 
has never been well cultivated, and properly dreffed before. 
Lime is much ufed here as a manure, and is found to anfwer 
very well. Many of the farmers fpread it upon the furface 
■8 or 10 months before they plougli their field. Others again 
plough ih-eir field, and give it a flight harrowing, before they 
fpread the lime upon it, after which they fow their oats, and 
then harrow it completely. This method feems to anfwer 
better, as, by thefe means the lime is fooner mixed and incor- 
porated with the foil. The quantity of lime muft be adapt- 
ed to the nature of the land on which it is laid. Deep, flrong, 
ftifF land requires more than a fhaliow, loofe, open foil does. 
The quantity ufed for one acre is from 50 to 80 meafures of 
fhells, the meafure containing two Manchefter bufhels. Qne 
liming is found to ferve very well for two courfes of crop?, 
■and fometimes three, before the liming is repeated. And 
when it is repeated, half the quantity lhat was laid on tlve 
field at firft, or little more, is found to be fufiicient. It is ob- 
ferved, however, that at the end of every courfe of crops, the 
field is renewed with dung, along with a green crop, or by a

properly be called whifky-houfes, for whilky is the principal 
article they deal in, and they have a great demand for it. 
The pernicious pradice of drinking whilky has made a very 

rapid 

binary feafons, begins about the zoth of Auguft, and ends about the beginning- 
of Odlober, but for fome years paft has been confiderably later. 

* Wages of Servants and Labourers, &amp;c.— The wages of men labourers are 
8 d. a-da'y with vidluals, and i s. 2 d. without vidlnals. The wages of women 
for working at peats, hay-making, and other farm work, is 5 d. with their diet, 
and 9 d. and 10 d. without it. In harveft, both men and women are commonly 
8 d.a-day, with viftuals, and 1 s. and i s. 2 d. when they furnifh their own pro- 
▼ifions. The day's wages of a mailer mafon, -carpenter, and Hater, are as. ; of a 
tailo/, 8 d. with vidluals. The average wages of farming men fsrvants are 
8 1. yearly with bed and board ; and of women 3 1. 10 s. The wages of domefti^

years laft part. It is purchafecl at a very low price, and a 
fmall quantity of it is fufficient, not only to intoxicate, but 
even to make a man mad. Its pernicious effefts upon the 
morals, the induftry, and the conftitutions of thofe N'ho are 
addided to it, muft be vifible to every fober obferver. 

P^oads.—The principal road in the parifli is in very indif- 
ferent repair. A part of it is ftill in its natural ftate, and 
thofe parts of it, that have been repaired, were done in a 
very fuperficial manner. The converfion of the ftatute-la- 
boup, amounts to little more than 12I. a-year, which might 
keep our roads in repair, if they were once fufficiently made ; 
tut will by no means both make, and keep them in proper 
order. The badnefs of our roads is a great bar to improve-, 
ments of every kind. 

Churchy Stipend, School, Poor, &amp;c. — The church was re- 
paired about 30 years ago, but has never been properly feat- 
ed, and the number of inhabitants having increafed confider- 
ably of late years, it is rather too fmall for their accommoda- 
tion. The manfe and offices were all new built. in the year 
1778, and are in very good repair. His Grace the Duke of 
Queenfberry is patron of the parifh. The ftipend is 700 1. 
Scots money, and 3 chalders of visual, two- thirds of which 
are meal, and one-third bear ; which, with the manfe, and 
glebe of about 8 acres, may be reckoned worth about 90 1. 
yearly. — The parifli fchool is inconveniently fituated, being 
about 2 miles too near the upper or weft end of the parilh, 
l)y which the lower or eaft. end is in a great meafure deprived 
. of the benefit of it. The number of fcholars, in the winter 
feafon, is between 30 and 40, during the reft of the year they 
pe not fo nunierous, many of them being employed in herd- 
ing,

mg, or any other occupations fultcd to their years and firength. 
The fchool falary is icol. Scots, with a free houfe. The 
fchool fees are very trifling : for teaching Englifli is. 3d. the 
tjuarter ; writing and arithmetic is. 6d. No Latin has been 
taught here for many years — ^The poor who regularly receive 
alms from the kirk-feffion, are 6. They are fupplied from 
the colleaions in the church on Sundays, and the intercft of 
a fmall fum appropriated to their ufe, amounting in all to 
about 1 2 1, a.year. They are all maintained in their own 
houfes. They earn about a half or two-thirds of their own 
mamtenance ; and none of them beg from door to door. The 
parifli, however, is much infefted with beggars who do not 
belong to, nor refide in it. 

Population, &amp;c — According to Dr. Webfter's report, the 
number of fouls then, was 495. The population of the pa- 
rifti has increafed confiderably of late years. In the year 1778, 
the number of fouls did not exceed 303, whereas they are 
now 52c. This increafe is chiefly to be afcribed to two 
caufes ; the divilion of large farms into fmaller ones, and a 
iime work which was begun a few years 3go, of which we 
ihall take more particular notice afterward. Of the inha- 
bitants of the parifli, 12 are Anliburgher Seceders ; 12 are 
Cameronians ; all the reft are of the Eftabliflied Church. 
There are 3 blackfmiths, 4 carpenters, 2 mafons, 8 weavers, 
and 4 tailors. All the other inhabitants of the parifli are 
farmers, and their cottagers, who live in detached houfes, 
there being, as was before obferved, neither towns nor vil- 
lages in it. 

Number of Horfes, Black Cattle, Sheep, &amp;c There are 

120 horfes, moflly of the Scots breed, ftrong made, and very 
hardy. There are a few of the breed of Ireland, which gene- 
rally 



Of Kcir, 

^Uj improve here, and are found to anfwer every purpofe of 
the farmer. Their value, at an average, may be about 14!. 
Sterling, each. There are about 280 milch cows, with their 
calves, or followers as they are called, nfually kept in the 
pariOi ; worth, at an average, about 61. Sterling each. The 
number of ftieep in the diftrid does not exceed 1880 ; thej 
are the common Scots kind, white on the body, and black on 
the face and legs ; they are very hardy, but their wool is 
ftrong and rather coarfe. No fwine are bred in the diftnft, 
Moft of the farmers buy a pig or two annually, which rhey 
feed for the ufe of their own families. 

Fuel, &amp;c. — The greater part of the parifh is but indifferent- 
ly provided with fuel, for though there is fome mofs about 
the middle of the parifh, it is at a confiderable diftance from 
the extremities of it, and confequently to the inhabitants of 
thefe parts, very expenlive. The greater part of the fuel 
ufed here, is eoal from Sanquhar, which is likewife very ex- 
penlive, being carried about 14 miles. Nor is this all : of 
late years it has been of a very bad quality ; and the demand 
for it is fo great, that the carters are often detained 24, and 
fomctimes 48 hours, before they can be ferved. And it can- 
not but be fuppofed that there muft be a great demand for 
coal at Sanquhar, when it is confidered that there is no other 
coal-work in Nithfdale, Annandale, the fliire and ftewartry 
of Galloway. The lower parts of Annandale, and of Nithf- 
dale, and all along the fea-coaft of Galloway, would be fup- 
plied with coal from England, at a moderate and eafy rate, 
were it not for the high duty, amounting alfo to a prohibi- 
tion, laid upon them. Were this duty aboliflied, the de- 
mand at Sanquhar would be greatly leffened, and confequent- 
ly this part of the counti-y much better fupplied.

About 6 years ago, a lime rock was difcovered in th^ 
eftate of Barjarg, and from that time has been carried on 
with confiderable fuccefs. The rock feems to be inexhaufti- 
We, but has about 14 feet deep of earth above it; the remov- 
ing of which is attended with no fmall expenfe. Between 30 
and 40 hands are conftantly employed for 7 or 8 months in 
the year, when they continue to burn lime ; but not fo many 
during the reft of the year. Between 20,000 and 30,000 
meafures, in ftells, have been fold annually; the meafure, as 
before obferved, containing % Wincheftcr bufliels. It is fold 
at 9d. the meafure, and as the lime is of an excellent qua- 
lity, it is not improbable that the demand for it will in- 
creafe. 



CharaRer of the People, &amp;cc. — The people, in general, are 
fober and induftrious, though it muft be confeffed, that, fince 
the pernicious praftice of drinking whifky became fo pre- 
valent, there are too many exceptions. They enjoy, in a 
reafonable degree, the neceffaries, and even the comforts and 
conveniencies of life, and are, generally, as contented with 
their fituation, as moft people. Their condition, however, 
might be meliorated, were our roads put into proper repair, 
the duty on the Englifti coal abolifhed, the inhabitants bet- 
ter fupplied with coal from Sanquhar, and the heavy mul- 
tures, which they are bound to pay to the mills to which 
they are thirled, removed. More than one-half of the pa- 
rifti pays the eleventh peck as rriulture, befides paying the 
miller for working or grinding their grain. This is cer- 
tainly a very great difcouragement to improvements in agri- 
culture. </p></div>

<p>


Patron^ Stipend, 'iSc. 

BARR was erefted into a parifli in the year 1653, former- 
Ij annexed to the pariflies of Girvau and Daillj. The 
parifli feems to have taken its name from a fmall eftate called 
Barr, upon which the kirk Hands. The Crown is patron. 
The ftipeiid is too 1. a-year, befides glebe and manfe. 

Population — According to Dr. Webfter's report, the num- 
ber of fouls then was 858. Of inhabitants at prefent there 
are 750, of whom 115 are under 8 years of age ; males 385, 
females 364. For 10 years prior to 1791, there appears from 
the pavifh records, males born in the parifli 195, females 15 s ; 
in all 350 J marriages in the above time X29 ; and burials 
a86. For 20 years prior to 1791, upon an average, there ap-

pears to have been annually males born In the parifh 5 fiiorS 
of 10 ; females 5 fliort of 8 ; total 10 ftiort of 18; of mar- 
ri'.g; s 7 fliort of 7 annually ; and of burials 6 fliort of 15 an- 
nually. The parifli feems to have contained more inhabitants 
in former times than at prefent. In the year 1770, there 
were born in the parifli, males 15, females 12, total 27. In 
the year 1790, males 7, females 4, total ,11. In the year 1791, 
jnales y, females 6, total 15'. Population in this parifli has de- 
creafed much for thefe 30 years ; and the reafon is obvious, 
proprietors of lands of late years have caft two or more of 
their farms into the hands of one tenant ; by which means, in 
place of a family with cottagers and fervants upon almofl; eve- 
ry larm, there are fome farms in which there is not one in- 
habitant, and many where a fliepherd man fervant and his fa- 
mily alone occupy the farm, which is no more than is abfo- 
lately neceffary to herd the grounds. Of mechanics, there area 
millers, 4 blsckfmiths, 1 2 weavers, 6 mafons, 3 carpenters, 2 
ihoemakers, 5 tailors, 5 inkeepers. Of farmers 46 ; there are 
many more farms in the parilh ; fome individual farmers hold 
fome 2, others 3, 4, or 5 farms. There is onefeceder. 

Antiquities. — There is, about a mile S. W. of the parilh 
church, the remains of an old Popifli chapel, {landing on an 
eminence, by a fmall river called Stencher. There are no 
traditional accounts worthy of communicating concerning this 
chapel : it is called Kirk Domina, the Kirk of our Lady, fup- 
pofed to be dedicated in honour of the Virgin Mary. When it 
was built, is uncertain ; but it had been in fome repair in the 
yean 653, as the roof was then taken down,, and put upon the 
parifti church. Though there is no village at this chapel, but 
tone fmall farm-houfe only,^ yet there is a great annual fair 
held here upon the lall Saturday of May, called Kirk Domi- 
Bse fair. 

Mineral 



Of Barr. 



8i 



Mineral Spring and Minerals. --This parlHi being a hilly 
country, abounds with fprings of fine water, many of tliem 
mineral. But there is one called Shalloch-well, which has 
defervedly the pre-eminence. The virtues of this water are 
well known in this country j it is a pretty ftrong chalybeate, 
and partakes of the fulphur alfo to no inconfiderable degree. 
About 30 years ago, people of the firft rank and faftiion ia 
Carrick and the neighbourhood, attended this well ; but this 
is not the cafe at prefent ; every feafon, however, produces 
fome company, and the waters have been rarely known to fail 
in giving relief to perfons afflicted with ftomachic or fcorbutic 
diforders. The reafon why this water is in a great meafure 
deferred, is the want of proper accommodation at the well. 
There is freeftone in the parilh, and abundance of liraeftone. 
No coal has yet been found in it ; and through want of a road 
to the coal-pit, on the water of Girvan, the inhabitants are ne- 
ceflitated to depend principally upon turf and peat for fuel. 
It is fuppofed that this, like many high countries, poffefles 
valuable minerals ; for certain, there is lead in it; but the trial, 
properly fpeaking, has never been made (though once at- 
tempted) to find out "whether it would be to the advantage of 
the proprietor to follow after this valuable article. 

Climate. — The climate is not by any means unfavourable to 
health. The paridi is extenfive j the inhabitants fparfe, and 
families living at a diftance from each other, contribute muck 
to the falubrity of the place. There is a village at the parifh 
,church, but it does not contain above 86 inhabitants, old and ^ 
young. An eminent furgeon in this neighbourhood, now fome 
years dead, who praclifed in this country near .50 years, was 
in ufe to obferve, that in all that time he never knew an epi- 
demical diftemper in this parilh. There have been many in- 
ilances of longevity in the parilb, of people living conliderably 

L 2 above

Statyiical Account 



above 80 years. There is a poor old woman in the village, 
who muft, from her own account, be above 90 ; (lie remem- 
bers well the young men in this place learning the ufe of arms 
an the year 1715, and was reaping on a corn-ridge, a big kfs 
about 18 years of age, when the above men pafled by to join 
the loyalifts ; flie is very healthy, and able to walk about 
•with her ftafT. Confumptions prevail mott in this place. 

Agriculture — This parifli is partly arable, but confifts 
principally of pafture-grounds. As to improvements of any 
fort, it may be faid to be in its natural ftate. Though there is 
plenty of lime in the parifli, yet the want of roads renders it 
difficult to procure coals, in order to prepare lime-ftone for 
the purpofe of improving the grounds ; but if a free com- 
munication was opened between the coal- works upon the wa- 
ter of Girvan and this place, by making a good road, which 
is in extent about 4^ miles only j improvements might find 
their way to this part of the country alfo, the nature of the 
grounds in this parifh is fuch, that they produce but very 
poor fcanty crops, without lime or marie ; therefore the far- 
mers here plough but very little ; but thofe who have made 
any attempts by means of the lime, have had confidcrable re- 
turns. 

Black Cattle. — In this parifli the farmer's attention has been 
principally directed to the breed of black cattle, and has fuc- 
ceeded. In this particular, they have attained to great per- 
feftion. Carrick produces, perhaps, as handfome black cattle- 
as any part of Scotland ; but not the dulce only, but the utile 
is to be taken into confideration. It is a fadt founded upon, 
repeated experiment, that the handfome Carrick cattle are 
much eafier fed, and at much lefs expenfe, than the crofs made 
hook-boned cattle of like flz.c ; that pafture which can bring 

the

the coarfe made cattle to a keeping condition only, will make 
the Carrick black cattle thorou^ fat ; and that pafture which 
can bring the latter into a middling condition only, will fcarce 
be able to keep the former in life. Cattle reared in this 
country, and fold at the age of 3, or siye^^s (from the moors) 
will bring from 4I. los. to 5 1. 5 S- each ; and if put upon low 
lying enclofed pafture for an year, they will be ready for the 
Englilh market, and bring from 61. 10 s. to 8 1. each. Thi5 
parifti is fuppofed to hold from 1500 to 3000 black cattle. 

Cheviot Sheep, &amp;c.— It would be well for the farmers here, 
,:ould as much be faid for their flieep ftock ; but this cannot 
be expefted, fo long as fo many black cattle are reared in the 
pariflj. They not only leffen the quantity of food, being per- 
mitted to pafture among the Iheep, but poach the furface with 
their feet, and even the grafs which fprings where the cattle 
dung, is unwholefome for fliecp. Sheep ill this parifh are in- 
ferior in point of ftrength to the ftieep in Crawfordmoor, but 
make better fat. Wedders 3 and 4 years old from the common 
hill pafture here, when come to the beft ftate of flefli the 
grounds bring them, between Michaelmas and Martinmas, 
will weigh from 10 to 14 pound Englifhthe quarter, and pro- 
duce tallow from 9 to 12 pounds Englifli, and fell at from lol. 
to T.3I. the fcore. The pafture ground of this pavifti is for 
moft part dry ; its hillg confift partly of heath, but moftly 
what is called white ground, and, as one might judge, not un- 
favourable to the improvement of wool, by means of the Che- 
viot breed. The writer of thefe remarks is the rather inclin- 
ed to think fo from the following experiment, now making in 
this parifli : Two fcore of ewe hogs, and a ram of the Che- 
viot breed, were put upon a farm called Tarrafeffock, June 
179^1, the property of the Earl of Caflillis, poffeffed by Mr. 
M'Hutchfon of Changue. This farm is one of the higheft in

the pan&amp;, and confequently fubjcft to ftorm. The hogs have 
plenty of coaife grafs, and fuch attention paid to them as 
cuglit to be paid to ftranger, or what is called hefring 
flieep. But, confidering the wetnefs of the harveft, tht 
ftormy winter and fpring, the hogs and ftranger hogs' too, 
brought to a high cold farnii from all this it might have been 
expeded, that moft, if not all of this Cheviot breed, would 
have died during the courfe of the winter, But, what is afto. 
niihing, upon the 27th March 1703, two days fince, they were 
all alive, and likely to do well, which is by no means the cafe 
v/ith the natives either upon that farm, or thofe of the neigh- 
bourhood. • This has been a very fickly feafon, and, by aU 
accounts, every where upon the S.^ and W. of Scotland, the 
fall of fJieep has been confiderable, through poverty and dif- 



eafe 



The wool of this parifli is greatly fuperior to that at Craw^ 
fordmoor, but inferior to the fmall white faced flieep in Pen- 
ningham or Mochruni in Galloway, or that of the llieep on 
the Ihore of Dunnure in this county. Wool in this parilh 
fells from 4 1. 10 s. to 6 1. the pack ; from 7 s. 6d to los the 
flone ; and as it takes lo fleeces for moft part to the ftone, 
each fleece fold in wholefale, brings from pd. to i s. the fleece. 
Ayrflaire ftone is 24 lib. Englifli. This parLCh is fuppofed 
to keep 25,000 flieep. 

It mufc be obferved in favour of the Cheviot breed, (but 
by no means to exaggerate in^ favour even of them) ; thofe 
of the Cheviot breed in this parifli, though hogs (and ever3- 
ftoremafler knows that hog wool is by far the coarfefl; of the 
wool) laft i^afon produced wool greatly fuperior in quality 
and quantity to the wool of this parifli. The wool of the 
natives, or, what may be called the fliort flieep of the farm 
pf TarrafeiTock, v/here the hogs of the Cheviot breed, or long 
^eep, paflure, and of the farms in the neighbourhood, fells at 

7 s. 6d= 



Of Ban, 87 

7s. 6 d. the Hone, 9 d. the fleece, taking 10 fleeces to the 
ftone. 50 fcore of fheep at this rate will bring in wool 37 1. 
10 s. ; but the wool of the long flieep, or Cheviot breed in 
the parifh, gave laft feafon 15 s. the ftone, 7 f fleeces to the 
ftone, 2 3. the fleece; 50 fcore of which, at this rate, would 
bring 100 1. Fine wool in the lower parts of GaUowaj brings 
from 12 s. to 145. the ftone. Suppofe it to bring 15 s. the 
ftone, there is ftill this confideration in favour of the ChevioS 
breed. The Galloway fine wool will take 14, 15, or even 16' 
fleeces to the ftone ; fuppofe, in general, 15 fleeces, the Che- 
viot breed in this parifh, though of the fmall kind, take 7t 
fleeces only to the ftone. It therefore follov»'s, that when 30 
Galloway fheep bring i 1. 10 s. for two ftone of wool, 15 
fleeces, and 15 s. the ftone, the Cheviot breed, in number 30, 
will bring 3I., four ftone of wool taking ']\ fleeces, and giv- 
ing 15 s. each ftone. 

It is afTerted that the XHheviot breed will require much bet- 
ter feeding, confequently more grafs than the natives of this 
country. This obfervation may be well founded ; but the 
queftion is, how far. and whether, upon this fuppofition, the 
Cheviot breed of fheep called the long flieep, may not be the 
moft advantageous ftock ftill ? 

Suppofe a farm holding 50 fcore, or loco fhort fneep, the 
natives of the country, fliould not be able to keep above 40 
fcore, or 8o3 of the long flieep, 50 fcore of fhort fheep will 
bring 37 1. 10s., at the rate of 7 s. 6 d. the ftone, 9 d. each 
fleece, taking 10 fleeces to the ftone ; 40 fcore of long fheep, 
taking 74 fleeces to the ftone, giving 13 s. the ftone, will 
bring Sol. Further, if 40 fcore of long, eat the grafs of 
50 fcore of fhort fheep, it may be prefumed that the long 
fheep 13 a fifth part ftronger in the bone, and, if brought to a 
like ftate of fat with the fhort, will, in their carcafe, weigh a 
fifth part more, give a fifth part more tallow, confequently a 
fifth part more money. Therefore the produce of 40 fcore 

of 



88 



Stat'ijllcal Account 



of long fheep, in point of carcafe, fhould bring" as much mo. 
nej as that of 50 fcore of Ihort fheep. 

It may be obferved that the {kins of llieep flaughtered at 
or after Michaelmas, are of confiderable value, and principal- 
ly from the wool upon them. But it has been already ftiown, 
that the wool of long flieep is i s. 3 d. the fleece preferable 
to the generality of the wool of this place. Suppofe, then^ 
40 fcore of long flieep call off annually for fale, fat weddera 
and ewes, and parking ewes 10 fcore, i s. 3d. each Ikin, 12 1. 
10 s. ; call it i s. each Ikin preferable to thofe-of the fhort 
Iheep, 10 fcore of Ikins, at this rate, will bring lo 1., which, 
together with the Sol. formerly mentioned as the price of the 
wool fliorn from off the long flieep, makes, in whole, 90 1. 
Therefore a farm holding 50 fcore fliort ftieep, and able to 
keep 40 fcore long, will advance the wool by means of the 
Cheviot breed, from 37 1. lo s. to 90 1. ; and the foregoing 
obfervations being juft, wiU, in other refpefts, be equally ad- 
vantageous. Suppofe fuch a farm brings of grofs produce 
from 50 fcore of fliort flieep ijo 1. annually, the fame farm, 
by means of the Cheviot breed, keeping 40 fcore, will, of 
grofs produce, bring 200 1. 

The writer of the above remarks has feen and examined the 
ftate in which the long flieep in this parifli are. He had an 
opportunity of feeing the wool, alfo the produce of the Che- 
viot hogs laft feafon, he has certain information of the price 
that wool brought ; and he believes, both from the general 
charafter of the Galloway fine wool, and from information, 
that he has not undervalued it ; that it is not higher, if fo high 
as the price ftated *. 

I fliaU 

* If the above profit is fo great, calculating the wool at 15 s. the ftone, how 
much more would it not be, if the wool had fetched its real value of jo s. the 
ftone ? And it is hoped that the Cheviot breed will foon be inrproved, fo as to 
produce v^ool worth even 30 s. the ftone. 



Of Barr, B^ 

I (iiali only add as a further proof of tlie experiment of thd 
Cheviot breed of llieep taking place in this parifti, and of their 
doing well, the farmer, whofe property they are^ is refolvcd 
to bring upon the fame farm, this enfuing feafon, fome fcores 
more ; and it is hoped others will fee it their intereft to fol^ 
low the example, to purchafe' into their refpeftive farms a 
number of the ;:heviot breed, lefs or more, as is mofl anfwer- 
able. Perhaps it might not be advifable to change the whole 
flock of the fliort fheep at once ; but by degrees, in this way, 
there can be no rilk Even bringing in ranis of the Cheviot 
breed, and croffing them with the ewes of the fliort iliee|)^ 
would greatly improve the wool of the pariflis

irv ALRY is faid to fignlfy " King's Valley." It gives 
a title to the Earl of Glafgow. It is about 9 Engli/h 
miles from N. to S., and nearly the fame diftance from E. to 
W. The village of Dairy, where the parifti church ftands, 
is fituated on the vpeft fide of the parifli, and is about a quar- 
ter of a mile diftant from the parifh of Kilwinning; in that di- 
redlion, the 2 pariilies being divided by a fmall water. Per- 
haps fome regard to waters was paid in the firll divifion of 
parifhes, and when bridges were not fo common as now thej 
are. From this fituation of the village and parifli church, 
many of the inhabitants of the parifli are obliged to travel 
to kirk and market from confiderable diftances. The village 
of Dairy is much admired by ftrangers for its fituation. It

is fituated on a rifing ground, with a commanding profped to 
the S. and an extenfive view to the N. E. It is almoft 
furrounded by waters, and thefe run in their different di- 
reftions, fo near the village, that when extraordinary rains 
fall, and waters fwell, the village, when viewed at a dillance, 
puts on the appearance of an ifland ; but from its elevated 
fituation, is never, at any time in danger, even from the 
greateft floods*. The foij varies much, according to the 
different fituations of the grounds. All the flat grounds lying 
along the water of Garnock, are in general a deep loamy foil, 
with a dry bottom, and from their being often overflowed 
with water, they are evidently enriched by the flime and 
mud left upon them ; and the farmer has often experienced 
good crops from this very circumftance alone. Trench plough- 
ing, or hand trenching of fuch ground, would aflTuredly turn 
out to advantage, as the foil below feems equally good, and 
with a fmall help of dung or lime, would foon become better 
than the upper foil, that has been long cultivated. But a

* Waters. — There are 3 waters that run near the village, CaafF, Rye, and 
Garnock. Ail thefe take their rife from the high moor lands, at feveral miles dift- 
ance from the village, confequently they are foon filled, run with great rapidity, 
and are foon emptied again. The 2 firft, empty themfclves into Garnock, near the 
village. And Garnock empti€S itfel/ into the fea at the bar of Irvine. From 
the rapidity of thefe different waters, and when much fwelled, great mifchlef 
is often done tp the flat grounds near the village, through which they run; fo 
that many fields of rich grain have been, in harveft, either laid flat on the 
ground, covered with wreck, or entirely fwept away when cut down. In har- 
veft 1791, moie than 20 acres were thus deftroyed and loft. Hereby, the value 
of fuch lands, however rich, is greatly leflened, as farmers cannot call their 
crops their own, till they are fecured in their barns. There are plenty of trouts 
in the above waters, generally of a fmall fize, and vary in colour, according t» 
the waters they are caught in. Some fea-trouts and falmon are caught in Gar- 
nock, but not in fuch quantities, as to bring much profit to the proprietor of 
the water, though the price of Intc years has adv.inced from i-^d. to 3d. the

trial of this has not been made. But the greatcfl; quantity of 
ground in the pariili, is of a very different quality, much in- 
clined to clay of different colours, and of a tilly, wet bottom. 
There is alfo a good deal of mofs-ground, not only in the 
llilly part of the parifli, but alfo in the lower parts of it. 
Some of which, has of late, by a fenfible procefs, been brought 
from its natural f^ate, to bear very good crops, both of oats 
^nd grafs, and t is, by digging it with a fpade in winter, and 
expofing it to the froft, ridging it up, and allowing pro- 
J)er drains and furrows, throwing fome quick lime upon 
it, and hajrrowipg it in with the feed : The digging repeated 
3, fometimqg 3 years, then fowing grafs-feeds upon it, either 
-with a view to eat or to fped, and from its not being former- 
ly worth a 6d., or indeed any thing, the acre, by this procefs, 
it has becoipe equal in value, to moft of the grounds that lie 
ground it. The expenfe of digging, ridging, and draining, 
does not exceed 2I, the acre the firft year, and il. 6s. the two 
fpllowing, Thq proprietors of fuch grounds, are fo fully 
fenfible of the advantages of fuch a procefs, that in a few 
years it is expefted, that a great part of them will be madq 
fit to hear v^ry good crops both of oats and grafs. 

himjion and Rents. — Within thefe 4Q years pafl, the great- 
eft part, if not almoft the whole of th^ parifti, has been en- 
clofed. When enploling firfl began, it was effedted with fome 
difficulty, as the adjoining heritors or tenants, were not only 
unwilling to bear half of the expenfe^ but could not think of 
being deprived of a liberty they had lopg been accuflomed to 
take, of paflui'ing their caftle upon their neighbour's ground, 
which was often of more advantage to their cattle, than feed- 
ing upon their own. But when they got the better of thefq

o!i!r prefervcd every man's property entire, but was ufeful 
to the ground itfelf, by keeping it from being potched in win- 
ter and fpring ; the enclofures keeping the ground warmer, 
and affording flielter to their cattle, both in the heat of fum- 
mer, and from the cold in winter. Senfible of thefe, and 
other advantages, enclofing went rapidly on, either at the ex- 
penle of the proprietor, or of his tenants. And fo eager 
have tenants been, for a long while paft, about it^ that they 
have not only their grounds in general enclofed, but properly 
fpbdivided, and fcruple not to pay the intereft of the money, 
the proprietgr of the lands lays out in fuch enclofings, even 
to J, and fometimes to 7i per cent., according to the different 
fences made. In the low part of the parilh, the enclofures 
are moflly ditches of different widenefs, and rows of thorns 
fom ttimes mixed with fome afh or beeches, which, when they 
thrive, give good flielter to the ground. The moor farms of 
the parilh, are all enclofed with ftone fences of different heights. 
The farms, in general, are not large in the low part of the 
parifh. They feldom exceed 60 1. in rent, and many let at 20 1, 
I'jL, and fome even l9wer. The moor farms being more ex- 
tenfive, let from lool. to 2Col., and even more. The grounds 
in the low part of the parifh, and that lie along the waters, 
are never vented below il., and fome fuch, ?ire alfo rented at 
il. los.: the acfe, and fometimes above that. The grounds 
^^djoining to thefe, and of a different quality, are, in genera],

Agriculture, &amp;c — The method of farming is a good deal 
improved within thefe 20 years. Before that period, farmers 
thought they could not plough enough, even though they 
had but too frequently, very poor returns for their work and 
expeafe. But they have feen their miftake. And every in- 
telligent farmer now among us, feldom thinks of opening his 
ground; till it has refted 4, and fometimes 6 years, and even 
then, to enrich it with dung or lime. Tenants, in general, 
are bound, and they look on it as no hardlhip, to have no 
more than a third of their ground in tillage. Their outfield 
land, which, in general, is weU limed (to the extent of i6q 
bolls an acre, and fometimes more, each boll containing 5 
Winchcfter buftiels) commonly produces 2 crops of oats, with 
a crop of rye-grafs fucceeding, and is afterward turned to 
pafture. The infield land or crofting, is that on which they 
lay moft of the dung they make from their own cattle (for 
dung is not to be bought) and raifc 3 crops from it, bear, 
oats, and beans, and then return to dunging again. As bear 
is a very uncertain crop, both by reafon of the bulk of the 
land being inclined to clay, and a wet bottom, and alfo to. 
the great quantity of rain that generally falls, about the end 
of fummer, and the beginning of harveft, this being the cafe, 
many farmers have adopted another method, and, I believe, 
much to their advantage, viz. of laying their dung upon their 
outfield or pooreft ground, allowing 2 acres about the fame 
quantity of dung, they would have given to i acre of bear, 
and taking 2 crops of oats, and fometimes i of rye-grafs hay ; 
and in this way, their future grazing crops on fuch land, are 
much improved, and the whole farm in procefs of time, is 
brought into a ft ate of improvement. And, as many are fall- 
ing

Jng in with this method, there is now very little hear raifed 
for the market, but only a fmall quantity for family ufe. In- 
deed, oats is the crop moft to be depended on by the farmer, 
as being a more hardy grain than bear, a more certam crop, 
and always commanding a ready market. Peafe are feldom 
fown. Though luxuriant crops of them can be raifed, yet the 
rains that generally fall about the autumnal equinox, lays 
them flat with the ground, to the lofs of both grain and fod- 
der. Beans are fown by many farmers, only in fmall quan- 
tities. From the grounds along the water, large crops are 
got. Wheat is not fown by the common farmers, though 
fome gentlemen in the parifti fow it in fmall quantities for fa- 
mily ufe, and have returns from 30 to 40 Winchefter bulhels 
the acre. It is fown after a fallow or potatoe crop, and the 
feed generally ploughed down with a fliallow furrow, and 
lightly harrowed. This method is preferred, as hereby the 
feed being deeper buried, winter or fpring frofts, are not fo 
ready to throw out the plants ; and it is alfo thought, that if 
the crop is luxuriant, by having a deep hold of the ground, 
it is not fo apt to lodge. Clover-feed^ are but feldom fown, 
A few who fow them, after proper preparation, have found 
great profit from them, both in enriching their hay crops, 
and adding greatly to the value of pafture-grafs. It can 
fcarcely be told, to what extent, an acre of good red clover 
will go, in feeding cows and horfes in the houfe, when 2 or 
3 crops are taken from it. There is furely no fuch cheap 
way of feeding horfes in fummer, and having plenty of milk 
from cows, as by allowing them red clover in abundance, not 
to mention the dung that is hereby faved. But, till cleanfmg 
the ground from weeds by fallowing, be more frequent than 
it is, little advantage will be gained by fowing of clover- 
feeds. Fallowing is not praclifed in this parifh by common 
farmers, but by a few gentlemen it is going on, and whether

it will iaflueace others to follow their cxatnple, time will 
ow. If they were to adopt it, certainly their grounds would 
be much better prepared for fucceeding crops. Flax is fowa 
chiefly tor family afe, and but feidom for market. Turnip, 
larmmg was only introduced into the parifh laft year. The 
gentleman who introduced it, has fucceeded, himfelf, in hav- 
ing a large crop, which probably will induce others to follow 
his example. Potatoes is a crop univerfally raifed by every 
farmer, but feidom to any further extent, than barely for the 
fcaaty ufe of his own family. But I have long thought, that 
every farmer might profitably confume, the double or triple 
of the potatoes, he commonly raifes. If he were to cultivate 
but one acre yearly, what a large provifion does he lay in for 
the fupport of man and beaft ? One acre, if properly culti- 
vated, will, on an average, yield 40 boUs, at 8 Winchefter 
bufliels the boll, each bufliel heaped. And even more bolls 
wiU be got, if the ground is good on which they are planted, 
and proper dunging and cultivation given. I have known a 
large family, nof under iq, plentifully fupplied for 6 months 
in the year, with a large quantity given every day to 2 or 
3 horfes inftead of corn in the winter months, and alfo to 
cows and poultry, and after all, felling 5 1. worth of them 
that remained, and all from the produce of x acre. No fuch 
valuable crop then can be raifed, and when freely given, will 
fatten cows, horfes, hogs, and poultry, to any degree you de- 
lire. An acre of potatoes of 40 bolls, at the low price of 
IS. the bufliel, is x61. It were to be wilhed, therefore, that 
farmers were more attentive to their interell, and plant more 
potatoes than they commonly do *. The implements of huf.

kandiy for carrying on the common method of farming, are 
but few : The old Scotch plough, drawn with 4 horfes ; a 
brake harrow drawn by 2 ; and common harrows for each 
horfe. A few have rollers for breaking of clods and fmooth- 
ing the ground. Some gentlemen in the parim who pradife 
fallowing and turnip-farming, have Englilh, and Eaft Coun- 
try ploughs of a light conftruftion, drawn by 2 horfes, and 
I man holds and drives the plough. But till the ground un- 
dergo a different cultivation from what it has yet done, and 
be cleared of ftones, with which it abounds, the old Scotch 
plough mull be better adapted to the prefent mode of culti- 
vatioH, than the Englifli plough can be. As the grain that is 
raifed in the parifli is, in general, confumed in it, and few 
farmers have much to want after maintaining their own 
families, this cannot be called a corn country, when fo 
little of their grain is brought to market. The parifli, m 
general, is better adapted for grafs than for corn. What a 
pity then is it, that better methods were not fallen on to im- 
prove the grafs ? This will not be done, till the ground be 
properly prepared by fallowing, cleanfed well from its old

the ground, at leafl, 3 different ploughings and harrowings, or till properly pul- 
verized, furrows are made with % horfes at the diftance of 3 feet, dung is put 
into the furrows, the potatoes are laid, then the furrow is filled up with the 
plough, by going down one fide and coming up the other, and thereby giving fuch 
a depth of covering as you choofe. An acre of potatoes can be covered in this 
way, with a fingle horfe and a fmall plough, in 6 or 7 hours. By the cultiva- 
tion the ground receives brfore planting, and 2 or 3 more ploughings after the 
plants appear, hereby it receives all the benefit that can refult from a fallow, 
with a rich crop to the bargain, and the ground in order for bearing fome clean 
and weighty crops. I know a field of about 10 acres, that after this cultivation, 
has been cropped for above 20 years, and the crops, in general, rich and luxu- 
riant. The dung of the farm is moftly employed on the potatoe crop, and the 
rotation of crops that follow, are, I. wheat, 2, beans, 3. barley, and if a little 
dung can be fpared, the better ; 4. oats, and then return to potatoes again, \ 
proper rotation of crops, is one way to fecurc fiicccfs to the farmer.

roots, and proper grafs-feeds thrown into it, It is by grafs 
that the farmer at prefent pays his rent ; all pains, therefore, 
Ihould be taken to improve it. For fome years paft, the pro- 
fits of the dairy have been great ; and it may be faid With 
certainty (if we except the moor farms) that the rents of the 
parifli are, in general, paid from the butter and cheefe made 
in it. The grazing fai-ms in the parifh, are e:np]oyed either 
in fattening Highland cows, to the extent of about 300, or 
rearing up young ones, for the tenant himfelf, or for others, 
and at the prices, from 12 s. to 15s. for i year old, and from 
20 s. to 24 s. for 2 and 3 year olds, and that from the ift of 
May to the ift of November. The flieep or heath farms in 
the pariflx are but few ; the ftock of the whole amounting 
to about 1200. The Iheep are of a fmall fize, and the wool 
not of a fin9 quality ; when fattened, are generally fold to 
the Paifley or Glafgow markets. Few fheep are kept in the

Coxvs and Horfes,-^Th^ cows and horfes kept by the farm- 
ers are in proportion to the extent of their farms. To do 
them iuftice, they do not overftock their farms, as in former 
times. They find it their mtereft, to keep no rnore catt . 
than they can fully maintain, otherwife, their l.orfe3 wonld 
not rife to the prices they are at, nor their cows g^^^^ "^^^^

with cows, he feldom thinks of going to market agam for 
more, but raifes up young ones to fupply the robin of thofe 
that are old, and keeps up his ftock by his own rearmg. The 
breed of cows is greatly improved from what they were. At 
prefent, the farmer can fell his cows from 61. to lol. Ster- 
ling, and fome even at higher prices. Having fo much de- 
pending on a good kind, they fpare no pains or coft to come 
at them. The young cows, now rearing in the parifli, may

been complained of, as a difoouragemfent to improvement in agriculture. About

Ihe horfes ralfed in the parifh are but few. Thofe kept by

where large quantities are fold of all fizes. They keep them 
for I or 2 years, and with the eafy work of ploughing their 
farms, with little more work they put them to, this with 
good feeding, raifes them to a large fize, and then they fell 
them, often at double the prices they bought them at ; and ia 
this way many farmers have confiderably iacreafed their 
ftock. Many fuch horfes have of late been fold from 33!. 
to40l. The amount of horfes in the parifli may be about

no Roman Catholics. The patron is Mr. Blair of Blair. The 
manfe and offices were built in 1766 ; the church in 1771 ; 
and an excellent fchool-houfe fit to accommodate ico children, 
with an houfe to the fchoolmafter, in 1790. All which build- 
ings are in good order and repair. The ftipend, one year 
with another, is about 97I., including 50I. Scots for com- 
munion elements, and exclufive of manfe, and a glebe of about 
7 Scots acres arable. The fchoolmafter's falary is 81 1. 10 s. 
Scots, he has a fchool-houfe, dwelling- houfe, and garden. The 
ground occupied for the fame, was a prefent of 1 2 falls, made 
by David late Earl of Glafgow, to the heritors, about the 
year 1725. The fchoolmafter has, at an average, about 60 
fcholars through the year. He teaches Latin, French, Englifli, 
and Arithmetic ; is feffion-clerk ; has the charge of the poor's 
money ; has perquifites from marriages and baptifms. The 
amount of his living, on the whole, may be about 30 1., a 
fum furely too inconfiderable to encourage a man of educa- 
tion and ability, to undertake fuch a laborious and ufeful 
charge. And it is to be hoped, that heritors, not only in this, 
but in other pariflies, will foon be inclined to hold out better 
encouragement to fuch an ufeful fet of men. There is alfo a 
private fchool in the village, which has, at an average, about 
30 attending it j befides fome private fchools in the country 
part of the parifli. — The number of po.or who are maintain- 
ed weekly from the poor's funds, may, at an average, be about 
12, befides others who are occalionally fupplied. They are 
fupported by the colleftions on Sunday, mortcloth money, 
and the intereft of a fmall ftock they have on hand. The 
yearly fum expended may be about 54 1. There has not been,

The pits are not deep, from 3 to 22 fathoms. Coals abound 
fo much in fome parts of the parilh, that farmers, in digging 
their ditches, often difcover a thin feam, which they dig out 
for the ufe of their families, and fometimes alfo in fuch quan- 
tities, as are employed in burning limeftones for their farms 
Limeftones alfo abound in many parts of the parifh, in feams 
of confiderable thicknefs. Thefe are fold at different prices, 
according to the trouble that attends the working them, and 
in proportion to the quantity of lime they produce. The low- 
«ft price is 3 d., and the highcil 7 d. for a cart-load,^ or as ma-

ny as one liorfe can draw. A clialder of lime, or 80 Win- 
cliefter buftiels, is generally got from 4 fuch carts. Farmers 
generally burn their ovm lime for the ufe of the farm. Lime, 
when bought from thofe who prepare it for fale, is got for 
6 s. 8 d. for the farm, and, when prepared for building, at 8 s. 
the chalder. Owing to the plenty and cheapnefs of lime, a free 
ufe is made of it by farmers, this being the only manure that 
can be come at, as no dung can be bought, and no marl as 
yet difcovered, fo as to become of general ufe. Peat alfo a- 
bounds in many parts of the parifh, fo that many farmers pro- 
vide themfelves with fuch large quantities, as to depend almoft 
wholly upon it for fuel. Peats, when fold, are at i4d. or 
jjd. the cart; and the cart is fo conftru£ted, as to hold a large 
quantity, no meafure being in ufe for fuch an article. They 
who live at a diftauce from the mofs, provide only a fmall 
quantity. Peats are generally employed in heating of milk 
for cheefe-making, and in drying all kinds of grain for the 
mill. There is plenty of iron-ftone in feveral parts of the pa- 
rifli, but none of it as yet wrought. 

MantifaBiircs. — Thefe are moflly confined to the village. 
Some years ago, when the lilk manufafture flouri(hed, there 
were above 100 filk weavers in the village, befides a few in 
the country part of the parilh ; and thefe were generally em- 
ployed by the filk manufafturers in Paifley or Glafgow. But 
row the number of fuch weavers is greatly reduced, and cot- 
ton weaving has become the chief trade of the place. I have 
"been at fome pains to find out the numbers of men, women, 
and children now employed in the different branches of filk 
and cotton working j and they are as follows :

Some more than a year ago, a few belonging to the parifl, 
began the fpinning of cotton on mule jennies, which they are' 
ftill doing, having 15 conftantly going, and a fmall carding 
mill which goes by water, for preparation. And as they 
mean to extend their work to the number of 30 jennies, they 
are now building a carding, mill on a larger fcale, to go by 
water, to anfwer the purpofe of preparation for the above 
muT.ber. The cotton yarn is not manufaaured in the place, 
but IS fent to the Paifley or Glafgow marli:ets. Thofe at pre- 
fent employed in the above work, including men, women, and 
children, may be about 50 ; and when the work is doubled, 
thofe employed will be in proportion. There is in the vil- 
lage, and country part of the pariQi, a fufficient number of 
common weavers, fhoemakers, fmiths, wrights, tailors, an^ 
Ihofe who fell grocery goods, and all kinds of men and women's 
apparp], 01' the belt and finell kind. And as to ale and whif. 
ky-houfes, of them there are more than is neceflary, to the 
great prejudice of the temporal intereft and morals of too 
manj , and efpetially of thofe who can, with eafe, earn from 
as. to 3s. a-day; the profperity of fuch perfons often de- 
llroys them. The village is a moft convenient fiiuation for 
jEanufaftures, on account of its healthy fituation, eafy rents, 
and cheap iuel, when compared with many places in the 
neighbourhood. And for carrying on a bleaching bufinefs, I 
fuppofe a more convenient fituaiion cannot be found, having 
fo many ftrtams of water all around j but nothing of this kind 
has as yet been tried. 



Population — According to Dr. Webfter's report, the num-

The above lift includes Seceders. 

in the country part of the parifli, the population has de- 
creafed during the laft 30 years, owing to the enlarging of 
grazing farms, by which many tenants and cottagers were dif- 
lodged. But in the above period, the village has increafed in 
population almoft double. And in the fame period, the pa- 
rifli has increafed in population, at leaft 300. And as the 
village has thus increafed in population, fo houfes have been 
built in proportion. So that how, a number of newflated and 
well finiflied houfes may be feen, fiiited to the manufadlures 
that are going on. 

Mineral Spring, &amp;c. — Some years ago, by boring in fearch of 
coal, was raifed a very ftrong fulphureous fpring, at 9 fa-

of a ruin, called a eiapel. fappofed to be a Romiflr one. Lately a cairn of 
fcones was removed from the top of a hili, called Lavvhill, and there was found 
uftone coffin containing human bones. About 16 years ago, on removing a 
large heap of ear.h and ftones, there was found a ft.ne cofEn. with 3 or 4 urns 
contarmng burnt bones. The urns are faid to have had letters or figures on 
f hem. but were broken by the workmen ift hopes of treafure. Camphiff, near 
the borders of the parifh of Largs, is faid to be the place, where the Scots amy 
under Alexander IIL encamped, previous to the battle of Largs 1263. Betweeii 
that and Largs is Routdon-burn, fuppofed to derive its name from a detachment 
of Kmg Haco of t)enmark's army, being there attacked and put to the ro=t

the banks of the Routdon-burn, is a large cairn, upon removing part of which 
lately was d.fcovered a ftone coffin. The knights Templars had lands in thil 
panfli, and are called Temple lands at this day.-Anciently, there were z 
churches in the parifh; the one on the eafl, the other on the weft of the viDage, 
and little more than a quarter of a mile diftant from the prefent church. With- 
in thefe laft 40 years pafl. the remains of the eall church have been feen by 
fome now living. The weft church, though no remains of the buiWing can be 
traced, yet from a piece of ground being there, ftiU caUed the old glebe, it is 
probable the church may have flood near to it. This old glebe, was exchanged 
about 3o years ago, for the prefent one. At what period the 2 churches were

and found to contain from 30 to 50 parts ,»f calcareous earth, and falls foon to

has been made. 

Mijcellaneous Obfervations — Tt is tbonght by many, that the Clyde and fea 
at Irvine or Saltcoats might be connedled with a Canal, and that from the level 
nature of the intervening ftrath, and plentiful fupply of water to be got from 
the lochs of Lochwinnoch and Kilbirny ; and as coal much abounds in many 
parts of that ftrath, it might be conveyed to thofe towns near to which the 
Canal might go, perhaps on much eafier terms, than otherwife they can be pro- 
vided, with many other articles that would be conveyed through fuch a long 
and fertile part of the country.— From the fmall number of flieep in the parifli, 
little attention has yet been paid to the improvement of the breed, or wool. In 
the flieep farms no attention has been paid. In the low part of the parifh, 
many farmers keep from 2 to half a-dozen of flieep, that feed with their milch 
cows, thefe are generally of a mixed breed between Scotch and Englifli, of a 
larger fize (from 12 to 14 lib. a quarter) and the wool of a much finer quality, 
than what is got from the fmall moor flieep, .and will bring one-third more when 
fold. I have known 10 or 12 Englifli pounds, and fometimes more, got from 
them. The number of fuch in the parilh, may be about 100. — Lately died in 
the parifli, a couple who had been married 52 years, both were above 80 years 
old, 16 hours only intervened between their deaths, and both were buried in 
one grave. Died in the parifli, in 17 89, a woman about 60 years of age. She 
had been thrice married* By her firft hufljand flie became pregnant, and her,

to open her. But he not coming at the appointed time, two perfons of fmall 
Ikill and experience, performed the operation in a coarfe manner, and could not 
give a proper account of the fituation in which they found the foetus. * They,

Extent, Soil, Surface, bV. 

THE city of Glafgow, and the barony parifli, till the year 
1595, made but one parifli. But population having 
fo much increafed, that it was inconvenient for the inhabi- 
tants of the town and country to meet in one place, they were 
at that rime disjoined ; and the landward part of the parifli, 
as diftinguiftied from the town, was called the barony. This 
parifli is both large and populous, extending from 2 to 5 or 6 
miles around the city of Glafgow, except on the fouth fide. 
The foil is various. In fome places it is a rich clay, in others 
a light fand : towards the N. and N. E., it is a cold clay, or 
fpongy and moorifli, but confiderably improved by the atten- 
tion paid to draining, liming, and a better mode of cultivation 
adopted by the farmers ; ftill, however, there is much room

and a free circulation of frefi, air, prove fo infectious, as .e '

to be more attentive than formerly to the cleanlinefs and ven-

and the dlfeafes incident to fedentaiy people. And the wea- 
vers, probably from the want of due circulation by the pref- 
fure of the feat, are very often affliaed with what they call 
fore legs, or bad ulcers in their legs, very difficult to be heal- 
ed. Lime-water has been ufed of late in many cafes with 
great fuccefi. 

Mineral Springs, and Minerals. —There are chalybeate fprings 
in different parts of the parifh, particularly on the fide of the 
river Clyde, above Rutherglen bridge. At Anderfton there 
is a fpring which contains one grain of mineral alkali or foda 
in the pint of water. And at Northwoodfide, there is a ful- 
phureous fpring upon the fide of the river Kelvin, which for- 
merly was often ufed, it is faid, with fuccefs, in fcorbutic dif- 
orders. But for a confiderable time paft no attention has been 
paid to it, and the water of the river now runs into it. This 
parlfti abounds with coal of an excellent quality, and fold at 
a very reafonable price, being laid down in the city of Glaf- 
gow, at the rate of 3 s. gd. the cart of 12 cwt. This cheap- 
nefs of fuel is of the utmoft importance to the comfort of the 
inhabitants, and the thriving of manufactures : And as the 
fields of coal in the neighbourhood are immenfe, it is to be 
hoped the price will always continue fo moderate as to pre- 
ferve to Glafgow the fuperiority fbe at prefent enjoys above 
moft places. Indeed, were the price of fuel to be raifcd fo 
high as to injure the manufaftures, the coal-owners themfelves 
would equally fuffer. The value of the coal produced from 
the different mines may amount to about 30,000 1. annually.

Manufaaurcs.^Th^ weaving manufaaure is carried on to 
a great extent in this parlfh, there being at prefent upwards of 
3000 looms employed. Within thefe 10 years, however, this 
branch of manufafture has undergone an almoft total ch'ange. 
Before that time, they were employed in lawns, fhirting, 
check, and handkerchiefs, linen handkerdiiefs for printing, and 
blounks, confifting of linen-warp, and cotton- weft, which were 
prmted for neck-handkerchiefs, gowns, and bed-furniture. 
But now they are almoft wholly in the muflin line, very few 
lawns or checks being manufaftured in this place. Though 
the muflin trade has been but lately eftablilbed, yet it has al- 
ready rifen to great perfeftion. And were the importation 
of Eaft India muflins in fome meafure reftrained, and the fine 
cotton wool brought home, it is impoflible to fay to what ex- 
tent this branch might be carried, and how much this coun- 
try 

have b«n fet up in the neighbourhocd of Glafgow. There are feveral ftrata or 
feamsof coal of di.Terent thicknefFes, and .at different diftances from one an 
ctl.er. Thefe all lie nearly parallel ta each other, but not parallel to the fur- 
face of the earth, having their dip, as it is termed by the colliers, or their de- 
cUnatioh towards the river Clyde, and rifing, as you retire from the river near' 
er to the furface of the earth till they crop out. And what is very remarkable 
the feams of coal on the other fide of Clyde, alfo have their dip towards its' 
bed ; fo that the ftrata on the different fides of the river, inilead of lying in the 
fame plane, are inclined to each other at a certain angle. In fome pits the 
ftrata of coal are of the foHowing thickneffes : ift, The upper coal frbm'4 to 
4^ feet th,ck : zd. Ell-coal from .i to 3 feet : And 3d, Main coal froin 4* to 
5i feet. Thefe are the only feams that have as yet been wrought. 'Above the 
coal there lies a thin but very rich ftratum of iron-ftone. Till within thefe 
few years that the Clyde iron-works were erecfled on the borders of this parift, 
the whole iron-ftone in this part of the country was difregarded, and fsmetiraes 
proved a great incumbrance. Now, it is a fource of wealth, and -iverem- 
ployment to feveral hands in this pariai. BeSdes coal and iron-ftone.^there are 
teds of very good free-ftone, particularly at Poffit, much ufed in the city of 
Glafgow for building and flagging the fides of the ftreets.' And on the eaft fide 
of the fir park adjoining to the city, there is a large whinftone quarry; whence 
all,the ftones ufed for paving the ftreets have been broiic^ht.

try might be benefited by it. But as the manufaftures of this 
parifti are immediately conneaed with the city of Glafgow, 
they will be more properly and fully treated of there. It is 
therefore unneceffary to fay any thing farther of them in this 
place. Only it may be proper to take notice of the improve- 
ments introduced by Mr. George Mackintolh, a gentleman 
whofe fpirited and fuccefsful exertions have been of the great- 
eft benefit to the manufaaures of this country, and by whom 
I have been favoured with the following account : The cud- 
bear manufaaure carried on here, under the firm of George 
Mackintofh and Co. was begun in the year 1777, occupying 
about \\ acres of ground, compaaiy built, and well walled 
round with ftone and lime. This is a manufaaure for mak- 
ing a dye-ftuff, now becoming an ufeful article, and employ- 
ed chiefly in the woollen and filk manufaaures of Britain, 
and is made from an excrefcence that grows upon rocks and 
Hones, a fpecies of the liechen or rock-mofs, which, with cer- 
tain chemical preparations, makes a dye-ftuff called cudbear. 
It was known and ufed as a dye-ftuff in the Highlands of Scot- 
land by the name of corkes or crottel, fome liundred years ago. 
But if vvas Meffrs. George and Cuthbert Gordon, (now Dr. 
Cuthbert Gordon), who firft attempted, and had the rnerit of 
bringing the procefs to a regular fyftem. They, in conjunc- 
tion with the MeflTrs. Alexanders of Edinburgh, ereaed a ma- 
nufaaure for it in Leith, in which they perfevered for feve- 
ral years. But it proved in the end unfuccefsful. Confider- 
able improvements have been made in" the manufaaure fignce 
its eftabliftiment in Glafgow. And the Company finding that 
the rock-mofs in Scotla'nd would foon be exhaufted , early fent 
a perfon of Ikill to explore the rocks of Sweden and Norway, 
whence they, for fbme time paff, import all they ufe. But 
there it is alfo beginning to be fcarce. Ruffia appears to pro- 
duce none of it. This naanufaaure confumes a very confi-

derable quantity of human urine ; above .coo gallons a-day. 
Ihey have about ijoo iron-bound cafks difperfcd among the 
iTianufafturing and tradefmen's houfes in Glafgow and fab- 
urbs. For each calk full they pay a certain price, which, with 
the expenfe of colkaing, cofts them about 800 1. a-year, for 
an article which formerly ran in wafte through the kennels 
and drains of the ftreets. The dying of Turkey red on cot- 
ton, though a very late difcovery in this kingdom, was efta- 
bhfixed m Glafgow earlier than in any part of Great Britain. 
In the year 1785, Mr. George Mackintofh being in London, 
fell in with Monfieur Papillon, a Turkey red dyer from Rou- 
en, carried him with him to Glafgow, and, in conjunftion 
with Mr. David Dale, built an extenfive dye-houfe at Dal- 
marnock in this parifti, upon the banks of the river Clyde, 
where cotton is dyed a real Turkey red, equal in beauty and 
folidity to Eaft India colours. There is another dyehoufe, 
equally extenfive, lately ereded for the fame purpofe, in the 
seighbourhood of this one, alfo in the barony parifh, under 
the management of Mr. Papillon, who is now connefted with 
another Company. At both places the Turkey red colours 
are now made in ggeat perfeftion. Bj means of thefe eftablifh- 
ments, the" ingenious and induftrious- manufadurers of this 
place are enabled to make cotton-pulicate handkerchiefs, e- 
qual in beauty and quality to any in the known world- And 
although the Meflrs. Bouilles (one of whom is fixed at Man- 
chefter) did obtain a premium from Parliament for the Tur- 
key red, the bufinefs was firft eftabliflied here; and fpecimens 
of manufadured pulicates of a fuperior colour, it is faid, were 
produced before a committee of the Houfe of Commons, (made 
by Mr. MackintoQi, who was the firfl: who manufadtured any 
here) while Mr. Bouille could only produce cuts of cotton- 
yarn done by him. It is now computed that there are above 
1500 looms employed iii this branch of . pulicate alone, iu

that when wove with brown cotton, or linen yarn, it re- 
Tifts and (lands the whole procefs of bleaching, and acquires 
more beauty and luftre by this trying operation ; and when 
.vrought in with bleached yarn, requires ^^ hours boiling m 
foap and afties, to reduce it to its vivid ftandard. Acids, 
which dearoy moft other reds, in a moderate degree, improve 
this. Making Turkey red is a moft intricate and troublefome 
procefs, requiring about 15 different operations in the com- 
mon CQurfe of dying. 

Near to the cudbear manufadure, is juft now commenced 
a bufinefs carried on by George and Charles Mackintoib, en- 
tirely new in this, or, we believe, in any other country. ^ It 
is the making of a newly dlfcoyered chymical preparation, 
which anfwers as a real fubft^t^te in dying and printing, for 
faccharum faturni, or fugar of lead and allum. It is hoped it 
will be an ufeful undertaking, as hitherto all, or by far the 
greateft part of the fugar of lead ufed in Britain has been im- 
ported from Holland. Thefe ingenious and economical peo- 
ple, though a duty of 3d. the pound is impofed on this ar- 
ticle when imported, and though receiving their lead from 
Britain, yet have hitherto been able to underfell all who have 
made any attempt of the fame kind in this kingdom. Mr. 
Mackintofli and his fon Charles intended this for a fugar of 
lead bufinefs ; but in the courfe of their experiments in that 
way, this improvement occurred to Charles Mackintofli, who 
is a very able chymift ; and the work is now entirely employ- 
ed tor this purpofe. They fupply the printers with this pre- 
paration at a lower rate than that which is ufually made from 
the Dutch fugar of lead. The principal printfields in the 
country have tried, are now ufing, and approve of it, as mak- 
ing an equally fixed, and, at the fame time, a more beautiful 
folour than that done in the ufual manner with fugar of lead

* In the year 17S4, a cotton mill was built at North Woodfide in this parifh 
by Mr. Wdliam Gaiefpie, which gives employment to about 400 perfons 1^' 
women and children. This, with the people engaged in the bleachfieid and' 
otherwife. has made Woodf.de a confiderable village, while it has become the 
feat of plenty and comfort, the happy confequence of induftry and manufac- 
tures Senfible of the advantages of religion and good morals, to promote the 
induftry and happmefs of the people, the benevolent proprietor pays particular 
attention to thefe. He has not only engaged a mafter to teach the children 
through the week, to read, but he has alfo fitted up, and fupports at his own 
5xpenfe, a place for public worfhip on the Lord's day, where a decent congre- 
gation regularly aflembles. And in the afternoon, the preacher publicly cate- 
chifes and inftruc^ls the children. The knowledge thus diffufcd among the chil- 
dren and the inhabitants of that part of the parini, is an honourable teftimony 
to the fidelity and diligence of Mr. James Steven the preacher ; and the good 
effecfts, it ij to be hoped, will extend, at leaft among fome, much farther than 
merely that regularity, fobriety, and induftry, which ferve fo much to promote 
their temporal profperity and comfort. The yarn fpun at this mill, employs 
about 450 weavers, esclufive of thofe who get their bread by winding, ftarch- 
ing, &amp;c. 

In 1771, the fame gentleman eftabliflied a printfield at Anderfton, which, 
with the bleachfieid, give employment to between 300 and 400 people. The 
cloth there printed, may employ 500 or 600 operative weavers. Befides thefe, 
there are feveral other bleachfields at Finniefton, Calton, Springfield, and other 
places, conducted upon the moft improved principles, and which give bread to 
a great number of perfons. About jo years ago, a very large brewery was 
credled near Anderfton, for brewing ale and porter, both for foreign and home 
confumpt. To fo great an extent do they carry on bufinefs, that near a pth 
part of the whole excife of Scotland has been paid by them. 

At Partick on the river Kelvin, there are very extenfive wheat mills eredled : 
the greateft part of which belong to the incorporation of bakers in Glafgow. 
The mills are well conftrudled, and much machinery introduced for the abridge- 
ment of labour. At the bakers wheat mills alone, at an average of the 4 laft 
years from May 1786 to May 1790, 3(5,113 bolls of wheat and a-half have been 
annually milled. 



Seed-time and Harnejl. — The time of fowing wheat, is from the middle of 
September to the middle of Odober ; oats, pcafe, beans, and flax, from tke

Hivifion and Rent of Zand. — The whole valued rent of the 
pariih, as ftated in the cefs-books for the county, is 13,000!. 
Scotch ; but of this 4000 1. is held by the College of Glafgow, 
as the teind of the archbifhoprick, for which they have ne- 
ver yet paid any public burdens. The heritors are 92 in 
number, of whom 59 refide in the pariili, either conftantly or 
occafionally. The farms are, in general, about 60 acres, 
though there are fome of 160, and fome as low as 20 acres. 
In the neighbourhood of the villages, a great deal of the land 
is rentad in very fmall parcels by the tradcfmen, for the pur- 
pofe of rearing potatoes, &amp;c. The foil being very different, 
.the rents are alfo different ; but from the fpirit for improve- 
ment which prevails, and the increafing demand in the city of 
Glafgow for the produce of the farms, the rents are every 
where rifing. The greateft part of the lard is enclofed, the 
face of the country much improved, and the tenants better 
able to afford a higher rent than formerly. At prcfent, there 



IS 



pjiddle of March to the middle of April ; potatoes and barley in May ; and 
turnips in June and July. The harveft generally begins about the middle or 
end of Auguft, and the crop is got totally in about the middle of 03:ober, ex- 
cept in cold and wet feafons. The price of grain and ^rcvifions in this parifli, 
is regulated by the Glafgow markets, and need not be here feparately ftated. 

The Price of Labours—The wages of day-labourers are, in winter, from 10 d. 
to IS., and in fummer from is. 2d. to is. 4d. a-day. Journeymen weavers earn 
from ICS. to 14s. a-week, and fome 20s. In harveft, the men's wages, a-day, 
for reaping, are from is. 4d. to is. 6d., and the women's is. ; both of them 
furnifh their own provifions out of their wages. Colliers earn from as. pd. to 
3 s. each (1-7 ; but are fo many days out of the pit, that they feldom, at an 
average, earn above 30 1. annually. The wages of domeftic fervants are, for 
men loL, and for women from 3I. tojl. a-year. A ploughman's wages are, 
in general, about lol. or 12I. ; but fome who have excelled at the plouj',!2ing 
matches, fome time ago introduced into this country, have got their wage» ad- 
vanced to 25!. a-year, befides bed, board, and wafliing, The expenfes of a 
common labourer's family, when married, are generally about ISl. a-ycar.

IS fome of the worft ground rented at los. the acre, and the beft 
arable land at 3I. ; garden ground is let at from 4 1. to 6 1. a- 
year. There are 3 different kinds of ploughs ufed, accordin'. 
to the nature of the foil; but the old Scotch plough is the moft 
common. 



Villages, Rents of Houfes, and New Houfes.—As manufac- 
tures are carried to a great extent in the city of Glafgow, their 
influence is felt on all the country round ; and a number of 
very populous and thriving villages have been built in this 
parifh. Thefe are Calton and Bridgeton, Grahamfton, An- 
derfton, Finniefton, ClayHap, North- Woodfide, Cowcaddens, 
Parkhoufe, Camlachie, Parkhead, Weftmuir, Shettlefton' 
Lightburn, Callendar and Denniftoun. In thefe, the general 
rent of the houfes is from a 1. to 5 1. a-year, though there are 
many much higher, and fome as low as 15 s. Within the lall 
ten years, 486 new dwelling-houfes or tenements, have been 
built : and of thefe the greater part have been ereded within 
the laft 4 or J years. It is to be obferved, that many of thefe 
houfes are made to accommodate 2, 3, or 5 or 6 families. 
None of the houfes erefted in the New Town of Glafgow are 
included in the Numeration, though the greateft part of it is 
fituated within the Barony parifli. 

Population — According to Dr. Webfter's report, the num- 
ber of fouls then was 3905. In the beginning of the year 
1791, there were living in the Barony parifli of Glafgow, ex- 
clufive of the whole of the New Town of Glafgow, 18,451 
perfons. The proportion of fouls to a family is 4*^ nearly.

of the burials, becaufe, though there are now three burying 
places in the parifli, yet a great part of the inhabitants are in- 
terred in the burying grounds belonging to the city. 

Public Houfes — In the beginning of the year 1791, there 
were 169 public houfes for retailing malt and fpiritous li- 
quors. The vaft increafe of thefe houfes is one of the great- 
eft injuries to the morals, the health, and the profperity of 
the inhabitants. In almoft every village, feveral low houfes 
of this fort are to be found ; and the confequences are at once 
both obvious and melancholy. If the number of virtuous in- 
habitants be the ftrength of a ftate, then enlightened policy 
fliould lead to the fupprefllon of many of thefe houfes, and 
particularly to difcourage the ufe of all' fpiritous liquors. 

Ecclefiajlical State of the Parifh, School, Poor, iSc The 

pariflb church is a part of that venerable building, the cathe-^ 
dral of Glafgow, and has been occupied by the Barony fince 
the year 1595. Being of an arched roof, which is low, and 
fupported by a great number of mafly pillars, it is exceeding- 
ly dark, dirty, and incommodious ; of this the heritors are fo 
fenfible, that a vifitation of the prefbytery has been called up- 
on it this year ; and there is fome probability of another 
church being built for the accommodation of the inhabitants. 
At Shettlefton, in the eaft end of the parifli, a Chapel of Eafe 
was ereSed about 50 years ago ; and there is another, as 
mentioned above, at North Woodfide, fupparted at the fole ex- 
penfe of Mr. William Gillefpie. Another chapel is much 
needed in the village of Calton, and, it is to be hoped, will 
be provided. At Anderfton, there is a Relief Church, built 
about 20 years ago : one Cameronian meeting in the Calton, 
and another at bandyhills, in the eaft end of the parilh. 
Though there arc many diffenters of difFerent denominations

* Though, from the above ftatement it appears, that the number of diflent- 
ers from die Eftabliflicd Church is very confiderable, yet, perhaps there are few 
p^rifties where lefs of a party-fpirit is to be found. The people of various per- 
fuafions meet in the intercourfes of fecial life, and even cultivate habits of in- 
timacy and friendfliip with each other, without fuffering their minds to be em- 
bittered with difputes refpedling their differences of opinion or profeffion. In 
this liberality of mind, they have an amiable example fet them by their mini- 
fters, who are men of good fenfe, learning, and piety. And it is with pleafure 
I do them the juftice to acknowledge, that the diflenters, in general, are as 
pious, virtuous, upright, indufttious, and refpeilable, as any in the parifli.

Roads and Canals.-.Ps\\ the great roads leading to the city 
of Glafgow, except by the two bridges on the S. fide, pafs 
through this parilh. They are all kept iil good order ; but 
on the N. fide of the city they have been originally formed 
upon a moft improper plan, being carried over the top of 
every hill, inftead of being led about the fide, which wotlld 
have been as fliort, and nearly level. The Great Canal be- 

tween 

diouS place of woraiip wiU be provided for the inhabitants. It is proper to 
mention, that by the care of the elders' in the diftribution, no airefTment has 
ever been laid on the heritors', to a greater extent, than the fum ftated atove ; 
and fome years no affeflment has been required. Before any perfon or family 
is admitted to receive any feffional charity, a ftrift examination is made into 
their employment, ftate of health, circumftances and earnings, all of wjhich 
are diftindlly entered into a book kept for the purpofe, and to which recourfe 
is had at any time, that the charity nrlay be economically and properly diftri- 
buted. The fums given by the feOlon, are, in many cafes, very inadequate to 
the neceflities of particular perfoas ; when this is the cafe, private contributicn-.S 
are made among their neighbours to fupply the deficiency, and a great deal of 
money is annually raifed in this manner, vrhich is always beftowed at the fight 
of the elder of the portion. Befides this, there are many charitable focie- 
ties ellablifhed in the pariHi, which afford much relief to tradefmen and la- 
bourers when laid afide from work by ficknefs. In general, the members, when 
in health, befides their firft entry-money, pay a certain fmall fum quarterly into 
the funds of the fociety, for which they are entitled to a weekly provilioti in 
ficknefs; funeral expenfes alfo are allowed, in cafe of death, and fome of them 
alfo give a certain allowaAe to the widow. Many tradefmen are members of 
fcveral of thefe focieties at the fame time ; fo that in ficknefs, they arcbettei" 
provided for than in health. Thefe focieties are of much advantage ; becaufe 
in this way, youth and health make a prcrvifion for old age and ficknefs. They 
are alfo friendly to the motals of the members, becaufe riotous, diforderly per- 
fons forfeit their right in the fociety, and, in general, they are cut off from any 
fupport in difcafes evidently brought on by intemperance and vice. Of thefe 
focieties, there are 1 5 in the parilh. Some of them diftribute annually from 
7 1, to aol., and one of them diftributes from 45 1, to 50I. In general, the mem- 
bers receive from 4s. to 5s. a-week, when confined to bed, and as. or 3s. when 
able to go about, but not to work. One fociety alfo, befides defraying funeral 
charges, giTes to the widow 10 s. yearly, for the education of any children un-

tween Forth and Clyde paffes through part of this parifli, as 
does alio that from Monkland. The Forth and G!jde naviga- 
tion was begun to be cut on the loth of July 1768, and was 
dpened as far as Stockingfield in this parill., icth July 1775 i 
atide-cutwas brought forward td Harruhon-hUl, November 
1777 where a large bafon was formed for the reception of 
veffels. and large granaries and other buildings erefted. They 
are now carrying forward this fide-cut, in order to form a 
junalon with the Monkland Canal, which runs eaftward 
through this pariOi to the collieries in Monkland parifh, and 
extends to 12 miles in length. On this fide-cut, a new bafon 
is to be formed at Hundred Acre Hill in this parifli, within 
half a mile of Glafgow; here granaries, and other buildings 
are to be ereaed, and a new village built, to be called Port- 
Dundas. The Canal was opened from fea to fea on the 29th 
day of July 1790, and is carried over four aqueduft bridges 
in this parifli. The great bridge over Kelvin was begun in June 
1787, and finiflied in April 1791. It is carried over a valley 
400 feet long, and 65 deep. It coniiils of 4 very large ar- 
ches of excellent mafon work ; is in height about 83 feet 
from the bed of the river to the top of the bridge, and is one 
of the moil ilupendous works of the kind perhaps in the 
world. The Canal is about 36 feet wide at the furface, and 
27 feet at the bottom, is 8 feet deep, and admits veffels of 19 
feet beam, and 68 feet keel. On the Canal there are 5 
locks in this parilh, within the fpace of 3CO yards, each lock 
is 74 feet between the gates, and 20 between the walls. 
There is alfo a very good dry dock for the veffels employed 
upon the Canal. 

General CharaBer of the People. — The general charafter of 
the people, as yet, is that of fobriety and induflry, though, from 
the great increafe of wealth, and the number of pubiic-houfes

for retailing- fpirltoua liquors, intemperance, with its Ion. 
tram of evils, is becoming more prevalent than formerly a 
-ong the labouring people. And it is to be lamented. Lt 
the cheapnefs of fpiritous liquors, and the increafing ufe 
ot them, many young people of both fexes are early corrupt- 
ed and ruined. Happy would ,t be for the health, the mo- 
rals. and the profperity of the people, if fewer public-houfes 
^ere l.cenfed. the ufe of fpiritous liquors checked, and good

r^ATRNY IS made up of the united pariflies of Botary-j

the county of Aberdeen. It is a part of the lordQiip of Strath,

given to Sir Adam Gordon. This was the original eftate 
of the family of Gordon. Since that period they have ex- 
tended their dominion from the to the W. Sea.

chitfly owing to their wifliing to refide in the neighboqring ma- 
nufaauring villages of Huntly and Keith. The manufaaurers 
there alv.'ays find employment for a number of fervants. The 
births are about ao yearly ; but indeed they cannot be well 
afcertained. Every perfon has his cliild baptized by his own 
paftor. They are carelefs of inferting them in the public re- 
gifter. The number of deaths cannot be known ; for there 
are three church-yards in the parifli : St. Peter's is indeed con- 
fidered as the moft holy ground, and confecrated to the Catho- 
lics. The difeafes are generally of the inflammatory kind. 
Some years the fmall-pox makes great ravages. The coun, 
try people are not yet reconciled to inoculation. 

Agriculture, &amp;c. — The foil is generally deep and good, efpe- 
cially in the lower part. If farming wpre encouraged, it is ca- 
pable of producing grain for exportation. The ground is ge- 
nerally let out in fmall tenements or crofts. Thefe are occu- 
pied by a number of tradefmen, who pay their rent by their 
bufinefs. The others breed fon e cattle ; but indeed their 
rents are chiefly paid by the women fpinning linen yarn. 
They always allot a piece of their land for fowing flax-feed, 
which turns out to great account. Were this branch attended 
to by the land proprietors, it would much increafe the riches 
and profperity of the country. The great tenants live upon 
their farms, but they depend efpecially on raifing of cattle. 
The parifli is tolerably well accommodated with grafs, Large 
quantities are fold yearly. It may be faid, that during win- 
ter, this parifli contains about 30CO black cattle. This is not 
a (Keep country, though there are many parcels in the parifli. 
The flormy winters are unfavourable to thefe animals. 

Mifcellaneous Ohfervations. — The people in the parifli of 
Cairny are naturally fober a.nd iuduftrious. The late incle- 
ment 



\

ncnt fegfons have run tl/em into arrear of rent, This hangs 
over, and much difpirits them. Were this paffcd from but in 
part it would give new life to their endeavours— Traditibn 
f.,ys, that fome of the hills in Cairny were once covered 
with (lately oaks. Now they prefent their nakednefs to e- 
very paffenger. Not one tree has been planted here for 6^ 
years, though the river and burn-fides are favourable to their 
growth. Hard wood is fcarce, which will hurt both the far- 
mer and manufaaurer.— Qood roads (which was the fo^u- 
dation of the profperity of the fouth country), are unknown 
here. Our mofs is exhaufted. The people muft go to Port- 
foy for coals, by a road fwarming with bogs and ftones. — In 
the ftatiftical account of this country, the mauufafturing vil- 
lages of Huntly and Keith ftiould never be forgot. They 
are the fources of much riches. They pay a great part of 
the landholders rent. Huntly promifes to, be the Paifley 
of the north. Here is a large importation of flax from 
Holland and Flanders. Here are bleachfields, weaving lin- 
ens and cotton; threads for Nottingham. It maybe faid 
that 5C0 1. weekly is in circulation for many months of 
the year. The town is incr-eafmg. The Duke of Gordon, 
the proprietor, is yearly giving off new feus. The town 
of Huntly is thriving amidft many difficulties. Portfoy, 
their fea-port, is 15 miles diftant. Thence they bring their 
fuel, though the road is many times almofl impaflable. 

ManuCadtures are of great importance in any country, 
and fliould always be encouraged. They enlarge our 
views, and introduce a fpirit of liberty. A manufaflurer 
has always incre liberal notions than a farmer. 

'X'he manufacture of linen has introduced a certain cleau- 
iinefs over all this country. It has almoft baniflied the itch. 
On a holiday, or at a fair, it is pleafant to behold the peo- 
ple well dreffed, ftiowing away «x their clean linen anti 
thread-ftocliings.

Name.. 

T^ITEEM (Wamha, a cave) is faid to have taken its name 
^ ^ from a remarkable cave in a high rocky bank near 
the parifli church, but of which, from the falling in of earth 
or fome other accident, no veftige now remains *.

• • This parifli is fo intermixed with thofe of Logierait, Dull, Fortingal, Ken- 
more, and Killin, that it would be to little purpofe to attempt a geographical 
defcription of it. The different parts of it are pretty accurately marked in Mr. 
Stobie's map of PerthJhire. From the uncommon manner in which pariflies 
are divided in the prefljytery of Dunkeld, in which this parilh lies, it would 
appear, that when parifhes were firft eftablifhed, every proprietor endowed the 
pariih church molt contiguous to his place of refidence, with the tithes of his 
own lands, at whatever diftance they happened to be fituated. This feems to 
be the moft probable reafon why the very neareft farm to the church of Killin, 
an one fide, is in the parifli of Weem, though at the diftance of 22 miles from

divifion of paiidies would be extremely inconvenient, both for the paftors and 
people were it not for the harmony that has always fubfifted among the for- 
' hier. Every clergyman performs the feveral fundions of his office to thofe who

aidus, and in foine cafcs a dangerous diforder. No change 
ih the way of living can account for this diforder being fi 
frequent. In the cure of the pleurify, an uncommon me- 
thod of cupping was Anciently ufed in this country, as well 
as in many other parts of the Highlands. The part affear^a 
•was {lightly fcarified witl^ a ta^or, iii the form of a circle, 
and the broad ehd of a krge co^ivr hbtn was applied ovet it, 
and a piece being cut off the top, 'it Was ftrotigly fucked by 
a perfbn's mouth, by which meaiis a confiderabb quantity of 
-blood was taken away, and often almoft immediate relief wa^ 
procured. Since the uf« of blifters and proper cupping ap- 
paratus havte been introduced, thiS aWkward method is, in

Sotl, Ptvduce, gtC.^Th^ foil of this parifli varies accord- 
•ing tb the different parts of the country in which it is fituat- 
-ed. The accounts given of the foil in the parilkes of Dull, 
gPortiitgal, Kfeiimore, and Killin, apply refpefiively to the 
parts of this parifli thkt are interwoven With thefe. The 
iiumber of ploughs is 7c, moft of them now drawn by a 
horfes. The number of carts is at leaft double that of ploughs, 
as many keep a cart who do not yoke a horfe in a plough. 
Tn the lower parts of the parifli, 10 acres arable may be 
reckoned a ploughgate ; but iii the higher parts, not above 
7 or 8. There are fowh annually in this parifli, 500 bolls of 
oats, Linlithgow meafure, which yield, at an average, four- 
fold 5 i'95 bolls of barley, or rather bear, yielding about fix- 
fold ; peafe, 40 bolls, yielding three-fold ; potatoes, 125 bolls, 
yielding twelve-fold ; and 15 hogfheads of flax feed, yielding

between 3 and 4 ftones the peck of fcQtched flax. The whok 
ot this flax IS dreffed in water mills, which are eredted in 
different parts of the country. The owner of the lint pays 
IS. 4d. the ftone, for dreffing it at the mill. The whole of 
the flax, except what is necefTary for linen for the people 
themfelves, is fpun into yarn of 4, 5, or 6 hanks from the 
pound weight, and fold in that ftate to manufadurers m 
Perth and Glafgow. There is a good deal of lime ufed for 
manure ; and were it not for the fcarcity and expenfe of fuel 
to burn It, there would be much more ufed, as the limeflon* 
IS in great plenty in moft places of this country 3 and as it i^ 
invariably found to fucceed wherever it can be procured. 
Dung of the cattle and horfes is almoft the only other ma- 
nure ufed here. No marl has been difcovered. There have 
been of late years, a few patches fown with turnips, and af- 
terward laid down with clover and rye-graf$ feeds, and both 
hay and turnips have anfwered very well. Turnips and po- 
tatoes are laid down in drills, and carefully hoed. There is 
very little of the ground enclofed or fubdivided. March-fences, 
and head-fences to feparate the arable from the pafture grounds^ 
have been built in moft places within the laft 30 years.' Be- 
fore that period, the whole might, for the greateft part of 
the year, be confidered as a common; but now, in. moft 
places, marches are ftridly obferved to the very tops of the 
mountains. 

Animals — Quadrupeds of the wild kind, are, a few red 
deer, roes, foxes, hares, wild cats, martins, otters, badgers, 
polecats, weafels, ermines, and moles. The foxes, before 
the year 1760, made great havock among the flieep, goats, 
&amp;c. ; but from that time, regular fox-hunters have been em- 
ployed at fixed falaries, by whofe diligence and fkill vaft num- 
bers of foxes have been deftroyed ; fo that their number is

now greatly reduced. Eagles, hawks of various kinds, ravens, 
hooded crows, and kites, breed in great numbers in rocks 
and woods ; and deftroy lambs, and a great deal of game and 
poultry ; and yet there has been no public, and Scarce any 
private encouragement given for their deftruftion. Whde 
the game laws are fo fevere, that fhepherds, and others, whofe 
occupation leads them to the places where thefe deftruftive 
creatures moft abound, dare not carry a gun or kill a fmgle 
moorfowl, no great efFeds can be expefted from any plan 
laid down for 'deftroying birds of prey, though it may be 
fafely averred, that one of thefe will deftroy more game m 
a feafon, than 10 fhepherds would do, though they were at 
pevfea liberty to kill as many as they could *. 
' There are in the parilli 1236 head of black cattle, and 290 
horfes. Cows are worth from 2I. los. to 5I., according to 
the part of the country in which they are bred, thefe in the 
alens being of greateft value. Horfes coft from 5I. to 15L 
before the introduftion of flieep-farming, a great many fmall 
horfes were reared in the hilly parts of the country; but now 
moft of the horfes required in this parifli, are bought from 
Argylefliire, or from the Low Country. 

There are about 8000 ftieep, befides the ufual proportioa 
pf lambs' and year- olds. Thefe are moftly of the Lammer- 
moor breed. A few of the long Englifli kind, and alfo of 
the Cheviot breed, have been introduced; but we have not

fnipes, partridges, and dotterels. Malards, gulls, and other water fowl come 
to hatch in the lochs. Birds of paffage are, cuckoos, woodcocks, fieldfares, 
bullfinches, and fnowflakes. A few of thefe laft hatch in our higheft moun- 
tains. Birds that are not reckoned game, birds of prey, or migratory birds, 
are, rooks, magpies, jays, daws, woodpeckers, ring ouzels, water ouzels (very 
deftruftive to the fpawn of fifli) thruflies, blackbirds, larks of fevcral denomi- 
nations, linnets, and a great variety of fmall birds.

not they will anlwer with our pa.fture. Ewe and Iamb feU 
for I2S. or 14 s., 3 jear old wedders at about the fame price, 
and younger flieep i^ proportion. The wool is, in general! 
coarfe, and fetches only between 7 s. and 8 s. the ftonc tron i 
7, 8, and even 9 fleeces go to the Itonetron. What is not ma^ 
nufadured for the ufe of the inhabitants, of the wool, is fent 
to Perth, Stirling, and Alloa. Before fneep-farming was in^ 
trpduced, about 30 years ago, we had a fmall fpecies of {keep 
with white or reddifli faces, and fine wool ; but thefe weri 
confidered fo much inferior to the black faced kind in the 
fize of the qarcafe (the only objed attended to tiH of late), 
that the race is either adulterated or extirpated. Many of 
the moft fenfible flieep farmers begin to regret this, as they 
now perceive that the difference in the value of the wool, and 
in the great number of the fmall flieep that might be kept 
on the fame pafliure, would more than compenfate for the 
difference in the weight of the carcafe. Till the period above 
mentioned, flieep were confldered as of littl^ value in this 
country. Farmers kept only as many as were fufficient to 
clothe their families and afford them a little mutton, aa there 
Vjiz,^ v^ry little demand for either wool or mutton from other 
countries. There were befides, feveral circumfl:ances in the 
management of flieep that prevented their thriving. They 
were thought fuch tender animals, that they could not be left 
■vyith fafety to lie in the open air during the night in winter. 
Independent of this prejudice, the number of foxes rendered 
it a neceflary precaution to houfe them at night. The lambs 
were allowed to come too early in the feafon before the ewes 
had any new grafs. There was indeed no winter grafs re-. 
Served for them. From the. middle of May they were milk- 
ed every morning, the lambs being feparated from them over- 
night, till about the end of June, when theiambs were wean- 
ed.

This prevented tte lambs from ever coming to their full 
Ai'e The ewes continaed to be milked evening and morn- 
,'ns till the end of September, being for moft part of that 
time confined all night in very narrow folds. It is now be- 
lieved by very judicious farmers,, that the old fpecies with 
the fame treatment, would prove full as hardy as the black- 
faced kind, and that 5 of them at leaft might be kept on ^he 
fame grafs that is fufficient for 4 of the other,

one can judge of the population of the parifli, as a great proportion of both 
marriages and baptifms are regiftered in the pariflies of Killin and Fortingal, 
that belong to this parifli. There is no regifter of burials kept, nor would it 
indeed be eafy, as the people in this country do not bury either in the nearefl

Rent, Heritors, &amp;c._The valued rent of the parlfh is 
1613I. Scots, the real rent about 1650I. Sterling. The whole 
panfli, except one farm belonging to Mr. Menzies of Cul- 
dares, is the property of two heritors, the Earl of Breadal- 
bane,. and Sir John Mcnzieg of Menzies, Baronet. Sir John 
Menzies is patron, and has his principal refidcnce at Caftle 
Menzies in this pariih, where he refides for a part of the 
year. It is a handfome edifice built in the form of a caftle 
%vith turrets, &amp;c. It was built in the year 1571. The grounds 
around It were greatly adorned by the late Sir Robert Men- 
:ties, with gardens, plantations, and beautiful walks. It is 
fituated under a moft beautiful bank, which is covered with 
trees of various kinds, and is of confiderable length and 
height, having an extenfive plain in front towards the fouth, 
which is divided into a number of enclofures. Here are 
likewife 2 orchards, which yield q great quantity of apples, 
pears, cherries, and the fineft of geans both black and red! 
The Earl of Breacialbane's kitchen garden is alfo in this pa- 
rifli, and yields a good quantity of fruit of diJFerent kinds 
pn the walls and efpaJiers, and a great variety of vegetables 
for the table in high perfedlion. 

Church, Manfe, Stipend, School, Poor.— The church was 
|3uilt, according to an infer iption above the door, in the year 
1609, and repaired in 1752. When it was firft built, and

leaft compenfates for that decreafe. There are no diflenters from the Eftablilh- 
ed Church of any denomination. Servant^s wages are increafed rapidly foj 
fpme years paft. In the year 1778, a man feryant got 3I. and maintenance, 
who now gets 61. or 7 1.; a maid fervant's wages have rifen during the fame 
period froni il. 10 s. to 3I. in the year, and all labourers and tradefmen's wages 
in proportion.

many years afterward, it was fully fufficient to contain all 
Jhe congregation that affembled to it ; but fince the know- 
ledge and praftice of true religion h^ve been more widely 
diffufed, the church is by much too fmall for the congrega- 
tion, eipecially in the fummer months, when at leaft a fourth 
pf them are obliged to fit without, the windows bemg thrown 
open, and a great many old and infirm people obliged to re- 
main at home, who cannot venture to fit in the open air. 
Two-thirds at leaft of the congregation are from the parifties 
of Dull, Logierait, and Fortingal, their own parifh churches 
being at too gr^at a diftance. The manfe was built in 1744 ^ 
and had fome reparations fince, but is ftill the moft inconve- 
nient manfe in this country. The glebe is about 3! acres 
arable, of a good light foil, and about an acre of pafture and 
meadow, befides a garden \ of an acre. The living, exclu- 
five of the glebe, was formerly 36I. 3 s. 7 d. Sterling in mo- 
ney, and 32 bolls, Linlithgow meafure, half oat meal, half 
bear. Laft fummer-feflion (1792) it was augmented to 64 
bolls vidlual, and 661. 3s. 7 d. money, including communion 
elements *. — There is a fchool maintained by the heritors.

• It was ufual for the minifters of Weem and Keflmore to officiate, the lat- 
ter every 5th Sunday, and the former 4 times i-year, at Lawers, on the north 
fide of Loch Tay, where there is a pretty good chapel built by the Earls of 
Breadalbane. About a years ago, the Society for Propagating Chviftian Know- 
ledge, out of a fund bequeathed them by the late Lady Glenorchy, for the pur- 
pofe of encouraging religion and induftry on the eftate of Breadalbane, fettled 
a miflionary minifter, who officiates alternately at Lawers, on the north fide, 
and at Ardeonaig on the fouth fide; of Loch Tay. The Society allow him 20 L 
a-year, and the Earl of Breadalbane as inuch, with a houfe and a piece of land 
in name of a glebe. This eftabliftiment precluded the necerflity of the miuifters 
of Weem or Kenmorfe preaching at Lawers, and the minifter of Killin from: 
preaching at Ardeonaig. The minifters of Fortingal and Weem, ftill officiate! 
in Glenlyon, the fbrmer once in 5 or 6 w4eks, the later 5 or (5 times a-year, at

The lalary was only 61. 133. 4d. Sterling, tilt this yea/ 
(1793) that the heritors have, of their own free motion, 
raifed it to iil. as. s^d. This, with fchool-wages, feffion- 
clerk's fees, &amp;c. may amount in whole to 24 1. There is a 
good fchool-houfe, fchoolmafter's dwelling-houfe, and a fmall 
garden *.~There are few poor in this parilh, and they are, 
for the moft part, fupported by their own induftry, and occa- 
fional fupplies from the pariih funds. There are at prefent 

1 2 per- 

a pWce about 20 ftatute miles from the church at Weem. There is a good 
chapel built there a few years ago, by the voluntary contributions of the inha- 
bitants of that valley, and fome fmall donations from a few of the neighbour- 
ing gentlemen. Tlie inhabitants of Clenlyon, about a fourth of whom are in 
this parifh, have been remarkable for honefty, induftry, and fobriety, for many 
generations, before the furrounding countries were brought to the ftate of ci- 
vilization they are in at prefent. This muft be attributed to two concurring 
caufes ; rft, The pioprietors of this valley (the Campbells of Glenlyon) were 
themfelves, for many defcents, men of great integfity, and encouraged fuch of 
their retainers only as were of the fame difpofitioir. zd, A fpark of religioiy 
was early kindled among them, which being, for a little time, confined to a fe\r 
families, has long ago diffufed itfelf o«er the whole valley. The religion of 
thefe people is not of the fpcculatlve difputatious kind, but fnch as influences 
the whole of their condudl in their intercourfe with mankind. 

* There are likeWife 3 other fchools fupported from a fund of 6000 merks 
Scots, mortified for that purpofe by Mr. Archibald Campbell, firft Prelbyterian 
minifter of this parifli, who was admitted about the year I703. The intereft 
of that fum only, is employed according to the deed of mortification, for the 
maintenance of 3 fchools in the moft remote parts of the parifli, e. 5 1. 11 s. 
ijd. to each of the 3. T^i^ funi, at the time it was firft given (about the 
year 1740) was fr.fficient for fupporting a lad to tearh for 7 months in the year, 
■which at that time was all that was required, as the people difperfed through 
the hills with their cattle in the month of May, and the fchools did not con- 
vene till after the harveft was Cnifted. Since flieep farming was introduced, 
the people regain at home the whole 3-ear, confequently the fchools would be 
of the fame confequence in fumraer as in winter. The Society for Propagating 
Chriftian Knowledge, allow one of thefe fchools 5I. a-year (that at Roro in 
GienJyon) in addition to the former fakry, which enables the fchoolmafter ta

girls go annually to the low country for fervice, and of late 
to the cotton-works, many of whom fettle there. — There is 
only one inn in the pariOi, and five ale-houfes, or whi{ky- 
houfes. Thefe laft are very little frequented but at weddings, 
markets, and other public meetings.— The Gaelic language

is generally underftood ^Peats, which are made at a confider- 

able expenfe, carried from a great diftance, and in many pla- 
ces becoming fcarce, are the only fuel of this parifh. There 
have never any attempts been made for finding coal, though 
it is faid there are favourable appearances of them in the 
Earl of Breadalbanc's lands. His Lordlhip has it in contem- 
plation to caufe a fearch to be made. The greatell hindrance 
to improvement in agriculture, atifes from this fcarcity and 
fcxpenfe of fuel, as thereby the farmers, in many places, 
are precluded from burning any lime for manure, though 
the limeftone is in great abundance, and the greatefl: part 
of the fummer, which might be profitably employed in fal- 
lowing, draining, enclcfing and making different kinds of 
compoft for manure, is entirely fpent in catting, drying, 
and carrying home peats. More horfes and carts are like- 
wife defiroyed in this work, than by all other farm-la^,

ral, is the want of leafes. W hile a man poflelTes a farm

Royalty, Exte7itf Climate, l^c. 

CULLEN, as appears from old charters, was originally 
called Inverailan, becaufe it ftands upon the bank of 
the Burn of Cullen, which, at the N. end of the town, falls 
into the fea : but now it is known by the name of Cullen on- 
ly. Cullen is a royal burgh, formerly a conflabulary, of 
■which the Earl of Findlater was hereditary conftable. The 
fet, as it is called, of the council, confifts of 19, in which num- 
ber are included the Earl of Findlater, hereditary prefes, 3 
bailies, a treafurer, a dean-of-guild, and 13 counfellors. The 
parifh extends from the fea fouthward, about 2 Englifli miles 
in length, and about i mile in breadth. The annexed part 
of the parifh of Rathven, quoad facra, is of extent about 3 
miles in length, and 1 in breadth, forming together the figure 
pf a quadrant, Laving a ftraight line on the N. and E. and

the fegment of a circle on the W. and S. The face of the 
country is neither hilly nor flat ; in general the fields have 
an eafy gentle lL)ptr. Trie foil is of 3 kinds-; the greateft 
part is a fine rich loani, upon a foft clay bottom ; fome fields 
of a ftrong rich clay, and a few of a light loan:, upon a tilly 
bottonn. As the fields in general are dry, and as the hills in 
the ne-ghbouring pariihes of Rathven and Dcfkford attraft thq 
clouds and vapours that arife from the fea, the air of this pa- 
rirt; is pure and extremely wholefome ; as a proof of this, ma- 
ny of the inhabitants live and enjoy comfortable health, till 
far pad 80, and feverals above 90 years. And no local or epi- 
demical diftemper has been known to prevail in the memory 
of any perfon alive. Even the fmall-pox, in the natural way, 
is become mild, and in no proportion fo fatal as in former 
times ; but this may be owing to the greater degree of clean- 
llnefs among the people, and learning the modern treatment 
of that loath fome diftemper. 

Agriculture. — The farms are fmall, from 5 1. to 50I. of 
rent, and the fine field about the town is let in fmall lots, to 
accommodate the inhabitants. Although the foil is fit to pro- 
duce any kind of grain, yet the crops generally raifed arc, 
oats, barley, peafe, beans, turnip, potatoes, fown grafs and 
flax. Flax feems to be a precarious crop upon the eaft coaft 
©f Scotland i the foil and climate are too dry for it, but in a 
moifl feafon there are good crops. This obfervation might, 
perhaps, be worthy the attention of landholders and fdrmers 
in moifter climates, where crpps of corn are more precarious, 
to encourpge the culture of flax; efpecially as it is an early 
crop, and fit for pulling before the feafon of the mildews, fo 
fatal to grain, generally fets in. The average rent of the land 
is from 10 s. to a 1, 10 s. the acre. The only plough ufed

Fineries.— I^i^ fea affords plenty and variety of fifties, 
haddock, whiting, flounders, mackerel, holybut, turbot, cod, 
ling, tufk, ikate, dog and cat. The only ftiell-fifti in abun- 
aaoce is crab and lobHer, which laft are caught in great quan- 
tities, and of late fent to the London market. There ate two 
fifhing villages, one at the north end of the tov^n of Cullen, 
where there are 7 fiftiing boats ; and one called Fbrtknockies,' 
2 miles weft of Cullen, in the anneked part of the pdrifti of 
Rathven, where there are other 7 boats. Each boat has 6 
men ; by whofe induftry the town and country aroiind are am- 
ply fupplied with good fifh. Befides what is fold daily, the 
fiftiers cure and dry a confiderable quantity of cod, ling, lliate 
and haddocks, which, after ferving th*e country, they carry to 
iVTontrofe, Forfar, Dundee arid Leith, where, befides their oil, 
each man fells at an average, 10 1. value of fifti ; arid they 
bring home hemp, wool, and fait for their o'wn ufe, 

Manufaaures.—^ddrk the year 1748, t^e inhabitants of 
duUen were as poor and idle as any fet of people in the north. 
There was no induftry, trade, nor mafiufafture among them : 
their only employment was to labour a few acres of land, and to 
keep tippling houfes ; and often to drink with one another^ 
to confume the beer for want of cuftOmers. The late Earl of 
Findlater, that true patriot, pitying the fituation of the people, 
refolved to introduce the linen man"ufe£^ure among them. 
And here, perhaps, it may not be improper to mention the 
method he adopted to promote this purpofe. He brought %• 
or 3 gentlemen's fons from Edinburgh, who had been regu- 
larly bred ihfite to tlie bufinefs, and who had fome patrimony 
of their own ; but, for their encouragemerit to fettle fo faf

north, he gave to each 600 1. free of Intcreft for feven years-; 
after which, the money was to be repaid by 50 1 yearly, the 
remainder in their hands to be always free of intereft. Be- 
fides this, he built excellent weaving (hops, and furnidied 
every accooimodation at very reafonable rates : and as his 
lordfhip prefided at the Board of Truftees at Edinburgh, he 
obtained for his young manufadlurers, premiums of icoms, 
heckles, reels, and fpinning wheels, with a fmall falary to a 
fpinning miftrefs. So good a plan, and fo gre^t encourage- 
ment, could not fail of fuccefs. In a few years, the n.anu- 
fafture was eftabliftied to the extent defired. All the young 
people were engaged in the bufmefs j and even the old found 
employment in various ways by the manufaftures : and thus 
a fpirit of induftry was diffufed over the place and neighbour- 
hood in a very fliort time, which foon appeared in their com- 
fortable mode of living, and their drefs. Th^ manufafture 
here, as well as in other places, has had its vicifStudes, owing 
to good or bad markets and demands ; but ftill it continues 
on the whole in a comfortable ftate. There are in this fmall 
place 65 looms, conftantly employed in weaving linen, fome 
few of them in weaving damalk. The manufa£lurers alfo 
give out a great number of webs to be woven by country 
weavers in their own fhops. There are alfo 7 flocking looms 
conftantly employed. 

Population. — According to Dr. Webfter's report, the popu- 
lation then was. 900. About 100 years ago, at the average 
of 7 years, multiplying the baptifms by 26, the number of 
people in Cullen, and the annexed part of the parilh of Rath- 
ven, amounted to 806. 60 years fince, by the fame rule, the 
number was 1040, but the accuracy of the regifters, I am a- 
fraid, cannot be depended upon. By a lift taken in 1791, 
tlie number of fouls in the parilh'of Cullen, and the annexed 

part

in the parilh of Cullen 5 of t'"*^^^' "^^^"^

iBales 2,4. Of the above numbers in Cullen, and the annex- 
ed part of Rathven, there are under 7 years of age, males 140. 
females 115. The increafe of the populat:on has been onl^ 
in the town of Cullen, and in the fea-towns of Cullen and 
Portknockies : for during the periods of the above average, 
calculations, there were feveral farms well peopled, which, 
after that, were enclofed for the Earl of Findlater's own ac- 
commodation, and are fince uninhabited. The average of 
baptifms annually, is about 45, marriages la. The bulk of 
the people are of the Eftabliflied religion. Before the year 
,782, there was not one Catholic in the parilh, at prefent 
there are about 30, and 8 Epifcopalians,

Earl allows a houfe free of rent, and the fuel, to fuch of the

ray-frith to the N. To the W. of the houfp there is an excellent bridge of one

would be by no means an adequate fupply for fuch a number 
of poor, if Lord Findlater did not only give 10 bolls and a fir- 
lot of meal yearly to be diftributed by the church feffion, but 
alfo appoint fupplies of meal and money for all their exigen-

W oods — It may not be improper from Cullen, the prin- 
cipal feat of the Earl of Findlater and Seafield, to take a ge- 
neral view of the immenfe plantations of trees made by that 
family. Before the year 1744, little in that way was done. 
The whole country, and even about Cullen houfe, was naked 
and deftitute of cover or ornament from trees. Since the 
above period, it appears by attefted lilts before the writer, 
that the Earls of Findlater have planted upwards of 800Q 

Scotch 

the cuftoms at Invemefs, and his fon bailie William Ogilvie, merchant in Banff", 
bequeathed the fum of 44 1. 9 s. Sterling, the intersft of which is to be applied 
by the church-feflioii of Cullen, for behoof of their poor relations, and the poor 
of the parifli in equal parts. James Ogilvie, formerly wadfetter of Logie, be- 
queathed for behoof of the poor of the parilh of Cullen, the fum. of 300 merks 
Scotch. 

* Although the whole produce of grain in the parilh is never fufficient for 
the confumpt of the people, yet meal is always here in as great plenty, and as 
good in quality, and as cheap, as in any part of Scotland ; owing to the atten- 
tion of Lord Findlater and his managers. 20 or 30 years lince, eggs fold ^4 for 
a penny, now they are 2 d. for 12. Hens, which were fold for 4 d. each, now 
give 7 d. and 8 d. Beef and mutton, which ufed to fell from i d. to a d- the 
pound, now fell from d. to 4 d. the pound. Haddocks, which were from i d. 
to jd. the dozen, fell now at 7 d. and 8 d. the dozen, and other articles jn pro-

an Jounthefore me, atteftedb, Mr George 

Brown, furveyor of land at Elgin, and fador - Lord Find 
later there. " To fliow in fome degree the Value of Lord 
Findlater's plantations, and the very rapid progrefs they make 
in this country near Elgin, there was a good deal cut out of 
one plantation of common firs, to make room for more va- 
luable and ufeful trees , many of thofe cut out mea ured of 
girth . feet lo inches and 3 feet, and fold at 3d. Sterling the 
tree, and, in general, when fawn down the middle, are large 
enough for paleing and oth^" ufes. This is a fingular m- 
ftance of wood only planted 18 years, and fhows the great 
wealth that will accumulate from thofe plantations." 

Mountains. is only one remarkable mountain called 
the:Bin-hiU ; it has two tops, the one higher than the otiier, 
it lies' about a mile S. W. of the town of Cullen, about two 
miles from the fea, and ferves as a land-mark to the fifliers. 
Its elevation above the fea is faid to be from 1000 to 
feet. It was formerly covered with heath, but is now plant- 
ed with treefe.

Advantages and Lif advantages. ~Thi town of CuUen, by 
Its fituation, has many advantages. It lies on the poll road 
which is kept in good repair. It has, in general, good fchools.' 
It has the advantage and accommodation of a poft-office, a 
pretty good butcher market, plenty of all the neceffaries'of 
life fupplied from a rich country, on the one hand, and an 
ample fupply of all kinds of filh from the fea, on the other 
with command of plenty of mofs for fuel, the difadvan- 
tages are, a fcanty fupply of good water. There is not a 
good fpring in the parifli of CuUen but one, and that lies 
without the town. To the burn of Cullen, there is accefs 
only at two places, and there the roads are fo fteep, that it is 
difficult to carry up water. The only fupply, is a ciftern in 
the centre of the town, where water is brought in leaden 
pipes from the annexed part of the parifli of Rathven. To 
• accommodate the town properly, they would need at leaft 
other two cifterns. The houfes, in general, though cheap 
rented, are mean and bad ; and moll of them being placed 
with their ends to the ftreet, it offends the eye of the tra- 
veller. If Lord Findlater were either to lock up his mofles, 
or to alter the roads, and thereby render them more diftant, 
the inhabitants would foon be obliged to remove, except his 
Lordftiip were pleafed to make a harbour for fliips to bring 
coal» which would be far preferable to their prefent fueh If

it were agreeable to his Lorclftiip to ered better houfes, and to 
build a harbour at the ftiore, which it is believed would not 
be attended with a great e.penfe, Cullen would perhaps be 
one of the moft comfortable and convenient places m the 
jjorth of Scotland to live in. 

Antiauities^P^ the north end of the town of Cullen, there 
is a beautiful green hill, caUed the Caftle-hiU, hanging over 
the fea, which before the ufe of cannon, was extremely well 
fituated for a place of ftrength, being inacceflible from the 
north by an almoft perpendicular high rock, and having a 
deep ditch in all other diredions for its defence. There is no 
record concerning it, when, or by whom built, or when de- 
ftroyed ; but it is evident from the calcined ftones dug every 
where, that it has been deftroyed by fire. And the only tra- 
dition concerning it is, that the town of Cullen lay r.t the 
eaft fide of it, and when an enemy appeared, the inhabitants 
carried their moft valuable efteds into the caftle for protec- 
tion ; but when the caftle was burned, that the inhabitants 
removed to the prefent fituation of the town, to be under the 
protection of the conftable at Cullen houfe, the refidence of 
fhe Earl of Findlater. Near Cullen houfe, there is the veftige 
of a houfe, in which, it is faid. Queen Elizabeth, Queen of 
King Robert Bruce died. In the annexed part of the parifii 
of Rathven, there is the ruin of a chapel at Farlkane, upon 
the fea bank, which is fuppofed to have been a Chapel of 
Eafe in the parifli of Rathven, and worftiip was probably per- 
formed there by the clergymen from Cullen.

north as CuUen, in Lord Flndlater's eftate, a King and 
Queen of Scotland fliould have died, namely, King Indul- 

fus, 

perfeftly with the then fituation of the country : That the King having pre- 
vented the Danes from landing at the Frith of Forth, at the Tay and Aber 
Jeen, upon being informed that they had unexpectedly landed at Cullen haft- 
ened forward with his army, attacked and totally routed them, and made' them 
fly to their flHps; but hearing that there ftiU remained a fmall body of them 
together at the fide of a wood, he raflily ruflied forward with a handful of men 
9nd attacked them, where he feU fighting vajianfly in defence of the liberty of 
His country. Upon the place where the King fell, there was, as ufual, a huge 
cairn of ftones collecfted, which, to this day, is called the King's Cairn. It 
Jies a mile weft from Cullen houfe, in the annexed part of the parifli of Rath- 
ven. The ground which was formerly an open moor fit for a field of battle, is 
now covered with fine trees, and around the cairn there are about 3 acres of 
ground enclofed, and ufed a? a nurfery for raifing young trees. A great many 
of the ftones of the cairn were ufed for this enclofure, but the remainder of the 
cairn is as yet very diftindl. Whether the body of King Indulfus was buried 
under this cairn, or whether, according to the Scoti-chronicdn, it was carried 
to the Ifland of Galumb Kill or Jona, I fliall not pretend to judge ; but it would 
certainly be worth while to examine the bottom of the cairn, to know whether 
there is any urn or ftone coffin in it, according to the cuftom of our anceftors in 
thofe days. With regard to the death of Queen Elizabeth, the writer afferts 
nothing pofitively ; but he thinks it proper to mention the circumftances tliat 
have come to his knowledge, which at leaft make the matter appear probable. 
In the ift place. The tradition mentioned above, concerning the houfe in which 
Queen Elizabeth is faid to have died, is very diftinA in the place. But what 
tends to confirm this; zdly. From the charter of the toxvn of Cullen, a copy 
of which is before the v^riter, it appears, « That Robert of Bruce, King of the 
Scotch, granted and gave in gift for ever, 5I. of the money of the kingdom 
(that is, 8 s. and 44. Sterling) for the fupport of a chaplain in the parifii church 
of the blefl-ed Mary of our ljurgh of Cullen, always to pray for the falvation of 
the foul of the moft ferene Princefs Queen Elizabeth, confort of the fame King 
Robert." And, ^dly. There is a tradition that Queen Elizabeth's bowels are 
etrded, that is, buriqd in our Lady Kirk of Cullen. Now, it may be aiked. if 
the Queen had not died in Cullen, what could have given rife to thefe diftindl 
traditions, and particularly, why would her hufband have endowed a chaplain 
to pray for the falvation of her foul in the church of Cullen ? But the great 
(jueftion is, what could have brought Queen Elizabeth to Cullen ? The mofii

(County of Caithness, Synod of Sutkerland and Caith- 
ness, Presbytery of Caithness.)

Namey Extent, General appearance, ^^c. 

OLRICK is unqueftionablj of Norwegian derivation. It 
may be interpreted, " the fon of Erick," in alhifion to 
an eftabliftiment made by fom6 illuftrious chief of that name  
on this part of the coaft. This invafion, which feems to have 
been general along the E. and N. of Caithnefs, is fuppofed to 
have taken place about the end of the 8th, or the beginning 
of the 9th century. The length of the parilli from N. W. to 
S- E. may be reckoned 4 meafurcd miles ; and its breadth, 
at a medium, 2, or fomewhat lefs. The pariih may be faid 
to be neither mountainous nor plain. The uncultivated parts 
are wholly green, and equally clear both of heath and rock. 
In the fouthern parts of it, a number of green tumuli, or little 

hills, 



OJ OhicL 



Sills, form themfelves into the fhape of three extended amphi- 
theatres, interfefted by a multiplicity of valliea and rivulets, 
affording the raoft luxuriant pafturage for cattle in the fum- 
mer months, and natural hay for their fupport in winter. 
Towards the fea, the whole is one continued track of rich 
cultivated foil. Mofs is not very abundant in the parifli ; 
and the want of good peat-fuel may be reckoned one of the 
greateft inconveniences which the inhabitants labour nndei*. 
Along the fea-coaft, and towards the rifing grounds, the air 
is pure and healthy j but from the fwamps abounding in the 
hollows, and the infalubrious vapours they emit, all the com- 
plaints arifing from obftrucled perfpiration, are not unfrequent 
among the inhabitants. It is much to be regretted, that great- 
er exertions are not made for the draining of thefe marlhes ; 
for, independent of the influence of fuch operations in melior- 
ating the air and climate, and thereby confulting the health of 
the people, the marl to be found in them for the purpofes of 
agriculture, would amply compenfate the expenfe of the work. 
The loch of Duran, in particular, calls for an exertion of this 
fort; it is the only one in the parilh, and is nearly 3 miles in 
circumference ; a part of it was drained fome years ago, by a 
former proprietor, and bog-hay, as it is called, now grows 
in great abundance, where pool and putrefadlion heretofore 
prevailed. The outlet to the fea is of eafy operation ; and by 
continued exertions, it is not to be doubted but this expanfe 
of water might, in a few years, be reduced to a fmall rivulet, 
and the foil it now occupies rendered as produdtive as any 
part of the parifh.^ 

Soil and Produce. — The foil, in general, along the coaft, 
and in tlie flat parts of the parifh, is a deep clay, with here 
and there a little intermixture of fand and till. Remote from 
the coaft, the £oil is lighter, and lefs produftive, and more cal- 
culated 



Statlfltcal AccGuni 



culated for pafture than cropping. The ftaple produce of th« 
panfti is bear, oats, and potatoes. Flax heretofore was raifed, 
though but in fmall quantities, from the extreme difficulty of 
manufaauring it through tiie want of mills. As this incon- 
veniency is now completely remedied, and as the foil is na- 
turally favourable to the I'earing of this valuable article, it is 
expefted, from the induftry of the inhabitants, and the en- 
couragement and countenance they daily meet with from one 
of the principal proprietors *, that this branch of hufbandry 
will foon turn to a very great account in this place. 

The oats in this parifli are in fuch eftimation, as to be 
bought for feed throughout the country ; a diftinftion folely 
owing to the quality of the foil, which is peculiarly adapted 
to this fpecies of grain. The bear is alfo comparatively good, 
weighing from i6 to i8 ftone the boll. The whole produce 
of the pari(h may be at leaft reckoned 7000 bolls meal and 
bear, and the average export about 4000 bolls. Marl and 
fea-weed are chiefly ufed as manures, and are found in great 
abundance, and without much expenfe of labour. 

Agriculture. — There are perhaps few pariflies in the N, 
which have of late made more commendable exertions in agri- 
cultural improvements, than the parifli of Olrick. On the 
eftate of Caftlehill, the property of Mr. Traill, a rotation of 
crops among the tenantry begins to prevail. The following 
is an account of the improvements made on a fmall farm on 
this eftate, occupied by one Donald Coghill, The rent of 
the farm is 20 1. Sterling. In fpring 1791, he laid down 3^ 
acxes under rye-grafs and clover, from which he raifed 800 

ftone 

• The gfentleman here alluded to, is Mr. Traill of Hobbefter, flieriff-depute 
of the county, who has lately got erecfted a lint-mill, a barley-mill, and corn-miJl 
of the beft conftrudlion, and has alfo a threfliing-machine, all excepting the lin'* 
mill, moved by one wheel, and driven by the fame ftream.

itone weight of hay in autumn 1792, which he could have 
fold on ihe field for 6d. the ftone weight. In fpring 1792, 
he laid down under rye-grafs and clover, 3 acres ; under tur- 
Jiip, ^ of an acre ; under potatoes, I acre, and had 1 acres in 
fallow. From the advantages already reaped, he is determi- 
ned to perfevere in this mode of managing his farm ; and o- 
thers are preparing to follow his example. Draining, ditch- 
ing, and enclofing are carried on with fpirit in this part of 
the parifh 5 this is entirely owing to the granting of fuch 
leafes as give the farmer the profpeSt of enjoying the fruits 
of his induftry : Befides, the proprietor afts in every refpedt 
more as the father thah mafler of the people under him. He 
farms himfelf to a large extent ; and his returns are anfwer- 
able to his attention and induftry. Another farm on his e- 
ftate, occupied by Mr. Jolly, minifler of Dunnet, is in a ftate 
equally flourifliing and refpeclable with his own. Mr. Traill 
has alfo made, and is now making very laudable exertions in 
plantations, on a ftieltered part of his eftate, nor, as yet, has 
he any reafon to repent of his attention to this important ob- 

jea. 

It is unneceflary to defcend to much minutenefs as to live 
flock, when it can be afferted with truth, that the black cattle 
reared in the parifli are not adequate to the culture of the foil. 
As to horfes, an import above what are reared, is necelTary e- 
very year. The number of {lieep, valuable neither for their 
wool nor flefh, may be from 1200 to 1500. There is a great 
number of fwine reared, of a fmall fize, but peculiarly deli- 
cate, when well fattened ; they are generally bought up by 
butchers in the parifli, and fold in the weekly market at Thur- 
fo. The real rent of the parifla is about 90c 1. Sterling. 

Population, &amp;c.— According to Dr. Webfter's report, the 
ifiumber of fouls then was 875. The number of inhabitants 

at 



Stat'lftical j^ccouiit 



at prefent, is precifely looi, of which 464 are males, an(i 
537 females. There is nothing noticeable as to their longe- 
vity ; nor does it appear that they have been much on the in^ 
creafe or decreafc for a number of years back.

The inhabitants are, in general, afober, civilized, induflri- 
ous, honefl. people, and regular attendants on divine worfhip. 
Theft may be faid to be unknown among them ; a few, and 
but a few, from particular modes of living, are fomewhat ad- 
difted to excefs in drinking. 

Ecclejtajlical State, Stipend, Schooly Poor.— The religion is 
that of the Eftablilhed Church, with a fev/ Seceders, who at- 
tend a preacher of that perfuafion in the town of Thurfo. 
Thefe, in number, are not above 13, and are nowife noify nor 
uncharitable in the fupport or propagation of their own te- 
nets. Unlefs it be that notions of witchcraft are not wholly 
eradicated from the minds of fome weak and ignorant perfons, 
fuperftition of any fort has little or no hold of them. The. 
kirk feems to have been built in 1633 ; it has been frequently 
repaired fince, and will, in a very (hort time, require another 
confiderable repair, or be built anew. The manfe and offices 
are entirely new, ?.nd fully adequate to the tninifter's accom-

a falary of 9 1. Sterling, befides clerk fees, fchool dues, and pa- 
x-ifti emoluments. There are fome private fchooh m the re- 
n.o.e corners of the parilh, fupported by the people whofe 
children are unable to travel to the parifti fchool. There arc 
nofociety fchools in the place.-There are no feffion funds for 
the fupport of the poor, excepting the Sunday's colkaions, 
^vhich may amount to 81. Sterling a-year ; yet from the cha- 
ritable difpofition of the people, the poor, though fometimcs 
numerous, are not left a prey to the hardlhips of their lot. 

Maritime Hijlory of the Farijb.^lhc line of coaft belong- 
ing to this parifti, beginning at Stangergel, and ending a lit- 
tle beyond the houfe of Murkle, is not more than 2 Engliih 
miles from E. to W. The coaft is rugged and ftielvy, but 
not bold. At the extremities of this line are the Bays of 
Bunnet and Murkle (the latter of which belongs wholly to 
this parifti), and are the receptacles of the greateft abundance 
of fea-ware in the winter and fpring months. From 15 to 20 
tons of kelp are made yearly. Confiderable quantities of fiftx 
are caught in thefe bays. In fome years 10,000 cod and ling 
have been dried in the courfe of one fummer at Murkle ; and 
between 70 and 80 barrels of mud-fifli have been caught in the 
winter feafon. Every other fpecies of fifli peculiar to the 
country, abounds there. The bay of Murkle merits a parti- 
cular defcription in the maritime account of this parifti. It 
is believed, that, were it better known, it would be in higher 
cftimation, and more frequented by feafaring people, from the 
flielter it can now afford, and the additional flicker it might, 
at no great expcnfe be made to afford to veffels in diftrefs, or

retarded in their progrefs by wind or tide. Murkle Bay i.

poflelTed of additional tranquillity, from its connexion with 
tlie latter, and farther removed from their flormy affociatc 
the Pentland Frith, with whicli both are connefted. In Dun- 
net Bay, however, befides the anchoring ground, the preffure 
of both wind and fea into it, is often fo great, that a veflel 
runs the rifk of unavoidable deilruclion, by entering it. la 
Murkle Bay, the anchoring ground is a blue tenacious clay, 
and has the charafter from feamen of being as good as is to 
be found in moft places. ITie bay extends inland from Dun- 
net Bay about 200c yards ; its breadth acrofs is about 1500 
yards. At full fea it is not lefs than 5 fathom deep, where 
velTels anchor, and at low water about 4 fathom ; from the 
flielter ic now receives from Holburnhead on the W., and 
from Dunnethead on the N., it is believed to be calmer in a 
florm than any part of the whole coaft. A pier, in confe- 
quence of the immediate vicinity of a quarry, and all requifite 
materials, might be conftruaed at no confiderable expenfe. 
On thefe accounts, it is recommended to the particular notice 
and confideration of the friends of navigation, and lovers of 
their country, that the fubjeft may be further examined, and 
the truth known. 

Minerals — Limeftone and freeftone, grey flates of a light 
durable kind, and blue flags, abound in this parifli. The 
flags are uncommonly good, are from i to 6 inches thick, 
and may be raifedof almofl any extent of fuperficies : they bear 
fire, and, from trials already made, are faid to be capable of 
receiving a polifli little inferior to marble. Confiderable

were vidorious. It is alfo added, that the Scottife chief, on 
feeing a large hollow at the head of Murkle Bay filled with 
the enemy, called out to his troops to clear the den, which 
they did with fuch havock of their invaders, that the place 
got the name of Clear-Den or Clairden, which it bears till

of , the country, the bays of Sandfide, Scrabfter, and Murkhj

Name, Church. 

THE parifh of St. Vigeans has, according to tradition, 
received its name from a reputed Saint, who is faid t* 
have lived before, or during the 12th century; for, in that 
century the church was built, about the time, or foon after 
the ereftion of the abbey of Aberbrothock *. The church 

is 

* The plan of the abbey and church of St. Vigeans, is faid to have been 
drawn by the fame architedl, whofe grave is fliown to ftrangers in this church- 
yard. The above mentioned Saint, is faid to have refided, for fome time, a- 
bout 3 miles from the place where the church ftands, at a farm called Grange 
of Conan, where the veftiges of his chapel ftill remain, 28 feet long, by 15 
broad. A few yards from the chapel, there are 3 or 4 acres of good land for- 
merly belonging to it, but long fince become the property of i of the heritors 
•f the parilh. The prcfent proprietor, fome years ago, enclofed a few falls of 

ground 



J 66 Stalljl'ical ylccount 

is built Jn the form of a cathedral, 60 feet long, by 54 over 
walls, on a fmall mount, the top of which is about 40 feet 
above the level of the circumjacent ground. The fummit of 
the mount xs of an elliptical form ; the greatefl diameter go- 
ing from S. to N., and the length of the church being from 
E. to W., there are only about 8 feet at each corner more 
than is fufficient to contain the foundation of the fabric. The 
afcent on the W. N. and E. fides of the mount, is exceeding, 
3y fteep *, 

Extent, Surface, Produce, Rent, ?i/V.-_FormerIy tlie ex- 
tent of this parifla was confiderably larger than it is at pre- 
feat. The town and abbey of Arbroath belonged to it, till 
about the yean 560, when Arbroath became a difciAftpa- 
rifti. But as no legal divifion was ever made, the boundaries 
of the 2 pariflies cannot be exadly afcertained f. The boun- 
daries of what is now reckoned the pari% may be defcribed 

as 

ground round the veftiges of the chapel, with a flone fence, and planted it. 
Within a few yards of the chapel, there is i of tlie moll copious fprings,.of ex- 
cellent water, in this country, called to this day St. Vigean's well. 

* The mount feeras to be partly natural and partly artificial ; for, on the S. 
fide, when graves are digged, rock appears about 3 feet below the furface ; but 
on the N. fide, there is fine mould for feveral feet deep. There is not, perhaps, 
in Scotland, a church fo remarkably lituated. The fmall river Brothock, from 
which the neighbouring burgh has its name, runs within a few feet of the E. 
fide of the church-yard, and is faid to fignify the " muddy ftream," as it runs a 
great part of its courfe on a muddy and clay bottom. The church is an Englilh 
mile diftant from Arbroath northward. 

t Perhaps it may be proper to obferve, as an uncommon thing, that the S. 
fide of the church of Arbroath, for about 10 feet at the E. end, and a few feet 
on the W., ftands in this parifh, and not many years ago, the minifter and 
fchoohnafter of Arbroath refided in it. The eftate of Guynd, in the parifli of 
Carmylie, about 5 miles from St, Vigeans, belonged alfo to this parifli, as ap. 
pears from writings belonging to that family, but when it was difjoincd, is tv 
now known.

KS foUows : The weft end of it borders on the fea for about 
3 miles from the town of Arbroath, to about a quarter of a 
mile beyond the fiflier town of Auchmithy. For about a mile 
eaft of Arbroath, the coaft is flat, with a fandy beach ; but 
within flood-mark, the bottom confifts of ribbed rocks, vifi- 
ble only at low water. At the end of this extended plain, 
the coaft rifes abruptly, and becomes high, bold, and rocky, 
being the weftern extremity of the rxilrum promontorium, or 
Red Head, which extends to about 3 miles beyond the limits 
of the parilli. From the point beyond Auchmithy, to the N. 
W. corner of the parifli, the length is about 7 miles, border- 
ing for about 6 miles on the parifli of Inverkeillor, and I 
mile on the parifli of Carmylie. From the N. W. point to 
the S. W. corner, it is about 3 miles along the confines of 
the laft mentioned parifli. From the S. W. point to the E., 
the length is about 3 miles, lying on the N. fide of the parifli 
of Arbirlot, and a part of the country parifli of Arbroath. 
But this laft line is not fo regular as thofe on the other fides *. 

The parifli, properly fo called, is divided into nearly a 
equal parts, E. and W., by the fmall river Brothock. The 
E. fide is by far the beft foil, and the moft favourable cli- 
mate, and confequently the moft fruitful. From the river 
Brothock, the ground rifes gently for a mile towards the E., 
to the top of a hiU called Dirkmountlaw, and afterward 
flopes in the fame gradual manner towards the fea, where the 
coaft is about lOO feet above the level of the water. On the 

W. fide^ 

* Befides the extent comprehended within the above limits, there are % 
eftates entirely detached from this part of the parifli, and alfo from one another. 
One called Hofpitalfield, fo called from being the place where the hofpital for 
the fick of the Abbey of Arbroath flood, lying a mile W. from the burgh, and 
divided from this parilli by the burgh roads of faid town. The other eftate^ 
called InverpefFor, lies about 4 miles from St, Vigeans, was formerly the feat 
df the Fletchers, now of Salton, and purchftfcd by the family of Tanmuir feme 
time in the laft century. 



^ StatiJIical Account 

W. fide, the ground r:fes ftlll more gradually for about , 
-lies weHward, till it reaches the fummit of Grange of Co 
nan hill, where the parifh borders on Carmjlie. The reft of 
the panfh may be faid to be pretty flat, with a few .entle 
elevations in different places. 

There is no map of the parifh ; but by a pretty exad in- 
veftigation, aided by information from the proprietors and 
farmers. It IS found to contain about 9385 Scotch acres, in- 
eluding the 2 detached eftates above mentioned ; 8355 acre- 
of which are arable, of which 2334 acres are enclofed, th« 
greater part with ditch, and the reft with hedge and ditch ■ 
1359 acres enclofed ivith ftone fences; 250 acres planted,' 
chiefly with Scotch firs ; 780 acres of moor, of which there 
are above 300 acres under improvement already, and more 
will foon be taken in for cultivation ; and, it is thought that 
in a few years there will be no moor remaining in the parifii. 
The number of enclofed acres will appear more furprifing 
when it i3 obferved, that in the year 1734, there were not 
40 acres, gardens excepted, enclofed in the parifli. 

There are, in the parifli, 138 carts, 300 horfes, 132 ploughs, 
1633 black cattle, 510 fiieep, a few of which are of Englift 
breed, and 30 fwine. There are about 127 bolls nf peafc 
fown yearly in the parifli ; 140 bolls wheat; 976 bolls barley 
and common bear ; 1578 bolls of oats. The yearly returns, 
at an average, may be 9 of wheat, 5 or 6 of oats, and 7 or 
8 of barley. . But perhaps this calculation may be rather 
high for the W. fide of the parifli ; but, it is thought, the E. 
fide will make up the deficiency. The .valued rent of the 
parifli is 8299I. 6s. 8 d. Scots, which is the higheft valuation 
of a country parifli in this county, and the real rent about 
6000 guineas ; the number of proprietors about 40 ; the 
feuars fome hundreds. The higheft valuation of any heritor

I to the Abbaey of Arbroath, and were fold by Cardmal 
Beaton. 

Soil, &amp;c.-The foil, as may be fuppofed in fuch an extent, 
varies very much. In fome parts of the parifn, it confifts of 
fine loam of a brownifti colour, many inches deep ; lymg, m 
fome places, on clay, in_others, on a fandy bottom, coarfe 
.ravel, or fand and clay intermixed. In others, it confifts of 
a black infipid loam on clay ; and this clay, in fome places, is 
fo compaa and impenetrable, that by the rain-water lying on 
or near the furface, a great part of the winter, the manure 
laid on it is much weakened, and, in fome feafons, fads con- 
fiderably of its elFea. This laft, is the cafe with what has 
been formerly moor, and not fo early brought into cultiva- 
tion as other parts of the parifti. There is, in fome places of 
the parifli, very fine foil, and pretty deep, lying on extenfive 
beds of ftone. There is, in general, a large extent of good 
• foil, capable of producing any crop raifed in Scotland ; and 
alfo', a confiderable quantity of ground that will require no 
little attention and induftry from the farmer, before it can 
repay the expenfe beftowed upon it. But the fpirit of in- 
duftry that has of late pervaded almoft the whole heritors 
and tenants here^ has produced an amazing alteration upon 
the foil, furface, and appearance of the parifti ; fb that in 
many farms, there is not a fingle acre uncultivated ; and if 
the fame fpirit ftiall continue, it is fuppoffed, that in a few 
years the whole extent of the parifti will be under cultiva- 
tion. It is generally allowed here, that the raifmg of the 
rents in this diftrift, has, among other caufes, contributed to

In fome eftates in this pariih, a variety of fervices are re- 
quired fuch as ploughing, reaping, making hay, carrying 
coals frora Arbroath, kain fowls, &amp;c. ; in other eftates no 
kind of fervices are demanded. Tliere are but a few farms 
that are exempted from aftriftion to mills; the multures pay. 
able to fome mills are high, to others moderate. There are 
4 meal mills, i flour mill, 2 barley mills, 2 malt miUs i 
xnill for waftiing yarn, 1 mill with 8 ftamps for beating ylrn 
when dry, and i waulk mill, all going hy water. There is 
a bleachfield, where about looo fpindles of yarn, and about 
5500 yards of linen are bleached annually. 

F-t7Iage of ^uchmthj.—Axichmhhy is a fmall village fitu- 
ated about 5 miles eaftward from the church, on ground ele- 
yatcd about 100 feet above the level of the fea, the defcent 
to which is roughs fteep, and rocky. It contains 180 peo- 
ple of aU ages. The men are generally employed in fifliing.

they have 6 boats, value about i.ol., with 5 or 6 men to 
each boat. The people of that place are become fober and 
induftrious, and much civilized in their manners w.thm 30 
years paft. They fmd a ready market for their filh xn the 
neighbouring diftrid, but efpecially in the town of Arbroath, 
whL alone would confume ten times the quanUty they 
catch*. There is no harbour at Auchmithy, and from the 
number of rocks lying near the place where the ^o^ts land, 
k would be very difficult and expenfive to make one. When 
the boats come in from fiihing, they are drawn out on the 
beach above reach of high water. The value of what they 
caU great lines, is about il. 5^- Sterling, and of the fmall 
lines half-a-guinea, and their creels for catching lobflers 2 s. 
In 1792, there were about 16,000 lobfters taken there, at 3d. 
■ a-piece, the whole of which almoft were fent to London. The 
property of the village belongs to the Earl of Northeflc, who 
allows ground to the fifliers for houfes, at the yearly rent of 
from IS. 6d. to 3s. 6d. the houfe. The filhers build their 
houfes on their own expenfes. His Lordfhip draws the tithes 
of the fifli, which are juft now let at 4I. los. Sterlmg a-year, 
and 7 years ago at 81. The fifliing at that place appears to 
have been in a declining ftate for fome years paft. The Earl 
of Northelk has lately caufed a cart road to be made from the 
village down to the beach, about 12 or 14 feet wide, for the

• This place was burnt down by fome fifherinen in the end of the laft cen- 
tury. In digging the floor of a houfe in Auchmithy, a few years ago, in order 
to eredl a partition wall, 33 coins ivere found in a finall earthen pitcher, fome 
of Henry IV. of France, others of feveral German Princes, the reft of Charles 
II. and William the III. Some of the pieces were of a fquare form. About 
IS miles fouthward from Auchmithy, in the German ocean, there is a large 
rock about half an Englifli mile long, and one quarter broad, rifible at low 
u-ater, where large cod are caught. Tradition relates, that in the laft century 
there was a beU erefted there on pillars of wood, and a machine fo contrived, 
as to make the bell ring with little wind; that a Dutch mafter of a fliip re- 
moved the bell, and that the next time he vifited the place, his fhip was 
wrecked.

when the above converfion was made. At the date of the decreet, James 
Marquis of Hainilton is mentioned as titular of the teinds of the faid parochine,

them, might claim thereafter, from Patrick Ar'chbifliop of Glafgow, out of the

minifter of St. Vigeans in 1614. was depofed by the Affembly in 1638, and is 
faid to have died at Newcaftle in 1644. It may be proper to mentmn as per- 
haps 1 Angular cafe, that a part of the ftipend, amounting to 36 bolls of vidua! 
of different kinds, out of an eftate in the parifl:, is mentioned in the reddendo of 
the proprietor's charter from the Crown, as payable by him to the mimfter of 
St. Vigeans. 

\ Patronage of the Fari/h.— The. patronage of the church belongs to the 
Crown, a«d is one of 34 tliat were in the gift of the Abbacy of Arbroath, All 
thefe devolved to the Crown at the Reformation, and, it is faid, were afterward 
gifted to the family of Dyfart, and were bought from that family in the laft cen- 
tury by Patrick firft Earl of Panmuir, and forfeited to the Crown, along with 
the'eftate, in 1715, by James Earl of Panmuir; the eftate was fold by the Crown 
in 17 17, to the York -building Company, but the Crown retained the patronages. 
In the times of Popery, public worfhip was generally performed in the church 
of St. Vigeans, by a Monk fcnt out from the Abbey, who was allowed the vi- 
carage.tithes, which were then paid ip/a corpora, for his falary. The Abbots 
referved to themfelves the parfonage-tithes ; and this cuftom, it is faid, prevailed 
in all the churches belonging to the Abbacy. Tradition relates, that the laft 
Monk who officiated here, was one of the name of TurnbuU ; and in the year 
1754, part of the floors of 2 rooms in the fteeple, faid to be poffefTed by him, re- 
mained. He is faid to have been frightened from his chambers by the devil 
appearing to him in the fliape of a rat ; and no Monk after him would be per- 
fuaded to refide in, the fteeple. Such was the ignorance that prevailed in thefc 
times. But this foolifli condud of the Monk will not, perhaps, appear in fuch a 
contemptible light, when the following more recent inftance of ignorance, ere- 
^ulity and fuperftition, is attended to. From the year 1699 to 1736, the Sacra- 
ment of the Lord's Supper had never been difpenfed in this church. A tradi- 
tion had long prevailed here, that the water-kelpy (what Mr. Hume, in his tra- 
gedy of Douglas, calls " the angry fpirit of the water") carried the ftones for 
building the church ; that the foundation of it was fupported upon large bars of 
Iron ; and that under the fabric there was a lake of great depth. As the admi- 
niftration of the facrament had been fo long delayed, the people had brought 
themfelves to believe, that the firft time that ordinance fliould be difpenfed, the 
church would fink, and the whole people wouI4 be carried down and drowned

houfe is Hated, confifts of 4 rooms and 2 clofets ; and there it 
alfo a fchool-houfe of 38 feet long, lately built by contribu- 
tion. The falary is loo 1. Scots, which, with the dues a- 
rifmg from his office of feffion-clerk, and from marriages, bap- 
tifms, &amp;c. makes his living worth 30 1. Sterling. He has al- 
fo a fmall garden. The fcholars are generally about 50 or 
60, forae of whom are boarded in the fchoolmafter's houfe. 
The fees for reading Englifti are i s., for reading and writing 
I s. 6 d,, for arithmetic 1 s., and for Latin 2 s. 6 d. the quar- 
ter. 

Populatisn — According to Dr. Webfter's report, the po- 
pulation was 1592. Between the years 1770 and 1780, the 
commencement of the increafed population of this pariih may 
be dated. For fome years in that period, the increafe was 
flow ; but fince the year 1780, it has been very rapid, general, 
ly above 56 perfons in a year. This increafe has been chief- 
ly, if not entirely owing to the flourifliing ftate of manufac- 
tures in the town of Arbroath. An eftate, lying in detached 
parcels near that towr;, was fold very lately to feveral per- 
fons, who immediately feued out ground to tradefmen, for 
houfes and fmall gardens. A number of houfes have been al- 
ready 

in the lake. The belief of this had taken fuch hold of the people's minds that 
on the day the facrament was adminiftered, fome hundreds of the parifhioners 
fat on an eminence about 100 yards from the church, expedling every moment 
the dreadful cataftrophe. They were happily difappointed ; and this fpirit of 
credulity " foon vaniflied, like the bafelefs fabric of a vifion." In the prefent times, 
it would prove a matter of great difficulty to make the people believe fuch ab- 
furdities. Perhaps the local fituation of St. Vigeans, in the \'icinity of the Ab- 
bey, might have difpofed the people to imbibe fuch principles as are not cafily 
rooted out. This much, however, may be faid in favour of credulity, that it 
generally flows from an honeft heart, though, on the other hand, it is feldom the 
cffspring of a well informed head.

pied moftly by weavers. In fome few farms, the number oE 
people has decreafed, particularly in one, where the cottagers 
in 17 S4 were 18, and now there is only i family in that place. 
In April 1793, thehoufes in this pari(h were 730, and the 
number of people of all ages is 3336 5 and in that number 
there are 65 females more than males. In 1754, on the land 
contiguous to the town of Arbroath, there were but 12 fami- 
lies, by an exaft lift taken by 3 elders, from houfe to houfe,

than 1369 perfons of all ages, 669 males and 700 females *. 

In the parifli, there are 225 weavers, 40 wrights, 13 fmiths,

The average number of baptifms for the laft 5 years, is 75 ; but it woulJ 
have been greater, if the parents had been mors regular in giving in the names 
of the children to the parilh-regifter. The baptifms for the year 1792, whicli 
were 93, may be depended on as the exadt number adminiftered by the Efta- 
bliihed miriifter, as he baptized nqpe during that period, which were not regif- 
tered before baptifm. But there may have been about 4 or 5 more baptized 
laft yeaj by minillers who are not of the Eftablifliment. The average number

chofen annually. This fociety confifts at prefent of 87 memw 
|jers, all weavers ; and ihey admit none but thofe who have 
been regularly bred to the bufinefs. The prefes buys from 
800 to 1000 bolls of meal yearly, and from 400 to 500 bolls 
of coals, all which is given out to the menabers at 3 or 4 
months credit ; this fociety affords a s. a-weak to their poor, 
which is paid out of the general fund ; and when the fund 
happens to be reduced to a certain fum, their poor are fup- 
plied by a contribution among the members. The other is cal- 
led the Townhead Society, is managed in much the fame man- 
ner as the former, but admits members of all occupations, 
and has no ftated allowance for their poor, but beftows as 
their funds will allow. The chief defign of the eftablifhment 
of thefe focieties was for providing coals and meal for the fa- 
milies concerned in them, which they are enabled to purchafe 
at a cheap rate, by laying in large quantities at proper feafons ; 
and they find ample credit, by the whole members being 
bound for the payment. The members of both focieties fliov/ 
particular attention to the moral charafter of the perfons they 
admit. 

It is but doing juftlce to the inhabitants of thefe newly e- 
refled villages, to obferve, that they are generally fober, and 
remarkably induftrious ; by which means the moft part of 
them are enabled to live comfortably. By their refidence in 
the vicinity of Arbroath, where manufaftures are carried on 
to a very great extent, they enjoy every advantage for know- 
ing the goodnefs and value of the materials they make ufe of, 
the method by which they may be beft manufaftured, the cha- 
rafter of the merchants with whom they deal, and when to 
embrace the fitted opportunity for difpofing of their goods. 

It is proper here to obferve, that the firft manufacturer of 
the cloths called Ofnaburghs, in this country, and perhaps in 

Scotland, 



OfBi. Vtgeans, 



Jifcotland, was tlie late Mr. Joha Wallace, merchant, and fome 
time provoft of Arbroath, who began that buhnefs about the 
year 1 740; and for many years after that period, all that ku.d 
of cloth manufactured in this part of the country centered in 
his fliop. But now that bufinefs has been extended through 
almoft every town, village, and parilh in the county, and 13 
now carried oh to fuch an extent, that the very large fum ot 
money brought into this county by that breach of bufinefs, 
cannot be eftimated without an iufpedion of the cuftom-houfe 
books. By informati;H!i fent the wri-.r of this, from the maf- 
ter of the ftamp-office in Arbroath, taken from his books, ic 
appears, that from November 1791 to November 1792, there 
t^ere ftamped 1,055,303 yards of Ofnaburgh and brown linen ; 
and that one-fourth part of that quantity was manufaftured 
In this pariOi. The value of the above cloth was 39,660 L 
6 s. loi d. Sterling. The bounty paid by government is I d. 
Sterling on each yard of Ofnaburgh valued 6 d. and li d. on 
each yard above 6 d. of price. 

Rife in the value of land.—The property of many eftatcs iit 
this parifh has been frequently transferred fince the year 1754; 
One eftate on the W. fide of the parifh, of about 300 acres, 
^as fold about the above period for iefs than 600 1. ; fome 
years after that it gave 1300 1/; foon after 2300 1. ; after- 
•Ward for 25b3l. ; it is juft now in the market, and 6000 1. 
kt leaft is expefted for it. Another eftate, on the W. fide, 
but near Arbroath, confifting of 150 acres,- was fold in 1765, 
for 2300 1. and 3 years ago it gave jScol. Another eftatej^ 
on the eaft fide, of 363 acres, was fold about 30 years ago for 
42001., foon after for 14(30 1.; about 3 years ago it gave 
'4C00 guineas. A farm of about 8co acres on the W. fide of 
the pariPj, a part of which is moor, was feued about 20 years 
ago, and divided by the proprietors into 2 farms ; the whole

farm paid of rent in l7ii;4, and for feveral years after, about 
70 1. One of the farms was let fome years ago for above 
200 1., and the other for 160 1. Another eftate, lying near 
Arbroath, in detached parts, was fold about 43 years ago for 
1750 1., feveral years after for 4750 1., and two years ago for 
8000 1. in fmall parcels. Another eftate in the E. fide of the 
paridi, was fold in 1765 for 850 1., and a years ago for 
2000I. 

-^rops, F loughs. Farmers. — There are about 70 farmers in 
the parife, who pay of yearly rent from a 1. to 200 1. Of 35 
heritors, the number in 1754, only a are alive; and there is 
not one farmer alive in the parilh, and now poffeffed of a farm, 
who was a farmer in 1754. Scots ploughs, very neatly made, 
and covered with yetling, are the only kind ufed in this pa- 
rilli. They are drawn by 2 horfes, and worked by one roan. 
The writer does not know of a plough drawn by oxen in the 
parifti. In fuch variety of foil, difference of climate in the 
E. and W. fides of the parifli, degrees of knowledge and tafte 
of the farmers, power of habit, 8e.c. the rotation of cropping 
niufl be very different. It is thought that the a following 
modes are the moft common here. When a farmer breaks up 
ley ground, which has not been formerly improved, about 30 
bolls of lime-ftiells are laid upon the acre ; the fliells are deli- 
vered with the barley meafure, the firft crop oats, the fecond 
barley, without any manure, the 3d crop oats, the 4th a green 
crop, or, according to the condition of the ground, barley with 
grafi feeds, and lies under grafs generally 4 years. Or, they 
break up ley generally at Lammas, lay on lime and dung for 
wheat, ad crop oats, 3d crop turnip, and 4th barley, with 
grafs-feeds. There are raifed here from 50 to 60 bolls of 
flones Amfterdam weight of potatoes upon the acre, and of 
this uCeful root, great quantities are produced in the parilh.

up their elTecfts, in the event of their death, to the poor's fund ; but thefe fel- 
dom fall to the feflion, as there are generally claims offered by relations for at- 
tendance, occafional fupply, and the expenfe of burial. There are very few 
begging poor in the parilh. 

In the parifh there are about 20 perfons of the Church of England, 70 of the 
Scotch Epifcopal church, 30 Independents, 35 Methodifts, 40 Secedcrs, 10 Bere- 
ans. The Eftablifted Church is generally well attended, ahd the parifl)ioners 
contribute liberally for the fupport of the poor, to the amount of between 10 
and 13 s. every Sabbath during the fummcr. The difference that prevails here, 
9nd in Arbroath, in religious opinions, appears to have no difagreetble influence 
on the minds and manners of the people. However much they may differ in 
their fentiroents, they affociate together, tranfadi: bufinefs, and meet in a focial 
and convirial nwnner, without an inftance altnoft of any injury or perfonai a- 
bufe of one another.

lately dug up in the parifh, above 5 feet long, and 3 broad, 
and fome earthen jars with alhes in them. A deer's horns, 
in high prefervatlon, were found a few years ago in a mofs, 
fome feet below the furface, with raofs above and marl be- 
low. 

There is a hill called Dick, or Dickmount-law, which is 
faid, in one of the ftatiftical accounts, to fignify a rampart of 
proteaion or peace. It is about a mile E. of the church, and 
feeras to have been very much adapted to both the above 
mentioned purpofcs. On the top of this hill there is a large 
cairn, now covered with grafs, and hollow in the middle, 
where the baron held his courts. From it there is one of the 
pioft extenfive profpeds in this country. There is a view of 
the Grampian hills, for more than 30 miles, the coaft of Fife 
for about 18 miles, the Ifle of May, the Lowmonds of Fife, 
Largo-law, and the German Ocean for above 30 miles.

never feems to have been what could be called a lake in the 
parifh ; but as a great part of the ground lies on a clay bot- 
tom, and formerly muft have been very wet, it is thought 
that this muft have contributed to the prevalence of this dif- 
temper. The climate muft, no doubt, now have become 
much more healthy by the great number of ditches lately 
made kere. 

There are feveral caves in the rocks, along the W. between 
Arbroath and Auchmilhy, one of which can be entered only 
at low water. When feals abounded on this coaft, it was cuf- 
tomary to let people down to this cave with a rope round 
their body, to the depth of 40 feet, with ropes of ftraw rol- 
led round their legs, and bludgeons in their hands, in order 
to kill feals. There is another, called the Maiden Caftle cave, 
the entry to which is about 10 feet above high water- mark. 
The mafon-lodge of Arbroath built a gate to it, and gave it a 
door many years ago. They walked in procelTion every year 
on St. John's day from Arbroath to this cave, where they ad- 
mitted new members. It is about 231 feet long, and from 13 
to 24 feet broad. At the farther end there is a fpring of fine 
water, but exceedingly cold. Above the cave are the vefti- 
ges cf a fort, about loo feet above the level of the fea, and 
on the land ude the remains of the foffe and rampart are ftill 
vifibi . There is another cave, which appears as if it had 
been cut out of the face of t e rock, the entry to which is a- 
boat 4c feet above the fea. It is about 12 feet long, 10 broad, 
and 8 high. The accels to it is difficult and dangerous *.

IRRIEMUIRj commonly pronounced Kellamuir, is a 
Gaelic wordj and fignifies Mary Kirk. The form of 
the parilh is irregular. Its greateft length from S. E. to N. 
W., is 7 or 8 miles, its leaft 4. The greateft breadth from 
S. W. to N. E., is about 7 miles ; the leaft 6. The northern 
part, called Glenprofen, from the river Profen which runs 
the whole length of it, is bounded on the S. by Kingoldrum ; 
on the E. and N. by a ridge" of mountains which feparates it 
from Cortachy and Clova ; and on the W. by another ridge 
of mountains which feparates it from Glenifla and Lintrathen. 
This glen is about 1 2 miles long ; and, with the traft of 
country which lies along the burn of Lednathie, Glenuig, 
Glenlogie, and fome fmaller glens which are comprehended 

A a 2 under 



Stalijlical Account 

under the general name Glenprofcn, may contain 24 or 30 
fquarc miles. The face of the country is various. For about 
a mile to the N. of the parifhes of Glammis and Forfar, it 
IS almofl flat. Then it rifes gently about 2 miles more, form- 
ing almoft one continued floping bank, till within a few hun- 
dred yards of the town, which Hands nearly in the centre of 
the fouthern part of the parilh, and is feparated by a narrow 
valley or den, about 100 feet deep, from the above bank. 
To the E. and W. of the town, it is almoft level. The reft 
of the parifti is beautifully diverfified with hills, and dales, 
rivers, woods, and plains. The hills, however, thofe in- 
Glenprofen excepted, are of no great elevation, and are either- 
cultivated, or planted, or afford tolerable pafture. Glen- 
profen is altogether hilly and mountainous. A few of the 
hills are covered with grafs, except on their fummits ; and a. 
few of them are rocky ; but they are, in general, covered 
with heath, interlperfed, however, with innumerable patches 
of grafs, probably produced by the many rills which tumble 
down their fides. Some of thefe hills are interfered by ri- 
vulets which have their fource in the glens- formerly men- 
tioned ; and in the glens, are feveral hundred acres of fiat 
mofly ground, partly covered with bent and rough grafs,, 
which afford good pafture for young cattle during the fum- 
mer months, as the hills do for ftieep. In Glenprofen, the- 
foil is paxtly thin and light, partly moffy, and, in general, 
wet.. In the fouthern part of the pariili,, are all kinds of 
foil; but a black mould, on a bottom of mortar, predominates. 
This, when dry, produces heavy crops of all kinds of grain;, 
but being in many places wet and fpongy, the harveft is often 
late, and the grain of rather an inferior quality. 



Rivers, and Woods — The river Elk, which has it fource 
in Clova, forms the N. E. boundary of this parilh for. about.

. miles. The Profen takes its rife in the N. W. extremity 
of it ; runs the whole length of the glen to which it gives 
name; afterward feparates the parilhes of Cortachy and Kxng. 
oldrum for about . miles ; then Kirriemuir and Cortachy for 
about . miles more ; and falls into the Eflc near Invercarxty. 
The Carity has its fource in the parifh of Lmtrathen , tra- 
verfes that and the pariH. of Kingoldrum ; and, after a me- 
andering courfe of about 4 miles in this panih, is loft m the 
i Elk at Invercarity, to which it gives name. Thefe rivers 
I fwarm with fmall trout, which afford excellent fport for the 
• angler ; and, in the fummer months, a great number ortea- 
j trout refort to the Efli and Profen. This trout is^ red, of ait 
: excellent flavour, and by many people preferred to falmon. 
Some years ago, falmon were likewife plenty in the Elk ; 
but now, owing to the dam-dikes towards the mouth of the 
i liver, their numbers here are. inconfiderable. The Gairie 
has it fource about 2 miles to the W. of the town in the 
meadow, formerly the Lake of Kinnordy. After paffing the 
meadow, it glides along a channel cut for it out of folid rock^ 
till within 300 or 400 yards of the town. Then, changing its 
eourfe to the S. E., it defcends into a narrow valley ; and, 
in its fall, turns a corn and malt mill, a flax, and 2 fulling 
iSiills. Direfting again its courfe to the E.,. it meanders a- 
iong the den, which is of a ferpentine form, about 200 yards 
to the S. of the town, and 60 feet below the level of the 
lowcft part of it. At the eaftern extremity of the den, which, 
is about a mile long, it takes a fouthern direftion, and after 
beautifying and enriching the parks of Logic, again turns to 
,the S. E.,. and, after a courfe of about 10 miles,; which, in a 
direft line, would not exceed 5, falls into the Dean a little to 
the E. of Glammis Caftle. Before the Lake of Kinnordy 
was drained, in 1740, this was a confiderable ft ream ; but 
now, in a dry furamcr, it is fcarcely fufficient to turn a mill.

This parifli, to the E. of the town, was once a continued 
foreft, called Platane. At prefent there are no woods of great 
extent ; though a confidcrable quantity both of hard and foft: 
timber, of all kinds and ages, is intcrfperfed up and down 
the parifti, efpeciallj on the eftate of Kinnordy, the proprie- 
tor of which is giving his feat every embellilliment which 
wood can beflow, as well as ornamenting the country, by 
planting every piece of wafte ground on his eftate. Mr. 
Ogilvy of Clova, has llkewife planted, within thefe few 
years, 300 acres of Scotch and Larix firs, befides hard wood ; 
and continues to plant a certain number of acres every year. 
There is, befides, in Glenprofen, a confidcrable quantity of 
natural wood, moftly birch j and, were it not for the flieep, 
it would foon become a foreft, as the upper part of it, which 
is ftill called the Foreft of Glenprofen, has evidently been. 

Climate, &amp;c. — The climate varies confiderably. The lower 
part of the parifli is far more mild and temperate than Glen- 
profen, except in the middle of fummer, when, owing to the 
reflexion of the fun's beams from the hills, the latter is per- 
haps warmer than the former. And, about the boundaries 
of the parifties of Glammis and Forfar, the air is milder 
than about the town, and to the northward of it. Scrofula 
and confumptions are the moft common diforders ; and we 
are fometimes, though rarely, vifited with putrid fevers. 
The air is clear and falubrious ; the people rather above the 
common fize, well made, ftrong, aftive, and healthy. The 
ague, which is common in the lower parts of Strathmore, is 
unknown here ; and, often, whilft Forfar, Glammis, and 
Meigle, are enclofed in mift, there is none at Kirriemuir. 
There are no inftances of a remarkable longevity j but many 
arrive at 80 ; and 2 or 3 died lately who v/ere above 90.

Cultivation, &amp;c.— Part of this parifli was enclofed many 
years ago, and is in a ftate of high cultivation; and, m every 
part of it, improvements are carrying on. Such, at prefent, 
feems to be the fpirit for Improvements in agriculture, both 
among the proprietors and tenants, that if they go on for a 
few years longer, as they have done for 15 years paft, there 
will be little wafte ground in the parifti. What is wet, they 
ire draining; what is uncultivated and arable, they are bnng- 
,ing into tillage ; what is not arable, they are planting. Much 
ihas been done in all thefe ways ; and a great deal ftiU re- 
•mains to be done. And here the means of improvement are 
to be had in great abundance. The Lake of Kinnordy, which 
h completely drained, and the meadows of Logic, which are 
not drained, contain an inexhauftible fupply of fine marl. 
I Nor is encouragement wanting to engage the tenants to ufe it. 
For the proprietor of Kinnordy fells it confiderably cheaper 
than any other marl in the county ; though, in quality, it is, 
by many, reckoned inferior to none. Accordingly, it is car- 
ried not lefs than 14 miles. The town likewife affords a 
great deal of manure, which, within thefe 3 years, has rifea 
from 8d. and 9 d. the cart load, to 16 d. and x8d. This is 
,a clear proof of the fpirit for improvement ; and, as another, 
-jt may not be improper to mention, that a fmall eftate about 
^ miles to the N. of the town, fold laft year at 60 years pur- 
chafe, though one half of it is under leafe for a life, and the 
other for 9 or 10 years. Few, if any, leafes are now let, in 
which the tenant is not bound to a regular rotation of crop- 
ping ; and thofc who have old leafes, and are not bound, be- 
gin to find it their intereft to follow one. The rotations moft 
common are, ift, oats or flax, . after ley ; 2d, turnip or pota- 
toes j 3d, oats ; 4th, barley with grafs-feeds ; 5th, hay ; 6th, 
■ 7th, and 8th, pafture; then oats or flax, &amp;c. as before. In-

hay the firft year of the grafs, fome are beginning to paflure 
that year, and to cut for hay the fecond. This, tliey think, 
gives them hay of a fuperior quality, and rye-grafs feed in the 
greateft perfedlion. A few never make any hay for fale ; but 
paflure all the years. luftead of taking only i crop of corn 
after the ley, fome take 2. The whole dung of the farm is 
laid on with the turnip or potatoes ; and when it is not fuf- 
ficient for all the ground allotted for green crop, they fallow, 
and fometimes dung and fow wheat in Oftober. At pre- 
fent, however, wheat is not a common crop here ; the far- 
mers finding that barley is, in general, more profitable, ef- 
pecially when the value of the turnip is confidered. Ano- 
ther rotation much approved of, when dung can be command- 
zed, is, ift, oats after ley ; zd, turnip or potatoes ; 3d, bar- 
ley with grafs-feeds ; 4th, hay, or the grafs cut green ; 5th, 
pafture; 6th, oats, or flax, &amp;c. as before. Here likewife the 
dung is laid on with the turnip, &amp;c, which are always horfe- 
hoed. Another mode of culture pradifed here, deferves to 
be mentioned. Mr. Kinloch of Kilrie, having the command 
of the river Gairie, begins, in the month of November, to 
flood his enclofures at Logic, and continues to do fo at inter- 
vals, till the middle of April. Thefc enclofures have been in 
grafs fince the year 1770 ; and, in confequenc« of the above 
praftice, are now the earlieft aud beft grafs fields in the coun- 
ty ; and there is not, perhaps in Scotland, any fuperior (a 
them. Before the above period, they let at from los, to la s.

and fatted j fheep for the butcher, poultry, butter, cheefe, ho- 
ney, wool, and tallow, to a confiderable amount, are annually 
exported. The farmers have lately turned their attention to 
the breeding of horfes. By confequence the breed has been 
much improved, and a large fum of money faved the parifli, 
which ufed to be fent out of it for that ufeful animal. The 
moft intelligent of the breeders of ftieep have likewife chan- 
ged their fyftem ; and, inflead of buying the greateft part of 
their flock, when a year old, at the Linton market, as was the 
praftice fome years ago, they are begun to rear nearly as many 
lambs as ferve them. The fheep reared here are altogether 
white. They are not fo heavy as the Linton fheep: but their 
wool is finer, and their mutton of a higher flavour.

Situated near the foot of the braes of Angus, in a fertile, 
cxtenfive, and populous diflrid, Kirriemuir is the mart to 
which the inhabitants of the neighbouring pariflies chiefly re- 
fort. Hence no town in the county has a better weekly mar-

About 1200 pair of flioes are made annually for exportation;, 
and the manufadure of coarfe linen is carried on to a very 
great extent. Ofnaburgh, fcrim, and blrdy, to the amount of 
about 38,000 1. Sterling, were manufaftured from September 
1791 to September 1792. This is more than was ever be-

it is at prefent, December 1792!.

farmers carried their victual to the beft market ; and this place was threatened

By the Rev. Mr. Patrick Mitchell.</head> 


<p>
Name, Extent, Surface bV. 

THE name of this diftrift is faid to be derived from tie 
Kembs, ^ chain of littlq hills which takes its rife 
nearly at the middle of the parifh, and extending along tbe 
k. lide of it, terminates in the parilh of Clunj, by wbicli 
Kemnay is bounded on the W. and S. W. There are 3 mi- 
neral fprings at the foot of the llembs, about an Englilli 
mile diftant from each other, one of which is called the 
Kemb-well, and the other the Spa- well. The water is pretty 
ftrongly impregnated with iron, but has not as yet got any 
reputation for its medicinal virtues. The parifti lies 14 miles 
W. from the capital of the county. It is bounded on the 
N. E., and N. W-, by the river Don. It is of an irre- 
gular

gular figure, and about 4! Englifh miles in length, and near, 
ly 3 broad. It is rather hUlj than flat ; but there are no hills 
*ti It of any confiderable height. 

Rivers, Fijh.—Th? Don, which is our only river, abounds 
in excellent falmon. The way in which they are caught 
•here, is by cruives, of which there are 2 belonging to Mr. 
Burnett of Kemnay. The falmon are fent frefli to Aberdeen 
for exportation, and are fold to the merchant at 4d. the pound, 
from the beginning of the fi/hing feafon to the middle of 
Apa-il, and thence, to ihe end of the feafon, at 3id. tb^ 
pound. 

Soil. ~ThQ foil is, foif the mofl: part, a light mould, very 
ftony, and lying on a bed of fand. The' haugh§,, indeed, on 
the banks of the Don, are, in general, a fine rich loam, 
deep, and perfeftly free from ftones ; but they are of no 
great extent in this diftrid. We have here great abundance 
of peat-mofs, a confiderable part of which has been in tillage 
for a-ges, and is called Burntland. It was heretofore the 
prr.aice to plough fuch grounds early in fummer, and as foon 
ss the furrows were a little dried, to fet fire to them ; a prac- 
tice of ;C0-nfiderablc advantage to the farmer for a few years 
after the burning, but very ruinous to the foil. Since this 
practice was prohibited, the :rops of oats on our mofly 
grounds have been poor, and, in late feafons, are generally 
lofi:. But trees of all kinds thrive wonderfully in our peat- 
moifres. The late Lord Kaimes takes notice of this fed in 
Kis Gentleman F armer ; but he ftates it inaccurately, and 
draws a conclufion from it, which by no means follows. 

At the feat of Mr. Burnett of Kemnay," fays his Lord- 
fiiip (page 305, of the edition 1776) "10 miles from Aber- 
deen, a kitchen-garden, a flower-garden, a wildernefs of trees,

Of Kcmnayo 201 

«i,digenons and exotic, arc aU in a peat-mols wW water 
ft.iates from i foot to . under the furface." Th.s, Lord 
K jmes advances as a proof, that « a plant may ac.mre a 
conftitution fitting it for growing partly m earth, partly m 
, water." But the kitchen-garden and flower-garden at .vem 
nay, are not in a peat-mofs. On the contrary, the od of 
both is a light mould, very fl.allow, and lyxng on fand of a 
deep brown colour. It is true that the wUdernefs xs m a 
i peat-mofs, and that almoft all the trees, both indigenous and 
Exotic, that have been planted in it, have come away with 
extraordinary rapidity. But the tap roots Hop immediately 
V^hen they come to the llagnant water, that is, to the quick 
inofs, as we call it, and pufli no further. The other roots 
j fhoot horizontally to a great diftance from the tree, but never 
' go below the dry or dead part of the ihofs. It is neceffary to 
obferve farther, that in planting in peat-mofs, it is always 
found expedient here, to throw into the pit that is dug for 
the reception of the plant, a certain quantity of good earth, 
either loam or mould, among which it takes root ; and that 
in no inftance has a tree been obferved to vegetate above 2 or 
3 years, where this was omitted. 

Air, Notwithftanding the abundance of peat- 

mofs in this parifh, which has, doubtlefs, rather a bad efFeft 
upon the air, the inhabitants, in general, are not unhealthy. 
The greater number of the little villages in which they live, 
is in elevated fituations. No local dillemper has ever been 
known to prevail atnong them, unlefs that kind of dropfy 
which phyficians call the anafarca, and which frequently ap- 
pears here, may be called fuch. This diforder, however, is 
feldom mortal, as it yields to a very fimple cure, if the old 
advice is followed, " venienti occurrite ir.orboo"

Seed-time and Harvejl.—Th^ time of fowing oats is, ge- 
nerally, from the 2d or 3d week of March to the middle of 
April ; bear, from the end of April to the 20th of May j 
and turnips, from the loth to the 20th of June. No other 
crop befides thefe is raifed in the diftrift and it is only about 
4 or 5 years fincc any perfon but the principal heritor * be- 
gan to fow turnips in the fields. They are ftiU fown in very 
Jmall quantities by the tenants. Harveft generally begins 
about the end of Auguft, or the ift week of September; 
and the crop is brought into the barn-yards by the end of 
Oaober. In 1775, harveft was Completely finiflied by the 
end of Auguft ; but fuch early feafons are, generally, followed 
"by a fcarcity of ftraw, our only winter food for horfes and 
cattle. 

Agriculture. — This ufeful art is very far from being in an 
improved Hate in this parifti. The late Mr. Burnett of Kem- 
nay fet an excellent example, as a farmer, to his tenants. Of 
nearly 130 acres, which he enclofed and improved, between 
90 and i©o acres were moor or marfh, which he broke up, 
drained, and cleared of ftones, of which there was an amazing 
number, and the mofl; of them fo large, that they could not 
be removed till they were blown up with gunpowder. While 
Mr. Burnett was improving thefe grounds, which he left in a 
high ftate of cultivation, and paying well for the expenfe be- 
ftowed upon them, he planted, with trees of different kinds, 
130 acres, befides hedge-rows, in the Englifh mode, round 
every field in his farm, on each fide of the avenues leading to 
his houfe, and in the little gardens of his tenants- The wil- 
dernefs already mentioned, was alfo enclofed and planted, while

Hr Burnett's improvements in agriculture were going on. It 
contains 24 acres of the moft thriving wood, Oirubs, &amp;c. and 
is one of the moft delightful pieces of pleafure-ground in the 
N. of Scotand, though all in a peat-mofs. But Mr. Burnett s 
: example, in refped^f improvement, has produced very httle 
.ffea on his tepants, among whom, in general, the fame mode 
of agriculture prevails that was followed a century ago. There 
is indeed, an inclination among them to alter it. A talte 
for cleaning their grounds by green crop, and fowing artifi- 
cial grafs, begins to appear. But they haye feveral obftacles 
to improvement to furmount. They have not fufficient ftock. 
i Indeed, there is not a fubftantial tenant in the parifli. They 
have fcarcely any enclofures. Their leafes are fhort, none of 
• them exceeding 19 years. The carriage of lime from the 
; port of Aberdeen, where alone it can be got, is a very heavy 
j expenfe, as . we have neither a canal nor a navigable river. 
The tenants pay a high multure * at the mill. They have no 
fuel but peats, the digging and carrying home of which afford 
full employment to their fervants and horfes, from the end of 
May till harveft begin. Coals are too high-priced for them, 
in confetjuence of the unreafonable tax on that article, which 
has been fo often complained of, and is at laft to be taken off, 
I hope for ever f.

this parifh, and of tjie parilhes of Cluny and Kintore, which produced great dif- 
trefs, and is ftill, in fome meafure, felt. On the 30th of July 1790, about 10 
o'clock before noon, there came on a ftorm of thunder and lightning, attended 
\vith a heavy fall of hall, or rather of pieces of ice. The ftorm continued with 
fcarcely any intermiflion, till 3 o'clock in the afteraoon, when the ground was 
^uite covered -with ice, and, where there was no ftaiidingxorn, exhibited as

Scarcelj any part of this parifh is enclofed, but what i;; 
the immediate pofleffion of the principal landholder. The 
farms are, in general, rather fmall, and rent from 60 1. down 
as low as 6 1. I do not mean that they are fmall in point of 
extent. If all the grounds in every farm were improved,^ that 
are capable of improvement, feveral of the farms would be 

very 

much the appearance of winter as it does in the end of December, after a fall 
of fnow. I was informed, upon good authority, that the hail, at the foot of the 
wallof Caftle Frafer, which is in the parifli of Cluny, meafured 5 feet in depth 
on the evening of the 30th. It lay there, and in many other places in this 
neighbourhood, for feveral days. It did not occur to any body to meafure or 
weigh the hail-ftones ; fo that I cannot fay any thing particular refpeaing the 
fize of them. After the thunder and lightning ceafed, the hail was fucceedeej 
by fmall drizzling rain, which continued to 6 o'clock in the afternoon. All end- 
ed at night in a moft intenfe fvoft, attended by a mildew, which blafted almoft 
every thing *rhich the lightning and hail had fpared. The bear and oats being 
in the ear, and the moft forward of them beginning to fill, a great deal of the 
grain was knocked from the ear by the haU. On the firft clear day after the 
ftorm, the bear began to put on a brown colour, and in lefs than a week, the 
ears Vwere almoft all white.' The ftraw continued green and juicy, till it was 
cut down in harveft, and .proved excellent food for the cattle. I remarked, 
that fome grains in the blafted ears continued to vegetate after the ftorm, and 
came to perfedliori. But they were very few. To give fome idea of the general 
failure of our bear crop, in confequence of this ftorm, I muft ftate, that from fj 
fmall field bf fomething more than half an acre, which I had limed and dreffed 
with turnips in 1789, 1 reaped not quite half a peck of bear in 1790. The oats 
not being fo far advanced as the bear, fuffered lefs. But, in general, it was ef- 
timated that we loft at leaft three-fourths of our crop of oats. Tht potatoes 
likcwife failed, the ftems having been firft fliattered by the hail, and then en- 
tirely deftroyed by the fucceeding froft. Some Surinam potatoes, which I had 
planted that feafon, did, indeed, put forth again with great vigour ; but it was 
t09 late. The cabbage?, greens, turnips, and all broad leaved vegetables, were 
much torn, and confequently checked in their growth. The grafs, both n&amp;tn. 
ral and artificial, Was greatly damaged. In a word, every vegetable lii-Tered by 
the ravages of this deftrucflive ftorm. Yet as they did not extend over a fpace 
above 24 or %6 miles in circumference, we felt none of the hardlliips of fcarcity. 
Grain was to be got in great plenty in our neighbourhood, and at a moderat'S 
"prices No lives were loft by the ftorm.

parcels of land, which we call crofts, held immediately of the 
proprietor, and renting from 1 1. los. to 3I. Thefe are ge- 
nerally poffeffed by day-labourers and mechanicks. No part 
of the lands here is let by the acre, and I believe they are mo- 
dcratly rented upon the whole j and, in fome particular cafes, 
very low. I have not, as yet, got an account of the number 
j of acres which this diftiia contains-, and I cannot ftate pre-

The vegetable produce of this parifli has already been men-

I about 500 black cattle, of a fmall fize ; between 80 and 90 
\ horfes of middle fize, and about 1300 flieep, all white, with 
very few exceptions, whofe carcafes are fmall, and their wool 
coarfe, and not very plentiful, the fleeces weighing fcarcely 
I lib. each, at an average. I cannot ftate exaftly what part 
p£ the produce of this diftrift is carried to market out of the 
parifh. But in all ordinary feafons, a confiderable quantity 
of oatmeal, bear, and oats, is fent to Aberdeen, befides do- 
meftic fowls, eggs, cheefe and butter, and fometimes fed cattle, 
particularly calves, and fome fheep, for the butcher *.

Occupations and General CharaBer, &amp;c. — There are 4 wea« 
vers, 3 tailors, x blackfmith, 3 flioemakers, 2 joiners, and i 
cartwrigh*k None of thefe manufafture articles for fale, but 
■work for the inhabitants of the parifh and neighbourhood. 
There are alfo a grocers, one of whom is a diftiller. All the 
left, except the principal landholder, his family and domeftics, 
are farmers, cottagers, and farm fervants. The women never 
work in the fields but in harveft. They are conftantly em- 
ployed in houfehold affairs, and fn knitting coarfe worfted 
{lockings for exportation, which is the only manfadure which

cuke in tbe manufaftured ftockings, and give out wool once a- 
month. A woman who is confidered as a good knitter, will 
finifh 2 pairs in a week, if the worfted is fpun to her; for 
which fte receives from the hofier 2 s. 4 cl-. or 2 s. 6 d. The 
fpinning cofts 8 d. So that the utmoll that a woman employ- 
ed in this manufafture can earn, is a s. 2 d. a-week. Several 
of the men, when they become old, and unfit for working in 
the fields, employ themfelves in fpinning and knitting. Some 
of the boys likewife are fo employed in winter. My ac- 
quaintance with my parifhioners commenced very early ; for I 
was born in the pariih, and, unlefs when I attended the uni- 
verfity, refided conftantly in it, till 1 was 17 years of age; 
and I have always obferved them to be, with few exceptions, 
fober, frugal, and induftrious, very decent and feriousin what 
regards religion, but far from being wild or fanatical ; much 
attached to their minifters, of whom they have had fix with- 
in the laft 40 years, and much beloved by them ; peaceable 
in their intercourfe with one another, and, in general, honeft 
in their dealings. No perfon remembers to have heard of an 
inhabitant of this parifti undergoing a criminal trial *. There 
are two public houfes ; but they are very little frequented, 
unlefs by travellers, and about 5 or 6 of the inhabitants of 
the parifti, the only perfons in it who have not a good title 
to the charafter of fober. Several of the natives have, in my 
memory, inlifted in the army ; but the people, in general, are 
Hot fond of a military life. They are all Scotch, moft of them 

natives 



* There was, indeed, a murder committed in it about 30 years ago. It was 
the confequence of a drunken quarrel. The murderer, who, by the by, was 
not a native of the parifti, and had been but fliort time in it, evaded a profecu- 
tion by an immediate flight. If any fuicide has ever been committed in the 
'pariih, it muft have been long ago, for no fuch event is remembered by the old- 
eft now living.

natives of the parifli. They are all of the Eftabliflicd Chui.j, 
except 5 Burgher Seccders, 15 Epifcopalian*, (formerly Nor, 
jurors), and 1 Catholic, a very late convert from the Efta- 
blifhed religion. The Epifcopalians appear fomctimes in tin 
parifh church : the Scceders and the Catholics are never fee n 
ihcre. 

The inhabitants of this pari(h feera, in general, to be as v/ell 
pleafed with their lot as any in fimilar ftations in this part o£ 
Scotland. I know of no oppreffion that they labour under ; 
and I have always obferved, that it is with reludance, tliat 
any perfon or family, who have been for fome time in the pa- 
rifh, remove from it to another. There is no doubt, however, 
that theij: litiiation, and that of all the inhabitants of Aber- 
deenfhire of their rank, might be meliorated, if agriculture, 
and the eftablifliment of manufaftures, were properly encou- 
raged. And I fufpe£l that the landholders cannot efFeftually 
promote thofe two great objeds, without public aid, however 
much they may be difpofed to do fo. Without bridges, bet- 
ter roads than we have at prefcnt, and navigable canals, it is 
not likely that any confiderable improvement will take place 
in the county. The eftablifliment of great manufaauring 
houfes at Aberdeen, operates, as yet, againft the landed inte- 
reft. While it is every year raifing this price of labour, it has 
in no degree raifed the price of grain, and has had very little 
efFea on that of cattle. It has produced a moft diftrefling 
fcarcity of farm-fervants, which, in a country fo little itnprov- 
edj mUft be ruinous in a very high degree. 

-Poor The number of parifh-poor is commonly between 

ao and 30. The whole yearly fum which the kirk-feffion 
have under their management, for the benefit of the poor, is 
about 18 1., which arifes from the weekly colkaions in the 
church, and the intereft of fome legacies. There is alfo the

iS-ord vras icmoved from all Lis employments, and it was not, at that feafon, a 
recoramendatioa at the Court of England. In 1710, vchen Baron Bothmer was 
fent Envoy extraordinary from the Court of Hanover to that of Great Britain 
on a very critical occafion, he \yas inflran;ed to ccmmunicate, in every thing 
relating to what he was charged with at the Com t of London, with Mr. Eur- 
nett, then there, and Mr. Burnett was defined by her Eledioral Ilighnefs to give 
Baron Bothmer his advice and afliftance, in a letter written by the Secretary, 
fealed vi-ith the Eledlrcfs's fignet, and accompanied with this gracious declara- 
tion of her intentions. ' S. A. E. Madam m'ordonne de vous bien remercier de

acceffion ; but, being old and infirm, had retired from the wcffld; and He did 
not live to receive thole rays of the late kind's (George the L) gooclnefsj which 
his Majefty was fo gracious as fignify he intended him, in aiifwer to a letter 
that Mr. Burnett look the liberty to write, acquainting his Majefty of his hav-.

always remember, witli his name, the bleffings which were derived to the na-

coufin the Honourable Thomas Burnett, Judge of the Common Pleas, feverai 
letters from her Serene Highnefs the Ele5lrefs to his father, that Ihow how

mentioned in them, and as he hoped for an occafion of employing them for the; 
fervice of this fon of Mr. Burnett, whom he knew and efteemed." 

Thus far the manufcript. — Judge Burnett died fuddenly of a fit of apoplexy^

Their wages are from 5I. to 7L yearly; by far too high for 
the prefent ftate of agriculture in Aberdeenfhire. Laft fca-

been given as wages tor the harveft, by lump, at no great

not rent a fmall piece of ground, either of the proprietor or of a tenant, which 
enables him to keep a cow or two, to fupply his fomily with milk, and to rear 
fome young cattle almoft every year. As it is not eafy to eftimate the advan- 
tages he derives from his little farm, it is difficult to afcertain exaftly either his 
income or his cxpenfe. His wife and children are commonly fed and clothed 
with as much frugality as is confiftent with any degree of comfort ; and the 
children of both fexes are very early taught to knit ftockings for the manufac-

Price of Prowfions.—lt is from the Aberdeen market chiefly that the parilh 
is fapplied with the little butcher-meat which is confumed in it. Meal is ge- 
nerally id. or J-d. the peck cheaper than in the Aberdeen market, and the or- 
dinary price is regulated by the quantity to be fold in the country in general- 
Hence, it is of very great confequence, both to the fellers and confumcrs, that 
we have judicious corn-laws, if we mull have corn-laws, the propriety of 
which is very difputable. Butter fells commonly for 7d. the pound, of 28 ounces^

manfa was built in 1680, by Dr. James Willox, then mini- 
ller of Kemnay, and at his fole expenfe *. The church is 
48 years older than the manfe. It was new roofed, plafter- 
ed, and adorned in the infide, with great tafte and elegance, 
by the late Mr. Burnett of Kemnay ; but the walls are not

* The Bifliop of Aberdeen and his afleffors had, upon Dr. Willox's petition, 
ai^ointed a new manfe at Kemnay, which was built by the heritors, and pro- 
nounced fufEcient by the Bifliop and his prefbyters. But Dr. Willox was fo 
Hiuch difpleafed with it, that he immediately began to build a houfe for him- 
felf, which was finiflied in 1 680, as appears from the infcription over the entry, 
which contains his own and his wife's name, and the date of the building. The 
h»ufe built by the heritors was converted into a barn, and continued to be 
occupied as fuch till the year 17S6, when it made way for a new brew- 
houfe, all the offices having been new built in that year. The walls of the 
manfe are built of ftone and mortar. They are very thick, and plaftered on 
the inGde wiUi clay. It was, when it was built, and many years after, fo 
much fuperior in every refpedl to the otljpr manfes in this part of Scotland, that 
from its Angularity, and from the circumftance of the minifter having been at 
the expenfe of the building, it was long known by the name of Caftle Folly. 
The floors and roof have been occafionally repaired ; but no addition to it has 
been made. And yet, though there is not fo much room in it as in modern 
manfes, it is ftill no uncomfortable houfe. 

f State of the Parijh in 178a and 1783. — I did not refide ia Kemnay dur- 
ing thofe two years. But from occafional vifits to it, which were pretty fre- 
quent, I learned that a great number of the inhabitants were in extreme dif- 
trefs, owing to the latenefs of the harveft, and the unexampled feverity of the 
feafon in 1782, and the impoflibility of procuring good feed in fpring T783. 
Scarcely any of the corns were ripened here, before the froft came on in 1782. 
The majority of the inhabitants lived on pcafe and barley-meal, imported at 

Aberdeen.

mountainous, and, in the upper parts, very ftormy in win. 



^Sriculture, &amp;c — The foil, in general, is hot and fiiallow, but 
produces good grain, though proportionably little fodder. 
Sowing begins about ihe middle or end of M^rch, and reaping 
about tlie middle or end of Auguft, except in the upper parts 
of the parilhes, where the foil is cold and wet, and there feed- 
time and harveft may be a or 3 weeks later. The crops are 
bear, oats, rye, p-afe, potatoes, and fmall quantities of flax. 
The arable ground bears but a fmall proportion to the far- 
rounding mountains, which afford excellent pafture for flieepj 
and the people have hitherto paid much more attention ttt 
their flocks than to their farms. Agriculture may be faid to 
be only in its infancy here ; but it is capable of very great im- 
pr oven, ents. And if the inhabitants would adopt and perfe- 
vere in th it fpirit of indurtry which is beginning to appear 
among a few ol them, 1 have not the leaft doubt but th.ut, in 
a few years, they would be independent of other countries for 
grain. Sevpral things, indeed, are againft them j their coun- 
try is open, and winter-herding is not known, or, at leaft, it 
is looked upon as an intolerable grievance, and therefore not 
pra£tifed ; many of them have no leafes on their p fftffions, 
and the others but fliort ones : and, which periiaps is worft 
of all, being accuftomed from their infancy to a paftoral Hfe, 
they contrafl a habit of indolence incompatible with a good 
farmer. From the time that harveit is over, which is gene- 
rally about the middle of October, they neither yoke a plough, 
nor do any thing about their farms till the feed time comes 
on, when man, woman, and child are employed in huddling 
over the work in th/e moft fuperficial manner. And when 
the buitle oi lowing is over, all concern about the farm is

again laid afide fill harveft begins. I fpeak this in general; 
there are a few excepted who pay more attention, and whofe 
farms make them very grateful returns. Their farms, or ra- 
ther crofts, are by far too fmall, few of them exceed 12, and, 
in general, they are from 5 to 8 acres. It occurs to me, that 
the beft means for improving the country, and exciting a fpi- 
rit of induftry among the people, would be to annex 2 or 3 
farms together, and to have none under 20 or 30 acres, to 
grant leafes of 19 years at leaft, to give the tenant encourage- 
ment to enclofe, and trench balks, &amp;c. and even to give him 
for fome time a fmall premium for the acre of good turnips, 
or hay raifed after turnips. This would have a tendency to 
raife a fpirit of emulation, which would turn to the advantage 
both of the proprietor and tenant. By managing their ground 
in this way, the face of the country would be improved, a 
fufficiency of grain raifed, and the flocks better fupported in 
ftorm than they are at prefent. For one acre of hay or tur- 
nips would go farther in that way, than ail the fodder that 
grows upon fome of their fmall farms by the prefent manage- 
ment. I am aware of one obje£tion againft reducing the num- 
ber of farms, and that is, that it would reduce the number 
of inhabitants alfo. This, no doubt, in fome degree, might 
be the cafe : but if every tenant fliould be allowed 3 or 4 fub- 
tenants, who might be ufefully employed about the farm, or in 
looking after the flocks, the decreafe of population would be 
very little, if any at all. But I leave it to thofe who are 
more interefted to determine, whether it be better to allow 
the country to remain in its prefent unimproved ftate, and to 
fofter the indolence of the people, or to lead them on by in- 
duftry to improve tlie country, and their own circumftan- 
ces.

when properly managed. He took this farm, which confifts 
of nearly loo acres arable, and about the fame number of 
patture arfiong natural wood, into his own hands only a few 
years ago ; he cnclofedand fubdivided it with ftone-fences and 
hedges, levelled and llraighted the fields ; trenched up balks, 
and drained marlhes ; and now raifes from it bear, oats, peafe, 
potatoes, turnips and hay, of as good quality as any in Aber- 
deenaiire. The acre, after turnips, yields at an average, 8 bolls 
of bear, and the whole of the farm, under crop, gives the 6th 
return. His garden produces as early, and well flavoured fruit 
as any in the N. of Scotland ; apples, pears, plumbs, cher- 
ries, goofeberries, &amp;c — And while Mr. Gordon farms to ad- 
vantage, he has not loft fight of neatnefs and elegance ; he has 
cleared away the rubbifli of nature about his villa, and dif- 
played her beauties, which are many, to the beft advantage. 
But the example of Mr. Gordon, or of any gentleman, will 
never be attended with any good confequences to the tenants ; 
they look upon all that he has done as the fole efFeft of mo- 
ney, and far beyond their reach. And until fome adive en- 
terprifing genius among themfelves fteps forward and fets 
the example, they will never go out of the old track j and this 
cannot be expefted till they get leafes upon their pofleiSons. 
But if ever they fliall be brought to pay more attention to 
their ground, I am certain a regard to their own interefl will 
nnake then- perfevere 5. for the climate is temperate, and the 
foil, though thin, is early' and fertile. But while I accufe 
the men of indolence, I Ihould do great injuflice to the wo- 
men, if I did exempt them from the charge ; by whofe in- 
duftry and diligence their families are in a great meafure fup- 
ported. Their chief employment is fpinning flax, fent up by 
fome manufadlurers from Aberdeen, which brings a great deal 
of money into the country. During the fummer months,,ma-

Manners, &amp;c.-The people are honeft, economical, fober, 
contented, and hofpitable ; very regular in attending upon di- 
vine worfliip, and Warmly attached to their country ; their 
language is Englifh, except in the upper parts of the parilhes 
of Tulloch and Glengairn, where fome of them ufe a barba- 
rous dialed of the Gaelic among themfelves, but they all un- 
derftand the Englilh. Their fize, in 'general, is from 5 feet 
5 inches, to 5 feet 8 inches high ; they are ftout made, heiilthy, 
jind capable of great fatigue. Fever of different kinds pre- 
vail fometimes ; but there is no difeafe peculiar to the coun- 
try. The air is pure and dry, and reckoned very wholefomc: 
and yet there is only one inftance of extreme old age remem- 
bered here. A John Mitchell, aged 124, born in the parifti 
ofGlenmuick in 1598, and died in 1722; the date of his 
birth and death is ftill very legible on his tomb-ftone. The 
fuel ufed here is peats and turfs from the adjacent hills ; thej 
are both good of their kinds, but attended with great ex- 
penfe, as they lie at the back of very fteep mountains. 

Population, &amp;c According to Dr. Webfter's report, the 

number of fouls then, was 2270. At prefent the population, 
Sec. is as follows : 

Population, - an7 Papifts, - - 354 
Proteftants, - 1763 Males*, - - 965 

E e 2 Females, 



* That the number of males fliould be fo much lefs than that of the females, 
is owing to many of the young men going to the South and Low Countries to 
fervice, becaufe they cannot get employment at home.

' Statiflical Jccoutit 

Glenmuick Pari/I,.~ Glean mnc, are two Gaelic words which 
- fignify the " Sow's Valley," from which it fhould feem, that 
that animal had fome time run wild here, as none are now 
kept by the inhabitants. This parifti is about 15 miles in 
length, and lies entirely on the S. fide of Dee. The prefent 
nunfe and glebe ftand in this parilh on the N. bank of the 
fmall river Muick, about 200 yards from its jundion with 
the Dee. The manfe is an old houfe, fmall, but in tolerable 
repair. The glebe, by a late addition, contains 6i- acres. 
The ftipend, including the fmall tithes of the parilh of Tul- 
loch, is67l. 12 s. Sterling, all in money. The church of 
Glenmuick ftands clofe by the manfe. It is a very old houfe 
thatched with heath. It feems to have been dedicated to the 
Virgin Mary, from an annual meeting of the inhabitants on 
Candlemas day. There is a parochial fchool here, with * 
falary of 100 merks in money. The fmall river Muick takes 
its rife in the Grampian hills, from a large lake or loch of 
the fame name, S. W. of the church, and after forming a 
large water-fall, called the Lin of Muick, is loft in the Dee, 
after a courfe of 10 miles. Acrofs the Muick, and near the 
church, there is a very ufeful and fubftantial ftone bridge of 
one arch, built about 50 years ago by fubfcriptiop, and about 
half a mile below the church, a beautiful bridge of three 
large arches j and a fmall one at each end, called the Bridge 
of Ballatar, was lately built by fubfcription, and other contri- 
butions, under the patronage of the late Francis Farquharfon, 
Efq. of Monaltrie ; a gentleman who has left ;many lafting 
monuments of his public fpirit in this country. In this pa- 
xifli are the celebrated wells of Pananich, on the N. fide of 
a hill of the fame name, about 2 miles E. of the church *.

They are a mineral of a very agreeable tafte, light water, and 
allowed to be of ufe in gravelifh, fcorbutic, and fcrofulous 
complaints. The wells being the property of the gentleman, 
already mentioned (Mr. Farquharfon) he cleared out the 
fprings, which are three, and covered them ; and ereded not 
only feveral houfes upon the fpot for the accommodation of 
the water drinkers, as a public and private bath, an oftagon 
for the better fort to retire to, and feveral houfes for fhelter- 
ing the poor ; but alfo built a large and commodious houfe 
called Pananich Lodge, pleafantly fituated upon the banks of 
the Dee, about a mile W. of the wells, containing a large 
public room, and a number of private ones, with accommo- 
dation for fervants and horfes, which, with a tolerable farm, 
and the houfes at the wells, is let to a landlady at 50 1. year- 
ly, who has the good fortune to give univerfal fatisfadtion to 
the company who vifit her. Mr. Farquharfon likewife made 
out good roads on both fides of the wells to the public road ; 
nor did he confine himfelf to this fpot ; he paid particular at- 
tention to the roads wherever he had the lealt concern ; he 
made new, repaired old ones, and threw ftone arches over 
feveral fmall, but rapid rivulets, which, when flooded, were 
often impaffable, at his own private expenfc. In a word,

TuUoch FariJJi. — Tulloch is a corruption of Tulach, a Gaelic 
word, fignifying " rifing grounds or hillocks and is very de- 
fcriptive of the fmall village of Tulloch, which gives name 
to the church and parifli. The church is faid to have been 
founded by St. Nethalen, and an annual meeting of the in- 
habitants is regularly kept on the 8th of January, in honour 
of his memory. It is termed ihe Mother Church, and flands 
(as the ^Nho{t parifh does) on the N. fide of Dee, about 2 
miles N. E. of the church of Glenmuick. This parifti is the 
moft populous and extenfive of the 3, and by a lift of the re- 
ligious houfes in Scotland, feems to have belonged in whole 
or in part, to the Knights Templar. It is i8 miles in length 
from E. to W., and interfered at the Crags of Ballatar, by 
the parifti of Giengairn, which divides the lower parts of 
Tulloch from the upper. It does not appear that there has 
been any fettled minifter, particularly in this pariih, fmce the 
laft Popifli Prieft, of the name of Sandifon, who is faid to 
have conformed at the Reformation, and afterward married : 
fome of his pofterity are ftill in the neighbourhood. The 
glebe and toft of the manfe are ftill pointed out ; but the mi- 
nifter now has no benefit from either. In the lower end of

* Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — There are two ruins in this parifli, the one 
ilands about a mile N. W. of the church called the Caflle of the Cnoe, a Gaelic 
word, lignifying a hill upon the top of which the ruin ftands. It belongs to Mr. 
Gordon of Abergeldie, and is of a very old date. The other ftands in the E. 
extremity of the parifti called Dee Caftle, formerly Candacorl, the Head of the 
Wood, faid to be built tiy the family of Gordon, and now the property of the 
Earl of Aboyne. There is a birch tree growing in a room of the ruin where 
the firft Marquis of Huntly is faid to have been born. It is faid, that there is 
a rock of coarfe marble in the hill above Pananich Lodge, and another abovs 
BirkhaU.

this parifli, and at the foot of die hiU of Culblean, there is a 
beautiful lake of about 3 miles in circumference, called Loch 
Cannor, containing fcveral fmall iHands, upon the largeft of 
which, there ftood formerly a fmall foitrefs, faid to have been 
built, and occafionally occupied as a hunting feat by Malcolm 
Canmore; from whom, it is not improbable, the lake might 
have got its name ; as Cannor is not far in found from Can- 
more. In this fortrefs, manj of the Cumings took fhelter af- 
ter their defeat in the famous battle of Culblean, fought be- 
tween them and the troops of King David Bruce in 1335. 
There is now no appearance of the fortrefs, the Hones are all 
cleared out and thrown into the furrounding lake ; and the 
iaand, which meafures near an acre, is under culture. .The 
people in the neighbourhood, fome years fince, were in ufe 
to drag up large planks of oak from the bottom of that part 
of the lake between the ifland and main land on the N. fide, 
evidently part of a draw-bridge which conneded the ifland 
with the land 5 the wood was perfeflly frefli and wholefome ; 
and upon one of the planks there was this date, 1113, which 
is now in the poiTeffion of a gentleman in this neighbourhood. 
There is another ifland fmaller than the former, and at fome 
diftance from it, which tradition fays, was the prifon of the 
«aftle, and which goes to this day by the name of the Tol- 
booth. The principal ifland where the fortrefs or cafl:le ftood-, 
is about 60 or 79 yards diftant from the land ; and the water 
between them, where the .draw-bridge was, is i5 feet deep. 
The lake abounds with pike and eels. Wild ducks, wild 
geefe, and fometimes fwans, frequent it in winter. There is 
a ftone fet on its end on the N. bank af the lake fronting the 
caflile, with a great deal of carving upon it ; but the figures 
are now unintelligible. It is told, that it was put up in me- 
mory of fome of the Cumings who fell in the chafe or battle

Glengairn Tarijh — Glengairn is a corruption of 3 Gaelic 
words, glean, " a valley or hollow," and garhh amham, " the 
rough water," which are very properly applied to the water of 
Gairn, the channel of which, in many places is exceedingly 
rocky. The church Hands on the N. fide of Dee, and at the 
influx of the Gairn into that river about 2 miles W. of Tul- 
loch, and nearly the fame diftance N. of the church of Glen- 
muick. This church feems to have been dedicated to Sf 
Mungo, from an annual meeting of the parilliioners on the 
13th of January. Some fay, that this was a feparate charge 
about the middle of the laft century, when a Mr. Alexander 
Gordon, a proprietor in the parifh, was minifter ; but neither 
the glebe, nor where the manfe flood, can now be pointed 
out. This parifh is the leaft, and moft compaft of the 3. 
The greateft part of it lies upon both banks of the Gairn, 
extending 6 miles N. W. of the church, where the upper 
parts of Tulloch begin and feparate it from the pariih of 
Crathie. A fmall part of it lies on the S. fide of Dee, call-

* In the fore men);ioned of Culbjean, there is a moft remarkable hollow 
rock, which, from its fliape, bears the name of the Vatt, and through which 
a rivulet runs. In going up to vifit this natural curiofity, a llranger is much 
llruck with the narrownefs of the entry to the Vatt (being Icfs than an ordi- 
nary door) and the large fpacious area, in which he immediately finds himfelf 
endofed.by rocks from 50 to 60 feet high, and from tlie fiflures pf which tall and 
healthy birch trees are growing. There is ore particular clift of the rock 
which the eagle generally occupies as a fafe and fecure afylum for hatching and 
nourilhing her young, and where her neft is always to be feen. The rivulet 
falls down at the upper end through broken Mattered rocks, and when flooded 
adds greatly to the piilurefque appearance of the whole. The moft remark- 
able hill in this, "or the 3 pariflies, is Morven, which in Gaelic fignifies a large 
kill ; and the well known crags or Pa'fs of Ballatar, where the tremendous im. 
pending rocks threaten the aftoniflied traveller with immediate deftrudlion.

cd Strathgirnie. There are ^ of the Society's fchools in this 
parilh, and are an unfpeakable advantage to the people. I 
am told that 60 or 7© years ago, it was rare to find one inl 
all thefe three parifhes who could read. But now all the 
young people read diftinftly, and underftand the principles of 
religion ; and many of the young men leave fchool, and im- 
mediately enter as clerks to commercial companies in diffe- 
rent corners of the world. And it is but juft to obferve, that 
much of this is owing to the labours of Mr. George Thom-^ 
fon, who has ferved the Society about 50 years, during which 
time he has taught, with the greateft honour to himfelf, and 
advantage to his pupils. The people, in general, have got a 
tafte for education, and as the pariflies are extenfive, they 
engage young men to teach in the winter feafon in thofe 
places which are at a diftance from the eftablilhed fchools. 
Three young men, engaged by the people, taught in diiferent, 
corners this laft winter. 

Mifcellaneous Ohfervaiicns. — At the church of Glengairn, 
there is a very old ftone bridge of one arch over Gairn, and 
there is another over the fame river at the N. W. extremity 
of the parifti, and 6 miles from the former, built by Go- 
vernment upon one of the Highland roads ; both are in good 
repair. There is another of one arch over the buni of Gir= 
nie, built a few years fince by fubfcription. There is a river 
in the lower end of this parifti, near the Pafs of Ballatar, 
called the Caftle of Glengairn. It belonged to the family of 
Forbes, and was ufed as a hunting feat. It is now the pro- 
perty of the Earl of Aboyne— A PopiOi Prielt refides in this 
parifti, and performs divine worftiip every 2d Sunday, in a 
chapel built for the purpofe— It is believed there is a lead- 
mine near the caftle of Glengairn many pieces of lead have 
been found ; but from the expenfe of working it, no exer-

tions have been made to find out the vein of the metal. There 
IS plenty of lime-flone in this and the other two pariflies; but 
from the difficulty of getting fuel, there is not much of it 
burnt. The mountains in the 3 pariflies are all covered with 
heath, and the bottoms of many of them beautifully fringed 
with natural wood and plantations. Plots of natural birch, 
oak, afh, alder, &amp;c. are interfperfed among the arable fields ; 
■which, with the rivers, give the country a very pleafant ap- 
pearance in fummer. The hills afford plenty of moor game, 
particularly Morven, upon the higheft grounds of which, 
ptarmagans are always to be found *. 

NUM- 

* The moll remarkable of the other wild creatures, are red and roe deer, 
foxes, badgers, wild cats, polecats, martins, weafels, otters, white and grey- 
hares ; eagles and lefler hawks ; the black cock, wood cock, wood i)ecker, plo- 
vers, partridges, &amp;c. with a great variety of finging birds. 

The charge is ferved by the minifter, and a miffionary minifter, who has a 
lalary of 25 1. from the Committee on the Royal Bounty. And, befides the 3 
churches,, there is another place of worfliip at the upper bridge of Gairn, where 
the miffionary is appointed by the Committee to preach every zd Sabbath ; and 
by thefe meansthere can be fermon but once in the 7, weeks in each of the place.? 
of worfliip, which is very much complained of by the people. But, as i cen- 
trical church would remove this grievance, fo no place can be better adapted 
for one ; for the 3 churches immediately form nearly an equilateral triangle of 
2 miles each fide ; and if a large houfe ftiould be built near the middle of this 
angle, the bulk of the 3 pariflies weuld be accommodated with fermon every 
Sabbath, and the miffionary would preach in the remote corners. This plan 
has been long in the view of the heritors ; and, as 2 of the churches are going 
fall into difrepair, it is to belioped they will £bon carry, it into e.\ecution.

NUMBER XIX. 
TOWN AND PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1010266">K I N G H O R N</name>. 
(CooNir AND Synod of Fife, Presbytery of Kirkcaldy.) 
By the Rev. Mr. John Usher. </head>



<p>Sit7tation, Name, Kxtejit, Soil, &amp;g. 

THE town of Kingliorn, is pleafantly fituated upon a de- 
clivity on the N. fide of the Frith of Forth, nearly 
oppofite to the town of Leith, and diftant from it about 7 
miles. At what time this town was firft built, it is perhaps, 
impoffible for us, at prefent, to determine. It is not impro- 
bable, that the aborigines of the country, would fettle here, 
at a very early period, for the conveniency of fifhing *, eveii 
before cither commerce, or agriculture, or pafturage, had 
become objefts of attention to their uncultivated minds. How- 
ever this may be, it is next to certain, that when Edinburgh, 
began to rife into a capital, and to become a place of refort, 

fifliermeni 

* There was formerly a confidcrable quantity of fifli caught between the 
town of Kinghorn and the ifland of luch-Kcith j but of late the fifli have re. 
tired nearer to the mouth of the Frith. 



Stati/iical Account 

fiihermen and fallors would naturally be induced to build and 
take up their refidence here for the fake of fcrving the paf- 
fage between Fife and Leith, the port of Edinburgh *. With 
refpea to the origin of the name of this town, we have not 
been able to difcover any thing certain, and will therefore 
venture to ofter a conjeaure. Upon a rifing ground, imme- 
diately behind the town, ove?looking it, and commanding a 
view of the whole Frith of Forth, from Kinghorn down- 
wards, and of all the oppofite coaft, there formerly ftood a 
caftle, the ruins of which were very lately to be feen, which 
■was one of the ordinary feats of our ancient Kings. This 
place of refidence was probably chofen by the Scottifli Mo- 
narchs, not only for the fake of the profped which it com- 
mands, and the falubrity of the air, but for the conveniency 
and pkafure bf hunting. For, tradition fays, and the names 
of places in the neighbourhood confirm it (fuch as Woodfield- 
park, and Kingfwood-end f) that the ground behind the 
town, and to the weflward, was once covered with wood. 
From the w^inding, therefore, of the King's horn, when fal- 
iying out with his attendants to take the diverfion of the 
1 chafe, 

* in confirmation of this, we may obferve, that the part of the town whicli 
ilands upon the fea-fliore, and neareft to the harbour, is evidently the oldeft. 
So early, as about the middle of the nth century, in the reign of Duncan I. 
we are informed that Canutus King of Norway, fent a large fleet with 9000 
men, commanded by his brother, who lawding at Kinghorn, over-ran and ra- 
T?aged the adjacent cquntry ; but that M'Beath, Thane of Fife (with whofe 
fharacirer and hiftory every admirer of the inimitable Shakefpeare muft be u\ 
fome meafure acquainted) attacked and defeated them with great flaughter, 
forcing the furvivors to retire to their fliips. It was not, however, till near a 
century after this, that the town of Kinghorn was invcfted with the privilege? 
of a royal burgh, by King David I. 

f Woodfield-park, Kingfwood-end. The former of thefe is a farm about 
a mile to the W. of the town, the latter is a high and rugged rock, at much 
about the fame diftance From the tovvm, and on the fame fide of it, where King 
Alexander III. was killed by a" fall from his horfe when hunting io this foreft. 



Of Kinghorn. 



phafe, the town of Kinghorn may have derived the name 
which it Hill bears. 

The parilh of Kinghorn is about 4 miles in length, and 3!- 
in breadth. It is bounded by the Frith of Forth on the S.

the face of this parifli. It exhibits, it is true, neither loftj 
mountains nor deep valleys ; neither high hilk, nor exten- 
five plains ; but there is a variety of foil and of furface, and 
an undulation ef ground, which is very feldom to be met 
with. The long extended fides of little hills covered with 
furze, ever-green, and almoft always in bloom, or planted 
with young and thriving trees of different kinds ; the ricb 
and fertile land that lies between the great number of gen- 
tlemen's feats and farmer's houfes, with trees and enclofures 
around them, and with here and there a ruin interfperfed, as 
mementos of the viciffitude of human things, prefent to the 
eye a moft pifturefque and fanciful fcene, and produce upon 
the imagination the fineft efFeft. The foil is, in general, very 
good, being moftly a rich black earth upon a rotten rock. 
Along the fea-coaft, for upwards of 2 miles, it is deep, 
ftrong, and fertile in the higheft degree. As you retire from 
the fea, it gradually becomes more and more light and fiial- 
low, for about a mile, as the ground rifes. Behind this, 
the ground begins to fall, and the nature of the foil becomes 
more variable, being fome of it inclined to clay, upon a 
whin-ftone bottom, but moft of it, thin and light upon a dry 
gravel. Almoft every where throughout the whole parifli, 
it is fliarp and very fertile, when properly managed.

bounds of this pnrifli, unlefs perhaps the ruinous tower of 
Scafield, the ancient feat of the Moutrays, which ftands upon 
the fea-fliore, about a mile to the eaftward of Kinghorn ; and 
St. Leonard's tower, which ftands in the middle of the town, 
which in times of Popery was a place of worfliip, but is 
now converted into a town-houfe and common prifon, defervc 
to be fo called. Glammis tower, a feat of our ancient kings ^ 
already alluded to, is now no more ; and as for the monaf- 
tery which flood fomewhere about the bottom of the town, 
there is not fo much as a vcftige of it to be feen, and even 
the place where once it was, cannot be afcertained. At a 
little diftance from the ruins of Seafield tower, there is a 
large cave, which appears either to have been formed by 
fome violent concuffion of the earth, or to have been exca- 
vated by the fea, which has fince retired. There is the ap- 
pearance of fome kind of building having been once at its 
entrance ; but whether it kad been thus fortified and fecured 
as a place of refuge from the fudden defcents of the Danes 
and Norwegians, with which this coaft was formerly fo much 
infeiled, or, as a den for thieves and robbers, and as a place 
for concealing their ill-got booty, we have not been able to 
difcover. About half way between Kinghorn and the Petty- 
cur *, clofe by the fea, there is a fpecimen of the Bafaltes, 
v/hich well defer ves the attention of the curious, who may 
not have had an opportunity of furveying thofe more ftu- 
pendous works of nature of the fame kind, the Giants Caufe- 
way, in the county of Antrim in Ireland, or the rock Pere- 
neire near St. Sandoux in Auvergne, in France. The Bafal- 
tic columns are of different diameters, with between 4, 5, 6, 
7, faces. They are, in general, about 12 or 14 feet in 

height,

one another, and inclining towards the fea, to the E. The 
ftreani of lava, of which this mafs of matter is compofed, 
appears to have flowed from W. to E., and pouring into the 
fea, in this direftion, from its impulfe and refiftance, to have 
cooled, and chryftalized, and taken the eafterly inclination 
which it holds. At a little dillance from the Pettj-cur, there 
is a medicinal fpring, commonly called the Kinghorn Spa *. 

Upon Inch-Keith, a fmall ifland about half way between 
Kinghorn and Leith, and which is confidered as belonging to 
this parilh, there are the ruins of a fort which was in repair

garrifoned with French foldiers. 

Population. — Upon comparing the late with the prefent 
ftate of the population of this pariih, the number of inhabi- 
tants appears to have decreafed to a confiderable degree. Re- 
cording to the returns made to Dr. Webfter in the 1755, the 
number of fouls within the bounds of this parifli, was 2389. 
It now amounts to no more than 1768, including perfons of

« In the year 1618, the cekbrated Dr. Anderfon, inventor of the pills that 
ftill go by his name, wrote a Treatife upon the nature and properties of this wa- 
ter, with diredtions for ufing it. 

It is impregnated, he fays, with chryftal, gypfum, and nitre ; is a powerful 
diuretic, gives vigour and ftrength to debilitated conftitutions, relieves fuch as 
are troubled with a difficulty of breathing, and allayeth all inflammations in- 
ternal and external ; that it ought to be taken in the morning fafting, and 
taken at the rock from which it iflues. 

But, for farther particulars, both with refpedl to the nature and properties of 
this water, and the way of uGng it, we muft refer the reader to the forefaid 
Treatife. We lhall only add, that Dr. Anderfon concludes his account of it. 
With informing us, that in his time, " this fair fpring" was much frequented ; 
and that he himfelf had many opportunities of obferving its falutary efFcdls, 
from his attending patients that were drinking the water.

this pan/h, there are iii8, that refide in the town, and '650

are 1237 t^^at adhere to the E,ftablifhed Church, the remain- 
"^0 53 1  are Seceders of different denominations, but moftly 
Burghers. Of the whole body of the people, both in the

between 10 and io, 321 ; between 20 and 50, 778 ; between 
50 and 70,. 24,0 : and between 70 and 100, 28. The number 
of married people amounts to 610; of bachelors, to 295 j of 
unmarried women from the age of 15 and upwards, to 323 ; 
of widows, to 102 ; and of widowers, to 33. The number 
of marriages for the lafl 10 years, amounts, at an average, 
to 13 ; and that of births,, to 30 annually. To account for 
the feeming difproportion between- the marriages and births, 
and the population of this pari£h,.we may obferve,- that there 
are annually, feveral irregular marriages, and feveral bap- 
tifms (particularly among the Seceders) that are not entered 
in the pariili regifter. The inhabitants of the town, and of 
the village called Bridgetown, are moftly failors, weavers,

* As we do not find, that by the return given in to Dr. Webfter, above menj,

country, it is impoflible for' us now to difcover with certainty, where the de- 
ficiency lies ; whether in the one, or in the other ; or fuppofing it in both, in 
what proportion it has taken place. We are difpofed to think that it is prin. 
cipally in the latter ; and that it may be accounted for, from the following 
caufes : — ijl, From the diminution of landed proprietors refiding in the parifli-; 
feveral fmall efliates having been fwallowed up by the larger, idly, From the 
union of farms. ;^di'y. And principally from the expulfion of cottagers, anJ 
from the employing of hired fervants in their Itead, for carrying on the opera-

the decay of its trade, we confider as compenfated by the growth of manufac- 
tures, as will afterward appear under the aiticle of commerce.

Ecclifiqftical State, Stipend, Poor, 'i^c — There are two pla. 
ces of public worftiip in the town of Kinghorn ; the parifli 
church, and a Burgher-feceder meeting-houfe. The Earl of 
Strathmore is patron of the parilh. The ftipend confifts of 3 
chalders of viftual, half nveal, half bear, and 58 1. 6 s. 8d. in 
money, together with 4 loads of coal, deliverable at the roanfe, 
and the teind of the fifli; The laft of thefe articles has fail- 
ed entirely, as there is no more at prefent, but one family of 
fiftiers in the town, and the quantity of filh caught fo fmall, 
that the teind thereof is not worth the trouble or expenfe df 
collefting it. 

There is alfo mentioned in the decreet of modification and- 
locality of the ftipend of Kinghorn, 14!. loads of coal at the 
pit of Garden ; but as this pit is not now wrought, this part 
of the living has likewife failed. The glebe confifts of very 
little more than 3^ acres of arable ground, with 10 s. a-year 
to compenfate for the deficiency of meafure ; and about an a- 
cre of grafs, which lets at 16 s. 8 d. The manfe is old, but 
got a thorough repair about 3 years ago, at a very confider- 
able expenfe. The church was rebuilt in 1774. The ftiell 
of the houfe is refpedable enough ; but within, it has ratlier 
an awkward and paltry appearance, from its not being as yet 
completely featcd, and from the mixture of new, and of old 
pews and forms *.

- • The Burgher meeting-houfe was built about l5 years ago, partly by difla-

blifhed Church in this place, who did not think that the late incumbent, Dr. 
Webfter, was fufficiently warm in his zeal againfl; the Popifh bill, which raifed 
fuch a noife and clamour in this part of the country at that period.

The number of poor is great, and the funds for fappoiting 
them are, comparatively, but fmall. There are commonlj be- 
tween 6o and 80 upon the poor's roll ; and for maintainlncr 
thefe, the whole fam to bediftributcd annually by the church- 
feffion, does not amount to 40 1. This fum arifes partly from 
tbe interell of legacies left for the behoof of the poor; and 
partly from the colleftions that are made for them at the door 
of the parifli church. The legacies amount to 500 1., 400 L 
of which was bequeathed by the Rev. Mr. Henry, minifter 
of this parifb, before the late Dr. Webfter ; and 100 1. by a 
gentleman of the name of Shanks, who lived in Kinghorn ; 
for both which, the church-feflion receives annually (at the 
rate of 4 per cent, intereft) the fum of 20 1. The yearly col- 
le£lions do not come to quite fo much ; and of this the land- 
ed proprietors contribute but a very fmall proportion, as the 
greateft part of them do not refide in the parifb, and as mofl 
of thofe that do, dwell at a diftance from the parilh church. 
The moft which any pauper in the parifb receives, (and in- 
deed which the church-feflion have it in their power to give, 
as the heritors have not as yet agreed to aflefs themfelves for 
the maintenance of the poor) is 1 s. a-month ; and perhaps 
3 s. 6 d. more a^ each of the quarterly diftributions. This 



This IiQufe was firft connedled with what is callp4 the Pfeftytery of Re-

and colledlions unequal to the .expenfe of fupporting a clergyman, and of pay. 
ing the intereft of the money which they had advanced, they yery prudently 
agreed to change their ground, to join themfelves to the Burgher Seceders, and 
to gi've a call to a licentiate of that denomination. The bulk of what remain- 
ed of their fcattered congregation went along with them, and they were joined 
by others of the fame clafs or fedl, refiding in the town and its neighbourhood. 
Amidft all thefe manoeuvres of their leaders, however, the name of a patron was 
not heard of. And it was all very well.

fcanty fupply is evidently inadequate to the exigencies of fuch 
as are unable to work ; the confequence-of which is, that they 
muft either beg, or Heal, or ftarve. What others receive is 
proportionally lefs; and thus, even the labour of fuch as could 
do a little, were the deficiency of their earnings to be oiade up 
to them by regular fupplies, is loft to the community, from 
their being forced by neceffity to hsive recourfe to begging ; 
fiffer which, every idea of labour and induftry is at an end *. 

Commerce and MamifaBures — The town of Kinghorn has 
2 harbours ; one at the bottom of the town, which is called 
the Kiric-harbour, from its vicinity to the church, which 
(lands upon a point of land clofe by it ; and another called the 
Petty-cur, at about half a mile's diftance from the town to 
the S. W. The former of thefe is of very ancient date : How

* And here, by the way, we cannot help obferving, that legacies left for the 
behoof of the poor, at leafl: in pariflies, where the law, with refpedl to the main- 
tenance of the poor is not enforced, have a tendency to defeat the very end for 
which they were bequeathed. For that, trufting to thefe, the heritors of fucli 
parilhes, are apt to negleifl what the law, what reafon, what religion and hu- 
manity fo loudly call upon them for, viz. " to confider the caufe of the poor." 
We would not be nnderftood, from what we have here faid, either to condemn, 
or difcourage the donations of the charitable at the time of their death, to the 
poor of parifhes tQ which they may belong, or to which they may be attached ; 
only let them be left in fuch a way, as to be diftributed immediately, and not be 
hung up, fo as to intercept that provifion which the wifdom and benevolence of 
our Legiflature has made for them. Having had occafion to mention legacies, 
we may here obferve, that the forefaid Mr. Henry bequeathed the fum of 300 I. 
for the purpofe of founding a burfary, to affift young men, in the profecution of 
their ftudies, at the Univerfit;^ of St. Andrew's. The nomination of the burfar 
is vefted in 3 bodies of men ; the magillrates and town-council of Kinghorn, 
^he kirk.feflion of Kinghorn, and the prefbytery of Kirkcaldy. Each of thefe 3 
bodies choofe a delegate out of their own number ; the delegates meet by ap- 
pointment of the minifter of Kinghorn, and, after having examined the qualifi- 
cations of the candidates, proceed to the eledtion. The burfar enjoys his bene- 
fice for 4 years.

-old it is, xve cannot certainly fay. The latter was built about 
30 years ago, as being a more convenient fituation than that 
of the former, for the paffage over to Leith. This harbour 
■was lately very much choked up, and in danger of being loft, 
from the great quantity of fand continually drifting from the 
W. at low water, with the wefterly winds, and accumulating 
within it. But by means of 2 bafons, the largeft of which 
■was only finiflbed within thefe few months, (the former hav- 
ing been found infulEcient for the purpofe), it is now thought 
that this bank of fand will be completely removed, and the 
harbour be kept clear of it, and open for the future. With- 
in thefe few months alfo, there has been a light-houfe ereded 
Jipon the end of this key, for the beneEt of the paffage-boats. 
It is, however, the opinion of many, that had the money 
■which has been expended upon the Petty-cur, and its bafons, 
been laid out upon the extending of the key, and upon the 
otherwife improving of the old harbour, not only all the pur- 
pofes of the Ferry might have been equally well anfwered, 
but a fafe and capacious bafon might have been formed, for 
the admiffion of ftiips of conliderable burthen. As they are 
at prefent, neither the one nor the other will admit veflels of 
above 150 tons. Should ever Kinghorn become a great ma- 
nufa£luring and commercial town, this plan might ftill be put 
in execution. Hitherto, it cannot be faid to have ever been 
either. Formerly, indeed, there were a few brigs, and feve- 
ral floops belonging to this town ; but thefe were generally 
either freighted by merchants refiding in other places, or en- 
gaged in fmuggling. At prefent there are only two fmall 
floops employed in the coafting trade, that fail from this port, 
with 9 paffage-boats, of about 50 or 60 tons each, and a few 
pinnaces that ply the ferry. As for manufadlures, though 
till of late, fmce the introduftion of llocking-frames, there 
was, for a long time, a confiderable quantity of thread-flock-.

irtgs, manufaaured annually by the women, with the kittlng- 
needle, yet it was always but an unprofitable, and poor em- 
ployment. Within thefe few years, however, a manufadure 
has fprung up, which promifes fair at prefent to render King^ 
horn one of the moft flourifhing towns upon the coaft of Fife; 
this is, the teafing, and rolling, and fpinning of cotton and flax, 
by means of the Arkwright and Darlington machinery. 

Through the middle of the town there runs a ftream of wa- 
ter, which iflues from a lake called the loch of Kinghorn, and 
diftant from it only about half a mile. Upon this Itream 
there have already been eredled,^ and fet a-going, 4 mills for the 
purpofes above mentioned j a fifth is to be built this fummer, 
and there might ftill be falls of water found for i or a more. 
The number of hands which thefe mills will employ, muft 
amount to fome hundreds ; but the 3 largeft of them, which 
were built laft feafon, owing to the ikock which has been late- 
ly given to public credit, and the confequent ftagnation of all 
bufinefs, have not as yet been completely fitted up, and filled 
with'machinery by the proprietors. Before adventuring too far, 
they with to fee what turn affairs may take. Already, how- 
ever, the beneficial efFe£ts of thefe works are to be feen by all; 
and they are fenfibly felt by almoft every defcription of peo- 
ple in the place.

needle, or by the knitting of ftockings, or by the fpinning o£ 
flax, above is. 6 d. or a s. in the week, can now eafily earu

girls, between 8 and 12 years of age, who before were a. bur- 
then to their fathers and mothers, by engaging at thefe works,, 
are not'only able to fupport themfelves,but to affifl their aged 
and indigent parents. The boys^ who before thought of no-

are the effeas of regular and well dircfted indudry I But the 
command of water for working machinery, is not the only 
advantage which Kinghorn enjoys : Befides the ftream alrea- 
dy mentioned, there are two other rivulets, one at each end 
of the town, by means of which bleachfields might be formed, 
and, it is to be hoped, will in a little time be formed, for far- 
ther facilitating the operations of the manufaflnrer. 

As a beginning has now been fairlj made ; as a fpirit of 
induftry and of enterprife has now been roufed, by the exer- 
tions of a few active individuals, it is to be hoped, that it 
will continue to fpread, and will foon begin to operate in o- 
ther direaions. The cheapnefs of coal for fuel, and of lime 
for building ; its vicinity to the fea, and to the capital of this 
partjof the kingdom, might alfo have been mentioned among 
the advantages which Kinghorn derives from its local fitu- 
ation. 

Landholders^ Rent and Livi/ton of Land. — The number o^ 
landed proprietors in this parifti is 13 ; but by far the greater 
part of them do not refide in it. There is no map of the pa- 
rifh ; by confeqiience, the number of acres which it contains 
cannot be exaftly afcertained. But they amount to nearly 
305c arable, and 340 inarable. The greateft part of the lat- 
ter is hill-ground, either covered with furze, or planted with 
trees. Of the former, there are, at an average, 170 acres an- 
nually employed in raifing wheat, 397 in barley, 212 in peafe 
and beans, which are commonly fown in drills ; 749 in oats, 
148 in potatoes, 110 in turnip, 328 in hay, 836 in paflure, 
and 100 lying in fummer fallow. The quantity of flax fown

pofed to thefe temptations. Not but that there are many 
here, as fober, as induftrious, and as refpedtable in their fe- 
veral ftations as in any other place. Even where the plague 
rages with the greateft virulence, there are always fome that 
cfcape the fatal infeftion. And here we muft do juftice to a 
clafs of men, whom we have frequently had occafion to hea** 
reprefented as drunken, rude, and infolent to a proverb ; we 
mean the boatmen. That fome fuch there are, we readily 
admit ; but at the fame time we will venture to affirm, that 
there is not in the ifland, nor perhaps in Europe, a public 
ferry, where the watermen are, in general, more aftive, more 
civil, and more obliging. If ^o the rough and infolent, they 
fometimes behave with rudenefs, the fault, furely, is not en- 
tirely theirs. To their Ikill and adlivity, and even general 
fobriety, it may, in fome meafure, be attributed, that there is 
not an inftance of fo much as one of thefe boats having been 
loft, within the memory of man, or even upon record. With 
refped to the inhabitants of the country parifh, who are moft- 
ly employed in the cultivation of land, we may obferve, that 
they are, in general, a fober, induftrious, and charitable peo-

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1012390">CROMARTY</name>. 



(County of Cromartt, Synod of Ross, Presbytery of 

Chanonrt.) 

By the Rev. Mr. Robert Smith.</head>

Name, Extent, Surface^ Soil, i^c. 

THE want of accefs to any particular record, makes it dif- 
ficult to trace, with accuracy, the etymology of the 
name Cromarty : it is generally allowed to be Gaelic, denotr 
ing " crooked bay and as this interpretation feems natural, 
it may be concluded a pretty juft one. The Gaelic name of 
the place is Crom Ba, or " crooked bay the defcription of 
the bay, on which the town is fituated, having a noble wind- 
ing curve, evidently favours this etymology of the name. 
The extent of this parilh is from 7 to 8 miles in length, and 
from I to^4 in breadth. It is bounded by the bay of Cro- 
marty on the N. ; by the Murray Frith, and the parilh of 
Roffmarkie on the E. and S. The town of Cromarty is built 

on 



Statift 'ical Account 

on a neck or point of land, which (Iretches out on a level with 
the fea, there being a finnilar point on the oppofite ftiore ex- 
tending, in like manner, into ^he fea, as if to meet it. There are 
alfo two points of exaftly the fame defcription, a fhdrtway up 
the bay, which, together, occafion the curvature in theappear- 
ance of the bay mentioned above. Along the N. fide of the pa- 
rifli, and immediately above the town, there is a beautiful ver, 
dantbank, extending from theeaftern to the we It em extremity of 
the pariQi ; the bulk of the arable land hangs over this bank, 
in a floping manner, and prefents one uninterrupted co|rn- 
field, without any eminence to intercept the view. To a 
traveller riding through the parifli, by the public road to In- 
vernefs, the arable land lies concealed, and the appearance of 
the country is flat and moorifli. The town of Cromarty was 
formerly a royal burgh, but was disfranchifed by an ad of 
die Privy Council of Scotland, in confe^uence of an applica- 
tion from Sir John Urquhart, proprietor of the eftate of Cro- 
roarty, to that purpofe. The foil about the town is fertile, of 
a deep black mould ; it is, in general, however, remarkably 
wet, owing to a hard pan, or rocky fubftance in the bottom, 
•which prevents the water from finking beneath the furface^ 
The foil in the country part of the pariih is various ; it is al- 
fo,'in general, wet, and the labour of the hufbandman often mucl\ 
retarded, by confequence, in the fpring feafon. 

Natural Curiqfities. — Of thefe, this parilh is not very pro- 
duftive ; it would, however, be a defeft in this account, were 
no mention made of a large rock, confiderable in height, 
which is termed " M'Farquhar's Bed." What renders this 
rock remarkable, is the grandeur of an arch, which forms a 
natural bridge under the rock, admitting the waves of the fea 
to pafs out and in with a tremendous appearance. A ftill 
more remarkable curiofity than the former, is a cove or ca- 
vern 



Of Cromarty, 247 

vern, formed in a rock clofe by the fea, having an entrancft 
fufficiently large to admit an ordinary fized man. From the 
rool and fides of this cavern, there is a continual dropping of 
water, fomeof which falls to the bottom of the cave, but by far 
the greater quantity is quickly petrified into a white hard fub- 
ilance, with which the roof and fides of the cavern are co- 
vered, and make a beautiful appearance. This cavern is ^uite 
aceeffible, and is truly a curious phenomenon. 

Climate, and Difeafes.—Thc climate is generally more mild 
in the town and its vicinity, than above the bank and in the 
country. FroU is frequently intenfe a mile or 2 from the 
town, when it is little felt immediately around it. The cold 
is moft piercing in this place, when the wind blows frbm the 
E., which rulhes in as if by a funnel. There are no dif- 
eafes peculiarly prevalent among the inhabitants. The poor- 
er clafs have been much dii^refled at aU times for want of 
fuel, fcarce having bad accefs to any other, than the fcantr 
fupply furnilhed from the thinnings of the fir plantations in 
the neighbourhood of the town. It is to be hoped, that the 
tax on coals now to be taken 0% will put that comfortable 
fuel more within the reach of aU ranks; it is beyond a doubt ' 
that many of the difeafes incident to the lower ranks, were 
occafioned by the fcarcity and high price of proper fuel. The 
inhabitants are, in general, healthy, and many inftances of 
their hving to the age of 80 years, or thereby, might be ad- 
tiuced ; an mftance or fwo there have been of th« age of go 
The fmaU-pox raged, in this place, to a great degree, during 
hefirft 3 months of .79., and proved very mortal; when 
the mfeaion was caught, in the natural way, upward, of 50 
children, during the above period, fell a facrifice to them. 
I IS, with pleafurc, however, to be obferved, that the peo- 
pie were never more reconciled to the falutary mean of ino-

culation, than at the above period. Of thofe who took th^ 
difeafe by the latter, there were a only died, and thefe, by 
the phyfician's account, had other diforders which bore heavy 
upon them. 

Sea-Coajl, &amp;c.— Thete is a confiderable extent of fea-coaft 
on the N. and S. E. fides of the parifh, not far fhort of 9 
miles ; that on the N. is flat, and after paffing the Sutor Bay 
about half a mile, there is fcarce a rock to be met with on 
either fide of the bay. The coaft upon the S. and S. E. is 
high, being lined all along with a contmued rock, elevated in 
fome places, upwards of 250 feet above the level of the fea. 
There are feveral fifli-boats belonging to the place ; and though 
this be one of the nobleft fifhing ftations, that can be, yet, of 
late years, from the fmall fize of boats made ufe of, and the 
extreme timidity of the fiftiers, this ufeful article of life has 
been much lefs plentiful than was formerly known m this 
place What feems to have introduced the uf« of fuch fmall 
boats' was, that tiU within thefe lad 16 or ao years, fifh was 
got in abundance within the bay, which is not now the cafe ; 
they now beffin to fee the neceflity of large boats, and by go- 
in/out fome confiderable diftance down the Murray Fnth, 
m are caught in greater abundance, fuch as cod haddocks, 
whitings, flounders, Ikait, turbot very rarely, and fole 5 her- 
xin.5have been caught in great abundance- m the bay, but 
not for feveral years paft. The price of fifh has rifen more,

Cturfe of the tide, and ^ea-fFf^i. -There is a very ftrong 
tide flows in and out between the Sutors ; and it is remark- 
able, that the fea has made confiderable encroachments ou 
the E. end of the town, and falls in on the W. There is 
tradition among the inhabitants, that the ground on which 
the old town of Cromarty flood, being towards the E., is 
now wholly under water, and there are ftrong prefumptions 
to favour the tradition in part. It is well known, that what 
was formerly called the weftern extremity of the town, is 
now the eaftern j neither are there any. houfes to the E. of 
the old crofs of Cromarty, which is generally fuppofed to 
have been placed about the centre of the old town. But 
what tends to confirm this tradition moft of all, is, that many 
of the inhabitants now living have fecn feveral fmall tracks 
of garden ground, which are now either cut away, or cover- 
ed by the fea. A ftorn^ from E. covers the fhore of this 
place with great quantities of fea- ware, which proves excel- 
lent manure of itfelf, and anfwers well as a mixture in the 
dunghil. The quantity of kelp made on the fliore, does not 
exceed 10 tons annually, 

Sutors Bay and Harhour — The Sutors of Cromarty, fo 
generally known, are two promontories jutting out into the 
Vol. XII. I i fea, 

and whitings are found good at s.11 feafons. All the kinds of iifli, except her- 
rings, are generally taken by bait. Cromarty finds market for the greater pro-% 
portion of fifli caught by our fifliers. It frequently happens that feveral of the 
bpats go up to Dingwall, where the bay terminates, and there find a ready- 
market for all their cargoes. It may not be improper to obferve here, that this 
place labours under a great difadvantage, from the want of a weekly meat- 
market, which proves very inconvenient for fmall families. Beef is fold, wlicn 
cheapeft, at 2^d. the pound ; it advances in the* fpring feafon to 3*d. and 4d. 
Mutton much about the fame price ; pork fomewhat lower. A good fowl is 
never below 6d. Butcher meat of all kinds is generally very ill to be had durr 
\ng the fpring feafon, and until the latter end of July.

fea, confiderably elevated above its level \ the one on the N. 
fide of the entrance to the bay, and in the county of Rofs, 
the other on the S. fide in the county and parifti of Gromxrty.. 
The body of water between the Sutors, is about a mile and a 
half in breadth, and forms thp grand entrance to the bay of 
Cromarty*. .There is the finefl: anchorage ground that can 
he (after paffing the Sutors) for fev:;ral miles up the bay. 
There is a vail depth of v/ater, on both fides, almoft clofc to 
the ftiore ; and fuch Withal is the favourable and fmooth ftate 
of the fiiore, on jjoth fides, that were a vefiei driven from 
her cables, and caft afiiore, there would be little or no da- 
mage incurred ; fuch infiances feldom happen, and without 
any material injury to the veffcl. Such is the vaft extent of 
fea-room in thig bay, and fuch the capacious defcription of 
its length, depth, and breadth, that almoft the whole Britifii 
Navy might, with the greateft fafet}'-, ride within the view 
of this place. Accordingly, it is remarkable, that in a'l vio- 
lent eafterly ftorms, when no veflel can venture to look into 
any port of the E. coaft of Scotland from the Frith of Forth 
northwards, all yeflels, thus fituated, flock into this bay as a 
place of fafety. Upwards of 30 veiTels, at a time, have re- 
peatedly been driven up here, and found flielter from the 
Itorm. There was a moft commodious quay built he'-e, in

whimfical produaion, written by Sir Thomas Urquhart of Cromarty, it is af- 
ferted, I kiiow not upon what authority, that thefe promontories were named 
by the Greeks e^Trifi-,, av.d that, from this they retain the name Sutors. Other 
derivations might be fought out, but fo fanciful as fcarce to merit notice, as in. 
deed there is great fcope for imagination on fuch fubjefts. Sir Thomas Ur- 
cjuhart'-s account of ;he matter, fo far accords with- the defcription of the bay 
of Cromarty, that when a veffcl, of whatever fizc or burden, and in the mcll 
boifterous ftorm ^hat blows, gets once fairly witlun the Sutors, there is no 
fafer riding in the world. Other cauf?5, however, confpirc to entitle this bny

partly that of Mr. George Rofs late proprietor of the eftate 
of Cromarty ; it receives veffels of 350 tons burden, and fur, 
nifties a fraooth landing place fdr the ferry-boat, in the moft 
boifterous weather. The prefent proprietor of the lands of 
Cromarty, in concurrence with the other truftees who are 
appointed, by ad of parliament, to attend to the fupport of 
the quay, have it in contemplation, to build a pier upon the 
oppofite fliore, in order to procure a fmooth landing to the 
ferry-boat upon the Rofs-fliire fide. Such a fcheme^ when 
carried into execution, will be greatly in favour of this 
place, infomuch, that fcarce any vi^eather will prevent the 
courfe of the ferry-boat, between the two counties of Rofs 
and Cromarty. The fafety of this ferry may be judged oU 
when no accident has been known to hare happened upon it 
in the memory of man. 

Populatiafty &amp;c. — According to Dt. Webfter's report, the 
population in 1755^ was 2096. The prefent incumbent finiih- 
ed a furvtfy of the population of the pariOi on the lil day of 
April 1790^ fincc which time no alteration aS to nunlber has? 
taken place. The number of fouls in the country part of 
the parilii, amounts to 727,- and in the town, to 1457^ mak- 
ing in all 2184. T'here was a lift of the inhabitants in the: 
country, taken by the former incumbent in the year 1785^ 
from which it appears, that there is a decreafe of about 40 
fince that period ; this, probably^ has been occafioned by fe- 
veral fmall farms being joined into larger,- thottgh, upon the 
whole, no great change, of this nature^ has taken place in 
this pariflx ; another caufey is the emigration of labourers to' 
fhe fouth country, foriie of W^hom do not again return. The 
inhabitants of the town have, without doubt, increafed con-( 
fiderably withia thefe laft 18 years, which has been occafion-

arable ; 1832 acres, i rood, 7 falls, in plantation; 2871 acres, 
' a roods, 29 falls, in pafture and moor. Here it will be pro- 
per to obferve, that few pariflies can boaft of larger fums 
•having been laid out in improvements of all kinds, than were 
applied, to this purpofe, bj the late proprietor of the eftate 
of Cromartj, whofe memory fhould ever be held in eftima- 
tion, bj the inhabitants of this place, for the many public 
fpiritcd, as well as difinterefted fchemes he proje£ted for pro- 
moting the welfare of the place, and rendering its many lo- 
cal advantages produftive of the moft extenfive ufefulnefs ; 
and, while he lived, no perfonal expenfe was thought too 
great by him, which might be fubfervient to carry fuch plans 
into execution. Upwards of 50,000 1. was laid out by him, 
in enclofures, the cultivation of a vaft extent of moor ground, 
and other improvements ; good crops are now raifed, where 
many of the inhabitants have feen nothing but bare moor. 
A confiderable proportion of the above fum was applied to- 
wards beautifying, and enlarging the pleafure-grounds around 
the houfe and hill of Cromarty. The latter is covered with firs 
and foreft trees of all kinds, and beautifully interfperfed with 
delightful walks ; the grandeur of the profpea from many 
parts of this hill, or fouth Sutor, is beyond defcription, being 
enriched, on one fide, with an extenfive view of the Murray 
Frith, the whole coaft, with which it is lined ; and, on the 
other, it takes in all the principal gentlemen's feats in the 
counties of Rofs and Cromarty, including the bay, which 
completes the richnefs of the fcene, and conftitutes. Upon the 
whole, the tnoft beautiful variety of land and water that is to 
be met with in Britain. Travellers of the firft rank and

admiration, as exceeding any thing tliey had ever fcen. for 
grandeur and extent of profpe£t *. 

Language, Marnier s, Sec — The language of all born and 
bred in this pariQi, approaches to the broad Scotch, difFwing, 
however, from the dialecls fpoken in Aberdeen and Murray- 
fhire ; this being one of the three parifhes in the counties of 
Rofs and Cromarty, in which, till of late years, the Gaelic 
language, which is the univerfal language in the adjacent! 
parifhes, was fcarce ever fpoken. There has been a confi- 
derable change, of late years, in this refpeft, among the in- 
habitants here ; the Gaelic having become rather more pre- 
valent than ufualf . There is a very genteel fociety, in this 
place, compofed of feveral refpedable and good families, re- 
markable for fobriety, for decency and propriety of conduft, 
in every refpedt. There are alfo in the country part of the 
parifh, and among the farmers, feveral judicious heads of 

families 

* The crops raifed in the parlfli, are, oats, barley, peafe, very little wheat, 
potatoes. Oats are generally fown in the end of March and beginning of April ; 
potatoes and peafe in the month of April, and barley in the month of May. 
Sarley harveff begins, in general, about the middle of Auguft, other crops are 
reaped in September- The parilh finds confumption for the greater p?rt of the 
vicflual raifed among us. Some indeed is exported to the neighbouring counties, 
but in no great quantities. 

f This change has been partly occafioned by the great number of labourers 
from other quarters of the country, employed in carrying on Mr. Rofs's im- 
provements ; many of whom took up their refidence in the place ; the number 
of fuch labourers may be judged of, from this circumftance, that in one year, 
there was known to be no lefs a fum than loool. diftributed among them at 6d. 
a-day. What makes the Gaelic language now have any footing, is the efta- 
blifliment of the manufadure, which has collecfled many inhabitants to the 
place, who never knew any other than the Gaelic tongue. It is to be obferved, 
in general, that the Gaelic is wholly confined to thofe who have fettled here 
from the neighbouring parifhes. It is worthy of notice, that there is a pecuiias

families wbo conduft tlicmfelves, through life, in an honeft 
':uid induftrious manner, and poffefs a degree of civilitj and 
difcretion, not alwftys to b6 met with among people of their 
ftation. A regard to religion, and the duties of public wor- 
lhip form a leading part of the charafter of all ranks in this 
parilh, and among many, the duties of morality are happily 
conjoined to give Gonfiftency and beauty to their religious pro- 
^effion *. 

Reiit^ Proprietors, &amp;c.— The valued rent of the parifli is 
2579!. 173. 2d. Scots. The grofs rent in viftual and monej 
will be little ftiort of 1600 1. It is here worthy of notice, 
that there has been no rife of rent, in this parifli, except about 
the town, for a long courfe of years ; and the tenants have 
an advantage, not now very general, by having a third part 
of their rent converted at 10 s. the boll ; the confequence of 
which is, that thofe of them who are fober, keep decent fa- 
jniliesj and live comfortably. The lands about the town are 
let at 2 1. the acre^ and are all enclofed. Scarcely any of the 
countiy farms are enclofed ; they are let, at an average, from 
12 s. to i^s. the acre. In the year 1763, the property of

* TIi« principal exception to this latter obfervation, is a habit of drunken- 
nefs which has long been prevalent among the lower claffes in this place. The 
late proprietor, faw the fad confequences, with which the intemperate ufe of 
fpirilous liquors was daily attended in the above clafs of people, and to check 
the evil, as far as in him lay, did eredt a very extenfive brewery in the place 
to furnilli the inhabitants, at an eafy rate, with a wholefomer and lefs noxious 
liquor ; but the cheapnefs of fpirits has totally aboliflied the ufe of beer a- 
mong the lower ranks ; fcarce a gallon of the latter is drunk among them in 
the week, while too many have run into the exceflive and pernicious ufe of the 
former. It is to be hoped, however, that the late wife commutation, which 
transfers the tax from coals to fpiritous liquors, will fuperfede the neceflity in 
the people, of having recourfe fo much to what heated them internally, by af- 
fording them more eafy accefs to comfortable heat of an external nature. 



Statljlical Account 



this parifli was divided among 18 or 20 different proprietors. 
The principal heritor, at that time, was Captain John Ur- 
quhart, who was a branch of the old family of the Urquharta 
of Cromarty ; a lineal defcent of which, from Adam, has 
been whimfically attempted, by Sir I homaa Urquhart, who 
reprefentcd the family of Urquhart about the middle of the 
17th century *. There are now but 8 proprietors in the pa- 
rifti, except the Lairds of Cromarty and Udal, the property 
of all the reft put together is but trifling. The former, re- 
fides conftantly in England, the latter, lires upon his proper- 
ty. It is worthy of remark, that the eftate of Udal has been 
in pofleffion of the fame family for a period of 20c years. 
The prefent proprietor, Mr. Anderfon, has planted a confi- 
derable extent of it with firs and foreft trees^ which come Qx; 
very well. 

Ecclejiqflical State, Stipend^ Poor. — There are two clergy- 
men in the parifli ; the parifli minifter, and the minifter of 
the Gaelic Chapel. There was no Gaelic preached in thi* 
pl.ice, until the eredlion of the chapel ; and the principal rea- 
fon of introducing it was, for the accommodation of Mr, 
Rofs's numerous labourers, and others who came from the 

neighbouring 

* The property of this family was once very extenfive in the county of Cro, 
marty, and comprehended much more than what is now called the eftate of 
Cromarty. Sir John Urquhart, who died about the year 1659, left his affairs 
in great diforder, which obliged his fon Jonathan to bring the eftate to fale 
The purchafer was George M'Kenzie, Vifcount of Tarbat, afterward Earl of 
Cromarty, being the firft who bore that title. The Earl of Cromarty gave the 
eftate to his 2d fon Sir Kenneth M'Kenzie. Sir Kenneth was fucceeded by his 
fon Sir George, and ftiortly before his tieath, the eftate was brought to a judicial 
fale, and purchafed by the above mentioned Captain Urquhart of Craigfton. 
By him it was fold to Mr. William Pultney, who made fale of it to Mr. George 
Rofs, the late proprietor, and whufe nephew, Mr. Alexander Rofs, is now pro- 
prietor of moft of the lands in the parilh.

aelgllbouriiig parilhes to the manufaaure of hemp. Accord- 
ingly, the place of worHiip was built folely at the expenfe of 
Mr. George Rofs, in the year 1783 ; and he obtained a grant 
from the Exchequer of 50 1., paid annually from the bifhop 
rents, as a living to the Gaelic minifler. The manfe under- 
went a partial repair, at the admiffion of the prefent incum- 
bent,, and is a good fubftantial houfe. The church was roof- 
ed anew, in the late incumbent's time ; the old vooii at that 
time, taken off, was all of oak, faid to have been cut down

The living was augmented by the Court of Teinds, durmg-

ders of viftual, and 38I. 8s. Sterling of money. The glebe 
may ba valued at 12I. a-year. The Crown is patron both of 
the parifti church and the Gaelic. — The number of poor, up- 
on the town's roll, amounts to 77, and upon the country's, 
to 33^ making in all 110. The funds, for their relief, are as 
follow : In meal there are 9 bolls, 61 pecks, payable from 
mortified lands left for the behoof of the poor 138 years ago, 
by one M'Culloch of Good-tree. Along with this, there is 
the annual intereft of 11 \. Sterling, of a fund ; five guineas 
given annually,, for a courfe of years back, by a Lady for- 
merly conne£^ed with this place, and about 4 1. Sterling an- 
nuall}', of feat rents. The weekly contributions,- at both- 
congregations, have confiderably increafed within the two laft 
years, and may be eftimated annually, between 30 1. and 40 1. 
Sterling ; fo that between meal and money, there will be a 
fum amounting to 60 1. Sterling annually, for the above num-

lefted in one day's time, in this fmall place, for the relief of 
the deftitute. Several of the tenants ftill fpeak of their feel- 
ing the hard efFefts of that and the preceding year. 

ManufuBure. — The Cromarty hempen cloth manufafture 
Was ercfted in 1773 ^7 the late proprietor, and feveral other 
country gentlemen, and is now carried on by a company of 
merchants in London. The fabricks, which are chiefly de- 
figned for cotton and coal bagging, are, in general, for export- 
ationj and very little made ufe of in Scotland. The build- 
ings for this bufinefs are brge and extenfive beyond any for 
the fame purpofe in Britain. Within the walls, there are a- 
bout 200 people employed, men, women, and children ; a- 
mong whom there is a weekly circulation (exclulive of over- 
feer's wages, and incidental expenfes) of about 37 1. Sterling ; 
to thofe who fpin in their own houfes in toxrn and parilli, 
there is a weekly circulation of 4 1. To thofe who fpin in 
the adjacent parifties, there is a weekly circulation of 9 1. 
Sterling, making in all the fum of 30 1. Sterling, circulated 
weekly over the country from this manufafture, or 2600 1. 
Sterling annually. 

Antiquities. — Among thefe is to be mentioned, the old 
caftle ot Cromarty, which flood hard by where the prefent 
houfe is built, but came nearer to the flope of the bank: it 
was pulled down by the late proprietor, in the year 1772; 
and feveral urns were (Jug of the ba;iik, immediately a- 
roupd the caftle, compofed of earthen ware; there were alfo 
feveral coffins of flone. The urns were placed in flags of ftonej 
which formed a fquare around them, and a flag covered them ; 
when the labourers touched thefe urns, they immediately 
mouldered away, nor was it polTible to get up one of them 
entire : they contained the remains of dead bodies, which 

feemed

feemed to have been burnt almoft to aflies, before they were 
put into the urns ; fome fn^all parts of the bones, which were 
not reduced to a&amp;es, had the appearance of having been burnt, 
by which means they were preferred from mouldering. The 
coffins of ftone contained Ikeletons, fome of which wanted 
the head : Others having it, were of a very uncommon fize, 
meafuring 7 feet in length.. On a bank, to the E. of Cro- 
marty Houfe, there ftand the remains of a place of worQup, 
called St. Regulus's Chapel, probably it was the family cha- 
pel of the Urquharts. From an ancient record, the fubjoined 
account of Sc. Regulus is taken*. 

About 3 miles to the S. of this place, there is a very dif- 
tlnd appearance of a camp in the figure of an oblong fquare, 
fuppoled to have been a Danilh camp. At one corner of it, 
there is the appearance of a number of graves, which makes 
it probable that many mufl have fallen in fome attack upon 
it. It is generally conjeftured that the Danes were wont to 
land at this place, and that the inhabitants of the country met 
them in a large moor, called Mullbuy, where they often 
fought, as graves are to be traced diftindly, for feveral miles,

' " It is reported, that one Regulus, a Grecian, having, in purfuance of or- 
^lers given him in a vifion, put out to fea in company with fome of liis colleagues, 
carrying th^ arm-bone, 3 fingers, and 3 toes of the Apoftle St. Andrew in a lit- 
tle box ; and after they had long fuffered under horrid ftorms of ill-weather, 
eing caft into that part of Fife, now called St. Andrew's, without any thing 
faved but the relicks, Herguftus, king of the PicSs, entertained them nobly, and 
at their defire, eredled a church, which, to this day, bears the name of St. Rule, 
from Regulus ; upon whom that prince befto%ved his own palace, with lands 
adjacent. This is faid to have happened about the 7th century." Buchanan 
alfo fpeaks of the fame St. Regulus, under the article Fanum Regidi of the No- 
■nenclatura Latino Vernaculo, It is not improbable that fome of his canons 
regular were placed in the chapel here, as they had been in the cathedra] of St. 
Andrew's. There are the remains of another chapel in the country part of the 
purifli.

there is a v^ry large colleftion of round (tones, and hard by 
it a Imaller pne ; fome of tlie ftones of a great fize, which miili 
have coft great labour in gathering it : Ic is beyond a doubt, 
tliat thefe ftoties were colledlfd by the people, after battles 
fought in the moor, in order to cover the graves of their he- 
roes and chief captains, and to ftand as monumer)t5 upon the 
ground where they lay: what feives to confirm this account 
is, that ftone-coffius have been feund on the fpot, containing 
the bones of fuch heroes *. 

Mifcellaneous Ohfervations. — There is a confiderable alte- 
ration in the drefs of the people of late years. Englifli cloths, 
and thofe of Scotch nianufr;£lure are now much worn by all 
ranks, and printed cottons have becon\e a very general drefs 
among houfe-raaids and others, who were wont to be clothed 
with coarfe woollen fluffs of home manufafture. The trade 
pf this place has hitherto been but very infignificant, notwith- 
ftiindifig of its many and fuperior local advantages. All the 
veiTels trading fiom London, Leith, and Aberdeen, to the 
northern counties, generally land at this place firfl, and take 
their departure from it to thtfe different quarters. The quan-

leaving it to the reaciRr tq give it what credit he may think tit. Speaking in 
his genealogical table of Aftioremon one of the forefathers of the Urquhart fa- 
mily, and whom he makes grantlfon of Alcibiades the Athenian ; he goes on to 
obfcrve, " That in the year before Chrift 361, this Aftioremon, by killing the 
ontlandifli king Ethus, lirft king.of the Picfls, in a duel, before the face of both 
armies, gained the great battle of Farnua, four \-\t within a mile of Cromarty :

his whole army being, to tlils day, confpicuous to all that pafs by." Thus far 
Sir Thomas. XYhatever be in this account, t!)e farm town which, according to 
him, gave name to the battle, is ftill called Farnafs, and is within a few gun- 
fliots of where the encampment was.

tky of goods landed for this place, is proportionally fmall j 
but there is a great increafe in the quantity fent to other quar- 
ters around, of late years. The London traders slone annual- 
ly carry to the four northern counties, value to the amount of 
at lead 100,000 1.- Sterling *.

* There is a cudom-Iioufe boat fetioned here, having a mafter and fix men 
«nder his command; from all I can learn, fmuggling in thefe quarters is knock- 
ed in the head. It would-be wrong to omit mentioning here, a grievance much 
and juftly complained of; 'it isfhortly this: That the officers of thecuftoms here 
are imtrucfled from the cultcm-houie, to flop all boats freighted with vidlual, 
however fmall the quantity, unlefs a regul-ar clearance or permit for fuch boat 
is fent for and obtained from the cuftom-houfe at Invernefs. From this prac- 
tice, any of the inhabitants of this country who may have occafion to fend but 12 
bolls of barley acrofs the Frith, up to Invernefs, or any of the neighbouring 
creeks, are under the unaccountable haidlhip of detaining their boat ur.til the 
return of an cxprefs from Invernefs, which lies 30 miles diitance from many 
quarters of the country; and even from this place; the expenfe incurred by fuch 
a procedure, including the officer's fees, which amount to lis. or 12s., and 
paying the exprefs, will be nothing fliort of 16 s. or iS s. This is mentioned, 
that the grievance, if not fandlioned by law, as is ftrongly fufpedled, may be 
■checked, and a frop put to any longer continuance of it.

UNITED PARISHES of <name ref="NA">KILMUIR WESTER

AND SUDDY.</name>  

(County and Synod of Ross, Presybtery of Chanonrt.) 
By the Rev. Mr. Roderick M'Kenzie.</head> 



<p>Name, Extent, Climate^ Soil, bV, 

"T^ ILMUIR is a Gaelic name, fignifying " achurch dedlcatett 
•"•^ to Mary:" it has Wefter affixed to it, to diftinguiili it 
from a parifli of the name of Kilmuir, fituated in Eafter Rofs» 
•within 6 miles of Tain, which is near the extremity of this 
county. Suddy is a Gaelic name aifo, that lignifies " a good 
*' place to fettle in," both from its fertility and local fituation. 
The kirk and manfe of Kilmuir were built on the S. fide of 
this parlfii, clofe by that branch of the Murray Frith, leading 
towards Beauly, commanding a view of the town of Invernefs, 
the place of CuUoden, Fort George, and all the way along 
'tiiat coaft to the town of Forres ; and for a beautiful fitua- 
tion

tion was inferior to no place in this country. The kirk and 
manfe of Suddy were built to the N. fide of the parlfti, in the 
heart of a rich and fertile country *. This parilh, which 
now goes commonly by the name of Knockbain, (from the 
kirk and manfe being built on a fpot of ground of that name), 
is rather irregular in its form, being divided by a branch of 
the Murray Frith that goes toward Beauly, called the Bay 
of Munlochy. It is alfo covered on the N. and N. W. by a 
part of the parilh of Killearnan, for at lead 2 Englifli miles. 
Its length from E. to W. is fuppofed to be from 5 to 6 miles, 
and from S to N. from 6 to 7. The air is clear and falubri- 
ous, which is in a great meafure owing to the immenfe quan- 
tity of open country and moors, which Hill lie uncultivated 

in 

* Thefe two pariflies, together with the parlfli of Killearnan, were united in 
the year I75), at the joint requeft and application of all tl ? heritors, (except 
Mr. M'Kenzie of Suddy), and of the 3 incumbents, viz. Mr. Donald Frafer of 
Killeama«, Mr. Munro of Suddy, and Mr. Robert Munro of Kilmuir, to the 
Lords of Council and Seffion, as commiffioners for the plantation^ of kirks and va- 
luation of teinds : and upon the death of the minifter of Suddy, which happened 
in 1762, the kirk and manfe of the united parifhes of Kilrauir and Suddy were 
built upon a bleak and barren moor, to the S. fide of Munlochy, called, by way 
of burlefque, Knockbain, where it had a glebe affixed to it of confiderable ex- 
tent, but of little value. This place, no doubt, was chofen for the accommoda- 
tion of the parifliioncrs bring- centrical ; but with little regard to the minifter's 
comfort or advantage. The ftipend of the three parifhes was equally divided 
on the death of Mr. Munro of Suddy, which happened May 1762, between the 
minifter of Killearnan, and the minifter of the united parifhes, and a conHdcr- 
able part of the parilh ef Kilmuir, and a fmall part of the parifli of Suddy, were 
annexed- to the pari^h of Killearnan, and a part of the parilli of Killearnan was 
was disjoined from it, and annexed to the united parifh of Kilmuir and Suddy. 
One thing worthy of remark in this divifion of the parifhes is, that in order to 
make the ftipends equal, there is from one town, Wefter-Ke flock, 8 bolls of fti- 
pend payable to the minifter of Killearnan, although the minifter of the united 
parifn is obliged to perform every part of the paftoral office quoad facra, ani 
the inhabitants of the town acconamodated with room in the church of ths U" 
nited parifh.

large tracks of v;ood to prevent the free circulation of the

but fuch as are peculiar to their neighbours *. The nature 
of the cultivated foil is various ; that along the fea coaft is 
thin and ftony, but, when properly cultivated, yields good 
crops of grafs and corn, efpecially if the fummer months be 
moift and rainy; tliat in the middle of theparifli is deep, rich, 
and having a clay bottom, produces luxuriant crops on fuch 
farms as are kept in a good ftate of culture ; as it extends to- 
ward the IViuUbuy, (a long track of common, extending from 
Cromarty to the public road leading from Beauly to Ding- 
wall, and covering a confiderable part of this parifh to the N.) 
the foil, though good, from its high fituation, is cold ; and 
though it yields tolerable crops of oats and peafe, the barley 
crops are generally poor, owing, in a great meafure, to tha 
wetnefs of the ground, and no drains nor fences being made to 
carry off the hill- waters, or ftielter the fields, excepting on the 
heritor's mains, as alfo, from the people's not giving it a fuf- 
ficient quantity of good and rich manure. This parifh, not- 
withflanding, yields a much greater quantity of grain than is 
fuflicient to fupport the inhabitants ; and from the grain's be- 
ing always early fown, and as early gathered in at harvefl, 
it is found to be of a fuperior quality for the brewer, the dif- 
tiller, and mealmonger, and being in the clofe neighbourhood

Po/,«/^^/o«.— According to Dr. Webfter's report, the po- 
pulation in 1755 was 668. The number of fouls at prefent 
in this parifh is 1805 : of thefe there are above the age of 10 
years 1355, and below 10 years 450 ; of which there are males 
704, females iioi : of the above 7-^4, there are 341 above the

\ There are many more children born in this parifli than the number con- 
tained in this report, fuch as are baptized by the Epifcopal clergymen, and the 
names of thofe children are not cngrofl'ed in the parifli regifter ; and, I fuppole. 
they keep no regifter of their own, fo that the number cannot be afcertained 
with any degree of exaanefs, but may be fuppofed at 10. No account at all 
can be given of the number of deaths in this parifli, as there is no regifter of bu- 
rials kept, befides, that many of the inhabitants bury in the neighbouring church, 
yards, although there be two burial places in this fame parifli, one at Suddy, 
and one at Kilmuir. The people of this parifli, in general, are healthy, though 
not long lived. There, are fewinftances of men's arriving at the age of 80 years; 
and this may be owing to their being inured to hard labour from their youth, 
from their eating little or none of butcher meat, and but very little milk ; the 
principal food of the common people being oatmeal and potatoes, with a little 
fifli in the fifliing feafon. There are a few women now living in this parifli, wh(), 
have attained to the age of 90 years. 



Account 

This ferry is the propertj of Mr. Grr^nt of Redoaftle, wIiq . 
to build * pier and an inn, and ftablea at the ferrj, for the ac 
commodation pf the puMic, which, with proper boats, wi]l 
coft between 700 1. an.d 800 1. Sterling. 

The population of this pariil^ has, of Ij^te years, confider- 
ablj increafcd ; and this is to be chiefly attributed to the en- 
couragement given by the farcily of Kilcqy to metiers and 
cottagers on that eftate. This plan W33 originally adopted by 
Mrs. M'Kenzie Dowager of Kilcoy, during the minority of 
her fon, and carried on with fplrit and fuccefs ; and as there 
is ftill a confiderable quantity of wrafte landi in his property, 
that IS fit for culture, he continues to encourage thefe new 
fettlers upon liberal and advantageous terms both to himfelf 
and them *. 

Renty Herit.ors, l^c — The valued Tent is 3345!. fi s. ?d. 
Scots;, and the real rent, including the heritor's mains, may 
he eftimated at 2600 1. Sterling, feme of which is paid in kind, 
fuch as barley and oat-meal, the reft in money. Indeed,, the 
gentlemen are converting all their rents into, money, rji th^ 
cuftoms, carriages, and feryices being converted fome time 
ago, I think, at the rate of i 1. Sterling for every boll of old 
rent, and now only affefs the tenants with as much victual as 
pays the clergyman's ilipend. There arc 8 heritors in this 
parifli, 5 of whom have their manfion-houfes in it, and re- 
iide in thera, except Colonel Graham of Dryney, who is with 
liis regiment in America, and Mrs. M'Kenzie of Suddy at 

Chatham. 



* There are no Papifts, Seceders, Methodifts, nor any other religious fedl from 
fhe Eftabliflied Church in this parifli, except about 2CO Epifcopalians, who have 
a chapel of their own, and a clergyman to preach to lliem once in ao days. This 
clergyman regularly, adminifleis the iacraments, and marries his own hearers, 
biit never without a line from the felEon-clerk of this, pariflj, certifying the 
parties having been proclaimed, and the dues paid.

Chatham. Two have their familj feats in the parifli of Kii- 
Jearnan, where their projierty is confiderable ; and one, Mr. 
M'Kenzie of Pitlundy, one of tlie IherilF-fubftitates of Ilofs, 
lives on a farm belonging to Mr. Davidfon of Tulloch, clofe 
by the town of Dingwall. Property has been, for feveral, 
years back, rather changeable ; but no proprietor has been 
introduced into the parifli for upwards of 50 years, except 
Mr. Grant of Redca-ftle, and Sir Roderick M'Kenzie of Scat- 
well, who fold his property in this pariih to the Kilcoy fami- 
ly; the reft of t;;e property, to a confiderable quantity of laiW., 
that was fold, being boUght up by the family of Kilcoy, who 
is the largeft proprietor, and principal heritor in this parifh, 
except a fniall property purcbafed of late by Colonel Graham 
of Dryney. 

Language.— TW^ Gaelic is the language commonly fpoken 
here j and though there are a few who have no Gaelic, yet 
moft of the inhabitants fpeak and underftand both languages. 
All the names of the heritors places of refidence in this pa- 
rifh, are derived from the Gaelic : Thus, Allangrange, or,. 
Allan-Chrain, " a fertile field of corn Suddy, or 5k/-«j'-77j«//, 
" a good place to fettle in ;" Belmadathy, or Ball-rria-duich^ 
" a good country town," or B all-ma- duth, a good black 
" to'wn," from: its- being Stuated hard by a black moor. 

Jgric7ttture, &amp;:c.— Agriculture is, as yet, in this parift, 
though a corn countr}',- in a ftate of infaiicy : excepting on the 
proprietor's mains, and i farm, the reft all adhere to the old 
rhode of culture. The heritors, who have all exteniive raains^ 
are improving theni with gifeat judgment and fprrit ; but, be- 
ing all young men, feW or none'of them have had fufficient 
time to complete their pleafure ground, or bring their mains' 
to a proper Hate of cultivation, although they are making:

faft progrefs toward it. From this I muft except Mr. Mac- 
kenzie of AUangrange, who has brought his mains and the 
pleafure-ground of his place, to as high, if not higher perfeftion 
than any man I know in this or the neighbouring counties ; 
he has, for feveral years back, paid the clofeft attention to the 
improvement of his place; and now, while the traveller is de- 
lighted at feeing thofe improvements, he himfelf taftes the 
profits, and enjoys the comforts of them. This gentleman 
has, within mj knowledge, recovered from 70 to 80 acres 
i' om a perfcd morafs, which is now completely drained, fen- 
ced, and yielding ftrong crops of hay and corn, and has there- 
by not only beautified his place, but confiderably added to his 
Tent-roll: for thefe lands, which only paid his father 3I. 6s. 8d. 
he could now fet at from 15 to 20 fhillings the acre ; and he 
Hill continues to go on improving other parts of his eftate 
with great affiduity and attention in the farming, fhepherd, 
and planting way. At the place of AUangrange are to be 
feen feveral beech trees and poplars of a very large fize, as 
alfo yfew trees of an uncommon magnitude, and two filver firs 
that greatly furpafs in height and circumference any of the 
fame kind in this country. The mode of farming is various^ 
according as the tenants choofe ; only thofe upon the eftate of 
AUangrange are reftrifted, I am told, to a certain rotation ; 
but I do not fee that they hold by it, or if they do, I do not 
find that their circumftances are bettered by it. There are 
118 ploughs in this parifli, fome of oxen, fome of horfes, and 
fome a mixture of both; none but the gentlemen ufe 2 horfe- 
ploughs. There is not a farmer in this parifh, independent 
of heritors, who rents 70 acres, except Mr. Munro, faftor to 
-Kilcoj ; he is the only one who has adopted the new mode 
and plan of farming, and manages his farm to great advan- 
tage. Lands in general let at from 12 s. 6 d. to 20 s. the 
acre; and on one eftate, I am told, they let higher. The 

caufes 



Of Kilmuir Wefter and Suddy. 269 



caufes that generally obftrud the improvement of agriculture 
here, in mj opinion, are the poverty of the people, the fmall- 
nefs of the farms, the prejudices of the farmers in behalf of 
old eftabliflied praftices, and the Ihort leafes granted by he- 
ritors ; all thefe co-operate to ftrengthen each other : And al- 
though the heritors improve their own mains with fpuit, and 
are well inclined to give long leafes, yef not one among the 
whole fet of tenantry has followed their example, but Mr. 
Munro, whom have already mentioned, and has his farm 
managed with great regularity and judgment. 

The ftock of this parifli confifts of black cattle, horfes, a 
few llieep and hogs, and, after fupplying the parifli with 
grain, there are large quantities of meal and barley fold to 
fuch as are inclined to purchafe. It is impoflible to afcertain 
the number of acres under crop, as the eflates of the feveral 
heritors have not been regularly furveyed ; and, T am forry 
to fay, that it is my opinion there are ftill in this parifli two 
uncultivated acres for every one that is in culture. But in 
this calculation I include the planted grounds. 

The people follow, in general, the occupation of hufbandry. 
Although there is a fuflicient number of tradefmen of vari- 
ous kinds, yet they hold fome little ground, which they cul- 
tivate. The people, in general, are fober and induflrious ; 
they confine their whole attention to the working of their 
lands and their fmall crofts, and as there is no manufadture of 
any kind eftabliflied in this parifli, both men and women are 
equally dextrous at handling the fpade, the muek-fork and 
fliovel. The chief crops are oats, barley, peafe, potatoes, a 
little wheat, a;id fome ry^ ; there is alfo a confiderable quan-

farmers end the poor people, -which, with tlie l-.erring that fre- 
quent this coaft almoft every autumn, and cor.tiimc till th(! 
fpnng, make a good and wholefonie diet. The herrings art* 
the only fiQi caught in this coaft, except a few faimon caught 
at Stale fi,liing, and fome cuddies, of a very fmall fize, in the 
fummcr months. Thcfe were fo numerous this feafon, as to 
be taken with nets, although the common way of fiAang them 
is vt^ith a hook and bait. I cannot here omit mentioning an 
tmcommon kind of fiili called goblchs, that made its appear- 
ance on this coaft about 3 years ago ; they darted to the Ihorc 
witli the greateft violence, fo tlaat the people took them alive 
in large quantities. The body of this fifh was long, and its 
head refembled that of a ferpent's: its weight never exceeded 
3 or 4 ounces : many of them were found dead on the Ihore. 
The fowing of oats and peafe commences here at February, 
barley and potatoes in April ; fo that the whole crop is fown 
on or before 12th of May. Harveft generally begins along 
the coaft about 12th of Auguft, and is general by the i2th 
of September. 

Stipend, Poor — The kirk was built in 1764, and themanfe 
in 1766; the latter was repaired in 1791 ; and both are now 
in a tolerable ftate of repair. The church holds, for ordinary,, 
from 600 to 700 people. Captain M'Kenzie of Cromurty is 
patron. The ftipend is 9 chalders and i boll of barley, 3 
clialders and 3 bolls oat-meal, and 98 1. 9 s, 8 d. Scotch of mo- 
ney, of which there are 60 1. for communion element^. There 
is, befides, half the glebe of Kilmuir, and a glebe about the 
manfe, of between 30 and 40 acres, which rented at the time 
of the annexation 7i- bolls, but by its being totally neglefted 
fince that time, was of Httle or no value at the acceffion of

as the funds would allow, and, in the end, have them decent- 
ly buried. The Sunday colleftions amount to 61. or 7 1. ; a 
morfcloth, brings in about 30s. ; a fmall mortification of 16 s. 
§d. from the lands of Bellmaduthy, — is all the poor have to 
depend upon : There is alfo a bond of 115I. due to the poor» 
but which, f?om fome untoward circumftances, yielded no re- 
lief to them for feveral years back : however, there is ftill rea- 
fop tp hope, that the principal fum may be recovered. Ma- 
ny of the poor beg from houfe to houfe ^ and it would be 
deemed impious to refufe alms, or a night's quarters to any, 
A great many beggars fwarm ro this parifti from other places, 
particularly from the Highlands, in the months of June, July 
and Auguft. 

Roais, Bridges, Vhiitations. — The roads of this parifh are 
Jcept in excellent repair, as are alfo the bridges : thefe have 
been hitherto done by ftatute-labour ; the people have novsr 
an option of commuting it at 2 s. the plough, or iSd. the 
fnan, or elfe to work at the roads for 6 days. There are 4 
great roads psffing through this parifli, one from Keffock to. 
Tortrofe, Cromarty, Invei%ordon, Alnes and Fowles, for the 
fpace of 6 miles in each direction, and the road from Invernefs 
to Dingwall, at the extremity of Allangrange's property, clofe

leading along the fiiore from Redcaftle, and the Weft High-

lands. There I's no great deal of natural wood in this parifli ; 
that of any extent is upon the tfl;ite of Kilcoy, confining of 
alder, and is kept with great care and attention. There arc 
very large plantations of firs of various kinds, afli, beech, oak 
&amp;c., on the eflatt s of feveral of the heritors ; but the moft 
^extenfive, is that on the eftate of Bellmaduthy, being above 
500 acres, all in a thriving condition, and many of them fit 
for market. By the time all thefe plantations come to per- 
fe61:ion,,or are fit for fale, there will be great abundance of 
wood for fupplying the pariQiioners with timber and fuel, an 
article much wanted here, as the mofles in the parifh are 
quite exhaufted, and the inhabitants will be neceffitated to 
purchafe coals, which, with the high duty, is far beyond the 
reach of the poorer, and middle clafs of people, and which, 
if not fpeedily withdrawn, will oblige the inhabitants to emi- 
grate to 01 her countries, where fire is to be had in greater a- 
bundance. Every poor man's countenance here fparkled with 
joy, at being told of Mr. Secretary Dundas's intention of 
bringing a bill this feffion into Parliament, to take the duty oflf 
coals coming to this country. 

Antiquities. — There are evident marks of a battle's being 
fought in this parilh. It is faid to have been between the peo- 
ple of Inverncfs and the M'Donalds, and to have happened 
in the 13th or 14th century. The plain on which this bat- 
tle was fought, is to this day called Blair-na-coi ; a name 
given it from this particular circumftance, that as one of the 
contending parties was giving way and flying, a tenant and 
his fon who were ploughing on that field, had taken off the 
yokes with which the oxen were faftened together, rallied the 
routed troops, and with them recommenced the aftion and 
earned the day *.

are not only taught, but fupplied with books at Mr. Grant's 
fole expenfe. It is propofed this feafon, to caufe the teacher 
of the Sunday- fchool open a weekly fchool in a remote but 
populous corner of the parifli, fo as to render this inftitution

vaft number of cairns of Hones that are ftiU to be feen there, covering the dead. 
Thefe the people ftill hold -fo-facred, that though the place was in tillage when" 
the battle was fought, the marks of the ridges being ftill vifible there, and 
though a great deal of the adjoining moor is now cultivated, not one of thefe 
cairns has been ever touched. Another circsmftance that ftrengthens this opi- 
nion is, that the heights and adjacent places go by the name of Bruitn-m-dcor 
« the height or the Hill of Tears." To the E.-of where the battle ^vas fouoht' 
are to be feen the remains of a Druidical temple, called James's Temple- and

where there is alfo a pretty large cairn of ftones, called Cairn-glas. This hill' 
v. hich goes by the name of Ord-hill, belongs to Mr. Grant of Redcaftle, who' 
Jias already begun to plant it with firs and other foreft trees, and which, 'when 
-fin.Oied, will be an ornament to this and the neiglilx)uring counries, as it lies 
_i.n the coaft oppofire to Inverneis, and is to be feen as far down as from the 
town of Elgin. I could get no fuch traditional account of this battle, as could 
^duce me to commit any thing more about it to paper. One circumftance wor- 
of remark is. that a very honeft at^d refpedlable family of formers, date

Birds. — There are all forts of common fowls, fuch as heos, 
turkeys, geefe, ducks, 8z.c. reared in this parifli, and it a- 
bounds with fuch other birds as are peculiar to this climate 
and country. The cuckoo makes his appearance at the end 
of April, and the fwallow in the beginning of May. The 
lapwing or green plover in March, and the wood-cock in Oc- 
tober. I here are a few moorfowl, and a black-cock has been 
feen in the fir plantations of Mangrange, frequently this fea- 
fon. The ground abounds with many partridges. Immenfe 
numbers of fea-fowls frequent this fliore, efpecially in the 
fifhing feafon, and the flocks of ducks' of various kinds that 
frequent the bay of Munlochy, are almoft incredible ; for 
they fometimes cover the bay from fide to fide for a miles, 
and it is aftonifliing what it is they get there to fupport them, 
as the herring never enter it. Rude geefe and fwans fome- 
times come there in the winter and fpring, efpecially when 
the froft is intenfe. There are a few finging birds alfo in 
this parifh, fuch as the thrufli, blackbird, linnets, goldfinches 
in great abundance, the bullfinch, which, 1 am told, has made 
his appearance in this country about 20 years ago, and a great 
plenty of laiks. 

MifceUaneous Ohfervations— There is one large cove in 
this parifti, at a place called Craig-a-choiv (a name given it 
for its famous echo) at the entrance of the bay of Munlochy, 
it is very large and reaches far into the rock, fo far indeed 
that the farmers in the neighbourhood were obliged to fliut it 
it up toward the hill with rubbifti ; for, when their (heep and 
goats ftrayed into it, they were never again feen nor heard of. 
The mouth of the cave was made up wiih ftone and lime fe- 
veral years ago, by traders who fecured and fecreted frauggled 
goods in it; but fince that contraband trade has been aboliOi- 



Of Kilmuir Wefter and Buddy » 275 



ed on this coaft, the mafon work is fallen to decay. The cave 
could eafily contain, I am told, a whole {hip's cargo *. 

There is a good deal of fea ware or wreck along the coaft, 
which is feldom converted into kelp. The farmers ufe it for 
barley and potatoes, though a bad manure for the latter, as 
the potatoes are always foft and watery that grow upon it. I 
am told, it is excellent manure for raifing kail. There are S 
mills for grinding com in this parifti ; 2 of thefe are wrought 
by the fait- water. There are but 2 lakes, one of them con- 
fiderably above the level of the fea, is called the loch of Pit- 
lundy. The neighbouring people allege that there have been 
water cows feen in or about this lake ; but it is of too fmall 
an extent to give any fhadow of credibity to fuch an affertion. 
In feveral parts of this parifti, quarries of freeftone have been 
found, and wrought with fuccefs, and all the moors abound 
with plenty of grey ftone fit for building houfes and ftone 
fences. For an half mile to the W. of the village of Mun- 
lochy, which lies at the head of the bay, there are evident 
traces of the fea's having once covered that rich and fertile 
flat, fuch as beds of ftiells, &amp;c. ; but there is none now liv- 
ing who remembers to have feen that ground overflowed by 
the fea at any period. 

'iceSy Wagesy &amp;.c. — Mutton fells from ji-d. and4d. down to 
3d. and 2td. the pound. Beef and pork fell at the fame rate.

* In this cave, there is a fpring of water to which the fuperftitious part of 
the people attribute a medicinal effedl, and ftiU repair to it on the firft Sunday 
of every quarter, for a cure to any malady or difeafe under which they happen 
to labour. The water is (aid to be particularly famous for reltoring the fenfe of 
hearing, by pouring a fe\^ drops of ii into the affeAed ear; but this, in my 
opinion, muft be owing to' the cold and piercing quality of the water forcing 
its way through the obftrudions of the ear. The coldnefs of this water is 
greater than any I ever tafted, and no wonder, for the fun never Ihines upon it, 
and it oozes through a confiderable body of rock.

Hens at 6 d. There is little butter and cheefe fold here. Thefe 
articles are bought at the neighbouring markets at los. 6d. 
the flone of butter, and from 4 s. to 5 s. the ftone of cheefe *. 

Advantages and Difadvafitages.—Owc great advantage which 
this parifh enjoys, arifes from its being in the near neighbour- 
hood of Invernefs, from which it is only divided by a nar- 
row kjle of the fea, over which there is a regular ferry-boat 
renting 128 1. Sterling. There the inhabitants get a ready-mo- 
ney market for any commodity they have to offbr for fale, 
Tind get to purchafe, any article they wifh for, with little trou- 
ble, and as little lofs of time. Another, arifcs from the clofe 
neighbourhood of Fairntofli, from whence there is a conflant 
demand for their barley for making whillcy. Another advan- 
tage is, that there is great plenty of freeftone quarries in the 
parifh, and great abundance of clay for building comfortable 
houfes and fencing their fields. Mr. M'Kenzie of Kilcoy has 
licen making brick of fome of this clay for 2 years paft for 
his own ufe. They have anfwered exceedingly well; and a ma- 
nufafture of this kind could be eftablillied to a large extent 
on his eftate, within a quarter of a mile of the fea. Another 
is, that the inhabitants have water-carriage for any heavy ar- 
ticles they may need, either by Keffock or Munlochy bay. 
And the lad I fhall mention is, that the parilh every where 
abounds with great plenty of frefli vsrater, fufficient not only 
for the ufe of the inhabitants, but for carrying on any manu- 
facture that might be eftabliflied among them, that r-equired 
fuch an aid.

The difadvantages, on the other hand, are many. The great- 
eft, and that which is moft fenfibly felt by the inhabitants, 
arifes from the want of fuel ; the whole moffes in the parifh 
being quite exhaufted, and the people's having recourfe to np- 
thing elfe to make up this want,, but the pmxhafing of a few 
young planted firs which have little laft, and as little warmth 
or heat in them. The 2d, arifes from the want of limeftone 
to help to manure the lands, or any marl, except on the 
eftates of Kilcoy and Bellmaduthy, which, from its fcarcity, 
has been wholly confined to their own mains, and when and 
where applied, has been found to anfwer well. A 3d difad- 
vantage arifes from the want of manufadlures. There are fe- 
veral eligible liations for eftablilhing manufadlures in this pa- 
rifli, efpecially an woollen or linen manufacture which might 
be carried on here to any extent. Indeed there are 2 ftations 
in this parilh fo naturally calculated for fuch a bufinefs, that 
it is rather furpvifing that they Ibould, till now, be quite ne- 
glefted J the one of thefe is at the village of Munlochy, where 
there is plenty of frelb water to work any machinery, a plain 
of a confiderable extent, at leaft 100 acres, through every 
part of which water rnay be carried with the greateft eafe, 
and it is furrounded with a fine green bank facing the S. for 
drying clothes, within lefs than a quarter of a mile of the 
fea, and in the midft of a populous country where the inha- 
bitants are defirous of employment ; and Mr. M'Kenzie of 
Kilcey, the proprietor, I am well perfuaded, would encou- 
rage a company on liberal terms to fet up a manufadure 
there. The other ftation is on the Ihore of Ktffock, oppofite 
to the town of Invernefs, the property of Mr. Grant of Red- 
caftje. Ships of any burden can come quite clofe to that lliorc; 
and Mr. Grant has told me, that he would feu out the ground 
on his property along the fhore, on eafy terms, to fuch tradef- 
mea as would wiflx to fetile there, and give a manufadurer

all due encouragement. This place is alfo furroundedby avaft 
number of people. The laft difadvantage I fhall condefcend 
upon, arifes from the fmallnefb of the farms and ftiortnefs of 
the leafes ; but this I well know is owing to tlie poverty and 
indolence of the prefent inhabitants, and I am well convinced, 
if gentlemen farmers, poflefled of capitals, came to fettle in 
this place, they would meet with all due encouragement, both 
as to leafes and melioration, from the proprietors, who all 
wifb to encourage agriculture ; and I am perfuaded, that fuch 
adventurers would find, upon trial, that it would turn out to 
their own private advantage.

are alfo many names in this paiifh and country. The length 
of the parifh from N. to S. may be about 9 Englifli miles ; 
its breadth from W. to E. variable, but the greateft between 
5 or 6 miles. From fprings in the hills, defcend through the 
fields various rivulets, which empty themfelves into 2 burns, 
namely, the burns of Frendraught and Forgue, the latter of 
which is beautifully edged with natural wood.

of hay. Little wheat is fown in the parifli, not fo much as 
there was about xz years ago, owing to the backward late 
rainy feafons. The fouthern parts of the parifli, which arc 
called Foudland, are moftly in a ftate of nature, and covered 
with luiath. There are a few farms on the extremities of it, 
of a light black foil. In feveral parts of the parifli, hedges 
have been planted with fuccefs. When they receive prope*- 
care and atteation, they thrive amazingly. There is a quarry 
of limeflone at Pitfancy, which affords a confiderable, though 
not a fufficient quantity for the pariftiioners and this neigh- 
bourhood. The furplus grain of this parifh, which is very 
conliderable, is fold to merchants in Portfoy and Banfr, who

ders, a few Roman Catholics, and all the reft of the Ella- 
bliflied Church. Our marriages annually, at an average, a- 
mount to xj ; baptifms to 36 ; and burials to 25 ; excluding 
thofe that are buried at other parifhes ; but, notwithftanding 
that the number of deaths comes greatly fhort of the births j 
yet, on account of the farms becoming larger, the lands be- 
ing thrown into pafture, laid down with grafs-feeds, the great 
advancement on fervants wages, and the increafe of manu- 
fafture* in towns, the inhabitants of the parifh are gradually 
decrealing. 

State of Farming, &amp;c Improvements in farming arc 

making great progrefs. The horfe-hoeing hufbandry has been 
introduced with fuccefs. Cabbages, in the field, have fcarce- 
ly been raifed any where in the parifli except by the mini- 
fter ; they are of the Scotch grey fort, and grow to a great 
lize. They are chiefly applied for feeding the cows, and are 
all horfe-hoed *. Turnip crops have been cultivated for many 
years in the broad caft, and now a great part of tlie crop in 
the drill. The following year, thefe fields fo cultivated are 
laid down with grafs-feeds. The cattle are of the Scotch 
breed ; but are, of late, much improved in fize by the cul- 
ture of green crops. Thefe are confumed in rearing cattle, 
"which is found more profitable to the farmer, than in fatten. 

ing 

* About 20 years ago, cabbages were raifed in the open fiel4s of Cobairdy, 
liy Sir Erneft Gordon, the outer blades of which exceeded 4 feet, and fome- 
times &amp;\ feet dianaeter; thefe cabbages, after being ftripped of their ftem and 
outer blades, generally weighed from 38 lib. to 4S lib. Dutch weight. Alfo, 
in the fame fields, turnip had been often raifed from 16 lib. to 22 lib. Dutch 
weight, including the top, or blades that grow above ground. Wh?.t n pity is 
it that the cultivation of thefe cabbages is now fo much negle?led.

owing to the peculiar nature of the pafture. Some of the

are uncommonly attentive to the breed of horfes. They fell

and oxen from 61. to lol. The farms are of various fizes, 
from 200 acres downwards ; and fome of thefe are almoll 
wholly enclofed, either with ftone fences or hedges ; and fub- 
divided with hedges, The rent varies, according to circum- 
flances, from ll. 10 s. to 2S. 6d. the acre. Many of our 
farm-houfes are neat, commodious, and of the modern caft, 
and covered with llate. The higheft rent in the pari&amp; is 
iiol. Sterling. The valued rent of the parifli is 3936 1. 6 s. 
&amp;d. Scots. The real rent may amount to about 2500I Ster- 
ling. There are 14 proprietors or heritors belonging to the 
parifli ; 4 of them rehde in it, and one of them occafionalJy. 
Moft of them have given evident marks of their tafte for 
plantations and improvements. The face of the country here, 
is variegated and beautiful. The proprietors and their te- 
nants, in general, extremely adive in improving their lands, 
in planting their wafte grounds, and in covering the rugged 
appearance of the barren foil, with various kinds of wood. 

On the property of Mr. Morifon of Bognie, there are 
many thriving plantations of trees and natural wood. Upon 
hills and wafte ground, there are 10 different enclofures, con- 
taining about 300 acres, covered with various kinds of fir, 
and hard wood interfperfed, where the foil admits. Near to

tions, promifes a long continuance of that ufeful article in 
this corner. 

^ There are feveral fpirited, induftrious. judicious, and thriv- 
ing farmers in the pariO.. They have brought their fields 
into high culture, many of them well fenced j beinT encou- 
raged, in various refpecls, by their different proprietors. The 
ieafes are of a peculiar nature, and highly advantageous both 
for the proprietor and tenant ; particularly thofe of Mr. Mo- 
rifon, who has encouraged the tenants on his eftate, to plant 
trees in wafte ground, convenient places in meadows, corners 
of fields, or in hedge rows *. When we confider the utility

* Upon the following conditions, viz. If the field or fpot to be planted con 
{am 4 acres, the proprietor is at one half of the expenfe of enclofing. and puvs 
the other half to the tenant at the iflue of the leafe, if the fence be in repair. 
When the trees grow up^ the farmer is at liberty to weed or cut timber for any 
purpofe about, or neceffary for the farm, ItiU leaving an equal cover on the 
ground. But he is prohibited from felling or difi^ofmg of any trees, until the 
iflue of the leafe, when the proprietor of the land has an option to take the 
whole growing timber on the farm, and to pay the value thereof to .the tenant, 
as it fhall be appreciated by 2 men mutually chofen for that purpofe, or allow' 
the tenant 2 full years to cut down, fell, and difpofe of the whole wood on the 
farm, fo agreed upon. Thefe are the general terms of encouragement for plant- 
ing ; but where the fields or corners to be planted contain more or lefs than 4 
acres ; the conditions vary according to that and other circumftances. The

of plantations of trees in Scotland, not only for fupplying 
the farmers, mechanlcks, and others, with materials in their 
refpeftive callings ; but for warming and improving the cli- 
mate, we muft allow great merit to Mr. Morifon for his 
own exertions, but ftill more on account of encouragement 
given, and example fliown to his tenants. For, I apprehend, 
he ftands among the foremoft country gentlemen of the N., 
'^ho have either given fuch generous terms, or have been at 
fo much pains to induce the tenantry to employ a little fpare 
ground and time to purpofes fo patriotic, as well as ultimate- 
ly beneficial to themfelves and families. An Earl of Moray 
may plant his 3000 acres, and other patriotic noblemen and 
gentlemen may each exert themfelves on their own farms, or 
particular corners of their eftates ; but what are thefe points 
to the whole of the country? A province, a country, a ^7/- 
tria, cannot be properly wooded without the affiftance of the 
farmer. In that cafe, there would be a continuation of wood 
to break the N. E. and other blighting winds which are the 
bane of this country. When I refleft upon this, I think it 
a pity, that Mr. Morifon has not connefted all his diftbrent 
plantations into one continued extent, which would nearly 
reach from one extremity of the parifli to the other, forming 
an irrefiftible barrier againftthofe points of the compafs that 
bring us the worft weather. 

Nor is Mr. Morifon of Bognie. the only gentleman, in this 
very extenfive parifti, who has diftinguifbed himfelf by at 
tempts to improve and beautify the country. Captain Shand 
of lempland, has exhibited a plan of drawing water over 
and raiHng timber on that fmall fpot, which at firft, indeed' 
attraSed fome notice, merely from its novelty and fingula' 
rity^but his plantations having fucceeded beyond what was 
expeded, his fcheme has rather become exemplary at leaft 
I am fare, that all the tenants on the eftates of Bognie, who

have embraced the liberal propofal of their landlord, have 
executed their plantations on the Captain's principles and 
ideas. This officer, after an abfence of 12 or 13 years in the 
feivice of his countrj, returning again to his native foil, in 
the year 1784, and finding his property then a perfea wafte, 
took, up the refolution of encloling it with double ftone fences 
and ditch. After which, it occurred to him, that the interme- 
diate fpace included between the fences, might as well take in 
(if it could be fo contrived) all, or greateft part of the word 
foil ; and thus he at laft conceived the comprehenfive and un- 
common defign of fencing the arable by the barren ground ; 
not doubting, when the latter was filled with all proper kinds 
of young trees, that his beft fields would thereby, in due 
time, be well fecured and protefted from blighting winds and 
f{orms. Every fucceeding year gives frefti teftimony of the 
propriety of the original plan : For it has been executed mi- 
der almoft every difad vantage, particularly his own abfence, 
and the intermediate management of people incapable of en- 
tering fully into his views. The plan for watering the farm 
of Templand, is no lefs worthy of notice, than the planting, 
though the proprietor's abfence, and many other unfavour- 
able circumftances, have united to render the fuccefs lefs. 
However, there is fufficient evidence from the little that has 
been done, that water fediment, and other efFefts arifing from 
flooding, with large ftreams, is probably the very beft m.e- 
thod of meliorating ground, and exterminating the mofl: per- 
nicious vsreeds. It alfo appears from the Captain's experi- 
ments, that water properly conduced through young timbei* 
plantations, is the cheapeft and beft method of encouraging 
their growth. This gentleman's ideas in condufling great 
currents of water for agricultural purpofes, have been ex- 
tended to carry plans of inland navigation into execution,

We muft not pafs by the imprcyements and plantations of 
Captain George Morifon, late of Haddo. Haddo lies on the 
N. W. fide of the burn of Forgi'.e, about an Engliili mile 
below whfsre the church ftands, keeping the courfe of the ri- 
l?ulet. The houfe ilands on a gradual floping bank, a few 
.yards from the burn, built after the modern tafte, and af- 
fords genteel accommodation for a large family. On the 
haugh between the rivulet and water courfe to the mill, lies 
the garden, fenced with a high itone wall, and well ftored 
with a great variety of fruit trees and bufhes. At no great 
jdiftance from the houfe, there are feveral patches of thriving 
plantations of fir, alder, birch, &amp;c. The fields are well cul- 
tivated, and yield good crops. Taking the whole in one 
view, Haddo is one of the mofl; pleafant fituations in this or 
the neighboiiring country, and is juftly admired for its va- 
riegated profpeft, by every perfon of tafte and difcernment. 
Some of the other heritors have begun to plant, enclofe, and

•lieved that the troops of that warlike people, had never pe. 
iietrated, by land, beyond the Grampian mountains. But 
Captain Shand of this parifli, juRly admiring the wife policj 
of the Romans, in their military arrangements, was anxious, 
fonie years ago, to trace the remains of the numerous field 
works, executed by their armies, during their operations m 
North Britain, and from an acqurate iufpedion of them, was 
convinced, that the fortifications on the Barra-hill, and the 
extenfive camp oppofite to Glenmealin, were as much Ro- 
man, as the topographical veftiges he had obferved in Strath- 
more, and other South- Grampian countries*. 

Roads. — The roads are not in very good repair, owing, in 
a great meafure, to the nature of the foil, and the ftatute-la- 
tour being commuted. It would be better to l|vy the mo- 

ney, 

* It is not a little remarkable, that the larger works in this parifli, are at- 
tended the fame as in the fouth country, with fmaller ones, fome round, and 
others of a redbangular figure. The circular redoubt on the S. E. acclivity of 
the feed-hill of Auchaber, about a Ihort mile from the camp, is well preferved, 
and appears to have been an entrenched guard for a fmall number of men, be- 
ing only 20 common paces in diameter, including both the vallum and the 
foody of the place, proceeding from this remarkable fpot, in a nearly N. W. 
diredion, for 5 or 6 miles, by Woodfide in the lands of Frendraught, the Riach- 
hill, the Riach-burn, and Auchingoul, one very frequently meets with remains 
that are not farmers works ; and though tradition, and the prevailing opinion 
jof the country people, place them among military, yet they can fcarcely be 
called fo, on account of being fo much mutilated. But it feems worthy of ob- 
fervation, that if the Statio ad Ithunam, is fituated (as there is great reafon to 
think) at the confluence of the burn of Auld Davie in this parifli, with the 
Ythan, the track juft pointed out, cannot be widely diftant from the great 
-confnlar road, in Ptolemy's Itinerary ; and a learned antiquary, a friend of 
mine, now deceafed, thought he had difcovered the aftual antique caufeway

of the compafs. There are alfo veftiges of feveral Druidical temples in the

oicy, and to employ labourers, under dlreftlon of an attentive 
and'capable overfeer. We have reafon to conclude, that were 
there a bridge thrown ov.er tlje povern, at Marnoch, and an- 
other over the burn at Auchintender, on the great road to 
Aberdeen, through the Garioch, it would contribute much to 
the advantage of this country. 

Mifcellaneons Ohfervations.—Th^ crop in 1782, was re- . 
markably deficient, and the oat-meal very bad ; in fo much, 
that had it not been for the importation, numbers would ha^e 
periled. Some of the heritors commiffioned a cargo of peafe, 
and fold them out at prime coft to the moft neceffitous fami- 
lies. Meffrs. Phyn and Ellis ^ merchants in London, gave 
a liberal gratuity .of barky and peafe, amounting to 800 
bufliels, to be diftributed among the moft diftreffed families \n 
Forcrue and Auchterlefs. It was fuppofed, that the crop did 
Eot yield provifion for the parifliioners, for the half of the 
year 1783. At the defire of the heritors, the feffion lifted 
40 1., and difpofed of it to the fame purpofe, over and above 
their ordinary diftribution. The air is falubrious, the peo- 
ple, in general, healthy, fober, induftrious, charitable, hofpi^

f There is no village in the parifli, and confequently no manufadlure. The 
•women are occupied in fpinning linen yarn, from flax given out by merchants 
in the parifli.  

The ufual fuel in this parilh, is peat and turf, -which is brought from Foud- 
Jand ; but, on account of the great diftance and difficulty of procuring it, many 
of the parifliioners are obliged to bring coals, at a great expenfe, from Banff 
and Portfoy, our neareft fea-port to-wns ; which are difl;ant from the centre of 
the parifli, at leaft, 17 Englifli miles. Which circumftance, wc think, may be 
adduced as an argument for taking off the prefent heavy duty on coal.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7383413">RUTHVEN</name>. 

(CouNTr OF Forfar, Synob of Angus, PRESBmRV 

Meigle.) 

By the Rev. Mr. James Will.</head> 



<p>Situ(ition, Extent, Soil, and Produce. 

'pHE parifli of Ruthven is pleafantlj fituated on the N. 

fide of Strathmote, near the foot of the Grampian 
mountains, Hoping gently towards the S. Nearly of a fquare 
form, It contains about 1700 acres, of which 63 are covered 
with natural oaks, 240 with fir and hard wood, 40 of heath 
to be planted, 30 of marl-mires, and 16 of peat-mofs : The 
reft IS partly arable, and partly to be improved during the 
currency of the prefent leafes. The foil, in general, is a light 
hazel mould, with a gravelly bottom, producing excellent 
gram, but liable to be parched in a dry fummer. The pre- 
fent proprietor has been at great pains to introduce the mo- 
dern improvements in agriculture, which he has accompliOied 



Of Ruihven, 



ih a confiderable degree, by reftriftiag his tenants to a rota- 
tion of cropping the laft time their farms were let. The ro- 
tafcion is as follows : field, ift, grafs; 2d, ditto ; 3d, ditto ; 4th, 
oats; 5th, barley; 6th, oats; 7th, fallow, or green crop; 8th, 
barley with grafs-feeds. The tenants, from the prejudices of 
education, came into thefe improvements rather reludlantly at 
firft. They are now, however, as forward in them as their 
neighbours, and begin to experience the advantages of them. 
They are reftri£l:ed from raifing wheat or flax, in confiderable 
quantities, becaufc thefe have been found to be rather exhauft- 
ing crops for the foil. The parilh, however, was always re- 
markable for producing fine flax, but more fo, it is faid, be- 
fore the introduftion of marl. A greater quantity, indeed, 
might be raifed now than formerly, but, in the opinion of ex- 
perienced farmers, there is no comparifon as to the quality. 
The foil is favourable for turnip and trees of every kind, fuit- 
ed to the climate. The larix, in particulaf, grows with un- 
common quicknefs, fome of them only 15 years bid, having 
meafured 46 inches root girth. Oaks grow naturally ; and 
in a former period fome of them were of great fize, if we may 
judge from two which have remained time immemorial in the 
old courfe of the river Ifla, about a mile below the church. 

Name and Proprietors. — The etymology of the name is 
doubtful *. It was anciently exprefled in the plural, Ruth- 
vens, having been divided into two parts, and belonged to two 
different proprietors : That on the E. fide of the river Ifla was 
termed Earls Ruthven, as having been the property of the 

O o 2 Earl 

* It is pronounced Riven ; and, If a conjcdure might be hazarded in a mat- 
ter of fo much uncertainty, might be fuppofed lo be compounded of the Gaelic 
words roy (red), and vean (white), perhaps from the foil in general abounding 
with fmall white ftones, or rather from the appearance of the rocks, on the 
Ijanks of the river in the N. fide of the ptirifli, which are of a red colour, but in 
inany placcj whitened over with age.

Earl of Crawford, who, at one period, poffefTed a great part 
of the county of Forfar ; the other part was called Ruthvcna 
Davy, as having belonged to the laird of Kippen Davy. A- 
bout 1380, both thefe eftates came into the pofleflion of 
a branch of the family of Crichton, who kept them until 
1742*. After the Frendraught family became extind, and 
the Dumfries family failed in the male line, the head of the 
Ruthven family became chieftain of the ancient and illuftri- 
ous name of Crichton. Upon the death of the late Thomas 
Crichton, Efq. of Millhill, and his brother William, the fa- 
mily of Crichton of Ruthven failed in the male line alfo. The 
remaining part of their eftates, which had been once very ex- 
tenlive in this neighbourhood, was purchafed 50 years ago by 
Thomas Ogilvy, Efq. of Coul, and is now in the poffeffion of 
his fon James Ogilvy, Efq. of Iflabank, who refides in this 
parifh, and has built an excellent modern houfe, near the 
much admired fituation of the caftle of Ruthven, which, be- 
ing ruinous, was pulled down fome years ago.

* The firft of that famliy who held the barony of Ruthven was James, fecond 
fon of Stephen Crichton of Cairns, brother to George Crichton, Earl of Caithuefs, 
and coufin to Sir William Crichtoti of Crichtbn, Lord Chancellor of Scotland. 
In the year 1477, Jaines Crichton of Ruthven was Lord ProvOft of Edinburgh ; 
another of the fame name, who had the honour of knighthood, was mafter of 
horfe to King Charles !!• It is faid, that the haughty dilpofition of Sir James 
prevented him from enjoying long his elevated ftation ; and that his merry mo- 
liarch having, on a particular occafion, made him a prefent of 500-1., with a re^- 
commendation to " creifli his boots" with it, alluding to his country and his 
office, the knight took ofience at the espreffion, returned the money, refigned 
his oflGlce, and retired to Scotland. But, habituated to the extravagance of a 
court he had abandoned, he diflipated his fortune, and gave a blow to the fa- 
mily eftate which it never recovered. There is a fine portrait of Sir James by 
"Vandyke, in the pofleflion of his defcendant, in the female line, John Kinloch 
Sfq; of Kilrie.

this parifii, though fome rifing grounds improperly retain that 
name. Upon one of thefe, called Candle-hill, the place is to 
be fecn where the barons of Ruthven erefted a gibbet in feu- 
dal times. Two of thofe eminences are diftinguilbed by ths 
name of Laws, upon one of which there was a large caira 
fome years ago. The only river in the parifh is the Ida, 
which, after bounding it for upwards of a mile on the N» 
fide, turns fuddenly in the direftion from N. W. to S. E., di- 
viding the parifti into two unequal parts, leaving the largeft 
on the E. fide. The upper part of its courfe is rocky and 
winding, with bold and fteep banks, covered in many places 
with natural woods, and affording fome very romantic fcenery. 
After paffing the Lin, which is a fall over feveral ridges of 
broken rock, the river refolves itfelf into a pool, called the 
Corral, probably a corruption of Quarry-hole, there appear- 
ing to have been a quarry on the E. fide, at fome remote pe- 
riod. This pool is deep and broad, but becomes more flial- 
low toward the S., and ends in the broad ford, famous in the 
annals of black fifliing. Upon leaving the ford, the river di- 
vides itfelf into two branches, forming a fmall ifland, called 
Stanner IHand, containing, about 6 acres : afterward, diverfi- 
fied with rapid ftreams and gentle meanderings, it continues 
to extend through level and fertile fields. In winter, the low 
grounds are greatly injured by the river fliifting its courfe, 
carrying away the rich foil, and depofiting barren fand and 
gravel in its place. It would he greatly to the advantage 
both of proprietors and tenants, that a ftraight channel was 
cut for this river, through its haughs- or low grounds, for 
about 8 miles, from the S. fide of this parifh, where the river 
begins to take a direftion to the weftward, to the bridge of 
Cupar Angus. The river is well flocked with trout and fal- 
mon. In the months of Oftober and November, the latter 
come here to fpawn, at which time great havock is made a-

tnong them by the black- fifliers. The praftice of bkck.filli- 
mg is fo called, becaufe it is performed in tlie night time, or 
becaufe the fini are then black or foul. At this feafon, they 
frequent the gravelly Ihallows, where the female digs confi- 
derable holes, in which Ihe depofits the roe. During this-o- 
peration, which ufually continues for fome weeks, the n ale 
attends her, and both are in a very torpid ftate. The black- 
lifliers, provided with fpears, compofed of 5 barbed prongs, 
fixed upon a ftrong fliaft, wade up and down upon the /hal- 
lows, preceded by a great torch, or blaze, as it is called, con- 
Ming of dried broom, or fir tops, faflened round a pole. By 
this light the fifli are foon difcerned, and being then very dull, 
are eafily transfixed. Formerly regular fifh courts (as th«»y 
were called), were held once a-year at leaft, before the juftices 
of the diftria, where perfons fufpefted of this pra£lice were 
put upon oath, and if they refufed to clear themfelves in that 
manner, or if their guilt was proved by proper evidence, they 
were liable to fines and imprifonment. At prefent, no atten- 
tion 13 paid to prevent a pradice equally againft the laws of 
the country, deftruaive of the health, and fubverfive of the 
morals of thofe who follow it. The fifh, at this feafon, are 
very unwholefome food; the ftrongefl: conftitutions often fuf- 
fer from wading up to the middle in water for hours together 
in the dead of the night of all the year ; and a black-fifliing 
match often ends in drunkennefs and debauchery. There is 
a bridge of 2 arches over the river Ifla in this parifh, on the 
high road from Dunkeld and Blairgowrie to Kerriemuir and 
Brechin. It is not known when it was built, but, from its 
conftruftion, being narrow, appears to be ancient. It was 
lately repaired, and is of great fervice to the country, there 
being only other 2, befides it, upon the river, from its fource 
at Caentochan, in the head of Glenifla parllh, to its jundlion 
with the Tay at Kinclaven, in a ftretch upwards of 40 miles.

riie many melancholy accidents which have happened at one 
of the fords of this river, might be expeded to work upoa 
the feelings of all concerned, fo far as to induce them to ad4 
one more at leaft to the number. 

Ecclefiajiical Matters, Stiperul, Poor, \Sc. — Tradition fays, 
that the church of RutJiven was ereded by the Earl of Craw^ 
ford, proprietor of the barony of Inverquiech, for the accom- 
piodatiou of his tenants, feveral of them having been killed 
by the Rollos of Balloch, in going to their parifli church of 
Alyth. Afterward, when the turbulent neighbours were re- 
moved, and the church became of no further ufe to the te- 
nants of Inverquiech, the proprietor of Ruthvcn got that ba- 
rony erefted into a feparate pariOi, and obtained the Earl of 
Crawford's chapel, which lay convenient, to be the pariOi 
church, and the lands mortified to its minifler to be a glebe. 
It does not appear how this tranfadfon was brought about, 
probably it might have been through the interference of the 
abbot of Arbroath, who was both patron of the parifh, and 
titular of the tithes. Upon the forfeiture of the Paamuir fa- 
mily, in 1715, the right of patronage devolved to the 
Crown: the minitter is titular of the tithes by a gift in the 
year 1634, from the Marquis of Hamiltom, then proprietor 
of the Abbey-lands, to Mr. Patrick Crichton, rr.inifter of 
Ruthven, and his fucceflbrs in office. The flipend is below 
the mmimum, and has never been augmented. The glebe, 
confiding of upwards of .0 acres of good foil, is pleafantly 
fituated on the W. bank of the river Ifla. with a gentle Hope 
to the S and E. The living, including, the glebe, may be 
reckoned rather better than 60 1. ....w^,,

rent is exclufive of the oak, and other plantations, the mofs- 
Kiarl, the annual value of which cannot eafily be afcertained. 
The oaks are fold once in 20 years for the bark : the laft time 
they were cut down, about 18 years ago, they gave nearly 
aoo 1. From the increafed value of oak-bark, a very great 
life is now expeaed. At the laft cutting, between 3000 and 
4000 of the beft trees were referved, which have thriven re- 
jmarkably. 

According to Dr. Webfter's report, the population in 1755 
was 280. The number of the parifliioners in all, is now 
220 : The medium number of births, for the laft 7 years, is 
7., and of deaths 4. The parifti has been gradually on the 
decreafe, owing to the enlarging of the farms. This has alfo 
contributed, in a great degree, to the removal of the cottagers *. 

The 

* The tenants being reftrifted from fubfetting mdre or lefs, are efFe£lually 
prevented from having cottagers upon the old eftcblilhment. Until very lately, 
all of them had their proportion of thefe ufeful dependants. Every cottagej. 
femily in this parifli, poffefled a hotife, garden, grafs for one cov7, and one com- 
puted acre of good ground. The ground was laboured by the farmer, who alfa 
drove out their dung, brought home their corn and fuel, confifting of peat and 
turf. The one half of their acre was in oats, the other in barley. The rent 
was 1 1. a-man reaper in harveft. The cottager and his family were fubjea to the 
call of the farmer, for what other work he might need, and were paid accord- 
ing to the rate of the country. With thefe advantages, and their own induPa

•The parlQiIoners are all of the Eftablifhed Church, except 2 of 
the Church of England, who attend public worfhip regular- 
ly in the parifli church, while thej refide here. The parifhi- 
oners, for the moft part, are employed in agriculture ; there 
are, however, a few manufaaurers, tradefmen, millers, and 
day-labourers. They are, in general, honeft, fober and in- 
duftrious, living peaceably and comfortably. The ague was 
formerly very common among them, probably from their 
poor way of living ; but now it is fcarcely ever heard of. 

Antiquities.— On the S. and W. fide of the parifli, there is 
an enclofure of great antiquity, concerning the ufe of which 
tradition gives no account. It is nearly of a fquare form, 
and contains about an Englifli acre of ground. The walls, 
which are of earth, as far as can be judged, have been origi- 
nally of coufiderable height and breadth. A deep and wide 
ditch on the outfide of the wall, filled with water from an ad- 
joinino- morafs, is ftill almoft entire. This fort, now known 
by the name of Caftledykes, was probably a place of retreat 
to the neighbourhood in times of turbulence and barbarifm. 
The north part of this parifli is faid to have been the fcene of 
engagement between the Englifli and Scotch forces, under 
King Edward and Robert Bruce. Although there is no men- 
tion of this flcirmifli in hifliory, yet it is confirmed by feveral 
monuments of antiquity and tradition : confirmed in this man- 
ner, it muft ever be valuable in a country where authentic re- 
cords have been deftroyed by the barbarous policy of its in- 
vaders. The Englifli army feems, at this time, to have been

at home, the cottagers, in general, lived comfortably according to their ftation, 
and brought up a numerous and harjly offspring. For the moft part they have 
emigrated to the manuiadluring towns, and their removal has proved, in many 
refpects, an eflenttal lofs to the interefts of agriculture, particularly for one ar- 

^.ticle, having rendered country fervants and day -labourers very expenCve, aud

ftationed on the S. fide of Strathmore, at Inglifton, (/. e. Eng- 
lifu town) where remains of their camp are ftill difcernible ; 
the Scotch forces, or a confiderable part of them, at leaft, on 
the N. fide of the ftrath, at the foot of the Grampian moun- 
tains, having their front covered by the river Ida. A coni- 
cal mount in this parilh, called Saddle-hillock, is faid to have 
been made ufe of by the Englifh, perhaps to command the 
ford at Dellavaird, whilft their troops marched over to at- 
tack the Scotch, and to have received its name from fome cir- 
cumftance which took place on that occafion, but which is not 
diftinftly related. The hillock ftands upon a very level field, 
is of confiderable height, and has upon its top the remains of 
a fmall earthen fort, evidently artificial ; and appears from an 
opening made in its fide, to have been compofed of large 
flones, fome of which are fmoothed, as if they had been taken 
from the bed of the river. Whether it was erefted on this 
occafion, or whether it might not have been much more an- 
cient, it is not eafy to determine. It would appear that the 
Englifli were repulfed in their attempt to ford the river, pur- 
fued by the Scotch, and brought to an engagement, to the 
S. of the river, and hillock above mentioned, where, under 
a huge cairn in the E. moor (heath) of Ruthven, their dead- 
are faid to be buried. On the S. fide of the river, in the pa- 
rifti of Alyth, the place where the Scotch forces were fta- 
tloned, ftill goes by the name of Brucetown ; and 2 large 
ftanding ftones are ftill to be feen erefted in remembrance of 
this event. Upon one of thefe is a reprefentation of a horfe- 
ihoe, an emblem fufficiently expreffive in the eventful hiftory 
of the celebrated Scottifli hero *.

The principal dependence of the parifhioners for fuel is upon 
coal from Dundee, the neareft fea port. The parifh contains 
fliell marl, of very fine quality. It is found, for the moft part 
under pcat-mofs ; fomctimes, however, under fand, and, what 
IS remarkable, at one place, under a bed of pure clay, upwards 
of 3 feet thick. There is, indeed, a field of clay in the neigh- 
bourhood, but, as there is no running water near it, except 
fmall fprings, it is not eafy to conceive the length of time re- 
quifite for thefe, or the ordinary wafliing of rain-water, to 
have carried away and depofited fuch a tenacious fubftance as 
clay, to fuch a thicknefs above the marl, which, from its na- 
ture, mull have been formed by degrees in the bottom of a 
lake. It is upwards of jo years fince this ufeful manure was 
difcovered; but, fuch was the ignorance and obftinacy of the 
country people, that it was a long time before they would a- 
vail themfelves of it. It is even told, that fome of the neigh- 
bouring proprietors were under the neceffity of binding their 
tenants under a penalty to make ufe of a certain quantity of 
it yearly. Afterward, however, when they began to per-

Advantageous Situation for Machinery .—Kx. Balbirnie, up- 
on the E. fide of the river Ifla, there is a good fituation for a 
tiiftillery. Farther up the river, and on each fide of the Lin, 
-tphere the corn and waulknaills ftand, there are excellent fitu- 
•ations for machinery, where, with little expenfe, a. great bo- 
dy of water could be procured during the whole year, to any 
necelfary height. Thefe are two other fituations for mills, 
at prefent unoccupied. The one at the bridge on the N. fide, 
Wh6re there was a -Waulk (or fulling) mill formerly ; the o- 
thet at a little diftance on the S. fide of the bridge, where a 
lint mill ftood forte years ago. It might be mentioned, that 
there would be a capital fituation for machinery on the wa- 
ter ridge of the glebe, with an excellent freeftone quarry, 
within 200 yards of it. What would be greatly in favour of 
this fituation, is, that the low glebe, confifting of about i6 
acres of fine foil, lies direftly above the water ridge, is very 
level, and might be watered, in every diredlion, for bleaching 
ground, by a fmall rivulet which never dries up, called the 
Kirkton burn. The abundance of freettone in this parifti, its 
centrical fituation to the manufacturing villages of Cupar An- 
gus, Alyth, and Kirriemuir, its moderate diftance from the 
fiourifliing town of Dundee, being only 15 miles, and 12 of 
thefe upon a turnpike road ; the pleafantnefs and fertility of 
the country, and the reafonable price of provifions added to 
the water-falls above mentioned, feem to concur in pointing 
out this little parifli as a defirable fpot for machinery and ma- 
pufa£ture. Something of this kind is much wanted to quicks

en the induftry of the tenants, and give a ready market t» 
many articles at prefent of little value. It is to be hoped, 
that thefe, natural advantages will not alv/ays be overlooked, 
and that an obferving and induftrious age will at length avail 
itfelf of circumftances fo ftrikingly favourable. 

State of the Parijh 50 years ago. — Agriculture was in the 
fame rude ftate in this parifli 50 years ago, that it had been 
for time immemorial, without any improvement or alteration 
whatever. A fmall portion of the farm, called the infield, 
which lay contiguous to the houfe, received all the dung, and 
was kept conftantly in crop with barley and oats, or fomc- 
times with flax, as the ground was in condition to bear it. 
The reft of the farm was called the outfield, and kept for 
pafture, in fuch natural grafs as it could produce. That 
part of the outfield which was arable, after remaining three 
years in grafs, was cropped for other three years fuccef- 
fively with black oats, an inferior kind of grain, of which 2 
bolls at leaft were required to give i boll of meal. Unac- 
quainted with the method of raifmg artificial graffes, and un- 
able to maintain their beftial upon their fcanty pafture, the 
tenants were under the neceflity of fending the greater part of 
them to the glens in the Highlands, from the conclufion of the 
feed- time, about the beginning of June, until about the mid- 
dle of September. From the want of turnip, and other green 
food, their cattle were poorly fed in winter, and their cows 
gave little or no milk. In place of milk, they were necefli- 
tated to have recourfe to the wretched fubftitute of Ikrine, or 
unboiled flummery, prepared from the refufe of oatmeal foaked 
in water. A cow was never known to have a calf oftener 
than once in two years. Animal food was never feen in a 
farmer's houfe above once op twice a-year. The rent was 
trifling, but the tenant was inaftive, perfifting in the beaten

Their great dependence at that time was upon their Iheep of 
v,hich they bred and maintained confxderable numbers Af- 
ter the feparation of the crop from the ground, the fields be- 
came then a kind of common pafturage, until the enfmng feed- 
time • but upon the introduaion of fown grafs and turnip, it 
becar^e neceffary to put away the fheep ; and there are now 
only a very few for private ufe. The whole of the wool

len cloth, with part of which the farmer clad himfelf and 
family the remainder was fold to help to pay the rent. All 
the flax which was then raifed, and which, like 1;he wool, was 
confiderable in quantity, but more fo in quality, was manu- 
faaured in the parilh for home confumption, or fold m yarn.

a comparative ftate of this pariOi, and even throw fome light 
on the ftate of other parilhes, not only at the period alluded 
to, but for a long time back.-^iVoff : 50 years are mentioned,

<p>Name, Situation, Extetit, Soil, &amp;c; 

THE name of the parifh is faid to be derived from the 
Gaelic. It is about 7 miles long and 3 broad. The 
foil is various ; in fome places a deep black mould, but the 
greater part is light and gravelly, intermixed with clay, which 
is early, and produdlive of good crops. There are no moun- 
tains nor hills. A fmall river or rivulet called Ythan, abound- 
' ing with trouts, which takes its rife from two fprings, runs 
from the S. W. to the N. E., and pafles through the pariili. 
In fummcr it caii be ftepped over in many places, but gradu- 
ally increafes by the addition of many other ftreams as it 
glides along towards the fea, and becomes a pretty large river 
at Ellon, where a fine bridge has lately been built.

Pap«/«//o«.-According to Dr. Webfter's report, th. po-

there ^ere 1360 fouls in it; at prefent there are fcarcely

ftHte fome extenfive farms have been waRe, and feveral crofts 
for a number of years. On other eftates, two farms have 
been put into one. On all thefe were many famihes, who 
have gone to manufafturing towns, or otherwife, where they 
have daily employment. There are not 40 diffenters m the 
parllh ; 3 of them Roman Catholics, 5 Seceders, and the reft 
Epifcopals. There are 6 heritors, one of whom only rehdes 
in the parifh at prefent. From January i775 to January 
1793. there have been 53^ baptifms and 170 marriages, 
which, at an average, is 10 marriages and about 31 bap- 
tifms in the year. 

Chureh, Stipend, Poor, ^c.-A new handfome church was 
built in 1780, and the manfe in i'j69. The ftipend, includ- 
ing communion elements, grafs^-money, &amp;c. is about 40I. los. 
with 48 bolls oat-meal. An augmentation of 48 bolls meal, 
and a fmall addition for communion elements was decreed by 
the court of teiuds in February 1 791, but never yet localled.

purchafes of thefe and Englilh barley, and by a noble and feafonable fupply of 
thefe articles, gratuitoufly fent from London, by the humane and benevolent 
Meffrs. Ph-n and E-is, the lives of the parifliioners were preferred. The 
kirk-feffion's fund, were reduced by the exertions made, from iSol. to 120I.

that three-fourths of the people lived for feveral months almoft wholly on peafe.

hardlhips on the induftrious improving tenant, which, it is 
to be hoped, will, ere long, become obfolete.

parilh. The improving tenants, in general, ufe the light Eng.

Though the expenfe of. horfes is great, yet the large quanti- 
ties of meal and bear they carry to market, or a fea-port, and 
the great quantity of lime they bring home for their grounds, 
obliges them to ufe horfes for every purpofe. Double carts

fttong horfes. Oats, bear and peafe, are the only kinds of 
grain fown here, principally the two firft. Of thefe great 
quantities areraifed, and much meal exported every year. Ex- 
tenfive fields are laid out yearly for hay and pallure. The 
grafs-feeds are fown in with bear or oats ; what is defigned 
for hay is generally after turnip, of which large quantities are 
fown, fome in broad caft, fome in drills. Tne turnips are 
ufed for feeding, not only for the butcher and their own fa- 
milies, but principally for their young cattle, which the far- 
mer finds much more for his advantage ; as being fed on tur- 
nip through the winter and fpring, and full grazing in the 
fummer, they rife to a confiderable fize, and bring from 5 1. 
to 7 1. or upwards, at 3 years of age. Potatoes are planted in 
gicat abundance on every farm and croft. Ujpon the S. fide

of thefe fine and extenfive farms were in the fame neglefted 
ilate w.th many others in the country. The leafes were ge- 
nerally for 19 years. On one eftate moftly liferents. By 
the firft, the farmer tried to improve his ground for 9 or 10 
years, and the remainder of his leafe, he fcourged and over- 
cropped It, by which he both injured himfclf and the poiTef- 
fion. By the fecond, or liferent leafes, the .judicious farmer 
faw he might ruin himfelf, by launching out too far in im- 
proving his farm, and might be cut olF by death before he 
drew m any return for the expenfes he had been at, and leave 
his family deftitute. Therefore, to remedy thefe evils, feve- 
ralof them applied to the proprietors to have their leafes 
lengthened out to a longer period. This feveral of the moft 
improving tenants obtained, and got new leafes for their own 
lifetime, 19 years after that, and a lifetime to one of their 
fons, upon paying a graffum or fine, or a moderate rife of 
rent at the commencement of each of thefe periods. This en- 
-couraged the fpirited and enterprifing tenant, which has had 
a moft happy eiFed. The exertions they now make are very 
great. Englifti ftell lime is now brought from Banff or 
M'DufF, at the diftance of 18 or 20 miles in large quanti. 
ties. Inftances are not wanting here of farmers carrying 
400, joc, and even from 1000 to 1200 bolls to lay on their 
poffeflions in the courfe of one year, which wiU foon amply 
compenfate them for this great expenfe. It has anfwered

fore thofe in the lower walks of life, that has excited in them, 
..(where properly encouraged), the like fpirit of improvement 

by bringing lime at the fame diftance to their crofts, or fmall 

pendicles, even when they have but one fmall horfe and cart. 

Lch farmers, fome of them men of enlarged ideas, are pub- 
lic bleffings. Confcious of the inconvenience and hardflups 
they labour under, by the aforementioned fervices and cuftoms, 
they have let off part of their grounds to fubtenants at a rea- 
fonable rent, have built houfes for them, given them leafes 
and exaa not one day's fervice from them ; only when they 
have occafion to hire them as day-labourers, that they IhaE 
fervc them in preference to another^ 

Miscellaneous Ohfervations.—V^zts and turf have always 
been the fuel ufed here, which, in digging, drying and carry- 
ing home, employed the farmer and his fervants the grcateft 
..part of the fummer, as the moffes are at the diftance of 6 or 7 
miles from many of the farms. Now the more enlightened 
farmers ufe no more peats than is neceffary for their kitchens, 
and drying their corns for meal, but choofe rather to bring 
Englifli coal from Banff or M'Duff, though the price is ex- 
travagantly high, fometimes 22 d. the barrel, of 12 ftone 
weight. A few draughts of their carts will bring coal fuffi- 
cient to ferve them through the year ^ and thus they have 
time during the fummer for carrying lime for their farms. 
If the unequal and oppreffive duty on coals carried coaft-ways 
were taken off, it would be the greateft advantage to this pa- 
rifli, (where the ordinary fuel is fcarcely to be had, efpecial- 
ly in wet fummers), as well as it would be to the whole of 
the north of Scotland. There are about 1500 black cattle in 
the pariih ; 200 horfes of various fizes ; and 1600 flieep^

comprehends 90 acres Scotch, or 120 of Englifii meafure.

the authors of all the ftupendous military works, whether roads or places of 
defence, fcattered over the country, we are no longer at a lofs to know. An 
ingenious and worthy gentleman, a native of the neighbouring parifh of Forguc, 
.and who has ferved as an officer in the Royal corps of Artillery, fince the year 
1758, wasdefirousto compare what he had feen during his own time, with 

• what could be ftill traced in the country, of Reman field fortificatioB, and other 
topographical marks of their wife military inftitutions. His fituation at Perth, 
in the duties of his profeffion, from the year 17S5 to the end of 1787, gave 
him opportunities of fpending a great deal of his fparc time, in thefe wilhed- 
for refearches, which having purfued with unremitting afliduity, he was at laft 
enabled, contrary to an opinion which then prevailed, to demonftrate that the 
Roman armies had pafled the Grampians by land, as well as that they had fur- 
rounded the coft-Iand by their fhipping; the charader, ftyle, and manner of 
field fortification, being as evident, and as well fupported in the Caftellum or 
Barra-hill, and in the Caftra aeftiva at Glenmailen, as any where between 
them, and the pr9etentura of Agricola extending from Forth to Clyde. The 
fortified poft oppofite to Pitcaple, and a paved way of 14 feet wide, pointing 
upon it from a ftone fortrefs on the fummit of Bennachee, bear ftrong marks 
of Roman charadler, and Roman exertion. Nor are tlie fmaller pofts of nvers 
near mill of Eaftertown in Fyvie, the work on the farm of Ellis near Udny 

, and the elegant circular redoubt near the fummit of the Seed-hill of Achabar 
any ways inferior to works of the fame kind on the other fide of the Grampian 
mountains. But if it Ihould ftill be thought that thefe obfervations and rea- 
fonings on the progrefs of the Roman armies are inconclufive, the teftimony of 
Dio and Herodian, the Itinerary of Ptolemy, and above all, the Britannia Ro- 
mana of Richard of Cirencefter, lately found in Denmark, muft neceflarily re- 
move all doubts. Nor is it exceeding doubtful that the very Statio ad Ithunam 
mentioned in the Itineraries, was near the great camp already defcribed : For, 
our neighbouring gentleman, already quoted, has made many inquiries about 
antique intrenchments at Fyvie, Methlick, and Ellon, among the clergy and

made a difcovery of fome very ancient roads pafling in a N. W. diredlion through

(CouNTr AND Synod OF Argyll, Presbytery of Kintyre.)

<p>'TP HIS parifli has the ifland of Hay on the S., and that of 
Mull on the N. ; it is bounded on the W. by the At- 
lantic, and on the E. by the Sea, which waflies the coaft of 
Cregnifli, of north and fouth Knapdale, and part of Kintyre. 
Including fea, it is 50 miles long, and 30 broad. It confifts 
of 9 iflands, of which 6 are inhabited. Colonfay and Oron- 
fay are feparated by a narrow found, which ebbs dry at low 
water, and they form the weftern divifion of the parifli. A- 
bout a league and a half to the E. lies the ifland of Jura. At 
the north end of Jura, are the iflands of Scarba, Lunga, Bal- 
nahuaigh, the Garveileachan, and Eileachan-naomh. As the 
ifland of Jura forms by far the mofl: conliderable part of the 
parifli, we fliall give it the firfl: place in this account. 

Name, 



Statijlical Account 



Name^ Situatiotty Extent, and Surface — There are various 
etymologies given of Jura. Some think that it was fo deno- 
minated from the great quantity of yew trees which grew in 
the ifland. The name of the yew, in Gaelic, is Juar ; hence, 
they fay, Juarey ; and, in a contracted form, Jurey, the iiland 
of Yew Trees. Buchanan fays, that the ancient name of the 
ifland was Dera, which, in the. Gothic language, fignifies a 
ftag. This account of the name feems the moft probable, as 
there is ftill a confiderable number of deer in the ifland, and, 
as the Gael pronounce it Diura, very near the Gothic Dera. 
The tutelary faint of the ifland was Fernadal ; from him the 
burying-ground is denominated Kil-fhearnadail, or the Cell 
of Fernadal ; alfo a large oblong ftone on the fliore, 3 miles 
S. W. from the Cell, Leac-fhearnadail, or the fl;one of Fer- 
nadal ; and a farm, 1 miles N. E. of the Cell, Ard-f hearna- 
dail, or the hill of Fernadal. The ifland of Jura, with its 
appendage of little iflands at the N. end, ftretches along op- 
pofitc the coafl: of Cregnifli, of Knapdale, and nearly as far 
S. as the N. end of Gigha. Towards the S. end it may be 
about 6 leagues from the continent, towards the middle a^ 
bout 3, and at the N. end not above i. The length of the 
ifland is about 30 miles, the breadth various, but no where, 
it is believed, above 7 miles. As tlvere has been no aftual 
fuxvey, the length and breadth are not exaaiy afcertained. 
The appearance of the ifland is very romantick, and calcu- 
lated to raife fublime emotions in the fpeftator's foul. There 
is a ridge of towering mountains,, which run from S. to N. 
along the W. fide,, terminating the profped from the conti- 
nent and very often covered with clouds and darknefs. Thefe 
mountains are 4 ^ number. That to the S. is caUed Bein- 
achaolais, or the Peak of the Sound, as it ftands.over the 
Sound o£ Ilay ; the next Bein-an-oer, or the Gold Peak the 
tW a Bhein-flieunta, the Gonfecrated Peak ; and that to the 

N. Corra- 



yuta and Colonfay, 319 



K. Corra-Bhcin, the Steep Peak. Thefe peaks are feen from 
the continent of ArgyllfliLre, and from part of Perthftiire, 
from Buteflxire, Ajrfliire, Dumbartonfliu-e, and, it is faid, 
from part of Lanarkfliire. They are feen at a great diftance 
to the W., and are the firA land which the faiiors make, com., 
ing in their dire^ion from the Atlantic Ocean. TJiere is very 
little vegetation on thefe peaks, their fummits and fides are 
covered over with fragments of ftone, and exhibit a llupen- 
dous monument of the refilllefs force of time. The W. fide 
of the ifland is not fit for cultivation ; it is wild and rugged, 
interfeded with many torrents, which come ruftiing down 
from the mountains ; and has been deemed fo inhofpitable, 
that no perfon choofes to fix his habitation in it. All the in- 
habitants live on the E. fide of the ifland. Along the margin 
of the fea, on this fide, the grounds are pretty level ; but at 
a little diftance from the fiiore, there is a gradual afcent. The 
whole of this fide forms no unpleafing fcene. The coaft is, 
\xi feveral places, variegated with bays and harbours, and 
points of land ; the arable and pafture grounds fpread on a 
declivity before the eye, and terminate at the bafe of thofe 
towering mountains, which form a romantick and awful back- 
ground. 

Air, Climate J and Dlfeafes — The air is pure and falubri- 
ous, as it is generally in the fea-coafi;, and in hilly countries. 
The clouds are, indeed, often intercepted by the high hills, 
and defcend in torrents ; but we have confl;ant breezes, fome- 
times brills: gales of wind, to dry up the rain. The tops of 
the mountains are covered with fnow a confiderable part of 
winter, but it feldom lies long on the low grounds. The in- 
habitants are very healthy, and many of them live to old 
age. A few weeks ago, died, a lady at the age of 96. She 
retained the ufe of her faculties to the laft. Till within a

few months of her death, flie could walk about with confi- 
derable vigour, could read the fmalleft print, or thread the 
fineft needle without the help of glafles. The difeafes arc 
few in number, owing, perhaps in a ^ood meafure, to the 
limple mode of living of the inhabitants. They are fome- 
times feized with inflammatory diforders ; this feems to be 
occafioned by the lightnefs of their clothing, particularly of 
their bed-clothing, which is not fufficieut to keep up the 
perfpiration while they are at reft. They are liable to thofe 
diforders, which are occafioned by living much upon milk 
and fifli. Of late, rheumatic complaints have become more 
general among the lower clafles. We have had one dropfical 
cafe, laft fummer, that proved fatal ; feveral have died with- 
in the laft twelvemonth of ftomach complaints. There i^ no 
furgeon in the ifland, and they never fend for one, except in 
cafes which are deemed extremely dangerous. A great pro- 
portion of children die in infancy, and many of the mothers, 
though of a ftrong conftitution, recover flowly in child-bed. 
Both thefe circumftances feem to be owing to unfkilful treat- 
ment, for there is not a fmgle bred midwife in the ifland. 
The fmall-pox, in the natural way, carried off many chil- 
dren in autumn 1791. The people entertain no prejudice 
againft inoculation, but grudge the expenfe of it. 

Soil a fid Produce. — The foil along the fhore is thin and 
very ftony ; towards the moor it is clayey, and, in fome 
places, there is improveable mofs. As the arable ground lies 
on a declivity in the neighbourhood of high hills, the water 
is conftantly oozing down through it, and, in many places, 
burfting out in little fprings ; fo that it is what the low coun- 
try farmers call fpouty ground. The crops are oats, barley, 
potatoes, and flax. There has been no trial made of artificial 
grafles^ though there are fomc fpots proper for them. Com- 
mon 



of Jur'a and Colon/ay. 3^1 

mon f^eld peafe, likewife, are not raifed here, though, from 
the nature of the foil along the fhore, they might prove a be- 
neficial crop. Oats are, in general, a very unproduaive 
crop, the greateft average returns are not above two and a- 
half. Potatoes and barley are more produdive, and, were the 
ground properly managed, might prove very valuable crops. 
The fyftem of farming here, has made very fldw advances to- 
wards improvement, and is, at leaft, half a century behind 
that, in many parts of the low country. The farmer does 
nothing to his grounds all the fummer. Although there is plen- 
ty of lime-ftone on the oppofite fliore of Knapdale, and in the 
adjoining ifland of llay, and plenty of peat in Jura, for burn- 
ing lime, yet no perfon remembers a fingle trial made of that 
manure. The only manure ufed is the fea-weed, which is to 
be had in great abundance, and gives one tolerable crop. This 
anfwers the contraded views of the farmer, who keeps the 
beft patches of his ground conftantly in tillage, and labours 
like one who is not certain of his pofleffion beyond the pre* 
fcnt year. The farmers of this country are utter ftrangers to 
the mode of abridging labour. It is no uncommon thing to 
fee 12 men and 20 horfes at work in a farm, which 3 men 
and four horfes would, on an improved plan, labour to much 
better purpofe. 

Quadrupeds, Birds, &amp;.C. — The tame animals are cows, hor- 
fes, fheep, and goats. The fmall tenants, in general, over- 
ftock their grounds, fo that the black cattle are rather fmall^ 
and inferior to thofe of Hay. The horfes alfo, though hardy, 
are a very diminutive breed. The flieep of Jura are remarkable 
for the finenefs of their wool, and the delicacy of their flefli. 
Were proper care taken to keep this breed from degenerating, 
by mixing with the Galloway flieep now introduced into the 
ifland ; were it allowed to increafe, and cover the greateft part

of the ifland, Jura, in the courfc of a few years, might havft 
very confidcrable returns from its wool, and tranfport annual- 
ly the increafe of its flocks to richer paftures on the continent, 
where the mutton would greatly excel that of the Englifli, or 
Low Country fliecp. There are feveral flocks of goats in Ju- 
ra, but they are much on the decreafe. They are not fo pro- 
fitable as flieep ; they carry no fleece, and tlieir flefla is infe- 
rior. The inhabitants of this ifland would find it their inte- 
reft to banifh two-thirds of the horfes which they keep, to 
rear fewer black cattle, and to extend their ftock of fhcep and 
goats. As there is very little meadow ground in the ifland, 
and the arable ground makes fuch poor returns in oats, it 
ought certainly to be the grazier's objed to keep fuch a ftock 
principally as would fliift for itfelf in winter. 

There are one or two herds of red deer traverfing the moun- 
tains. We have plenty of groufe, fome termagan, and black 
game ; but no partridge, no hare, and very few rabbits. A- 
mong our birds of prey are the eagles, which build their nefl:s 
in the inacceffible precipices on the W. fide of Jura, and prove 
very dellruaive to the kids and lambs. The fifli commonly 
caught here are cuddies, and fayths. In autumn there are 
fonie lythe, and fmall cod. There is a very delicate fifli that 
maybehad through, the whole year, called by the country peo- 
ple murloch. It is very long in proportion to its thicknefs, 
and, in flaape, refembles the dog-fifli ; it is covered with a ve- 
ry rough Ikin, like ftiagreen, of which it muft be ftripped. 
In an arm of the fea that runs in on the W. fide, and almoft 
divides Jura m the middle, there are great quantities of lob- 
Her, oyfters, and craw fifli. The marine plant, of which kelp

Harhotirs, 



Of Jura and Colonfay, 323 

^,,,,„,,:^There are two very fine harbonrs on the E 
fidfof the ifland ; that to the S. is called the Small Ifles • and 
the N. the Lowland-Man's, Bay They are wuhm a 
!w miles of each other. The harbour at the Small Ifles .s a 
capacious bay, about 4 -les in extent. Into the mo^t^^^^^^ 
1 bay are thrown longitudinally 3 or ^ ff^^ ^"^^^^^l^ 
but narrow openings into the harbour, and form a ^^o.gh.r- 
Z a.ainft the violence of the fea. It is from thefe .flands 
Z the harbour takes its name. Lowland-Man's Bay opens 
towards the S., is contraded at the entrance by 2 pomts of 
land, which run ont, like two arms, but is pretty capacious 
within. The harbour of Small Ifles is rather fliallow for yef- 
"fels of great draught of water, but this is deep enough for any 
vefl-el Notwithftanding the excellence of thefe harbours, 
and that Jura is only a few hours failing from the lochs where 
herrings are fiflied, there is no veilel above 5 qr 6 tons bur- 
then belonging to the ifland, and of thefe there is none em- 
ployed in the fiftieries. The courfe of the tides along thp 
coaft of Jura, particularly in the found of Scarba, and m that 
of Hay is very rapid. The navigation of the found of Hay 
dangerous, not only from the rapidity of the tides, running 
6 miles an hour, and from the fudden fqualls wh^ch come 
from the neighbouring hills, but alfo from foul ground. Many 
vefl'els have been lofl: in this dangerous found. As a confidcr- 
able' number of thqfe trading to the north feas have occafiofi 
to pafs through it, one fliould think that it ought to he care- 
fully examined and furveyed, to f^e what improvements are 
pradlicable. 

Population.— According to Dr. Webfler's report, the num- 
ber of fouls in 1755 was 1097. To afcertain the prefent po- 
pulation of this parifli, a furvey was made in June 1792.

As the prefent incumbent has not been long in the parifli 
of Jura, and as he has not been able to procure former exa- 
mination rolls, it is out of his power to give a flatement of 
the population prior to the date of his own furvej. Emigra- 
tions to America have proved, once and again, a drain to this 
jfland ; but, in the prefent mode of management, it may be 
faid to be ftill overftocked with inhabitants. Near half the 
farms in the iiland are in pafture, and require very few hands 
to manage them. Of courfe, the great body of the people 
live in the farms, which are in tillage. In fome of thefe there 
are between 50 and 60 fouls. Such a fwarm of inhabitants, 
where manufaftures, and many other branches of induftry are 
unknown, are a very great load upon the proprietors, and in 
a great meafure ufelefs. to the ftate. The flighteft furvey of 
the lituation of the people fliows how much improvements in 
farming, and the introduflion of induftry, are wanted. ^The 
fpirit of emigration is ftill powerful in the ifland, and requires 
confiderable alterations to extinguifh it *,

a very fine kind of fao^d ufed in the manufaaure of glafs.

„.ore places than one, we can trace along the declivity of a 
hill, the ruins of a wall, that was about feet high, termi- 
nating, perhaps, at a lake, or fome very abrupt fteep place. 
At the lower extremity of the wall, there is a deep pit, a- 
bove 12 feet diameter at tbe mouth, and very much contrad- 
ed at the bottom. This, tbe tradition of the country fays, 
^as a contrivance ufed in former times for taking the wild 
boar. The huntfmen drove him along the wall, till he took 
refuge at laft in the pit, and there was made captive. At the

The tax upon marriages and baptifms is matter of complaint, cfpecially in 
fuch a parifli as this, where there is very little circulation of money. It is fuch 
a trifle, that it feems beneath the dignity of taxation, and goes contrary to the 
famous jus trium liberorum, to ftrike at the very roots of national ftrength and 
glory. Inftead of exafling fuch an odious tax, a fmall encouragement for keep- 
ing parifli records with greater attention, might turn out of much greater ad- 



Tantage to the ft^te.

mains of a confiderable encampment. On the fide toward the 
fliore, there is a triple line of defence, with deep ditches ; 
from the centre of the work, the earth was fcooped out, to a 
confiderable depth, in the form of 3 ellipfes placed longitudi- 
nallj, and thrown up in large mounds on the right and left. 
On the fide toward the hills, there were regular baftions form- 
ed all along ; and at the E. end, on a line with the centre, is 
to be feen a pretty large mount, which feems to have been a 
place of arms. The famous Gulf" of Breacan lies between 
Jura and Scarba. The found between thefe two iflinds is 
narrow, and fornriing a communication between the Atlantic 
and the internal fea on the coalf of Argyll ; the rapidity and 
violence of the tides are tremendous. The gulf is mod aw- 
ful with the flowing tide; in ftormy weather, with that tide, 
it exhibits an afpect, in which a great deal of the terrible is 
blended. Vaft openings are forn^ied, in which one would 
think the bottom might be feen j immenfe bodies of water 
tumble headlong, as over a precipice, then rebounding from 
the abjfs, meet the torrents from above ; they daili together 
■with inconceivable impetuofity, rife foammg to a prodigious 
height above the furface: the noife of their conflict is heard 
through the furrounding iflands. This gulf is an objeft of 
as great terror to the modern, as Sylla and Charybdis were 
to the ancient mariners. It is induftrioufly avoided by all 
who navigate thefe founds : there are inftances, however, of 
veffels being drawn into it. Large flout veflels make their 
way through it in its greatefl rage, but to fmall craft it proves 
immediate deftrudlion. 

It will be proper, in this place, to give a fliort account of 
the iflands at the N. end of Jura. Scarba is very rugged, 
and mountainous ; it is about 3 miles long, and nearly as ma- 
ny broad. Lunga is not fo mountainous, and is about 2 miles 
' long, and half a mile broad. Balnahuaigh is about a mile in

Situation, Extent, and 5«rr.._This wellern divifion of 
the panfb, being confidered as one ifland, has Mull on the 
N., IS wafhedby the Atlantic on the W, and ftretches acrofs 
the found of Ilaj on the E. , from which circumftance, it is 
cal eddefcnptivelj,EileanTarfuing,or the Crofs-lying Ifland. 
Ireland is the next land to it on the ^. It is a flat ifland, 
^^'hen compared with the towering peaks of Mull and Jura 
m Its neighbourhood. The furface, however, is very un- 
equal ; there is a confiderable number of rugged hills, cover- 
ed over with heath. This divifion of the parifh has been fur. 
veyed, and found to meafure about 8000 acres, of which a- 
bout 30CO are faid to be arable. 

Air, Climate, Soil, — The temperature of the air, and 
the climate, are nearly the fame as in Jura. The inhabitants 
are robuft and healthy; they live in the fame fimple manner 
■with their brethren in Jura, and have neither lawyer nor fur- 
geon in the ifland. The foil is generally light; along fhe 
ihores it is fandy, but more fertile, and not fo ftony as that 
of Jura. Barley and potatoes are more produftive crops here 
than oats. Artificial graffes have been tried, and are found 
to anfwcr. The fea-weed, of which there is great abundance 
for kelp and manure, has been tried with fuccefs upon mea- 
dow ground. When the furface is quite covered with it in 
winter, a diflblution and incorporation with the foil takes 
place, the natural clover and finer grafl^es arc encouraged to 
fhoot up, and a moll luxuriant crop follows. The pafture

into pafture, is making rapid progrefs in Colonfay. The beft

The breed of horfes is fmall, and hardy, like that in Jura, 
' The art of abridging labour, and keeping a few good cattle, 
has not as yet eftabliflied itfelf in this diftant corner. Thofe 
innocent animals, the flieep, are totally baniflied, although 
there are no quickfet hedges ; and nature feems to have def- 
tined the heath-covered hills for their ufe. There are great 
numbers of rabbits in the ifland j but no hare, no partridge, 
and very few groufe.

Antiquities, li^.— The remains of feveral Romifti chapels 
are to be feen in Golonfay. There was a monaftery of Cif- 
tercians in this iHand. Their abbey flood in Golonfay, and 
its priory in Oronfay. The remains of the abbey were, with 
Gothic barbarity, torn afunder not many years ago, and the 
Hones put into a new building. The walls of the priory are 
ilill Handing, and next to Icolmkill, is one of the fineft relx- 
gious monuments of antiquity in the Hebrides. No metaU 
of any kind, fo far as I could learn, have been difcovered m 
Colonfay. There are great quantities of fea-coral on the 
fliores, and it proves a very good manure.

built about i8 years ago ; till then there was no manfe m the

.paired about 4 years ago, but fo infufficiently, that it needs 
new repairs. The ftipend is aooo merks, out of ^.hxch the 
xniniller pays, in terms of the decreet of augmentation, 800 
merks to his affiftant in Colonfay. The manfe and glebe 
„,aybe worth about 10 1. The allowance for communion 
elements is 2I. 10 s. This fum is exceedingly fmaU, and not 
at all adequate to the purpofe. It is a peculiar hardfliip to 
the minifter of Jura to be tied down to pay fuch a large pro- 
portion out of his benefice to an affiftant-preacher, while he 
muft, at the fame time, incur the expenfe and danger of croff- 
ing broad perilous ferries to marry and baptize m the other 
iflands. It is believed that there can be very few mftances 
produced in Scotland, where the minifter is not allowed to 
ftipulate with his affiftant, but obliged to take his chance of 
payments himfelf, and regularly pay his affiftant a fum equal 
to 2-5ths of his ftipend—There are no funds for the poor 
except the weekly coUeftions, and the cafualties from fines 
and marriage-money. Thefe different items may amount to 
lol. a-year. The poor in this parifti are not much in the 
habits of going about and begging ; they are generally affift- 
ed by their relations, and very few of them have their fok 
dependence on the parifti box.-There are 3 fchools ; a pariih 
fchool, and 2 charity fchools. The pariffi fchool is in Jura ; 
the falary is 7 1. One of the charity fchools is in Colonfay, 
and the other in Jura. The falary of each of thefe is 15 1. 
Thefe fchools are of prodigious fervice towards enHghtening 
the underftanding, and improving the heart of a generation, 
that otherwife would be negleded. So many inftances can 
be produced from the hiftory of mankind, and from the noble 
exertions of the Society for Propagating Chriftian Know-

ledge, to prove that induftry, probity, and every virtue, 
grow and flourifli, not in a ftate of favage ignorance, but of 
civilization, of light, and of religion, that every encourage- 
ment ought to be given to this excellent inllitution. It can 
be ftiown in the cleareft manner, that the landlords in the 
Highlands and iflands, ought not only to be pundual infulfil- 
ling the eafy requifitions of the Society ; but that it is their 
intereft, fhould the charity fchools be withdrawn, to educate 
the youth at their own expenfe *. 

Mifcellaneotis Ohfervations. — The language univerfally fpo- 
ken in the parifh is Gaelic. Very few of the old people un- 
derftand Englifti. But from the laudable endeavours of the 
fchoolmafters to teach their fcholars the vocabulary, and ufe 
of that language, and from a general opinion gaining ground, 
that it will be of great fervice in life, it is hoped that the rif- 
ing generation will make confiderable progrefs in acquiring 
the Englifh language. The inhabitants do not feel that 
ftrong defire of bettering their circumftances, that would fti- 
mulate them to exertion and enterprize. Inftead of trying 
the efFefts of induftry at home, they fofter the notion of get- 
ting at once into a ftate of eafe and opulence, with their rela- 
tions beyond the Atlantic. 

Adtiantages and I) if advantages. — Among the difadvantagcs 
of this parifli, are its remote lituation, the breadth and diffi- 
culty 

• Trice of labour. — A male fervant employed in the bufinefs of farming, gets 
for the half year 2I. ; a female fervant employed in the fame bufinefs, gets for 
the half year 1 1. ; a day labourer is paid 6 d. and his viduals ; a tailor 6 d. ; a 
fhoemaker 6d.; a boat-carpenter i s. a day ani viduals, The price of labourr 
though confiderably liigher than it was fome years ago, is ftill appai-ently low ; 
but the labour is in proportion. Induftry and the arts, have made fuch flovt 
progrefs, that the expenfe of labour is full higher than iu the low coun^^

;ulty of its ferries to the main ihore. Had the inhabitants 
cafier accefs to fee the induftry, and mode of living in the in- 
terior parts of the country, they would probably foUow tlie 
example of their more enlightened neighbours. Under this 
difadvantage, the landed gentlemen ought to beflow double di- 
ligence in opening the minds of the people ; turning their at- 
tention to the common branches of education ; introducing a- 
mong them a fpirit of induftry and improvements. The 
ifland of Jura labours under a peculiar difadvantage from the 
great number of rapid rivers with which it is interfedled. 
Thefe come tumbling down from the mountains ; and as they 
are not bridged, render the roads often impaffabie. There 
are no lefs than 6 of them in the fpace of 4 miles. The fuel 
ufed in this parifli is peat, which, from the frequent rains in 
this watery climate, becomes very precarious. Laft fummer 
not above half the fuel was got home, and even that in very 
bad condition. But it is hoped that the legiflature will adopt 
proper meafures to take the duty off an aiticle fo univerfallj 
and abfolutely neceflary as coal. 

The advantages of this parilh are its nearnefs to the lochs, 
where herring are caught j the great quantities of fea-weed 
every where on the ibores, both for the purpofes of kelp and 
of manure. The fea-coral of Colonfay is a valuable article. 
The flate of Balnahuaigh brings confiderable returns to the 
proprietor. The fand for glafs manufadure, and the flate ia 
Jura, furely deferve attention. What in this ifland might be 
turned to great advantage, is its excellent wool. Were a few 
fpinning machines introduced, and blanketing, and ftockings 
manufaftured, the hands that could be fpared from agricul- 
ture and pafture would be ufefuUy employed, and, inftead of 
being a dead weight on the proprietors, furnifli an example 
of ufeful induftry to their neighbours. The white herring- 
fifhery is an object which might be profecuted with advantage 

from

from every corner df the parifli. The harbours of Jura, in- 
deed, give it great advantage for large veffels, but through 
all the idands there are creeks for fmall fifhing boats. Per- 
haps the beft mode of encouraging the young men to embark 
in this undertaking, would be for the gentlemen to join with 
them in fitting out a few boats of moderate fize for that pur- 
pofe. Should thefe boats be fuccefsful, they would be the 
means of circulating money, an article which^ from the ab- 
fence of trade and manufactures^ is very fcarce among the 
lower claffes. The little fums introduced in this way, would 
roufe a fpirit of adventure, and give new fprings to every 
kind of induftry. From fuch fmall beginnings the extenfive 
fifhery carried on by our buffes took its rife.

<p>Name, Geography and Natural Hijlory. 

THE origin of the pame is unknown. In a decreet of lo- 
cality, dated 1666, it is written Griffan, and was pro- 
bably, at th^t time, fo pronounced. The change of Griffan 
into Girvan, is fomewhat fimilar to tl^at qf Striveling into 
Stirling. The greatell length of the parifti from S. W. to 
N. E. is about 9 Englifh miles ; ai^d it varies in breadth from 
a to 6 miles. About two-thirds of the fouthermoft part of 
the parifh is hilly. The hills never rife to a height, which, 
in Scotland, is confidered as mountainous. They are, for the 
moft part, green ; and when they are heathy, the heath is

be called the lowlands of the parifti, fituated on the fea-coafl, 
and the banks of the Girvan, though there be a confiderable 
proportion of flat ground, yet the furface prefents, in general, 
a hilly appearance. A great variety is to be found in th» 
foil ; but that which is moft prevalent, confifts of a dry light 
mould, on a fandy, or gravelly bottom. In the low part of 
the parifh, the air is remarkably dry and mild ; and in the 
light lands, vegetation begins 2 or 3 weeks earlier than in the 
country in general. In the high grounds, the air being much 
colder, and more moift, vegetation of every kind is much more 
backward. It is generally thought there is abundance of coal ia 
the low part of the parifli ; but no attempts to difcover it have 
been yet made. The inhabitants are plentifully fupplied from 
the coal- works in the parifti of Dailly. There is a great quan- 
tity of llme-flone in the high part of the parifti : but owing 
to its difl:ance from coal, the want of roads, or the unfitnefs 
of the neighbouring grounds for agriculture, it has hitherto 
been but little ufed. The lowlands are well fupplied from an 
extenfive lime- work in the neighbourhood. Little or no free- 
ftone has, as yet, been difcovered in the parifti. Pudding- 
Hone, and a kind of rotten rock, abound almoft every where. 
In feme places the grey and- blue whin-ftone is found. In 
one fpot a fmall quantity of gypfum, or plafter-ftone ; and, in 
another, a confiderable bed of fliell-marl have been difcovered. 
The houfes are all built of whin.ftone, gathered partly from 
the land, but chiefly from the fea-beach. 

The fea-coaft extends upwards of S miles along the W. fide 
of this parifli. Above a third part of the fliore is bold and 
rocky ; and, when flat, the beach is very generally covered 
with large whin-ftones. In fome parts a confiderable quanti- 
ty of fea-weed is occafionally left by the tide ; and is ufed in 
mantring the neighbouring I?nds. A little kelp is made

Population According to t)r. Web'fter's report, the num- 
ber of fouls in 1755 was 1IQ3. Of the ancient Hate of popu- 
lation in the parifli, no certain information can be obt^iined. 
No regular regifter of deaths and marriages was kept prior to 
Auguft 1783, when the tax oh regifters was impofed. For 
about 5 years after that period, this regifter was accurately 
kept f . A regifter of births has been preferved fince the lat- 
ter end of the year 1 733. From an attention to this, fo far 
as it goesi fome probable conje£lure concerning the Hate of 
population at different periods may be formed : and a compa- 
rative view of the former and f refent fituation of the parifh 
in this refped may be taken. For this purpofe, there is an-' 
nexed a table of births for 10 years fucceeding Deceuiber 
1733 ; and another for 10 years prior to January 1791 : to 
which is added a table of deaths and marriages for 5 years fuc- 
ceeding December 1783.

did not oblige any perfon to keep a regifter ; and that the only penalty for ne- 
glecting to pay the tax, was the non-entry of the name in the regifier : the con- 
fequence in this parifti has been, that the regifter of fieaths has, for fome time, 
been totally given up, and thofe of births and marriages are not fo accurate as 
ihey ftiould be.

From the above ftatements concerning the population of the 
parifti of Girvan, it appears, that for upwards of half a cen- 
tury it has been gradually increafing : that it is now double 
of what it probably was 50 or 60 years ago. Though it be 
probable that the number of inhabitants in the country part 
pf the parifh, efpecially in the Lowlands, may be fomewhat 
greater than it formerly was ; yet, without doubt, by far the 
greateft part of the increafed population is owing to the ex« 
tenfion of the town of Girvan. 40 or 50 years ago, this town 
^was fery inconfiderable. According to the beft accounts, it 

U u a confifted 



340 



Siatijl'ical Account 



confifted of about 24 houfes only ; and probably contained not 
many more than 100 fouls. It now contains upwards of 1000. 
For this great increafe various caufes may be affiftncd. A-» 
bout 30 years ago, a confidciable herring fiihing took, place 
at the mouth of the river very near the town. This fifhing 
continued for 2 or 3 years. By the concourfe of people it 
drew together, and by the wealth it produced, a fudden and 
coniiderable extenfion of the town was occafioned. The 
throwing of a number of fmall farms together, which, at one 
period, was frequently praftifed in this country, with the al- 
moft total cxclufion of cottagers from the farms, obliged a 
number of families to take up their refidence in the towns 
and villages. The pradice of fmuggling, too, which, for a 
number of years, was carried on to a confiderable extent on 
this coaft, contributed, in no fmall degree, to the increafe of 
the town of Girvan. 

ProduBio7iSj i^c — The number of trees is very fmall. 
There is fcarcely any natural wood better than brulb-wood. 
A few trees have been planted in the low part of the parifli, 
and in ftieltered fituations have grown tolerably well. It is 
believed, that on many parts of the high grounds, trees might 
be reared with fuccefs and advantage. All the low part of 
the parifli is capable of bearing grain ; and, with the exception 
of a few enclofures near the ftiore, has been chiefly employ- 
ed for that purpofe. Confiderable advances have been made, 
within thefe 30 years, in the improvement of agriculture. 
The low lands have been almoft wholly enclofed. By the 
proper ufe of lime, marl, and fea-weed, together with a more 
regular rotation of crops, the produce, both in quantity and 
quality, has been, to a great degree encreafed. Oats, barley, 
bear, peafe, beans, and potatoes, are the only kinds of crops 
commonly raifed. A fmaU quantity of wheat and rye is oc- 

cafionally 



I 



Of Girvan, 341 

cafionally fown ; but the former is thought an uncertain crop, 
and the latter is found profitable only wlien the foil is ex- 
tremely light and fandy. On one farm, feveral a^res of tur- 
nips are annually raifed with good fuccefs. The kind of 
plough moft commonly ufed, is one with an Englifh mould- 
board, and a Scotch fock. Even in the hilly part of the pa- 
rilh, they have begun to cultivate fuch fpots of land as are 
capable of it. For the moft part, lime is ufed as their ma- 
nure. In fome places the furface is pared and burnt, and the ■ 
ground manured with the afhes. In general, however^ the 
difadvantages of the climate, together with the want of fliel- 
ter and enclofures, render the crop?, in this part of the parifb, 
both fcanty and precarious. The high grounds are, therefore, 
chiefly employed in the pafture of cattle and flieep. The 
greater part of them is indeed capable of being ufed in no 
other way. There are about 1700 head of cattle in the pa- 
rifli. Though, occafionally, there may be lingle inftances of 
their rifing to a great fize *, yet the cattle, in general, are ra- 
ther fmall. In fome parts of the parilh they are completely 
fatted ; but the bulk of them are fold for the purpofe of be- 
ing driven to England. In the low pafture grounds, the 
grafs is remarkably rich. A fingle acre is fometimes more 
than fufficient to fatten an ox or cow of moderate fize. There 
are about 214 fcores of flieep. Except a very few of the 
mixed breed between Scotch and Englifli, they are all of the 
fmall black-faced kind common in this country. Attention is 
paid by almoft all the farmers to the improvement of the kind 
they already poflefs j but no attempts have been yet made to 
introduce a diflferent breed. 

The property of this parifh is very unequally divided a- 

mong 

* An ox bred by Mr. Kennedy of Dunure, on his farm in this parifh, was 
killed when 6 years old ; the beef and tallow of which, together, weighed 61 
ftone 8 pound, reckoning a4 pound Englifli to the Itone.

mong 10 different heritors. One only of them refides. Mr. 
Hamilton of Bargeny, is proprietor of the town of Girvan, 
and of by far the greatell part of the country parifli. There 
is a fpot of ground among the hills, fuppofed to be above 30 
acres in extent, which may be confidered as a kind of com- 
mon. It has never, in the memory of man, been claimed or 
poflefled by any individual; but is padured in common by the 
tenants of thofe proprietors who have land in its immediate 
neighbourhood. In confequence of the improvements in agri- 
culture, the advance in the price of cattle and fheep, and the 
increafe of the town of Girvan, the rent of land in this pa- 
rifli has, within thefe 40 years, been very confiderably ad- 
vanced. At prefent (1791) the rents of the whole may be 
Hated at about 3200 1., and, when fome old leafes are out, they 
will amount to a good deal more. Its valued rent is 4621 1. 
4s. 10 d. Scots. With the exception of a few, whofe leafes are 
of an old date, the tenants pay their whole rent in money. 
In fome inftances, they are bound to lead coals to their land- 
lords, or to pay a certain fum -for this purpofe. 

Mtiquities.^Thcxt are, in this parifti, 5 of thofe fmaU 
round enclofures on the tops of rifmg grounds, which arc 
commonly called camps. Two of them are very near the 
fea-fide, and none of them more than 2 miles from the coaft. 
One of thefe is remarkable for having 2 ditches, the i pa- 
rallel to the other, and each furrounding the hill on the top 

of whiah it is fituated *. v 7 r a-^r

Ecclefiaflical State, Stipend, Schools, Poor The in- 
habitants of this parifli belong almoft wholly to the Efta- 
bliftied Church. There are not more than 20 Seceders, and 
only 2 Roman Catholics. The King is patron. By the laft 
decreet, given in the year 1666, the minifter's ftipend is fix- 
ed at 57 bolls 12| pecks of meal, paid at the rate of eight 
ftone and an half the boll ; 31 bolls 8 pecks of bear ; 1 boll 
4 pecks of oats with 369 1. 4 s. 8 d. Scots, of money. He 
has alfo a manfe and glebe, which mzy be valued at 12 1. or 

I J 1. There is one eilabliflied fchoolmaftcr, who refides in 

the town of Girvan. He has, at an average, about 50 fcho- 
lars. Of thefe, 30 are taught Englifh, at the rate of 2s. a- 
quarter; 16 are taught writing and arithmetic, at the rate of 
as. 6d. ; and 4 are taught Latin at 3 s. Thefe wages, and 
100 1. Scots of falary, with his emoluments as feflion-clerk 
and precentor, render bis place worth about 30 1, a-year. A 
number of private fchools are alfo occalionally kept, both in 
the town and the diftant parts of the parifli. — The poor's 
funds of this parilh are wholly under the management of the 
kirk.felfion. They arife from the intereft of 163 1. of Hock, 
from voluntary contributions, and from penalties received 
■ from thofe who fubjeft themfelves to the difcipHne of the 
church. From the accounts for 5 years preceding January 
1791, it appears, that the fum of 41 1. Sterling has, at an 
average, been annually received j that during the fame pe- 
riod, the fum of 38 1. has, at an average, been annually dif- 
tributed ; and that in thefe years, the average number of

In the town of Girvan, there is a whin-ftone of a dark fea-green colour,

Concerning this ftone, tradition fays, that in former times, when a perlon got 
his foot on it, he could not be attached for debt. From time immemorial, it 
lias kin behind fome hcufes, which, with their yard*, formerly belonged to the 
church.

thofe who were regillarly on the poor's roll, amounted td 
36, befides a number of others to whom occafional affiftance 
was given. It is to be obferved, that out of the above fum, 
received chiefly on account of the poor, between 2 1. and 3 1. 
are annually given to the prcfbytery and feflion-clerks, the 
precentor, and kirk-officer. 

'Tovin of Girvan.'— The town of Girvan is fituated at the 
mouth of the river bearing that name. It is a poft town, 
and lies on the great road between Ayr and Port Patrick *. 
The town of Girvan poflefles many advantages lor trade and 
mannfaftures. In the neighbourhood of a plentiful corn 
country j with abundance of coal within 2 or 3 miles, and 
probably much nearer, it enjoys in fufficient quantity, all the 
neceffaries of life. Standing very near the fea, and built on 
a dry fandy foil ; its fituation is remarkably healthy. Its 
harbour, far from being now a bad onej is capable of much 
improvement. In its prefent natural ftate, the entrance into 
the harbour isj at high water, from 9 to 11 feet deep ; and 
were a key to be built, which, it is faid, might be done for 
200 ol. or 3000 1., it would be rendered confiderably deeper.

* This town is a burgh of barony. A charter of ereftion was originally 
granted to Thomas Boyd, Efq. proprietor of the lands o&amp;Ballochtoul, on which 
the town is chiefly built. This charter was afterward renewed by King Wil- 
liam to Sir Archibald Muir of Thornton, in the year 1696. The powers and 
privileges granted by it to the proprietor of Ballochtoul, were regularly carried 
down, in all the fubfequent charters and Inveftitures, from the Crdwn. Thefe 
powers were, however, never ufed ; till, in confequence of the^ great increafe 
of the town, Mr. Hamilton of Bargeny, the prefent proprietor, thought of exer- 
cifmg them. Accordingly, in the year 1785, the town of Girvan did, by his 
direftion, alTume the form of a burgh of barony. It is governed by 2 baiUes, 
and a council of. 10. The bailies are annuaUy chofen by the council, and the 
vacancies of the council are filled up by themfelves. But the fuperior has a ne- 
gative upon both eledions. The town, by its charter, enjoys all the liberties 
and privileges belonging to other burghs of the fame kind.

The furge never rifes here to any very great height ; and fo 
happily is the harbour fituated, that velTels can get out to fea 
with a wind from alraoft any quarter, if it does not blow very 
hard. With fuch advantages, any kind of trade, and efpecially 
the coal- trade, might, with good profped of fuccefs, be carried 
on. Hitherto, however, little or nothing has been done in 
this way. There is at prefent, no more than one veffel above 
ao tons burden, belonging to this place, or trading to it. The 
reft are all Vmall, open, or half-decked boats, ufed for run- 
ning fait from Ireland, or freighting goods from one part of 
the coaft to another. Nor, till very lately, was there any 
thing deferving the name of manufadture to be found in Gir- 
van. The weaving of cotton-cloth has of laie been intro- 
duced by the manufadurers of Glafgow. Upwards of lOO 
looms are now employed, and the bufinefs is extending every 
day. That a fituation fo advantageous for trade or manu- 
fadures ftiould have been fo long neglefted, may appear fur- 
priiing ; but may perhaps be in fome degree accounted for by 
obferving, that Girvan is placed at a confiderable diftance 
from any great trading or manufadluring town ; that no per- 
fon bred to bufinefs, and at the fame time poffeffing a good 
capital, ever happened to fettle here, or in the neighbour- 
hood ; and that habits of regular induftry were probably pre-, 
vented or deftroyed by the praftice of fmuggling, to which 
the inhabitants were, for a long time, fo much addi£ted. 
There is reafon, however, to hope, that if trade and manu- 
factures continue to flourifli in the country, in general, Gir- 
van will, in a fliort time, acquire that fliare in them, to 
which, from its natural advantages, it ap|)ear3 to be entitled.

hot above an 'hour under the horizon, at midnight, and not 
longer above at mid-day in the depth of winter." At prefent 
the variation of the compafs is al points W. On the weft fide!' 
bf the parifti, it is high water at 9 oVlock on the full and 
Change of the moon, but on the eaft fide it is an hour and 
a quarter later. The names of mci(l places in this pariflx 
are from the Norwegian language, and are expreffive of their 
lituation. Some fancy NorthmaVen to fignify North Main^ 
or north part of the Mainland ; others, that as the neck of 
land which is the entrance td the parilb, is called Maven, and 
• the whole parifh lying to the N. of it, that it has thence 
its name: This parifti is a peninfula, and the ifthmus whicU 
Conne6ts it to the Mainland or parilh of Ddting, is from 
high water- matk on one nde, to the fame on the other, near 
loo yards, and fo low, that with high fpring-tides^ the water 
nearly covers it; On each fide of the ifthmus, the hills life

Jiuted miles from S. to N., and from E. to W. 8 miles, bur. 
of meafured miles it would be many more. Its Ibotes art 
very uneven, being interfered with numerous inlets of the

the ifland of Pnpa and Sannefs parirti. The cultivated lands 
or farms, called here Rooms, are fmall fcattered fpots, lying 
near tht fea fliore, and round the bays. They bear a very 
fmall proportion to the hills and pafture ground. The figure 
of the parifli approaches neareft; to a triangle, but with many 
irregularities. The climate is mild, equal, and temperate; the 
air pure and healthy in all feafons. The winters are milder 
than perhaps in any other part of Britain, being tempered by 
the circumambient ocean. The heats of fummer are lefs, for 
the lame reafon. High and fudden winds are frequent. The 
aurora borealis, in the winter, often covers the whole hemif- 
phere, making a Very brilliant appearance, and of different co- 
lours : It generally has a ftrong tremulous motion from 
end to end. The higheft: hill in this country, is on the W. 
fide of this parifti, called Rona's hill, and extends from the 
middle to the N. end of the parifh j being 8 miles long, 4 
broad, and near |ths of a mile perpendicular height. It was 
found by geometrical menfuration to be 3944 feet above the 
level of the fea. From the fummit of the hill, is exhibited 
an extenfive, noble, and pleafmg profpeft, 56 miles at leaft, 
- in every diveaion, having the ocean for an horizon. The nu- 
merous iflands fcattered beneath, and curioufty interfeaed by 
the fea, and often a diftant view of veflTels which frequent thefe, 
coafts in the fummer feafon, afford a profpea infinitely diver- 
fified and agreeable. On the higheft eminence, there is an 
houfe eonftruaed of 4 large ftones, and 2 covering the top for 
a roof, under which 6 or 7 perfons may fit. It is called the 
Watch Houfe, and was probably ufed, in ancient times, to 
give notice of the enemy, of any approaching danger; a 
pyramidal tower of fmall ftones is ereaed on the top of 
it. This hill is a landmark to the fiftiers all round the 
country j and generally the firft land feen by fhips, if they

Hands, Holms, Rocks.-T\i\s parifla is bordered all around 
^/.th fmall iflands, holms, and rocks, or pillars near the fliore. 
There is only one inhabited ifland called Lamba, on the E. 
fide, poffeffed by one family ; it has but little corn land, but 
can graze a few cattle and flieep. At the S. end, and on the 
W. fide, near the entrance into the parifli, lies EagleOiey, an 
excellent ifiand for grazing, and in it, are many rabbits. N. 
of this lie 2 iflands, Nibon and Gunifter, and, like the for- 
mer, graze cattle and flieep. From this, there is a long range 
of rocks, holms, and iflands, to the N. end of the parifli. 
The mofl: remarkable are, a rock rifing perpendicular on all 
iides to a great height above the furface of the fea, and at a 
few miles diftance, has the appearance of a fliip with all her 
fails fet. It makes a good diredion for veflels coming into 
Hillfwick harbour, keeping to the E. of that rock, and half 
way from the fliore. Near to this, are a very high pillars, 
on which the larger kind of cormorants nefl;le ; and what is 
remarkable, only fucceffively, for the rock that is poflefl"ed 
by them one year, is deferted the next, and returned to again 
after being a year unpofleflTed. In this manner have thefe 
rocks been occupied time immemorial. Both rocks are in-

of rain, render travelling difficult, having no proper bridges. There are many

liielter. The new fledged young, are much efteemed, as de- 
licate food, and taken in great plenty. To the northward of 
this is a rock, the fummit of which, has never been trodden by 
inan, and is called the Maiden Skerrie. In the fumraer feafori 
it is occupied by the largeft or black-backed gulls, who neflle 
On it undifturbed. About 2 miles from this fliore, there is a 
large and high rock called Ocean Sherry j it is a good direc- 
tion for fliips from the N., if wanting an harbour. Under it 
our fifliing boats, with eafterlj wind, are happy to reach s. 
|)lace, which will give ther» leave to reft upon their oars. On 
the N, end of Rona's hill^ is the ifland of Uya, efteemed the 
inoft valuable, far feeding cattle or Iheep, of any belonging 
to this parifh. The northmoft point of the parifli is a fmall 
peninfula, enclofed by a ftone fence, called Fetheland ; about 
3 miles thence, there are high rocks called Ramnaftacks. On 
the E. fide of the parifli, going from N. to S. are the holms 
of Ifljelter, Stourholm, and the holtos of S'kea, with Glufs 
i'fl.ind. 

Barhouts and Fjjfnng Stations — On the S. fide of the pa- 
riih is a fpacious bay, called Sc. Magnus Bay, which leads to 
the harbour and creek of Hillfwick, where there is fafe and 
excellent anchorage, for any number of veflTels, or of any 
bui thpn ; having good moorings from 7 10 20 fathoms water.

Here Is a large and commodious beach for drying fifh, wit^ 
good warehoufes, and falf, and fifli cellars, and every other 
neceffary accommodation. From this creek, all the ftlh caught » 
in the parifli are loaded for exportation. A little dittance 
from this, is an inlet called Hammerfvoe, a fecure retreat for 
fhips in the moft tempeftuons weather. The moil wefterly 
point of this parifti is Stennefs, an excellent ftation for fiOi- 
ing, with an extenfive beach, and a warehoufe built for the 
conveniency of the fifliing. Here, there are from 40 to 50 
boats from this and the neighbouring parifties during the fitli- 
jng feafon. A little further N. there is a fmall bay called 
Hamnavoe, a fafe harbour for fffiall veffels, the entry into 
it being narrow j and here alfo is another fifhing ftation for 
12 or 15 boats, with fuitable cqnyeniencies. Still further 
N. on the S. fide of Rona's hill, is a bay called Rona's Voe, 
running up into the land 6 miles, a large and fafe harbour ; 
pnd here alfo is a fiihing ftation for 4 or 5 boats. On the 
fide of the hill, is a ftation for 14 boats. It is called Uya. 
The fifti caught h?re are carried frefti to Fetheland, as there 
is no beach at this place. The reafon of this ftation being 
phofen, is its vicinity to the fiftiing grounds. From this to 
S mdvoe, a bay runs up 4 mileg, which is a very good har.. 
bour. From this Voe, j boats fail to the fame fifhing grounds 
as the boats from Uya. Fetheland, the northmoft extremity, 
is a chief filhing ftation, frequented by about 60 boats. From 
this and the pariflies of Yell and Delting, is a road only for 
large boats, and fmall floops in fummer. A fliort diftancc 
from this, on the E. fide, is Burravoe, a tolerable harbour; 
but in the middle of the entrance, there is a fl.it broad rock, 
only feen at low water, which makes it a pilot's fare way. 
Here alfo is an excellent beach and ftorehoufe. Of late, the 
proprietor has built a convenient pier for boats landing their 
^(h, and drained a loch at the back of the beach. He applied

for making this harbour a creek, that he might get his fi(h 
fliipped under the infpeaion of the cultomhouf; officers ; but 
it not being granted, is obliged to carry his fi(h to Hillfwick, 
round Rona's hill, the molt dangerous navigation on this 
coaft, at much expenfe and rilk. South of this, are Col- 
lofirth and Quefirth voes, both good harbours, as alfo Glus 
voe. On the S. end, there is a long inlet of 6 miles, called 
Salum voe, a fine road for fhips, and could keep a great 
DHvj. There are feveral other fmaller harbours, but not fo 
fafe or fo much frequented as tliofe now mentioned. 

Payments, Burthens, &amp;c. — The cultivated lands in this 
parifh, as well af in all Shetland, are fcattered fpots, environ- 
ed either by deep moffes, or by thin bare grounds, whereof 
the mofs has been cut for peats, or by fteep hills covered 
with heath and naked rocks. Thefe fpots are called Rooms, 
■which have, at an early period, been divided into merks, 
but not equally. The value of each merk, being afcertain- 
ed by the number of pennies of rent it is denominated by. 
So each merk of land is deemed to contain fo many penny 
lands, from i 2 to 4 penny land the merk. Each penny land 
is uniformly valued at if merk weight of butter ; and the 
money having come in place of the wadmale (being a courfe 
kind of cloth manufaftured in thefe ifles) is. and fs. Scots 
of rent payable to the proprietor ; that quantity of butter 
being originally held of equal value to this fum of if s. Scots; 
fo that lands efteemed as 12 penny lands, paid of land rent 
yearly, 16 merks of butter, and 16 s. Scots, which taken 
together, was originally equal in value to 32s. Scots. 10 
penny, 9 penny, 8 penny, 6 penny, and 4 penny land, paid 
in the fame proportion to the landlords ; who, in procefs of 
time, laid on their tenants, by way of fine or entry, an an- 
nual fum of 8s. Scots, for each merk of land, without re-

garding the penny rents ; and this is called the graffum. Be- 
fides the payment of land rent to the proprietors of the lands, 
the poffeffors pay a tax called Scatt, which was anciently the 
revenue of the Kings of Denmark ; and fince this country 
being annexed to the Crown of Scotland, has been paid to 
the Crown or its grantees. There is another payment exaft- 
ed by the grantees of the Crown, called ox and ftieep money, 
which is faid to have been introduced by the Earls of Ork- 
ney, when they lorded it over this country. 

In the year i6oc, Patrick Earl of Orkney, built the caftle 
of Scalloway; among the exaclions made by him for carrying 
on this building, one wa$, his compelling the inhabitants t&amp; 
•deliver a certain number of oxen and llieep yearly for the 
ufe of his table. It is faid, that he demanded 24 flieep and 
a oxen from each pariQi, which oxen and ftieep were afters 
ward converted into a yearly money-payment on the lands 
in each parifti. Another payment exafted by the grantees 
of the Crown, is called the Watile. In the beginning of the 
16th century, when Po'^.ery blinded mankind, the priefts 
begged from thefe iflands, money under he name of Wattle, 
in confideration of the extraordinary benefit which the peo- 
pie were to receive from the liberal diftribtition of holy wa- 
ter among them^ Another payment is the cefs, or land-tax j 
and as the lands of thefe iflands pay fcatt, or a land-tax pecu- 
liar to themfelves, it was, after fome flruggle, that the pay- 
ment of cefs took place in Shetland. Beiides the above pay- 
ments, the tenants pay corn-tiend : In this pariih the one 
half to Sir Thomas Dundas, the other half to the incumbent, 
according to ufe and wont. Befides, to the incumbent is paid 
cow and flieep ticnd, and a compolition of i 5 lings for every 
6 oared boaty and 10 for every 4 oared boat. Further, the 
tenant pays to the proprietor an hen and cock for every :^ 
jnerks land, and 3 days work to the proprietor and as many

to the minifter, being maintained during that time. Bcfides, 
the tenant engages to fit out, at his own expenfe, a certain Ihare 
of a boat to the ling fidiing, which is proportioned to the va- 
lue or number of mprks of land. Alfo, to fell his fifti at a 
certain ftipulated or underftood price to the landlord, and to 
nsake the firft ofTer of all his other produfts to him, prefer- 
able to all others. An annual falary of about ill. Sterling 
to the parochial fchoolmaftcr, concludes the payments and 
burthens in this pari(h. 

Agriculture. — The foil, from our northern and infular fitu- 
ption, rather unfavourable for vegetation, muft be confiJer- 
ably barren. The beft crop of black oats and bear being the 
only grain which the foil will nourifh, is never fufficien^ 
for the inhabitants 9 months in the year ; and often when 
the feafons are unfavourable, not fufficient to maintain them 
4 months, though their allowance of bread is by far lefs than 
in any other part of Great Britain. Their Miing is the prin- 
cipal, if not the only refource, to enable them to provide the 
neceffaries of life, which renders their fupply very precarious. 
To the particular account of the ftate of agriculture in the 
neighbouring parifli of Pelting, very little needs be added, 
being the fame as here. About the year 1750, potatoes be- 
gan to be planted, ajid have proved of great advantage to the 
inhabitants, being an early food in harveft, when bread is al- 
moft not to be had, and very coniforiable with their fmali 
fi(h, of which, then, they have ufually plenty. That great 
improvements might be made in their mode of farming, is not 
to be doubted ; but it may be a queftion if the country is ca- 
pable of yielding an increafe fufficient for their fupport. 

It feems better adapted for pafture, and carrying on the 
fifhing. The predikaion and fpirit of the people for the lat- 
ter ha-^ rendered them quite carelefs as to the former. Could

they tje perfiiadcd to keep {heph(irds, and the fhepherd to be 
J,aid out of the flock, it is not to fay what ata increafe might 
be in this pariai in a few years, as the paftures are very ex- 
tenfive, and yet the flieep fewer in number than in other pa- 
rilhes. In the winter, the Iheep and hotfe feed on fea-Weed, 
and endure all the rigour of the feafon without any fhelter. 

The number of ploughs has been decreafing in this panfh 
for many years. At this time there are about 26 ploughs j 
the ground is moftly digged, or turned up with fpades. The 
bats are fown, and the kail and potatoes planted in the month 
of April, and from the beginning to the middle of May the 
bear-feed is fown. The harveft is between the firft of Sep- 
tember and firft of November. The rentalled lands of this- 
par ifti amount to 1 1 45 merk land ; befldes, there are about 
100 outfets, or new improvements, commonly eftimated at 3 
merks each, and pay the landlord accordingly ; but are ex- 
empted from paying fcatt, cefs, or corn-tiend. Including 
thefe improvements with the rentalled lands, all will bear but 
a fmall proportion to the hills and pafture grounds. Every 
room or rooms contiguous to each other, are enclofed with 
turf-fences. There is not one farm or houfe at prefent unpof- 
feffed or uninhabited. 

Population. — According to Dr. Webfter's report, the num- 
ber of fouls in 1755 was 1009. The population here has 
been increafing fince the year 1760, owing to the fplitting of 
farms and breaking out new grounds. This was promoted 
by the landlords for increafing the number of fiQiers. In the 
year 1768, the prefent miniller of the parifli, upon his firft vi- 
fitation of families, took a lift of all examinable perfons^ 
which was obtained with difficulty, owing to the prejudices 
of the people. He found then 1 109 examinable perfons. In 
the following vifitations the number was iucreafing, and the

He, in the year 1777, took an exaft lift of perfons of every

1657, and in the year 1792, to the number of 1786, of which

Church, Stipend, School, Poor. — Sir Thomas Dundas is pa- 
tron of this parifli. All the inliabitants are of the Eftabliftied 
Church of Scotland. Tliere have been two churches in this 
parifli, each of them near to the middle of it, one on the E. 
and the other on the W. fide. The former has been in ruins 
fince the year 1761. The latter, at Hillfwick, is now the 
only place of public worlhip. The prefent incumbent, be-

preaches 3 or 4 times a-year at the north, and moft diftant

marriages yearly. The baptifm regifter cannot be regularly kept, on account 
if the many private baptifms, in which they muft be indulged, becaufe of their

lue of the ftipend cannot be afcertained, being paid in kind, 
which renders it very variable. The glebe is fituated in 4 
different places, each 3 miles diftant from the manfe, and 3 
merks land, which are contiguous thereto— A legal fchool 
was eftabliilied here in 1773, with a falary of 197 merks 8 s. 
9 pennies Scots, raifed by 2s. 3d. Scots on the merk land. The 
ufual number of boys at this fchool was from 20 to 25. At 
prefent they are only 1-4. There has not yet been a charity 
fchool in this parifh. It is not to be doubted, if a proper re- 
prefentation was laid before the Society for Propagating 
Chriftian Knowledge, that, they would readily grant one for 
fuch an extenfive parilh as this. 

There are commonly from 14 to 18 poor on the parochid 
roil, each of "whom are ftationed on a certain number of fami/* 
lies in a corner, who maintain them as many days and nights 
as tiiey have merks of land. They will make 3 or 4 rota- 
tions yearly in that corner. The weekly collections may a- 
mount y-early to 5 1. Sterling ; and the coUedtions on facra- 
mental occafions to 10 1. Sterling. From thefe colleftions, 
the above ftated poor, receive from 5 s. to 10 s. for clothes, 
and from 8 s. to 1 2 s for expenfe of burial *.

tliere arc commonly oh the lift one or two infants, who have loft their parents,

yearly until they arrive at 10 years of age. After which time, they are treat-

Employment of the Inhabitants.— Tht women look af^ci- 
domeftic concerns, biing up their children, cook the victuals, 
look after the cattle, fpin, and knit (lockings j they alfo al- 
fift, and are no lefs laborious then the men in manuring imd 
labouring the grounds, reaping the harveft, and manutaaur- 
ing their crop. The children are taught very early to be 
helpful in the affairs of the houfc ; many of the young wo- 
men are employed in May and Auguft in cutting fea-weed 
for kelp. The boys are early employed in fifhing. The pro- 
-vince of the men is managing their fmall farms, the fifhing, 
boat building, and cutting their peats, which are their only 
,fnel ; befides, they are generally tailor, fhoemaker, weaver, 
&amp;c. to their own family, and many are fmith and wright. 
There are only 3 perfons in this parilh who make their liv- 
ing by their trade alone ; two wrights and one ilioemaker. 

In 

mily, or perfon, the ordinary metlsod for their fupply is, to reprefent their ftate 
from the pulpit, with fuitable exhortations, and appoint a day for a colledtion to 
be made for their account. It is common to receive from 2 1. to 5 1. Sterling on 
fuch occaCons. From this account, it is obvious, that in times of general cala- 
mity, little more can be done by the kirk-fefiion, or by the inhabitants of this 
parilh. From the year 17S2, the crops failed, and a great death prevailed a- 
mong the horned cattle and flieep, fo that thefe iflands, during that periou, were 
in very great diftrefs, and many muft have perifiied from want, if they had not 
received feafonable and large fupplies. In the year 17S3, they fliared in the 
fupply given by Government to the northern counties of Scotland. In 17S4, a 
coiiliderable fupply was fent them by a vote of the Houfe of Commons. In the 
following years, Thomas Parker, Efq. of Hull, and Alexander Alifon.Efq. De- 
puty Cafliier of Excife at Edinburgh, fet on foot fubfcriptions for their reUef: 
The former coUeifled 30S 1. 16 s.; and the latter 1049 1. S s. 7 d. both which

loft at fea, which left many families in the greateft diftrefs. An early account 
of this reaching Edinburgh coUcdlions were made for them there, and the poor 
widows and orphans huve, at three diflerent times, received of this liberality^,

In this northern climate, more attention, care, and toil, muft 
be given to procure a bare'fubfiftence, then a comfortable one, 
with fome fuperfluities, where the earth yields a more certaia 
and plentiful increafe. When floth or mifmanagement pre- 
vail in the managers of a family, want and famine for a great

Of the Fi/bi;ig.— About the end of laft, and beginning of 
this century, the Hollanders reforted to this country to pur, 
phafe fiQi of the natives.  They paid a gratuity annually for 
this privilege to the proprietors. In May they arrived with 
their veffels, and fupplied the natives with the neceffaries for 
their families and fiftung apparatus. They received the fifh 
frefc, which, after being faked and dried, and having made 
an agreement with the proprietors for the next year's pro- 
duce, returned with their cargoes *. It is ufual for every 

Hcipper 

* Tu this day, it is common to point out the Dutchmen's lodges and beaches 
in the feveral parts of the parifh. About the year 171a, the proprietors of land 
took the fifhing under their management, when the debenture and regulations 
refpefling duties on fait were paffed. Then the landlords appointed fiilierracn, 
imported fait, and all fifl:ing neceffaries, and freighted veffels for exporting their 
filli, which then, and for feveral years afterward, were fent to Hamburgh. The 
landlords receive their filb at a ftipulated price. From that period, to the year 
I740, the fifliing was not diftant from the lliore above 8 or 10 miles, carried on 
in four oared boats, with few lines ; fo that the quantity then caught was few, 
compared to the numbers now. But thofe few were more profitable to the filh- 
er; and, in confequence, they then lived comfortably, and indebted to none. A- 
bout 1740, the boats increafed much in number, which induced them to feekout 
further to fea, to avoid their lines entangling, when crowded along fliore. Find- 
ing anew bank, they enlarged their boats, and increafed their number of lines, 
till they gradually arrived to the prefent ftate. The proprietors now purchafe 
their fi(h by weight. The fiflier, on an average, has 4d. each ling. But it mult

and hlhing tackling in order. Each boat carries from loo to 
»2o lines, of 50 fathoms length ; each line having 10 hooks, 
placed 5 fathoms from each other* on a cord 4 foot long. A 
boat's lines will extend 6000 fathoms, or about 6 miles and 
an half when laid in the fea. - Each boat has alfo 4 haddock 
lines fitted ; their firft work is to obtain proper bait, and this 
Js their employment every evening and morning they are 
afliore, as they wilh always to have freOi bait. Haddocks are 
mofl efleemed, of which it will take 6 or 7 fcore for the lines 
of one boat. Piltocks are next valued, of which it requires 
25 or 30 fcore ; failing of thefe, hallibut, cod, tufk. or ling, 
•are ufed for bait. They fet out to fea, when weather perl 
mits. from 10 o'clock A. M. to 2 o^clock P. M. according to 
the filhing ground they intend to vifit, being from 10 to 40 
miles diftant from the fliore. When arrived there, about 6 
or 7 o'clock at night, the ift end of the lini is funk by a 
ftone of 24 pounds weight ; then a or 4 men pull to feaward; 
the remainder fet out the lines, and fix pieces of bait pro- 
perly cut, on every hook ; and at the diltance of every two 
lines, are ftones fixed about 8 pound weight ; and, at the 
other end of the line, a large ftone as at the firft. There are 
buoys at each end of the line, made of flieep Ikin, and 2 
mid-buoys, for finding the lines, leaft they break while haul- 
ing. Every line for the buoy, is 120 fathoms and more. The 
Jmes being joined together, fo as to form a long train, the 
boat keeps clofe by the bupy laft dropped, for 2 or 3 hours, 
according to the tide and weather. When they begin to haul

br take in their lines, every fifti, as brought into the boat, 
they cut off the heads, and throw them into an apartment by 
themfelves, then take out the guts and entrails. It feme- 
times happens, that they cannot carry their draught with 
fafety to the Ihore ; in which cafe, they firit throw the heads, 
Ikate, hallibut, tufk, cod, and fometimes ling. Boats have 
taken afliore 20 fcore lings ; 12 or 14 fcore, with cod and tulk, 
is efteemed a great haul j 5 or 6 fcore is efteemed a medium. 
In moderate weather, they commonly reach their landmg 
place, from la noon to 4 P. M. They have been known to 
be out 3 days and 3 nights. All the ftores they ever carry 
■with them, is an half anker filled with the drink called Blan- 
da, a cake of bread to each man, and a bottle Geneva. The 
fifhing ends the 15th Auguft. Old men and boys are em- 
ployed at the fifhing ftation for curing the fifli. The old men 
cut out the back bone, after which the boys wafli the fifli in 
the fea, bring them again to the old men, who fait them ia 
tubs or vats for the purpofe^ where they lie a competent 
time foaking in brine. When taken out of thefe vats, they 
muft be carefully walhed with a broom in fait water. They 
are then laid in heaps for a day or two, and then, at proper 
intervals, expofed to the fun, till perfedly dried, taking care 
gradually to increafe the piles or fliples into which they are 
built as they harden. In this way, they are kept on the 
beach for 6, 8, or 10 weeks until cellared or fhipped*.

* A committee of Parliament in 1786, declared, that the beft means of im- 
proving the fiflieries, was to encourage the inhabitants living neareft the feat of 
them to become filhers. What defcription of men, then, can have a better title 
than the poor inhabitants of this parifli ? Who fliould be more encouraged, or 
fuitably rewarded, than a ftout, hardy, and laborious race of men, who have a 
prediledlion for the employment of fifhing, above all other purfuits, though none 
attended with liiore fatigue and danger, or hitherto rewarded fo meanly ? The fifh-

Some time aftet the white fifliing is ended, it generally 
happens that herring crowd into our bays and voes, on the

employed during the night in catching herrings, and old mea 
and boys in the day time in caring them. The herring com- 
nlonly leave the coaft in November. From the above, it is 
obvious that there cannot be a more laborious and induftri-

a profpecft of profit. The landlords fay, that the tenant pays but half rent for 
]iis lands, and every neceffary for the fifliing provided firft by them. But not to 
enter farther into the caufe, although the prefent practice may have advantages 
equal to its difadvantages, yet the appearance of a monopoly is a circumftance, 
which feldbm fails to be confidered as a grievance. This connexion betweeR 
proprietors and tenants, has often been the origin of difputes, between proprietors 
and others,- as interlopers, and trafficking with their tenants and fifliers. A 
friendly and benevolent behaviour towards their tenants, is a charadleriftic that 
will apply, in general, to proprietors in this country ; but their granting no leafes, 
if much againft improvements, and keeps the tenants in conftant dependence. 

* The bays afford gre'at plenty of fliell-fifli, fuch os oyfters, cockles, mufclcs^ 
fpouts, &amp;c. Thefe, in time of general fcarcity, have often proved a great re- 
lief to poor families. It may be obferved, alfo, that fometimes there are vaft 
fhoals of fmaU whales. When feen near the fhore, all the people around afljem- 
ble, and with their boats drive them aground. Anno 1741, in the bay of Hillf- 
wick, 360 were forced a-fljore, and yielded from 2 to 4 barrels of oil each: in 
176S, ten were taken at the fame place; arid in I'ypx, above 100 were caught 
there alfo. A falfe refinement, or fenfe of delicacy, prevents the people frorfi 
making the fmallefl: ufe of the flefli of thefe fmall whales, although there is 
every reafon to think, from the frnallnefs of the fibres, and appearance of the 
flefli, that, fetting afide prejudices, it would make not indelicate food. In 1741,

i),W,,._EpIclemic difeafes prevail but feldom, owing 
.probably to our free air, and our houfes being feparated from 
■each other. The rheumatifm is a very common complaint, 
both among the poor and rich. There is a fpeciea of leprofy 
that has been more prevalent than at prefent. and of which 
we have had feveral miferable inftances in this parifli ; it iel- 
dom affefts any but the lower clafs of people. Its fymptoms 
approach nearer to thofe of elephanthiafis, than any other 
defcription. It is fuppofed to proceed from low livmg, un- 
wholefome, or ill prepared food, and living nailily. Many 
poor objefts under this difeafe have been fcnt to the infirmary 
of Edinburgh, but they either died there, or returned un- 
cured, and foon perilhed miferable fpedacles of wretchednefs. 
This difeafe does not feem to be infedious ; but in many in- 
ftances there is reafon to fufped an hereditary taint. The 
fufFerers are, however, always fet apart, and prpvided for, and 
fupplied by the parilli. When taken early, there are in- 
ftances of its being cured. Convulfions were once very com- 
mon in this parifti, efpecially during the time of divine fer- 
vice ; but are now quite extinft. The cure is attributed to 
a rough fellow of a kirk-officer, who toffed a woman in that 
ftate, with whom he was often plagued, into a ditch full of 
water. She was never known to have it afterward ; and Q- 
Ihcrs dreaded the like treatment. The fmall pox hetetofore 
proved extremely fatal. Moft of the old people in this pa- 
rifh, date their age from fuch a year before or after the mor- 
tal pox, which was in 1700. Inoculation was perfedtly ge-

privately to make afe of their flefli, and all fuch declared it to be equal to any

Taro, where thefe whales are caught annually, their flefli is much efteemed.

-Ore/}, Longevity, Stature, &amp;c.-The gentry drefs fuit 
able to their charafter, and fimilar to the faflaions in Edln- 
burgh. The lower clafs wear cloth of a coarfe quality of 
their own making. When employed in filhing, they have 
coverings of barked fkins of Hieep which they put over their 
clothes, and large wide boots. On Sabbaths, the ufe of 
cloths from Scotland or England, is becoming very frequent 
among them. The kirk-officer who died in 1791, was aged 
95- He calculated, as was ufual with old people, from the 
time of the mortal pox, viz. 1700, and afferted, that then 
he was able to run a fhort errand of a mile or two. There 
are at prefent living, 3 perfons above 90 years old, and 10 
from 80 to 86 years of age, fome of the latter flout and vi- 
gorous ; but no report nor record of any being loC years 
old. The men are generally robuft, ftrong, and tall. There 
is one man 6 feet 5 inches. There are 6 men above 6 feet, 
and many from 5 feet 8 inches to 6 feet high. The people' 
in general, are difcreet and kindly, remarkably attentive to 
ftrangers, and charitable to the needy, even fuch as are them-

.Antiquities— There is a range of watch-houfcs, fimilar to 
that defcribed on Rona's hill, and many remains of burghs, 
duns, or Pias' houfes, but none of them of remarkable mag- 
nitude, or entire. Their demolition is owing to the wafte of 
time, and ftones removed for the conftrufting of neighbouring 
buildings. The moll entire of this kind is o^ the W. fide of 
the pariflj, fituated on an holm in a loch, from which there 
has been a narrow path laid with ftones to the oppofite bank ; 
the circular wall can be traced, and fome fteps of ftairs, which 
have afcendcd circularlj in its interior. The watch-houfes 
or ward-hills are built within fight of the fea, and one or 
more within fight of each other. Befides the ufe thej might 
be of in giving an alarm in times of danger, a probable inten- 
tion of them might be, in times when ftioals of fmall whales 
were far more frequent on this coail than at prefent, to ob- 
ferve and colled the inhabitants in the vicinitj, when any 
flock of thefe appeared. They are applied to that purpofe to 
this day in the Tawe iflands. There are feveral ftupendous 
caverns made by the force of the fea ; in fome, the w^ild pi- 
geons neftle, and bting forth their young, others ferve for

After confidering the above accout, can it be doubted that 
the fituation of the tenants might be much improved by 

, 1 1 fo^«ic liv indulgence and aid trom 
granting leafes, by larger farms by mdu g ^^^^ , 

the proprietors at the beginning, to enable tne 
their farms, and make the proper improvements by a fuU a - 
furance and confidence that they were entirely free £.-om all 
reftraints in their dealings with others, when they paid their 
landlord, agreeable to contraft. Is it not alfo obvxous, that 
if 3 or 4 Ikilful farmers, and as many ftiepherds from Scot- 
land, were fettled commodloufly in the parifli, that the far- 
mers in the place would imitate their example ? For it can- 
' not be faid that they are wedded to their own praftices and 
ways; fo that a few years might make a great alteration to the 
better in their circumftances. It is clear alfo, that the te- 
nants poffeffing the larger farms, and flieep ^.aftures, lhou]4 be 
employed folely in that way, and by no means engaged m the 
fiftiing. I have heard it advanced by gentlemen well known 
in the ftate and fituation of this pariih, that it would be much 
for its advantage, if one fifli was not caught by them in feven 
years. However that be, it is not to be doubted that it would 
be of great advantage to the people that a great many of the 
tenants were confined to the improvement of their farms *:

mifmanagement, more than to weather, or any other misfortune. Since the 
year 1745, there have been 30 fifliing boats loft at fea, belonging to this parifli, 
by which many a widow and fatherlefs child have been left in the greateft dif- 
trcfs.

purfued before that which is more profitable, if the returns be at a more diftant 
period. As there fliould be many farmers who were not fiQiers ; fo it would be 
alfo of advantage that every mafter of a fifliing-boat was not a farmer. And, as 
it is faid, that fuch flxould be idle the half of their time, might they not alfo be 
employed in fpinning and making their lines and herring nets ? might they not 
alfo be carpenters, tailors, weavers, among them, but not fo as to prevent their

»TnHE parilh of Traquair confifts of the old parlfli of St- 
A Bryde, and the greateft part of the parifti of Kailzie, 
which was fuppreffed as far back as the year 1674, and part- 
ly joined to this parifti, and Innerleithen. The water of 
Quair, which has its rife, and its whole courfe in the parifla, 
has given origin to the name, which, until the annexed part 
of Kailzie was added, lay upon the flopping fides of the hills 
which fupply its current : and as the valley of a ftream is

fon of Cranfton, containing a grant of the lands of Traquair, 
&amp;c. dated at Edinburgh, anno 1409, it is fpelt Traquar. 

Extent, Situation, Surface, bV.-The greateft length of the 
parifh IS along the fouthern bank of the Tweed, which lies in 
the direaion from E. to W. between 8 and 9 miles. From 
the Tweed to the fource of Quair is from 4 to 5 miles, which 
3s Its greateft breadth in the diredion from N. E. to S. V/. 
It contains, according to Armftrong, wlio made a furvej of 
the countj about 16 years ago, 17,290 acres, about 40CO of 
^vhich are arable. The figure is very irregular, being fre- 
quently interfefted by the parifli of Yarrow. It is bounded 
on the N. by the Tweed. The general appearance of the pa- 
Tifli is hilly, rocky, and mountainous. Minchmoor, over 
which th« old road to Selkirk palies, is more than 2Coo feet 
above the fea, and Gumfcleugb, and fome other heights in the 
parifh are at leaft 200 feet above Minehmoor. The hills, in 
general, aiFord excellent pafture for Ikeep. The foil on the 
low grounds, though in general lhallow and ftony, is fertile j 
and on Tweed haughs there is a confiderable depth of loam 
depofited by the river in the courfe of ages. The fouth fides 
of the hills are generally green, while their northern expofure 
is heathy, and of a darker complexion. There are no volca- 
nic appearances in any part of the parifli, though many of the 
neighbouring mountains, according to fome theories, may be 
thought to fupport fuch an opinion, as they are piked or co- 
nical. The common whin rock, a liner kind approaching to the 
bafaltes, a coarfe fort of granite, and a confiderable quantity 
of flate are the only kind of ftones found in the parifli. The 
flate was formerly wrought in confiderable quantity, but they 
have of late rather dug at the top, than opened the quarry 
properly, and on that account the flates are found not to bear 
expofure to the air without fliivering. The noble family of

Tvaquair have made feveral attempts to difcovcr lead mines, 
and have found quantities of the ore of that metal, though not 
adequate to indemnify the expenfe of working, and have 
therefore given up the attempt. Not long fince, a fpecimea 
of the Galena ore was found in one of the Itreams which falls 
into Quair water. 

Clhnatc, Jbifeafes.—Ths. air is dry and healthy, thought 
there are no well authenticated inftances of longevity. The 
lower part of the parifti enjoys a mild and temperate air, 
though the tops of the hills are covered with fnow, and the 
attraftion of the mountains often deluges the upper part with 
rain, when almoll none of it is felt in the vallies. The clouds 
are often feen floating in the air, attracted from mountain to 
mountain, when there is funlhine below. The inhabitants 
generally enjoy good health, and are fubjeft to no epidemi- 
cal difeafes. Rheumatifm more generally prevails than any 
other diforder, which is generally denominated the pains ; the 
caufes of which, perhaps, are the poor manner of livuig, the 
badnefs and dampnefs of the houfes, the fcarcity and dearth 
of fuel, and an attachment to fifhing at night with lights, 
which is principally pradifed early m the fpring, and late in 
the autumn feafons, after the Tweed is flooded with rain. In 
fummer 1789, the fmall-pox, which, for feveral years, had 
Bot vifited. the parifli, prevailed very much, and cut off feve- 
ral children ; but though there was a great prejudice in the 
minds of the inhabitants againfl: inoculation, many of them 
were prevailed upon to inoculate their children, and all of 
them did well, the experience of which has gone far to re- 
move their former prejudices. 

Fijh, Birds, &amp;c — The river Tweed, which runs along 
the whole N. fide of the parifh, formerly produced a great

quantity of falmon, which are now but fcldom caught, e^-. 
cepting after the rJver has been flooded : it is probable, there- 
fore, that the methods employed to prevent the fifh from get- 
ting up the river, are the caufes of their decreafe. Confider- 
able quantities of trout are caught in Tweed and Qaair wa- 
ter. What is called the fea-trout is more frequently found 
in the Quair ; both the fea and burn-trout are of an excellent 
quality. They are principally diftinguiftied by the whitencfs 
and rednefs of the fifli. The trout are caught from the be- 
ginning of April to the end of September ; thej are chiefly 
taken by the net, which defl:roys angling. The king's fifl»er 
has been frequently feen on the banks of the Tweed. Large 
flights of wild geefe are frequently feen paffing from the S. to 
the N. ia the harveft feafon. The plover, fieldfare, woodcock, 
dotterel and cuckoo, are frequently feen in their feafon. The 
largeft kind of raven, and the true hunting hawk, annually 
hatch tbeir young in Glendean's banks. The fox is alfo a- 
conftant inhabitant of them. 

'Population. — According to Dr. Webfter's report, the num- 
ber of fouls in 1755 was From the beft information, 
there is reafon to believe that the parifli, about 40 years ago, 
was double in population to what it is at prefent. There were 
then 2 confiderable villages in it: the one is entirely gone; and 
a few ftraggling houfes are all that remain of the other. Farms 
now pofleflfed by one, were tl;ieu in the hands of 2, 4, and e- 
ven 6 farmers, and the number of cottagers, befides the inha- 
bitants of thefe villages, gi-eater. The number of perfons 
from 20 years old, and upward, might then amount to 400,. 
when, at prefent, there are not above 239 ; of thefe 129 are 
females, and no males. The whole fouls in the parifli at 
prefent are 446: Under 10, — 118; Under 20, — 88; 48 of 
whom are males, and 40 females ; under 50,-181 5 under 70,

diftant from him above three miles, and to return home again 
without being greatly fatigued. 

Sheep, Horfes and Cattle. The ftaple commodity of the

Lge diftrids are occupied by one farmer, feveral of whoru 
havf part of their fheep-walks mthe parifti of Yarrow, though 
their houfes are all in the parifti of Traquair. There are 98 
horfes, and about aoo head of black cattle. The value of 
wool has greatly increafed within thefe few 7^--'. ^h-gh 
they, in general, have their farms ftocked with Scotttlh black 
faced ftieep, they being reckoned better adapted thao any o- 
ther for the lands in the pari(h. 

Agriculture, Heritors, 'Tenants, tir.-The whole of the 
ploughs employed by the farmers, are the old Scottifti ploughs, 
excepting two, which are of an improved conftruftion : but 
the old plough is fuppofed to anfwer beft ; they are fome- 
times drawn by 4 horfes, generally by 2. When 2 horfes are 
employed, they are direfted by the man who holds, when 
there are 4, they are conduded by a boy. It is impofTible to 
afcertain the number of aCres employed annually in tillage. 
The principal crops in the pariOi are oats and barley. There 
is a fmall quantity of ground fown in wheat, but nothing e- 
qual to the confumption. The pariih exports confiderable quan- 
tities both of oats and barley. It is believed from good au- 
thority, that there are annually exported of the laft mention- 
ed grain 500 boUs. A fmall quantity of turnips is annually 
raifed, which anfwers very well ; and almoft every individual 
in the parifh has his crop of potatoes. Either turnips, po-

38, and a fmall fradion. Each marriage, at an average, pro- 
duces from 5 to 6 children. There are from 3 to 4 marria- 
ges annually. The union of farms is to be confidered as the 
great caufe of depopulation in this parifh. And the abfence 
of the noble family who formerly conftantly refidcd in it, and 
muft have given employment to a variety of labourers, muft 
likewife have greatly contributed. 

Stipend, Church, Manfe, Poor, &amp;c — The value of the 
living, including the glebe, is about 7 81. Sterling. The mo- 
nied ftipend is 54I. i6s. n d., and 16 bolls of oatmeal, and 
8 bolls of bear. The glebe contains about 1 1 Scots acres^ 
which, together, make the fum above fpecified. The King, 
in right of the Archbiftiop of Glafgow, is patron of the old 
parifli of St. Bryde. The Earl of Traquair was patron of 
the fuppreffed parilh of Kailzie ; but that family being Ca- 
tholic, could claim lio right in the fettlement of Traquair. 
The church was rebuilt about 9 years ago. The heritors, ia 
fpring ^790, very liberally contributed for rebuilding the 
manfe for the prefent incumbent, which is not as yet finifhed, 
iand they are likewife to rebuild part of the offices, which, 
when completed, will render the minifter's accommodation 
very comfortable.. — There are, at prefent, 10 perfons receiv-

been bedfall upwards of 23 years, able to do a good deal to-

that affluence which his genius and induftry have acquired. 
Mr. Brodie's liberality, added to the fum above mentioned 
makes the fituation of the poor very comfortable. 

ikror.7/..-Within lefs than 30 years, the people of the 
parifh have changed their character very much to the better 
They were then much addifted to drinking to excefs. There 
were at that time more than 6 alehoufes ; at prefent there i. 
only one public houfe, which is feldom, if at all frequented 
but by thofe who are tranfafting bufinefs,, or by traveUers' 
and is on thefe accounts neceffary. They are now fober, and 
induftrious, and are generous, and humane, when caUed to 
the exertion of thefe qualities, as was evidenced both in the 
dearth of 1782, and fince, to a poor widow, who was left 
with 6 children. They enjoy, in a confiderable degree, the 
comforts aui advantages of civilized life. Even the pooreft

in the parifti, are, by the generofity of Mr. Brodie, former- 
ly mentioned, furniflied with the means of having their chil- 
dren properly educated, who has^ for a confiderable time paft, 
fent annually to the fchoolmafter 5I. 5 s. for educating the 
poor children in the parifh ; which, as it furnifties the means 
of inftruftion to fuch as might either be deprived of it, or 
who might enjoy it in a more fparing manner, is a very con- 
fiderable advantage, and muft redound to the honour of the 
liberal contributor. No inftances are known of any being 
banilhed from the parifli, nor of any who have left it for mif- 
conduft of any kind. There is not one of them but what is 
g, native of Scotland. 

School. — At an average, there are 30 fcholars who may be 
taught englifti, writing, arithmetic, and book-keeping. The 
teacher can alfo teach menfuration. The greateft number of 
bis fcholars, are fuch as are learning englifli. For a country 
fchoolmafler, he has an exceeding good hand of writing, 
and teaches both arithmetic and book-keeping very well ; 
though few of his fcholars are able to attend fo long as to 
feel much benefit by his accomplifliments. The emoluments 
of his office are very fcantj'-, and no way adequate to his ufe- 
fulnefs, which, though no partial evil to that race of men, 
renders it the more to be regretted. He receives 61. from the 
heritors, 5I. 5 s. from Mr. Brodie ; the fees arifing from the 
office of feffion-clerk, annually may amount to il. 10 s. 
He has likewife a free houfe and garden. As a confiderable 
number of his fcholars are upon the charity, the fchool- 
wages are no great matter, being but a perfedt trifle a-quar- 
ter. As a precentor, he is very well qualified for his office. 
His whole emoluments can hardly exceed 20 1., and with that, 
•by great economy, he fiipports decently, a wife and 5 fmall 
children.

Antiquities and Natural Curiojlties The bufli aloon Tra- 

quair, which in former times might be a confiderable thicket 
of birch-trees, the indigenes of the foil, is now rpduced to 5 
lonely trees, which folitarily point out the fpot, where love, 
and its attendant poetry, once probably had their origin. 
Part of the houfe of Traquair is of very remote antiquity, 
was built on the bank of the Tweed, eafily defenfible from 
that fide, and might poffibly, in the days of hoftility, be pro- 
perly guarded on the other. It was in the form of a tower. 
There have been feveral other tower houfes in the parifli, one 
of which is Hill almoft entire at Cardrona. The tradition 
of the country is, that there was a continued chain of thefe 
houfes fo fituated on both fides of the Tweed, as by lights 
placed in them, intimation might be given from one to an- 
other of the approach of any foe. There are feveral places 
denominated Chefters, wherp there are evident marks ftill 
remaining of lines of circumvallation, moftly circular in their 
form, which feem rather places intended for a fecurity to 
their cattle againft fudden incurfions, th^n regular encamp- 
ments. Tradition dignifies them by the denomination of Ro- 
rnan camps. They are all conftrufled upon the top of emin- 
ences not eafily affailable, and every particular diftrift has its 
own. Their freque;ncy is perhaps the beft indication of their 
life. Glendean's banks are remarkable fpr their extent and 
precipitous elevation. They are more than half a mile in 
length, and from 200 to 3C0 feet in height, and are truly a 
tremendous cl^afm, as denominated by a certain author. 

Names of Places. — Kailie, Cardrona, Glen, Fethen, Glen- 
l\ide, Fingland, Teniel, Bold, and Quair, are probably de- 
rived from a Celtic origin. Griefton, Know, and Scrogbank, 
§£.c. are not of fo remote derivation. Griefton abounds with 
flates, and has given origin to the name, expreffiye of th^ 

colour 



Of Traquair. 379 

toiour of that ftone. Know is borrowed from its fituation 
being on a fmall elevation above the courfe of Quair , and 
name of Scrogbank is borrowed from the farms^ bcng 
partly covered with juniper buihes, and other brulh-wood 
which, in the old dialed of the country, received the gener. 
denomination of fcrogs. Though many of the places llxU 
retain their Celtic names, the language has been for many 
hundred years, perhaps, loft. The inhabitants, m general, 
fpeak the old Scottifti dialed. 

State of the Poor in 1782 and lySs—During this period 
of public calamity, the poor of the pariftx were liberally af- 
fifted. Such as were upon the poor's roll, received their 
ufual monthly allowance , befides which, accordmg to their 
neceffity, they were ferved with a proportionable quantity of 
meal, partly at the expenfe of the heritors, tenants, and kirk- 
feffion, and partly at the reduced price of 22 d. the ftone *. 

Advantages and Bif advantages. -^Th^ diftance from coals, 
is a difadvantage under which the whole of the inhabitants 
labour, and the ill repair in which the public roads are kept, 
makes the difadvantage the greater. The pariih is equally 
diftant from lime; fo that both comfortable accommodation m 
the inclemency of winter, and the improvements of agricul- 
ture, would be greatly benefited by a proper attention being 
paid' to them. It is believed, that the ftatute-work not ex- 
aded in kind, as was formerly the cafe, but demanded in 
money, would be fufficient to make proper roads through the 

3 B 2 parifti, 

« The money laid out in the parifli for relief to the poor in that period of 
fcarcity, befides the ordinary contributions, was upwards of 40 1. The pariUi 
adopted their plan of procedure at that time, from the method ufed during the- 
fcarcity of the year 1740. Since the years 1781 and I7S3, the feffion's comri- 
liutions are more than doubled.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q980084">NAIRN</name>. 

(County of Nairk, Synob or Moray, Presbytery of 

Nairn.) 

By the Rev. Mr. John Morrison.</head> 
<p>^ — ■ - - 

Name^ Extent^ Soil, and Appearance. 

THE parifli of Nairn derives its name from the river 
which runs through it, called in Gaelic, " Uifge 
Nearne," or Water of Alders, from the great quantity of 
trees and flirubs of that fpecies of wood which grows upon 
its banks. Some are of opinion that Invernearne implies the 
influx of the weftern, as Inverear, or Findhorn, does that of 
the eaftern river into the fea. From E. to W. it meafures 
6 miles, and from N. to S. upwards of 8. The figure fome- 
what refembles the letter X. In the environs of the town, 
and along the coaft bj Delnies, as alfo about Kildrumie, the 
foil is light and fandy. On the river fide, fand mixed with 
a kind of mortar or clay. The S, fide of the parifti is rather 

of 



•^^^ Statiftical Account 

of a rich and heavy mould. On the N. fxde of the rivcrj 
the ground is flat and level ; and on the S. it rife, with a 
gradual afcent, terminating at one corner of the parifti in thel 
hiU of Urchany, the only eminence in the parifh deferving 
the name of a hill. 

T-o^^.-The town is a royal burgh. In tonjunftion with 
Invernefs, Forres, and Fortrofe, it returns a member to ferve 
m parliament. At what period it was erefted into a royal 
burgh, is uncertain ». The immunities of Nairn originally 
appear to have been very extenfive ; however, in the lapfe 
of time, thcfe have been greatly lelTened ; fo that the com- 
mon good now confifts only of a few moors, which of late 
have been let on various leafes, and which, in procefs of 
time, will be of confiderable advantage to the community. 
There are likewife fome lands, befides the burgage lands,' 
which pay eques and feu-duties to the town; therefore, though 
the public revenue be now but fmall, yet it is increafing, and 
in a few years will be confiderable. The town originally, 
being fituated in a different place, probably, from where it 
now Hands, was defended by a caftle. As far back as the 
time of King Malcolm the Firft, Buchanan informs us that 
this caftle was taken by the Danes, and that by them the 
cujodes or keepers thereof were cruelly ufed. Since that pe- 
riod, 

* The firft charter, of which any copy is extant, was obtained from James 
the Sixth of Scotland, in the year 1589, being the renewal of one granted by 
Alexander, perhaps the firft of that name who fwayed the Scotch fceptre, as it 
is only faid to have been granted by Alexander. There is alfo another charter 
by Charles the Second, in confirmation of the abovementioned one, dated t66u 
The town-council confifts of 17 members, viz. the provoft, 3 bailies, dean of 
fuild, and treafur«r, with 11 counfellors, 9 of which make a quorum; The 
3 bailies, the dean of guild, and treafurer, in confequence of a late decifion 
•f the Houfe of Fecrs, muft be refident. The whole trades make but one cor- 
poration.

,iod, however, the fea has made great encroachments, and 
he ^ourfe of the river is greatly altered. Where the caftle 
then flood, is entirely covered with water and the nver winch 
then run hard by the caftle, now flows xnto the Moray Fr.th 
nearly half an Englifh mile to the E. of that place Never- 
thelefs, there are fome perfpns ftiU alive, whQ at ftream or 
fpring tides, remember to have feen fqme veftiges of the foun- 
dation of the ancient caftle *. 

Agriculture, Heritors. Rents, fee-Improvements in huf- 
bandry are here as yet very little known. The fowxng of 
clover and rye-grafs feeds, though introduced many years 
ago, yet for want of enclofures, turns out ^o little account. 
The field around the town, comprehending fomething more 
than 400 acres, is fo remarkably pleafant, that perhaps 
there is nothing like it in the north of Scotland. The lands 
pf which this field is compofed, and which are aU contiguous, 
were formerly runridge, or acre and acre alternately ; but 
owing to an excambion which took place about 4 years ago, 
the different proprietors will now have it in their power, if 
they pleafe, to enclofc their lands, which heretofore, conve^ 
nicntly, they could not have done. The grounds of 2 or 3 
of the proprietors are now enclofed with ftone and feal fences 
or funk fences ; and I has fubdivided jpart of his lands in the 
neighbourhood. The ordinary crops raifed about the town, 

and 

■ * In the town there arc 2 very good inns, comtnodioufly fitted up, and well 
kept. The one is of a long ftanding, and the other, which is a very large 
houfe, was lately built by Mr. Davidfon of Cantray, at his own expenfe ; fo 
that pcrfons travelling through this country, may, at this ftage, cxpedl to be 
^eU accommodated. There are, befides thefe inns, fo many alehoufes and 
whifky fhops in the town, that to mention the number, might, to ftrangers, 
perhaps appear incredible. It were fincerely to be wifhed, that thefe tippling 
houfes were entirely abolifhed, as they are a nuifance in any place, and highly 
ietfiraental to the health and morals of the people.

The val d ' -'^7 refide. 

The valued rent of the parifh, as taken fro. the ceflbooks 
of the county, amounts to iic61. 8s. Scotch money, exclu 
five of the burgage lands, which may be nearly half as much. 
The prefent real rent, is about Z300I. Sterling, befides about 
=00 bolls of v.aual. Th. rent of lands has rifcn greatly of 
late years, both in the town and country dxftrifts of the'pa- 
rilh. In the immediate vicinity of the tpwn, the acre lets at 
35s., a httle farther diftant, at from 18s. to 30s., and in 
the country from 5 s. to 20 s. the acre. Of old, the greatefl 
part of the rent was paid in vidual , but now it is moftly all 
converted into money. Few cuftoms or carriages are exa6b- 
ed. And It is to be hoped, that every remain of feudal fer- 
vitude will foon be entirely abolifhed. 

Eccleftafaccd State, Schools, Poor.-Nairn originally was a 
menfal church attached to the Deanry of Auldearn. The 
prefent kirk, manfe, and offices, had a partial repair 1789 
and are juft now in a tolerable ftate. The ftipend is 5 chal' 
ders of viftual, and 27 1. of money, exclufive of the fum al- 
lowed for communion elements, which is only 5I. ; fo that at 
the ordinary converfion, the ftipend does not exceed 67 1. Ster- 
ling. Brodie of Brodie is patron.-The grammar fchool is, 
and has been in a very flourifhing condition for many years 
I)ack. The prefent incumbent, who is extremely attentive 



Of Nairiu 



and arduous, has been remarkably fuccefsful in his line. 
The number of fcholars is feldom below 80, and often ex- 
ceed 100. Gentlemen from all quarters of the country, and 
fome from England, fend their children to be educated here. 
Every branch of education, which now makes fuch a noife in 
the academies, is taught at Nairn, in perfedion. Several fcho- 
lars are annually fent to fome one or other of the univerfities ; 
and many gentlemen who now make a figure in diftant parts 
of the world, and not a few who are an ornament to their 
country at home, in the learned profeflions, received their edu- 
cation at Nairn within thefe 25 years from the prefent teach- 
er. The falary is only a chalder of vi6tual ; and even that 
paid in pecks and lippies by the tenants *. — The poor are ex- 
tremely numerous, and many of them very indigent indeed. 
The roll contains upwards of 150 names j and therefore, an}' 
relief they can receive, muft be but very inconfiderable. 
The funds for their fupport, arife from the church colledlons 
•on the Sabbath days, a fmall mortification, and the intereft 
of fome money laid up by the feflion in good years for the 
ijehoof of the poor. A public diftribution is only made once 
a-year ; but they who are greatly reduced, and very needy, 
receive occafional fupplies. None, even in 1783, died for 
want. Independent of the visual bellowed by Government, 
the feflion advanced a confiderable fum for the wants of the 
neceflitous. The weekly colleftions are but trifling, feldom 
■exceeding 3 s. Sterling of good copper. Many of thgfe who

• What a pity, that men of abilities and diaracler, who dedicate their time 
and labours to the improvement of youth, fliould be fo poorly rewarded, as the 
generality of the fchoolmafters of Scotland arc I It is truly melancholy to 
think, that grooms and footmen fliould receive fuch extravagant wages, vvhilft 
a body of men, on whofe labours the welfare of fociety doth fo much depend, 
Ihould, in a manner, be negledled and overlooked. There is alfo in the town 

fjhool for girls, with a houfe for the miftrefs, and lol. of falarv.

receive forae affiftance at tlie annual diftributlon, work alfo 
for their own liveliliood. The heritors never have been af- 
fefled for the maintenance of the poor. 

Population — According to Dr. Webfter's report, the num- 
ber of fouls in 1755, was 1698. From an accurate lift taken of 
the catechifeable perfons in this parifli, in the years 1789 and 
1790, by the prefent incumbent, from 7 years old and up- 
wards, the total number amounts to 1780. But as there arc 
feveral families of Antiburgher Seceders in the pariiL, and 
fome of the Epifcopal perfuafion, whom the minifter at that 
vifitation did not fee, the number of catechifeable perfons, at 
the loweft computation, cxclufive of the fcholars at the gram- 
mar fchool, cannot be below 2000 ; fo that eftimating f be- 
low 7 years of age, the number of fouls in town and parifli 
is, atlcaft, 2400.. From the foregoing lift, it appears, that 
in the town there are fomewhat more than iioo, and in the 
country part of the pariQi, fomewhat lefs than 1300 fouls. It 
is faid, that about 40 years ago, there were only 600 inha- 
bitants in the town ; fo that the increafe is very confiderable. 
Some time ago, there were 2 Antiburgher clergymen in this 
parifti : One of them is now fettled in Perth/hire. Seceftion, 
in this country, is not gaining ground. The proportion of 
males to females, is nearly as 30 to 27.

cure and export it either to the London or a foreign market. 
There are 6 filhing boats in the town, and 2 in the country 
part of the parifh, in each of which about 7 men are employ, 
ed. Formerly there were from 10 to 12 boats , but on ac 
count of greater encouragement, feveral of the fifhermen, par- 
ticularly young lads, have removed to other parts of the 
kingdom. Haddocks, Ikate, cod, flounders, and fome W

Roads and Bridges The great military road leading from 

Forres to Fort-George, is in very good repair. The Highland 
road from Nairn to the Bridge of Dulfie is remarkably bad. 
Statute labour is not commuted, and therefore cannot be fup- 
pofed to be fo well executed. The only bridge in the parifii 
worth mentioning, is that of Nairn. It was built in the year 
1631 or 1632, as appears from an infcription on a ftone of 
the bridge, now fallen into the river. The infcription is, 
" Gulielmus Rofe de Clava." The motto, " Non eft falus, 
nifi in Chrifto." " Soli Deo Gloria." In the year 1782, 
nearly one half of the bridge was carried off by a flood or 
fpeat in the river. In that fituation it continues to this day ; 
and were it not owing to the attention of the magiftrates and 
council, who have made a temporary repair with timber, on 
many occafions, the river would be impaifable. It is exceed- 
ingly ftrange, that an affair of fuch public utility ftiould have 
been fo long negleded and overlooked ; for furely it is well 
known to every traveller, that a bridge over the water of 
Nairn is much more neceffary than either over the Spey or 
the Findhorn, becaufe the two laft mentioned rivers have efta- 
bliflied paffage-boats. It is therefore earneftly to be hoped,* 
that Government will foon take a grievance of fuch public

hill where the young men or lads were killed. Here, it is 
faid that 18 of the Mackintoflies were deftroyed by the Cum- 
mines, who then lived at Rait, on account of fome grudge 
that fubfifted between the families. At the place of Eafter 
Geddes, are the remains of an old chapel, with a burying 
ground around it. In this chapel is the buryiag place of th^ 
family of Kilravock ; and here they have been interred for 
many generations back, perhaps ever fince the Rofes came to 
this part of Scotland. How long the Rofes were in pofl'eftion 
of the lands of Geddes, previous to the marriage of the Laird 
of Geddes with Mary de Bofco, lady and heirefs of Kilravock, 
cannot now', with certainty, be afcertained, as the writs of the 
family relative to that eftate were deftroyed in the cathedral

pie to reficle here. But the pricesiof provifions of every kind 
saving nfen greatly of late, and the mofs being almoft entire- 
ly exhaufted, have contributed to increafe the number of men 
dicants who infeft the place, and added confiderably to the 
poor's roll. Befides the bridge before mentioned, there are 
two other great difadvantages, which bear hard upon the town 
Jind country, and thefe are, the want of fome manufafture 
and the want of a pier. Both thefe might, it is fuppofed, be 
removed at no very confiderable expenfe, and to the great e- 
molument of Nairn and the neighbourhood. By altering the 
prefent courfe of the river, many people fay that a pier might 
be built, capable of receiving ftiips o(^ confiderable burthen. 
Were a fpirit of improvement once introduced, either a linen 
or a woollen manufafture might be eftablilhed, which, if well 
condufted, would add greatly to the advantage of proprietors 
of lhares, and to the country in general. The numbe- of peo- 
ple who apparently want employment in the town and its 
vicinity, is abfolutely incredible. If induftry, which in a 
great meafure feems to be dormant, were aroufed, there is 
little doubt but Nairn might become aflourifliing place. 

Miscellaneous Obfervations.—Th^ people, in general, are 
about the middle fize, affable enough in their manners, with 
a few exceptions, pretty regular in their attendance on the 
ordinances of divine inftitution, and rational, without an over- 
heated zeal, or too much coldnefs in their religion. Thofe 
of the Eftabliftied Church, fome fewrof the Epifcopalian per- 
fuafion, and the Antiburgher Seceders, live in good terms 
with one another. *Few,perfons from this parifli have been

where it borders upon Tarbolton and Craigie, 3 ^iik^ m

above half that meafure. On the W., it is bounded by .the 
Erith of Clyde, oppofite to the ifland of Arran. The village 
and church of Monktown are diflant from the fea about a 
mile. The profped is agreeable and pleafant, and the air fa- 
lubrious. Seldom any epidemical difeafes prevail, but fuch 
as are common. The village contains about 34 dwellings

fruitful, diverfifyed in its quality. Upon the E. and higheft

Siatlftical Account 

Wrt of it, Jt is an earthy claj, in the middle, deep and loamy 
and, as it approaches the fea. is fandy and benty downs that 
anfwer for the pafturing of young cattle ; and, from faltnefs of 
the water, and warmth of the climate, judged conducive to 
the recovery of weak fheep. Snow and froft are of fhort du 
ration m the wmter, and the pafture open. The grounds are 
xnoftly enclofed with ditch and hedge in the Monktown part 
of the parifti, and properly fubdividcd into parks, with ex ^ 
t^nfive belts of planting. In Preftick, the enclofures are few 
foil fandy, and the tenure by which they hold their free- 
doms unfavourable for fuch improvement, being fubjeft to a 
evolution every 19 years, when, by a rule now eftabliflied 
taey are to caft lots for the refpeftive freedom each freeman 
IS to polTefs. The foil is better toward the E., where it joins 
the Newtown loch and St. Quivox. The lower part next the 
crops of rye, oats, and bear, which are jrood 
m wet feafons. The foil there is found good for crops of po- 
tatoes, and might produce turnip. The mpft of the enclofing 
and planting has been made within thefe 60 years, and there 
are people ftill alive, who remember when it began. The 
ground rents paid by the tenants, at prefent, are generally 
from 25 s. to 35 s. and 40s. the acre, and fome pay more. 
Grafs lets at 21 s. 25s. and fome 30s. the acre. The foil be- 
ing light rich mould, naturally runs into graft and white 
clover, when fallow. Before enclofzng, fome people remem- 
ber, that the higheft rent for croft land was le merks Scots -

Agricultjire, &amp;c.— The cultivation is ufually 2 years oats 
then bear or barley laid down with grafs-feeds, fometimes 
.peafe and beans, and afterward a crop of oats. When the 
ground is laid down with grafs-feeds, or, after cutting i or

coal-mines have been found ; but there are appearances tha 
indicate tkat fuch may be found in procefs of time, and wdl 
undoubtedly turn out to great advantage, as lying near the 
fea. The quantity of natural wood, is 36 acres, befides large 

plantations. . 

There are no rivers in the parifh , but there are s rivulets : 
I The Pow-burn, over which there is one bridge, on thor 
toU-road leading from Monktown to Ayr, and anoriier lately 
begun to be erefted on the road to St. Quivox and Tarbolton. 
The other a rivalets are called Rumbler-burn, and Fall-burn, 
which all run into the fea, and in fummer are moftly dry. 
At prefent, there is only i mill in the parilh for grinding 
grain, and another for flax, kept by the fame miller. Few 
are aftrifted to it, the farmers being at liberty to carry their 
grain to any mill they pleafe, without being opprefled with 
multures, which are a great difcouragement to agriculture. 

The ufual produce after milling oats, is i8, 19, and 20 
pecks the Winchefter boll, now the llandard meafure of this

chofe to fix their folitary refidence, or to have their remains

The whole of this parifti is a part of that mountainous 
track of country, which, commencing at the fouthern boun- 
dary of it, continues all the way to Greenock. It therefore 
prefents every where, a broken, unequal furface, rifmg m 
many places into high hills, interfperfed with a number o£ 
romantick rivulets, and fome of them green to their very 
fummits. From the tops of thefe hills, a profpea prefents 
itfelf, which, for variety and grandeur, is fcarcely to be e- 
quailed. At one view, the eye takes in the broken land and 
Imall founds formed by the iflands of Arran, Bute, the two 
Cumbrays, and the coafts of Cowal and Cantire ; the exten- 
five coal! of Carrick, from Ayr to Ballintrae ; a wide expand-

Climate, &amp;c.~Frotn the vicinity of this diflricl to the fea 
the air is generally moift, and the climate variable ; .rcat 
quantities of rain falling in the fpring and autumn, w^hxch 
proves a confiderable hinderance to farming operations. Not. 
withftanding thefe circumftances, the inhabitants are for th« 
moftpart healthy, few difeafes being epidemical among them • 
and many of them live to a great age. An example of ua-' 
common longevity occurred fome years ago, of a man in the 
ieffer ifland of Cumbray, who died at the advanced period of 
loi. The difeafes moft common, are the rheumatifm, and 
what is called the baftard peripneumony, which moft fre- 
quently attacks old people. Palfies too, fometimes occur. 
And here it may be proper to obferve, that all the different 
kinds of nervous difeafes, are found to prevail more in coun- 
tries fituated upon the fliore, than in inland parts. Whether 
this is to be afcribed to fome peculiar quality in the air, that 
predifpofes to thefe nervous affeclions, there being no mate- 
rial difference in the manner of living, the writer will not 
take upon him to determine. A very malignant fpecies of 
quinfy, vulgarly called the clofing, in fome feafons, proves 
fatal to children of between 3 and 5 years of age. It makes 
its appearance in the fpring and autumn, and baffles every re- 
medy. The fmall-pox, when they are of a virulent kindj 
carry off a good many j and hitherto, all efforts to introduce 
inoculation have failed. No arguments can overcome the fu- 
perftitious opinions of the people, or their dread of the po- 
pular odium.

places wet and fprlngy : but to this getieral defcrlptlon there 
are exceptions ; and there might be ftiU more, were any juftxcc 
done to the land, or proper attempts made, with judgment 
and perfevering induftry, to overcome or alleviate its natu- 
ral difadvantages. The 3 following foils are the moll com- 
mon : A very light, dry, fandy foil, with a mixture of goo4 
earth ; the moffy ; and a ftrong tilly clay. Thefe different foils, 
point out to the intelligent farmers, what method of cultiva- 
tion they would require, It is agreed, that compoft of dung, 
earth, andlirae, would fuit thefirft mentioned foil,; and that 
^henlaid down richly, it would produce excellent crops of 
clover and other graffes ; yet this hath never been fufficiently 
tried : and until of late years, the farmers in this part of the 
country, who had adopted the very worft praftice of the old 
hufbandry, remained utterly unacquainted with the method 
of laying down land in this manner. However, nature has 
done a great deal for them here, by affording a fpontaneous 
manure, which is well adapted to the light land, and, in a 
great meafure, fiiperfedes the neceffity of any other, and that 
is fea-weed, which is thrown in in fuch vaft quantities by 
the winter gales, that the people have only to be at the pains 
to lead it out and lay it upon their fields. This manure, 
from its hpt ftimulating nature, is of quick operation, and 
when aided by a moid fummer, and refrefhing ftiowers, 
throws up bountiful crops. For many years, this was the 
only manure ufed for general cultivation ; and it was applied 
to all foils indifcriminately, to which it could be tranfported ; 
and where this was not pra6licable, the land was left without 
any other means of improvement, than what it derived from 
mere reft ; any little dung made upon the farm, being ufed 
for raifing potatoes and bear. The method of management 
for the outfield land of fuch farms as lie without the reach 
^f fea-weed, is to let it reft for 4 years ; then plough it for a 

4 fcourging 



4o8 



S-lattJlical Account 



fcourging crops of oats ; then let it reft as before ; next fuc, 
ceed the 2 ploughings; and fo on, in this rotation. 

For the other 2 foils mentioned, lime is certainly exceed- 
ing proper; but very ftrong prejudices were long entertained 
againft it. When the prefent incumbent entered to his charge, 
there was not an ounce of lime laid upon land within the 
parifh, and no reafoning could prevail with the farmers to 
try it : they pleaded their ignorance of its operation, the me- 
thod of applying it, and the great expenfe attending the con- 
veyance of it from a diftant kiln. But, whether from ob- 
ferving the great advantages arifing from it in neighbouring 
pariflies, where it hath been long introduced, or that they 
are fubjefted to certain regulations by the late leafes, or 
from the more enterprifing fpirit of fome new proprietors, a 
mighty change has taken place in the people's ideas with re- 
gard to lime, in confequence of which, vaft quantities of it 
have been laid upon the land within thele 3 years ; greater in- 
deed, in proportion to the extent of the parifh, than any 
other within the county. This gives ground to hope, that a 
better method of hulbandry, though yet in its infancy, will, 
in a few years, from perfeverance, and the influence of a 
laudable example, become more general *, 

Ths 

* The prejudices of the people, are not the only hinderance to the progrefs 
of agricultural improvements in this parifli. One local difadvantage which it 
labours under, muft have contributed much to retard them, and that is, that 
there is neither coal nor lime-done to be found within itfelf, though pains have 
been takeh to difcover them, and attempts made to link pits for that purpofe. 
4jid what renders the only expedient for fupplying this defedl, more enibarraf. 
£ng is, the duty upon coals carried coaftways, and even to places within the 
precindls of the fame port, and where the coal-works are fituated. This hath 
difcouraged farmers from bringing lime-ftone by water, from Arran, and the 
greater Cumbray, where it is to be had in abundance, becaufe, though it might 
be procured from thofe places, at no great charge, there is no coal to bum it 
with, but what mult be fetched at an extraordinary expenfe. 'Rie barbarous

will hereafter be mentioned, the attenuon of the people hath 
'^een much turned to the cultivation of th.s plant, and great- 
er quantities of flax are raifed in Kilbride than :n any ne gh- 
bouring dift.ia ; it is moft commonly fown after potatoes. 
The fofl being peculiarly adapted to potatoes, they produce 
luxuriantly. Wheat is feldom fown here, and no attempts 
hitherto made to introduce it into general pradice, have fuc- 
teeded to expedation. Beans and peafe are not much culti- 
vated ; for, befides that, the foil in mod places is reckoned 
too light for them : in a climate where the weather and fea- 
fons are fo variable, they are, not without reafon, confidered 
as a hazardous crop. One circumftance, which ought not to 
be omitted, in defcribing the ftate of agriculture in thas pa- 
rifli, isi the improved tafle fome proprietors have difcovered, 
of late-, in the conftruaing of {leadings, or farm-houfes, up- 
on their eftates ; in place of the old dirty, cold, inconvenient 
huts, the tenants are now accommodated with clean, fubftan- 
tial, well aired habitations, where equal attention hath been

ralfing of flax. The reafon of this is, that confiderablc quan- 
tities of coarfe linen are made every year, which is the only 
ipecies of manufadlure among them, cultivated to any extent. 
It employs the female hands during winter, and brings a con- 
fiderablc fum into the place. It is bleached and whitened at 
home, at a fmall expenfe. There is an annual market for it, 
in the month of June, where it is bought up by the linen 
dealers from Glafgow and Paifley, who export the greateft 
part of it to the Weft Indies. Near 7000 yards of cloth, of 
this coarfe fabric, are manufactured yearly, which fells at 
the rate of from is. to I5d. the yard, At the medium of 
23id. the yard, the fum produced, will amount nearly to 
389I. IIS. 8d. ; which fum, divided among the farmers and 
houfekeepers, enables them to pay off their domeftic debts 
with more eafe and pundluality. Another fmall branch of 
manufadlure is kelp, of which about 10 tons are made, up- 
on an average, yearly, and which fells at 3I. and 5I. the ton. 
At fome former period, a falt-work was carried on, upon the 
eftate of Hunterfton. Several old men remembered to have 
feen the ruins of a building upon the fliore, that had been 
employed in the work ; but, from fome unknown caufe, it 
was given up. Of late, the Clk and cotton branches have 
been introduced, and employ a competent number of hands. 
From this circumftance, and the attention paid to the making 
of linen, the number of weavers muft greatly exceed that of 
any other clafs of mechanicks. Their numbers are, linen 
■weavers 17, cotton 19, filk 3. The other handicraftfmen 
are, joiners a, blackfmiths 3, ftioemakers 3, tailors 5. 

In the diftridls of the pariQi, lituated upon the fliore, fifli- 
ing was purfued to an extent that ought not to be overlook- 
ed in this account. It appears, from the beft information, 
that, at the beginning of this century, upwards of 30 boats, 
■belonging to the place, were employed annually in the her- 
ring 



Of Weft Kilbride, 



rin^ and cod fiQiery ; each boat had 4 men, when at the her- 
ring-fifliing. From the month of July to Oaober, they were 
all occupied in this branch. In the months of February and 
March, about a dozen of thefe boats, doubly manned, ftretch- 
ed away to the coafts of Galloway, Ireland, and Cantire, in 
fearch of cod, ling, and oyfters. The number of men em- 
ployed in thefe fineries, when in their moft flouriihing ftate, 
could not be lefs than 150; and the average fum acquired 
jjpon them both, might amount to about 600 1, Sterling. For 
many years, however, this trade was on the decline, and the 
few boats that remained, when depopulation, to be mention- 
,ed in the fequel, took place, were, in confequence fupprefled ; 
fince that time, no attention has been paid to it, and the art 
feems now totally loft, 

Rent^ Farms, &amp;c.^The real rent of this parifh, is 2528I, 
Sterling. There are about 40 farms in it, which let from 
300 1. to 36I. There are 19 heritors, of which, % of the 
greater, and 8 of the leffer, are non-refident. The number 
of flieep is 2000 ; the moft of them are the fmall black-faced 
breed.. A few of the Englifli breed have been introduced, 
and are multiplying faft. The wool of the Iheep, whofe 
walk is upon the fliore, is of a finer quality than that of 
thofe who graze upon the hilly grounds, and fells for at leaft 
a third more. The flieep upon the higher walks are laid 
with tar, thofc upon the lower are not, which, perhaps, may 
be one reafon of this difference in the pile of the wool. The 
average quantity of wool fold off the different walks, is a- 
bout 625 ftones yearly. The pafture in this parifli, is re- 
markably favourable for feeding ; and both the mutton and 
beef fattened upon it, upon account of their fuperior quality 
in point of flavour and fwectnefs, have the preference in every 
market where they are expofed. Of black cattle, there are

about 620 : Horfes 155 ; of which, within thefe 12 years^, 
the breed is mightily improved *. 

Population According to Dr. Webfter's report, the po- 
pulation in 1755, was 885. From a pretty accurate account 
lately taken of the number of inhabitants, it appears to a- 
mount to 6q8, young and old. The average number of 
births, for the lall 10 years, being 180 ; of marriages 50 ; 
of deaths 1 00. There is not the fmalleft doubt that the po- 
pulation of this parifh, was much greater about 50 years ago, 
than it is now. The many veftiges of demoliflied farm- 
houfes to be feen in different places, and the reports of old 
men, afford fufficient proofs of depopulation. At a medium 
calculation, there are 100 families fewer now, than former- 
ly ; fo that reckoning at the rate of 6 to a family, makes the 
number of inhabitants to have decreafed from that period, no 
lefs than 600 f .

* For fome years paft, the prices of labour and provifions have been gradual, 
ly increafing. The wages of an artift have rifen from I5d. to iSd. and 22d., 
and of a common labourer from is. to I5d. and i3d. a-day. A flieep, which 
formerly might have been bought for 10 s., now brings i6s. and 20s. A lamb 
cannot novf be purchafe4 for muph 1?elow the old price of a fheep. isutter has 
advanced from 6d. to^d. and iid, the pound: And all other articles in pro- 
portion. The caufe of this rife is eafy to be affigned, from the rapid increafe 
of luxury; the different mode of living introduced into every rank'; the great 
demand for hands to be employed in the various branches of manufactures ; and, 
of courfe, the vaft influx of people from the country to the great towns, where 
they immediately find work and good encouragement, which neceffarily creates 
an increafing demand, and a ready market for every article of life. 

f The reafons for this, may be here affigned. About the time above mcn- 
tione^d," forae gentlemen of very confiderable property in the parifh, adopted the 
idea of grazing, as being better fuited to the foil than ploughing, becaufe, from 
the lightnefs of it, it naturally runs into grafs : In confequence, whole baronies 
and large tracks of land, formerly planted thick with families, were thrown 
wafte, to make way for this new mode of management ; and numbers of there

Antiquities, Remarkable Occurrences, &amp;c._-This article

to incline to an angle of fo.e elevation. They begxn froru 
the water's edge, receding backwards fron., and rxhng one a. 
bove another to the top, like the ileps of a fta.r. Upon the 
S. fide, are a few dwell in g-houfes, and an old Goth.c caftle, 
fituated direaiy oppofite to another of the fame kmd upor* 
the main land. Concerning the antiquity of this caftle, no- 
thing can now be learned, and no date or infcnption, from 
which it might be afcertained, has ever been difcovered. It 
feems to have been a place of feme ftrength. It is furround- 
'ed by a rampart and a foffe, over which has been a draw-bndge. 
It was furprifed and burned by Cromwell's foldiers. The 
ifland was then in the poffeffion of the family of Eglmtoune, 
which it has continued to be ever fince. In this iUand, are 
no fewer than 7 caves*. 

There are yet to be feen, the ruins of a very ancient chapel, 
or place of worftiip, faid to have been dedicated to Saint Vey, 
who lies buried near it} probably, it was a dependency of I. 
Colm Kill. 

Proceeding to the main land, we meet with another old 
caftle, called Portincrofs, diredly oppofite, as has been ob- 
ferved, to the one upon the Little Ifle. Of the hiftory of this,

ftands upon rocks fo clofe to the fea, that the waves dafli a- 
gainft its defaced walls, and at the very entrance of the in- 
let or creek that forms the port. It fecms to have been a 
royal hunting feat, one of thofe places to which the Court 
retired, to enjoy the diverfion of fifhing and the chafe *. 

Hitherto, no fatisfying account has been given of the ori- 
gin of the name of this place. In the common language of 
the country, it is called Pencrofs, which is juft a corruption 
of its proper ancient name, Portincrofs ; but, for the reafon 
of the name, we have only conjefture. And, upon a fub- 
jeft fo uncertain, we may be allowed to hazard one, juft as 
tenable as any other, in the note below f.

• What leads to this conjedlure, is, that there is ftlll extant in the poffef- 
Con of Robert Hunter, Efq. of Hunterfton, a charter of feafin, figned by Ro- ' 
bert the Second, at this caflle, in the 1374, being the 4th year of his reign, 
veiling the family of Hunterfton, in the property of certain parts of the lands 
of Ardneel ; and to which deed, the names of feveral nobles who attended thd 
King in that excurfion, and compofed part of his court, are appended as wit- 
neffes. 

■j- The promontory, near to which,, this port and caftle are fitnated, is the 
extreme point of land diredlly W. from Edinburgh. To this day, the track of 
a line of road, can be diftindHy traced through the country, leading from the 
capital to this port. From this circumftance, as well as from the very name, 
we coiiclude it aiuft have been a place of fome confequence. In thefe barbar- 
ous and remote times, ther6 could be no trade carried on in it, to give it that 
confequence. Neither can it be imagined, there was fo much communication 
between the Highlands and the main land, as that this place might be con- 
verted into a mere ferry port, for the conveniency of paflengers, who, we may 
believe, would hardly be induced, either from profit or curiofity, to vifit thefe 
inhofpitable regions. 

The moft probable account, therefore, of the ihftttir, feems to be, that fliis 
was the place where they took boat to go over to the celebrated monaftery of 
I. Colm Kill, the moft ancient foundation of the kind in Scotlasd, and which, 
it is well known, was, for many ages, the burial-place of our Scottilh Kings. 
And, as this monaftery was eftabli/hed long tefore any other in this country, it 
may be fuppofed, that, in that period of the gloomy reign of fuperftition, manjr 
pilgrimages were made to it. Hence, the name Portincrofs, being a compound 

of

The next objeft of attention in this quatter, is the preci-

k Portus and Crucis; becaufe, from this port, was the nearell and mo ft direft 
paffage over to the royal Cemetery, and from it too, the pious travellers took 
their departure to do pennance. or mSke their offerings at the facred place. 
What corroborates this conjecflure fomewhat, is, that at Lochranfa in the N. 
end of Arran. there is an old caftle, xvhere, tradition reports, the compames 
paffuig to the weftern ifles, (whether thefe funeral and pilgrimage proceffions, is 
.uncertain), were wont to flop and refrelh ; and then, as may be concluded, crof- 
£ng over the narrow Ifthmus of Cantire, arid again taking boat, after failmg 
through the found between lilay and Jura, were immediately at Jona, the ob- 
ject of their deftination. This port and caftle have become ftill more remark- 
able, from an occurrence that happened near them, and which deferves to be 
taken notice of here, namely, the lofs of one of the Spanifli fhips, that com- 
pofed the famous Armada, intended for the conqucft of England, in the year 
1588, in confequence of their difperfion by a ftorm, after the aftion with the 
Englifh fleet. She funk in about lo fathom water, at no great diftance from 
the fliore. It is difficult to affign a reafon for the accident ; the probability is, 
that coming up the Frith, with edfy weather, and all fail up, and ports open, 
a fudden guft from the land, which often happens in narrow feas, had overfet 
her. An attempt was made, fome more than 50 years ago, by means of a 
diving machine, to examine her fituation, and whether it was poffible to weigh 
iier up, or to recover what was molt valuable belonging to her. The diver re- 
ported, that from the fize of her guns, fhe appeared to have been a capital fiiip; 
and a very large cheft was perceived fixed upon deck. The operation fucceed- 
ed fo far; that fome fine brafs guns were brought up, and a fmaller iron one, 
which ftill lies upon the beach. This piece of ordnance, has undergone many 
infpedtions, and various opinions have been formed about the weight of its fhot. 
To judge from the caliber of it, in its prefent corroded ftate, it feems to have 
been a 14 or 16 pounder. A fecond attempt was to have beeri made, with £t 
new and more complete apparatus, when, it is probable, much more of the 
wreck would have been recovered, but the death of one of the undertakers, 
unfortunately put an end to the fcheme. 

Within the very fafne plaCe where the Spanifli fliip went dbwii, a fine veffel 
belonging to Glafgow; the richeft that ever was fitted out from this countrj-, 
and the property of Glasford and Company, was alfo loft, in the fpring of thi 
year 1770. This difafter was occafioncd, not by ftrefs of weather, but through 
the inadvertency of the fliip's company, in allowing the veffel to drift too far 
in during night, ere the light-houfe wits perceived, and in eudeavouring to put 
her hbout, Qie miffed ftays, and went upon the rocks.

ward of Portincrofs,- and forms the promontory or extreme 
point of land above mentioned. The name is of Gaelic ori- 
ginaj, and fignifies a high point, or Neel's high point. It is 
truly a noble precipice. A fmall plain is interjefted between 
it and the water's edge, from which it rifes abruptly to the 
height of more than 230 feet perpendicular. As we ap- 
proach it upon the S. fide, we meet with a vaft mound of 
curious heterogeneous matter, which, if there was any veftige 
of a crater nigh it, one might be ready to pronounce of the 
volcanic kind. But ,as there is every reafon to conclude, 
that, not only the plain between the precipice and the water, 
but the inland valley which runs along the back of it, have 
been once occupied by the fea, and the precipice itfelf form- 
ed, into an ifland, another theory occurs, namely, that this 
mound has, at fome period, been thrown up by the influx 
and eddy of the tide, and muft hare been colledting there for 
ages ; but being at laft left dry by the retiring of the fea, 
through length of time it is confolidated into a firm com^ 
pafted mafs. As we advance, the rock, compofed of differ- 
ent kinds of ftone, grows more fteep and elevated. At bot- 
tom, it is finely ikirted with natural ihrubbery ; farther up, its 
aged front is adorned with an endlefs v'ariety of plants, fuch 
as hoar-hound, wild thyme, capillus veneris, &amp;c. Toward 
the fummit, it is lined with a thick covering of mofs, which 
gives it a very venerable and grotefque appearance ; and here, 
$he. whole terminates in 3 diftinft cliffs, which, from their 
cxadt fimilarity in figure and altitude, have, time immemorial, 
obtained the appellation of the Three Sifters. In this fequef- 
tered fcene, where there is fo much of the grand and the 
beautiful, a perfon given to contemplation, and who loves fo- 
litude, may enjoy a walk to great advantage ; he will have 
an opportunity of tracing nature, in fome of her more ftrik- 
ing features of awfulnefs and majefty.

This parifh, it hath been obferved before, abounds with 
faiUs , it may indeed be called a iyftem of them The names 
of fome of them are Gaelic. The moft remarkable are, the 
Tarbet hill, the Law, the Auld hill, and the Comb or Gamb 
which fignifies crooked. They have all been ufed as fignal 
polls in the times of the DaniQ^ invafions. By fires from 
their tops, the alarm was foon given of the appearance of an 
enemy. Upon the Auld hill, there are the remams of a cir- , 
cular building, which, it is likely, was occupied as a watch 
tower. At the foot of the fecond, ftands another Gothic 
canie, which takes its name from the hill, the Law, it is one 
of the completed of the kind to be feen any y^here. It was 
formerly one of the feats of the Kilmarnock family, who had 
large poffeffions in this part of the country j but- at what time 
it was built, no account can be given ; but from its appear- 
ance, it muft be much more modern, than any of the other 
two already defcribed. The laft memioned hill, is famed for 
affording fine millftones, compofed of a fort of coarfe granite, 
and are of an uncommonly hard and durable quality. Thefe 
millftones are in fuch high repute, as to be demanded from 
places at the diftance of 80 miles ; they are difpcrfed through 
the Highlands and i^ands, and fome of them exported to Ire- 
land, to America, awd Weft Indies. 

There are no rive'^in this parifh, but a number of fmaller 
ftreams or burns, which, after heavy rains, fometimcs come 
down in vaft torrents from the hills. One of thefe, near the 
* northern boundary of the parifh, taking its courfe through a 
romantic glen, called the Glen of Southannan, is remarkable 
for a ferics of beautiful catara£ls, which diminifli gradually 
as the ftream approaches the fea. The largeft of thefe falls 
at the head of the glen, is indeed a flriking piece of nature's 
work. The whole ftream ifTuing with a rapid current from 
■between 2 high hills, precipitates over a rock from the height

IS formed into a capacious fphere, as if it had been hollowed 
out with a chifel, and refembling a bal'on tumbled upon its 
fide ; over it, the rocks at top, projea with threatening ma- 
jefly. The wildnefs of the fcene is much increafed by the 
fiBe natural wood that encircles the abyfs, where tlie oak, the 
haxle, the birch, leem to vie with each other, in difplaying 
their mingled verdure. 

Near to this fpot, are the ruins of the fine houfe of South- 
annan, formerly the r;efidence of the family of Semple, now 
the property of my Lord Eglintoune. It is buih in the Ita- 
lian tafle ; a Lord Semple, who refided fome time in Italy, in 
the reign of James the Sixth, brought the model of it from 
that country. A beautiful green hill, of a fegondary ordef 
to" the Comb, but attached to it, rifes with a bold and fudden 
fwell behind the houfe, from thence we look down upon th? 
difmantled fabrick of a once fplendid dwelling, hiding, as it 
•were, its deformity, -among a number of very fine old elms, 
beeches, and afhes, whofe venerable boughs, no\y bending to 
the earth, befpeak their age ; and over the tops of the trees 
and the ruins, an expanded fheet of vyater, which at full fea, 
feems to come in conta£l with them. Viewed from this 
point, the landfcape is abundantly charming and diverfifiec^.

CharaBer of the People, Manners, Sec— It may well be 
accounted a fortunate circumftance for the inhabitants of this 
place, that their fequellered fituation has hitherto fecured 
them from the incroaching influence ot that corruption, which 
in other places of more bufinefs and refort, has produced fo 
great a change in the morals of the people. They, on the 
contrary, have uniformly fup ported a charader for induftry, 
fobriety, and decent condud. The oldeft man living, does 
pot recollea an inftance of one convicled of a capital crime. 
Their feftive meetings are condufted with much cheerfuinefs 
and rural gaiety, but without riot. Their punftuality ia 
paying their debts, at two terms in the year, is now grown 
into local ufage. They are uncommonly regular in their atr 
tendance upon public worfliip ; and at church, exhibit a very 
decent appearance, from the neatnefs of their drefs, and at- 
tention to the facred fervice. In their behaviour, efpecially 
to their fuperiors, and to ftrangers, there is an affability and 
difpretion, that diftinguiflies it remarkably from the morofe 
and fuUen rufticity of fome of the more inland peafants. In

as Weft Kilbnde. J^rom a calculation made in the year 1782 
appeared that upwards of 63 men were employed in the 
ferv.ce of the Navy, or aboard trading velTels, and feme of 
them were m every great adion fought at fea, during the late 
war. At prefent, the number is confiderably lefs, upon ac 
count of the great encouragement, of late years, held out to 
manufadurers, which induced many young men. who would 
otherwife have gone to fea, to become weavers ; the wages 
and pay of a feaman, being fo much below what can eafilv 
be earned by the commonelt manufaaurer. What a pity is 
It, that thefe brave and ufeful men, from whofe toils and 
dangers, their country acquires fo much wealth and glory 
are not more adequately rewarded ! This change in the incli- 
nations of the young men,- which determines them to prefer 
the manufaauring to the feafaring line, may indeed be more 
gainful to mdividuals, but, in a moral view, promifes no ad- 
Vaniage to the community ; as thei^^S'Vfome reafon to dread" 
that the ingemcus, frank, and man?^raaer of the tar'

turbulent, faa.ous, and fanatical fpirit, whith experience has

and fach encouragement given, as to render it worth any perfon's while to pur-

fome proper ftation,. to. which boats may have eafy accefs upon all occafions,

the fifliers and their families. Upon ^ bleak and oper coaft, fuch as this is, and 
^here there is fo much foul ground. ^ ftable and regular fifliing can never take 
place without thefe provifions. Hithertxi. this Ihore has afforded nothing of the 
kind. The port of Portincrofs does not anfwer the purpofe, the entrance of it 
as fo environed with rocks, that boats can only take it in eafy weather, and th»y 
muftbedrawnup without the reach of an impetuous furge which drives lu 
with every gale. A little to the northward of the old port, between it and a 
place called the Thioughlet, the entrance to the precipice above delcnbed, 
nature points out a fpot. which, by the hattd of art and induftry, might be 
formed into an exceUent filliing ftation. There is a fine natural inlet, upcn

[NUMBER XXXII. 
PARISH OF <name ref="NA">KIRK MICHAEL</name>; 

(cbuNxy OF Banff, Synod of Moray, PRESBYXERt 

Abernethy.) 

By the Rev. Mr. John Grant.</head> 



<p>Name, Extent, Surface^ &amp;c. 

IN Monkifli hlflory, this parifli derives its ecclefiaftic name 
from St. Michael, to whom the chapel, where now the 
kirk. Hands, was anciently dedicated. If this account be 
true, it may be obferved, that the tutelary patron, ever fince 
the period of his eleftion, has paid little regard to the rtw- 
rality of his clients. In the Gaelic, the vernacular idiom^ 
it is called Slrath-ath-f hin, from " Strath," a dale, " ath," 
a ford, and " Fin," the hero Fingal, fo highly celebrated in 
the Poems of Offian. It is generally written Strath-avanj 
avan being the appellative for a river ; but former ety- 
mon approaches much nearer to the provincial pronuncia-

tion. It 13 further confirmed by a ftanza, which is ftill re- 
cited by the old people of the country. 

Chaidh mo bhrans blwtha', 
Ain uifg ath-f hin, nan clachan fleamhuln ; 
'S bho chaidh mo bheans' bhatha', 
Bhcirmeid ath-fhin, ainm an amhuin. 

" On the limpid water of the flippery ftones, has my wife 
befen drowned, and fince my wife has there been drowned, 
henceforth its name fliall be the water of Fingal." It is the 
tradition of the country, that in one of Fingal's excurfions, 
in purfuit of the deer of the mountains, after having croffed 
the river, he was followed by his wife, who being carried 
down by the violence of the ftrfiam, funk, and was drowned. 
To commemorate this melancholy event, in which the hero 
was tenderly interefted, he uttered the above ftanza. Since 
fh'af period, the water, which was formerly called An-uifge- 
geal, or the White Water, in allufion to its tranfparency, af- 
fumed by an eafy tranfition, the name of the ford or river o'f 
Fingal. 

The parilh of Kirkmichael * is divided into lo little dif. 

tridts, 

* It is prcfumable, from its defolatcd fitiiation, the natural barriers by which 
it is feparated from the circumjacent conntries, the detached hills, and numer- 
ous ftreams, by which it is interfecVed, that the parifli of Kirkmichael has not 
been inhabited till of a late period. Several old people, now alive, remember 
the firft; culture of a fpace of ground within its precindls, that may contain, at 
prefent, a tenth part of the whole population. To this circumftance, and the 
coldnefs of the- climate, it has been owing, that the pofleffion of the property 
has undergone fo few changes. The firft proprietor, as far as can be traced 
back by the light of authentic records, feems to have been Macduff, Thane of 
Fife. In a charter, where he makes a gift of the contiguous parifli of Inver- 
aven, it is faid, " %Ialcolmus dc Fife, falutem. Sciant prjefentes, me dediffe,

Population^ 

* Limeftone is fo plenty, that there is fcarcely a farm in the whole parift 
above a mile and a half's diftance from a quarry of it. Freeftone is alfo found 
but of a foft and friable quality. A (late quarry has been opened many years 
ago. and occafionally wrought ; the ftone is of a grcyifli colour. It is hard and 
durable, and fupplies the neighbouring countries in that article, particularly 
Strathfpey. So little tenacious is his Grace the Duke of Gordon of his right of 
property, that he allows every perfon to ufe thefe quarries at pleafure, free from 
all reftraint. Two marl pits have been difcovered, but lying on the diilant 
&amp;irts of the parilh. Farmers have not availed themfelves of the marl as a ma- 
nure ; there are few, however, who ufe not lime for this purpofe. In the year 
1736, an iron mine was opened in the hill Leach-mhic-ghothin, which feparates 
this parifli from Strathdon, by a branch of the York-Building Company, then 
refiding in Strathfpey. It was continued to be wrought till 1739, when,' by a 
derangement in their affaivs, they left that country. Since that 'period,'it has 
been totally abandoned. This mine alfo, is the property of the Duke of Gordon.

Population, &amp;c.— According to Dr. Webfter's report, the 
population in 1755, was ia88. No feOlonal records are now 
in exiilence belonging to this parifh, previous to the 1725, 
when the incumbent before the laft was admitted. Ever 
fince, it has not been poffible to keep them with accuracy. 
Biffenters, of whatever denomination, watch the opportunity 
ot encroaching upon the prerogative of the EaabliQied Church. 
As the third, then, of the people of this pariffi are Romati 
Catholics, the prieft generally takes the liberty of fharing iii 
the funftions that belong to the Proteitant clergyman *. 

By the moft accurate inquiry^" it has been found that this 
pavifli contains 1276 inhabitants, young and old, and of both' 
fexes. Of thefe, 384 are Roman Catholics : all the indivi- 
duals of each profefTion are included, in 253 families, con- 
taining, at an average, 5 perfons to a family, with 265 chil-

* From this circumftance, it mufl; happen, that there will be feveral mar- 
iiages and baptilms unknown to the feffion, and confequently cannot have place 
in its records. Hitherto, the prefent incumbent has not checked this encroach- 
ment, from his averfion to every Icind of illiberal intolerance ; but, on the con- 
trary, allowed the Roman Catholic prieft to ufe every liberty, as if toleration 
had extended to this country. He allows him to many and baptize, im- 
pofe penalties, and exaft them among his owh people, in the fame manner as 
if he were of the Eftabliflied Church. The writer of this ftatiftical article, 
mentions this circumftance, as he thinks it ought to be an invariable rule of 
conduct to pra(rtire that divine ^Srecept, in doing to others, as we would wifli 
others do unto us. Some years ago, too, the taxes impofed upon deaths, mar- 
]Jiages, and baptifms, made them be confidered as a kind of contraband goods, 
and for that reafon, many of them were as much as poffible concealed from 
publick view, that they might elude an impoStion, which they called tyran- 
nical and opprefTive. Though in a different language, this novelty, to their ex- 
perience, incited the people frequently to utter the indignant fentiment of Ba- 
jaculus, general of the Anfibarii, as mentioned by Tacitus, " Deefle,*' fays he^' 
' " terra in qua vivamus, in qua moriamur, non poteft." To the operations of thefe 
caufes, it muft be imputed, that fo little fatisfadlory light, refae^ing the popu- 
lation, can be derived from the mutilated records of the"ffion of Kijrk-

dren under 8 years of age *. During the 4 laft years, accord- 
ing to a late furvey, there have been born, at an average, an- 
nually, 32 children, in the proportion of 21 males to 19 fe- 
males. Old vromen are found to be more numerous than old 
men, in the proportion of 3 to 2. In this period, 10 have 
died of each ; two men at the age of 95 and 86 years ; and 
two women at the age of 93: and 95 years. During the 
fame period, 14, at an average, have died annually. There 
is juft now living, two men 88 years each, and three women, 
87, 89, and 91, each. The average of marriages for rhe laft 
4 years, has been 6 annually. — By a pretty accurate calcula- 
tion, the total of black cattle in the parifh, amounts to 1400, 
with 7050 flieep, 310 goats, and 303 horfes. No other do- 
mefticated animals are reared, except fome poultry, and a 
few geefe. 

■ Acres, Rent, &amp;c. — The whole parifh, exclufive of the 
foreil ot Glenavon, Glenbuilg, and the hill pafture belong- 
ing to the davoch of Delnabo, the property of Sir James 
Grant, contains 29,500 acres, of which little more than 1550 
are arable. The whole rent may be about iiool. Sterling; 
but to a certain extent of grafs following each farm, no rent 
is aiHxed.

A few broken windows mark the fable walls : the gl.fs is

air might be neceffary to cool them ; but in their prefent dif- 
pofition, they frequently complain of the inroads of the .cold, 
to difturb them in their fober meditations ; yet they never 
^xprefs a wifh to remove the inconvenience. Their apathy 
is the more extraordinary, as his Grace the Duke of Gordon, 
is ever ready to liften to the reprefentations of his people, 
and never refufes to grant them a jull and equitable requeft. 
Sir James Grant is patron of the parilk. From 1717, till 
1786, the ftipend of this parifh was no more than 47 1. 4 s. 
5f d. Sterling. During the latter of thefe years, his Grace the 
Duke of Gordon, informed of the fmallnefs of the living, 
was pleafed to beftow upon the prefent incumbent, without 
the painful feeling of folicitation, a gratuitous augmentation ; 
and this at a time when the Court of Seffion were inimical 
to fuch claims. The ftipend, at prefent, is 68 1. 6 s. 8 d. 
Sterling, with 10 1. Sterling, allowed by his Grace for a houfe. 
It will not be deemed a digreffion, to mention that his Grace 
gave a farm to the prefent incumbent, at a moderate rent, 
when an advanced one, and a fine of 20 guineas were offered 
by others. — There are 2 fchools ; a Society one at Tammtoul,

with a falarj of 13!. 10 s., and a parochial one at Tarnph- 
laggan, with a falary of 81. 6 s. 8d.— No funds appropriated 
for the relief of the poor, have been hitlicrto tftabliflied in 
this pariih. Three years ago, the trifling fuin of 5 1. Ster- 
ling, was bequeathed by an old woman ; and, without ex- 
aggeration, few parifiies ftmd more in need of the cliari table 
contributions of the well difpofed. The number of the old 
and infirm at prefent on the lift, amounts to 31 perfons ; 
while the annual colledion, diftiibuted lafi week, came to no 
more than 42 s. 6vd. Sterling. In this large treafure, defign- 
ed to be incorruptible, beyond the power of moths and ruft, 
there were i s., 5 fixpences, 443 d., and 50 fanhings *. 

The price of provifions in this country has been different, 
at different times. In the reign of King William, it is well 

known 

* In the years 17S2 and 17S3, the incumbent felt experimentally, the wretch, 
cd condition of the poor here, and from the neighbouring countries. Though 
his own income was only, at that time, 47]. 4s. fjd. ; yet, of this pittance, he 
expended, at a moderate calculation, 7 1. Sterling, each of thefe years, in cha- 
rity. Preaching that virtue to others, the forlorn urged their claims to him for 
the pra(5lice of his dodlrine ; nor were their claims, proportionate to his abili- 
ties, refufed. During the above years, his Grace the Duke of Gordon extend- 
ed a humane concern to the diltrefles of the inhabitants, by fupplying them in 
meal and feed-corn, at a mcderate price. No perfon, as far as the writer of 
this ftatiftical article knows, died of want, though, it may be prefumed, that 
a portion of aliment unufually fcanty, might prove the ultimate caufc of the 
death of feveral. As the poor are peculiarly under the protedlion of provi- 
^e.-.ce, and left as a tax upon the affluence and luxury of their more fortunate 
brethren of mankind, it were to be wiflicd, that in pariflies where there are

year 1740. iTie frofts came in September, and the fnow fell fo deep m 0^0- 
ber, that the corn continued buried under it, till January and February follow- 
ing. At that period, the boll of meal rofe to the exorbitant price of 30s. the 
boU: and to increafe the mifer.y of the people, thofe who fold it, frequently 
mixed it with lime, which to many proved fatal. To fupport life, the people 
over the Highlands, in general, were obliged frequently to let blood from their 
cattle, a pradlice now that is never ufed in this country. About 30 years ago, 
thefelfons being favourable, fhe boll of meal fold at the low price of 6s. 8d. 
During.the laft 20 years, the average price, exclufive of 1782 and 17S3, has 
been about i6s. Sterling. The price of black cattle and Iheep, for S years 
backward, has been, upon the whole, high ; cows and calves have fold for 5!., 
^1., and 7I. each; flieep and lambs for los. and 12s. each; oxen for 5I. and 
7l.'each, foraetimes 81. For the 3 laft years, the prices have abated near a. 
third. Poultry fell for 6d. and 7d. each, and pullets for ad. and 3d. each; 
eggs fell at 2d. and z^A. the dozen. The difference between the prices of 
thefe articles at prefent, and in ancient times, cannot be accurately afcertain- 
ed ; but before the year 1745, which forms a rejaaarkable sera in the Highlands, 
oxen fold for al. and 50s.; tows, with their caWes, for 25s., and 20s., and 303.; 
and fheep, with their lambs, as. 6d., and 3 s. 6d. ; and other articles in pro- 
portion. 

From a confideration of the circumftances of the Highlands, which, previ- 
ous to the 1 745, were in fome meafure ftationary, it may be prelumed, that 
during a confiderable time, thefe were the ftandard prices ; but the fpirit of 
pminerce introduced into the S. of Scotland, operates with extended influence.

Among other grievances, it muft not be omitted, that the 
inhabitants in this, and the contiguous diftrids, defcant with 
melancholy declamation, on the heavy and increafing taxation 
impofed by Government. Salt, leather, and iron, whether it 
be, in order to incrcale the revenue, they are, as it were, 
farmed out, and have become a kind of monop[y, or that an 
additional tax is laid upon them ; whatever be the caufe, they 
bitterly complain of the unufual and exorbitant prices of thefe 
articles. It is pleafant to hear them obferve, that from the 
tax upon leather, in particular, they will derive one advan- 
tage : it will diminifli the number of beggars, by confining 
them in winter to their booths to die at leifure, without the 
t/ouble of expofing them, the Scythian Alani did their in-

and makes the prices vary here, according to the changes and fluftuations which

Male fervants receive 3I. Sterling, in the half year, the period for which 
they ufually engage ; boys, aos. and 30s. ; and maids, 20s. and 25 s. Sterling, 
in the half year. The price of day's labour, to men, is 8d., lod., and is. ; and 
to women 6d., and fometiroes S d. In thefe, their meat is fometimes includ- 
ed, but in haryeft, thefe wages are given, exclufive of their vidluals. The 
advanced price of labour, is one of the grievances of which farmers chiefly com- 
plain. They feel, from experience, that, in point of eafe, comfort, and inde, 
pendence, the condition of fervants, is more eligible than that of their roafters. 
The fliort term of engagement, wages immoderately high, infpire them with a 
pride, infolence, and indiflerence, that would frequently require a meek and 
patient fpirit to brock. ISMce in the choice qf their food to fqueamininefs, it 
Kiuft jieither fall (hort, nor exceed that exadt proportion of cookery, which 
their appetites can relifli. Care too muft be taken, that no offence lhall be of-

thtir behaviour is difagreeable, their mafters are at liberty to provide them- 
felves with others, againft the firft term. And feldom do they fail te give 
fcope for this liberty. When the term arrives, then, like birds of paflage, they

• The great road that pafles through the country, to facilitate the march of 
the troops between Perth and Fort-George, was not made till the year 1754 ; 
and now the ftages are fo bad, that few travel it. The roads here, in general, 
;ire wretched beyond defcription ; and yet the people, in terms of the Itatute, 
jLXt annually called out to work at them. This only can be imputed to their 
ijndol^nce. their want of the ncccflarj- implements, and the ignorance, or in-

Statijllcal Account 



As far as tradition can be depended upon, no battle, iior 
fliirmifli of confecjuence, ever happened in this country. The 
only one mentioned, was fought betwreen Macdonald of the 
Ides, and an Alexander Stewart, chief of that name. The 
former, with the greateft part of his men, was killed, and 
from the carnage of that day, the place is ftill called B.ar 
nan Mairbh, the mofs or field of the dead *. 

If any perfons of eminence were ever born in this diftrict, 
time has fwept them from its annals. But, if fuch there have 
been, Mr. George Gordon of Foddaletter, is juftly entitled 
to be ranked in the number. This gentleman's abilities rofe 
beyond that mediocrity, which fometimes acquires celebrity 
without the poffeflion of merit. As a chymift and botanlft, 
his knowledge was confiderable ; and this knowledge he ap- 
plied to the extenfion of the ufeful arts. At an early period 
of life, he difcovered, that by a certain preparation, the ex- 
crefcence of thq ftongs ^nd rocks of the mountains, forms a 

beautiful 

difference of the perfons appointed to fuperintcni thetn. No good- roads c»n 
be expedted according to the prefent mode of management. To effedl this, a 
commutation is abfolutely neceffary. On the ri%'er Ath-fhin, there is a bridge, 
where it is croffed by the great road. Two ottier bridges, one at Delvoran, and 
one at Delnacairn, a little E. of the kirk, would prove eflentially nftful, as 
they would facilitate the water-courfe, which at prefent is frequently inter- 
yuptej, and render the communioation fafe and commodious. Another upon 
Ailnac «t Delnabo, and o^ne upon Qonlafs at Ruthven, yi^ould alfo be very ne- 
pefTary. 

* Cafual rencounters have frequently happened. Manflaughter, murder, and 
i;-obbeiy, at a period not verpr remote, form a diiiinguifliing feature in the cha- 
racfler of the Highlanders. But from the detail of fuch fcenes of barbarity, thi; 
human mind turns away with horror. One inftance, however, it may not be 
improper to mention : In the year i.S75, foon after the eftablilhment of the Re- 
formation in Scotland, , a prieft who had refufed to marry the uncle to the niece, 
■was feized by the ruffian and his party, laid upon a faggot, bound to a ftone, 
and in this manner burnt to death. The remembrance of this attrocious deed 
js ftill preferved in the name of the ftone, which to this day, is called Clach-an(,t 
fiiagairt, or the Prieft's ftone.

Stature &amp;c.-Many have afferted. that \n fize and ftature, 
tne people of modern times, have decreafed confidcrably from 
that of , heir anceftors. The calculations of a Mr. Hennaa 
of the French Academy, upon this fubjeft, are curious and 
cccentnc. This gentleman afferts, that Adam meafured 123 
feet, and Eve 118. To what diminutive dwarfs is the pre- 
lent generation dwindled down, in comparifon of thefe venc 
rable prototypes of the human race. If this account were 
true, the fable of Tithonus Ihould have been realized long 
ago ; and before this period, we mull have been reduced to a 
fizc lefs than that of the grafs-hopper. But laying afide the 
chimeras of conjefture, ^very old man in this diftrift can re- 
collea the time when many of the inhabitants were ftronger, 
bigger, and more robuft than at prefent *. In this and the 
furrounding countries, the mean fize may be about 5 feet 7- 

inches,

Thou art the objfedl of my fecret afFedion." Such accompliftments, under the' 
direftion of an enlightened reafon, might have converted the freebooter into a 
hero. 

* Some little difference may be accounted for, from the operation of natural 
cRufes. When the feafons xvere more favourable, the population lefs crowded, 
when neither a heavy taxation, augmented rents, nor conftant labour cruflied' 
the body, nor enfeebled the mind ; there is no abfurdity in fuppofing, that in 
fuch circumftances, men might have attained to a fuller growth and develope- 
ment of ftature. The tree planted in a kindly foil, ftrikes a ftronger root, and 
fpreads more verdant branchss, than that of the defert, ftintcd in its vegetable

Means of Improvement.-^^om the geographical view o£ 
this country, it will occur to the attentive obferver, that the 
condition of the inhabitants appears to admit of little me- 
lioration. For the improvements of agriculture and manu- 
faftures, the country is ill calculated. Till the country be 
cnclofed, artificial grafs cannot be raifed ; and enclofures 
would be attended with an expenfe difproportionate to their 
circumftances, as the farms are broken and difcontiguous v 
befides, that to fucceed in this branch of hufbandry, they 
would be obliged to difpenfe with Iheep, at prefent their ftaple 
commodity. Upon the fuppofition that fuch a change fliould 
happen, as the people are far from the market, grafs would 
become a drug upon their hands ; and to fubftitute it in place 
of ftraw for provender, would not indemnify them for the 
expenfe. Such reafoning may be fallacious, but it is their 
own, and hitherto has determined them to follow the pradlice 
of their anceftors, to which they have invariably adhered, ex- 
cept in the articles of turnips and potatoes. Of thefe, they 
ralfe a confiderable quantity, what may be equal to two 
months of the annual confumption of the whole inhabi- 
tants. 

ManufaBurts. — In this parifh, there are 4 mills ; the mul- 
tures of thefe together, will fcarce amount to 80 bolls o£ 
meal, and this quantity multiplied by 32, the proportion paid 
to each, will make the whole quantity of vi£tual raifed in 
the country 2560 bolls. When this number is divided by 
3276 individuals, it will be found, that each will have little 
more to live upon, during th^year. than 2 bolls of meal; be-

lidee, that from the whole quantity of viftual, as mentioned 
above, loreign beggars fubtrafl:, at a moderate calculation^ 
60 bolls. No manufaftures of any kind have as yet been 
eftabliflied in this country; and the prefumption is, that a con- 
fiderable time muft elapfe before fuch an event can happen** 

Learned PrqfeJJions. — All retainers to the law, except one 
fherifF-officer and three conilables, if they can be claffed a- 
mong that fpecies of men, feel this country rather cold fof 
their refidence. Never was the folemn brow of a Jufiice of 
Peace feen in the parifli of Kirkmichael, before lalt autumn. 
At that time, two gentlemen, natives, were inftailed in the 
office. Nor is there any danger like the poor flioemaker and 
tailor, that they will not find fufficient employment. A fpi- 
f it of litigation, during many years ago, has prevailed among 
the people. Unfortunately for them, this fpirit was original- 
ly imported by ftrangers, perfons whom the courtefy of the 
country dignified with the name of gentlemen, but as much

* Precluded from an eafy communication with the countries around, living 
in the midft of hills and fcattered defiles, at the diftance of 40 meafured miles 
from the neareft fea-port, the fituation of the people is very unfavourable for 
fuch an attempt ; befides that, they have few materials to work upon. Thai/ 
cattle and fheep, the ftaple commodities, are driven to the S., and fold there, 
and their wool raw and unwrought, to the low countries of Banff and Moray^ 
fliires. Even fliould that fpirit 01 enterprife roufe them, it could not be of 
long duration. The difficulty of getting fuel where the centre of the country 
lies far from mofles, the dearnefs of provifions where the land feldom produces 
a fufficiency to fupport its inhabitants, would dampen their efforts, as the/ 
would foon experience the manifeft advantage of others over them, in the com- 
petition of the diftant market. Before the year 1745, that aera of innovation 
in the Highlands, every one almoft in this country, like the famous Crufoe, was 
his own artifan. No later than laft fummer, a flioemaker from Edinburgh, and 
a tailor from Dundee, were obliged to defert the country for want of emploj^- 
ment. Where there are almoft no handicraftfmen, there can be no apprentices. 
In a country fo remote from that element, there can be no feamen.

^;^,W..-The domefticated animals here, have no pecu- 
liarity to diftinguifti them from fuch as may be met with al- 
xnoft in every other part of the Highlands. Thefe have been 
defcribed already. The wild oqes are deer, foxes, badgers, 
polecats, otters, and hares. In former times the ravenou, 
Jvolf +, and the bounding chamois, were numerous in the 
Grampian mountains J. As a proof of this, it may not be 

unacceptable 

. The gentlemen of the law may be offended at the fuggeftion, b.rt it is 
much to be defired, that proprietors would interpofe their authority, by ap- 
pointing fenfible a*d impartial men to decide upon the differences anfing a- 
p,ong their people. Such, or the like expedient, might preferve induftnous fa- 
niilies from ruin, and the unwary parents, from the dangerous impofit.on of 
pettyfoggers. 

+ The laft faid to be killed in this country, was about 150 years ago ; yet it 
is probable that wolves were in Scotland for fome time after that period, as tho 
laft killed in Ireland was in 1709. 

X It has been already mentioned, that the Grampian mountains bound this 
parilh toward the W. From this country they ftretch in a continued range, al-

„ In thefe mountains, it is afferted by the country people, 
that there is a fmall quadruped which they call famh,. In 
fummer mornings it iilues from its lurking places, emUtmg 
a kind of glutinous matter fatal to horfes. if they happen to 
e.t of the grafs upon which it has been depofited. It is fome- 
vvhat larger than a mole, of a brownifti colour, with . arge 
head difproportionate to its body. From tbis deformed^ap- 
pearance, and its noxious quality, the word feems to have 
been transferred to denote a monfter. a cruel mifchievous per- 
fon, who, in the Gaelic language, is ufually called a famh- 
fhear. Other quadrupeds once indigenous to tlie Grampian

There is alfo a fmall kind of reptile called bratag, covered with a downy 
hair, alternately fpotted into black and white ; if cattle happen to eat it, they 
generally fwell, and fometimes die. It has the fame effedt upon flieep. The 
birds in this parifh are of the fame genus and fpecies with thofe of the neigh- 
boi ing countries; fuch as moorfowl, partridges, wild duck, crows, magpies 
wood pigeons, hawks, kites, owls, herons, fnipes, king's fiflier, fwallows, fpar- 
rows, blackbird, and thruOi. In the higher hills, are ptarmagans. In ";hc fteep 
and abrupt rocks of Glenavon, the eagle builds its eyry; and during the 
latter end of fpring, and beginning of fummer, is very deftrudive to kids, 
lambs, and fawns. Some of the more adventurous fliepherds, watching them 
at this feafon of depredation, frequently fcale the rugged rocks, where they 
nefcle, and fhare with their young in the fpoil. Till of late years that his fe- 
queflered haunts have been difturbed by the intrufion of more numerous flocks 
of fheep, the black cock, or galius Scoticanus, was wont to hail the daw» of 
the vernal morning amidft the heaths of this country. If, like the feathered 
tribe in SSo^, this tine bird could articulate, he soight complain with the Peet,

Wood, Shruhs, Herbs, &amp;c.-At a period perhaps not very 
temote, this country was covered with wood I- the lulls 
and moffes by which it is bordered, fir-root xs found m fuch 
abundance, that it fupplies the inhabitants with a warm and 
luminous light during the tedious nights of wmter lre- 
quently large trunks of the fir are found at a confiderable 
depth below the furface. Occupied in this employment, many 
bf the poorer people drive the root to the low country, from 
which they bring meal, iron, fait, and other articles in ex- 
change ; and by this mode of induftry, earn a precarious fub- 
fiftence for themfelves and families during the fummer fea- 
fons. No fir-wood, however, at prefent exifts, except a few 
fcattered trees in the fouthern extremity, upon the banks of 
the Avon. The only woods to be feen, are birch and alder, 
and thefe covering but a fmall extent of ground. Till of late, 
groves of alder, in which were trees of pretty large dimen- 
fions, grew, in feveral places along the banks of the river, 
but now they are almoft cut down, and will foon be totally 
confumed. Thefe, with a little hazel, thorns, haw-thorns, 
holly, willows, and mountain-aQi, are the only fpecies of 
wood that ftill remain. Indigenous Ihrubs of different kinds 
grow wild in the hills, that carry fruit, fuch as wild ftraw-

if the fwallow may be excepted, the cuckoo and lapwing, " tiring its echoes 
with unvaried cries," are the only migratory birds that pay their annual vifits 
to this country ; and after a fliort ftay, wing their flight to more genial cli- 
mates. The former feldom appears before the beginning of May, and often itsy 
arrival is announced by cold blafts from the N., and ftiowers of fnow, which 
are confidered as an aufpicious omen of the approaching fummer. This tem- 
porary rigour of the weather is called by the people, glas-fliiontachd na cuach,'

In the beginning of hfirvell, when thcfe fruits are ripe, they 
are fought for with avidity by the poorer children, to whom, 
during the feafon of their maturity, they fuppiy a portion of 
food, it is probable, that formerly, if at any time the la- 
bours of the chafe proved unfuccefaful, even tlie men and 
women of ancient Caledonia allayed their hunger by thefe 
Ipontaneous produftions of nature. Dio Caffius exprclsly af- 
fertSy that our anceftor's made ufe of a ycgetable preparation, 
by which they repreffed, for a time, that importunate appe- 
tite. Caefar feems to allude to it ii his defcripEion of the 
Chara. The foft inflected Chara of the Roman, evidently points 
to the Cor of the Caledonians. Cor fignifies excellent, fuper- 
eminent, a very expreffive and appropriate name, if it fup- 
plied the place of food. It grows a little below the furface 
&amp;f the ground, and fpreads laterally into feveral ramifica- 
tions, carrying larger or fmaller knobs according to the foil, 
and at irregular dfilances. In fpring it protrudes a fmall 
greenifti ftalk, and in fuitimer bears a beautiful flower, which 
changing into pods, contains feed, when the root becotnes in- 
lipid and lofes its virtue. The country people, even at pre* 
fent, are wont to fteep it among water, where having conti- 
nmed for fome days, it becomes a pleafant and nutritive 
drink. Till of late that the little wood of the kind has been 
better preferved, the inhabitants ufed in the month of March 
to extiaft a liquid from the birch, called* fion-na-uifg, a 
bheatha, which they confidered as very falubrlous and condu- 
cive to longevity. By an eafy metaphor, the name has been

fcience of botany, as to be able to enumerate the various plants and herbs that 
grow in this diftridt. He believes few uncommon ones are to be met with, 
unlefs among the Grampian mountains, which might afford a rich field of ob- 
fervation to the naturalift: The plant called an dubh-chofach, black footed, or 
maiden hiiir, is frequently gathered among the ■ woods and rocks, and ufed as a 
tea in afthmatic complaints. Another plant, grows in feveral parts of the panfli* 
and rifes on a ftalk near a feet in height. It fpreads into fmall branches, with 
lliarp-pointed leaves of a pale green, and bears a pretty large berry, red at firft, 
but changing into a livid hue as it ripens. Perhaps it may be the folanum" 
fomniferum of the hiftorian Buchanan, by the aid of which, infufed m the 
drink, and mixed with the meat prefented by King Duncan to the Danes, he 
tnd his. generals gained a decifive viftory over that barbarous people. This 
berry is ftill confidered as poifonous by the country people, and they cautioufly 
abiiain from it. 

Modern fcepticifra rejetfts the above paffage of the hiftory, and conCders it as 
fictitious ; but in ancient times when the wants of the inhabitants were few, 
gratified fiom the fpontaneoas produdlions of the field, or the beafts of the fo-

able knowledge of plants and hetbs, together with their various and fpecific 
qualities : befides that agriculture being in a rude ftate, and many of the pre- 
fent domefticated animals unknown, owing to thefe caufes, the vegetable race 
would arrive at a higher degree of perfeftion, and their virtues would confe- 
qucntly operate with more energy and effect. In the lift of plants, muft be 
reckoned the feamrog, or the wild trefoil, in great eftipaation of old with the 
Druids. It is ftill confidered as an anodyne in the difeafes of cattle : from this

Language. common idiom of this countr)', Is a dia- 
lea of the ancient Celtic, which in remote ages pervaded the 
fouthern and weftern regions of Europe ; and together with 
the Gothic, divided this quarter of the globe into two radi- 
cal and diftina languages. Though the latter, owing to the 
better fortune of the people who fpoke it, has prevailed over 
the former, yet may a confiderable portion of the roots of 
feveral modern languages be traced to a Celtic original. This, 
however; is not the place for fuch difcuffions. The dialed 
fpoken in this country is growing daQj more corrupted, by 
the admiffion of Anglicifms, and a number of terms unknown 
-to the fimple arts, of the ancient Highlanders. Such is the 
folly or bad tafte of the people, that they gratify a prepofter- 
ous vanity from this kind of innovation. It may therefore 
be well fuppofed, that the language is upon the decline ; that 
the harmony of its cadence is gradually changing, and the 
purity of its ftrufture mixing with foreign idioms. The 
:^dung people fpeak Gaelic and Englifli indifferently, and 
with equal impropriety. Their uncouth articulation of dif- 
cordant words and jarring founds, refembles the mufick of 
frogs in a Dutch canal, Jiarfli and difgufting to the Attic ear 
of a genuine Highlander. Some of the old people fpeak the 
Gaelic, and confequently with a degree of propriety. Oh 
fubjefts of common occurrence, they are at no lofs for ex- 
preffion in well chofen and natural language. Hence,' it may 
be inferred, that the pariOi of Kirkmichael fpoke the fame^ 
dialed of the Celtic that is now fpokeri in Badenoch, making 
allowance for fome little difference, in point of pronunciation.

Supcrjlitions, 

* The feveral branches of t!ie Celtic now exifting in Europe, are a venerable 
monument of antiquitj. Independent of the intrinfic excellence, were all the 
words contained in them digcfted and formed into a didionary, it might throw 
canfiderable light upon the hiftory of a people, whofe manners, cuftoais, arts, 
and fciences, the revolution of ages Jias fnitched from authentic records. Mr. 
Gibbon in his Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, obferves, that there i? 
room for a very interefting work, to lay oi)en the connexion between the lan- 
guage and the manners of a people. Few languages are better calculated for 
this purpofe than l;he Celtic. Every one acquainted with it, and endued with 
a tafte to relifli its beautie?, muit acknowledge its energy and defcriptive powers. 
Equally adapted to melt, or to roufe, it has a ftyle appropriated to the variou? 
paflions. Inftead of conveying feeble ideas, it exhibits lively pidtures. Sono- 
rous and impreffive, when the occafion requires, it penetrates the inmoft re- 
cefles of the foul. When the Greek and Roman languages were in their in- 
fancy, the Celtic lent them its aid ; for., many wprds ef the two former are ob- 
viouHy derived from the latter. Jn a period then of fuch enterprife and im- 
provement as the prefent, when phiiofophic curiofity explores the remoteft cor- 
ners of the globe, to enlarge the circle of human knowledge, it is fomewhat 
extraordinary, that a language fo anciertt, ,a.nd once fo widely diffufed, lliould 
be configned to it§ fate, without one public effort to preferve its relicks and 
tranfmit them to poflerity. To accomplifii fuch a defirable objedl, would not 
be unworthy of tlie patronage of the Highland Society of London. As that re- 
fpeftable body eonfifts ef noblemen and gentlemen of independent fortunes, a 
fmall fliare of the fupeifluity of their affluence, might be fuccefsfuUy employed 
to arrell what ftill remains of the Celtic, and retrieve it froin oblivion. Several 
attempts of tliis kind have been made, but they have Jbeen partial and im- 
perfedt. There is ftill wanting a work to embrace the whole, and which 
cannot be acconipliflied wxthout the patronage and munificence of the great. 
If the Emprefa of RuffiaJias i'cnt learned men to collect and explain the jar- 
gons fpoken by the various tribes of barbarians inhabiting the inhofpitable Cau- 
cafus, fliould not fuch a liberal example engage the attention, and excite the 
imitation of a more refined and civilized people? A dicfllonary of the Gaelic 
is now in contemplation in Argyllfliire, and the letters of its alphabet are di- 
vided among an equal number of clergymen ; but as thefe gentlemen are con^ 
fined to a particular county, and confider . their own as the ftandard dialed} of

Superjlitions, Ghojls, Fairies, Genii, &amp;c.— In a ftatiftical 
account, even the vveakneffes of the human mind may afford 
fome little entertainment.' That fear and ignorance incident 
fo a rude ftate, have always, been proiudive of opinions, 
rites, and obfervances which enlightened reafon difclaims. 
But among the vulgar, who have not an opportunity of culti- 
vating this faculty, old prejudices endeared to them by the 
creed of their anceftors, will long continue to maintain their 
influence. It may therefore be eafily imagined, that this 
country has its due proportion of that fuperfcltion "which ge- 
nerally prevails over the Highlands. Unable to account for 
the caufe, they confider the effeds of times and feafons, as 
certain and infallible. The modti in her increafe, full growth, 
and in her wane, are with them the emblems of a rifiug, 
flourilhing, and declining fortune. At the laft period of her 
revolution, they carefully avoid to engage in any bufmefs of 
importance ; but the firft and the middle they feize with a- 
vidity, prefaging the moft aufpiciotls iffue to their undertak- 
ings. Poor Martinus Scriblerus never more anxioufly watch»» 
ed the blowing of the weft wind to fecure an heir to his ge- 
nius, than the love-fick fwain and his nymph for the coming 
of the new moon to be noofed together in matrimony. Should 
the planet happen to be at the height of her fplendour when 
the ceremony is performed, their- future life wijJ be a fcene 
of feftivity, and all its paths ftrewed over with rofe-buds of 
delight. But when her tapering horns are turned towards 
the N., paflion becomes froll-bound, and feldom thaws till 
the genial feafon again approaches. From the mgon, they

^ot only draw prognoftications of the weather, but accord- 
ing to their creed, alfo difcovcr future events. There they 
arc dimly pourtrayed, and ingenious illufion never fails in 
the explanation. The veneration paid to this planet, and the 
opinion of its influences, are obvious from the meaning ftill 
affixed to fome v^rords of the Gaelic language. In Druidic 
niythologj^, when the circle of the moon was complete, for- 
tune then promifed to be the moft propitious. Agreeably to 
this idea, rath, which fignifies in Gaelic, a wheel or circle, 
is transferred to lignify fortune. They fay, " ata rath air," 
he is fortunate. The wane, when the circle is diminifhing, 
and confequently unlucky, they call mi-rath. Of one that 
is unfortunate, they fay, " ata mi-rath air." Deas uil, and 
Tuath uil, are fynonimous exprelBons, allufive to a circular 
movement obferved iii the Iruidic worfliip. 

Nor is it to the moon alone that they diredl their regards ; 
almofl: every feafon of the year claims alhare of their fuper- 
ftition: Saimh-theinc, or Hallow Eve; Beil-teine, or the firft 
day of May ; and Oidhch' Choille, or the firft night of Janu- 
ary. The rites obferved at Saimh-theine, and Beil-teine, arc 
well known, and need not be defcribed. But on the firft night 
of January, they obferve, with anxious attention, the difpo- 
fition of the atmofphere. As it is calm or boifterous; as the- 
wind blows from the S. or the N. ; from the E. or the W., 
they prognofticate the nature of the weather, till the conclu- 
fion of the year. The firft night of the New Year, when 
the wind blows from the W., they call dar-na coille, the night 
of the fecundation of the trees and from this circumftance 
has been derived the name of that night in the Gaelic * lan- 
guage.

The fuperftitious regard paid to particular times and fea- 
fons, is not more prevalent in this country, than the belief 
in the exiftence of ghofts. On the fequeftcred hill, and in 
the darkfome valley, frequently does the benighted traveller 
behold the vifionary femblance of his departed friend, per- 
haps of his enemy. The former addreffes him in the lan- 
guage of afFeftion ; if danger is approaching, he is warned 
to prepare againft it, or the means of avoiding it difclofed. 
By the latter, he is attacked with the vehemence of refent- 
ment. The inhabitants of this, and the vifitant from the 
other world, engage in furious combat. For a while, the 
viftory is in fufpenfe. At length the ghoft is overthrown, 
and his violence appeafed : a few traits of his life upon earth 
are defcribed. If he Hole a ploughfliare from his neighbour, 
the place where it lies concealed is pointed out. His anta- 
gonift is requefted to reftore it to the owner ; and if he fails,

Not more firmly eftabliftied in this country, is the belief 
ia ghofts, than that in fairies. The legendary records of 
fancy, tranfmitted from age to age, have affigned their man- 
fions to that cMs of genii, in detached hillocks covered with 
verdure, fituated on the hanks of purling brooks, or fur- 
rounded by thickets of wood. Thefe hillocks are called fioth- 
dhunan, abbreviated fioth-anan, from fioth, peace, and dun, 
a mou»d. They derive this name from the praftice of the 
Druids, who were wont occafionally to retire to green emi- 
nences to adminifler juflice, eftablilh peace, and compofe 
differences between contending parties. As that venerable 
order taught a Saoghl hal, or world beyond the prefent, their 
followers, when they were no more, fondly imagined, that 
feats, where they esercifed a virtue fo beneficial to mankind, 
were ftill inhabited by them in their difembodled (late. lu

* If one were allowed to indulge in cowjedlure, and reafon from analogy, it 
might be alTerted with an appearance of probabilitj, that the dryads and ha- 
madryads of the Romans, were the fame with the druids and druidefles of the 
Ccltx. It is imiverfally acknowledged, that the dryads of the Greeks and Ro- 
mans derive their name from the Greek word Ifut, fignifying an oak, and druid, 
in the Celtic, from darach, or deni, to which the fame meaning is affixed. Ha- 
madryad, is evidently derived, from oi', or oigh, a virgin, always afperated af- 
t«r the prefix article of the oblique cafe in the Celtic. Notwithftanding the 
progreflive increafe of knowledge and proportional decay of fuperftition in the 
Highlands, thefe genii arc ftill fuppofed by many of the people to exift in the 
woods and fequeftered valleys of the mountains, where they frequently appear 
to the lonely traveller, clothed in green, with diflievelled hair floating over their 
Ihoulders, and with faces more blooming than the vennil blufh of a fummer 
morning. At night in particular, when fancy aflimilates to its own precon- 
ceived ideas, every appearance, and every found, the wandering enthufiaft is 
frequently entertained by their mufick, more melodious than he ever before 
heard. It is curious to obferve, how much this agreeable deiolion correfponds 
\y\th. the fuperftitjous opinion of the Romans, concerning the fame clafs ol~ genii, 
reprefented under different names. The Epicurean Lucretius defcribes the cre- 
dulity in the following beautiful verfes : 

Hsec loca capripede-s fatyros, nymphafque tenere 
Finitimi pingunt, et fauftos efle loquuntur ; 
^0Tum no(flivago ftrepitu, ludoque jocanti

The fame credulity that gives air-formed inhabitants to 
„.een hillocks and folitary groves, has given th-^ Poft-n 
!f genii to rivers and fountains. The prefidmg fpmt of that 
LLt, in Celtic mythology was called Ne.the. The prx 
^itive of this word, fignifies to wafh, or pur:fy wxth water 
In the name of fome rivers, it is ftiU retained, as m the 
river Neithe of Abernethy in Strathfpey. To th.s day, 
fountains are regarded with particular veneratxon over every 
part of the Highlands. The fick who refort to them for 
health, addrefs their vows to the prefiding powers, and: of- 
fer prefents to conciliate their favour. Thefe prefents gene- 
rally confift of a fmall piece of money, or a few fragrant 
flowers. The fame reverence, in ancient times, feems to 
have been entertained for fountains by every people m Eu- 
rope. The Romans who extended their worlhip to almoft 
every objeft in nature, did not forget in their ritual, the 
homage due to fountains. It is to this, Horace alUides in his 
addrefs to his limpid fountain of Blandufia.

About 50 years ago, a clergyman in the aeighbourhood, whofe faith was 
more regulated by the fcepticifm of philofophy, than the credulity of fuperfti- 
tion, could net be prevailed upon to yield h|B affent to the opinion of the times. 
At length, however, he felt from experience, that he doubted what he ought 
to have believed. One night as he was returning home, at a late hour, from a 
prefbytefy, he was feized by the fairies, and carried aloft into the air. Through 
fields of xther and fleecy clouds he journied many a mile, deicrying, like San-^ 
cho Panza on his Clavileno, the earth far diftant below him, and no bigger than 
a nut-Hiell. Being thus fufficiently convinced of the realit;jr of their cxiftence, 
they let him down at the door of his own houfe, where he afterward often re- 
cited to the^vondering circle, the marvellous tale of his adventure.

Near the kirk of this parifh, there is a fountain once l)igh- 
ly celebrated, and anciently dedicated to St. Michael. Many 
a patient have its waters rcftored to healtli, and many more 
have atteftcd the efiicacy of their virtues. Bnt, as the pre- 
fiding power is fometimes capricious, and apt to defert his 
charge, it now lies negleded, choked with weeds, unho- 
noured, and unfrequented. In better days it was not fo ; for 
the winged guardian under the femblance of a fly, was never 
abfent from his duty. If the fober matron wifhed to know 

the 

fliipped rivers, and had no divinities appropriated to them. Several ancient au- 
thorities, however, might be adducx-d to evince the contrary. Gildas exprefsly 
fays, " Ut omittam," talking of the Britons, " montes ipfos, aut colles, aut flu- 
Vios, quibns divinus honor a casco tunc populo cumulabatur." The vulgar in 
many parts of the Highlands, even at prefent, not only pay a facred regard to 
particular fountains, but are firmly perfuaded that certain lakes are inhabited 
by fpirits. In Strathfpey, there is a lake Hill called Loch-nan Spioradan; the 
lake of fpirits. Two of thefe.are fuppofed frequently to make their appearance, 
theonf under the fonir of a horfe beautifully caparifoned, with golden trap- 
pings. With the bit of his bridle, the anti-conjurer of this parifli expels jea- 
loufy, and cures other maladies of the mind. The other under that of .a bull 
docile as Jupiter wafting Europa over the Hellefpont. The former is called,' 
an each uifg, the horfe of the water ; the latter, an taru uifg, the buU of the' 
water. The mhaidan mhare, or mermaid, is another fpirit fuppofed to re- 
fide in the waters. Before the rivers are fweiled by heavy rains, flie is fre- 
quently feen, and all the attributes of a beautiful virgin afcribed to -.hat part 
of her perfon that is vifible. Her figure is enchanting, and l.£r voice melodious 
as that of the Syrer^. But fair as Qie is, her ajjpearance never fails to announce 
fome melancholy accident on her native element. It is always confidered as a 
fui'e prognoftication of drowning. 

In Celtic mythology to the above named, is added a fourth fpirit. When the 
waters are agitated by a violent current of wind, and ftreams are fwept from 
their furface and driven before the blaft, or whirled in circling eddies aloft m 
the air, the vulgar, to this day, confider this phenomenon as the ^ '^^St of the 
angry fpirit opera,ting upon that element. They call it by a very expreffive 
name, the mariach flune, or the rider of the ftorra. Anvona is alfo reckoned 
as a divinity of the waters, derived from anfadh, a ftorm or hurricane, a com- 
pound from an, a particle of privation, aad feadh, ferenity, tranquillity.

Among the branches into which the mofs-grown trunk of 
fuperflition divides itfelf, may be reckoned witchcraft and 
magic. Thefe, though decayed and withered by time, ftill 
retain fome faint traces of their ancient verdure. Even at 
prefent, witches are fuppofed, as of old, to ride on broom- 
llicks through the air. In this country, the l2th of May is 
one of their feftivals. On the morning of that day, they are 
frequently feen dancing on the furface of the water of Avon, 
brufliing the dews of the lawn, and milking cows in their 
fold. Any uncommon ficknefs is generally attributed to 
their demoniacal praaices. They make fields barren or fer-

held by the unthinking crowd. If the infirmities of years, and the diftance o 
his refidence did not prevent him, he would ftill pay his devotional vilits to the

aerial career. It is the good fortune, however, of this coun- 
try to be provided with an anti-conjurer that defeats both 
them and their fable patron in their combined efforts. His 
fame is widely diffufed, and wherever he goes, crcfcit eundo. 
If the fpoufe is jealous of her hufband, the anti-conjurer is 
confulted to reftore the affeftions of his bewitched heart. 
If a near connexion lies confined to the bed of ficknefs, it

of the anti.conjurer. If a perfon happens to be deprived of

by the magic charms of the anti-conjurer. If a farmer 
lofes his cattle, the houfes muft be purified with water 
fprinkled by him. In fearching for the latent mifchief, this

Few things feem too arduous for his abilities ; and though, 
like Paracelfus, he bars not as yet boafted of having dif-

Herculem ; the outlines already given, will enable fancy to 
draw the portrait. 

Dr.A.-.Since the year 174S, there is a confiderable change 
on the drefs of th^ people of this diftrid. By a fingular kmd 
of policy, as if rebellion lurked in the fhape and colour of a 
coat, at the above period, the ancient drefs was profcnbed 
and none du^ft wear it without running the rilk of a rigor- 
ovis profecution. It was confcquently fuperfeded by the Low 
Country drefs. To the ancient braccae, or truifh* and belted 
plaid, fucceeded ftrait breeches, and an awkward coat of a 
uniform colour ; fomctimes a long furtout dangling down to 
the heels, encumbrlng the freedom of motion. The barbar- 
ous policy of Edward the Firft, did not more efFeftually de- 
ftroy the fpirit of the indignant Wellh, by the murder of 
their bards, than the prohibition of their anciejit garb, that 
of the poor Highlanders. In the enthufiafm of patriotifm, 
Mr. Frafer of Lovat got the prohibitory aft repealed, in or- 
der, according to his 'own emphatic words, " to divert the 
minds of the people from Tranfatlantic notions." Let meta- 
phyficians, if they choofe, trace the connexion. But, thougU 
this refpeaable gentleman, with the view of making them 
good fubjefts, procured liberty to the Highlanders of expofmg 
their naked pofteriors to the north wind, on their bleak 
mountains, few have ayailed themfelves of the privilege. 
Habit recojiciles them tp .the prefent, an,d they feem to have 
no defire of refuming their ancient garb. The blue bonnet, 
however, with the exception of fome round hats, ftill main- 
tains its ground. Since ihe year 1745, the women too, like 
the men, have altered confiderably in their apparel. Before 
that period, they wore fomctimes white blankets covering

their heads, fometlmes their fhoulders, drawn forward by 
their hands, furrounded on each fide by a frld. Thefe, as 
fafhion varied, were fucceeded by barred plaids, or blankets, 
"Where different colours blended, crofling each other at right 
angles, fomewhat diftant, and bearing a fquare fpace in the 
middle. Wearied of barred plaids, they betook themfelves 
to Stirling ones, and now duffle cardinals begin to have the 
afcendant. Formerly their hair flowed in eafy ringlets ever 
their flioulders; not many years ago, it was bound behind in- 
to a cue, now it fpreads into a protuberance on the forehead, 
fupported by cufliions ; fometimes, it is plain, and fplit in 
the middle. But who can defcribe the caprice of female or- 
nament more various than the changes of the moon ! 

Manner of Living, — Not more than 50 years ago, their 
mode of living in this country was different from what it is 
at prefcnt. Places that were at that time wafte, are now plant- 
ed with inhabitants. And though flieep, upon the whole, be 
more numerous than formerly ; yet they are chiefly the pro- 
perty of thofe who occupy the out-flcirts, and to whom the 
hills and glens lie more convenient. In the centrical places, 
the farms are enlarged, at leaft as much as the nature of the 
ground can admit; confequently the fmaller tenants are fewer, 
and live lets at their eafe : but previous to the above period, 
even cottagers kept a few flieep, becaufe the hill pafture was 
a common, and there were few of any defcription who did 
mot occafionally feed upon fl^fli. But at prefent, unlefs it be 
at Chriftmfls, or when any little feftivals are celebrated, the 
fold is kept facred for the market, in order to make money 
to fupplj' the exigencies of the family, and fatisfy the many 
deniands to which it is expofed, from bad feafons, precarious 
crops, and increaling taxes ; befides that, the luxury of the

CharaBer, &amp;c.-The charader of a people never fails to 
change with their changing condition. In contemplatmg 
them at the extreme points of a period of 70 or 80 years, it 
would be as difficult to recognife their identity, as that of Sir 
John Cutler's worfted ftocldngs, when fcarcely an atom of 
the original texture remained. Not further removed than 
the more dlftant of thefe extremes, the people of this country 
were generous and hofpitable. If they were occafionally fub- 
jea to the foibles, they poffeffed the virtues of genuine High- 
landers. If they refented injuries with vehemence and paf- 
fion, their breafts felt the glow of affedion and friendfliip.

T.hich, in a certain degree has pervaded everj corner of the

traaivc, there will be many candidates- To aid them in this 
career of an^bition, it mull be acknowledged, in alleviation of 
their bias, that they have had models of imitation not unwor- 
thy of the doarines of a Machiavel. Unfortunately for them, 
thefe models have been ftrangers, and of that rank in life who 
have always the moft powerful influence in making profelytes 

among the vulgar. 

Such are the caufes to which it muft be imputed, that there 
is fo little difcrimination to be obferved in the charafter of 
the people of this country ; for, where one objed is purfued, 
the means of attainment will be generally uniform. Sufpend- 
cd between barbarifm and civilization, the mind is never fo 
ftrongly influenced by virtue, as it is attraded by the mag- 
netifm of vice. In this view, however, they are not Angu- 
lar from their neighbours. From a combination of caufes, 
particularly high taxation, and increafing commerce, avarice 
and felfifhnefs muft neceffarily conftitute a prominent feature 
in the charafter of many. At the fame time, there may fl,ill - 
be found the ufual proportion of perfons of a different charac- 
ter, confpicuous for honour and integrity, humane and bene- 
volent, juft and upright in their tranfadlions.. 

Mifcellaneous Ohfervations. — It has been obferved, that the 
centrical parts of this country lie at a confiderable diftance 
from mofs, which is yeaily diminiftiing in proportion to the 
eonfumption. From the increafe of population, and as the 
.natural woods are every where decaying, the period is ap-. 
proaching, when the Highlands muft fenfibly feel the difficul- 
ty of procuring the necefl'ary accommodation of fuel. To 
anticipate fuch an event, is an objecl that peculiarly calls for 
the attention of proprietors. There are few of this defcrip- 
_iion in the Highlands, who are not poffefled of confiderable

By converting the wafte ground to this purpofe, the rent  : 
the proprietors would increafe, while the farmer would be 
fupplied in fuel, and materials for building. Plantations of 
fir fo extenfive, may appear an arduous undertaking ; but by 
giving farmers long leafc s, indemnifying them at removal, 
appropriating a portion of the rent for the purpofe, and va- 
rious methods that might be devifed, it might be fuccefsful- 
ly carried into execution ; and when accompliflied, would be 
worthy of ar great and patriotic proprietor. It has been af- 
ferted, that mofs grows ; but this is a fallacy too obvious to 
be credited. Being the produftion of wood and moifture, it 
is well known from experience, that when the component in- 
gredients are once exhaufted, the fubftance itfelf cannot be 
reproduced. Upon the formation of mofs, there is a curious 
fad mentioned by Lord Cromarty, and recorded in the 3th 
volume of the Abridgement of the Philofophical Tranfac

No complaint feems to be more univerfal over the High- 
lands, nor in this country iu particular, than thp increafing 
nclemency of the feafons. Modem philofophers attribute 
this phenomenon to the vaft fhoals of ice accumulatmg m the 
northern feas. But whatever be the caufe, the opinion of 
the efFea prevails among the people. Since the year X768 
they obferve. that the fummers are colder, and produfttve of 
greater quantities of rain, than was remembered in the fame 
Lee of time, during any preceding period. The affernon, 
though conjeaural, appears to be founded upon probabdxty. 
Even within thefe to laft years, the beds of brooks and ri- 
vers are confxderably enlarged, and much of the contiguous 
grounds deftroyed by the floods. The trouts, that former y 
fwarmed in lakes and rivers, are exceedingly decreafed. The 
few migratory birds that vifit the country, are later m their 
arrival, and fooner take their departure: The hum of the 
mountain bee is not fo frequently heard: even the mfeft tribes 
that fluttered in the air of a warm fummer, are lefs prolifick 
than ufual. In Glenavon, of this parifli, are moffes, near 
3000 feet above the level of the fea, full of the fir root ; 
where no wood at prefent, owing to the cold, could grow. 
Some of the higheft hills in the Grampian delert, are deno- 
mmated from the wood which formerly grew upon them, 
fuch as beinn a chaorin, the mountain of the fervice tree. 
Are thefe then appearances the refult of a temporary ceiTa-

V William the Norman, after the conquefl of England, furveyed that coun- 
try, and committed the admeafurement to Doorafday Book, defigncd to be a 
permanent record of the nature and value of the foil ; that gradaticn of offices, 
and thofe inftitutions which he embraced in his political fcheme. The imita- 
tion of a model that might be fo conducive to promote the welfare of the great 
body of the people employed in agriculture, fliould perhaps, with that varia-. 
tion required by circumftances, be in fome meafure adopted by the proprie- 
tors in Scotland. It is well known that the value of land muft rife or fall, ac- 
cording to the flourifhing or declining condition of the ftate. Reafon didtates 
that it is by this criterion the rents of a landlord ought to be regulated. Whea 
at a certain term lands are to be let, and expofed, as it were to a public fale, 
the higheft biddder to have the preference, it muft occur, that in fuch a colli- 
fion of paffions, and jarring interefts, as muft neceflarily arife upon thofe occa- 
lions, the defperate and unprincipled will frequently be preferred to the honelE 
and induftrious ; befides that, the rents of fome farms will be low and mode- 
rate, while that of others will be high and exorbitant. To prevent, therefore, 
this inequality, and to extend diftributivc juftice to every individual, proprie- 
tors fhould not only furvey their properties, but alfo affix a value to the farms, 
according to the value of the producSiohs at the time, and the probable conti- 
nuance of that value. Every circumftance of convenience and inconvenience, 
whether with regard to fuel, the nature of the foil, and the condition of the 
farm, fliould likewife be taken under confideration, and a rent proportionate 
affixed. Judicious men acquainted with the place, and obliged, by proper 
fandlions, to obferve a ftri'dl impartiality, would perhaps be the moft proper to 
accomplidi fuch a delirable objedl. Thefe hints may appear chimeral, but there 
would be no harm in the experiment ; and, if pradticable, might prove highly- 
advantageous, both to the proprietor and tenant, by promoting their reciprocal 
jnterefts. Such a plan, without having recourfe to the levelling principle of 
modern innovations, might have a happy tendency in diffufing the comforts of 
life more equally, and at the fame time, maintain that diftindion of ranks 
Jieceflary to the exifteiice of fociety.

IN the year i753, the old parifc of Saddel and Skipnefs, 
1 with a large track of country between them, were dif- 
joined from the pariflies of Killean and Kilcalmonel, and ered- 
ed into an united parifh. It retains its ancient names. Saddel 
feems to be derived from its pHncipal objed the monaftery, 
fignifying the plain of the priefts, by an eafy contraaion of 
the word Sagairt, I e. prieft, and dail, a plain. The other 
name Skipnefs, is evidently from the Norfe language, and fig- 
hifies ftiip-point, alluding prebably to its being a ftation of 
the Danifti fleet, when this pairt of the kingdom was under 
their dominion. This parifh is fituated on the eaft coaft of 
the peninfula of Kintyre. It extends about 25 miles in length, 
and a miles mean breadth. The face of the country is, in

f liage. The hills are neither fteep. barren, nor rocky, but 
nfe^raduallj from the fea-ftore, with an eafy afcent. are flat 
at the heights, and covered with hearh, and grafs intermixed; 
fo tliat cattle, as well as Iheep, graze upon them even in win- 
ter. The arable land on the declivities is not of a good qua- 
lity, being a mixture af mofs, clay, and gravel, or till. But 
the low ground near the fhore, and in the glens, is warm and 
fertile. It is remarkable, that all the glens run in the fame 
direaion from N. W. to S. E., and are covered near the bot- 
tom or lower ends with flat points jetting into the fea, and 
forming beauuful bays. This happy expofure gives them the 
benefit of the early fun, and during the whole day ; a cir- 
cumftance extremely favourable to vegetation. During th^ 
fummer and autumn, the degree of heat in thefe glens is verj 
great, but they are frequently refreflied with drizzling rains 
and flying fhowers ; the good efFeds of which, conliantly fol- 
low; for, though the fowing here be later two weeks or more 
than in the uplands, yet the harvelt is- fooner over, and the 
grain much heartier and better filled. For this reafon, a. 
mong others, all the farms (except a few moor farms) are' fet 
off fo as to have a /bare cf hill and dale, with accefs to the 
Ihore. The farm-houfes are. in general, very decent, parti- 
cularly thofe lately built, of which there is a great number, 
and are judicioufly placed near the middle of the grounds, fo 
as to have the belt land between them and the fliore, on which 
they lay out all their dung and what fea- weed they can find, 
as fitted for their principal crops, bear, potatoes, peafe, beans, 
&amp;:c. and is under a perpetual rotation of crops. This divi- 
fion of the farm Js called tbe Wintertown. Next above the 
farm-fteadings. are the Outfields, alternately under oats, paf- 
ture, and fepara.ed from the hill or moor by a head-wall. 
Thefe outfields are fubdivided into fmall encloiures with 

earthen

earthen fences, formerly ufed as folds for their cattle, when 
teathing, reft, and watering were the only means of im- 
provement. The two laft are ftill ufed, but the former is 
given up, as king fuppofed prejudicial to the milk cows. 
As a great part of the parifh has not yet been meafured, it is 
impoffible to afcertain with any precifion, the number of 
acres, or the proportion between arable and pafture ; but the 
length and breadth being given, a tolerable calculation may 
be made of the fuperficial contents of the whole parilh. 
/ There are 94 merk-lands in the parifli. A merk-land is 
fuppofed to be as much as one plough can manage. But, in 
a Highland country, it is evident this divifion muft be very- 
vague, and of very different value, according to the difFerence 
of the foil, and the proportion of arable and grafs contained 



in it *. 



'Population ^According tcfDr. Webfter's report, the po- 
pulation 

• The origin of this denomination of lands is, by fome, referred to a very 
diftant era, and claffed with the famous Alpinian laws. It is now of little 
confequence, being neither uniform nor univerfal. I know nothing regulated 
by it, except perhaps, cefs, tcinds, and fome other public burdens. The rent 
is fixed by a furer rule, the number of boll* fowing, and foums of cattle of all 
kinds it wiU maintain. One cow makes a foum, a horfe two ; ten fheep (and ia 
fome places fewer) are confidered as a foum. It is evident, that in a country 
like this, fo infinitely divcrfified as to the proportions as well as quality of both 
arable and grafs in every farm, with the accidental variations of ftock ariling 
from the rife and fall of markets, and the confequent preference of one kind of 
ftock to another, which fo frequently happens, no certain account can be given 
of the total amount of ftock in the parifli, neither could it anfwer any valuable 
purpofe, and by fome, might be confidered as an invidious inquiry. Let it fuf- 
fice to obfervc, that the average ftock of a merk-land is 4 horfes, la milk cowj, 
with their followers, and 40 flieep, with theirs. The average of fowing is, 15 
bolls oats, I boll bear, 4 bolls potatoes. From this calculation, however, which 
is applicable only to fuch farms as are in the hands of common tenants, muft be 
excepted, fuch lands as are in the natural pofleflion of the proprietors, and un- 
der proper cultivation, and fome others under ftocks of flieep and black cattle.

and from thence to fouth end of Kintyre, where there is a 
Hated ferry to Ireland, of about 7 leagues only, runs through 
the whole length of this parifti : And though there is another

by the voluntary contributions of the gentlemen; but xt was 
found neceffary to apply for an aft of parliament for xmpofing 
a ftent, in order to fimfli and keep them in repair. It is but 
iuftice to the gentlemen of this country, to obferve, that they 
exerted themfelves in . very fpinted manner to carry on thi. 
great improvement of roads, not only in their own diftnft, 
but alfo in other parts o! the Qnre, particularly Sha'-goil, an

ilance has often produced very ferious and diftrefling effects 
particularly in the cafe ot the polt, furgeons called to the

marriages, chriftenings, burials, markets, mills, fmithies, &amp;c. 
The commiffioners ot fupply, and i^rveyor3 of roads were 
fo fenfible of thefe dangers and inconveniencies, that they 
have had recourfe to an expedient for removing them, which, 
though inadequate, was all they had in their power, namely, 
to put large planks acrofs thofe v?aters which want bridges, 
for the fecurity of foot-travellers ; yet this is but partial re- 
lief, fince fome times the fpeats or floods are fo high and ra^ 
pid, that the flrongeft horfe cannot crofs thepi. 

Herring Fijhery — This is a moft important objeft. It is 
the principal occupation and chief fource of the induftry and 
maintenance of a confiderable number of the inhabitants. 
The parifli furniflies about 30 fmall wherries, from 6 to 10 
tons, and 60 row-boats ; thefe, at 2 men to a wherry, and 4 
men to a boat, employ 300 naen. The wherries are for car- 
rying the herrings to market, and the fmall boats for ufliing 
them ; but both are fometimes promifcuoufly employed. At 
the end of a good fifhing feafon, they will divide about lool. 
Sterling, i. e. 20I. to each man, and 20 1. for the owner of 
the boat ; but the average may be about 61. to fuch as give 
only a partial attendance on (he fifliing (being in harvefl: 
obliged to fecure their crop, fuel, &amp;c,), and from 10 1. to 
15I. to thefe who profccute the lifliing during the whole fea- 
fon, which is generally from the beginning ot June to Ciirift- 
mas. The herring filhery has not totally failed any one jear 
for thefe laft 20 or 30 years, ttiough lome feafons have great-

U exceeded others in the quantity. It is obferved, that the 
herrings caught here, and in the Lochs Fine, Long, &amp;c. are 
of a rrcher and more delicat^ tafte, than thofe caught either 
in the Weaern iHes, or the coaft of Ireland. Though the 
latter are much larger, they have a flrong tafte, and anfwer 
beft for exportation to hot climates. It is to be regretted, 
that Government, and the focieties eftablilKed for fuch bene- 
ficial purpofes, have not paid more attention to this branch 
of trade, in which, cxclufive of bnffes, who have a bounty, 
fo many ufeful hands are yearly employed, and from which 
fo much advantage might be derived. The chief thing 
wanted for this purpofe is, to have harbours d.fpofed m 
proper places, and at convenient diftances along the coafl. 
There are feveral fmall bays and creeks, half formed by na- 
ture, where harbours, fufficient for the fleet, might be made 
without any enormons expenfe. There are three places on 
this coaft, I mean the points of Carradell, Skipnefs, and 
Sunadale, the two former near the extremities of the ufual 
ilftiing ground, and the laft near the centre, which, on the 
flighteft furvey, would occur to any perfon as exceedingly 
well adapted for principal harbours, to accommodate veffels 
from 15 to 30 tons ; feveral fuch attend every feafon, for the 
purpofe of faking herrings, or carrying them frelli to the 
red.h^rring houfes in Liverpool, Ifle of Man, &amp;:c. and to 
other markets. Veffels of this defcription, are of very great 
advantage to the fifliery, in keeping up the prices, and deferve 
to have fome attention paid to their fecurity. Yet, the fmall 
fiftiing-boats being of ftill greater confequence, ought to be 
encouraged, and accommodated with places of fafety. There 
is a great variety of fmall creeks, which a moderate fum 
would clear and fit for their reception. From 200 to 300 
boats have been frequently feen here of an evening, and all- 
6f them difperfed before morning, for want of thefe acco.m»

Tarbert, Lochfine, the Kyles of Bute, Lochranfay, Campble- 
town, and under the Ice of head-lands and points, being their 
only ftiift to fave their lives. Though there are fome natu- 
ral harbours formed by the mouths of the rivers, yet thefe 
are often dangerous, from fliifting or filling witli fand, fome- 
times inaccelfible to veffels of or 20 tons; and, exclufive 
of thefe di fad vantages, have not capacity to receive any con- 
liderable number *. 



State of Inip7-ovement. — From the general defcription given 
of the face of the parifh, it appears, that though it is better 
calculated for grazing than agriculture, yet, that a confider- 
able part of the low grounds is capable of cultivation, and 
fit to produce the moll valuable crops. On the eftates of Sad- 
del, 

* It is here to be obferved, that befides the advantages of thefe three places 
above mentioned, for principal harbours, from their local fituation with refpedl 
to one another, and the fiftiing grounds, there are others peculiar to them, a- 
bove any other ftations along the coaft. The country near them is better adapt- 
ed for crops, and eonfequently more populous. And the proprietors have of 
late divided fome large farms into fmall plots, and built houfes on them for the 
accommodation of lifliers and tradefraen ; fo that if a few harbomrs 'vere once 
made, and the above accommodations of land, houfes, &amp;c. fomewhat more ex- 
tended (which the ptoprietors will find it their interefl: to do), the herring fifhery 
on this coaft would floUrifli, to the great advantage of individuals, the publick, 
and Government. More pralfe is due to thofe, who lay out their time, their 
talents, their money, vc their influence, for promoting thefe and fuch other 
plans of real utility, than to all the race of politicians put together. It is but 
juftice, therefoi'e, here to add, that, with the laudable view of promoting the 
improvement of this valuable branch of our trade, his Grace the Duke of Ar- 
gyll, and another gentleman (Mr. Campbell of Carradell), who has paid great 
attention to the herring fifliery for a feries of years, and is fuppofed to have fu- 
perior fldll in every thing which concerns it, have got red-herring houfes built 
on their eftates here, in which a very conliderable quantity of red-herrings 
have been manufadlured, and for which there has been a great demand both ai 
iiome and abroad.

j,l Carradell, and Skipnefs, every fpecies of improvement 
has' been carried on to a high degree of melioration. From 
the manlion-houfes, the eye is entertained with an extenfire 
profpea of regular enclofures, (heets of verdant pafture, na- 
tural woods and clumps of planted trees, with all the vanety^of 
crops, which fyftematical cultivation, earned on with a hbe- 
ral hand and perfevering attention, may be fuppof.d to pro- 
duce, in a foil naturally adapted for fuch valuable produftions. 
But with thefe, and a few other exceptions, the reft of the 
arable land in the parilh, is in the fame ftate of non-improve- 
ment with every country under fimilar difadvantages. Tne 
chief obftruaions to improvement in agriculture, hitherto, 
have been the want of manure, and fuel ; or, at leafl, the too 
high expenfe of money and time neceffary for procuring them. 
There is no kind of manure in this parifh, except dung and 
fea-weed, no limeftone nor marl being yet difcovered in it; 
^nd the inhabitants have been long fubjeaed to many incon- 
veniencies as to their fuel. Turf or peats were their only 
fuel : they are found in the hills j but the cutting, with the 
whole expenfive procefs of drying and carrying them home, 
ufed to occupy the farmer and his whole family for a great 
part of the fummer feafon ; and in a wet feafon, he ran the 
dreadful rifk of wanting fire to drefs his viauals, or warm 
him during the inclemency of winter. This was the de- 
plorable fituation of the people here, and over all the High- 
lands, two years ago, and is in a great meafure fo, even this 
feafon (1793). It is very evident, that neither agriculture 
(that fureft and molt permanent fource of national wealth), 
nor any manufaaures, can ever be carried on to any purpofe, 
in a country without manure and without fuel *.

Antiquities.— T\xQ abbey of Saddel, a monaftery of the Cif- 
tertian order, was begun by Somerled, Lord of Kintyre, and 
the Ifles (who died in 1 163), and finiflied by his fon Regi- 
nald. It was built in the form of a crofs. The length from E. 
to W., is about 136 feet, by 24 over walls, and the tranfept 
from N. to S., about 78 feet, by 24, The S. end of the tran- 
fept was extended 58 feet more, and made the fide of a fquare, 
which ferved for cloifteis. There is very little of the church 
or cloifters now (landing — Near the point of Skipnefs, Hands

lay out in carrying home coal and limeftone. The great number of boats in 
the parifli, with its vicinity to Clyde and Ayrfliire, are circumftances in favour 
of the farmer, both for exporting what he can fpare of his produce, and getting 
home coal and limeftone in return, and this will open a new fource of employ- 
jiv nt for many hands, who, ,in the late ftate of non-improvement, were often 
idle, except in the herring-fifliing feafon. What pity was it then to deprive the 
poor indiiftrious people, for fo long a period, of fuch a refource for bettering 
their condition in fo msny refped:s, for the fake of a duty trifling to Govern- 
ment, but highly impolitic, when confidered in all its train of calamitous con- 
fequences, to the families of many ufeful ^nd defcrving fubjefls :

* It is built with a cement, apparently made up of a compoat.on of hme 
fea-fl.ell, and earth of a dunni.l. colour, fo e.c.edingly firm, that :t were eafier 
to quarry a whir^-rock. Some parts of the walls feem to be of a later date than 
s being thinner and in a different ftyle of architecture. The outer wall .a 



i^et inlength, in all. but none of the 
fides are exactly of the fame length. It has two projections of 13 feet fquare 
over walls, one at the S. E. corner, and the other at the N. W. corner, ftil 1 
called Tur-an-t'agairt, or the Prieft's Tower, clofe by which, there was a fmall 
chapel or oratory. At the N. E. corner, and within the outer wall, there is a 
large tower or citadel, confiderably higher than the oufer wall, which is kept 
in good repair by the prefent proprietor, who roofed and floored it, fo as to make 
exceeding good lodgings. Eelow, there are excellent vaulted cellars ; the flairs 
to the feveral apartments above, run through the wall, and are far from being 
bad, though rather narrow, according to the tafte of the times. The entry to 
it was fecured by a wall ftretching acrofs the area to the N. W. fide of the outer 
waU, with a large gate in the middle : This gate, now partly taken down, as 
well as the two outer or principal gates, were in the Gothic ftyle. The area 
within this crofs wall, was probably ufed as barracks, now converted into a 
handfome court of offices with great propriety. Thefc, with other improve- 
ments, both within and without the caftle, have a very pleafing eftecT:, exhibit- 
ing to the eye at one view, modern elegance and ancient grandeur happily coai- 
bined together. 

Upon almoft every point or projeflion along the coaft, there arc to be feea 
fmall Danifh forts ; the raoft confiderable is, the caftle of Aird at Carradell, it 
is fituated on a high rock clofa by the fea.on which fide it is inacceffible, and fe- 
cured on the land fide by a deep broad ditch. Nothing remains but a part of 
the outer wall, built with mud, and above 6 feet thick, and la feet high, where 
entire. It is 140 feet long, and 72 broad. Near this, at the extremity of the 
point of land, which forms the fine bay of Carradell, there is a fmall ifland, in 
the centre of which is to be feen, the foundations of a vitrified wall of an ellip- 
tical form, furrounding about a rood of ground. The lava or cement is of a 
dark gray colour ; but of what materials, and by what procefs it was made, is 
not eafily determined. There is no tradition to throw any light on this puz- 
zling monument of antiquity. Its iniular fequefterjd fituaticn, and particularly 
its form, which was peculiar to the ancient Druids, and a large opening on the 
E. toward the rifing fun, wodld tempt one to conjedlure that it was built by 
that venerable order, as a place of retreat and fecurity, when they fell into 

difgrace^

Schools, Poor.^There is no parochial fchool (properly f« 
cnlledj in th.s parilh, and there is only one fociety fchool fo- 
reading, &amp;c. at 5I, and another for knitting, &amp;c. at 61., both 
placed at Skipncfs. There are two annuities left to {he for, 
mer, one of 2I. los. Sterling, by Daniel Campbell. Efq. of 
Shawficld; and the other of 5!. left to it by Mrs. Ann Camp, 
tell, relia of Captain Colin Campbell of Skipuefs ; both 
which annuities are regularly paid. The pariftx would re- 
quire three other fchools at leaft ; one in the centre, one at 
Carradell, and one in Glenfaddel *. 

Such is the medefty of the poor in this parifh, and their 
averfionto begging, that the feffion lift fcldom exceeds 12, 

except 

dilgrace, and had drawn upon themfelves the difpleafure of the jace of Fingal, 
by afTuming a greater degree of power, than tliefe haughty heroes were wiU.rg 
to allow tlvem. As there is a fimilar building in the ifland of Bute, and other 
places, It is hoped a more fatisfaflory account may be obtained. 

• Application was made by meinorial, about 15 years ago, to the Society in 
Scotland for Propagating Ghriftian Knowledge, reprefenting the ftate of the 
poor people for want of fchools, and craving the aid of the Society. No relief 
was then granted, on this ground, that there was no parochial fchool in the 
parifji. This is ftill the cafe, for this obvious reafon, that one parochial fchool 
would be of little benefit in this parifli, on account of its great length and com- 
parative narrownefs, interfered by fo many rapid and dangerous rivers. But a 
plan much better adapted to the purpofes of education and general advantage, 
was adopted in lieu of it, namely, to divide the parilh into convenient diftridls, 
with a fmall fchool in each 5 the inhabitants contributing a falary to the teach- 
er, which falary amounted confiderably above what they could legally, or rea- 
fonably be affefled in. Theie falaries, however, though not very confiderable, 
being too heavy a burden on the poerer fort, who are by far the greateft num- 
-ber, thefe fchools were frequently difcontinued, and in fome diftridls dropped 
altogether. But it is now to be hoped, that the furvey lately made by a Re- 
verend Gentleman, will fliow the Society the propriety of erecting more fchools 
in this parifli, for the relief of the p9or,^ encouragement of teachers, and the 
interefl: of religion. The landed intereft in the parillj, muft certainly conUHev 
it as a right meafure to concur with the Society, in promoting a fcheme, not 
only benevolent in its nature, but attended with many advantages to them,-

Ecchfiajlical State. -^:)^txe are two churches, neither of 
them old, being built fince the eredion 1753 J they are 13 
miles diftant from each other, and about 6 miles from the 
extremities ; they are in good repair, but ftill unenclofed, 
and without bells, and other convcniencies neceffary for the 
clergyman, when performing duty at a diftance from his own 
houfe, and where he can find no proper accommodation for 
himfelf, or hrs horfe ; to be forced to look for it in a publick 
houfe, is both difagreeable and expenfive. The glebe was 
defigned, and the manfe built in 1772, in a fituation extreme- 
ly cold, and expofed to violent ftorms ; 4 miles from one 
church, and 9 from the other. The glebe confifts of about 
30 acres, Scots meafure, of very bad moor, and two acres 
arable. The fum allotted for building the manfe, was only 
146I. los.; a part of the finifhing within, and the olEces, 
were put off to a future period ; and nothing has been done as 
to either, except what the incumbent has done for his interim 
accommodation, at his own expenfe. He believes the heri- 
tors intend foon to make up thefe deficiencies. The prefent 
living is 49 bolls bear, 15 bolls meal, and about 17I. Ster- 
ling money, per decreet of locality, by which all the recover- 
able teinds are exhaufted. — Patron, his Grace the Duke of 
Argyll. 



General CharaBer The people of this parifli are, in ge- 
neral, of a fober, honeft, and hofpitable difpofition. Few 

crimes, 



^tatijlical Account 



crimes, or high raifdemeanours have been known among them. 
The fines, for inftance, for fornication and adultery, have not 
exceeded jl. fuice the incumbent came to the pari/]), 25 years 
ago. As to their religious knowledge, they are happily ig- 
norant of thofe party diftinftions, and controverfial difputes 
which difgrace and divide the religious in fome parts of the 
kingdom, as well teachers as people. Senfible, however, of 
the difadvantages they have long lain under from their local 
fituation, in a parilh fo oddly laid off, when the communica- 
tion is fo frequently interrupted by intervening rivers, and 
the confequent difficulty of enjoying the means of religious 
improvement, they anxioufly look forward to that period 
tvhen thefe obflruclions fliall be removed. 

One very great obftrudion to religious improvement in this 
pariih, is not only the great diilance of a confiderable nuinber 
of the people from the churches, and the interruption of 
rivers, &amp;c. but chiefly their having publick worfhip only 
every fecond Sabbath in each church, and even this fubjecl 
fo the uncertainty and difappointmenl which rnuft frequently 
arife from the above mentioned caufes. It is evident, that if 
publick ordinances are the principal charfnels of religious im- 
provement (which no fenfible man will deny), this improve- 
ment will advance more or lefs in proportion, as thefe meanj 
are enjoyed. To want them, therefore, every fecond day, is 
plainly a deduftion of one half of the quantum of know- 
ledge and virtue they are calculated to j)roduce. If to this 
be added, the force of thofe confequent habits of negleft and 
mifapplication of that day, dedicated to the performance of 
the moft natural and indifpenlible duties of a reafonable be- 
ing towards his beft Benefaitor, and to the attainment of the 
effential requifites of private and public, prefent and future 
happinefs, it will fuggeit confiderations of the moft. afFedting

becoming regard either to God or his fellow creatures ; yet, 
fhameful as it is, in this bleffed land of religion and liberty, 
fuch, and worfe than can now be defcribed, is the fituation 
not only of this parifli, but ot many other pariflies in the 
Highlands and Iflands of Scotland. But it is to be hoped, 
that in the reign of the beft of Kings, and during an admini- 
ftration which pays evfery attention to the teriiporal profperity 
of the nation, this great objefl will not be overlooked ; tliat 
means will be adopted not only of rendering the fituation of 
the prefent clergy comfortable, but that provifions will be 
made by Government for the fupport of fuch an additional 
number, as are necelTary for reducing fuch pariflies as are at 
prefent too large and extenfive within reafonable bounds. 
This would render the duties both of minifters and people, 
not only cafy and pleafant to themfelves, but profitable to the 
nation, by facilitating the means of adding to the flock of 
publick virtue, and publick profperity ; for, it is the furea 
way of attaining to that righteoufnefs which cxalteth a na- 
^on.

<p>Name, E-xtsnt, Surface, &amp;c. 

THE name of the parifli is Gaelic. Its etymology is un- 
certain. It is faid to fignify " the field of the chafe,'*' 
or, " the fidd of the purfuit," But, though its fxtu'^tion a- 
mong hills, the greateft part of which have been covered 
with wood, muft have rendered it fit for the chafe ; and 
though a great number of cairns, faid to have been raifed 
over the bodies of the (lain, and fome other circumftances, 
make it not improbable that a bloody battle has been fought 
here; little more than conjeaure can be offered why it (hould 
have taken its name, either from the hunting of wild beafts

«r the purfuit of an enemy *. The form of the parifli is ir- 
regular, and in many places it is interfered by the neigh- 
bouring parifhes. There is no map of the parilh ; and, ex- 
cept the eftate of Craig, none of it has been meafured. It 
may contain about 35 fquare miles, being about 7 miles from 
N. to S., and, at a medium, 5 miles fiom E. to W. ; but by 
far the greateft part of this is hill or moor ; fo that the ex- 
tent of arable ground does not exceed 2000 acres. This 
country is, in general, hilly, or even mountainous, and fome 
of the mountains are of confiderable height. The Buck in 
particular, the top of which is a boundary of this parilh, is, 
according to Ainflie, 2377 feet above the level of the fea, and 
though more than 30 miles from the neareft fea, is feen at the 
diftance of 10 leagues from the land. The mountains, in ge-

plenty of moor game, though for fome years with confider- 
^bly lefs than ufual, owing, as it is fuppofed, to the ftormy 
weather in the breeding feafon. Some of the hills are green, 
and though the grafs be for the moft part coaffe, afford tole- 
rable pafture to a good many Iheep. 

Rivers, Hills, &amp;:c. — The number of rivers, or even rivu- 
lets, is not fo great as might have been expe£led in fuch a 
mountainous country. The only river in the parifh is Bogie.

♦ Buchanan tells us, that L,uthlac, fon to the ufurper Macbeth, having been 
purfued northward by Malcolm, was flaiii " in the valley of Bogie." The fpot 
where he was flain is thought to be about 2 miles to the north of the church of 
Auchindoir, but in the parilh of Rhynie, in a place where a large Itone, with 
fome warlike figures on it, has been fet up. If fo, it is not improbable that 
Luthlac has been overtaken about a mile to the S. of the church, in the place 
where the above mentioned cairns now are ; that being defeated, he has been 
purfued through the valley of Auchindoir, which lies between the cairns and 
the figured ftone j and that from this purfuit, the parilh of Auchindoir ha^ 
takeu its name.

It 15 formed by two rivulets, called the Burn of Craig, an4 
the Burn of Corchinnan, which meet at the manfe. This 
beautiful little river, after having run through a very rich 
llrath or valley, to which it gives name, and after having fup- 
plied the bleachficlds at Huntly with very foft and pure water, 
falls into the Dovern a little below that village, 12 miles 
from the place where it firft took its name, without reckon- 
ing the windings of the river. There is plenty of fine trout 
m It, but fcarcely any falmon, except in the fpawning fea- 
fon. Don touches the S. E. corner of the parifli, and there 
receives a fmall river, called Moffat, which divides Auchin- 
doir from Kildrummy. .Salmon are caught here by the rod 
or fpear ; but in no great numbers. If we include a part of 
Kearn and Kildrummy, which are very much mixed with 
this parifh, the valley of Auchindoir is nearly furrounded by 
a range of hills. From thefe, feveral lefs hills flioot forward 
into the valley ; and the hills are indented by gullies, and cut 
by dens or deep and narrow hollows, fome of which reach a 
great way back into the mountains. The valley is exceed- 
ingly diverfified and uneven, every here and there^ either 
rifing into hillocks, or finking into hollows ; the whole pre- 
fenting a profpe£l, which, though confined, and in moft places 
bleak, to the admirers of wild and romantick icenery, is by 
no oieans unplealant *• 

Minerals^ 

* Notwithftanding the furrouiiding hills, Auchindoir is dry and healthy, the 
hollows probably fevving as fo many ventilators to purify the air. Out of the 
I a perfons that died laft year, the fum of the ages of 9, is 666: and within 
lefs than ao years, 6 men have died, all fervants in one family, whofe ages a- 
mounted to fwll 500 years. The laft of them, who died a few months ago, had 
been gardener at Craig fince the year 1726, retained his faculties, both mental 
and bodily, in coiifiderable perfedion, and managed the garden with great at- 
tention to the laft ; rode 7 miles the day on which he died, and at the age of 
86, probably fell a facrifice to a focial and convivial difpofition. There are no

Minerals. — Freeftone is found in the greateft abundance. 
A quarry of it is wrought, which gives employment to 8 or 
10 hands. There is alfo a vein of tolerably good limeftone, 
which in different places appears even at the furface; but ow- 
ing partly to the want of good roads to the places where it is 
found, partly to our fliort leafes, and principally to the man- 
ner in whijh the lipues have been quarried, every one taking 
them where he could moll eafily find them, without ever re- 
moving the rubbifh, very little lime is burnt in this parifli. 
Tins is the more to be wondered at, as there is plenty of good 
peat for burning it: and the more to be regretted, as it an- 
fwers uncommonly well with the foil. The little lime that 
is ufed in Auchmdoir, is chiefly brought from Cabrj^ch, at 
the diftduce of lo miles, and through very bad roads. We 
have alfo a loofe gritty fubftance, which ftrongly efFervefces 
with aquafortis ; but, as the place where it is found is of 
difficult accefs, the effedts of it as a manure have not beea 
tried. Were we to value what is curious, rather than what 
is ufeful, Auchindoir might boaft of being one of the few 
pariihes in Scotland which produce afbeftos. It is found on a 
hill called Towinreef, in the bed of a little rill, but in no 
great quantity. One Jeans, from Aberdeen, found a great 
deal of it by digging in the neighbourhood. 

Population — According to Dr. Webfter's report, the num- 
ber of fouls in 1755, was 839. As the regifters here have 
been very inaccurately kept, it is impoffible to fay what the 
ancient population has been. The regilter of baptifms, which 

appears 

diftempers but fuch as are common in the north of Scotland. Rheumatifm is 
the moft prevalent, and gravel among perfons in the decline of life. Inocula- 
tion for the fmall-pox has taken place of late. Laft fpring 50 were inoculated 
by a furgeon in the neighbouring parifli, who very humanely gave att«n4anc? 
and medicines to the poor for nothing.

appears to be the leaft inaccurate, begins in 1694, at which 
time the parilh feems to have been more populous than at 
prcfent, the armual average of baptifms for 2i years being 
26, a greater number than any fnice that period. From 1697 
to 1702, it falls as low as 5f ; but, in a few years, rifes to 
about 20. For the lalt 8 years, allowance being made for 
thofe who are not regillered, it has been only 14^. Tlie pro- 
portion between the males and females, is nearly as 7 to 6. 
By an aftual enumeration in fummer i785, the parifh con- 
tamed 661 fouls, and by another enumeration lall fpring, it 
contained only 572 ; fo that the decreafe, in lefs than 8 years, 
has been B9. The decreafe is partly owing to the removal of 
cottagers, who had pendicles of land, and privilege of pafture 
from the tenants, at the foot of the mountains ; the former 
being difcouraged by the latenefs of the feafons, and confe- 
quent lofs of a great part o: their crops fince 1781, and the 
latter finding they could make more by the rearing of cattle, 
than the rents that were paid them. It is alfo partly to be 
attributed to the demand for labour in the manuf.^dories at 
Aberdeen. Of the 372 inhabitants which the parilh ccntains,

Soil, j4griculture, &amp;c.— The foil of Auchindoir is, in ge- 
neral, thin, drj, and earlj, confifting of a pretty rich mould 
mixed with fand, and lying on freeftone. From this, how- 
ever, there are many exceptions. The N. E. part, at leaft 
the infield, is a ftrong deep clay, and the glens or hollows a- 
mong the hills are wet, fpongy, and late, much fitter for 
pafture than tillage. Improvements in this parifli, and in- 
deed in all this country, have made little progrefs. The 
Scotch plough drawn by 10 or 12 oxen, or by 2 fmall horfes 
and 4 or 6 fmall oxen and cows, is chiefly ufed. The land, 
in general, is neither ftraighted nor levelled, and t e quanti- 
ty of turnip or fown grafs is inconfiderable. The infield is 
kept in conftant tillage, without being cleaned or refted : the 
outfield, which is more than two-thirds of the whole arable 
ground, is fown with oats for 5 or 6 years, and then allowed 

to 

* The Burgher- Seceders attend public worfliip in the parifli of Tough, and 
the Antiburghers in Cabrach. The latter have public worfliip 4 times a-year 
in Auchindoir, but have no church. The Epifcopalians have a church in the 
parifli, in whicb one of the nearefl: clergymen of that perfuafion officiates ones 
a-month. Diffenters of all denominations are much on the decrcafe. There is 
one perfon vyho was born in Flanders : all the other inhabitants are natives of 
Scotland, and almoft all of them of this and the neighbouring parifiies. W e

men knit a good many ftockings, and fpin a good deal of linen yarn for the 
manufacturers of Aberdeen and Huntly ; but how much money this may bring 
into tlie parifli, it is not eafy to determine.

to run to natural grafs for 8 or 9 years, after which it is a- 
gain broken up and treated as before. This wretched mode 
of farming, however, though too general, is not univerfal. 
Mr. Gordon of Craig, one of the heritors, has a farm fub- 
ilantially enclofed, fubdivided, and improved, in which the 
Tifeful and the ornamental are happily united. Another of 
iTie heritors, Mr. Forbes of Brux, lias alfo a farm in the pa- 
rifli. At an age, when the fpirit of enterprize and exertion 
generally fubfides, he undertook a work which required even 
youthful aftivity. When above 6c, he took under his ma- 
nagement, about 150 acres of his eftate, confifting partly of 
outfield, and partly of heath. This he has enclofed, and 
more than three-fourths of it is carrying weighty crops of 
turnip, corn, or grafs. He is now in his 84th year, and is 
Hill pufhing on his improvements with confiderable vigour. 
A few of the farmers have likewife adopted the modern huf- 
bandry, arid with fome fuccefs. One ifnprovement only, and 
that on fo narrow a fcale as to be fcarcely worth mentioning, 
is pretty general. Not above ^-^ years ago, hardly any of the 
tenants had potatoes, turnip, or fown grafs, except in their 
gardens. Mr. Gordon of Craig, recommended raifing them in 
tlic fields, and fent his gardener to teach the mode of culture. 
Now, every one has a few falls of potatoes and turnip, and 
fdme a little rjc-grafs and clover, in the fields *. There are

* It is, however, to be feared, that witliout tlie operation of fome unfore- 
feen caufe, the progrefs of improvements here will not be very rapid. The 
following are among the reafons that lead to this uncomfortable conclufion -

idlyy If money be the finews of war, it is no lefs the finews of farming ; and 
that IS wanting among the tenants of Auchindoir. ■^dly. The principal market 
for our produce, is Aberdeen, and it is at the diftance of 36 miles. c,thly. The 
leafes are fliovt, and not a few of the farmers are tenants at will, without any 
leafe at all. ^thly^ All the tenants pay mill-multures, which are a tax on in- 

duftry ;

in the parifh, about 60 ploughs, 140 carts; 170 horfes, 900 
black cattle, and 3000 flieep. The valued rent of the parife 
is, 1322I. IIS. 4d. Scots. The real rent is about 650 1. Ster- 
ling. After fupplying itfelf, the parifh exports annually a- 
bout 100 bolls of bear, and 300 bolls of oatmeal. The bear 
is reckoned of an excellent quality, not unfrequently weighing 
^11- 3 R from 

auftry; and fcrvices, which draw dff their attention from their own farms, and 
are much more hurtful to the tenwt than beneficial to the proprietor. It L ac 
knowledged that the inconveniencies of either, are not fomuch felt here as in a 
country where improvements are going on, and the value of labour i, better 
iinderllood ; but that they have a tendency to check improvements, cannot ad- 
imtof adoubt. It is alfo acknowledged, that the fervices are not rigoroufly 
exaaed, the tenants being treated with great lenity and indulgence • but they 
«otw,thllandmg keep them in a ftate of dependence, as degrading to' the cha 
radler.as inimical to exertions. 6thly, We have no winter-herding. As foon 
as the corn ^s off the fields, the cattle are let loofe without a keeper The fown 
grafs and turt,ip, are the objedls of their depredations; and thefe, as the conn 
try ,s open, u is impoffible for the owners to preferve. The fmall patches of 
turmp are indeed taken up, and after their tops are cut off, are put into houfes 
or piled up in heaps and coveted with earth; but where the fields are extenfive' 
this cannot be done It may indeed be faid, that winter-keeping may be forced - 
but the meafure xs fo very unpopular here, that few have the refolution to at 
tempt it. - 

Some of thefe difcouragement, to improvement, it is evident, cannot be re 
moved and it is equally evident, that other, can. If the belt tenants, not the" 
h^ghelt bidders, were preferred ; if judicious encouragement, particullrly ,on!

1 8 ftone of meal. If the rife of the price of labour be a 
proof of increafing profperitj, we muft entertain a very flat- 
tering opinion of the north of Scotland in general, and of 
this country in particular. Within thefe 30 years, it has 
been doubled, and tripled in little more than 40. In tliis 
parifh, it is pretty much the fame as in the reft of the 
county. 

Language, Antiquities, &amp;c. — The only language fpoken 
here, is that dialeft of the Englifli which is common in A- 
berdeenfhire. The peculiarities of it, a native is perhaps 
little 'qualified for pointing out. The people in the fouth of 
Scotland fay, that the tone is harfli^ and to them has the ap- 
pearance of pafTion and bad humour. Almoft all the names 
of the places arc derived from the Gaelic, as " Auchinleith," 
or the grey field, " Toumriach," or the fpeckled hill, " Ful- 
ziemont," or the blood of the mountain. The laft is the 
name of a farm, lying at the foot of a pretty high conical 
hiU called Knock-cliailich. The hill has been fortified by a 
double wall, and the farm has probably received its name 
from fome bloody battle that has been fought there. On a 
little hill clofe by the church, there was a Caftle, faid to be 
rhentiohed by Boetius ; but no traces of it remain. It has 
been defended on three fides by rocks and precipices, and on 
the fourth fide by a moat or deep excavation which has evi- 
dently been the work of art. There are feveral other anti- 
quities, fuch as tumuli, barrows, and fome little hillocks 
called peft-hillocks, about which laft the tradition is too 
vague and uncertain to deferve a place here*.

on it, maiks the fpot where this tragical event is faid to have happened. The 
boar was flain by a young man of the name of Forbes, the lover of one of the 
young women, and a ftone with a boar's head cut on it, was fet up to preferve 
the rememberance of his gallantry and courage. The ftone was removed hy 
Lord Forbes to his houfe of Putachie ; and it is from this circumftance that ^ 
boar's head is quartered in the ar.ms of that family.

immediately over itj in very legible charadlers : IJic E. corpus D. N. I.

initials ftand for verc mutatum, and allude to the dodlrine of tranfubftantiation, 
every one may judge for himfelf. On the lower edge of the niche, but now 
concealed by one of the feats, are thefe words : " Hie eft fervatum corpus ex 
virgine natum." Laft year, by a decreet of the Court of Teinds, the parifhes 
of Forbes and Kearn were disjoined ; and the former annexed to Tullynefsle, 
the later to Auchindoir : but, as the annexation does not take place till there 
is a vacancy at Forbes and Kc?irn, 'no account is taken of Kearn in this re- 
port. 



S^O ShUl/Ikal Jcccunt 

Supplying their neceffitles. There is a general reluctance to 
become a burden to the parifl., which leads to induftry and 
economy. Our young people confider it as a point of ho- 
nour to fupport their parents j and, when any cafe 6l extra- 
ordmary diftrefs occurs, to which the public funds arc un- 
equal, the people cheerfully and amply make up the defi, 
ciency. Tliere is no ftrolling beggar belonging to the parifh ; 
but xve have, great numbers of them from other parifhcs. 
Some of thefe, particularly the women, are young and healthy; 
and they are ufually attended by feveral children of different 
^ges, whom they train up to the f^me habits with themfelves. 
If there be laws for remedying thefe and fimilar abufes, it is 
a pity they are not put in execution. 

Miscellaneous Obfervations.—^omt of our difadvantages 
have been already mentioned. To thefe may be added, our 
want of wood, which we are obliged to bring from great 
diftances, even for the moft common ufes. This complaint, 
however, will foon be removed. Mr. Gordon of Craig, has 
planted about 600 acres, with all the kinds of foreft trees' that 
are to be found in the north of Scotland. They are in a very 
t,hriving ftate, and, while they have nearly doubled the value 
of his eftate, have rendered Craig one of the moll beautiful 
places in the county. The poet Arthur Johnfton, in order to 
draw his learned* friend from his retirement at Craig, re- 
preients this country as bleak, and Ihockingly ugly. Had he 
feen Craig in its prefent ftate, he would have made ufe of

nPHE name is of Gaelic origin, fignifying the Temple of 
the Moft High *. The form is irregular. It is about 
10 miles in circuit. Its extreme length is qbout 4 miles ; its 
greateft breadth near to 3. It contains 3054 acres. The 
ground rifes gradually from the fea above a mile northward ; 
and then flopes down to the river Orr, which forms the boun- 
dary on the N. E. The foil is generally light : near the coaft 
it is well cultivated, and the harveft early. In the N. W. of

Lochty, which there forms the boundary, is wet and very 
ftony. In the fpring, E. winds prevail, and bring mifts from 
the fea, which are unfavourable to pulmonic complaints : at 
other times, the climate is not unhealthy *. The fea coaft 
extends about 2 miles. It is high and rocky : but the rocks 
do not projec-l far into the fea ; and in fome places there is a 
fandy beach below them. Sea-ware thrown afliore by ftorms, 
is occafionally ufed as manure with fuccefs. The ware upoa 
the rocks is cut once in 3 years, and produces a few tons of 
kelp. The courfe of the tides is regular, high-water being 
two hours after the moon comes to the meridian. But in 
fhore, the current fets down the Frith 2 hours before high- 
water, and up the Frith, % hours before low- water. The 
harbour is much expofed to ftorms from the E., which, ia 
winter are fometimes very violent. It may contain 12 large 
vefiels at a time. The depth at a ftream, I2i feet.

diftance from the furface. Limeftone has been found of an 
inferior quality, and is not quarried, as there is plenty of 
good limeftone in the neighbourhood. The mines are coa! 
and ironftone. There arc 14 beds of coal in the Sinclair 

eftate. 



* Epidemics are not frequent • when they come, they prove moft fatal in 
Pathhead, not from the fituation of the town, which is high, on rock or fand ; 
but from the houfes being crowded with inhabitants, and from want of fuiE- 
cient attention to cleanlinefs. More attention is paid to this than formerly ; 
but there is ftill room for improvement, in this refpedl, throughout the parifli. 
It is a pity, that what tends fo matenally to promote health and comfort, fliould 
not be confidered of great importance. There are two mineral fprings. The 
one, impregnated with vitriol, had once fome reputation for its medicinal qua- 
lities ; but has for many years been entirely negleded. The other, impregnat- 
ed with iron, was much reforted to about 12 years ago ; but is now generally 
abandoned. Both are from coal mines, and come to the furface on the fca--

f Dyfart coal was amongft the firft wrought in Scotland, having been begun 
morp than 300 years ago. It was on fire nearly as far back. It is faid to have 
had periodic eruptions once in 40 years ; a remarkable one in 1662. This fire 
is fuppofed to have been occafioned by pyrites, which is found in this coal. If

The effedts of it may ftill be traced by the calcined rocks from the harbour, 
more than a mile up the country. The road from the harbour is caUed Hot

tury, the flames were feen at night coming out of the pit mouths. In 1741,

lie below ihe coal ; and as they dip the fame way, are wrought 
to the W. of it, where they come nearer the furface : 24 
men are employed in this work,, who raife io8o tons an- 
nually. A ton of ftone yields about 1200 weight ol iron, 

Population, &amp;c. — According to Dr. Webfter's report, the 
numlcr of fuals in 1755, was 2367. Little is known of the 
ancient ftate of Dyfart. Trade is faid to have flouriflied there 
in the end of the 15th century; 50 fail, probably fmall vef- 
fels then belonging to the town. Many of the inhabitants, 
particularly failors, accompanied Lord Sinclair to the battle 
of Flodden, who were moftly cut off. This gave a great 
lliock to their trade *. The fiiipping has increafed eonfider-

the coal was fet on fire by a lime kiln, which had been placed too near it. Ife 
did not bum violently : but was not extinguifhed for fome years. In 1790, it 
again took fire, from what caufe is unknown. It did not burn with fury ; but 
occafioned much fmoke and bad air. The colliers were prevented from work- 
ing for fome months. It is now extinguilhed. The means ufed, were to ex- 
clude t!e air as much as poffible, and to allow the water to rife by flopping the 
engines. Dyfart coal has a flrong heat : but being llow in kindling, and hav 
ing much aflies, is ngt fo pleafant for rooms as fome lighter coals. It dips to

ably of late years ; manufaflurcs ' ave been introduced y and 
the town may be pronounced in a thriving ftate. In 17561 
the number of inhabitants was 1378. In 1792, 1827. The 
revenues of the town are fmall, arifing from fome landed 
property and the harbour dues. 

Pathhead is named from its fituatian near a fteep defcent 
called the Path. It is divided into Pathhead Proper, or Duni- 
keer, fituated on Dunikeer eftate, and Sinclairton fituated on 
Sinclair eftate. Dunikeer is the old town : the greateft part 
of Sinclairton has been built within thefe 40 years. The 
chief employment in Pathhead was, far a long time, the mak- 
ing of nails. They fent great quantities to Edinburgh, to 
Glafgow, and to the north of Scotland. Two things favour- 
ed this trade, plenty of good coal near them, and the facility 
of getting old iron, by the fliips trading from Dyfart to Hol- 
land. But when other places came to have the fame advan- 
tages, and nail faftories were ercfted in difFerent quarters, the 
profits of this trade were diminifbed. Manufaftures have 
been introduced fince that time. Many bred fmiths have be- 
come weavers : the women too are beginning to handle the 
Ihuttle with fuccefs. Several manufaaurers of fubftance now 
refide there, who have raifed themfelves by fober induftry : 
and the town is in a fair way of flourifhing, if the fudden 
rife of wages do not lead the young men into habits of diffi- 
pation. Symptoms of this have appeared of late : but the 
praaice is as yet happily not general ; and we hope the inha- 
bitants, in general, will continue to ftiow that regard to the 
laws of the land, and that refpea for the precepts of the 
ffofoel. without which they cannot hope to profper. In 1756, 
^ ^ ' Pathhead, 

n^oralsof the people are not yet entirely effaced. New Ia.-s and greater vi- 
.ilance on' the part of government rendered the trade very hazardous ; and 
f 2 Sdom attempted. A fair trade has fucceeded it, where the prof..-, 
inay be ^efs, but the fccurity is greater. 



Of Dyfart, 



i^athhead, incladmg Sinciairton, contained 1107 inhabitants: 

in i792» 2089. 

There are two villages, Galaton and Borland. In the for- 
xner, nailing was the chief bufiaefs ; and is ftill earned on. 
But many weavers now refide there, who ar« employed by 
the manufaaurers in Dyfart and Pathhead. In 175^. con- 
tained 203 inhabitants; in 1792, 43^- Borland was begun in 
1756, for accommodating the colliers, and has been fince m- 
creafed. It contains 196 inhabitants. 

In 1756, the numbers in the country were 241 ; m 1792, 
409. This increafe is not from more farmers refiding than 
formerly, but from a number of weavers and fome fmiths 
having from time to time built houfes along the high road, 
and in other places of the country.

The caufes of this increafe of population are, an Anti- 
burgher meeting-houfe being erefted at Pathhead, which 
drew thofe of that perfuafion near it ; the advantage of be- 
ing near coal, and the encouragement for labour about the 
coal-works; and what has contributed much more than either, 
the rapid increafe of the manufadures. 

3 S a Improvements 



Statiftical Account 

Improvements hy Proprietors, -In the Sinclair eftate, there 
was originally aa extenfive moor, burdened with feal. divot 
turf, &amp;c. to the burgh of Dyfart. Servitudes of this kind 
are a great bir to improvements : and. in eftates where coal 
■ IS an objea, tl,c attention p .id to it, too often prevents the 
cultivation of the furface. When the inhabitants of Dyfart 
came to give up the ufe of turf, either for burning, or other 
purpofes, their privileges on the moor could not be of great 
importance. An agreement concerning them feemed evident- 
ly for the advantage of all concerned. This was accomplifh- 
ed at different periods. As a compenfation to the town, a- 
bovc loo acres were conveyed to them in property: and the 
family of St. Clair were at liberty to cultivate what remain, 
cd. In the beginning of this century, a few years after the 
firft tranfaaion with the town, Lord St. Clair began to plant 
and enclofe near the Orr. His example was followed by his 
fucceffors : and what ftill retains the name of Dyfart moor, 
now confifts of good enclofures, chiefly in pafture, furround- 
ed with belts of plantation. Within thefe jo years, between 
SCO and 400 acres have been planted and improved, no more 
remaining in its original ftate, than what is neceffary foi fuch 
of the feuars as ufe divot for a covering to their houfes. The 
whole eftate, a few acres excepted, is enclofcd with ftone 
and lime, or ditch and hedge. The laft is preferred as a 
cheaper, warmer, and more beautiful fepce. The eftate is 
ftill capable of improvement. 

The proprietor of W. Strath orr, while he is bufied in car- 
rying on an estenfive manufafture in a neighbouring parift, 
dedicates his leilure hours to the improvement of his eftate 
in this. The ground has been cleared of ftones, which al- 
moft covered the furface : the fields have been enclofed, drain- 
ed, and manured : belts have been planted to fcreen it ; it 
affumes a very different appearance froni what it did a few

years ago. It already makss fome return for the vnoaey 
laid out upon it j and will foon repay it with intereft. 

Farms in the Hands of I'enants. — Thefe are 15 in number, 
containing from 30 to 280 acres each. Upon thefc, are 51 
men, including the farmers and their fervants ; 94 horfes ; 
350 cattle; 24 ploughs*; 38 carts. They breed annually 
16 horfcs, 79 calves. There are feveral extenfive enclofures 
in pafture, on which 100 cattle are fed annually; 339 bolls 
of oats are annually fown, which produce 1824 bolls ; loi 
bolls of barley, which produce 58^ bolls ; 43 bolls of wheat, 
which produce 351 bolls ; 70 bolls of peafe, which produce 
271 bolls. Potatoes, turnips, hay, and flaxf, are alfo raifed 
m no great quantities ; and the proportions cannot be eafily 
afcertained. The rent of the beft grafs-ground in the burgh 
acres is, 2I. 15s. the acre: of the beft arable land, 3I. In 
the farms, there is little above il. an acre ; and much below 
it. There is a confiderable extent of ground not above 79. 
6d. the acre. Tlie leafes being only for 19 years, is againft 
thefe farms. Had the farmers a leafe of double that time, 
they would be encouraged to improve by the hope of a re- 
turn ; or, were the proprietors to take them for fome time 
into their own hands, and improve them, they would after, 
ward get more than double the rent, and do an important 
fervice to the publick. The produce of the parifti goes but 
a little way to fupply its confumption. Meal and flour are im- 
ported from Lothian ; meal, wheat, barley, and hay, from 
the neighbouring pariflies. Little manure can be got but 
lime, which is ufed in confiderable quantities. For fome 

time,

time, fervants were preferred to cottagers : but fince the late 
rife of wages, and great demand for labour about the roads 
and manufaftures, they feel the want of them, particularly ia 
harveft, when hands are with difficulty procured. Men-fer- 
vants wages are 6 1. a-year. Our farming cannot be faid to be 
in a very advanced ftate : but there has been great improve- 
ment within thefe 20 years. The advantages of enclofing and 
laying down in grafs are now felt : the diftinftion between 
infield and outfield is doing away : * balks are disappearing ; 
and green crops are fubflituted in the place of fummer fallow. 
The foil is none of the beft? but might be made much better 
than what it is at prefent. 

Burgh Acres. — About Dyfart, Pathhead, and Galaton, nuni- 
"bers who keep cows and horfes, find it neceffary to farm a 
few acres at a high rent. Where farming is only a fecondary 
objea, perfe£tion cannot be expedted. They have the ad- 
vantage of the country farmers in more eafily procuring dung ;■ 
and accordingly the foil near the towns appears richer than in 
the country. They often fow too thick ; and are feldom as 
pains to keep their fields clear of weeds. Drilling was in- 
troduced about 40 years ago. Wheat, barley, beans, and 
oats, are fomctinies fown in this way ; turnips and potatoes 
always. Where the ground is over-run with weeds, as is the 
cafe with the burgh acres, from their being almoft conftantly 
in tillage, the drilling is furely a great advantage ; feed is 
faved r the crop is generally more vigorous, and more eafily 
kept clean. There are a few of thofe who have the burgh 
acres, who pulh the farming with vigour, and have their 

grounds

ivorthy of imitation *. 

Manufaaures ^"Vht number of looms in the parifh, is from 
700 to 750, employed in making checks and ticks. The 
quantity of cloth made annually, is about 795,000 yards, 
which being, at a medium, about iiid. the yard, makes the 
annual value of this manufaaure 38,093 1. IJ s. About half 
the cloth is fold in London ; a fourth, chiefly the coarfe kinds, 
in Glafgow ; the other fourth in Manchefter, Liverpool, Not- 
tingham, Leeds, and fome other towns in Yorkfhire. In th» 
linen trade, 10 hands are reckoned to be employed by each 
loom ; but as three-fourths of the fla^p confumed in this trade 
are foreign, 7 to a loom may be a proper medium, which, for 
725 looms, is t 5075 people employed. Seven-eights of the 
flax ufed in making white or bleached yarns, are imported from 
Riga, and fpun in Fife. What is ufed for the blue and dyed 
yarns, is chiefly made from home grown flax : but, as a fuf- 
ficient quantity cannot be got, Dutch flax is imported and 
fpun to make up the deficiency. Of late years, a confider- 
able quantity of coarfe yarn has been imported from Bremen 
and Hamburgh. Not above a fourth of the yarn ufed in the 
parifli is fpun in it. The greateft inconveniency the trade la- 
hours under, is a fcarcity of good weavers. People not qua- 
lified to teach, take apprentices for 2 or 3 years, inftcad of a 
longer period. The apprentices, not attended to, get into

bad habits ; and manj of tliera never can make a piece of 
good cloth. 

Tills manufafture b.-'ran in this parilli between 1710 and 
1720, and increafed Uowly till r776, when it did not exceed, 
in value, 8500 1. annually. About ttat time, 2 or 3 of thi 
eftabliHied mnnufadur.-rs got into the EngUa. trade, and mak- 
ing good, fuitable to that trade, increafed their demand be- 
yond what thcii- capitals ivere equal to ; or, though thej had 
had fu.^ds beyond what they could fi-d hands to execute. 
They of courfe gave their orders for coarfe goods to raanu- 
fadturers in the neighbourhood, who employed from 2 to 8 
looms. Thefe, by econo:ny and induftry, faved money from 
the orders they got ; and foon increafed the number of their 
looms. But the value of the goods made, has increafed mt;Qh 
more rapidly than the capital of the manufafturers, owing 
chiefly to the many branches of the banks, by which credit 
is got too eafily. On this foundation, about a third of the 
goods is at prefent made, and of an inferior quality- to what 
is made by thofe of charader and capital. Thofe who began 
this manufadure here, had to work with the fweat of their 
brow for 8 or lo years, ere they gained the firft 100 1. of 
their capital ; now, a weaver* without 10 1. capital, will get 
credit for 200 1. or 300 1, value of yarn, or cafli for a bill, 
with 2 or 3 names upon it, to the fame amount. To retire 
thefe bills, the goods muft be expeditioufly manufaftured.

* Since the above account of the cloth manufaiflure was fent me, a ftagna- 
tion has taken place ; and fcarcely any money can be procured at the banks. 
As yet, this parifli has been lefs affedled by it than many other places. But 
few hands have been difmiffed : the wages have been lowered, but are ftill 
good. But unlefs there come a favourable turn foon, manufacflurtrs cannot af.

Cbnfequences muft be obvious. The fales of the parifli of

muft be obferved, to the honour of the Englilb, that in the 
trade with them, there are very few bad debts* 

Ships. — A fiiip-cai-penter employing about 6 men, fettled 
here in 1764. His bufinefs gradually increafed, till he found 
employment for upwards of 30 men. He has built here, 43 
velTels meafaring 5189 tons. Of thefe, 15 were for Dyfart ; 
6 for Greenork ; the reft chiefly for the neighbouring ports. 
In 1778, another carpenter bred under the former, began to 
build, and has had very good encouragement. He has built 
31 t veffels meafuring 3445 tons. About 45 men are at pre- 
fent employed, including both. At an average, for 15 years 
back, joi tons have been built annually, which at 5 1. the 
ton, makes the annual value of this manufafture 2505 1. The 
crooked timber is imported from Hamburgh and Bremen, and 
the oak plank from Dantzick. The foreign timber, after 
paying duty, is cheaper than what daft be brought from any 
place in Britain. A confiderable proportion, however, o£ 
Englifti oak is ufed, where it is moft ufeful. The feparation 
of the American Colonies from Britain, and the amendment 
of the navigation ad in 1786, have contributed much to the 
rapid progrefs of fhip-building in this country. The em-

Nmfs.'-In Pathhead there are 43 fmiths, who make about 
6 million of nails annually, value about 1000 1. They are 
fold in the country round, and confiderable quantities carried 
to Edinburgh, and Tome to the north country. In Galaton 
there are alfo 43 fmiths, they do not make the fame number 
of nails, as feveral of them are far advanced in life, and a 
number of them make nails of a larger fixe for fhip-building;

nails are fold in the neighbourhood, and quantities carried to 
Perth, Montrofe, and Aberdeen. The nails are made of old 
iron imported from Holland : and the merchants who furniQ\ 
the fmiths with old iron, take their nails and fend them to 
jnarketr 

Salt was made here, at leaft fome time before 1483^ 
as appears by an agreement with the family of St. Clair, of 
that date. The works were more extenfive than at prefent. 
There are veftiges of many falt-pans, which have been de- 
molilhed long ago. Much fait was exported to Holland ; but 
none of late years. Seven pans are now going, and employ 
14 falters, befides 2 or 3 other hands occafionally to carry 
the fait to the granaries. About 17,100 bufhels are made an-

Brewery and Ropery.— In the former, about looo bolls of

About 2500 barrels of ale and beer are brewed, from 10 s. to

this is fold in * Kirkcaldy, to which the brewery pays 40 1.

employed. An addition is now making to the works, to 
-carry on a dillillery there. In the latter, about 6 men are 
employed in making fmall rop.es, 

Loniejlick Commerce. — There are 4 annual fairs in Pyfart, 
;one for linfeed, one for white cloth, one for white cloth and 
wool, and one for black cattle. In Pathhead, one for white 
cloth and wool. In Galaton, one for white cloth. About 
50 years ago, great quantities of cloth were expofed at thefe 
fairs, and bought by merchants from Edinburgh, Glafgow, 
and Stirling. This trade has gradually fallen off ; and very 
little bufinefs is now done at any of the fairs, except that for 
black cattle. Lefs white cloth is made in Fife than formerly, 
fo many of the weavers being taken up in the check and ticlc 
manufadlure : and the merchants choofe rather to pick up 
the cloth at the blcachfield, than after it has been drefled for 
the market. The wool market too is entirely gone. For- 
mfirly many families fpun wool, and made cloth for their 
own wearing : now Englilh cloth is generally worn. And 
fince enclofing became gejieral, very few flieep are kept in 
Fife. The eafy intercourfe by means of pofts and carriers, 
and (hops being eftablifhed in every little village, render fairs 
lefs neceflary. BuGnefs is thus better managed. When every 
body reforted to the fairs, they were generally a fcene of dif- 
fipation. Whatever day the fair began on, no bufinefs was done

The people are fond of a feafaring life ; but generally a,

ing recourfe to a pradlice, not ftridly conformable to the fpi- 
rit of the Britifl:i Conftitution, and which is often cruel in 
its operation, upon a brave and hardy race of men, who, in 
"War, have fpread the terrors of the Britilh arms, to the moft 
diftant parts of the earth, and who, in peace, convey to us, 
from every quarter, the comforts, conveniences, and luxu- 
xies of life. The expenfe attending the imprefs fervice, it is 
thought, would go far to defray the neceflary addition to the 
feamen's wages. The fubjeft certainly deferves the atten- 
tion of every politician, of every patriot; and any hints^ 
Itiowever imperfeft they may be, and from whatever quarter 
they may come, in a matter of Ijacb importance, fhould not

Stipend, Schools, Poor, \^c, — The charge is collegiate. The 
Hrft minifter has a commodious manfe, built in 1779, and g 
garden, but no glebe. His ftipend is 5 chalders meal, 5 chal- 
ders barley, and i61. 13 s. 4d., two load of coals a-week, and 
a chalder of fait annually, while the coal and falt-works are 
carried on : the teind of fifti caught and fold in the parifli, 
and half teind of filh brought for fale from other pariflies. 
The fecond minifter has neither manfe nor glebe, nor any al- 
lowance for them. His ftipend is 55I. lis., two chalders of 
meal, and two of barley, and a load of coals a-week, while 
the works are carried on. The heritors are. Sir James Er^ 
llkine St. Clair of Sinclair, Bart., who is patron of both 
charges, and titular of the teinds ; James Townfliend Ofwald 
of Dunikeer, Efq. the Countefs of Rothes, Walter Fergus of

and navigation. About 70 at prefent attend his fchool. Ther« 
are feveral private fchools in Dyfart and Pathhead, and ons 
in Galaton. The matters have no falary nor fchool-houfes, 
but depend entirely on the fmall wages they get from their 
fcholars, which are often but ill paid. About 230 attend 
thefe fchools f. — Twelve perfons go from door to door once

* About a year agoj the fcirk-feffion applied to the heritors' to make it more 
commodious. An architeft was defired to infpeil it, who gave in fome plana 
of alteration, and there the matter refts : but it is to be hoped the heritors will 
fee the neceffity of doing fomethiiig foon. Numbers are obliged to take feats' 
in neighbouring congregations; fome go to the fedlaries; others, it is to be 
feared, take advantage of this circumftanoe, to forfake public worlhip altoge- 
ther. Were heritors eager to promote religion by their influence and example, 
they would do much to fupport government and good order, and would have 
lefs caufe to complain of tlie corruption of the lower ranks, at leaft they might 
do it with a better grace. Almoft the only fedlaries in the parifli are Burgh- 
ers, Antiburghers, and Relief, amounting in all to 55a families. The two lalt 
Mentioned fedts have churches in this parifti ; the former attend worlhip in 
Kirkcaldy parifli. The animofity between the church and feceflion, is now hap- 
pily much abated. The people, in general, attend church regularly ; but a 
few are beginning to be fo falhionable as. to attend only occafionally. 

t It is much tobe v/iflied fome better provifion could be made for the educa- 
tion of youth. Dyfart and Pathhead would require each two eftabliflied maf- 
ters, Galaton and Borland each one. A Sunday fchool was begun in Dyfart two

Ji perfons are now upon the roll, who receive from i s. to

the decline of life, come into the parifti, and in a few years 
muft of courfe be fupported ; others who have been idle and

fent, about 40 atteml. It has hid good effedls : the children are regular in at- 
tending church, and attentive when there ; but thofe parents are much to blame 
\vho, wanting ability or inclination to inftrucfl their children in the principles 
«f religion, do not avail themfelves of the afliftance they might have, by fend- 
ing them to the Sunday fchool. As the funds raifed for this fchool were more 
than eqnal to its fupport, they are partly applied to pnrchafc bibles, and put 
poor children to the weekly fchool. 

* There are feveral private funds of great uft. In Dyfart, the failors, thr 
maltmen, the bakers, have each their boxes for affifting their members in dif- 
trefs. In Pathhead, there are two aflbciations of weavers, and one of fraiths : 
In Galaton one : In Borland one. In 1782, the poor Were in great ftraits. The 
patron (then Colonel James St. Clair) bought quantities of rneal and peafe, to 
be fold at reduced prices for their behoof, and gave money to be diftributed to 
the moft needy. In Dyfart and Pathhead, money was raifed by fubfcription, to 
purchafe meal for them. When, by any unforefeen accident, a perfon or fami- 
ly is reduced to great diftrefs, the neighbours frequently procure a temporary 
fupply, by a contribution among themfelves. None, I believe, get from the 
funds who do not ftand in need : but the fupply afforded i« rather fcanty. Soon- 
er or later, it is fuppofed the heritors will be brought in : as few of them reCde, 
they by no means pay their proportion. The kirk-feflion at prefent manage 
tlie funds : but are always ready to allow the heritors to infpcifl their books, 
and take a fliare in the management.

Advantages and D if advantages. — The firfl; advantage is, 
plenty of coal ; but polterity will not thank us for wafting it 
fo faft hy exportation. 2d, Its vicinity to the fea, convenient 
for commerce and filhing. Little attention is paid to the laft. 
Wc have only one family ©f fifhers. The town is fupplied 
with fifh from Wcmyfs parifh. They are carried on women's 
backs. The filh caught here, arc, cod, whiting, flounder, 
mackerel, baggety, fand-eel, crabs, and lobfters. The lobfters 
are fent to Edinburgh. 3d, A good public road through the 
parilh. So much cannot be faid for the crofs roads, which 
are next to impaflable. When the public roads are finiflied, 
it is to be hoped attention will be paid to them. Tolls have 
been eredled in the neighbourhood, and one in the parifli, 
not without grumbling. It is generally thought they were 
neceflary ; and few will grudge to pay them, when the roads 
are well made. The chief difadvantage is, a fcarcity of good 
water, particularly in the town of Dyfart ; the furface is 
much drained by the working of the coal. 

Improvements fuggefied — i. It would be of great import- 
ance to the trade of the jlace, to have the harbour deepened, 
and rendered more fecure. The town can do very little in 
this way from their own funds ; but as upwards of 3000 1. 
are annually paid to Government from goods exported and 
imported at this harbour, and a great value of fliipping is 
there annually expofed to danger, they think they have a 
claim for fome aid from Government, for carrying on fo necef- 
fary and fo ufeful a work. 2. A dry dock might be eafily 
made in the W. fide of the harbour. The Hones are daily 
quarried for building : at fome additional expenfe, they might, 
be fo quarried as to form a dock in the folid rock. 3. Ground 
might be gained from the fea, near the harbour, which is 
much wanted to contain the wood ufed in Ihip-building. Some

thoufand carts of ballafl; are annually caft upon the ftior?, at 
the back of the harbour. Were proper means ufcd to pre- 
vent the fea from wafliing it away, it would foon accumulate 
and become folid. 4. Our trade is chiefly to the Baltic, 
•«vhich is frozen in the winter, of courfe tlie failors are at 
home 3 or 4 months in the year. It is a pity they were not 
employed during that time ; fo much labour is thus loft to 
the community, and fo much comfort to tlie individual. They 
would be happier employed than, idle. Thofe who are bred 
tveavers or fmiths have an advantage in this refpeft : they fome- 
times follow thefe employments when at-home. 5. The engines 
and fait pans occafion much fmoke, which is very difagree- 
able, deftroyillg vegetation in the gardens^ and penetrating 
the inmoa recefles of the houfes. By ereaing the proper ap- 
paratus on the chimney tops, it might be converted into tar. 
Thus the nuifance would be prevented, and a mauufacture 
eftablilhed, peculiarly adapted to a fea-port town. 

Remcirkabte Events.— On the 7th of January 1740, a num- 
ber of boys, according to cuftom, on'ift Monday af the year,

Earl of Orkney, with the lands adjoining to it, when he refigned the title of 
Orkne-y. It has been ever fince poffeffed by the family of St. Clair. It was in- 
habited in Oliver Cromwell's time, and was fixed upon by a party of his troops. 
It has, for many years, been uninhabited, and in a ruinous ftate. Three old

were h&amp;nded down concerning them ; the one, that three brothers of the St. Clair 
•family had encountered tliere, during the night, miftaking one another for rob- 
bers, and had fallen by each others hands; that they were buried there, and 
three trees planted on their graves. The other is, that all the ground on the 
neighbourhood of Dyfart had been originally in wood ; and that when the wood, 
was cleared away, thefe three trees were left as a memorial of its former ftate. 
They were much decayed, and three young ones have been planted in their 
place. The arms of the town of Dyfart bear one tree : and it has long bci^ ^

<p>Namcy Extent^ Surface, Sec. 



I 'HE parifli church and village of Markinch ftand upon 
the fouthern declivity of an eminence, or little hill, 
furrounded on all fides bj a marfti ; and from this infular fi- 
tuation, the laft part of the name is obviouflj derived. Mark, 
or Merk, according to the moft ancient fpelling, has probably- 
been prefixed, from the valuation put upon this inch, or fpoC 
of ground. The greateft extent of the parifh from N. to S., 
is five miles and a half ; and, from E. to W., about five miles[ 
which may contain about 7000 acres. The form of the parifli 
is very irregular, being deeply indented in feveral places, by 
the adjacent parilhes. The village of Dubiefide, which con, 

tains 



5^^ Statiji'ical Account 

tains ne?.r 200 inhabitants, and lies upon the Frith of Forth, 
on the W. fide of the mouth of the Leven, forms a part of 
this parifh, though totally detached by the intervention of the 
parifti of Wemyfs. Markinch confifts of four ftraths, or 
valleys, running from W. to E., all of them approaching, and 
ioxrxG. of them joining one another on the E. Thefe ftraths 
are feparated by gently fwelling hills, which rife to no great 
height, and which are ufually called Laws. Tkefe hills, or 
1-aws, correfponding to the general rife of the country from 
S. to N., gradually rife above one another j the more north- 
erly always overlooking tho.fe thaj: lie towards the S. The 
hill on tlie ijorfhern boundary is in a line with tlie Lomcnd 
hills, and forms a part of that track of high ground, which, 
extending from W. to E., divides the northern from the 
fouthern part of the county. 

Soil, Climate, and Dijeafes. — The foil of this parifli is va-, 
^rious.. A fmall part confifts of ftrong clay, and deep loam. 
A larger proportion, of light loam, rich and fertile. There 
is alfo a good deal of dry, gravelly, fl^.arp land, which, in 
moift feafons, yiejds pien,tiful crops. But the largeft pro- 
portion is rather wet, and lies on a cold, tilly, or clayey bot- 
tom. Of this kind fome is fufliciently deep, and, in -warm 
fpi'ings and fummers, abundantly produftive. But other 
parts of it are thin, and^ when allowed to lie untilled, apt to 
run into heath, or coarfe benty grafs. The whole parifh aU 
moft is arable, except a large mofs qn the N. fide, and fome 
fwampy ground, which has been planted with fir, and other 
Icinds of barren timber. This parilli has little fhelter froiyi 
the ilorm in any direftion, but fufFers moft from the eafterly 
winds, which, in the fpring months efpecially, are exceeding- 
ly cold and penetrating. The climate, however, is tolerably 
fnild and temperate, and the inhabitants generally healthy. 

Rheumatifm. 



of Markinch, 



Rheumatifm, confamptions, and hyftericks, arc the nioft pre^ 
vailing diieafes. Nervous fevers are not uncommon, though 
feldom epidemical. During the incumbency of the prefent 
minifter, feveral inftances of fcrofula and cancer have occur- 
red. The fmall-pox is frequently very fatal. Though a few- 
individuals have been reconciled to the praftice of inocula- 
tion, yet the prejudices of the bulk of the common people a- 
gainft it continue fo ftrong,. that it has not yet been generally 
introduced. Children from 4 to 10, or 12 years of age, feem 
peculiarly liable to worms, particularly that fpecies, called 
the teres, or long round worm. Some young people in thi3 
place, have been known to void, in the fpace of 24 hours, up- 
wards of a fcore of thefe worms, fome of them ic, and 13 
inches long. 

Rivers. The river Levefi, which iffues from a large lake 

ef the fame name, lying about 5 or 6 miles to the vveflward, 
runs -through this parifh, and empties itfelf into the Frith of 
Forth, at the town of Leven. The Orr is another cohfider- 
able river, riling from a loch or lake, of the fame name, alfd 
to the weftward, and runs through the fouthern part of the 
parifti, joining the Leven about 2 miles below the parifh 
ehurch. In both thefe rivers' there is plenty of different 
kinds of Sfli. Salmon, pikes, and burn trouts are the prin- 
cipal kinds. There is alfo to be found in them' a fpecies of 
trout, of a tolerable £ze, the fieflr of which is red,- refembling 
that of falmon, of a fine flavour, and very delicate. Thofa 
who are fond of the amufement of angling, can never inifs ex- 
cellent fport in thefe rivers at the proper feafons. 

Roads and Bridges. — The great road from Kinghorn to Gu- 
par, and Dundee, runs through the weft part of the parifli j

has been moftlj put into excellent repair. On this road there 
are feveral bridges within the bounds of this parifh ; but 3 
only of fuch confequeuce as to deferve notice ; one over the 
Orr, another over Lochtj, a fmall water, about a mile N. of 
the Orr ; and another over the Leven, near Balbirnic. The 
firft of thefe is very old and narrow *. The other two have 
been lately rebuilt. There is another line of road, which 
leads from Kirkcaldy to Cupar, and paffes through the eaft- 
crn part of the parilh. On this road there is an excellent 
bridge over the Levcn at Cameron. There is alfo a public 
road, which leads from Kinrofs to Leven, Largo, and the eaft 
coaft, and nearly divides the parifh in the middle. It is in 
tolerable order, though not yet in the fame ftate of repair 
with the two juft now mentioned. On the W. road, there 
is a toll-bar near the northern extremity of the parifh ; and 
another on the E. road, at Windygates, near Cameron bridge. 
Befides the bridges already taken notice of, there is one over 
the Orr, about a mile and a half above its influx into the Le- 
ven ; and two over the Leven, one at Balgonie, and the other 
at Balfour. The by-roads arc in a very bad condition. 
winter, and in wet weather, even during the fummer months, 
they are, in many places, almoft impalluble. This evil the 
parilh of Markinch feels in common with the reft of the coun- 
ty ; to remove which, fome efFeftual remedy ought furely to 
be, as foon as poffible, applied. Good toll roads are doubt- 
lefs highly advantageous to a country : but the advantage will 
be almoft entirely confined to paflengers, and thofe who live 
in the immediate neighbourhood, unlefs a ready communica- 
tion with thefe be opened up for the remoter parts of the 
country, by putting the by-roads into a proper ftate of re- 
pair.

Of Markinch, 



Popiilatiofi. — Markinch is, perhaps, one of the moft popu- 
lous country parifhes in Fife j the number of fouls amounting 
to nearly 2800. The return to Dr. Webfter in 1755, was 
only 2188. Hence there is an increafe of about 612. This 
extraordinary population may be accounted for from the fol- 
lowing circumftances : There are 7 villages in the pariflij 
which contain about 400 families ; and two large collieries, 
which employ a great number of hands. The feuars are ve- 
ry numerous, being about 120. There area great many mills, 
of different kinds, upon the Leven^ Every farm of any con- 
fiderable extent has a cottage town upon it j and thers is a 
great proportion of the heritors refident, who, befides the ex- 
traordinary number of fervants they keep, employ a muck 
greater number of labouring people, than tenants could be 
fuppofed to do * 

Heritors and Rent — The principal heritors are the Earl of 
Leven, Mr. Balfour of Balbirnie, Colonel Wemyfs of Wemyfsi 
Mr. Bethune of Balfour, and the Countefs of Rothes. Be- 
fides thefe, there are fe^^eral other refpeftable gentlemen, who 
poffefs confiderable property in the parifli, and a number of 
fmall proprietors. The number of the whole is 21, of whoni 
II arc refident. The valued rent amounts to 18,4561. 5 s; 
Scotch money. The real rent cannot be exaftly afcertained, as 
many of the proprietors are refident, and have a eonfiderabl«

Agriculture. — Some years ago, the method of farming, in this 
parifti,, was extremely rude, flovenly, and unproduflive. Ex- 
cepting the pleafure-ground around gentlemen's feats, and fome 
enclofures, which the refiding proprietors kept in their own 
hands, the whole pariQi almall lay open and unenclofed. Few- 
turnips were fown ; and very little ground laid out in clover 
and rye-grafs. The land was ill tilled; no pains taken to make, 
or to keep it clean, and the fcanty allowance of manure in- 
judicioufty applied. In confequence of this, the grain was of 
an inferior quality, and brought a lower price at the market. 
But of late, by the example of the gentlemen, who begin to 
pay more attention to the improvement of their eftates, by 
the regulations fixed in the new leafes, and by the exertions 
of fome intelligent, fubftantial, and enterprifing farmers, agri- 
culture begins to affume a more promifmg afpedt. Though 
tmuch of the parifti ftiLl lies open, encloling is going on very 
rapidly. The turnip hufbandry, becomes more and more esten- 
five every year. A great deal of land, is fown with clover and 
rye-grafs. More attention is paid to fallowing, and cleaning ; 
and more judgment fhown in cropping the lands. The ju- 
dicious farmer keeps more of his land for hay and pafture, 
and lefs in tillage^ than formerly ; by thefe means, as well as 
by the quantity of turnips raifed, and confumed upon his farm, 
the quantity of manure is increafed, and he enabled, to do 

more

wore juftice to his grounds. The ufe of lime too, as a ma- 
nure, is becoming very general. One tenant lately laid up- 
on his farm, upwards of 1 500 bolls of fliells, or unflacked 
lime, in one feafon. The Scots plough is ftill ufed by many, 
but its conllruftion has been much improved, by which 
means it is rendered ealier for the horfes, and makes better 
work, than formerly. However, the Englilh plough, with 
the curved mould board, of caft metal, is coming fall into ufe. 
Where the land is dry and clean, a couple of horfes are only 
yoked into the plough, and the man who holds the plough, 
drives the horfes : but in wet, deep, and ftrong land, cattle 
are ftill ufed along with the horfes. This method is certain- 
ly very proper, for fuch a foil ; as the fleady, deliberate ftep 
of the cattle gives a due check to the hurry and impatien£ 
ardour, natural to horfes, iu w.et deep ground *. 

Produce. — Oats, and barley, or blanded bear, are the pre^ 
vailing crops. Blanded bear, or rammel, as the country peo- 
ple here call it, is the produce of barley and common bear 
Ibwn in a mixed ftate. Thefe are diflinguiflied chiefly by tha 
form or ftrufture of the ear ; the barley having only two 
rows of grain, and the common bear fix. Barley is a ftrong- 
er and larger grain than the bear. It lies longer in the ground 
before it fprings, and is later in ripening. And the fame dif- 

ference 

* Though improvements iu agriculture are 'making conCderable advances, 
•yet there is one bar, which, unlefs removed, muft greatly retard their progrefs, 
and prevent their ever coming to perfeftion ; I mean the diiinclinntion of the 
proprietors to give Icafes of a fufficient length of time. To enclofe, and fub- 
divide, and clean, and manure to purpofe, a farm of any confiderable extent, 
would require from 500 1. to loco 1. But there are few farmers who vsrould 
rifk fuch an expenfe upon a leafe of 19 years. To accelerate the improvement 
of land, and to bring it to its higheft ftate of cultivation, the proprietors muft 
cither encourage the exertions of the farmer, by granting longer leafes, or takji.

ferencc is obfervable, when they are made into malt. It i» 
remarkable, however, that when barley and common bear 
have been cultivated, for fome time, in a mixed ftatc, they 
fpring, and ripen, and malten equally ; and little difference 
in point of ftrength or fi2^e is difccrnible. This is probably 
.owing to the pollen of the two fpecies mixing and falling in- 
difcriminately upon both, when the plant is impregnated, and 
thereby producing a famenefs in the quality of the grain, 
"whilft the external fotm of the ear of each is preferved dif- 
tin£l. Gorrefponding to this idea, the blanded bear holds a 
niiddle place, in point of quality, between barley and com- 
mon bear. Though inferior to the fornjer, it is of a better 
quality than the latter. This mixed kind of grain is wear- 
ing out^ and the culture of clean barley becoming more ge^ 
neral. Till lately, \\ti\Q wheat was fown in this parifli : at 
prefent, between 80 and loo acres may be raifcd annually. 
It is doubtful, however, when the nature of the foil, in ge- 
neral, is confidered, whether it would be advantageous to the 
farmers here, to pufli the cultivation of wheat to any confi- 
dcrable extent, at leaft, till the improvement of the ground 
is brought to a higher degree of perfedlion than it is at pre- 
fent. Nearly as much land may be employed in raifing peafe 
and beans ; and upwards of 100 acres for flax. It may be 
proper tq obferve here, that whilft improrcments of other 
kind? have been attended to, the culture of flax ftill conti- 
nues to be conduced in a very injudicious and unprofitable 
planner. The farmers, befides fowing a quantity for them- 
fclves, their fervants, and harveft reapers, let fo much of 
their land to others, who either are adventurers in that ar- 
ticle, and raife confiderable quantities, or who raife it folely 
for the ufe of their own families. Little attention is paid 
fither to the choice of the foil, or the preparation of the 
ground ; and of courfe, whilft the produd is fmall, general-

ly not above two, and fometimes not above one tron ftone, 
from the peck of feed, the land is fcourged, and a great deal 
of extraordinary labour and manure neceffarj to fit it for % 
fucceeding crop. Potatoes too are raifed in large quantities. 
Befides what every farmer plants for his own ufe, all the 
cottagers upon the farm, and many of the inhabitants of the 
adjacent villages, take as much land for potatoes as they can 
plant with their afbes, and what dung they can procure ; and 
for this, they either pay money, or labour in harveft. The 
rent at which land is let, fpr flax or potatoes, is generally from 
3 1. to 4 1. the acre ; and when let in fmaller quantities, it is 
frotn ijd. to iSd. the lOO fquare yards. 

Cattle. — The breeding of horfes, and particularly of black 
cattle, has of late become an objecl of general attention. 
Moft of the principal farmers, btfidcs rearing young cattle, 
graze in fummer, and feed upon turnips in winter, a con- 
fiderable number for the butcher. Formerly, every farmer, 
almoft, kept a quantity of flieep : but now they are totally 
baniftied, except a feW) which fome of the refiding proprie- 
tors breed for their oWn ufe, and thefe are moftly of the large 
white faced kind. The farm fteads, with a few exceptions, 
are ample and commodious, and every farm of any confider- 
able extent, has a cottage town upon it. This is of great ad- 
vantage to the farmer ; as it enables him to furnilh a houfe and 
garden, or kail-yard, to fuch of his men fervants as are mar- 
ried ; and the other houfes he can let upon fuch terms, as to 
fecure the labour of the cottagers in harveft, or at any other 
feafon, when extraordinary afliftance rpay be neceflary. 

Mills and Multures — There are a great many corn mills 
in the parifti; every heritor of any confiderable property, or 
who has the command of water, having a mill upon kis eflat^.

to which his tenants are ufually thirled. Tiie multures arc 
Tcry high, amounting to one J3th part of the value of the 
grain carried to the mill. For this, it is true, the mill maf. 
tcr does a great deal of duty. He carries the grain from the 
farmer's barn, dries, and grinds it, and brings it home. 

ManufaBures — On the Leven, near Balbirnie bridge, a 
manufadure of lintfeed oil hath been eftabliflied for a good 
manj years, which hath been carried on to a confiderable ex- 
tent. This manufadure is not only profitable to the manu- 
fafturers themfelves, but advantageous to the country around, 
as it furniflics a ready market, and ready money, for all the 
lintfeed produced in the neighbourhood, which, being unfit 

for fowing, could not turn to account any other way. There 

is alio in this parilh, a bleachfield, where a large quanti- 
ty of cloth is whitened every year. It is under the belt 
management, and gives general fatisfa^tion. In the vil- 
lage of Miirkinch, a flocking manufadure has been fet on 
foot lately, and promifes to do well. Some time ago, a con- 
fiderable quantity of brown linen was manufadtured for fale. 
But of late, that kind of work has been molUy rilinquifhed, 
and the weavers, not engaged in country work, have been 
employed by the great manufadurers on the eoaft, in making 
checks and ticks, and from the flourifhing flate of thefe ma- 
noifaftures, and the extraordinary rife of wages, the number 
of weavers hath greatly increafed. There are a few who 
c^rry on bufincfs tor tliemfelves, on a fmall fcale, and employ 
from 6 to 12 hands. Manufaftures of different kinds, par- 
ticularly of fpinning and weaving, might be carried on in 
this parifti with much advantage. The water of Leven af- 
fords many excellent fituatioiis for machinery. Coal is at 
hand, and abundant. There is great plenty of good freeflone 
for building j and, therefore, fhould any man of ability and

for the produce of their eftates, and of courfe heighten thei;r

* It was given by Maldvinus, Bifliop of St. Andrew's, to the Culdces in the 
loth centurj. •Towards the end of the 12th century, it was mortified to tlie 
Priory of St. Andrew's, by Eugenius the fon of Hugo, a fecond fon of GiUi- 
michel M'Duft", the 4th Earl of Fife, which deed was confirmed by a charter 
•f King William. From this Eugenius, the family of the Earl of Wemyfs is 
fuppofed to liave fprung. About the beginning of the 17th century, the fmall 
parfonage of Kirkforthar, belonging to Lindfay of Kirkforthar, a cadet of the 
family of Crawford, was fuppreffed and annexed to Markinch. The ruins of 
.the church of Kirkforthar are ftill to be feen : they Hand in the middle of the 
•Id church-yard, or burying-ground, which is eiiclofed by a wall ; and there 
many of the people belonging to that diftrift ftill bury their dead. 

f In the year 1636, the ftipend received a fmall augmentation on account of 
the annexation of Kirkforthar. Since that period, it has been but once aug-. 
mented, and the augmentation got, was only a«l. of money, and the conver- 
lion of fome oats into meal. Among the predcceflbrs of the prefent incumbent 
was Mr. TuUidclph, afterward Principal of the College of St. Andrew's.

Schools, — There is one eftubliflied fchoolmaftcr in this pa- 
nfli. He has a good houfe and garden, with a falarj of lo 1. 
a-ycar. The fchool-fees are, 3s. lor teaching latin, 2s. 6d. 
for arithmetic, 2s. for writing, and is. 6d. for englilh. And, 
as the village of Markinch, and the country in the imme- 
diate neighbourhood, are very populous, the emoluments arc 
confiderable. Including precentor's fees, and other perqui- 
lites, they may amount to 30I. a-year. Befides the eftablifh- 
ed fchool, there are 6 private fchools in different parts of the 
parifti, the mod confiderable of which, is fixed at the Coal- 
town of Balgonie. This is under the immediate patronage 
of Lady Balgonie, who has built, at her own expenfe, a 
fchool-houfe, and a houfe for the fchoolmafter ; and by the 
encouragement fhe hai a rded, and the perfonal attention fhe 
has paid to it, has g.eatly contributed to its profperity and 
luccefs. Her Ladyfliip has alfo eftabliflied, at the fame place, 
a fchool for teaching young girls to few ; and has provided a 
houfe for the miftrefs, with an apartment for teaching, and 
has given fuch encouragement, as to induce a woman of cha- 
radter and abilities to undertake the management of it. At 
thefe different fchools, upwards of 200 children are conftant- 
ly taught, almoll all of whom belong to the pariih. 

State of the Poor, — There are at prefent 20 poor people on 
the roll, who get regular fupply every week ; befides feveral 
others, who are affifted occafionally as their neceffities require. 
The fum expended annually for this purpofe, is abc.ut 60 L 
Sterling, arifing from a fund of 32b 1., the weekly collec- 
tions at the church-door, and the dues of the mortcloths^ 
There are no begging poor belonging to the parifli. 

Prices of Grain and Ptovijions. — For fome years pad, the' 
average price of wheat has been ao s., of barley 15 s. of 

2 blaaded

Of Markinch, 537 

blanded bear 14 s., of common bear 13 s. 4d., of oats 12 s., 
and of oatmeal 15 s. the boll. The wheat boll is nearly 4 
Winchefter bufliels, the barley and oat boll 6 Winchefter 
buftiels, and the meal boll 8 Dutch ftone. Beef, mutton, 
pork, lamb, and veal, fell commonly at 4t d. the pound, of 
22 ounces. At particular feafons, however, when thefe ar- 
ticles are plentiful, they fall to 34- d., and at other times, 
when they are fcarce, rife to 5 d., or even to 6d. the pound. 
The price of all kinds of poultry has advanced greatly of 
late. A fed goofe will fell at 3 s. 6 d., a turkey at 4 s., a hen 
at I s., and chickens at 6 d. or 8 d. the pair. Butter fells at 
^d., common cheefe at 3d., and fweet milk cheefe at 44 d. 
the pound. Butter and cheefe are fold by the fame weight 
with butcher meat. Some years ago, fifli of all kinds were 
abundant and cheap. But novythe price is more than doubled. 
This extraordinary rife is owing partly to fcarcity, and partly 
to the increafed confumption of the Edinburgh market. 

Trices of Labour. — The wages of day-labourers, from 
.March to Oftober, are from is. to i 3. 2 d., and for the reft 
jAof the year from 8 d. to 10 d., varying according to the na- 
ture of the work in which they are employed. In harveft, 
men get iq d., and women 8 d. a-day, with their meat. 
When hired for the whole harveft, men have a guinea, and 
women 15 s. or 16 s. and their maintainance ; and generally 
the privilege of fome lint fown. Men fervants, who eat ip, 
the houfe, get of wa^es from 5 1. to 7 1. a-year, and maid fer- 
vants from 2 1. to 3 1. Farm fervants, who furnilh their own 
provifions, get 64 bolls of meal, and an allowance for milk, 
befides their wages. Sometimes they have a houfe and kail- 
yard, and a cow fed through the year, and, in that cafe, their 
wages are not fo high. Tailors get 8 d. a-day, with their 
meat ; mafons have i s. 8, d. ; and carpenters i s. 6d. WitU-

in thefe laft ten years, the price of labour, in general, has ad- 
vanced in the proportion of 3 to 2. 

Inns, and ^/e-houfes.— Upon the W. road, there are two 
excellent inns, the New Inn at Pittillock-ford, and thePlafter- 
ers, near Balbirnie bridge. Thefe are fuperior to moft, and 
equal to any in the county. There are 10 ale-houfes in the 
parilh, which fell porter, whilky, and fmall-beer. Some of 
thefe brew, and the reft purchafe fmall-beer from brewers, 
partly for fale in the houfe,' and partly to fupply private fa- 
milies with that article. Though ale-houfes are generally 
hurtful to the induftry and morals of the people, thefe bad ef- 
fefts have not been fenfibly felt in this parifh. 

Mitierals and FoJJtls.^ln the eftate of Balbirnie, there is 
an extenfive bed of fhell marl. The fliells are moftly wilks 
(periwinkles) and mufcles. When expofed to the air, they fall 
in a fliort time to powder. The medium thicknefs of the bed 
is 3i: feet under a- cover of 7 or 8 feet. This marl was difco- 
vered a great many years ago ; and it is furprifmg, that fuch 
a fund of manure Ihould have been neglefted for fo long a 
time, efpeciallj as there is level enough to drain it, at no 
great expenfe. There is abundance of freeftone in the parifh, 
and fome of it of excellent quality. On the N. fide of the 
parifh, there is a large mofs, from which a confiderable quan- 
tity of peats is dug every year. Thefe are partly ufed by 
the poorer people in the immediate neighbourhood, and part- 
ly carried to more diftant places, and fold for the purpofe of 
kindling fires.

plied from them. The former has a water engine, with a 
wheel 26 feet diameter, which works two pumps to the depth 

3 Y a of 

wrought upwards of 300, foriie fay'^bb ydars ago. As far back as the yearisiy, 
the Coaltowp of Balgonie is mentioned in a fcheme of divifion and valuation of 
the county of Fife, of that date. The name of the village evidently indicates, that 
it iiad been originally built fot the accommodation of the colliers, or, becaufe 
"built on the ground where coal had been found and wrought. But fince it had 
grown to fuch confideratidn at the above mentioned period, as to be taken no- 
tice of ill the general defcription and valuation of the county, it muft have ex- 
ifted, and, of courfe^ the coal muft have been wrought for a confiderable time 
before. That this coal had bSen wrought at anearly period, to a confiderable ex- 
tent, appears from the coal wafte, which can yet be. traced for upwards of 
3 miles along the line of bearing, and which had been dried hy a free level to 
the depth, at an average, df 14 fathoms. It would appear, however, that when 
the free level coal was wrought out, the workings ceafed. How long ago this 
happened, it is inipoflible to fay. The grandfather bf the oldeft man living on 
the fpot €0 years ago, hid neither feen it wrought, nor had he feen any perfon 
v/ho could tell at what period it flopped. In the year 1731, it was again fet 
a~going by Alexander Earl of Leven, who eredled a water engine, which 
wrought two fets of pumps, with 9 inch working barrels, and which dried the 
coai to the depth of 30 fathoms. In the year 1732, this coal was let to tackf- 
men, who. carried it on for fome years, but hieetihg with large hitches yielding- 
much water, their erfgine was overpowered, which obliged the tackfman to a- 
bandon this fpot, and eredl a windimill at a linle diftanqe on the crop, leaving 
a fufficient barrier to keep off the water, which drained a fmall breaft of the 
coal. This mill \Vrought an 8 inch bore 14 fathoms deep, which enabled them 
to carry on a more elitenfive winning • farther on the dip, than the old level free 
waftes. During this operation, George Balfour, Efq. of Balbirnie, wrought up 
a level to the coal in his eftate, anno 1740, which enabled him to underfell the 
tackfman of this coal; by which means, in 1743, they were obliged to give it up, 
there not being demand for both. Nothing more was done till the year 1785, 
when Lord Balgonie eredled it again, by fitting up the prefeut engine.

and confifts of two fpecies, called the little coal and tlie great

* When this coal was firft difcovered, cannot now be known, but it appears 
to have been wrought at an early period near Balbirnie Burns, fitft by a free 
level, and afterward by fomc fort of pumps, at a place called the Pump Sink, 
to the northward of Balbirnie houfe. Old pits can be here traced along the 
crop, but the period thefe were wrought, is unknown. About the year 1730, 
George Balfour, Efquire of Balbirnie, a gentleman who had paid confiderabJe' 
attention to the ftudy of mineralogy, began firft to trace the ftrata by bores 
and otherwife. from thefe old wattes, through great part of his eftate to the 
river Leven, nearly one mile diftant;-then began at the river, and, by a ftone 
mine acrofs the metah, wrought into the coal, and thus made it level free to a 
great extent, about the year 174a. By this level, it was wrought from that 
date, till the year 1780. In finking the firft pit on the level, a feam was fourd 
18 mches thick of the little coal, and through the whole field it is e.atflly ar

run toward the N. W., another to the E., and the crop 
was wrought till within 12 feet of the furface. The two 
branches of the level feparated further and further, and the 
two crops did the fame, leaving a fpace of many hundred fa- 
thoms between^ in which was neither coal, nor appearance of 
it : this fpace refembled the open part of the horfe-lhoe. The 
encredfing confumption of coal will appear from the following 
ftate: 

From T740 to 1763, the quantity of coal fold at Balbirnie appears to 

have been 42,135 loads, or 8,427 tons annually, which, in 23 years, is 192,811 

From 1763 to 1777, both inclufive, the average fales were 46,719 

loads, or 9,343 tons annually, - - - - i4°iS7 

From 1778 to 1792, both inclufive, the average quantity was 54,660 

loads*, or 10,932 tons annually, ... - i63,9S( 

In 1784, owing to a fcheme of lowering the price of the ccal to all 
who were more than ten miles diftant from the coal-works, there 
was an additional quantity fold, not included in tKe foregoing aver- 
age, of - - - - - - " 4.047 

Total number of tons fold in 32 years, 50°99S 
On the fuppofition, that the demand for coal fiiould not in- 
creafe above the average of the laft 15 years, being 10,932 
tons annually, but continue the fame ; and although one half 
of the whole field of coal were yet entire (which certainly is 
not the cafe), an equal quantity would be entirely exhaulled 
in lefs than 46 years. But the increafing confumption muft 
be immenfe, when it is confidered, that during the firft 40 
years, there was no other toal-work, except this^ to fupply

AntiquitieSf 

* Since 1780, 3 water engines haye been erefted upon this coal. The firft 
works 2 pumps, 14 inch working barrels ; the fecond, 2 pirnips of 11 inches dia- 
meter ; the third, 2 pumps 15 inch diameter, of the working barrel; and a 
bout 20 fathoms left from the coal, to a mine in which the water is delivered 
5 fathoms below the furfacc of the ground. Above the rock is gravel, which 
admits the winter rains to pafs through the numerous cutters in the ftrata, 
conveys it down to the coal, and is the great caufe of fuch powerful engines 
being neceffary to drain the coal. It is a pretty general opinion, that all caals 
are as good in quality, or better, in the dip than towards the crop. Alfo, that 
any coal once difcove^ed, may be wrought to any depth from which it is pof- 
lible to draw the water. But what has recently happened in this very coal, 
gives reafon to believe that opinion, however general, to be erroneous ; for, 
when the engines were firft eredted, from the favourable appeartnce of the 
furface of the ground, compofed of flat and gently rifing fields of vaft extent, 
and from the extreme flatnefs of the coal, which did not dip above i in 12, of- 
ten not above i foot in 20, it had the appearance of being almoft inexhauft- 
ablc, or, at ieaft, that the under level coal would be much more extenfive than 
the crop already wrought ; but the very reverfe of this was found to be the 
cafe. An engine eredled at the trifling depth of 20 fathoms, in the fliort fpace 
of 10 years from its eredion, was found not only deep enough, but aftually 
deeper than any coal in that field. In working up the engine level, it was 
found to go deeper than any part of the coal : dead water was kept till the coal 
was found entirely cut off in the dip by a gravel dike, compofed of gravel and 
large bullet whin ftones, all of them rounded as if they had been long tofled 
about in water. The level was puflied on through this gravel, till it was found 
impradlicable to proceed with fafety to the workmen : the coal was, therefore 
wrought along the fide of this dike, as deep as there was any coal, and in the 
progrefs of the work, the coal to the dip on the wefl: fide of the field, which 
this engine was eredled to drain, not only turned out to be of bad quality, but 
its thicknefs was diminiflied by a hard ftone which divided the feam in two, 
extending from i to 4 feet in thicknefs, fo hard as only to be wrought with 
gunpowder ; which added fo much to the expenfe, that the coal could not be 
wrought with profit, and was therefore abandoned altogether, and the third 
engine creded on the E. part of tl^e fame coal where the feam was found «

Antiquities^ XSc. — Balgonie caftle, one of the feats of th^ 
Eajrl of Leven, is a fabric of great antiquitj, and confi- 

dcrable 

feet thick, without any ftone at all. The proprietor wrought up a level along 
the fide of the river Leven, about half a mile in length, which leffened the lift 
of the engine 5 fathoms. In working up this mine, about 150 fathoms from the 
place where he Intended to erecfl his engine, he found the metals on edg* perfedl- 
ly perpendicular ; a little further, he found them dip I fathom in 3, and that to 
the welt, dire(flly contrary to the dip of the coal, and there he found two feams 
•f coal, with 7. fa thorns of ftone between them ; the firft, a§ feet, and the other, 
3 feet thick, dip i in 3. About 50 fathoms farther, he found flat metal rifing 
to the weft, the proper rife of the coal in that part of the field. Thefe apl 
pearances gave him reafon to believe the main coal did not extend far to the 
dip, but was either cut off by thefe edge metals, or would be found on the dip^ 
feparated by a ftone into two feams, and fuddenly thrown out to the furface in 
•the form of the two feams he had difcovered in his mine, by a rife of i fathom^ 
in 3, diredlly contrary to the ordinary crop of the coal. In order to difcovcr 
this, as foon as the engine was eredled, a level mine was pufhed on to the 
taftward : The coal was found perCedHy good till he approached within 50 fa- 
thoms of the edge metals, where a ftone made its appearance in the middle 
of the coal, one inch thick, 6 fathoms farther, it increafed to ^8 inches thick, 
and continued to increafe till it was found impradlicable to be wrought, and 
appeared fairly to divide the feam of coal in two, correfponding in thicknefs tq 
the two edge feams he had difcovered in the faid mine. The coal continues flat, 
but it can hardly be doubted, that if the level is driven ao fathoms farther, it 
will rife the oppofite way, i fathom in 3 *. Since this is the cafe upon the E. 
part of the field, it is not eafy to account, why the fame thing has not happened 
on the weft part of the fame field, where the gravel dike intervenes, and cuts 
off the coal in place of the edge metals : the probability is, that the edge 
metals are alfo there, and that the coal will terminate and be thrown out to 
the furface by them in the fame way, though in this part/ the gravel dike feems 
tobethruftin, between the flat and the edge met«ls; and is of great thick- 
pefs, as a trial was made at right angles, a hundred fathoms diftant, and 17 fa- 
thoms 

• Since writing the abo-ve, an upfet has been pufied forward, and the coal 
aHually found to rife, as fuppofed abo^e, i fathom in 5 ; and it wiU, no doubt, 
a little further on, rife i fathom in^, and crop out at the furface ; and the 
Jlonc nvill increafe iu thicknefs, tiUit is found T fathoms at the furface, and 
the main coal is thrown out there, in the form of the two feams, above men-

exaftljr afcertained ; but from the bcft mforniation that can 
Vol. XII. 3 Z be 

thorn deep, where, in place of the roc!: and ordinary meta'i above the coal, 
nothing but gravel was found ; from which it naay be concluded, that the dike 
Exceeds too fathoms in thicknefs, how much more, it is hard to fty; at the 
dillance of another too fathoms, the edj^e metals are feen in this part of the 
field alfo, which deftroys every hops of the main coal being again foiind be- 
yond the dike. Frofrt what has appeared in the eall ptirt of the field, it feemr 
pretty certain, that if the coal is found at all, it will be in the form' of two 
Teams on edge, thruft fuddenly up to the furface by thefe edge metals, and con- 
fequently of fmall exterJt and little value. 

From what is above recited, it may be inferred, that it is riot always fafe to' 
triift to the dip fide of a feam of coal being of value, though the crop has been 
found good, which was the cafe here, the crop having been wrought for 40 
years, and every whfere in the natnrdl level found good, and ydt the dip on the 
weft half o£ the field has been exliaufEed in Icfs than iz years, at leaft, all that 
was found valuable in it; how long the dip of the eaitpart of the field now 
working may laft, it is hard to fay, though it is fcarce poilible. allowing th^ 
quality to be good throu'gh the whole ei^tent of the known field,' that any coal 
will rerriain to work 50 years hence. 

From the foregoing hiflory of two' valuable fields of coal, artd' fails above re- 
cited, fome vei'y iniportant contliifiojis may be drawn, viz. 

1. The limited and fiiiall extent of coal fields. 

2. Th'e ihcreafing cohfuhiption' of the coal' a-rtd its limited extent, gives fea- 
fon to apprehend its being totally exhau'ftefl'. 

The limited extent of aU coal, may be inferred from' its being impoffible to 
trace any, very far in tliR line of bearing. Balgonic, coal' may be ranked a- 
mong the regular one's, as t'K'e line' of bearing is rli'6 farte with t*^ geiieral bear- 
ing of the ftrata in the greatcft' part of Britain', where t'Hey ate not' thrown ouf 
of their courfe by adventitious caufes, fuch' as dfes, mountain rocks of a d^f 
ferent fpecies from the ftrata that accompany coal, and fometimes by the wav 
mg and twifting of the coal nietals' themfelVes, which frequently alter the lin^ 
of bearmg, as well as the dip' of tlve coal, to al. the points of the compafs. 
Such regular feams as this, with fo confid'erable a dip. may be thro^vn out .f 
ihe.r courfe by dikes and flips, but generally keep the fame li^.e of beaWng.

raa is, few or no feams in this part of Fife, reach above 2 or 3 miles in length 
3.t moft.and many not half that diftance ; for inftance, Dyfart coal which has the 
fame line of bearing with Balgonie, has been wroaght from the fea-fide about 
a miles, where, near the water of Orr, it is entirely cut off and no more fecn. 
About half a mile E., and i mile N., the S. extremity of Balgonie coal ap- 
pears, and keeps the fame line of bearing, as well as refemblcs Dyfart coal 
fomewhat in quality, but not in thicknefs ; Dyfart coal being 22 feet, and Bal- 
gonie coal only 9 feet thick ; the declivity pretty much the fame. At the dif- 
tance of smiles, this coal, and all the ftrata accompanying it, is alfo cut off; 
a«d not the leaft veftige or appearance of that coal, or any other, has been dif- 
cprered within fome miles of it. Wemyfs coal, Methel, and Durric coal, are 
reanlar feams as either Dyfart or Balgonie, but none of them can be traced 
farther in the line of bearing ; they are all cut off in the fame manner before 
they are z miles from the.fea. The more inland coals diftant 8 or 10 miles 
from the Frith of Forth, fuch as Burnturk, Pitleffie, Divan, and Clatty, are 
fituated on the fides of hills of fmall extent, the metals of which have no con- 
tinned line either of bearing or declivity ; and the coal in thefe fituat.ons con- 
fequently fubjea to all the irregularities ever found in coal works. Some of 
the feams are even fccn to crop out quite round a fmall eminence. And even 
fmall as the extent of thefe fields is, the coal is found full of dikes, hitches, 
and all imaginable troubles ; which render them fcarce worth workmg. Be- 
vond this, in the flat country, along the banks of the Eden, no coal has ever 
been difcovered. And from this to the Tay, there are no ftrata ever d.fcovered 
that indicate coal being there: nor are there fufficient fymptoms even to en- 
courage trials for co«l, with any rational hope of fuccefs.

the fubjea thoroughly by proper judges, and they will declare the attempt 
vain, to purfue the one farther N, or the other either S. or N, than it has been 
already done. ' And what he imagined inexhauftible feams, may poffibly be 
entirely wrought out in lefs than 100 years. I fliall not attempt to account for 
the frequent interruptions in the line of bearing of the coal, and all other ftrata. 
I have only pointed out the facT:, that neither coal nor any other ftrata what- 
€\-er, can l?e traced to any confiderable diftance, without fuch interruptions be- 
ing met with. What aflually happened in working the dip of Balbirny coal, 
may happen in a hundred others, where the probability of the dip being both 
good and extenfive, cannot poffibly be greater, than it was in that very coal, 
till it was adlually tried. One fadl feems to be eftabliQied by it, that fome 
coals do not extend to any very great depth.from the furface. But after conti- 
nuing to dip for fome time, they rife the contrary way, and crop out to the 
furface on a point of the compafs diametrically oppofite to the former crop- 
Many could be pointed out which aftually do fo, though the greater* part of 
feams may reach to fo gteat a depth, and may at that depth be fo altered by 
dikes and flips, as to throw the oppofite crop, or rife to fuch a difl:ance, as often 
prevents its being perceived to be the fame feam, though it adlually be fo. 
This example, proves coal to be limited in  extent in a differeht way. And 
that it is by no means certain that coal can be had in the dip, though good in, 
the crop, and wrought there above 40 years. 

2. The increafing confumption of coal, and its limited extent, gives reafon to, 
apprehend its being totally exhaufted. 

It feems to be the opinion of the publick, that coal is inexhauftible. Govern- 
ment appears to have adopted the fame opinion, in allowing fuch immenfe 
quantities of coal to be exported to all the nations in Europe. It is greatly to 
be wirtied, that this opinion were well founded; but it is contradidled by incon- 
trovertible fads. It is not above 200 years fince coal came into common ufe, 
and it is highly probable the firft 150, years of that period did not exhauft fo 
much of it ES the laft 50 years. Examine all the coal fields, not in Fife only, 
but through all Britain, and it will be found that every part of them near to a 
fea-port, and many of the inland feams of coal, are not only exhaufted to the 
depth of the natural level, but almoft all of them already wrought, and exhauft- 
ing faft by fire and water engines, many of which are very deep. It will alfo be 
found, that the quantity already wrought is probably"at leaft equal to the quanti- 
ties yet to work of all the known feams of coal within the ifland. It might, per- 
haps, be an objedl worthy of being inveftigated by Government ; for if the if-

is of a quadrangular fprm, and ftands upon an area of 135 
feet by 105. The open court within, is ic8 feet by 65. The 

tower, 

fue of their refcarch fliould be, as there is a liigh probabiiity it wouhl, that there 
w^s ;iot a fufficient fund of coal ur.exhauftcd in the ifland of Britain to fupplytbe 
prefent demand for 200 years to come, it isprobabje they would think it proper 
to interfere and prevent the too rapid confumptlon of an article indifpenfibly iie- 
celTary to the very exiltence, not only of the capital and other gre^t cities, but to 
almoft every fpecies of manufadlure, and to the many thoufand artificers em- 
ployed in them. Such could not even exift without a plentiful fupply of coal, 
in a country fo deftitute of wood as Great Britain is. The fuperiority which 
the poff^fTion of coal gives to her manufadlures, on the failure of that fupply, 
would be inftantly transferred to thofe nations in Europe, poffeffed of a fuiii- 
cient quantity of wood for the^r-confumption. 

Is is not difficult to account how Government, and. the nation at large, are 
lulled into fecurity on this point, '/iie proprietors of coal have an intereft in a 
great and immediate confumption. I^o inatter frppi whatsit arifes ; immediate 
j)rofi,t is the objedl, whether frpm the home or foreign market. The reft of 
tnankind have little opportunity, and ftill lefs incIiBaticn to inveftigate a fub- 
jedt of which the' greater part have a very fuperficial knowledge. It i? not the 
lefs neccflary that the alarm be given; the danger, upon candid inquiry, will not 
he found ideal. Gjeat depend.ehce is fometiraes placed upon the difcovery of 
new feams of coal, never before known ; but if it be confidered, that there is 
fcarcely a feam of coal of any confequencc in Great Britain, which has not been 
known to exift for half a century, and that fcarce a new difcovery of coal ha» 
been heard of during that period, to what is this to be imputed ? Not to the 
want of trials, for of thefe numbers have been made without fuccefs ; but as it 
is an eftabliflied fafl, that every feam of coal, as well as all other ftrata, rife and 
crop out, at or very near the furface of the giound, there is a high probabili- 
ty that few va.luable feams of coal could remain fo long undifcovered. As in 
every extenfive field, the chance is, that fome part of the crop will approach fo 
near the furface, as to be laid open by rivers, canals, rivulets in little glens, and 
not feldom the rife or outburft of the coal, will be feen in the form of a black 
duft, mixed, with fmall particles of coal^ in common ditches, where nothing is 
meant but the enclofure of the ground. Such appearances flipuld, and, I fup- 
pofc, generally are examined. By fuch means the greater number of coals al- 
ready known, have been diftovered. And though others may exift. not y.et dif- 
cpvered, there is little reafon to fuppofe the number or extent of fuch undifco- 
vered feams to be very confideiable.

is 

with the immenfe tracks that have no coal metals (or ftrata that ufually ac- 
company coal), nor any appearance to indicate coal being contained in them. 
But the coal fields themfelves are very far from containing coal every where. 
The county of Fife, for inftance, is a coal field, and has been held out in a late 
publication, on the caufes of the fcarcity of coal, as containing an almoft inex- 
hauftible fund of that ufeful mineral, and as every where contaim'ng coal. No 
affertion could be more flenderly founded ; it is probably much nearer the truth, 
th^t for every acre in Fife containing unwrpught coal, there is not lefs than 50 
that have no coal in them, nor any rational probability of any being found. 
That there is ftiU much coal in Fife, is a certain fadl ; but if no other part of 
Britain is better ftored with it, it is equally certain, that more than one half of 
the whole quantity in the kingdom is already exhaufted. Add to this, that the 
remaining half muft be - wrought with engines at a vaft expenfe ; and it is not 
abfolutely certain whether, in quantity or quality, it may equal that pact of the 
coals already eshauftcd. To prove what is above alleged, would not, perhaps, 
be very difficult. Take all the coals in Fife, wrought out, or now working^ 
one after another, examine confumption, and the quantity of ground wrought out 
within the laft ten year^, and compare this with the quantity of ground which, 
the proprietor fuppofes to contain coal as deep as there is a poffibility of work- 
ing, it would immediately be known, fuppofing the confumption the fame, 
what number of years the remaining coal would fupply the demand, at the fame 
rate of confumption. Such an inquiry, I am afraid, would amount to a full proof 
that another century will confunie the whole.

bath been in the poirefTion of a family of the name of Bal-

is kept in good repair ; on the fouth fide of which, and con- 
neded with it, the prefent proprietor hath built a neat com- 
modious modern houfe. The fituation is rather low and con- 
cealed ; but delightfully romantick.. In front,, there is a 
pretty extenfive lawn thinly and irregularly planted with dif- 
ferent kinds of trees. The furrounding eminences, as well: 
as all the low marlhy ground near.it, are covered with fine 
thriving plantations of barren wood. Befides the attention 
paid to the pleafure ground around the houfe, the prefent 
proprietor has of late greatly beautified, as v/ell as meliorated 
his eftate in the neighbourhood, by enclofing regular fields 
with belts of plantation ; and by placing clumps of trees on 
the higher grounds, arranged and difpofed in fuch a manner, 
as at once to pleafe the eye, and to afford flielter to the ad- 
jacent fields. 

The fteeple of Markinch is another ancient building, and 
from the fimilarity of the wurkmanfliip, is probably of the 
fame age with Balgonie caftle. It is about 15 feet fquare, 
and preferves its thicknefs till it rifes to 80 feet high. From 
that to the top, it is about 24 feet, drawing to a point, in a 
pyramidical form. From its elevated fituation, it is feen at 
a confiderable diftance in feveral directions ; and forms the 
termination of a beautiful view from the houfe of Leflie, the 
feat of the Countefs of Rothes, which flands about 3 miles 
to the wellward of Markinch. Markinch hill is a beautiful 
cbjeft. It lies on the north fide of the village, and is of an 
oblong oval form, and 200 yards in length. On the northern 
declivity, there are 6 terraces of about 20 feet broad, and 
which extend the whole length of the hill, winding round 
the eaft end of it. They are evidently artificial ; but nothing

certain can be learned as to their original ufe and defign *. 
The publiclc road from Markinch to the north, paffes the 
weft end of this hill, and, on a rifing ground, on the oppofite 
fide of the road, ftands a broad ftone about 7 feet high, called 
the Stobb Crofs. It is a very coarfe piece of work, without 
any fculpture or chara6lers on it, that can lead to the know- 
ledge of the defign of its eredlion f . 

On the earftern extremitj of the parifli, in the farm of 
Duniface, mortified to the United College of St. Andrew's, 
bj a gentleman of the name of Ramfaj, for the education of 
4 burfars at that college, thete is a hill or eminence not un- 
like the one juft now laetitiotied. On the north end of this 
hill, there is a fpot of ground which' rifes higher than the reft, 
and is called the Maiden Caftle, fenced on the fonth fide by 
ditches, the veftiges of which remain to this day |, 

Chardcier 

* Two reports prevail ; t"he one is, that thefe terraces were originally ditches, 
intended to ftrengthen an encampment, or military poll on the top of the hill; 
but that they have been levelled firtce for th6 purpofe of tillage. The other 
report is, that they were made to accoftlraodattt fpeftafors, aflerfibled to behold 
certain public gan»es, performed iathe pk4n below ; which plain is called thd 
Play-fields to this day. 

f Vulgar tradition fays, that it was erefled to the memory of a gentleman, 
■ivho fell on this fpot, in a mortal reticounteT with ofte of his neighbours. As this 
crofs ftaiids upon the very edge of the road, and % o'i lo-feet abov6 its Ifvel, it 
hzs been in dlanger of tumbling down, by the earth's faMing away from it. The 
prefent Earl of Leven, therefore, caufod it to be fecured, by facing up the earth 
with a wall of ftone and lime. 

I Boethius calls it " Arx fepfiiialis fottdem foflis muriita, dlim polTeffio Fiff 
Duifi, cujus pofteritas, per multa fecula, eam feriuere." Some pretend it Was a 
feat of M'Duff, Earl of Fife, and that there was anciently a fubterraneous paf- 
fage from it to Brunton, which lies about a quarter of a mile to the E. of Mark- 
inch church, and where Malcolm, Earl of Fife, had a caftle. It is faid that the 
entrance to this paflage at Brunton was fliut up fo lately as in the time of the 
kte John Simpfon of Brunton. Near the Maiden Caftle a battle has been fought, 
probably between the Scots and Danes, as a great many ftone-coffins, with hu- 
man bones in them, have been lately difcovered in the immediate neighbour- 
hood. 



Of Markinch, 

CharaBer of the People.— It would be facrificing truth to 
complaifance, to fay that there are no worthlefs or excep- 
tionable charafters in this parifti. The number of fuch, how- 
ever, is comparatively fmall. The great body of the people 
are fober, peaceable, and induftrious. Their attendance on 
the public ordinances of religion is punftual and exemplary, 
and their moral conduft correfpondent to their profeffion. It 
is worthy of notice, that the colliers of Markinch poffefs a re- 
fpedability in point of charader, to which few other colliers 
m the kingdom can pretend. In them you fee nothing of 
thatgrofs ignorance, that roughnefs and barbarity of manners 
that extravagance and diforderly behaviour, but too generaUy 
• charafteriftical of this defcription of men. On the contrary 
with a very few exceptions, they are remarkably intelligent' 
attentive to the duties of religion, civil and obliging in their 
manners, fober, frugal and diligent; in confequence of which 
they and their families live comfortably, and make a decent' 
appearance. It deferves alfo to be mentioned, to the honour 
of this panlh, that during the late ferment, when defigning 
faftious, and turbulent men were endeavouring to difturb the 
public tranquillity, and to alienate the affeaions of the people 
Irom the mild and equal government under which they live 
their loyalty to their King, and attachment to the Conltitution 
remamed uncorrupted. They joined no difcontented affoci- 
ations ; they imbibed no feditious principles ; but every man 
tended to the duties of his Hation, and left the modelling 
and mending of conllitutions to others, as a bufinefs beyond 
their fphere, and above their abilities. "

UNITED PARISHES * of <name ref="NA">LYNE and MEGGET</name>. 



(County and Presbytery of Peebles, Synod of Lothiaw 

and twesddale.) 



By the Rev. Mr. Andrew Handyside.</head> 



<p>Extent^ Name, Soil, Culture, &amp;c. of Lyne, 

THE parifh of Lyne is between 3 and 4 miles long, and 
near 3 broad. The origin of the name is uncertain, 
prehaps from the Gaelic word Linn, " a pool or water.'' The 
river, which runs from one extremity of the parilh to the o-- 

ther, 

• It appears from the Scots Adls of Parliament, (vol. i. p. 960.) that the pa- 
rifli of Rodonno, or Megget, was annexed to that of Lyne, about the year 1621; 
and that this took place in confequence of a joint petition from the proprietor 
and inhabitants of the former parifli, to the Lords Commiflloners for Plantation 
of Kirks, defiring that they might henceforth be conCdered as a part of the lat- 
ter. It is lingular that Megget fliould not have been united to one of the neigh- 
bouring 



Of Lyne and Meg^ef, 



ttier, is fo called, and being one of the largeft that falls into 
Tweed in this county, might obtain the name of Linn, or the 
Water, by way of eminence ; and the name might afterward 
be transferred to the parifli. The lower part of the parifli is, 
in general, of a fliarp gravelly foil, requiring frequent fliowers 
in fummer. The upper part is hilly, and affords good pafture 
for fbeep, confiding of a proper mixture of heath and grafs. 
In the year 1782, the crop in this parifli did not fuffer fa 
much from the froft, as in feveral of the neighbouring ones. 
The fliarp nature of the foil, and the fouthern expofure of the 
corn-lands, may account for this. The whole parifli is, at 
prefent, divided into two farms ; but about 60 years ago, it 
was pofleiTed by no fewer than 7 fmall tenants. The quanti- 
ty of grain raifed in it is not great, as the number of acres 
under tillage does not, at an average, exceed 160. The rota- 
tion of crops obferved, is the old one of bear with dung, then, 
oats, then peafe. Potatoes are alfo raifed for family ufe. No 
grafs has hitherto been fown, nor turnips cultivated by the 
farmers. This is to be afcribed chiefly to the want of enclo- 
fures, without which, thcfe crops cannot be eafily proteded 
from the flieep and cattle, during the winter and fpring. 

Extent, Surface, &amp;c. of Megget — The parifli of Megget is 
fituated in the fouthern extremity of the county. It is be- 
tween 6 and 7 miles in length, and near 6 in breadth. The 
furface is very hilly. The tops of the hills are, in general, 
covered with heath, and coarfe grafs, but the lower parts pro- 
duce excellent pafture both for flieep and cattle. The climate 
is not, upon the whole, unhealthy, though from the high fi- 
tuation of the country, it is damp and cold. On this account 

the 

bouring parifhes. rather than to Lyne, which is fo diflant from it. Perhaps the 
fmallnefs both of the ftipends and cures might be the chief reafon; befides, both 
panflics at that period belonged wholly to one proprietor, Lord Hay of Yefter, 
and it is more than probable tha he had conGderable influence in procuring the' 
annexation.

^iatiji'ical Account 



the inhabitants are more fubje£l to rheumatifms, thati to an^ 
other complaint. The water of Megget rifes at the head of 
the parifh, and, after running the whole length of it, falls in- 
to St. Mary's Loch, a beautiful expanfe of frefti water. This 
loch, with the loch of the Lows, from which it is feparated 
by a narrow neck of land, may be near 5 miles long, and, in 
fome places, ii broad. Trout, pike, and eel, are found in 
both ; they are frequented by water-fowl of different kinds, 
particularly by wild-ducks. The quantity of grain raifed in 
Megget is very inconfiderable, and infufficient, even in the 
beft feafons, to maintain its inhabitants. But die quantity 
that Lyne can annually fpare, would, upon an average, fully 
anfwer all the demands of Megget. 

Population, &amp;c. — According to Dr. Webfter's report, the 
number of fouls in Lyne and Megget in 1755, was 265. The" 
population of Lyne parifti in the 1792, was 72.

The number of flieep in both pariflies is between 10,009 
and 11,000. 

As during the fummer there are 12 or 13 fervants more 
i« Megget, and 3 or 4 more in Lyne parilh, moftlj females, 
employed in milking ewes, making hay, &amp;c. the population 
of both parillies will amount, at a medium, to about 160 . 

There are no artificers nor mechanicks in either panfli, ex- 
:ept I carpenter at Lyne, who has commonly a or 3 appren- 
tices. The relt of the inhabitants are wholly compofed of 
farmers, {hepherds, and labourers, with their families. Their 
mode of living and ,drefs is much improved of late, and they 
enjoy, in moderation, the comforts and conveniences of life. 
They are far from being illiberal in their religious fentiments, 
and are truly exemplary for decency and hofpitalitj. AH the 
pariihioners join in communion with the Eftabliflied Church, 
pxcept 4 or 5 Cameronians, and fomelimes a or 3 Seceders. 

Church, Stipend, Heritors, &amp;c — The church is an old edi- 
fice, ^nd appears to have been originally a Roman Catholiq 
chapel. It was, till lately, in a ftate almoft ruinous, but is 
now undergoing a thorough repair. It \yill afterward be a 
commodious place for divine fervice. In Megget, their is nei- 
ther church nor chapel of any kind. Public worfliip is there- 
fore performed in the different farm-houfes by rotation, which 
is far from being either decent or convenient. The value of 
the flipend, including the glebe, is about 83 1., befides the 
manfe. His Grace of Queenfberry is patron. He is alfo 
proprietor of both parifhes, except the farm of Henderland, 
and a fmall heritage, called Lyn-townhead. Lord Hender-

• No parochial regifter, either of births, marriages, or deaths, is to be found ; 
but it is highly probable that the population of both pariflies has decreafed- con- 
lulerably, during the laft 40 years.

land, one of the fenators of the College of Juftlce, is pro- 
prietor of the former, and takes his title from that farm. It 
»s not eafy to afcertain tlie real rent of the parlH), as fines or 
graffums are taken at the beginning of leafes. inftead of ad. 
vanced rent. 

Inftance of Longevity, &amp;c._The only remarkable inftance 
of longevity that can be remembered, is that of the late mini- 
iier, the Rev. Mr. Johnfton. Though his age cannot be ful- 
ly authenticated, as the regifter of the parifti where he was 
bc:n is loll, yet there is good reafon to believe, that he died 
at the advanced age of about 102. In his drcfs and diet he 
was very homely and fimple. Regarding the manners and 
cuftoms to which he had been fo long habituated, as a model 
for fucceeding ages, in the decline of life he confidered every 
, deviation from them as a corruption. He had a ftrong anti- 
pathy to medicine of every kind, and it is doubtful if ever he 
made ufe of any in his life, except once. He enjoyed a ftate 
of health almoft uninterrupted, officiated in public the Sab- 
bath before his death, and was getting out of bed, in order to 
prepare for the duties of the next Sabbath, when he expired 
fuddenly, in a fainting fit, without a groan. 

Poor. — There are no poor in this parifti, nor have there 
been any upon the poor's roll for many years part. This is 
owing not only to the frugality and induflry of the inhabi- 
tants, but alfo to their fenfe of honour, and independent fpirit. 
la eftablifliing poor's rates, the defign is certainly laudable, but 
experience teaches us that they are attended with many bad 
eonfequences. Wherever men can depend on fuitable provifion 
being made for them, when reduced to indigence, they are di- 
verted of the proper ftimulus to exertion ; they foon lofe the fenfe 
pf fliame, and are tempted to fquander away in diffipation,

.vhat would othervvife have been laid up for the evil day. 
Some of the neighbouring parilbes are ftriking inftances of the 
truth of this obfervation, In our fifter kingdom, the evil is 
Hill growing worfe and wprfe. If not fpeedily corredled, the 
burden of poor's rates will, in a fiiort time, become altogether 
grievous and opprefllve. 

Sheep — Both in Megget and Lyne, the flieep stte all of the 
black-faced, common Scotch kind, and they are not inferior 
in quality to any of that kind in this part of Scotland. Af- 
ter repeated experiments, the farmers in this diftrid, are cpn- 
vinced that their own breed is more hardy, of a better fhape, 
and more ealily fed than any other breed with which they are 
acquainted. Befades, they juaintain, that there is a greater 
demand from England for Scotch flieep, than for thofe of any 
other kind. For thefe reafons, they apprehend that it would 
be very dangerous for them, whofc dependence is felely upon 
their Iheep, to attempt any innovation, in this refped, unlefs 
it were done on a very fmall fcale. Upon the banks of Yar- 
row water, a crofs breed, with finer wool, has been gaining 
ground for fome time paft, but they are found not to thrive 

well when carried to the higher grounds in Twecddale. It 
is true, that an attempt has been lately made, with confider- 
able fuccefs, to change the breed upon a farm near the head 
of Moffat water ; but it ought to be confidered, that thouc-h 
fome of the land in that farm b? among the higheil in the S. 
of Scotland, yen a confiderable part of it is not only low 
but fl)e;tered in fuch a manner, that when the farms in Megl 
get are completely ftonped with fnow, the flaeep on that farm 
areat no lofsfor paflure. It is admitted, that the wool of 
he black faced fheep, is, in general, very coarfe, but per. 
haps conliderable improvement might be made on it, by pay.

rams and ewes, which are kept as a breeding ftock. After 
all, if it can be afcertained, from experiment and undoubted 
fa£l:s, that any change whatever, either in the kind or ma- 
nagement of llieep, will, upon the whole, be more advan- 
tageous to the farmers, than the ^^ode at prefent adopted, it 
is not to be doubted, that the fagacity of that clafs of men, 
in this county, will foon induce them to purfue that plan. 

Caufes of Depopulation The caufes commonly affigned 

for the decreafe of population in this diftrift, are the demo- 
lifliing of cottages, and the janftlon of flieep-farms. With 
refped to the firft, farmers are now generally convinced of 
the neceffity of encouraging cottagers, by building houfes for 
them, though the reverfe was too much the praftice a few 
years ago. Cottagers, by living at a diftance from towns, are 
commonly ftrangers to diffipation and vice, their children are 
often numerous and healthy, and almofl always make the beft 
country fervants. But, with regard to the fecond caufe, men 
of obfervation are not fo unanimous. For it has been warm- 
ly difputed, whether extenfive farms be, upon the whole, fa- 
vourable or unfavourable to the population and profperity of 
a country. Before we can determine this point, it is necef- 
fary that we attend to the fituation and circumllances of the 
country where the farms He. In the vicinity of a large town, 
where plenty of manure can be procured, or, in a rich foil, 
where, by means of lime and marl, cultivation may be car- 
ried to a high pitch, farms of a moderate extent are certain- 
ly proper, becaufe the culture of them requires many hands, 
and much attention. But in proportion as farms are more 
diftant from the means of improvement, and the foil of them 
lefs rich, in the fame proportion, it would appear, may they 
increafe in fize, becaufe the quantity of land under tillage be- 
ing neceffarily fmall, lefs attention and induftry are requifite. 



Of Lytic and Meggct. 563 



\{ this reafoning be well founded, it is evident that fmall 
farms may fometimes be united, and larger farms, in fome 
cafes, divided to advantage. But it may be faid, does not 
the junftion of fniali farms tend, in every inflance, to dimi- 
nifh the popxilation of a country, and is not the publiek a 
fuffcrer by it ? We muft admit, that where the induftry of 
the fmall farmer and his family cannot be turned into another 
channel equally beneficial to themfelves and the community, 
this will be the cafe. On the other hand, at a period when 
the demand for manufa£lurers is great, and their wages high, 
it may be advantageous both tb the individuals and the publiek, 
that fome of the fmall farmers become manufadturers. The 
cafe of this lifeful clafs of men, is indeed much to be pitied, 
when they are turned but of their fmall poffeffions, where 
there is no demand for their labour in any other line ; they 
inuft then either emigrate oir ftarve, and the country will, ir^ 
a fhbrt time, feverely feel the lofs. It appears, theb, that the 
ftate of trade and manufaftures mud have cbnfiderable influ- 
ence in regulating the fize of farms ; fo that what would be 
fouijd policy in this refpeft, at one period, would be the re- 
Verfe at another. If it bie faidj that after all, the intereft of 
the proprietor will naturally induce him to prefer the higheit 
offer for his lands ; and that as the extenfive farmer can af- 
ford to give more rent than fmall tenants, the former will ob- 
tain the preference, and farms will continually increafe in 
fize ; in anfwer to this, it may be obferved, that neither the 
proprietor nor the farmer, even in a fheep country, will find 
it his advantage that the farm be more extenfive than what 
one perfon can properly manage. ThVpytJper check, then, 
when farms become overgrown, appears to be at hand ; and 
the wifdom of providence is equally confpicuous in this, as 
in many other inftances, which often efcape our obferva- 
tion.

On the whole, it will perhaps be found to ht the fountief^ 
policy, that no reftraint whatever be impofed either upon 
farming, commerce, or manufa£lures. When left to thcmfelves, 
they will have a ftrong mutual influence on each other, and 
though one of them may appear to giin too great an afcend- 
ancy at a time, yet it will foon be checked by the others, and 
defcend to its own proper level. When Government is fo 
wife as not to interfere in thefe matters, it will find its advan- 
tage in the increaling profperity of the whole ftate. 

Antiquities — About J- of a mile W. of Lyne church, there 
is a famous Roman camp of about 6 acres in extent. The 
Htuation of it appears to have been chofen with great judg- 
ment. The road leading to it is ftill vifible, and runs through 
the prefent glebe. The ground within the encampment has 
been frequently ploughed, and it is faid, that Roman coins, 
&amp;c. were frequently found in it. But as this camp has been 
often defcribcd, it is judged unneceffary to infift more on it. 
In Megget there are the remains of 2 old towers, which ap- 
pear to have been built, partly for defence, partly for accom- 
modating the Kings of Scotland when on their hunting par- 
ties in the foreft. The traces of 3 or 4 roads in different di- 
reftions acrofa the hills are flill vifible, at what period, or 
with what delign they were formed, is uncertain. Perhaps 
when the country was covered with wood^ they were cut out 
lor the King and his fuite when they went a-hunting. At 
Henderland, tliere are the remains of an old chapel and bury- 
ing- ground. The infcription on the tomb-ftonc of the famous 
freebooter, Gockburn of Henderland, is ftill legible. Boetius,- 
Buchanan, and other hiftorians, inform us, that gold was for- 
merly found in Glengaber vi-ater, and fome fmall traces ftill 
remain of the ground which had been dug in fearch of that 
precious metal. 

Mifcellaneous 



Of Lyne and Megget. 



Mijcellaneous Obfervations. — Though a great part of the 
land in Lyne and Megget has been formerly covered with 
wood, yet, at prefent, there are only a few trees around the 
church and fome of the farm-houfes. The old trees natural- 
ly decay through time, and the growth of young ones is ef- 
fedlually prevented by the fheep and cattle. In Megget, there 
is plenty of moorfowl in good feafons. The earn, a fpecies 
of eagle that builds its nelt in a fmall ifland in Lochlkeae, 
fometimes carries off a young lamb, even in view of the fliep- 
herd. Befides the neceflary attention which the Socks of (beep 
require, the inhabitants of Megget are moftly employed dur- 
ing the fummer and autumn in making and carrying home 
their peats, in cutting and leading in their hay, and in laying 
up provifion for the winter. 

Advantages and Bijadv ant ages. — At Lyne, the diftance 
from coals and lime is not great, the roads are good, ajid there 
are 2 convenient bridges over the water. Thirlage is a griev- 
ance juftly complained of. The want of a falary for a fchooU 
matter, is hard dn the lower clafs of people. Megget labours 
under particular difad vantages. There is no fchool of any 
kind nearer to it, than that of Yarrow, which is 8 dr 9 miles 
diftant. This want is fevercly felt, efpecially by fervants 
who have largfe families, who mufl either fend their children 
to a great diftance for education, or be at "tl^e expenfe of 
teaching them at home. Yet, much to their credl?^:^hey arc 
not inferior in religious knowledge to any of their neigh- 
bours. l"his mult be afcribed chiefly to the diligence and at-

fill into the tender minds of their offspring, the principles of

futn be now increafed to 80 1. Sterling, yet the intereft; of it 
is far from being fufficient to fupport an eftabliihed fchool- 
mafler. Among the difadvantages peculiar to Megget, its 
great diftance from Lyne church, which is about 14 miles, 
ought not to be omitted. The river Tweed runs between 
them, and the road is remarkably bad and fteep. 

Means of Melioration, — As Megget is fometimes almoft 
inacceffible during 2 or 3 months in winter, on account of 
the fteep hills and rough roads, nothing would tend more to 
promote the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants, thaii 
a paffable road uf) Manor water. If it were carried up the 
narrow glen oppofite to Manor-head, which is prafticable, 
and afterward down Glcngabcr water, great part of the pre- 
fent fteep pull would be faved, and the traveller would de- 
rive effential benefit from it. It is true, that the expenfe 
would be confiderable, but the fum which was lately expend- 
ed in obtaining an a£t of parliament for making roads in the 
county, would have been fufficient for making that road. 
It is certainly very hard, efpecially on poor counties, when 
they are obliged to fpend about 400 1. Sterlings in order to 
obtain leave to lay out their own money in the way they 
think beft. The writer of this has no objea in view, but 
the good of his country ; and it will be admitted, that few 
things are more conducive to its improvement, than good 
roads upon a liberal plan, andi in a proper diredion. As this 
is a national concern, and not confined to any particular dif- 
tri£t, it is to be hoped, that at fome future period it may meet 
with all the attention it deferves. 

That confiderable improvement has been lately made on 
the roads, cannot be denied ; but it wUl alfo be admitted, 
that they are far from having attained that perfcdion, cither 
in the direaion or execution of them, to whioh they may bt 

carried.

parried. It is certainly the intereft of every member of tht? 
community, that the communication from one place to an- 
other be rendered as eafy as poflible ; but gentlemen of land- 
ed property appear to be more concerned in thia than others : 
For, if their tenants are obliged, on account of the fteepnefs 
and roughnefs of the road, to employ 4 carts in carrying 
what would otherwife have been an eafy load for 3, it is 
evident that the expenfe muft ultimately fall upon the pro- 
prietor. Though the management of the money arifing from 
turnpikes is, with great propriety, committed to the truftecs 
of the different counties, yet it may be doubted if the plan- 
ning and original diredlion of the roads be fafeft in the fame 
hands. Wherever men are interefted, there they arc not 
competent judges •, this is perhaps the reafon, that, in making 
roads, the pu|)lick intereft is fonietimes fq.crificed to the pre- 
tended intereft of individuals. Were the gentlemen of the 
different counties to agree, that the planning of the roads in 
their own county fliould be left to a deputation of gentlemen 
from a neighbouring one, the objeftion would, in a great 
meafure, be obviated ; for, in that cafe, private or political 
intereft would have fmall influence. With regard to the great 
roads through the kingdom, would it not be of advantage to 
the nation, were commiflioners appointed by parliament, un- 
der proper reftridions, to fuperintend this branch of publick 
police ; and if a or 3 engineers were added to the commif- 
fion, we might reafonably expeft, that beauty and utility 
would foon be united, and their joint labours tend, in a eon- 
fiderable degree, to promote the publick good.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5025693">CAMBUSNETH AN</name>. 



^County of I^anark, Synod of Glasgow and Ayr, 
Presbytery of Hamilton.) 



By the Rev. Mr. John Lockhart.</head> 



<p>Namej Situation, Extent, Rivers, &amp;c. 

CAM-UISE, in the Gaelic language, fignifies " curve, 
or bend of water." The old church of this parifh 
ivas fituated near a fine bending of the rirer Clyde, and feems 
to have been dedicated to St. Nethan, whom Archbifliop Uflier, 
in his Britt. Ecc. Ant. calls " Rcligiofiflimus at doaiffimus 
Nethan." This faint is fuppofed to be the St. Nedanus, men- 
tioned in D. Chambers's catalogue. This parilh is fituated 
in the middle ward of Lanarkftiire, and commiffariot of Ha* 
milton and Campfie. The length of the pariih, in a N. E. 
direftion from Clyde to the confines of Whitburn, is nearly 
12 and its average breadth about i\ En glilb miles. It js

54 miles diftant from Glafgow, 9 from Lanark, and. 4 from 
Hamilton, which is the market and poft-town. The Clyde 
affords falmqn, pike, trout, and parrs. The Calder is little 
more than a rivulet, and is remarkable for the beautj of its 
banks. There is another fmall ftream, which runs acrofs th? 
higher part of the parifti, called the Auchter. 

Surface and Soil. — The haughs on the Clyde are extenfivt; 
and beautiful. A confiderable part of them forms a lawn in 
front of the manfion-houfe of Cambufnethan j the other part 
is regularly enclofed, and well cultivated. On the bank, 
which rifes over the haugh-grounds, there are extenfive or- 
chards ; behind thefe, coppice- woods, or regular plantations, 
afford a complete Ihelter from the eafterly winds. From the 
river to the fummit of the bank, the average diftance is about 
\ of an Englifli mile : from this fummit, the parifli has, upoa 
the whole, a gentle rilTe to its fartheft; point, which mull be 
of confiderable elevation. The foil is generally clay, with a 
till bottom ; but as the clay is, in fome places, much flronger 
than in others, or the foil much deeper, there are very differ- 
ent degrees of fertility. In the middle, and higher part of 
the parifli, the foil is mo%, or mixed with a black fand, pe- 
culiarly unfavourable to vegetation. The foil of the lower 
diftria produces very good grain, and is capable of great im- 
provement. 

Agriatlture. — Oats are the chief objeft of attention. Many 
content themfelves with raifing two or three crops of this 
kind, and then lay their fields in grafs. In the cafe of fum- 
mer fallowing (a praaice which has not, till of late, been 
i;)troduced into this parifli), the ploughing is performed 
•with two horfes: however, except in this cafe, the old 
Scotch plough, which cannot be drawn by lefs than three 

YoL. XII. 4 g 



57^ Stat'ijiical Account 

horfes, is almoft univerfally employed. The farmers, who 
p:rf3fl in the ufe of this inftrument, feem difpofed to think, 
that where the ridges are properly levelled, the two horfe- 
plough is, in all refpefts, preferable. It is found moft expe- 
client to have the ridges gently rounded, and of a moderate 
breadth *. Jhe farmers in the lower part of the parifti fre- 
quently adopt the following rotation of crops, and mode o£ 
culture : ift year, oats, f lime on the fward ; ad, peafe, or 
beans; 3d, oats ; 4th, fummer fallow and wheat ; dung laid 
on the land in fallow ; 5th, peafe, or beans ; 6th, oats or bar- 
ley, laid down with grafs-feeds. The ground then lies in grafs 
for 5 or 6 years. Tne following rotation and mode of cul- 
ture have been lately introduced by an Englifh improver : ift 
year, oats ; 2d, fallow and wheat. The dung and lime are 
wholly applied to this crop : the lime is put on hot in pow- 
der ; after which there are two ploughings, then the dung is 
put on ; the dung is ploughed down, the lime up ; 3d, peafe, 
or beans ; 4th, barley and grafs-feeds. 

Jients Good land rents from ^o s. to 30 s. the acre. The 

valued rent of the whole parifh is 5400I. 10 s. Scotch. The 
real rent is moderately calculated at 3300 1. Sterling, ex-

. The fcarcity in the year 1782. led Mr. I^ankm of Glafgow, who was mi, 
lifter of the parim at that time, to calculate the annual produce of gram on an 
average when it appeared that there was a produce of 11,520 bolls, of which 
it was fuppofed 20S0 might be for exportation. As the farmers, m this parxfln, 
many of them againft their intcreft, depend on the plough for payment of their 
rert they muft have fuffered confulerably on that dccafion. The ufoal furplus

Fences and Orchards.— i:hoxn.ht&amp;gts are generally pre. 
ferred, but as the nature of the foil expofes them to the dan- 
ger of becoming fogged, it has been found neceffary to have 
the mound, in which the thorns are inferted, highly raifed and 
enriched with dung. The ftrongeft clay is preferred for dr^ 
chard ground. On an average, the annual value of the fruit 
raifed on an acre of land, is fuppofed to amount to 10 1. Ster- 
ling. When we reckon, along with this fum, the value of 
the undergrowth, which is little Ihort of what the land would 
yield, if cultivated in the ordinary way, ftill more, when w e 
confider that fruit-trees thrive befit on thofe inacceffible fpots 
which could not be employed advantageoufly in railing any 
other produce, we ftiall be fenfible of the great profit to be de-. 
rived from this way of employing land, where the foil and 
climate are favourable A profitable orchard fias a large pro- 
portion of pear-trees. 

Minerals, &amp;c. — There is abundance of excellent coat, ca- 
pable of being wrought with great eafe : It is, therefore, ex. 
tremely probable, that the propofed caual betwecfi Edin- 
burgh and Glafgow, will have its coUrfe through this parifli. 
The price of 8 cwt. of coal, is is. 6d. The colliers have,^ 
in general, half the coal put out, as wages. Many of the 
colliers employed here, betook thernfelves to their difagree- 
^ able labour at an advanced period of life ; but" they abundant- 
ly compenfate for their want of regiilar training, by their fo- 
briety and diligence. In this, as well as in all the neigh- 
bouring parifhes, there are great quantities of iron-ftone. 
There is likewife abundance of free-ftone. As the materials 
for making roads are very bad, it requires conftant atrentiori, 
and great expcnfe to keep the roads in proper repair.

Villages. — The late increafe of inhabitants is partly owing 
to the proximity of the Omoa iron-works, in the pariih of 
Shotts, but chiefly to the convenient fituation of a village oa 
the lands of Wifliaw and Coltnefs. This village had no ex- 
iftence 20 years ago. In confequence of its ereftion, there 
are few cottages attached to particular farms, and another 
village, lefs conveniently fituated, which was formerly of 
confiderable extent, is faft going into decay. Of the tradeC 
men, who inhabit the village, and indeed the pariih at large, 
there are few employed by manufafturing companies ; and 
therefore it feems unneceffary to give a particular lift of dif- 
ferent profeffions. 

Roads. — The great road from Glafgow to Lanark, runs 
through the pariih. It will be little frequented, when the 
new road on the S. fide of the Clyde is finiflied. The fla- 
tute-labour has been chiefly devoted to the lower part of the 
parifli. 

Ecchjiajlical State — It appears that this pariih was for- 
merly attached to the abbacy of Kelfo. When the Reforma- 
tion took place, the teinds were granted to the family of 
Roxburgh. The Duke of Hamilton is now titular. Mr, 
Lockhart of Caftlehill, proprietor of the eftate of Cambuf- 
nethan, is patron. The value of the living, exclufive of 
manfe and glebe, amounts to nearly 130 1, Sterling. The 
ftipend is chiefly paid in oat-meal. 

School and Poor. — The fchoolmafter's falary is 200 merks. 
He has a free houfe, but no garden. The average number 
of fcholars is about 60. The fchool-wages a-quarter, are, for

<p>Name, Extent, Surface, Soil, &amp;c. 

fT^HE parlfh takes its name from a rivulet, or burn, which 
difcharges itfelf into the fea, about 200 paces below 
the church. The form of the parifh is irregular, its extent 
from E. to W. along the fea-coaft, or Murray Frith, is 6f 
miles, the church being nearly in the middle, and clofe to the 
fea ; from the N. E. to the S. W., it extends about 9 miles 
habitable, befides a large extent of mofs and moor ground. 
Its breadth from the church on the N. coaft fouthward, is 6^- 
miles ; but between the S. E. corner of the parifh, and the 
relt of the pariflb of Aberdour, part of the parifh of Tyrie, 
for about a mile of breadth, intervenes, and cuts off 3 farm 
towns, extending, where broadeft, about a mile and a half,

and much about the fame length ; and where there arc 93 in- 
habitants. This detached part of the parifti is believed to have 
been formerly grazing places for the tenants on the fea-coaft 
of the lands of Aberdour, of which barony it is ftill a part. 
The face of the country is very uneven, and the foil of very 
clifterent qualities : the foil of the corn-fields on the fea-coaft 
is partly clay, or red loam, but moftly of a light black, or 
gravelly quality ; and in the moors, the foil is light black, cold 
and watery. In the W. fide of the parifh are 3 deep hollows, 
with a rivulet jn each, called the den of Aberdour, the den of 
Auchmedden, and the den of Troup. Each of thefe dens, as 
they advance from the fea-coaft, branch out on each fide into 
piany other lefler ones, till they end at laft in moffes and 
moors, about 2 or 3 miles from the fea. On each fide of 
thefe dens (as they are called), for about a mile, or Jittle more, 
from the fea, the ground is moftly arable, and, in general, of 
a kindly foil, producing pretty good crops of grain, when pro- 
perly managed ; but the high ground, or ridge between them, 
is a wretchedly poor heath, incapable of any improvement 
for the moft part, but at an expenfe far beyond what it could 
ever repay, unlefs fituated in the neighborhood of a great 
town. The burn in the weftmoft of thefe dens is the boun- 
dary between the parifties of Aberdour and Gamery. The 
E. fide of the parifh is more level;, and confifts of corn-fields, 
fome of a pretty good foil, others very poor, interfperfed 
\vith heath, aiid near the fea, with large tracks of ground, 
producing a coarfe kind of grafs, called by the country peo- 
ple rceilc. In the S. part of the parifli is the den of Glafty, 
in which runs alfo a burn, the head of the N. branch of the 
river Ugie, into which it difcharges itfelf at Rora, in the pa- 
rifti of Longfide, pafling by the church of Strichen in its way.

rock to the land, the breadth 12 feet, where it joins the land, 
but decreafes gradually, till it reach the entry of the caftle, 
where it is only about 4 feet wide. Here the rock has been 
cut, but in place of the 4j^aw-bridge, which (it is probable) 
has formerly given accefs to the caftle, the narrow rock is 
made up with eartl^, in order to enable the tenants' cattle to

betvve^n the cnftle and Ipririg, And tradition fays, that it was this C'ircumftance 
which obliged Henry de Beaumont, the Ewglilh Earl of Huchan, to capitulate, 
vvhen befieged therein by Andrew Murray, regent of Scotland, during the cap. 
tivity of King David Eruce, in the year 133^. 

* The tradition is, that the Danes having landed on tfte Buclian coaft, and 
pillaging the CoiVntry in their way to Mufray, then in jiaolfeffion of their coun- 
trymen, were tome up with, at the plact virhere now ftand the cairns of Memfie 
in the parifli of Rathen, by the Scotch army, and defeated, three of their leaders 
being flain, over whofe buried bodies the 3 cairns there were raifed, on the very 
fpot where each of them fell ; that the Danes retreated, arid were again over- 
taken and defeated at Coburty, th6 cairn being raifed over the graves of their 
flain ; and that the remains of this Baniih army v/ere finally defeated and cut 
to pieces, on a heath about a quarter Of a mile W. from the church of Gamery,

heritors in the parifti, the Earl of Aberdeen, who has that part 
of the parifli W. from the church, and Mr. Gordon of Aber- 
dour, that on the E. of it, and who refidesonhis eftateat Aber- 
dour houfe. The fabrick. of the church is very old, being 
built before the Reformation, but in what age is not known. 
About 30 years ago, the aile was rebuilt, and fome years af- 
ter, the fteeple was rebuilt ; but the reft of the fabrick is in a 
bad ftate of repair, and the fchool-houfe is quite ruinous *. 

Language, Difpojition of the People, &amp;c. — Though the lan- 
guage fpoken in this diftrift is a dialeft of the Englifli, known 
by the name of broad Buchan, yet the ancient names of pla- 
ces fecm to be derived from the Gaelic, fuch as Achlin, Ach- 
nagan, Auchmadden, Bracklamore, Achintum, 8cc. The peo- 
ple, in general, are fober and induftrious; and, tiU of late 
years, were fo peaceable, and fo little inclined to litigation, 
that for 14 or 13 years after the year 1766, there was only 
one fmgle inftance of a law-fuit going from this parifh to the 
courts at Aberdeen, and that arofe from a diflference between 
two tenants, about the boundaries of their refpeftive farms ; 
every other difference fubfifting between parifliioners being fet- 
tled 

* Befitles the parifli fchool, thcrfi is another fchool in the ccffner of the pa- 
rifli near the fifliing-town, the teacher in which inftrufts young children in read- 
ing englifli, in writing and arithmetic, and is commonly a tradefman, and re- 
ceives from the church feffion, befides the ordinary fees paid by the fcholars, a 
yearly falary of 1 1. is. 8 d. Sterling, out of the intereft of money mortified 
lor that purpofe by one of the lairds of Anchmedden, and his lady's fifter, Lady 
Jean Hay, a daughter of the Earl of Kirinoul, of which mortification the church 
feflion are made truftees. This fchool has been of great fervicc to that corner. 
There is alfo a woman lives within a quarter of a mile of the church, who has 
taught young children to read englifli, and knit ftockings, upwards of 40 
years with great fuccefs ; and what is very extraordinary, has Itill a few fcho- 
lars who make very good progrefs under her inftrudlion, though flie is upwards 
of 90 years of age. Her nam. is Jean Lefly ; flic has been a very ufeful member

tied bj artitration. But of late years, from the frequent fe- 
queftrations or profecutions for debts, the parifhoners are bet- 
ter acquainted with lawyers, and confequently are more fre- 
quently engaged in law-fuits. 

Manufa&amp;ures.— The women are employed, partly for mak- 
ing coarfe fergfes for home confumption, but principally ia 
fpinning linen yarn for the merchants, and by means of thefe, 
and breeding black cattle, the fubtenants and fmaller farmers 
make a fliift to pay their rents to their landlords. No other 
kind of manufadure is carried on in this parifli. What would 
be moft profitable for us would be fifhing; but the re- 
flraints laid upon that bufinefs, by the falt-laws, difcourage 
private perfons from engaging in it ; frauds, lio doubt, ought 
to be prevented, but certainly fome remedy might be found 
for fe veral of the many hardfliips brought upon thofe concern- 
ed in the fiihing bufinefs by thefe laws, without prejudice to 
the revenue. 

ProduBions, — As to vegetables and plants, there are none 
but what are common in the country, except in the den of 
Auchmedden, where there are fome rare herbs. And for trees^ 
except a few fruit-trees in the garden of Aberdour, and in 
the minifter's garden, there is not one that deferves the name 
of a tree, though, in former times, it is evident that there has 
been plenty of growing timber. The principal produdions 
of this parilh are barley^ bear, beans, peafe, oats, turnips, po- 
tatoes, greens, and cabbages. The ftaple commodity along 
the coaft, is barley, bear, and beans ; and, in the moors, 
oats. In the year 1766, there were fearceiy 10 acres of fawn 
grafs within the parifli, and not one cfunce of hay made ; now 
every fubtenant or cottager who has a croft of land (and 
there arc only 3 trad^fmen in the parifli who have no croft), 

6 has 



Stdtijiicai JccoUnt 



has lefs or more of fown grafs. The quantity of grain pro- 
duced cannot be afcertained, as few of the farmers meafure' 
their corns," or weigh their meal, except what part of thefef 
they feU. 

Mode of CUltivatiGn, &amp;c.'— Since the introduftion of tur- 
6ip crops, the farmers, in general, take a rotation of crops 
in their infields. After the turnip crop, they fow the field' 
with bear, clover, and rye.grafs' feeds: when the grafe is' 
brokeil up the third or fourth year, the grotin'd is fown with 
oats, next year with bear or barley, the third with peafe or 
turnip, and the fourth with bear and grafs-fdeds : But this 
only during the former years of their fhert leafes. The out- 
fields, when unimproved, are worn out with crops after lime, 
are employed as folding for their cattle, or as faughs (as" 
they are called)', a parfral kind of fallow, and according to" 
the old abfurd praftice, carry fucceffively 5 or 4' crops of 
oats. The old Scotch plough, and a mixture of Scotch and; 
Englifli ploughs, are ufcd in this diftrift. Befides the dung 
of their cattle and peat alhes, which are every where ufed as 
a manure, the farmers oh the fea-coaft make ufe of fea-ware^ 
and they, as well as' the other farniers throughout" the parifh/ 
ufe lime and likeWife' broken (hells mixed with fea-fand, which 
laft they draw from the' neighbouring parifh of Pitftigo, and' 
which produces the falrie effedl as lime. This mixture of ihell 
and fand was difcovered only a ffew years ago, by Mr. Wil- 
liamfon, a gentleman employed by the Society at Edinburgh,' 
for making new difcoVeries of mines, &amp;.c. and who recom- 
mended the ufe of it to the late Mr. Garden of Troup, on' 
whoft eftate it was difcovered, who firft ufed it himfelf,' 
and encouraged his tenants to follow his example, which' 
is now become the general pradtice. ITie lime is partly 
brought from the parifh of Ratheri, diftaht of 6' or 7 miles,' 

partly

yardj the produft of limeftone brought by fea from thf? 
i^uarries in the Boyn, and partly from limeftone dug up 
v/ithin the flood-mark of the fea, in the bay of Aberdour, 
at low- water ; but this lajl begins to be fcarce and hard to be 
got at. There are, befides, two other quarries of a kind of 
red ftone, the lime of which, though of a fandy quality, an- 
swered very well when lajld upon tl)e ground, but required a 
larger quantity but both thefe quarries are either worn out 
or over-run, and have npt ^een worked for feveral years. 

Jmprovements. — Notwithftanding what is faid above, very 
^ew folid, fubftantial, and permanent improvements have been 
made in this pariftj for the laft 30 years, except upon two 
farms, where ^he tenants have longer leafes than is ordinarily 
given here ; the one gf thefe had a leafe of the Mains of Co- 
burty, to himfelf and his heirs, for the fpace of 19 years, 
and after the expiration of thefe, a liferent to the then pof- 
feflbr ; the tenant of this farm and his fon have done a great 
(3eal, andmoft fiibftantially, by draining, trenching, liming, 
and dunging their farm, by enclofmg a cpnfiderable part of 
it with good ftone fences, for which purpofe, they were fup- 
plied with ftones from the cairn formerly mentioned, and by 
building a fet of elegant office-hpufej, figr which houfes and 
fences, the heirs of the prefent tenant are allowed the efti- 
mated value at the expiration of his leafe. The other tenant 
has alfo very much improved his fajrm, but has made no en- 
.clofures, having nothing ajlowed him by the proprietor for 
that purpofe, he has a liferent tack for himfelf, and 19 years 
for his fon, upon a rife of rent agreed upon. That others 
have not imitated their example, is not owing to their igno- 
rance of the advantage, nor of the methods of improving 
their farms ; nor do they want the means and materials ne- 
ceiTary for that effeft ; but to various other caufes, which 

have 



584 Statijiical Account 

have hitherto hindered, and ftill muft impede the improve- 
ment of our country. The principal of which, is fhort 
leafes, which (except in the inftances mentioned above) never 
exceed 19 years, often not fo many. When the farmer en- 
ters upon the poffeffion of his farm, he generally proceeds 
with great fpirit in improving it according to his ability, and 
fometimes even beyond it, for the firft 10 or 12 years of his 
leafe ; but being fenfible that this will only tempt others to 
envy and fupplant him, and the more fo, as there are fo few 
inftances of farms to be had, but in an exhaufted ftate ; he 
therefore not only ftops fliort in his improvements, but con- 
tinues to fcourge the ground to the expiration of his leafe, as 
the proprietor is not inclined to renew his leafe with him, 
till it is upon the point of expiring. And thus, after all he 
has done upon it, his farm is left by him in as bad, if not 
a worfe condition, than when he entered to it. Another 
hinderance to improvement, is the time necelfarily taken up 
in cutting and bringing home peats for the tenants them- 
felves, and leet peats (as they are called) for their landlords ; 
this takes up mofl of the fummer, the moft proper feafon for 
carrying on their improvements. Add to this, their ftraitcn- 
ed circumftances, the rents of their farms being doubled, and 
in fereral inftances more, in the laft 30 years, and upon the 
expiration or fall of a leafe, fines or graflums being ftill paid, 
and that to a pretty high extent, though the ground ftill con- 
tinues in its priftine, or in a worfe, ftate : and the only ad- 
vantage, the prefent tenant has over his then predeceflbrs, is 
a little higher price for his grain, and the advanced price of 
cattle : and to balance this, the expenfe of managing his farm 
is in that period of time almoft tripled. It is hoped, how- 
ever, that the proprietors of land will fee their miftake, and 
grant their tenants longer leafes ; for it is the fettled opinion 
of the moft intelligent people in this country, that if tenants 

got 



Of Ahcrdou7\ ^85 

got leafes of their farms to themfclves and their heirs, for 
3. or 4 £9 years, they could not only afford to pay the 
prefcnt rent, which diftrefles them, but live conifortahly, 
and at the fame time improve their farms, render them far 
more valuable to the proprietor and his family, and pre- 
vent the difagreeable neceflity of frequent fequeftrations for 
rents. As to the obftacle of improvement, ariling from the 
time neceflarily taken up in providing and bringing home 
their fuel, it is hoped, that the laudable and ufeful ftep tak.i:n 
by the Legiflature in abolifhing the duty upon coals carried 
coaftways, will be produftive of the happieft confequences. 
Were all fuch obftacles to the improvement of the country, 
and other bars to induftry, which impolitic laws throw into 
the way, removed, our country bids fair to advance in im- 
provement, with a rapidity hitherto unknown. 

Milljione ^tarries. — There are two millftone quarries in 
the parifli, one belonging to the Earl of Aberdeen, in the 
land of Auchmedden, in the face of a very high rock over- 
looking the fea, and whofe foot is walhed by it at full tide ; 
to 'this quarry, the workmen, from a tremendous height, de- 
fcend by a kind of Hair cut out of the rock, and where this 
fails, by ladders reaching from one fhelf of the rock to 
another. When the rhilHlones are finifhed, they are pufli- 
cd over the remaining precipice, and fall at the foot of the 
rock, on a fmall fandy beach dry at low-water, but covered 
by the tide when it flows. From this the millftones are con- 
veyed by lea, and landed at the mouth of the burn of Troup, 
the weft boundary of the parifli. The other miUftone quarry 
is alfo cbfc by the fea, upon the lands of Coburty, belong- 
ing to Mr. Gordon of Aberdour, but is now ncglefted. AnJ 
all along the coaft is found a kind of red freeftone.

Observations on the foregoing Table. 

The number of the inhabitants, as ftated in the table, is from a(5lual enu- 
meration : fo is the number of tradefmen, and thofe of other occupations. 
Their ages are as near the truth, as could be obtained, and it is prefumed, 
pretty accurate. The fmall decreafe of the inhabita»ts of this parifh fince the 
year 1769, is not owing to the number of deaths exceeding the births, as ap- 
pears from the table ; but to a couftant drain of young people, who leave the 
parifh. Many of the young men, defpairing of getting a comfortable, or in- 
deed any kind of fettlement here, remove to towns, either to learn or profe- 
cute their refpeAive trades ; others of them to fuch places as give higher wages 
to larm-fervants. And young women repair to towns, where they are em- 
ployed as fervants, and not only to the neighbouring towns of Aberdeen, Banff, 
&amp;CC. but even to Edinburgh and London. Bcfides, in this current year, a great- 
er number than ordinary have died, fcveral young people of putrid fore ihroats, 
but the greater part old people. The people here are very inattentive to the 
regiftratiug their children's births or baptifms ; fo that no authentick informa- 
tion can be got from tlie parifli regifter ; hut the annual average of births, ac- 
cording to the regifter, and making, allowance for fuch as may have been ne- 
gledled to be regiftrated, may amount to the number ftated in the table. No 
regifter of deaths orsburials was kept hexe, till the late adt of parliament lay- 
ing a tax upon burials, &amp;.c. Since that time, the fchoolmafter has kept one, 
but many people are averfe to the meafure of regiftrating their friend's death ; 
befldes, fcveral of the parilhioners of Aberdour are buried elfewhere, and ftran- 



Of Aherdour, 



589 



gcvs, on the other hand, bury here : But the annual average, as in the table, 
\vill be found to be very near the truth. The regifter of marriages has all a- 
long been accurately kept; and from it is the article of marriages in the table 
taken. The average of births from each marriage, is calculated from a hun- 
dred known inftances in the neighbourhood of one another. It appears from 
the table, that the number of foldiers and failors employed in his Majefty's feri 
Tice in the laft w^ar, amounts to upwards of the eight part of the whole males 
refiding in the parifh at this time, from 20 to 50 years of age ;^ a very large pro- 
portion indeed, belides thofe employed in the merchant fervice,' which farther 
accounts for the fmall decreufe of inhabitants. The number of the horfes, as in. 
the table, is from adlual enumeration. And fo is that of the black cattle an* 
Uieep, as it flood in fummer 1792, when their numbers are higheft ; ivitb this 
difference, however, that being obliged, from the reluftance of the lower rank 
of people (through ignorance or prejudice) to inform as to the number of their 
black cattle and flieep, to employ others than the owners in the enumeration, 
their reports cannot be equally depended upon : but of thefe laft, the numbee 
was but fmall, and deviates, at moft, only a little from the truth. The flicep, 
in general, are of the north country breed, only about 20 of the Englifli breed 
of the polled kind ; but along the coaft, are a good many of a mixed breed be- 
tween the two. The number of flieep has much decreafed fince the introduc- 
tion of winter keeping, the flieep walks being too confined to enable the owner 
to pay a fliepherd for the whole year, and reap any profit befides from his fmall 
flock. All thefe feveral forts of cattle, being, in general, but fmall, may be 
cftimated at prcfent, at the following average value, viz. horfes from 5I. to 61. 
black cattle from 2I. to 3 1., and flieep at 6 s. Sterling. This is the opinion of 
the moft knowing people the writer of this article has converfed with upon the 
fubje£l, but he does not fuftain himfelf a competent judge in thefe matters. 
Generally fpeaking, and with few exceptions, there are as many carts as horfes 
employed in the fummer time in bringing home fuel; but as a good rriany young 
horfes are reared, who are unfit for drawing in the cart, the carts, as in the 
table, are computed to be in proportion to the horfes, in the ratio of 4 carts to 
5 horfes. The ploughs are drawn, fome few in the moorland part of the parilh, 
by 6 fmall horfes, 2 or 3 ploughs by 8 o.xen and 2 horfes ; and through the reft 
of the parifti, t few are drawn by 2 horfes, but the greater part by 4, or % 
horfes and 2 oxen, and thefe laft are moft approved of. 

In ftating the funds belonging to, and difljurfements made to the poor, it was 
not thought fair to go back fo far as the years 1783 and 1784, when the wants 
of the poor required an extraordinary fupply ; and accordingly a confiderable fum 
was adually diftributed : But the average is taken from the year 1792, and 6 
preceding years, when there has been no extraordinary demand ; and the fum

rT~'HE na,me of the parifh is Gaelic, and means a place 
between the banks of two rivers, which is high- 
Ij defcriptive, not only of the place where the church 
ftands, but likewife of a traft of ground about a mile fquare, 
extending towards the coaft, on the N. of which runs the 
Cowie, and on the S., the Carron, two fmall rivers with 
high banks. The parifti is about 10 ftatute miles in length, 
■between 5 and 6 in breadth, and contains 19,606 Scotch 
acres, or 24,914 Englifli, according to a furvej of the county

ble ; the reft is barren ground, confifting of moffes and moors 
covered with heath and ftones, chieflj granite. 

Face of the Country — The parifh may be divided into three 
diftrifts The traft of country lying between the Cowie and 
Carron from the coaft, about 3 miles to the W., has a rich 
and fertile appearance. Clofe to this diftrift, ftands the man- 
fion-houfe of Mr. Barclay of Urie, on a rifiag ground near 
the river Cowie, the floping banks of which are planted with 
trees towering one above another. This plantation, which 
extends an Englifti mile to the W., and as far to the E. of 
the houfe, on both fides of the river, prefents a moft de- 
lightful appearance, and the vaft extent cf highly cultivated 
ground divided into larg iields, and enclofed with thorn 
hedges, greatly heighten the beauty of the profpeft. The 
traft of 'ground in this diftri£l, between the church and the 
coaft, about 20 years ago, was chiefly moor covered with 
Ihort heath, furze, and broom ; now it is almoft all en- 
clofed, and in a ftate of high cultivation. What part is not 
fo, is planted with Scotch firs, larix, afh, Stc. which are in a 
very thriving ftate, and will add confiderable beauty to the 
appearance ot the country in a few ^ears. At regular dif- 
tances, neat commodious dwelling-houfes of ftone and lime, 
and covered with flates, are built by the proprietor, Mr. Bar- 
clay, for his tenants. This circumftance is mentioned to 
lliow the rapid progrefs of improvement in this place. A- 
bout two m les S. W. from Urie, is the manfion-houfe of 
FetterefiTo, formerly the refidence of the ancient and noble 
family of .Mi^rifchal, and now of Mr. DufF, fon of the late 
Admiral DufF, who purchafed the eftate from the York-build- 
ing Company in 1782. The fite of the houfe is fnug and 
warm, and furrounded with fine old trees, which, together 
with the adjoining improved fields, exhibit a beautiful ap- 
pearance.

fearance. The fecond diftrift llretches along thfc coaft, and 
comprehends the eftates of Cowie, Muchals, and Elfick. 
Here the face of the country has but a bare appearance, as 
there are no treesj exceptuig a few at the manfion-houfes of 
Muchals and Eliick. There are, however, rich corn fields 
enclofed with ftone or earthen fences on both fides of the 
poft-road that runs through this part of the parifli, which 
gives the country a fertile appearance. Tiie lands of Moun- 
quich, lying 5 miles W. from the coaft, form the third dif- 
tnd. The face of the country here^ in general, is not fa- 
vourable. In one particular fpot, however, great improve- 
ments have been made of late, which, amidft the gloomy 
wafte which every where furrounds it, prefents an agreeable 
profpea. Mr. Silver, a native of this diftrid, made a pur- 
chafe of the eftate of Netherby, on his return from the Weft 
Indies, where he built a genteel modern dwelling-houfe, with 
a complete fet of offices, which, fince his death, have' been 
greatly improved by his fon. He likewife planted feveral 
pieces of moorifli ground with Scotch firs, afli, and oak, &amp;c 
which are in a very thriving ftate ; and highly improved ani 
cultivated about ico Scotch acres, which he enclofed in fmall/ 

' fields, with ftone fences and hedge rows of afli ; by which 
means, and the very great improvements he made on the ftate 

. of the roads, the inhabitants here are happily put on a foot,

ferves to be remarked, that the people who refide near th.

70, and fome of them to 80 years of age, and upwards. ^

Coajl, Tijb, Harhours, &amp;c.-The coaft from Stonehaven 
to the N. bou.id.iry of rhe parilh, extends nearly 7 EngUfli 
miles. It is bold and rocky. There is one biy, called the 
Bay of Stonehaven, which ftretches from Downy to Garroa 
Point, th.it is, about two miles. In this bay, there is a fal- 
xnon fiQiing, the property of Mr. Barclay ; and a white fifli- 
ing, the pr .perVy of Mr. Innes of Cowie. Three boats are 
employed in this filhiiig,. with fix hands to each boat. The 
fiih caught here, are ling, cod, turbot, (kale, haddocks, &amp;c. 
which are confumed by the people in the neighbourhood. 
There are likewife two cieeks or fmall harbours, one at 
Muchals, another at Sketraw. At the former, there were 
twafifliing-boats, which were loft in a ftorm about 30 years 
ago, and the crews periihed, fince which time they have n..t 
been replaced. At the latter, there are 7 boats of much the 
fame fize, and having the fame number of hands with thofe 
at Cowie. The fifli caught here are likewife confumed by 
the people in the adjacent country. Here, by the way, it 
defcrves to be remarked, that a Mr. Maekie, lately from the 
Weft Indies, made a purchafe of the lands of Sketraw, m 
1788, where he has built a very good dwell.ng-houfe, and 
madJ very great improvements, having, in the fpace o» 3 
years encloled with flone lences, and highly cultivated, about 
6 Scotch acres, part of which was formerly barren, covered 
with heath and furze. He continues to carry on his im. 
provements. with great fpirit and induftry. 

Population -Th^ population of FetterefTo is not fo great 
as -t was f rmerly, though it is ftiU fomewhat higher than it 
was ao years ago. By an exad furvey taken in .^6^, the 
- number was 3500. The return to Dr. Webfter in 1755.

«reare, upon the whole, In 35 years, from 1755 to 179 , is 
588. The above mentioned decreafe, is owing chiefly o two 
or more farms being turned into one ; a praftice not uncom- 
mon here. The births, at an average, are 70 i the marriages 
35 ; the deaths cannot be afcertained, no regifter oi" them 
having been kept. There is a Chapel of Eafe. and an £pif- 
copal meetmg houfe in the N. part of the pariOi. The num- 
ber of Epifcopalians is about 400 : they arc an obliginji, peace- 
able, decent fet of people, and live in good habi.s with thofe 
pi the Eitablilhrnent. There are no other fedaries in the parilli. 

Church, School, and Poor. — Formerly Earl M^rifchal was 
patron of the panih ; but upon the forfeiture ot the titles and 
cftate of that family in 1715, tne right of patronage de- 
volved to the King. Tlie church is old, inconvenient, and 
unfit to contain the congregation, when tully aflembJed toge- 
ther. It is 94 feet in length, within walls, and 19 in breadth, 
Oppofite to the pulpit, there is an aile, which is of fervice 
to the preacher, by eocb ir.g him to fpeak with greater eafe. 
The aile was built in 1720 ; but when the church was built, 
is not known, there being no date upon it. Neither walls 
ror roof are plaftered ; and as the floor is f om 3 to 4 feet 
lower than the furiace of the ground on the ourhde of the 
walls, pools of water fland in the area feveral days after a 
heavy rain. The buryingrground is much larger than any 
in this part of the country. There are about 2^0 tomb or 
grave {tones in it, forne of which are of an ancient date ; and 
a few have Very tine engravings upon them, done by a Mr, 
Creffwell, a farmer in the parifh, who could not form a lingle 
letter with the pen. The n.anle was built in 1726, and has 
undergone few repairs, excepting new windows in 1784,

The money belonging to the poor, is 70 1. Sterling, the in- 
tereft of which, with the weekly colleftions, feat-rents, mort- 
cloth dues,^ &amp;.c. amounts to about 40 1. Sterling yearly. 

Antiquities. — The veftige of an old camp, on an hill called 
Ree-Dikes, or the King's Dikes, appears very diftindl. It 
is an oblong fquare of 21 acres, has four outlets and redoubts 
before them, and many of the trenches are ftill pretty deep *. 
In almoft every part of the parifli, remains of Druidical 
temples are to be met with f . On the coaft about a mile and 
a half N. from Stonehaven, appear the remains of a caftle, 
the refidence of the Thanes of Cowie or Mearns %. On 4

* It is fuppofed by fome to Iiave been a Roman encampment, and to be the

tumuli, or fmail cairus, and fome very large ones, which are fuppofed to be fe- 
jiulchral monuments raifed on the field of battle to the memory of the dead. 
The moor is called the Kemp-ftane Hill, on each fide of which, there is a mo-

been a place of worfhip ; the gables and part of the walls are 
itill {landing. Adjoining to this, there is a burying-ground 
enclofed with ftone walls, where many of the people in the 
N. part of the parilh, on account of its vicinity to them» 
bury their dead. 

Rent and Proprietors. — The valued rent of the pariili is 
^5341- 4 s. 2d. Scotch, and the real rent is about 4200 1, 
Sterling. The number of heritors is 6, and of feuars 8. Two 
of the former, and 4 of the latter, are refident. Thirty years 
ago, about one half of the rent of the pari{h was paid ia 
grain, but now the grain is almoft all converted, and the rent 
is chiefly paid in money. Improved land is let from il. to 
il. 10 s. Sterling the acre. Some pieces on the coaft near 
Stonehaven are let much higher. Unimproved land from 10 s, 
to 15 s. the acre *. 

j^gricuhtire — Before 1763, farming was little ftudied here 
as a fcience, and for that reafon was not carried on according to 
any regular plan. The fpirit of inquiry into the methods prac- 
tifed in the S. parts of the country had not gone forth. Hence 
the mode of farming that had been in ufe for ages paft, was 
ftill continued. Every farmer followed the courfe which his 
father taught him, and was fatisfied. In this ftate, the 

country 

affaffinate Duncan the baftard. Sir David Dalrynople call, him Malpedir 
wh.ch he tranflates from the Gaelic, " the fervant of Peter." After him one' 
of the name of Frafer was raifed to the rank of Thane of Cowie. Sir David 
Dalrymplein his Annals, to which the reader is referred, mentions fome re- 
markable fadls relating to this family. The ancient and noble families of Lovat 
and Salton, are defcended from them, and perhaps moft of the families of that- 
name m Scotland.

years through Scotland, and a great part of England, intro- 
duted a new fyllem. Betore the above period, lime, as a

been ufed ; clearing the land of ftones, llraighting and level- 
ling, lun.mer falh-w and gieen crops, dividing and enclofing

The land was improved in this manner, by clearing it of 
ftones, many of which were fplit by gunpowder, draining, 
levelling, and enclofing, chiefly with thorn hedges. 

" Mode of Cropping Firft year, fallowed and improved 

by lime; 50 bolls of Scotch ftiells, water' meafure, to each 
acre ; 4 firlots to each boll, and 3 4 Scotch pints to each firlot. 
The lime pbughed into the land before winter, and fome- 
times the land was ploughed a fecond time before it. 1 he 
firft crop oats or barley. Second year, dunged, and fown with 
turnips, in broad caft, and hoed while any weeds appeared. 
The turnips fometimes fed off by fheep, but moft commonly 
one half drawn, and the other half fed off in alternate ridges, 
the whole ground being included in the fold. Third year, 
barley and grafs-feeds. If intended to be broken up for 
■wheat, X2 pound of broad clover, and 2 pecks of rye-grafs 
to each acre. If intended to remain for pafture, a greater 
quantity of rye-grafs, with the addition of 6 pound of white, 
and 6 pound f yellow clover, and 4 pound of rib grafs to 
each acre. That part of the land propofcd for grain, was 
folded the firft or fecond year of the grafs, and ploughed up 
for wheat or oats, which were fucceeded by turnips ; and the 
above courfe continued. 

*' Mr. Barclay has planted about 800 acres with S otch firs, 
great part of which are fiace filled up with oak, ath, beech, 
a.id larix. His tenants * in the parifb have alfo improved 
nearly the fame quantity of land which he h mlelf has do'ie,

tegular plan, above 1 2 acres of ground, with ftreets 48 feet 
wide, and a fquare of 2 acres in the middle, part of which 
is feued and built : All the houfes are roofed with flates or 
tiles. This village adjoins to the town of Stonehaven, where 
there is a fafe and convenient harbour." 

To the above account, it may be added, that Mr. Bar- 
clay's extenfive improvements are chiefly round the manfion- 
houfe ; that the fields are all fmooth and level like a bowling- 
green ; and that they ai'e let to a butcher for grazing, who 
has from 50 to 60 black cattle, and between 8oci and loco 
deep feeding in them ; by which moans the value of the 
ground mufl: be increafed in a few years.- 

It is to be regretted, that the farmers on the lands of the 
other proprietors, made no attempts towards improving their 
farms for a long while after Mr. Barclay's tenants commenced 
their operations, beeaufe they had no encouragement given 
them by their landlords. At length, however, fome of the 
moft judicious, who were in good circumftances, began ta 
drefs and lime a few acres by way of trial, for they wifhed 
to proceed with flow and cautious fl:cps. Finding by the 
crops which they produced, that their labour and expenfe 
•were fully repaid ; they made a fecond and a third trial. All 
which, anfwering beyond expeftation ; they annually drefled 
and improved pretty large fields, laying down the firft grain 
crop with grafs-feeds, till their whole farm was cultivated*- 
Animated by their example, more than by Mr. Barclay's,- 
beeaufe more on a level with their capacity and circumftan- 
ces, others were induced to improve their ground. Thus^- 
by degrees, the fpirit of improvement is become univerfal

tages which Mr. Batclay's operations and example have pro- 
duced, not in this parifh only, but through the greater part 
of this county, he has juftly merited the thanks and efteem 
of all around him;

<p>Name, Extent, Surface, Soil, &amp;C. 

WAMPHRAY is fuppofed by feme who underftand the 
Gaelic, to fignify the deep vale in the foreft." 
Others equally well acquainted with that language, can give 
no account of its etymology. If not from the Celtic, xt is 
T3erhaps derived from the Saxon language. The length of 
the parifti from N. to S., is about 5 miles, and its^eadth 3. 
Its N E. extremity is mountainous ; that part of it which 
lies along the Annan, is fertile and populous. A large brook, 
called Wamphray Water, divides it diagonally from N. E.

winding banks of this rivulet, in a deep and woody recefs, is 
fingularly romantick. 

Climate, &amp;c More rain falls in this country, than in 

many other parts of Scotland. The beft built walls, where 
expofed to the S., become damp within. The air therefore 
muft be moid, but the longevity of the people, and the in- 
frequehcy of epidemical diftempers, fufficiendy prove that it 
is a healthy diftria. The water is very pure. The foil, 
when it is cultivated, is in fome places clayey, in others gra- 
velly. There is marl of various kinds ; but, on account of 
the difficulty of digging it out, and fome other circumftances, 
it has hitherto been little ufed. Attempts have been made, 
but without fuccefs, to find coal and lead. 

Population.— The number of the people in 1755, according 
to Dr. Webfter's report, was 458. The population of the 
parifti feems to have been anciently greater tban at prefent. 
One farmer now poffeffes what was occupied 60 years ago by 
10 or 12 tenants. The population, however, has increafed 
of late, and now amounts to 487 : males 235 ; females 252. ^ 
Inhabited houfes 90. Number to each inhabited houfe al- 
moll 5^. Of births, deaths, and marriages, there has been 
no regifter kept for many years paft. There is now living, 
one perfon aged 96, one 92, one 89, three or four 86 and 
upwards. A woman who died about 12 years ago, was ge- 
nerally believed, in the neighbourhood, to be 113 years old. 
There are 3 mafons, 2 joiners, 4 tailors, 9 weavers, 2 fmiths^ 
2 ftioemakers, i furgeon. 

Heritors, Stipend, Sec. — The number of heritors is 5. Two

gular, that not one of thefe died in pofleflion of this living, 
and the prefent minifter is on the point of refigning it. 

SeEiaries — There is a meeting-houfc belonging to the fed 
pf Relief, which was built about l6 years ago, and which, 
till it became vacant laft year, was attended by many, chiefly of 
the lower clafs of people, from this ai^dfome of the neighbour- 
ing pariflies. The people of this parifh will readily return to 
the church, if a minifter whom they refped is fettled among 
them ; and that event would probably put an end to the Re- 
lief Eftablifhment here. Of Seceders of different denomina- 
tions, exclufive of thofe who ufed to attend the Relief meet- 
ings, there are about 36. 

i'oor, School. — The number of poor who, fome years ago, 
^ere relieved by colleftions in the church, was about 20. 
The parochial fchool is commonly attended by 30 or 40 chil- 
dren, who are taught reading, writing, and arithmetick. 

Agricultur:e, Stc. — The land-rent is about 1570I. The num- 
ber of ftieep is about 6000 *; black cattle 500 ; ploughs 40; 
acres in tillage about 480 ; in big and barley 40; potatoes 40 y

Great improvements have been made in agriculture within 
the laft 10 years. Thefe are in a great meafure owing to 
the encouragement given by the Earl of Hopetoun. Moft of 
his Lordlhip's lands were let laft year upon leafes, for the 
arable farms, of 21 years, for the Iheep farms, of 14. None 
of the former tenants were removed. They are, in general, 
very aftive and intelligent, and by the ufe, not only of lime, 
|)ut of green ?nd drilled crops, keep the land in excellent 
condition. Little or no lime was ufed till of late: laft year 
above aooo bvifliels were laid on, all brought from a dillance 
of at leaft 16 miles. Several farms are well enclofed, moftly 
with thorn hedges *. There is one corn-mill in the parifh : 
by the laft leafes, the tenants are relieved from the payment 
of multure f , and the miller is now paid for his work, about 
a thirtieth part of the meaj. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — The common wages of a man- 
fervant, are from 61. to 8i. a-year; of a woman, from 2I. los. 
to 4 1. A confiderable quantity of falmon is killed in the 
Annan, with an inftrument refembling a trident, called a 
liefter, in the ufe of which, fome of the young men are very 
expert. They often fiOi in winter, and in the night by torch 
light, not fcrupling to follow the falmon in the water in the 
time of froft and fnow. Thefe filh are fold at an average, at 
a^d. the pound. 

The belief in witches and apparitions feems to have pre 
vailed here to a wonderful degree, about a hundred years ago.

Songs are ftill fung defcriptive of the barbarous deeds and 
bloody feuds of fome former age, of which this parifli was 
the fcene. The road between Glafgow and Carlifle runs 
through the parifli. It was made about 20 years ago. A- 
long this road, a mail-coach pafles and repafles every day. 

Antiquities. — In the track of the above, there was a Ro- 
man road, by the fide of which, a few large ftones, each a- 
bout 5 feet high, are ftill Handing, nearly at the diftance of 
a Scotch mile from one another, and, therefore, fuppofed by 
fome to have been mile-ftones. Befide one of thefe, Charles

(CouNxr ANB Synod of Dumfries, Presbytery of liANG-

By the Rev. Mr. William BroWn.</head> 



<p>Name, Extent, Surface, Soil, Climate, &amp;c. 

ESKDALEMUIR takes its name from its being fituatcd 
at the head of the Elk, or Efek, which fignifies " ftrife;" 
this river having been famous in former times for the battles 
fought on its banks between the Scots and Englifli. The 
length of the parifh from N. to S. is 11 4- miles j and its ex- 
treme breadth from E. to W. about 8 miles. According to 
the neareft calculation, the number of acres will be about 
45,250. It was originally a part of the parifh of Wefter- 
kirk ; but in 1703, was ereded into a feparate parifli by the 
prefent name. The principal rivers are, the White and Black 
Elks, which run to the fouthward, and meet at the foot of 
the parilb, forming the well known river of Elk, which dif- 

charges

charges itfdf into the Sol way Frith. The moft remarkable 
hills are, the Pen of Efkdalemuir and Lochfell. The foil is, 
in general, very deep, but, owing to its high fituation, not 
very fertile. Moft part of it is mofs, covered with a coarfe 
kind of grafs. Along the banks of the White Elk, however, 
the hills are, in general, green, and afford excellent pafture. 
From the height of fituation, and the nature of the foil, the 
air isi in general, damp ; but fince the introdudion of drain- 
ing, it is gready improved. Property in land has changed 
often in the memory of the prefent inhabitants. It common- 
ly gives about 25 years purchafe. Meadow and arable grounds 
rent at about 10 s. an acre. 

Agriculture — In former times the inhabitants were much 
fonder of agriculture than they are at prefent. At a mode- 
rate calculation, they ploughed twice as much as they do now. 
The reafon of their leaving it off, was owing in part to the 
uncertainty of the climate, but chiefly to the great demand 
in late years for flieep and wool. At prefent, there are about 
aoo acres in conftant tillage But if the demand for flieep and 
wool increafe as it has done for fome years paft, it is probable 
that ftill fewer will be in ufe ; for they think that, in many 
places, it either hurts the fheep walks, or might be of more 
advantage in affording them a retreat in times of ftorm. For- 
merly they were wont to flock much with black cattle among 
their iheep ; but experience has taught them their error. 
They render the grounds unhealthy for fheep, and introduce 
difeafes. There arc ftill fome, however, who retain the old 
pradlice, from a defire to make fure of a part of their ftockj 
wet years being found to prove lefs hurtful to them than to 
the Iheep. They are ready, however, to acknowledge that 
they are far from being profitable ; for, after the trouble of 
keeping and feeding for 6 or 8 months, they feldom gain more,

?ine year witli another, than 20s. a-head. There are at pre- 
lent in the parifli, about 445 black- cattle. The number of 
hoi-fes will be about 75, befides the young ones that are as 
yet unfit fur hulbandry. 

But the principal produaion of this parifli is flieep, which 
ire coming daily more into requefl:. At the head of the pa- 
rifli, they are all of the fliort kind ; but lower down they are, 
the moft part, of the Cheviot breed. Some attempts were 
' ^ade to introduce them on the higher grounds, but without 
fuccef?. The general opinion of the farmers is, that the 
■ grounds are too Wet and ftormy ; that the fudden changes 
hurt them more than the fliort Iheep • and that the death a- 
Hipng the lambs is greater. The number of flieep at pre- 
fent is about 25,440. The farmei:s here are particularly at- 
tentive to the treatment of their flocks, they generally flock 
light, that they may preferve grafs for the winter and fpring. 
pey have laid afide, in a great meafure, the cuftom of milk- 
ing, bemg of opinion that it weakens the ewes, and makes 
them lefs .able to endure the winter. The wool of both kinds 
IS of good quality; and meets with a ready market. It is 
generally fmeared with tar and butter ; but fome of them are 
beginning to ufe fhe African grease* inftead of the latter 
I\Ir. Gideon Curll in Yetbyre, fmeared, fome years ago, the 
one fide of a ftieep with far and butter, and the other with 
t^rand African greafe, and found them run equally well 
The only difference was, that the wool fmeared with the tar 
iud greafe was yellower than the other, but became equally 
white after being waflied. The fuccefs of this expeiLent

ingy he found that he had -h more than ever he had any year 
before, or than he had laft year when he again fmeared with 
the butter. The wool, he aflures me, was alfo more open, 
and of better quality. This year, a number of the farmers 
have purchafed greafe inftead of butter. The difeafe to which 
the fheep here are moft fubjeft, is the rot ; which is owing, 
partly, as was fald, to the mixture of black cattle, but chiefly 
to the wetnefs of the feafons and the foftnefs of the grounds *. 

PopulatioTij 

* Since I ha-ve meationed this as the principal calamity to which this parifh' 
is fubjea, perhaps it may not be- improper, were I to add a (hort ftatement of 
Bad years, which I had from peifons of veracity and experience. In 1674, there 
were 13 drifty days in the end of February and beginning of March, O. S., 
which proved fatal to moft of the flieep in this parifli. The whole Iheep onr 
Black Eflc were deftroyed, except 40 dinmonts on the farm of Weftfide. In 
1739, the fummer and harveft were very wet. This was followed by fevere 
froft and fnow, which came on about New Year's day 1740, and lay without 
intermiflion tiU it was mfelted by the fun. On the zoth of May, the froft wa? 
fo intenfe, that the people were unable tacaft their peats. Before harveft 1741, 
oat-meal fold at 3s 3dv a-ftone ; but after harveft it fell to 1 s. Years were ra- 
ther better, though far from being good, till 174S, when another wet fummer 
and- harveft, fucceedcd by another ftorra of froft ani fnow (which began a 5th 
January 1746, and lay for 6 weeks), dsftroyed almoft the wholfe ftocks of Elk- 
dalerauir. All the farmers, exceptmg 6, were ruined by this fliock. Sheep- 
hogs fold then from 4s. 6d. to ss., long wool was 55., and (hort wool from 2od. 
to 2 s. The fummer of 1747. was fo wet, that no hay could be preferved ; but 
not fo lafting as t. do much hurt to the flieep. Yea/s were good till i7Ji. 
when another run.of bad years commenced, which lafted till i755- D«'ng 
this periodv the farmers fuffered the moft dreadful calamities; their old flieep 
x^ere deftroyed by the inclement feafons, and their lambs killed by froft and- 
^now. To this day, they are looked back upon with horror. From 1755 nl 
{^62 years were good; in which year, the black cattle, which were then far 
more numerous than they are now. were in great want from an exteffive drought- 
Stirks were bought that year by the taird of Davington at Lockerbie, for 4'- 
6d ord 5S. rhe years 1763 and 1764. were very good. In 1765, both flieep 
and black cattle fuffered greatly from another drought, accompanied with- a 
fpecics of worms which deftroyed the grafs. by cutting its roots. They were of

a green colour, and about an yich long. They appeared al?put the end of May, 
and continued till the beginning of Auguft ; when they were deftroyed by great 
flocks of crows and heavy rains. After the rains, great quantities were found 
on the fides, and at the joinings of the rivulets. They were not confined to thi* 
pariOi, but extended to Liddif4ale, Tiviotdale, and Annandale. In 1772, move 
than one-third of the fheep died by a feyere ftorm .of froft and fnow. In 1773. 
owing to the great demand from Roxburgh and the Forreft, which places had 
buffered more than this parifh, long ewes and lambs fold here for 12s. fid. and 
13's. ; long ewe lambs fold at 6s. ; long hogs at 7s. fid. and 8s. ; long wool at 
7 s. and 7s. fid. ; and Ihort wool at 3 s. fi d. In 1774, the winter was very fe- 
vere, but the farmers retired with their flteep into Annandale, and by that 
means fuftained little lofs. In 1782, the market wjth America being in a gr.eat 
meafure fliut, fliort wool fell very low. Some of the largeft parcels were fold 
here for 20 d. a-ftone. The long wool, however, fuffered no change, becaufe of 
the ready market it always found in England. Some lofs was fuftained this year 
from mock thaws *, but not conijderable ; for th,e farmers retired again into An- 
nandale. In 1785, there was one continued ftorm from the 26th of November 
till the end of March, but no lofs was felt, for the high winds always cleared 
ground fufficient for the flieep. Sheep fold very dear this year, owing to the 
general demand, occaiioned by the loffes of 1782 and 1783, in other parts. Long 
hogs fold then for los. apd los. fid. ; fliort ones at. the fame, and dinmonts foi; 
12S. and 13s. ; long wool was from 9 s. to 10 s. ; and fliort ditto from 3s. to 4 s. 
From 1785 till 1791, feafonswere excellent, arid fully compenfated thofe who 
were not ruined fey the former ones, for all their loffes.. But laft year they be- 
gan to turn worfe ; and this year flocks have fuffered very much. The general 
opinion is, that the rent of the parifli, which is far from being inponfulerable, 
would not make up the prefent deficiency of ftock. From the foregoing ftate- 
ment of fadls, we have a full confirmation of a former remark, that the great- 
eft calamity to which this parifli is fubje5l, is occafioned by the wetnefs of the 
feafons and the foftnefs of the grounds. How far this may be remedied, comes 
to be confidered afterward.

poor, before 1773, were fupplied from the weekly colledions 
at the church, and the charity of the inhabitants. But thefe 
being found to be inadequate, the heritors, at Martinmas 
1773* agreed to fupply the deficiency. On the 6th of Ja= 
nuary 1774, they affefled themfelves in the fum of 36 1. a- 
yearj to begin at Martinmas preceding, and paid quarterly, 
the one half by thernfelves, arid the other half by their te- 
nants, according to the valued rent of their eflates. This, to 
be difpofed of by a committee as they faw caufe. The num- 
ber of poor then taken on the lift was 19. Since that time^ 
the poor's rates have gradually increafed to 65 1. i8s. The 
number of poor fupplied in this way is, at an average, be- 
tween 20 and 25,

had in great quantity ; but it is often difficult from the wet- 
nfefs of the feafons to get them dried. The neareft coal is iii 
Canoby, 18 miles diftant. 

Roads — Formerly this parifli was much at a lofs for want 
of proper communication from one place to another ; but now 
there is an excellent road from Langholm to the head of the 
moor; and another from the church to MofFat, Dumfries* and 
XiOckerbie. There is only a bridge wanting over the Elk ; 
3ind this is to be fet about in a fhort time. 

Antiquities, 



^•H ' Siai'ijllcal Account 

Antiquities. — On the farm of Yetbyre, is a rery complete 
/encampment of an oval form, named Caflle-o'er, or Overbie. 
The general opinion is, that it is a Roman camp which com- 
municated with thofe of Middlebie and Netherbie ; and that 
the difference of form may have been occafioned by the fitua- 
tion ; it being placed on the top of a hill where the fquare 
form coiild not be adhered to. The name of Overbie, or Up- 
per Station, favours this opinion. As Mr. Crawford is at 
prefent taking a furvey of this parlfh for his intended map of 
Dumfries-ftiire, and will infert a llcetch of this, among other 
remains of antiquity, any farther defcription pf it would be 
jinneceflary. There is fcarcely a hill wjthin fight of it, on 
which there is not fome veftige of an outer encampment. 
From Caftle-o'er, a communication by encampments of this 
kind can eaCly be traced down the Elk to Netherbie, on thq 
one hand ; and iown the Water of Milk to Middlebie, on the 
other. A Roman caufeway has alfo betn traced from Ntther- 
tiq to near Langholm ; and there are reports that it has been 
difcQvered at the head of this parilh near the farm-houfe of 
Over-caufcway. One thing is certain, that immediately be- 
fore the houfe of that name, a pretty ftrong outer ftation is 
pafijy difcernihle. On the farm of Coatt, there a.re two cir- 
cles of eredl ftones, in the form of Druidical temples, the one 
pntirc, meafuring about 90 feet ; and the other, having a part 
of it worn away by the Elk, meafuring about 340 feet *. la 
Kientioning the remarkable things in this parilh, it would be

f As for the rock on the farm of Twiglees, commonly called the Letter 
Jtones, from the appearance of letters that fome think may be traced on them, 
»nd ef which they tell fo many fabulous ftories, they are fcarcely worth notice; 
being evidently nothing elfe than the eftedls of time on the rock, which is com- 
pofed of two kinds of ftone, the one of which is harder than the other. Fully 
as ftrong an appearance of letters may be fcen on the Watch-craigs, which are

l^fong to pafs over in filence, that piece of ground at thd 
meeting of the Black and White Eflcs, which was remark- 
able in former times for an annual fair that had been heli 
there time out of mind, but which is now entirely laid afide. 
At that fair, it was the cuftom for the unmarried perfons of 
toth fexes to choofe a companion, according to their likmg,' 
With whom they were to live till that time next year. This 
*.as ealled hand-fojling, or hand in fift. K they were pleafec! 
with each other at that time, theh they continued together ioi 
life ; if not, they feparated, and were free to make another 
choice as at the firft. The fruit of their connexion (if there 
were any) was always attached to the difafFcaed perfon. In 
later times, when this part of the country belonged to the 
Abbacy of Melrofe, a* prieft, to whom they gave the name 
of Book i' bofom (either becaufe he carried in his bofom a 
bible, or perhaps, a regifter of the marriages), came from 
time to time to confirm the marriages. ^ This place is only s( 
imall diftance from the Roman encampment of Caftle-o'er. 
May not the fair have been firft inftituted when the Romans 
refided there ? and may not the " hand-fafting" have taken its 
yife from their manner of celebrating marriage, ex ufu, by 
which, if a woman, wuh the confent of her parents or guar- 
dians, lived with a man for a year, without being abfent for 
5 nights, Ih^ became his wife ? Perhaps, when Chriftianity 
was introduced, this form of marriage may have been looked 
upon as impcrfeft, without confirmation by a prieft, and, 
therefore, one may have been fcnt from time to time for this 
purpofe. 

ImprQvemeuts,—-'t\)^t principal improvement for fuch a foil 
as this, is draining, which has been attended to of late, and 
with good fjiccefs. There is, however, an inconvenience accom-

are recorded. Nor can the rcgiJlcr of baptifms be depended on ; for, fince the

In-explanation of the above ftatement, the furveyor obferves firfl That th. 
ground marked infield and folds, amounting to 927 a*res, x rood, i6fall, make 
the wh.L. of the arabk ground that is in regular fields, that «, without much 

41a 



intervention cf baulks (patches of untilled ground between the ridges) or cairnJ 
(heaps of fmall Itones), And the reporter adds, that thcfe are tlie only grounds 
in the diftria that are ever dunged ; and the folds are dun|ed merely by the 
cattle and llicep lying in them at night, and in the middle of the day, during 
the fummer. The furveyor obferves, 

2. That the faughs, in raoft cafes, disjoined by baulks, do not really occupy 
the quantity of ground marked for them in the ftate, the arable of them being 
fometimes f , often about i, and even fometimes only i of the whole. The 
fame, he adds, may be faid of the gr.uad ndarked burnt land, theugh in it 
the arable, in general, bears a much greater proportion to the uncultivated. 

3. Under the head of pafture, is included the ground occupied by the fraall 
roads on farms, houfes, yards, dike-fides, loans (grounds around which the 
ho«fes of villagers are built, and which are coinmens), ftripes along the river 
fide, where the lands lie contiguous to the Don, moraffes, broom, &amp;c. 

The furveyor has correfled the ftatement given in the account of the length 
■and breadth of the diftriA, which the minifter gave merely upon conjefture. 
According to him, the length is fomething more than 5 miles ; as to the breadth 
he could not afcertain It precifely, as he furveyed only the eftate of Kemnay, 
•whofe mean breadth is little more than 2 miles. Lord Kintore's lands add at 
leaft another mile to the breadth, confequently the whole parifh covers a fur. 
face of about 7^ fquare miles. The furveyor fuppofes, that the higheft of the 
hills in this parilh, are not much more than 400 feet above the bed of the river 
Don. He mentions a very curious fail with regard to thofe hills. Thefe are 
his words : " The ground on the top of Paradife" (one of the hills in this dif- 
ir'iA), " and all round the fummit for fome diftance down on every fide, is an 
" excellent foil, but gradually becomes of an inferior quality as you approach 
" the bottom ; and it is not a little Angular, that all the ground on the declivi- 
*' ties of the hills throughout the whole eftate, is of a much fuperior quality, 
" to the land of the fields below, even on the banlis of the river, a ve*y few 
acres of harigh only excepted."

APPENDIX* 



NUMBER XXXIL 
Referri?ig to p. 4y3. 

It Is curious to obferve the oppofition between the opinion of the Highlander*; 
founded upon experience, and the reafoning of philofophers derived from fpe- 
culation, with refiiedt to the varying degrees of the heat and cold of the fea- 
^ons in ancient and modern times. Thofe who aflert that the feafons have be- 
come more mild and genial, maintain this opinion upon the authority of the 
claflick writers, without confidering, that in eftimating the cold and heat of 
other countries, a Greek or Roman, would naturally make their own warm 
latitudes the ftandard of their feelings. lu forming a fyftem, few fadls ferve as 
a foundation for rearing a fpecious fuperftrudure. That the quantity of water 
upon the face of the globe is decrealing, has been attempted to be proved from 
the indudlion of experiment. The philofophers of Sweden, by meafuring the 
■waters upon the fliores of the Baltick, have found that they fink in the pro- 
portion of half an inch annually. But are there no inftances in other countries, 
■where they rife in a fimilar proportion. During the ninth century, the Danes 
in their predatory excurfions, built a fort upon the Moray Frith, which is now 
covered by water, but ftill vilible in its ruins when the fea is tranquil on a fe- 
rene fummer day. It mull, however, ba acknowledged, that the above opi- 
nion of the gradual decreafe of the waters, is not a novelty in fpeculation. It 
■was embraced, in part, by the ancient fed: of the Druids, who held the de- 
ftrudlion and renovation of the world by fire and water alternately. The Stoicks 
alfo taught the fame dodlrine, as may be (ben, by confulting the fecond book of 
Gicero's beautiful Treatife, " De Natura l)eorum."
