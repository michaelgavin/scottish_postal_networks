(presbytery of deer, synod and county of 

aberdeen.) 

By the Rev. Mr. Alexander Simpson.</head>


<p>
Name, Extent, &amp;c. 

HP HE anticnt name was Philorth, concerning whofe ety- 
mology little except conjecture can be advanced. In 
the middle of the 16th century, a town was ere&amp;ed upon 
the eftate of Sir Alexander Frafer of Philorth, which, from 
the name of the fuperior, was called Fraferburgh ; and foon 

became a place of confiderable trade. From it arofe the 

prefent denomination of the whole parifh ; which, at an ave- 
rage, is about 34- miles in breadth from eaft to weft. The 
diftance between the northern and fouthern extremities, is a- 
bout 8 miles ; but the parifh of Rathen interfects, and di- 
vides ic into two nearly equal parts, each about 3 miles lonr. 
Vol. VI. A The, 



i Stalijlical Account 

The measurement exceeds 10,000 acres Along the fliore, 

to the extent of a mile into the country, the foil is generally 
good, partly clay, partly loam, or mixed. In many other 
places, are rich and fertile fields of a fimilar foil. The reft 
of the parifh is more gravelly : The arable land, efpecially in 
the upper divifion, is intermixed with moffes and muirs, co- 
vered with heath or coarfe grafs. 

Sea Coajl, Rivers, Fijheries. — The fea coaft extends about 
4 miles ; nearly two of which, to the fouth of the town, are 
low and fandy, bounded by hillocks overgrown with bent. 
The reft is rocky and fiat-, except Kinnaird's-head, a high 
land projecting into the fea, thought to be the Promontorium 
Taixalium of Ptolomy, being the turning point into the 
JEjliiariutn Vararis, or Murray Firth. — From it the land tends 
due weft on the one hand, and makes a curve to the fouth- 
eaft on the other, forming a part of the bay of Fraferburgh. — 
On this coaft, confiderable quantities of fea-weed, cut ofF the 
rocks, are manufactured into kelp. The fea has receded 
from the land in fome places, and encroached on it in others. 
— Weftward of Kinnaird's-head, is a ftony beach, evidently 
thrown up by the fea, 30 ells from, and 3 ells above, the 
prefent high water mark. Many of the benty hillocks, which 
fkirt the bay, ftand upon mofs of clay ; and in 1760,. a tree 
with roots ancTbranches, and a ftem 20 feet long, was found 
entire, under the fand within the high flood mark. By a 
ftrong fouth eaft wind, the fands on this fhore, if dry, are 
drifted ; and if not intercepted by the bents, would overfpread 
the adjacent fields. Bent ought, therefore, carefully to be 
preferved ; efpecially a very fine fort, which has lately ap- 
peared in this bay, refembling the river bulrufh in length of 
joint, thicknefs of reed, and largenefs of leaf and top. It in- 
creafes in quantity, and grows down to high water mark. 

Cod, 



of Fraferburgh. 3 

-Cod, ling, Ikate, turbot, whitings, haddocks, macka- 
rel, lobfters', and many other kinds of fifh, all of the beft qua- 
lity, and often in great quantities, are caught here in their fea- 
fons. A great part of the cod and lobfters is bought up for the 

London market. The Dutch are in the praaice of falling 

in fummer on this coaft  and in 1786, came fo near as to 
preclude the inhabitants from their ufual ftations. This 
practice has been long followed by them : and there is a tra- 
dition that, in the beginning of the laft century, their bufles 
frequented the loch of Strathbeg, about half way between 
Fraferburgh and Peterhead. Strathbeg at prefent, has no 
navigable communication with the fea, there being a bar of 
fand and bent, nearly a mile in breadth, between them ; and 
an Englifh gentleman, is now attempting to drain that loch.— 
A rivulet, called the water of Philorth, feparating the parifh- 
es of Fraferburgh and Rathen, abounds with trout, efpecial- 
ly that fpecies called the phinnick, of a fine flavour. A fal- 
mon fifhing has alfo been attempted at its mouth, and along 
the bay, but has for fome time been given up. 

Climate, Woods, Hills, t*fc— The climate is dry ; and fo 
healthy, that more than 20 perfons are how living, above 80 
years of age, and fome above 90. Continued great frofts are 
rare. Snow feldom falls before Chriftmas, and does not lie 
long on the ground. — - — This parifh appears to have a- 
bounded with wood. Large roots of trees, moftly oak, re- 
main {till in the mofles. About Philorth houfe, the feat of 
Lord Saltoun, is fome old timber ; and feveral plantations 
have been lately made there. His Lordfhip and other neigh- 
bouring gentlemen, have alfo planted fome hundreds of acres 
of heath, or land, which produced poor crops of grain, with 
various kinds of trees, which promife to be of great benefit, 

as well as highly ornamental, to the country The on- 

A 2 ly 



4 Statijlical Account 

h m in the vicinity of Fraferburgh, is Mormond, covered with 
n^ofs and heath, elevated 8,0 feet above the level of the fea; and 
themoreconfpicuous,as the countryon every fide for manymiles 
M low and champaign. Here, as at the Wrekin of Shropfhire, 

all friends around," is no unufual toaft I n different 

. places, are fine mineral fprings. An excellent one, of a cha- 
ybeate nature, refembling the waters of Peterhead, but rec- 
koned by judges more fit for weak conftitutions, was discover- 
ed, a few years ago, on the fouth eaft corner of the town. 
A well of freeftone has been built, and a neat houfe ereded 
over it, for the accommodation of thofe that chufe to drink 

the water A lime-ftone quarry among the rocks at 

Broadfea, was formerly wrought,- and not being exhaufted, 
may be opened again. The vein of lime-ftone runs fouth ; 
and, in the fame diredion, there are quarries for many miles, 
at fhort diftances from each other ; one, of an excellent qua- 
lity, is on the banks of the water of Philorth. Plenty of gra- 
nite is found in the upper divifion. Ironftone, of a good qua- 
lity, abounds among the rocks ; but the fcarcity of fuel pre- 
vents its being wrought. Very particular attention has 

been paid, of late years, to the roads in part of this diftria. 
They are made, and kept in repair by the ftatute labour, 
which the people perform personally, or by commutation. 
But a more proper and efficient plan, it is thought, might 
be. adopted. Were turnpikes eftablifhed, the roads would be in 
a better ftate. Many wifh for this alteration ; while others 
imagine that fuoh a plan is fcarcely practicable in the prefent 
ftate of the country *. 

Proprietors, 

* It is contended for, by fome refpe&amp;able proprietors in this part of Scot- 
land, that there is an abfolute neceflity either to eftablifli turnpikes, or to 
make an akcration in the nature of the ftatute labour'. — They propofe in 
each parifli a commutation into money, fomewhat nearer to the prefent va-

Proprietors, Rental, and Agriculture. There are four he- 
ritors, one of whom refides, in the pariffi, befides many feuars 
in the town of Fraferburgh. The valued rent is L. 3000 
Scotch. It is difficult to afcertain the real rent, great part be- 
ing paid in meal and bear, which vary in price •, and fome 
fervices are performed, though this cuftom is wearing out.— 
The farms are very different in fize, from the rent of L. 5 to 
upwards of L. 100. In the neighbourhood of Fraferburgh, 

land rents fo high as two guineas per acre. Agriculture 

has advanced considerably, more particularly within thefe few 
years •, and the face of the parifh is much improved. Oats, 
barley, beans, and peafe, are the molt common fpecles of. 
grain. Green crops of potatoes, turnips, and cabbages, are 
introduced; alfo clover, rye-grafs, and fallow. A little 
wheat and flax is raifed. All the lands to the weft and fouth 
of Fraferburgh, to the diftance of a mile and a half, are in- 
clofed and well cultivated. New inclofures, drains, and o- 
ther improvements, are making every year. In fome other 
parts the land is in the fame ftate, and managed in the fame 

manner, 

lue of labour for the 6 days, which are appointed to be annually wrought 
upon the roads ; and that the whole fhould be levied in money only, and 
not, accerding to the prefent ftatutes, in perfoaal LSour at the pleafureof the 
individual : — That an afTefTment on the valued rent fhould take place for the 
fupport of bridges over the county : — That every one fhould contribute in 
proportion to the ufe he made of the roads ; — and that none fhould be ex- 
empted from the amount of the fix days commutation, (fay 8dt iod, or is. 
fterling, per day), whether landholder, commiflioncr, &amp;c— That the horfes, 
carriages, carts, &amp;c. of the proprietors, farmers, &amp;c fliould pay a certain 
fum yearly and that the fund be managed as at prefent, by the commif- 
fioners within each diftri£t, and (hall be laid out in the different parifhes, ac- 
cording to the fum they pay refpeftively. This plan contains hints well en- 
titled to the confideration of landholders, in the northern, and, perhaps, 
even in the fcuthcrn parts of Scotland. 



6 Statiftical Account 

manner, and tolerably weighty crops are raifed The 

panfl, not only fupplies itfelf with provifions, but annually 
exports a large quantity of barley, oats, meal, beans, and 
potatoes, of the beft kind. 

The improvements are, in a great meafure, to be afcribed 
to the heritors, who, defirous of promoting the intereft and 
happinefs of their tenants, have bound the latter to inclofe 
their farms, and to build good houfes ; and, for their encou- 
ragement, have either given immediate pecuniary affiftance, 
and deductions of rent for a limited time, or engaged for cer- 
tain allowances at the expiration of their leafes. But though 
confiderable improvements have been made, much remains to 
be effected. The diftindtion of infield and outfield has not 
ceafed, and of confequence, an equally regular rotation of 
cropping ground has not taken place ; nor are the habitations 
of all the farmers well conftruaed and convenient. It cannot 
be expeaed that people mould depart, all at once, from efta- 
blifhed cuftoms. The bed concerted plans are effeaed only 
by degrees ; but the fpirit of induftry, which has begun to o- 
perate, if duly cherifhed, will expand itfelf. The advan- 
tages, vifibly arifing from well cultivated lands, will at length 
overcome former prejudices, efpecially when the means of 
improvement are at hand. An inexhauftible fhore of very 
fine fhell-fand and fea-ware, are on one fide of the parifh, 
and lime is on the other : All thefe are much ufed in manuring 

the ground, and found very profitable in raifing crops. 

Many cattle, are reared in the parifh, and fome fattened and 
fold at good prices. A few hogs aho are reared. The num- 
ber of horfes is diminiflied, but their fize is encreafed, feveral 
farmers now ufing only two in a plough inftead of fix or eight, 
as was cuftomary ; and oxen are again, of late, more gene- 
rally employed in doing the work on the farm. A few years 
ago, there was fcareely a farmer who had not a flock of fheep; 

but 



of Fraferburgh. 7 

but now only three or four have any at all. This is principal- 
ly owing to the introduction of turnips, fown grafs, and plant- 
ing, and the want of winter herding. The farms arc 

moftly laboured by fervants engaged for the half year. Day- 
labourers would be more for the advantage of farmers, could 
they be readily got, when wanted. The wages of men fervants 
per year, befides viauals, are from L. 4 5 10s. to L. 6 fterling; 
of women, from L. 2 to L. 2 : 10s. Of men, for {hearing in 
harveft, from L. 1 to L. 1 : 10s. of women, for ditto, from 
15s. to L. 1. Of men (hearing per day, 8d. of women, dit-

Ecchfiqflical State, Poor, School. —There are two clergymen, 
-the minifter of the eftabliflied church, and that of the Scotch 
Epifcopal church. The ftipend is two chalders of bear, and 
L. 61 : 2 : 2f in money, including 100 merks for communion 
elements. The glebe confifts of /\\ acres ; befides which, there 
is an allowance of L. 1 : 14 : oj- for grafs. Lord Saltoun is 
patron. The manfe was built in 1758, and was repaired 
lately. The church was erected about 1575. It is in the 
form of a crofs. Thofe of the Epifcopal perfuafion have late- 
ly built a very neat chapel. Their congregation is made up 
from this and fome of the neighbouring parifhes. 

The number of poor perfons receiving charity, is about 86. 
The amount of the collections and funds for their fupport, is 
at an average, annually about L„ 50. The year 1782 added 
feveral to the lift, whilft it diminilhed the public funds. 
The failure of the crop, that year, was feverely felt in this 
parifti ; but the effects of it would have been more heavy, had 
not the heritors, and gentlemen of the town and vicinity, 
contributed largely, along with the church fefiion, for the re- 
lief of the neceflitous, and likewife imported flour and grain, 
which they fold out, often under prime coft. It is pleafing

keeping, and navigation. 

Fuel and ManufaBures One great difadvantage, under 

which this parifh labours, is the want of fuel. A leat of

and three at top, and twelve feet in height, will coft the con-

cd, or commuted, or altogether taken off, it would be a great relief to 
the people. The extenfion of manufactures would be much encouraged. The 
farmers, inftead of fpending the fummer, as at prefent, in preparing and 
bringing home peats, would have leifure to attend to manure for their land; 
and the almoft exhaufted mofles i H the low country would be eafily t«rned

would bring them* down to farmers, and to the inhabitants of towns

The only manufacture is linen yarn. Dutch flax, to the 
value of from L. 1500 to L. 2000, is annually imported for 
that purpofe. The greateft part of the" yarn is exported to o- 
ther places, and wrought up there* which is a ftrong proof 
of the cheapnefs of labour ; a circurriftance which affords the 
bed grounds to hope, that whatever new manufactures may 
be introduced here, will have a very fair chance of fucceed- 

Population. -Population has been increafmg fenfibly for 

more than ten years part. In 1780, there were about 2000 
fouls in the parifh ; at prefent the number amounts to about 
2200. Of which, about 1000 refide in the town, 200 in the 
fifhing village of Broadfea, arid the reft in the country part of 
the parifh. The return to Dr. Webfter, in 1755, was 1682; 
confequently there has been an increafe fince^hat period of 5 1 8

Me of the point of Kinnaird's head, is nearly of a fquare fi- 
gure moft of the ftreets croffing each other at right angles. 
Ihe houfes are neatly built, and covered with flates or tyles. 
Many new houfes have been ereded within thefe few years, 
and feveral of them finifhed in an elegant manner. There 
are about 100 tenements, each of which contains 22 falls; 
the original price of each lot was L. 16:13:4 fterling, or 
L. 1 666 : , 3 : 4 in whole, befides an annual feu-duty of 4 s. 5! d. 
each. The old public buildings and works, viz. the tolbooth 
and town-houfe, the crofs, and the harbour, were erefted by 
Sir Alexander Frafer, the fuperior, and difponed to the feuars 
by the charter of ereftion; which is dated in (Mober .613. 
The crofs is reckoned a fine ftru£ture. It is a hexagon, with 
three equidiftant angular abutments ; the area of the bafe is 
500 feet; by 9 intrenchings the top is contrafted to 23 feet,

In 1597, the general aflembly recommended Mr Charles Farme, minifter 

here, to be principal; but it appears nothing further was done On the 

point of Kinnaird's-head, Hands another old tower, called the Wine Timer, 
fimilar in form, built on a rock over-hanging the fea. There is no commu- 
nication between the lowed and the fecond ftorey; an outer door opens into 
the third, from which there is a pafTage, through the floor, down to the fe- 
cond; no veftige of a flair, within or without, is vifible. ,Under this tower 

is a cave, penetrating into the rock more than loo feet.- In this parifh 

are fome ruins of Danifh, or Piftifh houfes, as they are called, by the coun- 
try people. Thefe aie about 10 feet fquare, with a door, and hearthflone

to demonflrate that the inabitants of Buchan were, at one time, of Scandi- 
navian origin. 



of Fraferburgh. n 

The harbour is fmall, but good. According to the tide, there 
are from 11 to 16 feet water within the harbour, and above 
20 feet immediately without, at fpring tides. Veffels of 200 
tons burden enter at prefent. Contiguous to the harbour, is 
a tolerable road for (hipping, in a bay nearly a league in 
length, and half a league broad, with good anchoring ground. 
Seven veffels, from 50 to 100 tons, employed both in the 
coafting trade and in the foreign, belong to this place. Ship- 
building has been attempted here, and has fucceeded well, ef- 
pecially fince the peace of 1783. 

Fraferburgh is well fituated for trade. In the beginning of 
this century, its commerce was equal, if not fuperior to that 
of any other town on the coaft, between Aberdeen and Inver- 
nefs. At prefent it requires only encouragement to render it 
again a port of fome confequence. Were the harbour en- 
larged, and the piers extended a few yards forward to the 
rock called the Elite, there would be an increafe of five feet 
water in it ; there would thereby, alfo, be fecured about 8 feet 
water at low tide, within the pier-heads. This improvement 
would probably be expenfive : but wind-bound veffels, and o- 
thers, of confiderable burden, would thereby find eafy accefs, 
and be fheltered in ftormy weather when they could not reach 
any harbour in the Murray Firth. Having two channels of 
entrance, one of them, from their fituation, could always be 

taken. Another ufeful improvement upon its prefent ftate, 

of fmall expence, and in fome degree connected with former, 
would be to erecl: a breaker on the rock called the Inch, 
which lies a little way without the harbour. It is obferved 
that, in whatever weather, there is no run within the har- 
bour until this rock is covered by the flowing tide : Therefore, 
were this breaker to be raifed as high as the tide flows, it is 
fuppofed that all run into the harbour would thereby be pre- 
vented. It does, uot appear that the ^expence of this breaker

Almoft 



of Fraferburgh. *S 

Almoft adjoining to the weft end of Fraferburgh, is the fall- 
ing villacre of Broadfea. Seven boats belong to it. Thefe 
boats are let to a tackfman. The nlhermen inhabit , good 
houfes covered with tyles : to build which, they receive an 
allowance from the proprietor. They are tenants at will, 
paying annually a fmall quit rent. 

A few yards weft of the Wine Toiver, (mentioned in the 
note, page 10), ftands the caftle of Kinnaird's head, built a- 
bout the year 1600, in the form ofa parallelogram, 39 feet by 
27, ftill entire, ftrong, and lately repaired. Being on an 
eminence, and four (lories high, it commands, an extenfive 
profped. On the top of this caftle, Government, n few years 
ago, ereaed a light-houfe, containing. 20 lamps with reflec- 
tors ; which, it is believed, will tend materially to the prefer- 
vation of the (hipping engaged in commerce upon this coaft, 
KinnairdVhead being generally the firft land made by (hips 
coming from the north fea to the eaft coaft of Scotland, and 
from the eaft fea to the Murray Firth, and to the weft of 
Scotland and Ireland by the Orkneys. It is alfo taken as a 
point of departure ; and the light is feen a great way off" from

(presbytery of deer, synod and county of

By the Rev. Mr. William Cumine.</head>


<p>
Name j Situation^ tsfe. 

ACCORDING to a current tradition, Rathen is derived 
from Ethernan, the, name of an old faint, who is faid 

to have refided in the parifh It is three miles diftant from 

Fraferburgh, extending upwards of two miles along the fea- 
coaft betwixt that town and Peterhead-, from thence it runs 
inland, in a fouth-weft diredion, to the extent of 7 miles : 
The breadth is two miles at an average. About a third part 
of Mormond-hill, (mentioned in the preceding account of 
Fraferburgh), is comprehended in the parifh ; this hill, its en- 
virons, and feveral patches of mofs, are good for little except 
affording fuel. The foil, through the reft of the parifh, is 
very various : There are fome deep rich fields ; others are 
light, and fandy but generally productive under good treat- 
ment ; and others gravelly and ftony, feveral parcels of which 
never have been broken up. The water of Rathen, or Philorth, 
dividing this parifh from Fraferburgh, drives feveral mills ^ 

and

and has feveral fields of good meadow on its banks. Abo* 
the hal of the fea ttore in the paritt is plain and fandy, the 
reft rocky, but low. Green links, and fome patches of bent, 
lie immediately above the whole courfe of this coaft ; which 
affords fome kelp, and abundance of fhell-fand and fea-ware 
for manure. On it ftand two fitting villages, employing 6 or 
7 boats each. The fifh caught here are the fame fpecies men- 
tioned in the account of Fraferburgh, and difpofed of in the 

fame manner The air is fharp, though the people in 

general cannot be faid to be unhealthy. Putrid and nervous 
fevers have of late cut off feveral perfons, moftly of middle 
•age. Formerly inflammatory fevers prevailed more. Not 50 
years age, the rheumatifm was little known; now, there are few 
grown perfons altogether free from it. Some of the people are 
reconciled to the praftice of inoculation ; fo the fmall-pox does 
not make fo much havock as ufual, except among the fitters, 
who will not adopt that preventive mode. 

Rent, Cultivation, feV The paritt belongs to ten diffe- 
rent proprietors, whereof two are refident. The valued rent 
is L. 3520 Scotch ; the real about L. 2000 fterling, paid part 
in money and part in viftual, with fome cuftoms, bondages, 
and perfonal fervices, though the three laft are gradually kf- 
fening here. The inhabitants in general, except the fitter- 
men, and a few old and decayed perfons, who refute in foli- 
tary cottages, are all, in fome degree, farmers. The feveral 
tradefmen, and others of different employments, poffefs each 
a field, which they generally improve. Upwards of three- 
fourths of the paritt, however, is occupied by real farmers, 
who of late, having adopted a better mode of culture than 
what prevailed formerly, have improved their poffeffions con- 
fiderably. Yet ftill much may be done. Near the coaft, the 
1 principal 



of Ratbeiu 17 

principal part of the crop confifts of barley, or, what is called, 
ware-bear *, peafe, and beans. Farther inland, oats and barley, 
potatoes, turnips, kail, and fown grafs, are alfo raifed, more or 
lefs on every pofleffion ; likewife fmall parcels of flax on fome, 
but no wheat. The barley raifed in this diftricl: is of three 
different qualities; true barley, weighing from 19 to 20 ft. 
the boll ; common country bear, or big, weighing from 
1 7 to 18 ft. and ware-bear, from 16 to 17 ft. all Amfterdam 
weight, and Aberdeen meafure. The oats raifed here are 
good, efpecially on the coaft, weighing, on well managed 
farms, 16 ft. Some brocked, but little, if any, fmall oats arc 
now raifed. Lime has been ufed here as manure, during the 
courfe of 80 years, though, for a long time,, very improperly j 
its application now being better underftood, it is attended with 

good . effects. There are feveral veins of limeftone in the 

parifh ; one is of a fuperior quality to any in this corner of the 
country : its produce is carried inland to a confiderable dif- 
tance for the purpofe of building. Sea ware, and, of late, 

{hell fand, are ufed as manure. Servant's wages are in^- 

creafed to about double what they were 30 years ago, and are 
every year augmenting ; as is the price of labour of every kind. 

The numbers of the cattle maintained in the parifh, 

in 1792, is as follows : 

Horfes 463. Black cattle 1248. Sheep 6o2» 

Church, Poor, &amp;c. — The parifh church is the only place 
where divine fervice is publicly performed in the parifh. Its 
fabric, the minifter's manfe and offices, are all in good repair. 
The minifter's ftipend is a chalder of ware-bear j another of

communion elements ; and L.4 ft. for firing} the mofs, whence 
the minifter ufed to be fupplied with peats, being lately ex- 
haufted. Befides the above, the minifter pofleffes about 6 
acres of ground, (glebe and grafs) ; which, together with the 
manfe and offices, would fet to no great account without pri- 
vilege to mofs. Lord Saltoun is patron. The fchoolmafter's 
falary is very trifling. 

The poor of the parifh are fupplied in their own houfes. 
Very few go a begging, and that only occasionally. The 
funds under the management of the church feffion, arifing 
from fome mortified money lent out, the weekly collections 
in the church, and fome other fmall emoluments accruing to 
the feffion, afford them about L. 30 fterling yearly. There are 
ufually from 30 to 40 on the roll, befides fome neceffitous per- 
fons that occafionally need fupply. The inhabitants in gene- 
ral are charitable ; and the poor are often privately affifted 
by their neighbours, efpecially by the families of diftinction, 
whofe benevolence, indeed, is not confined to their own neigh- 
bourhood. The parifh could, with eafe, fupport its own poor, 
but isharrafled with vagrants. The failure of crop 1782 was 
very diftreffing ; and the fucceeding one afforded little relief ; 
the poor people's money being then gone : Had not crop 1784 
proved uncommonly productive, great numbers would have 
been ruined. 

Population. During the laft 20 years, the inhabitants 

have increafed cohfiderably; It is faid, by fcarcity, owing to 
unfavourable feafons, during the 7 laft years of the preced- 
ing century, called here, the /'// years, they were greatly dimi- 
nifhed. In 1755, the number was 1527. The prefent num-

markable are three old cairns which were very large, till of late that great quan- 
tities of the ftones have been taken away from two of them. They (land near 
one another upon an extenfive plain ; and are thought to be monuments of 
the burials of fome eminent men. The remains of human bones were lately 
found in one of them. The tradition, which is all that can be learned of them, 
here, is, that the Danes landed on the eaft coaft, at a place called Cruden, a- 
bout fix miles fouthvvard from Peterhead ; that the inhabitants attacked and 
drove them from their mips ; whereupon, flying towards Moray, where a co~ 
lony of their countrymen were eftablifhed, the Scots came up with, fought and 
beat them on the plain where the cairns (land ; and that they contain the 
graves of fome chiefs that fell there. 

There are two old caftles in the parifh both in ruins, 'Cairnbuilg and Inver- 
allochie, which feem to be places of confiderable^ftrength, efpecially Cairnbuilg; 
the walls of which are almoft entire, and of prodigious thicknefs. It was the fa- 
mily feat of Lord Saltoun's predecefTors; and called Philorth, till fold by Sir A- 
lexander Fi-afer,An.l 61 3 , to Frafer of Durris, when'hs name was changed to Cairn-

they have in general increafed their little (locks : Yet unhap- 
pily, too many by a more expenfive mode of living and drefs, 
lately introduced, have hurt themfelves very much. Even fer- 
vants, both male and female, though their wages are almoft the 
double of what they were fome time ago, expend fo much on 
drefs, that they are in general poor. No natural wood grows 
here ; but the mofies abound with oaks of a large fize ; fome 
in fuch a ftate of prefervation as to be fit for many ufeful pur-

<p>Name, Situation, &amp;c. 

ACCORDING to Baxter *, Caerlaverock fignifies the caf- 
tle clofe upon the fea. The parifh is a kind of penin- 
fula, formed by the Solway Firth, the river Nith, and Lochar- 
water ; refembling a cornucopia, (a juft emblem of its fertili- 
ty) •, having its mouth towards Dumfries, into which it pours 
a confiderable part of its produce ; and the convex fide towards 
Nith and Solway. The middle and upper end of the parifh 
is high, with gently rifing hills, and compact ; it bends, 
and is lengthened to a point, eaftward, and this part is low 
and level. The higher ground is generally a light, dry, and 
tolerably fertile loam ; interfperfed, however, with many a- 
cres of wet, {hallow, ftony, moorifh foil, (producing nothing 
but heath and rufhes), lying for the moft part in the vallies ;

late been manufactured into flags, and exported to Dublin 

and Liverpool. In the Nith, excellent flounders and fal- 

mon are caught * by the farmers and cotters ; and either con- 
fumed in their families, or carried to Dumfries. In the 
Lochar, are found pikes, roaches, and eels, in abundance, 
likewife a few trouts : and, near its mouth, falmon and floun- 
ders are fometimes, but rarely, caught In the parilh are 

two harbours, Keltown and Glencaple. At the former, the 
tiderifes 15 feet; and at the latter, 12 feet, at the full and 
change of the moon. ThevefTels belonging to Nith, are from 
36 to 80 or 90 tons burden •, chiefly employed in bringing 
lime and coals from Cumberland ; and from Liverpool, fuch 
grocery goods as are confumed in the neighbourhood ; and 
in exporting potatoes and grain. Of lare, rum, fruit, and 
Port wine, have been imported ; and a confiderable quantity 
of timber is annually brought from Memel and Riga : but 
the veflels employed in thefe voyages are generally obliged to 
unload at the Carfe, 6 miles below Glencaple Key. 

Extent, Proprietors, Rent, f&amp;c — The parifh is 6 miles long, 
and no where more than two miles broad, containing about 4640 
Scotch acres ; whereof, 59 are wood, about 60 mofs, and 
the reft arable, with the exception of nearly 40 acres of mea- 
dow liable to be overflowed by Lochar ; and a ftill greater ex-

acres belonging to three different heritors, only one of whom 
refides. The old croft land is fet at one guinea per acre ; the

pafture and moor ground, of which little now remains, from 
is. 6d. to 7s. the marfh and meadow from 10s. to 12s. Leafes 
are commonly granted for 19 years, and no more. The real 
rent of the parifh is at prefent L. 215 1 : 8 : 9. This rent has 
been doubled fince 1776, and more than tripled fince 1756. 
Such is the rapid progrefsof improvement, that nearly is. 5d.

* Upon land that has never been ploughed before, the lime is not laid un- 
til it be firft broken by the plough and harrows ; but, if it has been tilled, be- 
fore, it is thought better to fpread it on the grafs furface ; and experience 
proves, that it is advantageous to allow the lime to lie a year on the ground, 
before ploughing it down. If it be ploughed down immediately, the farmer 
reaps no benefit from the lime for the firft crop.

The following rotation of crops is purfued with little varia- 
tion. The ground is broken up for oats, two crops of which 
are taken in fuccefTion. Then follows a green crop, general- 
ly potatoes ; feldom turnips, peate, or naked fallow. After 
this the ground is fown with clover and rye-grafs, and is then 
mown for the firft year, paftured for the two, and fometimes 
three following years : After which, it is again broken up to 
undergo the fame courfe of tillage. Where the foil is not fit 
for wheat or barley, two or three crops of oats are taken after 
the lime is laid on, and then the ground is laid out for pafture; 
in which ftate, it is allowed to lie {till, in order to fubdue rhe 
rufhes, heath, and mofs which foon grow up, and the farmer is 
again called upon to lime and plough it. The farms are ge- 
nerally fmall, from L. 40 to L. 70 per annum, of rent, and 
feveral pay much lefs ; two only, pay'above L.100 a year. In the 
parifh there are upwards of 90 carts, and about 70 ploughs, 
both of the Scotch and the Englifh form ; the latter is ufed in 
the low land, which is entirely free of ftones, and the former 
in the dry and ftony land. The horfes are all of the Scotch 
breed, and employed in agriculture only, A few young ones are 
reared annually, either forfale,or to fupplythe place of thofethat 
wear out in the fervice. The cows are moftly of the Galloway 
kind. Few of them, even when well fattened, will weigh more 
than 40 ft. The fheep are of the Englifh mugg, the Bakewell, 
the Scotch, or moorland kind. Part of the fwine are confumed in 
the parifh, and part killed and falted for the Englifh market. A 
confiderable number of young cattle reared in the jfarifh, are 
every year fold in the Dumfries market. All the wheat is car- 
ried thither, and part of the barley produced here ; part is 
exported to Whitehaven and Liverpool ; to which ports, to 
Dublin, and fometimes even to Briftol, the potatoes, after the 
very confiderable confumption of the parifli is fupplied, are alfo 
fent.

* If the fituation, circumftances, and manners of the inhabitants of Caer- 
laverock are confidered, it lhould feemthat a fourth part of the fum, allotted 
to the fupport of the poor, might be efficient for all the purpofes of real and 
ufeful charity. And, indeed, an attentive obferver will reckon it a matter of 
doubt, whether the greatnefs of the parifh funds be produce of moft good 
or evil. The moralift has fome caufe to complain, that it dries up the fources 
of private charity,and renders the poorer people lefs willing to affift their oldand 
needy relations. Thefe, they fcem fometimes difpofed to abandon to the care of 
the feffion, who cannot, by the fmall allowance they beftow, make up to them 
the want of that tender afliduity, which proves the cordial of age and poverty, 
and which natural affection alone can adminifter. 

The farmer with ftill greater reafon complains, that the idea of a plentiful 
fund eftablilhed for their fupport, fills the parifh, in fpite of every effort to 
prevent it, with the idle, infirm, and indolent ; and renders it difficult for him to 
obtain day-labourers. In fine, the poor themfelves are far from being con- 
tented with their refpedive proportions of the funds, which are, notwithftand- 
ing, diftributed with great impartiality. They are accuftomed to lean too much, 
to them, and to depend too little upon their own exertions : Nay, it is faid, 
that a querulous habit is acquired, and even infirmity feigned, in order to ex-, 
cite compaffion, and to obtain a more liberal fhare of charity. 

In the oppofite fcale of good, thefe effeds of the funds are to be thrown : 
Firft, The fupport of convenient fchoojs ; Second, That no diftrefs arifing 
from poverty occurs, which obtains not a prompt relief, without any expence 
to the inhabitants of the parifh. But, though none of the poor of Caerlaver 
rxck are under the neceffity of begging from houfe to houfe, the parifh is as 
much as any other in this quarter, peftered with vagrants, and as liberal to 
.them.

Mifcellaneous Obfervatiom*. — The inhabitants of Caerlaverock 
are in general plain, horjeft, fober, induftrious, and charitable. 
From their vicinity to Dumfries and the fhore, they are more 
polifhed and liberal than fome of their inland neighbours. 
The farmers, though none of them rich, are yet, in general, 
in comfortable circumftances. This they owe to their own 
frugality, {kill, and induftry j but, in fome meafure, alfo to the 
advantages of being near a confiderable market town ; the vi- 
cinity of two fea-ports ; and the circumftances of their bor- 
dering upon Lochar mofs, which fupplies them with abun- 
dance of fuel ; though, at the fame time, from the great 
wafte of time and labour, fo precious to the hufbandman,

are fcarcely to be traced the veftiges of a moated triangular caftle ; probably

Carhuntorlgum of Ptolemy. A little to the north-eaft of thefe remains, arc 
to be feen the ftill more venerable ruins of another and more modern caftle, of 
fimilar (hape, but much larger dimenfions; long the principal refidence of the 
noble family of Maxwell; which has been fo well defcribed by Grofe and Pen- 
nant, as to render any particulars here unneceflary. Not far weft of this caftle 
rifes the hill Wardlaw ; on the top of which, are yet vifible, the veftiges of a 
Roman incampment, conjeOured to be the Vxeh of Ptolomy. The hill after, 
wards ferved as a watch-tower to the caftle ; for which purpofe it was well fit- 
ted, commanding a very extenfive profpect in almoft every direftion On 

the borders of this parifh is a mount, called the Bailey Know, one of thefe en- 
campments called moats ; near which, fome iron hoops and chains were found. 

A. little below Glencaple Key, clofe by the fhore, was a cell or a chapel, 

dedicated to St Columba ; near this is a well, of which no perfon was permit-

Scotland, againft the partial and abfurd duty which is laid up- 
on coals imported into this part of the kingdom. To caft,dry,and 
cart home all the peats confumed in the parifh, would occupy 
for one day 4762 perfons, together with 1382 horfes and 
carts, whofe labour , ought to be rated at L. 376. A few 
coals alfo are ufed by thofe that are at a diftance from the 

mofs. Another great, though precarious advantage, is, 

that the farmers of this parifh, in general, hold their farms 
of a landlord, whofe wife and good maxims, in the ma 
nagement of his eftate, have hitherto been, not to over- 
rate his land, nor to remove his old tenants, fo long as they 
are difpofed to keep their farms, whilft they continue to be in- 
duftrious, and while there is even a probability that they 
(hall be able to pay their rent. The leafes on the Nithf- 
dale eftate are always offered again to the old tenant, and 
renewed at leaft two years before their expiration : a practice 
well Worthy the regard of all thofe landholders, who do not 
mean, by encouraging a competition of bidders, to ftir up en- 
vy, and to raife their land above its juft value. 

The farmers of this parifh, and indeed, generally fpeak-

ground is black, light, {hallow, and fpungy ; incapable of re- 
filling violent impreihons either of heat or cold ; not reten- 
tive of moifture in the droughts of fummer, and apt to eject 

the roots of tender plants in the intenfe frofts of winter.

found in the Don, which is not navigable. There are alfo 6 
rivulets abounding with fmall trouts and eel ; feveral chaly-

molt excellent quality in the parifh. 

Produce, Rent y &amp;c. — The principal vegetable productions 
^re oats, barley, fown grafTes, turnips, and potatoes. About 
two thirds of the arable ground are annually cropped with 
oats and barley ; and large quantities of grafs and turnips are

bed of this river, for the fpace of 3 miles below the church of Dyce, was found 
entirely empty ; and was patted and repafTed by feveral perfons who gathered 
the fifh that lay fprawling in the bottom. No perfon cbferved the commence- 
ment of this uncommon phenomenon. About half an hour after its difcovery, 
the water came down the channel again in a full. body. This was occafioned 
probably by a chafm formed by fomc internal commotion of the earth, which

of the latter crop, for feeding their cattle, that even the fmah- 
left tenants have a portion of their ground in turnips. Pota-* 
toes have likewife been employed of late for the fame purpofe. 
A few peafe and a fmall quantity of flax are raifed, Seed- 
time commences about the middle of March, and harveft ge- 
nerally begins the 6th of September. Upwards of a third- 
part of the parifh remains uncultivated, producing little elfe 
except heath. That it is fufceptible of improvement, the ad- 11 
jacent farms, which 20 or 30 years ago were in the fame con- 
dition, fufficiently evince, About 200 acres are covered 
with plantations ; and there is a nurfery of foreft timber and 
fruit trees upon the lands of Auchmull. The foil is found very 
well adapted to the raiting of feedlings ; and the ground never 
having been dunged, the plants are hardy, and thrive re- 
markably in England and the fouthern parts of Scotland, from 
whence there is a large demand. The parifh cannot be faid 
to fupply itfelf with provifions : for, though it exports a conu-» 
derable quantity of barley to the breweries about Aberdeen, and 
a great deal of milk, butter, and eggs, is daily carried from 
it to that city for fale, yet fo numerous are the labourers, 
mechanics, and manufacturers, whofe fuftenance comes en, 
tirely from Aberdeen, that the import of meal alone more 
than overbalances exports of every kind. There are 2 1 heritors, 
3 of whom conftantly refide. About 40 years ago, the pa- 
rifh contained 50 plough-gates of land, each occupied by one 
tenant, and yielding about L. 1 o of yearly rent. They are now 
fubdivided into at leaft four times as many fmaller farms ; the 
value of each of which, at an average, may be calculated af 
L. 8 per annum. There are likewife 14 large farms in the 
parifh, moft of which are in the natural poflefuori of the pro- 
prietors, The greater part of thefe has, within a few years, 
been gained from the furrounding muirs ; and each of them 
would, if let, now yield a rent of from L. 60 to L. 100,

The valued rent of the country part of the parifh, (for part, 
belonging to, or held of the town of Aberdeen, has no valua- 
tion), is L. 13 1 3 : 6 : 8 Scotch. A kind of valuation, fuppof- 
ed to have been the real rent of the parifh, amounting to 
L. 4653 : 6 : 8 Scotch, was given in to the prefbytery of A- 
berdeen by the heritors, in 1679. The mean rent of land is 
about 15s per acre ; but, it muft be obferved, that every farm 
has a proportionable quantity of pafturage and mofs annexed 
to it, the benefits of which, the tenant enjoys without any ad- 
ditional expence. Some of the beft land is let at L, 2 per acre. 
The large farms are all inclofed with {tone fences : the Eng- 
lifh plough is ufed on them, and is drawn by 2 or 4 horfes. 
The principal manure is (hell lime, brought from Aberdeen ; 
from whence, likewife, confiderable quantities of ftreet dung 
are procured. Improvements upon one farm, which produ- 
ces great crops, have been made by means of foap afhes, and 
other manure of a faponaceous nature. The foil alfo requires 
to be frequently laid down in grafs, that it may acquire a con- 
fiftency or body. This, however, proves no unprofitable ma- 
nagement, as the grafs fields are rented by butchers at a very 
high price. The leffer farmers ftill employ the Scotch plough, 
to which they frequently yoke oxen and horfes together. 
Their infield, which is feldom allowed to remain in grafs, is di- 
vided into three portions, which alternately receive the ma- 
nure : barley is always fown in that part which is dunged, 
and the other two are cropped with oats. There are 88 
ploughs in the parifh ; of which, 49 are drawn by horfes, 7 
by oxen, and the reft by both. The number of carts is 139 *.

whence are exported, annually, upwards of 45,000 fquare feet 
of litter ftones, and fome years above 15,000 tons of caufe-

it is fuppofed, between 3,000 and 4,000 fquare feet of litter 
ftones, and fome thoufands of the fmaller ones, are yearly 
exported. All the quarries afford a very good kind of granite, 
exceedingly durable, and capable of a fine polifh. About 50 
men are employed in the ftone trade, partly common labour-

is a paper mill, containing two vats, and employing 16 hands; 
alfo a mill for teafing, carding, and roving wool, and for 
waulking cloths. In the parifh are 5 mills for grinding grain.

Name. 

'"flTIE original name of this parifh Was Fetkill ; but when 
the family of Leflie, Earls of Rothes, became the 
principal proprietors, they gave their own name to their 
pofleflions here, and the whole diftri£t came at laft to be 
known by the fame appellation^ 

Surface, Soil, Rent, tsV. — The parifh is in general fiat, but 
rifes gently from the banks of the river Leven, which forms 
the fouchern boundary. It is almoft wholly an arable diftrict. 

The foil is in general good The real rent is not known. 

The valued rent is L. 4561 Scotch.— The parks of Leflie are 
let annually by auction, and generally taken by the town's 
people of Leflie, who pay, at an average, from L. 1 : 15 to 
L. 2 per acre. As they are paftured by milch cows, and as

about L. 2 is paid for a cow's grafs, it is neceflary to keep a 9 
good cows aspoflible; and, indeed, more good ones are tobefeen 
in Leflie, than perhaps in any town of its fize. They commonly 
bring from L. 7 to L. 10, and are all of the Fife breed. Some 
Dutch cows were tried, and fome of the Irifh and Lancafhire 
breed ; but they did not anfwer, as the firft were expenfive to 
keep up in winter, and the laft did not yield much milk. Almoft 
all the lands of the parifli have been cultivated; and by far the 
greatefl part of them are either under crops of grain, potatoes, 
turnips, and flax, or in fown grafs. The farmers now deal 
more in rearing cattle, and in general plough lefs ground, 
but, at the fame time, raife more corn than formerly. While the 
farms were uninclofed, and little or no fown grafs raifed, the 
cattle gathered a miferable fubfiftence on bare leys ; which, 
after refting feveral years, were broken up, and cropt, year after 
year, till they fcarce produced double the feed. The land is 
now plowed by one man commonly with a pair of horfes, 
inftead of four oxen with two horfes and a lad to drive them, 
as was formerly the cafe *.

* Prices of Labour and Provifions. — In 1759, a day labourer's wages were 
8d. without victuals. If he was employed during the winter and fummer, he 
got only 6d. The yearly wages of a man fervant were then from L. a : 10, 
to L. 3, fter. and thofe of a maid fervant, from L. I : io, to L. 2. But a 
fumcient man fervant cannot now be got under L. 5 : 10 or L. 6, nor a 
maid fervant under L. a : 10 or L 3, a year. A common labourer now 
gets is. a day. In 1759, beef could have been bought, between Michael- 
mas and Martinmas, at as 8d. per (tone ; it is now 5s 46. The price of 
fowls and eggs is doubled. A good fowl is is, and a dozen of eggs, 4d. — 
Butter was 5d. now it is 8d. a pound. Milk was id. a pint, now it is ad.

moft numerous fet of handicraftfmen, no other clafs of me- 
chanics bearing any proportion to them. Their principal em- 
ployment is weaving plain linen and cotton checks, by which 
moft of them can earn from I4d. to i8d. or 2od. a day. The. 
chief employment of the women is fpinning lint and tow. 
About 30 years ago, when they uniyerfally fpun with one 
hand, a hefp or flip, which is the fourth part of a fpindle, 
was thought a fufficient day's work for a woman ; and miftref- 
fes required no more of their maid-fervants when they fat the 
whole day at the wheel. After they had fpun their hefp, the 
reft of the time was their own. Before 1770, a wheel for fpin- 
ning with both hands was unknown in the parifh, now almoft 
none elfe are to be feen it. The manufacturers ufed to give 
only lod. for fpinning a fpindle of yarn, fo that, at that rate, 
a woman earned only i5d. a week ; but now the manufactur- 
ers pay is. for fpinning a fpindle, and a woman can fpin 2i 
fpindles a week, which makes 2s. 6d. 

Stipend. — —The ftipend confifts of 42 bolls of oat-meal, 8 
Dutch ftones to the boll ; 22 bolls of barley, Linlithgow 
meafure ; and L. 50 fterling in money. The manfe was 
built in 1687, and repaired in 1789. The glebe is very in- 
different. It is furprifmg to fee fome minifters eftimating 
their glebes, and adding their value to the livings ; for there 
is fcarcely a minifter who would not give his glebe to any 
man that would drive his fuel, furnifh his family with milk, 
and a horfe to ride on when he is neceffarily called from home: 
and, if the minifter hath any tolerable fkill in arithmetic, he 
might give the man, who would fupply him with the above 
conveniencies, 5 guineas a year along with glebe ; for in that 
cafe he would fave the expence of a man fervant, which, as 
times go, is at lead L. 12 or L. 14, and the rifque of lofmg a

J oor, 



The following obfervations on the ftate of the clergy, tranfmitted by Mr 
Wilhs, tho' not immediately within the fcope of this work, yet are here in- 
ferted, on account of their connexion with the f.tuation of fo rcfpeftable 
and fo ufeful a part of the community. 

Patriots, and friends to mankind would wifh to know how to ameliorate the 
C ondit.on of every ufeful clafs of men in the kingdom. With regard to the peo- 
ple at large, their condition and circumftances are every day becoming more 
comfortable and afluent , while thofe of the clergy are every day declining, 
verging to poverty, and its ufual concomitant, contempt. 
Nil habet infelix pauperies durius in fe, 
Quam quod ridiculos homines facit." 
We all eafily find out ways and means for the relief of the diftrcfled when 
-" W ° UrfelveS are Wdl and at ™ eafe. Some will fay, that the clergy' mould 
return to that plain and homely fare and clothing, which their predeceflors 
nfed at the beginning of the century. Not to mention other anfwers to this 
advice, even to live in that manner now, would coft double of what it did then. 
The boys in Heriot's Hofpital live upon the fame kind of food, and have the 
fame kind of cloths, as they had an hundred years ago; and yet, Ifuppofe, 
it will be found, that the expence of their maintenance and clothing is now 
double of what it was then. Others will fay, that the clergy Ihould take 
farms; not confidering how difficult they are to be got. Befides, where one 
minifter will gain by farming, nineteen in twenty, or rather 99 in 100, would 
probably lofe by it ; as they cannot always be at the head of their labouring 
fervants ; nor are they, in any way, a match for horfe-cowpers, cow-cowpers, 
brewers, and butchers, the people that farmers have to deal with. Gentle- 
men farmers are on the fame footing as a clergyman would be ; and fure I am, 
that there are not many inftances of their meeting with much fuccefs. 

There are two difficulties in the way of applying for an augmentation of 
ftipends. The certain and almoft unlimited expence of fuchan application, (if 
the heritors vigoroufly oppofe the meafure, as they often have done,) and the 
abfolute uncertainty of obtaining it, as the courts of law are verted with arbir 
trary powers to give or to refufe. « Arbitria judicum pro legibus funt." If it

gmount, on an average of the laft 10 years, to L. 18 per an- 
num ; 

valuable in this century than in the laft ? I Aippofe if you will pitch upon any 
20 years of the laft century, and compare them with the 20 correfponding 
years in this, you will find the difference next to nothing ; for befides, that 
from the improvements in agriculture, by which grain is raifed in greater 
quantities, and has become an article of commerce, it neither rifes fo high, nor 
falls fo low as formerly. 

There feems to be but one way, in which the condition of the clergy can be 
ameliorated, with the leaft lofs to the public at large, and to the feweft indi- 
viduals. In Scotland, the tithes of feveral parifties, which belonged to religi- 
ous houfes are veiled in the Crown, and are let in kafe for two or three lives ; 
for which the tenant is bound to pay a certain annual fum to the Exchequer. 
At the firft eftablilhment of the Prefbyterian form of church government 
here, the biftiops rents alfo were vefted in the Crown, I have no doubt, from a 
counter-revolution being not only poffible but probable ; and which actual!/ 
took place. Again, at the Revolution, thefe were in like manner vefted ia 
the Crown, and for the fame reafon : for if King William had been as wo'i 
affured of the fupport of the Epifcopal clergy, as he was of the Prelbyterian, 
the form of church government had not been altered at that time. So that 
thefe unalienated tithes and biftiops rents are the patrimony of the church, and 
feem to have been vefted in the crown as a depofit; for they were never forfeited 
by rebellion or otherwife ; and were lodged there, as a provifion againft an event, 
which now, by the treaty of union, and the king's coronation oath, never can 
take place. It is greatly to the honour of the legillature, that it has reftored 
their family eftates to men whofe anceftors had forfeited them by rebellion •, 
and hence, I mould think it very unhandfome, upon a proper application, to 
refufe to their very beft and firmed friends that part of their patrimony, from 
which they are excluded on account of no rebellion or forfeiture whatever, 
Suppofe this reftored, who would fuffer any lofs ? As to the lofs to the Exche- 
quer, what a trifle is it to an empire which has fuch revenues as ours ? As to 
the lofs to the collectors, it would be a very ferious one, and a mighty hard- 
fhip indeed, to extinguifh no lefs than about a dozen of finecure places. With 
regard to the tackfmen, whofe tacks are good for their term of years, would it 
make any difference to them, to pay the tack-duty to the church, in place of 
paying it to the exchequer ? 

I (hall mention but one confequence, if the incomes of the clergy be not a- 

meliorated.

meliorated, the decline of learning will follow. This muft infallibly be the cafe 
in any date, where there is not a rank which requires a confiderable degree of 
learning, where there is not room for a confiderable number of the learned to be 
employed in it, and where that employment does not entitle them to a decent 
degree both of profit and of refpeft. Suppofe the flipends of Scotland to fall as 
much in their value for half a century to come, as for half a century part, how 
few clergymen, who are enabled to give their fons fuch an expenfive educati- 
on, as a minifter fhould have, would breed them to a profeffion where they 
cannot gain fo comfortable a fubfiftence as many mechanics can earn ? With 
what kind of young men would gentlemen be fupplied as tutors in their fami- 
lies, and who are now fowell fupplied, by preachers and ftudents in divinity? 
Though a Dionyfius might make it worth the while of a Pythagoras, to come 
from Greece to Syracufe, to inftrucl himfelf and his courtiers, I fufpecT:, that 
when Scottifh lairds muft fend to Oxford and Cambridge for tutors to their 
children, few will be fent for, and fewer come to a country, where they can 
look for no farther preferment. England, I think, will continue to be the 
feat of learning ; till fuch time as the livings of the dignified clergy of the 
church there, fhall be reduced to as low an ebb, as at prefent are the livings 
of the dignified clergy in France, 

I have ever been of opinion, that the downfall of the church will bury learn- 
ing in its ruins ; and this feems to be warranted by the hiftory of all nations. 
That body of men, who are now fneeringly called Priefts, their office Prieft- 
hood, and their employment, Prieftcraft, and which I fhall call, the Clerical 
order eftablifhed by law, have been in all ages and nations of the world, the 
repofitories of learning. In our own country, at the firft appointment of the 
Court of Seffion, 'there was fuch a penury of the learned laity, that they were 
obliged to the church for one half of the judges. Wherever the clerical order 
has been creditable and refne&amp;able, light and learning have fhone forth. 
Whence proceeded the firft birth of learning, but from the priefts of Egypt ? 
Whither did the Grecian fages travel but into Egypt and the Eaft ? Were not 
the Brahmins, the Gentoo clergy, who were, and ftill are, of high efteem, 
thofe whom Pythagoras wifhed, and travelled to learn from .' Were there not at 
Rome a Caius Julius Ca:far Pontifex Maximus, and a Marcus Tullius Cicero 
at the head of the college of Augurs ? Was ever virtue, and piety, and learn- 
ing more nobly fupported than in the writings of the divines of the church of 
„ England ?

England ? I have not heard, indeed, whether the Hottentots, the Cherokees, 
the Chictaws, the Efquimaux, &amp;c. ever had any clergy ; and as little have I 
heard of the learned productions of thofe ornaments of human nature. 

Upon the whole, I cannot help thinking, it would be bad policy in any 
ftate, to fuffer a body of men, who, firft and laft, have been of no fmall ufe 
to the interefts of learning and of virtue* to languifh in poverty, and dwindle 
into contempt. No doubt, the art of printing, and the eftablilhment of uni- 
verfities, have contributed, as well as the clergy, to the increafe, and to 
the diffufion of knowledge ; but the clergy diffufe knowledge, and the beft 
kind of knowledge, to all men, high and low, to the cobler as well as to the 
king. While the fchools of the philofophers of old, thought it a profanation 
to enlighten the vulgar, the fifhermen of Galilee, and their fucceflbrs, have 
initiated the vulgar in the moft fublime doctrines, and the pureft morality ; 
have fuggefted to them the moft noble confolations, and have drawn them 
forth to action, by the moft exalted hopes. And who are the men, who pro- 
vide fociety (I do not fay with the neceflaries and comforts of life only), but 
with all its elegancies, with all its fuperfluities, with all its luxuries ? Who 
but the vulgar ? They bear all its burdens, and I am forry to fay, fuffer all its 
hardlhips. And can juftice or gratitude, can humanity and compaflion, leave 
them to drudge in this world, like beafts of burden, cut them off from all confo- 
lation here, and leave themdeftitute of all rational hopes of enjoying a better 
condition hereafter .'That, however, muft be the cafe, if they are deprived alto- 
gether of the inftruftions of their beft friends, and thrown into the hands q£ 
perfons who may be as ignorant as themfelves.

and beg or ftarve the reft of the month *. No diftinaion be- 
tween the poor of the diffenters, and the poor of the Eftablifh- 
ed Church is allowed. 

For 17 years preceding 1781, the colleaions, on an average, 
were L. 15:10; the hire of the mortcloths amounted to 
L. 3 : 5 ; and the fums diftributed among the poor, to about 
I-. 30 annually. 

Since 1759, no perfon in this parifh hath perifhed by hun- 
ger, nakednefs, or want of lodging ; nor have any taken to 
begging. During this period, it mult be mentioned, that 
the heritors of the parifh have not given one farthing to the 
poor, offerings at the church door excepted; and even thefe came 
only from one family, all the other proprietors being non-refi- 
dents f . 

Population. 

* The poor, fays Mr Willis, fhould be treated like young birds, give them 
little at a time, but often. 

f Many plans for the fupport of the poor have been projected : this only 
feems certain, that wherever poors rates have been adopted.they have generally 
been found very expenfive. The philofophefs of the prefent day, inftead of 
thinking, " whatever is, is right," feem to think, " whatever is, is wrong." 
Many new plans have been propofed, and no one agreeing with another, 
I have always thought, that it is better to begin with amending an old plan, that 
has proved not to be very bad, that to take all at once a new one, however 
finely fpun. I will venture to fay, with refpect to our old plan, that, of all the 
public funds of Europe, none are managed at fo little expence to the fund it« 
fclf, none fo frugally, none fo impartially, and none laid out more to the pur- 
pofe for which they were raifed, than the poors funds under the care of the 
kirk-feflions of Scotland. Never, perhaps, will Scotland find a more proper 
jury to determine the objects of public charity, nor the quantum neceflary for 
their fupply. Two amendments may be fuggefted : The firft is, to protect 
thefe funds againft the burden of natural children being brought upon them, 
which could be done by altering the prefent law, and making the oath of the 
woman father all baftards, as is the practice in England. The oath of that

party fliould certainly be preferred who hath the lead temptation to perjury. 
The woman in all ordinary cafes of this kind has none : the man has a dou- 
ble temptation to perjury ; for firft, he gets clear of the cenfure of the church, 
and next, which to him is a matter of greater confequence, he frees himfclf 
of the expence of the maintenance of the child. 

In the next place, it were to be wimed, that the gentlemen in Scotland, be- 
fore it be too late, would voluntarily give lefs or more for fupporting the kirk- 
fe/fions, and enabling them to maintain the poor ; for mould kirk-feflions give 
up their laborious and painful talk, the gentry, who now give next to no- 
thing, if they once came to be taxed by law for the maintenance of the poor, 
will find their rate operate pretty much in the fame way as an heritable bond 
of the fame extent, upon their lands. If every heritor, refident, and non-re- 
fidcnt, were to give in as much to the kirk-feffion, as it may reafonably be 
fuppofed, his tenants and their families in that parifh give, which may be 2d. 
or 3d. each Sunday, even that fmall help would keep the poor from begging or 
ftarving. Suppofe the heritor has fix tenants, it certainly would not be an 
excefs of generofity to give at the rate of a milling each Sunday for the fupport 
of the poor. The expence of maintaining the poor in England is well known.

In London, in the parifh of St. Martins in the Fields, the poor's rates, at is 
the pound upon the houfe rents, amounts to L. 10,000 per ann. and many 
paiifhcs in London pay more than is. the pound. Many particular inftances 
might be mentioned. At Alnwick it is faid, the poor's rates amount to 
L. 600 per ann. while the parifh of Alnwick is not more populous than fome 
parifhes in this neighbourhood, which have not L. 50 to fupport the poor. 
Yet very many of the gentry of Scotland will contribute almoft nothing, which 
may render a compulfary law at laft neceflary. Is it not a fliame, that fo ma- 
ny gentlemen (befides never entering a church-door) never give a milling from 
one end of the year to the other towards the fupport of the poor ? When the 
heart of an heritor is indeed foftened, and his hand opened, he may give once 
or twice in his life fome carts of coals or bolls of meal to the poor ; but it is 
to them no more than a leaf! at the time, and is foon done ; whereas half the 
fum delivered to the kirk-felfion, and given out by them in millings and fix- 
penecs would be of much greater fervice to the poor, who, as I have faid above, 
can bear no wealth. Upon the whole, the proper way to maintain the poor, 
is to give them what is neceflary to preferve them from ftarving, but not fo 
much as to damp their induflry, or encourage idlonefs; and even that little, 
they ought to receive, not as a right, but purely ,as charity; and I am per- 
fuaded, that all thele purpofes have been in general ferved by the manage*

Since'^Sj, the population has not materially altered. 

The great difproportion between the males and females m 
the town, and the difference in the country part of the parifh, 
will appear ftrange, but may thus be accounted for i In the 
town, the number of maid-fervants is greater than that of 
men-fervants, and the reverfe, in the country. Another rea- 
fon may be, that the farmers in the neighbourhood purchafe 
houfes in Leilie for their wives to inhabit, after their death, 
and to which they come with their unmarried daughters. Be- 
fides, in the country part of the parifh, the farmers have no 
more dwelling-houfes than are fufficient for themfelves and 
their fervants : when, therefore, a cottager dies, his cottage 
muft be let to another man to carry on the work of the farm, 
and the widow of the former, in that cafe, unlefs (he hath 
a fon to fupplyhis father's place, or a married daughter to 
whom flie might go to live with, rents a houfe in Leilie, that 
fhe may get coals driven for hire, and fuch other things to 
buy as are neceflary for her fubfiftence : and, befnles all 
thefe, fome old women get houfes in Leilie that they be near 
the church and the meeting-houfcs, of which there are two 
in town, one of the feci of Seceders, called Burghers, and 

— m. 

the other Antiburghers. The town is choakfull of people, 
and has neither an empty nor ruinous houfe in it. 

The increafe of inhabitants in the country part of the parifh, 
from 1759 to 1785, is probably occafioned by the eftablifh- 
ment of two bleach fields 5 for the farmers in general keep

fewer fervants than formerly, owing to a greater proportion 
of their farms being inclofed, and laid down with fown grafs, 
than heretofore. 

From 1780 to 1789, both inclufwe, 321 baptifms are en- 
tered in the regifter, whereof 168 were males, and 153 fe- 
males; 231 were baptifed by the eftablifhed minifter, and 
90 by Seceders. This, however, is no proper way of judg- 
ing of the real number of births, as the regifter of baptifms 
is kept both inaccurately and irregularly, fince 1732, when 
the Seceffion began. Some poor people, to fave the trifling ex- 
pence of lod. omit to regifter the names of their children; 
and the Seceders, fome through poverty and others out of 
fuperftition, do not regifter theirs. Some of the latter car- 
ry their fuperftition fo far as to pay the dues, and yet forbid 
the regiftration. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations*. The river Leven, which fe- 

parates 

* Antiquities. In the parifh is the old caftle of Strathendrie, which for- 
merly belonged to a family of the fame name, of no fmall note in Fife. A 
battle has, probably, been fought near it, as 4 large ftones, fimilar to thofe 
ufually fet up at the graves of perfons of renown, who had fallen in batr 1 -, 
would feem to indicate. Near thefe ftones flood a round hillock, called the 
Gallant Know ; which, being fuppofed to confift only of gravel, was made ufe 
of a few years ago to repair the roads : Eut in the center of it was found a 
piece of pavement, furrounded with large ftones, containing fome bones, and 
two fpear heads of copper, the one like the head of an officer's fpontoon, and 
the other, in the upper part, like a mafon's chifel. A ftone coffin and urn 
were found near the Gallant Know, befide one of the 4 ftones, about 1760. 
The old houfe of Pitcairn, which belonged to the well known Dr Pitcairn, 
is in this parifh, but now in a ruinous (late. Near it ftood a tumulus, in the 
center of which, about 1770, was found a ftone cheft, full of human bones, 
(in particular feveral entire jaw bones), (landing eaft and weft. At the eaft end 
were found two urns of bluifh clay, full of bones evidently calcined, and white 
as chalk. 



parates this parifh from that of Kinglaffie, abounds with 
trout ; and, about Michaelmas, great numbers of eels are 
taken in their paflage from Lochleven to the fea. On 
this account the lands of Strathendrie in this parifh, were, 
before the Reformation, fubjeft to an annual tax of fome thou- 
fands of eels to the abbey of Inchcolm. 

There are in the parifh quarries of whin-ftone, but very 
hard, and expenfive to win i alfo fome coal mines and lime- 
works. 

The parochial fchoolmafter, befides a houfe, has an annual 
falary of L. 5:11: if- Tlae Scholars, at an average through- 
out the whole year, are 80 in number. The fees of teaching 
are very low. 

There are 6 houfes where ale is fold ; but not one perfon 
or family fupported by the profits of a pubiic-houfe, all having 
fome other employment, 

Leflie-houfe, a magnificent feat, built by the Duke of 
Rothes, round a court like the abbey of Holyroodhoufe, with 
a gallery three feet longer than that in the abbey, hung on 
one fide with portraits of the connections of the Rothes fami- 
ly, and on the other fide with thofe of contemporaries and 
friends of the Duke, was burnt to the ground on the 28th 
December 1763. The fore-fide of the fquare was repaired 
by the late Earl of Rothes, in 17^7. 

Charafier of the People, and their Manner of Living. 

There is not, in Britain, a parifh of the fame extent, in which 
the people are more fober, honeft, and induftrious, nor among 
whom there have been fewer grofs crimes committed, than 
that of Leilie. Their manner of living is greatly altered : a 
remarkable inftance of which is, that for feveral years after 
1760, the prefent incumbent got all his wheaten bread from 
Edinburgh, and afterwards from Dyfart, rolls only being bak- 
3 ed

ed at Leflie ; whereas now there are 3 bakers in this town alone. 
Their clothing and furniture are alfo much better than former- 
ly. In the church of Leflie no perfon is ever feen in rags. 
The young men wear coats of Englifli cloth, fancy vefts, &amp;c. 
and the young women, printed and white cottons, filk cloaks 
and bonnets, &amp;c. The drefs of the maid-fervants makes no 
inconfiderable addition to the expence of a family in the arti- 
cle of wafhing. Their furniture alfo is much better. About 
30 years ago, when the prefent incumbent was fettled, there 
was not 6 clocks in the parifli, and now there is not a houfe 
in Leflie where there is not either a clock or watch.

are »od. a day. Beft male farm-fervants draw from L.5 to 
L. 6 per annum, the fecond fort from L. 3 to L. 5 i and beft 
female farm fervants from L.2 to L. 3. 600 women are em- 
ployed in fpinning of lint, and knitting of woolen (lockings % 
at which they earn from zs. to zs. 6d. per week. The price 
of all forts of provifions is double of what it was 40 years ago. 

The fuel commonly ufed is peat, turf, arid wood : the 

former, which is found in the parifh, cofts about is. per cart 
load when carried about 2 miles j the turf 6d. per load. The 
people in general are economical enough •, nothing could 
contribute more to meliorate their condition than the en- 
couragement of induftry. There are about 500 a- 

cres planted with wood, in a thriving way : on one eftate a- 
lone about 300 acres are planted.— Some free-ftone is carried 
fo far as Aberdeen, 20 miles diftant.

Name, Extent, &amp;c. 
TyrlDDLEBIE confifts of three parifties, Middlebie,- Pen- 
nerfaughs, and Carruthers, now united into one. In 
the Saxon language, Bie or Bee, it is faid, fignifies a ftation ; 
and the addition, Middle, has been given to this place from 
the circumftance of being the middle ftation between Nether- 
bie in Cumberland, and Overbie, or Upperbie, in Eflcdale- 
muir; at both which places, as well as at Middlebie, are 
plain veftiges of a Roman work.- — This diftri£t is 9 miles 
in length, and /\\ in breadth, though of a very irregular form, 
interfered in fome places by the neighbouring parifhes. 
The furface is flat, with gently rifing hills interfperfed. The 
foil is very various; moftly ftrong, deep, and wet, upon a 
cold tilly bed, but fertile upon the whole. The air is general- 
ly moift : After a long courfe of rainy weather, putrid fevers 
prevail much. 



Natural 



of Middlebie, 59 

Natural Produfiions, fcV.— The parifh abounds with free- 
ftone of a reddifh colour, and with limeftone, which is ufed 
both in building and for manure. About 30,000 Carlifle 
bulhels (each equal to 3 Winchefter's) are annually fold 
from the limeftone quarries, at I id. the bufhel when drawji 
from the kiln. Many acres are employed in raifing oats, bar- 
ley, potatoes, turnips, rye, wheat, and flax. Oats are the 
molt common crop. Turnips, rye, and wheat, are far from being 
general. The parifh fupplies itfelf with provifions, and ex- 
ports a confiderable quantity of oats, barley, and bacon — 
Great numbers of cattle, (which are generally very handfome, 
and without horns,) are annually bought by drovers, and car- 
ried into England. It is a common practice, among the farm- 
ers, to buy young fheep in Auguft, and difpofe of them the 
following fpring. The fheep are of the long Englilh kind, 
with white legs and faces. Harveft generally begins about 
the 1 ft of September, and is not concluded till November. 
The rent of the beft arable land is about 20s. the acre ; inferior 
land lets at 8s. 9s. or 10s. The general fize of farms feems 
to be 100 acres, and the average rent about L. 50 or L. 60. 
Property is not often changing; but when it does, the land fells 
at from 20 to 25 years purchafe *.

* The prefent price of butcher meat, butter, cheefe, and grain, is much the 
fame as in the Edinburgh market, and in the three Lothians. A goofe fells at 
2s 6d. or 3s. a duck at 8d. a hen at 7d. or 8d. So late as 1760, oatmeal, which

to L. 10 p tl arm. end female fervants receive half of thefe fums. This high 
rate is to be attributed to the vicinity of England, where the wages of fervants 
are ftill higher than here.

lifts of a manfe, a glebe of 12 acres, 5 chalders of vi£lua!, 
L. 66:13:4 in money, and L. 5 for communion elements, 
fo that it is altogether worth L. 150 per annum. The Duke of 
Queenfberry is patron. The amount of the collections at the 
church- door, fines, &amp;c. is about L. 1 7 ; which, added to L. 5, 
the intereft of a legacy, makes the whole annual income of 

the poor L 22. There has been no fchoolhere for 40 years 

paft ; but the legal fteps for having a falary fixed on a fchool- 
mafter will be foon taken. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations.—K woman died fome years ago 
at the age of 109 The principal difadvantages are the fear- 
city of fuel, and the wetnefs of the foil. Some of the heritors 
are making trials for coal, of which there is a favourable ap- 
pearance. The fuel commonly ufed is peat and turf ; fome 

coals are brought from Canonbie. Near the church are the 

veftiges of a Roman work, fome account of which maybe fpen 
in Pennant's tour; and feveral coins have been found here. 
The people in general feem to be economical, and con- 
tented with their fituation, though it cannot be faid that they 
enjoy in a great degree the comforts and advantages of focie- 
ty : there are many means by which their condition might be 

meliorated. The roads were originally made and kept in 

repair.by ftatute labour, which is now commuted. The turn- 
pike road from Glafgow to Carlifle panes through the parifh, 

in which is a toll-bar, lately let at L. 1 16 per annum. 

Thefe are fome fmall tippling ale, or rather whifky, houfes, in 
this diftrift, moft hurtful to the induftry, health, and morals 
vi the people.

    PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5476354">FOVERAN</name>. 

(PRESBYTERY OF ELLON, COUNTY AND SYNOD OF 

ABERDEEN.) 

By the Rev. Mr. William Duff.</head> 

<p>

Name, Extent, &amp;c. 
POVERAN, in the Celtic, is faid to fignify a Place of 
Springs, or of Water ; though the parifh poffefles no re- 
markable peculiarity with regard to the number or nature of its 
fprings.— It is bounded on the eaft by the fea, on the north-eaft 
by the river Ythan, which divides it from Forvie, (the antient 
name of a parifh now wholly overblown with fand), on the 
north by the burn of Tipperty ; and extends 4 miles in length 
from eaft to weft : the greater part of the parifh is 2 miles in 
breadth. The nature of the foil is various, but for the moft 
part fertile : next the fea it is fandy, next to that a fine deep 
loam/ generally on a bed of clay; a confiderable part confifts 
of ftrong clay, fome of which is cold, wet, and fpouting. 
Scarcely any part of the parifh is not arable. The corn fields 
are for the moft part clofe and contiguous, as well as fertile ; 
compenfating in fome meafure for the want of trees, of which 
very few are to be feen here, though feveral plantations have 

been

been lately made. The ground rifes by a gradual afcent from 
the fea, but in no place to any great height ; and the parifti, 
though not flat, is rather plain than hilly. The air is fome- 
what (harp and penetrating, efpecially when, the wind blows 
from the eafl: ; it is however abundantly wholefome. Vegeta- 
tion is remarkably quick and ftrong ; and the crops of fown 
grafs, in particular, are generally early and luxuriant. 

Rivers, Villages , tsfc. The river Ythan abounds with 

falmon, trout, and flounders. In it are innumerable beds of 
mufcles ; which are fent to Aberdeen, and fold at is. 8d. the 
peck, not only for the table, but for bait to the fifhers, though 
the latter have of late difcovered a reluctance to purchafe them, 
as they have rifen in the courfe of 1 2 years to double their 
former value. The bait, however, which they ufe as a fub- 
ftitute for mufcles, not having anfwered fo well, it is believed 
they will be obliged to comply with the demands of the tackf- 
man. — Pearls are found in the bed of the Ythan ; and, a 
few years ago, were pretty fuccefsfully fearched for, three or 
four miles up the river. 

At the mouth of the Ythan, is the village of Newburgh, a 
very dirty place, in a pleafant and commodious fituation. 
This village, though lying in a good corn country, half way 
between Aberdeen and Peterhead, and exceedingly conveni- 
ent for importing lime, coals, &amp;c. and exporting grain from 
all the neighbouring parifhes, has been unaccountably much 
neglected : it formerly contained about 200 inhabitants ; but 
the number is now confiderably reduced from want of proper 
encouragements and regulations. Within the memory of 
many perfons in the parifh, 7 filhing boats belonged to this 
village, now the number is reduced to one only, and even 
that is chiefly ufed for piloting veflels up the river. There is 
no harbour in the Ythan ; an advantage which, confidering 
3 the

the great number of {hips that frequent the river, is much 
wanted, and which it is fuppofed could be obtained at a mo- 
derate expence, The Ythan is navigable for about 3 miles 
from its mouth : {hips of 100 to 150 tons burden can come a 
mile up. 

In Newburgh are 6 or 7 ale-houfes ; chiefly frequented by 
failors, fmugglers, and fiftiermen. In the country part of the 
parifti is only one ale-houfe. 

Rent, Agriculture, &amp;c There are about 50 farms in the 

parifli, ; fome of them large, extending from 200 to 1 200 a- 
cres, fome of a moderate fize, and fome very fmall, befides 
feveral crofts of from 4 to 12 acres. One farm of 1200 acres is 
rented at L. 200 per annum ; another is let for L. 130 ; feve- 
ral from L. 60 to L. 80 ; others from L. 20 to L. 40 ; and a 
few from L. 15 to L. 20, converting the victual-rent at 
13s. 3d. per boll. Befides the rent, the tenants are bound to 
perform feveral fervices •, particularly that arbitrary exaction, 
known by the name of bonnage *, to which fome of thofe who 
have lately taken farms, have refufed to fubmit. The infield 
near the coaft, which is in general the beft ground in the pa- 
rifli, is let from 20s. to 30s. per acre. The valued rent is 

about L. 4000 Scotch ; the real rent extends from L. 2400 to 
L. 2600 fterling, including the falmon and mufcle-fimings, 
which let at about L. 220 fterling. 

Within thefe 14 and 15 years, agriculture has made very 
rapid advances in this diftria ; and the method of cultivation 
has undergone a very remarkable change. Before that period, 
the lands were neither drefled, nor had any intervals of reft, 
but carried perpetual crops of grain, to the utter impoverifti- 
ment of the ground. Now a great quantity of lime is ufed for 

manure; 



* Vide Vol. I. p. 433« 



of Foveran. 65 

manure ; large fields of fown grafs and turnips are to be feen; 
and confiderable numbers of cattle are fed on thefe green 
crops. The grain ufually fown is bear, oats, and peafe. On 
two or three farms, wheat has been tried with fuccefs, which, 
it may be prefumed, will tend to promote its more general 
cultivation. Harveft begins about the middle or end of Auguft. 
-In the parifli there are about 300 horfes ; 1500 cattle ; and 
an inconfiderable number of fheep; the nature of the foil and 
the mode of agriculture generally purfued, not being favoura- 
ble to the rearing of flocks. 

Trade and Manufactures.— The only trade that deferves 
to be mentioned, carried on here, is the importation of lime, 
coals, and wood, (with which laft 3 or 4 veflels are commonly 
freighted yearly from Norway or Garmouth ;) and the exporta- 
tion of grain and meal. The demand for lime has, within the 
laft 7 years, increafed in an aftonifhing degree : at lead 30 car- 
goes having been imported this year. It is only about 26 years 
fince the firft cargo of that valuable fpecies of manure, which 
was given gratis by one of the heritors to his tenants, in order 
to convince them of its advantages, was imported into this 
parifh. 

The (locking manufacture is carried on here, by the Aber- 
deen merchants) to a confiderable extent ; but fince the im- 
provements which have taken place in the flocking- looms, the 
price of knitting them has fallen fo low, that the women who 
continue to knit can with difficulty earn a fcanty fubfiftence. 
As the practice of fowing lint begins to gain ground in this 
country, it is hoped that the fpinning of linen, by which a 
good deal more can be earned, will likewife gradually pre- 
vail *.

In 1782, the wants of the parifhioners were, in a great mea- 
fure, fupplied by the importation of 4 cargoes of grain from 
England, which fold at about 28s. per boll. As this price , 
was too high for the poor to pay, the heritors contributed 
L. 20, the tenants L. 20, a third L. 20 was taken from the 
poor's funds, and L. 20 more was borrowed, making in all 
L. 80 ; with which the feffion bought oat and peafe meal : the 
former they fold at prime co ft, is. 3d. per peck ; and with e- 
very peck of oat-meal fo fold, they gave 2 pecks of peafe meal 
gratis ; by which means the poor had their meal altogether at 
5d. the peck, and their wants were feafonably and effectually 
fupplied. One of the tenants not only advanced the laft L. 20 
without charging intereft, but fold a confiderable quantity of 
meal to the poor at is. per peck, when it had rifen to is. 6d. 
in the market, as an evidence of his gratitude to Providence 
for blefling him, amidft the general fcarcity, with a plentiful 
crop.

hofpitable to Strangers, charitable to the poor, humane and 
companionate to the {hip-wrecked, when fuch accidents hap- 
pen ; and, in general, juft and honeft in their dealings. Smug- 
gling, however, is frequently carried on, and tends in no in- 
confiderable degree to corrupt the morals of the people : but 
this contraband trade feems, through the falutary meafures a- 
dopted by government, to be at prefent on the decline ; and 
its total annihilation is devoutly to be wifhed for by every friend 

to virtue and induftry The mode of living has undergone 

a great alteration of late. The tenants in general are in good 
circumftances, live comfortably, and maintain a decent ap- 
pearance. A tafte for finery in drefs has pervaded all ranks. 

The principal difadvantage is the fcarcity of fuel : peat 

is moll commonly ufed, but procured with difficulty, owing 
to the fcarcity of mofs. The heavy duty on coal prevents its 
being more generally made ufe of, notwithstanding the facility 
of procuring it The roads in the parifli, which are tolera- 
bly good, are made by Statute- labour. Many of the tenants 
with for turnpikes, being fully fenfible of the advantages a- 
rifing from them. 

Hints for the Melioration of the Situation and Circumftances 

of the People. As proprietors, who refide upon their eftates, 

have daily opportunities of obferving the wants and fufFerings 
of their tenants, whom it is equally their duty and intereft to 
protect and encourage, they might probably, in a great mea- 

fure, 

of an old chapel, called the Red Ch?pel of Buchan. About half a mile from 
Newburgh, the ruins of the old caftle of Knockhall, one of the feats of the 
family of Udny, pleafantly fituated, ftrikes the eye of the fpe£ator. Some 
remains of another caftle belonging to a family of the name of Fiddes, now 
cxtindl, are ftill to be feen ; and there are fcveral tumuli or cairns in the pa- 
rifh. 



of Foveran. 69 

fure, fupply the one and relieve the other, by adopting fbme 
fiich plans as the following : 

ift, To let their lands at moderate rents and grant long lea- 
fes to their tenants with fuitable encouragement for making 
improvements on their farms, (either by clearing the ground 
of ftones, draining, inclofing, or bringing muirs and wafte land 
under cultivation and pafture), and by allowing them a rea- 
fonable compenfation for what they have judicioufly expended 
on fuch improvements. 

2dly, To abolifh all perfonal fervices, efpecially during feed- 
time and harveft, together with miln-multures, allowing the 
miller only payment for his trouble in grinding the corn to the 
tenants. 

3Jly, To let farms of a moderate fize to fober and induftri- 
ous tenants, even in preference to thofe who promife a larger 
rent, which, after all, they may not be able to pay. 

4thly, To prevent, by proper reftriclions, in the leafes they 
grant to their tenants, as well as by their own example, all 
unreafonable and extravagant exactions of rent, as well as of 
perfonal fervices from fub-tenants ; who too often feel the 
fcourge of thofe petty oppreflbrs, to whofe tyranny they are 
fubjeeted, when they are not reftrained by prohibiting claufes, 
enforced by proper penalties in their leafes. For inftance, a te- 
nant might be prohibited, under the penalty of forfeiting his 
leafe, from letting land to cottagers above a certain fum, 
(which mult, no doubt, vary according to the nature of the 
foil, and the fituation of the place), as well as from demand- 
ing any of thofe feudal fervices, which are only fo many bad- 
ges of flavery. 

5thly, and laftly, It might be advantageous, in an age fo 
famed as the prefent for aflbciations, to institute parochial 
clubs, confifting of the proprietors, minifter, and fuch farm- 
ers of the pariih, as choofe to become members, to meet twice 



7° Statijlical Account 

a year, in fpring and autumn ; when the former would have 
opportunities of inquiring into the plans adopted by the latter, 
in the management of their farms, and of giving feafonable 
advices to the flothful, and fuitable approbation and encou- 
ragement to the induftrious. At thefe meetings, at which 
the proprietors and minifter might officiate in rotation, as pre- 
sents, a collection mould be made by voluntary afleffment, 
according to the different circumftances and inclinations of the 
members, out of which, after defraying the expences of the 
meeting, which fhould never exceed i s. 6d. each, the furplus 
fhould be converted into a fund for encouraging induftry a- 
mong the cottagers. Out of this fund, fmall premiums from 
5s. to 1 os. might be diftributed to 4 or 5 cottagers yearly, 
who fhould raife the belt turnips or grafs upon not lefs than £ 
of an acre each. By a judicious and impartial diftribution of thefe 
fmall premiums, a fpirit of induftry and emulation would be ex- 
cited among the cottagers ; their crops of grafs and grain would 
be more plentiful, and their fituation and circumftances would 
become much more comfortable. By fuch periodical meetings 
landlords would become thoroughly acquainted with the fitua- 
tion, management, and conduct both of the tenants and cot- 
tagers y thofe ties which unite men to men would be drawn 
tighter and clofer ; fentiments of refpect and gratitude — of at- 
tachment and confidence, would fpontaneoufly arife and ex- 
pand, in the hearts of the tenants towards their landlords, 
whom they would thus be induced to confider as their patrons 
and protectors j and, by this primitive and patriarchal kind of 
intercourfe, fo agreeable to a benevolent mind, the general 
harmony and happinefs of focial life would be improved and 
augmented. </p>

'T'HE true" orthography of Damelingtoun is faid to be 
Dame-Heleris-Unvn, after a lady of rank and fortune, 
of the name of Helen, who built a caftle near this place.—— 
The parifh is about 8 miles long, and between 2 and 3 in 

breadth. The foil in the lower parts, lying upon the river 

Doon, is a ftrong, rich, deep clay : around the village of Da- 
melingtoun, it is dry and gravelly ; and towards the hilly parts, 
hard and rocky. About a mile below the village is a large 
morafs *, which formerly rendered the climate very unheal- 
thy, particularly to children ; but fince it has been drained, 
and two fmall ftreams carried through its centre, the climate

is become more falubrious, the children are flout and health- 
ful, and there are now many inftances of longevity in the pa- 

rifli Immediately beyond this large morafs, runs the river 

Doon, -where there is perhaps the largefl tradl of natural mea- 
dows that is to be found in any part of Scotland. Thefe fine 
meadows are apt to be overflowed, by which their grafs is fil- 
led with fand and rendered hurtful to cattle ; and often, in 
great fpeats, a great deal of hay is carried away. In order to 
prevent this damage, the proprietors cut through a very high 
and folid rock at the foot of Loch Doon, (from whence the ri- 
ver flows), but the event did not anfwer their expectations. 
Loch Doon is a beautiful piece of water, 9 miles long, abound- 
ing in trout, with a hard rocky coaft. On an ifland are the 
remains of a fine old caftle, and there was a beautiful natural 
cafcade at the foot of the loch, before the cut was made. 

Minerals. — The parifh is full of fine coal, and freeftone, in 
almoft every corner of it. Thefe two ufeful articles terminate 
here, there being none to the fouthward beyond this parifh. 
Coal is carried from hence, to the diftance of 30 miles, into 
Galloway. There is alfo iron-ftone to be found in the parifh, 
and lead in fome of the hills. Near the village of Dameling- 
toun is the cheapeft and beft coal that is to be found in the weft 
of Scotland.

The population, in the country part of the parifh, has con- 
fiderably diminifhed, owing to the monopolizing of farms, or 
conjoining a number of pofleflions into one ; but it has in- 
ereafed in proportion in the village of Damelingtoun, which 
contains about 500 inhabitants. Seven fairs are held in it e- 
very year ; and it has 5 or 6 public houfes, kept by people of 
good character. Near the village are two large commons, let 
»t a reafonable rate to the inhabitants, for feeding their 
cattle upon. Each common may feed 25 or 30 cows. There 
is plenty of coal, freeftone, and good water, all around; fo 
that, upon all thefe accounts, Damelingtoun is particularly well 
fituated for a woolen manufactory, efpecially as it is in the 
neighbourhood of numerous and fine flocks of {heep. Ac- 
cordingly, a few public-fpirited men propofe immediately to 
eftablilh both a woolen and a cotton manufactory here; which, 
in time, will probably be productive of the happieft effects ; 
as the inhabitants of the village are a fober, induftrious, re- 
gular, and well-informed fet.

CULTER is a Latin word, fignifying a Coulter or Ploiigh- 
fhare, though it is uncertain upon what account this 

parifh was fo named ; — The length of the parifh is about 8 

miles j and the breadth varies, but is at an average about 4 
miles. The level or lowland part of the parifh, which is well 
cultivated and improved, is about a miles broad from the banks

the foot of the hilly ground on the fouthu The fituation is de-

try, and the foil is very proper for that crop. People from a 
confiderable diftance will chearfully pay as. 6d for as much 
land as is requifite for fowing a cap-full,or forpet of feed, 40 of 
which meafures are allotted to an acre : each forpet generally 
produces from 12 to 25 lb. of dreffed flax from the mill.— The 
harveft is in general earlier by a week than in other parifh in 
the vicinity.— The air in the fouthern part of this diftricl, is 
very (harp in winter, the hills being generally covered with 
fnow ; while the inhabitants in the lowland places enjoy a clear 

and dry air. Culter-water, which falls into the Clyde, after 

bifeding the parifh, abounds with trout.

The horfes, which are generally bred here, or In the vici- 
nity, are ftrong made, capable of enduring much fatigue, and 
have lately advanced in value. A good many flieep and black- 
cattle are fattened by the gentlemen, and fome of the farmers, 
who find a ready fale for them, purchafers appearing from La- 
nark, Hamilton, and even from Glafgow. Numbers are now 
alfo fold into Biggar; where, for fome time paft, has been an 
excellent market for butcher meat of all kinds- 

Stipend, School, and Poor. The ftipend is L. 41:13:4 

fterling, (including 50 merks Scotch for communion ele- 
ments), 2 chalders of oatmeal, and 1 of bear. The glebe 
confifts of 8|- acres, and may be rated at L. 10. — Sir Charles 

Rofs of Balnagowan is patron. The fchoolmafter's falary 

is L. 8:6: 8, with a houfe and garden, and other emoluments, 
amounting to about L. 5 more. The collections at the church- 
doors amount to about L. 8 per annum, -a large fum, confider- 
ing the fmall number of inhabitants, but owing chiefly to the 
liberal offerings of fome genteel families refident here. This, 
with the intereft of L. 103, the capital of the poor's funds, 
is diftributed once a fortnight among the enrolled poor, who 
are 7 in number ; and part is employed in relieving the occa- 
sional diftreffes of others, and in paying the fees of poor fcho- 
lars. No beggars are to be feen in the parifh. 

Mifcellaneous Remarhs. The people are healthy, being 

moftly employed in active occupations, and are fober and ex- 
emplary. Rheumatifms and colds are the moft prevalent dif- 

ea f es . There are in the parilh four encampments, all of 

a circular figure, called rings by the common people : likewife 



of Cutter. 79 

a fmall circular artificial mound of earth, on the banks of the 
Clyde, within view of two others at a confiderable diftance. 

llhe principal difadvantages are the diftance from coal, 

which is brought ii miles from Douglas,- and the want of a 
bridge over the Clyde, which is often impaffable. There are 
few peat-mofles here, and not many people who dig more fuel 
than is neceffary for drying their grain for the mill.— There are 
fome mineral fprings, impregnated with iron ; and iron-ftone, 
faid to be of an excellent quality, is found in great plenty, in 
different parts of the parifh.

Name, Extent, Soil, Rivers, 

'TP HE original orthography of this parilh feems to have 

been Maria cultura. It is of an oblong form; 6 

Englifh miles in length, and 2 in breadth ; extending from 
the river Dee to the Grampian mountains. The foil on the 
river fide is naturally thin and fandy ; on the rifing midland it 
becomes deeper and blacker, with a bottom of clay in fome 
parts ; and more fouthward, the ground turns fwampy, turfy, 
and moffy. The extremities of the parilh are in fome places 
rocky hills and mofiTes ; in others, green hills with large (tones, 
rufhy muirs, and heath. Indeed the whole district is rocky 
and {tony, except fome fmall haughs and dales on the river 
fide ; and thoroughly to improve, inclofe, and render tolera- 
bly fertile, a piece of wafte ground here, may be almoft term- 
ed a new creation. The old farms extended acrofs the whole 
breadth of the parilh, from the Dee to the Grampians, by which 
tneans every tenant had a portion of all the different foils. 

The 



Of Marycidture. 8 1 

The Dee, which wafhes the north fide of the parifh for a- 
bove 6 miles, is famous for its falmon, which are caught by 
flat-bottomed fkiffs and nets. There are 5 falmon-fifhings in 

the parifh. This ftream frequently overflows its banks, 

particularly in May and June, after a fnowy winter, which 
often damages the fown land : but the moft hurtful floods u- 
fually happen in September, when they carry off great quan- 
tities of cut grain, and level the ftanding corn among the fand. 
A remarkable flood occurred on the 17th September, 176S, 

by which many fufFered considerably. There is a ferry for 

horfes, carriages, &amp;c. oppofite to the manfe. 

Renty Natural Produclions &amp;c. — Including the farms in 
the poffeffion of the heritors, and the fifhings, the rent of the 
whole parifh will amount to L. 1000 fleriing. There are 28 
ploughgates of land in this difhri6l ; 20 of which belong to 
one heritor, and other two gentlemen have 4 each. Black 
cattle have been fed here, that fold from L. 20 to L. 25 each. 
The produce of the parifh more than fupplies the inhabitants 
with provifions. The old rents were made up of money, meal, 
bear, fheep, hogs, lambs, poultry, butter, eggs, and manual 
fervices ; but, of late years, thofe called ipfa corpora are all 
converted into money. — Red and white clover and rye-grafs 
are fold by many of the farmers, as alfo turnips. "Some of 
the befl arable land is let at 20s. and fome of the worfl paf- 

ture at 5d. per acre In the rrtinifter's glebe is a quarry of 

granite. A large portion of the parifh is covered with wood. 
In Kingcaufie-wood are fome deer of the roe kind, of a fmall 
fize, increafing in number every year. — The parifh in general 
is uninclofed. The people are convinced of the advantages of 
inclofing, but have neither money, nor length of leafes, fufri- 
eient for that purpofe.

Manufaftures Spinning and knitting worded (lockings 

is the general employment of all females from 7 years old and 
upwards. The combed wool for that purpofe is given out by 
hofiers from Aberdeen, in different parts of the parifh, on cer-

ftockings are received. Each pair cofts, for fpinning and knit- 
ting, from is. to 3s. 6d. the cheapeft are accounted the moft 
profitable, both to the worker and the merchant. — The com- 
mon fuel is peat and furze, but the peat-moffes are now quite

of is. a fmall cart load : coals can be got cheaper in Aber-

This parifh was more populous 70 or 80 'years ago than it 
is at prefent. This decline of population is owing to the 
failure of peat and turf for fuel, and the removal of feveral 
perfons from hence to Aberdeen, with the view of getting 
conftant employment. 

Stipend, School, Poor The value of the living will be 

from L. 70 to L. 75 fterling, including a glebe, 10 acres of 
which have been rendered arable by the prefent incumbent, 

at a great expence. The minifter, for fome years paft, 

has kept an academy, taught by two of his fons ; at which are 
ufually from 20 to 26 young gentlemen, fome from the Weft 

Indies and America, and others from England. The poor 

receiving alms conftantly, are from 30 to 35, and feveral are 
occafionally relieved: the fum of collections, annual-rents, 
and penalties, for their ufe, is from L. 30 to L. 38 per annum, 
of which about L. 4 as collected for, and given to the infir- 
mary of Aberdeen. In 1782 and 1783, many lived very 
fparingly and hardly in this parifh : the kirk-femon bought 
meal and peafe repeatedly at Aberdeen, when they could be 
got, and diftributed or fold them out at reduced rates ; but 
the people have not yet recovered the extraordinary ftrefs and 
expence of thefe years. The heritors are always doing good, 
and contributing to the relief of the diftreffed. 

Mifcellancous Obfervations. The people are generally fo- 

ber and induftrious •, and mud be ceconomical, as they can-

man who died lately, was 6 feet 7 inches high. A widow 
woman died laft year aged 102, and a man lately at the ad- 
vanced age of 104 Potter's earth is found in the parifh. 

The road along the fouth fide of the Dee is in general 

good. — The ftatute labour is both exacted in kind, and com- 
muted for money.— No turnpikes are needed or wifhed for in 
the parifh.

<p>

Extent, Surface, and Soil. 

THE parim of Daviot, ftriftly fo called, extends to about 
3^ miles in length, and 2 in breadth. But feveral 
lands in the parimes of Chapel and Fyvie, were, in the end of 
laft century, annexed to it, quoad facra, by act of Aflembly ; 
fo that the whole, under the minifter's charge, is nearly 5 

miles in length and 4 in breadth. The foil of the pariih is 

various, confifting partly of ftrong clay, partly of rich loam, 
but in general fertile. Its expofure is chiefly to the S. and 
S. E. and there are few hills in the parim. 

Number of Inhabitants.* The return to Dr Webfter in 

1755, was 975 fouls ; the number of inhabitants in the pro- 
per parim of Daviot is nearly 700, but in the whole parifh 
under the minifter's charge, 900 : of thefe, 40 are Epifcopa- 
lians, 



Rent 



Statiftical Account 

Rent and Size of Farms. —The whole rents of the parifh 
are above L. 950 fterling. The valued rent is L. 2250 Scotch. 
The rent of the farms is from L. 10 to L. 60 fterling ; and 
the fize from 20 to 100 acres. There are above 500 acres 
inclofed. The new hufbandry begins to take place of the old 
but a regular rotation of crops is not yet eftablifhed. One of 
the heritors buys yearly from the Weft Highlands a good ma- 
ny cattle, which turn out uncommonly well when put into 
his rich inclofures. Owing to this circumftance, however, it 
is impoffible to give an exa£l number of the cattle, as this fluc- 
tuates very much, there being at prefent not 40 cattle where 
there were about 300. There are about 20 acres of turnips, 
and 300 acres of fown grafs, fome of it very old and rich. 
The inhabitants raife a good many potatoes for private ufe. 

. The time of fowing oats is from the middle of March to 

the end of April ; of fowing bear, frpm the middle to the end 
of May ; and of fowing turnips, the firft three weeks of June : 
flax of late has been introduced, and is fown in the beginning 
of May. — Harveft continues from the middle of Auguft to the 

middle of September. The principal manure ufed in this 

diftricl: is lime, which is partly Englifti lime, from Aberdeen 
and Newburgh, and partly Scots, from Udny and Pitmed- 
den. 

ManufaBures, &amp;c. There is a licenfed diftillery, and a 

flax, malt, and barley-mill, all which have good employment ; 

and the knitting of ftockings is general in the parifti. There 

are few good houfes in the parifti, but fome good houfes have 

been built for the diftillery and mills before-mentioned. 

The principal fuel is peats from the mofs, and turf from the 

muir. There are two Druids temples, one of which makes 

part of the church yard. 



Heritors* 



of Daviot. / 87 

Heritors. — There are 4 heritors "nthe parifh ; of whom one 
refictes. 

Ecckfiajlical State.— This parifh was formerly a parfonage 
or prebend in the diocefe of Aberdeen, and was given as an 
aim's gift by Malcolm Canmore to the Bifhop of Aberdeen. 
— The ftipend was lately augmented, and is now three chal- 
ders of victual, and L. 53 : 6 : 8 fterling. 

Mifcellaneous Remarks The people are in general fober, in- 

duftrious, and peaceable, and contented with their fituation. 
— The advantages are early harvefts, good foil, and the induf- 
try of the people ; the difadvantages are fhort leafes, diftance 
from lime, (from Aberdeen twenty Englifh miles}, and want 
of encouragement to improve on any large fcale. 

Longevity. — One perfon in this parifh died at the age of 113; 
her fon is now 100, and in good health. The late incumbent 
at Daviot was about 56 years minifter. At the time he was 
50 years minifter of this parifh, there were four elder mem- 
bers in the prefbytery of Garioch, the eldeft of whom was in 
the 6 1 ft year of his miniftry, and other two lived till they 
were 60 years minifters of the Eftablifhed church. It is flrong 
evidence of the healthy climate of the Garioch, that out of 
15 members of prefbytery, the 5 oldeft upon the roll lived to 
be all of them nearly, and fome of them above 60 years mi- 
nifters, and from 80 to 90 years old.

<p>

Name, Extent, end SoiL 
T) ALQUHIDDER, in the Celtic language, means 3 
Village upon which five Glens open, or a Village in 
the centre of five Glens. It is an inland and highland pa- 
rifh of about 15 computed miles in length, lying from E. S. 
to N. W. and the . greateft breadth is about 7 miles. The 
mcft confiderable part of the parifh confifts of hills, which in 
general are very fteep and high, partly covered with heath, 
but moftly green, 'the heather of late years having been much 
deflroyed by the fneep manure. The foil upon the declivity 
of the hills is for the moft part deep and dry, and produces ex- 
cellent pnfture for black-cattle and fheep, but from the height 
and fteepnefs of the hills, feems particularly fitted for the lat- 
ter. Part of the hill ground is fwampy, producing fprots and 
ftrong grafs, fit for ftanding winter ftorms. The flat part of the 
parifh is narrow •, the foil of which is partly a light loam made 
up of 'fand and clay, carried down with great rapidity by the

torrents from the adjacent hills, and partly four and moffy, 
svhich is very level, a great part of it being covered by three 
Jakes. 

Lakes, Inundations ; and Fijh The lakes are Lochddine, 

Lochvoil, and one half of Lochlubnaig, In time of floods, 
the intermediate grounds, both meadow and arable, are al- 
moft wholly inundated, fo as to form one continued fheet 
of water about c2 miles in length. There are, perhaps, 
10 or 12 fuch floods in a year. When any of them happen 
in the months of Auguft or September, which is often the 
cafe, they occafion very confiderable damage. Thefe lakes 
are connected by the river Balvag, and are one of the fources 
of the Teith, which pafies through Callendar of Monteith, and 
runsintothe Forth near Stirling. Thefe lakes and river abound in 
common-trout, bull-trout, and jar, all of an excellent quality ; 
a few falmon appear in the proper feafon, and great numbers 
in fpawning-time. The trout is in greateft perfe&amp;ion in A- 
pril and May ; the jar in Auguft. There is a confiderable fall 
at a fmall diftance from the foot of Lochlubnaig, where, by- 
cutting fome feet of rock, carrying forward the level, deep- 
ning a few fords, and ftraighting the courfe of the river, it is 
likely a confiderable quantity of ground might be gained from 
the lakes, the overflowing be greatly prevented, or at any rate 
more fpeedily carried off. Mr Buchanan of Achlefhie, a con. 
fiderable heritor in this parifii, and an enterprifing and fuc- 
cefsful improver, has this feafon begun to cut the rock near 
.the foot of Lochlubnaig; if all the other heritors concerned 
will heartily co-operate, it is to be hoped the good effecls will 
foon be vifible on .thefe often deluged lands. The plan pro- 
pofed feems rational and equitable, viz. that the different pro* 
prietors upon the fides of thefe lakes and river, fhould bear th* 
expence in proportion to the benefit which fh»U eventually ac*

crue to each. The only other lake in the 'parifh is the head 
or weft end of the beautiful Lochearn. 

Hills, Woods, esV.—The hills in the N. E. and W. end of 
the parifh are partly rocky, but, upon the whole, it cannot be 
faid that much furface is loft either by rocks or barrennefs of 
foil. The higheft hills are the fouth point of Benmoir, which, 
according to MrStobie, is 3903 feet above the level of the fea, 
and the weft fide of Benvoirlich, 3 300 feet in height. 

According to tradition, all the lower grounds, and the foot 
of the hills in this parifh, were formerly covered with woods. 
And in the mofies there have been found large trunks of oak, 
aller, and birch. There is now little more of oak and birch 
than ferves the inhabitants for roofing their houfes, and for 
the utenfils of hufbandry. At the laft cutting, the oak-wood 
fold at L. 1400 fterling, chiefly for the fake of the bark. 

There are fome appearances of lead-ore, on the property of 
Mr Drummond of Perth, in this parifh : feveral trials have 
been made, but no proper vein difcovered. There is abun- 
dance of limeftone of eafy accefs, in different parts ; but fuel 
for burning is fcarce. 

Clhmte and Difeafes.-Thc air is moift, the climate being 
very rainy, owing to the great height of the hills which break 
the clouds, though at a confiderable diftance from any fea. 
The heavieft rains come by the S. and S. W. winds in fummer 
and harveft •, and the fevereft ftorms in winter and fpring are 
from the N. E. The raoft frequent difeafes are fevers and 
rheumatifms, probably owing to the variable climate, (the 
rranfitions from heat and cold being fudden and irregular), to 
fcarcity of fuel, damp houfes, and the people wearing the fame 
kind and quantity of clothes in fummer as in winter. After all, 
the climate cannot be called unhealthy. There are feveral in the 

parao.

parifh jufl; now above 80 years of age, and there have been 
different inftances within the laft 20 years of perfons, dying a- 
bove 90 years old. 

Number of Horfes, Cattle, Sheep, &amp;c The number of 

horfes is about 170 ; of black- cattle, about 800 $ and of fheep, 
18,000. The fheep are moflly of the ftrong black faced fouth 
country breed. The fize and hardinefs of the animal feem to 
have been more attended to than the quality of the fleece, the 
wool being long and coarfe. The average price of white wool 
unwafhed, for fome years paft, is 7s. 3d. per ftone, tron 
weight, and of the layed or tarry wool, 5s. 3d. per ftone. If 
the quality of the wool could be improved without diminifhing 
the fize of the animal, or making it lefs able to endure cold in 
any period of its exiftence, it would greatly increafe the value 
of lands in this parifh. The only objection, which feems well- 
founded, to an attempt towards meliorating the wool in this cli- 
mate, arifes from this circumftance, that all the fme-wooled 
kinds of fheep are bare or fhort in the pile when dropt as lambs. 
The month of April and the beginning of May, which is the 
lambing feafon, are in this climate cold and often rainy; whence 
it is believed, that the rough or coarfe wooled lambs alone 
could fland the weather. It will not be proper to have the 
lambing feafon more advanced in fummer, becaufe neither the 
lambs nor their dams will, in that cafe, be fufficiently ftrong and 
•hearty to bear the feverity of the enfuing winter. The car- 
cafe of a wedder, when three years old, commonly weighs a- 
bout 40 lb. Dutch weight, and has from 4 lb. to 6 lb. of tal- 
low, when fit for flaughter, towards the end of September. 

Population, Sv.— According to the returns to Dr Webfter, 
the number of fouls was 1 592 ; at prefent it has decreafed to 
about 1300. The annual average of baptifms for 6 years,

13. The natural fmall pox was very mortal in winter 1786 and 
1787. Five children in one family were cut off by this dread- 
ful malady in the courfe of one week : this havoc alarmed the 
neighbourhood, and introduced inoculation with fuccefs. 

There are 14 heritors, of whom 6 for the moft part refide. 
The number of ploughgates of old extent is 60 ; 16 of which, 
both hill and dale, are now let in fheep-walks to 8 tackfmen ; 
thefe were formerly occupied by 50 tenants, befides a number

Divijon of Lands, Rent, and C^.-There is no part of 
the parifh in common •, the marches of each proprietor are 
known, and, with few exceptions, the marches of each farm 
are diftbaiy marked. Every farm has what is called a head- 
dyke, which divides the hill-pafture where the horfes, yeld- 
cattle, and fheep of the farm, range, from the arable and 
meadow ground, and pafture of the milch-cows. Moft or 
the farms are divided from each other by march-dykes ; thefe, 
with a head-dyke on one fide, and the lake or river on the other, 
compleatly inclofe the farms : fome of them are fub-divided. 
The rent of the hills is from is. to 3 s. for the grafs of every 
fheep. Where there are feveral fmall tenants upon one farm, 
the farm is (what they call) fawned \ which means, that the 
number of cattle it can properly maintain or pafture, is afcer- 
tained, that none of the tenants may exceed his juft propor- 
tion, nor over-ftock the farm. The rule in fouming is, 4 
fheep equal to I cow, and 8 fheep equal to i horfe. The 
meadow and arable land lets from 5s. to 15 s. per acre. The 
rent of the whole parifh is L. 2600 fterling. The extent of 
the arable and meadow grounds, bears but a very fmall pro- 
portion to that of the hills. The crops are oats, bear, pota- 
toes, and flax. The returns from oats are very inconfiderable, 
generally 2, feldom 3 or 4 ; of bear, from 4 to 6 ; of flax, about 
£ of a ftone, tron-weight, from a lippie of feed, allowing 
it 200 fquare Scotch yards of ground. The returns from po- 
tatoes are from 15 to 20 bolls. Moft of the inhabitants fubfift

months in the year : they commonly eat it with milk, and ufe 
it for bread to dinner with beef and mutton. 

There are 4 mills for drefling flax ; the average dreft for 
6 years paft, is about 600 (tones. 

No green crops ate raifed, excepting upon the farm of E- 
dinample, by the proprietor, who farms, according to fyftem, 
an excellent foil, lying upon limeftone. The crops faifed in 
the parifti are by no means fufficient for the confumpt of the 
inhabitants i about one- fifth part of the oat-meal ufed, is im» 
ported. The price of provifions is regulated by the Stirling 
market, with the addition of the expence of carriage, and a 
fmall profit to the retailer. 

Imports and Exports. The imports are, oat-meal, fmall 

early oats for feed, tar and butter for fmearing their {heep, 
which practice of late has become very general, being found 
of great benefit by defending the animal from cold, and im- 
proving the quality of the wool. The exports are, {heep to 
the Glafgow and Edinburgh markets, and alfo to England. 
For fome years paft there has been a great demand for flieep- 
hogs and lambs from the Weft and North Highlands, but it 
is decreafing, as thefe lands are now moftly fupplied from ad- 
jacent farms that are already ftocked : as a neceflary confe- 
quence, lambs are falling in price, which muft foon afle£l the 
Value of {heep farms in this country, almoft all of them being 
at prefent ftocked with breeding ewes. The returns from a 
Wedder ftock will not afford the rent at which many of thefe 
farms are now let. A few black cattle are fold for winterers. 
A confiderable quantity of wool, both white and tarry, un- 
waftied, is annually exported.

of it being either rocky or marfhy ground. The Duke of A- 

thol is patron *. 

There are from 20 to 30 for fome years paft upon the 
poor's roll ; the only funds for fupporting thefe, are the Sun- 
day coitions, and the intereft of a fmall fum accumulated 
from a few particular donations, and the furplus of the Sun- 
day colleaions. This fum has increafed within thefe 18 years 
from L. 25 to L. 100 fterling. There are two general diftri- 
butions in the year, to fuch as can travel through the parifh, 
for purchafmg fhoes, &amp;c. and frequently to thofe who are 
confined by age or diftrefs. 

Befides the parochial fchool, there are other two charity- 
fchools in the parifh, with fmall falaries from the Society for 
Propagating Chriftian Knowledge in Scotland. One of thefe 
is at Lochearn-head, the other about the middle of Strathire* 
thefe are upwards of 6 miles diftant from one another; and 
each of them about 5 miles from the parochial fchool. There 
are from 60 to 80 fcholars commonly in each of thefe fchools, 
during the months of December, January, February, and 
March. Towards the end of Spring, moft of the boys go to 
the low country, where they are employed in herding tdl the 
enfuing winter •, and, befides gaining a fmall fee, they have 
the advantage of acquiring the Englifh language.

The militaryroad from Stirling to Fort William pafles through 
this parifti 10 miles; 8 of which have lately been put in excellent 
repair at the expence of Government ; 2 miles are ftill very 
bad, and there is fo much up and donxir. hill in the prefent di- 
rection, that it cannot be made a tolerable road for carriages. 
An alteration in the line has been propofed, which has this 
feafon been infpe&amp;ed and approved of by Colonel Montgome- 
ry; and it is hoped will be executed next fummer. As the com- 
munication by Glenco and the ferry of Balachoalifti to Fort 
William is now opened, when the alteration near Lochearn- 
head is made as propofed, the whole line from Edinburgh to 
Fort William or Appin, will be eafy and comfortable. There 
are feveral lines of communication through this parifti, which 
are yet only formed by the ftatute fervices. As thefe fervices 
are now converted into money, there will be a fund, which, if 
properly managed, will in a few years make thefe roads tole- 
rably good. There are 2 excellent bridges, one of 3 arches, the 
other of 2, built about 10 years ago upon the water of Bal- 
vaig ; and 5 bridges were built this year upon rapid burns in 
different parts of the parifti by fubfcriptions in the country, 
with a fmall aid from the county funds, — Good roads and eafy 
accefs to markets are to be numbered among the advantages of 
this parifti. Want of manufactures, and fcarcity of fuel, are

The people are, in general, lively, intelligent, fond of news, 
and hofpitable to flrangers. Few of them are rich, and not 
many of them poor : upon the whole, they live comfortably. 
The confeqUences of the civil war in 1745 may with juftice 
be reckoned the caufe of their civilization. Till that era, ma- 
ny ftrong traces of the feudal fyftem, with its peculiar difad-

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1011095">NEW CUMNOCK</name>, 

(county and presbytery of air, synod of 
glasgow and air.) 

By the Rev. Mr. James Young.</head>  


<p>
Extent, Soil, and Climate. 

THE name of the parifh, and of moft places in it, is de- 
rived from the Celtic. The form is very much of an 
oblong fquare, being 1 2 miles in length from E. to W. and 
fomewhat more than 8 in breadth ; and the whole fquare con- 
tent of it may be above 100 miles, or 50,000 acres. At the 
church the dale country terminates, and fouthwards the pa- 
rifh is generally a pafture country for fheep. The foil is gene- 
rally good and rough, and the hills are covered with green. 
The air is generally healthful, witnefs the long lives, of many 
who have died above 90, or near it, and fome now in the pa- 
rim have reached that period. 

Springs, Rivers, and Lakes.-— In fuch a hilly country as 
this, there muft be feveral mineral fprings, but they are not 
much ufed. The river Nith takes its rife in the S. W. end, 
and runs through the middle, of the parifc. There are 3 lakes 

on- 



of New Cumnock. 99 

on the north fide, which run into the water of Lugar at Cum- 
nock. There are feveral pikes found in this water ; and a- 
bundance of trouts in the river Afton, which takes its origin 
in the fouth part of the parifh, and runs into the Nith near 
the church. Thefe rivers are not navigable. The Nith, for 3 
miles, runs in a ftraight wide plain with a fmall declivity ; 
which, in the opinion of fome, was formerly a marfli : on 
both fides of the ftream in this plain there are fertile grounds 
and meadows, but they are fometimes overflowed in fpeats. 

' Minerals.-' There are various mines of coal and lime, which 
ferve the neighbourhood ; though little is confumed, owing 
to the want of a navigable river ; in which cafe, a greater eftate 

would arife from them than from the furface of the land. 

There is now a lead-mine working in Afton barony, about 3 
miles S. W. from the church, in which a company of Quakers 
have entered into a contract. Twenty miners are employed, 
and more are expected according to the apparent fuccefs. A 
wodd mine was lately found on the eftate of the Earl of Dum- 
fries. 

Population According to the returns to Dr Webfter in 

1755, the number of fouls was 1497 ; though, when the pre- 
fent incumbent was fettled, about 1757, the number was little 
more than 1000. It may now amount to about 1200, two 
villages having been built near the church, and on Afton-wa- 
ter, where there was but one houfe in 1757. There may be 
40 births, near as many deaths, and about 10 marriages, per 
annum. There may be 80 farmers and ftorekeepers, and 
more cottagers, 200 men-fervants, near as many women-fer- 
vants, about 400 horfes, near 1000 milch-cows and their fol- 
lowers. The number of ftieep cannot be eafily guefied at.

Four or five of the lower kind of heritors refide in the parifli, 
but the principal proprietors, who are General Stewart, Sir 
Andrew Cathcart, Mr Rofs of Kerfe, Captain Maxwell, &amp;c. 
are non-refident. About 12 of the inhabitants are Sece- 
ders. 

Produce* The parifh produces chiefly bear and oats. 

Abundance of potatoes are raifed, and moftly ufed for the 
fupport of the inhabitants. Quantities of bear, cheefe, and 
butter, are exported, and with them the farmers make up 
their rents. The crops are liable to feveral accidents when 
the harveft is late, and fuffer much by early frofts, mildews, 
and making winds, efpecially in the marfhy and fluid grounds. 
The harveft in 1790 was juft finifhing at the date of the mi- 
nifter's report, (9th November.) 

Ecckfiajlical State, ferV. This diftri£r. was detached from 

the parifh of Cumnock, and formed into a feparate charge 
about the middle of the laft century. The prefent in- 
cumbent was fettled in 1757; and his predeceffor had the 

charge no lefs than 54 years. The Earl of Dumfries is 

patron. The living is L. 640 Scotch, including commu- 
nion elements, one chalder of meal, and another of bear. 
The glebe is greater than the legal fize, but lies open and 
uninclofed, the high road palling through the middle of it.

of L. 100 Scotch, confifting fometimes of 30, and fome-

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3776817">KIRKMICHAEL</name>. 

(presbytery and county of air, synod of 
glasgow and air.) 

By the Rev. Mr. John Ramsay.</head> 

<p>

Name, Surface, Soil, &amp;c. 

THE etymology of Kirkmichael, (the church dedicated to 
St Michael), is obvious. The furface of the parifh is 
hilly, and, towards the fouth and eaft, mountainous and 
rocky ; moftly green, and of a clay foil, inclining to loam ra- 
ther than to ftrong clay, upon a tilly bottom. There are a 
few patches of light gravellifh foil, in the form of conical hills; 
and, on the banks of the rivers and burns, are fome flat dry 
holms. The ground is for the mod part arable, but turns 
to the beft account, where there is a judicious mixture of til- 
lage and pafture. The climate is rather variable and moift, es- 
pecially in autumn, and early in the winter. The people are 

in general healthy, nor do any particular difeafes prevail. 

The water of Girvan runs through this parifh ; and the river 
Doon bounds it for feveral miles- The latter is a confiderable 
ftream, well adapted for manufa&amp;ures, being a large body of 
pure, foft, limpid water, with many falls for machinery : by 



of Kirhnkhaeh 103 

a fluice out of Loch-Doon, out of which it iffues, the river 
can be kept under perfect command, fo as neither to exceed 
nor prove deficient in refpeft of water.— The length of the 
parifh is 9 miles, and its breadth 4. 

Minerals, Fuel, end Woods.— Freeftone is found in a few 
places, but no regular quarry has been opened. A great 
quantity of moor-ftones are fcattered up and down the furface : 
the grey granite chiefly prevails. Limeftone has been difco- 
vered in feveral places, chiefly on the fouth, where there are 
extenfive and valuable quarries of that ufeful article. No coal 
has as yet been difcovered in the parifh, though there is an 
appearance of it. The common fuel is coal, brought from 4 
to 6 miles diftance, and cofting 3s. per ton at the pit. An 
ordinary farmer will confume 12 ton in a year. On 2 or 3 
farms, peats are ufed in part. One hill is fuppofed to con- 
tain lead : fome attempts were made to bring it to light, but 
without fuccefs. Shell -marie has been dug out in a few pla- 
ces, but in no great quantities. There are immenfe ftores of 
hard marie, of various degrees of richnefs ; but, on account 
of its being flow in its operation, and not admitting of dif- 
tant carriage, it has been ufed only in the vicinity of the pit. 

It would be a valuable treafure where lime is fcarce. In the 

parifh are many natural woods, chiefly of oak, afh, birch, 
and alder, of great value to the proprietors, and very conveni- 
ent for the country. They are cut once in 40 years, though, 
if they were properly managed when young, more crops 
might be taken. 

Produce, Inclofures, and Manure — Of late, great quantities 
of good oats have been raifed ; fome bear, a few peafe, and 
little or no wheat. The culture of potatoes is well underflood, 
and great crops are produced. Hitherto lint has appeared on- 



Statiflical Account 



ly in fome patches: turnips have been tried, but with no 
great fuccefs, the foil being too wet, and the fervants have ari 
averfion to them, as they are thereby expofed to much cold 
dirty work. Many of the farms have natural meadows, and 
feveral farmers fow artificial grafTes, both for pafture and hay. 
In this remote part, hay cannot be fold to any great extent. 
About 30 years ago, the country was for the moft part unin- 
clofed : low ill paid rents, poor farmers, flarved cattle, puny 
horfes, no carts, and fcarcely a tolerable inftrument of huf- 
bandry, prevailed every where. Now the reverfe of all thefe 
is the cafe. The farms, two or three excepted, are now all 
inclofed, and fubdivided \ the hedges in many places are ex- 
cellent ftrong fences ; the work of ditching and hedging is well 
underftood, and generally well executed. A kind of ftone 
fence, called Snap-dykes, peculiar to Carrick and the north 
parts of Galloway, is admirably fitted for fheep parks ; being 
from 4 to 6 feet in height, ftrong and firmly locked together 

at the top. It cofts from 4s. to 7s. per fall of i8i feet 

Lime, as a manure, is now very common, and is ufually laid 
out on the fward, at the rate of 100 to 160 bolls of powdered 
lime, which cofts 6d. per boll at the kiln, on each acre, and 
gives a good return (from 4 to 6 quarters) after the firft year. 
Oats weigh, at an average, 36 lb. the Winchefter bufhel, and 
are the general and moft profitable crop in this part of the 
country *. 

Horfes, 

* There is a method of preferving corn, peculiar, to this part of the coun- 
try, called Rickling, thus performed : After the corn has flood fome days 
in uncovered half ftooks, from 40 to 60 fheaves are gathered together, and 
put up into a fmall flack, (the fheaves being fet up as eredl as they will flick 
together,) and covered with a large fheaf, as a hood, tied down with two fmall 
flraw ropes. It keeps corn and fodder to admiration. Scarcely any fpoilt 
grain is heard of in this country ; though the climate is fo wet, that without

Horfes, Cattle, and Sheep.— for many years pad, few hor- 
fes have been bred in this neighbourhood, the wafte being 
chiefly fupplied from -Ireland, though of late, owing to their 
increafed price, fome of the farmers have begun to rear them, 
and are well paid for their trouble, as home-bred horfes are 
more profitable, and more to be depended upon, than foreign- 
ers. Breeding cattle makes part of the bufinefs of almoft eve- 
ry farmer : they are chiefly of the Galloway kind, fhort-legged, 
long and deep in the body, broad above, without horns, har- 
dy, handfome, eafily fed, and tell well at the end of the ba- 
lance. They are high priced to their fize, but fwell incredi- 
bly when promoted to better paftures. The common breed of 
cows are not remarkable for the quantity of milk they give, 
nor is the dairy, as an article of export, much attend- 
ed to in this part of the country, though good butter for 
private ufe is made here. The manufadure of cheefe is not 
underftood. At and above 4 years old, the bullocks and cut 
queys are driven to the Englifli' market, and fetch great prices. 
Confiderable numbers of Highland and Scotch cows are fatted 
Vol. VI. O for 

this precaution, it would be difficult to preferve it at all in bad feafons. It does 
beft with (hort grafly corn, keeps the grain found, and the fodder fweet, and 
prevents heating in the (lack. 

There is a method of preferving beans, praclifed here for feveral years, al- 
ways with fuccefs. When cut, they are laid in regular handfulls, all one way, 
and fu.Tered to lie 8 or 10 days upon the ground ; then two perfons going to- 
gether, each lifts a handful, and fets it down on the root end, the one op- 
pofite to the other, fo as to be feparated at bottom, and to fupport each other 
at top. The fame operation is repeated on the open fides, till it becomes a 
round hulk, and more is added all round, till it flands firm, always taking 
care to keep the heap, open below, to give it {lability, and to allow the air to 
pafs. It is wonderful how the hulks will refill very fevere blafls ; and the pre- 
fent incumbent, in the year 1787, had two acres of beans, which flood 44 
days in the rain, without damage. When ready for flacking, they are bouncl 
with thumb ropes, and put on the carts.

for home confumption. All the black cattle, the milch-cows 
excepted, lie in the fields the whole year round, and are fed 
in winter with hay and draw. Few fheep are railed in this 
parifh : formerly every farmer had a flock which grazed pro- 
mifcuoufly with his black cattle and hdrfes. As there were 
no inclofures, and the ground overftocked, all were in pover- 
ty, and in hard feafons numbers, perifhed for want : now, 
there is plenty of food both for man and beaft. Many of the 
farmers keep a few fheep for their own ufe, but nothing like 
a flock is to be feen except on two or three farms. Swine 
have been tried, but generally given up. 

Rent. — The parifh, at a grofs computation, is fuppofed to 
contain about 10,000 acres ; 1400 of which are under tillage, 
the remainder in woods, hay, and pafture. Land lets from 
3s. to 10s. per acre, on 19 years leafes. The rents are gene- 
rally well paid. The valued rent is L. 3904 Scotch. The fta- 
tute labour is commuted at the rate of 25s. for each L. 100 of 
valued rent. 



Manufactures, Exports, and Mills.— Though there is not a 
town, and fcarcely any thing that deferves the name of a vil- 
lage, yet the parifh is not altogether without manufactures : 
feveral thoufand ells of plaiding are fpun and wove in it. In 
this article the old~women, the wives of labourers, and the 
women fervants of farmers, are occafionally employed. The 
raw undreffed plaiding brings from yd. to I2d. per ell, and 
is fold to merchants from Glafgow, at Ayr and Maybole fairs. 
For fome months paft, the woolen manufacture has been 
greatly leffened, by the weavers being employed in weaving 
muflins fent from Glafgow, the muflin being both a lighter 
and more lucrative work. The chief exports are oats, oat- 
meal, black-cattle, woolen cloth, and from one diftric"t, fome 

butter 



of Kirkmichael. 107 

butter and cheefe. A good many cattle are imported from the 
muir countries and the Highlands, kept a year, and fent to 
the Englifli markets, or fold to Scotch butchers for the con- 
fumption of the manufaauring towns. Of late, the quanti- 
ty of oats raifed, arid of oatmeal exported, has been confide- 
rable ; though formerly the inhabitants were often fupported, 
during fummer, by importations from Ireland and the north 
of Scotland. In nothing has this part of the country received 
greater improvement than in kilns and mills. Formerly the 
latter were miferable machines, at which much time was con- 
fumed, and the grain horribly abufed. Now, there are tyle 
kilns at all the mills, and at many of the farm-houfes. The 
mills have excellent machinery, conduded by fkilful tradef- 
men, and grain is manufaftured cheaply and profitably. As 
good barley can be made in this parifli, as any where in the 
kingdom. There is alfo an excellent lint-mill, which, it is hop- 
ed, will encourage the growth of flax. 

Roods This parifli is excellently accommodated with fine 
gravel roads, owing to the public fpirit of the heritors, and 
their wifely forefeeing that it would eventually promote their 
own intereft* About 20 miles of road have been made and 
fupported formany years. In 1769, the heritors agreed to 
borrow a fum to enable them to make the roads at once, and to 
take the converfion-money, before mentioned, for their re- 
payment, which was accordingly done. The benefit to the 
public has been great, and the heritors have been repaid in part, 
but not in full : if they fhould not receive full payment in fpe- 
cie, they will certainly be reimburfed by the increafe of their 
rentals. There is not a turnpike in the parifli *.

Population — It appears probable, from fevcral circumflan- 
ces, that this parifh was more populous half a century ago 
than it is at prefent. At that time, the farms were fmall, and 
abounded with inhabitants. When inclofing became general, 
about 30 years' ago, the farms were enlarged and made more 
commodious. At firft, many .of them were laid out in paf- 
ture, and committed to the management of one perfon. As 
there was lefs country work, and few or no manufactures, 
many of the old inhabitants were obliged to remove. So far 
as the parifh regilters are preferved, it appears, that there were 
more marriages and baptifms, previous to, and about that pe- 
riod, than there Jiave been ever fince ; though the 'returns to 
Dr Webfter from this diftria was only 7 10 fouls, whereas the 
total number at prefent, is,

Clean houfes, dry warm beds, and plain wholefome well-drefled food are com- 
mon here ; and, to increafe the relifli of the whole, there is generally a hear- 
ty welcome, and in many individuals alfo a fund of rational, ufeful conver-

Ecckfiajllcd State, School, *nd Poor. — M\ the inhabitants 
are of the Eftablifhed Church. , An excellent and commodi- 
ous church was built in 1787. The ftipend, including an al-

There is an eftablifhed fchoolmafter, whofe falary is a pitiful

provided for. The fchoolmaaers certainly deferve compaf- 
fion of the legiflature, and it would be difgraceful to oppofe a 

reafonable augmentation of their falaries. The poor, on 

the parifh roll, are from 16 to 20, very fcantily provided for 
on the whole, as the funds for their fupport, arifing from the 
intereft of fome mortified money, the colleaions at the church-

L. 20 and L. 30 per annum *. 

Mifcellaneous 

fation. Thefe are folid proofs of the increafing improvements of the country, 
though at the fame time it muft be owned, that what has been faid above is 
not applicable to every individual. 

* The daily wages of carpenters are is. of taylors, 7d. and of mafons, Is. 
victuals included in each cafe ; of day-labourers, from 8d. to is. in winter, 
and from iod. to I5d. in fummer. Men-fervants employed in hufbandry get 
L. 7, and women-fervants L. 3 a year, with bed, board, and warning. Wages 
of every kind have rifen one third at lead within thefe 15 years. The farm- 
ers employ two kinds of men-fervants, the one fuch as are called Cote-men, 
who are married, and live on the farm, who receive what is called a benefit, 
viz. a houfe and yard, a cow kept in grafs and fodder, 6 and one-half bolls of 
meal, liberty to plant a certain quantity of potatoes, from L. 4 to L. 6 in mo- 
ney, and a ftipulated meafure of fuel led home; worth in all from L.13 to 
L. 1 5 fterlinc. The other kind of men-fervants are unmarried lads, living in 
the farmers houfes. The wifer farmers chufe a mixture of thefe ; as the 
cote-men are fteady, and the lads active. If the wages are higher than for- 
merly, 



110 Statiflical Account 

Mifctlkneous Obfervaiiom— The people are In general fober 
and induftrious, and few have no vifible means of fubfift- 
ence. Many of the farmers are refpeaable 'intelligent men, 
who know they have a character as fuch in the country, and 
are at pains to fupport it. They are generally folicitous to 
give their children a good education ; and there is a happy 
profped* in this corner, that many of the young people will 
turn out fenfible ufeful members of the community. As to 
their religious character, there is certainly lefs apparent feri- 
oufnefs, and lefs refpeft to the external ordinances of relisrion. 
than were to be feen in former times. It is to be regretted 
that a proper refpeft to religion fhould ever be diminifhed : 
it gives ground to fufpeft that there is not a real regard to it. 
If this increafes, and becomes general, the confequences will 
be dreadful. Morals, among the bulk of mankind, will ftand 
upon a precarious foundation, as they will be without the re- 
ftraints neceffary to keep them from going aftray. 

There are only 3 public-houfes in the parifh : indeed one 
might ferve all the purpofes of refreshment. Whilky, fo pre- 
valent 

merly, much more work is done by the fame hands. Threfhing in the morn- 
ing is univerfally introduced, and winnowing at night, that the light of the 
day may be employed out of doors. Such farmers as have large quantities of 
grain, get it threfhed at iod. the boll, or Englifh quarter. 

Butcher meat of every kind, butter, cheefe, wool, and hay, are fold by the 
tron ftone of 24 lb. avoirdupoife. The meal ftone weighs 17 i-half lb, avoir- 
dupois. The old meafures for the county have generally gone into difufe, and 
the Wiuchefter bufhel is now univerfally ufed ; 8 bufhels make a boll of oats 
and barley, and 4 bufhels a boll of wheat, peafe, and beans ; the potatoe 
peck contains 8 Englifh gallons. With refpedt to oats and barley, the prefent 
meafure is confiderably better, and, as to wheat, peafe, and beans, it is 

much worfe, than formerly. Beef, mutton, veal, and pork, fell for 6s the 

flone, fowls for iod. and chickens 3d. each, butter 8d. and common cheefe 
3d. halfpenny per lb, tron; good bear, 30s. good oats, 18s. peafe and beans, 
14s the boll,

valentln many places, is not efteemed a genteel drink in this 
corner. The general beverage, of late, among the better fort 
of farmers, is good porter, which they find to afford nounfh- 
m ent as well as chearfulnefs, when moderately ufed. 

The language is a mixture of Scotch and Englifh, without 
any particular accent. In this diftria, as in every other, there 
are certain provincial words and phrafes peculiar to itfelf. It 
is probable that the Celtic was once the common language, as 
many names of places in this parifh.feem to be of that etymo- 

It mull ftrike every one, that the advantages of this panfli 
are very confiderable. There are good roads, great abundance 
of wood, lime-ftone in different places, immenfe funds of 
hard marie, and coal at no great diftance. The difadvantages 
it labours under are, the uncertainty of the climate, the une- 
qual and fteep fituation of the furface in many places, and the 
fpringinefs of the foil, the water often burfting out towards the 
bafe of the hills. This laft inconveniency may, in a great 
meafure, be remedied by draining.

By the Rev. John Steel, of Gadgirtb.</head> 


<p>
Date ef EreElion. 

CTATR was firft erefted into a parifti in 1653, for the ac- 
commodation of the noble family of Dalrymple of Stair, 

whofe refidence was a great diftance from Ochiltree, their pa- 
rifh church. With a view to this accommodation, that family 
agreed to pay three chalders of victual, one half of the ftipend 
then allotted to the minifter. The other half was to be paid 
by the parifti of Barnwell, then fupprefied and united to the 
adjoining pariflies of Craigie and Torbolton. On account 
of fome differences between the parties concerned in the 
tranfaction, and a wrong locality of the ftipend, the errors 
of the firft erection were rectified by a new procefs in 1709, 
when feveral lands were disjoined from, and others united 
to, the parifti. This new erection, though it produced a 
different locality, made no alteration in the f urn of the fti- 
pend ; which, however fmall or inadequate to the fup- 
port of a family, remains ftill unaugmented, though in fome 
years it has produced no more to the incumbent than L. 35.

Extent, 



of Stair. if 3 

Extent, Soil, Surface, fsV. — This diftrift lies between the 
rivers Air and Kill ; and is about 6 miles in length by 2 i n 
breadth, though at one place it is completely interfe&amp;ed by the 
parifh of Ochiltree. The foil, that of fome fmall vallies along 
the fides of thefe rivers excepted, is a ftiffclay. The general 
appearance of the parifh, as well as the produclivenefs of the 
foil, has been greatly improved fince the year 1735,' when the 
prefent incumbent was fettled. At that period, there was no 
fence of any kind, excepting one fmall inclofure of fir near 
Barfkimming, and fome coppices of natural wood. In fum- 
mer, the cattle were herded between the different corn fields ; 
and in winter, they ranged at large over the whole country : 
at prefent, every farm is inclofed and fubdivided ; and fo com- 
pletely have the notions of the commonality changed in this re- 
fpecl, that fcarcely any perfon will agree to take a farm, or pay 
an adequate rent, unlefs the lands are properly inclofed: although 
formerly their prejudices againft inclofures were fo violent, that 
dykes and gateways were frequently broken down as foon as 
ereded. This, the prefent incumbent had frequently the un- 
happinefs to experience when he firft began to inclofe hi* pro- 
perty in this parifh, and in that of Coylton. 

Heritors and P,W^._The heritors are 6 in number. To 
the activity, exertions, and public fpirit of the four principal 
ones, (Sir William Miller of Barfkimming, General Stuart of 
Stair, Mungo Smith of Drongan, and the incumbent), is 
chiefly to be afcribed the rapid improvement of agriculture in 
this place, and the great increafe of the value of their own 
eftates, which are now fucceffively planted with 'thriving tim- 
ber, inclofed and improved in a very elegant and judicious 
manner. The grain raifed in this parifh is, oats, bear, peafe, 
beans, and wheat ; turnips and potatoes are alfo cultivated 
.his and the neighbouring diftri&amp;s are remarkable for produ-

cing good cheefe and butter. The pra&amp;ice of laying down 
the land with artificial grafles, introduced by the incumbent in 
1737, has contributed greatly to increafe the quantity, as well 
as to improve the quality, of thefe articles of produce. To the 
fame caufe is evidently to be afcribed the improvement which 
has taken place in this diftrict, with regard to the breed of 
horfes and black-cattle. Both are incomparably better fed, 
during winter as well as fummer, fince the introduction of 
thefe graffes. Inftead of the naked paftures upon which the 
horfes were formerly driven, the greater part, even of the fmalleft 
farmers, have at prefent a fmall inclofure fown with red clover, 
which is cut twice or thrice in the feafon, and given the cat- 
tle in the intervals of work. The fame expedient has alfo 
greatly increafed the food of the milch-cows ; winter feeding, 
however, is flill defective in this neighbourhood, the foil be- 
ing too wet for turnips. The incumbent has been generally 
fuccefsful in recommending to the tenants to plant rows of 
trees around their grafs inclofures, as a fhelter and ornament 
to the fields. 

Minerals The parifh of Stair is exceedingly well fupplied 

with fuel. On the lands of Drongan is an extenfive coalliery, 
which has been wrought above a century, to the great benefit 
of Air arid the neighbourhood. On the property of the in- 
cumbent are alfo two coallieries with fire engines, which pro- 
mife a long and cheap fupply to the country of that neceflary 
article of life. In the lands of Dalmore, upon the banks of 
the river Air, is a fpecies of whetftone, well known in the 
country by the name of the Water of Air Stone : it has been 
exported to different parts of Europe and America, and has 
been found preferable to every other flone for fharpening edge 
tools. Near the fame place is alfo a quarry of black lead, fpe- 
cimens of whickhave been fent to Whitehaven ; and have been 

found 



of Stair. jge 

fbund to anfwer all the purpofes of that ufeful mineral. On 
the lands of Dalmore have been found fome ftrata of copper 
and antimony ; which, from experiments already made, pro- 
mife to be productive of thefe metals, and at fome future pe- 
riod may probably be wrought to advantage. No limeftone has 
yet been found in this parifti, though, from its abundance in 
fome part of the country not far diftant, there is a probability 
that the agriculture of the diftricl maybe ftill farther encouraged 
by the difcovery of that article. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations.—ln 1 755, the number of fouls 
in this parifh was 369, now it is ihcreafed to 5 18.— The church 
was lately repaired, and is in good order. There is no manfe 
at Stair, the prefent incumbent refiding at Gadgirth caftle, the 
feat of the family of Chalmers, to which he fucceeded in 1 748. 
When he was firfl fettled, the tenants and labourers were poor, 
ill clothed, and worfe fed ; the farm houfes were fmall, ill 
furnifhed, and mean in their appearance. Notwithftanding 
the advanced rents which they now pay, the tenants are in 
much better circumftances, and their tafte for cleanlinefs, drefs, 
and every decent accommodation, has increafed in proportion 
to their wealth. The inhabitants in their morals are fober, 
honeft, and induftrious ; and, amidft all the animofities and 
divifions which have arifen in this country, they have remained 
fteadily attached to the Eftablifhed Church. There are two 
turnpike roads in the parilh ; and three bridges over the water 
of Airs one of which was built in ,745 at a very confiderable 
expence : another of them, erected at the private coft of 
the late Sir Thomas Miller, Lord Prefident of the Seffion, 
near his houfe of Barflcimming, confifts of one arch, fpring-

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q45853">RICCARTOUN</name>. 

(county and presbytery of air, synod of 
glasgow and air.) 

By the Rev. Mr. Alexander Moody.</head> 

<p>

Name. 

"D ICCARTOUN is evidently a corruption of Richardtoun. 

It is generally fuppofed to have been fo called from a 
Sir Richard Wallace who lived in the vicinity of the village, 
and who is faid to have been uncle to the celebrated patriot, 
Sir William Wallace. Of his houfe no veftige now remains : 
the place, however, where it flood, is well known. 

Extent, Soil, and Rivers.— The parifh is 6 miles long, and 
on an average 2 miles broad. The village of Riccartoun is 
within an Englifh mile of the market place of Kilmarnock ; 
and divided from the fuburbs of the town by Irvine water. 
The foil of the parifh is, in general, a deep clay. The lands 
are all arable and well inclofed, excepting a mofs which 
may contain about 250 acres. 

# Irvine water, which runs through the parifh, has its fource 
m the panfh of Lowdon. There is alfo another fmall river, called 

the 



1 1 3 Stat ijlical Account 

the water of Ceflhock, which runs through part of the parifh, 
and, in one place, forms the boundary betwixt it and Galfton. 
Irvine-water produces excellent trouts. Sometimes falmon are 
catched in it. 

There is nothing peculiar in the climate of this parifli. It 
is fubjecT:, along with the other parishes on the weft coaft of 
Scotland, to frequent falls of rain. The weather is thus, at 
times, very variable •, the inhabitants, neverthdefs, enjoy a 
good ftate of health : nor are there any difeafes peculiar to the 
parifli. Although there be not many inftances of people ar- 
riving at a very great age, yet not a few reach their 6oth and 
70th year. 

Population. — When the returns were made to Dr. Webfter, 
the number of inhabitants in the parifli amounted to 745 : they 
are now increafed to 1000. The increafe has taken place in 
the village. — There has been no regifter of burials kept in the 
parifh for many years paft : the annual average of births for 5 
years preceding 1792, was 38 j and of marriages, n *. 

Rent. — The valued rent is L. 4000 Scotch. The real rent 
will amount to upwards of L. 4000 fterling per annum. Farms 
let from 15 s. to 30s. per acre, and contain from 60 to 150 a- 
cres each. — There are 8 large proprietors of lands in the pa- 
rifli, with a few fmaller ones. Of the greater proprietors, 3 
either conftantly or occafionally, refide in the parifli. 

Ecclefiajlical 

* Men fcrvants wages are from L. 6 to L. ?, per annum. Women fervants 
■wages from L. 3 to L. 4. Day labourers receive 14c!. in fummer, and is. in 
•winter, without their meat. Taylors now receive od. a day, with their victu- 
als, which is more than double what they got about 20 years ago. Carpen- 
ters and mafons have ufually aod. a day. 



of Riccartoun. 2I p 

Ecckftajlical State, Poor, and School '. — There are very few 
Seceders, and no Roman Catholics in the parifh. Before the 
year 1648, there was only one minifter for the parifhes of Ric- 
cartoun and Craigie. A disjunction of the parifhes was then 
made, and a minifter fettled in each. The church of Riccar- 
toun was almoft wholly rebuilt in the year 1772, and is in to- 
lerably good repair. The manfe was lately rebuilt. The pa- 
tron of the parifti is Sir William Cuningham of Caprington, 
Bart. The ftipend is 5 chalders of victual, meal and bear, 
L. 340 Scotch in money, with a glebe containing 8 acres of a- 
rable land. 

The poor in this parifh are, at prefent, but flenderly fup- 
ported. Almoft the only fund for maintaining them arifes 
from the voluntary contributions of the people at church. A 
confiderable fum of money which belonged to them was, fome 
years ago, loft by the failure of a mercantile company. The 
number of poor is fortunately not great. There are only at 
prefent upon the roll 15 perfons, none of whom are permitted 
to beg. About L. 24 may be yearly collected. 

The fchool here is very well attended. The people are, in 
general, defirous to give their children all the education which 
their circumftances will permit. The encouragement how- 
ever, is not great, the falary being only 100 merks. The wa- 
ges are for teaching Englifh is. 6d. for writing, 2s. and for 
arithmetic, 2s. 6d. per quarter. 

Crops.— 'The principal crops raifed in the parifh are oats and 
bear : the farmers find from experience that the foil is much 
more favourable for producing oats. Till within thefe feu- 
years little or no wheat was fown in the parifh ; a confiderable 
number of acres are now, however, fown yearly with wheat, 
which, when the ground is well prepared, fucceeds very well. 
The ufeful practice of furnmer«fallowing is much more com- 



mon

mon than it was fome years ago. Peafe and beans are alfo 
(own, and fometimes prove a very profitable crop. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervat'ions. — At the village there is a mount 
of confiderable bulk, the greater part of which appears to be 
artificial. On this, as on many others of the fame kind, our an- 
ceftors met for diflributing juftice. The people are in gene- 
ral fober and induftrious. The tradefmen in the parifli are, with 

a few exceptions, either fhoemakers or weavers. This dif- 

tri£r. enjoys many natural advantages. Limeftone is found in 
great quantities. The parifli is alfo well fupplied with coal at 
a.reafonable price. The coal belonging to Sir William Cun- 
ingham of Caprington, is juftly efteemed the beft in Ayrfhire. 
Great quantities of blind-coal have of late been raifed in the 
parifli ; carried by land to Irvine, and thence exported to Ire- 
land. It was propofed, fome years ago, to dig a canal from 
Riccartoun bridge to join the fea at the Troon ; and it is to be 
wiflied that this fcheme could be revived and carried into exe- 
cution, as the benefits which would arife from It, particularly 
to the proprietors of coal, would be very great.

crops of grain and grafs, the toil and expence of the hufband- 
man. Large tracts of inferior quality have been improved to 
good account by lime and water ; but tracts, flill more extenfive, 
of a light moorifh foil, being denied by nature a proper degree 
of the vegetative principle, or having been reduced, by paring 
and burning, to flerility, cannot be reclaimed on a fhort leafe to 
any advantage. It requires no lefs than 80 bolls of lime to fti- 
mulate an acre of new foil. 

Notwithstanding the extent of mofiy and fwampy ground, 
the air of Montquhitter parifh is pure and healthful. Thefe 
fogs, called Mildews, though pregnant with mineral exhala- 
tions, feem to be more pernicious to the vegetable than to the 
animal tribes. The chin-cough, mealies, and fmall-pox, re- 
turn periodically ; but the virulence of thefe diforders is now 
greatly lefiened by judicious management. Rheumatifm, con- 
fumption, and fever, are the difeafes which moft frequently 
prevail : but, perhaps, no parifh in the ifland can be pointed 
out where health and longevity are more generally found. 

Rivers, Minerals, Cattle, tsfc— Montquhitter parifh is wa- 
tered by two fmall rivers, which receive the tribute of number- 
lefs and copious fprings.. One of thefe difcharges itfelf into 
the Ythan : and the other, after affuming various names as it 
paffes along, difcharges itfelf, near Turriff, into the Doveran. 
Thefe abound with delicious fmall trout of the common kind. 
During fpring and autumn large trout, of a red colour, pay 
us a vifit ; but, when thefe ftrangers have obeyed the impulfe 
of the feafon, they again return to the nobler ftreams. The 
trout, however, being much injured by the net, by the parti- 
cles of lime warned from our fields, and by the effence of fteep- 
cd flax, are daily decreafing in number. 

' Below a ftratum of pebbly clay, extenfive quarries of red 
freeftone lie in the direction of a plane, much inclined from

E. to "W. This ftone, though much impregnated with iron ore, 
rifes in large maffes, and is very fit for building. 

The cattle formerly reared in Montquhitter parifh were ge- 
nerally fmall fized, though well fhaped and hardy, until a fu- 
perior breed was introduced by the late Mr Cumine of Auch- 
ry, to Whom this parifh juftly attributes its principal improve- 
ments. Prior to this sera, cows, that yielded 4 pints of milk 
in the day, were thought pretty good ; few male calves were 
reared ; and the farmer generally bought his oxen (whereof 12 
were commonly yoked in one plough) when young, in diftant 
markets, and fold them,, when old, at great difcount. Now, 
cows give from 6 to 13 pints of milk in the day; male calves 
are carefully reared ; and our farmers frequently fupply, with 
labouring cattle, thofe diftricls from which their fathers pur- 
chafed their numerous and expenfive fets. Cows, according 
to their weight and quality, fell from 4 to 8 guineas each, and 
oxen fell from 5 to ! o guineas each : fome oxen and cows far 
exceed thefe prices *. 

Qj* Population. 

* This parifh can boaft of one cave only, the work of art, employed for a 
purpofe inimical to fociety, and now deftroyed. Towards the clofe of laft 
century, two young men, whofe connections and refidence were entirely un- 
known, appeared at every public meeting. A country man, who obferved 
fmoke rifing from a bank of mofs in a wild hollow, marked the place, and 
conveened the neighbours, who difcovered the mouth of a cave. In the cave 
they found an old woman, who declared that Ihe and her two fons had lived 
there for fome years ;— that her fons had always fupplied her with provifions 
of every kind ;— but that /he was prevented by various motives from men- 
tioning why Ihe and they had fettled in fo clandertine a manner, and in fo fo- 
litaryaplacc. The woman thereafter lived and died in Montquhitter parifh; 

but her fons, when their lurking-place was difcovered, left the country. . 

rome people having been purfued near that hollow, and others, who were 
known to have money upon them, having unaccountably difappeared, it was 
fuppofed, that the Glanders (the rfame which the two young men aflumed) 
had lived by theft and robbery, wherewith they fcmpled not to aflbciate that

fell fhortof 800 ; but, fince that time, population has rapidly 
increafed, partly by the practice of dividing large farms in or-

The rage of emigration never agitates the bofoms of the 

people, and every hovel boafts a fuitable inhabitant 

Strangers, upon fettling here, find themfelves much at home, 
and thofe who have been born in the parifh are fondly attached 
to their native foil. '* How can I live," faid a poor fellow, 
not deftitute of genius, who had wandered to Edinburgh in 
fearch of bufinefs, " oh ! how can I live, out of the fight of 
" the bonny parks of Auchry ?" To the bonny parks of 
Auchry his predominant paffion obliged him to return, and he 
is now active in encreafing the population by a numerous fa- 
mily. 

Appearance and Char after of the People  &amp;c. — The people 
are generally middle fized, raw boned, finewy, and not a lit- 
tle diftinguifhed by the characteriftic feature of Scotland. Few 
exceed 6 feet in height, almoft none are below 5 feet 5 inches. 
The men, for the moft part acute, fagacious, fober, induf- 
trious, are now educated in a ftyle fuperior to their ftation. 
Very few chufe the fea-faring or military line ; but thofe who 
do, are efteemed for fteadinefs and bravery. The women are 
well fhaped, active, and trained to manufacture from child- 
hood. The Norman blood (till flames on the heads of fome ; 
not a few are adorned by fair and yellow locks; but, in general, 
the animated countenance is fhaded by black or by dufky hair. 

Although no capital branch of manufacture is eftablifhed in 
the parifh, yet manufacture is greatly advanced by the labours 
of the people. Linen yarn is fpun for the merchant almoft in 
every family. Some thoufand pairs of cargo hofe, at 1 s. per 
pair, are annually fent to market. Fine wool, given out by 
the manufacturers of Aberdeen, is fpun and knit into {lock- 
ings. A few make woolen and linen cloth for fale : and a nu- 
merous clafs of weavers are well employed. 

A very great change, as to diet and drefs, has taken place 

during

during the 40 years laft part. Prior to that aera, neither tea- 
kettle nor tea could be found but in two families. Two hats 
only appeared at church. A lady adorned herfelf with the 
plaid ; and a gentleman was not afhamed of home fpun cloth. 
— — But now, moft families drink tea once, and many twice 
a-day. The farmer, merchant, and tradefman, enjoy in a mo- 
derate degree the comforts and accommodations of life. The 
ploughman turns out to church and market with his hat, good 
linen, and broad-cloth; and, it may be taken for granted, 
that the country belles will exert themfelves to outfhine the 
country beaus *.

* The price of provifions is greatly affected by the ftile of living. 40 years 
ago, beef fold from id. to 2d. per lb. a hen or duck for 2d. halfpenny, 14 
eggs for id. a fheep for as. a ftone of cheefe at 24 oz. per lb. for 3s. 4d. and 

a ftone of butter for 6s. 8d. But now beef, mutton, lamb and veal, in 

their refpeftive feafons, fell from 2d. halfpenny to 3d. halfpenny per lb.— a 
duck or hen is valued from 6d. to 9d. — a ftone of cheefe is worth from 3s. 6d. 
to 5s. 6d. and of butter from 8s. to 13s. 4d. — and the demand from London 
eftimates 12 eggs at ad. or 3d. Our butter, which is very good, is prefently 
' in requeft ; and I hope our country dealers will, for their own fakes, pay due 
attention to the curing of this valuable neceflary. 

A day-labourer, according to his merit and the feafon, draws from 5d. to 
9d. per day. When he works by the piece he may clear from 9d. to is. The 
wright claims is. the mafon, is. 4h and the taylor, fd. and his meat, per 
day ; but moft tradefmen work by the piece. The wages of hired fervants are 
rapidly increafing. A growing lad claims, along with his food, L. 3 : 10, or 
L.4 : 10 ; a grown man from L. 4 : 10 to L. 6 : 10 ; a maid-fervant from L. 2 : 2 
to L. 2 : 15 in the year. Formerly a maid-fervant or lad was well fatisned with 
L. I, and a capable man-fervant with L. 1 : 13 : 4. per ann. At that time the 
price of every other fervice was proportionally low. 

The maintenance of a tradefman's or of a day-labourer's family does not 
entirely depend on what he himfelf gains ; for if his wife and children are in- 
duftrious, they mare the merit of furnifhing fubfiftence. When a day-labour- 
er or tradefman rents a croft, his wife commonly pays landlord and merchant, 
fey the produce of her cows, and by manufafture 5 and leaves it for the huf- 

band, 



of Montquhitter. 12^ 

Stipend and Poor's Funds. — The church was built in 1764, 
and the manfe in 1778. The ftipend was lately augmented to 
L. 61 fterling in money, 34 bolls of meal, and 16 bolls of bear. 
The glebe contains 12 acres, much improved by the prefent 
incumbent. Francis Garden of Dalgety, is patron. 

The poor of the parifh fluctuates in number. At prefent 30 
perfons claim a fupply, and, according to their refpective ne- 
ceffities, receive from 10s. to 40s. each, per annum. This 
fmall fupply, in conjunction with their own induftry, and the 
charity of neighbours, affords the fober fupport of life. A 
poor man, with a numerous family, often receives a prefent j 
and the dead of the indigent are buried at the public expence. 
The ftock of the poor, exclufive of L. 11 mortified for a parti- 
cular purpofe, amounts to L. 1 20. Some time ago, the an- 
nual collections produced L. 12, but now produce L. 30 a year. 
During laft century, the annual collections feldom amounted 
to, and never exceeded, L. 3 : 10 fterling. 

Progrefs of Improvement. — The parifh can boaft but of few 
perfons diflinguifhed for learning, but many eminent for 
valuable qualifications have been produced here, at the head 
of whom Hands Jofeph Cumine, late of Auchry. Nature had 
endowed Mr Cumine with an active and vigorous mind. Cool, 
fagacious, penetrating, he connected a found judgement and 

correct 

band, by thefale of cattle, and by his work, to furnifli bread. During the 
infancy and childhood of their family, parents of thefe clafles are generally 
poor, but gradually rife to eafy circumftances, as their children become capa- 
ble of relieving the hand, and aflifting in the induftry of the mother. By old 
age, or the contingencies of life, fome are obliged to appeal to the gratitude 
of their children, or to the charity of the public. But it refleds honour on 
the genius of the people, that nothing but the hard hand of neceffity can ob- 
lige them to adopt this laft expedient.

correal tafte, with unfhaken refolution and unwearied applica- 
tion. Slow, but fure in planning, he was prompt and ardent 
in executing his defigns. When he afiumed the management 
of his eftate, in 1739, it yielded L. 150 fterling of rent, of 
which he could only call L. 60 his own. The heath extended 
to the back of his houfe : in front, an exhaufted mofs and a 
mcrafs, fed by the water of Auchry, offended the eye : and 
the whole of his farm, deflitute of a garden, confifted of a 
few acres dignified with the title of Place Croft. He gradual- 
ly banifhed the heath reduced the river to a regular channel ; 
—converted the morafs, when drained, into a neat garden 
and inclofures •,— and, at various times, took from the adjoin- 
ing lands 200 acres, which he converted into an elegant farm, 
inclofed and fubdivided ; where the ufeful and the pleafant, 
blended by the hand of a fnafter, command the refped of the 
critic, and excite the delight of the traveller. He accompa- 
nied his other improvements by a fuperior breed of cattle, 
whereof, by judicious management,he greatly encreafed the fize 
and the value. 

As his eftate was extremely well accommodated with 
mofs, he gradually fubdivided large farms. He ftriftly pro- 
hibited the abfurd praaice of paring and burning the molly 
foils : he made trafts, to improve by water thefe fields that 
could be commanded by it i he bound his tenants to drive an- 
nually from quarries, 7 Scotch miles diftant, a prefcribed 
quantity of limeftone, which he taught them to break, burn 
and apply: he obliged them to few a certain proportion of 
their land with turnip, flax, and grafs feeds : he encouraged 
them to rear their own cattle, inftead of wafting their money 
in buying expenfive fets : he frequently walked or rode through 
his eftate, freely converfing with his tenants, roufing them to 
induftry by motives, fuited to their refpedive tempers and 
particularly diftinguifhing the fagacious andadive: and by

the united energy of popular virtues and folid fenfe, he tri- 
umphed over every oppofition from foil, climate, and preju- 
dice, gradually introducing the principles of rational farming, 
and laying the foundation of progreffive improvement. 

Obferving that his tenants were frequently at a lofs for a 
market, he determined to eftablifh a permanent one on his 
own eftate. For this purpofe, he planned a regular village, 
contiguous to the church, upon the moorifh part of a farm, 
which in whole yielded only L. 1 1 a year. For a while, he 
felt in filence the fneers of his neighbours, who reprobated 
this fcheme as wild and impracticable ; but thefe temporary 
fneers foon gave way to lading efteem. He prevailed on a few 
to take feus : he affifted the induftrious with money ; — obtain- 
ed premiums for the manufacturer decided every difference 
by his arbitration,— and animated all to their utmoft exertion, 
by his countenance and counfel. Settlers annually flocked to 
Cumineflown, (the name affigned to the chief of the clan), 
and the village, built of freeftone, foon afTumed a flourifhing 
appearance. In connection with fome neighbouring gentle- 
men, he eftablifhed in his village a linen manufacture ; and 
though, for particular reafons, the fcheme was dropt, yet, by 
introducing the fpinningof linen yarn, and fixing the refidence 
of fome capable weavers, its confequences continue to operate 
for the public good. In fhort, a feries of fenfible manage- 
ment fixed upon Montquhitter 75 feus, occupied by a fet of 
honeft, induftrious, and adive feuars and their tenants, who, 
inftead of L. 1 1 fterling, the original rent, produced him an- 
nually from L. iao to L. 150 a year. Mr Cumine, during 
hfe, was an objeft of general efteem ; and, at his death, 
had the pleafure of leaving to his heirs an annual revenue of 
more than L. 600.

rent of Montquhitter parifh is dated at 325 bolls of meal, and 
about L. 210 fterling of money: at prefent, every item in- 
cluded, it extends to L. 1400 a year. Infield lets from 8s. to 
15s. light land from 2s. 6d. to 8s. and land by the fide of rivu- 
lets from 4s. to 1 os per acre. Large traces, almoft on every 
farm, are not valued. At an average, farmers pay from L.io 
to L- 30, and crofters from L. 2 to L. 10 per annum. Crofts 
are flowly diminifhing, two or more being fometimes fet to 
one tenant at a rifing rent.— Moll farmers fence, with dyke 
and ditch, a fmall fpot contiguous to their houfes : but neither 
the ftrength of their purfes, nor the length of their leafes, af- 
ford a fufficient temptation to rear a hedge, or to enclofe with 
{tones. Auchry's farm excepted, the reft of the parifh is 
naked and open. Leafes are feldom or ever extended beyond 
19 years ; in which period, no man can eftabliih a plan of ra- 
tional farming, and realize the profits. For the mod part, 
therefore, an exhausted farm devolves on an exhaufted tenant, 
whereby improvement of every kind is greatly retarded, and 
the intereft of all concerned materially injured. A few pro- 
prietors now let their lands on a liferent : flattered with the 
hope of life, the tenant exerts himfelf to reclaim and improve ; 
•—he dies, and his family lies at the mercy of a felfifh maf- 
ter. 

A number of fervices are exaaed, but not rigoroufly, by 
the proprietors, who would gladly commute them if the farmer 
inclined ; but the preceding article may fully infpire the belief, 
that a man, who is not ' fufficiently encouraged to improve, 
will be too much difpofed to fave a little money at the expence 
of fervice, Earl Fife has entirely emancipated his tenants ; 
and Mr Gordon of Letterfourie pays, at the ufual rates, for 
what fervices he requires from his people in Afleed, 

Thefe political evils, united with a cold foil impregnated 
with mineral, are not fufficient, however, to counterbalance 

the 



of Montquhitter, 



the efforts of induftry, and a variety of local advantages. A- 
mong the local advantages, a diftinguifhed place muft be given 
to abundance of mofs and water ; by the fenfible application 
of which, the value of land has rapidly encreafed,— population 
is doubled,— a thriving village has been eftablifhed, — and the 
fphere of manufacture is daily enlarged. 

Confidering the fcanty ftocks which the farmers enjoy, a- 
griculture has made, and is ftill making, rapid advances. Ma- 
ny fields difplay rich crops and grafs. Potatoes, cabbage, and 
turnip, fufficient for the kitchens and the cattle, are raifed ; 
and almoft every family fows a certain quantity of lint-feed, 
the produce of which is prepared for ufe at the rate of 2S. per 
ftone, at a lint mill, ere£ted by the late Auchry. Bear, oats, 
and peafe, are the only kinds of grain which the farmer culti- 
vates ; and the harvefts, which vary with the feafon, common- 
ly conclude about the 1 6th of O&amp;obeV. Though not i acre 
in 10 admits of tillage, yet, in favourable feafons, both meal 
and grain are exported. In indifferent feafons, the parifh ful- 
ly fupplies itfelf ; but in bad years, the wants of the inhabi- 
tants muft be relieved by the produce of more early and fertile 
foils  

R 2 During 



* Prior to the year 17)5, corn long of ripening was liable to be frofted. — 
Since that period the parifti has been more or lefs diftreffed by the effects of 
the mildew. About the beginning or middle of Anguft, the oat plant (for 
the barley fuffers not) afiumes a firey red colour ; black fpots then burft forth 
towards the root, and, according to the feafon, gradually or rapidly afcend, till 
they reach thefe fibres that fupport the ear. From that moment the circula- 
tion in the plant ceafes ; the grain ripens no more, and in proportion to the 
virulence of the difeafe, yields a fmaller or greater quantity of meal, or becomes 
a heap of defperate forrow. Various theories have been advanced to account 
for this phenomenon,— by the operation of infects,— by mineral exhalations, 
by the cauftic quality of lime ufed in manure,— and by a fituation too confined. 
Certain it is, that fome indofurcs, comprehending from 6 to 10 acres each,

During the feuds that raged in the leading families, and 
particularly in that fatal contention that called forth the potent 

and 

and furrounded with hedges and belts of wood, have fuffered moft feverely. — 
In the year 1789, however, this vegetable difeafe occupied a larger fphere, 
and diffufed its baneful influence on fields which enjoy every advantage that 
the fun and air of this climate can beftow. 

Ip feafons of fcarcity this parifh has always fuffered. — The tales told of the 
feven dear years, as they are emphatically termed, which concluded laft cen- 
tury, are indeed tales of woe. Some of thefe feafons were not entirely un- 
friendly to vegetation, if the farmer had been provided, which he was not, 
with healthy feed to beftow on his fields. The province of Murray, and fome 
of the beft land along the eaft coaft of Buchan and Formartine abounded with 
feed and bread ; but moft of the inhabitants of this parifh, reduced to mifery, 
had neither money to purchafe, nor horfes to carry thefe effential articles. A 
few facts will illuftrate their extreme diftrefs. From the time that famine 
was felt, to the time that plenty returned, oatmeal fold for L. 16 Sc. per 
boll, and all the victual ftipend, due for 7 years by the heritors, was paid for, 
with intereft, at that rate. One Thompfon, wadfetter of Hairmofs, driven 
from his home by want, was found dead, near the fhore, with a piece of raw 
flefh in his mouth. Of 16 families that refided on the farm of Littertie, 13 
were extinguilhed. On the eftate of Greens, which prefently accommodates 
169 individuals, 3 families (the proprietor's included) only furvived. The 
extenfive farms of Touchar, Greenefs, Overhill, and Burnfide of Idoch, now 
containing more than 100 fouls, together with fome farms on the parifh of 
Turriff, being entirely defolated, were converted into a fheep-walk by the Er- 
rol family, to whom they then belonged. The inhabitants of the parifh in 
general were diminifhed by death to one half, or as fome affirm, to one fourth 
of the preceding number. When the means of faving the living and of bury- 
ing the dead began to fail, natural affection was in a great meafure fufpended. 
A fellow, George Allan, having carried his deceafed father upon his back, 
half way from his home to the church-yard, threw down the corpfe at the 
door of a farmer, with thefe words : " I can carry my father no farther. For 
" God's fake bury his body : But if you chufe not to take that trouble, you 
" may place it, if you pleafe, on the dyke of your kail-yard, as a guard a- 
" gainft the fheep !" 

Until the year 1709, many farms were wafte. About that time, the heri- 
tors enticed fome fubftantial men, by the gift of a yoke of oxen, and by

and hoftile factions of Bruce and Curnine, trees were almoft 
extirpated in Buchan. As this parifh is comparatively level, 

and 

moderate rents, to fettle on their eftates ; or advanced, on what was called 
Steelbow, a cover on their farms to fpirited and enterprifing people, who, it 
was hoped, would gradually repay them. A ray of improvement burft from 
thefe gloomy fcafons. One Morrifon, driven from his home by famine, lived 
for fome years in Ireland, but returned to his country with the good feafons, 
and brought along with him a few' potatoes, which he taught the neighbour- 
ing gentlemen to cultivate. 

Another feafon of fcarcity, occafioned by deep and untimely fnow, occurs 
in the year 1740. True, indeed, oat-meal rofe not above 13s. 4d. per boll; 
but as there was no manufacture eftablifhed in the country, and no work for 
the day-labourer, the utmofl mifery, though it fell fhort of death, was generally 
felt by the labouring poor. Many offered, but in vain, to ferve for bread ; 
and Mr Duff of Hatton, who was then building, found a number of flout 
men, who thankfully accepted two pence each per day in full for their 
work. 

When the jera of induftry and improvement commenced, it was fondly 

hoped that the wants known to our fathers would never be known by us. ■ 

" Our fields and gardens, faid we, produce a variety of provifion, which will 
" infallibly preferve us from (carving, even though our corn fliould fail. Cat- 
" tie and manufactures will furnifh money, and commerce will readily ex- 
" change our money for bread. How little, therefore, have we to fear, let 
" the feafons be as unfavourable as they may ?" Thus the people reafoned : 
but to their reafoning the year 1782 gave the lie direct. The coldnefs and 
ftorminefs of fummer 178a excited fears in the minds of the difcerning; but 
none fufpected the magnitude of the impending evil. On the 5th of October, 
when oats and barley were generally green, a frofl, armed almoft with the ri- 
gour of a Greenland climate, defolated in one night the hope of the hufband- 
man. The grain, immediately contracting a hoary whitcnefs, ripened no 
more. The potatoe and turnip, dwarfilh from the feverity of the preceding 
feafon, were extremely damaged. The produce of the garden was deflitute 
of its ufual nourimment. The fields yielded not one-third of an ordinaiy 
«op. Oatmeal, dark in colour, was acid and difagreeable to the tafte. No 
market appeared whereat we could fupply our urgent wants. Complete and 
hopclefs ruin flared us in the face ; and all ranks indulged the views of gloomy 
defpondencc. If, at this critical period, the American war had not ceafed,—

and bounded on three fides by the fea, molt fituations admit not 
the culture of trees ; and but few, extremely well fheltered, 
are found to bring them to maturity. Proprietors of land are 
doing a good deal in the planting line ; and the Scotch 
fir, the pine, the larix, the afh, the elm, the plane, and the 
lime, hold the chief rank in their plantations. But though 
trees have long ceafed to be a fpontaneous production, and 
though they require the utmoft attention in rearing, yet the 
molTes abound with large logs of fir, and of venerable oak. 

When improvement commenced, the number of fheep di- 
minifhed. A tafte for them, however, begins to revive, and 
there are now in the parifh above 1300 \ of which 200 are an- 
nually 

if the copious magazines, particularly of peafe, provided for the navy, had 
not been brought to fale, — what a dire fcene of defolation and horror would 
have been exhibited in this country ! — From thefe magazines, the exertion of 
heritors and people derived regular fupplies. Cattle fold extremely well. By 
the divine bleffing, health in an eminent degree prevailed. The efforts of in- 
duflry were redoubled. Many a precious hoard of gold and filver was unlock- 
ed ; and temperance, ftern, but friendly, eftablifhed her reign on the folid 
bafe of neceflity. Though oatmeal, therefore, fold from 18s. to 22s. per boll, 
and peafe-meal from 16s. to 18s. yet the efTentials of life, though fparingly, 
■were provided, fo that not one victim of famine fell in this parifh. At 
this gloomy period, charity was awake : The minifter of Montquhitter re- 
ceived, under cover from an unknown hand, L. 20 fterling for the benefit of 
the poor. The coat of arms on the feal was juftly infcribed with this motto, 
« Jujii ut ftiera fulgent ." 

It deferves notice, that the crops from 1783 were greatly blafled by bad feed: 
The feed, which was purchafed from thefe early fpots of inland country, where 
the oat was almoft, if not altogether, ripened before the 5th of Oftober 1782, 
generally failed ; whereas the feed of this parifh, which, on that fatal day, was 
fcarce advanced beyond a watery or fluid milky fubftance, but which the ne- 
cefllties of fome obliged them to adventure, laid the foundation of a tolerable 
crop. The reafon feems to have been, that the germ of all the grain, nearly 
ripened, was materially injured, unlefs where the rigour of that memorable froft 
was foftcned by the vicinity of the fea.

nuallyfold. The number of black-cattle exceeds 1350; of 
which the drover annually purchafes 300. — 290 horfes are em, 
ployed in farming bufinefs, whereof not above one-half are 
reared in the parifh, the market furnifhing the reft. The far- 
mers commonly employ 263 carts and 85 ploughs ; and the 
ploughs are generally of the light Scotch, or common Englifh 
kind. 

Mifcellaneous Remarks. Peat is the fuel made ufe of in 

the parifh, and of it there is great abundance, and of the beft 
quality. It is to be regretted, however, that much time and 
labour are loft in providing this necefiary of life. Genteel fa- 
milies begin to ufe coal in their rooms, a practice which would 
profitably prevail if the impolitic duty on coal was abolifh- 
ed.— — -The roads, tolerably good, were originally formed, 
and are ftill repaired by ftatute labour, which may be convert- 
ed at the rate of is. 6d. per annum- The rivulets are paffable 
at all feafons, by means of bridges, erected at the expence of 
the parifh or diftri£t. As there is no poft road, the expence 

of turnpikes would be ufelefs and intolerable. The names 

of all the farms, that have not been anglified to fuit with mo- 
dern fubdivilions, evidently originate from the Celtic:—* 
e. g. Montquhiiter, or, the Place for enfnaring the Deer; 
duchry the Red 01 the King's Haugh ; Balthangie, Angus- 
town, &amp;c. 

The wild heath feems to wave over the grave of many a 
long forgotten hero, on thefe fields where contending ba- 
rons tried the keennefs of their fwords. Some of the Cove- 
nanters, cut off by the Ogilvies, have given a name (e. g.

fought at Lendrum for three days againft the forces of the 
North, commanded by the potent Thane of Buchan, whofe 
principal inland refidence was at Caftletown, King Edward 
parifh, about 4 miles diftant from the bloody fcene. The 
battle of firft day was fought about a mile to the eaft of Len- 
drum, where a number of fmall tumuli mark the graves of 
the flain j and from whence, Donald was beat back to the 
camp, the fituation of which, called Donald's fold, is ftill 
fhown. The battle of the fecond day was fought hard by the 
camp of Donald ; and there, more than an acre of land is 
crowded with large tumuli. The third, and decifive battle, 
was fought to the weft of Lendrum, upon a field of more 
than 6 acres, which tradition covers with gore. The Thane 
of Buchan, at the head no doubt of the Canmore faction, 
prevailed ; and the ufurper Donald, after lofing moft of his 

forces, was obliged to fly. -In the beginning of the pre- 

fent century, a tenant found in fome of thefe tumuli, fome 
pieces of iron, which his greedy fpirit converted to ufe. The 
prefent tenant broke up fome of them, but found nothing 

that deferves notice. Perhaps it may be amufing to trace 

the influence, which fuperftition ftill has on many minds, 
and to mark how much fome prophecies tend to their own 
completion. — The corn growing on the bloody butts of Len- 
drum has never been reaped without blood or ftrife among 
the reapers. This circumftance, aflerted by tradition, and 
confirmed by the living evidence of two refpe&amp;able men, who 

have 



of Montquhitter. , ^ y 

have rented that farm for more than half a century paft, may 
be eafily accounted for by the trepidation, or the furor, which, 
according to the refpeftive conftitutions of the reapers, is in- 
fpired by this awful fcene.

Name, Extent, &amp;c. 
YRIE, theantient and modern name of this parifli, fig- 
nifies in the Celtic language, the King's Houfe. This 
name, perhaps, is derived from a religions houfe, that (as tra- 
dition gives out) once ftood upon the ground which the manfe 
now occupies, and was well endowed by royal munificence. 
It is about 7 computed miles long, and 3 broad, and for- 
merly was much more extenfive. The form is not unlike a 

boot ; but the leg is rather long, in proportion to the foot.— 
The furface is very agreeably diverfified with hill and dale, 
heath, mofs, meadows, corn and grafs fields, running dreams, 
and inclofures fenced with ftone and turf walls Sir Willi- 
am Forbes of Pitfligo, Bart, has feveral inclofures, planted 
with fir, aih, elms, &amp;c. and Meffrs. Forbes of Upper-Boynd- 

He, and Irvine of Boyndlie, have likewife fome planting. 

The trees are generally thriving well, and after fome years,

will beautify the country, be of great value to the proprietors, 
and afford wood for building and hufbandry. 

Fevers and rheumatifm are the moft prevalent diflempers, 
and are moft common after wet harvefts, when the corns 
are not got in in good condition. The latter is much attri- 
buted to the difufe of wearing flannel next the fkin, and to the 
too great ufe of potatoes* 

There are feveral excellent mineral fprings, which are of 
confiderable fervice in weaknefles of the ftomach, when net 
drunk in too large quantities ; and the Mourning Well, in 
the den of Boyndlie, is fuch a copious fpring, as perhaps can- 
not be equalled hi all the county. The water of Tyrie runs a- 
long the north end of the parifh, over which a good ftone 

bridge is built. — The Goner, another confiderable, andj 

in many places, a beautiful, fmooth- flowing rivulet, runs al- 
moft through the middle of the parifh ; over which an excel- 
lent ftone bridge has lately been built at Tillenamolt, at the 

expence of Sir William Forbes the proprietor. Here al- 

fo, there is one Of the moft confiderable, and beft furnifhed 
water-mills in Buchan : and a fine road lately made through a 
deep and extenfive mofs, fhews what a public-fpirited land- 
lord can do, for promoting the induftry, profperity, and hap- 
pinefs of the country. Both thefe rivulets produce very deli- 
cious trouts and fome* in the latter, are 13 inches long. 
—Though their numbers be now greatly diminished by the 
ufe of lime as a manure, and the fteepingof flax in the adjoin- 
ing pools, yet anglers ftill fifh with tolerable fuccefs. 

The foil, when not in the vicinity of mofs, is, for the moft 
part, of a fertile reddifh colour, pretty deep in the rallies, but 
flialloweras the ground rifesto an eminence ; and many hun- 
dred acres of ground, very capable of improvement, are ftill 

in their natural uncultivated flare The.arr is open, and

large pools of ftagnating water ; and the fmoke of kelp*kilns, 
though very difagreeable to thofe who live in places nearer the 
fea, is fcarcely felt in this parifh.

Villages and Manufaftures. A. village is begun at New 

Pkfligo, which, if proper inducements be held out, may pro.

bably in a few years, under the aufpices of its patriotic and 
benevolent landlord, rival the moll flourifhing villages in 
Buchan. Above L. 1000 fterling has been expended upon a 
bleachfield, which is furnifhed with excellent machinery, and 
every neccflary convenience. From 13,902 to 15,733 yards 
of cloth, andfrom 514 to 564 fpindles of yarn, have been an- 
nually bleached here. The tackfman pays L. 30 per ann. for 
that field, is capable and attentive, but has no capital. A 
bleaching company, with a competent capital, might do great 
things. As new Pitfligo is about 5 miles from the parochial 
fchool, a fchoolmafter is ftationed there, with a falary of L. 6 
from the Society for propagating Chriftian knowledge, and 
L. 6 from Sir William Forbes. The weavers fettled in this 
village acknowledge, that they can afford to weave a halfpen- 
ny per yard at leaft, cheaper than the weavers in any of the 
towns. 



Produce, Exports, Rent.— The parifh can fupply itfdf with 
meal, malt, butter, cheefe, beef, mutton, lamb, poultry, po- 
tatoes, and other common vegetables The principal ex- 
ports are meal, cattle, Iheep, hogs, butter, cheefe, wool, po- 
tatoes, and fuel -The land-rent, according to the 

moft exaa rental that can be obtained, amounts to L. 870 
fterling. Were the people encouraged to improve the uncul- 
tivated grounds, the rent to the proprietors might arife to a 
much greater amount. But the tenants muft firft be put in 
eafy circumftances, and have longer leafes, before they can 
afford an adequate value for the lands they occupy*.

Stipend, Church, Poor -The living, including the glebej 

is about L. 78 fterling. Lord Saltoun is patron. There ii 

no date upon the church, nor has the age of it been found in 
any record. It is fuppofed to have been built about the year 
1004, when the Thane of Buchan routed the Danifh army 
upon the neighbouring hills ; which, from a chieftain who 
was killed, ftill retain the name of Sinclair. It was built (as, 
tradition fays) for a chapel to the religious houfe which once 
ftood in its vicinity, and had an aifle joined to it when it be- 
came a parifh church. This church was formerly well known by 
the name of The White Kirk of Buchan ,- and a celebrated mo- 
dern hiftorian (Dr Henry) mentions, that a queen once propof- 
cd to vifit this facred edifice. The oldeft date legible upon any 
of the antient pews, is 1 596. The old walls are built wiih 
run-lime, which, by reafon of its age, is now liker afhes than 
lime. The weft end was rebuilt in the year 17 10, and the 
eaft end was repaired in 1773. A few aged trees, near the 
church, make an agreeable appearance *. 

The poor's funds are made up of the money colleaed on 
the Lord's days, and at the Sacrament, with fometimes a 
fmall fine for fornication. The money fd colleaed, amounts 
annually to about L. 13 fterling, unlefs in the late years of 
fcarcity } and the money diftributed annually, amounts to a- 
bout L. 12 fterling. In the years 1782, 1783, and 1784, the 
collections were L. 15 filing lefs than the fums diftributed. 
This deficiency, and a few bad debts, reduced the ftockfrom

» There are many tumuli in this parilh and neighbourhood. Some have 
b »en opened, and found to contain coffins of gray flag-ftones, fet on their edges, 
fides and ends, and covered above with the fame fort of ftones. In thefe 
coffins were human bones. The ground was a little raifed, with a mixture of 
earth, and fmall ftones. Upon what occafion peopl* were buried there, a 
that manner, ii not known.

I,. 60 to !efs than L. 40 fterling. The number of poor on the 
roll in 1783, was from 28 to 34 ; the number prefently on the 
roll is 1 5; of which 3 are natives, 5 have refided for fome years, 
and 7 for a few years. The number has never been fo fmall fince 
178 1, and the ftock, by faving in good years, has got up to 
about L. 50 fterling. Moft of the above 15 have been redu- 
ced to poverty by old age and diftempers. Three distributions 
are made in the year j and fome paupers receive almoft every 

week, according to their neceffities. Sir William Forbes 

caufes meal be given weekly from his granary, gratis, to eve- 
ry poor perfon in his eftate, which enables the church-feffion 
to beftow more on thofe in the other eftates and there is on- 
ly one common beggar in the parifh, who, being of a wander- 
ing difpofition, will not ftay at his home. The fuperabundance 
of fine fuel induces old infirm people to take up their refidence 
near the moffes. In a few years the poor's box muft main- 
tain them, and pay nurfes to take care of them, and when 
they die muft defray the expence of their interments. When 
a perfon is put upon the poor's roll, and expofed in the num- 
ber of paupers, he often lofes the fenfe of fhame, becomes 
mean-fpirited, greedy, and the companion of mendicants. 
A difcretionary power lhould be given to fome proper perfon 
in every parifh, to beftow charity, in fuch a private manner, 
as never to be heard of *. 

Improvements. 

* The antient price of I lb. of beef was from id. to id. halfpenny; the 
prefent, from ad. halfpenny to 4 d. Veal, mutton, lamb, pork, are much a- 
bout the fame price. The price of a hen, about 40 years ago, was from ad. 
halfpenny to 4 d. the prefent, from 6d. to 8d. The price of 14 eggs was id. 
the prefent price is from 3d. to 4 d. for iz eggs. Butter was, about 40 years 
ago, from ad. halfpenny to 3d. halfpenny per lb. of 2,0 ounces Dutch weight:

Improvements. About 40 years ago, a great part of the 

lands in this parim lay in their natural uncultivated ftate, and 
fuch of them as were in culture produced poor ftarved crops. 
The tenants were in poor circumftances, the rents low, ,the 
farm houfes contemptible. The communication from place 
to place was along paths which were to be known by the foot- 
fteps of beafts that paned through them. No turnips, pota- 
toes, or cabbages, unlefs a few of the latter in fome gardens ; 
and a great degree of poverty, indolence, and meannefs of fpi- 
rit, among the great body of the people. The appearance of 
the people, and their mode of thinking and a&amp;ing, were but 
mean and indelicate ; their peats were brought home in creels ; 
the few things the farmer had to fell were carried to market 
upon the backs of horfes -, and their dunghills were hard by 
their doors. What has been done for promoting the induftry, 
profperity, and happinefs of this parifh and neighbourhood, 
muft reflea great honour to the memory of the late Alexander 
Frafer of Strichen, one of the fenators of the College of Juf- 
tice. He firft introduced improvements; gave lime to his te- 
nants, gratis, and, in fpite of their prejudices, prevailed with 
them to ufe it as * manure brought flcilful men from the 
fouth country, who taught them how to fow grafs feeds, and 
raife turnips, cabbages, and potatoes in the fields. He gave 
them leafes, during their lives, at a reafonable rate ; and did 
not think his intereft hurt when he faw his tenants enjoying

the comforts of life ; nor did he treat them like cattle, as 
occafions offered. The good effe&amp;s of thefe encouragements 
are, extenfive fields regularly laid out, fine (tone fences, good 
houfes built with (tone and lime, excellent crops of turnips, 
fown grafs, and almoft all forts of grain, flocks of cattle, 
full corn yards, and every where the appearance of plenty. 
Hay, formerly unknown, is now plenty. Commerce and 
manufactures begin to thrive ; much money is brought in- 
to the parifh for yarn and linen, made out of flax raifed in 
it ; and all ranks of people are more induftrious and more 

healthy than formerly Providence hath raifed up another 

friend to the people, and encourager of improvements, in 
Sir William Forbes. To fee what improvements can do, look 
at his farm of Tillenamolt ; there may be feen good crops of 
fown grafs, grain, and turnip, upon about 30 or 40 acres of 
moor, formerly not worth 2d. the acre. Is it not deplorable, 
that many hundred acres in this parifh fhould produce nothing 
but heath, not from barrennefs', but from indolence ? that 
wafte land of a good quality fhould abound in many places, 
which fome fkill and proper induftry would fertilize ? 

Mifcellaneous Remarhs Several young men, at different 

periods, have become failors and foldiers. Some, encoura- 
ged by people abour Glafgow, have migrated to North Ameri- 
ca, where they have fettled, and fent home money to their 
aged parents. By comparing (in their letters) their prefent 
with their former condition in this country, they have done 
much to excite others to follow their example. Such exam- 
ples, and fome late publications, may do much hurt, unlefs 
feafonably prevented. America is represented to be a whole- 
fome and pleafant country, where the people, enjoying the 
rights of freemen, have a vote in the. election of their legifla.

providence, to afford a comfortable habitation to thofe who 
are ill ufed at home ; where the land is good in its quality, 
cheap, and gratuitoufly bellowed ; and the paffage to it unex- 
penfive, and made in a few weeks. As migration is begun in 
this lowland country, fomething fhould be done to put a flop 
to its progrefs : fomething more eft"e£lual than giving premi- 
ums to pipers ! 

A great national fund may be raifed for patriotic purpofes, 
without making heritors one farthing poorer. Let the money 
be fo applied that is thrown away upon cards, plays, race-hor- 
fes, hounds, balls, and concerts ; and thoufands yet unborn 
may have reafon to blefs them great fortunes may be provid- 
ed for their pofterity ; and, when talents are to be account- 
ed for, they may be better enabled to give in their accounts 
with a good grace. 

The fubtenants are not contented with their fituation and 
circumftances. A houfeholder, who can be removed on fix 
weeks warning, and does not know where to find another 
houfe, as frequently happens, is really in a difagreeable fitua- 
tion. The fubtenants mufl work three days annually to the 
proprietor of the eftate, who likewife exacts one hen from eve- 
ry houfeholder. Thefe days ftill retain the flavifh name of 
bondage days. The hufbands muft ferve their mailers in mofs 
and harveft time, while their own corns are cut down by their 
wives ; and they muft at no time work to other people if they 
mailers have any fervice for them. By this treatment, they 
are difpirited and deterred from improving their grounds ; and 

young men are difcouraged from marrying. Sir William 

Forbes has made the fubtenants in his eftate independent on 
their former mailers ; and another heritor, for fome years 

paft, has not exafted their bondage work, The condition 

of the people may be meliorated by the following means :— 
ill, By increafing the number of farms. As opulent farmers 
■ often 

X 



of Tyrze. 147 

ofeen exert themfelves to get other farms annexed to their 
own, there is fome caufe to fear the misfortune which Pliny 
complained of, when he fays, that large farms had ruined Ita- 
ly, and now even the provinces. The antients laid it down 
as a maxim, that the fize of farms mould be particularly at- 
tended to, feeing that it is moil advifeable to fow little and 
plough welh — A barren fpot, on which induftry is excited by 
means within the reach of many, will foon be cultivated by 
the conftant labours of the many. As on large farms few of 
the fervants are in fuch eafy circumftapces as to be induced to 
marry, a want of hands muft be foon felt ; and this want is at 
the prefenttime feverely felt in this pare of the country. Small 
farms being within the reach of many, are a temptation to 
many to fettle, to encreafe and multiply. If confiderable 
owners of land could be induced to divide large farms among 
a number of induftrious hufbandmen, the wafte lands would 
be improved, the rents greatly augmented, and the number 
of induftrious people greatly increafed. A divifion of large 
farms is very practicable in this parilh, becaufe it contains fuch 
large moffes as never could be exhaufted, great quantities of 
very improveable ground, and has plenty of good lime in its 
neighbourhood. 2d, By rearing up chearful villages, and 

giving advantageous feus to manufacturers. A noble mind 

will find unfpeakable pleafure to obferve many hundreds of 
Free induftrious people thriving and happy, every one in his 
own houfe ; and to acl fuch a part on the ftage of life, as that 
the two following lines of Virgil might, without much impro- 
priety, be inferibed on his graveftone : 

Vixty et quern dederat curfuip fortutia peregi ;

of ground that would be excellent fites of chearful villages. 
They have not only all the above mentioned conveniences, 
but alfo abundance of fine moorftones for building, and are 
not far diftant from fea-ports. Upon the whole, however, 
the parifh of Tyrie, upon account of its fituation, extent, and 
natural advantages, may, in procefs of time, become one of 
the moft populous and confiderable parifh es in Buchan.

(PRESBYTERY OF DUNKELD, SYNOD OF PERTH AND 
STIRLING, COUNTY OF PERTH.) 

By the Rev. Mr. Archibald Menzies.</head> 

<p>

Name, Extent, \£c. 
TP\ULL, or Bail, in the Celtic language, (which is uni- 
formly fpoken here), fignifies a haugh or plain, and 
this name appears to have been afiumed to the parifti from the 
local fituation of the haugh or plain of Appin, in which the 
church (lands. The extent of the parifh is very confiderable, 
and its form is very irregular. Indeed there is this peculiarity 
in all the parifhes in the braes of Perthftnre, that they are in- 
terfe&amp;ed with one another in fuch a manner that one cannot 
defcribe their exaft form. The length of Dull, from S. to N. 
is 30 miles, and its breath 12. It is divided into five diftri&amp;s. 

1. The diftria of Appin, in which the parifti church Hands. 

2. The diftria of Grandtully, where there is a chapel, in 
which the minifter preaches occafionally, 6 miles from his 
church. 3. The diftria of Amulrie, 12 miles diftant from 
Appin, m which is a miflionary fupported by the committee 
for managing the royal bounty. 4. The diftria of Fofs, 8 

miles 



15° Statiftical Account 

miles from the church ; here is a chapel in which the million- 
ary of Rannoch preaches every third Sunday. And, 5. The 
diftricl: of Fincaftle, 1 5 miles from Appin, to which the minif- 
ter travels acrofs very high hills three or four times a year. 

There are various . kinds of foil, as may be reafonably ex- 
pected, in fuch an extenfive tract of country. The divifion 
of Appin is flat : part of the foil is thick, but by much the 
greater part is thin and gravellifh. It feems that the river Tay 
had occafionally altered its bed, and confequently carried a- 
way the earth, and left much fand and gravel. There is a 
great deal of hill, but the greater part of the pariih is a corn 
country. In the higher tracts the arable ground is exceeding 
good, and yields great crops, although they are feldom fertile, 
being very late in ripening In this diftricl the grain is of an ex- 
cellent quality ; and, in general, harveft here is as early as it is 
in Mid Lothian, 

Lakes, Rivers, tsfc. There are no lefs than 1 5 lakes in 

the pariih. In all of them are to be found pike, trout, and eel. 
Pike, which weighed upwards of 30 lbs. have frequently been 
caught in Loch-Tumble. There are feveral rivers, but none 
of them confiderable, except the Tay and the Tumble, The fair 
mon of the former is of an excellent quality; and the little of it 
which is fold in the county fells at 6d. per lb. during the fpring 
feafon, and about 3d. in fummer : little, however, is fold in 
the parifh, as the falmon are chiefly fent to Perth, and from 

thence conveyed to the London Market. The banks ef the 

Tay have a great tendency to oak-wood. There are alfp very 
large birch trees in the parifh. 

Horfesy Coivsy and Sheep.— There are 1500 horfes, 5000 
cows, and 24,000 fheep in the pariih. Little care has been 
hitherto taken to improve the wool, the particular attention of 

proprietors 



of Dull. 151 

proprietors and farmers having been dire&amp;ed to increafe the 
fize of the fheep. White wool fells at 7s. 6d. and wool laid 
with tar, at 5s. or 5s. 6d. per ftone. 

Population and Diftempers. It would feem that this parifh 

was more populous about 50 years ago than it is at prefent. 
The return to Dr Webfter, in 1755, was 4897 fouls*: the 
number of inhabitants, as appears from an exadl: lift of them, 
recently taken, now amounts to 4676. The reafons for the 
decreafe appear to be, that fome of the proprietors have ex- 
tended their own farms, and that it was confidered more bene- 
ficial for the farmers, that there fhould be no farm lefs than a 
ploughgate. In this part of the country it was ufual to halve, 
and even to quarter a fmall farm, fo that, perhaps, three or 
four families lived where only one now lives. In the higher 
parts of the country, fheep farms have alfo been united. — The 
annual average of births, for 10 years back, amounts to 80 ; 
but as many of the children, in the more remote parts of the

to fufpect that many names are never inferted in the parochial 
records. The average number of marriages is 40 : number 
of burials cannot be afcertained, as there is a burial place in 

each diflria ; no regifter of burials is kept. There is 1 fur- 

geon, and 1 family of Roman Catholics in the parifh— Rheuma- 
tifm and pleurifies are the molt prevalent diftempers: they feem 
to proceed from the dampnefs of their houfes, which in gene- 
ral are very bad. Inoculation for the fmall-pox has been very 
common in this diflria, and its good effects are clearly feen..

The rent of lands, in the lower parts of the parifh, is from 
I os. to 15s. per acre: the hill grounds, in general, are given 
in addition. But, in the higher part of the country, where 
much attention is paid to fheep, a farm is rented by the lump. 
— There are 17 heritors in the parifh, of which number only 
6 conftantly refide in it. 

The principal crops are, oats, Chefter-bear, peafe, and po- 
tatoes. Much attention is paid to the railing of the latter : the 
inhabitants fubfift on them about 9 months in the year ; and 
not a little is employed in feeding cows, horfes, and fwine. 
To this valuable root, and to the railing of flax, this country 
is particularly indebted. In general, all the farmers here raife 
and fpin what flax is fuflicient to pay their money rents, be- 
fides all their other fmaller accounts. There is probably 3000 
flone of flax annually raifed in the parifh. Turnips fucceed 
well here ; and, within thefe few years, confiderable progrefs 
has been made in ufing them. With a few exceptions, almoft 
every farmer, in the Appin diftri£t of the parifh, allots a fmall 
portion of his land to them : to this they are chiefly led by find- 
ing that grafs feeds thrive better after them than by any other 
preparation of the ground. The common way is to fow them 
in drills, although it has alfo been found, that they anfwer ve- 
ry well, in the broad caft method, for feeding fheep. Some 
experiments have been made in this neighbourhood to pafture 
lambs upon them, during the months of October and Novem- 
ber, as a prefervative againfl the difeafe called the Braxy. It 
is uncertain whether the defired objeft is attained by turnips, 
but this much is certain, that great advantage is gained by it. 
Oats are fown from the 10th of April to the beginning of May; 
and bear from the 15th of May to the 9th of June. 

The price of grain is various. The average converfion is a- 
bout 1 5s. the boll, Linlithgow meafure. What grain can be

country. 

Fuel.— There is a great fcarcity of fuel here. Peats are 
bad, fcarce, and at a great difiance. No trials for coal have 
yet been made in the parifli. It is much to be wifhed, that 
fome exertions were ufed to difcover whether coals can be 
found in this part. If the experiments prove fuccefsful, it 
would be a rich treafure to the proprietors, and a vaft advan- 
tage to the country at large *.

dable and pious inftitution, the rapid progrefs of improvement 
in the Highlands may in a great meafure be attributed. There is 
alfo a fchool, fupported by the heritors, at the village of Dull, 
at which about i go children are taught. Such as chufe, may 
there receive the benefit of claffical learning : hitherto it has 
been fuperintended by men who received a liberal education ; 
but, as the falary is only L. 80 Scotch, and the perquifites and 
fchool fees very low, it is to be feared that young men of this 
defcription will not confider it as an obje£t, worth their atten- 
tion. 

The number of poor upon the roll, in the whole parifh, is 
40. What money is expended for their fupport is collected in 
the church on Sundays, which annually amounts to L. 24, or 
thereabouts. Particular attention is paid only to the cafe of 
fuch as are bed-rid. All who are able to go about to alk chari- 
ty, receive very little from the parochial funds. It muft be 
confelfed, that hitherto this part of our conftitution has not 
been fufficiently attended to. If this, however, and the neigh- 
bouring parifhes, were to fupport their own poor, there is good 
reafon to think, that both parties would be gainers by it : the 
poor would be better provided for; and the country would 
not be infefted by fo many fturdy beggars as pour in upon it - 
from the north, during the months of June, July, and Au- 
guft. 

Mifceitatieous Remarks. — The roads, upon the whole, are in 
tolerable good order. Of late, a great deal has been done to 
improve them, and much ftill remains to perform. The king's 
road between Stirling and Invernefs paffes through this parifh. 
There are no turnpikes. The country roads are made and 
kept in repair by the ftatute work, exacted in kind : but it is. 
to be wifhed that this mode were altered, and that the occu- 
piers of land were afiefTed in a moderate fum of money. By 
.  -v laying 



of Dull. jtjcj 

laying out this money judicioufly, the work would be better 
done, earlier in the feafon, and to a far greater extent *. 

The people are fober, regular, and induftrious : they are 
lively, chearful, and given to hofpitality. Crimes are daily- 
becoming more rare. Grofs offenders are held in great dif- 
grace. A notorious drunkard is defpifed in thehigheft degree. 
The people enjoy, in a reafonable degree, the comforts and 
conveniencies of life ; and, in general, appear happy and con- 
tented with their condition. Their condition, however, might 
1 be meliorated if proprietors would grant them leafes of their 
farms. All of them are tenants that may be removed at the pro- 
prietors will. It has been faid, that they would become indo- 
lent if leafes were granted to them ; but experience fhews that 
this objection is ill-founded. 

* There are many Druidical temples in the parilh. A very great number 
of old caftles, many of them like watch towers. There is in one glen no lefs 
than the ruins of 15 of them. It is called Fincaftle, or Fo/mcbaifeal, the Land 
of Caftles. 

All the names of places are apparently Celtic. Kynnachan, this place is 
clofe by the old foreft of Shichallin; here the gentlemen were in ufe to aflem- 
ble for the chafe, and to uncouple their hounds ; hence, the etymology appears 
to be Coinneamb nan con, " the meeting of Dogs." Shierglafs, " always run-

    PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5940145">HUMBIE</name>. 

(COUNTY AND PRESBYTERY OF HADDINGTON, SY- 
NOD OF LOTHIAN AND TWEEDDALE.) 

By the Rev. Mr. Henry Sangster,</head> 

<p>

Name and Extent. 

nr^HIS parifh was formed, foon after the Reformation, by 
the junction of the parifhes of Keith and Humbie. In 
the end of the laft century, the parifh of Keith was called Keith 
Symmons, and that of Humbie, Keith Hundeley. The origin 
of the name of Humbie, which they bear fince their annexa- 
tion, is unknown ; and has probably arifen, as in other cafes, 

from fome frivolous circumftance. It is nearly in the form 

of a fquare of 6 miles, but is interfered by the parifh of 
Fala. 

Population — The return to Dr. Webfter, in 1755, was 570 
fouls i at prefent, there are 676 in this parifh. From the re- 
gifter of births, taking at an average of 10 years, at any period, 
it appears that the population has not decreafed during the laft 
60 years. In a diftrict like this, where the fole occupation of 
the inhabitants has always been agriculture, the numbers muft 

be 



of Humbie. 157 

be nearly ftationary. Indeed the improvement of 1 horfes in- 
ftead of 4 in a plough, which was introduced in the year 
1768, evidently leffened the number of farm fervants; but 
this effect of it feems to have been counteracted, by the addi- 
tional work occafioned by the preferable modes of agriculture, 
and particularly that of raifing turnips, which commenced ex- 
actly at the fame period : for upon one large farm, on which 
about 100 acres of turnips are raifed annually, the numbers 
are encreafed, and more ft ill could find employment. 

There are 7 heritors, 4 of whom refide : 1 o farmers ; x inn- 
keeper : 3 weavers \ 5 fmiths ; 4 carpenters ; 4 taylors ; 1 
baker ; 1 fhoemaker ; 1 dyer. The other inhabitants are em- 
ployed in the different operations of hufbandry. 

Soil, Agriculture, &amp;c. The high grounds, lying be- 
tween Soutrahill and Lammerlaw, are adapted for the paflure 
of the common Scotch fheep. Attempts have been made to 
raife crops of corn upon fome parts of them, where the foil is 
naturally good ; but, though (kill and induftry have occafion- 
ally fucceeded, the expence, expofure, and climate, point out 
the pafturing of them to be the moft profitable fyftem.— The 
foil of the parifh, in general, is various : in fome parts, a thin 
wet clay; in others, moffy. A great deal of it, however, is 
fit for raifing turnips or grain ; and, wherever it is favourable 
for thefe crops, it is cultivated generally with great attention 
and ability. The favourite rotation of crops is, turnips, bar- 
ley or oats, clover, oats, which is certainly the beft that is at 
prefent in practice ; though, were the climate earlier, an 
improvement might be made upon it by introducing wheat 
after turnips. Several thoufand bolls of oats, and fome hun- 
dred bolls of wheat and barley, are fent annually to mar- 
ket. Great attention has been given to the rearing of fheep, 
and the fuccefs has been proportional. It is from this parifh 

that 



15 8 Statijlical Account 

that the Edinburgh market has, of late years, been fupplied 
with the firft early lambs j one farmer having fent to it annu- 
ally 100, at a guinea each. The ewes from which they are 
obtained are of the Cowley breed. They are kept till they 
are old, and are well fed through the year. By a fimilar ma- 
nagement, lambs may be had as early as they are wanted, and, 
perhaps, from any breed of flieep ; but it will be neceflary, for 
that purpofe, that the ewes and lambs be kept as warm as pof- 
fible in a houfe or flied, the ewes being fed with turnips 
and with oats daily, at the rate of a peck to 20 of them. 
This method of obtaining early lambs is reckoned preferable 
to that which, it is faid, is followed in the fouth of Scotland, of 
heating the ewes in a barn, or any inclofed place. 

Only 3 farmers in this parifh are fubjetted, by their leafes, 
to pay kain-fowls. Thirlage carriages and kain were in ufe 

16 years ago : but the prefent tenants, when offering for their 
farms, infilled for an exemption from them ; and, as they al- 
lowed more in their propofals than an equivalent for it, the al- 
teration has been attended with no lofs to the proprietors, and 
allows the tenants to proceed in their operations without being 
expofed to the hurtful confequences arifing from capricious or 
ill-timed interruptions. 

So late as the year 1770, a farm of the rent of L.70 was 
reckoned a large one; now, one at the rent of L. 100 is not 
deemed fufhcient for a farmer toj live upon. From L. 300 
to L. 500 of rent, is reckoned a moderate fize. Should this 
fpeculation be progreffive, of which there is great appearance 
at prefent, the confequences are perhaps not uncertain. It 
cannot be hurtful to the condition of the loweft clafs of people, 
or, confequently, to population ; and proprietors will receive 
a great encreafe of rent, while the farmers, who have fkill and 
fpirit for fuch increafed undertakings, will be as amply re- 
warded. But, by this melioration of their eftates, for fuch 

they 



of Humhie. 159 

they feem to think it, by throwing corn farms into the fize of 
L. 1000 a year, or upwards, proprietors will annihilate, in a 
great meafure, the clafs of farmers ; and may find it difficult, 
at no diftant day, to getperfons poflefTed of flock and abilities 
for fuch undertakings, as too great a reduction of the number of 
farmers muft operate as powerfully, as the diminutive fize of 
farms, againft a fpirit of emulation and improvement. 

Roads, Changes of Property, Woods, &amp;c— Before the year 
177®, the roads were fo bad, that in many places they were 
impaffable in winter ; and, at no feafon of the year, could 
more than 5 bolls of grain be fent to market upon a two horfe 
cart. But, in confequence of an Act of Parliament, for the 
county, levying 20s. from every ploughgate of land, they are 
now in fo good repair, that 10 bolls are the common load. 
They were made more eafily, however, that gravel was at no 
great diftance, and the foil admitted of their being formed by 
the plough. For the purpofe of keeping them in repair, the 
tenants, who have fields of fown grafs in their neighbourhood, 
are allowed 2d. for each cart load of {tones which they gather 
upon them, and are befides paid for the carriage. 

Property has fluctuated much in this parifh of late. This 
has been the cafe with none more than the barony of Keith ; 
which, together with Inch-Keith and other lands, were given, 
along with the office of Hereditary Great Marifhal of Scot- 
land, by King Malcolm, to one Robert, as a reward for kill- 
ing, with his own hand, Camus the king and champion of the 
Danes, at the battle of Barry, in the year 10 10. From thefe 
lands Robert took the fimame of Keith, and they remained in 
the pofTeffion of the family till they were fold for the purpofe 
of affording aid to General Leflie.

object to a traveller, when the Lothians open to his view, 
from Soutrahill. There are fome wood-cocks and pheafants 
in it. It is infefted with that diftemper, fo pernicious to cat- 
tle, called the "Wood- ill, or Muir-ill; the effe&amp;s of which 
may, however, be certainly prevented by caftor oil, x or any o- 
ther laxative. The grafs glebe is not free from this diftemper, 
though the natural wood, with which it was covered, has been 
rooted out more than 60 years ago. 

This diftricl: is well fituated with regard to markets for corn, 
being at the diftance of 8 miles from Haddington, and of 9 
miles from Dalkieth, the only ready money markets, Edinburgh 
excepted, in Scotland. The advantages of fuch markets are 
numerous ; and, proprietors would eflentially promote the in- 
terefts of agriculture, if they would co-operate with the farm- 
ers in eftablifhing them wherever it can be done *. 

Rent— The valued rent is L. 3991 : 3 -.4 Scotch: the real 
rent about L. 2700 fterling. The price of arable land is from 
123. to 30s. per acre. The pradice of letting farms, by pri-

* The wages of fervants, of all denominations, have encreafed one-third 
during the laft »o years. Day-labourers receive is. Women, boys, and girls, 
■when hoeing turnips, 6d. per day : a maid fervant in the houfe, L. 3 yearly ; 
a young man capable for managing horfes, L. 6. The whole emoluments of 
a married farm fervant amount to about L.14; which, with the earnings of 
his wife, enable him to rear a family of 4 or 5 children ; but, during this pe- 
riod, the whole family are very poorly fed indeed. The firft relief he meets 
with is from the oldeft of his children, who go as early as pofllble to fervice, 
and give him whatever they can fpare for bringing up their younger brothers 
and Mers. In this way have numerous families been brought up, without 
the lead aid from the public funds. When their filial exertions are no longer 
neceffary, the young people turn their attention to drefs. The higher clafs

fome inftances, needy and unfkilful perfons were preferred for 
a mere trifle, and foon became infolvent. This mode of let- 
ting farms to the perfon who offers moft, provided he flocks 
his farm, and pays the firft year's rent, is unfavourable to a- 
griculture. The private intereft of proprietors, and the good 
of the public, point, out the amount of the rent to be an infe- 
rior confideration to the abilities of the tenant : for it is only 
in the hands of fuch perfons, that the foil can be made produc- 
tive ; and from them alone, when in circumflances moderate- 
ly eafy, are improvements to be expected : nor can a more ef- 
feftual check be given to induftry and genius, than to put a 
farmer, who, by his attention and talents, has brought his 
farm to a high flate of improvement, upon a level with an un- 
known adventurer, or to require from him, at the expiry of 
his leafe, a rife of rent equal to the extent of his own melio- 
ration of the foil. 

. MM * Rivers, &amp;V._There feems to be abundance of 
iron-ore in many places; and there are appearances of coal. 
—There is a fpring of martial acidulous water, which was 
much reforted to, 60 years ago, by people of fafhion, for fcor- 
butic diforders* 

There are 3 brooks, Bims-water, Humbie-water, and Keith- 
water. In all of them there is plenty of trout, fome of which 
are of a good flavour. There is a fall and a quantity of water 
upon them fufficient for machinery.

* The vefliges of a Roman Cajldlum Staiivum are ftill to be feen, upon ' the 
eftate of Whiteburgh, in the S. W. part of the parifii. It was of a circular 
form, and confided of 3 walls, at the diftance of 15 feet from each other, 
built with very large ftones, and with cement only at the bottom. It occu- 
pied more than an acre of ground. No information can be got about the 
height of the walls ; but the proprietor of the lands remembers that the 
parts of them which he has feen, were 16 feet thick. The whole work has 
been carried off at different times for building the prefent houfe and offices of 
Whiteburgh, and fome farm houfes upon the eftate.— Near it were feveral 
tumuli, in which were urns full of bones or alh.es. In the camp itfelf, were 

found a medal of Trajan, a fibula, a patera, and a horn of a moofe deer.  

In its near neighbourhood, but in other parifaes, are 3 other encampments, 
fituated in fuch a manner, as gives room to fuppofe, that the whole were in- 
tended to aft in concert, and overlook the Lothians. Perhaps the houfe 

Of Keith, one of the feats of the Earl Marilhal, though of no later date than 
1590, may be mentioned on account of its hall, which furpafied any thing of 
the kind, and was fuited to the fplendor of a family at that time the moft o- 
pulent and powerful in the kingdom. The houfe itfelf was of the form of 
h hollow fquart; and one entire fide of it, no feet in extent, and 3 ftories in 
height, was occupied as a hall. Succeeding proprietors have pulled it down. 
The timber with which the houfe was built, was a prefent from the King of 
Denmark, as an expreffion of the high opinion he conceived of the Earl, when 
employed to treat of the marriage of the Princefs Anne of Denmark, with 
James yi. 



of Humbie. x6j 

There are 2 fchools with the legal falary of 100 merles to 
each. The average number of fcholars at both, is 60. 

No perfon, having a refidence in this parifh, is permitted 
to beg in it, or to leave it for that purpofe. The number of 
poor fupported by the funds, feldom exceeds 15. The fum 
expended yearly for their fupport, and for cafual charities in 
the parifh, is about L. 40 ; and is moftly the intereft of a ca- 
pital, raifed before the year 1750, by collections, when the 
whole heritors and their families regularly attended public wor- 
fhip. From 3s. to 4s. monthly is the allowance, at an ave- 
rage, to each penfioner *. 

The inhabitants are induftrious, and fatisfied with their con- 
dition.— It is not in the recollection of the oldeft perfon among 
them, that an inhabitant of this parifh has been punifhed for 
any crime. Dram-drinking, fo prevalent in other parts of 
Scotland, is a vice utterly unknown, as might be expected 
from a people, among whom no manufacture has ever been 
«ftablifhed, and whofe fole employment, that of a very few 
individuals excepted, is agriculture. 



* In this, and fome of the neighbouring diftrrfte, many labourers, mecha- 
nics, and farm fervants, who are in fuch circumftances that they could not, 
with much propriety, apply to their parifh funds for a temporary relief, have 
fofmed themfelves into focieties, whofe objeft it is to give aid to fuch of their 
members as may be accidently in diftrefs. Each member pays half a guinea at 
his admiffion, and is. quarterly. The effects of theft benevolent inftitutions 
have already been extenfive and beneficial. They fton would begenerally efrablifli- 
td, if gentlemen of property would become members, and contribute a fmall 
fum annually; by which they would prevent applications, in many inftances, 
to the public funds, and do a moft acceptable office to numbers of perfons who 
arefo neceflaryto fociety; and are entitled, perhaps, to attention, on ac- 
count of thedifpofition they difcover to give, what they can but ill afford, for 
the amiable purpofe of protecting one another from the diftreffing and humili- 
ating fituation, of holding out their hand to receive public charity.

COUNTY OF KINROSS.) 

By the Rev. Mr. Archibald Smith.</head> 


<p>
Name. 

KiN-ROSS, in the Celtic, fignifies the head of the penin- 
fula ; and it is faid that the whole tracT: of country, ly 
ing betwixt the Tay and the Forth, had antiently the name of 
Rofs, or the Peninfula. 

Towns. " T he town of Kinrofs, pleafantly fituated in an 
extenfive plain at the weft end of Lochleven, upon the great 
road between Perth and Queensferry, at the diftance of 15 
miles from each, is the capital of the fmall county of the fame 
name, and the feat of the Sheriff, Juftice of Peace, and Ba- 
ron Bailie Courts. 

This town, it would appear, formerly confided of 47 Head- 
ings, or tofts, as they are commonly called, as is evident 
from an agreement mutually entered into in 1708, for the di- 
vifion of a common, called the muirs of Kinrofs, to which 
each of them had an equal right. The inhabitants then de-

of Kinrofs. 163 

rived their fubfiftence chiefly from the produce of the town a- 
cres, grazing their cattle on the feveral commons belong to 
the place, and from the fifh of Lochleven. 

The are 4 annual fairs in Kinrofs, reforted to by people 
from a confiderable diftanqe, especially dealers in black-cattle 
and horfes. 

Within the laft 30 years, between 60 and 70 new houfes 
have been added to the town, affording accommodation for a- 
bove double the number of families. The rents of houfes are 
from 30s. to L. 5 each, and that of the town acres, L. 3 per 
acre ; each of thefe computed acres fell for between L. 80 and 
L. 100 fterling, though liable in payment of about 10s. yearly 

of feu duties, and of public burdens. There are no houfes 

of any note in the parifh, excepting only that of Kinrofs, built 
by the celebrated architect Sir William Bruce, the proprietor, 
in 1685. It is a large elegant ft ru&amp;ure. The hall is 54T feet 
long, by 24 feet wide. The old houfe, for fome generations 
the refidence of the Earls of Morton, fituated on the N. of the 
prefent garden, was taken down about the year 1723, but fome

miles in length, from N. to S. and nearly the fame at its great- 
eft breadth. It is bounded by Lochleven on the eaft. As this 
diftria lies in the middle of the plain of Kinrofs, the ground 
is moftly flat, and the foil various ; a little of it is of ftrong 
clay, fome of a mixed quality, but by far the greateft part is 
a thin light black earth, with a gravelly bottom ; yet even this 
laft appears capable of producing tolerably good crops, where 
improvements have been made. 

^ Rivers and Loch There are 3 fmall rivers in this pa- 
nto, viz. Gairney on theS. boundary, the South Quiech be- 
low

low the town, and North Quiech at the N. boundary. All 
thefe difcharge themfelves into Lochleven ; and are ftored with 
fmall trout, that afford fine amufement to anglers. 

Lochleven, a magnificent and beautiful piece of water, 
bounded by the hills called the Lomonds on the E. and Benar- 
ty on the S. and by the plain of Kinrofs on the N. and W. is 
about 12 miles in circumference, fetting afide the angular jut- 
tings, and 4 miles in length, from the W. end of the town to 
the £. at the Gulet bridge *. Several iflands are diiperfed in 
this fine collection of water ; the mod remarkable is that dif- 
tinguifhed by the captivity of Queen Mary Stewart. The filh 
of the loch have been fo well defcribed by Pennant and others, 
that it feems unnecefTary to fay much about them here. The 
following obfervations, however, may not be unworthy the 
attention of the curious. The high flavour and bright red colour 
of the trout, feem evidently to arife from the food which na* 
ture has provided for them, in the loch. A considerable part 
of the bottom is oozy and fpongy, from which aquatic herbs 
fpring up in abundance ; and, fo vigorous are they in many 
parts, as towards the beginning of autumn, to cover the fur- 
face with their flowers. The trout, efpecially of fize, lie 
much in that fort of bottom. Gentlemen, accuftomed to make 
obfervations when angling, know well, that even in clear run- 
ning rivers, where their courfe takes a direction through a long 
traft of meadow, or of oozy ground, the trout that lie or feed 
in that ground, if of fize, are generally lefs or more of a pink 
colour in the flefli ; while thofe that feed in the ftony or gra- 
velly foil, above or below the fwampy meadows, are all white, 
excepting the mixture that is fometimes made by floods. But 
what appears to contribute moil to the rednefs and rich tafte of

the Lochleven trout, is the vaft quantiy of a fmall fhell-fifli, 
red in its colour, which abounds all over the bottom of the 
loch, efpecially among the aquatic weeds. It is of fhape quite 
globular, precifely of the appearance and fize of a lintfeedboll 
at a little diftance, and the trouts when caught have often their 
ftomachs full of them. Thefe obfervations may account for 
a phenomenon of another kind. In Lochleven are all the dif- 
ferent fpecies of hill, or burn, or muir trout, that are to be 
met with in Scotland, evidently appearing from the diverfity 
of manner in which they are fpotted. Yet all thefe different 
kinds, after being two years in the loch, and arriving at | or 
1 lb. weight, are red in the flefh, as all the trout of every kind 
in the loch are, except perhaps thofe newly brought down by 
floods, or fuch as are fickly. The filver-grey trout, with about 
4 or 5 fpots on the middle of each fide, is apparently the ori- 
ginal native of the loch, and, in many refpecls, the fineft fifh 
of the whole. The fry of all kinds are white in the flefh till 
they come to the fize of a herring, about the beginning of their 
third year. The gallytrough, or char, abounds in the loch 
The defcription of this fifh is generally well known. What is re- 
markable of them is the fize to which they often grow, fome 
of them weighing near 2 lb. and they are never known to 
rife to a fly, or to be caught with a hook, baited in any way 
whatever. Befides thefe, are vaft numbers of eels, pikes, and 
perch, in the loch.— The fifh of Lochleven, only a few years 
ago, fold here at id. each, great and fmall, for the trout, and 
the perch at id. the dozen, and, about 25 years ago, at half 
that price : the fifhing was then let at 200 merks Scotch. 
The trout * are now raifed to 4 d. per lb. the perch to 2d. per 

dozen; 

* Thofe called Bill trout are believed to be old ones. In fpring 1791, a Urge 
one was caught that weighed 10 lk— many of them weighed 8 lb.

dozen ; and the pike * to 2d. per lb. The prefent rent of the 
fifhing is L. 80 fterling, and for next year it is fixed at L. 100.

Ecclefiajlical 

* About a mile weft from Kinrofs, on the lands of Mawhilt, Is a fmall cairn, 
which, like many others in Scotland, is called the Leckar ftones ; another 
near Carfgour, known by the name of the Toryknow, was laft year razed to 
the ground, but nothing difcovered to gratify curiofity. A tumulus or mound, ' 
compofed moftly of earth, with fome ftones intermixed, on the eaft of Anno- 
freuch, was opened a few years ago, and a coffin found therein formed of rough 
flat ftones, fet on edge at the fides and ends, and a large one above ; within 
which were fome bones, and many pieces of burnt wood interfperfed. In the 
memory of fome old people, it was called the Elf-hillock, but it is now know* 
by the name of the Fairyknow. 

The moft remarkable piece of antiquity is the caftle of Lochleven, faid to 
have been the antient feat of Congal, fon of Dongart, King of the Pifts, who 
is fald to have founded it. It ftatids towards the N. W. part of the lake, or! 
an ifland about an acre and three-quarters in extent, and is encompafled with 
a rampart of ftone, nearly of a quadrangular form. The principal tower, » 
kind of fquare building, ftands upon the N. wall, very near the N. W. corner, 
and. there is a lefler rcnand one at the S. E. The other apartments were ar- 
ranged along the N. wall, between the great tower and the N. E. corner. A 
kitchen, fuppoled to have been built later than the reft of the caftle, ftood on 
the W. wall, near the S. W. corner} and another building, fuppofed to have 
been the chapel, between that and the great tower fronting the S. In the 
lower part of the fquare tower is a dungeon with a well in it. Above the 
dungeon is a vaulted room, which, from the appearance of the effects of fmoke 
on the jambs of the chimney, feems to have been ufed as a kitchen. Over 
this had been three ftones. No date or infciiption appears on any part of 
the buildings, excepting only the letters R. D. and M. E. (probably the ini* 
tiais of Sir Robert Douglafs and Margaret Erfldsc, his lady), on the face of

Ecclefajlical State, School, and Poor. — This parifh has had 
its own {hare of divifions ever fince the year 1732. The num- 
ber of fouls that belong to the Eftablifhed Churcb are about 
700 : the reft belong to three different denominations of Secef- 
fion, viz. the Burghers in this town, the Antiburghers, and 
a fmall meeting, who call themfelves of the Reformed Pref- 

bytery, in the parifh of Orwel. The living confifts of 

L. 536 :8 :4 Scotch, including 50 merks for communion ele- 
ments, 68 bolls oat-mea!, and 15 bolls bear. George Graham, 
Efq. of Kinrofs, is patron. 

The fchool is, at prefent, in a very flouvifhing Mate. The 
number of fcholars, during laft winter, was about 140 ; and, 
at a medium for 18 years paft, it has been above 100 yearly. 
Some of thefe come from other parifhes, befides a number of 

Y 2 boarders 

an ornamented ftone, that a fewyears ago, when the walls were ftanding, pro- 
jected a little at the N. E. corner of the kitchen. The whole circuit of the 
rampart is 585 feet — It is generally underftood that the roof was taken off 
the caftle about a century ago. Some part of it, particularly the roof of the 
round tower, is faid to have been repaired by Sir William Bruce. Some per- 
fons remember to have heard an old man fay, that, in- his time, there wer* 
5 2 beds, or perhaps only bed-fteads, in the caftle. 

The ifland is ornamented with a number of trees, and affords pafture for * 
cows. In autumn 1775 or 1776, the area or court within the caftle, was ftor- 
*d with well cultivated beds of onions, and the ground without, with tur- 
nips. 

Alexander III. is faid to have lived fome time at Kinrofs, undoubtedly in the 
eaftle of Lochleven, after returning from an interview with his father-in-law, 
Henry III. of England, at Werk caftle.— In this caftle Queen Mary Stuart was" 
imprifoned, on the 16th June 1567 ; refigned the crown with reluctance in fa- 
-ours of her fon, James VI. on the , 4 th July, fame year ; and efcaped from 
her confinement there, on the ad of May r 5 68, by means of George Douglas

with a good houfe and fmall garden, and about an acre and a 
half of land. 

The number of indigent perfons in this parifh, who receive 
fupply, cannot be exadly afcertained, as each of the different 
meetings difpofe of their charity to the poor of their own 
communion ; but as to the money arifing from the parilh funds, 
the molt needy of every denomination are equally admitted tp 
fhare. The managemenf of them is under the direction of a 
committee of the heritors, whodifburfe about L. 14 annually. 
The colle&amp;ions at the church doors are difpofed of by the kirk- 
feffion, to the poor under their immediate care, in proportion 
to their neceflities : they alfo diftribute to the poor of the fe- 
ceffion in cafes of diftrefs, and particularly during the feveri- 
ty of winter. The money difburfed by them, laft year, was 
about L. 20 ; fo the whole fum annually diftributed amounts 

to L. 34 fterling. Befides the above, L. 100 Scotch is paid 

annually out of the eftate of Kinrofs to 16 out-penfioners of 
an hofpital, which, it feems, had been intended upon a parti- 
cular fpot of ground at Kinrofs, mortified, it is faid, bv Sir 

"William Bruce. There are few begging poor belonging to 

this parifh ; but, as Kinrofs is a thorough-fare, and the roads in 
every direclicn around the town exceeding good, it is con- 
ftantly infefted with numbers of beggars from all quarters. 

Mifcellanccm Remarfa.- The valued rent of this parifh is 

Ii. 4006 : 6 : 8 Scotch. The real rent cannot be eafily afcer- 
tained, as moft of the farms are feus poffefTed by the proprie- 
tors themfelves.- Improvements in agriculture have hither- 
to advanced but ilowly in this diftri£r, owing in a great mea- 
fure to the lad mentioned circumftance, and alfo to the want 
of example. For as the feuars, in general, arc in that happy 
mediocrity of ftation, in which, perhaps, the greateft con- 

tentmen

ientment is to be enjoyed, and poflefs all the neceflaries and 
many of the comforts of life, each, till of late, continued to 
purfue the courfe followed by their fathers and grandfathers : 
but now, that a different mode of living univerfally prevails, 
a fpirit of induftry and a tafte for improvement are roufed, and 
every one is endeavouring to make his farm turn to the belt ac- 
count ; and, in order to excite emulation among the fervants, 
a ploughing match was held in March laft, at Turf-hills, a lit- 
tie to the weft of this town, where prizes were adjudged to 
thofe who excelled, according to their merit ; being the firft of 

the kind in this parifh. The ploughs now ufed are for the 

moft part of an improved conftruftion.— The principal crops 
are oats and barley. Confiderable attention has, of late, been 
paid to the cultivation of turnips ; and potatoes are a general 
crop in every part of the parifh. Much flax is raifed both for 
the market and for private ufe ; and great quantities of clover 
and rye-grafs are fown, on account of the demand for hay 
from the public inns, ftablers, horfe-hirers, and carters. Lit- 
tle or no wheat was raifed till of late, but it is now fown la 
different parts of jhe parifh.

Name, Extent, Surface, £sV, 

r B A HIS diftrift confifls of two united parifhes, Ardchattau 
and Muckairn, antiently called Baliebhodan and Kiele- 
fpickarrol ; the latter denoting the burying place of Bifhop 
Cerylus or Cerullus, and the former fignifying StBede's town 
or place of refidence. The walls of a fmall church, built by 
this faint, of excellent mafonry, ft ill remain entire, and have 

withftood the ftorms and tempefts of feveral centuries. ~ 

The parifh extends 24 computed miles in length, and is 20 in 
breadth at an average. The furface is for the moft part hilly 
and uneven, interfered with ftreams of water, and diverfified 
with heights and hollows. The air is falubrious ; the people 
in general remarkably healthy, and ftrangers to the difeafes 
which fpring from idlenefs and luxury. The different periods 
of longevity, to which many have attained, is a ftrong pre- 
iumotion in favour of the climate, A man died fome years a-

go at the advanced age of 105 ; three men on the verge 
of xoo, and a fourth turned of 100, are now living ; and 
within thefe few years feveral of both fexes, from 80 to 90 
years of age, have died in the full pofieflion of all their men- 
tal faculties. This diftri£t is frequently vifited by heavy rains, 
but the moifture is quickly abforbed by the earth, which is 
naturally dry. 

Rivers, Hills, Woods, &amp;c. — In the parifh are feveral rivers, 
abounding with excellent trout ; the moft conilderable are the 
Aw, the Kinlofs, and the Etie. Near the mouth of the 
former is a valuable falmon fifhing, which yields a confidera- 
ble rent: the falmon are of an excellent quality, not inferior 
to any in Scotland. — The hills are moftly covered withgrafs : 
the moft remarkable is Cruachan Bean, one of the higheft 
mountains in Scotland, 13 or 14 computed miles in circum- 
ference, affording excellent pafturage for black-cattle and 
fheep. It is very fteep towards the N. E. and Hopes gently 
down on the S. but rifes with an abrupt afcent towards 
the fummir, which is divided into two points, each 
exadly refembling a fugar loaf. The N. point is reckon- 
ed the higheft, and commands a very noble and moft extenfive 
profpea. The fea-pink grows upon it, and fea-fhells have 
been found on the fummit. The parifh abounds with na- 
tural wood ; and there are a few plantations of pines and 
Scotch firs. Every cutting of the wood is fuppofed, at a mo- 
derate computation, to yield the proprietors no lefs than 
L. 15,000 or L. 16,000 fterling. They confift of afh, birch, 
hazel, and alder, but chiefly oak. They abound with roes; 
and, on one eftate, fallow deer run wild in the woods, of a 
much fuperior fize and flavour to any of their fpecies that are 
confined in parks. There is a forclt in Glenetie, pretty well 
flocked with red deer. Foxes, hares, wild-cats, pole-cats, 

martins,

martins, weazels, offers, badgers, black cocks, moorfowl, ptar- 
migans, partridges, plovers, eagles, hawks, &amp;c. are found here* 

Natural ProduEtions. The foil is light and dry, except in 

a very few inftances. The arable land, when properly culti- 
vated, and allowed time to reft for fome refpite to recover it- 
•felf, produces excellent crops of oats,, barley, and potatoes, of 
a choice quality. But fhort leafes, and the promifcuous mode 
of letting viftual farms to feveral tenants, without affigning to 
each his- due proportion of arable ground, throw a damp upon 
the efforts of induftry, and prevent the improvements which 
would otherwife be introduced. Whereas, by adopting the 
contrary practice, a fpirit of emulation would be excited, the 
lands cultivated to more advantage than they are at prefent, 
and a much greater number would be fupported by the pro= 
duce. But it muft be acknowledged that a remarkable alte- 
ration for the better, as to agriculture, has taken place within 
ihefe few years ; and the parifh of Ardchattan would produce 
fufEcienf, for the maintenance of its inhabitants, if the te- 
nants referved their barley for their own ufe, but they always 
fell it to brewers, as it fetches a high price. This is not the! 
cafe with the parifh of Muckairn. About 1753, a company 
from Lancafhrre erected a furnace for cafting pig-iron, in its 
vicinity, and obtained a long leafe of feveral farms for rearing 
wood and grazing their work-horfes„ Thefe lie wafte and un- 
cultivated ; and occafion the importation of a confiderable' 
quantity of mealinto that diftri£t. The crops raifed here are 
-oats, barley, potatoes, and a fmall quantity of peafe. Hemp 
and flax are cultivated only for private ufe. A few fow rye- 

grafs and clover, which yield ample returns. The manures 

ufed here are lime, fhell-fand, fea-weeds, and dung. — The 
Scotch plough is generally ufed", being well adapted to the* 

foil. -There are 53 ploughs and too carts Hi this diftrift.

Hot'fai Cattle, and Sheep. The number of horfes, in- 
cluding breeding mares, at the loweft computation, amounts 
to 440 or 450. Though fmall, they are well fhaped, hardy, 
and eafily fed. Their price has advanced confiderably within 

thefe few years; they now coft from 10 to L. 12. In the 

parifh are from 2600 to 2800 black-cattle : though not of a 
large fize,they are in general handfome and well haired, and in 
great estimation with the Englifh drovers. Numbers are fold 
annually at from L. 4 to L. 6 each. Two five year old ftots, of 
the Highland breed, fed by Mr Campbell of Barcaldine, were 
raifed to fuch a fize as to fell for 40 guineas this year (1792). 
— There are between 28,000 and 30,000 fheep. The large 
breed, brought fome years ago from the fouth country, pro- 
duce a greater quantity of wool, but are much inferior in qua- 
lity to the old Highland fheep. Thoufands are fold yearly to 
the low country butchers. When a few are purchafed by in- 
dividuals, they fell for from 12s. to 14s. White wool fold 
laft year at 7s. 6d. the {tone ; wool befmeared with tar at 

5s. 6d.— 8 fleeces, on an average, to the ftone. The deep 

rooted prejudice againft fwine's flefh is now removed : molt 
of the farmers rear fome of that fpecies, which, not 30 years 
ago, they held in the utmoft deteftation. 

Rent. The valued rent is Li 587 : 7 14 Scotch. The 

real rent has increafed confiderably within thefe ten years, and 
is fuppofed to be between L. 4,000 and L. 5,000 fterling, ex- 
clufive of the cutting of the woods and the kelp fhores. It is 
difficult to afcertain the quantity of kelp made here, as the 
fhores are fo extenfive that one of the heritors can go upon his 
own ground no lefs than 9 computed miles along the fea-coaft : 
moreover the kelp is fold to flrangers, who find their account 
in concealing the produce. Few farms are let below L. 60, 



17 8 Statifiical Account 

and fome pay more than L. 200 of rent. There are 7 heri- 
tors, 2 of whom conftantly refide *. 

Population — According to Dr Webfter, the number of in- 
habitants in the united parifhes amounted, in 1755, to 2.195 : 
now it has increafed to between 2300 and 2400. But it ap- 
pears that this diftricT: was better peopled a few years ago than 
it is at prefent. Within thefe two or three years 140 perfons 
emigrated from hence to America ; and this year more are pre- 
paring to follow, being much encouraged by the flattering ac- 
counts of the former emigrants. Several families have re- 
moved to the low country, where the wages are high. The 
principal caufe of the decreafe of population is the engrofling 
and uniting feveral farms, and turning them into fheep-walks. 
Farms that formerly fupported 8 or 9 families are now oc- 
cupied by only 2 or 3, and, in fome places, folely by one 
fhepherd. But, it mud be acknowledged, that the prefent 
proprietors have given preference to the old poffeffbrs, and, in 
feveral inftances, renewed their leafes at a cheaper rate, and 
upon eafier terms, than have been offered to them by ftrangers. 
— The yearly average of births is 46 ; of marriages, 19 ; and 
of deaths, 28. 

Stipend, Schools, and Poor. The ftipend is 1400 merks 

Scotch, 

* All kinds of provifions are confiderably increafed in price. As there is no 
public market, every family muft provide their own necefTaries. A fat cow 
for (laughter, which 30 years ago could be bought at L. a : 10, now cofts L.6.

century by John M'Dougal of that ilk, is ftffl (landing. The prefent pro-

of the priory is converted into burying ground, in which are two monuments 
in niches in the walls ; each has a ftone coffin, and one of them is ornament-

which renders the accefs eafy from all quarters ; but the bye 
roads, efpecially fuch as lead to the glens, are rugged, flippery,

King Robert Bruce, immediately after his defeats at Methven and Dalree, the 
pleadings were in the Celtic language. 

In this diftrict flood the famous city of Bercgonium : it was fituated between 
two hills, one called Dun Macfnicban, " the hill of Snachan's fon," and the o- 
ther, much fuperior in height, is named Dun bha'd an rigb, " the hill of the 
" king's town." A ftreet paved with common flones, running from the foot 
of the one hill to the other, is ftill called Straid-mbaragaid, " the market 
" ftreet ;" and another place, at a little diftancc, goes by the name of Straid 
namin; " the meal ftreet." About 10 or n years ago a man, cutting peats 
in a mofs between the two hills, found one of the wooden pipes that conveyed 
the water from the one hill to the other, at the depth of 5 feet below the 
furface. On Dun Marfnichan is a large heap of rubbi(h and pumice ftones ; but 
no diftintt traces of any building or fortification can now be feen on either of 
the hills, the foundations having been dug up for the purpofe of eretting hou- 
fes in the neighbourhood. 

There is a tradition, among the lower clafs of people, that Beregonium 
was deftroyed by .Ire from heaven. In confirmation of this tradition, it may 
be mentioned, that a high rock, near the fummit of Dun bbailanrigh, project- 
ing and overhanging the road, has a volcanic appearance and a moft hide- 
ous afpeft. Huge fragments have tumbled down from it. Adjoining to this 
place, is a fine, open, fpacious bay, with a fandy bottom, capable of containing 
the whole navy of Great Britain. 

It would be endlefs to enumerate all the Druidical monuments in this di- 
ftridt Many cairns and heaps of ftones are to be feen here : one, in parti- 
cular, near .the centre of a deep mofs about 3 or 4 miles in circumference. In 
different places, are ftones rifing 12 feet above the furface of the earth, all of 
them one fingle ftone ; and, at a fmall diftance, a number of large ftones from 
AO to 22 feet in length, of an oval figure.

only 8 days work in the year at different periods. It is the in- 
tention of the proprietors to abolifh all perfonal fervitude, 
which will tend to the mutual advantage of both matter and 

tenant . The only fuel ufed by the lower clafies is peats, 

which lie in a very inconvenient fituation for many of the in- 
habitants, and confume almoft the whole fummer in cutting, 
leading, and fecuring them. Till the tax on coals is repealed, 
any attempt to introduce improvements or eftablifh manufac- 
tures in the Highlands, will be of no avail. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations — The people in general are fo- 
bcr, induftrious, and intelligent •, much inclined to hofpitali- 
ty ; humane and charitable ; ready to relieve the diftrefied, 
from whatever quarter they may come. They are all of the 
Eftablilhed church ; and punctual in their attendance on di- 
vine worfhip. The farmers make a decent appearance 5 feem 
to enjoy the comforts and conveniencies of life fuitable to 
their ftation •, and acknowledge that they have lefs difficulty in 
paying their rents (though confiderably increafed) than they 
had 30 years ago. The people in general are middle fized, 
well proportioned, and can endure great fatigue. — The com- 
mon language is the Celtic : the names of all the farms are de- 
rived from it, and are in general defcriptive of their fituations. 

Loch-Etie, which divides Ardchattan from Muckairn 

and two other parifhes, is a navigable inlet of the fea, 1 5 com- 
puted miles in length, but of unequal breadth. Near its mouth 
is a narrow channel, not much more than a mufquet-fhot over, 
at a place called Connel, fignifying in the Celtic, rage or fury; 
which is very defcriptive of this place, as a ridge of rugged 
and uneven rocks runs acrofs two- thirds of the channel, and 
occafions, at certain periods of the ebbing or flowing tide, fuch 
a rapid current that no veflel with the frefheft breeze can Item it. 
In the beginning of the flood, the tide runs up with a boifterous 

rapidity,

rapidity, and at ebb, it returns with a violence and noife une* 
quailed by the loudeft cataract. But there is fufficient depth 
of water, between the ridge of rocks and the land on the weft 
fide, for velTels of any fize or burden to pafs and repafs with 
fafety in the beginning of flood or ebb. There is a ferry here, 
and notwithftanding its alarming appearance, one of the fafeft 
in Scotland, as no accident has happened at it in the remem- 
brance of any man living. 

The fides of Loch-Etie are pleafant ; indented into creeks 
and bays, affording fafe anchorage in any wind whatever ; de- 
lightfully variegated with hill and dale, meadows and corn- 
fields, wood and water. There are feveral falmon fifheries on 
its fhores ; and it abounds with fmall red cod and cuddies ; 
and, in fome feafons, a few herrings are caught in it. Seals 
are its conftant inhabitants ; and porpoifes vifit it in the lat- 
ter end of April, and take leave of it about the clofe of July. 

The tide flows fix hours, and takes the fame time to return : 
it runs from Connel in a S. E. direction to Bonawe, and, after 
running along the north fide of Cruachan bean, bends its courfe 
N.E. till it terminates in Glenetie, i.e. the valley of Eta, famous 
for being the refidence of Ufnath, father of Nathos, Althos, and 
Ardan ; the firft of whom ran away with Darthula, wife of 
Conquhan, King of Ulfter in Ireland, which is the fubjett of 
a beautiful poem of Offian. Many places in and about the 
loch and valley of Eta confirm, beyond a poffibility of doubt, 
that fuch people were once refident there. In particular, a 
fmall ifland, with fome veftiges of a houfe upon it, goes by 
the name of Ela'm Ufnich y or the ifland of Ufnath. There is 
alfo, in the farm of Dalnefs in Glenetie, a rock riling in the 
form of a cone, on the end of a high hill, commanding a ro- 
mantic profpe£t, which to this day retains the name of Gria- 
tfph Dearduil, the balking place of Darthula.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6408064">KILMUIR EASTER</name>. 
(presbytery of tain, synod OF ROSS,) 

By the Rev. Mr. John Matheson.</head> 

<p>

Name, Extent, and Soil. 

THE Celtic, and original name of this parifh, is Cilmoir 
or Cilmary, Cellamaria, a chapel dedicated to the Vir- 
gin Mary ; or fo called in honour of fome lady of that name, 
by whom it was built and endowed. It is called Kilmuir Eaf- 
ter to diftinguifh it from another parifh within the bounds of 
the fynod of Rofs, which, in confequence of an annexation 
which lately took place, has loft its antient name of Kil- 
muir Wefter, and is now known by the appellation of Knock- 
bain. 

The parifh lies partly in the county of Rofs, and partly in 
the county of Cromarty. This is the fituation of all the pa- 
rifhes within the fynod where George, the firft Earl of Cromar- 
ty, had any property ; that nobleman having obtained the privi- 
lege of conflicting his whole landed property in Scotland into 
a feparate county, called the county of Cromarty ; and his 
property being of confiderable extent, and in detached por- 
tions, it forms a part of many parifhes in the fynod. This pa- 
rifh is about 10 miles long, and 4^ broad, on an average. It 

is 



184 Statijlical Account 

is bounded on the E. by the fmall river of Balnagown, and by 
the fands of Nigg, and bay of Cromarty on the S. The fituation 
is truly delightful, having the beft cultivated parts of fix neigh- 
bouring parifhes full in view. Beyond thefe, the eye extends 
over a profpecl: of 30 miles, from E. to W. along the Firth ; 
and, towards the S. E. a paffage opens between the two rocks 
called the Sutors or Saviours of Cromarty, through which a 
confiderable part of the county of Murray is vifible ; and all 
the veffels, fmall and great, that enter into the bay, and an- 
chor in this Partus Salutis, are feen from almoft every houfe 
in the parifh ; the whole forming one of the richeft and moft 
beautifully variegated landfcapes in Britain. 

The foil of this parifh is various : along the fliore, which is 
flat, it is generally light and fandy, but in rainy feafons very 
fertile; and, even in the drieft fummer, it feldom fails of 
yielding a fure crop. About a mile from the fliore, and al- 
moft parallel to it, a Hoping bank runs from E. to W. through 
the whole parifh : here both the foil and the climate begin to 
change, though the bank at its utmoft altitude is not more 
than 30 feet above the level of the fea. In place of the light, 
warm, and fertile foil below, one meets with a wet, cold, 
and furly clay, covered with 2 or 3 inches of black moffy earth; 
and in many places a black pan, hard as iron ore, runs in a ftra- 
tum of 2 or 3 inches thick in the bofom of the clay, and about 
8 or 9 inches below the furface, which in a rainy feafon keeps 
the water floating above, prevents early fowing, and fome- 
time ftarves the feed in the ground. This bank, however, has 
for the moft part been long in cultivation, and is all along 
covered with corn-fields, or fown grafs, which, with a dry 
fpring, and moderate fummer rains, produce heavy crops. 
Behind the bank, and towards the north, a plain of 4 miles 
long, and from 2 to 3 broad, opens to view ; of which about 
a fourth part is in cultivation, a fourth part is mofs yielding 
3 peats 



of Kihnuir Eajlef. 

peats to the inhabitants, and the other half a barren muir, of 
jnuch the fame foil with that of the above-mentioned bank. 
This plain is terminated on the N. by a range of low hills, cul- 
tivated in mod places half way up to the top ; and, behind 
thefe hills, a fmall part of the parifh runs N. feveral miles, in 
a narrow vale, which yields fome corn, and affords good paf- 
ture for fheep and black-cattle. 

Climate, Difeafes, Fijh £sV. — Within a mile of the fhore, 
which is fandy, the climate is often mild and temperate; while 
.the bank, and the whole tra£t of ground behind it, is cold and 
covered with mow. This, however, is only at intervals, in 
.the winter and fpring feafons j for the difference of climate is 
fcar'cely perceptible during the reft of the year* and it does 
not appear that it makes any material odds as to the health of 
the inhabitants. The air, upon the whole, being very falubri- 
cus, the people in general enjoy good health j and there are 
many inftances of longevity in the parifh. 

There are no rivers or frefh-water lakes in this parifh, ex- 
cepting the fmall river of Balnagown already-mentioned ; in 
which, at certain times of the year, large burn and fea trout 
are found : but, in good fifhing-feafons, the parifh is plentiful- 
ly fupplied with haddocks, cod, fkate, flounders, and cuddies, 
from the Murray-Firth, carried here in bafkets. by the fifhers 
of Fearn and Nigg. There is a bed of fmall cockles within 
the bounds of the parifh, which, in fcarce years, has proved 
very ufeful to the poor people. In 1782, 40 horfe loads have 
been taken out of it in one day. When herrings appear on 
the coaft of Murray, they fometimes come in to the bay and 
firth of Cromarty, and are killed oppofite to this parifh by the 
inhabitants ; though not in fuch quantities as to admit of ex- 
portation.

ly fow no more than is fufficient to fupply their own families 
and, the time of fowing it is from the middle of September to 
the end of November : — rye, oats, and peafe, from the begin- 
ning of March to the middle of April •, barley, flax, and pota- 
toes, from the middle of April till the 20th of May •, arid tur- 
nips from the 1 5 th to the 25 th of June. The harveft general- 
ly begins about the 20th of Auguft, and, in good weather, the 
crop is fecured by the middle of October. 

Improvements.- — It is computed that 300 acres of muir 
ground in this parifh have been brought into culture, within 
the laft 25 years ; partly by mealers, encouraged by the pro- 
prietors, and enticed to build huts on the muir, in the vicini- 
ty of peats and turf,— partly by the molt fubftantial farmers 
■who, as they proceed to inclofe their farms trench the barren 
ground within their lines; and partly by the proprietors, who 
have fet the example before their tenants. The late Admiral 
Sir John Lockhart Rofs added 45 acres of muir ground to the 
policy round the family feat ; a great part of which now 
yields very good corn and grafs. At the expence of L.: 0,000 
fterling, laid out in trenching, building, fencing, &amp;c. in the 
courfe of 25 years, he has greatly beautified the face of the 
country ; and made Balnagown one of the moft defirable feats 
in the north. Immenfe trafts of ground, at proper diftances 
from the houfe, are covered with very thriving plantations of 
fir, or foreft trees ; moft of which were planted by his imme- 
diate predeceflor; and of which his family now begin to reap 
the benefit. Sir Charles Rofs draws upwards of L. 200 an- 
nually from his fir wood in this parifh. Within a mile of 

the houfe of Balnagown, towards the S. and near the fhore, 
lies Ncw-Tarbat, the principal feat of the Earls of Cromarty : 
this place, once the pride of Rofs, both for fituation and po- 
licy, was, during the forfeiture of that family, not only ne- 
glected

glefted, but difmantled of its principal ornaments : the largeft 
foreft trees ever feen in this country were cut down, and fold 
to a company at Leith ; much of the ground within the policy 
was parcelled out in lots to difbanded foldiers and failors ; and 
the mod elegant and beft finifhed houfe in the three counties 
was allowed to fall into ruins. The place however promifes, 
in a few years hence, to recover its antient beauty and gran- 
deur. — The late Lord M'Leod, immediately upon the reftora- 
tion of his eltate, began to extend and inclofe the policy; planted 
many thoufand fore ft and fir trees, which are now in a thriv- 
ing condition ; and built a fuperb houfe upon a modern plan, 
which, in point of elegance and accommodation, is inferior to 
few feats in Scotland. What was left unfinifhed of his lord- 
fhip's plans, are now carried on with attention and tafte by 
Captain Kenneth M'Kenzie, his fucceflbr, and the reprefenta- 
tive of that honourable family. 

Farms and Rent. — The difproportion of farms in this pa- 
rifh is very great ; fome renting 50, fome 100, and fome 150 
acres, while others polTefs no more than from 3 to 1 2. By an 
union of farms that lately took place, many of the fmall te- 
nants were obliged to retire to the wafte grounds, a limited 
portion of which is afligned to each of them by the proprie- 
tors : here they plant potatoes ; and, by induftry and perfeve- 
rance, bring two, three, or more acres to culture, in the 
courfe of 7 years ; during which time, they fit rent-free, ex- 
cepting a fmall acknowledgement in hens and eggs. There is 
no other encouragement given them, excepting an advance of 
20s. to afiift them in building a houfe, the value of which they 
muft leave upon the ground when they remove ; and, if they 
continue in poffeflion after the 7 years are expired, they pay, 
fome lefs and fome more, for every acre in cultivation. 

The valued rent of the parifh is L, 2691 Scotch : the real 

A a 2 rent 



1 8 8 Statljlical Account 

rent does not much exceed L. 1400 fterling. The land next 
the fhore lets at 20s. per acre, and near the village of Miln- 
town 30s. and upwards is paid for fmall lots ; but more remote 
from the fhore, the farmers, on an average, pay no more than 
15s. per acre. — The proprietors begin to fee the advantage of 
granting leafes to their tenants, and to convert the half of the 
vicl.ua! rent into money, at 14s. per boll, including cuftoms 
and fervices. 

Number of Proprietors ; &amp;c. — There are 6 proprietors ; 3 
either occafionally or conftantly refide in the parifh : 15 fmall 
feuars in the village of Milntown, moft of whom have no more 
than \ of an acre each ; 17 larger, and about 40 fmaller te- 
nants ; and a great number of new fettlers, paying from 5s. to 
20s. rent each. There are 4 fhop-keepers, 3 diftillers, 1 2 ma- 
fons, 4 cart wrights, 1 cooper, 6 houfe-carpenters, 4 black- 
fmiths, 1 carpet-weaver, 2 (locking- weavers, 15 common wea- 
vers, 10 taylors, 10 fhoe-makers, and 20 lime-makers. The pa- 
rifh is well fituated for carrying on manufactures of different 
kinds ; but no plan has been hitherto adopted that feems pro- 
mifing of fuccefs in that way. Mr John Montgomery, mer- 
chant in Milntown, has introduced the fpinning of flax among 
the people, and has been pretty fuccefsful for 30 years in that 
branch; fo that all the women, old and young, are become 
dexterous at the fpinning wheel, and have greatly increafed 
their yearly income by it. A flocking manufactory was lately 
introduced to the parifh, under the patronage of Sir John 
Lockart Rofs, which did not meet with that encouragement 
which might be expected. It is now carried on folely by Mr 
Montgomery, who feems to think, that it will not prove a 
profitable trade in this country for fome time. 

?t$uIation*—-lt is certain that the number of inhabitants, 

in 



of Kilmuir Eajier. 



in this parifti, is triple what it was 50 years ago. This in- 
creafe is afcribed to the great extent of improveable wafte 
ground in the parifti, the eafy accefs to fuel, and the encou- 
ragement given by proprietors and tenants to day-labourers 7 
thefe inducements led many emigrants from the Highland pa- 
rifhesto fettle here. And, in the year 1763, the commif- 
fioners for managing the annexed dates, fettled 48 families of 
difbanded foldiers and failors at once in the parifti } allowing 
to each a houfe and three acres of arable land, expecting, that 
in procefs of time thefe families would prove a nurfery for the 
army and navy ; but, in the courfe of 10 years, there remain- 
ed in the parifti no more than 2 families of thefe ftrangers, all 
the reft having deferted their lots, which are now occupied by 
a more induftrious fet of people. 

Population is daily on the increafe. Fifty new houfes have 
been built within the laft four years ; and there is not one un- 
inhabited houfe in the parifti.— By an accurate lift taken in A- 
prillaft, there were then living in the parifh, 1975 perfons : of 
whom, there were,

The great difproportion that appears in this abftraft, arifes 
chiefly from the many emigrant families that fettle yearly in 
the parifh. The great number of burials in 1784 was occa- 
fioned chiefly by the fmall pox ; fince that period, the people 
have been perfuaded to practice inoculation, and they have 
experienced the happy eflfecls of it. 



General Character of the People The people are fober, re- 
gular, and induftrious; though, it is to be lamented, that 
there are many among them whofe morals are corrupted, by 
having too eafy accefs to fpirits, there being upwards of 30 
tippling houfes in the parifh, and only one principal inn ; an 
evil that, (in the opinion of many), might in a great meafure 
he prevented, were the proprietors to make the retail of fpirits 
an irritancy in all the leafes they grant, as nothing would con- 
tribute 

in Scotland in the clofe of the lad century ; and faw a common coffin with 
hinges upon it, made on purpofe for burying the people that perifhed on the 
highways for want of food. He was 65 years an cider of this church. 



of Kilmuir Eqfter. 19I 

tribute more to introduce fobriety among the people, than to 
have the number of whifky retailers circumfcribed. Three re- 
tailing houfes in the parifh would be more than fufficient to 
anfwer all the neceffary demands of the public. But it deferves 
to be remarked, that, notwithftanding the free ufe of fpirits 
among the people, few feuds and quarrels are heard of in the 
parifh. 

Church, Schools, and Poor. The church was built anno 

1621. The ftipend has lately received an augmentation; 

and, with a glebe improved by the prefent incumbent at a 

great expence, is, communibus annls, equal to L. 100. The 

family of Cromarty have been always acknowledged the un- 

difputed patrons. There are 2 fchools in the parifh ; the 

one fupported by the heritors, the other by the Society for 
propagating Chriftian Knowledge. The'parochial fchool has 
no more than 100 merks Scotch for falary ; which, with all 
the fchool dues and emoluments, are not fufficient to provide 
the teacher with the common' neceffaries of life. The Society 
allow L. 13 fterling to the teacher employed by them. There 
are upwards of 1 20 children taught at thefe fchools ; and the 
happy effects, in the manners and morals of the people, ap- 
pear every year more and more confpicuqus. — -r-The Celtic is 
the prevailing language ; but there are very few under 30 years 
of age in the parifh, who do not fpeak both that and Englifli. 

-The average number of poor who now receive alms is 

100. The fum diftributed annually among them feldom ex- 
ceeds L. 15 fterling. This fum arifes partly from the weekly 
collections, and partly by a finall fum eftabliflied in plentiful 
years ; and which lately received an addition of L. 24 fterling, 
the donation of the deceafed Mrs Frafer of Pitcailzien. The 
greateft part of the money, under the management of the fef- 
fion, is appropriated to the relief of poor perfons confined to 
3 the

the bed of ficknefs. The poor, who are able to travel from 
door to door for their fubfiftence, have no more allowed them 
than what will purchafe a pair of (hoes once in the year # . 

Mode of Cultivation. — There are 84 ploughs in the parifii : 
mod of them of the old Scotch conftru&amp;ion, and well adapt- 
ed for the ftony ground. The proprietors, and firft rate farm- 
ers, ufe the Englifh plough, drawn by two horfes 5 and, if 
the land be ftiff, two oxen are commonly yoked after the hor-

* The average price of barley, meal, and peafe, for the laft 15 years, may 
be rated, communiLus ann'u, at ias. 6d. per boll. During that period, vi&amp;ual 
was fold in this parifh for 9s. and ios. — in other years it was fold for 12s. and 
. frequently for 15s. per boll of 9 (tones : oats fold from ios. to ias. per boll j 

potatoes for 8s. and fome years for Ios. per boll. The average price of 

beef, mutton, pork, and veal, from the beginning of Oftober to the firft of 
January, is 3d. for thofe of the beft, and ad. halfpenny for thofe of inferior 
qualities. During the reft of the year, butcher meat, except mutton, gives 
higher prices.— Frefh butter fells for 8d. per lb. 16 ounces; falted butter in 
calks for 12s. per- ftone ; common cheefe 4s. and cheefe of a fuperior quality 
js. and fqmetimes 6s. per ftone : the price of a good hen is 6d. — a duck 8d.— 
a chicken 2d. — eggs id. per dozen. 

The wages of labourers are in proportion to the ftrength and (kill of the 
.perfons employed. Some men get 8d. while others receive no more than 6d. 
per day. The wages of women, efpecially in harveft, are of late years in- 
creafed from 4d. to 6d. per day; out of which they furnilh their own provi- 
fions. The day's pay of a mafon, carpenter, and (later, is from is. 2d to 
is. 6d. per day. Shoe-makers, taylors, and weavers, make their own prices, 
there being no ftandard in the parifh to regulate the value of this work.— Do- 
meftic and farm fervaats have, at an average, L. 3 per annum. Out-fervants 
are allowed L. 3 wages, and 6 bolls meal for maintenance; together with fo 
much arable land, rent-free, as is fufficient to provide 7 or 8 bolls of potatoes, 
afreehoufe, garden, and peats : all which is computed to be worth L. 12 
per annum;— z fuSkiency in this country to enable a careful, fober man, with 
the aftiftance of a virtuous wife, to live more comfortably than many of the 
farmers, and to rear a family of children till they are of age to work for the* 
bread.

fes.— If thefeafon is favourable, moll of the ftrongeft land is 
ploughed in the months of O&amp;ober, November, and Decem- 
ber. The rotation commonly obferved of late, by the prin- 
cipal farmers, is, to fow barley and grafs feeds after the 
land has been prepared by green crops ; and, after refting for 
two or three years, the fame field is ploughed up again in the 
month of Auguft, with a rich foggage, which in a great mea- 
fure fupplies the want of manure ; and yields the firft year a 
good crop of barley, the next a crop of oats, and the third 
year, a crop of peafe, potatoes, or turnips, which prepares it 
for laying down again with barley and grafs feeds. By this 
mode, the land is always kept clean, and in good condition. 
But it muft be remarked, that though this be thejnoft approved 
plan, few in the parifti have hitherto followed it. The people 
in general, however, begin to fee the advantage of fowing 
grafs feeds, and of adhering to a regular rotation of crops ; 
and it is very probable that the practice will prevail univerfal- 
ly in the courfe of a few years. The fheep farming lately in- 
troduced into this country, will foon compel the people to fow 

confiderable quantities of grafs feeds. Formerly, they got 

molt of their cattle grazed on the neighbouring hills, at the rate 
of i8d. per head, for 4 or 5 months of the year : thefe hills 
are now covered with fheep ; and the low country farmer muft 
reduce his ftock of black-cattle, in proportion to the grafs he 
can raife annually upon his farm. 

Produce — The vegetable productions of the parifli have alrea- 
dy been fpecified. About two-thirds of the barley is diftilled 
in this and the neighbouring parifhes into whilky ; and nearly 
the fame proportion of oats and oat-meal is bought up by.com- 
miflion, and carried to market ; — fo that the produce of the 
panfh is much more than fufficient for the confumpt of the in- 
habitants.- With refpedt to animal productions, it is com- 

' Vol. VI. E b puted 



194 Statijlical Account 

puted that there are about 800 black-cattle, 300 horfes, ani 
about 900 fheep in the parifh. A third of the black cattle, are 
"what is commonly called here, true Highlanders ; the reft 
either have been introduced into the parifh from Fife and Aber- 
deen, or are a crofs breed between thefe and the Highland 
bull : thefe laft are by far the beft cattle in the parifh, and by 

all appearance will prevail The breed of horfes has been 

greatly improved of late years ; but the fmall hardy Highland 
breed are ftill preferred by perfons who have but fmall lots of 
land, becaufe they are eafily fupported. — The {heep are all of 
the fmall country breed, except a few large ones kept by gen- 
tlemen within their policy. The deer, in winter and fpring, 

vifit the heights of this parifh. There are many foxes and 
hares ; and fome badgers and otters. — Moft of the fea fowls 
known in Scotland frequent the fhore in great numbers, parti- 
cularly in ftormy and fevere winters. In the inland and High- 
land parts of the parifh, there is a great variety of game : muir- 
fowl, black-cock, wood-cock, wood-pigeon, curlew, plover, Sec. 
but, though all thefe are inhabitants of the parifh, it is proper 
to obferveji that there are not many of each kind*. 

Mifcell-aneous 

* The only remains of antiquity that flood in this parifh, were laft year re- 
moved. In the place of Delny, once a principal feat of the Earls of Rofs, 
flood the ruins of a Romifh chapel on a pleafant bank, furrounded with graves. 
This fpot has been deferted as a burying place for many years ; and the pre- 
fent farmer (not adverting to the impropriety of fuch a meafure) carried away 
all the ftones to build his farm houfes, and the rubbi/h to meliorate his land ; 
and ploughed up the burying ground, with an intention to make it an addition 
to a corn field. The prefent incumbent, having heard of this fpecies of facri- 
lege, vifited the fpot, and found it covered with the bones of the dead, turned 
up with the plough. The indelicacy of his conduct was reprefented to the farrn- 
er ; and he was perfuaded to collect the reliques, and to depofit them again in 
the earth ; and he' folemnly engaged to draw lines rou*jd the facred fpot, to

grafs feeds, and never more to difturbthe manes of his fathers. 

In the vicinity of this chapel is an eminence, called Cnoi: an tdgaiH, or 
Priefthill. Near this place flood the remains of a crofs, at the extremity of a 
fmall village. Thither all the people belonging to the barony of Delny, which 
comprehended a great part of the county of Rofs, reforted once in the year, 
to pay homage to their fuperior. Here alfo the barons held their criminal 
courts; and, if tradition can be credited, the punifhment inflicted upon crimi- 
nals was, to hang the men and drown the women. Correfpondfrig to this 
tradition, there is a hill within a computed mile of Delny, called Cnot nacrokb^ 
or Gallows-hill ; and on the fummit of this hill is a circular pool of water, ma- 
ny fathoms deep, called Psul a bhaidh, or the Drowning-pooL 

In the year 1 751, as labourers were digging a bank of earth near the village 
ef Milntown, they found 4 (tones Handing erect in the earth, and forming a 
circle. Here the men looked for a treafure : and; after having with much at- 
tention opened the earth, they found a human Ikeleton, fitting in an erect pof- 
ture, on a feat feemingly made for that purpofe; Many credible perfons 
now living, authenticate this as a fact known to themfelves. Tradition fays, 
that feveral perfons have been buried alive in this and the neighbouring parifh* 
by the direction of a cruel and arbitrary landlord, who was proprietor of thefe 
lands in the beginning of laft century. 

Till of late years, little barrows or tiimuli in the parifh, were avoided by 
the people with particular caution^ The tradition regarding them is, that 
the plague had once made great ravages in this country, and that all who died 
of this difeafe were buried under thefe tumuli. Such was the terror of the 
people for the plague/that they would not fo much as tread upon one of them, 
or fuffer their horfes or carriages to touch them. So late as 1768, one of thefe 
tumuli, not much larger than a cart load of earth, was left an impediment on 
the middle of the road, at the principal entry of the village of Milntown ; and 
no argument could prevail with the inhabitants to remove it. At length, a 
certain perfon, who wifhed to undeceive the people, and cure them of their 
prejudices, undertook to remove this little barrow ; and, while he was thus 
difplaying his courage, the whole inhabitants of the village furrounded him, 
difliiading him from the dangerous undertaking, and looking every moment 
far his falling down dead before them : he lives, however, to this day, after

one another. Thefe have been hitherto kept in good repair 
bythe ftatute-labour ; but it is propofed to convert the ftatute- 
labour into money ; and, if that plan is adopted, time will 
difcover whether it will, or will not, prove advantageous to the 

inhabitants and to the public There are three bridges 

in the parifli. Two of them are built over the water of 
Balnagown ; the other over a river into which the fea flows 
at ftream tides, and which, before this bridge was built in 
1789, proved'very inconvenient to travellers. 

There is an extenfive level bed of fhells, of diverfe kinds, 
in the fands of New-Tarbat and Nigg, chiefly the property of 
the family of Cromarty, and manufactured into lime by perfons 
trained up to the bufmefs from their infancy. There are 20 
men, with their wives and children, who are employed in this 
trade. At full fea, they go from the fhore in boats, caft an- 
chor over the bed of fhells, and remain there till the fea ebbs j 
then all hands begin to dig up the fhells and freight the boats ; 
and they are ready by the time of flood to return to the fhore: 
this is attempted only in the fummer feafon. The lime ma- 
nufactured from thefe fhells is reckoned an excellent cement 
for building, and is peculiarly adapted for plaiftering, and finifh- 
cd work. There are 8 boats in the parrfh ; 5 of which are 
employed in the lime trade for 3 or 4 months : during the 
reft of the year, they either fifh on the neighbouring coafts r 
or are employed in carrying corn and peats to the oppofite 
fhore.

<p>

Name, Extent, Surface, tsfc. 
'THHE parifh has probably taken its name from a caftle, ths 
ruins of which are ft ill to be feen upon the margin of the 
fea, not above 100 yards diftant from the church, and to 
which the church had been a chapel. There are alfo the re* 
mains of a religious houfe, called St Army's kill, at the N. 
corner of the farm garden, in a ftraight line betwixt the church, 
which may be fuppofed to have furnifhed clergy to the chapel. 
There is a fmall head-land, about 200 yards N. E, of the caf- 
tle, which might have given rife to the name. Hiftory does not 
mention by whom the caftle was built, or the church endowed. 
There is a vulgar tradition, that the former was erected by one 
of our kings of the name of Kenneth, and was a royal reG- 
dence. — The church is about 2 miles N. E. from the burgh of 

Btrvie. The parifh extends along the fea-coaft, from the 

mouth of the river Bervie northward, about the fpace of 5 
miles. — There are in the parifh many rifing grounds or fmall 
2 hills, 



198 Statiftical Account 

hills, moftly covered with heath ; wherein is to be be found a 
coarfe (tone with arotten furface,at a fmall depth under ground. 
The foil, particularly along the coaft, is a fine rich loam mix- 
ed with clay; yielding plentiful crops of wheat, barley, beans, 
peafe, and fown grafs, when improved in the modern man- 
ner, by fallow, draining and lime. The higher grounds at 
fome diftance from the coaft, yield good crops of oats, bear, 
peafe, turnip, and grafs: and the induftrious farmer, by ju- 
dicious management, here finds his labour well rewarded 

As the parifh lies high, without lochs or fwamps, the air is 
very healthy. 

Rivers, Sea-CqaJ}, and Minerals There are only 2 or 3 

fmall rivulets in the parifh ; which, by means of dams, make 
a fliift to turn water mills, principally in the winter feafon. 
—The more, which bounds the parifh on the E. for about e 
miles, as mentioned above, is bold and rocky ; the tide'reach- 
es the foot of the rock, which rifes abruptly from 20 to 60 
yards in perpendicular height. The rock is for the moft part 
of the peafe-porridge or plum-pudding kind ; and is thought 
to have the appearance of lava. The foundings all along the 
coaft, at 100 yards or lefs from the fhore, are from 8 to 13 
or 14 fathoms. . There are no rocks which, cannot be feen at 
low water.— The ftrata of the rocks dip to the S. W. from 30 

to 40 degrees. The bold (hore, leaving only a fmall fpace 

of the rocky bottom uncovered at low water, but a fmall quan- 
tity of kelp, perhaps only 4 or 5 tons annually, is made in this 
parifti ; and, for the fame reafon, the fea-ware is of little be- 
nefit. The beft creek in the parifh is at Gaterline, belong- 
ing to the Vifcount Arbuthnott, which has two boats ; and, 
if fome money were laid out in railing a fmall pier at this 
town, where there is a good fituation for it, it would afford a 
convenient and fafe harbour for coaftersof 30 CT4C tons burden; 

and

and a good fituation for a village, for the accommodation of 
tradefmen and manufacturers, might be had in the neighbour- 
hood. The great quantity of corn fold annually by the farm- 
ers would be of advantage to fuch a village. — The next place 
of refidence for white-fimers is Gap-hill, about half a mile S. 
of Caterline. It formerly had two boats, now it has only one, 
and lies in a fmall bay, on the north fide of the Tod-head, 
called Braddan-bay. This bay is about 100 yards in ex- 
tent, with a rocky bottom, and gravelly beach, where fmall 

barks in fummer unload lime, coals, &amp;c There are no 

quarries except the fea-rocks above mentioned. They make a 
ftrong, durable, ftraight wall, but are rather too hard for hew- 
ing. Thefe rocks have been ufed for mill-ftones, and are in 
great repute for that purpofe. 

Population — In 1755, the number of fouls was 858. They 
have fince increafed ; for, by a very accurate vifitation-roll 
lately taken up, it contains about 1000 fouls. There is neither 
town nor village, nor 6 families dwelling together, (the fea- 
towns of Gap-hill and Caterline excepted), in all the parifh.

account, there may be 30 or 40 baptifms, through the care- 
lefihefs of the parents and church officer, neglected to be re- 

giftered in the above period. The yearly average of burials 

for 6 years, preceding 1790, is 14^. 

There are 8 heritors in the parifh. The number of farmers 
is about 35 ; whereof 12 poffefs pretty extenfive farms, paying 
from L. 280 down to L. 70 of yearly rent; and the fmaller 
farmers pay from L.70 to L.io. — There are alfo about 150 fa- 
milies, or houfes where families live. The number of white- 
fiihers, both old and young, in the fea-towns, is about 18. 
There are as many houfe- carpenters, joiners, taylors, and o- 
ther artificers, as are needful for the ordinary fupply of the 
parifh. There are alfo about 20 weavers ; who are principal- 
ly employed in manufacturing facking and ticking, which are 
the ordinary clothes made for fale in this parifh. 

All the inhabitants are of the Eftablifhed church, except 2 
meri and 4 women Scotch Epifccpals, and one man and his 
wife of the Englifh church. , 

The number of families is thought to be confiderably fmall- 
er than it was about 20 years ago. The reafon given for this 
is, that fince improvements in agriculture began, fome of the 
farmers occupy more land than their predecefibrs ; for they 
think a fmall farm will not defray the expence of manage- 
ment. For this land they pay a very confiderably advanced 
rent, and are at a much more confiderable expence in improv- 
ing it. This farmer, therefore, cannot let a fmall parcel of 
Isnd, and keep a cow, to a tradefman or mechanic, upon terms 
near fo low as formerly. The tradefman grudges to pay what 
the farmer thinks his accommodation worth. The confequence 
is, the tradefman retires to a town or village, and the farmer 
tills his own fields, and this, perhaps, is for their mutual 
comfort and advantage : the farmer, however, will always 
give encouragement to ground-labourers, becaufe they are ne-

^tfliiry to htm.— Every healthy pcrfon who is willing to work, 
and is a good economift, will earn food and clothing here.- — ■ 
The parifh has had no emigrants, nor need any of the people 
remove for want of employment. 

Cattle, Horfes, and Sheep.~-The parifh rears a confiderable 
number of black-cattle. ; many more now than formerly. The 
great advance of price induces the farmer to rear 4 times the 
number of calves which he raifed 15 or 20 years ago : and his 
improved land enables him to feed them on fown grafs and tur- 
nips, until they are from 2 to 3 years old. He then finds a 
ready marker, and good prices, from his fouthern neighbours. 
Cattle dealers from England are alfo fometimes feen in the 
markets. 

The horfes have for fome time paft (fince it became cuftom- 
ary to perform all the labour with thefe animals) been brought 
from the fouth and weft country, becaufe the native breed were 
not of fufficient fize. The farmers nowbeginto rearhorfesfit for 
their own work, and find their account in fo doing : this alfo 
is a confequence of having improved their land. Some of the 
farmers perform part of their labour with large oxen, harnef- 
fed in the fame manner as horfes, and think they profit by 
this mode of working them. For bringing the practice of 
working oxen in this way to the higheft perfedion, the farm- 
er ; are indebted to Lord Monboddo, who wifhes to give coun- 
tenance and encouragement to every ufeful improvement in a- 
griculture. He was the firft perfon we know of, who had a 
pair of oxen trained to go in the wheel-plough and cart in the 
fame manner as horfes ; and he had the fatisfaftion to find 
Slat they performed their work equally well. 

There are no fheep, notwithstanding of the wafteheathswhich 
were divided, about a dozen years ago, among the proprietors 
Clf land. Perhaps, when the lands are all improved, and be- 

Vol. VI. C c

202 Statiftical Account 

gin to be exhaufted by crops of grain, the farmers may 
think of cultivating the breed of this very ufeful and profitable 
animal ; and the moors will then become ufeful by fupplying 
them with heath and whins. 

Contents, Cultivation, Zzfc. — From an accurate furvey and 
exact map of the county, publifhed in the year 1774 by Mr 
William Garden, it appears that the parifh contains 5043 
Scotch, or 6408 Englifh acres. Perhaps about one-half, or 
rather nearly two thirds are arable. 

It has been already obferved, that the parifh may be divided 
into coaft-fide and upper lands. The prefent port road near- 
ly forms the line of this partition Thefe two divifions are not 
fo different in foil as they are in fituation and climate. The mode 
of cultivation may therefore be nearly the fame, but the pro- 
duce is different. It may alfo be proper to remark, that the fi- 
tuation, from being extended along the coaft, affords eafy accefs 
to lime brought by fea. The farmers find no difficulty in getting 
fmall barks to run a-fhore on the beach, at two or three places 
where there is accefs for carts; and, by thefe means, get 
as much lime as is neceffary at a fhort diftance from their land. 
Of this manure they have at length learned to make the pro- 
per ufe. They fallow, clean, level, ftraighten, and drain their 
fields, and then put lime on them in proportion to the qua- 
lity of the foil To ftrong land, they give from 40 to 7p 

bolls of lime fhells to the Scotch acre, which boll contains 
32 Scotch pints to the firlot ; and, to land that is lighter, from 
from 30 to 40 bolls per acre are allowed— To the ftrong land 
in the neighbourhood of the coaft thus managed, the farmer 
adds from 40 to 50 cart loads of dung to the acre. He then lays 
it down with wheat : his fecond crop is hoed beans or turnips -, 
and his third barley or bear, and grafs feeds. The high lands 
o and 



•/ Kimieff. 2o5 

arid light foils, after being drefled in a fimilar manner, carry 
good crops of turnips, barley or bear, oats, peafe, and grafs. 

Produce. — Crops of wheat yield from 46 to 50 Winchefter 
bufliels per acre ; and the fubfequent crops of beans, barley, 
or bear, on ftrong land, produce nearly the fame quantity. 
On the higher grounds' and light foils, the firft crops of oats 
and bear, after thorough drefling, are nearly the fame in quan- 
tity with thofe already mentioned.— It may farther be remark- 
ed, that the beft and moft experienced farmers arc of opini- 
on, chat it is for their intereft to have at leaft one-half of their 
arable land (or perhaps more) in fallow, grafs, and green crop. 
—All the farmers raife turnips for their cows and young cat- 
tle ; and they in general are of opinion, that this is a more 
profitable way of ufing turnips than to feed cattle for the butch- 
er. Cabbages in the field have been tried ; but cattle always 
prefer turnips when they can get them. The only advantage 
of cabbage is, that in time of very deep fnow, or hard froft, 
they may be got when turnips cannot be had. 

From the account given of the number of inhabitants, the 
mode of cultivation, and the returns the land makes, it is evi- 
dent the farmers raife much more grain, and many more black- 
cattle, than can be confumed in the parifh. What grain and 
meal are fold from the middle and fouth part of the county, find 
in general a ready market at Bervie, Johnfhaven, and Mon- 
trofe ; being fent from thefe places by the canal to the weft 
country. The farmers have, for fome years paft, regretted the 
failure of the Firth diftillers, as the great confumers of their 
bear and barley. The north part of the parifh and county, 
end what grain they have to fpare to Stonehaven and Aber- 
deen. The parifh may annually export about 4500 bolls of 
grain, and about 300 black-cattle.-Several attempts have been

made to raife flax ; but not with much fuccefs, as the people 
do not underftand the management of it*. 

Rent The valued rent of the whole parifh amounts to 

L. 4309 : 19 Scotch money ; and the real rent may be at pre- 
fent about L. 2000 fterling, including farm vidtual. The 
rent has been riling for thefe 20 years paft. Of late it has 
rifen aftonifhingly. For example, an eftate in this parifh was 
lately bought for L. 7000 that 25 years ago was offered to be 
fold for 2000 guineas: that eftate, however, nowpays nine t ; mes 
the rent it paidat that period. Another eftate has been latelyfold 
for L. 4300, which, not above 30 years ago, was bought for 
little more than L. 750: and feveral farms in this parifh pay 
now three times as much rent as they paid 7 years ago. This 
rapid advance of the value of land may be chiefly owing to the 
eafy accefs to lime, which is the firft great mean of improve- 
ment ; and alfo, to the fuperior fkill the farmers have acquired 
in the management of their ground, which makes them more 

induftrious and enterprifing than they formerly weref.

they do not want /kill and inclination fo much as they want flock to enable 
them to profit by his example and inftructions. This want, he with- his u- 
fual good fenfe and difcernment, has, to his own tenants in a great meafure. 
fupplied. For to them he has let his unimproved lands at a moderate rent ; 
he has laid down a plan for the improvement and after management of their 
farms, which they are bound to abide by ; and to fuch of them as need it, he 
has advanced the means of improvement for two or three years, intereft free. 
By that time the produce of the drefTed fields, upon which the money has 
been laid out, enables the poiTefTor to repay the proprietor his advance. Mr 
Barclay has alfo built comfortable dwelling houfes and convenient offices upon 
all his farms. Thus are all his tenants enabled to carry on their improvements 
much/ farter than if they had not thefe advantages. They live comfortably while 
they are doing fo : when the greatefl part of their ground is improved they begin 
to fare money ; and, by the time their prefent leafes expire, they themfelves 
will offer (if not double rent) a very great advance for the farms, they occupy. 

Were the landholders, efpecially in the north of Scotland, to follow the a- 
bove or a fimilar plan, their tenants would be enabied fooner to improve their 
grounds, to live better than they do at prefent, and the proprietors in the. 
end mull be very confiderable gainers by the bargain. 

* Beft men-fervants who live in the family, receive 6 guineas, a year; fe- 
cond fort, 5 ; and, to thofe who are capable of overfeeing and directing the o- 
perations of a farm, as well as working themfelves, the farmers give L. 10 a . 
year. The women-fervants get from jos. to 60s. a year. . The wheel plough, 
the chain, the Lothian, and double moulded ploughs are ufed. A labouring 
fervant, when married, commonly gets from hi* matter -a houfe and a fmall 
piece of garden ground : he alfo gets his fuel brought to his houle ; fix pounds 
or 6 guineas per annum, of wages ; and a ftone 0 f oat-meal per week for his 
maintenance. If his matter keep a cow for him he pays him 40s. a year for 
doing fo.— The wages of men-labourers are 6d. fterling per day and victuals, 
from Candlemas to Michaelmas; from that time until Candlemas again, 4 d.

Haddocks give now fix times their former price ; and, after

cannot live by it. They alfo complain of the hardfihips they

veft, they generally give from a guinea to 25s. — and women hired in that way 
get from 16s. to 20s — for this they become bound to aflift in down-cutting, in- 
gathering, and thatching all the crop. The wages of a taylor are 8d. — a 

carpenter 8d. — and a mafon is. ad. with victuals. The wages of all thefe 
have been raifed within thefe 7 years. If a labouring man luckily marry an 
induftrious well managing woman, and is fober himfelf, they may live and 
bring up a family with fome degree of comfort, efpecially if they have faved a- 
ny money before marriage ; which, we are forry to fay, is feldom the cafe : — 
for the women generally fpend as much upon fine clothes, and the men upon 
fine clothes and drink before marriage, as would greatly aflift them when they 
have more need of it to fupport themfelves and children.

the latter 3s. per boll of 24 ftones. Twenty years ago, the 
farmers brought peat and turf from the hill mofles, at 12 
miles diftance, and were thus employed during the whole fum- 
mer. It is no wonder, therefore, that rents were then low : 
but, as that feafon is now employed in the cultivation of their 
.lands, they find themfelves reduced to the neceffity of burning 
coal fires ; and few of them regret the change. They, however, 
complain of the heavy duty on Scotch coals- as a hindrance to 
agriculture, and a grievous burden on manufactures, and poor 
people of all denominations. There are ftill fome broom and 
whins on the dry wafte grounds, which the poor people grub 
up for prefent ufe in fummer. 

Stipend, School, and Poor. — The value of the living, includ- 
ing the two glebes of Kinneff and Caterline, may be about 
L. 80 fterling ; and there has been no augmentation fince the 

year 1650 * -The fchoolmafter has a falary of 200 m'erks 

Scotch, by decreet. — The church and manfe were built in 

1738, and both repaired in 1784 The average number of 

poor upon the roll, who regularly receive alms, may be 1 5. 
The feflion, moreover, give occafional fupplies to induftrious 

houfe-holders 

• In the year 1709, the parifh of Caterline was re-annexed to the parifh 
ft Kinneff, it havingbeenformerly a part of that parilh, by which the living was 
encreafed 300 merks Scotch. The parifh of Bervie of old made a part of the 
Parifh of Kinneff :_For, by a decree of the Lords Commiffioners for tiends, 
in 1608, the parifh of Bervie is decerned to remain a part of the parifh of 
Kinneff; and, becaufe there was no bridge on the river of Bervie, the minif- 
ter of Kinneff agreed to keep a fuffragan minifter at Bervie! In 1650, the 
heritors agreed to augment the minifter of Bervie's ftipend, and alio the fti. 
pend of Kinneff ; becaufe the minifter of the latter had given all that part of 
his ftipend, which was paid out of the lands on the S. fide of the river Bervie, 
and L. 47 Scotch more, to the fuffragan of Bervie. This was the laft £u&amp; 
mentation of the fti pen d of Kinneff, and it left the living lefs than before.

the rents of fome feats in the church, which belong to the 
poor, and alfo the interefl of L. 150 fterling at 4^ per cent. 
may amount to L. 25 fterling. An annual collection, amount- 
ing to about L. 3 fterling is made for the infirmary of Aber* 
deen. There the fick and infirm parifhioners are received, 
upon bringing a recommendation from the feffion ; and they 
have the benefit of lodgings, board, and medicines, until they 
are either cured, or found to be incurable*.

* There are no remains of religious houfes but St. Arnty's kill ; probably 
St Arnold's cell, already mentioned as (landing between the church and the 
cadle ; and the remains of a fmall chapel upon Kingorny, faid to be ereaed 
upon the very fpot where King David Bruce, landing from France in 134a, 
with his queen and retinue, had high mafs performed for his return : and it 
is thought to have been a royal chapel for fome time after. Near the caflle of 
Kinneff, and beyond a fmall headland about 100 paces N. E. there are to be 
feen the remains of an old work, upon the top of a peninfular rock, called the 
caftle of Cadden. It feems to have had a ditch and draw-bridge to proteft it 
from an attack by land, where there remain fome veftiges of mafonry ; the reft 
feems to have been an earthen mound thrown up about the top of the rock. 
About aoo paces farther N. E. is another peninfular rock, having the remains 
Of a draw-bridge to the land f.de ; upon the top of this rock are ftill extant 
the remains of a fmall houfe and other buildings, faid to have been inhabited 
by a private gentleman, about 150 years ago ; and is named the caftle of 
Vhiftleberry. And, about zoo paces N. E. from this faift mentioned caftle, 
are the remains of a third ftrong hold, very much like the firft in every re- 
fpet% btt much larger. It is called Adam's caftle. With reM to the caf- 
tle of Cadden and Adam's caftle there are no traditionary accounts. 

Perhaps it may not be improper here to mention, that in l6ja, when the 
caftle of Dunnottar was befieged by Major General Morgan, commander for 
the $A0 parliament, the regalia of Scotland were brought from thence 
to KinnefT, where they were kept until the reflation by Mrs Chnfhan 
Fletcher, the wife of Mr Granger, then minifter of KinnerT. 0: this or- 
cumftancc tradition gives the following account, vb. Mrs Granger, attended 



of Kinneff. 209 

MifceUantous Remarks. — The famous Dr John Arbuthnott, 
intimate friend of Pope and Swift, and phyfician to Queen 
Anne, lived for fome time in this parifh. His father, the mi- 
nifter of Arbuthnott, was, at the Revolution, turned out of 
his living by his chief and patron, Lord Arbuthnott, who was 
then a very keen partizan upon which, he retired to his own 
property of Kingorny,- where he lived for fbme time, having 
his fon, the Doctor, a young man, along with him. 

Since improvements in agriculture and manufactures have 
Vol. VI. D d begun 

by a maid-fcrvant, having been at Stonehaven, on her return, afked leave of 
the general to vifit Mrs Ogilvie, wife of Mr George Ogilvie, who then com- 
manded the caftle : this leave flie obtained ; and, on her return, brought the 
crown royal in her lap ; the general himfelf fet her on the horfe, and the maid 
who attended her brought away the fword and fceptre on her back in a bag of 
flax. The regalia were kept fometimes In the church of Kinneff, concealed 
under the pulpit, and at other times in a double bottomed bed in the manfe, 
till the Reftoration in 1660, when they were delivered to Mr George Ogilvie, 
whoreftored them. For this good fervice Mr Ogilvie was made a baronet \ 
and Sir John Keith, brother to the Earl Marifchal, was created Earl of Kin- 
tore ; but honeft Mr Granger and his wife had neither honour nor reward. 

Four or five years ago, in digging a grave for Lady Ogilvie of Barras, in the 
church of Kinneff, there was found, buried in an earthen pot, about a pound 
and a half of old filver coins. They were almoft all of one fize, about 
the breadth of fixpence ; a few about half that fize ; and all bore ei- 
ther the impreffion of Edward of England, or of Alexander of Scotland. The 
impreflion and legend on the Scotch coins are much better executed than on the 
Englifh. It is likely this trcafurc might have been laid where it was found, a- 
bout the year 1336, when the Englifh garrifon occupied the caftle of Kinneff: 

There was a tumulus or cairn, upon St John's hill in this parilh, opened a- 
bout 30 years ago : in the bottom of which, a little und«r the furface of the 
ground, were found three long flat (tones, one of them covering the other 
two and having a (horter one at each end. In this was contained nearly a cart- 
load of rich black earth ; having a mixture of half burnt bones, and bits of 
oak charcoal, without any kind of urn. There are other tumuli in the pa-

begun to ftimulate induftry, the mode of living among our 
people is very much changed. They are much better lodged, 
fed, and clothed, than they were 20 years ago. A joint of 
meat, and a kan of punch after it, will be feen on every 
farmer's table in the parifti, when a friend comes to dine with 
him. 

As this part of the coaft lies at fome diftance from any fta- 
tion of excife or cuftom-houfe officers, it has been long famous, 
or rather infamous, for fmuggling. By this the morals of the 
people are confiderably hurt, as they often meet with temp- 
tations to drunkennefs, theft, and perjury, in the courfe of 
that bufmefs. This illicit traffic has, however, confiderably 
declined on this coaft of late, owing to the fuccefsful vigilance 
of the cruizers appointed for that purpofe. 

The public and private roads in this parifh are very indiffe- 
rent. The poll-road from Bervie to Stonehaven goes through 
it for more than four miles. But we are forry to fay that here, 
as in many other places, the ftatute-labour ^as it is applied) 
has been found inadequate to produce the intended effeffc. 
The gentlemen of the county convinced of this, intend ap- 
plying to Parliament, to authorize them to commute the ftar 
tute-labour, or eftablifh turnpikes. The general voice of the 
county is in favour of the firft. 

There are few inclofures, and thofe only of earth, which is 
found to anfwer the purpofe only for a fliort time. No ftones 
can be got but from quarries at an immenfe expence ; and the 
parifti being much expofed to the fea, thorns are prevented 
from growing. The farmers are fo much convinced of the 
advantages of inclofing, that they would give from 5 s. to 7 s. 
an acre for effe&amp;ing it. 

In 1782, the crop in the pariffi was not fufficient to main- 
tain its inhabitants, though grain is the ftaple of this diftria. 
The fcarcity began to be felt feverely about the end of May 

l 



of Kinneff. 2IX 

1783 ; and, had not a confidence importation taken place 
the effects muft have been dreadful. A benevolent foole- 
ry, under the patronage of Mr Barclay of Ury, was form* 
ed at Stonehaven, for purchafmg meal and grain to be retailed 
at an under price in that town and the neighbourhood, of which 
this parim felt the good effeds. There were fome hundred 
pounds loft, (if money.funk on fuch an emergency can be called 
a lofs), which Mr Barclay generoufly paid, partly Gut of his 
own pocket, andjpartly by donations from his friends in Lon- 
don, given for that purpofe.— The well-meant fupply gifted by 
Government came at leaft fix weeks too late to give the intend- 
ed relief. There were bear-meal and potatoes of crop 1783 
before it came to hand. It, moreover, confifted of very bad 
meal, made of damaged peafe and bear ground together. From 
the latencfs of its coming, and the badnefs of its quality (as 
famine only could have compelled the people to eat it) fome are 
induced to think that the merchants were the greateft, if not 
the only gainers. Had Government, inftead of fending meal, 
ordered the fum they voted to be paid to the feveral kirk-feffions 
in due proportions, the Scotch merchants would have fuppli- 
ed the parifh with good grain or meal (when moftly needed) 
for the money. 

There are no forefts and very little planted wood of any 
kind ; neither will wood thrive, owing to the eaftern expofure, 
and the height of the land.

PARISH OF <name ref="NA">LEOCHEL</name> 

(presbytery of alford, synod and county of

$y the Rev. Mr. George Forbes..</head> 

<p>

L 



Name, Extent, Surface, &amp;c. 
EOCHEL, or Leath-chuil, is of Celtic extraaion ; and 
fignifies the " half of Coul," which is the name of a 
contiguous parifh, defcribed in Vol. III. There is a tradition, 
that Patrick Forbes, Bifhop of Aberdeen, annexed his lands 
of Corfe in the parifh of Coul to the parifh of Leochel quoad fa- 
cra, about the beginning of the 17th century. But the inha- 
bitants of Corfe pay the ftipend affeaing thefe lands to the 
minifter of Coul ; though, for time immemorial, they have 
been under the care of the minifter of Leochel, and received 
church-benefits from him. 

The parifh of Leochel, including the eftate of Corfe, is an 
acute-angled triangle, with the acute angle to the eaft, about 
5 Englifh miles long, and 4 broad. 

There are 3 rivulets in this parifh, which join at the 
north fide, and form what is commonly called the water of 
Leochel, which empties itfelf into the river Don, a little be- 



of Leochel. 213 

low the church of Alford, 27 miles weft from Aberdeen. 
Thefe abound in fine trout ; and, in the water of Leochel, 
filmon are feen in the fpawning feafon. 

The general appearance of the parifh is hilly ; but none of 
the hills are high except the hill of Corfe. AH of them are cover- 
ed with heather ; and fome abound in game of various kinds. 
Hares are very numerous. 

Climate, Soil, Produce, CsV. — The climate is healthy ; and 
many of the natives live to a good old age, notwithftanding 
the dampnefs and wetnefs of the low grounds. — The princi- 
pal diftempers are thofe of the fcrophulous kind, confumption, 

gravel, and rheumatifm. The foil where the ground is 

low is a ftrong clay, and uncommonly free of (tones. The 
high arable land is a good mellow foil of a fine grey colour. 
When properly manured and laboured, both produce good 
crops. The dry ground anfwers well with liming and watering. 
The country in general is rather late, efpecially when a rainy 
fpring retards the fowing. The fown grafs anfwers well ; but, 
where the ground is wet, the red clover foon wears out. The 
natural grafs on the low grounds, by the fides of the rivulets, 
is exceedingly good. The farmers fow corn and bear, a few 
peafe, and feldom any wheat. Some potatoes are alfo planted ; 
and the people begin to fow fmall pieces of ground with grafs 
and turnips, the advantages of which they are fenfible of. In 
a few years, it is hoped, they will be more reconciled to that 
practice. The inhabitants live upon meal, potatoes, tur- 
nips, and greens, feldom ufing any flefh. They have fowls, 
butter, and cheefe in abundance. 

■Agriculture and Rent. — The people in general are not very 
induftrious ; and are far from the means of improving their 
ground. No marie of any kind has been found in the parifh j 

and 



2 14 Statijlical Account 

and no lime is to be had within 1 2 or 14 miles. Some of the 
molt induftrious and fubftantial tenants now begin to carry 
lime-fhells from Aberdeen, which are brought thither from 
Sunderland and the Firth of Forth. The meafure contains 32 
Scotch pints to the firlot ; 4 of which make a boll. The Scotch 
lime is fold from 2s. 3d. to 2s. 6d. and the Englifh from 2s. 8d. 
to 3 s. per boll ; 22 of which are fumcient for an acre of light 
ground ; and clay ground will require from 20 to 26. Lime 
anfwers as well with the foil, and raifes as good crops, as in 
any other part of the country. 

Mr David Scot of Craigivar, the moft opulent, intelligent, 
and induftrious farmer in this parifh, has expended L. 50 
fterling yearly, for 5 years paft, upon lime brought from 
Aberdeen ; and, notwithftanding the long carriage, (28 miles) 
finds his intereft greatly promoted by it. He farms the Mains 
of Craigivar, confiding of 166 acres of good arable land, which 
he has inclofed, improved, and properly fubdivided with ftone 
and earth fences, and planted fome thorns which thrive very 
well, without gathering mofs or fog. The bottom of thefe 
inclofures is warned by one of the rivulets, which turns 5 
corn-mills, I barley-mill, and 2 fulling-mills. If the te- 
nants were induftrious, many of them have great command of 
water for manure ; which, when put upon dry out-field land 
and properly attended to in the fpreading, and removal from 
place to place upon the ground, (which fome are now begin- 
ning to do), raifes as good crops, both of corn and fown grafs, 
as lime can poflibly produce. 

There is a great deal of out-field in the parifh, when com- 
pared with the in town ground. The in-field is conftantly in 
tillage. The out-field is manured with cattle and fheep kept 
in folds in the fummer feafon ; bears five crops of corn, and 
is as long refted •, but carries little or no grafs. The acre of 
in-field is commonly let at from 13s. 4*. to 20s, and the out- 
field 



of Leochel. lie; 

field from 2s. f5d. to 3s. 6d. per acre. The rents are paid at 4 
terms in the years, partly in money and partly in meal ; and 
the tenants are obliged to carry their farm-meal to Aberdeen, 
or the like diftance. There are no difcretionary fervices ex- 
acted. The tenants are in their tacks taken bound for a few 
fervices ; one half of which are feldom required, and no mo- 
ney demanded for thbfe that are not. The people are fond of 
the country, feldom leave it ; and, when they do, with great 
reluctance, returning as foon as they can.

the flourifhing ftate of manufaaures at Aberdeen, which draw 
off many people from this and the neighbouring parimes. 

Manufaaures. The knitting of worfted {lockings is the 

principal manufafture of this parifh. It is carried on by 
almoft all the women, by many boys, and feveral old men. 
—Different manufafturers from Aberdeen bring out wool, 
and give the people from is. to 3s. for fpinning the wool 
and knitting the (lockings. It is generally believed that this 
employment is too fedentary, and, of confequence, confidered 
as unhealthy :— but it is not fo fedentary in this parifh as it is in 
other places ; for the people can, and do very frequently, walk 
6 or 8 miles a-day without hindering the work; and thus 
fometimes affociate with bad company of both fexes, which 
tends to corrupt their morals. As the women are conftantly 
employed in this manufadure, fcarce any of them can fpm 
flax, and they are obliged to buy their linen cloth. This 
difcourages the fowing of flax ; the fpinning of wh'.ch would 
be more advantageous to the women, and keep them from 
idly, and often vicioufly, wandering about. The foil here 
is much adapted for railing that ufeful crop, which feldom or 
never fails to be a good one. The tenants now begin to fow a lit- 
tle of it, which anfwers well ; but, as there is not a lmt-mill in 
the country, they are obliged to carry the flax 8 or 9 miles to a 
mill, and pay is. 6d. for drefling 16 lb. befides drawing and 
preparing it for the roller. 

Farm-Houfes, Ploughs, and Carts.— The houfes and offi- 
ces of the tenants are indeed very poor ; though the hentor, 
bind themfelves, at their removal, for the walls of their hou- 
fes if built of mafon work, and alfo for the roof. They are 
generally built of dry ftone, and covered with turf. If 
the tenants built better houfes, and went neat and clean, they 



of LeocheL ziy 

would become more induftrious, and keep a better table. - . 

There are in the parifh and lands of Corfe 44 ploughs ; great- 
eft part of them drawn by oxen, from 4 to 12 to a plough. 
The crofters yoke their cows and young cattle in the plough. 
There are now 53 carts in the whole diftricl: : in 1772, there 
were only 4, of which the minifter had two. 

Black-Cattle, Horfes, and Sheep. — According to the beft in- 
formation, there feem to be in the parifh and lands of Corfe 
from 750 to 800 black-cattle, 1300 fheep, 140 horfes of a fmall 
fize, and about 30 or 40 fwine. About 200 cattle are fold 
annually, either in the country to graziers, or to dealers in the 
fouthern counties. A great many horfes, within thefe 8 years 
paft, have been carried to the fouth ; and fold there from L. 3 
to L. 10 each. The oxen commonly give from L. 3 to L. 6 ; 
— fheep from 5s. to 10s. — and fwine from 20s. to 40s. each*. 

Vol. VI. E e Exports, 

* The language fpoken in this parifh is Englifh, or rather a particular dia- 
led of the Scottifh, called the Aberdeenfhire dialed*. No Gaelic is fpoken 
here, or nearer than Tullich and Corgars, about 15 Englifh miles diftant ; 
though it feems to have been formerly the language of this country, the names 
of feveral places being evidently derived from it ; thus, Craigivar, or Creg-a- 
Mharr, the " rock of Mar ;'* Tullieorn, or Tullich -eorrta, the " barley hill;" 

Cnockannach, or Cnoc-Clyoinneacb , " Kenneth's hillock, or know," &amp;c. 1 

The inhabitants, fince 1745, are much civilized, and little difpofedto quarrel- 
ling. In general, they are peaceable and well-behaved ; not addided to drink- 
ing, which may account for there not being a public-houfe in the parifh. 
The people have no military turn, and when any of them enlifl in the army, 

they return as foon as they can get their difcharge. The men drefs plainly

Exports, Woods, Fuel, and Roads. The parifh annually, 

at an average, fends to Aberdeen, or to the interior parts of 
the country, from 600 to 800 bolls of oat- meal, and from 200 
to 300 bolls of bear, except in bad feafons, when the crops 
are deficient. 

Around the caftle of Craigivar, there are plenty of good old 
alh and plane trees, about 200 acres of excellent thriving wood, 
confifting of oak, birch, Scotch pine, fpruce and larix firs ; 
but there are no other trees in the parifh, except fomehard wood 
in the tenants yards, fome full grown a(h and plane trees a- 
round the caftle of Corfe, and, hard by it, a fmall plantation 
of birch and fir. 

There is no peat in the parifh, except the lands of Corfe, fo 
that the inhabitants are but very poorly provided with fire. They 
are fupplied with turf and heather from the muirs, and a fort of 
green fods, called phuds, which they caft in the exhaufted rhof- 
fes. Some bring black peat from a great diftance for drying their 
grain. Were the coal-duty removed, it would be a great mean 
of redreffing this grievance. 

The public roads are made and repaired by the ftatute-la- 
bour Every man, from 15 to 60 years of age, is obliged to 
work 3 days in fummer, and 3 in autumn, or to pay is. 6d. 
for the whole yearly labour. The roads, as yet, are poorly 

made. 

Day-labourers for hufbandry get from 8d. to rod. per day without vifluals, 
and v. ith vi£taals,'from 4 d- to 6d. Mens wages for the year are from L.a:io 
to L. 7 : womens wages for the year from 40s. to 50s. Harveft wages for

made. If every man would pay the compofition-money, and 
men were hired with a proper overfeer, the roads would be 
much more fufficiently done. 

Churchy School, and Poor.— The church is old, and in bad 
repair. Sir William Forbes of Craigivar is patron. The manfe 
was repaired and enlarged in 1767, and is a commodious fmall 
houfe. The ftipend is 32 bolls of meal, at 8 ftones per boll ; 16 
bolls of bear; L.3 1 : 2 : 2A fterling of money ; befides 50 merks 
Scotch, and fmall fervices, valued at other 50 merks, paid by the 
tenants of Corfe, for ferving that cure. The glebe, though not 
legal, is a piece of the beft ground in the parifh. 

The Seceflion began here about 36 years ago, owing to the 
reformation of church-mufic in a neighbouring parifh. There is 
a very good dated Seceder kirk in the end of this parifh, and a 
manfe near it. The minifter's ftipend is L. 40 fterling, made 
up from the feat- rents and collections. The congregation feems 
to be upon the decline., The minifter is a fenfible man, 
and his hearers quiet and inoffenfive. Such of them as belong 
to this parifh get aid from the poor's funds in the fame man- 
ner as the poor of the Eftablifhed church do. 

There is a good fchool-houfe here, but no garden for the 
fchoolmafter. His falary is only 100 merks Scotch j his pei- 
quifites, college-fees, and feffion-clerk's fee, fcarcely amount 
to L. 6 fterling yearly. 

The poor's funds amount to about L. 40 fterling ; befides 
1000 merks Scotch, mortified by Sir John Forbes of Craigivar's 
lady, and which, by the will of the mortifier, mud remain in 
the hands of that family ; but the intereft of it is regularly paid 
to the kirk-feffion in meal, and divided among the poor in the 
lands of Craigivar and Corfe. The weekly collections, with 
what is got about a communion time, do not exceed 
L. 3: to fterling per annum. The poor have no other funds, 
except penalties, and a very fmall rent for the poor's loft.

There are 1 2 poor families who occafionally get fupply ; and 
a common beggar is fcarcely known in the parilh. Rather than 
beg, the people would live in great mifery at home : but the pa- 
rilh is much diftrefled with ftrolling importunate ftrangers. 

In 1782 and 1783, the crops were fully as good as in ma- 
ny other parifhes, though there certainly was a great deficien- 
cy. Befides the Government fupply to the poor, the kirk fef- 
fion, with the approbation of the heritors, bought a good deal 
of meal, gave of it gratis to the poor, and fold it ar. a reduced 
price to others. By this means, the poor's funds were great- 
ly diminilhed ; but, happily, none perifhed for want. The he- 
ritors were at pains to procure good feed for their tenants, who 
have not yet recovered the lofs of thofe bad years ** 

Eminent 

* There are three caftles in the parifli. ift, The caftle of Corfe, now in ruins; 
built in 1581 by William Forbes, father of Patrick Forbes, Bifliop of Aberdeen. 
Tradition bears, and the common people flill believe, that the Devil vifited 
the Bifhop fn this caftle; that they differed; and that the Devil, cn his de- 
parture, carried away with him the broad fide of the caftle ; on the ftone-ftairs 

whereof, they ftill pretend to point out his footfteps. ad, The caftle of 

Craigivar ; which, as is imagined, was begun in the beginning of the 17th cen- 
tury by Roger Mortimer, then of Craigivar. He only built it half way up, 
which, it is faid, hurt his circumftances ; and he fold his eftate to Mr William 
Forbes, brother to Bifhop Forbes of Corfe, who finifhed the caftle in a very e- 
legant manner, according to the falhion of the times, in the year 1626. It is 
feven ftories ; two of which are vaulted. Though not at prefent inhabited, 

Sir William Forbes keeps it in good repair. 3d, The caftle of Lenturk. 

now in ruins, is fuppofed to be older than either of the other two. It appears 
to have been built early in the 1 6th centuiy. It has a large deep broad fofs 
around it ; and, in thofe days, has been a place of ftrength . It has been pro- 
bably built by Strachan of Lenturk ; who, in the reign of James V. ve- 
ry unjuftly accufed John, mafter of Forbes, of high treafon, which, though not 
proven, made him lofe his head. Tradition bears, that in July 1645, Wil- 
liam Forbes of Skellater, having no good will to Irvine, then laird of 

Lenturk, came down hither from Strathdon with his men ; fhut the laird up 
in the caftle priibn ; lived at large in the caftle, and ou the eftate, till the 

morning 



of Leochel. 



Eminent Men None have made any refpe£table figure, ei- 
ther in learning or eminence, except the Forbes's of Covfe. 
Patrick Forbes, 5 th laird of Corfe, was elected Bifhop of A- 
berdeen in 16 18, and died in 1635. His fon, Dr John For- 
bes of Corfe, a man of great learning and abilities, filled the 
chair of Divinity Profeflbr at King's College, Aberdeen, till 
he was expelled by the. Covenanters. Of three younger bro- 
thers of the Bifhop, one having acquired a large fortune at 
Dantzig, purchafed the lands of Craigivar and Fintray, and 
was anceftor of the prefent Sir William Forbes of Craigivar i 
another died minifter of Delft in Holland, and was father of 
Patrick Forbes, Bifhop of Aberdeen ; and a third, having mads 
a confiderable fortune in Ireland, was progenitor of the Earls 
of Granard, in that kingdom.

In this parifh there are nine large tumuli or cairns ; without any broad flat 
ftones on the top, but fome of them are hinged round with large (tones ; and 
have the remains of Druidical temples hard by them. Some of thefe temples 
are compofed of two and three circles of ereft ftones. There have been more 
cairns in the parilh, which have been removed for building houfes and fold- 
dykes. Where they flood, there dill remain vifible (tone coffins, where urns 
have no doubt been dug up. A few years ago, human bones were found ia 
one of the largeft cairns upon the eftate of Lenturk, a good way from the 
bottom, without any (lone coffin enclofing them. The ftones of all the cairns 

are in general very fmall On the brow of the hill of Corfe, nearly oppo- 

fite to the cattle, there is in a rock a fmall natural cave, called the Laird's bid-

pofed to be the camp or fortification of Malcolm or Macbeth ; and near 
this there are a great number of fmall tumuli, now overgrown with fhort heath,

COUNTY OF ABERDEEN.) 

By the Rev. Mr. William Maitland.</head> 

<p>

Name and Stipend* 

TARLAND is, perhaps, one of the moft disjoined and dis- 
contiguous charges in Scotland. It confifts of two pa- 
rtfhes united into one charge. It is evident, however, that in 
Popilh times, they have been different charges, and the refi- 
dence of different clergymen, as there is a farm adjacent to one 
of the churches, which is called Pittentaggart , a word, which 
in the Celtic, fignifies the Prieft's Croft ; and a part of that farm 
is (till occupied by the minifter of the united charge, or his 
fubtenant, as glebe. The names of the two parifties are Tarland 
and Migvy. The churches are diftant from each other about 2 
Scotch miles; and the minifter preaches two Sundays at Tar- 
land, and the third at Migvy, by regular rotation, both fum- 
mer and winter. With regard to the origin or etymology of 
the names, Tarland is a corruption of a Celtic word, figmfy- 
ing the flat plain, which agrees perfeftly well with its fitua- 
tion—The minifter's refidence is at Tarland ; where he has

a manfe and glebe of about 4 acres, fome of it very good, and 
fome of it very poor and fandy, but no grafs nor any allowance 
for it. His other glebe, mentioned above as part of the Prieft's 
Croft, adjacent to Migvy, is of about 3 acres ; which, with 
a houfe and fmall yard, rents at L. 1:13:4 fterling yearly. 
The ftipend of both parifhes was modified, anno 1748, to 700 
merks money ; 35 bolls meal, at 8 ftone per boll ; and 13 bolls 
bear ; with L. 40 Scotch for communion elements. The Crown 
is patron. The church and manfe of Tarland are fituated in a 
fmall village almoft on the S. W. border of the diftrict, hav- 
ing the whole of that part of the parifti, which lies in Cromar, 
to the N. and N. E. of the church *, 

Villages. — The village of Tarland, confifting of upwards of 
40 houfes, and containing 1 50 fouls, fituated in the center of 
Cromar, is a burgh of barony ; has a weekly market on Wed- 
nefday, and three larger, and three lefler yearly markets, to 
which there is a great refort from all the country for feveral 
miles round, and at which the molt important commercial bu- 
fmefs of the country is tranfacted. In thefe markets, meal is 
fold by meafure, though in all other bargains, relating to that 
article, it is fold by weight, at 9 ftone to the boll. Thefe mar- 
kets are always attended by two or three notaries or meflen- 
gers, who, by attention and good management, have within 
thefe 30 years paft, cleared fome thoufand pounds from the 
country. In the village, there are 4 merchants, who keep 
open (hops every day ; an inn, with good accommodation for 
travellers, befides 3 or 4 licenfed alehoufes ; 1 fhoemaker ; 
I butcher ; 1 fadler ; 1 dyer ; 1 houfe-carpenter ; 2 mantua- 

makers, 

* Cromar is a divifion of Mar, in Aberdeenmire, and comprehends in it the 
parifh of Coul in the E. end, the parifhes of Tarland and Migvy, of Coldftone 
and Logy, and part of the parifti of TuUich, in the middle and W. end of it.

makers, who alfo teach white feam j i gardener ; i black-fmith 
and ferrier ; i wheel-wright ; and 2 or 3 carriers. Here the 
Earl of Aberdeen, the proprietor, has a granary for the recep- 
tion of his victual rents ; of which he has 600 bolls meal pay- 
able yearly from his eftates in this and the neighbouring parifh- 
es. In all thefe markets, be fides wood and materials for 
all kinds of labouring utenfils, all kinds of merchant goods, 
and things neceffary for country confumpt, are expofed to 
fale. In the month of February, there is a market for hor- 
fes ; in May, there is one for (beep ; the week after that, one 
for cows j and in November, one for cattle, which continues 
two days. 

Extent and Form.— To defcribe the extent and form of the 
parifh of Tarland is very difficult. That part of it, which lies 
in Cromar, may be about 2 Scotch miles in length, from N E. 
to S. W. and about I in breadth, from N. to S. and is pretty 
contiguous. Faffing N.W. through the parifh of Coldftone, 
through the parifh of Migvy, through part of Towie, then 
through Migvy again, and through Strathdon, at the diftance 
of 8 to 12 miles from the parifh church. A part of the parifh 
of Tarland lies along the N. fide of the river Don, of between 
3 and 4 miles in length ; and in one glen, called Glenernon, 
from the water Ernon which runs through it, about 2 miles in 
breadth. This part of the parifh of Tarland is under the in- 
. fpeftion of a miffionary minifter, whofe falary is paid from the 
royal bounty, and who performs all the parts of the miniften- 
al office among the inhabitants of if, fo that the minifter of Tar- 
land has little or no intercourfe with them $ and can give no ac- 
count of their numbers, births, deaths, or other particulars, 
which are the objects of enquiry under confederation. The 
'miffionary minifter is the proper perfon to give information of 

that corner. It is faid, that this diftant part of the panfli of 

Tarland 



of Tarland. 225 

Tarland had been of old, (when the country was lefs populous, 
and lefs cultivated ), {healing places, belonging to the proprie- 
tors of ground in Cromar ; and that, as they came to be more 
cultivated, they had been fold off as property, which, after 
changing feveral mafters, has fallen into the hands of the pre- 
fent 4 different heritors, each of whom has property alfo in the 
parifh of Strathdon. 

The parifh of Migvy is alfo very difcontiguous. Part of it 
lies in Cromar, disjoined from Tarland by a part of the parifh 
of Coldftone, which furrounds it on the weft, fouth, and eaft 
fides, and comes within \ of an Englifh mile to Tarland. On 
the N. it is bounded by a tracT: of hills, which divides it from 
Towie. There was a new church built at Migvy about 3 or 4 
years ago, at the diftance of about 1 Scotch mile from the cen- 
trical church of Logy Coldftone, which lies to the S. of it. 
This part of Migvy parifh may be about 2 miles in length, from 
N. W. to S. E. and about 1 mile from N. to S. the church 
bordering upon the N. W. corner. PafTmg from this part of 
the parifh, over a ridge of mountains, N. W. by W. through 
the parifh of Coldftone, or N. W, by N. through the parifh 
of Towie, into a glen, there is a part of the parifh of Migvy 
on the N. fide of the water of Deflcry, which runs through 
that glen, of 2 Scotch miles in length, and perhaps about * 
mile in breadth, from N. to S. At the N. W. end of this glen, 
the parifh of Migvy lies on both fides of the water, where it 
runs into Don. From this account of the form and extent of ' 
the parifhes, it will appear that a new divifion of parifhes 
might be attended with great advantage ; and, it is believed, 
that many other parifhes in Scotland will afford ample ground 

for the fame remark. That part of the parifh of Tarland, 

^hich lies in Cromar, is divided from Cufhny on the N. by a. 
track of high and barren mountains : of which there is a tradi- 
tion, that the freebooters, who in more lawlefs times frequented

thefe hills, when they came from the uncivilized parts of 
Lochaber, &amp;c. for the fake of plundering cattle, declared them 
to be the coldeft hills in Scotland ; and the affertion appears 
to be not ill-founded. 

Surface, Soil, and Climate.*— -The lands about the village of 
Tarland are moftly flat and level ; a great part of them isliable to 
be overflown with water. There is a level between Tarland 
and Coul 2 Englifh miles in length, and from ^ to | in 
breadth, where it is faid there is not fix feet of defcent from 
the one end to the other. In September 1768, the whole of 
this level was under water. The foil in this level is general- 
ly good and fertile : the other parts of the parifh are more un- 
even, and the foil various ; tho' the whole would be capable of 
great improvement, if proper means were within reach, but 
thefe are wanting. The tenants are not able to inclofe ; lime 
is not to be got, but at an expence which they cannot afford 
there is no command of water in moft places where it would 
be moft ufeful. The fame things may be faid of the lands in 
that part of the parifh of Migvy, which lies in Cromar : the 
foil on Delkry fide is generally thin, and the crops often late, 
and liable to be hurt by frofts and mildews. The country is 
mountainous and cold. Over the whole of both parifhes the 
air is dry and healthy ; and, among the inhabitants, there are 
no diftempers peculiar to the climate. Nervous and rheuma- 
1 tic complaints are more common than they were 30 or 40 years 
ago j owing in part, at leaft, to the different mode of living, 
which is more generous, and to the ufe of fpirituous liquors a- 
mong the males, and of tea among the females ; both of which 
are drunk in much greater quantities now, than in the days of 
our fathers. 

Rivers and Hills,— In the parifh of Tarland, a rivulet runs 



of Garland. 227 

by the village, -which takes its rife from the fprings in the moun- 
tains to the N. and N. W. In fummer, this ftream is very 
fmall, and hardly affords water enough to work the mills that 
depend upon it ; but in winter, it is full of water, and by 
heavy fhowers often overflows its banks, and lays a great part 
of the lands in the before-mentioned level under water, to the 
great hurt of the crops both of corn and grafs. The fame may 
be faid of the water of Defkry, over which is a (tone bridge 
of one arch built, at Rippachy, on the highway from Strath- 
don to Aberdeen, and by which travellers pafs by another 
public road to Tariand, and through Cromar. Both thefe af- 
ford no other fifh but trout, which, though fmall, is exceeding 
good. The river Don, which runs along that part of the pa- 
rifli of Tariand in Strathdon, beirg there near its fource, 13 
but fmall in fummer. It abounds with fine trouts, and fome- 
times falmon are found in it, as far up as Strathdon. The 
mountains all- over the country are generally covered with 
heath, and afford pretty good pafturage for fheep, and in fome 
places for young cattle. They abound with moorfowl, plover, 
dottrel, foxes, hares, and other game : the common quadru- 
peds in the parifli are horfes, black-cattle, flieep, and fome 
hogs. 

Population.— -With regard to the population of the parifhes, 
no diftinft account can be given, as no regifter of births, deaths, 
•or marriages has ever been, or can be exaftly kept in them, 
owing to the diftance of feveral parts of the united charge 
to the place of the minifter's refidence. The people of Migvy 
or Delkry-fide attend religious ordinances at the church of 
Towie, and get their children baptifed there, as being nearer 
to them than Tariand. They never think of feeking to get a 
child's name entered into the parifli regifter ; ! thofe of Tariand 
parifli, in Strathdon, are in the fame predicament. As to 

F f  that 



228 Statijlical Account 

that part of Tarland and Migvy immediately under the minif- 
ter's infpection, and on Defkry-fide, where he catechifes re- 
gularly every year, the number of fouls can be afcertained ve- 
ry exactly. In the year 1768, in thefe bounds, the numbers 
were 826 above 7 years of age, and 101 below 7; — total 927. 
From that time to 1 791, the numbers have been fluctuating, 
but upon the whole decreafing. In 1 79 1 , the numbers in the 
fame bounds were, 688 above 7, and 1 1 8 below 7 total 806. 
The occafion of this decreafe may be, that many families, upon 
being reduced in their circumftances, remove to towns, where, 
from the improvements that are carrying on, in agriculture, 
manufadures, &amp;c. they get work and wages in proportion to 
their flrength and capacity ; and, by thefe means, make afhift 
to live much better than they could have done by continuing 
in their former fituation. Within thefe 14 or 16 years paft, 
many numerous families have gone from Tarland to Aberdeen. 
—Some individuals have reached the age of 80, or it be may a 
little above that, but none have exceeded 90 fince 1767. Of 
806, the total number anno 1791, 400 are males, and 406 fe- 
males. Of the whole, there may be under xo years of age, a- 
bout 180; from 10 to 20, about 170; from 20 to 50, about 
310; from 50 to 70, about 130 5 and from 70 to 90, about 16, 
as nearly as can be gueffed. The return to Dr. Webfter in 
1755, from the whole united parifhes, was 1300 fouls. 

Farms, Jgrkultun, life. -In the parifhes of Tarland 

and Migvy, exclufive of that part of Tarland in Strathdon, 
there maybe about 50 or 54 farms-, feme of larger and fome 
of letter extent •, fome poffefTed by one, and others by two te- 
nants, each of whom have from 2 to 3, and fome 4 or 5 fub- 
tenants •, and about a dozen of fmaller pofleflions occupied on- 
ly by one tenant. The number of horfes and cattle upon thefe 

farms is various, according to the abilities of the farmer* 

fome 



of Tarland. 



229 



fome have 3, fome 4 horfes, with fome 8, fome 10, and fome 
12 oxen, for their ploughs; and fome 2, fome 3, and fome 4 
cows, with their calves of one and two years old. Some have 
2, others 3, and fome 4 or 5 fcore of fheep upon a farm. The 
fubtenants keep a horfe and a cow. The general value of the or- 
dinary horfes are from L. 5 to L, 12, and fome few to L. .4 or 
L. 15 fterling. The common fizes of cattle are worth, from 3 
years old and upwards, L. 3, L. 4, L. 6, and fometimes L. 7 
iterling ; cows from L. 2 : 10 to L. 6 : fheep are generally worth, 
wedders from 10s. to 15s. ewes and lambs of the country breed 

from 4s. to 8s. and lambs from 2S. 6d. to 4s The farmers 

in this country, in general, are obliged to fend their labouring 
cattle away, about the end of May, for fummer grazing, to 
glens at the diftance of 30 or 40 miles, from whence they do 
not return till about the end of Auguft ; and many of them 
muft fend their fheep, at lead their wedders, to diftant paf- 
tures for the fummer feafon too. This is a great draw-back 
upon the improvement of their farms, as befides the expence 
of paying for grafs, which within thefe dozen of years has 
rifen from 2s. to 8s. a head for cattle, they lofe the benefit of 
their dung for 3 months. Another great inconvenience they 
have to ftruggle with in fummer, is the difficulty of getting fer- 
vants, which is owing to the following practice that has pre- 
vailed for fome years back : — a great number of able-bodied 
winter-fervants engage to go out of the country in fummer, 
for building dykes and enclofures to thofe gentlemen who are 
carrying on improvements in the fouth country ; and by thefe 
means they make double, fometimes triple, the wages in the fum- 
mer half year that they could get or expect by engaging with a 
farmer at home. The Dyker, ashe is called, gets from L.2 to L.3 
fterling, and fometimes more, for 3 months in fummer ; then,

make from 8s. to 1 2s. By this practice, the farmer in Cro- 
mar has much ado to get fervants in fummer, fufficient for pre- 
paring and leading home his year's provifion of fuel for fire, 
which confifts of peats and turf : to lay in a proper quantity of 
thefe takes up moft of the time from Whitfunday to harveft. 
— Some of the farmers are beginning to raife turnips and po- 
tatoes, and to lay down fown grafs ; but for want of inclofures 
and winter herding, which is abhorred by the generality in this 
corner, it is impofEble that any progrefs can be made in thefe 
improvements. 

MannfaBurei. — The only branches of manufacture in this 
country are the fpinning linen yarn, and knitting hofe. The 
dealers in thefe manufactures have a number of ftations in the 
village of Tarland, and over the whole neighbouring country, 
where lint and wool are given out, and yarn and {lockings taken 
in, the yarn, at from iod. to x 5"d. per fpindle, and (lockings 
at from is. to 2S. 6d.for fpinning and knitting the pair, in pro- 
portion to the different qualities of the refpedive articles. Thefe 
bring a great deal of money into the country ; by which the 
greatefl part of the poorer families are fupported, and enabled 
to pay the rents of their houfes and fmall crofts of land. But 
the females, who fit from their childhood at the flocking or 
little wheel, are generally valetudinary, and commonly can do 
nothing at any other labour-, and, when thefe works bring tole- 
rable prices, it is difficult for thofc that need them to get fe- 
male fervants. 

ProduBions and Rent, —The parifhes of Tarland and Migvy 
produce a great deal more grain and viftual than is neceflary 
for their own confumpt ; and confiderable quantities of meal 
and bear are annually carried to Aberdeen, or difpofed of 
to fupply the neighbouring Highland diftrids, where the 

meal 



of Tarland, 2^1 

meal is needed for the fupport of the inhabitants, and the 
bear made into bear and whifky. The times of fowing and 
reaping are variable, as the feafon anfwers. The harveft in 
Cromar, and particularly about Tarland, is generally as early as 
in any corner of the county of Aberdeen. — Some of the farmers 
in the parifh pay from L.40 to L.50 iter, of rent; others from L. 30 
to L. 40 ; and fome not above L. 20 or L.25, including mo- 
ney, farm meal and bear, cefs, and other public burdens ; and, 
when calculated, the fingle acre may be worth, out-field from 
3s. to 5s. and in-town from i6s. to 20s. and fome of it 25s. 
according to the nature of the foil. — In the whole 
united parifhes of Tarland and Migvy, there are 13 heritors; 
of whom, 6 have property in the parifh of Tarland, and 7 in 
the parifh of Migvy : of all thefe, only 2 in Strathdon refide 
within the parifh. The valued rent of Tarland is L.i8o6:3 
and of Migvy L. 1265 :6: 8 Scotch f.

twentieth part of the ftock, and a peck to each boll; thefe are called the

qualmes of grain, the felling it by the meafure is not at all a fair medium of 
commerce; becaufe the fame price is exacted for grain that weighs no more 
than 18 or 19 ftone per boll, as for other grain that will weigh ao or aa ftone

Mifcellonmis Remarks.— The number of poor who receive 
fupport from the parilh funds may be from 16 to 20. There 
are no funds or mortifications for their fupport, but the daily 
colleaions in the churches, which may, at an average, amount 
to 2od. or 2s. every fabbath, exclufive of the colleaions on a 
communion occafion, which commonly amount to about L. 3 

fterling. There is nothing remarkable in the chafers or 

difpofitions of the people. They are generally of the ordinary 
/ize ; and not at all deficient in hofpitality.— Carts are pretty 

generally ufed both in hufbandry and by carriers. Tarland, 

it is believed, would be a very proper place for a linen manu- 
faaure, as there is good accommodation for a bleachfield, the 
water being very foft, and fit for bleaching •, and now that there 
is a lint- mill ereaed by the Earl of Aboyne in the neighbour- 
ing parifh of Coul, there is a fort of fpirit for raifing lint be- 
ginning to appear among the inhabitants of Cromar; and, if 
this was encouraged, it might be of great advantage to the coun- 
try It might alfo be of fervice, to have a public diftillery e- 
tecied at or near Tarland, as the country yields a great deal of 
good bear, weighing from 18 to 22 ftone per boll. But as there 
are no rending heritors in the country, little attention is paid 

to the benefit or improvement of it By the ftatute-labour 

which is exaaed in kind, the roads in the parifti are put and 
kept in pretty good repair.</p>

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6414018">KINNAIRD</name>. 

^PRESBYTERY OF DUNDEE, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND 
MEARNS, COUNTY OF PERTH.) 

By the Rev. Mr. David Spence.</head> 


<p>
Name and Extern'. 
'"jpHE name of the parilh is compounded of two Celtic 
words, which fignify high end or head. It may have 
got this name (as mod Celtic names of places are defcriptive) 
from the raifed fituation of the village, or caftle of Kinnaird, 
which (lands higher than the village, a little on the north fide 
of it ; and commands an extenfive and beautiful profpetl to 
the S. of the Carle of Gowrie, bounded by the river Tay, and 
the north hills of Fife.— The barony lands of Kinnaird belong- 
ed originally to the noble family of that name, by a grant from 
one of the kings of Scotland ; and from them they derived 
their name and title, though no part is now in their pofTef- 
fion — Thetaftle bears the marks of confiderable antiquity ; 
and is faid by the country people to be between 500 and 600 
years old. Great part of it appears to be entirely demolifhed; 
but fo much remains as fliews that it has been defigned for de- 
fence; and was formerly a place of very confiderable ftreneth.

like many others in Scotland, during the prevalence of the feu- 
dal inftitutions, when the chieftains, fupported by their de- 
pendants, lived in a ftate of almoft conftant hoftility with 
each other. 

The parifh is fituated in what is called the Carfe braes, a- 
bout midway between Perth and Dundee ; extends about 2 
miles E. and W. and 3 S. and N. comprehending the wafte 
and uninhabited hilly lands. 

Soil and Climate. — The fmalleft, but richeft part of the pa- 
rifh, lies in the Carfe of Gowrie ; well known for the ftrength 
and fertility of its foil. On the fouth fide of the Carfe braes, 
the foil is a mixture, in different proportions, of black earth, 
and what is called mortar, perhaps from its cementing quality, 
which makes it fit to be ufed in building. It is not fo rich 
and ftrong as the Carfe clay or black earth, but produces crops 
of all the different grain fold in the Carfe ; though not fo lux- 
uriant, yet of fuch good quality, that the farmers can difpofe 
of them at nearly the fame price. The north fide of the braes, 
not only the climate, but the foil, light and (hallow, render 
lefs fit for cultivation. It is moftly bent and heath, intermix- 
ed, however, with fields of good natural paflure ; which, 
divided at a fmall rent, among tenants who have farms 
on the fouth fide, enables them to rear a greater number of 
cattle than they could otherwife have done, the yearly fale of 
which aftifts them to pay the higher rents at which they have 
their corn farms. 

The air of the Carfe and Carfe hills is rather moift ; from 
which, it might be thought, unhealthy, and that rheuma- 
tifms, agues, and confumptions, would be the prevailing dif- 
tempers. They are, however, by no means fo prevalent as for- 
merly ; owing no doubt, in a great meafure, to the progrefs 
of improvement by draining, which continues to be carried 

on

on with fpirit ; and by which, befides promoting health, rich 
corn fields are got from marfhy ground that yielded nothing 
before but grafs of the coarfeft quality. Now, the people in 
general are healthy and long lived. In this fmall parifh, with- 
in 6 or 7 years paft, feveral who had always refided in it died 
between 70 and 90 years old 5 and there are now living in it 
a man and a woman at the advanced age of between 90 and 
100. 

Population. — The population of the parifh has been gradual- 
ly decreafuig for many years paft ; owing in a great meafure 
to the monopolizing of farms j 10 or 12 fmall farms, which 
fupported as many families, havingbeen at different times add- 
ed to larger ones, in the cultivation of which the farmers em- 
ploy not cottagers, but young unmarried men. The return 
to Dr Webfter in 1755, however, was only 290 fouls. The

236 Statiftical Account 

The number of farms ip the parifh has been reduced, with- 
in thefe 50 or 60 years paft, nearly one-half. There are in it 
at prefent about 14 farmers ; but 4 or 5 of thefe have very fmall 
farms, on which a family can hardly fubfift without fome o- 
ther occupation. The largeft farms do not exceed 1 30 acres 
of good arable land : befides thefe, there are between 50 and 
60 acres of good ground parcelled out among the trades people 
in the different villages, to enable them to keep cows for the 
ufe of their families, and one horfe each, for labouring joint- 
ly their farms, and carrying the commodities they have forfale to 
the neighbouring market towns. The number of houfehold 
and labouring fervants, chiefly the latter, employed by the 
farmers, exclufive of their children, is 88; that of artificers, 
57, of whom 44 are weavers, who not only work for the in- 
habitants of the parifh, and others who may employ them, but 
alfo manufaaure for fale, a great deal chiefly of what they 
call Ham, and coarfe packing cloth, for which they find a rea- 
dy market in the town of Dundee. 

Natural ProduBhns, The produaions, mode of cul- 

tivation, times of fowing and reaping, and price of grain, are 
the fame in this as in the neighbouring parifhes, particularly 
that of Kilfpindy, accounts of which have been already publifh- 
ed. The method of dividing farms into 6 parts is generally 
praaifed. The beft crops of wheat, both for quantity and 
quality, are from land well prepared by fummer fallowing and 
liming, which always compenfate the farmer for Ins trouble, 
expence, and the lofs of one crop. After fallow, wheat, peafe, 
and beans are fown, and for the moft part ploughed down as 
early in fpting as the weather will permit ; after this, barley 
with clover grafs feed is fown ; and good grafs fcldom Jails to 
be fucceeded by a luxuriant crop of oats. The fmall quantities 
of flax, potatoes, and turnip, raifed ia the parifh, come in un- 



of Kimiaird. 237 

der different dlvifions of farms, according to the particular (late 
of the lands. There are more than 1000 acres of good land 
fit for raifing, in proper fuccefhon, the crops above-mention- 
ed betides moor and hill pafture, and grounds on the fouth 
fide of the hill, which, though of good foil, are inacceffible to 
the plough. Thefe the proprietor is now very properly em- 
ployed in planting with trees, particularly firs of different 
kinds, which will probably, in a few years, cover the only bar- 
ren profpect of the parifh from the Carfe, and be an ornament 
to the whole country. 

Situation of Farmers. — The farmers in general are intelli- 
gent and induftrious in their bufinefs, and therefore profpe- 
rous and contented. The rapid progrefs of improvement in 
this place, for upwards of 30 years paft, has amazingly raifed. 
the value of land and enabled the proprietor, in every new 
leafe fince that period, confiderably to raife his rent, not only 
without prejudice to the tenant, but often for his intereft, by 
compelling him to vigorous exertion in improving his farm. 
Raifing rents will always have this effect, if it is done with 
difcretion, but when otherwife, it will have a quite contrary 
confequence ; for when the tenant finds that, by his utmoft 
exertion, he cannot pay the rent and live with tolerable com- 
fort, he will fit down in fullen defpair and do nothing. From 
the fudden and great rife in the value of land, proprietors are 
apt to entertain extravagant notions of its value, and to demand 
a price for it, not according to what it is known to have pro- 
duced, even when laboured upon the beft plan of improvement 
yet difcovered, but according to their own chimerical profpecl: 
of what it may come to be worth, in confequence of farther 
improvement. Experience proves, that there is no demand, 
how extravagant foever, but the ignorance or vanity of fome 
will come up to ; and the confequence often is, that the te- 
nant

Statijlical Account 



nant Is ruined in a few years, and the landlord's great rental 
turns out to be nominal. Proprietors here, however, are at- 
tentive to the chara&amp;ers of tenants, as well as to the quality 
of their lands, of which they are in general very good judges ; 
and accordingly let farms, at reafonable rents, to fuch as will 
labour them with fkill and induftry. The beft land in this pa- 
rifh is let at, and fome of it confiderably below, L. 2 per acre ; 
one excellent farm at little more than 30s. and a good brae 
farm at 25s. per acre Many farms in the Carfe are let high- 
er, and fome of them perhaps too high ; but in general, they 
feem to be in a proper enough medium for encouraging in- 
duftry and frugality, and ftimulating the powers of ingenuity 
and invention; and tenants, who are intelligent in their bufinefs, 
and attentive to it, ftill expe£l to pay the rent, and live com- 
fortably, notwithstanding the extravagant price of working 
horfes, and the high wages of labouring fervants. Let not 
proprietors think, however, that they may ftill go on fwelling 
their rental at the granting of every new leafe, they will not 
do that if they confult their own intereft, which muft ever, in a 
great meafure, depend on the virtue and profperity of the 
tenantry. 

The condition of the tenants in this, as well as in other" 
parifhes on the north of the Carfe, will be greatly meliorated 
by making good roads to the different fhipping places along the 
banks of Tay. Thisgreat improvement Mr Allan of Errol has be- 
gun; and the feveral gentlemen in the neighbourhoodare heartily 
difpofed to carry on a work, conducing fo much to the benefit 
and comfort of the whole country ; faciliating at all times a 
moft ufeful communication which was before quite impracti- 
cable, at leaft for loaded carts, during the greateft part of the 
winter feafon.— Farmers might alfo meliorate their own con- 
dition by attending, more than they generally do, to the breed- 
ing of horfes.— Every farmer of nearly ico acres, rears an- 
nually 



of Kinnaird. 239 

nually 10 or 12 black-cattle, in which he finds his advantage j 
but few make the rearing of horfes an object of equal atten- 
tion, though, it is certain, they could breed them much more 
hardy and durable for work than foreign horfes are found 
to be, and at a third of expence at which they purchafe thefe 
horfes *. 

Situation cf Trade/men. The tradefmen in the parifh are 

in general induftrious and well employed ; and it adds much 
to the comfort and health of the weavers efpecially, that along 
with their houfes, they have fo much good land divided among 
them, as enables them to keep cows and fmall horfes, and gives 
enough of wholefome exercife, without taking too much time 
and attention from their principal bufinefs. Their condition 
would be meliorated if the proprietors would divide the lands 
more equally among them, and prevent the poffibility of en- 
groffing :-by this, envy and animofity would be prevented, and 
the peace and profperity of them all would be much promoted. 

Stipend, School, and Poor.— The church was built in 1674, 
and the manfe in 1786. It was fo fuperficially executed, as 
already to need repair, as well as the church. The ftipend is 
6 bolls of wheat; 30 bolls, 1 firlot, and 2 pecks of barley;

They are little fufceptible either of the pleafures or pains 
which refult from a lively imagination and delicate fenfibility 
of temper ; but though not remarkable for vivacity, they are 
judicious and difcerning, efpecially in farming ; and a new 
praQice, that is generally adopted in the Carfe, may be de- 
pended upon as a folid improvement. Their religion may be 
often tinctured with fuperftition, but is feldom heated with 
enthufiafm. If, where it is in truth, it is accompanied with 
little fervour, it however operates as a calm, rational, fteady 
principle of wife and virtuous conduct.

<p>

Name, Extent, tS?C, 
*-pHE parifh of Kintail derives its origin from Cbean-'dha- 
haal, the " head of two fait water bays." An arm of 
the fea at Coahcin extends eafiwardly till it meets the firft 
point of land in Kintail : the arm in this place divides itfelf in 
fuch a manner that two-thirds takes a S. E. diredion , and, 
after extending 3 miles, it terminates, and forms what is call- 
ed Lochduich. The other divifion of the aforefaid arm, called 
Lochlong, has the feme extent, andinclofes the parifh almoft 
on the N. It alfo feparates this diftrift from Lochalft. Theie 
two arms, environing the parifh of Kintail, forms the habita- 
ble parts thereof into the figure of a deer's horn. _ 

The extent of this parifh is 1 3 miles long, from S. to N. in- 
cluding the grazings and hilly ground , and in general t J com- 
puted miles broad. The parifh is divided mto 3 dAndli ;

hill pafture, which is reduced to ten feparate grazings. Some 
of its pofleflbrs are connected with other pariflies and, as 
they retreat to their winter dwellings after harveft, their num- 
ber cannot be minutely afcertained. The other divifions of 
the parifli, belonging to Francis Humberftone M'Kenzie, 
Efq. of Seaforth, contain 840 fouls.-— The natives of the pa- 
rifli are all Mac Raes, except two or three families *. 

Rivers, Hills, and Roads.— There are two rivers in this pa- 
rifli, the Loigh and the Croe, which avife in fmall rivulets in 
the mountains ; the former runs into Lochlong, and the lat- 
ter into Lochduich. Both thefe rivers were once famous for 
falmon ; and the fifhings were common to theanhabitants, till 
they were laid under ftri£t prohibition, foon after 1 745. Stills

* The firft man of the clan had, it is faid, in his younger days, many diffi- 
culties to encounter, from which he with great dexterity extricated himfelf. 
His father, upon hearing the happy events attending his fon, exclaimed, 
Bhaimhac ragbaigh, " He is the fon of good fortune." It is generally al- 
lowed that the Mac Rae's emigrated from the braes of Aird, on the Lovat e- 
ftate, to this place, though what induced them to prefer the mountains to the 
plains, is not univerfally agreed upon, yet certain it is, that long after their 
refidence in Kintail, they maintained a firm alliance with the Frafers of 
Aird. The tradition which prevails, that an infcription was fet up nigh the 
entrance to Lovat houfe, bearing, " That no Mac Rae mufl lodge without, 
" when a Frafer refides within," is not wholly without foundation. When 
the Mac Raes firft entered Kintail, there were feveral clans inhabiting it, 
particularly the Mac Aulays, of whom no veftige now remains. The Mac Len- 
nans, a fmall tribe in the parilh of Glenflieal, were the only people that would 
not yield. Thefe Mac Lennans, at the battle of Auldearn, were intruded with 
Seaforth's colours ; the novelty of the preferment roufed them to action and 
ftubborn refiftance, which proved fatal to the clan, for many were flain ; and 

their widows, 18 in number, were afterwards married to Mac Raes. The 

boundaries, which divide the Mac Raes from the Mac Lennans, are marked 
by a river which runs into Lochd uich ; but common obfervatiwn may eafily 
trace a line of diftincYion from the difference in their language and accent;.

were then eftablifhed ; a novelty which the people did not re- 
lifh j and fome of them teftified their difapprobation of this a- 
bridgement of their privileges, by dragging the nets a-fhore, and 
reprimanding the fifhermen. They a&amp;ed under the idea, that 
hunting and fifhing were privileges handed down to them by 
their anceftors ; and that thefe immunities ought never to be 
monopolized nor wrefted from mankind. 

Kintail is on every quarter furrounded with high hills ; the 
molt eminent is Tulloch-ard, which commands a view of ma- 
ny of the Hebride iflands. This mountain claims particular 
attention, on account of the veneration it was held in antient 
times. Like the temple of Janus, it indicated peace or war : 
the voice of hoftility wa3 fure to roar on its fummit ; for, when

Donan, the ufual place of rendezvous *'. Maam Tuirc, or 

Boar Hill, is another high mountain to the eaft of Tulloch-ard. 
It divides Glenelchaig from the fide of Croe. , 

There are no ftatute or military roads within the parifh.Some 
remains of a road are to be feen along the fhore of Lettercoil. 
This ufeful road was intended to be carried on along the north 
fide of Lochduich ; but the tenants, after much labour and 
trouble, deferted it, probably for want of a proper fund to go 
forward. Till of late, the people of Kintail, as well as other 
Highlanders had a ftrong averfion to roads. The more inac- 

ceflible, the more fecure, was their maxim.- But of all 

the roads leading to this place, none calls more for public at- 
tention than that of Afric or Belloch. This road is 13 com-

puted miles from Kilduich in Kintail, to Knocfin in Strath- 
glafs. It is allowed to be the nearelt communication between 
the E. and W. feas ; and, though daily frequented by people 
from Sky and other places, to Invernefs and Dingwall, with 
heavy loads, there is no inn to accommodate travellers, except 
the booths of fhepherds, which in ftormy weather they fre- 
quently burn for feul.— Within 3 miles of Kintail, at a place 
called Belloch, is a high ridge of hills which environs this dif- 
tri£l on the E. and would render it inacceffible from that quar- 
ter, if nature had not left a fmall gap in the mountain, as if 
it had been fawn down to the middle, which leaves room for 
3 paflengers to go a-breaft. The afcent on the E. to the Bel- 
loch is about 100 yards in a zig-zag direction. The weftern af- 
pecSt is truly fteep and vexatious : the intermediate fpace on 
the top is a quarter of a mile long, and 5 feet broad. The 
traveller finds himfelf, in palling through this gut, inclofed 
with hills of rueful afpefts, infpiring awe, and often quick- 
ening his pace *. 

CharaBer 

* After the battle of Culloden, Lord George Sackville, entered Kintail by 
this road, driving cattle and plunder before him. Mr John M'Lean, the 
minifter of this parifh, appeared before his Lordlhip, to proteft the Kintail 
men, (being at that time loyal fubjecls), from unmerited infult ; but, from 
the fimplicity of Mr M'Lean's drels, his Lordlhip inferred impofition ; and, 
fcizing a loaded piftol, gave orders for his appearing inftantly before him with 
his library, that his opinion concerning his facred character might no long- 
er remain in fufpenfe ; otherwife he would fuffcr for daring to infult him. 
This uncommon falutation, added to the natural trepidation of the venerable 
old man,-he made all poffible hafte to bring back a volume of Pool's Anno- 
tations, which convinced his Lordlhip, that the want of pontifkial robes in 
the Highlands was no obftacle to vetacity. This volume of Pool's Annota- 
tions is mil within the precincls of the place ; carefully laid up in the lib- 
rary of the minifter of Glenlheal, and preferred like the old Palladium of 

Troy .Of all the travellers attempting the Afric road, none ever left fuch

CharaFier of the People.— Within the mountains already de- 
fcribed, one will naturally expeft to find untoward afpeds, 
with afperity of temper : this conclufion 40 years ago was tru- 
ly inconteftible, but the greateft change has taken place of late 
years. The natives or Kintail are tall, robuft, and well-limb- 
ed •, able to endure much cold and fatigue ; generous and hof- 
pitable ; and if they are fometimes peevifh to ftrangers, it is 
by reafonof encroachments on their grazings and hill pafture. 
This peculiarly arifes from their being wholly devoted to the 
paftoral life, without intermeddling with any other branch of 
. manufafture or trade. In the laft century, or rather later, 
the inhabitants of Kintail wore nothing but the woolen manu- 
fadures of the place •, but at prefent, every individual purchaf- 
es linen, and affed as much neatnefs in drefs as any of their 
neighbours. It is eafy to remark, that their attachment to 
b Seaforth 



battle of Glen(heal,l 7 i9, received a comrrriffion from government to repa.r 
to Kintail with a fele£t body of men, to colleft the rents of that place, » 
name of his majefty. His intentions, however, were announced to the Km- 
tail men, who aflembled with great precipitation, and meeting Mr Rofs at 
a place called Lochan cloigh, ^ miles from Knocfin, a mufcet was fired from 
the fummit of a grove, hanging over a pond of water, the ball gra.mg Q.gb y

Led and wounded Mr Rofs's fon. This fecond alarm fo intubated the troops, 
that Mr Rofs was eafily perfuaded to offer terms of capitu at.on to the Km- 
tail men, at that time commanded by a Colonel Murchefon ; a gent eman, 
whofe natural parts alined him for a higher (ration.— Mr Rofs s fon,

Seaforth borders on extravagance ; and thofe who know them, 
allow chat their temperance and frugality merit imitation. It 
deferves to be remarked among the peculiarities of this parifh, 
that no male or female comes under the contemptible appella- 
tion of a drunkard ; and alfo, that there is not a M'Kenzie re- 
fident, or poffeffor, in the place, though it has been the property 
of that name for many generations. 

Cattle, Sheep, CSV. — The chief production is black- cattle ; 
on which account is has got the name of Kintail no Bogh, or, 
f Kintail of cows." It is not fize, but fhape and figure, that 
gives the Kintail cattle the claim to preference, in the opinion 
of drovers, who always expect to meet with three good pro- 
perties, a choice pile, weight, and fhort legs, in the true breed 
of cattle on the foil. Yet it may with truth be remarked, that 
few Highlanders are lefs attentive to the choice of bulls, their 
ftrefs being laid entirely on the rearing and feeding of calves. 
The number of black-cattle in the parifh amounts to about 
1200. The price of a milch cow in May is generally^' L. 5, 
and at Martinmas, L. 4. 

Every farmer rears a few fheep and goats, but their num- 
ber is very inconfiderablc •, and they are chiefly intended to reach 
at that pafture which, by its fteepnefs, is inacceffible to black- 
cattle. The fheep are of the low and common kind ; their 
wool, however is reckoned fine ; though of late, by the intro- 
duction of large tups, it is thought the quality is affected, and 
that the intermixed progeny infects the whole flock with 
braxies, and other unknown diftempers. The price of a goat 
is 6s. — and of a wedder, 8s. 

There are about 300 horfes in the parifh. Ploughing and c- 
very fort of labour is carried on by them ; but they are never 
allowed to pafture with milch-cows in fummer : for them, the 
benty grafs of the mountains are referved. The plough with 

which 



248 Statijikal Account 

which thefe horfes labour the ground is of a fingiilar conftruc- 
tion : The two handles are almoft perpendicular ; the plough- 
man therefore Hands in an erect pofition. Four horfes all in 
a breaft pull againft the beam in thongs of leather cords, ge- 
nerally made of the (kins of deers. Behind the ploughman, a 
man follows with a fpade to comprefs the ftrong furrows which 
refilled the fide boards. The driver confronts the ploughman, 
holding the reins of the horfes colle&amp;ed in a crofs ftick 3 feet 
long : in this aukward pofition, the driver moves backward ; 
and neither example nor precept can convince the people of a 

better mode of culture. Horfes for the plough are fold at 

L. 6 or L. 7 fterling. 

Agriculture, Produce, Isfc— Sowing commences about the 
beginning of April, and continues to the end of May : This 
period is occupied in fowing oats, barley, and particularly po- 
tatoes ; the greateft attention is bellowed on this root, as it 
makes up more than one-half year's fubfiftence, with the fifh 
and herring Lochduich furnifhes in the months of Auguft and 

September. Every tenant who farms L. 20 rent, generally 

has 20 milch-cows, and fows 4 bolls of oats, and half a boll 
of barley. Indeed, as is already obferved, the great aim is to 
have a plentiful crop of potatoes-, for the other crops have a 
variety of weathers to encounter, and cannot therefore be de- 
pended upon. The rnoft competent judges of the foil and cli- 
mate, fugged the plan of raifing potatoes and green crops as 

the beft Highland farming fcheme It is cuftomary to cut 

down a great quantity of natural grafs in the month of Auguft ; 
which, after receiving proper feafoning, is made into ropes of 
two fathoms in length, and then twilled two-fold : being thus 
compreffed, it requires lefs room in barns, where all their crops 
are laid up. This procefs has another advantage ; for, in this 
mode, it is carried with the greater facility, into diftant glens,

for the relief of weak cattle in ftormy weather. The land 

is divided into oxen-gates, pennies, and farthings. In the 
firft, there is room for 6 bolls fowing. The arable land with- 
in the parifh is indeed very inconfiderable, for 162 pennies, 
or 54 oxen-gates, comprehend the whole. It is found, that 
every penny of land, with its proportion of hill grafs, ought 
to maintain 8 milch cows, with their followers of yield cattle, 
that is, 3 heads, including the calf, after every milch-cow. 

Inconvenlencies The want of roads, fuel, and wood, are 

hardfhips with which the people ftruggle. The fcarcity of fuel 
arifes from the incefiant rains, the great expence of ferrying 
heavy mofly peats over arms of the fea, and of leading them 
from the fummit of high hills. To all thefe may be added, the 
want of fait : — this was never more feverely felt than on the 
29th of July, 1 79 1 ; when the take of herring in Lochduich 
i was fo immenfe, that a fingle boat killed 4 lafts in a night ; 
but when this fource of wealth was at the door, the parifhi- 
oners could find no fupply, and fome were neceflitated to com- 
mit the herrings to their original bed. The farms which are 

bafes to high mountains, as in Kintail, fuffer great lofTes from 
what is called Scriddan, or " mountain torrent." After hea- 
vy rains, the fummit of the hills are fo impregnated, that the 
mountains may be faid to be in labour, till an aperture is made 
by chance fomewhere on their fides ; the explofion which then 
fucceeds is loud and alarming. Gravel and marly ftones roll 
together, and defolate the fields beneath. The farm of Auch- 
uirn, in Glenelchaig, once a populous town, was, in 1745, 
rendered uninhabitable, and is fince converted to a grazing, by 
an awful Scriddan. The traces of thefe eruptions have, to the 
eye of a traveller, all the appearance of a military road, in the 
face of the fleep afcent of the mountain.

in Kintail: this defect, however, is nearly remedied by a ba- 
ron baillie, who vifits the place quarterly to fettle all differen- 
ces. Very great difcouragements are given to law-fuits of e" 
very defcription : the baillie in general is the fole arbiter. The 
recovery of fmall debts, encroachments on marfhes, and tref- 
paffing the laws of penfolding,; are the ufual fubjeds of dif- 
cuflion. 

Schools, Ecdefiajl'ical State, and Poor. — There is a parochial 
fchool at Croe-fide, with a falary of 200 merks ; and another 
fchool at Glenelchaig, fupported by fubfcription from the te- 
nants, many of whom are Roman Catholics. 

The heritors of the parifh are only two, Francis Humber- 
ftone M'Kenzie of Seaforth, and Alexander Chifholm of Chif- 
holm ; neither of whom refide. The king is patron. The rent 
is L. 800 fterling. The ftipend amounts to L. 55:11 : i-f 
fterling ; with L. 3 : 6 : 8 for communion elements, befides a 
glebe. There has been no augmentation of ftipend within the 

prefent century. Acatechift was eftablifhed at Glenelchaig, 

with a falary of L. 1 5, which is now reduced to L. 5. The 
prieft lives in the town of Dornie, where he has built a dwel- 
ling; but he has no meeting-houfe. The church is called 

Kiel-Duich. There are no traditional accounts of the original 
building. In 17 19, it was burnt by the fame (hip of war 
which demolished the caftle of Donan ; but it is at prefent in 
excellent repair. All the people from the parifti of Glenftieal 
bury in this church yard ; though it is evident, from the names 
of feveral towns in that parifh, they had once burial places a- 
mong them. 

The poor's roll contains 15 perfons : and fuch of thefe as 
are difabled by age or ficknefs are fupported by the inhabitants, 
who fend them fupplies by the hands of fome of their friends. 
The Sunday cclledlicns muft be very inconfiderable, as only

nie. From ill June to 12th Auguft, the people follow their' 
flocks to hill grazings. The annual diftribution to the poor, 

therefore, does not exceed 50s. or 60s There is no other 

public fund in the parifh except 50,000 merks Scotch, morti- 
fied by the late Mr Alexander M'Rae, of Dornie ; and left 
under the management of the King's College of Aber-

* Reafons for the growth of Popery, ift, The Prefbytery of Lochcarron in 
778 entered into a refolution, and patted an aft obliging every member thereof 
to keep regular regifters of baptifm. And that, inftead of the ufual due, one 
(hilling mould in future be exacted, to enable the fchoolmafters to keep up 

and pi eferve the regifters. Many of the mofl ignorant in Glenelchaig 

hearing of the new aft, confidered it as a heavy grievance ; and, to avoid its 
confequence, applied to Roman Catholic priefts for baptifm, and in the heat 

of paffion dragged whole families after them. ad, Popery has increafed 

by intermarriages. When a Proteftant man marries a Roman Catholic wo- 
man he has very little domeftic peace or happinefs till he profefles that re-

much as in fummer 1791, when 440 bolls of meal were im- 
ported, and fold in the pariih at 18s. 6d. per boll. The wound, 
however, was foon healed by the uncommon take of herring

Men-fervants generally receive from 30s. to 40s. The dai-

The cafcade of Glommach lies in the heights of Glenelchiiig;

* Remains of Antiquities— The caftle of Donan was built in the reign of 
Alexander III. of Scotland, to refill the depredations of the Danes. It com- 
manded a very extenfive profpe£r ; and is fituated in the weftern extremity 
of the parifti. It had the full command of Lochduich and Lochlong, fo as 

to fecure the parifh from annoyances by water. Colin Fitz Gerald, from 

whom is defcended the prefent family of Seaforth, was made ConTtable of 

this caftle, for the valour he difplayed at the battle of Largs in 1263. 

Previous to Sheriff-muir this caftle was taken from the King's troops by ftra- 
tagem. A neighbouring tenant having applied to the governor for fome 
hands to cut down his corn, as he faid he underftood from the face of the 
Ikies, and the croaking of ravens, that a heavy ftorm was impending, and 
that nothing but a fudden reparation of his crop from the ground could fave 
his family from ftarvation, the governor readily yielded to thefe preffing fol- 
licitations. But the foldiers, on their return, difcovered the deception too 
late ; for the Kintail men by this time were reaping the fpoils, and keep- 
ing poflefllon of the caftle.— At full fea, Donan is inclofed by water, and 

formed into an ifland ; but at ebb, is connected with the main land. This 
caftle was demoliftied in the year 1719, after the battle of Glenftieal, by a 
(hip of war. Some of the bullets are ftill found in moffy ground at the dif- 
tance of a mile above it ; and are ufed by fome of the oldeft inhabitants as 
weights to fell butter and cheefe. — It appears that when the caftle was en- 
tire, it confided of a tower and rampart ; the fragments of the former, which 
was built long before the rampart, meafure 4 feet broad. The only entire 
and remaining part is the fountain, which is ftill inclofed by a wall of 15 
feet high in an odlagonal figure. This draw-well was once drained at great 
expence, with the profpect of finding treafure, which was found to confift on- 
ly of fome filver fpoons and fmall fire arms : the water is ftill fweet and of 

good quality. The roof of the caftle was lead. The oldeft inhabitant of 

the parilh remembers to have feen the Kintail men under arms, dancing on 
the leaden roof, juft as they were fetting out for the battle of Sheriff-muir, 
where this refolute band was cut to pieces.

From the beginning of Auguft to the end of Semptember, 
there are 30, and fometimes 50, veffels in queft of herring in

to buy with ready money. Salmon, by reafon of the long

lorries, at a convenient diftance from the fea ; but the original 

inhabitants never allowed them to penetrate further. There 

are many monuments, of the remoteft antiquity, which not 
only prove the martial fpirit of our anceftors, but alfo, that 
they conducted operations with a method fcarcely to be ex- 
petted in thefe rude ages. For a tract of 1 50 miles, watch 
towers were erected in fight of each other. If an enemy land- 
ed, or if he was feen hovering in fight, in the courfe of two 
hours, the whole country was alarmed ; and the inhabitants 
repaired to the fhore, completely armed. The fignal was to 
kindle a fire in each of thefe towers ; and, as quick as lighten- 
ing, all were illuminated, and all the country in motion. ■ 

When any chief or hero diftinguifhed himfelf in battle and fell, 
a monument was erected to his memory. This monument 
confifted of a ftone fet up perpendicularly upon the fpot ; 
and the length of it determined the eftimation in which the

byOfiian,were a militia eftablifhed in Argylefhire, for thejpurpofe 
of defending the country upon any fudden emergency. They 
alfo were the dernier refort in battle, becaufe they were the 
belt men that could be picked from the whole diftrict. Their 
fame was fo great, that the lrifh were obliged to have recourfe

Of old. the chieftain was not fo much confidered the mafter as 
the father of his numerous clan. Every individual of thefe 
followers loved him with a degree of enthufiafm, which made 
them chearfully undergo any fatigue or danger. Upon the o- 
ther hand, it was his intereft, it was his pride, and his chief 
glory, to requite fuch animated friendfhip to the utmoft of his 
power. The rent paid him was chiefly confumed in feafts 
given at the habitations of his tenants. What he was to fpend, 
and the time of his refidence at each village, was known, and 
provided for accordingly. The men who provided thefe enter- 
tainments partook of them \ they all lived friends together ; and 
the departures of the chief and his retinue never failed to 00 

cafion regret. In more polifhed times, the cattle and corn 

confumed, at thefe feafts of hofpitality, were ordered up to 
the landlord's habitation : what was friendfhip at the firft be- 
came very oppreffive in modern times* Till very lately, in this 
neighbourhood, Campbell of Auchinbreck had a right to car- 
ry off the belt cow he could find upon feveral properties, at each 
Martinmas, by way of mart. The ifland of Iflay paid 500 
fuch cows yearly, and fo did Kintyre, to the M'Donalds : the 
Crown now has converted thefe cows at 20s. a head, and tak- 
en away this badge of flavery. 

The inconveniences, attending this {tare, arofe from the pet- 
ty quarrels between neighbouring clans : thefe took their rife 
from a fpirit of plunder and depredation, and from points of 
fantaftical honour ; and they feldom endured long at a time ; 
the weakeft party giving way, and keeping quiet until times 
and circumftances made him a match for his antagonift. It is 
remarkable, that no confiderable family was ever annihilated 
by thefe inteftine broils ; a proof, that they were not fo de- 
ftruftive as, at this diftance of time, we are apt to believe. 

At the period now under review, the Scottifh kings had no 
authority whatever in this part of the country ; on the con-

trary, the M'Donalds of the Ifles affumed regal powers, ard 
actually held parliaments, or meetings of a fimilar nature, 
where they enacted laws. — The difpute between Baliol and 
Bruce changed this fcene. The Bruces travelled through Ar- 
gylefhire in the courfe of their peregrinations. After they 
were eftablifhed upon the throne, this part of their domini- 
ons became an object. They brought the M'Donalds and o- 
ther clans to fome kind of fubordination. At laft, they built 
fortreffes ; and gave the command of them to military captains. 
From this time, in their different wars with the Englifti, they 
had recourfe to the afliftance of the Highlanders. It became 
necefTary for the chieftains to lead their followers to the low 
country ; and of courfe to contract debts. 

From this ?era, the condition of the middling ranks became 
worfe ; for the chiefs found it neceflary to lay on an addition 
to their yearly revenue, in order to defray the expence incurred 
in attending the fovereign. This innovation, in fome mea- 
fure, flackened the ancient friendfhip ; and, in order to en- 
force obedience, it was neceflary to have recourfe to penal laws. 
The king accordingly'gratified his feudal barons in this refpect ; 
indeed he could not act otherwife, for thefe barons were al- 
ways formidable to his throne. 

The firft dawn of kingly government produced gibbets upon 
almoft every feudal eftate. Without trial or jury, the proprie- 
tor hanged without mercy or remorfe. The evil became at 

laft fo flagrant, that a jury and bailliff or fherifF was intro- 
duced : but it did not cure the mifchief ; for this law-officer 
was frequently gratified for the blood he fpared ; and, if a" cul- 
prit was poor, he was thought a very proper fubject for the 
gallows. — In fhort, this defpotic fyftem was not effectually re- 
formed until the year 1748, when thefe abominable jurifdic- 

iions were totally abolifhed. The effect of this reformation 

was aftonifliing. No fooner were men emancipated from their 

fetters

fetters than they began to improve their properties. Within 
thefe 30 years, the face and condition of this country has un- 
dergone the happieft change, as appears by a variety of ufcful 
improvements. 

Extent, Soil, Climate, &amp;c. — The extent of this parifli is a- 
bout i2 miles in length, and 3 in breadth, An arm of the fea 
interfeclrs it nearly into two equal parts. It is bounded on the 
weft by the Atlantic ocean. The foil, for pafture and tillage 
is excellent; and of arable ground there is a very great proporti- 
on. The climate is rainy, as is the cafe all along the weft 

coaft ; but the rain is very favourable for the paftures. The 

inhabitants are healthy ; but, owing to their ftile of living, they 
are fometimes vinted with putrid fevers, which are often fatal, 
for want of ability to procure medical affiftance. In fummer, 
they live much upon fifh and milk ; and, it is fuppofed, that 
this mixture contaminates the blood. The practice of ino- 
culation has been a fortunate difcovery. In this diftrict, great 
numbers of children ufed to die of the fmall-pox, when it 
made its attack by contagion. 

Among the hills of this parifh there are many fmall lakes 
abounding in the fineft trout. Salmon is got in many places 
along the coaft ; and the herring pay an annual vifit to many 
arms of the fea, though not in great numbers. 

The hill called Cruach-Luffa is the higheft in the parifh. 
From the top of this eminence a ftranger, fond of the fub- 
lime, might entertain his imagination with one of the grandeft 
objeds in North Britain. From it may be feen, towards 
the weft, as much of the Atlantic as the eye can command, 
diverfified with a confiderable number of the Hebrides, Iflay^ 
Jura, Scarba, , Mull, Seil, and many fmaller iflands, fer- 
tile in corn, and abounding in the fineft pafture. The

north of Ireland, in a clear day, may be alfo diftinguifhed, and 
efpecially the iflafld of Rathlin. 

Between the iflands and the main land, the tide runs with 
a velocity incredible to a ftranger. Between Jura and Scarba, 
the fpace is about one mile over, in this narrow (trait. Three 
currents, formed by thei(landsandmainland,meetafourth, which 
fets in from the ocean; theconflux is dreadful, and fpurns allde- 
fcription: even the genius of Milton could not paint the horror of 
the fcene. Atthediftance of 1 2 miles, a moft dreadful noife, as if 
all the infernal powers had been let loofe, is heard. By the con- 
fli&amp;ofthefe inanimateheroes,who will not yield, though fighting 
twice a-day fince the foundation of the world, an eddy is form- 
ed, which would fwallow up the largeft fliip oftheline : but at 
full tide thefe combatants take a little reft ; and, when they 
are afleep, the fmalleft bark may pafs with impunity. This 
gulf is called Cory-vreckan. 

From this fcene, turning to the N. one beholds the hill of 
Cruachan, the higheft in Argylefhire, and among the higheft 
in Scotland. This mountain looks like the fovereign of all the 
reft. Even in the month of June, he does not put off his 
fnowy night-cap. The other hills, to the number of feveral 
hundreds, in comparifon look like mole-hills. Upon the face 
of this landfcape, a great many lakes fpangle to the fun beams, 
and form a profpect truly romantic. The largeft is Lochow, 
about 20 miles in length, and 3 in breadth. This lake abounds 
with plenty of the fineft falmon ; and what is uncommon, the 
feal comes up from the ocean, through a very rapid river, in 
queft of this fifh ; and retires to the fea at the approach of 
winter. 

Natural ProduBions, Cattle, and Sheep.— — The diftrict of 
this county, properly called Argyle, efpecially that part fituated 
near the coaft, is more fertile in grain than Grangers are apt to 

imagine \ 



of North Knapdale. 



imagine ; and the paftures produce the bed cattle that appear ia 
the Englifh markets from the Highlands. The mode of ma- 
nagement is extremely faulty. That part of the land, which 
is ftill in the hands of the farmers, is ploughed up every year : 
it is out of heart, and produces no adequate returns. 'The 
land, though of excellent foil, is poor ; of courfe the tenant: 
is poor alfo. The pafture grounds are always overftocked with 
cattle. No argument or intreaty will induce the tenants to re- 
ftrict the pafture to the numbers which would thrive properly. 
At the molt moderate calculation, one-third of the cattle fhould 
be reduced. — In the next place, no attention is paid to the 
kind of bulls j provided there be a bull, the kind is little mind- 
ed- This is a capital error •, for the mod luxuriant pafture will 4 
not produce good cattle without attending to the breed. It is 
not hereby meant that a ftrange breed mould be introduced j 
this would by no means anfwer as to any fpecies of cattle 
whatever : the idea is, to take the belt that can be found in. 
the country *. 

The principal caufe of bad management, as to farming, feems 
to be the following : — the generality of farms are poffeffed by

* Much induftry and expence has been incurred in introducing a breed 
of larger fheep to this part of the countiy. There cannot be a more capital 
miftake ; the natives of the foil, of whatever fpecies, anfwer beft. — The 
true highland fheep, if the experiment was fairly tried, would produce finer 
wool, and more delicate flefti ; the native wool now fells at'as. a ftone more 
than the Galloway wool, but it is contended, that the country breed does 
not arrive at fuch,a fize, or to fuch a weight of flelh. The faft is admitted ; 
but let one pafture native fheep in place of the foreign breed, and balance the 
account of profit and lofs, as follows : Native Iheep are notfo liable to braxy 
and other maladies as the foreign ; the wool is of fupcrior quality ; the flefli, 
is of fupcrior delicacy ; and upon the fame pafture that 8 foreign Iheep re- 
quire, io of the native breed may be fed : the argument here.is unanfwera- 

Befides no experiment has yet been tried to what fize the na- 
tive fheep could be brought.

Statiftical Account 



4 tenants : all of them fhould be reftri&amp;ed to 2 occupiers. 
The reafon is, that 4 tenants, with their families, are too 
great an expence upon the land, which is not able to fupport 
them properly, and pay the rent. Reduce the tenement to 2 
families, and both have a comfortable fubfiftence ; they have 
a greater intereft in the object ; the little contentions which al- 
ways diftracT; 4 are reduced to 2, and therefore agreater unani- 
mity fubfifts : the 4 alfo, by having too much time upon their 
hands, are perpetually turning up the ground not in heart, and 
that ought to lie fallow; their labour in fa£t is not worth 3d. 
per day; whereas, at real day labour under a mafter, they 
might earn is. 

State of the People ; Productions, l£c The population of 

this country cannot properly be faid to be upon the decline, 
except as to one particular, and that is, the monopoly of a 
number of grafs farms in the hands of fingle individuals. The 
high price of cattle, for fome years back, is the caufe of this 
check upon population. There are fingle men who occupy 
fome 8 and fome 10 tenements, upon each of which there is 
only one herd. This misfortune would not be fo very much 
to be lamented if thefe monopolizers had actually enriched 
their country in the fame proportion that they have been the 
means of reducing the number of its inhabitants. If the men 
muft take their departure, the leaft apology fliould be, that a 
greater number of cattle are raifed : this is by no means the 
cafe •, for, if 1 or 2 tenements out of 8 or 10 are excepted, thefe 
ingrofiers of land breed no cattle : their chief employment is 
to purchafe cattle, and to prepare them for the Scotch and 
Englifh markets. 

There are very few real good cattle bred in the country, tho* 
fo very well calculated for the purpofe. The proprietors of 
land, fuch as refide upon the fpot, for the accommodation of 

their 



of North Knapdale. 263 

their families, keep a few good milch cows near them ; and a 
very few fubftantial tackfmen raife all the good cows which are 
now fent to market. The great proportion of cattle that ap- 
pear in market are Hinted in growth, by the bad management 
of the farmer. Thefe fcraggy impoverilhed beafts are picked 
up by the monopolizers already mentioned ; they are turned 
for a feafon upon the defolate land ; and, in procefs of time, 
become fomewhat better ; when they are turned off to make 
way for a new fleece. Cattle, properly paftured, bring at an 
average L.5 a head at market ; but thefe impoverished and 

(tinted cows never exceed the price of L. 3 : 10. Were the 

monopolizers reftricted to one, or two farms at mofl, it would 
in a great meafure cure this evil, and would, at any rate, 
be the caufe of rearing better cattle, and in greater numbers. 

The people employed in cultivating the ground are general- 
ly in indigent circumftances ; but farmers and day-labourers ne- 
ver enjoyed better times. The moft of the young men go to the 
bufs-fifhing for one half of the year, and return with good wa- 
ges : fuch as ftay at home at day-labour receive between is. 
and f4d. per day. 

The produce of the parifh confifts of oats, bear, and pota- 
toes, black-cattle, fheep, and horfes. The rent is above L.3000 
fterling. In the year 1765, it did not amount to much more 
than one-half of this fum. 

The number of tenements are 61 of black-cattle 1200 
of fheep 1400 and of horfes 200. The quantity of grain 

raifed annually is confiderable The heritors are 12 in 

number. 

Stipend, Poor, and Population.— The tiends of the parifh a- 
mount to 262 bolls of vidua!, and L. 18 fterling of money: 
out of which the incumbent receives 72 bolls of viftual,

Mifcellaneom Remarks. — The Highlanders are naturally of 
a quick and clear underftanding, with lively paffions ; refem- 
bling the ancient Gauls more than their neighbours of the low 
country 5 being averfe to a fedentary life, but fond of thofe 
fcenes where honour can be acquired by perfonal a&amp;ivity and 
courage, and regardlefs of toil and of danger. Though fond 
of money, they are averfe to thofe habits of cool and flow ap- 
plication by which it is moft fuccefsfully acquired. By this 
part of their character they become, upon critical occafions, 
moft ufeful for the defence of the'ftate. — The late Sir Archi- 
bald Campbell was an heritor of this parifh. The rife of this 
diftinguifhed man may be fairly imputed to his intrinfic worth 

and fuperior abilities. To the morals of the lower ranks 

much praife cannot be given. This defect may be, in a great 
meafure, imputed to the want of education. A parochial fchool 
cannot extend its benefit to any confiderable proportion of an 
extenfive parifh. Even parochial fchools are but poorly en- 
dowed : the practice of private teaching in families has render- 
ed the better fort too indifferent as to this public object. The 
public, at large, do not encourage fchoolmafters according to 
their utility and importance in fociety. There cannot be a more 
fundamental miftake. Much of the peace and profperity of

correcting, will only exafperate untutored minds in ordinary- 
cafes. Upon any dangerous convulfion, or public commotion, 
thefe minds are eafily milled by men of factious fpirits ; the 
confequence of which is often anarchy and confufion, and the 
total fubverfion of peace and good order. Such evil con- 
fequences can never be prevented without knowledge and edu- 
cation ; and for this reafon men, in power and authority, mould 
pay particular attention to the fubjedt.

<p>
Name, Extent, Surface, &amp;c. 
TTILCHRENANfignifies, in the Celtic, the burying place 
ofChrenan, the tutelar faint of the parifh. Dalavich is 
fo called from its contiguity to the water of Avich ; upon 
which it has a meal and waulk mill. 

The figure of the parifh is nearly an oblong fquare, cut in- 
to two in the direction of its length by Lochow. The land 
rifes, by a gradual afcent on the E. fide, 4 miles to the fummit 
of a range of hills, called the Muir of Leckan ; and on the W. 
fide by a fimilar afcent, 4 miles to the fummit of another range, 
called the Mid-Muir. The muir of Leckan is 24 computed 
miles in length, and lies in the divifion of Argyle. The Mid- 
Muir, alfo 24 miles long, lies in the divifion of Lorn The 

length of the parifh is 12 miles, and the medium breadth 8. 
—As this is the only parifh in Argylefhire which has no fea- 
coaft, the odious and unprodudive tax on coals, with the ex- 

1 penfive 



of Kilchrenan and Dalavich. 267 

penfive land carriage, makes this neceflary article extremely- 
dear, particularly in thofe rainy feafons in which peats cannot 
be faved. 

As there has been no actual furvey of this parifh, the number 
of acres can only be computed by the length and breadth. The 
length, 12 miles, multiplied by 8, the breadth, is equal to 96 

fquare miles, or 61440 Scotch acres. The furface is much 

diverfified with heights and hollows, interfe&amp;ed by numerous 
ftreams defcending from the hills. Heath is the prevailing ap- 
pearance, excepting where the land has been in tillage. Near 
the fliore of the lake, there.is good natural pafture, much va- 
luable wood, and fome improveable mofs. 

Lakes, IJlands, and Cqftles. Lochow, with its numerous 

creeks and iflands covered with wood to the water edge, with 
many copious ftreams defcending from the hills, forming 
numberlefs beautiful cafcades, prefents to the view objeds 
well worth attention. Twelve of thefe iflands belong to this 

parifh. Surrounded by a clufter of other iflands, lies the 

beautiful one of Inifh-chonnel, with its caitle. This caftle, a 
majeftic ruin of great antiquity, now covered over with ivy, 
was for feveral centuries the chief refulence of the family of 
Argyle ; and appears, from the nature, ftrength, and fize of 
the building, to have been occupied by a powerful chieftain, 
whofe fway and extent of territory we learn, from record and 

tradition, to have been immenfe Near Inifh-Chonnel lies 

Inifh-Eraith, mentioned by Dr. Smith of Campbeltown, in 
his authenticity of Oman's poems, as the place to which the 
traitor Erath beguiled Duara, as recounted in one of the fongs 
of Sdma. In this irte are burying grounds, and the ruins of a 
chapel. Near this, is Elain n tagart, or « Prieft's ifle," with 
fome traces the prieft's houfe ftill difcernible. Lochow abounds 

With trout and falmon Lochavich, antiently called Loch- 

Lu ' luina 



^ Statijlical Account 

luina, is a beautiful fheet of water, of a regular triangular 
form, about 8 miles in circumference, full of trout ; having 
one caftle and feveral iflands, the refort of gulls, cranes, wa- 
ter- eagles; and wild-ducks Near this lake lay the fcene of 

anantient Celtic poem, tranflated by Dr. Smith, called Catb- 
luina, or » the conflift of Luina :" and in the lake is an ifland, 
the fcene of another poem, called LaoiFraoich, or « the death 
of Fraoch."— Many places in this neighbourhood are ftill de- 
nominated from Offian's heroes. This lake difcharges itfelf 
into Lochow by the ftream or water of Avich, buried in wood; 
having fix fine falls, with large circular ponds at the foot of 
each, and poffeffing the peculiarity of never freezing ; even 
in the year 1740, not a particle of ice was obferved on it, 
though the lake, from whence it ifiues, was entirely frozen 
over. 

Mode of Cultivation — The out-field lands are commonly in 
6 divifions. After a tathing, by allowing the cattle to lie up- 
on the field at night, and after milking at noon, two or 3 crops 
of oats are taken. The land then lies ley for 3 years. The re- 
turns are commonly from 3 to 4 bolls gray or mixed oats, per 
acre. The infield lands are in 4 divifions : from one, potatoes 
are taken, which are commonly very good ; from another di- 
vifion, bear, likewife good ; oats fucceed the bear, upon a third 
divifion of the in-fieldor winter town land,butarenotgood; and 
the fourth divifion is ley. The mod induftrious, who begin to 
know the ufe of lime, which they have in plenty, fow white in- 
Itead of gray oats ; and have upon their infield land pretty good 
crops. Would they be perfuaded to pay particular attention to 
the raifing of potatoes and other green crops from their in fields, 
with as much bear, hay, and oats, as they can properly drefs 
and manure, and allow their diftant out- fields to lie entirely in 
paftiire, they would certainly find it their intereft. The ex- 
pence 



of Kilchrenan and Dalavich. 269 

pence of raifing thofe crops often exceed their value.— Prevail- 
ing rains through great part of the year, with a precarious 
feed-time and harveft, render the climate of this country un- 
friendly to the growth of corn ; therefore the chief attention 
fliould be direded to the improvement of our grafs and cattle. 
—The inhabitants are beginning to keep fewer cattle, and of^ 
courfe, better grafs than formerly. The gentlemen are par- 
ticularly attentive in this refpeft. 

Mr Campbell of. Sonachan inclofes, drefles, and limes ex- 
tenfively for grafs- feeds. The farm upon which he refides, 
befides excellent pafture, gives him more hay than a numerous 
ftock of black-cattle and horfes can confume. Sheep he pays 
particular attention to ; and has more than once gained the 
premium given to this country for the belt tups — Mr Camp- 
bell of Kilmartin, who has refided only for a few years in this 
parilh, has neatly inclofed and fubdivided the farm he lives on 
for breeding a ftock of black-cattle : few in the county under- 
ftand cattle better, or keeps fo nice a ftock as he does. — The 
incumbent poffefles a well inclofed and fubdivided farm. From 
the arable land, he takes a rotation of oats, green crops, bear, 
and grafs-feeds, with lime or compoft. After one crop of 
hay, he paftures for feveral years; — ufes Small's plough, with 
two horfes, without a driver ; — keeps 400 breeding ewes of 
the fhort or Linton kind, which he intends crofling this year 
with Cheviot-hill tups. 

Woods, Inns , and Roads. Inclofing, cutting, barking or 

peeling, and coaling the extenfive woods in this parifh, employ 
many hands. The woods are purchafed by the Lorn and Ar- 
gyle furnace companies. The wages of the people employ- 
ed are, men from is. to is. 6d. women from 6d. to yd. per 
day. 

There are 2 inns in the parifh ; one of them a very good

Decreafe fince 1768 - 376 



The decreafe fince 1768 muft, in a great meafure, have tak- 
en place from the converfion of fome very indifferent corn 
farms, upon which a number of people made fhift to live, to 
very good fheep and black cattle grazings, to which, in this 
climate, fuch lands are beft adapted. Though this has had the 
effecl: of reducing the number of inhabitants in particular di- 
ftritts, it is fuppofed that, except when emigrations to foreign 
parts take place, it has neither tended to diminifh the popula- 
tion of the kingdom, to affect the profperity of this country, 
or to render the condition of the lower ranks much worfe. In-

deed, excepting upon the eftates of the Duke of Argyle, the 
Earl of Breadalbane, and a few others, fmall tenants in this 
country are very well fatished when they can fubfift their fa- 
milies, and pay their rents, without the addition of one fhillino- 
to their little (lock. Two families only have emigrated to 
North America from this parifli, for half a century. 

Mifcellaneous Remarks. — The inhabitants are all of the Efta- 
bliflied church ; and, to very few, have all been born in the 
parifli, and baptifed by the prefent incumbent, who is near 
80 years of age, and the oldefl: member of the fynod of Ar- 
gyle.— They are a fober, regular, induftrious fet of people ; 
generous, humane, high fpirited, and loyal, when called to 
the exertion of thofe qualities. In the year 1745, 80 able 
young volunteers offered their fervices to their country ; and, 
headed by the minifter, appeared at the crofs of Inverary in lefs 
than 24 hours after he had received intimation, from the Duke 
of Argyle, of his Grace's defire that he fhould repair thither, 
without lofs of time, with as many ef his parifhioners as could 
conveniently be fpared.— If occafion ftill required, the inha- 
bitants of this parifli would, with equal alacrity, turn out to 
defend their gracious fovereign, and that happy conftitution, 
under which they enjoy fuch invaluable bleflings.

(COUNTY AND TRESEYTERY OE LANARK, SYNOD OF 
GLASGOW AND AIR.) 

By tho Rev. Mr. William Miller.</head> 

<p>

Name, Extent, and Rivers. 
HT^HE appellation of the parifh is fuppofed to have been 
taken from fome perfon of the name of Crawford hav- 
ing had intereft in it ; and the addition of John has been affix- 
ed by way of diftinguilhing it from a contiguous parifh, called 
fimply Crawford, or fometimes Crawford-Douglas, or Lind- 
fay. It lies in a direction from W. to E. — then turns north- 
ward, being of an oblong kind of figure, extending to about 
15 miles in length, and generally to about 6 in breadth. A fmall 
river, called Duneaton-water, which has its rife near Cam- 
table at the head of the parifh, runs the whole length of this 
diftri£l ; and is well ftored with trout, as are alfo feveral o- 
ther brooks and rivulets in the parilh, particularly Blackburn, 
which is famous for a very excellent fpecies, reddifh in the 
flefh, and refembling that of falmon. 

Agriculture and Sheep. — Little can be faid as to the ftate of 

improvements 



of Crawford- John. 275 

improvements in agriculture, the land in general being more 
proper for fheep-pafture than for tillage. When the feafons 
are favourable, and the harveft early, the crops of grain are 
very good ; but it fometimes happens, in unfavourable fea- 
fons, that damage is done to the grain by frofts. In this cafe, 
the people are obliged to purchafe feed for the enfuing year 
from other places at a great expence. This renders them a- 
verfe to cultivate the quantity of land they otherwife might ; 
there being only 20 ploughs kept in the parilh, which, on an 
average, do not labour above 30 acres each. The rife that 
has happened in the price of fheep, tends alfo to produce an 
indifference about tillage. Befides, the cultivation of land 
for grain requires much laborious work, while the manage- 
ment of a ftore or fheep farm is attended with eafe and lei- 
fure. There are about 20 larger and fmaller farms in the pa- 
rifh, each of which have ground proper for both tillage and 
pafture. The fheep reared on thefe farms are of good qua- 
lity ; particularly on Gilkerfcleugh mains, from which ground 
tups and wool have been produced that obtained public pre- 
miums. The number of fheep in the parifh is faid to. be a- 
bove 12,000, though it cannot eafily be afcertained. The 
number of black cattle is likewife considerable. 

Natural Produ&amp;ions and Seats. — The natural productions 
are, oats, of which each farmer fows from 10 to 50 bolls ; 
bear, of which only from £ to 4 bolls are fown on each farm ; 
a little peafe ; fmall quantities of flax ; and fome potatoes. 
There is not much fown grafs here, the ground being gene- 
rally open, and not fenced from the fheep ; but meadow, or 
bog hay, is cut on almoft every farm. There are 2 gentle- 
men's feats in the parifh, Gilkerfcleugh and Glefpine. At the 
former, a ftranger is agreeably furprifed to find, in fo high a 
fituation, inclofures laid, out with much tafte and propriety.

PARISH OF <name ref="NA">EDDERACHYLIS</name>. 

(PRESBYTERY OF TONGUE, SYNOD OF SUTHERLAND 
AND CAITHNESS, COUNTY OF SUTHERLAND.) 

By the Rev. Mr. Alexander Falconer.</head> 

<p>

Date of EreHion, Name, and Extent. 
HPHE parifli of Edderachylis was erected, together with the 
parifhes of Diurnefs and Tongue, by the General Af- 
femby 1724, i n confequence of a petition, in the name of the 
inhabitants of the parifli of Diurnefs, prefented to the Ge- 
neral Aflembly 172 1, which was feconded by the then Lord 
Reay, fole proprietor of it ; reprefenting the great need there 
was for its being fubdivided into two or more pariflies, on ac- 
count of its vaft extent. 

The name of the parifli, as of all other places in this coun- 
try, is Celtic, being defcriptive of its fituation, and fignifying 
literally, « betwixt two kyles, or arms, of the fea becaufe 
of its lying being between Coalis-cuin, which divides it on the 
S. from Affint, and Caolij-Luifard, or Laxford, which, on 
the N. feparates it from Afhir. Caolis-cuin fignifies " the nar- 
row kyle and is fo called, becaufe of a narrow part about 
the middle of it, near Ifland-rannoch, where there is a ferry, 

which 



of Edderachylis. 279 

which is not above 60 yards broad, though it widens greatly 
above, and branches out into two confiderable kyles, or lochs, 
much frequented by herrings : it is alfo broad below this place, 
and inclofes a green ifland, called Stirks- ifland ; near which is 
good anchoring ground for fhipping. This kyle runs up into 
the land 5 or 6 miles. Cao/is-Lu/Jbrd, or, as it is pronoun- 
ced in the anglified way, Laxford, is a name compounded of 
two Celtic words, Lua and ard ; epithets given it, and to the 
river which runs into the head of it from Lochftack, from the 

rapid and high courfe of that ftream. But, though thefe 

two kyles ^comprehend the country called Edderachylis, the 
parifh extends a great way farther north, and includes alfo the 
Davoch of Afhir, which is a country of itfelf, interfered by 
a confiderable kyle, called Caolis- Inchard, 2 miles long, of- 
ten vifited by fhoals of herrings ; and it feparates that very 
rugged piece of ground, called Kerru-garbh, or " rugged quar- 
ter," from the north parts of Afhir, which are the belt por- 
tions of it. Inchard is a contraction of two Celtic words, In- 
nis and aird fignifying " high ""meadow," becaufe of the high 
and rich pafture grounds, lying on each fide of the kyle, and 
of the river, which runs into the head of it, and which go 

both by the fame name. As for the name of this part of 

the parifh, which the natives turn in Englifh, Alfhires, and 
fometimes more improperly Oldfhoars, in Celtic, it is Afhir, 
or, which is its real meaning, Tir-fas ; a defignation relative 
to that more fruitful and cultivated place, of which it was 
once a part, called Diurnefs, for it was the Fair-hir of old, 
or « wafte pafture grounds," belonging to the antient inhabi- 
tants of Diurnefs. 

The parifh is bounded on the W. by the Atlantic ocean, 
and on the N. by the North Sea, to Cape Wrath, that terror 
to mariners, which ftands at -the head of the line fepara- 
ting the parifh of Diurnefs from this ; fo that fc it is fituated

in the angle formed by the Atlantic and North feas. The 
length, from N. to S. is 20 computed miles, and the breadth 
10 ; Edderachylis being 12 in length, and 10 in breadth, and 
Afhir 8 in length, and 7 in breadth. 

Ecclefiajlical State.- Befides the parifh church, there is a 

place appointed for public worfhip, and at the diftance of fix 
miles from it, on the N. fide of the kyle of Inchard in Afhir, 
where it is the incumbent's duty to officiate once in fix weeks ; 
but as the parifh church is fituated as commodioufly as it pof- 
fibly could be, and pretty centrically upon the coaft, the at- 
tendance of the parifhioners there, efpecially in good wea- 
ther, is rendered quite convenient, as boats can convey them 
eafily from almoft the molt diftant parts of the parifh.— The 
church has undergone two feveral reparations within the laft 
20 years; has a flared roof; is well- feared ; and every way fit 
for the accommodation of the parifhioners. The manfe has 
alfo been twice repaired within the above time : it and fome 
of the offices have alfo flated roofs, as all the houfes in the coun- 
try ought to have, for nothing elfe can ftand the violence of 

the weather Upon the firft eftablifhmentof the parifh, the 

minifter had 800 merks for his ftipend, together with 4* 
merks for communion elements : but a reduction of it after- 
wards took phce on occa'fion of a contract:, entered into by 
the church of Scotland with confent of the then incumbent, 
with Lord Reay ; in whofe hand they fettled the whole mo- 
ney collected *, as a fund for paying part of the ftipends of the 
parifhes of Tongue, Diurnefs, and Edderachylis, at the rate 
of /\\ per cent. The portion of that collection affigned to this 
parifh was 11400 merks Scotch; the intereft of which fum 
being L. 28 : 10, together with L. 15 yearly out of Lord Reay's 

rent

rent, conftitutes the whole ftipend of Eclderachylis at this 
time, or L. 43 : 10 in all, communion elements included ; be- 
ing not only below the minimum of the law, but one of the 
fmalleft in the church. — And what precludes the profpe£t of 
any augmentation of the ftipend, out of Lord Reay's eftate, is a 
fpecial provifion he made in his contract with the church, that 
his eftate mould, in all future time, remain unaffected by any 
further augmentation of the ftipends, though a great part of 
that eftate confifts of church lands. But he and his fucceffors 
have given the feveral minifters of this parifh a fmall farm, ad- 
joining to the glebe, at the old rent, which is of considerable 
benefit for grazing.— The glebe, which lies upon the coaft, 
and near the church, is of fome extent ; and has been valued 
at L. 40 Scotch *i 

Population and Character of the People.— -Upon a late furvey 
of this parifh, the number of fouls contained in it were found 
to be 1024; but, about 12 years ago, they exceeded this num. 
ber considerably. One of the caufes of this decreafe has been 
the rife that has happened in the price of black-cattle, which 

Vol. VI. N n g:ive 

* Upon the fhore of the glebe, which extends about \ of a mile, grows a 
profufion of fea-weed, of the fort fitteft f or kelp : to this the prefent 
incumbent thought he had a right ; and that he might convert this fea-weed 
to his own benefit, as a fmall addition to his fmall ftipend ; but in this he 
unexpectedly found himfelf oppofed by the family of Reay, who thought fit 
to difp 0 f c of this very fea-weed, as well as the reft on their eftate by Ieafe 
to a Peterhead company ; and upon his giving interruption to them, he was o- 
bhged to defend himfelf in a procefs for damages before the Court of Sef. 
fion, who, after confutable expence and trouble to the .incumbent, thought 
fit to decide the affair againft him. He is thus deprived of the bene- 
fit of the whole fea weed growing on his glebe, which was ufeful to him 
for other purpofes, as manure to his land, and pafture to his cattle in the 
cold fcafon of the year. 



282 Statijlical Account 

gavcoccafion to fome gentlemen, not rending in the parifh, to 
take leafes of extenfive grazings in it, which they manage by 
a few fervants. Other people of fubftance living in the parifh 
have, on the fame account, alfo taken leafes of additional 
grazings, removing the old pofieffors. Several families 
befides, not fatisfied with their circumitances, as well as fe- 
veral (ingle perfons of both fexes, have migrated to the fi. 
country, and to cotton mills. The return to Dr. Webfter in 
1755, however, was only 869 fouls. 

The number of baptifms in the year, as appears from the 
regifter, is at an average 35 ; but there is no record of burials 
kept; becaufe the people, experiencing great inconvenience 
in carrying their dead to one or two burial places, as in former 
times, on account of the great difhmce, and the ruggednefs 
of the roads, have made choice of other places, the fitteft 
they could find, near their refpeclive dwellings, for that pur- 
pofe ; fo that, in this parifh at prefent, there are no lefs than 
8 different burying grounds, though fome of the old ones are 
prefently in difufe. 

The inhabitants, or natives, (who are all, except a very few, 
of three names, M'Clays, Morrifons, and M'Cleods), are all 
Prefbyterians, and have been fo, for fo long a time back, that 
the prefent generation have no remembrance of feeinp in the 
country any refidenter of another perfuafion. Notwiihftand- 
ing their detached and dlftant habitations, they are remarkable 
for their attendance upon divine ordinances and public wor- 
fhip, for the fobriery and regularity of their manners and 
lives, without being addicted to any particular vice in any re- 
markable degree. Their character for peaceablenefs, and 
their harmony among themfelves, is uncommon. For the kft 
20 years and more, fcarce one inftance has happened of any 
quarrel or fight among them, or fo much as of any of them 
receiving any bodily hurt from another. From their practice 



of 



of Edder achy lis. 283 

of iifhing, and early and conftant acquaintance with the fea, 
they are excellent boatmen, as well as ingenious, and ready to 
learn any mechanical bufinefs ; fo that fcarcely any artificers 
in the parifh but are felf- taught. And yet there are among 
them pretty good carpenters andboat-wrights,dry-ftonemafons, 
coopers, and net-makers; and,as for fhoe-makers, there is fcarce 
a man in the parifh but can make his own fhoes. They lerve 
alfo to appear as decent and clean as poffible ; fo that the fi fli- 
ers, who frequent this place, have declared they make the 
mod decent and cleanly appearance of any Highlanders on 
the whole coaft. The Mufes too are partial to the natives 
of this place, as if the air of the Edderachylies mountains had 
infpiration in it ; for there have been, of late years, feveral 
poets in this parifh, whofe compofitions, moftly of the lyric 
kind, have been admired by good judges, and have {hewn 
them to be poffeffed of uncommon parts and genius. 

Black-Cattle, Sheep, Goats, ami Horfes. — The principal de- 
pendance of the inhabitants for their living is upon their black- 
cattle ; and, by a late enumeration, they are found to have 
2573 heads of the cow kind. The quality and fize of thtir 
cattle are equal to thofe of any other place in the Highlands. 
The price of an ordinary cow for droving, is 50s. — of a good 
one, L. 3; — and of the beft, L. 4. An ordinary milch-cow fells 
at L. 3 ;— a good one at L. 4 ; — and the beft at L. 5. There 
are drovers, in the country, who buy up fuch cattle as are fent 
to market ; and, after driving them to the fouth of Scotland, 
and fometimes to England, difpofe of them commonly to En- 
glifh drovers. But, though the inhabitants deal principally in 
black cattle, yet, in the opinion of the moft knowing people, 
the nature of the country feems more adapted to the rearing 
of Ihccp ; and it is thought, that it is owing to the inattention 
and carelefsnefs of the farmers, about that moft ufeful of all a- 

N n 2 nimalsj

that they do not thrive better with them. Foxes, fc.

-ons p^^ this country might be, in time, clLed D f 

were Lord Reay to parcel out his lands in proper fheep walks 

per dwellings upon the fhore, that none in Scotland would 
equal thofc upon his eftate, and that he might treble his rent 
&amp;y it. 1 he only inconvenience would be, that he would by 
this plan, greatly depopulate his country. 

The whole number of fheep, prefently in this parifh, is 
found to be 2629. The greateft part of them are of the Gallo- 
way breed, having black or brocked faces, and their wool i 3 
coarfe. A fheep, with a lamb, is fuppofed to be worth 7 s 
and a good wedder, 9 s. But there is alfo a mixture of an En- 
ghfh breed with the common Galloway, which are polled, with 
white faces; thefe have rather finer wool, and longer bodies, 
than the Galloway kind. Sometimes butchers from Invernefs' 
and other places, travel through the country, and buy what 
wedders are to be fold in thofe parts-, and feamen have alfo 
a great demand for mutton, often greater than can be an- 
fwered here. 

Of all parts of the Highland3, this would fcem to be one of 
the fitteft and beft for goats; yet it is the obfervation of 
the oldeft and moft judicious people, that they have not for 
fome years anfwered here as formerly; whether owing to fome- 
thing unfavourable in the weather, to the increafe of beafts 
and birds of prey, or both. The prefent number in all this 
parifh, is 1307. The cn!y market for them is felling them •

to fea-faring men, when they fall low in provifions : they com- 
monly give 7s. or 8s. for an he 3 and lefs for zjhe goat. 

As for horfes, the principal ufe of them here, is the rearing 
of them for fale, there being but little occafion for thefe ani- 
mals in riding orhufbandry. The kind bred here is the Gar- 
rons, which are never houfed, feed themfelves in the mountains 
in fummer and harveft, and pafture near the houfes in 
winter and fpring. They are of of a good fize ; and not inferi- 
or in quality to any in the the Highlands. Some of the beft 
aTe fuppofed to be worth 7 or 8 guineas. Here they are 
bought by dealers, in the country, at a year old, who carry 
them to the Orkney iflands, and there difpofe of them at good 
prices : of late, purchafers from the fouth have found their way 
into the country, who buy all forts at good prices. The num- 
ber prefently in the parifh is 351. 

Rent, Fi/hings, tsfc. — The prefent rent of the parifh is L.230 
fterling ; but the tack-duty, paid out of mod of the different 
pofleffions, has been of late greatly augmented j that of fome 
of them to double, or more, of what they paid 20 years ago : 
yet it is reported, that when Lord Reay became proprietor of 
Edderachylis, properly fo called, the whole of it was held by 
a gentleman in wadfet for the intereft of 6000 merks. — There 
are only two rivers in this parifh where falmon are caught. 
One of them is at Inchard, which never paid any feparate 
rent to the proprietor; but the tackfman of the neighbouring 
grounds has the profits of it, which amount only from 3 to 6 bar- 
rels in the year. The other is Laxford, where there is a con-

Surface 



of Edderachylis. 287 

Surface and Agriculture. — The face of the country, like ihe 
reft of the Highlands, is mountainous and rocky, and, to a 
ftranger, ftiockingly rugged. The more inland parts, which 
eonftitutes Lord Reay's deer foreft, are nothing but a vaft 
group of dreadful mountains, with their fummits piercing the 
clouds, and divided only by deep and very narrow vallies, 
whofe declivities are fo rugged and fteep, as to be dangerous 
to travellers not furnifhed with guides. Yet thefe wilds afford 
excellent pafture, in many places, to all forts of cattle, being 
clothed, to the tops of the higheft mountains, with clover and 
daifies, and other rich pafture. In many places numbers 
of deer are to be feen, very large and fat, efpecially in the 
harveft feafon ; for looking after which certain perfons, called 
forrefters, are appointed with falaries, in convenient parts of 
the country. The bounds of the foreft are very extenfive, 
making a confiderable, if not the greater part, of Lord Reay's 
eftate ; but that part of it which is reckoned the beft, and a- 
bounds mod with deer, is that which belongs to this parifli. 
The inhabited places are only thofe next the fea, and fome o- 
thers on the confines of the foreft, which happen to be fome- 
what level, and thereby fitter for rearing cattle, or the culture 
of corn ; and though, towards the coaft, the ruggtdnefs of 
the ground be lefs, and the mountains feemingly fublide, or 
prefent a lefs awful and horrid appearance, yet rocks and 
marfhes, lakes and mountains, though of lefs magnitude, are 
all along continually intermixed ; fo that, excepting pafture for 
cattle, it feems but very indifferently calculated by nature for 
any other purpofe. It is matter of no fmall difficulty, even on, 
the fhore, to find a lot fit for a houfe to ftand on conveniently, 
without under water, or fome other remarkable difadvantage. 
— And as for the villages or dwellings, where the inhabitants 
make a fhift to rear fome corn, they have fo ^reat labour in 
clearing their little plots (many of which are no larger than the

With all its difadvantages the e&amp;ri* of all inflruments is the fitteft f or 
turning up the ground in the country ; for among fo many rocks, a plough 
can do httle or nothing, and, where no rocks are, the earth is commonly 
frnuffhy, that cattle are not able to pafs over it, without finking deep. 

Therefore 



of Edderachylis.

The crops raifed in this country are only oats and bear al- 
ternately. The kind of oats which anfwers bell, is found to 
be a large bodied grain of a black colour, and a thick coat, 
which ripens early, and meals well ; and the bear is the kind 
commonly ufed in the Highlands. Potatoes, though lefs than 
30 years ago fcarcely known here, now conitkute a confider- 
able part of the food of the inhabitants. . 

Notwithstanding the ruggednefs of the ground, and the 
wild appearance of this country, fcarce any place affords a- more 
commodious habitation to poor people, if th^re are any fuch iri 
it. For upon a farm of 20s. and fometimes only of iost 
many families want none of the ( neceflaries of life ; hav- 
ing bread and potatoes, fifii and fome flefh, wool and cloth- 
ing, milk, butter, and cheefe, all the fruit of their own iu- 
duftry, and the produce of their farms. Their fuel they have 
alfo good, and on eafy terms, every farm having plenty of 

peat moffes free to all. Travelling, it mult be owned, is 

difficult and difagreeable, there being no roads, but fuch as 
the feet of men and cattle have made ; yet, when one has oc- 
cafion to come, to it, and remain there, he will find it as con- 
venient for the purpofes of living as moft parts of the High- 

Vol. VI. O o lands. 

Therefore it is of pretty general ufe in the Highlands, and is of great antique 
ty. One man can turn over more ground with it in a day than four are able 
to do with a common fpade. For a fmgle man to delve as much ground as 
will require two pecks of bear feed in a day is nothing uncommon ; nay, 
fome have fown four in a day's work. There are many inftances of fmgle 
men in this parifti, who with good feafons have reared as much corn as, with 
the help of potatoes, has fubfifted families of 6 or 7 perfons plentifully, by 
the Caffcrom. But for this they have one advantage, denied to" many c- 
thers, that there is always plenty of manure ; for befidcs what the cattle 
furnifh, there is almoft every where the greateft profufion of fea-ware, which 
makes the beft manure, efpecially when cut early in the fpring and mixed 
with earth.

frequented by fhippi„ &amp; any neceffaries the place itfelf cannot

Ffier h SsV.-What Edderachylis has been, and 
Kill is, happy iri, far beyond other parts of the Highlands, is 
the fifhmg upon its coaft, and its many excellent bays and har- 
bours, where fhipping of all fizes can enter, and moor clofe 
to the land, at all hours of the day and night, in perfea fafe- 
tjr. Of thefe harbours are, Loch-Badeaut, erroneoufly marked 
Badwel m fome draughts of the coaft ; Loch-Caha, which Gg- 
nifies hterally in the Celtic, * good harbour ;» Laxford, hav- 
ing feveral good anchorages, of which IJland an Brinish, or 
«' the Infhman's ifland," is the beft ; Feaunach Moir, near 
the entry, is a very fafe place ; Inchard has alfo a good har- 
bour ; and fo has Kyles-cuin, near Stirk's-ifland There 

has not only been a greater quantity of fifh killed on the coaft 
of this parifh, for fome years paft, than on the coaft of any o- 
ther place in the Highlands, but more herrings than what have 
been killed on all the coafts of all the Highlands put together. 
Here there is no perfon whofe fole bufinefs is fitting, confe- 
quently no fifh is fold, excepting herring; yet every man is a 
fifher, and fifhes for himfelf. Every village, and almoft every 
houfe, has a boat, nets, and all forts of fifhing tackle ; yea, 
fome houfeholders have 2 or 3 boats, for anfwering different 
purpofes. In fummer, glaffocks, or fays, are got in great 
plenty. In July, fhoals of mackarel, the forerunner of the 
herring, appear. Soon afterwards, almoft every creek and 
harbour are quite full of herrings ; and fometimes they remain 
off and on the coaft to about Chriftmas ; at other times, they 
leave the bays all at once in September, and no more is feen 

of them that year. Haddocks are killed on this coaft alfo, 

and in fome years in great numbers, and they are commonly 
3 larger 



of Edderachylis. 291 

larger and fatter than in almoft any other place ; but again for 
feme years, few or none of them are found. The uncommon 
goodnefs of them, and the other filh caught here, muft be 
imputed (to the proximity of the Atlantic and North feas, 
and that there are fewer in purfuit of them than in more popu- 
lous places. 

In the year 1789, three veffels from Murray, bound for 
Barra-head filhing, being forced into Inchard by ftrefs of wea- 
ther, and wind-bound there for fome days, thought fit to try 
their luck where they were, and met with wonderful fuccefs 
in killing both cod and ling; fo that they were in fufpenfe, 
whether to proceed to Barra or remain there. They declared 
that, from former experience, they could hardly expea fo 
great fuccefs, in fo Ihort a time, in Barra ; that the cod here 
were larger and fatter than there, at the fame time of the year ; 
and, if the ling would come in their proper feafon, which was 
not then commenced in this place, in as great plenty as they 
ufed to do at Barra-head, they could not but think this a bet- 
ter filhing liation ; becaufe what ling they had taken here, they 
found to be very good, and rather larger, as well as the cod, 
than thofe they ufed to find there ; fo that it is more than pro- 
bable, had the joint (lock company a proper reprefentation 
laid before them of the fitnefs of this parilh for a filhing fixa- 
tion, they would confider it, (as it in all likelihood is), incom- 
parably more deferving of being at the expence of an eftablilh- 
ment for the purpofe of filhing, than either Ullapool, or 
Tobermorie, or perhaps any other place in the Highlands. 

IJlatids. — In Edderachylis, and on the coaft of it, there is a 
number of fmall iflands of different fizes, many of them af- 
fording pafture to fmall cattle, efpecially lambs, in fummer 
and harveft. In thefe fpots they require no herding, and are 
fafe from foxes. The only inhabited ifland is Handa. It is

Migratory ■ 

* Here once lived Little John MDhoil-Mch.HulJhJan, a gentleman of the 
Aflmt M'Leods, who were a branch of the M'Leods of Lewis, or Sbiol Tor- 
quil. He was low of ftature, but of matchlcfs ftrength, and fkill in arms • 
kept always a bierlin or galley in this place wn* 12 or 20 armed men, ready' 
for any enterprise. Some alledge he pratfifed piracy j but of this there is no 
certainty. By him it was that judge Morifon of Lewis, of whom fe- 
veral refpetfable families now living there are defended, was flain. This 
judge had King James VPs. commiilion for maintaining juftice and good or- 
der in that country ; and though he was murdered by this M'Leod, it was 
for no perfonal quarrel, or injury done M'Leod himfelf, but in revenge of his 
being inftrumental in putting to death one of that family, who acled as 
laird of Lewis. The preceding laird of that place dying without lawful ifiue, 
but leaving a number of natural fons, (fome fay 60), a contention arofe a- 
mong them about the fuccellion to the eftate. The eldeft being not fo po- 
pular among the name, as one other efpecially, the fon of a gentlewoman 
■whofe parents were of confiderabk influence among the tribe, was obliged to 
leave Lewis, and live upon the main land. Judge Morifon being inform- 
ed that there was a French veflel employed in killing fiJh contrary to law up- 
on the neighbouring coafl, fent for the reputed laird, who lived near that 
place, and taking alfo a party along with him, boarded this vefTel, and 
»?ade her a prize ; but whether by firefs of weather or defign, they came 



of Edderacbylis. 293 

Minatory Birds.- Ifland Handa is remarkable for being the 
refort of vait numbers of fea-fowl of different kinds, which 

about 

to anchor below the houfe of the eldeft of the brothers upon the main land, 
x,ho in this way getting his rival within his power, had him immediately put 
to death by hanging him up, thinking no more was necefTary to Ins feffi- 
ceeding to the pofieflion of the eftate of Lewis. But the death of the fa- 
vourite young man fb irritated the whole clan of M'Leod, that they *- 
folved nothing except the death of the judge Humid atone for if, and tfefe 
Litti* John MDboilmbicb Huijbdan, being univerlally reputed the fitteft per- 
fon for this enterprise, it was committed to him accordingly. The judge, 
informed of his danger, thought fit to come and wait on the matter of Reays 
who then lived in Diurnefs, about the Chriftmas holidays, in order to prevail 
with him, to proteft him, and to threaten John M'Leod from atttemptmg 
any thing againft him. But John M'Leod being told of the judge's having 
left his boat at Inverchirkak in Affint, waited for him there in his return, 
flew both him and his brother; and after this went to Lewis and married 

the judge's widow. On account of the barbarity and cruelty of thefe 

M'Leods at this time, and their murder of a very promifing youth whe 
was the rightful heir of the eftate of Lewis, immediately upon his coming 
home to his eftate from Edinburgh, where he had his education under the 
King's eye, and this murder of judge Morifon, of whofe integrity his m*. 
jefty had a high opinion, the king difpofed of Lewis to a company of ad- 
ventures from Fife and Dundee, whofe hiftory is well known. 

Among the numerous iflands on this coaft is one called Elan a Ehriu, er, 
the Ifland of the Judge, from the above mentioned Judge Morifon. After 
he had been flain, his friends in Lewis came in a galley to bring home his 
corpfe ; but contrary winds ariling drove them with the body on board to 
this ifland, where they found it convenient, after taking his bowels out, t© 
bury them ; and the wind foon after changing, they arrived in fafcty at 
home. This fmall ifland, which furnilhes good pafture for lambs, being 
about 4 acres of extent, is poffefled by the prefent minifter of Edderachy- 
lis, as it has been by all his predeceffqrs in office by the gift of the family 
of Reay. 

All thefe iilands, and many more, fome of them inhabited, and others af- 
fording excellent pafture, and of confiderable extent, from Roe a Stoir in 
AfTint to Stroma in Orkney, are faid to have been granted in property, and

said M'Kay begot, who was the firft laird of Edderachylis of the name of 
M'Kay. 

Who the earlieft inhabitants of Edderachylis have been, is not now eafi- 
ly diicoverable. After the moft diligent inquiry among the oldeft and moil 
intelligent people, all that can be learned is, that two or three centuries ago 
this place was but thinly inhabited; and, that the inhabitants were fuch as 
held their pofleflions by no legal tenure, paid no rent, and acknowledged no 
landlord or fuperior. The firft who are faid to have held it in property 
-were M'Leods, a branch of the Lewis family, or Shiol Torquil : but prior to 
their eftablifliment as proprietors, tradition reports that in the time of the 
Norwegean kingdom of the weftern ifies, thefe iflanders made frequent 
defcents upon the coaft, and fometimes not without bloodfhed, while they 
attempted plundering the few inhabitants of their cattle, and carrying them 
off in their boats. The laft of the M'Leod family, who died the acknowled- 
ged proprietor of Edderachylis, and feems not to have been of the family 
of Alfint, was called Macbe a Leijler • probably on account of the firft of 
principal man of the tribe being remarkable for flcill in making arrows, 
for Macbe a Leijler is, literally, " the fon of the arrowmakcr." He having no 
children by his wife, brought over from Aflint, a nephew of his wife, called 
James, the fon of Roderick, the fon, John Moir M'Leod, to live in family 
with him, and fucceed him in the pofferTion of the eftate at his death, 
which accordingly happened ; but he, being of a turbulent and factious dif- 
pofition, had quarrels with feveral of his neighbours, particularly the Mo- 
rifons of Diurnefs and Afhir, fome of whom he put to death. The Laird 
«f Farr alfo, Sir Hugh M'Kay, having occafion to remit a fum of money to 
Edinburgh, the bearer of it next day returned to him, after being robbed only 
one day's journey from his houfe, by a party of armed men having their 
faces difguifed with black paint, whom every one fuppofed to have been 
fent upon that enterprize by James M'Leod of Edderachylis. As the Mo- 
rifons of themfelves were not able to bring James to talk for the injuries 
done themfelves, they contrived a plan for it, by bringing the M'Kays to 
their affiftance. The principal man of the name of Morifon at thai time 
in A(hir, had in his houfe and family, a baftard fon of the Laird of Fan's 
(Donald M'Kay) the fame already mentioned, as begot in the ifland of Loch- 
Stack ; him he propofed both to the M'Kays and to his own friends, to

6e La.rd of Edderachylis, if by their joint effort, James M'Leod was made 
•way with 5 and all agreeing to this propofal, the plan for effecting it 
to engage a coufin of James M'Leod's, one Donald M'Leod, fo„ to Mur- 
«tow; fon to John Moir of Affint, to take away his life : this bufmcfs he 
«s reckoned the likelieft, and fitteft to perform, being a notorious ruffian 
and, » order to hinder James's friends from profecuting revenge afterwards 
when the deed fhould be perpetrated by one of thwnfdves. The reward 
promifcd Donald, induced him readily to undertake it, which was, that he 
ihould have the half of Edderachylis for himfelf, and his offspring and 
that the mother of this Donald M'Kay, the baftard, fhould become his wife 
Hereupon, a party of the Morifons from Afhir, headed by Donald M'Kay 
the bartard, and Donald M'Leod, who among other qualifications, was in- 
comparably fkilled in handling the longbow, marched in a dark morning 
for Edderachylis, though not diretfly towards Scoury, where James M-Leod 
lived, but to fome other places nearer them, where James's beft friends, and 
ibleft fupporters dwelt, in order to difpatch them firft; which having 'done, 
and three or four men, whom they furprized in their beds in their feveral 
dwellings, cruelly Haifa, they proceeded to Scoury ; where, after flaying two or 
three more of the M'Leods, they found James, upon getting fame notice 
Of their approach, had taken fhelter in a fmali houfe he had fometime be- 
fore built in the middle of a lake in Scoury. But with arrows, having fire- 
bound to them, this houfe, being thatched with ftraw or reeds, was foon 
made to blaze, when he was obliged to come out ; whereupon Donald, his 
coufm german, killed him dead with a mufket bullet. And as James had 
a fon of his along with him in this ifland, Donald did for him alfo; for af- 
ter he had fwam to the farther fide of the lake, and endeavoured to run for 
his life, he flew him with an arrow from his long bow. 

James M'Leod, or M'Rory, being in this manner flam, Donald thought 
himfelf fure of pofleffing at leafl half of Edderachylis, according to agree- 
ment, but here he found himfelf miftaken ; the Morifons now told him, he 
mult be content with fome other reward, for that Donald M'Kay mult have 
all Edderachylis : whereupon Donald in a rage declared that would not do, 
and immediately betaking himfelf to his friends in Aflint, in a fhort time re- 
turned with a body of men to take pofleffion. But the Morifons, aware of his 
motions, prepared to meet and fight him upon his firft entering the country;

as often as they can, to come with boats to this place, and

ind as both parties were ready for an engagement in a place called Maldy, 
Sir Hugh M'Kay of Far prefented himfelf to them upon the top of a hill 
hard by with 300 men, and finding how matters flood, immediately called 
both before him to a conference in order to an accomodation, which none 
of them durft refufe. At this interview Sir Hugh propofed to Donald 
M'Leod, that he Ihould refign his pretentions to Edderachylis in favour of 
his fon Donald, and that he himfelf, in confideration of his doing fo, would 
grant him other land near himfelf, called the Davoch of Hope, as alio Do- 
nald M'Kay"* mother to be his wife ; which propofal he at once agreeing 
to, the whole difference ended and peace and harmony took place. This 
promife Sir Hugh aftually fulfilled, giving Donald the Davoch of Hope, 
where he lived to an extreme old age, with a family of fix or feven fons, 
continuing the fame ruffian to the laft. He was buried in the kirk of Di- 
urnefs, where, upon the fouth wall on the infide of the building, there is a 
monument of his with the initials of his name, and his arms cut out in the 
ftone, and the year 1619. What became of the fons cannot be difcovered, 
but the lands of Hope are in the poffeffion of the Reay family, as a part 06 
their eftate. 

In this manner came Edderachylis into the hands of the M'Kays, or that 
branch of them who call themfelves the family of Scoury ; but of them 
there were only three proprietors before it became a part of the eftate of 
Reay ; the firft of thefe was Donald already mentioned, the fecond his fon 
Hugh, and the third his fon Hugh, who was the famous general M'Kay^ 
commander in chief of the forces in Scotland under King William III. He 
was born in Scoury, this parilh, and as George Lord Reay married his daugh- 
ter, he gave him Edderachylis, as her tocher. 

Next as to A(hir or Fafhir, the northern part of this parifli, which, as be- 
fore obferved, was the wafte or uninhabited parts of Diurnefs. It, as well

an equal weight of wool. The flefh of the birds, (the young

forts of game ; deer, roes, mountain hares, which varv their 
colour according to the feafon of the year, being white in win- 
ter, and brownifh gray in fummer ; moor fowls, black cocks, and 

tarmigans, 

to this event, cannot now be afcertained by any traditional account; but 
Morifon at this time gave it its prefent name of Diurnefs, from the place of 
his nativity, fo that it cannot be confidered as local or defcriptive ; but up- 
on being eftabliflied in his newly acquired cftate, he brought over with him 
from Lewis a colony of no left than f.xty families, moflly of his own name, 
to whom he gave lands upon his own property; hence it is that the name 
Of Morifon is fo prevalent in thefe parts, for though the property be fallen 
into other hands, the flock of the inhabitants remains. Some generations 
after this, it happened that the defendant lineal of this Ay Morifon died 
childlefs, and left a widow, a Sutherland woman, daughter of one Donald 
Bain Mathefon then proprietor of Sheenefs. This woman, finding herfelf 
ill ufed by her late hufband's relations, eloped in the night, carried with her 
the rights by which the Morifons held Diurnefs, went to Dun-robin, the 
Earl of Sutherland's feat, and delivered thefe papers into his, hands. Pof- 
fefled of thefe rights only, the Earl confidered himfelf as intitled to 
claim Diurnefs for himfelf, and confequently had great bickerings with the 
Morifons to bring them to pay rent to him ; but they continuing obflinate 
and refraaory, and being encouraged in an under-hand manner by the laird of 
Far and his agents, the Earl at length became tired of contending with 
them, and agreed with the laird of Far, anceftor of Lord Reay, to give Di- 
urnefs to him for a feu duty of 60 marks in the year ; and in this manner 
came the Reay family to be poflelTed of this eflatc, but .the feu duty, 
though frill continued, is now reduced to a triflq.

&amp;^ans; wild-pigeons, partridges, and all kinds of fmali 
birds, with great varieties of fea fowls. 

There are in the parifh confiderable woods', in the more in- 
land parts, fit for building houfes, and making farm utenfils, 
softly birch, and far from the fhore : thofe which antiently 
grew upon the more, of which there are ftill fome remains m 
different places, have been deftroyed. 

There are appearances of mines in this parifh, which have 
never yet been inveftigated by •perfons of (kill, as well as white 
marble, particularly in Foinne bhew, a part of the deer foreft. 
Near Ifland-Handa, upon the main land, is found a kind of 
light grey coloured ftone, heavy, and perfedly free of fand 
and gritty matter, and of fo fine a confidence as to admit of 
being cut and fafhlpned with a knife, and bored through with 
a gimlet, without thefe tools being hurt by it. It is ufed by 
many for Tinkers to their hand lines in filhing. , 

The air is reckoned wholefome, though often damp, from 
the vicinity of the ocean, and of very high mountains, but the 
frequency of very violent ftorms purifies it. The thatched hou- 
fes, which all the houfes here are to a very few, require a new 
cover every year to render them water tight ; and the {luff u- 
fed for this purpofe is either ftraw, long grafs, rufhes, fern, or 
heatKjbutthis cover muft be bound artfully withnew ropesmade 
of either heath, ftraw, or the crops of trees twilled, all which 
occafions no frna.ll trouble and expence to the inhabitants, yet 
without them, every houfe would infallibly be unroofed, and 
deftroyed in a fhort time. Rains here are frequent and heavy, 
but not quite fo frequent as in moll places to the S. of thU 
coaft, and the weather is generally milder ; for though fnow 
falls deep fometimes, and remains long upon the higheft .moun- 
tains, yet upon the fhore it is fcldom of any continuance, for

the matters orders cannot be difputed, but at the rilk of being 
turned out at the term, when, with the character of being re- 
fratfory, no other tackfman will be ready to receive them, and 
they muft be fet a-drift, which is a dreadful fituation toapoor 
man with a wife and family. A tackfman, whofe lands are 
cxtenfive, has it in his power in this manner to eafe himfelf of 
a good deal of expence in the way of hiring fervants to do his 
work, which is a great . advantage, efpecially in fuch a place as 
Edderachylis, where fervants are fcarce by reafon of fo many 
of them being employed in kelp, fifhing, and the management 
of cattle. The rents therefore each of thefe fubtenants will 
have to pay, muft not exceed what will be barely fufficient for 
his circumftances, 20s. or peihaps 10s. and often not fo much, 
that the tackfmen may have as many hands to work for him as 
poffible ; but as he gives them commonly their maintenance 
when he employs them, to eafe himfelf in this article he calls 
them out the feldomer. 

Servants being fcarce in this country, fome tackfmen have 
fallen upon a way of providing themfelves, by giving a piece 
of land equivalent to the wages of a fervant for a year to % 
man with a family, on condition of giving him his fervice (at 
one half of that time, by alternate weeks, and paying half the 
rent of the land along with this fervice. But the fitted and 
beft kind of fervants for this country are the domeftic kind, hav- 
ing no family of their own. About 30 years ago, and later, 
the beft men- fervants here were hired for 7 or 8 merks in the 
half year; but now, they muft have 20s. with perquifites; 
the beft maid-fervants then were fatisfied with 3 merks wa- 
ges in the half year ; but now they get 6 or 8 merks, alfo 
with perquifites. Many fervants of both fexes have of late 
fallen into a way of going to the fouthern parts of the nation, 
where menial fervice {lands higher ; and yet, when diftrefs

of Edderachylis. 303 

It is pleafant to obferve the progreffive date of civilization 
in the Highlands of Scotland, and in this place in particu- 
lar, compared with the ferocity and barbarity of the laft cen- 
tury. Then, a Swedifh veffel of confiderable fize, happen- 
ing to caft anchor in Kyles-cuin, attracted the rapacious 
attempts of fome young men in the neighbourhood ; who, to 
the number of 12, boarding her in the night with blackened 
faces, fhot the captain in his cabin, mattered the crew, wound- 
ing fuch as refilled, and then carried off all they coveted of 
the goods, leaving the remaining part of the hands to fail off 
with their fhip. Next year, another {hip appearing on the coaft, 
and continuing to hover nearer land than any o{ the beholders 
could underftand the meaning of, a number of men from the 
fhore, obferving her motions, took a boat, and made towards 
her ; but approaching pretty near, faw feveral men from the 
{hip jumping into the.Jong boat, armed with muikets and o- 
ther weapons ; and fo, not liking their appearance, thought 
beft to fheer off with all fpeed towards the fhore ; but, finding 
themfelves purfued by the long boat, and ready to be overtaken, 
they landed upon the firft ifland they came to, but in landing 
received the fire of feveral mufkets,by which one man was (lain. 
who cried out as he was dying, " I have got what I deferr- 
ed," meaning his having killed the captain of the Swedifh veC- 
fel, for he it was who fhot him. Upon this, the long boat re- 
turned, and the veffel failed off. 

' Difadvantagcs I. The want of arable ground for produ- 
cing corn. With the bed feafons, the crops raifed in this pa- 
rifh will hardly be fufheient for two-thirds of the inhabitants \ 



rity from the ravages of wolves, which were numerous and deftru&amp;ive in this 
country, and where they were not wholly deftroyed till of late. 



3°4 Statijlical Account 

yet, by being fituated at no great diftance from Caithnefs, this 
difadvantage is in fome meafure obviated. 

2. The want of roads within the country, and towards other 
places. Were the people called out, and made to work upon 
the roads according to the ftatute, travelling here might in time 
be rendered commodious and eafy. 

3. The want of fchools. There is indeed a legal falary of 
100 merks for a fchoolmafter, but that, without other emolu- 
ments and fchool fees, is no fufficient encouragement for one 
properly qualified ; and the great diftances of the feveral habi- 
tations, and the want of fit houfes for boarding, render it im- 
poffible for a fchool here to be of general benefit to the people. 
A few years ago, the Society for propagating Chriftian Know- 
ledge gave a fchoolmafter to this parifh with L. 10 of falary, 
yet all at once thought fit to remove him, becaufe there was 
no greater number of fcholars than 17 attending the fchool; 
yet, had they duly confidered the fituation and circumfhnces 
of this place, they might have eafily feen, that granting the 
means of inftru£tion to 17 fcholars in this remote quarter, 
was a greater charity by much than giving a fchool to a popu- 
lous inland parifh, like Kiltearn in Rofs-fhire, which could 
fo eafily maintain a fchoolmafter for itfelf, and yet that was 
the place to which they removed our fchoolmafter. 

4. The want of communication with poft towns, which is not 
only grievous to the inhabitants, but alfo a public difadvantage 
and lofs. This is a place of general refort for all kinds of {hip- 
ping, on account of the many excellent harbours, where they 
ride in fafety in all weathers. Here, therefore, before they 
face the North feas in their outward bound voyages, they 
are ready to put in, and defirous of acquainting their em- 
ployers and friends with their condition ; and alfo, in their re- 
turn from thefe feas, they are in the fame way willing to give 
information to their concerns at home. Befides, the fleet

home concerning their affairs } and, as early information of 
the ftate of the filhing is of the greateft importance, that in- 
formation might be given was there once a regular commu- 
nication eftablifhed with the neareft poft town : the want of 
this, laft feafon, was attended with immenfe lofs ; for while this 
fleet were lofing their time doing little in the bays to the S. our 
creeks and harbours were full of the fineft fifh, and there was 
none to take them for, as the inhabitants had no fait for cur- 
ing, and could find no buyers, they defifted from killing them. 

The expence of a weekly courier from hence to Tain, 

which is only a diftance of 40 miles, though too heavy for the 
inhabitants of this place, would be only a trifle to the public, 
and would be richly compenfated by the benefit arifing from it 
to the community. At prefent, a few of the parifhioners are 
at the expence of a runner, once in the fortnight, from this 
place to Tongue, a diftance of 22 miles and bad road, where 
there is a weekly communication with Thurfo,

<p>
Name and Extent. 
*pHE parifhes of Wiftoun and Robertoun were united in 
1772. Robertoun was probably fo called from feme 
eminent perfon of the name of Robert, or from fome opulent 
family having conferred it as a portion upon a fon of that name. 
-Wiftoun, in old papers Woolftoun, derives its appellation 
from wool ; for about the middle of the village, which gives 
name to the parifh, near the church, there is a green mount, 
called the Crofs, where in former times wool was fold. Situ- 
ated betwixt the low and the high lands, or betwixt tne arable 
ground and the ftieep farms, it muft have been a convenient 
place for a wool market ; and fo might naturally have obtained 
the name of Wools- town. 

The unitedparifbes extend about 5 milesalong the weft banks 
of the Clyde, whofe courfe here is nearly from S. to N. It 
is almoft equally extenfive in the oppofite direclion. 

HeritorSj 



of Wijloun and Robertmn. 307 

Heritors, Agriculture, Produce, CsV—The heritors are 6 in 
number, 2 of thefe have each a fmall or moderate farm in the 
parifh. One of them farms his own property, which is part- 
ly inclofed and fubdivided. The prefent Lord Juftice Clerk is 
the only confiderable heritor. He has a feat in the parifh, 
round which his Lordfhip has made great improvements in 
farming, planting, and. inclofing. There are no inclofures or 
growing timber worth mentioning in the reft of the parifh. 

The mode of farming which prevails here, is much the fame 
as has obtained from time immemorial. Even about the vil- 
lage of Wiftoun, the tenants of the croft lands have not their 
poffeffions feparately divided, but intermingled with one ano- 
ther in fmall fpots here and there, or run-rig. This, however, 

is not the cafe through the whole parifh. The foil, efpeci- 

ally about the villages, is good, and the land lets high. There 
is lime in the parifh, but the road to the kilns is often fcarcely 
pafTable. There are commons, moors, and mofles, in the 
parifh. 

The chief produce is oats and barley, which are allowed to 
be very good, and much more than fufficient for the inhabi- 
tants, though the fituation is high, and the climate rather cold 
and damp, which often occafions late harvefts. The crops 
here have been very defeftive fince the year 1782; perhaps 
crops 1788 and 1791 may be confidered as exceptions. — Thir- 
lage, with very high multures, prevails here. — Befides arable, 
there are a good many fheep farms, particularly in the upper 
part of the parifh. Several farms let for about L. 100 per an- 
num. As in other parts of the country, fo here too, the num- 
ber of tenants has been much diminifhed by the conjoining of 
farms. — Agricultural labours and improvements, which, to- 
gether with tending cattle, are perhaps the moft natural and 
falutary occupations of man, do not flourifh here. Trade and

In fpnng mh there were refiding in the united parifh 740 
perfons, 370 males, and 370 females. The number of fami- 
lies was 182, which at an average is about 4 perfons to a fa- 
mily ; 27 of thefe families confifted of fingle perfons. There 
were 214 married perfons ; 54 widowers and widows ; about 
140 under 9 or 10 years of age ; feveral perfons about 80 _ 
one 82,-one 83,-one 85,-and one 88, years old. Each 
of thefe parifhes feems to have been as populous, or nearly fo, 
50 or 60 years ago, as the united parifh now is. This opini- 
on is grounded on the regifter of births and marriages, which 
about that period feems tp have been pretty accurately kept, and 
on the accounts of old perfons in the parifh. The decreafe is ea- 
fily accounted for:— from one farmer now occupying what fe- 
veral had occupied formerly ; -from arable land being con- 
verted into ftore or fheep farms ;-from a greater number of 
cattle and horfes being reared ;— and from people of late years, 
particularly young perfons, removing to places where there 
are manufaQures and public works. Hence one caufo of the 
great proportion of deaths, by a number of old people being 
left in the parifh, while their children remove.— For 4 years 
preceding 1792, the yearly average of births in the united pa- 
rifh is 15 ; of marriages, 7; and of deaths, 16. In 1791, ix 
were born, and 21 died : fince the commencement of 1792, 
4 have been born, and 1 1 have died. From fo few years no 
certain calculation can be made : however, it evidently appears 

that

that the number of inhabitants has been decreafmg rapidly of 
late, and continues to decreafe. 

Houfes, Difeafa, and Fuel. The houfes here in general 

*re bad. A good many people die of a kind of confumptions, 
conjoined with, and terminating in, rheumatic pauis and 
fwellings; induced, perhaps, by living meanly in cold damp 
uncomfortable cottages. Inoculation is little praftifed here ; 
but the natural fmall pox has feldom proved fatal in the parifh. 
The fuel is coal from the neighbouring parifhes of Douglas 
and Carmichael, The price was much advanced fome years 
ago, 

Poor.— There is, ftriftly fpeaking, no poor's roll. Thofe in 
need apply occafaonally, as defired and encouraged, to the 
minifter or elders, and receive fupply, or any farmer or neigh- 
bour applies for them. The fick are fometimes affifted •, and 
fome have the fchool-fees of their children paid by the parifh. 
Since 1780, the collections at the church doors, and the in- 
tereft of a trifling fum of public money, have anfwered the 
exigencies of the poor. Sometimes the effects of poor per- 
fons, who have received much from the public funds, are 
added to thefe funds at their death. None ftroll out of the pa- 
rifh to follicit charity ; but vagrants from every quarter refort 
thither. Generally fpeaking, the poor in this place are rea- 
fonable in their demands, and live contented on little : this 
holds not only with refpect to thofe who apply for aid from the 
public funds, but to many other houfeholders. It is fometimes 
neceffary to prefs aid on the neceffitous, fuch is their modc-fty. 
Sometimes two widows, or fingle women, join in onccottagc, 
to fave houfe-rent and fuel ; and many, even fuch as are ad- 
vanced in life, fupport themfelves by fpinning flax, and work-

Extent, Rivers, Fifberies, &amp;c. 

THE parifh of Loth lies on the N. fide of the Murray Firth. 
The arable or inhabited part is bounded by the fea on 
the S. and S. E. and on the N. and N. W. by a ridge of high 
mountains running parallel to the fhore. The length of the 
parifh is 14 miles, and the breadth, where broadeft, not above 
|, and in fome places not ^ of a mile. The river of Helmf- 
dal, in the Celtic Avonuillie, near the northern extremity of 
this diftria, ifiues from a number of lakes in the parifh of Kil- 
donnan ; the molt diftant of which, for they are joined toge- 
ther, borders on Strathnaver, in the parifh of Far. Its courfe, 
from the laft lake to the fea, is from N. W. to S. E. for the 
length of about 20 miles. It is a pity there is no bridge at 
Helmfdale •, as all travellers, to and from Caithnefs and Ork- 
ney, are obliged to crofs the river, which they do either by a 
ford, or in a paffage-boat j but in a fpeat, the one method is im-

practicable, and the other very difficult. About a mile fr vl 
the mouth of the river are cruives for intercepting the falmon • 
and the privilege of fifhing here is rented from the Sutherland 
family by a company, for L. 133 fterling per annum. This 
company has of late ereded a boiling houfe at Helmfdale, 
where not only the falmon of that river, but likewife thofe of 
Brora and Shin, are boiled for the London market. The ri- 
ver of Loth, near the other extremity of the parifh, has no 
permanent fource, and very little -water in fummer. It rifes 
in the neighbouring mountains; and has two branches which 
meet at a fmall village called the Glen, about a mile above the 
place were it falls into the fea. This Glen, or Glen-loth, is 
a fmall farm, fitter for producing grafs than corn, and has 
for a long time paft been the refidence of one tenant; but of 
late, feveral families have begun to build and take up their re- 
fidence to the N. of the old farm houfe, and to extend their 
cultivation towards Duchal. The number of inhabitants at 
prefent in this trad, which may be called the highlands of 
the parifh, including men, women, and children, amounts 
to 68 or 70 fouls. It is upon the fpot where the hunting houfe, 
mentioned by the late Mr Alexander Pope, minifter of Reay, 
in his account of Sutherland and Caithnefs, publifhed in the 
Appendix to Pennant's Tour, flood, that one of thefe colonifts 
has pitched his tent, by which that monument of antiquity 
is deftroyed. The Piaifh caftle of which Mr Pope fpeaks, is 
on the N. fide of the river, about a furlong below the place 
where the two branches meet ; a little below this building, is 
the cataract he mentions. It is impoflible to conceive what 
could induce him to talk of fine fifhing in the river Loth, for 
there is no fuch thing, though, perhaps, a falmon might have 
been caught in it occafionally, or by accident. One fummer, 
the Helmfdale company employed a boat and crew for about 2 
months in the mouth of the Loth : they caught feveral falmon »

but the fuccefs was not fuch as to tempt them to continue 
their operations. This river falls into the fea, in a channel 
cut through a rock 20 feet high, by Lady Jane Gordon, Coun- 
tefs of Sutherland * Before this channel was cut, the courfe 
of the Loth was eaftward through the low grounds of Crakag 
and Lothmore. This river is very rapid, and fometimes im- 
paffable in fpeats upon thefe occafions it is more formidable 
to travellers than Helmfdale, becaufe on the latter there is a 
pafiage boat, whereas on the former there is no refource but 
to encounter the ftream. A Caithnefs poft was drowned in 

attempting to crofs it in i 7 5S and an excife officer ' S fervant 
perifhed in it in the fame way foon afterwards. There are 
four rapid burns in the parifh to the S. of Helmfdale, befides 
the burn of the Ord to the N. of if, in the laft a young man 
and his wife perilhed in a fpeat, being carried down by the 
ftream over a high precipice, about 20 years ago. The rivers 
and burns abound in trout. The road through the parifh is 
dry, and would anfwer well for travellers on horfeback and 
on foot, if there were bridges over thofe ftreams ; but it is 
not adapted for wheel carriages. 

Soil, Manure ) Produce.— r V\idoi\\s generally good, and the a- 
rable part of it in conftant culture, produing a crop every year, 
as far back as the memory of the oldeft men or even their fathers. 
All the tackfmen and tenants have one half of their arable 
land in bear, and the other half in oats and peafe. The bear 
land gets two furrows and is manured, but that for oats and 
peafe gets only one furrow without manure ; fo that the land 
is manured every fecond year. The ordinary manure, and what 
anfwers beft for bear is fea-ware, but it is believed to have lit-

« other times they entirely fail. The fame may be faid of the 
beans, of which a few are fown inftead of oats or peafe in 
deep or very wet grounds. The great dependence of the farm- 
ers, therefore, is upon the bear, of which the parifh yields 
near 3000 bolls yearly. When well dreffed, each boll is f d - 
dom belo s ftonc weight, and often a ftone or two more. 
Ihe foil m f 0me places is faid to be well adapted for lint, but 
hitherto the attempts to rear that ufeful plant have been few 
and feeble, and therefore not followed by any beneficial effeds. 
There is very little paft ure ground in the w parfcs of ^ 
nfh, and therefore few cows are maintained in it in fummer. 
A great quantity of potatoes are raifed, hardly an inhabitant 
of the panfli but has a plantation of that ufeful root, which is 
generally planted after a crop of bear, and prepares the ground 
for another crop of grain. The deer of the foreft of Steitil 
are very troublefome to the people of the glen in fummer and 
harveft, by eating their corn. 

Rent, Stipend, kV.-The Countefs of Sutherland has the 
whole property of the parifh, but there are 6 wad-fetters, of 
whom 2 refide. Several gentlemen of property have taken farms

offices, and fome are inclofed with ftone dykes. Some tacks-

marriages have hitherto been ill kept, and frequently negleft-

40, of marriages 24, and of burials 16. There is no fund for 
the poor but the weekly colleaions, which are very Mi little

give their alms in meal at their houfes or at the mills, and the 
gentry are frequently their own almoners. There are 5 mil- 
lers, 3 fmichs, and 7 or 8 wrights •, but fome of them have 
land, and hardly any have conftant employment in their dif- 
ferent departments. There are alfo taylors, fhoemakers, and 
weavers ; but thefe, for the molt part, are likewife labourers 
and cottars. There are 2 dr 3 pedlars that import from Aber- 
deen or Glafgow fuch things as the common people have oc- 
cafion for ; but hardly one of them depends entirely on that 
commerce for his living*.

account of the diftance of the peats, and the badnefs of the 
road j fo thar all the peats are carried home in back loads on 
horfes. Some of the gentlemen have of late begun to import 
coal, which though dear, they have found to be very conveni- 
ent. There are quarries of lime ftone and free ftone on the 
fhore i as alfo fome detached blocks of a very hard and beauti- 
ful kind of granite, which Jones, who travelled the country 
lately in queft of natural curiofities, fays, is fufceptible of a 
fine polifh, and the beft he ever faw except the Italian. There 
are fome rocks of parrot-coal in the fea under Crakag, which 
are acceffible at ebb. The bell- ware on the fhore is cut every 
third year, and made' into kelp. 

Population, Horfes, Cattle, and Sheep.— As there are no 
manufaftures or fifheries eftablifhed in the parifh, or any im- 
provements in agriculture introduced, the number of inhabi- 
tants has not increafed or diminifhed much fince the com- 
mencement of the prefent century. There is a yearly emi* 
gration of young people of both fexes to the fouth of Scot- 
land; few of whom return. No account has been kept of 
thefe emigrants, and therefore their number cannot be ex- 
aftly ascertained. It appears by a decreet of locality in 
1722, that the number of catechizable perfons at that time 
was 1000. The return to Dr Webfter in 1755 was "93 foul s. 
And in fpring 1791, the number of the whole inhabitants a- 

mounted to 1370. They purchafe yearly feveral horfes at 

the Dornoch markets, as the manuring the ground with fea- 
ware, which, as well as peats, they carry on horfe back-loads, 
occafions a great confumption of that fpecies, of which there 
are about 500 in conftant work, and very few of them are

reared in the parifh MM BefiJes thefe, the gentlemen keep 
riding-horfes, which are occafionally ufed in the harrow 5 fome 
of the tackfmen have likewife begun to ufe carts and wains 
for carrying manure, but that method of labouring has hither- 
to made very little progrefs. There is a good deal of the land 
ploughed with horfes, but ftill more with oxen, of which there 
are about 300 kept for that purpofe alone. The number of 
milch cows is above 200, and that of fheep, betwixt 1 500 and 
2000. There are likewife a good many fwine reared j they 
are all confumed in the parifh. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations.—The climate Teems to be upon 
the whole healthy. The people in general live to a good old 
age, though they are not inftancesof remarkable longevity here. 
The molt common difeafes, efpecially amongft thofe of advan- 
ced life, are cougho, aflhmas, and the rheumatifm. As to the 
moral and religious character of the common people, they are ge- 
nerally fober, ferious, and induftrious, attentive to their bufinefs 
and credit, humane in their deportment, refpeftful to their fu- 
periors, and ready to fhew kindnefs to ftrangers. No doubt 
there are exceptions, efpecially amongft the loweft clafs ; of 
whom there are many addicted to pilfering, when they expect 
to efcape detection, or to come off with impunity. The bet- 
ter fort have an high veneration for the forms of religion, and 
are very drift in the exercifes of devotion in their families, 
and in attendance on public worfhip, of which there is no form 
but that of the eftablifhed church in the parifh. This uni- 
formity of opinion as to doctrine and worfhip is not confined 
to this parifh, but extends over all the country •, which is an 
uncommon appearance in a free nation, and amongft protef- 
tants, not owing to any thing peculiar in the inhabitants of Su- 
therland, but entirely, to their local fituation, and external cir- 
cumftances. However though there be no open fchifm to di-

vide them in public worihip, they have their lay- leaders, fome 
of the boldeft and moft conceited fpeakers at fellowfhip meet- 
ings, whom they implicitly believe, merely on account of 
their high pretenfions and affe&amp;ed fanttity, by which they im- 
pofe upon the people, and frequently miflead them. Of late 
they have begun to keep fellowfhip meetings amongft them- 
felves, without the prefence of a minifter. To thefe meetings 
they covene at certain fixed periods from different parifhes, 
propofe queftions in divinity, explain fcripture3, and give a 
fanction to any doctrines or opinions that are confidered as 

orthodox by the prefiding faint. The evil confequences of 

thefe meetings on the heads and hearts of the people are be- 
gun to be too clearly feen by the clergy ; but they have, not 
been able as yet to devife a method of fupprelfing them ; if 
they are allowed to proceed, it is not eafy to fay, in what they 
will terminate at laft*.

* The remains of feveral Piftifli buildings are to be feen ; one on the ihore 
below the church, which with its out-works, covered a great extent of 
ground, is almofl effaced, as moft of the ftones ufed in building the manfe 
and church were dug out of its ruins, as were likewife very lately the ftones 
of a farm houfe. In digging thefe laft feveral deer-horns and human bones 
•were found. 

A green mote ftood on the banks of the river of Loth, which the gentle- 
man- that now poflefles Lothbeg ordered to be dug up. There appeared 
a fubterraneous dwelling, furrounded on the outfide with large flat ftones, 
which feem to have made a part of the wall ; the rubbifti was cleared away, 
and the ftones left in the fame fituation in which they were in the old fa- 
brick. 

In an adjacent field, the fame gentleman having ordered the ground to be 
cleared of fome cairns, in order to inclofc it, there were two (lone-coffins 
found, and in them feveral urns of clay-ware, which the workmen broke 
•with their fpades before they difcovered them. On the Ihore, in feveral 
places where there was a beautiful furface of grafs about 36 years ago, breach- 
es have been made by fand-blowing, that have difcovered about ten or twelve 
feet below that furface, of which fome detached fpots remain, an area of

tranfported to Eddertoun in Rofs-fhire in 1 730. It was dur-

Garty, which is faid to have been the field of a bloody battle, betwixt the 
Sutherland and Caithnefs men ; the particulars of this engagement, under the 
name of Strcnrunkic, ufed to be a frequent and familiar fubjea of converfation 
in the young days of the oldeft men in the parifh ; but they themfelves re- 
member nothing but the tradition of the battle. On this fpot are the re- 
mains of an edifice refembling the other Piftifh buildings in the parifh ; in 
which was found fome years ago, the entire fkeleton of a man, who, by the 
fize and length of the bones, muft have far exceeded in bulk the common 
ftandard of the prefent days. There is a pretty extenfive plain in the moor 
above Garty, to the weft of Helmfdale, which is faid to have been the field 
of another battle, fought at an earlier period than that of Stranrunkie. A num- 
ber of tumuli are ftill to be feen in this place which is called Lonrihomajh. In 
a valley, betwixt two high hills, is a large (tone fixed in the ground, and 
(landing pretty erect, evidently raifed by art, as it is of a cylindrical form, and 
more than ten feet high above the level of the ground ; it has no difcernible 
Wcription, or carving of any fort ; neither is there any tradition as to the 
caufe for which it was erected. Near it arc other two ftones of a frnaller

(presbytery of chirnside, synod of merse

By the Rev. Mr. George Cupples.</head> 


<p>
Extent, Name, C3V. 

THIS diftri£l extends 4 Englifh miles from E. to W. and 
about 3 or 3^ from N. to S. Swinton and Simprin 
became one parifh by annexation, and by the tranflation to 
Coldftream of Mr Jolly, then minifter of the latter, on the 
24th September 176 1. This tra£t is very irregularly inden- 
ted ; Swinton, the principal village where the church and 
manfe ftand, is too near the E. end, and the N. fide, to be quite 
in the centre of the parifh ; but in fo fmall a diftri£t no real 
inconvenience is felt from this circumftance. As to the ori- 
gin of Simprin or Simpron, it is uncertain what it means. 
There is hardly any doubt but Swinton was derived from fwine, 
with which the adjacent plains abounded, and by which they 
were infefted of old. Heroes, it is fuppofed, firft became fuch 
by clearing the earth from favage animals, and thereby aflert- 

ing 



of Swinton and Simprim 323 

ing man's fupremacy in the globe ; fuch a hero became the 
founder of Swinton family, by refcuing thefe fields from def- 
truftive animals, and enabling his difmayed country men to eat in- 
ftead of being eaten by them ; he had thefe fields affigned him, 
and has tranfmitted them to a very long feries of defcendants. 
This fadfc does not reft merely in tradition, for it is certain 
that fwine make a great figure in the arms of the family ; that 
there are feveral perfons who ftill retain the name of fwine 
without the additional fyllable ; and that the animal itfelf, no 
longer an object either of terror or of fuperftition, is now be- 
come a favourite fource both of commerce and food to the in- 
habitants.— The appearance of the parifh is in general neither 
uniformly flat, nor is it mountainous or rocky ; it exhibits a 
fet of gentle elevations in long ridges, generally from E. to W. 
with alternate flats betwixt them. The foil for the moft part 
is fertile, and to a very high degree productive of grafs, na- 
tural or artificial, and grain of all forts ; except fome of the flats, 
a few of which are too marfhy for corn, and even rather un- 
manageable as to grafs, if the feafon be not uncommonly dry. 
The foil in general is deep 5 below what has been already 
mellowed by frequent tillage, by manure, and change of crops, 
a ftrong tenacious clay prevails to a very great depth. Of 
courfe, the roads are deep, miry, and often almoft impaffa- 
ble in winter ; when new made, they feldom continue good 
for any time ; gravel is diftant and often fcarce \ and the clay 
foon fwallows up fuch hard materials as are employed. It ap- 
pears that the art of road- making ftill wants much ofthatperfec- 
tion which it formerly had, and may perhaps attain. The fame 
foil, which is miry and dirty in winter, is devoid of moifture and 
parched in dry fummers, expofing the inhabitants at one time 
to all the inconveniencies of exceffxve moifture, and at other 
times to all the hardfhips of exceffive drought. Cattle have 
been driven from the N. fide of the parifh to Blackadder, and

from the S. fide to Tweed, for water; but the ingenuity of the 
times has now in a great meafure fupplied this defed, by deep 
ponds or very deep wells ; and this diftricl is now very rarely, 
though fometimes, diftreffed by want of water. In fpite of thefe 
and other inconveniences, plants, animals, and men multiply 
and thrive exceedingly. From fome undrained marfhy grounds, 
. from fome low lying fpots which long retain the waters in a 
ftagnated ftate, the air is often moift, foggy, and feemingly un- 
wholefome, though not fo much fo as one would conclude, 
the inhabitants living as long, and enjoying as much health 
as in other places ; except that there is one difeafe very pre- 
valent, namely the ague, the caufes of which feem to be the 
miry nature of the ground, the fogginefs of the air, the mifer- 
able huts the common people till of late lived in, a defect in 
cleanlinefs, and the fcanty portion of animal food which falls 
to their fhare. The virulence of this difeafe, however, feems 
to be a good deal abated, owing to the univerfal inclofing of 
the grounds, draining off the moifture, a very confpicuous im- 
provement in the houfes, perfonal cleanlinefs, and a great al- 
teration for the better in diet. But this difeafe fome years re- 
turns with fuch unexpected frequency and force, as often baf- 
fles all fpeculations concerning it. 

The only ftream of any note in the parifh is Leet, which a- 
bounds with pike *." 

Minerals^ tsfc — There is great plenty of free ftone, particu- 
larly one excellent ftone quarry is wrought in the farm of Swin- 
ton quarter, on which the family of Swinton retained a fervi- 

tude 

* A regular fofs «an be ftill traced in the church yard round the church,

that to this quarry the parifh owes a fet of ingenious operative 
mafons, highly regarded in their line, cadets perhaps from 
the Swinton family, and prior to the additional fyllable which 
has long ago both lengthened and foftened the name. Except 
ordinary whin-ftone and freeftone, no other minerals are to be 
found here. All the coals come from Northumberland, at 8 
miles diftance at leaft from Swinton.

The prefent incumbent had occafion fome dozen of years a- 
go to take an accurate lift of the inhabitants upon a rumour of 
a Scottifh militia, and finds they are now more numerous by 
98. The increafe is to be afxribed entirely to Lord Swinton's 
judicious attention to improve and enlarge his village of Swin- 
ton, partly by perpetual feus, and partly by leafes of 999 years, 
which laft mode gave great offence, and made fome of the te- 
nants afk what was to become of their houfelefs pofterity at the 
end of that period. The real increafe lies upon this village, as 
the other parts of the parifli rather muft decreafe, for thefe rea- 
fons ; univerfal inclofing has in a great meafure fuperfeded 
hands , two horfe-ploughs, where the fame man holds and 
drives, have made fewer boys neceffary ; and farms becoming 
larger, and grazing prevailing more, fewer hands are requir- 
ed to cultivate them. Swinton has increafed rapidly. About 
30 years ago there were not ico perfons in it ; whereas it now 
contains 351 fouls; and it -is inconceivable how many of the 
neceflaries of houfe-keeping, and how many conveniencies can 
be now found here, which 25 years ago the inhabitants had 
to fend many miles for *, 

Nothing 

* It is almoft impoffible that any perfon in this place fhould die for want of 
the neceflaries of life. Againft lb dreadful a difafter the fecurities are a fertile 
foil, a very regular poor's rate, a humane people, both gentry and others be- 
ing ready to contribute liberally where any extraordinary cafe claims their at- 
tention;

Nothing that can be called emigration has happened here 
for many years; fome boys, girls, men and women are at the 
hiring markets in the neighbourhood, engaged to ferve out of, 
or in the parim. In this way many in form of hynds, cotters, 
cot-men, &amp;c. flit in hopes of better ufage, often from whim 
or caprice ; and every Whitfunday exhibits them removing or 
returning with their whole furniture and apparatus in a cart 
or two. But fuch changes imply no fettled difcontent, arifing 
often merely from levity and a love of change, either in them 
or their mafters. No doubt feveral have accepted tempting 
offers of employment in other parifhes or in other counties, 
but they are generally fuch as the farmers would have been 
fondeft of employing at home. 

There are no uninhabited houfes. The number of houfes 
is 180, and the average number of perfons to a houfe is almoft 
exactly 5. 

Natural Productions, Advantages and Difadvantages. — This 
parim produces in great abundance all the vegetables and 
and plants known in the fouth of Scotland, along with fuch 
trees as are encouraged and taken care of ; and does a great 
deal more than fupply itfelf with all forts of grain ; exporting 
a confiderable quantity of corn by means of the merchants at 
Berwick and Eymouth — The feafons of fowing and reaping 
vary greatly, yet the eligible time of fowing wheat is from 
the 20th of September to the 20th of October, fpring wheat 
is fown any time in March. — The belt feafon for field peafe or 
beans is from the laft week of February to the laft week of 

March.

abufed or withheld. In 1782, a trifling attention, firfl to the penfioned poor, 
and fecondly to fuch as were in temporary (traits, removed all complaints with-

March. Cold feed oats are fown as early in March as the 
ground and weather will admit ; but hot feed oats may be fown 
three weeks later ; barley from the middle of April till the 8th 
or ioth day of May. The harveft is reckoned early, when it 
begins before the 20th of Auguft.— The advantages which 
this parifh enjoys are a very fertile and productive foil;— the 
neighbourhood of the Tweed, and furnifhing, by its carters, 
fuch as lie to the north and weft with coals and lime, by 
their hired carts and horfes ; a centrical fituation with regard 
to the market towns of Berwick, Kelfo, Dunfe and Cold- 
ftream. — The difadvantages are, a ticklifh foil, eafily hurt ei- 
ther by drought or rain, tho' no fpot is more fertile when the 
feafon exaftly fuitsit; molt impracticable roads, which no 
fkill nor attention hitherto has made effectually good ; the hav- 
ing no fuel but coals from Northumberland brought acrofs 
the Tweed at a ford precarious, and often fatal by the rafhnefs 
of the men and the fudden rife of the river : every feafon 
fome horfes are loft in it ; no peat, no fuel, no timber, except 
the fcanty and uncertain fupply of thorn-hedges cut and fold •, 
and the total want of manufactures. 

Rent, Changes of Property, Agriculture.. The valued rent 

of the parifh is L. 4750 Scots : The real rent is about L. 4030 
fterling; the number of Englifh acres (exclufive of 14 acres of 
glebes) is 5120 or thereabouts, which is nearly 16s. an acre at 
an average ; the higheft rent yet known is 25s. per acre for a 
fow acres, the farm of Swinton quarter gives 23s. per acre, 
and the loweft rent here is 8s. There is all the certainty fuch 
fubjects admit of that this rent, inftead of finking, will rife 
confiderably. 

It has already been mentioned, that the founder of the Swin- 
ton family got th«f lands of Swinton as a reward for his valour 
in clearing the earth of thofe deftrudlive animals, wild boars. 

2 The 



of Swinton and' Simprin. 329 

'The family afterwards became ftill more confpicuous, by affift- 
ing Malcolm Canmore to recover the throne of his anceftors ; 
and that fovereign confirmed to them the property of the whole 
parifh of Swinton, by one of the firft charters granted in Scot- 
land, ftill preferved. in the archives of Durham. During the 
commonwealth, the then reprefentative of the Swinton fami- 
ly having efpoufed the caufe of Cromwell, the eftate was for- 
feited at the reftoration of Charles II. but it was given back at 
the Revolution. However, a long exile, while their revenues 
were fequeflrated, had fo involved the family that it became ne- 
ceflary to fell the three farms of Mont Suir, to the Kerrs of 
Morrifton, who ftill poffefs them. And fome years afterwards, 
the father of the prefent Lord Swinton fold three farms for 
L. 5500 to Provoft Coutts, whofe heirs fold them about 1754 
for L. 6500 to William Hall of Whitehall, who, after many 
meliorations at a great expence, fold them to Patrick Lord 
Elibank for more than double of his purchafe money. How- 
ever, after all thefe alienations, the Swinton eftate is ftill a 
noble and extenfive property. The whole paiifh of Simprin 
was long the property of the antient family of Cockburn of 
Langton, but their affairs falling into diforder, the eftate was 
fequeftrated, and purchafed, about 1758, by Patrick Lord 
Elibank, for L. 18,000. — The moft confpicuous object in Sim- 
prin is the very high and fpacious barn built by the Cockburns, 
confifting'ofathreftiing floor and large and lofty granaries. Lord 
Elibank thinking its height expofed it to ftorms, lowered the 
roof confiderably, but left the gabels ftanding, fo that they 
ftill (hew the original altitude of the building, which is fecn 
from almoft every part of Berwickshire. Thefe are, exclufive of 
the grafs parks of Swinton and other pallure grounds extend- 
ing to 7 10 acres, about fourteen farms in the parifh; and each farm- 
er occupies 320 acres at an average. One farm of 414 acres 
is let at 23s. another of 400 acres at 14s. a third of 477 acres

at 15s. a fourth of 370 acres at 1 8s. and a fifth of about 300 
acres at 12s. per acre — The farmers are allowed by their lea- 
fes to plough half of their farms annually, the other half being 
occupied by pafture or fown grafs. The former is ufually di- 
vided into five portions, one in fallow, one in wheat, one in 
peafe or fome other green crop, one in barley, and one in oats. 
Were this practice ftri£tly followed, a tenth part of each farm 
would be in wheat ; but as in fome farms and in fome feafons 
this will not do, it will be nearer the truth to compute a twelfth 
of each farm, according to which eftimation there will be an- 
nually 366 acres fown with wheat in the parifh. About 228 
bolls will be required to fow them, and the produce, reckon- 
ing 8 bolls after one, will be 1 824 bolls of wheat ; which at 30s. 
per boll will give L. 2736. From the above data it will be ea- 
fy to compute the quantity and value of the other productions 
of the parifh. The farmers are prevented from fowing turnips 
to any extent by the impracticability of pulverizing their ftrong 
ground to the finenefs this feed requires, and the difficulty of 
getting the roots offwithout leaving dangerous impreffions up- 
on the foil. To remove them by horfes or carts is very 
hurtful ; and when fheep are folded on them, the holes made 
by their feet render the ground unfavourable for bearing the 
fucceeding crop of barley. The farmers therefore prefer taking 
fields of turnips in the neighbouring parifhes, at from L. 2 : 10s. 
to L. 5. per acre. It was formerly cuftomary to fow grafs feeds 
among barley after the ground had carried feveral crops fince 
it was fallowed and limed •, but the farmers now begin to fow 
grafs feeds among the young wheat in fpring, and this method 
is thought to fucceed much better than the former. 

Betwixt the two longitudinal elevations or ridges of Swin- 
ton quarter and Greenrig lies a flat low piece of ground of a ve- 
ry confiderable breadth, often overflowed by the fwellings of the 
Leet, which great pains have been taken to drain, and which

is moft productive of grafs, and even fometimes of corn in a 
very dry fummer. If the large and expenfive canal, made by 
William Hall, Efq; to fecure a fpaciousbed for the Leet while 
palling through his grounds, were continued weftvvard through 
Lord Swincon's lands to Swinton mill, it would Contribute much 
to the fertility of the foil and the health of the inhabitants *. 

Ecclefiaft'ical State. — The Crown is patron of this unitedparifh. 
The ftipend confifts of 100 bolls of oats, Linlithgow meafure, 
106 bolls of barley; L. 12:12:8 vicarage teinds, all which, 
exclufwe of houfe and garden, and including the 2 glebes, a- 
long with fervitudes of 2 horfes and 2 cows, may amount to 
L. 1 36 fterling, per annum f . 

The manfe was built in 177 r. At the annexation it was on 
good grounds believed, that the old church of Swinton would 
hold all the inhabitants of both parifhes ; but the village of 
Swinton increafing very rapidly, the new comers ^elt them- 
felves crowded, and therefore applied for an enlargement of 
the church. They alked the confent of the heritors to build an 
aile for themfelves, the feats to defcend with their houfes and

* The family of Swinton by their extreme antiquity confHtutes the great-. 
eft curiofity of the parifh. Sir Ifaac Newton in his Chronology calculates, that 
in no feries of Kings the average duration of each of their reigns exceeds z t 
years; now it would appear that z% barons, includingthe prefent proprietor, have 
occupied the lands of Swinton during the long period of 731 years, which fuppo- 
fes that in a moft turbulent ariftocracy, amidft feudal broils and foreign wars, 
a feries of border chieftains enjoyed their eftates at an average each more than 
33 years. 

t J 6 bolls of the virtual ftipend are paid out of Paxtonin the parHh of 
Hutton ; a chalder of barley is paid out of the lands of Eymouth ; and L. 26 : 
5s of vicarage out of the lands of Horndean in the parifh of Lady-kirk. Thefe 
irregularities probably arofe from the dependance of this parifh on the abbacy 
of Coldinghajn ; the abbot drawing the beft vidhial out of this diftrift, and 
paying his dependent clergy from places where the grain was worfe ia quality,

gardens to their heirs, and to be infe parable from their poflef- 

fiom This the heritors mod readily granted, and 28 of 

thefe zealous heads of families, at their own expenee, and in a 
great meafure by their own hands, did in 1782, add a very 
handfome aile to the north fide of the church, which was built ia 
1 729. The old fabric was taken down on account of an apprehen- 
fion that it was in a ruinous and dangerous Mate ; whereas on 
fetting about pulling it down it appeared to be uncommonly 
ftrong, and might have flood for ages. In the middle of the 
church below ground is a vault very neatly built of hewn ftone, 
extending a confiderable length, long the burying place of 
the family of Swinton ; but being generally full of water, it 
is now no longer ufed for that purpofe *. 

Mifcellatmtts Remark Many changes have indeed hap- 

pened in the village and in the parifh fince the year 1754. At 
that time # Swinton confided of a few miferable huts not con- 
taining 100 perfons, and Simprin contained the whole inhabi- 
tants of that parifh. By a divifion into three farms, the parifh. 
has increafed in numbers, though the village of Simprin has 
declined a little ; but Swinton now confifts of one fpacious 

fquare, 

* A ftone figure of Allan Swinton, the 5th Baron of that family lies in an 
arched open niche on the fouth wall on the right hand of the pulpit, with this 
infeription, Hie jacet Alanus Sivintonus miles de eodetn. In his folded hands, which 
reft upon his breaft, he grafps a round awkward ftone, and above him are very- 
ill fhaped figures of pigs and of a brood fow. No date can be difcovered ; but 
it is well known that he died about the year 1200. The ftone he grafps in his 
hand is by immemorial tradition faid to allude to a large clew of yarn, by the 
dexterous ufe of which in one hand, while he ufed his iword with the other 
he difpatched a great wild boar in that field in Swintonhill which, from that 
event, ftill retains the name of Allan's Cairn ; fo it would appear that this 
gentleman engaged in the fame manly fports, the fame dangerous exercifes, 
and was emulous of the original fame of his family, long before his time 
become great and confpicuous.

by its fituation considerably above the level of 3 public roads,

has its clock, and not a few of the owners have watches be- 
fides ; a confiderable quantity of loaf bread is brought from 
Edinburgh, but efpecially from Berwick, Dunfe, Coldftream, 
end Norham. No regular butcher market is held here •, but 
many black cattle, fwine, and iheep are killed occafionally, 
and fold to the villagers from the adjacent farms, efpecially in 
the week of the facrament, the two weeks of the fairs, and 
about Martinmafs. The price of poultry begins to rife by the 
new inftitution of an Edinburgh carrier, though ftill it is 
not unreafonable *. 

About 1754, three farms in this parifli were occupied by 
Northumbrian ftewards of Northumbrian farmers; on the 
other farms lived a fet of plain unpolifhed farmers, fcarcely dif- 
tinguifhable from their hynds, either in drefs, information, 
or mode of living. Now a moft comfortable change for the 
better has taken place. Of the prefent farmers feme no doubt 
ftill exhibit that fort formerly known by the appellation of 
gude men, the toiling and ftruggling cultivators of fmall farms ; 
but a fecond fort occupy large territories, early and intimately 
acquainted with the theor ; , the practice, and the commerce

circumftances, independent either of lairds or faftors ; they 
live in a neat, handfome, and hofpitable manner, and give 
their children a very extenfive education. — Some of them 
have had a liberal education. They employ in farming the 
confiderable funds acquired by their fathers in the fame line 
of life ; (till retaining however their laudable literary curiofity 
and tafte for the belles lettres. So that while this diftrict 
yeilds to many of the neighbouring parifhes in the fize, neatnefs, 
and conveniencies of farm houfes, in the eafy circumftances 
and even opulence, in the intellectual attainments, the focial, 
and hofpitable manners of the farmers, it has no occafion to 
envy any parifh whatever. Even the hynds and cotters derive 
fome improvement from living near fuch fuperiors j for be- 
holding in them the advantages of neatnefs, of cleanlinefs, 
and knowledge, they ftrive as much as their circumfcribed 
fphere will admit to imitate them, giving their children as 
much reading, writing, and figures, as they can fpare time 
for, along with a little dancing. Thefe hynds and cotters feem 
to live fnug, happy, and contented, except when ficknefs 
or want of ceconomy diftrefs them. 

The poor are maintained by a poor's rate laid on by the he- 
ritors, as truftees for the poor, along with the minifter of the 
parifh, on whom no fmall (hare of the trouble falls. During the 
life of the late Lord Embank, merely to gratify a whim of his 
Lordfhip, the poor's rates of the two parifhes were kept fe- 
parate ; but they have been (ince thrown together, after an in- 
effectual oppofition from the Simprin tenants, who appre- 
hended that the growing fize of Swinton would aggravate their 
expences on this fcore. — Thefe rates have always been the 
chief fuppoft of the poor, the collections at the church doors 
being very fcanty indeed. The number of poor at prefent, is

parifh are humane, clever, and ingenious, and feem to have 
the advantage of the Northumbrians on one fide of them, and 
of the Eaft Lothianers on the other. The incumbent, after 
a very long refidence among them, cannot find any truth in 
the obfervation of an ingenious, learned, and witty Lord, 
who faid that the natives of the Merfe were engendered in 
mud, brought up in mud, and that their ideas were all 
muddy. 

Inclofing they have been long reconciled to, and it has for 
fome time been univerfal ; the commutation of the ftatute la- 
bour into money they fubmit to with a tolerable grace. 

Turnpikes and toll-bars, with which they are now threatened,

^^HE name is derived from fome remarkable thorn trees. 
-*- The prefent incumbent remembers a very large one in the 
parifh. The length of this diftrift, from S. to N. is about 4 
miles, and the breadth from E. to W. about as much *. The 
meafurement is about 1900 acres. It is moftly low ground 
with a moderate defcent to the S. except a rifing in the north 
part of the parifh, the north fide of which falls to the N. 
The foil in fome parts is remarkably good, a fmall part of the: 
north end, however, is very poor muir ground upon a deep 
clay. The air is good and healthy. 

Rent. —The real rent of the parifh is about L. 2040. The 
inclofures are among the very beft in Scotland for keeping cows 

or 



* From Armftrong's map of Bervvickfhire, it appears the length of this pa- 
rifh is only »J miles and the breadth little more than 1

or feeding cattle or fheep, and producing milk and fine but- 
ter. A cow's grafs cannot be got in thefe inclofures under 
L. 3 ; and they are let at more than L. 2 per acre for fummer 
pafture. There are 4 heritors, one of whom refides. 

Population.— The relation to Dr Webfter in 1755 was 497 
fouls ; the prefent number of inhabitants is between 300 
and 400 ; the diminution being owing to the fetting large farms, 
and cafting down two villages. For 4 years preceding 1792, 
the births were 44, the deaths 1 3, and the marriages 9. There 
are 8 farmers, 2 fmiths, 4 wrights, 2 weavers, and 3 mafons 
in the parifh. 

Stipend, and Poor. — The ftipend is L. 600 Scotch, 2 chal- 
ders of barley, and 2 of oat meal, with a glebe of 6 acres. 
The King is patron. The number of poor on the roll is 6, 
and the amount of the affeffment for their fupport for the firft 
half year of 1792, is L. 12 : 12. 

Mijcellaneous Remarks. — The ftone in the parifh is generally 
blue whin ftone, with one quarry of red free ftone ; on the 
fide of the water of Eden are two rocks commonly called the 
Meikle and Little Thairn. — There is one lake called Lurgie 
Loch. — Dotterels appear in a little flock on the muirs for a few 
weeks in June. — .Both clay and (hell marie are ufed here for 
manure. — Coal is the common fuel, brought from England, 
and from Lothian. The price is about is. per Cwt. — There 
are in the north part of the parifh 2 or 3 ftones with large 
feams, which it is faid Mr Pocock when palling that way 
thought to have been cemented together : but they have been 
carried from the Lurgie craig, where are plenty of fuch ftones. 
"When broken, they do not break at the feams. They have 
been dug up, but nothing was found under them.

npiIE town, from which the parifh takes its name, is cal- 
led Auchtermuchty ; which, as thofe who are acquain- 
cd with the Gaelic language fay, fignifies, ' the cott3ge of 
* the king.' — If fo, it is more than probable, that thistown had 
been originally intended for the accommodation of the king's 
fcrvants, during his refidence at Falkland. The parifh is 2 
miles in length, and if mile in breadth. 

The general appearance of the country in this parifh is ex- 
tremely various. Towards the S. the ground is fo low and flat 
that were it not for drains, a great part would be covered with 
water after heavy rains. — Towards the N. and N. W. the coun- 
try affumes a hilly appearance. There nature is feen in its 
wildeft forms, and thofe fond of romantic fcenes are much 
gratified by contemplating " the goodly profpecl: of hills and 
" dales that fpread around." But though mountainous, and 
covered with heath in general, it is not altogether barren or 

ufelefs.

ufelefs. Some fpots have been cultivated within thefe few 
years ; and there is a large plantation of firs, interfperfed with 
fome larix, in a very flourifhing ftate, the property of Mr Gour- 
lay of Kilmarron, a gentlemen well known in this country, not 
only foi his enterprifing fpirit, but alfo for his judicious and ex- 
tenfive improvements. 

Soil, Climate, farY.— Around the town the ground is rather 
light, loofe, and black, fomewhat gravelly and ftony. To- 
wards the S. and S. E. there is a mixture of black clay, loam 
and mellow earth, fo exceedingly fertile, that there is perhaps 
not a richer fpot in Scotland. Some inclofures lying towards 
the N. W. of the parifh have been particularly remarked for 
the produdion of excellent pafture, Angularly calculated for 
feeding cattle, and confequently have rented very high to gra- 
ziers for fome years paft *. 

There is plenty of free Hones and other forts commonly ufed 
in building.— There are four remarkable echoes in the pa- 
rim f.

• The air is good and healthy. Confumptions are the rftoft prevalent dis- 
temper, particularly among young women, which perhaps may be attributed 
to their (laying at home, fpinning at two-handed wheels, and not enjoying that 
comfortable diet, and moderate exercife, the refult of being in fervice. 

f The migratory birds are the wild goofe, the lap-wing and the fieldfare. — 
The wild geefe make their appearance about the firft of November, and leave 
this place about the firft of April. The lap-wing is as it were the harbinger 
of fpring. — When that is early, they appear in February, but if the weather 
is fevcre, they come not till March ; they go for England or Ireland about the 
end of September. They are rmich diminifhed in number* within thefe few 
years, becaufe the gentlemen in this neighbourhood are now draining their 
mofles and cultivating their muir grounds, the ufual haunts of this beautiful 
though gloomy bird. The fieldfare comes from the northern countries in 
the month of December ; but when the winter is mild it makes a very fhort ftay. 



34° Statyiical Account 

Cattle.— Much attention is paid to the breed of cattle ; a 
great many are reared of good fize and great value. Of late 
the cattle dealers from England have been in the habit of pur- 
chafing them privately, which has injured the markets confi- 
derably. They give from L. 6 to L. 1 2. before they are fatten- 
ed ; and calves new dropt, which could have been purchafed 
a few years ago at 4s. to 5s. laft feafon gave from 10s. to 12s. 
It is fo far well for the country, that there is fuch a demand ; 
for, confidering the advanced price of labour, and the high 
rents given for land, if either the cattle or grain were to di- 
minifh much in value," none of thofe tenants who have sot 
new tacks could poffibly pay their rents ; a circumftance to 
which gentlemen of landed property would do well to attend, 
if they regard their own interefl, and the comfort of fuch a 
refpe&amp;able and ufeful body of men. 

Population.— On account of the different fectarifts in this 
parilh, which will be afterwards more particularly taken notice 
of, it is difficult to afcertain with precifion the increafe of po- 
pulation ; as thefe fe£tarifts feldom regifter the births of their 
children in the books appropriated for that purpofe ; but it is 
the opinion of fome aged inhabitants, whofe veracity may be 
depended upon, that die number of the inhabitants and houfes 
within, the town, has encreafed at lead one half within thefe 
60 years.

* It is to be regretted that little attention is paid to the regiftration of mar- 
riages and deaths, as this negled not only injures the feffion clerks, but the 
revenue itfelf. The tax indeed is very unpopular ; and the act of Parliament 
which impofes it ought either immediately to be enforced or repealed. 

f The divifions in this parifh commenced foon after the depofition of Mr 
Gillefpic. Thefe furely are among the greateft judgements which can bcfal any 
Place. They are a judgement temporally, as they take away the fubftancc 
of families to fupport minifters, and thus often prevent the juft claims of o- 
thers being paid. They are a judgement fpiritually, as they extingui/h that 
fpirit of love and charity, the diftinguiniing charafteriftics of our holy religion. 
At the fame time, thejparilh minifter lives on very good terms with their cler- 
gy, who feem to be well difpofed men, and he defires to love all who are lov- 

crs

Inftead of any leaving the parifli for want of employment, or 
there being any uninhabited houfes, a demand for both daily 
encreafes, although upwards of 40 new houfes have been built 
within thefe few years. 

Natural Produftions. — Comparing the fertility of the land in 
this parifh to what it was in former times, a very remarkable 
difference will be found ; there is no reafon to doubt but that 
one fifth more of provifion is annually produced, than what 
was raifed in the fame time, on the memory of many yet alive. 
To account for this, recourfe muft be had to the hiflory of fo- 
ciety in its progrefs from a rude to a civilized ftate. It is ac- 
knowledged by all, that when mankind were in an uncultivated 
ftate, every individual provided for himfelf all the neceflaries 
of life ; but as the manners of the human fpecies improved, 
the arts were divided among different hands, and individuals, 
with the fruit of their refpettive employments, purchafed from 
the manufacturers of other commodities whatever they Itood 
in need of. Thus every thing was not only procured at 
a much eafier rate, but finiflied in much greater perfection. 
It was but lately that Scotland, efpecially this part, and places 
adjoining to populous towns and villages, arrived at a proper 
knowledge of agriculture. The learned Dr. Anderfon's trea- 
tife, and others on this fubject, begin now to be read with ad- 
vantage by farmers ; and confequently the modern fyftem of 
hufbandry is generally adopted. The minifter too, who farms 
about twenty acres, flatters himfelf that he has been of fome 



«s of the truth, though they may differ in leffer matters. It is well for th« 
minifters of the eftablilhed church, that their fubfiftence docs not depend on 
the caprice of the people, as the relievers here lately turned off an inoffenfive old 
man w ho had preached to them upwards of twenty years ; and who muft have 
fuffcred in the evening of life, had not their injuftice been compenfated by the 
benevolence of a fon.

ufe to his parifh in this refpeft 5 as within thefe three years 
he has raifed turnips, potatoes, wheat, arid barley on a fpot 
where they were never before feen in the memory of man. 
The crop on that ground this feafon is furpafied by none in 
the country. There are in the parifh only one fmall flock of 
fheep, about 160 horfes, and 230 cows, in general of a good 
breed. The parifh contains upwards of 3000 acres, 90 of which 
are generally appropiiated to the railing of flax. Although 
the crop this feafon promifes well, yet for thefe fome years pad 
it has been very indifferent, which makes it the more to be re* 
gretted that the Honourable Board of Truftees (hould have 
curtailed the bounty on that article. There are about 70 acres 
in turnips and cabbage, 150 in wheat, 200 imfown grafs, and 
160 in pafture ; the remainder is occupied in raifing oats, 
barley and potatoes. All the wafte grounds, to the extent of 
between 6 or 700 acres, are planted with fir. In general 
beans and peafe are fown in the end of March, oats in April 
and barley in the beginning of May. Confidering the back- 
wardnefs of the feafons of late, fowing ought to commence 
more early ; yet fome of the old farmers ftill delay it, alledg- 
ing, that they did not begin laft year till fuch a week, or fuch 
a day ; as if providence always limited the feafon to a week or 
a day. The wheat which is fown in the months of September 
and October, is generally cut down along with the barley in 
the months of Auguft and September following. 

There is marie, but no other kinds of minerals have yet been 
difcovered. The gardens produce every neceflary vegetable and 
root, together with all kinds of common fruits. A fmall ri- 
vulet flows direftly through the town and falls into the river 
Eden, a little below the village of Danefhalt, which terminates, 
the fouthern part of the parifh. 

Manuf attar os.— Auchtermuchty is well calculated for 
3 manufactories,,

manufactories, being fituated in a healthy fertile country. — A 
gentleman from Glafgow propofes to eftablifh a tambour branch 
immediately, which muft contribute to the profperity of the 
town, as thereby a number of children, who at prefent can 
"be of no fervice either to themfelves or their parents, will find 
employment. It muft alfo be an eligible fituation for an 
woolen branch, confidering its vicinity to the Lomond hills, 
and the frequent opportunities of conveying wool from the 
Ochils. Such is the fpirit of induftry and enterprize, which 
now actuates the inhabitants, that a manufactory of that fort 
could not fail to fucceed. From the books of the ftamp-maf- 
ter of Auchtermuchty, it appears that, from ift November 
1790 to I ft November 17 91, he ftamped 

239,244^ yards of 35 inch wide brown li- 
nen, valued at 9^d. per yard L. 9470 1 8f 

260,093 yards of 30 and 27 inch wide brown

2,2 12^ yards of white linen, at 8d. 73 1 5 2 

Total L. 18,213 12 8f 

Great part pf the above muft be manufaaured in the town, 
and the immediate neighbourhood, as there are ftamp offices 
in Falkland and Newburgh, which are within two and three 
miles of Auchtermuchty. An ordinary journeyman weaver 
will work 9 fpindles in a week, at is. per fpindle/but others who 
are more expert at their bufinefs, will weave 17 fpindles 
at the fame rate. L. 50,000 fterling is annually expended by 
green linen merchants in this town for that article *.

Rcckfiafical State, Town, &amp;c. Auchtermuchty was confti- 
tuted a royal burgh by James the IV. which charter Was re- 
newed by James the VI. It enjoys all the privileges of a roy- 
al burgh, but that of fending a reprefentative to parliament. 
It has 3 bailies chofen annually at Michaelmafs, 15 councillors, 
(one of them treafurer) and a clerk. The annual income of 
the town's property is L. 106 :14:6, which arifes from the 
cuftom of fairs, rent of the mills, &amp;c. How that money is dif- 
pofed of is beft known to thofe to whom the management of 
it is intruded. By the charter there was a market appointed 
to be held every Tuefday, which it is to be regretted is now 
done away. There are four confiderable fairs in the year, the 
one held on the 13th of July, by the fame charter, 1 was to 
continue 8 days. It is now one of the moft confiderable in 
Fife, for the fale of black cattle, horfes, fheep, wool, &amp;c. 

The church was built in 1780. The patronage belongs to 
Moncrieff of Reedy, an antient and refpeftable family, who 
received fome fignal tokens of favour from one of the Scottifh 
kings, when refiding at Falkland. The ftipend is 3 chalders 
of barley, 3 chalders of oats, and L. 36 : 13 : 4. fterling. The 
glebe is now let at L. 19. Sterling. — There are 65 heritors, of 
whom 57 refide in the parifh. A new manfe is juft now fi- 
nifhed, and much to the honour of the heritors is inferior to 
none in the country ; the church too is well finifhed, and fu- 
perior to the generality in the neighbourhood. There is a 
flour mill, a corn mill, and 2 lint mills. Within thefe few 
years there was a cotton work ; but one of the partners dying 
before it had well commenced, it is converted into a mill for

drefling flax. The price of beef and mutton is generally 
about 4d. and 4* d per lib. 

, Mifcellaneous Olfervations.—The chief difadvantages confift 
in being at a diftance from coal, there being none nearer than 
Balbirnie and Balgony, 6 miles off; but were the proprietors 
of thefe mines to ereft a coal yard here, they would find their 
account in fo doing. Another is, the want of a proper fchool- 
mafter and fchool-houfe ; and without an augmentation of fa- 
Iary, which at prefent is only L. 5 : 1 is. it can never be ex- 
petted that a man of merit will devote his time and talents for 
fuch a trifle. It is worthy of remark that the youth in this 
place have been, and now are, ruined with bad fchoolmafters ; 
and to this may be attributed in a great degree the narrow and 
uncharitable difpofitions of the inhabitants, and that bigotry 
and party fpirit which manifefts itfelf in all the adieus of 
thofe who are given to divifive courfes. — The rent of tradef- 
men's houfes is from 20s. to 50s. The valued rent of the pa- 
rifli is L. 5782 Scots, and the land- rent of L. 4000 fterling. 
The lands immediately around the town let from L. 2 : to 
L. 3 : jos. per acre, though it muft be acknowledged that thofe 
who pay fuch rents have other means of fubfifting themfelves 
and families than from the produce *. 

The 

* Several places take their names from fome remarkable circumfrances, 
which had happened at or near them. Daneflialt is fuppofed to fignify the 
Jhelter of the Danes, as it is faid that formerly the Danes having made an inva- 
fion into the country, were repulfed in Falkland muir, fled, and concealed 
themfelves in the lower part Of the parifh of Auchtermuchty. Daneflialt is 
half a mile diftant from Auchtermuchty ; and the road to Falkland, Kirkaldy, 
and Kinghorn lies directly through this village, which is the property of E- 
benezer Marfhall, Efq. of Hill Cairny, who is doing every tiling to encreafe 
the number of its inhabitants, by feuing out ground for building, &amp;c. The 
great M'Duff is fuppofed to have lived once in Auchtermuchty, in a houfe 

no t 



of Auchtermuchty. 347 

The roads and bridges are getting into high'Tepair ; and the 
advantage of the turnpikes which are now eftablifhed in this 
county, will foon be felt by all ranks, though at prefent, the 
common people do not relifh them, as they deem the ftatute- 
labour a great hardfhip. It is in contemplation to repair the 
road from Perth to Kinghorn, through Auchtermuchty-hill, 
which will add to the profperity of the town ; for travellers will 
naturally come this way, inftead of going by the Ferry, as it 
will fave. them twenty miles journeying. The poft ought alfo 
to come this way, and the poft- office for this diftria to be efta- 
blifhed here, rather than at Falkland ; as this is not only a more 
centrical place, and more bufinefs carried on, but it is alfo in a 
direct Tine from Kinrofs to Cupar, and St. Andrews. 

The inhabitants of this parifh, with a few exceptions, are 
very induftrious, and rather economical than otherwife ; in fo 
much that there are only 6 on the poor's lift. There is here a 
fociety diftinguiftied by their focial habits, their hofpitality, 
and their benevolence to the poor. Upon the whole, if Sir 
John Sinclair wifhes that his patriotic exertions mould be effec- 
tually crowned with fuccefs, and the condition of the country 
meliorated, he muft devil'e fome means of increafmg the fa- 
laries of country fchoolmafters •, fo that men of merit may 
be induced to take upon them that important charge, the 
education of youth ; for as the poet fays.

Rofie-brae, and runs in a direct line to Falkland. In ploughing the lands 
where it lies, the plough is frequently obftrucled b} large (tones ; and what 
makes it more remarkable is, that thefe lands about 50 years ago were over* 
flown with water.

<p>
Name, Extent, and Stipend. 

r^vRDIQUHILL is of Gaelic original, and fignifies, the 
^ " hollow befide the height." The Earl of Findlater 
is patron ; and, though he has not a foot of ground in the pa- 
rilh, pays moll of the ftipt nd. The pariah is of an oblong 
form, being near 4 miles in length, from N. to S. and about 
3 in breadth. It was formerly a chapelry in the parifh of For- 
dyce, where public worfhip was performed once a month ; and 
feems to have been erected into a feparate parifh, about the year 
1622. The church, which was built about the fame time, on the 
fpot where then flood St. Mary's chapel, is, at prefent, in bad 
repair; asisalfothemanceandofficehoufes. The ftipend, includ- 
ing the glebe, which here is not worth much, is about L. 70 

fterling yearly Previous to the augmentation, which took 

place in 1:66, it was one of the fmalleft ftipends in Scotland, 
being in all not above L. 30 fterling per annum. — The fchool-

mailer's ialary is 8 bolls of meal, L. i : 5 as feffion clerk ; and. 
the profits arifing from baptifms and marriages, and from abtfut 
40 fcholars. 

Names of Places, Mineral Springs, &amp;c— The names of pla- 
ces in this parifh feem moftly of Gaelic original. There 

arg feveral excellent mineral wells in the parifh; which were 
formerly much frequented. They are of a medicinal quality, 
and are known to be ufeful in many complaints, particularly 
thofe of a fcorbutic nature. One of them, being dedicated to 
the Virgin Mary, was formerly at certain feafons muchrefort- 
ed to by the fuperftitions as well as the fick. The air here is 
falubrious, and the people healthy, hofpitable and induftrious. 
— The face the country is wildly beautiful, and correfponds ex- 
actly with the fignification of the name given to it. 

• Produce and Rent. — About two thirds of the parifh are arable ; 
the other is ftill in a ftate of nature, and partly covered with 
heath. The foil is, in general, deep •, but cold and wet at the 
bottom. A considerable quantity of lint, turnips and potatoes 
are raifed here ; but hemp, cabbages, and the like, however, 
are ftldom produced in the fields. Though there are 3 or 4 
farms of about loo acres arable, befides a considerable -extent 
of pasture, the higheft rent, every thing included, does not 
exceed L 40 sterling yearly. The valued rent of the parifh is 
L. 1700 Scots; the real rent at prefcnt, including fervitudes, 
amounts to about L. 700 sterling. 

Proprietor and Improvements. — Sir Ernest Gordon of Park, 
who generally resides in the parifh, is fole proprietor ; and his 
houfe, which is lately fitted up in the modern tafte, is com- 
modious and elegant ; and furrounded by a number of vener- 
able afh, and other trees, in a thriving way. He is fpread-

ing improvements rapidly around him ; and there is now a 
probability, that agriculture will advance apace ; though, in 
this part of the country, it muft be confeffed fhe is but in her 
infancy. There is mofs enough here for generations to come, 
and ftones fufficient for the purpofe of inclofing ; and, though 
the parifh cannot boaft of woods, and groves, of forefts, and 
water-falls, yet it can be faid that it has winding rills, and pur- 
ling ftreams, in abundance ; and that there is fcarcely a farm, or 
cot-houfe, in this diftrict, but has fome fpreading trees to 
fcreen and adorn it. A{h and other hard woods thrive tolera- 
blywell; however, the foil, in general, feems better adapted 
for aller and other aquatics •, and there is the pleafmg profpec"!, 
that the oaklings, and various feedlings, that have lately been 
planted, will give an agreeable variety to tins part of the coun- 
try, and prove a lading fource of wealth and amufementto the 
induftrious proprietor. 

Hills. — The Knock hill, part of which belongs to this parifh, 
is about 2500 feet above,the level of the fea ; and, as its tower- 
ing head in feen from afar, it becomes an excellent landmark 
to thofe who trade in the Murray Firth. It is fituatfcd, as it 
were, in a large capacious plain ; and, while it produces a varie- 
tyof excellent game for the amufement and health of the fportf- 
man, and fuggefts to the contemplative mind an idea of the 
grand, the fublime, and the beautiful, it affords a delicious 
repaft for the flocks and herds of thofe that live near. The pa= 
rifhes of Grange, Fordyce, and Ordiquhill meet on the top 
of this hill ; and, on the very fpot where they meet, is a ter- 
minus, or mark, from which is feen the greater part of Caith- 
nefs, Rofs, BanfF, Murray, &amp;c. the windings of the Devern, 
part of Spey, the Murray Firth, the German ocean, &amp;c. &amp;c. 
as far as the eye can reach. In fhort, this hill affords one of

Population. — There are, at prefent, 517 fouls in the parilh, 
and, of thefe, 130 below ten years ofage. — Several old peo- 
ple died lately, upwards of 90. The oldeft perfon juft now, 
is about 86, there are three men above 8c, and as many wo- 
men ; one of them was never married. The number of males 
and females, is nearly equal. There 452 examinable perfons 
in it, 6 Seceders, about as many Methodifts, two Roman Ca- 
tholics, and one Epifcopalian. 

There is only one village in the parilh. It contains, at pre- 
fent but 12 families. It is called Cornhill: and near it, dur- 
ing the fummer feafon, there are annually held fome well fre- 
quented markets. There are but few handycraftfmen ; and, 

at prefent, only 3 apprentices. The farms are, in general, 

uninclofed, and but fmall j being commonly from L. 5 to L. 20 
fterling yearly rent — Till of late, however, few leafes were 
given without a grafium.— The people are, in general, modeft, 
fober, and of a religious deportment ; and, though few of them 
may be faid to be rich, yet there has not been any begging 
poor, belonging to the parifli, in the memory of man. — The 
contributions, feat rents, &amp;c. &amp;c. for the behoof of the poor, 

amount to about L. 6 : 10 per annum There are, at an a- 

verage, in the parifli, 5 marriages, 18 births, and 10 deaths 

annually. 

• The feed time here is commonly rimmed foon after Whitfijnday, and, by 
the middle of October, the farmer, in general, fees his' corn beyond the power 
of the ftorm. 

Among the many improvements that might be introduced into this part of

of a contented mind, not given to any peculiar vice, and regular 
attendants on public worfbip; and, though few of them are gau- 
dily dreffed, yet mod of them appear at the church in clean 
and decent apparel — About 30 years ago, there were only 3 
hats, and 3 watches in the parifh, being thofe the proprietor, 
the minifter, and the fchoolmafter ; but now almoft every la- 
bouring fervant has his hat, and watch, his Englifh cloth coat, 
his white thread ftockings, &amp;c. The ordinary fuel is peat, 
and turf ; and the making of tether bindings, aiid ropes from 
mofs-fir, is common all round this part of the country f.

•The price of labour here is much increafed of late ; as is alfo that of every 
thing. About 30 years ago a labouring fervant would have been got for 
L. 2 : 10, and now he cannot be had under L. 6 fterling a year. , Female fer- 
vants earn from L.atoL 3 fterling yearly. — The furplus grain, which annu-

bout 33 years ago, upon her father's difcouraging a young man's paying 
his addreffes to her, me went to bed, and has never left it fince. The ftrug- 
gle, it feems, between love and filial affection, ran fo high, as materially to

Land is commonly ploughed by oxen ; oxen and horfes, how- 
ever, are joined to the fame plough —But to conclude this fhort 
imperfect account at a diftance from the abodes of luxury 
and vice, the wants of the people of this parifh are but few ; 
and nothing feems more calculated for bettering their exter- 
nal circumftances, and making their days glide on comforta-

<p>
Name, Extent, Surface, Zsfc 
'"pHEparifhofLittleDunkeld is united to thatofLnganalachie; 
the latter deriving its name from a faint called Aulachy*. 
The figure of the parifh is a kind of irregular triangle, the 
longer fides being the northern and fouthern boundaries, each 
of them from 1 5 to 16 miles in length, and the fhorter, the 
weftern limit, which ftretches from the Tay on the N. to the 
river Bran, at Amulrie, (an inn on the military road from Stir- 
ling to Tay bridge) at the S, W. corner. Nature has divided it 
into three diftrifts, each of which would make a parifh of or- 
dinary magnitude, both in refpeft of extent and population. 
The firft begins at the eaftern extremity next the parifh of Kin- 

clavcn, 

* It appears from Dean Miln's marmfcript Memoirs of the cathedral of 
Dunkeld (in the pofleffion of the Duke of Atholl), that the parilh of Caputh 
once made a part of this diftricT, from which it was detached about a century 
before the Reiteration. -

Mm ™* ends at a fma11 villaRe called Invar ' ab0 ^ a quar ' f 

Z of a mile W. from the church. Murthly, the re fide nee of 
the Stewarts of Grandtully, is in this diftria, and prefents itfelf 
to the eye of the traveller, at the diftance of a mile on the nght 
hand, the moment he comes in fight of the Tay, upon the 
great Highland road from Perth to Dunkeld. This may be call- 
ed the diftria of Murthly, as the barony of that name makes 

the greateft part of it. . n r n 

The foil towards the % h a kind of black loam with a fmall 
mixture of fahd. It is for the moft part light and free, but 
not ungrateful to the hufbandman who treats it with (kill and 
induary. The furface is waving and various, but no where 
too fteep for the plough. The inclofures of Murthly are Spa- 
cious and beautiful. There is a large tratt of uncultivated 
heathy muir ; all capable of cultivation ; but a confutable part 
of it is covered with valuable woods. The weftern part of this 
diftria confifts of a (tripe of arable land, extending three mik s 
below Invar, in the bottom of a deep narrow vale along the 
Tay, adorned with oak woods and plantations. 

The hill of Birnam, rendered claffic ground, by the magic 
pen of Shakefpear, rifes on the fouth fide of this vale, with a 
rude and flriking magnificence, to an elevation higher than 
that of the Sidla hills in Fprfar-fhire oppofite to it. The foil is 
a mixed fand, far from being 'unproduftive when cultivated 
with judgement. 

The fecond diftria ftretches from Invar along the Tay abou t 
io miles, till it joins Grandtully in the parifh of Dull. The 
greateft part of this traa, having once been the property of 
the fee of Dunkeld, is called the bifhopric ; under which name 
therefore this whole diftria may be comprehended. It con- 
tains a confiderable number of inhabitants. 

The cultivated lands make the fouth fide of a charming val- 
ley, through which the river winds its courfe in a gentle majeftic

current. T\\z fields are level and of eafy culture. A' regular fyf- 
tem of agriculture would foon give this diftrict, the appearance 
of an almoft continued feries of beautiful gardens, from the one 
extremity to the other. A ride through the whole length of 
this divifion is peculiarly delightful to a traveller, paffing alter- 
nately through woods and lawns, at the bottom of a long range 
of mountains, prefenting a bold and elevated face •, and which 
by its various angles and linking projections, is everand anon en- 
tertaining the eye with varying fhades of light, and new prof- 

pedts, on each fide of the valley. Two or three gentlemens 

feats,ofafnug and romantic appearance, add confiderably to the 
beauty of the rural fcene. The foil confifls chiefly of fand, 
with fome mixture of loam. 

The remaining diftricl: is feparated from the bifhoprick by 
a large tract, of hilly ground of confiderable extent and eleva- 
tion : This too, is a valley, extending 9 mi]es weftward, from 
Invar to Amulrie, and derives the name of Strath-bran f r0 m 
the river Bran, which runs through its whole length, and falls 
into the Tay oppofite Dunkeld. The arable fields rife from 
the river towards the hills, on each fide, in a gentle flope. 
The country is planted thick with populous hamlets and farms ; 
fuftains about 1400 inhabitants, old and young, and looks 
cheerful and thriving. One of the proprietors has his refidence 
near the weftern extremity of this diftrict, which he is begin- 
ning to improve confiderably both in the way 'of agriculture 
and planting. The foil of this country is of no mean quality, 
being a mixture of reddifh clay and loam. It abounds more in 
moifture than the other diftricls, and is very favourable to the 
growth of flax. 

The hills of the parifh are thofe already mentioned, together 
with a long tract, of about 4000 acres, on the fouth fide of 
the Bran. They are for the moft part covered with heath, and 
fome of the eminences are rather barren ; but. in general, they 



of Little Diwkeld. 357 

are coated over xvith a mixed heavy mould, pretty deep, and 
producing, along with heather, various fpecies of plants af- 
fording good pafture., they rife no where fo high as to be 
deftitute of all ufeful vegetation. There are frequently deep 
falls of fnow upon thefe mountains-, yet it is feldom that a 
very confidence part of their furface remains covered for 
three fucceflive weeks : ' . 

As there is not a map of this parifh, its extent of furface 
cannot be afcertained with precifion, but from partial furveys 
that have been made, and Mr Stobie's excellent map of the 
county, there is fufficient ground for ftating it at 31, coo 
Scotch acres.

* There is no great peculiarity that diflinguifhes this from the bordering 
highland parifnes of Dowally, Logierate and Dull, with refpect to air and cli- 
mate ; they are temperate and falubrkms throughout the parilb in general. 
The two diftrifts along the Tay a«e free from bogs and ftagnant waters, and 
of confequence, from the humidity of atmofphere produced by thefe circum- 
ftances. Their fummers are warm, and vegetation forward; barley is often 
ftacked in the barn yard within lefs than four months from the (owing of it in 
the field. A great part of this country is cxpofed to fevere and unfeafonable 
hoar frofts, which prove hurtful to lint, potatoes and other crops, even in 
May, but more fo in Auguft. Great fwarms of caterpillars infeft this part of 
the parifh, and large oak woods, have fometimcs been entirely (tripped of 
their foliage, for feveral months, by thefe infefts. Dry eaflerly winds gene- 
rally fet in from the beginning of April, to the end of May ; but in othtr 
months, thefe winds are always attended with rains. 

Strathbraa is not fo fubjeft as other parts of the parifh to hoar-frofts, but 
it is much colder, and vegetation later ; barley and lint find always a timely 
harveft, but oats often fail of coming to full maturity. This is not to he 
wondered at, when it is confidered that the bed of the Bran is, at an average, 
abpve aoo fect higher than that of the Tay.

among the aged of the poorer fort, and probably owing to 
fcarcity of fuel and cold lodging. The fmall pox is not pecu- 
liarly malignant. About \6 perfons were deftroyed by a pu- 
trid fore throat in fummer 1775; but that difeafe has not ap- 
peared fince. The worft epidemics are fevers, which fome- 
tirhes fpread their contagion to feme extent ; but may be traced 
for the mcft part to great towns, whence young people at fer- 
vice bring home the infection. 

Below Murthy, is an inexhauftible body of free ftone, of a 
very fine grain, a light, vivid afh colour, and fo hard as to 
refill for centuries the injuries of the weather. The cathedral 
of Dunkeld with its tower, were built of ftones from this 
quarry. In the hill of Birnam, is abundance of flate that fplits 
into plates of a convenient fize and thicknefs, of a deep blue 
colour bordering on violet, and exceedingly beautiful. Several 
pieces of lead ore have been lately found in this fame moun- 
tain. The ore was incrufted with a white fparry, or rather 
quartrofe fubftance : One piece contained about fix pound 
weight of unmixed, compact ore, of a fmall grain, and covered 
by this kind of matrix, but open at one end. A confiderable 
portion of lead was feparated from this mafs by mere roafting 
in a blackfmith's forge. This was found at the foot of the 
mountain: But upon the higheft fummit, alfo, the fmall fif- 
fures of the rock contain the like ore, but platy and of a lefs 
firm cohefion

* Though no iron ores have been yet difcovcred above ground in this parilh, 
y^t it would appear, from fome fprings, that this metal is lodged below th: 
fin face. About a mile above Dalguife, in the hill, is a fountain flrongly im- 
pregnated with iron. The water burfts out, copiouily, in a plot of level 
ground which it covers for many yards round with the colour of ochre. Its 
tafte is that of green vitriol in ink, and fo flrong that one perceives it by only 
wetting his finger and applying it to his tongue. There is a fpring of the 
^ery fame qualities near Murthy, where the rocks, too, more clearly indicate 

the 



of Little Dunkeld. 359 

The natural woods, which make no trifling part of the wealth 
of the parift, confia moftly of oak ; and grow in frtiallcr and 
lma clumps along the banks of the Tay, all except one wood 
in 'he eaa end of Stratigram The grounds that produce 
them, are for the moft part of very poor quality, fo fteep as to 
be inaccelhble to the plough, and incapable of cultivation. 
Thefe woods are treated in the way of coppice, bemg com- 
n.only fold to wood cutters, and felled when from 20 to 25 
years old. Where the oak grows thick and unmixen with 
other wood, it fells at the rate of from L. 25 : to L. 40, and 
fail fold lately fo high as L. 54 per acre. Where it grows 
thin, or interfperfed with birch, the acre is not of near fo 
much value. But a crop, 24 yards old, of all the oak coppice 
in the parifh would fetch at leaft L. 1 0,000 fterling. It occu- 
pies about 8co acres of ground. The proprietors are improv- 
ing their oak woods by inclofmg them with ftone walls, and 
fiUing up the vacant fpaces with planted oak. The extirpation 
of the birch and other bafer wood, would alfo be a great im- 
provement. The birch woods of which there are near 2CO 
acres, and treated alfo as coppice, are not worth, at 22 years 
old, above L. 2 : per acre. 

The plantations will foon become a more important object 
than the natural woods. Within 25 years paft the Duke of 
Atholl has planted 1000 acres in this parifh, upon the 
heights round little Dunkeld and Invar, not only with Scotch 
fir, but with a great proportion (probably more than one half) 

of 

the prefence of iron. In Strathbran, near the king's high-way, there is to be 
met with a pretty remarkable kind of clay. When wet, it feels perfectly 
fmooth and unftuous ; when dry, it acquires a remarkable degree of indura- 
tion; and when pounded, the powder affects the touch like the finefl wheat 
flour. This argillaceous fubftance may be fit for fome of the finefl works 
of the potter. But very unfortunately for this parifh, there has not been yet 
difcovcred a Angle particle of lime Aone or foflil marie within its whole

oflarix; together with many thoufands of oak, afhj elm, plane* 
beech aird other fpecies j all exceeding 3 millions of trees. 
This wood makes part of a grand fyftem of plantation, con- 
ne&amp;ed with that which covers the high mountains round Dun- 
keld on the oppofite fide of the river Tay ; and the whole en- 
tertains the eye of the beholder with an afpec"t of nature pecu- 
liarly impreffive and magnificent. In the bofom of this vaft 
wood, fome hundred yards from Invar, is fituated the Duke's 
hermitage, with a cafcade on the Bran, a ruftic arch thrown 
over the river, romantic walks and gardens, and an elegant 
fummer houfe, erected upon the top of a perpendicular cliff 
40 feet high. — A lovely fcene, and the delight of every travel- 
ler who vifits it. 

All the refiding proprietors of the parifh are engaged in ex^ 
tending their plantations with great activity, but more particu- 
larly Mr Stewart younger of Grandtully, and Mr Stewart of 
Dalguife, whofe property is remarkably well wooded with both 
young and old trees. Exclufive of the Duke of Atholl's, there 
have been about a million of trees planted in the parifh with- 
in ten years paft. The full grown planted trees, including 
fome thoufands in the avenues acres and round the inclofures 
of Murthly, would fell juft now at more than L. 2000. 

A fir wood of 3©o acres, has been rifing for about thirty 
years upon a muir near Murthly, from feed blown by the wind 
from an old plantation. A confiderable part of the trees is worth 
from 1 s. 6d. to 2J. 6d, each. Mr Stewart of Grandtully has fuc- 
ceeded in railing a confiderable oak wood from acorns fown in 
pits, inftead of plants from a nurfery. In the wood of Invar 
are fome old oaks, reckoned, timber and bark together, worth 
L. 20 each.

Animals, Horfes, Cattle, Shee P .-A fpecies of fcrpent abounds 
near the hermitage and little Dunkeld which is found no 
where elfe in the parifh.-It grows to the length^ 20 inches ; 
is of a yellowifh colour, and fpeckled all over with brown fpots, 
which give it the appearance of a beautiful marble Its bite a 
not thought poifonous. This reptile is never feen m elevated 
fixations, but always in grounds of a warm expofure. The 
black fnake worm, from 8 to 10 inches in length, a noxious 
animal, is fometimes met with, but very feldom, in the fame 

traft of ground *. . . 

Three lochs in the hills of Strathbran afford abundance of 
excellent trout, as firm and red as falmon, and of a much bet- 
ter relifh. In the largeft of thefe pieces of water (loch Skiach) 
trout are fometimes caught that weigh about 12 lb. avoirdu- 
pois. The trout in the Bran are fmall, but a great many of 

them fine cheer.

tracted fome animal tribes that were utter Grangers to the pa-

» A quadruped found in the moors at the eaftern extremity of the parifh is 
entitled to notice, as a remarkable variety of the lizard tribe. It is about 9 
inches long ; the body or trunk is of an unufual length in proportion to the tail, 
which docs not taper gradually from the hind feet as in other lizards, but be- 
comes fuddenly fmall like that of a moufe. The back is full of fmall protu- 
berances, and guarded with a fkin almoft as hard as a fea (hell. The eyes large, 
clear and circular, like thofe of an ordinary trout ; the jaws more than an inch 
in length, and the teeth fo ftrong as to be heard making a ringing noife upon 
the iron point of a pole, at the diftance of more than ten feet. It is believed 
in that part of the country, that about jo years ago, the bite of this animal 
proved fatal to a child two years old. It is never feen but upon very dry 
ground. When irritated, it exprcfTcs its rage by the reddening and gliftening 
of its eyes.

and that elegant animal the roe deer, have made their appear- 
ance, and are encreafing in number every year. 

Foxes are very numerous, and badgers not a few. The 
woo ds and fields are enlivened with more than twenty fpecies 
of fmall birds, fuch as woodlarks, thrufhes, bullfinches, ftock- 
rfoves, linnets &amp;c. The birds of paffage are woodcocks, field- 
fares, cuckoos, quails, fwallows and fome ethers : The birds 
of prey, kites, ravens and hawks. 

There is no noted breed of horfes in the parifh. Thofe gene- 
rally ufed are rather fmall, and of a mixed degenerate race. 
But fince the remarkable advance of price (from L. 6 : to 
L. li : 1 is.) which has taken place of latc,'the farmers are mak- 
ing horfes more an objeft of car^e than they did formerly. 
Mod of them have breeding mares, and they ftudy to improve 
the breed. 

Except thofe upon gentlemens farms, the cows are rather 
puny ; it being too much the practice to overlook in this arti- 
cle. They are but poorly fed, and, of confequence, few of them- 
let fall calves every year, and they give little more than two 
Scotch pints of milk even at the end of June. Having little to 
eat during winter, but flraw, nor even that in abundance, 
they are wretchedly lean in the months of April and May * 

The fmall tenants here fcarce entertain any thought of im- 
proving the breed of horned cattle, and little indeed can be 
done of moment in this way, till fome nourifhing hayorfrefh 
vegetables are provided for them to eat in winter. The gentle-

men of the parifc, and a few individuals on a large fcale of far- 
mine, nre beginning to be attentive in this refpeft. 

There are two kinds of fheep; the black faced, brought 
from the foutheren counties, and the white faced fort which 
may be called the native breed. The former are bought when 
. year old at 6s. and after they have been kept here for two 
years, and have yielded three fleeces, arefold for about ios. 6d. 
each ; if kept a year longer they fetch , a,. They are general- 
ly allowed to live in open air both night and day. The native 
kind are houfed at night even at midfummer, and are much 
inferior to the other both in weight and vigour ; but their 
wool is of much fuperior quality. From the information of an 
intelligent man in the trade, it would appear, that when the 
wool of the black faced fheep fells (unfmeared) at 9 s. per ftone, 
that of the white faced brings 13s. 4 d. Thefe two kinds are 
fomewhat mixed, as might be expeded ; yet it is furprifing to 
what a degree they ftill remain diftinft. The wedders of the 
native fheep are fold to the butcher at about 8s, and the ewes 
at 7s. Their mutton is excellent. 

The loweft eftimate of the number of horfes in the parifh is 
624, of horned cattle of all ages 2528, and of fheep 8496. 

Farms, Crops. — Till of late, four horfes were yoked in a 
plough, and for each plough, or ploughgate, there were at 
leaft two, and in many inftances, four partners. Each te- 
nant's land was interfperfed in fmall ridges with that of his 
neighbours ; an arrangement commonly termed run-rig. A- 
bout 15 years ago the tenants began to divide the land among 
themfelves into fmall glebes or lots, and now they are begin- 
ning to call each tenant's land into one glebe. This may be 
confidered as the firfl ftep towards improvement. The old 
four horfe ploughs * have been divided into two horfe ploughs, 

Z z a of 



• There are not above a6 four horfe ploughs in the whole parifh, 



3 6 4 Statijlical Account 

of which, there are now about 299 in the parifh. Some of 
thefe have 6, fome 8, fome 10, and a few , S acres of land to 
labour. But in more than two thirds of this parifh, one of 
thefe ploughs, with horfes of very little more ftrength than 
thofc at prefent employed, would thoroughly labour from 24 
to 30 acres j and from 16 to 20 acres, in the remaining third. 
What an important reduftion of the number of horfes, and 
confequently of expence ? In one infhnce there have been eight 
of thefe fmall ploughs united in one farm ; in one fix, and in 
another four. Some more have been united upon a fmaller 
fcale. 

The grain raifed in the parifh is bear and oats, with a very 
few peafe. The land for barley gets two ploughings; thefirft cal- 
led ribbing, in the fall when it can be overtaken ; the other the 
feed furrow, immediately before fowing, which takes place 
from the beginning till the end of May. It is made to fucceed 
oats, and is fown with dung, and a little lime alfo when it can 
poffibly be had, the people are very eager to procure it, though 
none can be had nearer than the port of Perth. The return in 
general is about five after one, but, where lime has been ap- 
plied, eight and upwards. The boll weighs from 15 to 17 
Hone Dutch. About a boll is fown in the acre. Oats are in 
general a fcanty crop. The return is often below three after 
one. They are made to follow both barley and potatoes ; but 
it is too general a practice to take two fucceffive crops of them 
from the fame field. Taking both barley and oats together, 
the average return may be about four times the feed. 

Peafe are more prolific and luxuriant in the moift than in 
the dry lands of the parifh, where the droughts and heats of 
June frequently dwarf the crop. The kind always fown is hot 
feed, called in this country kafterns. They are fown about the 
middle of April, and reaped from the middle to the end of 
September. The produce is feldom more than three feeds. 

They

They are chiefly conndered.cn account of the draw they pro- 
duce and as a meliorating crop for the land. 

The cultivation of artificial graffes has been hitherto htde 
praaifed-, but great numbers of the farmers are now making 
Lis of them, and a general eagernefs for thefe crops begms 
to fhow icfelf- Some few have adopted them mto the. fcheme 
of hufbandry, and not one who has begun the prance would 
be perfuaded to quit it. An acre laid down with 2 o lb of red 
clover and a bufhel of rye grafs, will yield for the flrft crop 
about 300 (tone of hay, and a confiderable fecond crop the 
f am e feafon, for green feeding in the (tall, rf 2 S bolls of hme 
dells have been applied. All the land in the panfh is favour- 
able to the growth of turnips. When properly thinned, kept 
clean and well dreffed, the roots at an average, over a whole 
field, will weigh 6 lb. avoirdupoife. This vegetable will very 
feldom outlive the feverity of the winter in open air, but may 
be faved by laying it up in a dry houfe or fhed about the end 
of Oaober. The rending heritors are very laudably fettmg an 
example before the tenants with refped to both thefe crops ; 
Mr Stewart of Dalguife in particular, gives them a place in a 
regular rotation of cropping, which he is purfuing with judge-

The eyes of all the farmers round him are eagerly fixed upon

There is no fummer fallow ufed here, but in the way of 
horfe-hoed crops. So far as the deftruaion of weeds, efpe- 
cially annuals, is the end of a fallow, it is effeauaHy attained 
by the horfe hoeing of turnip and potatoes. 

This laft root has proved more beneficial to the country than 
perhaps any other produaion of the land, lint excepted. It 
has faved the tenants from the ruinous neceffity of purchafin- 
meal for their families to a prodigious amount. It is not above 
22 years fince potatoes were introduced hup the field, and cul-

meal as formerly, they can afford to fell a part of their barley to 
the d^llers. They eat potatoes for the mod part with milk, but 
fometimes with a little animal food from their flocks and herds. 
By means of this root the produce of the parifh is fully ade- 
quate to the maintenance of the inhabitants. 

Lint is another article of great importance to the inhabitants 
of this country. Potatoes and lint may be called the two feet 
that fupport them. Lint-feed is more generally fown after 
barley, but very often after potatoes. In the latter cafe where 
the land is fomewhat moift, the ground does not get a feed 
furrow for lint : becaufe this was found to be detrimental to 
the crop. It is fown in the ftate in which it was left at the 
digging of the potatoes ; and to fecure the more abundant crop 
of lint, fome of the farmers incorporate a little lime with the 
foil, by means of the hoeings for the potatoes. It is by this ma- 
nagement that the richeft crops of lint are obtained. The poor- 
er crops are from lands where fand is predominant in the com- 
pofition of the foil, but rather finer lint. In whole diftridls 
of the parifh, 4 ftone of 2 2 lb. avoirdupois, mill dreffed flax, 
from a peck of feed, Linlithgow barley meafure, is no uncom- 
mon produce i the average produce, however, is 3 none per

The proprietors are 8 in number, 4 of whom refide on their 
cftates within the parilh, and were all batchelors, till laft fpring, 
when the principal heritor, Mr. Stewart of Grandtully, mar- 
ried. Befides the above there are 4 fmall heritors, called por- 
tioners, each of whom has but a few acres. The non-refidcnt 
heritors are men of property in other parifhes. 

The men generally marry below the age of 30, and the wo- 
men from 22 to 27 years of age, and each of thefe marriages 
produce at an average about 6 children *.

* Language and CharaBer. — In that part of the parifh which is below Invar, 
the people fpeak the Scottifh dialeft of the Englifh, and are not diftinguifhed by 
any perceptible fhade of character from the inhabitants of the low country pa- 
rifhes around them. The reft of the inhabitants (more than three fourths) are 
Highlanders, who fpeak a dialed!, not perhaps the pureft, of the Gaelic. 
They have all a ftrong attachment to their native tongue ; many fpeak En- 
glifh with tolerable eafe, and the youth, by means of the charity fchools, 
can write it with rather more propriety, and copioufnefs than thofe of the low 
country part of this parifh, who are very ill fituated with refpeft to fchools. 

In their perfons few of them are above middle ftature, but of a fhapely firm 
make. To the attributes of temperance, induftry, probity and content, 
all the inhabitants are juftly entitled, with very few exceptions. They are ve- 
ry fenfibleof the advantages they enjoy under a free conftitution, and firmly 
attached to their rights, both civil and religious. Newfpapers and other pe- 
riodical publications find their way to every corner of the parifh. And feve- 
ral clubs have been formed, who purchafe the Statiftical Account of Scotland. 
Though peaceable fubjefts, they are foon interefted by any public affairs in, 
which they apprehend the general welfare of their country to be materially 
concerned. This difpofition fhewed itfelf remarkably during the American, 
war, Their attention is much roufed by the momentuous tranfattions which

hold both ftated and occafional meetings, along with the mini- 
fter and kirk-feffion, for enquiring into their (late, and pro; idl-

In the year 1782, when not only the corn crop proved bad, 
but the potatoes alfo entirely failed, L. 30 of the parifh capi- 
tal, befides 20 bolls of oats bought with a fliare of the money 
voted by the parliament, were applied to the relief of the poor 
upon the roll, and of Come of the poorer clafs of farmers. 

There are rwo places of worfnip. The chapel of Lagana- 
lachie in Strathbran, and the church of Little Dunkeld. The 
former was lately rebuilt, and made pretty commodious by con- 
tributions from the people of that part of the united parifhes ; 
the latter Hands within 60 yards of the great highland road 
leading from Perth to Invernefs by the ferry of Invar, in one 
of the fineft fituations, perhaps, in the world, for a goodly 
edifice of that kind. It is 130 feet long by lefs than 2.0 feet 
wide, and mean, uncomfortable, and ruinous. The heritors,it is 
believed,are immediately to build a handfome new church. The 
ftipend hitherto paid has been L. 70 : 16 : 8, including 4 gui- 
neasfor communion elements ; but the Commiffioners of Tiends 
have lately decreed an augmentation of three chalders of vic- 
tual, and a fmall addition for communion elements, with the 
almoft unanimous content of the heritors.

About the year 1 740, there was a handfome building erefted for the ob-

The houfe did not anfwer the intended purpofe, and the original deftina- 
tion was found to be in many refpedts inexpedient or impracticable. By accumu- 
lation of intereft, the capital amounted at laft to L. 2600 flerling ; the in- 
tereft of which is now annually applied for the. relief of poor people on the

fociety for propagating Chriftian knowledge have, very judi-

are taught for a great part of the year 160 children of both 
fexes. The good effetT: of thefe charity fchools are manifeft 
and important. By means of them the youth in the Highlands 
are early inflrudted in the principles of religion and mora- 
lity, as well as taught reading, writing, arithmetic, and a to- 
lerable knowledge of the Englifh tongue. Thus fucceffive ge* 
nerations arife of enlightened and ufeful citizens. Some have 
entertained the miftaken maxim, " That it is impolitic to

bad enough for Ruflia, or for the church of Rome during the 
periods of its fouleft corruption *. 

Rent. — The greateft part of, by far, the mod extenfive pro- 
perty in this parifh was let about half a century ago, but fome 
of it later, at a very low rental, for one or two lives, upon 
the payment of a graflum by the tenant. Not a fmall part of 
the beft lands in the parifh are thus rented at is. 8d. and 
fome of them lower, per acre, in money, together with a 
trifle paid in mutton, butter, poultry, and fome fervices. When 
any of thefe lives fall, eight, or nine times the prefent rent is

footing. Land is let at prefent at from 15s. to 20s. per acre; 
but in fome inftances, whole farms have given fo high a rent 
as 2 8s. per acre. The rent of a houfe and fmall garden is

Roads and bridges. — The road from Amulrie to the weft fer- 
ry of Dunkeld was made, and the bridges upon it built, by go- 
vernment. A great part of it is too fteep ; and the whole was 
originally marked out with very little judgement. It has beea 
always kept in good repair, but much better of late than for- 
merly. The great Highland road already mentioned is a coun- 
ty road, till it meets that of Amulrie at the weft Ferry, where 
it begins to be a military road. The want of a bridge over 
2 the

the Tay at or near Dunkeld leaves fchefe roads very imperfect. 
This matter cannot be unworthy of the attention and affiftance 
of government. The road from the Ferry laft mentioned (a 
county road) through the bifhopric towards Taymouth, is 
much frequented; but, notwithftanding many goud bridges, in 
wretched repair. From its mouth to Amulrie there are four 
public bridges on the river Bran. One of them is upon a 
county road from Tay bridge to Perth. This road if well exe- 
cuted, would be of great advantage to a confiderable traft of 
country. But fo far as it has been made it is very poor work ; 
as are mod of the roads made by means of the ftatute labour. 
The people have feldom fufficient fkill for this kind of work, 
and always perform it with reluctance. Roads are not likely 
to be well made but by fufficient undertakers.— One may ven- 
ture to pronounce, that fo low a converfion as 6d. or even 5d. 
per day of the ftatute labour, would be far preferable to the 
labour in kind. There is always a very good inn at Invar, and 
a houfe lately built at Balnagaird on the Taymouth road, pro- 
raifes to be very comfortable to travellers*. 

Improvements, 

* Antiquities, and Natural Curiofttics. — A round mount at the bottom of 
Birnam hill on the fouth eaft fide is worthy of remark, It is faced with lteep 
oaks, except for a few yards where it was fortified by art. This eminence 
has been known for time immemorial, oy the names of Court-hill, and Bun- 
tan 's-Hill, and is believed to have been on fbme occafions occupied by the un- 
fortunate Scottiih king of that name. It looks full in the face, at the diftance 
of about 12 miles, the celebrated Dunfinan-Hill, the feat and fortrefs of 
Macbeath. . Within the range of an arrow from this mount, are to be feen a 
number of tumuli or fmall heaps of ftones, about the length of a human body. 
It is not unlikely that upon digging, human (keletons would be found under 
thefe tumuli. Higher up the fame face of Birnam are the ruins of an oblong 
fquare building, with circular turrets at the corners : It is called (in Gaelic) 
Forhaillon. Birnam was antiently a foreft, and a part of the royal domain of 
Scotland. — There is a beautiful little field fome more than 2 miles above little 
J'Junkeld called Yoke Haugh, ( DalmaeoingJ concerning which there is the fol-

Improvements, and Mifcellaneous Obfervatiom.— The hills are 
far from being under proper management. There is but a 

fmall 

lowing curious tradition. A man, who may be called the Cincinnati of Scot- 
land, happened, along with his two fons, to be ploughing in this field on the 
day of the battle of Luncarty. Hearing the fate of the battle, and feeing the 
Scotch army retreating this way, he was inftantly fired with heroic indigna- 
tion, and together with his fons, feized, each of them, the yoke of an ox- 
en plough, perfuaded their countrymen to rally, and marching at their head, 
they met the Danes on the banks of the Tay, fome where near Caputh, where 
there was a fecond adion, in which the Danes were completely defeated, and 
this aged hero exhibited prodigies of valour ; in confequence of which, he was 
dignified by his fovereign with peculiar honours, obtained the name of Hay. 
and the implement with which he fought, for his arms.— The yoke is ftill the 
arms of the noble family of Kinnoul, who are thought to be defcended from 
this faviour of his country. 

On the fouth fide of the Tay, z mile below Murthly, and oppofite to the 
field where the engagement juft mentioned may have taken place, though one 
cannot fay with certainty that this was the occafion of it, there is a confide- 
rable military entrenchment. A ditch 600 feet long, and ftill pretty deep, is 
extended from a precipice on the bank of the river fouth ward, along the fide of 
a deep ravin, on the oppofite fide of which there is a fimilar work. At one 
of the an' les of this trench are the remains of a circular (tone building ftill 15 
feet deep. This work was probably executed to guard a pafs upon the Tay, 
which is fordable at this place. 

In a plain on the bank of the Bran, 3 miles above Little Dunkeld, are to be 
feen the ruins of the caftle of Trochrie, formerly one of the feats of the noble 
and unfortunate family of Gowrie. Some parts of the wall are yet Handing, 
which indicate the antient magnificence of the ftructure. When the lands of 
that ill fated houfe were forfeited, Trochrie, and the whole extenfive barony 
(in fome writs it is called Lordfhip) of Strathbran, was made a grant of by royal 
munificence to William Stewart of Banchrie, a gentleman of the bed chamber 
to King James VI. He was brother to Sir Thomas Stewart of Grandtully, 
from whom he inherited the patrimonial eftateof that antient and refundable 
family ; and had attained the honour of knighthood himfelf before his bro- 
ther's death. In a commifiion dated 16th November 1600, appointing Sir 
William baillie »f Strathbran, and keeper of the king's houfe of Trochrie., 
and of the parks and forefts of Strathbran, there is inferted the following

«* 5th of Auguft laft." This claufe is inferted in the original charter to the 
above lands, &amp;c. dated 16th July 1606; and in the fubfequent charters grant- 
ed by the fon.and grandfons of that King. — Remains of Druidical circles, of 
circular buildings called caftles, and prodigious piles called cairns, fo frequent 
in other parts of the Highlands, are to be feen in different parts of this parifh 
too. A ftone bridge over the Bran, a little above Trochrie, is reckoned among 
the oldeft in Perthihire. 

The fall upon the Bran at the hermitage has been mentioned ; but there is 
another jufl. a mile further up the river, which cannot be puffed over in filence. 
It is called the Rumbling Bridge. In dry weather there is little water in the 
Bran, and this objeft is not very (Inking ; but during a confiderablc fwell of 
the river it appears a very different character. For l'evcral hundred feet above 
the fall, the ftream thunders with prodigious force down a craggy bottom, ex- 
hibiting a mod: dreadful cataraft; then precipitating itfclf over a high cliff, it 
dailies upon the bottom of a fmall bafon with fuch fury as to lofe almoft every 
appearance of a liquid, and paffing next into a deep, dark, and narrow chafm, 
it hides* itfelf for a little below a bridge andfome huge fragments of rock Ap- 
pended, mid-way down, in the paffage, till it appears again on the other fide 
of the bridge, moving in a more peaceful current, as if tired with violent agi- 
tation. The chafm is formed by rocks of equal height, awful and ruinous, a. 
bout I a feet afunder, bending towards each other at top, and every moment 
thrcatning tremenduous collifion. The water rifing above the bafon into an at- 
mofphere 100 feet high, refembling white fmoke, and in funfhine prefenting 
beautiful rainbows; woody precipices, the hoarfe terrific roar of the torrent, 
and the rocking of the folid ground ; all confpire to heighten the grandeur of 
the fcene, and the whole affetts the mind with a certain pieafing kind of a, 
maiement and horrqr.

In, made out, a S years ago, a good large farm on a m 
at the eaft end of the parifh, which he accommodated with 
fubftantial elegant farm houfes, and out-offices that prom^e 
t0 turn to good account. A gentleman in the bifhopric is juft 
now improving a farm, acquired from the hill, of the extent of 
80 acres, which is eftimated to be rather of fuperior quality to 
the land upon the level of the Tay. It is probable that more 
improvements of this kind are coming on apace. From what 
has been already ftated, with refpeft to produce, it is manifeit 
that agriculture in this parifh it not arrived at any advanced 
ftage of improvement. 

But an aaive and enterprising {pint is now beginning to 
difcover itfelf among the farmers; which, if tenderly chenfh- 
ed and judicioufly directed, cannot fail of producing import- 
ant effeas. In riding through large diftrias of the parifh, in 
the beginning of fpring, it affords one much pleafure to ob-

Scotch plough only Is employed, and hitherto clumfily made ; 
but fome even of the fmall farmers are getting them neatly 
m;ide, and pay from 30s. to 40s. for a plough. In fhort, it 
is neither want of (kill, nor enterpnfe, tliat chiefly retard the 
progrefs of agriculture here, but other caufes, fome of which 
it ma'. 1 be proper to mention. 

Though there is a vaft extent of ftone walls reared in moft 
parts of the parifh, yet there are few or no mchjures x except 
thofe about gentlemen's feats. The farms are all either 
quite open, or deftitute of fufficient fences ; while cattle of 
every fpecies are allowed to roam at large through the arable 
fields, from the time the corn crop is carried home, till the 
fucceeding crop begins to rife. A great many of the farms 
are too fmall j being from 5 to 7 acres of arable ground. A 
farm oi this fize as effectually bars the poffeffor and one of his 
children from every other line of induflry, as one of double or 
triple the extent. Hence the fmall tenants are poor, except 
they are weavers; in which laft cafe they live very comforta- 
bly The want of lime and marie is another great difadvantage. 
Lime cannot be had nearer than the port of Perth, which is 
12 miles from the neareft, but 25 from the remoteft parts of 
the parifh. Good marls is not lefs diftant. Some rtfource 
may be found at a future period from a great body of marie, 
on the borders of the parifh of Auchtergavcn, if the proprie- 
t in and expofe it to fale. This difadvantage with refpetl 

to foflfl manures, is aggravated by the trouble and difficulty at- 
tending peat, the principal fuel in this country. Though peat 
be abundant e-nough, yet the cafting, winning, and carrying 
them home occupy the greateft part of the months of June and 
July, the feafon moft convenient for bringing home lime and 
marie- 

Thefe evils cannot be removed, nor even much alleviated, 
■wifchout great judgement and attention on the part of the land- 
lords'

!osdg One thing is obvious, from the fituation of agriculture 
steady Mated, that the tenants ought to have leafes of x 9 
ea indurance. It cannot be expeQed upon the principle 
S ufually govern human condutt, that people will be t 
h tabic and Lpence of any confutable improvement wuh- 
out fome profpea of reaping the fruits of the. labour 
To do L proprietors juftice, they do not withhold leafes with 
L oppreffive view of keeping the tenant under a racked rent. 
■ On the contrary, they a* upon humane and rational princi- 
pies ; inftead of letting their lands by the abfurd mode of auc- 
tion, or by inviting private offers under pretence of concealing 
them, they take care to inform themfelves of the true value of 
their lands, and the rent is determined in moft cafes by the ap- 
preciation of perfons of knowledge and experience in thefe 
matters. When leafes are withheld, it is with a view to let a 
number of contiguous farms become open at the fame period, 
in order to put them upon a more advantageous plan of im- 
provement, both with refpeft to the landlord and the tenant. 
-The enlarging, and, of confequence, the uniting of forms, 
might fet agriculture upon a more thriving and refpetfable 
footing; but, in this country, humanity forbids the attempt, 
till fome refources can be found out for the comfortable fub- 
fiftance of the numerous occupiers of fmall farms. Landlords 
are beginning to colleft weavers and other handycraftsmen 
into fmall villages, where they are accommodated with neat 
dwelling houfes, and each of them with an acre or two of land, 
to afford them the benefit of a milk cow and fome other com- 
forts of agriculture, without being too much hindered, by the 
labours of the field, from a vigorous application to their re. 

fpe&amp;ive trades. 

Every thing practicable fhould be done in this parifli, for 
procuring manure in a greater abundance. As nature has de-

nied it both lime and marie, the attention of the people mould 
be turned to other forts of manure. A parifli aflbciation for 
encouraging the making of compofts, by pointing out the pro- 
pereft fubftances, and granting premiums to fuch individuals 
as combined them moll judicioufly, might be attended with 
much advantage. The grazings in the hills might be greatly 
improved in fome places, by the draining of bogs, and in Or 
ther places, by turning water upon dry declivities. 

Many new houfes have been built, and old houfes allowed 
to go to ruin, for fix or feven years paft. Five farm houfes 
are two ftories high, with flate roofs. One of the tenants 
pays L. 40, one L. 100, and another L. 105, of rent. A tafte 
for cleanlinefs, and even fome degree of elegance, with refpecl; 
to the articles of lodging, houfehold furniture and drefs, is be- 
ginning to difplay itfelf. Inftead of mean dirty hovels, built 
with ftones without cement, dwelling houfes are now built by 
good mafons with mortar, caft on the outfide with lime, and 
neatly finifhed within. Many young men appear at church 
and market drefled in Englifh cloth and round hats, and the 
young women in printed cottons or linens. It is perhaps 
to be regretted that more attention is not paid to the wool- 
en manufactories, a8 an article of domeftic induftry and ceco-

<p>
Name^ Extent, and Stipend. 

THE name of the parifh in Gaelic fignifies it is faid, 
the " bare little valley;" which might have been the cafe 
when it firft received its name ; but time has produced great 
changes here, in refpec~t of fruitfulnefs. Almoft in the mid- 
dles, of the parifh ftands the church. The length of the pa- 
rifh from S. to N. is about 6, in breadth from E. to W. 4 
computed miles. — Hills furround the greateft part of the parifh. 
The foil is deep and good in the low grounds, thin and fandy 
on the fides of the hills to the S.— The air is dry and healthy in 
general. Fevers are the mod common diftempers. — There 
are many excellent fprings, at the foot of the hill, and in o- 
ther parts ; fo that every village except one, is well fupplied 
with water. — There is a confiderable lake, called the loch of 
AuchlofTen, nearly one mile long, and more than half as broad 
at the fouth end •, and which produces pikes and eels in great 

plenty

plenty. Some large pikes 6 feet long, weighing about 25 lib. 
have been taken in it. It yields likewife fome grafs, as horfc 
pipes, &amp;c. Ducks, geefe, and fometimes a few fwans, fre- 
quent this loch, and afford good fport for gentlemen and o- 
thers. In fummer it is divided into 2 parts, and the paffage for 
the water between them may be about 5 feet wide ; the loch 
is frozen in winter, and may be travelled on. In its prefent 
ftate it has many inconveniences. It frequently overflows in 
fummer, carries off the fuel, and hurts the corns growing near 
it; about it the frofts and mildews are fevere, and the wild 
fowls deftru&amp;ive, efpecially in the night time. It has been 
propofed by the proprietors to drain off the water, and render 
the grounds arable ; the greateft depth when founded, did not 
exceed 6 feet. The rent, for the almoft ufelefs ground atprefent, 
might be confiderable, and fome marie perhaps got. Some 
years hence the plough may be feen going where the ugly 
and voracious pikes are now lying ; and corns growing 
inftead of almoft ufelefs weeds. The neighbouring towns would 
then be more healthy, and no depredations made on their crops. 

Meal-mead and Craiglich are the mod confiderable hills } 
the latter is fteep, and arifes from the arable land about a mile. 
They are in general covered with heath, having fome green 
vallies on the fides of the rivulet, and afford pafture to large 
flocks of fheep ; turf and peat for fuel, and a few birds for 
game. 

Population. — For about 20 years back the population has not 
varied much. The return to Dr. Webfter in 1755, was 682 
fouls i the prefent number of inhabitants is 621. Males and 
females bear the fame proportion as in other parifhes; the births 
on an average are only 10 or 12 yearly ; marriages 5 or 6. 
There are 44 farmers, 4 fmiths, 2 weavers, 3 wrights, &amp; 
ftioemakers, 6 millers, 1 taylor, 3 ftudents at the univerfity 

of

of Aberdeen, 2 merchants, 3 or 4 families of feceders, 2 
Roman Catholics in the parifh. 

Productions.— The number of black cattle is 902, of horfes 
153, and of fheep 1907. About 200 bolls of meal, oats, and 
bear, may be annually fold out of the parifh. The crops are po- 
tatoes, bear, oats, turnips, peafe,fome lint, butlittle artificial grafs. 
No heritors refide here, and we are in the infancy of winter 
herding, though there is great occafion for it on many accounts. 
Several tenants keep bee-hives ; a firft fwarm fells for about 
20s. fterling if the fummer be favourable, 3 fwarms may be 

looked for from each hive. When killed, the beft hives 

yield from 10 to 1 2 pints of excellent honey ; for which, 3 s. 4cL 
to 5s. per pint maybe gotten. There is not one third of the land 
under culture. Some induftrious tenants have ploughed feveral 
acres fromjthe heath/one 15, and another about 14, acres. After 
ploughing it lies a year unfown then they take feveral crop3 
before it is allowed to reft. One man affirms that he had for 
the firft crop from a fmall piece taken from the muir 8 returns, 
or 4 bolls from half a boll, which yielded 3 bolls of meal. There 
are apparently many ridges in the hills not now ploughed. The 
hills are very fit for wood, yet none of them are planted. 
Commonty, and the non-refidence of heritors, are the caufes 
of this great defea. The want of fire wood is every year more 
and more felt. Nay all the afh and plane trees, &amp;c. onfomc 
eftates are now cut down 5 as are likewife the allers that grow 
on the burns of Lumphanan, Findrach, and Pool bogg ; fo that 
there are remaining only a few trees in the tenants yards, and 
the people are obliged, with a great lofs of time, and much 
expence, to purchafe wood from the neighbouring parifhes. 

Advantages, and Ufadvantages The advantages are an

fcc are very good and fetch high prices. Meal laft fummer 
fold at Finzean's girnell at 17s. per boll of 9 Hone. The north 
and fouth roads, paffing through the middle of the parifh, give 
the farmers many and eafy opportunities of falling in with 
the fouth country dealers in cattle; The parifh is well fupplied 
with garden plants from Auchoor and Mill-town of Auch- 
loffen, where 3 gardeners refide. It has likewife a good fchool- 
mafter, but his encouragement is fmall, and the fchool built 
in a very improper place. Many cattle are reared here, and 
the principal roads are not bad. On the other hand, the pa- 
rifh is no lefs than 24 meafured miles from Aberdeen •, has no 
lime nor marie, nor can the high grounds often get any advan- 
tageTrom watering';; grafs is fcarce, and few cattle can be kept 
in fummer. The farmers muft often fell them to great dif- 
advantage when the labouring is finifhed, put them to glens, or 
ftarve them at home. The fheep are often a prey to the foxes 
from the woods of Craigievar and Abcyne. The fuel is fetch- 
ed from the diftance of 2 computed miles, and on bye- roads 
where carts are drawn with danger and difficulty. Little is 
done by many from Whitfunday to the beginning of autumn 
but to call, dry, and lead peats. Some think it would be as 
cheap to bring coals from Aberdeen, The north and fouth 
roads, too, are attended with fome inconveniences from beg- 
gars and pilferers. The mill multures are heavy, the tenants 
affirm, that in multures, &amp;c. they pay 1 boll in 12*

of Craigivar, Bart, is patron. The church was built in 1762. 
The rr.anfe in 1782. In the minifter 's garden are plenty of 
geen trees and low fruits, and the trees bear well. The fitu- 
ation is pleafant, and fo healthy, that there is a proverb, that 
no minifter dies here. The glebe may be about 6 acres, but is 
ftrangely and inconveniently divided ; fome of it lying above 
half a mile from the reft. 

There are 4 heritors, one of whom has two thirds of the pari fh. 
The number of poor on the roll at prefent is only 6. The weekly 
collections are about iod. "We have no other funds except a 
few pounds in the Kirk box. The years 1782 and 1783 ob- 
liged the minifter and elders to give out L. 10, or L. 12 extraor- 
dinary ; victual then was very fcarce and dear. A neighbouring 
heritor, Mr. William Brebner, was then of great fervice to 
his own, to this, and to other parifhes. He imported, 
and brought home from Aberdeen with his own carts, oats, 
bear, &amp;c. grinded them, and fold the meal at moderate prices. 
Sir William Forbes likewife ordered his factor at Craigivar to 
diftribute fome meal among the poor in his lands, and did not 
exa£l all his rents. He likewife procured feed for his tenants, 
who fuffered greatly. Many were much reduced that year *.

Ploughs, Farms, and Inclofures.— There are about 56 ploughs 
of land in the parifh, but fometiraee 2 or 3 are united, and la- 
boured by one plough or 10 oxen, fo that there are not above 
44 ploughs yoked, thofe exceptedwho join andlabour their fmall 
crofts in a few weeks- The ploughs in general confift of 8 
or 10 oxen.— There is one farm held by 2 tenants at L. 50 5 
others pay from L. 25 to L. 30 ; moft of them L. 12 with 6 
or 8 bolls of meal and 3 or 4 of bear.— Many of the farmers 
have carts, and fome of the crofters—The houfes are now a 
little better than formerly, the new ones being built with good 
ftones and mortar,and pinned with lime,— Afew have chimneys 
and wooden floors, and are covered with heather. The of- 
fices in general are yet mean. But as fome heritors are now 
allowing payment to the tenant at his removal, for walls, the 
houfes it is hoped will foon put on a better appearance. The 
way of managing farms is none of the belt.— Lands rent at 
L. 1 per acre in-field, when let to crofters by the tenant, who 
pays little lefs for it himfelf, and yet he often labours the ground 
for his fubtenants.

great enemies to them in winter *, 

Mifcellaneous 

* One or two feemingly druidical places of worfhip are known, alio a pretty 
large ftone without inferiptions near Kinlocher. At the manfe there is a cu-: 
rious font ftone, % feet diameter. A few old coins were found fome years ago, 
when repairing the church-yard dykes, and a mortctoth bought with them. 
Very lately above L.ioofterling.all in Queen Anne's fiiillingswerefound.by two 
herds in one of the dykes of the Gordon's fold near Auchhove. Their parents 
had taken one of thefe folds for grafs ; and the boy and girl were taking down 
fome (tones to let their bealls get in to feed, where they accidentally found 
the money. Tradition fays, that it is only a part of 50,000 merks hid there 
in 1745, by one Malcolm, a fervant belonging to Mr Duguid of Auchhove, 
who unfortunately joined in the rebellion, and that the reft was fecretedin 
a man's boot. — The unfaithful fervant, after Culloden, returned home, and was 
feen going about the dykes as if he had loft fomething ; — when examined, he 

faid it was a filver headed fword that he was learching for. The Pool Bogg 

near the manfe, confifts of 50 acres, now inclofed, and rented at about 10 gui- 
neas. About three fourths of the ground are arable. The burn of Lumphanan 
which runs through it, formerly, in the time of rain, when it rofe high, did 
great deftruiftion, carrying off the earth, and covering the ground with fand and 
fmall ftones ; but thefe evils are now remedied. Near the middle of the bogg 
ftands a fort, built chiefly of earth from the moat around it, not perpendicular, 
but contracting as it rifes ; it appears round, but is really oval. The height is 
12 yards. It meafures 86^- yards in circumference at the top, and the area 
may fow 6 or 7 pecks of oats. The moft at the bafe is 23 yards wide. With- 
out lies another ring 350 yards round. It is uncertain who built this fort; fome 
afcribe the work to Longueville who came over from France in Wallace's time ; 
fome to Wallace himfelf, and call it Gargunnock- Others give it a much ear- 
lier date. Before the invention of gunpowder it has been a place of ftrength '* 
and it often excites the curiofity of ftrangers. 

Macbeth's Cairn lies about a meafured mile north from the kirk, on the 
trow of a hill, is 40 yards in circumference, and rifes pretty high in the middle- 
Farther up the hill are feveral fmaller cairns. It is faid by fome that Macbeth, 
flying from the fouth, had but a few men with him when he reached Lum- 
phanan ; that he endeavoured to hide himfclf at a town called Cairn Baddy, but 
flying from hence went about a mile north, till M'Duff out-riding his com,- 
pany, came up with him at that place where the cairn now lies, killed him, 
in fmgle combat, and brought back his head to his men.

Mlfcellaneous Remarks.-^* people are not expenGve in 
diet or clothes -The young folks begin to appear more gay on 
public occahons.- All are punftual in attending public worflup, 
and feem pretty well pleafed with their condition. The farmers 
complain of graflums, and fhort leafes, but efpeaally the want 
of fervants, their high wages and little work. It is evident that 
the tenants here muft take theburden of the work on themfelves, 
and pay every attention to their bufinefs, elfe they muft go to 
ruin. It cannot be faid that any of them are making rich ; few 
are laying by fo much cafh as their fervants. In winter they 
often can get little done for fome months, on account of the 
ftorms of rain and fnow, and great frofts. During the long 
winter nights the men fervants think they mould do nothing for 
their mafters advantage. Subtenants there know not how to 
employ themfelves fo as to get bread. 

The public roads are not bad, being kept in tolerable good 
order by the ftatute labour ; the people fometimes grudge that 
they are called out, efpecially when well advanced in life, 6 

days every year, or that they muft pay money Bridges are 

much needed, as the burns fwell fuddenly, and become almoft 
impaffable. Nor are they in much better condition often in 
winter frofts. Two great roads interfeft one another very near

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6415851">GLENISLA</name>. 

(presbytery of meigle, synod of Angus and 
mearns, county of forfar.) 

By the Rev. Mr. James Donald.</head> 

<p>Name, Extent, l*fc. 

LENISLA derives its name from its local fituation, be- 
ing placed in a glen through which the river Ifla runs. 
— From the head of this parifh to the foot, taking a ftraight 
line, it meafures about 1 8 Englifh miles, but if all the windings of 
the river are taken in, it meafuresprecifely 25 miles and one fur- 
long. Its breadth, at an average, will not exceed 2 miles. 

The Ifla, which takes its rife from Caan-Lochan, formerly a 
deer foreft of the family of Airly, runs through the middle of 
the parilh. This river abounds with trout of a tolerable fize ; 
there are alfofalmon'to be found in it, though they are prevented 
from getting far up by a fall of water below the millof Craig, mea- 
furing betwixt 70 and 80 feet perpendicular, called Reeky- 
Linn, from the fmoke which conftantly afcends from the wa- 
ter 



of Glenljla. 39* 

ter. This fall makes a very grand appearance at all times, but 
more particularly when the river overflows its banks. 

Soil, Climate, fcrY.-The foil is in general of a light nature, 
and full of ftones. In the lower part of the parifh, however, 
where improvements, are carried on, it appears to be deep 
ftrong loam, producing good crops of corn and grafs. In the 
upper part, lime {tone is to be got in great abundance from 
three different quarries. But the expence of quarrying and 
burning prevents the inhabitants from reaping great benefit 
from it. Some of the more opulent of the tenants drive marie 
from the Loch of Kinnordy, about 9 miles diftant, which ma- 
nure turns out to very good account. 

The air is very pure, and the people in general very healthy. 
The healthinefs of the people, however, may be afcribed to 
their manner of living. They are not pent up in houfes, nor 
employed in fedentary occupations like many others, but^roam 
at large in the open air, tending flocks of fheep and cattle. 
Several inftances of longevity are to be found in the parifh ; 
particularly onejman in his 94th year, ftill vigorous and retain- 
ing all his faculties, another 82, and a third 76. During the 
fummer months, it is very fultry, but frofts generally fet in by 
the end of Auguft, and the winters are commonly very fevere. 

The people, efpecially in the upper part of the parifh, are 
late in beginning to fow, owing principally to the frofts which 
keep the ground long, particularly after a fevere winter. It is 
often the latter end of March or beginning of April, before 
the feed- time is begun. This, of courfe, prevents the grain 
from ripening foon ; fo that it is frequently the middle, and

almoft ufelefs by them. The barley takes a deadly whitenefs 
after this happens, and the kernels when unhufked, immedi- 
ately after the froft, are foft and watery, and in a fhort time 
grow fhrivilled and dry. Oats, when frofted, acquire in a 
few days a bluifh call. Thefe frofts prevail here moftly in the 
month of Auguft. 

Population — On the 1 2th of July 1 791, there were living 
in the parifh 1018 fouls; of whom 224 were under 10 years 
of age, 456 between 10 and 20, and 338 widowers and mar- 
ried — The return to Dr. Webfter in 1755 was 1852 fouls; 
fo that the population has decreafed confiderably fince that pe- 
riod. 

No exa£t regifter of baptifms and marriages has been kept 
here for many years paft ; fo that from what records belong 
to the parifh, little material can be learned. From thefe re- 
cords it appears that for 9 years preceding 1792, there were 
236 baptifed, and 93 couples married. 

The greater part of the inhabitants have fmall farms, with 
a confiderable extent of pafturage annexed to them. About 
54 of them are fmall proprietors or portioners, and a great 
part of thefe occupy their lands themfelves. There are juft 
now in the parifh 3 blackfmiths, 8 weavers, 7 taylors, and 4 
wrights. What is remarkable, there is not a fhoemaker in the 
parifh. All the inhabitants are of the eftablifhed church ex- 
cepting 8 Non-jurors, 5 Catholics, and 1 Burgher Seceder. 

The general character of the people is, that they are hu- 
mane, and when they form an attachment to a perfon, will 
exert their utmoft efforts to ferve him. They are not indeed fo 
induftrious as could be wifhed. The fummer months are moft- 
ly fpent in providing fuel and tending the flocks ; while the 
winter months are moftly confumed in burning this fuel. With 
xefpeft to their morals, they are punctual in attending on public 

worfhip,

Church and Poor.— The value of the living is L. 55 : 1 1 : i&amp; 
fterlirig. The glebe and garden may be worth about L. 3 Iter- 
ling. The king is patron of this living. The manfe and church 
are very old. 

The number of poor who receive alms from the kirk-feffion 
Is about nine. The yearly fum expended for their relief will 
not exceed L. 12 fterling. This fum is raifed from the Sun- 
day colleaions. What further fupport they Hand In need of 
is fupplied by charitable and well difpofed perfons— The funds 
belonging to the poor do not exceed L. 40 fterling.— By fome 
old records it appears, that in the year 1 704, the Sunday collec- 
tions did not exceed 3d. a week, now at an average they a~ 
mount to 3s. 6d. There are no travelling beggars belong- 
ing to the parifh ; but in the time of fheep ihearing it is much 
infefted with vagrants from adjacent parts of the country *.

* The price of barley arid oats is generally regulated by the Dundee mar- 
ket. Indeed the grain produced in this diftridT: is not fufficient for the con- 
fumption of the inhabitants. Oat meal generally fells at 15s. and barley meal 
at ios, and 10s. 6d. per boll of 8 (tones of 16 lb. — Beef, mutton, and pork, Is 
no lefs than 3d. per lb. of 16 oz.— The price of a pig is as. 6d. — of a hen 
8d — of a duck 6d. and of a chickerl 3d. Butter is fold at 6d. in fummcr, 
and when falted, at 8d. per lb. of 32 ounces.— The (lone of cheefe is general- 
ly js. but the price varies according to its richnefs and age. Ewe milk cheefe 
is fometimes fold at 7s. per done. 

The wages of men-labourers are generally is. per day, from March to Sep- 
tember, with maintenance. The women feldoiri hire by the day, except in 
the time of fpinniug wool, when they receive 3d. per day with maintenance. 

The day-wages of 2 mafon are is. id. — of a wright is. — and of a taylor 
with maintenance. 

Farm-fcrvants generally draw from L. 7 to L. 8 fterling per annum, with 
maintenance. — Women fervants receive L. 3 fteriing a year, along witri t omc

Rent and PW^.-There is but a very fmall part of the 
panfr, inclofed. Indeed one of the heritors, fufficiently aware 
of the advantage and propriety of improving ground covered 
with heath, has inclofed a good many acres of muir ground, 
adjacent to his houfe, with fir and birch trees, which prefent- 
ly appear to be in a very thriving ftate. Would his neighbours 
follow his example, the country would not wear the bleak af- 
pea it prefemly does—The belt atable land lets at about 20s. 
per acre, but to this is annexed the privilege of hill pafturage. 
The rent of the parifh may be between L. 600 and 700 fter- 
lmg. This, however, is varying every year. The heritors, 
as has been mentioned, are 54 in number, of whom about 
32 refide in the pariffi. It is impoffible to afcertain the num- 
ber of acres contained in it, the arable ground bears but an 
infignificant proportion to that which is covered with heath. 
The plough moftly ufed in the upper part of cheparifh is the old 
Scotch plough, generally drawn by 4, fometimes by 6 horfes, 
yoked a bread of one another ;— what is peculiar, the driver 
always travels backwards. This mode, no doubt, has been a- 
dopted, on account of the weaknefs and fmall fize of the horfes, 
which are moftly of the Highland breed.— In the lower part, 
the Englifii plough is for the moll part ufed, and is drawn by 2 
horfes. One man holds and drives. 

The vegetable produce is bear and oats, no wheat is fown ; 
turnips, and potatoes are railed in the lower part of the parilh ; 
in the higher part of it turnips are but now introduced, and 
indeed it is impoffible this crop can turn out to advantage, 
while the inhabitants allow their fheep to feed promifcuoully 

after 



bounties, which in value may amount to 6s'. or 7s. fterling. About 40 years a- 
go, the wages of a man-U'rvant did not exceed L. 1 : 6 : 8 flerling a year with 
maintenance.

after the corns are put into the barn-yard?. With refpeft to 
animal produftions, the country abounds in black cattle ; thefe 
are generally of a fmall fize, but very durable; the largeft will 
not exceed the weight of 1 8 or 20 ftones of 1 6 lb. The num- 
ber in the parifh at prefent amounts to about 1696. The 
iheep, which are generally kept in the hilly part, are but of a 
fmall fize 5 fome of .the inhabitants, however, go yearly to the 
fouth of Scotland, where they purchafe numbers of black 
faced fheep, which turn out with them to good advantage. 
The precife number of fheep cannot be afcertained. The 
country abounds with muir fowl, and feveral gentlemen keep 
fhooting quarters, which they regularly attend during the 
feafon. Here are hares and foxes in abundance. Ptarmigans 
are alfo to be found at a place called Caanefs, towards the head 
of the parifh. 

Mijcellaneous Obfervathns The roads are in very bad 

repair, and muft continue in the fame ftate till proper over- 
feers are appointed to infpecT; them, and the road money of 
die parifh appropriated to their repair. The bridges are only • 
two in number (though the extent of water, from the head to 
the foot of the parifh, is about 25 Englifh miles.) "Were a 
bridge built centrically between thefe two, which are 9 miles 
afunder, it would be a confiderable advantage to the country 
at large, and free many individuals from inconveniencies they 
prcfently labour under. Indeed there are fome funds for a 
bridge already, and fubfcriptions might be expected to com- 
plete the fcheme, were there any public fpirited perfon to fet 
the work on foot.

MEARNS, COUNTY OF PERTH.) 

By the Rev. Mr. Colin Symers.</head> 


<p>
Name, Extent, &amp;c. 
Hp HE parifh of Alyth lies on the north fide of Strathmore. 
A It is about 12 miles long and 3 broad at an average ; 
ftretches from S. to N. towards the Grampian mountains, 
and is bounded by the parifh of Meigle on the fouth, from 
which it is divided by the water of Ifla,— by Ruthven and Airly 
on the eaft, from which it is likewife feparated by the Ifla in 
its courfe from the hills towards the S. 

The parifh is divided into two confiderable diftricts by the 
hills of Alyth, Loyal and Barry. The fouthern diftri£t, which 
lies in the Strath, is about 4 miles long and 3 broad. The 
lower part along the water of Ifla is extremely fertile, produc- 
ing excellent crops of barley, oats, and wheat. The cultiva- 
tion of grafs, turnips, potatoes, and other parts of the new 
hufbandry, is carried on with great fucctfs. Several of the 
proprietors have divided their eftates into fields, inclofed with 

hedges

hedges and hedge-rows. The frequent inundations of ft 
fla winch fometimes rifes fuddenly in harveft to a great 
height „ , of ten attended with great difappointment and ,of, 
othe hufbandman. This was the cafe in^So, and two or 
three inftances more fatal have happened within thefe twenty 
years, fhefe might ferve as lefions to the tenants to drag 
their corns out of the water mark immediately when they are 
cut down, a pradice too much negleded by them. Much of 
this rmkhief, arifing from the prefent winding courfe of the 
Ma m its way through the valley, might be prevented by 
itraightening its channel. 

The traft of land towards the hills is equally fertile, and in 
rooft feafons produces heavy crops of com and graft. Its fine 
expofure, lying oppofite to the genial rays of the fun, is friend- 
ly to the quality of the grain, and its early ripening. The 
corns are feldom hurt by frofts, to which the low ground is 
more fubje£t._Crop S of flax in the whole of this diftrift are 
generally good, and the quantity fown has greatly increafed. 
Three, and often four ftones of flax, at the rate of 24 lib 
avoirdupois to the ftone, is no uncommon return after the peck 
of feed. There are three lint mills in this diftricl, and all 
well employed. The farmers rear a confiderable number of 
young cattle, and ufe turnips in this way more than in feed- 
ing cattle. They likewife rear a few horfes, but not in fuffici- 
ent numbers to ferve themfelVes. 

The farms are not too large, nor do they feem to be too high 
rented , none of them exceeding L. 140 ; and there are fome 
fmall pofleflions, at L. 20 and L. 15. Good ground gives from 
1 S s. to 2 is. an acre. Marie is the manure commonly ufed, of 
which there is plenty, and of the beft quality, at the diftance 
of three or four miles. Confiderable quantities of lime are 
brought from Dundee, the neareft fea port town. Its fupe- 



nor

l-ior quality, and the advanced price of marie, will focn make 
it more ufed. 

The village of Alyth is fituated in this diftrift. Its name 
is of Gaelic extraaion, and is expreffive of its fltuation, being 
built on a flat near the foot of a hill. It was made a burgh of 
bnrcny by a charter from James HI. The whole of it belongs 
La iuperiority or property to the Earl of Airly, who has a large 
and valuable eftate in this part of the parifh, which has been 
long in the poffeffion of that noble family. The fituation of 
the village is healthy 5 it is well fupplied with water, excellent 
fprings are found on all fides, and a fmall river runs through 
the lower part of the town. Over it are two bridges, by which 
the inhabitants have eafy intercourfe ; manufadures of differ- 
ent kjnds might be carried on here to great advantage. There 
is a weekly market in the village, tolerably well fupplied with 
butcher meat, poultry, butter, cheefe, &amp;c. and feveral annu- 
al fairs for black cattle and fheep are held here. The chief 
articles are yarn and brown linens, of which a great quantity 
is manufactured in the town, and diftrict around it. The 
quantity of cloth damped from the ill November 1787, to the 
ift November 1791, at an average, was 258,639 yards yearly, 
and the medium price L. 6939: 10:3 A- This branch of 
trade, though lately much improved and enlarged, is far from 
being carried on to that extent it would admit, and well de- 
ferves. Perhaps not one half of the yarn fpun in this part of 
the country is manufactured in it. The diftance from Dundee, 
(15 miles), where moft of cloth is fent, is compenfated by 
cheaper labour and living : the intercourfe is made eafy by the 
turnpike road betwixt Dundee and Meigle, which will be foon 
finifhed. And there is a plan in agitation for continuing this 
road from Meigle to Alyth, and erecting a bridge over the Ifla 
in that line, which it is much to be wifhed may take place, as 
at would be a moft eflential benefit to the country.

4°o Statijiical Account 

The number of inhabitants in the village is almoft doubled 
fince 1774. At that time they amounted to 555 ; now they 
^ are increafed to 1060. Several acres of ground were lately 
feued by the proprietor, on which a number of houfes are built, 
and poffefTed chiefly by manufacturers. The land in the ba- 
rony of Alyth near the village is let out in two or three acres, 
for the convenience of the inhabitants, and is rented from 30s. 
to 40s. the acre. The gfeateft difadvantage this part of the 
country labours under is want of fuel ; the time fpent in cart- 
ing and winning peats, and the expence of bringing them 
home from a diftance of 5 or 6 miles, are great inconvenien- 
cies to the hufbandman and the manufacturer, who begin to 
find it more for their intereft to ufe coals, though there are 
none to be had nearer than Dundee. 

In furveying this diftricTb, it takes away much from the plea- 
fure, to obferve a large common (called the Muir of Alyth) of 
feveral hundred acres, a great part of which is capable of im- 
provement, and might be made to raife corn and grafs ; the 
reft of it is well adapted for planting. As it is now under 
fubmiflion, it is to be hoped a divifion will foon take place. 

On the other fide of the hill of Alyth there is an open coun- 
try of confiderable extent, and capable of much improvement. 
The foil in a great part of it is good, and the crops far from 
being deficient. When the ground is more cultivated, and 
drained where it is wet, there will be lefs reafon to complain 
of the latenefs of the crops j which cannot be fo much owing 
to difference of climate, as to the advanced ftate of agriculture. 
Till lately, the old mode of farming was followed in all thks 
diftrift, viz. taking crops of oats and bear alternately from 
the in-field, and after three fucceffive crops of oats from the 
out- field, letting it remain as long in ley. But now a better 
fyftem of agriculture is introduced, and a fpirit of indurtry 
promoted among the tenants. In a few years hence, when the 

thriving 



of Alyth. 401 

thriving Plantations are farther advanced, the farms properly 
divided and inclofed, and a rotation of crops obferved accor- 
ding to the leafes lately granted, the value of the property, and 
the appearance of this part of the country will be much increaf- ■ 
ed and improved— Beyond the hill of BamfF is the" foreft 
of Alyth, a large traft of heath ground, eonfifting of more 
than 6000 acres, which chiefly belonged to four proprietors 
who Weired it in common s but is now divided among them. 
The foreft, which is flcirted on the W. with arable ground 
affords pafture for a coafidcrablc number of (beep and black 
cattle. The {heep are either of the Linton breed, or thefmall 
white faced kind faifed in this part of the country. An excel- 
lentbreedofwedders,broughtfromLintonannuallywhenayear 

old, thrive well. They are commonly fold when four years 
old at i 3 s. or 14s. the head. Their wool is coarfe ; indeed 
none of the (heep here are remarkable for fine wool.-In the 
foreft are very extenfive moffes, which fupply the country around 
with fuel. It abounds in game, efpecially muirfowl, and is 
much frequented in the (hooting feafon. At the extremity of 
the parifh there is a beautiful little country, furrounded with 
hills.and interfefted by the black water or Ericht, which in fum- 
mer has a delightful appearance. That part of it conneded 
with this parifh called the Blacklunnans lies in the county of 
Angus. 

Rent and Population.— The valued rent of the parifh is 
L. 8233:17 :4 Scotch. There are 5 or 6 heritors who have 
confiderable eftates, befides feveral fmaller proprietors, and a 
number of feuars. The family of BamfF, reprefented by Sir 
William Ramfay, Bart, have charters of the eftate they now 
poffefs, fmce the reign of King Alexander II. A. D. 1232. 
Three of the confiderable heritors refide part of the year in 
the parifh, and moft of the fmaller ones.

The heritors have on all occafions been ready togrant every thing

family of Airly claim the patronage. 

Alyth is an excellent ftation for a fchoolmafter, being in the 
centre of a populous parifh. The heritors have augmented 
the falary to 200 merks Scotch, and built a fchool and fchool- 
mafter's houfe on a larger fcale than ufual. The falary, and 
perquifites of the feflion clerk's office, will amount to L. 9 — 
The fchoolmafter has likewife the intereft of L. 40 fterling,

been lately increafed and regulated ; and, by the favour of the 
heritors, the fchoolmafter enjoys fomc very confiderable advan-

The Society for Propagating Chriftian Knowledge have fta- 
tioned one of their fchoolmafters at Drumfork in Blacklunnans. 
The prefent fchoolmafter, who is an old man, has retired with 
a falary of L. 7 fterling; his fon who is appointed afliftant 
has L. 9 fterling yearly. This inftitution is attended with fm- 
gular advantage to that remote corner of the panfli. Young 
people are taught reading, writing and arithmetic, and early 
inftruacd in the fundamental principles of religion. The 
number of fcholars is ufually from 60 to 80. 

P«r.— The poor in this parifh are not fo numerous as for- 
merly, and are always well fupplied.-The heritors and fef- 
fion meet every half year, when a lift of poor is taken, and 
their particular circumftances being duely confidered, a fuit- 

able weekly penfion is fettled on each of them. The funds 

for their fupport are the weekly coitions, the intereft of 
L. 161 fterling, at L.4* per cent, and the rent of fome galle- 
ries in the church. As thefe do not amount to one half of the 
fum required, the parifh is aflefled to make up what is defi- 
cient-, the heritors in \he proportion of their valued rent pay 
one half of the affeffmcnt, the other half is paid by the tenants. 

The inhabitants are fober and induftrious, and regular at- 
tendants on public worfliip : With the improvement of their 
outward condition, they are more liberal and humane in their 
fentiments and difpofitions. The fruits of induftry appear in 
their drefs and manner of living. Mean cottages are exchang- 
ed for more comfortable habitations, and thofe who before 
found it difficult, with all their labour, to procure the neceflfa- 
ries of life, now enjoy many of its comforts and conveniences.

From this ftate it appears that the number of poor is decreaf- 
ng,*and the expence diminishing. This is to be afcribed to 
ihe improving ftate of the parifh, and an increafing fpirit of 
tnduftry among the people. The linen manufadure affords 
iemployment for old and young of both fexes, and the price of 
J ibour is greatly advanced. None are admitted on the poor's 
roll who have not been three years atleaft in the parifh, before 
they fell into neceffitous circumftances, and they fign a bond 
giving the kirk-feflion a right to the whole or as much of their 
effefts at their death, as will reimburfe the parifh for womy 
they received from the poor's funds. The feffion referve the half 
of the weekly collections, which they give occafionally to poor 
families and individuals not on the roll. Begging is not allow-

* Barty-hill is about a mile in circumference' at the bafe, and 676 feet

a temporary retreat in time of war, and well adapted for that purpofe ; as it 
muft in antient times have been reckoned almoft impregnable. The account 
handed down that Bary-hill was the place where was confined Queen Vanora 
or Guineva, the wife of the Britifh king Arthur, who was taken prifoner in a 
nattle between the forces of that monarch and thofe of the Scots and Pitfs, 
has fo much the air of fiction, that it hardly deferves any credit. 

In a ploughed field, on the S. fide of Loyal, an artificial cavity has been 
lately difcovered. It is in the form of a ditch, about fix feet deep, and four 
fcroad, faced up on both fides with ftone, and covered with large broad {tones 
on the top. The tenant who occupies the ground uncovered part of it which 
he found full of aflies. Whether thefe are the afhes of facrifices offered by our 
anceflors to their deities, or of thofe warriors who may have fallen in the de- 
fence or attack of the fortification on Barry-hill, to which it is contiguous, is 
matter of conjecture. The extremities of this cavern have not yet been ex- 
plored. 

On the N. fide of the hill of Alyth is the farm of Bahwhyme, which was 
the living of a church-man before the reformation. It was exchanged for the 
^ lands of St. Ninians in the lower part of the parifli,. which belonged to a laic. 
The approbation of the Pope, and his charter of confirmation were thought 
neceflary to give validity to the exchange of a mailing which within thefe few 
years did not produce above 100 Scotch in yearly rent. A flrong proof of 
the very great influence his Holinefs had at that time in the difpofal »f 
church benefices. </p>

Soil, Climate, C5V. 

THE parifh of Old Cumnock, from which that of New 
Cumnock was disjoined early in this century is of 
an oblong figure, partly fiat, and partly hilly. — The foil in 
general is clayey, and at the bottom, a ftrong till. Part of 
it mofiy ; all the holms are of a light dry foil, formed of fand 

and gravel. The air in general, as through all this higher 

part of the country, is moift, but not unhealthy, as may be 
collected from the number of aged perfons, and from there be- 
ing no prevalent diftempers. An averfion to inoculation pre- 
vails here, and has net yet been removed by all the pains made 
ufe of-, in confequence of this ths fmall-pox occafionally makes 
havock among the children. But this muft gradually leflen, as 
inoculation gains ground, though flowly, every year.

4^8. Statijllcal Account 

We have feveral mineral fprings, chiefly chalybeate, and ma- 
ny rivulets, all running into the water of Luggar, a ftream which 

empties itfelf into the river of Air near Barfkimming This 

ftream abounds in trout, and fome eels are found in it. On 
the confines of the parifh, are three lochs or lakes, which may 
cover in all about 100 acres of land. Their depth is unknown, 
and they communicate each other. The water of the eaftern 
one runs into Aith, while the weftern loch runs into the wa- 
ter of Luggar. The fifh in thefe lochs are pike and eel. 

Hills and Minerals.— The hills, (for the parifh has no moun- 
tains), though partly covered with heath, are chiefly green, 
; nd abounding in a coarfe fpecies of grafs called fprit. There" 
are feveral volcanic appearances in them, on which are found 
ftones of the Bafaltic fpecies ; alfo a few figured ftones ; and 
in the beds of the rivulets, petrifactions of ftiells and fifh are 
thrown up from the ftrata. Thefe are alfo found in an exten- 
five lime quarry, belonging to the Earl of Dumfries, and one 
of its upper beds abounds with a fpecies of coral. The lami- 
na of lime ftone in this quarry are of different qualities, and 
the lime ftone in fome places, being mixed with fhells and 
fpar, takes a very finepoliih, and would make a pretty enough blue 
marble. Through this quarry, there runs a fmall vein of lead 
*M-e. This upon a late trial, being dreffed and fmelted at the 
works of Wanlockhead, was found to produce 65 lb. of lead 

from 100 cwt of ore. Free ftone abounds in different parts 

of the parifh, and particularly in the vicinity of the village. 
The quarries are of eafy accefs, and fupply materials of the 
bell kind for building. Many houfes have been rebuilt, and 
3 good many new houfes have been lately erectedfrom thefe quar- 
ries-, in the village and vicinity. Coal is ft 111 more plentiful. 
A confiderable part of the parifh is fuppofed to ftand upon it. 
One of mines has been woiked for more than 30 or 40 years.

And there are other mines now opening in the immediate 
neighbourhood of the village. The confumpt, though pretty 
general, is however inconfiderable. What is ufed by the vil- 
lagers and round the country excepted, it is principally con- 
fumed in burning lime ftone. Of this, as above faid, there is 
an inexhauftable quantity in the parifh. The prefent price of 
coals is as nearly as. can be gueffed, 2S- 6d. per ton. The 
lime in {hells 2id. perbufhel, five of which are equal to eight 
Winchefter bolls. And the lime ftone, unburnt, is. 8d. and 
2s. per ton. All at the coal hills, lime poft and kilns ; confe- 
quently exclufive of the expence of leading. The Earl of Dum- 
fries has alfo in this parifh a blind coal, which he attempted 
_io export to Ireland. But the expence of a land carriage of 
about 1 6 miles to the port of Air, obliged him for the time 
to relinquifh the defign.

The increafe of 327 fince anno 1765 is the more remark- 
able, becaufe, if the numerous fmall farms now under grafs, 
and let only from year to year, were let upon leafes of 1 9 years, 
this circumftance would make a very confiderable addition to 
the number of fouls, proportionably heighten the general po- 
pulation, and fhew how much, as with reafon has been fup.

pofed, it is upon die increafe The lifts of births, deaths 

and marriages, in the table, are taken from the parifh re- 
gifters, which, though kept with care, cannot be depended 
upon ; owing to the obftinacy and ignorance of the people, 
and their averfion to have the births and deaths in their fa- 
milies duely inferted. The general average of births is fuppofed 
to amount to 51 annually, which is as 1 to 32 of the whole 
population. As to the average of deaths, for the reafon above 
given, this cannot be afcertained, nor can the incumbent ob- 
tain means of afcertaining them with any accuracy. Of the 
twin births mentioned in the table, three happened anno 1790 
when there was an uncommon number of fuch births in this, 
and in other countries — A fact remarked at the time, but never 
attempted to be accounted for. The people, particularly thofe 
in the manufacturing line, and women fervants, emigrate, to 
Glafgow, Paifley, and Kilmarnock. And of late fome of them 
have gone to Catrin and Muirkirk. But thefe emigrants have 
not materially affected the general population, to which the 
Earl of Dumfries, by the number of labourers he employs, 

gives all imaginable encouragement *.

under culutre, notwithftanding the flovenly mode of agri- 
kure too generally followed, It is apprehended the parifh 
uld not only fupply itfelf with provifions, which for the molt 
part it is fuppofed to do at prefent, but might furnifh confi- 
derable quantities of meal, as it now does, of butter and cheefe, 
and occafionally fome barley (big), to the great works ofMuir- 
kirk and Catrin, both which are in its neighbourhood ; the 
former at .0, and the latter at 5 miles diftance. In moil years 
Vhe inhabitants bring meal from Dumfries- (hire, and pot 
barley from Lothian. Part is confumed in the parifh, and part 
is carried to the above mentioned works at Catrin and Muir- 
kirk. Flax was of late only cultivated in this parifh, and there 
are now lint mills all over the country. Its culture in confe- 
quence was increafing, but has of late been checked by the 
prevalent tafte for, and ufe of cottons. Few grafs feeds are 
fown, except by the gentlemen who have the property and 
refide in the parifh, who may have a few hundred acres under 
fown grafs.— For the reafon already mentioned, the bulk of a- 
rable land is under pafture. Peas and oats are fown in March 
and April, and big in May, and reaped in September and 
October. The crop moft attended to is potatoes, of which^ 
the people all over the country make great ufe. There are 
varieties of marble and clays. One porcelain, ochre, &amp;c. as 
reported from an actual furvey lately made. The wetnefs of 
the climate is one of the chief difadvantages. — The diftance 
from markets is now happily removed by the works of Muir- 
kirk and Catrin ; the influence of which on this country in ge- 
neral, the parifh fhares in *.

The poor are fupported in part from the intereft of the ca-

Dumfries.— The great roads from Air to Dumfries, from Air 
by Muirkirk to Edinburgh, from Glafgow by Galfton, and 
Sorn to Dumfries, and from Glafgow by Kilmarnock to Dum- 
fries, pafs through this village. It is diftant from Edinburgh 
5 8, from Glafgow 36, from Dumfries 45 from Air l6 » and 
from Kilmarnock 16 miles. Befides the advantage of the pub- 
lic roads, the parifh is greatly benefited by many crofs roads, 
running in different dubious, to the extent of ten or twelve 
miles, which the Earl of Dumfries has made at his own pri- 
vate expence for the conveniency of his coal, lime, &amp;c. and 
while they ferve thefe works they greatly benefit the parifh and 
country in general *.

* On the lands of Borland are the veftiges of a chapel or religious houfe ; and 
the farm is, to this day, named chapd-boufi. Thefe lands were originally in a 
family of the name of Hamilton, from whom they pafled by marriage into 
the Montgomerys, a branch of the Coylsfield family; and having palled 
through different purchafcrs are now the property of the Earl of Dumfries. 

In the vicinity of the village of Cumnock are the remains of a moat, whci.% 
as tradition fays, the baron courts were held of old. It is almoft entirely 
furrounded by the Lnggar ; and as its banks are fleep and completely wooded, 
there, the whole forms a very beautiful and piclurefque fcenery. The caflle 
ef Terrenzean lies alfo in this pariih. It is now in ruins ; has flood on an ele- 
vated bank above the Luggar,in a beautiful fituation; was probably the man- 
fion that belonged to the barony of Terrenzean, which fucceflively pafled 
from abranch of the Crawfords to the Boyds. Upon their forfeiture it fell to the 
Crown, who having fucceflively made grants of it to different proprietors, it 
came at laft into the family of Lowdon, from whom it was purchafed by ths 
Earl of Dumfries, whofe property it row is. From this barony, the prefeat

The people in general are above the middle fize.— The ma* 
nufadures in the village are weaving, fhoemaking, tanning, 
dying &amp;c. The manufacturers and tenantry in general have 
little or no flock worth mentioning ; they are in confequence 
moderate in their expences, ftrangers to luxury, but with the 
country iri general, acquiring a tafte for drtfs, which, with o- 
ther flight fymptoms of progrefs in civilization, will probably 
in time be an incitement to their becoming more induftrious. 
At prefent the great body that make up the inhabitants of 
the parifh may be faid to enjoy freedom to work or to be 
idle ; ftrangers in general to intemperance, their living is 
chiefly fupplied by the dairy; the manufacturers excepted, 
who with a few others, may be faid to be better acquainted

<p>
Situation, Name, and Extent. 

THE whole of the parifh of Tarbat belonged formerly to the 
county of Rofs ; but, in the year 1693, Cromarty hav- 
ing been erected into a feparate jurifdi&amp;ion, and the property 
of the Earl of Cromarty in different parifhes being transferred 
to the erected county, the barony of Tarbat, as a part of his 
eftate, was included in that arrangement-, and the parifh is now 
almoft equally divided between the (hires of Rofs and Cromartyi 
— It is fituated at the eaftern extremity of the country, with the 
fea on every fide, except on the W. and S. W. where it is 
bounded by the parifh of Fearn. On the S. and S. E. it has 
the Moray Firth. — At the E, and N. E. another branch of 
the fea breaks in betwixt Rofs and Sutherland, and bounds this 

parifh on the N. The fea, after palling Tarbat- Nefs, 

turns in to the land, and forms a capacious bay, at the S. E. 
corner of which lies the harbour of Portmaholmack. Imme-

dately above the harbour, the land rifes to a confiderable 
height, extends eaftward into the fea 3 miles in length, and 
is not more than half a mile in breadth at the neck which joins 

the head- land to the body of the parifh. From thefe local 

circumftances the parifh has its name. — Tarbat, being a Gae- 
lic word, exprefilve of the peninfular fituation of the place, 
and its having the appearance, when viewed at a diftance, of 
a body ftretched out in the fea and nearly furrounded by it, 
Tar fignifying a Belly or Prominence, and Bait, drowned or 

immerfed in water. -The parifh is in length 7^ miles; in 

breadth it does not in any part exceeds miles; in circumfe- 
rence it is iof miles, and of that meafurement 15 miles belong 
to the fea coaft. 

Surface, Soil, Isfc. — There are no high mountains or high 
hills in the parifli. Geanies has the moft elevated fituation of 
any place belonging to it. There, a rocky precipice to the S. rifes 
more than 20 feet above the level of the fea, and the fields on 
the N. and N. W. defcend with a confiderable declivity, a de- 
gree of which continues all the way to the north fliore, though 
in moft parts fo gradual as to be fcarce perceptible. There are 
in fome other parts, a few rifmg grounds, which have a fimi- 
lar efleft, but, in general, the fields are nearly level, or have 
no inequality but what is rather ufeful than otherwife. — There 
is a variety of foil ; fome of a loamy quality \ fome light, with 
a mixture of fund, or lying upon it ; and a part of it, deep,- 
with a bottom of hard gravel. There are no lakes or rivers in 
the parifh, but there are a number of fmall lochs or natural 
ponds, which become dry in fummer ; and frefh water fprings 
are to be found in every corner, particularly in parts near the 
fea. One of them atPortmaholmack is remarkable for the lighfc- 
nefs of its water. At a fhort diftance is another, within flood- 
mark, which difcharges the fait water at ebb, and becomes

ing on the fea, gives it a mod extenfive profped. There are 
particular ftations from which may be feen a part of eight 
counties, with a long range of coaft, from Cullen to Fort- 
George, on the S. E. and S. and from Dunbeath and the Ord 
of Caithnefs, to the Doun of Creech in Sutherland, on the 
north. 

There are two public roads in the parifh running parallel. 
The one leads ftraight from Tarbat-Nefs to the ferry of Cro- 
marty, and is called.the rock-head road, from its being carried 
along the top of a bank, rifing above the fea, and rocky in 
fome parts. The other road paffes by the church, through 
the middle of the parifh, and leads to the ferry of Invergor- 
don. There are crofs roads alfo, one of which leads to Tain, 
the head burgh of the county, where a weekly market is held, 
to which the inhabitants refort. In this and every parifh through- 
out the country, the roadsfcre made moft convenient for travel- 
lers, from the particular attention given to that branch of po- 
lice. The work has hitherto been performed by ftatute labour, 
and the'people have been regularly called upon, for repairing the 
roadsalready made, or makingnew ones, where found necefTary. 
But a plan has lately been propofed, and approved, to have the 
ftatute labour commuted, it being left optional to pay a certain 
rate of money, or to perform the fervice in perfon, in terms 
of the ftatute.

Meafurementy Manure, Natural ProduBlons y &amp;c There 

is no general map of the parifh, but, according to feparate 
plans made of the different eftates, it contains 5081 acres; of 
which, 2998 are arable, 66 out-field, 643 pafture, 1135 muir, 

82 mofs, and 166 planted. The muir ground, which bears 

fo great a proportion to the arable, notwithftanding the appear- 
ance of poverty in its prefent neglected ftate, might, by in- 
clofing, mixing the different foils by trenching, and laying on 
lime, be turned into good arable ground, and brought to yield 
profitable crops ; of this, there is fufficient proof from what 
is done by the cottars in thofe fpots on which they fit down ; 
and an experiment on a larger fcale has been made lately, and 
with fuccefs, by Mr. Macleod of Geanies, on a piece of this 
kind of ground of about 40 acres, which are now improved 
into fields of corn and grafs. The muir grounds, where 
not fit to be improved for thofe purpofes, might be rendered 
ufeful, by inclofing and planting them with fir and other tim- 
ber fo much wanted in this place, which there is every reafon 
to think would grow here as in other parts near the fea. The 
thriving plantations begun fome years ago by Mr. Macleod of 
Geanies on his wafte ground, and to which he is making year- 
ly additions, may, it is to be hoped, call the attention of 
the other gentlemen of property in the parilh to this obje£t. 

The arable ground yields barley, peafe, oats and rye. Half 
is generally laid down with barley, or bear, and the ground is 
prepared by covering it alternately with fea weed and dung, 
with a mixture of black earth and gravel, this laft being found 
ufeful to give firmnefs to the foil rendered open by the fre- 
quent ufe of fea weed. 

In different parts near the fea, are banks of {hells, which 
to the naked eye, have the appearance of coarfe dark coloured 
fand. Mr. Wight, in his progrefs through the country, view- 
ed thofe banks, and recommended the ufe of the (hells as a

ofTarbat. 4* 1 

manure. They were tried, but the trial not fucceeding, pro- 
bably through a failure in the management, a fecond attempt 
has not yet been made.- At the bottom of fome of the mofies, 
marie has been difcovered. That found at a place called 
Meikle Tarrel is of the richeft quality, and has been ufed for 
fome years paft by the farmer there, much to his advantage. 
Mr. Macleod of Geanies has alfo confiderable quantities of 
rock and pit marie on different parts of his property. In two 
farms, fome of the fields lie on a ftratum of ftone of a red co- 
lour, which when dug up, is foon diflblved by the fun and 
weather, and when fpread on the ground, is found to have 

a powerful effect in meliorating the foil and crops. On a 

few of the farms, oats are the principal crop ; peafe were fown 
in large quantities, and the returns were profitable, but that 
part of the crop has now failed for many years. Potatoes 
have happily come to fupply the deficiency. There is not 
a farm, or {mail croft, a part of which is not laid out in 
cultivating this ufeful root. It would be difficult to alter - 
tain the extent of ground employed for this purpofe, or the 
quantities raifed yearly, but both muft be very confiderable, 
as they are ufed in every family, and conftitute the principal 
fupport of fome of them, during nine months of the year. 

The fowing of grafs and turnip feeds, is another improve- 
ment in agriculture which begins to take place in the parifh. 
Mr. Macleod of Geanies fet alfo the example in this, by lay- 
ing large fields under green crops. Having his ground inclo- 
fed gives him great advantage for this, and every other improve- 
' ment in farming ; but the farmers have become fenfible of the 
benefit of fowing grafs in the open fields ; and of late, confider- 
able quantities of clover and rye-grafs have been laid down in 
this manner, which there is reafon to think will become a more 
general practice. 
The number of farms.in the parifh, including thofe occupied 



4 22 Statijlical Account 

by principal farmers and their fubtenants, is 59. The number 
of ploughs is 94, commonly drawn by 6 or 8 oxen, and a few 
on the fmaller farms, by 2 horfes and 2 oxen The quan- 
tity of barley fown yearly, is calculated to be 774 bolls; of 
oats 1056 bolls i and of peafe and rye 290 bolls. 

Rent.— The valuation of the parilh, as it Hands in the.cefs 
books, amounts to L. 4421 : 10 : 10 Scotch. The real rent, as 
paid in barley, and from a few farms, partly in barley, and 
partly in oat meal, amounts to 2352 bolls, which, converted 

at 12s. the boll, is equal in money to L. 1411 :4s fterling. 

There is a money rent befides, of L. 340 : 4 : 10 fterling, which, 
added to the former, makes the whole rent to L. 1751 : 8 : 10 
fterling. — Oat meal is now always received and paid away by 
•weight, and 9 ftones is the common ftandard of the country 
for a boll, and where meal is mixed, as in the rent paid from 
mills, I2f ftones are put to a boll.— One farmer pays his rent 
in money, at a converfion of 10s. the boll, another farmer pays 
the half of it at a converfion of 1 is. Some of the farms where 
the foil is richeft, are let at the rent of 30s. the acre of arable 
ground ; fome of them pay from 20s. to 26s. or from 15s. to 
2os. and other farms are fet at 10s. and under; but at an a- 
verage, the rent maybe calculated at 1 is. 9c!. the acre of ara- 
ble ground. The muir and pafture lands are not comprehend- 
ed in this eftimate, thefe are confidered as pendicles of the 
farm, but being open and common to every one, throughout 
a great part of the year, the farmer can count very little on his 
profits from them. 

The parifh produces much more corn than is fufiicient for 
the fupport of the inhabitants. The victual rents are fold 
yearly, to be carried to other parts of the kingdom, or ufed 
in the country, by diftillers, and thofe living in towns, or the 
Highlands. 

Cattle, 



of Tar bat. 



4*3 



Cattle, Horfis, and Sheep.— There are in the parifh 11 76 
black cattle, including milch cows, &amp;c. 573 horfes, 2080 fheep. 
Only a few of the black cattle are reared here, the greateft 
part being purchafed at the different fairs held in this county, 
and in Sutherland, in Odober and November. After fomc 
years work, when they begin to fail in their ftrength, they are 
fold to che drover, or butcher, fometimes at a higher price than 
that for which they were firft bought. The horfes bred m the 
country are moftly of a fmall fize, but hardy and fit for the 
drudgery to which they are firft put. Many of the farmers 
in this and other parifhes of the low country, now repair to 
the markets in Moray and buy larger horfes, which coft from 

L. 6 to L. 13 The fheep are alfo of a diminutive kind, but 

by being paftured on the fhore-grounds become fat, and fetch 
a good price. A target breed has been lately introduced into 
the Highlands, and a few of them are brought down to this and 
other parts of the low country *. 

* The expence of a married fervant, including meal for maintenance, his 
fees and other allowances, may be fairly eftimated at L. io fer annum. The un- 
married fervants are commonly maintained in the farmer's houfe, and the fta- 
ted fees and other perquifites may be rated at L. 4 yearly for a man, and half 
that fum for a female fervant. 

In this and other parts of the country, the harveft is generally cut down 
by a fixed number of reapers, in proportion to the extent of the farm. They 
are hired for the feafon, and paid either in corn, or money, as they chufe. 
A man has aos. or the value of it, 15s. is the common allowance given to a 
woman reaper. They are either maintained in the family by their employ- 
ers, or have fome additional allowances for their maintenance. It has now be- 
come more frequently the praftice to call a number of reapers as the corn ri- 
pens, to difpatch the work and prevent lofs by the weather. They are paid 
at the rate of 6d. or 8d. per day. 

The ordinary hire of a labourer for farmer work is 8d. per day, and for garden 
work, cutting peats and mowing? grafs, is—Ditchc*, dykes and trenching 
are paid by measurement, and coft as follows ; ditches 2d. finglc ftones dykes

Boats, Fi/heries, and Harbours.— There are 12 boats belong, 
ing to the parilh, of that number two are moftly employed in 
carrying freights. Some of them belong to people who fifti 
occafionally, and require no more than two or three hands 
to work them. There are five fiftier-towns on different parts 
of the coaft. The proprietors of the ground furnifti a new boat 
every feven years, to be upheld by the crew, and are entitled to a 
fifth part of the fifh caught,, or of their gains of whatever kind* 
but thefe dues are now moftly converted into money. The 
larger boats pay annually L.4 fterling and the fmaller L. 3— 
Every fpecies of gray fifh is to be found on the coaft, and a 
great variety of fliell-fifh. From a trial made at an expence 
of the gentlemen of property in the parifh, it appeared, that, 
with the neceffary tackle, ling, holybut and turbot might be had 
in abundance. Some old people remember a cod fiftiing at 
Portmaholmack, where the beaches for drying the cod are ftill 
to be feen — This year 1 792 a lobfter fiftiing was begun, and 
carried on very fuccefsfully, partly by Meflrs.Selby and Creff- 
well of London, but moftly by a refpectable fociety, under 
the firm of the Northumberland fifhing company. In the 
courfe of the feafon, from March to July, more than 50,000 
lobfters were caught at Tarbat-Nefs, and near it ; and from 
fir ft to laft, 28 veftels touched at the point to receive the lob- 
fters, and carry them to market. The charters of one proper- 
ty in the parifh convey a right to a falmon fifhing, but if any 
fuch did ever actually exift, it has been fo long difcontinued, 
that there is no remembrance of it. However, falmon are 
fometimes feen fpringing out of the water, near the fhore ; 
but there being no rivers to invite their ftay, it is probable they 
only take a ftiort reft here, in proceeding to, or returning from 
the rivers and lochs in the Highlands, where they leave their 
fpawn. 

The variety of fifti upon the coaft, occafions it to be frequen- 
ted 



of Tarbat. 4 2 5 

ted by feals, porpoifes and whales. A large one of the fper- 
maceti kind was in the year 1 756 ftranded on the rocks to the 
welt of Portmaholmack. It meafured 63 feet in length, and 
yielded a great quantity of fpermaceti and blubber. The otter 
is foretimes furprifed at land in his lurking places, and is va- 
lued for his lkin *. 

There are upon the different fides of the parifh fix harbours, 
and a number of fmall creeks. Of the harbours, Portmahol- 
mack is the only one fit to receive veflels of any confiderablc 
burden, the reft being merely landing places for open boats.— 
There was a ftone pier built there, at the expence of 
the firft Earl of Cromarty, which now, through time and 
neglea, lies in ruins. The want of this pier has, within thefe 
forty years, occafioned the total lofs of three veffels, and as ma- 
ny more were, from the fame caufe, ftranded on the (hallows 
in the frith, and not got off without much damage and ex- 
pence. From a furvey lately made, it appears, that at full fea, 
with a fpring tide, there are thirteen feet of water at the pier 
head, and 9 feet with a neap tide. Ships driven by eaf-

* Of land animals, the fox has his den amongft the rocks, and lives 
jnoftly on (hell-fim, though fometimes he makes excuilions in fearch of 
game, and to commit depredations on the farmer's poultry.— The hares are 
numerous in the parifti, and remarked for their fwiftnefs ; when the fnow 
lies on the ground, they retire to thefhores as a place of warmth and fhelter. — 
Of game birds, patridges are in great numbers in the parilh, though 
kept down by the hawk and kite, and other birds of prey, as well as the 
fportfman.— The green plover or lapwing comes early in the fpring, and 
quits the country again in the months of July and Auguft. — The fwallow and 
enckowcome in the fummcr, and difappear in the middle of harveft; when 
thefe birds, take their departure, numerous flocks of curlews, mountain plo- 
vers, wild gcefe and fwans return with their young ones from the hills and 
lochs, where they had hatched and reared them in the fummcr months. The 
various kinds of the wild duck do not remove from this place, but are inhabi- 
tants of the marfhes and (horcs, during the whole year,

te-rly ftorms could with eafe pafs Tarbat-Nefs and He here in 
fafety, the fituation of the harbour giving it (heifer from e- 
very wind which might hurt. 

There is not in the N. part of Scotland, and what is called 
the low country, a place better calculated than Purtmahol- 
mack, if fo well, for a (idling ftation, from the convenience of 
its harbour, its nearnefs to the fea where the fi(h is to be 
found, proper ground adjoining whereon to ere£l houfes, and 
plenty of excellent free-done at hand to build them. 

From the increafe of trade, and the eftablimment of manu- 
factures in this, and the neighbouring county, veffcls have oc- 
cafion to proceed more frequently than formerly through the 
frith, to Tain, Dornoch, and other parts on the coaft, which 
adds to the importance of Portmaholmack, as a place for 
thofe veflels to run into when overtaken by ftorms. The 
late Sir John Gordon, who was then the proprietor, had an 
intention of afking the aid of government, for repairing and 
enlarging the pier, and plans of the work, and eftimates of the 
expence were made out. Further progrefs in the affair was 
prevented by the death of that worthy gentleman ; but the 
reafons dill exift in their full force; nor could a few hundred 
pounds of the public money be laid out on a work more 
uftful and more neceffary *. 

Population 

* There are five caves on the coaft, the entry to one of which is fo low, 
that to get in, one muft creep on all fours; within there is a fpacious apartment, 
having around it a natural bench of ftone. The entry to another refembles 
a /lately porch, which (lands at the diftance of feveral feet from the rocks, 
and from this entry there is a covered way to the body of the cave, which 
runs a confukrable length, and has three apartments, one behind another 
arched at the top like a vault, through which the water oozes, and in time of 
fioft hangs from the roof in a number of icicles. 

At the northmoft point of Tarbat, is a creek accedible to a boat at highwa-

creek having the fea on each fide. No veftiges remain of the bmlding, both _ 
the mote and a narrow neck or caufeway which led to it from the land being- 
now covered with grafs ; but it is eafv to trace the foundation of a wall of con- 
f.derable extent, which defended it on the ludfide. The creek retains the 
name of Port-Chafteil, or Caftlehaven, and from it, the firft Earl of Cromar- 
ty, affumed one his titles of nobility, and transferred that name to the old 
family feat, Tarbat, which is now in the maps of this part of Scotland marked 
Caftlehaven. This fort might be intended to repel the Danes and Norwegian, 
who formerly fo often infefted the coaft, or as a place of fecurity from the 
predatory incurHons of the natives in thofe uncivilized times, when it was cuf- 
tomary for the head of one clan with hisfollowers, to break into the territories 
of another, with every aft of hoftility.. 

The parifhes of Nigg, Fearn and Tarbat lie in a direft line betwixt Dun- 
fcath, or Dunfheath-Nefs at the weft, and Tarbat-Nefs, where Port-Chafteil 
lies, at the eaft, and both forts, from their fituation, would eafily protect thefe 
and the other adjacent parifhes, which, from their fertility, were moft liable to ' 
be attacked by plunderers. And the etymology of the Gaelic word Ether Do- 
«r, or Eddlr dba Mhuir, is exattly defcriptive of the f.tuation of the fort at 
Tarbat-Nefs, which ftood on a narrow point betwixt two feas. If this ac.

One caufe of the decreafe of the number of inhabitants is 
uniting different farms into one, a practice undoubtedly inimi- 
cal to population; another caufe is the lofs of fome fifhermen 
at fea, the removal of others from the parifh, and that fome 
crews were fuffered die out, without having their places (ap- 
plied. But what chiefly contributes to the decreafe of the in- 
habitants, is a yearly emigration to the fouth of young people 
who never return. 

There is now living in the parifh a female dwarf, aged be- 
twixt 30 and 40, who meafures only 34 inches ; in height 
there is no other deformity about her. 

Difeafes, Climate, and Fue/.— There are no difeafes peculiar 
to the parifh from climate or any other caufe ; but there have 
been inftances of more than ordinary mortality from epidemi- 
cal diftempers fpreading over the country, and making their 
way hither. The fevers now mod common are of the ner- 
vous and putrid kinds. A fpecies of the latter is diftinguifh- 
ed by the name of the yellow fever, fo termed, becaufe as foon 
as the patient expires the body becomes of that colour. The 
fmall-pox is the difeafe which has proved molt fatal to the ri- 
fing generation, its effeds were particularly calamitous in 1 756, 
when it carried off 75 children. In 1768 it cut off 46, and 
58 fince the month of October laft (1791). Some families at 

thofe 



.fount fhall be rejected, it will be difficult, by tradition or any other way, to find 
a place wherein to fix the caftle of Ether Dover. 

There were in the parifh fix of thofe houfes called caftles, which towards 
the end of the laft and the beginning of this century were inhabited by antient 
and refpectable families. One of them belonged to the Sinclairs of Dunbeath. 
—The ruins of another ftand a monument of the tafte and grandeur of former 
times. The old name was Tarbat Caftle, and Ballone, from a marfh behind 
it. It ftands above the fea, and upon the very limits of the property, as if 
intended to prevent incroachments.

thofe different periods loft their whole children. Inoculation 
when tried failed only in one inftance, and there are families 
in the place, in which there was not an inftance of recovery 
until this method was taken; notwithftanding which, the peo- 
ple ftill retain a ftrong prejudice againft it, and feem deaf to 
all arguments ufed to (how its lawfulnefs and expediency, as 
a mean which providence has bleffed for faving thoufands of 
lives. 

The air here is very pure, there is little rain in fummer, be- 
caufe there are no mountains to condenfe or break the clouds; 
during that feafon, the breezes from the eaft ferve to allay the 
heat and refrefh the fpirits through the day, and bring dews, 
which promote vegetation, in the night. 

The parifh labours under a confiderable difadvantage, from 
the fcarcity of peats and other fuel. The privilege of the 
fcanty modes in the parifh is reftritted to a few families living 
on the properties to which they belong, and the far greater 
part of the inhabitants are left to make the beft fhift they 
can for this neceflary article of life, and put to a great ex- 
pence of time and money in purchafmg and getting it carried 
home. A circumftance hurtful to the farmer, by taking him 
off the work of his farm, and which renders the condition of 
the poorer fort very uncomfortable during the winter and 
fpring feafons, and proves in general a great check to induftry. 
They begin now to ufe coals from Newcaftle, and find this 
the eafieft way of fupplying themfdves ; and for fome time 
pad a cargo from that place of 5 or k 6oc barrels, is annually de- 
livered in the harbour of Portmaholmack, at is. 1 id. or 25. 
each. They could be had much lower, but for the high duty 
laid upon coals carried to the north of the Red-Head. 



Ecclefuiflkal State, Schools, and Poor.— -Tarbat was one of die

menfal churches belonging to the Bifliop of Rofs. The Bifliop 
was patron, and had what remained of the tiends, after the 
(hare allowed by him to the perfon employed to perform the 
duties of the paftoral office. At the revolution the King be- 
came patron, and the Earl of Cromarty obtained from Queen 
Anne a gift of the patronage, which has now devolved upon Mrs 
Urquhart of New-hall. — The church was built in 1 756, and the 
manfeh-11707 — Byadecreet of locality anno 1708, the ftipend was 
modified at nine chalders, payable equally in bear and oat meal, 
with'thevicarage or fmall tithes — There was a new decreet ann» 
1 78 1, by which no alteration was made in the victual, but 
300 merks Scotch, of money ftipend were appointed, and the 
vicarage tithes made over to the heritors. The living at the 
ordinary converfion may be eftimated at L. 90 fterling, includ- 
ing a fmall glebe of four acres. From the ftate of the free 
tiends, there is a large fund for an augmentation. The eftate 
of Tarbat, which is nearly the half of the parrfti, pays no {hare 
of the victual ftipend. The reafon of that exemption when 
the former decreet pafTed, was a long tack of the tiends ob- 
tained from King William by the firft Earl of Cromarty, which 
is now run out. 

There is a parochial fchool near the church, and a conveni- 
ent houfe lately built for teacher and fcholars. The falary 
is L. 5 fterling in money from the heritors, and 8 bolls of bar- 
ley from the farmers, and this with the other emoluments 
may be eftimated at L. 16 per annum. — There are no diflenters 
in the parifti, except three families who have lately come from 
a part of the country in which a feceding meeting houfe is 
cftablifhed ; but they occafionally attend the eftabhfhed 
church. — Gaelic being the common language of the people, 
the greater part of religious fervice on Sundays is performed in 
that language. Many of the inhabitants are taught to read 

EngUfh,

EngHfh, and fome who cannot read, underftand a little of it 
in common converfation ; but in general, they prefer Gaelic*. 

The number of poor (landing at prefent on the parifh roll 
is no. Few of thefe are mendicants. Widows, fatherlefs 
children, and orphans left deftitute, fervants and labourers 
laid afide with age or ficknefs are received into the number, 
and have a fmall pittance given them at an annual diftribution 
made of the money arifing from the ordinary coitions in 
church on Sundays, and from the parifh mortcloths and bells, 
amounting commonly to about L. i6or L. 17 fterling.— Extra- 
ordinary colleaions amounting, to 2, 3, or L. 4 fterling, are 
fometimes made for the relief of perfons in circumftances of 
peculiar diftrefe. There is no other fund for the poor but a 
charitable donation by the firft Earl of Cromarty, from a part 
of his property in the parifh, which bears the name of the 
mortified lands : and is exempted from the payment of cefs and 
other public burdens. The charity paid from thefe lands is 
36 bolls barley ; i2f bolls of which belong to this parifh, and 
the remaining part to the parifhes of Fodderty, Kilmuir and 
Loggie Eafter.—It was intended for the relief of decayed far-

walls of one of them remains, which was built, as is faid, by Dunbar 

pf Tarbat, and is ftill pointed out, by the name of Dunbar's chapel. Of ano- 
ther, which was fituated on the more to the eaft of the old caftle of Tarbat,

Mifcellaneous 

* The fpring of the year I7 8z falls to be noticed for a fcarcity 0 f proven, 
der and the ruin of many families, both in the Highlands and W country, 
by the Iofs of their cattle, as the conference of that fcarcity. It was occa- 
fimed by a rainy and late harveft, and a long continued froft and fnow during 
the winter and part of the fpring, and at laft rofe to fuch a height, that in 
the working feafon, neither ftraw nor hay could be had for any money. This 
parilh fhared in the common calamity, and fome farmers were neceflltated to 
quit their farms and reduced to poverty. 

But thefe loffes were forgotten in the miferies that followed them in the 
year 1783, from the failure of the crop of the preceding year, and a real want 
of bread for the ufe of man. The want commenced early in the Highland 
parts of the country, and in January of that year (1783) many came down to 
this and other paridies of the low country, in fearch of provifions for their fa- 
milies; as the feafon advanced, their wants, and numbers increafed, and mul. 
tkudcs from the heights of both Rofs and Sutherland might be daily feen tra- 
verfing the different parifhes, fupplicating fupplies of meal or corn, in any 
quantity, for their money; and a pitiable cafe it was, to fee perfons young 
and otherwife vigorous, in this condition, having hunger and diftrefs of mind 
painted in their countenances. The price of corn rofe from 1 js. to 20s. and 
■zxs. and at length to 26s. 28s. and 30s. the boll. The late Admiral Sir John 
Rofs and lbme other gentlemen of property in the county, touched with the 
general diftrefs, ordered corn brought from other places to be given out amongft 
their people in fmall quantities, according to their families, to be paid when 
they fhould be in better condition. Upwards of 12,000 bolls were imported 
from the eaft country to Invernefs by means of MefTrs Falls of Dunbar and 
others, and fcattered over the different northern counties; and his Majefty's 
paternal care, and the attention of his miniflers, fhould be remembered with 
gratitude, in fending at different times cargoes of barley, peaie and flour 
to be diftributed amongd the indigent in feveral parifhes, at the difcretion of 
the minifters and elders. But for thofe fupplies, diforder and rapine would 
have prevailed, and the poor, rendered defperate by famine like fo many 
hungry wolves, would have broke loofe, and laid hands on whatever they could 
find. The aid of government, then afforded this parilh, amounted to 36 bolls, 
which were diftributed at different, times amongft houfeholders in (traits, to 
the number of 415, and proved a mod feafonable relief.

Mijcellvuom Obfervations.-Ttext are only two public hou- 
fes in the parilh, and thefe little frequented but by ftrangers. In- 
duftry is not confined to the work of the farmer without doors, 
but within alfo, the miftrefs of the houfe and the other females 
are employed in preparing webs from the wool and lint rai- 
fed on the farm, partly for family ufe, and partly for fale, and 
there is fcarce a houfe inhabited by the inferior daft of people, 
in which does not go on fpinning of hemp or flax, given out 
by perfons employed for the manufaftures of fail cloth and 
linen yarn eftablifhed at Cromarty and Invernefs. The ex- 
pence of fupporting a family has, within thefe forty years, rif- 
en to more than double what it was before that period. Meal 
of every kind draws nearly three times the money for which 
it could have been purchafed, and fifh has rifenin a ftill high- 
er proportion. A {hilling is paid for what till very lately could 
have been got for a penny. The increafe of the expence of 
clothing is ftill more confiderable, and more heavily felt by 
perfons in the middle and lower ranks of life, who, to appear 
decent, and comply with the fafhion of the times, muft have

This will be a memorable aera in the hiftory of this country, and it is al- 
ready marked by the people, in their calendar, with the epithet of the Black 
Year. One agreeable circumftance attended fo much mifery, that not a an- 
gle perfon died merely of famine, though difeafes followed, which cut off many, 
whofe conflitution had been enfeebled by what they fuffered at that period. 
The cafe was different during a fcarcity which prevailed in this country in 
the fummer of the year 1741. Many were then found dead on the highways 
and in the fields ; and others, through long failing, expired as foon as they taf- 
ted food. But the planting of potatoes in the field was not at that timeknowa 
in this country ; in place of importation, the rents paid in corn were a grcai 
part of them carried out of the country, till the mob put a flop to this* by 
breaking up a (loop laden with oat meal for Greenock ; and the calamity, how- 
ever heavily felt in this corner, was not fo general as to draw the notice of 
government or bring public aid.

The lands of the parifh hold of the crown. The diftnft to 
the eaft of Portmaholmack was of old called the foreft of the 
Earl of Rofs, and continues to pay L. 40 Scotch of crown 
rent; a fum which, though now a mere trifle, might, in thofe 
times when the boll of corn was converted at half a merk 
Scotch, be the real rent of a tract of ground which at prefent 
yields the proprietor near L. 400 fterling yearly. 

There are lands in" the parifh which held of the bifhop of 
Rofs and Abbot of Fearn. Some of the lands moft contigu- 
ous to the parifh of Fearn, are by the country people called by 
the name of the Abbeachd, i. e. Abbey lands, and it is proba- 
ble, made a part of the revenue with which the abbacy was 
endowed by its founder Ferchard Earl of Rofs. They are ftill 
aftricted to the mills of Fearn, and the people occupying 
them obliged to carry their corns thither to be grinded. One 
gentleman, Mr. Macleod of Geanies, lately bought off that 
vaffalage, and has erected mills on his own property, io ac- 
commodate himfelf and his people.

country, as they are already adopted by gentlemen of proper- 
ty and the more wealthy and knowing clafs of farmers.

Name, and Situation. 

*"TpHERE is no certain account, nor even any conjecture 
which has the lead appearance of probability, with re- 
gard to the origin of the name of this parifh. Part of the 

parifh of Longformacus interfefts it in the middle fo that one 
half, and indeed the largefl half of this diftri£l, lies at the dis- 
tance of 4 or 5 miles from the church. An inconvenience 
which attends many parifhes in this part of the country. 

Population. — There are only 164 inhabitants in the parifh, 
of whom 84 are males and 80 females. The population of 
this, and many of the neighbouring parifhes, has of late con- 
Cderably diminifhed. The only reafon that can be afligned 
for this diminution is the monopoly of farms. About 50 or 60 
years ago there were above 16 farmers in the parifh ; the whole 
is now in the pofleffion of 3 only. The return to Dr. Webfter 
in 1754 was 214 fouls. 

CJitnatt, 



of Cranjbaws. 437 

Climate, Rhm, fcrV.-The elevated fituation of the parifh, 
being in the middle of Lammermuir hills, renders the air 
flnrp and cold } it is however pure and healthy ; and during 
the fummer months the climate is tolerably mild and tempe- 
rate Though in all the different feafons there are frequent 
fogs, yet as they are generally confined to the tops of the hills, 
the health of the inhabitants is feldom injured by them • . 

The Whiteadder or Whitewater runs along the N. and E. 
fides of the parifh.-The river Dye alfo runs through part of 
this diftria. They are inconfiderable dreams, but abound 
with trout of an excellent quality. The banks of both were 
formerly covered with natural wood, which rendered the ap- 
pearance of the country in fummer moft delightfully romantic ; 
but now there is not a tree or even a fhrub to be found on them. 

There are no manufacturers of any kind in the parifh. Its 
inland fituation and great diftance from proper fuel, are un- 
favourable to their eftablifhment. The generality of the in- 
habitants are therefore employed in agriculture. There are 
2 mafons, 4 joiners, 2 weavers, 1 blackfmithv and 1 taylor, 
chiefly employed in working to the people of the parifh and 
neighbourhood, feldom manufaauring any articles, for fale. 
The inhabitants in general are frugal, fober and indubious, 
free from diffipation, and not addiaed to drinking, or any o- 
ther fpecies of intemperance. As a proof of their induftry and 
fobriety, it deferves to be mentioned that for more than 20 

years 

» There are few epidemical diftempers in this part of the country. The 
moft prevalent diforder is the rheumatifm, probably owing to the changeable- 
nefs of the weather, and the coldnefs and dampnefs of the houfes. Fevers 
are not frequent. And the ague, which prevails fo much among the common 
people in the lower parts of Berwickfhire, is almoft unknown here. The peo- 
ple in general live to a confiderable age. Among the fmall number of in- 
habitants this parifh contains, there arc at prefent 6 perfons above 70 years 
of age, two of whom are above 80.

years preceding r 7 88, there was only one perfon upon the 
poor's roll, and fince that time there have been only two on 
that lift. 



Agriculture.— As the grearefr. part of the parifh confifta of 
high hills, covered with heath or bent, the lands in general 
are more adapted to the breeding of cattle and fheep than the 
raifing of grain. There are, however, on all the different farms, 
a confiderable quantity of arable ground, which is very fer- 
vkeable to the tenants, as it fupplies their families with corn, 
and provides fodder for their cattle in winter. The foil, being 
light and dry, is fuitable for raifing of turnips and fowngrafs. 
Of late the farmers have availed themfelves of the advantages 
arifing from this kind of foil, and have already carried this 
fpecies of improvement to a confiderable height. Their prin- 
cipal dependance being on cattle and fheep, renders the cul- 
ture of turnips and fown grafs an object of great importance ; 
not only as being the beft food for thefe animals, but fome- 
times the only food that can be got for the fheep, for in fe- 
vere winters the fnow is commonly fo deep as to prevent their 
getting any nourifhment either from the grafs or heath. Be- 
fore the introduction of the turnip hufbandry, and the raifing 
of clover and rye-grafs, the farmers were frequently obliged 
in the winter feafon to drive their fheep into the low country, 
and purchafe hay for them. This was not only attended with 
great inconvenience and expence, but fometimesalfo with the 
lofs of a confiderable part of their flocks, owing to the difficul- 
ty of driving them through the deep fnow, and the weak and 
reduced condition in which the animals generally were before 
their owners had recourfe to this expedient. 

The introduction of the ufe of lime as a manure has been 
of great benefit to the arable grounds in the neighbourhood. 
Very confiderable crops of oats, barleyand peafe have by means 

thereof 



of Cran/haws. 439 

thereof been raifed from land which in its natural ftate was of 
little or no value. And it has not only the effea of occafion- 
jpg a more luxuriant and plentiful, but alfo a much earlier 
crop; a circumftance of great importance in a hilly country 
like this, where the harveft is commonly late, and the grain 
in danger of being injured by the froft before it comes to ma- 
turity. Another advantage refulting from it is, that it is pecu- 
liarly favourable to the growth of clover. Nay, in this cold cli- 
mate, it is abfolutely eflential to its vegetation. For it has been 
found by various trials, that even on the bed and moil fertile 
fpots in this part of the country, it is impoffible to raife this 
ufeful plant without the aid of lime ; whereas, by employing 
this manure, the worft of the arable land may be made to pro- 
duce it. And it is a circumftance worthy of obfervation, that 
fo great is the efficacy of lime for promoting its vegetation, 
that, by laying a quantity of it on the furface of the moft un- 
cultivated ground, it caufes white clover to fpring fponta- 
neoufly. This circumftance is the more remarkable, as there 
have been many accidental inftances of this effect of lime in 
the midft of the wildeft moors, by the breaking down or over- 
turning of the carts employed in carrying it : And that too, 
at fo great diftance from any other lands where this plant u- 
fually grows, as renders it difficult to account how the feed 
could have been conveyed ; and yet repeated experience has 
fliewn that lime laid on fuch land, whether by defign or acci- 
dent, has uniformly had the effecl: of deftroying the heath orbent, 
and occafioning the vegetation of white clover, in great abun- 
dance. 

It is proper, however, to obferve, that notwithftanding the 
tendency which lime has to meliorate the foil, yet a confidera- 
ble part of the arable ground in this and the neighbouring pa- 
rifhes has been much injured by the improper ufe of it, or ra- 



44° Statijiical Account 

ther by the injudicious management of the land after laying 
that ufeful manure upon it. For although, of all the calcareous 
manures, lime is unquestionably the beft, yet as it a£ls rather 
as a ftimulus than a fubftantial manure, and caufes the land to 
make its greateft exertions in the way of vegetation, it has a 
tendency to exhauft the foil, if not cropped with caution. 
When it was firft employed in the cultivation of the lands of 
this parifli, little attention was paid to this circumftance. The 
difficulty of driving lime at the diftance of 1 6 or 17 mile3 
through very bad roads, induced the farmers to take as many 
crops as the land would yield, to refund them for their expence 
and trouble. Andby thefe means'after taking eight or nine crops 
of oats fucceffively, it was commonly left in a ftate of total 
fterility, incapable of producing either grafs or corn. This 
pernicious practice is now in a great meafure laid afide ; and 
the generality of the farmers^difcover equal ikill and cautionboth 
in the mode of managing and cropping the lands which they 
improve with lime, and alfo in the means which they ufe for 
recovering what had formerly been impoverifhed by over-crop- 
ping. 

Horfes, Cattle, and Sheep.— There are about 30 horfes, 200 
black cattle, and 3500 fheep in the parifli. The horfes are all 
kept for the purpofes of hufbandry. There are few bred in the 
parifli, and none at all for fale. The cattle are but of a fmall 
kind ; are bred for fale, and bring from L. 4 : 10 to L. 5 .5 
a head when three years old. The fheep, which are of the 
fmall black faced kind, are fold lean after they are three years 
old. The average price for fome years pall is from 9 to 10 
guineas the fcore. The farmers feem to think that this kind of 
fheep is mod fuitable to the pafture, and have on that account 
made no attempts to improve the breed. They carry a coarfe

f In different parts of the parifh are traces of feveral antient encampments, 
though none of them appear to have been of any confidesable extent. They 
are fo much effaced, as to render it difficult to diftinguifh of what kind they have 
been.— Cranfhaws caftle, the property of Mr. Watfon of Saughton, is an ob- 
long fquare of 40 feet by 44- The walls are 45 feet high, and it has a battle- 
ment on the top. It is a very antient building, and before the union of the two 
kingdoms, had been ufed as a place of defence, to which the inhabitants of 
this part of the country were accuftomed to retreat, upon fudden incurfions of 
the Englifh borderers. There are in many of the neighbouring parilhes the 
remains and ruins of fimilar edifices, but this is the only one in this part of 
the country that is Hill entire. It has been lately repaired by its prefent pro- 
prietor, and is occupied by him as a dwelling houfe, when he vifits this part 
of his ellate.

meafc fize, each containing, as is fuppofed, many thoufand carts-load. A

As the planting and raifing of wood is of the greateft impor- 
tance to the country in general, fo it would in this and the 
neighbouring pariflies be particularly beneficial to landholders 
and tenants, not only as being the belt mode of employing 
wafte land, but likewife from the fhelter it could afford, if 
judicioufly laid out, in furrounding the valuable fields that are 
already, or may yet be, improved for raifing corn and hay. But 
the greateft advantage arifing from it would be the fhelter it 
would afford to the flocks of Iheep in winter. Many farmers 
in this part of the country have in one night loft a third, and 
fometimes near the half, of their fheep by a heavy fall of fnow. 
The efficacy of planting for preventing loffes of this kind is 
well known to all ftore farmers. The fhortnefs, however, of 
leafes in general gives little encouragement to the tenant to 
taife wood for this purpofe at his own expence, becaufe before 
he could derive much benefit from it, his leafe would expire. 
It may therefore be fuggefted as an object worthy the attention 
of proprietors in this part of the country, as they muft ultimate- 
ly be the gainers by an improvement of this kind, not only on 
account of its greatly inhancing the value of their farms, from 
the fecurity which it would affiled to the tenant for the fafety 
of his fheep in winter, but likewife from the value of the wood 
itfelf ; the foil, as appears from experiments that have already 
been made, being very favourable to the raifing of different kinds 
of timber.

intuitive clearnefs or abfolute certainty, we muft reft fa-

Celtic i the firft fylhble fignifying in that .language Ratifier 
with the touch, and the laft, a town*, It is highly probable, 
admitting this etymology, that the name has a ftriking allufion

the perfon, or the a£t of the aflembly. This ceremony was 
followed by that of the ratifying touch, or with a touch giving 

folidity or integrity to the public refolution Sanquhar was 

ere&amp;ed into a burgh of barony in 1484, prior to which period, 
it had been a burgh of the fame kind, from time immemorial. 
At the inftance of Robert Crichton, Lord of Sanquhar, it 
was ereaed into a royalty, in 1596, by King James VI. It 
Hands 27 miles diftant from Dumfries in the fouthern, and 
33 miles from Ayr in the weftern direaion, being both ways 
nearly equidiflant from the fea. It has only one principal 
ftreet, and is about i of a mile in length. It is governed by 
a provoft, a dean of Guild, three bailies, a treafurer, and ele- 
ven counfellors. The grofs revenue of the burgh, at prefent, 
fcarcely amounts to L. 50 per annum. It has indeed, befules, 
a commonty of confiderable extent, which, from its being in 
a rude uncultivated ftate, is worth only about L. 10 per annum. 

■ Sanquhar is apparently increafmg in population; but as 

no regifter has been kept, it is impofhble to afcertain with 
what degree of rapidity. Knitting of {lockings was formerly 
a confiderable branch of manufaaure in the burgh, by which 
a number of the lower clafs were decently fupported. To 
invigorate the fpirit of induftry, and to reward its exertions, 
the late patriotic Duke of Queenfberry, and the truftees for 
the encouragement of manufaaures, gave annually a premium 
of L. 40 each, to be divided in part to thofe employed in 
this branch in Sanquhar ; and in part, to thofe employed in a- 
ny other ufeful manufaaures within the bounds of the prefby- 
tery. But upon the breaking out of the American war, which^ 
for a time, fhut up the commercial intercourfe with this coun- 
try, this branch received a fatal blow, becaufe the (lockings ma- 
nufaaured here, were chiefly exported to Virginia. They

Extent, Surface, Soil, bV.-The'parifh ftretches from N. to S. 
about 15 miles, and from E. to W. about 9 or 10. Its figure is 
very irregular. It was originally of great extent, and was much 
enlarged, about the year 1730, by the annexation of a very con- 
fiderable part of Kirk-bride, which was fuppreffed about that 
period. It may, with propriety, be ftiled the eye of the coun- 
ty, from its (landing near the head of it, to which there is a 
gradual elevation from the fea, on the fouthern direaion, of 
almoft 3000 feet.— The general face of the parifh is extreme- 
ly rugged and uneven, and may be called an Highland coun- 
try. Within it is part of that high tra£fc, known by the name 
of the Lowthers or Lothiers, generally reckoned amongft the 
higheft land in Scotland. Thefe hills are bleak and barren 
on the furface, but contain immenfe riches in their bowels. 
Befides-thefe, more than one half of the parifh confifts of high 
hills, fome of which are green, others covered with heath. 
Some rife gradually from the bafe, others with uncommon 
boldnefs and majefty ; fome are of a conical, others of an el- 
liptic form. From their lummits in the fummer months, there 
is a profpe£t, that dazzles and overpowers the eye. The foil, 
at the foot of thefe hills, is partly mofs, and partly clay, but

lioar frofts, and are very pernicious to every kind of grain, bt« 
fore it comes to a proper confiftency. Were the climate, how- 
ever, anfwerable to the foil, there is no doubt, that excellent 
crops might be raifed in many places, which the hufbandman 
has never yet attempted to cultivate. The S. W. end of the 
parifh is of a light gravelifh foil, which in dry feafons pro- 
duces only a moderate crop, but with gentle ftiowers in April 
and May yields abundantly ; and has this advantage above eve- 
ry other part of the parilh, that the crop is earlier ripe, and 
earlier in the barn-yard. About the center of the parifh the 
foil isdeeper,particularly the holm land on thebanksof theNith, 
•which though it cannot be called a rich loam, produces excel- 
Itntcrops, with the affiftance of lime or dung. It is but of late years 
that the farmers generally began to ufe the former for the im- 
provement of their land, to which they feem to have been in- 
duced by obferving its good effects on the farms of fome indivi- 
duals, who had made the experiment before them. Reafoning 
may drive men to filence, but it is only the experience of a new 
and better fyftem of farming, that will lead them from the old. 
The lime ufed in this parilh is brought from Corfon Con, a hill 
which is the boundary betwixt this county and Ayrfhire, at 
thediftance of ioand 12 miles, and the price at the quarry is 3d. 
per Winchefter buftiel. A fingle horfe and cart generally brings 
12 or 14 bufhels, which is a fufficient load, as the road is 
in fome places fteep, and not in the bed repair. The land, in 
general, is much better adapted to the breeding and feeding 
of (beep and black cattle, than to raifing of grain. The grain 
commonly fown is oats, barley, or rather bear, fome few peafe 
and turnips. Rye-grafs feeds and clover are not fown, but on- 
ly upon fome fpots of the belt land around the burgh, and near 
the banks of the Nith. Potatoes are generally planted, and 
form a very confiderable part of the fubfiftence of the poor, 
there being but a very inconfiderahle part of the land under 

tillage,

tillage The whole grain raifed in the parifh is not fufEcient 
to iupply the inhabitants one half of the year, as there is not, 
at an average, more than 6co or 700 acres under the plough. 
There is an annual fupply of.meal imported fromDumfries mar-

P^/iw.-No regifter having been kept of the population 
of the parifh, muft render this part of the hiftory very 
defeftivef. The population in i 7 55 as returned to Dr. 
Webfter, was 1998 fouls. From an enumeration made by 
the prefent incumbent in 1786, there were found to be 2600,

• From the defcription already given of the extent and general face of the 
parifh, it is evident, that there muft be great diverfities of climate. This is fo 
much the cafe, that in winter, people in the E. and N. ends of the panlh are 
often diverting themfelves with the curling ftone, while the farmers m the 

fouth end and center are ploughing their land. Though this may feem to 

carry in it the air of romance, this is eafily difpelled by this fingle addition, 
that there is at leaft an elevation of looo feet from the center to the eaftern 
extremity of the parifh. Notwithstanding this diverfity of climate, there are 
no peculiar difeafes. The moft frequent are complaints in the ftomach, flow 
fevers, the rheumatifm, and nervous diforders. And thefe are more frequent 
in the burgh than in the country part of the parifh. Agues feldom appear. 
The fmall-pox formerly ufed to carry off great numbers of children, as well as 

Of adult perfons. But the prejudices of the people againft inoculation are now, 

in a gteat meafure, eradicated, and this mode begins generally to be adopted 

and as generally with fuccefs. 

f Soon after the ordination of the prefent incumbent, he defired the fchool • 
mafterto begin a regifter for births, and propofed, for his encouragement, ta 
colleft fixpence from every parent who came to obtain baptifm for a child. 
This beingjan innovation, the multitude difliked it, on account of the fixpence, 
and many refufed to regiftrate the names of their children for that reafon. But 
by perfevering, and pointing out the propriety of the plan, thofe of the efta- 
blilhed church now regiftrate univerfally. The feceders, however, do not in 
fert the names of their children in the public regifter.

buted principally to the fuccefs of the lead and coal mines, to 
pendicles of fans being fubfet by the tenants to fuch as are 
employed in leading coals to "Wadlock-head, and Leadhills, and 
to the infant eftablifhment of a carpet manufactory. The fuc- 
cefs attending theinoculationofchUdren,andtheimprovedmode 
oflivingand cleanlinefs among the people, are likewife among the 
caufesof theincreafed population. The annual average of births 
is 50, exclufive of the populous village of Wanlock-head (which 
contains about the third of the inhabitants of the parifh), and 
of the children of Seceders. The annual average of births in 
this village, and of Seceders, may at lead be calculated to be 20, 
making the fum total of births annually in the parifh 70. 

Heritor-Si Rent, tsfc. — The whole parifh (excepting fome 
fmall properties near the burgh) is divided betwixt the Duke 
of Queenlberry and Lord Elliock, the former having by far the 
greateft fhare. The total rental of the parifh, exclufive of the 
burgh, fome fpots of land about it, and what may arife from 
Wanlock-head mines, is about L. 2500 per annum. 

The number of fheep is computed to be 18000 or 20000 ; 
of horfes 170 ; and of black cattle 760.— The Ihort black-faced 
fheep, the oldrefidenters of this country, are found by experience 
belt fuited to this particular diftrict. Attempts have been 
made to introduce the white-faced long bodied fheep from the 
eaft country, and the Bakewell breed, but without fuccefs. 
The intelligent ftore-mafter faw" and lamented, that though he 
could introduce thefe kinds of fheep, he could not bring the 
foil and climate neceffary to make them thrive. The common 
fenfe of mankind admits this general principle, that it is con- 
trary to the nature of every tribe of animals, to bring them from 
a better to a worfe foil. And with refpect to the white- faced 
deep, in particular, the delicacy of their nature, the coarfe- 

nefs 



of Sanquhar. 449 

nefs of the pafture and the height of the walk are infuperable 
difficulties to their fucceeding, not merely in the opinion, 
but in the experience of the {tore-mafters. It may with pro- 
priety be added under this head, that the rains which are 
drawn out of the Atlantic, being formed into clouds, and dri- 
ven thus far by the W. and S. W. winds, are attrafted -and 
broken by the high hills in the parifh. And as thefe are the 
points from whence the moft frequent and the ftrongeft winds 
blow, fo, from the elevation of the hills, there are here more 
frequent and heavy rains than in that part of the country which 
lies more towards the eaft. Thefe heavy rains warn off part 
of the foil, and are injurious to (beep, in general, and parti- 
cularly to the white-faced fort, which are found from the tri- 
als that have been made, to pine away into a meagre, filly race, 
exciting the pity and difappointing the hopes of the ftore-maf- 
ter. And as the native flieep of thefe high lands are in general 
very healthy, and fatten on their natural pafture to 10 and 12, 
and even 14 lb. per quarter, it is not likely that any new ex- 
periments to change them for a different breed will haftily 
be made, as every experiment of this kind is attended with 
rifque. It is the general practice of the country to falve or 
fmear the fheep, which the ftore-mafters univerfally allow 
both improves the quality and increafes the quantity of the 
wool. It ferves to make the wool adhere more clofely to the 
body of the flieep, and fortifies them againft the pernicious 
influence of the ftorms of the winter. It ferves alfo as a de- 
fence againft the attacks of vermin. When this is ommitted, 
as it has been, by way of experiment, with a few flieep, in 
good condition and on the beft pafture, the animals indeed 
furvived, but the wool grew fo coarfe and fhaggy, that it 
might with more propriety be calledhair. The climate and K-ight 
of the walk feem to regulate the quantity of falve neceffary for 
the prefervation and defence of the fheep. It is applied in larger

to thofc in moft other places, where the land lies lower, bet- 
ter fheltcred, and the climate warmer. It was formerly an 
error of the ftore-mafters to overftock their farms. This now 
begins to be rectified, though in fome degree it {till 
prevails. It alfo begins to be the practice of fome of thefe 
mailers to wafh their fheep before (hearing •, but it is a pro- 
blem not yet folved, whether the additional price which they 
receive for wool made lighter by warning, will be equivalent 
or more than what they were accuftomed to receive for wool 
unwafhed and full of falve. The average prices of fheep may 
be! thus ftated. Three year old wedders fell from L. 1 1 to L. 12 
per fcore. Heavy ewes, which generally go off in the fpring to 
the vicinity of Edinburgh to be fattened for the market, from . 
L. 8 to L. 9 per fcore. And when they are kept to the latter 
end of the feafon ; viz. about Michaelmafs, from L. 6 to L. 7

* As the price of provifions, efpecially of grain, meal and potatoes, depends 
in a great meafure, upon the plenty and lcarcity of thefe articles, they are not

were L. a : ICS. fer a™,,*, and L. 3 was the maximum. The wages of female 
fervants about the fame period were L. I : 15s, and L. X : los. per annum. Now

Rivers, and Fi/hcries.— The Nirth bifeas the parifh from 
the upper to the lower extremity. It runs about 18 or 20 
miles before it reaches Sanquhar, takes various ferpentine di- 
reftions, and at laft empties itfelf into Solway firth. It ap- 
pears ill dry fummer weather only a fm all rivulet, but, when 
rains fall abundantly, it fwells into an objeft of grandeur and 
terror, and by the rapidity of its current furioufly tears up its 
banks, and fweeps them away. They who are fituated near 
this river often fuftain great injury from it, when in its majef- 
ty, and like an ufurper, it never reftores what it violently 
takes away. The Killo, Crawick, Yochin, Mennoch and 
Wanlock are rivulets of confiderable magnitude. The Nith 
abounds in falmon, though few of them reach fo high as San- 
quhar, owing to the many obftruaions they meet with by the 
way. All the rivulets yield very fine trout in the feafon, 
though not in great abundance, the Wanlock only excepted, 
in which no filh can live by reafon of the pernicious qualities 
of the lead ore, which is wafhed in it. There are four bridges 
in the parilh, one over the Nith, two over Mennoch, and one 
over Crawick.

with the influx of wealth, the improvement of land, and the introduction of 
manufactures, a principle which feems founded in reafon and equity, and if 
the influx of wealth depends in a great meafure on the improvements of land 
and the flouriftiing ftate of manufactures, there is here no juft proportion be- 
twixt the wages of fervants, and thefe two fources of wealth ; the former 
having rifen to an enormous pitch, while the latter are only in a ftate of in- 
fancy. Admitting the principle, however, on the ground of equity, that 
fervants wages ought to rife in proportion to the wealth of a country, the 
fame principle ought certainly to extend univerfally to all other defcriptions 
of men in the various departments of .life. This appears neceflary to the very 
exiftence and prefervation of civil fociety, that the various orders of men may 
not jufllc one atiother x but keep their proper ranks.

Poor, and Schools. — The poor naturally belonging to the pa- 
ri fli, who receive occafional fupplies, are not very numerous 
in proportion to the inhabitants. The number on the roll is 
35. There has as yet been no occafion for a legal afleflment 
to fupport them. They are maintained by the publk collec- 
tions at the church, by the intereft of a fmall fund faved out of 
the former contributions, by an annual gratuity from the Duke 
of Queenfberry, by money arifing from penalties, mort-cloths, 
&amp;c. The people willingly contribute to the relief of their 
own poor, and are by no means deficient in charity. But there 
is no particular diftricl: of the country more infefted than this 
with lhoals of foreign beggars. And as there is no certain 
criterion by which to diftinguifli the feeming from the real 
objea of charity, it often happens that thofe belonging to the 
former tribe, by fly addrefs, and by telling fome ftrange tale 
of woe, impofe upon the fimple, and obtain that which ought 
to be applied to the relief of the native poor, and having ob- 
tained it, riot in the fpoils, It would be worthy of the wifdom 
of thofe who fit at the helm, and direft the police of the coun- 
try, to adopt fome effedual regulations for the fuppreflion of 
this growing evil.— There is an eftabliflied public fchool in the 
town of Sanquhar, and, which is a Angular felicity, fumifh- 
ed with an excellent teacher, well qualified in every refpecT:, 
to inftrucl: the youth in the art of penmanfhip, arithmetic and 
all the neceffary branches of claffical education. The falary 
and other emoluments amount to about L. 40 per annum. 
Writing and arithmetic are taught at 2S. and Latin and Greek 
at 2s. 6d. per quarter. The character and abilities of the 
teacher render Sanquhar an eligible fpot for the education of 
thofe who" are deftined to fill the higher ranks of life. Be- 
fides the public, there is alfo in Sanquhar a private fchool, 
jn which reading, writing and arithmetic are taught, but 
4 has no fixed falary. There are at a medium, about 6ofcho- 

lars

lars at the public, and about 30 at the private fchool. There 
is likewife a fchool at Wanlock-head *. 

Eccleftajlical Stefr.-The church is remarkable for nothing 

but its, antiquity, fize, and difproportion. It is in a molt 

ruinous condition. There are no records, nor fo much as a- 
ny tradition when it was firft built. From feme ftones of 
Gothic architecture in the walls, it appears to be of remote an- 
tiquity. It is certain that it was a place for worfhip, in the 
times of Popery, as the choir is ftill entire. There is a figure 
of a man, as large as the life, near the entrance to it, cut out 
in ftone, which vulgar tradition calls the faint of the choir. 
The manfe was built about the year 1755. The Duke of 
Queenfberry is patron. The ftipend is L. 105 : 11 : 1/5 be- 

fides the glebe. The great extent of the parifli renders the 

charge very laborious for the minifter, and very inconvenient 
for a number of the people. There is an ordained clergyman 
who preaches and difpenfes the ordinances of religion to the 
miners of Wanlock-head. The people, in general, are of 
the eftablilhed religion. There are, however, a few Seceders 
of the Antiburgher profeflion in the parifli, and fewer ftill of 
the M'Millanites. The firft have a minifter and an houfe 
for worlhip in the town the laft have a minifter who preach- 
es occafionally in the fields near Wanlock-head.

tract of country. It is wrought in the Duke of Queenfberry's 
property. There is a fire or fteam engine lately erected on 
a new conftruction, for draining the mines, the invention of 
Mr. William Symington, a young man of great mechanical 
powers. For this engine, he has obtained a patent from go- 
vernment. This muft be of fingular advantage, as it will en- 
able the manager of the coal works to carry on his operations 
tc a greater extent, and will furnifh the community with the 
heft coals, which are found to lie deepeft. The ftrata in the 
barony of Sanquhar are 6 miles in length, on each fide of the 
Nith, and on a medium half a mile of breadth. The range of 
the coal feam is about N. W. and S. E. bounded on each fide 
by the common blue rock of the country. And when clear of 
fieps and dykes, which frequently occur at 30 ynrds diftance, 
dips one foot in twelve, to the N. E. by N. The whole of 
the coalieries belong to his Grace the Duke of Queefberry, 
excepting what are in the town commonty, and in fome fpots 
of land belonging to a few fmall heritors in Sanquhar and its 
vicinity. There are about 40 people employed in the works, 
and for any thing known to the contrary, they have'been wrought 
for centuries part, though not fuccefsfully as of late years. 
The rent to his Grace does not exceed L. 50 per annum, but 
as a confiderable quantity of coals are ufed in his mines, and ino- 
ther parts of his eftate, the tackfman is bound to fell them at 
2s. 1 id. per ton, on the coal-hill. There has not yet been 
difcoveTed more than two feams of workable coal, one a- 
bout 4 feet thick, the other 3 feet 8 inches. In fome pLces 
the laft feam has been wrought at the depth of 23 fathoms 
from the furface ; in others, not more than 14 yards, as the 
fame coal is thrown up by a large dyke, which ranges S. E. 
and N. W. in fome places 12, and in others 36 feet thick. 
It Hands nearly perpendicular, has always a great quantity of 
white fpar in it.; and lead ore has been found in cutting 

through 



of Sanquhar. 453 

through it. This dyke may be diftinctly traced at the furface 
for a mile in length. There are, indeed, dykes met with run- 
ning in different directions, through the coal ftrata, fome of 
which are evidently formed by fire, confifting moftly of vitri- 
fied matter. The fituation of the coal on each fide of thefe 
kinds of dykes, gives the ftrongeft reafon to believe that they 
are the production of fire, for wherever the coal comes in 
contact with them, it is fo much burnt and impregnated with 
fulphur, as to render it ufelefs. The other kinds of dykes 
that are met with appear to have been chafms formed in the 
ftrata, many of them of no inconfiderable width. They are 
filled with the fragments of the different ftrata in which thefe 
chafms form fections, and with a part of the furface on their 
fides falling in. Thefe fragments, &amp;c. are found to be ftrong- 
]y cemented or concreted by mineral fubftances, of which iron 
feems to be the principal. In lately cutting through one of 
thefe dykes, there was found among the cemented fragments 
of fand ftone, argillaceous rock, &amp;c. a part of a tree which, 
from its bark appeared to have been birch. The bark being 
broke, it was found, that it contained fand ftone. From a 
combination of circumftances there is reafon to believe, that 
in the long procefs of time, the wood being entirely confumed, 
while the bark was left, the water in the chafm had conveyed 
into it a filicious fand, which concreted in the fhape of the 
tree. In beds of ftratified matter which cover the coals, there 
are found various forts of fea fhells, and in fome of the ftrata 
vifible impreffions of vegetable bodies, among which it is not 
unfrequent to meet with fern and other curious productions ; 
fome of which have been felected, and are preferved in the ca- 
binets of naturalifts. In the mines have alfo been found 
fome fmall beds of fullers earth. Lime-ftone was unknown in the 
parifh, till very lately it has been difcovered on the fkirts of 
Auchentaggart hill. A fmall trial has been made of it where

it crops out, by which the ftratum of calcareous matter has 
been found, as yet, to be only about 3 feet thick, confifling 
of irregular mafles of exceeding fine lime-ftone, bedded in a 
mixture of argillaceous earth and {hells, in which the latter 
predominate. Many of the fliells are as entire as at the time 
when the fifli exifted in them. They are moftly of the cockle fpe- 
cies. The generality of the mafTes of lime-ftone found in this 
ftratum are of a whitifh colour, and of a very clofe texture. 
Upon the pavement of this ftratum, however, there fome- 
times occur pretty iarge mafles of blue lime-ftone, in plates of 
a circular form, on the furface of which are often found large 
cockles, perfedly diftina, and adhering firmly to the general 
mafs. Thefe plates of lime-ftone feem to be rounded by at- 
trition, as are alfo the angles of the whitifh coloured lime-ftone. 
The pavement of this calcareous ftratum is a blue argillaceous 
rock, and the incumbent ftratum forming its roof, is a coarfe 
free ftone about 3 feet thick, which forms the pavement of a 
coal feam of good quality, only 8 inches thick. In removing 
a part of an argillaceous bed which forms the roof of this coal, 
there was found petrified wood, which from its cortaneous 
appearance, much refembles broom. In the vicinity of this 
calcareous ftratum, is a feam of coal of a Angular kind, about 
40 inches thick, (coaliers, from its giving a bright light, call 
it a candle cod), of a clofs texture, which contains a confider- 
able quantity of fulphur and iron. When burnt in a common 
fir-, it produces a much greater quantity of afhes than com- 
mon coal, and the afhes are of a very red colour, refembhng 
the ochre of iron. When burnt in a furnace of confiderable 
fize the iron melts and runs through the grate in a fluid ftate 
combined with the fulphur, and forming a kind of regulus of 
iron. But the fulphureous fumes which iffue from it in molt 
furnaces are fo deftruOive to the workmen, as to render it, 
in manv cafes, of little confluence. 

Manufactures* 



of Sanquhar. 4$7 

ManufaBures.— Sanquhar feems naturally formed for the efta- 
blifhmentof woolen manufaftures} and nothing perhaps, would 
more immediately conduce to the internal wealth and profperity 
of this part of the kingdom. Nor is it unlikely, that the fpirit 
of commerce and manufactures, which now begins to per- 
vade the ifland, will in a fliort time difplay its lively and be- 
neficial effeds in this quarter. No fituation can be more hap- 
pily adopted for foftering a fpirit of this kind. Almoft in the 
very centre of a country, the ftaple commodities of which are 
Iheep and wool, touching the head of Galloway on the one 
hand, bordering on Airfhire, the head of Clydefdale, and con- 
tiguous to Annandale and Tweeddale on the other. There is 
abundance of coal and water, fo effential to the fpirit of ma- 
nufaftures; an eafy communication to Edinburgh, Dumfries 
and Ayr, by excellent roads, and the cheapeft land-carriage 
to thefe places, perhaps in Scotland, particularly from the 
two former, owing to the lead exported to the one, and coal 
to the other. There are two different branches of carpet ma- 
nufafture begun within thefe few years, and want nothing 
but men of property and public fpirit to carry them forward 
on a large fcale, for the benefit of this and'the furrounding 
counties. Thefe two branches are eftablifhed on the banks of 
Crawick, an unrivalled fituation, where there is plenty of wa- 
ter and defcent to drive weighty machinery, if neceffary, and 
in the clofe vicinity of coal. In one of thefe branches 5 wea- 
vers are employed, 2 draw boys, and a pirn winner, 2 wo- 
men twilling yarn, and one in what is called bobbining it, af- 
ter it is dyed. Thefe weavers throw off, in the courfe of one 
year, about 12,000 yards, the medium price of which is 2s. 
5d.per yard. Befides, this branch employs 8 weavers in town 
and country, for manufacturing of fluffs, ferges, plaidens, 
flannels, &amp;c. The, other branch employs nearly the fame 
'number of weavers, boys and women, and the yarn is manu-

factured in the fame manner. In the firft branch a very im- 
portant improvement is, of late, introduced j a carpet can 
be wrought confifting of 88 different parts, which is much 
more than can be done in moft other places in Scotland. 
What can tend more directly than manufactures to raife this 
country to fuch a pitch of elevation, as, at leaft, to keep fight 
of the fifter kingdom ? And to fee the genius, power and in- 
tereft of her native fans combine in a noble effort, muff warm

* The great road from Dumfries to- Ayr runs through the town of Sanqu- 
har. The late Duke of Queenfberry firft cut out this line of road through 
his eftate, for, at leaft, the fpace of %% miles, at the expence of L. 1500. 
He alfo cut out the crofs road from this along the Mennoch to the utmoft 
boundary of the country, that leads to Edinburgh, which coft L. 600. He 
likewife made the road leading to the lime rock at Corfoncon, which coft 
his Grace L. 300. Thefe, among many other inftances of his patriotic fpirit, 
endear his memory to this part of the country, and are ilhiftrious examples 
worthy the imitation of all great and good men. The road along Mennoch 
to Wanlock-head, being in a deep fequeftered glen, in many places cut out 
of the rock, the bold acclivity and verdure of the hills on each Me, the 
purling of the limpid ftream below, and the mufic of the birds from the- 
brulhwood, render it the admiration of ftrangers, beautifully romantic and. 
delightful to the traveller. The ftatute-labour was converted by aft of Par- 
liament at ias. per 100 merks in 1777. Toll-bars are now erefted on the 
road leading from Dumfries to Ayr, and its direction, in many places, has of late 
been altered evidently for the better, by which it is rendered more level and 
cafy for carriages of every defcription. There is no doubt of the expediency 
and utility of turpike roads, though people habituated to antient curtoms 
diflike every kind of innovation ; but by experience teaching them that a An- 
gle horfe can draw one third more to Dumfries than formeily, and with at 
leaft equal facility, they are not only reconciled to, but highly approve of them. 
There is a new line of road fuggefted, by a crofs cut through this country to 
the ftewartry of Khkudbright, and from thence to Galloway ; which, if car- 
ried into execution, would open a much fhorter and eafier communication 
from Ireland and that country to Edinburgh. The advantages of this are fm 
many aad obvious, as to fuperfede the neceflity of any fpceifcation. 



of Sanquhar. 459 

Mlfcellvuous Obfervations.—Tht people of Sanquhar enjoy 
a competent meature of the advantages of life. There is plen- 
of coal, of fine fprings of water, and of lime ; a fpecies of coarfe 
marble, and free ftone quarries, excellent for the purpofes of 
building ; a fair twice in the year, for buying and felling black 
cattle ; and a market for butcher meat, throughout the year. 
There is a poft office in Sanquhar, the annual revenue of which 
is about L. 112. There are 'a fulling, a corn, and two bar- 
ley mills intheparfh.-The chief difadvantage, perhaps, is 
the non refidence of the principal heritor. The whole parifh, 
except the tftate of Elliock, is naked and uninclofed. On 
Elliock is a fine natural wood, which fringes and adorns the 
banks of the Nith for two miles in length. The prefent 
refpeaable proprietor of that eftate, has alfo planted a good 
deal of various kinds of wood, Scotch larix, and filver,fir, 
New England pine, balm of Gilead fir, oak, elm, birch, 
beech, afh, mountain afh, &amp;c. all well inclofed, and in a thriv- 
ing condition. Inclofing of the arable land, would be of ge- 
neral advantage to the parifh, draining the wet grounds, and 
planting on the fkirts of the hills would both adorn and fhel- 
ter the country. — The language generally fpoken is a mixture 
of Scotch and Englifh, with lefs provincial peculiarity than in 
moft other counties in Scotland. The names of places feem 
almoft univerfally derived from the Gaelic ; Elliock fignifies a 
little rock, Auchentaggart, Frieft-field, &amp;c. &amp;c. 

No part of the country can afford better entertainment to the 
rportfman. There are abundance of groufe, partidges, and 
fome black game. The laft are more rarely to be met with 
than formerly, owing in part, perhaps, to the woods being 
cut, but chiefly to the devaftation of poachers, who favoured 
by a wide range of uninhabited country, load themfelves with 
booty, and frequently efcape with impunity. A covey, or ra-

few years ago, was difcovered upon the hills, which was con- 
fidered as a curiofity. The birds of prey, of fong and of the 
migratory fpecies are thofe which are abundantly common in 
the fouth of Scotland. The bull-finch is found in Elliock 
woods. The wild quadrupeds, befides hares, are otters, bad- 
gers, weazels, wild cats, pole-cats, and fome foxes; which 
laft, it is faid, are not fo numerous as formerly, owing to the 
induftrious exertions of the fheep farmers to exterminate this 
deftruclive race. There is only one chalybeate fpring known 
in the parifh, but its virtues have not yet been explored*. 

Mr. Robert Crichton of Elliock in this parifh, was a lawyer 
of eminence, Advocate to Queen Mary and King James VI. 
and a Lord of Seffion. lie had two fons called James and 

Robert. 



* The old caftle of Sanquhar, {landing a fmall diftance fouth of the burgh, 
once the refidence of the family of Crichton, deferves to be mentioned. It 
has been a building of confiderable magnitude and extent. — It is faid to have 
been for fome time in poffeflion of the Englifh in the reign of Edward ifr, 
and to have been recaptured by Sir William Douglas of Douglafdale, who put 
the garrifon to the fword. The whole barony belonged to the Crichtons, but 
the family of Queenfberry having a mortgage upon fome part of the eftate, 
purchafed this barony, in the latter end of the 16th or beginning of the 17th 
century. Prior to its being in poffeffion of the Crichtons, it belonged to the 
family of Rofs of Ryehill. A (lone was found fome time ago, with the fol- 
lowing infeription.— " Here lies the good Sir John Rofs of Ryehill— Here 
" lies the good, good Sir John Rofs.— Here alio lies the good, good, good 
" Sir John Rofs." Near the refidence of the Roffes, there feems to have 
been a large pile of building, perhaps the Hofpital of Senewar, a religious 
foundation, though this cannot be afcertaincd. Several of the ftones of a 
Gothic figure are built into the walls and windows of the houfes, where this 
edifice once flood. There is alfo a large font, or rock bafon. Human bones 
have been found in digging and ploughing up the field in which it (lands; and 
a key of enormous fize was found, not above twenty years ago, much 
conliimcd with raft. It is now loft. Betwixt the antient feat of the Roffes and 
the Nith, is a large artificial mound of earth of a circular form, probably 
the place for the baron to hear caufes, and to diftributc juftice.

Robert. The former went abroad when young, turned out 
a mod accomplished charader, both in learning and in all fort 
of exercifes, and was commonly known by the name of the Ad- 
mirable Crichton The fecond fen, Robert, was known by 

the name of Sir Robert Crichton of Cluny, an eftate his father 
had acquired in Perthfhire, and where he refided. In the 
year 1592 he fold Elliock to the family of Dalziel, afterwards 
Earls of Carnwath. The Hon. James Veitch, prefent proprie- 
tor of Elliock, is one of the fenators of the college of jufttce. 

The condition of the people, like that of others in paral- 
lel circumftances, may be called a middle ftate betwixt bar- 
fcarifm and refinement. They have arrived at a confiderablc 
degree of civilization, and poffefs the abilities of making ftill 
farther improvement. They are, with a few exceptions, 
which are to be found in every age and in every fociety, an in- 
duftrious, rational and religious fet of people, regular in at- 
tendance upon divine ordinances, and pay a proper regard to 
the duties of focial life. They are neither very rich, nor very 
poor, and poflfefs a competent {hare of the comforts, but no:i;: 
of the luxuries of life. It muft, indeed, be acknowledged 
that the frequent collifion of political influence in the burgh, 
is an enemy to their peace, and tends to relax every focial, mo- 
ral and religious obligation, and as thefe are relaxed, corrup- 
tion fpreads its baneful influence. No doubt, the fubftitution of 
dram inftead of ale-houfes, has the fame pernicious tendency. 
The almolt continual flux and reflux of vagrants through San- 
quhar, which is a thorough- fare for botlfendsof the kingdom, 
a£ts alfo as a flrong corrofive on the morals of the people. 
But upon the whole, their character is refpeclable, hofpitable 
to ftrangers, humane to the diltreffed, acTive in their ftation, 
decent in their apparel, and generally contented with the al- 
lotments of providence. Agriculture, and efpecially the paf- 
toral life, are favourable to that integrity and fnnplicy of man- 
ners which characterise them,

By the Rev. Mr. William Stuart.</head> 

<p>

Name, Extent, &amp;c. 

CUMBERNAULD is of Celtic derivation; ettmar an ait 
in that language fignifying a meeting of ftreams ; and 
there is a remarkable colkaion of fprings and ftreams, flow- 
ing in all diredions, part running into the Forth and part in- 
to the Clyde, within the bounds of this parifh, which extends 
7 miles in length, and 4 *n breadth. The furface has a ro- 
mantic appearance, being beautifully variegated by fmall hills 
and dales. The higheft part of the parifh is Fanny- fide- muir, 
a very deep mofs, bearing nothing but heath, well flocked 
with muir-fowl. On the fouth fide are two lochs, about a 
mile long, and a quarter of a mile broad. The remainder of 
the parifh is moftly arable ground, chiefly a heavy clay, though 
fomc farms are of a light early foil ; the climate is (harp and 
cold in the winter feafon, but in fummer it is generally toler- 
ably 



of Cumbernauld. 463 

ably agreeable, efpecially about the village of Cumbernauld, 
which lies in ahollow,almoft furrounded with the policy or plea- 
fure ground belonging to Cumbernauld houfe, a fine feat of 
Lord Elphinftone.— This parifh and that of Kirkintilloch for- 
merly conftituted one parilh, called Lenzie. 

Natural Productions.— There is abundance of coal in the 
north part of the parilh, but none of it is wrought at prefent : 
there is alfo a good deal of peats. Seven lime quarries are 
wrought in different parts of the parilh : Much of the lime is 
carried by the great canal to Glafgow and other places ; and 
there is abundance of whin, moor, and free ftone. The chief 
vegetable produftions are oats, aconfiderable quantity of bear, 
a few peafe and beans, a good deal of flax and potatoes, a 
fmall quantity of wheat, and a few turnips. 

Population, Eccleftsjlical State, &amp;c — According to Dr. Web- 
fter, the total number of inhabitants in this parilh in 1755 a- 
mounted to 2303, at prefent the number is reduced to about 
1600. There are about 56 births and 1 4 marriages in the year. 
The church was built in 1659, Lord Elphinftone is patron. 
In the parilh are two meeting houfes, one of that feci: of Sece- 
ders called Burghers, the other of the Antiburghers. There is a 
fchool-houfe and garden in Cumbernauld village, where above 
80 fcholars are annually educated. The funds for the main- 
tenance of the poor arife chiefly from weekly collections at the 
church doors. 

Mifcellaneous Observations. — The roads are kept in repair by 
alTeflment. A new turnpike road from Edinburgh to Glaf- 
gow was lately carried through this parilh, pafling by the vil- 
lage of Cumbernauld, near which a large commodious inn

was ercfted at the expence of L. 1000. Confiderable remains 
of the celebrated Roman wall, called Graham's Dyke, are to 
be feen in the north part of the parifh, as alfo veftiges of the 
military road running parallel to it. Many curious antiqui- 
ties have been found near them, particularly at Caftlecary ; 
and on the rock at Croyhill, the marks of fire are (till vifible, 
faid to have been applied by the Romans for the purpofe of 
foftening the ftone, which is exceflively hard. The great ca- 
nal betwixt the Forth and Clyde pafles through the north 
part of the parifh, near the dyke. In the neighbourhood of 
Caftlecary is a pretty high water fall.

{PRESBYTERY AND SYNOD OF ABERDEEN.) 

• \ 

By the Rev. Mr. William Sronach,</head> 


<p>
Name, Extent, &amp;c. 

THE antient name of this parifh was the Upper Parochin 
of Saint Machar. In fome regifters it is Upper Mac- 
har; and the modern name is New Machar. The name 

had its origin from St. Machar, to whom the cathedral in Old 
Aberdeen, or rather the kirk, called the kirk of Kirktown, 
where the cathedral was afterwards built, was dedicated, and 
this pariih was part of the Deanery of St. Machar. Ramfay 
Bifhop of Aberdeen, in 1247, appointed a chaplain and a clerk 
at the chapel of Monycabbuck in this parifh, about a mile S. 
W. from the piefent church, to preach to the parifhioners 
there. In the year 1639, a church was built, where the prefent 
now (lands; and in year 1641, the minifter at the chapel 
of Monycabbuck, was removed to it. There are fome remains 
of the chapei ; and the ground around it is ftiU ufed for bury- 
ing, The mod confiderable part of this parifh is in the 

county of Aberdeen ; but about one fifth of it, called the lands 
Vol. VI. . 3 N * Straloch a 



4^6 Statijllcal Account 

Straloch, lying N. from the church, is in the fhire of Banff, 
although furrounded by the county of Aberdeen. About a 
mile from the church, thefe lands are feparated from the 
reft of the parifh, by the parifhes of Udny and Fintray which 

meet together The extent of the parifh is about 9 miles in 

length, and about 2i in breadth ; part of it lies on each fide of 
the poft road leading from Aberdeen to Old Meldrum. 

The general appearance of the country is pretty flat. The 
foil varies in different parts. In fome places it is mofly, cold 
and wet, in others, dry, and tolerably fertile. 

Climate, Difeafes, bfc.—On account of the mofles, and a 
good deal of marfhy ground, the air is frequently moift, but 
does not feem to be unhealthy, from many infhnces of lon- 
gevity, as will afterwards appear.— This may probably be ac- 
counted for in the following manner. From the riling ground 
on the E. and "W. fides of the parifh, a ftrong current of air 
blows from N. to S. or from S. to N. which has the 
happy effect of difpelling the fogs and noxious vapours, which 
could not fail, were they not thus diflipated, to be pernicious 
to the health of the inhabitants. — The molt prevalent diftem- 
pers for fome years paft, have been putrid fevers and fore 
throats; owing in all probability to frequent rains, and the 
want of fnow during the winter, to purify the air. 

There are four mineral fprings. The water of forne of them 
upon experiment, has been found to be fa good quality. 
One of them is much ufed, and is found beneficial in fcor- 
butic complaints. 

There is a beautiful lake called Bifhop's Loch, antiently 
Loch Goull ; within it, the Bifhops of Aberdeen had their 
lodging, before the chantry was ere&amp;ed. Upon a rifing 
ground within the loch, the remains of the building are ft 111 
to be feen. At the weft end, is part of a ditch where the 

draw 



of New-Machar. 467 

draw-bridge was, by which they pafled to and from the lod- 
ging. It is faid that the lake was compafled about with 
tall trees, but none of them remain. The rifing ground where 
the lodging was, another piece of rifing ground in the E. end 
of the loch, and part of the circumjacent grounds are planted, 
by the proprietor, with thriving young trees. In the Loch is 
abundance of pike, but no other kind of fifti is found in it. 
— There is alfo a rivulet, which has its origin about a mile 
above the N. end of the parifh, runs through it fouthward ; 
affords as much water as fupplies 4 corn mills ; after which it 
falls into the river Don. There are feme trout in it, but of a 
fmall fize. 

Minerals, and Cattle.— There is a confiderable quantity of 
moor, and other (tones to be found near the furface of the 
ground, fit for building houfes, and for inclofing land, and 
they are in general obtained at a fmall expence. There are alfo 
{tones to be found by quarrying, but lime-ftone is very 
fcarce; and where it is found, the expence incurred by quarry- 
ing and burning is fo high, that they who have tried it, have 
given it up, becaufe they can purchafe lime at Aberdeen at a 
much cheaper rate *. 

There are fome cattle bred in this parifh of a good fize, 
beautiful fhape, and confiderable value. Of this defcription 
there are however comparatively few, being in pofiefiion of

* In the end of November and beginning of December laft» many of the 
country people obferved very uncommon phenomena in the air, (which they 
call dragons), of a red fiery colour, appearing in the N. and flying rapidly 
towards the E. from which they concluded, and their conjectures were right, 
a courfe of loud winds, and boiftcrous weather would follow. 

The quadrupeds, are fuch as are common to other parts of this country. 
Birds of the migratory kind, are the cuckow, rail, green plover, and fwallow. 
They generally make their appearance in the end of March, and retire ia 
the month of September.

Thefe gentlemen pay particular attention to this pleafing and 
advantageous object ; oxen reared by them, from 4 to 8 years' 
old, are fold at from L. 10 to L. 17 ; and when fattened will 
draw from the butcher from L. 18 to L. 25. The cows are 
alfo well formed, and fell at from L. 9 to L. 12 fterling. — As 
the greateft part of the poffeflions rented in this parifh are 
fmall, the tenants can neither afford to raife, nor fupport cattle 
of this defcription. — The high price at which veal fells in the 
Aberdeen market, and the conftant demand for that article, 
induces the country people to difpofe of their calves when 5 
or 6 weeks old, by which the breed of cattle is much injured, 
and very few more are raifed, than what are abfolutely necef- 
fary for the purpofes of agriculture.

poflefiions, and, a few tradefmen and day labourers except- 
ed, live by the plough. 

The vegetables produced in the parifh are natural and arti- 
ficial graffes, oats, barley, peafe, flax, turnips, potatoes, 

cabbages, kail, &amp;c. The parilh generally fupplies itfelf 

with provifions, and exports oats, barley, and a few cattle, 
lheep and hogs. There are not above 5 acres employed in 
raifing flax. But from the encouragement which the truftees 
are giving for raifing flax, and for building lint mills, it is to 
be hoped that this ufeful article will foon be more generally 

cultivated. For many years, the women in this, and fome 

other parifhes in this county, have been employed in knitting 
(lockings ; but from the invention of (locking looms, the price 
ofwomens work being much reduced, they have begun to direcT: 
their attention to fpinning, in which they will find their ac- 
count. 

Oats and peafe are fown in the month of March j barley in 

May,

May, with which the crop grafs is generally laid down after 
turnips or fallow; and turnips are fown, from the i ft to the 
20th of June. The hay crop is cut in July ; barley in the end 
of Auguft, and oats and peafe about the middle of September. 
— There are about 300 acres of wood, fome of it full grown, 
but the greateft part of it was planted within the laft 30 years 
and is very thriving. 

Advantages and Dif advantages, £sV. — It is an advantage to 
the parilh that it is fituated within the diftance of 10 miles 
from Aberdeen, where there is a conftant demand, ready mar- 
ket, and a reasonable price for every article which the farms 
produce. — As the brewers at Aberdeen, import a great deal 
of barley, the demand for that article, is by that means leflened. 
— The parifh hath the advantage of a good public road paf- 
iing through its center, which enables the inhabitants to bring 
coals, &amp;c. at a moderate expence from Aberdeen. It is alfo 
pretty well fupplied with mofs, which affords peats and turfs 
for fuel. On the other hand, it may be mentioned, that its 
vicinity to the large and populous city of Aberdeen, renders 
every article fold within the parifh, very high priced to thofe 
who muft buy ;] and that the country people are fo much in 
the way of attending the weekly market, that they generally 
lofe one day in the week, in order to difpofe of an article, 
which when fold, will lcarcely bring them is. 6d. never con-

The manfe was built in the year 1781. And a new church 
on a very good plan was erected in 1 79 r. 

The number of poor receiving alms is only 12 at prefent ; 
but it maybe obferved that in 1782 and 83, feafons of dearfh

families. They alfo received from government' 12 bolls of 

peafe, which were managed as above mentioned, and after 
that purchafed 23 bolls more at a moderate price, alfo fent by

Fuel— -The fuel commonly ufed is peat and turf, obtained 
from mofles, in general within its bounds. But the mofles are 
greatly exhaufted, and fome of the gentlemen burn coals in 
their houfes.— The expence of calling, drying, and leading 
peat and turf is very great, and confumes much of that time 
in fummer, which might be profitably employed on the farm. 

Were it not for the heavy duty afFeding coals brought 

coaft ways, which keeps the price of that article high, and is a 
great bar to manufaaures ; for coals commonly fell at 4s per 
boll at Aberdeen in fummer, and in winter at a higher price, 
the boll being 36 ftone Amfterdam weight ; it is generally 
believed, that families redding at fuch a diftance as ours from

Condition of 'the People— -The people are tolerably induftrious. 
And from the fpirit which prevails among the refiding heritors 
for improving their lands, it may reafonably be expected, that 
by their example, and by encouraging good tenants, they will 
excite a turn for induftry among their people. 

The parifliioners are not much inclined to a military life. 
Only 5 have enlifted ln the army, during the laft y years.-— 
Two have gone to a fea-faring life during the fame period. 

The circumftances of the people do not admit of their being 
expenfive or luxurious, nor do they feem to be fo inclined — 
Landed property has undergone fome changes during the 
prefent century, and has generally been fold at from 25 to 30 
years purchafe. — The people, though not in affluent circum- 
ftances, enjoy in a reafonable degree, the comforts and advan- 
tages of fociety, and feem contented with their fituation. 

It is not eafy to point out the beft means by which the con- 
dition of the people could be ameliorated, although it is evi- 
dent that many ftand in need of it. — The heavy duty payable 
on malt, is a great bar to their comfort, and has the unhap- 
py tendency of leading many in the lower ftations in life 
to the ufe of foreign fpirituous liquors, which are in ge- 
neral much adulcerated, and never fail to hurt both their 
health and morals. — The coal tax is alfo felt, and complained 
of by many, as a great addition to the price of that neceffary 
article. 

The attention which begins to be paid by gentlemen to the 
improvement of their eftates, their granting longer leafes to 
their tenants, under proper conditions and reftri&amp;ions, their 
emancipating them from that fervitude, under which they in

former times gioaned, and the f.itisfaaion of having their rents 
punctually paid, will all contribute to mutual comfort and ad- 
vantage, and finally, will diffufe a fpirit of induftry, infpire 
gratiude,— and give to the lower clafs a fort of independance 
natural to the creatures of God, and to free born citizens. 

Roads.— During the fummer, the roads are in good repair. 
But as the foil of which they are made, is in general of deep 
fpouting clay, they become very bad in winter, and the num- 
ber of carriages of all kinds which pafs along, break them 
much before they attain to a proper degree of firmnefs— The 
poft road leading from fouth to north, was originally formed 
by military, and is now kept in repair by means of the ftatute 
labour, exatted in kind, f . e. 3 days work of each man in fum- 
mer, from the age of 15 to 60 years, and 3 in autumn, but 
when they perform five days in fummer, it is accepted in full. 
—The Juftices of the peace within this diftrift who take the 
trouble of direding the bufmefs, appoint a proper overfeer to 
attend the labourers, who are called out to the work by an ad- 
vertifement read the preceding fabbath at the different church- 
es, by the precentor, immediately after divine fervice is con- 
cluded ; and the perfon thus appointed, is authorifed to ac- 
cept of 3d per day, as a compofition from thofe who do not 
attend -The money thus colleded from abfents, is applied to 
the payment of men, hired at 9 d per day, &amp;c. to work upon 
the roads.-By men thus employed, more work is peformed, 
and to much better purpofe than by the people who ought to do 
it who in general, are not fenfible of the great advantage of 
,ood roads, go to the labour with refinance, and perform it in 
an aukward and flovenly manner-There are no turnpikes; 
although it is thought they would be of advantage, yet it is 
doubtful if this part of the country could bear the expence.

M'fcellnncous Articles.— The farms of the heritors are inclof- 
ed. But the reft of the parifn (three farms excepted,) is o- 
p eri .__The people however, as they begin to have fpots in tur- 
nips and fown grafs, are led to fee the neceflity for, and bene- 
fit of, inclofures. 

There is a parochial fchool hard by the church ; the falary 
and perquifites of the fchoolmafter amount to about i $1 per 
.annum. The number of fcholars is in winter about 40, in 
fummer from 15 to 20. 

There are fix ale houfes, all clofe to the road between Aber- 
deen and Old Meldrum, frequented by carriers and travellers, 
but rarely vifited by the parifhioners.— A few years ago they 
frequently had malt feafts, i. e. the farmers from whom the 
country brewers bought their malt or barley, convened when 
the price of the malt became due, and fpent part of it very 
cheerfully, to encourage their cuftomers ; but this practice is 
now done away, .as they cannot afford to brew at home, and 
find it* cheaper to take their ale from the breweries at Aber- 
deen or Old Meldrum Thus the money fpent in this way 

among themfelves in a draught of comfortable ale, is frequent- 
ly laid out in the gin fhop at Aberdeen, when the people at- 
tend the weekly market. — But this is by no means the prac- 
tice of the generality, who are fober, temperate, and decent 
in their behaviour. — New and elegant houfes were built with- 
in the three laft years at Elriek and Straloch. — Thefe, with a 
few new farm houfes, are all the changes which have happen- 
ed in this way fmcc the year 1782. — The greateft part of the 
f.irms are managed by the families of the tenants, and a few 
hired fervants. 

Cottagers are employed by the refiding heritors, and a few 
of the principal tenants only. — Indeed it is difficult to find per- 
fons of this defcription as labourers within the parifTi, as in 
thofe feafons of the year, when they are moft in requeft, they 

are

are generally engaged in managing their little fpots of ground, 
providing fuel, &amp;c. — On this account fuch of the gentlemen, 
and even principal tenants, as have occafion for conftant labou- 
rers, make terms with them, when they let their fmall pofief- 
fions; and it may be obferved, that fuch labourers, under good 
matters, live more comfortably than the middling tenants do. 

The tenants in this parifli, and the under tenants, are bound 
to fome perfonal fervices — They are obliged to carry lime, 
fand, timber and flates, for building and repairing the church, 
manfe, minifter's offices, and the heritors houfes ; and it is 
but fair to remark, that with fuch difcretion have thefe prefta- 
tions been exacted, that although the buildings already men- 
tioned have been lately executed, the heritors have paid fo 
much regard to the intereft of their tenants, that, for their 
own houfes they have carried all the materials, and have paid 
a fum of money to the workmen engaged for the new church, 
to carry all the materials wanted.— In fome eftates in the pa- 
rifli, the tenants are bound to two or three days in the harveft, 
and fome days at calling and Jeading peats.— Some of the un- 
der tenants are bound in this way to the principal tackfmen. 

There is no pod-office within this parilh, the neareft to it 
are thofe at Aberdeen and Old-Meldrum ; the diftance from 
that at Aberdeen is 10 miles, from Old-Meldrum 8. The in- 
terior parts of the country, from this circumftance, labour un- 
der difadvantages.

(PRESBYTERY OF DUNBLANE, SYNOD OF PERTH AND 
STIRLING, COUNTY OF PERTH.) 

By the Rev. Mr. Christopher Tait.</head> 


<p>
Name, Extent, &amp;c. 

T7~ INCARDINE is of Gaelic originial, and faid by fome to 
fignify the head of the fhore, which countenances an 
opinion entertained by many, and fupported by feveral pre- 
fumptions, that the Carfe, upon the edge of which the church 
ftands, was antiently a continuation of the Firth of Forth. — 
The figure of the parifh is triangular. On the S. it is divided 
from the parifhes of St. Ninians, Gargunnock and Kippen, 
by the Forth ;— on the E. and N. it is feparated from Lecropt 

and Kilmadock, by the Teath. The extent of the parifh, 

from the confluence of thefe dreams, to the S. W. extremity 
on the fide of the Forth is reckoned to be 10 miles ; and from 
the fame point to the N. W. extremity on the fide of the 
Teath 1 2 miles. The weftern boundary, meafures about 7 
miles.- — A part of the parifh of Kilmadock, about three miles 
in breadth, interfeds this diftria about half a mile weft from 

the

Slatijlical Account 



the church, and cuts off about a mile from the weft end of 



it *. 



Kincardine is fituated in the wideft part of the valley called 
the Strath of Monteath, which is bounded in the N. and W. 
by a part of the Grampian mountains. Among thefe Ben- 
Lomond on the W. Ben- Lady on the N. W. Bcn-Vor- 
lich and Stoontachrone on the N. are the moft confpicuous. 
— On the S. the valley is bounded by a chain of hills, com- 
mencing near Bannockburn, and ftretching S. W. towards 
Dumbarton. On the. E. are the Ochills, which are feparated 
from the Grampian mountains, by Srath Allan, and from the 
S. hills by the carfe of Stirling, in which ftand the detached 
rocks of Abbey craig, Stirling capped with the caftle, and Craig 
Forth. Thefe altogether afford fuch a variety of ftrikipg ob- 
jects, fo well difpofed, as very rarely to be equalled. 

There has not been any meafurement made of the whole pa- 
rifh ; but it is computed to contain fomewhat more than 6000 
acres. The foil is diftinguifhed ordinarily into Carfe and dry- 
held.— The Carfe, containing about 4000 acres, lies along the 
Forth, and the dry- field, containing about 2000 acres, along 
the Teath. Only one half of the Carfe is arable, the re- 
mainder being covered by the mofles of Kincardine and Flan- 
ders. Its general appearance is that of a dead flat. And 

its foil is a rich blue clay, beyond any depth that has been 
examined, excepting one corner, where a bed of gravel rifes 
near the furface, as it approaches the Teath, and dips to- 
wards the Forth at the rate of one foot in the hundred. 

There are many thin beds of (hells, particularly of oyfters, at 
different depths in the Carfe, and one of confiderable thicknefs 
at the bridge of Goody, which is in that part of Kilmadock, that 

interfects

•tion, and for the' contiguous parts of the parilhes of Kilmadock and Port.

interfecls tins parifh. There are no (tones of any kind in 

the foil of the carfe, nor are there any appearances of rock, 
excepting in the eminences of Craig Forth, the hill of Dript, 
and the Nadd, and for a fmall extent of the bed of the river at 
the cruives of Craig Forth, and again at the bridge of Dript. 
The flatnefs of the Carfe, its being fo little above the level of 
the fca, the nature of the foil, which is fleech, become dry, 
intermixed with fea fhdls, together with the appearance of 
fome of its banks in this neighbourhood, confifting of fand, in 
which the marks of undulations are ftill evident wherever the 
furface is removed, render it highly probable, that the foil of 
the Carfe has been accumulated by the fea ; and that antiently 
the Firth of Forth has received the river twenty miles nearer its 
fource, than it now does. 

The dry-field rifes gently from the Carfe on one fide, and 

from the Teath on the other. The foil is a light loam. 

Many nodules of whin ftone, and fome few of plumbcake-ftone, 
are ftill found on the unimproved parts, and are a great ob- 
ftruclion to good tillage. In the improved grounds they have 
been blown with powder, at a confiderable expence, and re- 
moved. — The bottom is generally till. 

It is eftimated that more rain, by 6 inches yearly, falls here, 
than in the eaft coafts of Scotl md. On the other hand, there 
is lefs fnow, than in thofe countries. The heath on the mof3 
of Kincardine is fcarcely ever covered by fnow *. 

Rivers, 

* Rheumatifms prevail much among perfons of middle age, and flrangers 
are ftill more apt to be attacked with them than the natives. Slow fevers and 
fluxes are frequent in the end of autumn. They feem to be owing chiefly to 
the fuperabundancc of moifture, that proving often a very rainy feafon, and they 
are rendered more lingering, and more infectious, by great inattention to clean- 
linefs. 

I here arc no inftanccs of extraordinary longevity in the parifh; but there 
are feveral of perfons arriving at a good age. One of the prefent Elders is 85 ;

Rivers, and Fijljeries, The Goody, a fmall river, is 

the only one that has its courfe through the parifh. The Forth, 
before mentioned, is compafled of two ftreams, that unite a 
little way above the bridge of Aberfoil, and form the Avondow, 
or black river ; when it enters the parifh of Port, it takes the 
name of Forth, which is faid to be fynonimous with Avon. 

Th e Teath, is alfo compofed of two branches, which join 

near the village of Callander, and take the name of Teath. 

Although this name be loft upon its junction with the Forth, 
the Teath is a much more beautiful river than the other, and 
difcharges , double the quantity of water — The Forth and 
Goody are of a dark colour, with a muddy bottom ; the fifli 
in both are of the fame kind, viz. pike, perch and eel.— In 
the Teath are falmon, fea- trout, various fpecies of frefh wa- 
ter trouts, mufcles and a few perch—The falmon is the only 
fifti carried to market, and for fifhing which any rent is drawn, 
and even this is very trifling.— Their prices are regulated by 
thofe of Stirling market, which are very variable, but upon the 
whole, are fuppofed to be more than double of what they 
were i o years ago*.

* Pearls are fometimes found in the mufcles, but not in fuch numbers or 
fuch value, as to induce the proprietors of the water to e»ft a rent for 
the privilege of filhing them.— this circumftance has perhaps conned 
to p event the fiihing from becoming as valuable as |t j, capable of f t

The Forth ceafes to be navigable at the cruives of Craigforth, 
about 300 yards below its jun&amp;ion with the Teath, in confe- 
quence of a rock ftretching acrofs the channel, and a wall raifed 
upon it to prevent falmon from palling the cruives. Below 
them the tide rifes five feet at high fpring tides, but does not 
furmount the wall *. 

Population.— The population of this pariih has undergone 
confiderable variations in the courfe of this century, but, upon 

the whole, it has increafed confiderably It is faid to have 

increafed greatly from 1730 to 1750. From that period, to 
1772, it feems to have decreafed ; fmce the laft date it has ao 
quired more than it loft in the former periods. The increafe 
of population betwixt 173© and 1750 is attributed partly to the 
additions made to the villages of Thornhill and Norriestown 
and partly to increafing the number of the farms, by making 
new ones on the out-fields, or thofe parts of the farms that 
were too remote from the farm houfes for dung being carried 
to them, and which therefore formerly were alternately in lea, 
or under oats. — The decreafe from 1750 to 1772, is imputed 
to the demolition of feveral farm houfes and cottages, in con- 
fequence of 500 acres having been inclofed, and either kept in 
grafs, or in the natural pofleflion of the proprietor. The in- 
creafe of the third period, is owing partly to the additions made 
to the villages already mentioned ; but chiefly to the eftablifh- 
ment of the mofs tenants (or lairds as they are called) in the 
mofies of Kincardine and Flanders.

years of age to 60, that were not engaged in the rebellion 
their number amounted to 490. There was a garrifon kept 
by the rebels in Down caftle, which is feparated from this 
parifh only by the river Teath. This circumftance renders it 
probable that the 50th man, or 10 in whole, would be engag- 
ed in the rebellion, confequently, that the number of men 
then in the parifh, above and below 60 years of age, was 500, 
and that the number of fouls was 2000. The return to Dr, 
Webfter in 1755, however, was only i250.—-The number at 
prefent is 2068.

A reafon, that may be affigned for the number of marriages 
not increafing of late, in proportion to the fuppofed increafe of 
population, is, that the great part of the mofs_tenant3 were 
married before they fottled in this parifh.

The number of burials, at an average of feven years, is 1 2 
yearly.- The number of heritors is 22 ; of thefe 9 refide. 

Norriestown and Thornhill are the only villages in the pa* 
rifh j they are now joined, and (land along the fummit of a rifing 
ground, on both fides of the road from Stirling to the fort of 
Innerfnaid. The inhabitants of both amount to 626. The 
greater part of thefe, and a few cottagers in other parts 

of the parifh, are labourers or handycraftsmen. Tanning 

is the only trade of any confequence carried on in Thornhill ; 
it does not employ above 20 hands. — There are alfo a few of 
the parifhioners employed at the Adelphi cotton work, which 
lies in that part of Kilmadock that interfe&amp;s this parifh, and 
employs about 900 people. At this work, it is faid, the fineft 

cotton yarn made in Scotland is fpun. There are 66 

tenants, and 126 mofs tenants within the parifh.*. 

Ecclejiajiical State, &amp;c— There are two clergymen, viz. the 
minifter of the parifh, and the minifter of the Chapel of Eafe 
at Norriestown. 

The ftipend of the former is L.45 in money, 16 bolls of bear, 

and 64 of meal. The glebe confifts of 5-* acres The fund 

for the maintenance of the minifter of the Chapel of Eafe was 
formed partly of contributions by the people of the diftri£t,

* The number of ftudents, particularly in divinity, was formerly very con- 
fiderable. About 1 8 years ago there were 18 clergymen (including every de • 
nomination) who were natives of this parifli. They are now reduced to 4; 

and there are only two ftudents. The great increafe of the expence of e- 

ducation, and the emoluments in that profeflion being nearly ftationary, while, 
. in^almoft every other line of life, they are encreafing with aftonilhing rapi- 
dity, are evidently the caufes of this alteration. — A cotton fpinner, in the fe- 
cond year after leaving the plough, gains annually a fum equal to the average 
of the ftipends of the church of Scotland, which are the recompence held forth 
for an expenfive education of fifteen years at leaft, and for many more perhaps 
of expectation.

for whofe benefit it was ere&amp;ed, and partly of collections made 
in five fynods by the authority of the General Aflembly 1730. 
This fund is under the management of the prefbytery of 
Dunblane, who are fubjeft to the controul of the General Af- 
fembly. Part of the money was applied to purchafe lands in 
the neighbourhood, and a part of thefe, rented formerly at 
L. 8 : 6 : 8 is appropriated for a glebe, and a houfe was built 
upon- it in 1774. The prefent ftipend is L. 30 fterling and 40 

bolls of meal or bear The King has prefented the prefent 

minifter of the parifh and his two immediate predeceflbrs ; but 
the patronage is fuppofed to be in the number of thofe given 
to Mr Drummond, the reprefentative of the family of Perth, 
by the late aft of Parliament for reftoring the forfeited eftates. 
By an aft of the minifters and heritors of thofe parifhes, 
from which the congregation at the chapel is formed, dated 
1750, confirmed by the prefbytery of Dunblane and the Ge- 
neral Aflembly, the chaplain at Norriestown was declared to 
be affiftant to the minifter of Kincardine, who had alfo the 
power of nomination to the office given him, which was exer- 
cifed until 177?. The General Aflembly of that year, upon 
a petition of the congregation, allowed the vacancy, that had 
then taken place, to be fupplied by the majority of the exam- 
inable perfons. The laft vacancy was fupplied in the fame 
manner, with the confent of the minifter of Kincardine. 

About a third of the parifhioners are feparatifts of different 
denominations ; the Burgher Seceders are the moft numerous 
qlafs ; it prevails much on the S. E. point of the parifh, that 
being in the neighbourhood of Stirling, where that feft have 
had their moft numerous congregation ; Ebenezer Erflcine 
being one of the minifters of that town at the commencement 
of the Seceflion. The Antiburgher Seceders, and adher- 
ents of the Prefbytery of Relief are next to them in number. 

There

There are a few Cameronians and fome Epifcopalians, and alfo 
4 families of Roman Catholics who came lately from the High- 
lands . _The people of this parifh are regular in perform- 
ing all the external duties of religion, and are in general fober, 
indubious, and frugal. Among feveral of them, however, 
the efFeas of the diftillery of malt fpirits, that was carried on 
'to a great extent in Thornhill, before the a£t reftrifting it to 
ftills of a very large capacity was parted, are ftill difcernible, 
in that want of veracity, and of refpeft for the law, that pro- 
penfity to intemperance, to fraud and pilfering, which the fu- 
perabundance of fpirituous liquors, and the habits of defraud- 
ing Government have fo ftrong a tendency to produce. 

The prefent law refpeding the diftillery, by eftabliftung a com- 
pofition for the excife duties, has, however, very wifely re- 
moved the temptations to fraud. 

The total annual amount of the emoluments of the parifh 
fchoolmafter does not (exclufive of a houfe and garden) exceed 
L. 25 fterling.— There are befides five private fchools, which 
in winter are well attended, but in fummer almoft deferted, 
the children being then engaged in keeping cows and other ru- 
ral employments. The number of fcholars attending them 
in winter exceeds 300 *. 

Poor. — In 1775, in confequence of an act of quarter fef- 
fions of the country for reftraining the poor from begging, 
and obliging their refpe£live parifhes to maintain them, this 
parilh, with a few others in the neighbourhood, affefled them- 
felves for the maintenance of the poor, who had formerly 

been

commodation of travellers, or of people on bufinefs ; efpecially when the inn-

time to time, fince that period. But at the laft meeting of 

the heritors and the kirk-feflion, it was carried to drop the plan, 
■whenever the money already levied fhould be exhaufted, which 
it will in a few weeks. — The firft and higheft afleflment was 

1 1 s. 6d. upon each hundred pound of valued rent. The 

number of poor upon the roll in 1775 was 12, it has now de- 
creafed to 3. — The weekly allowance varies from 6d. to is. 8d. 
for each perfon. The feflions funds (including the propor- 
tion of the collections at the chapel ordinarily given to the 
poor of this parifh) amount to L. 24 yearly *. 

Language, 

* It will I believe appear lingular, that a poor's rate has been eftablifhed in 
a pariflvand given up without occafioning much complaint or much hardfhip 
to the poor. It has been done perhaps a little prematurely ; but things were 
in fuch a train, that a fliort time longer might have made them ripe for it. 

As whatever tends to diminifli the number of perfons dependent upon pub- 
lic charity, promotes the profperity of the country, fobriety, and, of courfe,do- 
meftic comfort, among the labouring poor, 1 (hall mention what I think the 
caufes of fuch an uncommon occurrence. 

It is no doubt partly owing to the conflant employment and higher wages 
that are given to handy craftfmen and labourers ; but thefe circumflances, un- 
lefs combined with other caufes, might perhaps have produced an oppofite ef- 
fect 

Lefs money, it has been obferved, is faved in general by thofe whofe revenue 
is certain and unvariable, than by perfons whofe gains are uncertain : And 
high prices of labour, if proper attention be not paid to the management of 
the poor, has frequently the effecT: of heightening the poor's rates. 

The labourer and mechanic, if certain of conftant employment, when in 
health and vigour, and fecure of being fupported by the parifh in ficknefs or 
old age, is but too apt toaccuftom himfelfto a mode of living correfpondent to 
his wages, and when he needs fupply from the parifh, he expefts it to be ade- 
quate to the habits of expence he has acquired, and is clamorous if he is dif- 
appointcd ; and the lefs defervinghe is of favour, the more clamorous he is.— 
Tins is evidently one caufe of the height of the poor's rates, where they have 

been

Language-— The Scotch language is fpoken ordinarily. 
But as for many years paft, a confiderable proportion of 
the fervants here have been natives of the highlands, and 
oflate above a hundred families from thefe countries have 

fettled 

been long eftabliflied. — They being almoft uniformly high where the price of 
labour is high. 

While therefore the more regular employment and the higher wages, that 
are now given to labourers and handycraftfmen, are jufUy confidered as the 
principal caufes of the diminution of the poor ; I hazard the opinion, that the 
falutary efleft of thefe was owing greatly to the mode of managing their poor 
adopted by this parifh. 

When it was determined that the poor lhould be retrained from begging, 
this parifh very wifely refblved to preferve the diftinttion betwixt thofe who 
had begged, and thofe who had lived at home, and received fupply from the 
feffion ; thefe laft being in general induftrious, and free from the vices that 
prevail too often among the begging poor. 

The begging poor alone were put on the parifh fund, and previous to this 
being done they were obliged to give an afEgnation of all their effects to the. 
parifh. 

The intention of this affignation was, not only to prevent any from pre- 
tending poverty, but alfo to put it in the power of the managers to regulate 
the funeral expences of fuch of the poor as died. 

People of that rank have their pride and their prejudices, as well as their 
fuperiors, and it was wifely determined to make ufe of thefe on that oceafion, 
and to affix fuch a degree of difcredit upon thofe maintained from the poor's 
rate, as to prevent, as much as poffible. the eftablifhment of it operating as ait 
encouragement of idlenefs, or a want of oeconomy. 

The wifdom of this management has appeared in its effects. The averfion. 
of the poor to a funeral, from which any part of the ufual expence has been 
retrenched, has prevented feveral perfons from claiming to be put upon the 
roll. — The defire of what is called a decent funeral, i. e. one to which all the 
inhabitants of the diftrift are invited, and at which eveiy part of the ufual en- 
tertainment is given, is one of the (trongcft in that rank of" people. The ex-, 
pence of it amounts nearly to 51. This fum therefore every perfon in mean 
circnm (Varices is anxious to lay up, and he will not fpare it unlefs reduced to

fettled in the parifh, principally in the mofs. The Gaelic is 
the only language fpoken by fome of the inhabitants, and ma- 
ny more of them underftand it better than the Scotch. 

The names of places are partly of Gaelic original, as Tol- 
garth, Garihocby Arrive, and partly of Scotch, as Bankhead 
Weftwood *. 

Roads, Bridges. — Great part of the, public roads have been 
made anew, and bridges built where wanted, within the laft 20 
years. 

The bridge of Dript over the Forth, on the road to Stir- 
ling, is the only confiderable one. It was built by fubfcrip- 
tion.— The other bridges, as alfo the roads, were executed by 
the ftatute labour, or by allowance from the county fund for 
roads and bridges — Both are now in pretty good condition ; 
therefore, although the quantity of carriage upon them is in- 
creafed beyond all cbmparifon, there is good reafon to conclude, 
that the ftatute labour, efpecially if compounded for at an a- 
dequate price, will be fufficient to keep them in repair. 

' It does not appear that turnpikes would apply well to the 
roads of this parifh ; for if lime for manure was exempted from 
toll, the expence of colleftions would amount to a confidera- 
ble fhare of the fum levied. 

At 

The feffion generally allow this fum for the funeral of fuch of the poor as 
have been maintained from their fund, if the value of the effects of the deceaf- 
cd do not fall very much fhort of it. And the defire of fecuring th.s has in- 
duced fome, who had a large fhare of the vices of the begging poor, and who 
might otherwife have been clamorous for a high allowance from the parifh, to 
reft fatisfied with fuch occafional fupply as the feffion thought fit to give 
them.

At any rate, as there is no great thoroughfare, that expence 
muft be paid principally by this and the two adjoining parishes j 
confequently, if the ftatute labour {hall be found inadequate 
to the fupport of the roads, it will be wife in thefe parifhes to 
aflefs themfelves, in proportion to their rsfpeftive interefts, in 
whatever fums may be required further for this purpofe. 

The mod obvious difadvantage under which this parifh, and 
particularly the carfepart of it, labours, is the difficulty of com- 
munication with the neighbouring country. 

This is owing, on the one fide, to the mofles, and on the o* 
ther to the want of fords in the rivers that abound in the parifli, 
and the paucity of bridges over them. Another difadvantage 
is, that there is no public, worfhip, nor religious inftru&amp;ion in 
the Gaelic language, within the reach of thofe Highlanders, 
that, to the number of 90 families, have lately fettled in the 
mofs of Kincardine, feveral of whom have not fuch a know- 
ledge of the Englifh as to be able to underftand either prayers 
or fermons in it. 

The Society for propagating Chriftian Knowledge was efta- 
blifhed, principally, for communicating religious inftruction to* 
the Scotch highlanders, and L.iooo is given annually by his 
Majefty for the fame purpofe, which is under the management 
of the General AfTembly. The people of this parifli, however, 
have hitherto received no benefit from either of thefe funds, as 
an opinion prevails that, both by the rules of the Society, and 
the terms of the donation, the advantages of them are redac- 
ted to thofe perfons fpeaking the Gaelic language, who conti- 
nue to refide in the Highlands *.

Alterations.— It is the opinion of the rnoft intelligent per- 
fons of all ranks, that the population of this part of the coun- 
try has increafed greatly in the fpace of the laft 30 years. And 
that it is unqueftionable that during the laft 25 years the coun- 
try in general, and this pariftl in particular, have made a great 
progrefs in wealth, in agriculture, and thoft improvements con- 
nected with it. 

The rent is increafed at lead one half, and the value of land 
is nearly double.— One tenant beftows as much in manure 
for his farm as three did at that time, and horfes and im- 
plements of hufbandry are become far more valuable. A 

that time there were only two bridges over the Forth, viz. one 
at Stirling, and another at Aberfoyle, now three more are 

built 

It may be a difficult matter toeffetfuate an alteration of the rnles of the So- 
ciety but furely there « reafon to hope, that the great change in the c.rcum

built hetwixt thefe.— Then there was only one bridge over the 
Forth, viz. at Down ; three have been built fince that period. 
—During that fpace alio the greater part of the public roads 
have received a better diredion, and are well made, and brid- 
ges have been built over the rivulets. 

Extenfive plantations have alfo been made, and one half of 
the parilh inciofed. -Before the period above mentioned, the 
greater part of the farm houfes were miferable huts built of 
fod, few of the holes called windows had a bit of glafs in 
them; and commonly there was no other partition in the 
houfe than that formed by two beds fetacrofs it, foas to leave 
a paflage betwixt, upon which there was generally a door.— 
Now above three fourths of the houfes in the eaft end of the 
purifh are rebuilt fubftantially of ftone or brick. All have 
glazed windows, fome are covered with blue flates, and the 
offices with tile The houfes of one half of the mofs te- 
nants are at preterit in a better ftate than thofe of the moft 
fubftantial farmers, excepting half a dozen, were formerly — 
There is alfo fome improvement upon the mode of living of e-

j Q_2 Improvements. 

* The courfe of the Forth above Stirling wag fun-eyed, with the view of 
connc&amp;ing it with the Clyde. When the preference was given to the canal 
now executed at the mouth of the Carron, a fcheme was formed for making 
the Forth navigable, as far as the bridge of Qartmore, by veflels drawing on- 
ly 3 * feet of water, for tranfporting, for the ufe of the country upon its banks, 
lime from Lord Elgin's kilns, and Aberfoil, and coals from the fide of Devon, 

where a canal was to be made. The diftance from the mouth of the Forth 

to the bridge is %-j miles, if meafured in a ftraight line, and 49 by the courfe 
•f the river. The tide flows to the cruives of Craigforth, diftant from the 

mouth

Improvements . — The mofles of Kincardine and Flanders, 
which cover more than 2©oo acres of the Carfe ground in this 
parifh, are in a fituation fimilar to that of the mofles of Froflc and 
Dunmore, betwixt the Forth and Carron, They are alfo evi- 
' \ dently 

mouth of the river, 7 miles meafuring in a fhaight line, and 16 by the win- 
dings of its channel. VefTels drawing nine feet water may in the drieft. 

feafons navigate the river, in neap tides, as far as Manour, or half the diftanee 
to Craigforth. Betwix: thofe two places there are fome mallows, over which 
veflels, drawing more than five feet water, cannot pais at neap tides, when 

the water was low. At the bottom of the ftrcam, below the bridge of 

Gartmore, the furface of the river, when in its loweft ftate, is nearly 30 feet 
higher than that below Craigforth in neap tides. The difference is in ge- 
neral much lefs, and efpecially where there is any frefh in the river. The 
common depth of the rivers is from 8 to 10 feet, but there are mallows in feve- 
ral parts of it, upon fonie of which there are at times only two feet of water. — 
From the termination of the tide-way at Criagforth, to the bottom of the 
Itream below the bridge of Gartmore, there are only three falls perceptible in 
the river : One of 8 feet at Craigforth ; another of 3 feet, at the ford of 
Frew; the third of %\ feet, at the bridge of Cardrofs.— It was propofed to 
ereft two locks, at Kildean below Craigforth, each fix feet in height ; to. 
make a canal, acrofs a peninfula, from that place to the fouthwclt point 
of Craigforth hill, and to raife a dam there, four feet in height, acrofs 
the channel of the river, which it was fuppofed would raife the furface of it 
nearly that height, as far as the ford of Frew. A dam five feet high erec- 
ted below the mouth of the Goody, which is below the Frew, it was fuppofed, 
would make that river navigable 4 miles above Thonihill, and give dead water 
in the Forth, near to the head of the ford at Cardrofs.— Another dam and 
lock of the fame height at that ford, it was fuppofed would give a fuflicicnt 
depth of water near to the bridge at Gartmore, and; when there was any 
frefh in the river, would allow veffels to pafs into the dead water above the 
bridge. 

The expence of making this navigation in the Forth, from Kildean to 
the bridge of Gartmore, and in the Goody, 4 miles above Thornhill, was cfti- 
mated at L.5830 exclufive of the price of nine and a half acres of ground re- 
quired for the canal at Kildean, and the temporary damage that would U 
fuftained by as much more ground. 

As the principal obftru£tions to the execution of this plan arc greatly iV 
minimed, or n? longer exift, it is to be hoped that it will be refumed.

dently of the fame nature, and have had the fame origin . 

Kincardine mofs is wholly in this parifh. About 25 years a- 
go, it confided of 1800 acres. Flanders mofs is more than 
three times that extent. Part is in this parifh, and part in the 
parifhes of Kilmadock, Kippen, and Port.— The mofles are 
evidently fuperinduced over the foil of the Carfe ; being fo 
much above it as their own thicknefs; they are therefore not 
liable to be flooded by water, and, as there is only one fpring 
difcovered in them, the wetnefs is owing wholly to the quali- 
ties of the mofs or bog-earth. — —All thefe have been confi- 
dered as capable of improvement, but any progrefs made in 
reclaiming them was fo flow, that a perfon of great property 
has, within thefe laft 20 years, exprefled frequently his wifh, 

that the firft, at leaft, had rather been a piece of water. 

They are now, however, in higher eftimation, in confequence 
of the improvements that have been made, particularly 
on that of Kincardine — —There were different methods in 
ufe formerly for improving the mofs, which in general were 
confined to the fpread-field, that is, the wafte mofs, which 
being unfit for peat, had been call behind the peat cutters, and 
its furface being fmoothed, and drains cut in it, the peats 

. were laid upon it to be dried. It was already drained fo far 

as to bear cattle in dry weather. Some perfons ploughed, and 
when it became dry, fet fire to it. By repeating this opera- 
tion, as often as their convenience or the feafon permitted, 
fuch a quantity of afhes was procured, as being incorporated 

with the remaining bog-earth, produced a coarfe grafs. 

"Where the mofs was thin, it was fometimes confumed fo far 
by this operation, that the plough might reach the clay, in 

this cafe the mofs was faid to be gained, i. e. made arable. 

Where the mofs was too thick to be gained by ploughing and 
burning, it was a common practice to carry part to the con- 
. t'guous ground, which, being exhaufted by producing feveral 

crops 



494 Statijlical Account 

crops of oats in fucceflion, and at a diftance from the dunghill, 
the only manure almoft then ufed, was lying wafte, or cover- 
ed very thinly with grafs, its natural produce. Here it was 
dried and burnt ; and the afhes being ploughed in, the ground 
was cropped with oats, until it would produce no more. — 
A third method of reclaiming the mofs was to dig ditches, or 
goats, as they are called, at fuch diftances, and of fuch depths, 
that the clay dug from them was fufhcient to cover the inter- 
mediate fpaces of mofs to the depth defired.— The clay, when 
dug, was thrown at fuch diftances from the ditch, that fo 
much mofs was left on each fide of it uncovered, as was 
thought fumcient to fill it again to a level with the bottom of 
the ftratum of clay laid upon the furface. The firft of thefe 
methods required only a little labour of the farmer and his 
cattle, at a time, when by the mode of hufbandry then praftifed, 
there was little other employment for them.— The returns it 
produced were proportionably trifling, unlefs where the mofs 
was fo (hallow as to be nearly confumed by this operation.— 
The fecond method required more labour, and produced more 
valuable returns, viz. three and fometimes more crops of oats ; 
but, as the foil was touched in fome degree by the mofs be- 
ing burnt once upon it, when the half burnt mofs had been 
ploughed into it, it became more fufceptible of damage from 
the fire every time the operation was repeated. And, this 
being the only one the farmer thought of, for making thofe 
grounds productive, it was repeated as often as he could. 
When long perfifted in, this management reduced the furface 
nearly to a caput mortuum, for which the only remedy yet 
found, is by very deep ploughing, or by goating, which was 
defcribed as the third method of reclaiming mofs, to bring up 
a confutable quantity of frefh clay.-The goating of the mofs 
was the moft expenfive method, but it made the moft fubftan- 
tial improvement, efpecially if any confidence quantity of 



of Kincardine. 495 

clay was raifed, as, it) that cafe, it formed a new foil, which, 
compelling the mofs by its weight, its fpunginefs produced 
no bad effc&amp;s. 

Mofs improved in this man net, after producing fome crops 
of grain, has continued for 40 years to be good pafturage. 
The grafs is coarfe indeed, but it would have been finer if 
due attention had been paid to keep the drains open. 

As thofe methods could be ufed to advantage on the fpread- 
ficld only, which is about one third of the thicknefs of the 
mofs in its natural ftate, confequently no very extenfive im- 
provements could be made by them, when fuch were aimed 
at, the practice of floating off the mofs by water was adopted. 
' On the mofs of Kincardine alone there are 1 26 families, con- 
taining 640 fouls, employed in this work. — The water is part- 
ly collected upon the mofs itfelf, and partly brought upon it, 
by two channels raifed by embanking, from the dry-field 
Which lies higher than the mofs *. 

Since 1770, about 280 acres of the mofs of Kincardine have 
been reclaimed by the mofs tenants before mentioned, and 
the farmers of the contiguous grounds. 

The depth of the high mofs, or that from which no peat 
has been cut, is from 8 to 14 feet ; that of the fpread- field is 
from 2 to 6 feet.— -The depth of wafte mofs, which conflitutes 
the principal part of the fpread- field, is in general in the 
proportion of 4 to 8 of that part of the mofs which is fit for 
peat. — The expence of clearing an acre of the high mofs is 
from L. 10 to L. 12 and of the fpread-field from L. 3 to 
L.6 -(-. 

Agriculture. 

* In one inrtance, water is raifed from the Teath to the height of 18 feet, 
ly a Perfian wheel, and conveyed about 300 yards in a pipe of 18 inches diame- 
ter, which difcharges it into an aqueduct that reaches the mofs at the diftancc 
•f 800 yards. 

t The encouragements given, for removing the mofs are different with 

different

Agriculture— About one halfof the Carfe is ftill covered by 
the modes of Kincardine and Flanders before defcribed. — The 

other 

different proprietors. The moft common method is to let a portion, com* 
roonly from 6 to 8 acres, to a mofs tenant or laird, as, in contempt, he is 
generally filled, for 36 years. — In money and timber for building his hut he 
receives from the proprietor to the amount of L. 3 or L. 4 fterling. — No rent 
is exacted for the firft 7 years : On the eighth he pays a merk Scotch, ad- 
vancing a merk each year, until the 20th year : For this, and the remaining 
18 years, he pays at the rate of 12s. yearly for each acre cleared, and as. 6d. 
per acre for what is not cleared.— This lad obligation is confidered merely 
as a fpur to the tenant to reclaim the ground ; for the"i§ofs, in its original 
ftate, is not worth 3d. per acre. 

At the end of the lcafe, all buildings that have been erected upon the pof- 
feffion belong to the proprietor ; and the tenant is not entitled to any com- 
penfation for them, or his improvements.— Some proprietors, of more liberal 
and enlarged views, pay to the tenant from L.3 to L. 12 for each acre re- 
claimed, according to the depth of the mofs, or bog-earth removed from it. 
—In fome cafes, this is paid when the work is executed ; in others, it Is 
paid at the end of the leafe. In the firft cafe, the tenant pays from 12s. to 
16s. of rent per acre, in the fecond cafe he pays no rent.— At whatever of 
thefe periods payment is made to the tenant, much more encouragement and 
ability is afforded to him, to perfevere in reclaiming the ground, than is done 
by the terms of the leafes firft defcribed.— For as; a great part of the mofs 
tenants depend upon their labour for the maintenance of themfelves and thcir 
families; during the firft years of their lcafe, when they have little ground 
cleared and have their houfe .to build, they can afford to beftow only, a 
fmall part of labour towards improving their pofieffions, But about the 12th 
year of the lcafe, when commonly the tenant has got from two to three acres 
cleared, the produce thereof maintains his family, and, by the fale of h.s 
peats, 'he procures money forpurchafmg cloaths and manure, he can then be. 
flow all his labour, not required for the culture of thefe three acres, m pre- 
paring his peats, and other methods of removing the mofs. 

Now at this period, the ardour of the tenant, upon a leafe of tenor firft 
defcribed to reclaim the high mofs is greatly checked._It cofts him labour 
«orth L 10 or U It or frpm 17 to 20 years purchafe, to clear it, and he ,s 
to poffefes it, free of rent, only for 6 years : Whatever part of this fum „ 
BO t recovered before the end of thefe H* years, may be confide red as loft to

other half is employed chiefly in railing oats, barley and beans. 
Thefe in fome farms occupy nearly equal portions ; but in ge- 
neral the proportion of oats is greateft, a few peafe are fre- 
quently mixed with the beans, and fometimes, although rare- 
ly, they are fdwn by themfelves Wheat, as appears from 

jie reddenda of the abbey of Cambuflcenheth, and from fome

But its culture, except on tvfo farms, has been but lately

"ome have begun to-fow it for hay. The whole of the dry-

learly three fifths are in tillage, and of this, three fourths, at 
in ? average, are employed in railing oats ; the remainder is

tereft of the landlord to give the tenant fuch encouragement for reclaiming 
lis ground, rather than to have it lie wafte until the end of his leafe ; for if

betwixt infield and outfield was univerfal, and on the infield 
one crop of barley was followed commonly by two crops of 
oats. The outfield was alternately three years in ley, and 

three years in tillage, and oats alone were fownon it. Butthis 

flovenly method of diftinguifhing grounds into outfield and in- 
field is faft wearing out ; fome farmers have gone fo far even 
as to reverfe that management which formerly was reckoned 
good 5 and inftead of taking two crops of oats and one of bai- 
ley, they take two of barley and one of oats. This can fuc- 
ceed only on fuch grounds as are well cultivated, and where 
fown graft '* introduced into the rotation—This mode of ma- 
nagement is after the ground has been one, two, or even three 
years under grafs, to lay dung on the furface in the beginning 
of winter, and plough it in immediately, harrow in fpnng, un-

fubdivifions of the inclofures, and of a houfe for the cattle that 
are to be fed upon the turnips, diftina from the common byre, 
feem to be the chief obftacles to their culture.— Perhaps the 
finall extent of the carfe farms is alfo an obftacle to the pro- 
duftion of any confiderable quantity of wheat or hay, as alfo 
to the fummer fallowing to any great extent— The fize of the 
farms is fo much adapted to the prefent cuftom of executing 
all the labour in the fpring, that the divifion of the labour into 
different feafons, which is one great benefit of the introduc- 
tion of wheat and hay, would not enable the farmer to lefTen 
the number of his fervants and horfes. — Notwithstanding of 
this, however, fummer fallowing bids fair to become a general 
practice in the carfe, as it is highly beneficial to a clay foil, and 
allows the lime to be applied to the bed advantage. — Great 
quantities of lime for manure are brought from Sauchie, five 
miles diftant from the E. point of the parifh, and alfo from 
the Earl of Elgin's works on the Forth. 

The price of a heaped bufhel, wheat meafure, of (hells, or 
unflacked lime is 4d. and of the carriage to Kincardine from 
2df, to 4d. — In the dryfield i lobufhels are allowed, at an ave- 
rage, to the acre. In the carfe double that quantity, and fome- ' 
times 240 bufhels, are allowed. — The ufe of lime as a manure 
is of an old date here, but it was never carried to any valuable 
height, until in confequence of the building of a bridge over 
the Forth at Dript, about 20 years ago, carts could be ufed 
conveniently for its carriage •, before this event it was carried 
chiefly on horfes backs.— -The demand is increafing annually,' 
and for feveral years paft, has much exceeded the fupply. 

There is no ground almofi kept in the carfe for pafturage, 
excepting what is liable to be overflowed by the rivers — This 
is paftured by the milk cows, but a confiderable part of their 
food even in fummer is broad clover, given then in the byre. 
The horfes are fed almofi entirely on it in fummer, being ne-

ver almoft allowed to pafture, excepting a little on the ftubbles. 

Even in the dry-field there is not much good pafturage, ex- 
cepting upon the farms of a few of the more intelligent and 
active farmers. — The others apply fuch parts only of their out- 
field grounds to pafturage as have been exhaufted by produ- 
cing crops of oats, and upon which not a handful of grafs 
feeds have been thrown, and thefe continuing only three years 
in grafs, of courfe the crops muft be very pqor— It is therefore 
a general practice of the farmers of the dryrfield, as well as of 
thofe of the carfe, to fend their young cattle, in fummer to the 
fyll grounds, upon both fides of the Strath, to be grazed. 

The rate of pafturage varies from 3s to 7s a head, according 
tp the goodnefs of the pafture, and the age of the cattle *. 

The Carfe farms, 24 in number, contain, 50 acres, and rent 
at L. 45 at an average. The farms in the dry-field, 24 in num- 
ber, contain each 60 acres at an average, and the rent about 12s. 
per acre.— In the new leafes 20s. per acre is the rent of the 
Carfe farms, and 14s. of thofe of the dry-field. The rent 
has advanced nearly two fifths, in the courfe of the laft 20 
years.— There is a bounding fence about every farm almoft in 
the Carfe in the eaft part of the parilb, but few are fubdivided. 
The dry- field farms there are nearly all inclofed and fubdivided. 

There are few inciofures in the Carfe in the weft part of the 
parifh ; but a confiderable part of the dry-field there is inclof- 
ed 

* The carfe farmers keep at an average five work horfes, two of which they 
wilh to be brood mares, and each produces commonly a foal every fecond year. 
_*s the horfes are hard wrought, although they mould efcape difeafe or ac- 
cident they are fold commonly at the age of fifteen ; therefore the farmer does 
not complain, although his mares (hould do little more than keep up his (lock 

of horfes. ' 

five cows are kept at an average, and the quey calves only are reared, but 
the farmer reckons upon felling one cow annually, and having another to be- 
come dry about mid-fummer, and to be fed for a mart for the family.-The pro- 
portion of horfes kept in the dryfield is left, and that of cows greater, but the 
aeonomy is fimiiar.

ed and fubdivided— Befides the grounds now defcribed as in 
the poffeflion of the farmers, there are about 700 acres inclof- 
ed and improved grafs ground, that are either in the natural 
poneffion of the proprietor, or let in fingle inclofures from 
year to year, at the rate of 18s. per acre, at a medium. 

All the ftieep kept in the parilh are in thefe inclofures. 
The ordinary mode of managing them is, to buy ewes big 
with young in the beginning of winter, and to fell the lamb 
to the butcher, when of a proper age, and the ewe when fat*. 

Mifcellaneouf 

* Almoft all the labouring fervants arc unmarried, and live in the farm 
houfes. There are two men, a boy and a women fervant employed by almoft 
every farmer ; but, if he has children grown up, they fupply the place of 
fervants. The farmer himfelf works and fares in the fame manner nearly as 
his fervants do. Commonly they all eat at the fame table. By the farmers 
there are few labourers employed, except in harveft, or the hurry of fpring 
work ; threfhing is performed before breakfaft in the winter and fpring 
feafons, and, in the fiiort days, chiefly by candle light. All the grain, excep. 
ting a few beans, is threlhed by the time the barley is fown. 

Thirlage was formerly univerfal, for what was called grindable victual, i. e. 
for all the oats, not. ufed upon the farm for feed or the horfes, and 
whatever barley or beans were confumed in the family ; but now feveral of the 
proprietors of the mills tranfacl with their own tenants for exemption from 
thirlage. Neverthelefs, no farmer almoft ever fells oats, he has them all 
manufa&amp;ured, and fells the meal. 

The yearly wages of men fevants from 30 to 40 years ago were L. % : 10 ; 
ten years later they were L. 5. Now the foreman in the Carfe has frequently 
L. 6 : 9. The feeond man L. 7. Lads of (ixtjeen who twenty years ago got L. 2 
now get L. 5. In the dry-field, the wages of men fervants are generally 

30s. lower than in the carfe. Women fervants bave L. % : 10 or L. 3 The 

wages of labourers, 30 years ago, were 4d. per day in winter, and £d. in fum- 
mer : About that time they were raifed to jd. in winter, and 6d. in fummer.— • 
They were further entitled to two pecks of meal weekly at 8d. per peck, 
which was fomewhat below the market price. — About 15 years ago, they re- 
ceived half a merk Scotch in winter, and 8d. in fummer ; now 9d. per day

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — It may be noticed as a defect, 
with refpecl: to the interefts of the country at large, in the 
oeconomy of the farmers of this parifh and neighbourhood, 
that they employ only unmarried men as fervants. The ef- 
fect of which is, that fewer marry than would, if they had a 
rjrofpecl: of obtaining employment, amidft their relations and 
companions, in that fpecies of labour to which they have been 
bred, equally well after marriage as before it. And alfo, that, 
of thofe who marry, fome leave the parifh, and others become 
mofs tenants, at the hazard of enduring greater hardfhips

be deducted. Formerly this practice was reckoned favourable to the em- 
ployer, but now, from the change in the way of living, it is reckoned to be 
rather againft him. — Cutting hay cofts aod. per acre ; (hearing corn, js. 6d. 

per ditto. The wages of harveft work are, to men Is. per day and victuals, 

to women 8d. and victuals.— The men, if engaged during the harveft, re- 
ceives L. I : IJ if only during the time of cutting L. I : 8. The women 

get L. I : I. The wages for taylors, aj years ago, were 2d. per day and 

viftuals ; 1 5 years fince 4d ; now 8d. and iod. with victuals. — The '..ages for 
mafons are as. for carpenters i8d. per day.— Cotton fpinners cam from 8s. 
to L. I : 15 per week. One man, who left the plough about a year ago, 
earns L. I : 11 : 6 weekly. Women, at the cotton work, earn from 3s. to 7s. 
per week, children, from is. to as. 6d. per week. 

There are different focieties formed among the workmen, each of which 
has a fund for the relief of the fick. Each of thefe focieties gives 3s. per 
week to fuch of their members as are unable to work, but not confined to bed, 
and 6s. to fuch of them as are in the latter cafe.— The fame perfon may be, 
and frequently is, a member of two of thofe focieties, and thus receives las. 
per week in ficknefs.— The condition of the labourers and handycraftfmen, it 
may be collected from what is already laid, is much improved, efpecially in 
the courfe of the laft ia years. They have conftant employment, and their 
expence of living, although greater than formerly, is not increafed in pro- 
portion to the advance of wages—When in health, they maintain themfelvcs 
and families in a manner, that, being compared to that to which they were 
accuftomed in their early days, appears to them very comfortable. Few of 
tliem need any charitable fupply, and fome fave money, 



of Kincardine. 50$ 

for fomc time, if they have not faved money, than if they 
left the parifh. 

The implements of hufbandry are greatly improved of 
late years. There are fcarcely any of the old Scotch ploughs 
ufed now in the parifh.. About fourteen years ago, Small's 
plough was introduced among the farmers, and a faaory of 
them eftablifhed within the parifh. This has occanoned a 
confiderable diminution of the expence of the labour ; be- 
fore that time, there were always three or four horfes ufed in 
each, and of courfe a driver was employed.— Now even thofe, 
who have not adopted this plough, ufe generally two horfes 
only, and commonly have no drivers. 

One horfe carts only are ufed ; two horfe carts have been 
tried, but have been given up from the experience, that two 
horfes, when each has his cart, will, draw a much heavier 
load, than they could do, if yoked in one cart *. 

Threfhing 

• Thofe who lived in parts of the country that have been long acquainted 
with more enlightened and more fpirited modes of agcriulture, may think • 
themfelves authorifed, by the circumftances now mentioned, to conclude that 
this part of the country is very far behind every thing relative to hulbandry 
but it is merely -doing juftice to the farmers of this neighbourhood to obferve, 
that, although the fmall extent of the farms throws agriculture necefiarily in- 
to the hands of perfons of fmaller fiock, and lefs enlarged views, than it is in 
thofe countries where the greater extent of the farms gives em ploy men t to 
perfons of better education, and who have opportunities of being acquainted 
with the improvements making in different parts ; the farmers here have of 
late years made a very great progrefs to a better ftile of hufbandry; and 
thofe who are inclined to defpife them, may find fomething worthy of their i- 
mitation in the care they bellow for the prefcrvation of their implements in 
hufbandry. Even the moll: inconfiderable and flovenly tenant has a cart or 
wood houfe, in which the caits, ploughs, &amp;c. are flored, when not in ufe, while 
among the intelligent and wealthy farmers in Berwickfhire and the Lothians, 
few have fuch an accommodation, and from want of it, their implements of hul- 
bandry, purchafed at a great expence, being espoied, when unemployed, to 
all the extremes of drought and moUUire, fijffcr little lefs from this bad ma- 
nagement, than from ufe.

Threfiiing machines are coming faft into ufe. One of 
thefe threfhes eight threaves or fixteen ftooks in the 
hour, and may be wrought by one good horfe. It threflies 
perfectly clean, and by thefe means is reckoned to obtain one 
boll more in twenty, than is done by the flail. The expence 
of the machinery is lefs than 20I. — There are two perfons em- 
ployed in conftrudling thefe machines, within a mile of the 
place *. 

About ten acres are covered with a natural oak wood. A- 
bout 40 acres were begun to be planted with different fpecies 
of foreft trees about the year 1 7 1 5. The larix has throve par- 
ticularly well. Six trees of this fpecies had been planted in 
1 735, in fome openings that had been left in the grove, be- 
hind the houfe of Blairdrummond, that was planted in 17 15, 
and they now overtop greatly all the other trees. — One of them 
was cut lately, it meafured 66 feet in length, and contained 
134 feet of wood, reckoned equally good in quality as foreign 
fir. The five trees remaining contain 550 feet of wood.— 
About 70 acres have been planted in the courfe of the laft 2£ 
years. 

It will not be doubted that the larch occupies a confiderable 
{hare. It is found to be the beft method to plant it without 
any mixture of other trees, or at leaft without any dependence 
upon them for fhelter, for, as it grows fo much quicker than 
any, even of the fir or pine fpecies, it is liable to bend towards 
tbe N. E. unlefs fheltered by others.

September, beans fometimes in February, but generally in the laft half of 
March, and firft half of April, barley in the laft week of April, and the firft 
week of May. 

The barley and wheat harveft begins ordinarily in the middle of Auguft, 
and that of oats and beans about the beginning of September.

As thefe plantations have been made chiefly for the purpofe 
of embellifliment, they add much to the beauty of the coun- 
try ; they alfo add confiderably to its value. T he 30 acres 
of old plantation, together with the dropping trees in the 
lawn at Blairdrummo'nd, have been furveyed, and the greater 
part of the trees meafured, and they are valued at 5000I. 

The valued rent of the parifh is L. 4800 Scotch, and the real 
: rent about L. ^500 Sterling. 

There has been very little land fold in the parifh for many 
years paft; the price of it has been about 40 years purchafe.

Situation, Stipend, &amp;c. 

N this pariih are three villages of the name of Liberton, 
Kirk Liberton, Nether Liberton, and Upper and Over 
Liberton. The former, about two miles fouth of Edinburgh, 
fituated on a rifmg Hoping ground, has a noble profpet~t, and 
is nearly in the centre of the parifti. In this village is the 
church, an antient building. The patrons are the crown, 
and Mr. Wauchope of Niddry Marfhal, per vices. The fti- 
pend is 21 bolls 144 pecks of wheat, 50 bolls of barley, 63 
bolls of oats, and L. 23 : 1 1 : 3 A in money. There has been 
no augmentation fince the year 1700; at that time an additi- 
on was granted of L. 10, which had the appellation of pre- 
bends fee. Nothing is allowed for communion elements. 
The glebe is very inconfiderable, and more than half of it is

of Liberton amounted to 52 chalders, 3 bolls, and 3 firlots of 
victual 5 their real valuation at prefent mull be ten times as 
much. The fchoolmafter of Liberton has a falary of about 
200 merks, befides 40 merits as feffion clerk, and 52 merks 
as the intereft of a mortification. Befides the public, there 
are private fchools in different places of the parifh, for teach- 
ing Englifh, arithmetic and writing. 

Extent, and Population.— -The parifh is large, containing 62 
ploughgates of land, which, at the ordinary computation of 
45 acres to a ploughgate, give a total of 4 1 40 ftatute acres of a- 
rable ground. It is more populous than any other country 
parifh in the Prefbytery of Edinburgh, that of St. Cuthberts 
excepted, containing 3457 fouls, whereof 755 refide in Gil- 
merton. On an average of 20 years preceding 1786, there 
were i3obaptifed, 25 couples married, and 102 buried. For 
2o years precetding 1725, the annual average of baptifms 
was 117, of marriages 20 couples, and of burials 106. The 
return to Dr. Webfter in 1755 was 2793 fouls, and the in- 
habitants feem {till to be on the increafe, on account of the 
lime works, and the colliery at Gilmertcn. 

Charitable Funds. — For many years pad, the collections at 
the church doors have amounted at a medium to L. 42 per 
annum, the mortcloths to L. 22, the rents of houfes gar- 
dens and feats in the church belonging to the poor, to 
L. 2 1 =7:4, amounting in whole to L. 85 : 7 : 4 ; all which is 
expended each year. Befides thefe, L. 5, the intereft of a le- 
gacy, is yearly diftributed to the diflrefled and languishing ; 
and L. 40 is bellowed every Chriftmas, by the direction of 
thofe who have landed property, on certain poor labourers, 
whofe work is moftly . without doors, and who, on that ac- 
count, may be prevented from working by the feverity or in-

clemency of the feafoh. By the destination of the donor, 
none are to have more than L. 5 and none lefs than 50s. per 
annum. The magistrates of Edinburgh are truftces of this 
charity, which was the donation of Commodore Alexander 
Horn, a native of this parifh. In the memorably fevere year 
1783, the poor were fupported by the accumulations of a le- 
gacyjbequeathed by Sir James Stewart of Goodtrees, formerly 
hisMajefty's advocate for Scotland, in 17 13. 

Minerals, Occupations of the People. — At Gilmerton there 
are above 20 feams of coal, from 2f to 10 feet thick ; four or 
five of thefe feams are working. The lime-ftone quarries at 
that place yield 70,000 bolls of lime, and employ 35 men, an- 
nually ; and two other quarries, in the parifh, have yielded 
above 30,000 bolls of lime per annum. — There is no place 
where the poorer fort, who are able or inclined to work, meet 
with more encouragement than here. Not to mention the 
draw kiln at Bourdeaux ; not to mention the colleries ; not 
to mention thofe who are employed in the public roads, or 
thofe whom the farmers are obliged continually to employ, 
the quarries, the lime kilns, afford work to great numbers. 
Many alfo earn their bread by driving of carts, and they live 
decently, and become independent. There are no fewer than 
131 perfonsin the parifh, who, with their families, depend 
mainly on the driving of carts. They have of late entered in- 
to a fociety, and obferve an annual proceffiori. There are not 
nearly fo many in any other line; there being only 30 farm- 
ers, I2fmiths, i4mafons, 17 weavers, and 12 taylors. A 
great many of the females are employed in wafliing of clothes, 
and find their advantage in it. 

Rivulets, Rent, feV.— There are two rivulets in the parifb, 
which, fmall as they are, fupply no lefs than eight mills, be-

fides the bkachfield at Peffermill. The grounds of Liberton, 
in general, independant of the advantages of manure fiom the 
city, are as fruitful as any in the neighbourhood. The fir 
toation is healthful, and many arrive to a great age—The 
valuation of the parilh, being the real rent in 1649, is 
L. 13,685:6:8 Scotch; the real rent at prefent amounts to 
t .0,000 fterling. The upper part of the inhabitants are fo- 
ber, regular, exemplary, and have always fhewn a particular 
regard to the interefts of the poor. The lower fort are often 
noify and clamorous, and are rather of violent paffions, but 
foon pacified and appeafed. Their morals, in general, are 
not fo unexceptionable as could be wifhed and no wonder, 
when they live in the neighbourhood of fuch a city as Edin- 
burgh. 

Mifcelfoneous Obfer -vat 'ions. —In this parifh are the principal 
feats of the two oldeft families in Mid- Lothian, the Wauchooes 
of Niddry Marfhall, and the Lords Somerville ; the former 
having been feated here for more than 400 years, and the lat-

Name and Extent. 
nr^HIS parifh, in all writings concerning the patronage, 
tithes, &amp;c. is defigned the parifh of Forfar Reftenet ; 
though the latter part of the name is feldom mentioned in 
converfation or in common writing. Reftenet was perhaps 
the name given to the Priory, expreflive of the purpofe for 
which it was built, namely, a fafe repofitofy for the charters, 
&amp;c. of the monaftery of Jedburgh ; but fome take its deriva- 
tion from a Gaelic word, Rijk. (ignifying, as they fay, a bog or 
fwamp, which indeed anfwers to the fituation. 

Forfar is conjectured to be the fame with the antient Or, 
and the Roman Orrea, fignifying a town fituated on a lake, 
to which defcription it exactly anfwers ; and the lake to which 
it ftands, has for many ages been known by the name of For- 
far. 

The parifh is divided into burgh and landward ; whether 
Forfar and Reftenet have fome time or other been two different 

parifhes,

parifhes, and afterwards uniccd, is not certain ; but the burgh 
and landward parts of the parifh have long had, and continue to , 
have, diftina interefts in fo far as relates to the fupplying of 
the poor, and they make feparate collections for them at the 
church door. 

The form of the parifh is irregular, its greateft extent from 
N. to S. being about 6 Englilh miles, and from E. to W about 
5 ; though in fome places, it does not exceed 3 Englilh miles 
in breadth and 4 in length. The town in which the church

Town of Forfar Forfar is a royal burgh of confiderable anti- 
quity, and the capital of the county of Angus or Forfar ; the 
fheriff whereof has held his court for upwards of two hundred 
years in this town, which is pretty centrically fituated for the ad- 
miniftration of jultice. It is alfo the featof the prefbytery of For- 
far •, confiding in all of eleven parifhes, the churches of which 
lie around it, at, or within the diftance of four computed 
miles, except that of Cortachie which is rather more than five. 

The ground on which it Hands, with that for a confider- 
able way around, is uncommonly uneven, and covered, as it 
were, with hillocks of various fizes, as if nature had here, at 
fome period, fufFered a convullion. Though low with refpe£l 
to the circumjacent ground on every fide excepting the Well, 
it is high in comparifon to the general level of the country. 
The lakes and fprings, a mile to the eafb of it, run eaftward 
and empty themfclves into the German ocean at Lunan Bay.

been thought practicable, and by fome an object worthy of com- 
mercial attention, to open a communication by a canal be- 
tween Forfar and the fea in either of thefe directions *'. 

Forfar commands a fine view of the Seedlaw hills and the 
valley of Strathmore, terminated by the Grampians on the 
weft, the molt confiderable of which is about 50 miles diftant* 
In that direction is the famous Schihallion. 

Forfar is perhaps a lingular inftance in Scotland, of a town 
of any note, built at a diftance from running water ; but the 
vicinity of the lake with its numerous fprings, and the protec- 
tion of the cattle, a place in former times of confiderable 
ftrength, mutt have firft invited the inhabitants of the country 
to fettle and form a , village, which afterwards becoming 
the occafional refidence of Majefty, was diltinguifhed by 
confiderable numbers of royal favours, the memory of which 
is prtferved in the names of places and fields within the royal- 
ty, fuch as the King's muir, the Queen's well, the Queen's 
manor, the palace-dykes, the guard- breads, &amp;c. f

bounty; nor do the inhabitants feem to have been infenfible to the kindnefs 
(hewn them by their fovereigns. A parliamentary ratification, dated 1669, 
of the Royal writ of Novodamus, *ated 1665, proceeds upon the ab- 
ftrattion of the original charters and rights of the burgh, and the 
plundering of the inhabitants in 1651 for their attachment to the 
Royal Family, and particularly on " the faithful teftimony and diffent

« concerning bis Majefties Perfon." This aft, which bears fuch honourable 
teftimony to the humanity and public virtue of the chief magiftrate of For- 
far, befides confirming all the ancient rights and privileges of the burgh, 
ratifies its right to the patronage and tythes of the parilh, difponed by James 
and Sir George Fletchers of Reftenet, and of any feus or rents payable out 
of the burgh acres to the priory of Reftenet, the abbey of Coupar, and Lord

duftry in manufacturing a peculiar fabric of fhoes, which they 
ftill carry on to a great extent, it being well adapted to the 
ufes of the country people, particularly in the braes of Angus. 
— About the year 1745 or 1746 the manufactory of Ofnaburgh 
was introduced here, which from very fmall beginnings has 
grown into a great trade, and has become the ftaple of the 
place ; and the happy influence of which, particularly of late 
years, is vifible in the amazing increafe of population and 
wealth, and the confequent improvement of every thing. — This 
branch of manufacture was brought to Forfar by a gentleman 
ftill living there, who has acquired by it a comfortable inde- 
pendence.— His brother, a weaver in or near Arbroath, (a- 
bout the year 1738 or 1739) having got a fmall quantity of flax 
unfit for the kind of cloth then ufually brought to market, 
made it into a web, and offered it to his merchant as a piece on 
which he thought he mould, and was willing to, lofe. The 
merchant, who had been in Germany, immediately remarked 
the fimilarity between this piece of cloth and the fabric of Of- 
naburgh, and urged the weaver to attempt other pieces of the 
fame kind, which he reluctantly undertook. The experiment 
however fucceeded to a wifh.— Many hands were foon em- 
ployed in the neighbourhood of Arbroath, where a Company 
was eftablifhed to promote the bufinefs, and from whence the 
difcovery was brought to Forfar at the period above mention- 
ed.— Before that time the flax was dreffed by women ; there 
was no cloth made at Forfar, but a few yard-wides, called 
Scrims } the number of incorporated weavers did not exceed 40. 
nor were there above 60 looms employed in the town. But 
in confequence of the aft for encouraging weavers, the trade 
increafed fo rapidly, that, before the year 1750, there were up- 
wards of 140 looms going in Forfar, and at prefent there are 
between 400 and 500. 
The knowledge of this art is fo eafily acquired, the call for 

hands 



of Forfar. 5*5 

hands fo great, that almoft every young man here betakes him- 
felf to it. He receives a part of the profit of his work from 
the very day his apprenticefhip begins ; in a year or two he is 
qualified to carry on bufmefs for himfelf, and able to fupport a 
family, and fo he marries and multiplies ; and this facility of 
acquiring a living at an early period of life is one great caufe of 
the rapid increafe of population. To this alfo it is owing, per- 
haps, that other profeffions, lefs profitable and more difficult 
to acquire, are feldomerpurfued by the young men of this place; 
and it is a faft worthy of notice, that there has not been above 
one or two apprentice taylors in Forfar thefe feven years paft. 

The Ofnaburgh trade is indeed a fluftuating one, and when 
the demand for that fabric flackens at any time, it brings ma- 
ny of the young and improvident into difficulties, and often- 
times adds to the number of the poor. But when the trade is 
good (and it has been for fometimes paft more (table and more 
flourifhing than ever it was known before), the profits of it, 
with the government bounty, are fufficient to fupport the fober 
and induftrious weaver againft the influence of a falling mar- 
ket. —Manufacturers are juft now giving from 15s. to 20s. for 
working the piece of ten dozen of yards, which a man of good 
execution will accomplifh in nearly as many days ; and a man 
working his own web,has been known to produce 1 8 fuch pieces 
by his own hands in the fpace of 19 weeks. — This however is 
allowed by all to be extraordinary, though it fhews what fobrie- 
ty and diligence may do. 

The trade and wealth of Forfar having increafed fo rapidly 
fince the year 1745, muft naturally be fuppofed to have pro- 
duced great alterations in the appearance of the place and the 
manners of its inhabitants. Accordingly their buildings, their 
expence of living, and their drefs are almoft totally changed 
fince that period. And there is a remarkable difference, even 

3 T 2 within 



516 Statijlical Account 

within thefe i o years, not only in all thefe refpects, but alfo 
in their amufements. 

About and before the year 1745 there were few private houfes 
covered with flate, and the mafonry of almoft all of them was 
of a very inferior kind ; fmce that time almoft every new houfe 
has been covered with flates of a coarfe kind, of which there 
are plenty in quarries within the royalty, and feveral of the 
principal ones with Eafdale. A thatched houfe is fcarcely to be 
feen, and the mafonry of fuch houfes as have been built of late 
years is neat and fubftantial ; the inhabitants appearing to have 
caught a new tafte in building from the pattern fet them in 
the new Town-heufe and new Church, which are of neat mo- 
dern architecture* 

Like moft towns in Scotland, Forfar had been built without 
any regular defign, as every man's fancy dictated the Gtuation 
of his houfe ; now more attention is beftowed in regulating the 
itreets in the extended parts of the town, as well as in remov- 
ing irregularities in rebuilding houfes in the old-ftreet. — There 
are no uninhabited houfes, new ones are extending the town 
in almoft every direaion, and houfe rents are rather on the rife. 
Moft of the houfes built for trades-people confift of two ftories, 
having four apartments of about 16 feet fquare each, one of 
which, with a portion of the garret, is fuffkient to accommo- 
date a weaver with his loom, his furniture and his fuel, and 
he pays for is, and a few feet of garden ground, from 20s. to 
45's.per annum, according to itsdiftance from the market-place 
or its other advantages or difadvantages. The weaver gener- 
ally prefers the low flat for his operations, and an open expo- 
fure, if poflible, to the heart of the town *. 

* About 50 or 60 years ago there were not above 7 tea-kettles, as- mauy 
hand-bellows, and as many watches in Forfar: now tea-kettles andW- 
bellows are the neceflary furniture of the pooreft houfe in the parilh, and al- 
moft the meaneft menial fervant muft.havc his watch.

About 1745 the common rent of an acre of burgh land was 
L. 10 Scotch, including 4od. for minifters ftipend. An acre of 
the fame land is now often let at from 50s to L. 3 per annum : 
Several of them near the town bring more than twice as much, 
and the whole of them have been lately found by a decreet

About the fame period, a' leg of good beef weighing 4 ^nc might have 
teen purchafed for 5 s. ; a leg of tolerable veal for jd. the higheft for is. and 
fome fo low as ad*. ; mutton from 8d. to is. per leg ; a {mailer fort from the 
Grampians, but of excellent flavour, from 4 d. to 5 d. per leg. Previous to 174S 
there was no meat fold in Forfar by weight, and very feldom was an ox killed 
till the greater part of the carcafe had been befpoken.-A little before that 
tw* work oxen, weighing about 30 ftone each, were fold in one of the Forfar 
fairs for 50 merks Scots the head ; and both the fize of the cattle and the 
price of them were thought a wonder. 

An ox, worth at that time about 40s. fupplied the flem-market of Forfar 
eight days or a fortnight, except on extraordinary occafions, from Chriftmafs 
toLammas. Between Hallowmafs and Chriftmafs, when the people laid in 
their winter provifions, about a 4 beeves were killed in a week ; the beft Hot 
exceeding 16 or ao ftone. A man who had bought a (hillings worth of beef 
or an ounce of tea, would have concealed it from his neighbours like murder. 
Eggs were bought for id. per doz n, butter from 3d. to 4 d. per lb. and a good 
hen was thought high at a groat. 

The gradual advancement of population, trade, and agricultural improve- 
ment, has produced the gradual rife in the price and consumption of all thefe 
articles, which within thefe laft twenty years are fome of themdoubled,and many 
•f them trebled ; oat meal too has rifen, but not in the fame proportion with 
mod other articles. And there are few artificers who cannot well afford to 
treat themfelves and their families frequently with meat and wheaten bread, 
confidcrable quantities of both being confumed by them. At an average, 
there is not lefs than L. 50. worth of meat fold in the flefh market of Forfar 
every week throughout the year. — Good meat brings from 3d. to 4 d. and fome- 
times 5d. per lb. and can feldom be purchafed in quantities, even at the cheap- 
eft period*, for lefs than 4 s. per (lone. Eggs which ten years ago fold at ad. 
per) dozen are now rifen to 4d. and lomctimes 6d. Hens are from iod to is. 
Butter from 8d. to icd. \ per pound of 24 ounces Englilh and other ar- 
ticles in proportion. Though this bears hard upon annuitants, yet it is u- 
niverfally allowed that labouring people purchafe more of thefe articles now, 
and are better able to do it, than when provifions were cheaper,

of 19 years. 

Clover grafs-feed was firft fown in one of the burgh acres 
about 60 years ago, and the people around tun to fee it as a 
curiofity ; nor did it become general in this neighbourhood 
for upwards of 20 years after. 

The foil of the burgh acres is of a light nature, and of no 
considerable depth, having in general a gravel bottom, and it 
has been faid athoufand times, that itand theground a confidera- 
ble way round, would take a (hower every day in the year 
without prejudice; yet, being flanked by the range of Seed- 
law-hills on the fouth, of the Grampians on the north, ^the 
teeming clouds coming from the weft with the prevailing fum- 
mer-winds, often pafs over and {hed their fertilizing influence 
on the hills on either fide of this trad, while every thing in 
the intermediate fpace was burning up. The foil produces 
excellent barley, but the oat crops in general are light and pun- 
ny. Thedifcovery of marie and the increafed quantity of hot 
manure from the town, has improved it very much of late, 
and the multiplied confumption of the produce has fo much 
excited the induftry and attention of the inhabitants, that mod 
of the old fields are in a ftate of high cultivation, while feve- 
ral extenfive ones improved from barren muir produce plenti- 
ful crops. It fhould be obferved, however, that the tackfmen 
of thefe acres are not in general able to pay the high rent 
which many of them do, from the produce of the ground, but 
one mull have a cow for his family, and another a horfe to car- 
ry him to a diftant market or bring goods from a fea-port, and 
he takes a piece of ground near him and pays a premium for 
his convenience *. \ General

General CharaBer of the Inhabitants.— The general character 
of the inhabitants is that of induftry and enterprife. As in o- 
ther large aiTcmblages of men, inftances of diffipation are not 
wanting, and failures among trading people now and then hap- 
pen ; effects, which a fudden influx of wealth, and inexperi- 
ence in the paths of extended commerce, feldom fail to pro- 
duce and multiply ; hut it has been obferved, to the honour of the 
merchants of Forfar, by the people from a diftance who have 
had long and extenGve dealings in this country, that there 
is no town in Angus, where they find fewer bankruptcies and 
more pun£lual payments. 

Articles of commerce are greatly more numerous within thefe 
few years. Wine of various forts, which was formerly brought 
from Dundee in dozens, and feldom ufed but as a medicine, 

is 

the wife of a wealthy burgefs going to church arrayed in a rich filk gown co- 
vered by a homely plaid ; now filk mantles and bonnets, and falhionable head- 
drefTes are no rarities ; and even the fervant maids begin in this refpect to ape 
the drefs of their fuperiors. Formerly a ball or focial dance was not thought 
of above once or twice in a year, and the ladies in general appeared at it drefs- 
cd in clofe caps like their grandmothers ; for feveral years paft there has been, 
during the winter feafon, a monthly concert of Italian and Scotch mufic, per- 
formed by the gentlemen of the place, and followed by a dance, well^attcnded, 
and prefenting a company of ladies and gentlemen drefled in the modern fa- 
fhion. Entertainments of the fame kind are fometimes given in fummcr; 
one in particular on the 19 th of June, kept as an anniverfary in hefhour 
of St Margaret, Malcolm Canmore's Queen, to whofe munificence perhaps 
Forfar was much indebted. Buchannau flyles her, " Lectijpma et singulari 
fictate Famina;" and afcribes many of the bert acls of her hu/band's reign to 
the influence of her piety and prudence, particularly the abrogation of Eve~ 
nils' law of infamous memory. Tradition celebrates her attention to the 
good inftruftion of the young women in Forfar, and it is faid it was the law of 
her table, that none fhould drink after dinner who did not wait the giving of 
thanks, and hence the phrafe through Scotland of the grace drink. Thefc 
feftive fcenes are in general enjoyed at little expence, and have contributed 
not a little to cultivate the manners, and to promote the harmony of this 
focicty.

is now imported in pipes, and is a Very common drink at private 
as well as at public entertainments. Porter, which, about 
20 years, ago was fcarcely known, is now brought from Lon- 
don in great quantities and is becoming a common beverage, 
with the loweft of the people. Table-beer is feldom made 
by private families, but by the brewers in the town, who are 
a flourifhing clafs of men \ from 1600 to 2000 bolls of malt 
are confumed annually, but the confumpt of this article is lef- 
fened fince the introduction of porter. 

Superfine cloths, and all kinds of cotton, cloth and many o- 
ther articles formerly got from Dundee, are now to be had in 
plenty in many (hops in Forfar. 

Dundee is the neareft fea-port town, and with which Forfar 
has moft frequent intercoufe, but it alfo carries on a trade 
with Arbroath and Montrofe — The communication with all 
thefe places will be greatly facilitated when the turnpike roads 
leading to them are finifhed. The turnpike aft for this coun- 
ty commenced in June 1789, and the roads to Dundee and 
Arbroath are now nearly completed. Though the popular 
prejudice was at firft againft them, every one begins to fee his 
intereft in them now, fince as much can be drawn by one horfc 
as could formerly have been done with two, and the toll exi- 
gible for a one horfc cart per day from Forfar to Arbroath or 
Dundee, is no more than 4 d4- on either road. The turnpike road 
from Forfar to Perth is likewife in great forwardnefs, and will 
foon be compleated, to the general improvement of the eftates 
through which it paffes and the towns to and from which it 
l levels* 

One great drawback on the property of Forfar is the fear- 
city of fuel. Peats have indeed for feveral years paft been ob- 
tained from the lands gained by draining the loch of Forfar ; 
thefe are now nearly exhaufted, and a new mofs has been o- 
pened by the draining Loch-Reftenet, which, in its turn, a 

E

few years will fee to an end : at any rate the peats got from 
thence, though a convenient, are by no means a cheap article 
of fuel ; for the poor man, could he afford the money all at once, 
would be much cheaper, and if cheaper he muft be more com- 
fortable, with coal. A confiderable quantity of thriving firs 
are rifing on the town's property, and on fome of the eftates 
in the neighbourhood ; but their number feems by no means 
adequate to the probable demand for firing, when the molTes 
fhall be exhaufted; fo that the community's fole dependence 
for this article, at fome future period, will be on coal, 
which at prefent is obtained from Arbroath and Dundee, at a 
very great expence, not lefs than from 9s. to 10s. 6d. per boll 
of 70- ftone Dutch. In fome places of the flate quarries in 
this neighbourhood, ftrata of culm-ftone have been found, 
fuch as indicate the vicinity of coal, and they excited no little 
expectation fome years that this ufeful foffil might be difco- 
vered here. Some feeble attempts towards a difcovery were 
made by the proprietor of one of thefe quarries, and a few a- 
cres around it ; but his finances were unequal to the expence, 
and he met with no fupport from the public. 

There are few places within the royalty, in which a quarry 
of fome kind may not eafily be found, fo that both ftone and flate 
are comparatively cheap ; but the expence of lime and wood, 
neither of which can be had but from the fea port towns or 
an equal diftance, will probably continue, with the high price 
of fuel, to obftrucl in fome meafure the growing profperity of 
this burgh, till wealth and the fpirit of enterprize fhall open 
a communication by water between it and the fea. 

In fpite of thefe difadvantages, however, Forfar is, and is 
likely to continue, a thriving place ; fituated in the centre of a 
well cultivated county, the feat of the court of juftice, the 
members of which at a moderate computation bring L. 1500

a year to the town ; the place of refort for the free-holders, 
not only for tranfacting the bufinefs of the country, but for 
the enjoyment of fociety in dubs, aflemblies, &amp;c. laying on a 
great road through the kingdom, and open by the turnpikes to 
a ready intercourfe with all her neighbours, pofiefied alfo of 
feveral fubftantial manufactures, conducted by men of fpirit 
and induftry, who daily ftretching out new paths of art and 
commerce, fhe muft rife, in the nature of things, to greater 
eminence than fhe has yet attained. 

Many things doubtlefs are necefiary to the accomplifhment 
of this defirable end. A well regulated police, and the fup- 
preffion of a multiplicity of ale-houfes, fo dangerous to the 
morals of the people, are particularly requifite. The clearing 
and lighting of the ftreets, and the introduaion of water in 
pipes, are alfo objefts worthy of attention, to which, it is hop- 
ed, in time, the people in power well apply their care It 

is alfo univerfally allowed, that nothing can contribute more 
i to the civil and religious interefts of any fociety, than a facred 
attention to the education of youth. And where the funds of 
a parifh admit of it, as well as thofe of this diftrift can, 
there ought to be at lcaft three eftablifhed fchools, one for La- 
tin-grammar, and the other learned or foreign tongues, one for 
Englifh folely, and one for writing and arithmetic. There are 
at prefent two eftablifhed fchools in Forfar, with tolerable ap- 
pointments, in each of which the mafter is permitted to teach 
all the branches of education promifcuoufly, a method calcu- 
lated to perplex himfelf and obftru.a the improvement of his 
pupils. The fchools about the middle of this century were in 
confiderable reputation ; but the town for many years paft has 
been rather unfortunate in the appointments made to thefe 
important offices. The magiftrates and council have, how- 
ever, of late taken fuch meafures as it is hoped fhall in fu- 
ture

ture fecure the good institution of youth, and raife the fchools 
to fome degree of celebrity *. 

The church, Gtuated near the centre of the town, has been 
rebuilt within thefe few years, on a plan calculated to contain 
2000 hearers. The fabric is elegant and commodious, but 
difgraced by the contiguity of the old-fteeple and fpire, the 
battlement of which it over-tops by 12 feet at leaft. 

The town houfe has alfo been lately rebuilt-, the front in 
the market place has an agreeable effedt, but the apartments 
for prifoners are dark, damp, and difmal, almoft excluded 
from the fun, and the free circulation of common air ; and 
the general utility of the whole fabric feems to have been fa- 
crificed to the attainment of one large upper room for public 
bufinefs and amufement. The cupola, alfo intended for an or- 
nament, conveys a mean idea of the genius of the archite®. 
It is evident, alas ! for the unhappy prifoner too evident, the 
genius of Howard fat not at his elbow, when he meditated 
this wretched defign. 

The flaughter houfe, lately in the very centre of the town, 
has been very properly removed to the north fide of it -, which* 
befides ridding the place ofanoifome and dangerous incum- 
brance, mull contribute to the health of the inhabitants. 

The air of Forfar may be faid in general to be falubrious 
occafional fogs arife from the lakes and low grounds in the 
neighbourhood, but have nothing particularly noxious in 
them. Epidemical diftempers fometimes appear, but they 
are not more fatal than in other neighbouring communities*

expected fome times to happen in places where the prejudice 
againft inoculation has not fubfided : this prejudice indeed, as 
well as other popular errors, daily lodes ground; and it is to 
be hoped that the fuccefs attending the practice of this impor- 
tant difcovery will make univerfal converts of the rifing gene- 
ration. In the cafe alluded to, the inoculated fmall pox was 
introduced late in the fpring, and children who had not been 
inoculated received the infection at the commencement of the 
fummer months, which, happening to be warmer than ufual, 
affifted in fpreading the contagion. There are many active 
lively men in Forfar between 70 and 80 years old, feveral up- 
wards of 80 years with all their faculties entire. One between 
90 and 100, who is beginning to feel the infirmities of age •, and 
there was one buried in July 1781 who had attained the age 
of 100 *. 

p oor% — The number of poor in the town is very confiderable ; 
they are fupported by money arifing from lands purchafcd with 
the donations of Meffirs Robert and William Strangs men- 
tioned in the preceding note, about the year 1654, amount- 
ing to about L 96 yearly ; and the money collected weekly at

* Of the antiquities of Forfar little can be faid, as its charters have 
been, for upwards of a century, conngned to oblivion by the hand of re- 
bellion and anarchy. A few trials of thofe unhappy women called witches, 
together with the bridle with which they were led to execution, are ftiU 
preferred as monuments of the fuperftltion of our fathers; and the field in 
which they fuffered is pointed out to (hangers as a curiofity. 

Among the memorials of the good, is juftly reckoned a very large bell, fent 
by Robert Strang merchant, in Stockholm as a tribute of refpeft to his native 
place ; and a table of donations to the poor, to which the faid Robert Strang 
and his brother W$»» contributed the principal (bare.

the church door, which with the interefts of certain favings in 
former times of plenty, amounts to about L. 100 yearly. Out 
of thefe fums, belides a monthly diftribution of about L- 6 or 
L. 7 and occafional fupplies in cafes of urgent neceffity, the 
poor are fumifhed with fhoes, clothing, and houfe rent — 
Since the fcarcity in the year 1783, when oat-meal was 2©s. 
per boll, through the . increafe of the number of poor and 
the rife of provifions, the funds which before were accummu- 
lating have been fcarcely adequate to the expenditure ; and 
new methods are now trying to render the fupply of the induf- 
trious poor more effectual, without increafing the burden of 
the community. The fa£t feems to be, that over grown cha- 
rity funds, are enemies to induftry, as they encourage the idle 
and improvident, to depend upon them as a fecurity againft 
want in the evening of life. And fo they will neither work 
nor fave. For many years preceding the year 1788, provifions 
were more eafily obtained by the poor, than now, by the 
great quantities of frelh fifh with which the market of Forfar 
was fupplied at very reafonable prices, by carriers who gained 
a livelyhood by bringing them almoft daily from the fea-port 
towns. A fupply which had its influence alfo on the .price of 
meat. But fmce the year 1 788 fifh have been very fcarce; the 
haddocks particularly have left our coafts entirely, and one great 
article for the fufofiftance of the poor, as well as a luxury for 
the rich, is withdrawn. 

There is a weekly market held in Forfar every Saturday ; it 
is well attended, and a great deal of country bufinefs is tranfac- 
ted there. A branch of the Dundee Banking Company, and 
one of the commercial Bank Company of Aberdeen, have been 
eftablifhed here for thefe two or three years, and both have 
fionfiderable employ *.

There are feveral well frequented fairs kept on the muir ad- 
joining .to the town ; the cuftom of one of them was purchaf- 
ed fome time ago from the Earl of Strathmore, and all make 
a confidevable addition to the revenue of the burgh. From Mar- 
tinmas to Candlemafs there is a weekly market on Wednefday, 
free of cuftom k , held on the ftreet for the fale of fat cattle ; and 
during the feed-time there is one weekly on the fame day for 
the fale of work ho.'fes, all of which are well frequented, and

as a great extent of country beyond it, .may be feen at one view. 
The weft end of this hill is the place of execution of« public 
juftice, and it is faid that it derives its name in the Gaelic, 
from the complaint of a Highland boy, ifollowing his grandfa- 
ther, who had forfeited his life to the jullice of his country.-"

• It is pe rhaps proper to take notice of the inconvenieii ce which afifes to

Rivers and Lakes.— There are no rivers in the parifli, and 
fcarce any ftream that deferves the name of a burn. Two 
trouting-rivers Lunan and Venny, indeed take their rife in 
this parifh but are both i neon fider able rills in fo far as conne&amp;ed 
with it. Such is the fcarcity of water, that of -8 mills in the pa- 
rim, fix are driven by water collefted from fmall fprings which 
in fummer do little execution, one is driven by wind, and 
another by a horfe. 

There were before the draining, three lakes in the parifh, 
Forfar, Reftenet, and Fithie ; all abounding in pike, perch and 
eel j and fince a communication has been opened by a drain 
between the Loch of Forfar and the river Dean, trout of a 
confiderable fize are fometimes taken ; but none of thefe fifh 
have been brought to maiket except eels, which fome time a- 
go were expofed in great numbers, taken in an ark at the out- 
let of Loch-Reftenet. 

The loch of Forfar, upwards of 20 years ago, was drain- 
ed of about 16 feet perpendicular depth of water. About a 
. mile in length and a quarter of a mile in breadth, of various 
depth, (from 2 to 22 feet in fummer), {till remains. No 
arable land has been gained by this draining, but a very confi- 
derable quantity of mofs and marie. A cubic yard and an half 
of folid mofs is fuppofed to produce a cart load of peats, valu- 
ed, as they He upon the bank, from 8d. to is- To this the ex- 
pence of digging, drying, and leading muft be added to make 
the full price, and that will be little fhort of the prime coft. 
Thofe who dig and dry them for fale, ufually charge the people 
in Forfar half a crown for a fmall cart load of dried peats laid 
down at the door. The boll of marie, confiding of 8 cubic 
feet, brings 8d. to the proprietor, out of which he pays id. for 
digging or i-£d. for dragging ; for they not only dig for the 
marie at the recovered land, but heave it from the bottom of 
the, lake by a machine, fuch as is ufedfor clearing the channel

of the Thames ; and this operation requires the labour of throe 
men, each of whom in good weather will make from 2od. to 
2s. per day. The marie is an excellent manure for the im- 
provement of wade lands, and anfwers well in compoft 
for mod of the ground in this country ; the rapid improvement 
of which is to be dated from its difcovery. It is of two 
kinds, both produced from {hells and both equally good, but 
differing very materially in their confiftency. Both of them 
form, in a fhort time, a dry and apparently folid mafs, and one 
fpecies continues fo, though carried to a diftance, like flacked 
lime •, the other by agitation of the .carriage becomes in a man- 
mer liquid, and cannot without a very clofe cart be conveyed 
to any confiderable diftance. 

The draining of the lake coft Lord Strathmore about 
L. 3000, and it has yielded him from L. 500 to L. ^00 per an- 
num, but both the mofs and the marie are now nearly exhauf- 
ted ; and fome years hence, perhaps, the drain being neglec- 
ted, the loch may again rife to its antient boundaries *. 

Loch- 

* Before this loch was drained, and near the north fide of it, th»rc was aa 
artificial ifiand compofed of large piles of oak and loofe (tones, with a ftratuni 
©f earth above, on which are planted fome afpin and floe trees, fuppofed to 
have been a place of religious retirement for Queen Margaret. This now 
forms a very curious peninfula. The veftiges of a building, probably a place 
•f worflrip, are ftill to be feen. And it is likely there might be fome accom- 
modation too for the occafional refidence of the prieft of the place, as the re- 
mains of an oven were difcernible not many years ago, and alfo fomething of 
the furniture of a pleafure garden. It appears that the loch has at fome pe- 
riod furrounded the fifing ground called the manor, and the adjacent lull on 
w hich the caftle of Forfar flood ; which hill is not, as the authors of the En- 
cyclopedia Britannicafuppofe, artificial, but a congeftum of fandandfat clay, 
evidently difpofed in various irregular ftrata by the hand of nature. Befuks 
the filh above mentioned, the loch is frequented by water fowl of various kinds 
and in the months of July and Auguft. About fun fet it is infefted, or rather 
filhersupon it are plagued, by flics of the gnat kind, which faften in great 
numbers on every part of their clothes, and leaving their (kins, fly off fport.ve a*

Loch Reftenet, the property of George Dempfter Efq. of 
Dunnichen, has been lately drained. The extent of ground 
recovered does not exceed 200 acres, yet the value of the 
mofs and marie has been computed at above L. 50,000. In- 
deed the marie is fuppofed to be inexhauftible. Upon the S. 
W. fide of this lake, and almoft furrounded by it, flood the pri- 
ory and the parifh church, the ruins of which {till remain. There 
is alfo (landing in a pretty entire ftate, a very neat fteeple 
and fpire built of ftone and run-lime with a fort of fineering of 
poliflied afher. This is faid to have been a dependency of the 
monaftery of Jedburgh, where their valuable papers and ef- 
fects were kept, as a place of fafety from the depredations of 
the Englifh borderers. *, 

Loch-Pithie, a little to the S. of Loch-Reftenet, a beauti- 
ful little fheet of water is alfo the property of George Demp- 
fter Efq.— It has little, if any, either of mofs or marie in it, 
but abounds in pike and perch. It is about a mile in circum- 
ference, of various breadths, and furrounded by a beautiful rifing 
bank, which conceals the profpect of the lake till one comes 
juft upon it, and heightens the delight of the wanderer with 
unexpected pleafure. The banks are adorned with common firs» 
larch and fpruce trees, in fome places agreeably intermixed and 
well {locked with fmging birds. Every thing in this fpot con-

gay. Its worthy owner has lately erected a handfome cot-

mer-day with his friends. 

Woods  Rent, &amp;c. — On fever al eftates in the parifh, as well 
as on the property of the burgh, are thriving plantations of fir 
from 20 to 30 years old, and it is generally fuppofed that an 
acre of thriving fir trees 30 years old, would bring its proprie- 
tor at leaft 20s. for every year of its growth, after paying all 
expences. This is certainly turning wafte lands (and fuch in 
general are the lands on which fir thrive bed here) to very 
good account ; befides that by the annual fhtdding of the leaves 
the foil is enriched, and rendered fitter for the purpofes of a- 
griculture when the woods are cut down. — There are 10 he- 
ritors in the parifh, of whom 4 refide ; and there is befides a 
fmall eftate belonging to the poor of the burgh. The valued 
rent of the whole parifh is L. 25 S 7 : 19 Scotch, and the real 
rent is probably about as much fterling *. 

There are 3 large farms which bring about L. 200 of rent 
and upwards, three that give about L. 100, 11 or 12 from 
L.40 to L. 100 and the reft are fmall pofleffions occupied in 
general by weavers and other artifts ; for weavers in the coun- 
try part of the parifh, as well as in the town, form the molt 
confiderable body of labourers. A weaver in the country, in 
general, has as much land as will maintain a cow or two, and 
fometimes a horfe, throughout the year ; and on moft eftates 
in the parifh, are little villages peopled chiefly by tenants 
of this defcription, who join their horfes together to form a 

plough. 

* There is a confiderable part of the landward parifh actually within the 
royalty, the property of the community or of individuals who have feued 
from it, and confequently not comprehended in the above ftatement and va, 
iua^ion cf the county lands.

The mode of cultivation after ley is, in general, tit, a crop of 
oats; adly, lint or oats; 3 dly, barley with dung; 4 thly, turnips 
or fome other green crop ; and sthly, barley with grafs feeds, 
which remain four or five years under hay and pafture. This 
praaice differs, however, with foil and fsafon and other cir- 
cumftances, and can hardly be obferved by the tackfmen of 
fmall pendicles, though every one of them has a part of his 
fmall poffeffion in grafs, turnips and potatoes, which laft is 
much cultivated throughout all the parifli, and forms an excellent 
fuccedaneum for meal and a (landing difh on the tables of 
the rich and the poor. 

The lands in general will yield from the fifth to-the feventh 
return. Harveft is feldom reaped within three months after 
fow'mg,and in fome years, particularly in the fouth part of the 
parifli, which is very wet, it is much later. Agriculture, 
however, in its improvements, is keeping pace in this part of 
the country with manufactures. The fields are regularly laid 
out, inclofures are multiplying, and rents are double and tre- 
ble what they were twenty or thirty years ago. One farm in 
particular, which let for a Leafe of 30 years at about L. 50, has 
lately been let at between L. 300 and L. 400, and is (till 
thought a good bargain *. 

3X2 Population 
* On fome of the eflates in the parifli, the exadtion of bondage-fervice is 
(till in life ; and befid;:s the ftipulated rent in money or grain, fome tenants 
pay poultry and pigs, and mull leave their own work at the landlord's call, to 
affiit in ploughing; harrowing, cutting the corn, calling peats.'driving coal and 
other errands and carriages, in hay time and harveft, and at any other time of 
the year. This is indeed agreeable to bargain, and the. number of thefe fer- 
vices is ufually fpecified and valued in the leafes ; but they are generally as un- 
popular as impolitic, and accordingly begin to be omitted in new contracts of 
leafe. Mill thiilage alfo exifts in this parifli and is confidered as a grievance. 
About 60 years ago, a principal farm fcrvant might have been had for 35s.

From the preceding ftatement of the population, it would

Mifcellaneous Obfervatiom.— The poor in the country pa- 
rifh are few, only about 8 or 10 very old or difeafed indivi- 
duals claim the aid of the funds, and they are well fupplied at 
their houfes out of the weekly collections at the church, and 
the intereft of accumulated collections in former years of 
plenty. — They have alfo a few acres of land, purchafed by 
fuch contributions, as a referve againft years of fcarcity. All 
the above amount to more than L. 4c fterling. There is not 
a beggar in the country parifh, and only about five or fix be- 
longing to the town, who are furnifhed by the kirk treafurer 
with a permiflion-ticket, to diftinguifh them from ftrangers 
and vagrants. 

About half a century ago the population of the town and 
country parifh feems to have been nearly equal, the difpropor- 
tion between them now will appear from the foregoing table.

there is an addition of near iooo inhabitants to the town. The 
chief caufes of this increafe have been already pointed out. 

The inhabitants of both town and country fliare alike the 
praife of induftry, economy, and hofpitality. If fewer inftances 
of intemperance, impurity, and prodigality appear in the coun- 
try than in the town in proportion to the number in each, it is 
perhaps chiefly, becaufe fimplicity of manners is lefs liable to 
corruption in the former than in the latter, from a multiplicity 
of low ale-houfes, thefe feminaries of impiety and diflipation — 
The farmers and manufacturers in the former, however, have 
experienced a change in their drefs and expenditure as percep- 
tible as what has taken place among the inhabitants of the 
burgh. 

The parifhiemers are in general attached to the religious e- 
ftablifhment of the kingdom. A fmall fociety of Epifcopalians 
and another of Seceders form the fum of the fe&amp;aries — A fpi- 
rit of enquiry and a tafte for reading is fpringing up, and po- 
pular fuperftitions begin to hide their heads. The fub- 
fcriptions to the Encyclopedia Britannica, the Bee, and feveral 
peiiodical and othe* ' publications, fcientific, religious, moral 
and political, are more numerous of late than could well have 
been expefted and they already fhed an evident luftre on tru

Extent and Population. 

HADDINGTON, the county town of Eaft Lothian, is 
fituated about 17 miles eaft from Edinburgh, and is 
the firft ftage on the great poft road from thence to London. 
\ The word Haddington feems evidently to be of Saxon origin. 
The greateft extent of the parifti is 6 miles from E. to W. and 
about the fame length from S. to N. The river Tyne runs 
through it fromE.toW. and nearly divides it into two equal parts. 
It contains about 12,000 acres of land, and 3915 inhabitants ; 
of thefe 2055 refide in the burgh of Haddington, 512 in the 
fuburbs called Nungate and GifFordgate, and 1348 in the 
country. The parifh was more populous about the end of 

laft 

' This account is abridged from a very complete, intelligent, and fatisfatlo- 
ry hiflory of Haddington parifh, publifhed in the firft volume of the Tranfac-

obfervations, communicated by the fame author, arc incorporated with the

laft century than at prefent. It appears from the regifter of 
baptifms, that the number of births, taking them at an average 
for 7 years preceeding 1684, amounted annually to 199, which 
fuppofes a population of about 6000 inhabitants. This de- 
cline of population is chiefly to be afcribed to the engrofling 
of farms, for it is an undoubted fa£t, that the inhabitants of 
the town have increafed within the laft 40 years. The return 
to Dr. Webfter in 1755, however, amounting only to 3975 
fouls, it would appear, that the total decreafe, fince that pe- 
riod, has not been confiderable. It is farther to be remarked, 
that in 1692 the parifh of Gladfmuir was etedted, which was 
made up of lands taken from the parifhes of Haddington, Tra- 
nent, and Aberlady, and that the lands taken from Haddington 
now contains from 500 to 600 fouls. 

Soil, Rent, — The weftern part of the parifh confifts of 
a large tra£t of muirifh ground of about 1000 acres, called 
Gladfmuir, formerly poflefled by the burgh as a commonty. 
The rulers of the burgh were advifed about 60 years ago to 
inclofe and plant it, and had they done fo it muft have yield- 
ed a confiderable revenue j but inftead of complying with this 
advice, it was feued out in fmall parcels to favourite citizens, 
who after all were generally lofers by their grants; for after 
expending a good deal of money in inclofing, liming &amp;c. the 
lands for the moft part proved fterile and unproduaive. On 
the failure of the original feuars, great part of the commonty 
has been acquired by Mr. Buchan of Lecham,_ who has plant-

about the beginning of the laft century by the Earl of Hadding- 
ton, and is now the property of the Earl of Hopetoun. The Park 
of Leithington contains about 400 acres, formerly furrounded 
with a ftone wall 12 feet in height, the work of John Duke 
of Lauderdale ; and was occafioned by the Duke of York telling 
him before his firft journey to Scotland, that he heard there 
was not fo much as a park in Scotland ; a few years ago Lord 
Blantyre reduced the height to feven feet. Amisfield parks 
contain about 700 acres, and are efteemed the beft pafturei 
grounds in the county 5 

The whole of the parifh is arable, except a few hundred a- 
cres of the fummit of the ridge called Garleton-hills, and a T 
bout the fame extent of woodlands on Gladfmuir and the ef- 
tate of Coalftown. So extenfive a tracl: as this parifh, muft 
naturally be fuppofed to be compofed of a variety of different 
foils, which is the cafe v The whole diftricl, however, is in 
a ftate of high cultivation, and all inclofed, except a few fields 
in the neighbourhood of the burgh, which being either bur- 
gage lands, or let by the neighbouring heritors to labourers 
and other poor people, are fometimes managed in a very flo- 
venly manner. There are 109 plou.ghgates of land in che pa- 
rifh, divided into 30 farms. The valued rent is L« 14,645 
Scotch, and the real rent, including the lands in the natural 
poffeffion of the proprietors, above L. 8000 fterling. Lands 
near the town are generally rented at L. 3 to 50s* per acre, 
whilft others of equal quality, at the diftance of two miles from 
the burgh, do not fetch a third part of that rent* The price 
of provifions is nearly the fame as in Edinburgh, and the price 
of labour juM the fame as in the neighbourhood of that city. The 
air is temperate and ferene, confequently healthful; inftances of 
longevity are- frequently to be met with. A very extraordi- 
nary iaftance occured in one family, Mr. Alexander Maitland 
and Catharine Cunningham were married Auguft 6th 1657;

The ages of nine of the children of the marriage amounted to 
no lefs than 738 years. Another thing remarkable of this 
marriage is, that the 18th year of it produced trines, and the 
21ft twins. The ages of the trines amounted to 256. The 
fa£t is afcertained beyond all poflibility of doubt, for it was 
communicated to' the writer of this account by Mr Robert Keith, 
a gentleman of the ftri£left probity, and himfelf fon to one of 
the trines. 

Town. — Haddington is undoubtedly a burgh of great anti- 
quity, for in a charter of Ada widow of Prince Henry, fon 
of David I. foundrefs of the abbey, fhe (tiles Haddington meum 
burgum ; it is governed by a provoft, two merchant bailies, one 
trades bailie, a dean of guild, a treafuref, eleven merchant 
counfellors, one trades counfellor, and feven deacons of crafts. 
The revenues of the town amount to about L. 400 per annum, 
arifing chiefly from the rent of the mills, petty cuftoms, feu 
duties of Gladfmuir, &amp;c. The town confifts of four fteeets, 
interfering each other nearly at right angles ; the only pub- 
lic buildings belonging to the burgh of any confequence, are 
the town houfe and fchool houfe, the former built from a 
defign of the late William Adam, Efq. in 1748, and the lat- 
ter, which is large and commodious, contains excellent acco- 
modation for boarders. There are two fairs held annually, 
one in July, and one in Oaober, but neither of them are 
much frequented. There is alfo a weekly market held on 
Friday, reckoned the gveateft in Scotland for all kinds of 
grain *. For feveral centuries paft, a fpecies of coarfe wool- 
ens have been manufactured here, and many weavers, parti- 
cularly in the Nungate, ftffl make them ; but the number of 
perfons employed in this branch is greatly diminifhed of late.

During the time of Cromwell's ufurpation, an Englifh Com- 
pany, of which Colonel Stanfield was the principal perfon 
expended a very confiderable fum of money in eftablilhing a 
manufaaory of fine woollen cloaths. For this purpofe, they 
purchafed fome lands formerly belonging to the monaftery of 
Haddington, ereded fulling mills, dying houfes, &amp;c. and 
called the name of the place New-mills. After the refla- 
tion, byfeveral Scotch ads of parliament, the Company, for 
their encouragement, were exempted from fome taxes, and 
Colonel Stanfield had the honour of knighthood conferred on 
him. After his death the manufaftory declined, and the af- 
fairs of the Company going into diforder, Colonel Charteris 
purchafed their lands and houfes, and changed the name from 
Newmills to Amisfield, in honour of the very antient family 
in Nithfdale, of which he was defcended. A Company was 
eftablifhed in 1750 for carrying on the woollen manufactory, 
and a large fum was fubfcribed ; but the trade proving un- 
fuccefsful, the Company dhTolved, and a new one formed, 
which alfo in its turn was diffolved a few years ago. 

Religious Heufes.—The abbey of Haddington was fituated 
about a mile to the eaftward of the burgh, where there is Hill 
a little village called the abbey, but the monaftery itfelf is al- 
moft entirely demolifhed. It was founded A. D. 1 178, by A- 
fla mother of Malcolm IV. and William the Lion, kings of 
Scotland, and dedicated to the Virgin Mary. The foundrefs 
and others enriched it with many temporal lands, teinds, and 
other benefactions. The revenues at the time of the Refor- 
mation, as appears from many charters, as likewife from the 
books of aflumption in the Advocates Library, were very con- 
fiderable. It was foon after erected into a Lordfhip, in favour 
of John Mafter of Lauderdale. It was at this abbey that par- 
liament was conveened July 7th 1548, during the fiege of 

Haddington,

Haddington, which gave confent to Queen Mary's marriage 
with the Dauphin, and her education at the court of France. 

The parifti church is a large and venerable ftruclure •, it 
was formerly the church of the Erancifcan monaftery ; from 
the ftile of architecture, it appears to have been built in the 
12th, or r3th century. Only the weftern part is ufed for 
public worfhip ; the remainder of the fabric is unroofed, and 
going faft to ruin. The patronage of this collegiate charge is 
in the Earl of Hopetoun. — In the town is a very elegant cha- 
pel, for thofe of the Epifcopal communion, built A. D. 1765, 
to which the prefent Earl of Wemyfs was a very liberal fub- 
fcriber, having contributed in all about L. 400, nearly one 
half of the expence of the building. 

Haddington has fuffered frequently from fire, and from 

the inundations of the Tyne, which in Odr. 4. 1775, rofe 17 

feet perpendicular, continued in this {late feveral hours, and 

then gradually fubfided. The manfion houfe of Clerkington, 

and the beautiful Chinefe bridge over the river were imme- 

* 'J 

diately fwept away. The whole fuburb of Nungate, and 
more than half of the town were laid under water. The in- 
habitants were obliged to abandon their houfes, and take 
fanftuary in the fields. Had it happened in the night time, 
many muft have perifhed; but happily no lives were loft. 
This inundation was owing to\he burfting of a water fpout 
on Lammer muir, for the day was not very rainy.

Stipends.— The ftipend of the ift minifter is 48 bolls of 
wheat, 48 bolls of barley, and L. 4 1 : 1 5 : Sterling of mo- 
ney, including L. 8 : 6 : 8d. for communion elements. The 
ftipend of the fecond minifter is 16 bolls of wheat, 32 bolls of 
barley, and L. 50 Sterling of money. Both minifters have 
manfes and glebes, but the firft minifter's glebe is but a very 
fmall one, amounting only to three acres and a half.

Schools.— There is no legal parochial fchool The falaries of 
the teachers of public grammar, and' Englifli fchools in Had- 
dington, are paid wholly by the town council out of the reve- 
nue of the burgh. The falary of the reaor of the grammar 
fchool is 400 merks Scots ; and the falary of the mailer of the 
Englifli fchool, to which the office of mafic matter is conjoin- 
ed, is about L. 1 5 Sterling. 

State of the Poor.— The money expended for the mainte- 
nance of the poor is under the management of a committee of 
1 1 confiding of the two minifters, 3 chofen annually by the 
heritors, 3 by the town council, and 3 by the kirk feffion. The 
money required for this purpofe, amounted about 40 years a- 
go, only to about L. 100 Sterling annually, of which the heri- 
tors of the landward parifti gave L. 40 Sterling, the burgh 
L. 30 Sterling, and the kirk feflion L. 30 ; but the expence 
has been fince gradually increafing, and amounted laft year 
(1791) to above L. 27oSterling. The number of weekly 
penfioners is about 130, befides many others who receive oe- 
cafional charity from the kirk feflion. 

The increafe of the number of poor in this place, is 
in a great degree owing to the prevailing cuftom amongft the 
heritors and farmers in the county preferving no cottagers, un- 
lefs fu'ch as are abfolutely neceflary for perfons employed in 
cultivating their farms ; this drives many of the aged and in- 
firm into town, where, after a few years refidence, they claim 
a legal maintenance. If the number of perfons who refort to 
this county from the Highlands as reapers, continues to dimi- 
nifh in the fanpe proportion as it has done for feveral years 
paft, our landholders and farmers will feel the baneful ef- 
fects of this piece of ceconomy, when it is too late.

Rends.— The pod road is fupported by the money raifed at 
the different toll bars, which are this year fet for L. 981 Ster- 
ling. The bye roads are repaired by the ftatute labour, un- 
der the direction of the heritors of the parifhes where they 
are fituated. By act of parliament, the truftees have power to 
convert the ftatute work into money •, the compofition ufually 
taken is 20s Sterling for each ploughgate of land, and is 6d 
from each houfeholder who poffeffes a houfe not under 20s of 
rent ; but though this amounts to a very confiderable fum, yet 
many of the bye roads are in very bad repair, owing to the na- 
ture of the foil, which is generally clayey, and to the great 
fcarcity of materials in many parts of the county. 

Mijcellaneous Obfervations. — John Knox, the famous refor- 
mer, was a native of Haddington ; the houfe in the Gifford- 
gate, in which he was born, ftill remains. The illiiftrious fa- 
mily of Maitland was for many ages feated at Leithington, in 
this parifh, where the famous Duke of Lauderdale was born 
in 1616; feveral of that family are interred in Haddington 
church, particularly John Maitland, baron of Thirlftane, Lord 
High Chancellor of Scotland, whofe monument is graced 
with an epitaph, compofed by his royal mafter James VI. 
Amisfield houfe, in this parifh, the property of the «Earl of 
Wemyfs, is a capital modern building, the body is 109 feet in 
length by 77 in depth j the gallery contains many fine paint- 
ings, fome of them by the firft mailers : particularly Ver-

has been offered 800 guineas *.

Population and Agriculture. 

THE parilhof Strathbrok orUphallf, contains 31 20 Scotch, 
or 3922^ Britifli ftatute acres. The return to Dr. 
Webfter from hence in 1755 was 690 fouls. The number of 
inhabitants in 1778, by an actual numeration, amounted to 
583 ; and in 1781 to 600, and fcems likely to increafe. The 
foil is in general a rich mouldering clay on a tilly bot- 
tom ; but the lower fields are covered with fome inches of rich 
loam, or intermixed with it. 178 acres are planted with fir, 
oak, fpruce and larix. About 60 acres require a four horfe 
plough, and there are 45 ploughs of this fort in the parifh. 
No longer ago than 1768 much of it was divided in the baneful 

way

way of runrig. Very little fummer fallow was pra&amp;ifed ; Mill lefs 
of artificial graffes fown ; inclofing neither practifed nor ap- 
proved of by the hufbandmen ; and the general ftate of agri- 
culture lower than one could have imagined fo near a great 
city fuch as Edinburgh, from which the medium diftance is 
no more than 1 1 meafured miles. The method Lord Buchan 
took of introducing a better method, was giving leafes for 19 
years, putting an end to runrig, mowing examples of fummer 
fallow, ftraighting ridges, cleaning, artificial grafies, rolling 
of grafs feeds, and barley ftirr, inclofing, draining ; all thefe 
are now practifed by the hufbandmen more or lefs, and they 
have tailed the fruits of it. The endurance of leafes now are 
38 and 3 1 "years for inclofing, and 19 or 21 where already in- 
clofed ; a good deal of wheat is grown in the parifh, and it is 
very fit for that grain j the barley alfo and the beans are ex- 
cellent ; the foil is rather too wet and ftrong for turnip and 
peafe. 

Rent.— The belt inclofed land lets for 30s. an acre, good 
inclofedland 25s. an acre overhead, middling uninclofed land 
25s. the word 8s. and 9s. excluding muir, of which there is 
not above 40 or 50 acres. The valued rent of the parifh i3 
L. 4262 Scotch. 

Sheep, Exports, CsY.— Sheep are not much in ufe, becaufe 
there are few ftone fences, and the plantations are young. 
Oxen are not fo much ufed as formerly, nor as much as they 
ought to be. The nearnefs of the parifh to Edinburgh occa- 
fioning much cart work, and oxen not being fo fit for that 
fort of labour. Large quantities of milk, butter, eggs and 
poultry are carried into that city ; and, what is remarkable, 
it is but lately fince the people fell upon the expedient of ufing

ing of 50 per cent.

and confequentlydear; the Scottifh pine does not thrive fo 
well as the oak, afh, and beech, The great willow thrives 
wonderfully, and is an ufeful tree for many country purpofes. 

Roads. -The high roads are fupported by the ftatute labour 
and fubfcription; the ftatute labour amounts to 15s. per plough; 
at an average a plough pays L.45 of rent. The materials for the 
roads are a Jpecies of bafalt rock, which runs in a ridge from 
N. W. to S. E. in the parifh, and is excellent for that pur- 
pofe. A chain Of good road may be formed and laid 24 feet 
broad for about 24s. and finifhed off at 28 s. 

Minerals— In the parifh are a colliery, two free ftone quar-

feams of coal ; two lime quarries, but not wrought at prefent,' 
whin- ftone, bafalts, flate-ftdne, fome coarfe fullers earth, pot- 
ters-clay, brick-clay, coarfe red chalk, ftone- marie* and fmall 
quantities of {hell marie. The coal is of excellent quality, rai- 
fed at a moderate expence, and fold at 5s. and 6s. per toil, 
From 10 to 12 pickmen are employed in this colliery.'

miles eaft of Edinburgh. The parifh is bounded on the N. W. 
by the fea, on the S. by Gladfmuir and Haddington, and on 
the E. by Haddington and Dirleton pariflies, being fepara- 
ted from the laft by the water of Peffer, which falls into A- 
berlady bay at Luffntfs point. From this point the whole bay 
between Aberlady and Gulan fhores is left dry at low water 
for near two miles. At fpring tides, veffels of 60 or 70 ton3 
may come up the Peffer to within a few hundred yards of 
Aberlady, and lie perfectly fafe upon a foft clay bottom, if 
properly fecured by anchors againft the N. E. wind. Along 
the fhore from Aberlady to the weftmoft part of the parifh, 
runs a track or border of links or fandy ground, of con- 
siderable breadth, abounding with rabbits.

Soil and 5//r/^.-Within this border, for a conGderable way, 
the foil is, for the moft part light, with a mixture of loam; 
but the middle part of the parifh, almoft from the E. to the 
W extremity of it is generally poor, flat, fandy, and partly 
liable to be flooded during heavy rains. From this flat, the 
.round rifes gradually toward the S. being part of that fertile 
bank of land which extends from Fawfyde to Whitekirk 
The landed property of this parifh, exclufive of a fmall part of 
Redhoufe, is divided into four baronies, Aberlady, Gosford, 
Balncrieff, Luffnefs. 

Population.— The whole of that landed property, exclufive 
of fome inclofures about the houfes of Balncrieff and Gof- 
ford, and a few acres belonging to feuars in Aberlady, is pof- 
fefled by eight farmers. The farms are large, which is un- 
friendly to population. The village of Gosford is entirely de- 
ftroyed, and that of Balncrieff falling into decay. The return to 
Dr. Webfter in 1755, however, was only 739 fouls. By an 
accurate enquiry very lately made, from houfe to houfe, the 
number of fouls was found to be precifely 800, of which 
number 386 were in the village of Aberlady. At an average 
of births and marriages for the laft 25 years, there have been 
exactly 4 births to each marriage. 

Parochial Funds.— -There are no charity funds or mortified 
money in the parifh, except 1600 merksby Sir Peter Wedder- 
burn of Gosford ; the yearly intereft of which is ordered to be 
paid to backgone tenants, and others on thefe lands. The

Mifccllancous Obfervotions. — The valued rent of the parifh, 
amounts to L. 7445 : 6 : 8d. Scotch — The old church of A- 
berlady was a difgrace to the parifh ; it meafured 100 feet in 
length, by i6£ feet in breadth, and was betwixt 10 and 1 1 
feet in height ; the walls were partly built of mud, and the 
floor was fome feet lower than the furface of the ground 
without. In 1773 tne heritors built a very commodious 
church, adjoining to which are two ailes, in one of which is 
a monument to the memory of Lady North and Grey, wife 
of Patrick Lord Eiibank, witfii an infcription compofed by his

JL Wandcl. The firft belonging to Lady Rofs Baillie, 
and the other to Lord Douglas of Douglas ; and both prefent 

to the kirk of Lamington, to which Wandel is annexed 

Lamington is perhaps contrafted for Lambington, a place, of

We chufe for our habitation an high and open place, and in 
which there is much free air ; whereas they preferred a clofe 
and confined place, and low in fituation. Thus the old manfe 
or clergyman's houfe in Lamington, was lower and nearer the 
burn running through the town, than it is now ; hence it may 
be taken for granted, that they of old were for the moft part, if 
not always, more healthful than we now are ; and of courfe, 
did not fo much mind and perceive the want of the free air, 
as we do. 

Extent, Rivers, &amp;c. — The extent of this parifh is about 9 
miles in length, meafuring it as lying on the Clyde, and fup- 
pofed to be between 3 or 4 miles in breadth, taking the adja- 
cent hills into the account. Its form refembles a rectangle, or 

oblong figure, whofe oppofite fides are equal. The parilh is 

fituated on the eaft fide of the Clyde and bordering on it. 

This river Clyde which gives name to Clydefdale, takes its 
rife from an hill called Clydeilaw in the parilh of Crawford, 
and about 9 or 10 miles diftant from Cold Chapel at the head 
of this parifh. There are 10 burns or rivulets in the parifh, 
6 in. Wandel, and 4 in Lamington.— There may be feveral mi- 
neral waters of great life, if found out. One attributed to a 
faint, is called St. Innian's Well, and lies a little above the 
town of Lamington. It is faid that flate is found in the hills 
of Lamington j and fome years ago, feavch was made for coal 
about Hartfide in Wandel, but failed in the trial. In the fame 
place alfo, lead was fought for, but the attempt did not fucceed. 

Woods, bV— There were antiently many woods in this pa- 
rifh, not only about Lamington and in the mains, but alfo about 
Wandel, and in Woodend, or Devonfhaw, and downwards 
to Hartfide andBraehead, or Devonfhaw- hill, which grew all 
the way up the bank, of the Clyde, for the fpace of 2 miles

or more. Devonfhaw is the fame with Woodend in the 
Celtic. And Hartfide may be fo named from Harts, which 
animals may have been formerly plentiful in the woods, which 
then abounded.— The trees now remaining in Lamington, there 
being few or none in Wandel, are principally the beech, afh, 
elm, alder, plane, and fir. — There are no thorn hedges here 
except in the glebes of Wandel and Lamington, in the ridges 
adjoining to the latter in the high road below Loanhead, and 
about yards and gardens. For this neglect two reafons are 
given, firft, that the hedges gather flocks of birds, to eat up 
the grain ; and fecondy, that when the grounds are inclofed 
there is not fo much open air, to wind their corn after it is cut 
down, and to make it ready to be led into the barn yard, in a 
country like this, incompaffed about with hills and high 
grounds, and confequently liable to wet weather *. 

There is a beautiful and pleafant fpot of ground fituated 
■ on the Clyde, at Whitehall, improved at a great expence, by 
drains in a long and ftraight ditch fee about with willows about 
a mile or upwards-- — There is fcarcely a garden, which de- 
fences the name, as being almoft without flowers, and having 
little or no fruits excepting gcoft berries, currants, and black- 
berries. Not only the farm houfe's have a fmall fpot of 

ground on which are fet plants and herbs, but alfo every cot- 
tage almoft has a kail yard. 

Extent , Rent, bfc — The acres in the barony of Lamington

ago. The decreafe is owing to the union of farms in the baro- 
ny of Wandel. 

Jgricult:r,-e, Soil, &amp;c.—Therczrehere,7is\n other places, fome 
good farmers. In cultivating poor ground, they make folds 
for the fheep in the night, to enrich it wich their dung ; and 
there too they are milked lor butter and cheefe, the laft of 
•vyhichxs not. a little prized by thofe who know it. 

In wet grounds they make drains to carry off the water, and 
prepare it for tillage ; and they have as good crops on it as in 
other places. In the neighbourhood of Wifton, on the other 
fide of the Clyde, there is plenty of lime, which fome bring, 
and lay on ley ground that has been grafs, and as they fay 
refted for 3 or 4 years, on which are good crops for 2 years, but the 
3d. is not fogood; andthey bring in the ground,as they exprefs it, 
by fowingon itnowand then ryegrafs andclover,as in other partf. 
There is no fuch thing pradifed here as fallowing ; but inftead 
of that they take a crop of potatoes with the plough, which they 
think is better than dibbling and covering them with a 
fpade. And fome have introduced the fowing of turnips for 

the cows, and manuring the ground The foil varies ; in 

fome parts it is dry, thin, light or gravelly, and (hallow; in 
fome, wet, heavy and clayey, and in others, thick and deep. 
It is generally too ftrong for an Englifh plough of two horfes, 
and therefore 3 or 4 horfes, and fometimes 2 horfes, and 2 
oxen or cows are ufually yoked in a plough—There is here, 
as in other parts, a change of grain, fuch as bear or barley, 
oats, peafeand beans, but no wheat is raifed. They begm 
to fow peafe and oats about the middle or end of March, and 
banning of April i and barley about the end of April and 
beginning of May, and when they have done with the former 
and before they enter upon the latter, they fet potatoes of

ficient to maintain them through the winter and fpring. The 
crops are generally late, harveft is begun about the end of 
Auguft or beginning of September, and it is not finifhed till 
the middle or end of Oftober and fometimes it is a week or 
two in November, before all is cut down and brought into the 
barn-yard. The farmers are moft afraid of rotting rains and 
nipping frofts; in confequence of which it is here much the 
praaice of fowing early corn in the fpring, and it is not to be 
omitted mentioning, that every family fows a quantity of 
flax or lint- feed. Thus a large houfe fows a peck or an half \ 
and a fmall cap full, u e. a forpet or fourth part of a peck *. 

Climate.— The air is fometimes moift, and fometimes dry. 
This being an hilly and mountainous part of the country, it is 
much expofed to rain in the fummer, and fnow in the winter) 
but, notwithftanding thefe changes, it is not a little healthful to 
the prelent inhabitants, they being accuftomed to them. The 
climate here is generally (harp and cold, and that becaufe the 
places toward Crawford-muir and the Lead-hills are exceed- 
ing high, and it varies in different parts as they are more or 
lefs elevated.— It isfaid, thatfromCold Chapel, there is nearly

meat through the year; and at harveft a man reaper has iod a day, and his

Schools, Eccleftajlical State, fcsV.— There are 2 fchools in this 
parifli, onepublickat Lamington, and another private at Wan- 
del ; the former was new built in 1788* — The mailer's fa- 
lary is only L. 100 Scotch, and what little more he may make 
by teaching. And the falary of the fchool-mafter in Wandel, 
is only L. 2. : 5 : 6^-. fterling. 

The ftipend confifts of L. 43 : 12 : 6d. from Wandel baro- 
ny; L. 14 : 12 : 6d. from Lamington barony ; 16^ bolls of oat- 
meal; 7! bolls of bear; and in all about L. 74. fterling in 1792. 
The glebe confifts of ten acres, four in Lamington, and fix 
in Wandel ; and the latter lies adjacent to two parks belong- 
ing to Lady Rofs Bailie ; between 6 and 7 acres are let to the 
minifter at L. 1 : 15s. an acre. 

There is in this parifh no tax for the poor, their mainte- 
nance depends upon the charity of others ; the colleaions in 
the church on the fabbath day, before the difmifling of the 
congregation ; and on other days by baptifms, marriages, and 
burials, by, mortcloth, bell, and litter; and a little flock 
which the kirk-feffion has laid out on intereft.-AU thefe put 
together amount to but afmall pittance, or fcanty allowance, 
diftributed to each at the rate of i8d, 2s, and 2S 6d a month; 
but thofein more diftrefling and neceflitous circumftances may,

one's moiety or portion. There are now 9 on the roll. What 
a pity is it, and matter of grief to the poor, that the heritors 
do not refide in the parim !* 

Dlfeafes.— The difeafes incident to this parim, and mod pre- 
valent, are, intermitting fevers, rheumatifm, EryGpelas or St. 
Anthony's Fire, and the dropfy ; colds and coughs are fre- 
quent here; confumptions of late years have carried off feve- 
ral young perfons of both fexes between 10 and 20 years of. 
age. The fmall pox is not now fo dangerous as it formerly 
has been. In 1787 there were in the parim between 20 and 
30 inoculated, and they all recovered; and in the year 1792 
about as many, who in like manner all did well. 

Mifcellanesus 

* There is a Roman camp at White-Hill, near Culter, at one end of the 
ariih in Lamington ; at the other end of it in Wandel, at Cold Chapel, tlnere 
aie two Roman camps, one on the road-fide between Cold Chapel and Little 
Gill, and the other on the Arbor-hill, fo called, becatife formerly it may 
have abounded with trees. At the foot of one of the hills there is a place cal- 
led Rob's Bog, which, in time of war with England, being covered over with 
ru(hes by the Scotch, and the Englifh taking it for fafe ground, and paffing 
through it on horfe back at full fpeed, fell into it, and periffied there ; the 
ftratagem being afcribed to Rob one of the commanders of the Scotch army, 
the place derived its name from him. 

In Birwick heights there is an indelible mark of a furnace, where it is furi 
that a fire was always kept by the druids. Oppofite to Lamington, on the 
other fide of the Clyde, is an high mountain called Tinto, or the hill of fire, 
•n which it may be fuppofed that in like manner a fire was always kept. 

In one of the hills above Wandel mill there is Wallace's camp, fo called 
from that great Scotch warrior, who encamped here. There were in this pa- 
rith anciently four great buildings, called towers ; two in Wandel, and two in 
Lamington, one in the town, and another in the mains ; but to fay nothing of 
the three former, it may be mentioned of the latter that the walls ftill remain 
fome ftoriei high, very thick and ftreng. It was built by a laird of Laming- 
ton,

The old town of Edinburgh at that time confided of the a- 
bove fix parifhes only, confequently the preceding lift contain- 
ed every family then living in what was properly to be called 
the city, of Edinburgh. On the fuppofition that there were at 
that time even 6 individuals in each family, the total number of 
fouls would amount to 19,908, which gives but a poor idea 
of the fituation and importance of Edinburgh at that period. 
If we reckon the Canongate to have contained 2500 inhabi- 
tants, the parifh of St. Cuthberts 7000, and thofe of South 
and North Leith 6000 fouls, the total number of individuals 
in Edinburgh and its neighbourhood, was 355-° in l6 l S ' 

The Rev. Dr. Blair communicated a paper, containing an 
enumeration of families and examinable perfons in the city of 
Edinburgh, apparently taken in 1722, in which the numbers 
in each parifli of that city were thus ftated,

Adding the ufual proportion of one fourth of the examina- 
ble perfons for children, the number of inhabitants in the city 
of Edinburgh in 1722 appears to have amounted to 25,420, or 
fomewhat lefs than 4 f to each family, and if we allow 15,000 
for the fuburbs and the environs, the total would be 40,420

Maitland, in his hiftory of Edinburgh, founding his compu- 
tation on the regifter of burials, makes the number of the inha- 
bitants in the above nine parifhes in that city to amount to 
48,000 at leaft, in 1753. But that calculation is little to be 
regarded, as, in 1755, an enumeration was made, at the de- 
fire of the late Dr. Webfter, when the numbers proved to be

The computation made by Mr. Arnot in 1775, was (till 
more confiderable. The number of families in Edinburgh, 
Leith, and the environs, he ftates, amounted to 13,806, which, 
multiplied by 6, makes the number of inhabitants to be 82,836, 
and to this he propofes to add 1400 for the caftle, hofpitals, 
&amp;c amounting in all to 84,236. But 6 to a family is too high 
a calculation even for Edinburgh, large as the families there are. 
Reckoning at the rateof 5 to each family, which, it appears from 
the enumeration in 1 791, is fufficiently high, and adding 1400 
for the caftle &amp;c. the number of fouls in the city and fuburbs, 
including Leith, amounted in 1775 to 70,430 

Soon 'after the Statiftical Account of Scotland was fet on 
foot, the minifters and elders of fix parifhes of the city of E- 
dinburgh, (the High Church, Old Church, Little Church, 
Lady Yefter's, Old-Grayfriars, and St. Andrew's), and the pa- 
rifhes of St. Cuthberts, South Leith, and North Leith, with 
the view of promoting this work, made an enumeration of the 
inhabitants within their refpedive bounds. The numbers in 
fix of the ten parifhes of Edinburgh being in this manner ac- 
tually afcertained, . fufficient data were from thence afforded 
for eftimating the numbers of families, and of individuals, 
in the remaining four parifhes ; and the refult of this enu- 
meration and calculation is exhibited in the following Table

It is to be obferved, on the above enumeration, that it mud 
be rather under, than above, the real amount. In fome of 
the parifhes, lodgers were not included ; and in all of them, 
the real number of many families could not be obtained, in 
confequence of the abfurd apprehenfions entertained, that the 
enumeration was intended for the puipofe of laying on fome 
new tax, in which'the people were to be charged higher in 
proportion to the number of their children. It is probable that 
from 2 to perhaps 3000 fouls more would have appeared on 
the lifts, had the enumeration been more accurate and com- 
plete, and had there been no concealment in confequence of 
the above mentioned prejudices of feveral of the inhabitants.

CANONGATE PARISH. , 

OF the 6200 inhabitants of this din-rift, about 1200 are 
under ten years of age. Of the 1552 families, about 1200 
profefs the eftablifhed religion ; 80 belong to the Epifcopal 
church, 1 1 4 areSeceders, 1 8 Roman Catholics, and the remain- 
ing 140 either Sectaries of different denominations, or families 
who will give no account of their religious perfuafion. The 
population of this parifh appears to be pretty ftationary for a 
. good number of years paft ; but a confiderable change has ta- 
ken place with refpett to the rank and the opulence of the in- 
habitants. It was formerly remarkable for the number of no- 
ble and genteel families refiding in it. But of late, fince the 
increafe of the buildings in the New-Town and fouth diftricts, 
the number of thefe has confiderably diminilhed. The inte- 
reft of the Canongate, as a burgh, has alfo been hurt by the 
alteration of the carriage-road to Leith, which has cut off, in 
a great meafure, the revenue it derived from the cuftoms at 
the Watergate. 

The burgh of Canongate, being a vaffalage to Edinburgh, 
is governed by a baron bailie, and two refident magiftrates 
annually chofen by the Town-Council of that city. Their juris- 
diction extends beyond the bounds of the parifh, to the eaft 
fide of the Pleafance, and to the town of North Leith. They 
are ex officio juftices of peace. 

There are two minifters of the parifh of Canongate. One is 
prefented by the Crown, and the other by the joint body of 
the magiftrates, kirkfeflion, heritors, and deacons of craft of 
the eight incorporations. The fettlement of the laft, owing 
to the number of electors, (about 400), has generally been 
•attended with much difficulty and litigation. 

The ftipend of the firft or fenior minifter is L. 99 in mo- 
ney

ney, and 51 bolls of victual, in equal proportions of wheat, 
barley, and oats befides the intereft, at the rate of 5 per cent. 
of L. 500, provided for building or purchafing a manfe, if the 
incumbent (hall require it to be laid out for that purpofe. 

The chapel adjacent to Holyroodhoufe was long ufed as the 
parifh church of Canongate. But, in the year 1686, James 
II. having refolved to reftore the Order of the Thiftle to its 
former fplendor, converted it into a Roman Catholic place 
of worfhip, for the inftallment of the knights, and for other 
folemnities belonging to that ancient Order. The Proteftant 
inhabitants where thereby for a time deprived of a church. 
The inconvenience of this being feverely felt, they gave in a 
petition to the king, for a grant of as much of a certain fum 
of money, which had been difponed to the Town-Council of 
Edinburgh, anno 1649, by one Thomas Moodie, for the pur- 
pofe of building a church, (which purpofe had never been ful- 
filled), as fhould be fufficient for erefting a parifh church in 
Cannongate. This petition the king was pleafed to grant 5 
and, accordingly, the prefent church was built, and a burial 
place annexed to it, anno 1688, for the fum of 43°°° merks 
Scotch.— A condition, however, was annexed to this grant, that 
all perfons, having right to feats in Holyroodhoufe, fhould be 
provided to the fame extent in the new parifh church. Hence 
by far the greater part of the area and lofts in the church of 
Canongate is flail the property either of the incorporations, .or 
of noble families, formerly connected with the King's houfe- 
hold. 

The repairs of the church of Canongate within thefe thirty 
vears paft, have amounted to upwards of L. 2200 fterling. 
Many difputes having arifen about the property of the church, 
xhe adminiftration of the funds arifing from it, and the bur- 
den of thefe expenuve repairs 5 a contrad of agreement was 
at laft entered into by the magiftrates, Kirk Scffion, heritors,

fifteen delegates, chofen annually, under the appellation of 
managers of the church and church-yard funds of Canongate, 
viz. 

Six delegates from the heritors. 

Three from the magiftrates and treafurer of Canongate, 

one of whom to be always the baron baillie. 
Three from the kirk-femon. 
Three from the incorporations. 
The funds under their management are,

ble property of individuals, or do not belong to the incorpora- 
tions. 

2dly, The produce of the fale of burial ground ; of thefe, 
befides the unpurchafed ground in the old church-yard, they 
have now a confiderable number for fale in a piece of ground 
adjacent to it on the Eaft, lately purchafed and inclofed for 
this purpofe. (

an aft of the Scots parliament, on the rents of houfes in Canon-

tain other purpofes therein mentioned. 

There never has been any poor rate in the parifh of Canon- 
gate. 

The charity- work-houfe, which was built by fubfeription in 
the year 1761, is maintained from the following funds. 

1 ft, The collections at the church door, amounting on an 
average of 8 years pad, to L. 192 per annum.

NORTH LEITH. 

The following Account of this Parifh was drawn up by the prefent 
jcunibcnt, David Johnstone, D. D.

Name, Surface, and Climate. -The name, Leith, is derived 
from an old Scotch or Gaelic word, which fignifies the mouth 

or 



of Edinburgh, S3 c. 57 1 

of the water. North Leith originally belonged, to the parimof 
Holyroodhoufe, from which it was disjoined and ereaed into 
a f'ratc pariih in the year 1606. It then comprehended 
only the village of North Leith, and the coal hill, which are a 
p,rt of the barony of Broughton; but, in the year .630, the 
baronies of Newhaven and Hillhoufe-field, which belonged 
to the parifh of St. Cuthberts or Weft Kirk, were annexed to 

* The parilh is of an oblong figure, extending along the fea 
(hore about an Englifli mile in length, and is a quarter of a mile 
in breadth ; it is bounded by the Firth of Forth, on the north, 
by the parifh of St. Cuthberts on the weft, and by South Leith, 
on the fouth and eaft. The face of the country is flat, and its 
foil light and fandy ; but with the dung procured from the 
town, it produces wheat, barley, clover and potatoes. ^ It is 
allinclofed. There are properly no farms in the parifh; a 
few gardeners rent the moft of it, and give about L. 3 : 10 per 
acre. The whole lands do not exceed 170 acres, of which 
there may be about 20 in kitchen gardens. The only heritor 
is Mr Robertfon of Lady-kirk. The reft are feuars, who 
hold of the trinity-houfe Leith. 

The air, in general, is (harp, clear and healthy ; the place 
has been mucn frequented, of late years, for fea bathing, and 
a number of houfes has been ereded for the accommodation 
of Grangers. In the months of April and May, an eaft wind 
generally prevails, which occafions damp and foggy weather. 

Population.— \n the year 1745, the number of inhabitants 
was about 1400. For 25 years paft, the incumbent has taken 
up a roll of them every year, in courfe of minifterial vilitation, 
and finds the fouls amount at prefent to about 2400. This 
year, 1791, the number of families is 642, and the indivi- 
duals are 2439, of which 1350 are females, and 1059 arc 

4 C 2 males i 



57* 



Statijiical Account 



males ; fo that the females exceed the males by 291 ; upon an 
average, they are fomewhat under four to a family. About 
12 months ago, 100 families were difpoflefied, and their hou- 
fes pulled down to open a paffage to the new bridge ; but the 
people feem to have got lodgings in the town, as the numbers 
are not diminilhed. Two large houfes are ere&amp;ed in place of 
the old ones, which will accommodate 20 families. 

By a medium of births for 20 years, they amount to 82 an- 
nually, but in thcfe are included feveral from South Leith, who 
attend public worfhip in North Leith, and have their childrens 
names regiftered there ; 1800 of the parifliioners live in North 
Leith, Coalhill and Citadel ; the other 600, refide in the fifhing 
town of Newhaven and in detached houfes in the country. 
The number of marriages, at an average, is 25. There is no 
regifter kept of the dead, as the people grudged the expence 
of it ; and, indeed, it would not afcertain the number of thofe 
who die in the parifh, with any precifion, as a great many 
from South Leith and the neighbourhood, bury in North 
Leith church-yard. Almoft all the parifliioners attend the e- 
ftablifhed church. The number of other perfuafions does not ex- 
ceed 50. There are no very old people in the parifh •, a few ex- 
ceed 80 years. 

Manufactures and Rent, &amp;c— The principal manufadure 
in the place is (hip-building, and a number of fine veiTels from 
200 to 300 tons have been lately built. There are 5 mafter- 
builders, who employ about 1 52 carpenters, whofe wages are a- 
bout 1 s 1 od a day each. There have been two dry docks erec- 
ted within thefe fixteen years, one of which lets at L.. 130 per 
annum ; the other is (till more valuable, and is in the polfeffion 
pf the proprietor. The great bulk of the inhabitants are car- 
penters, failors, and fifhermen ; there are a few anchor- fmiths, 
arid W e aveT5, 



of Edinburgh, &amp;c. 573 

The rent of the houfes in North-Leith is valued at L. 500 
per annum. The tithe of fifli, which belongs to the kirk-fef- 
Con, yields L. 63 : 10s, but that arifes chiefly from the dry 
fifli from Zetland j this was purchafed from Lord Holyrood- 
houfe, whofucceeded the. abbot of that name, at 1 800 mcrks, 
and is part of the fund for paying the mimfters ftipend.-The 
valued rent of the parifh is L. 1220 Scotch. 

Haddocks ufed to be plenty on the coaft, but of late they 
have difappeared; they were in greateft perfedion in the 
months of May and June. There are abundance of lobfters, 
oyfters, and mufcles in the neighbourhood ; the lobfters are 
infeafon in the fummer months; the oyfters and mufcles, 
from September to May. There are no fea weeds of any con- 
fequence, a few are fometimes caft afhore with an Eaft wind, 
but are fcarce worth gathering for manure. 

By an account taken from the cuftom-houfe books, where 
an exact regifter of fhips belonging to the place is kept, it ap- 
pears, that in the beginning of 'this year (1791), there were 
i65veflelsof different burthens ; their tonnage amounted to 

16,445 tons  and the y were na vig ated b y 9 1 5 men and 7° b °y s - 

The principal trade of the place is to the Baltic, which of late 
years has greatly increafed, and a number of ingenious fpi- 
rited merchants have engaged in it. 

Fortifications and Bridge. — A citadel was ere&amp;ed by Oliver 
Cromwell, with five baitions, three of which remain, and two 
of the gates. It was in a great meafure demolifhed after the 
Reftoration, and the fite of it given to the Duke of Lauder- 
dale, from whom the Council of Edinburgh were obliged to 
purchafe it for the enormous fum of L. 6000. — About ten years 
ago, a battery of nine guns was erected to the weft of the ci- 
tadel, for the defence of the harbour, occafioned by the ap- 
pearance of Paul Jones in the neighbourhood, with three arm- 



574 



Statlflical Account 



ed veflels, who fpread a general alarm over the whole coaft, 
and threatened to deftroy the lliips both in the road, and in 
the harbour. An officer, with eighteen or twenty artillery 
men conftantly refide in the battery, and keep it in excellent 
order ; it would accommodate a much larger number, and it 
has been propofed to make it the head quarters of the compa- 

There was a (tone bridge of three arches, acrofs the harbour, 
near the church, which was built originally by the abbots of 
Holyrood houfe ; and feems to have been rebuilt by the inha- 
bitants of North Leith, in the year 1 602. A toll was then 
levied upon it for every horfe, cow, and fheep, and every man 
and woman with a burden ; but there is no mention made of 
a carriage of any kind, which {hews that there were then none in 
the country. The bridge became afterwards the property of the 
Town Council of Edinburgh, by a grant from Charles I. and 
is now removed to enlarge the harbour, a new draw bridge 
having been lately built, a little farther down. There is only 
one turnpike road in the parifh, upon whic.li there is a toll bar 
hard by the church yard. 

Ecclefiajl'ical State, and Poor.— The patronage is veiled in 
the heads of families ; and to their honour, for thefe hundred 
years, they have been unanimous in the choice of their mi- 
nifters. The Archbifliop of St. Andrews and the Bifhop of E- 
dinburgh gave them a great deal of trouble, but the parifhion- 
ers always prevailed. 

Both the church and manfe are as old as the times of po- 
pery, but they have undergone a variety of repairs ; the church 
received a very confiderable one in the year 1736, when it was 
in a great meafure rebuilt. Both the church and manfe are 
upheld by the kirk-ftihon, who likewife pay all the ftipend, ex- 
cept 4 co roerka paid by the paafc of St. Cmhbert's, in conse- 
quence 



of Edinburgh, &amp;c. 575 

qUencc of ibe baronies of Newhaven and Hillhoufefield being 
annexed to North Leith. The living altogether, including 
manfe and glebe, may be worth L. .40 per annum, but it de- 
pends much on the incumbent being well with his people ; the 
legal ftipend does not exceed L. 80., The reft is voluntary. 

The number of poor upon the kirkfeffion's roll is about fix- 
ty,and they are chiefly fupported by the coitions at the church 
doors; the fum expended upon them, and in educating their 
children, is about L. 100 per annum. In the winter 1782, 
when the meal was at 2s lod a (tone, the inhabitants made a 
contribution for the relief of the indigent, by which means they 
got meal at is per peck, when the market price was is sd. 

Mifccllaneous Remark.- -The uriiverfal fuel is coal, which 
cofts about 1 os 6d the deal of 23 cwt. 

Beef and mutton vary according to the feafon, at a medium 
they may be about 3$ or 4 d per lb. It is fomewhat remarkable 
that in the year 1781, when a fleet of near 600 fail came to 
the road, and continued for feven or eight weeks, they did not 
raife the price of pro'vifions. Such a quantity of vivres of all 
kinds was crowded into the place, that near 30,000 ftrangers 
were amply fupplied, and the inhabitants felt no inconveni- 
ence; garden ftuffs in particular abounded, which proved a 
moft feafonable relief to the feamen, many of whom were af- 
filed with thefcurvy. Befides the large fleet bound to the 
Baltic,' there were fourteen fhips of the line, and upwards of fif- 
ty merchantmen from Jamaica, which made a grand and 
beautiful appearance. 

There is a light houfe with reflecting lamps at the mouth of 
the harbour, and a beacon a mile difhnt from thence. 

There is an eftablifhed fchool in the parifh, where about 60 
fcholars attend. The fchoolmafter's falary is L. 8 : 6 : 8d, 
and he is allowed L. 5 annually, for being feffion clerk. His 

fchool 



576 Slatiftical Account 

fchool wages for teaching Latin, is 5s a quarter, for writing 
and arithmetic the fame, and for reading Englifh, 33. His fees 
for proclamation of banns is 4s iod, for regiftering births 
and baptifms is 2d. 

A funday fchool was eftablifhed in the parifh three years a- 
go, where 100 children attend, and it is of the greateft bene- 
fit to the place ; young people, who formerly were brought up 
in the profoundeft ignorance, and grofly mifpent the fabbath 
day, are now taught a reverence for it, and are educated in the 
principles of religion and morals. The mafter is allowed five 
guineas a year, by the Society for promoting Religious Know- 
ledge among the Poor. 

It might have been neceffary to have enlarged this part of 
the work confiderably, and for that purpofe to have made more 
cxtenfive inquiries into the ftatiftical circumftances of Edin- 
burgh and its neighbourhood, had not William Creech, Efq, 
a refpectable magiftrate of that city, paid particular attention to 
fuch inquiries, which led him, fome years ago, to draw up a 
comparative view of Edinburgh in 1763 and 1783 ; contain- 
ing many curious particulars, not only relative to that city, but 
to Scotland in general, with many important obfervations in 
regard to the changes which had taken place in that period in 
the mode of living, arts, commerce, literature, manners, &amp;c. 
of the inhabitants. As Mr Creech very readily agreed to car- 
ry down that information to the prefent period, it precludes 
the neceffity of any farther inveftigation of that nature. The 
reader is therefore referred to the following appendix for the 
ftatiftical progrefs, and prefent ftate of Edinburgh, and alfo for 
an interefting paper refpeding fuch extraordinary phyfical 
phenomena as have occurred in Scotland, for fome years paft.

Tempora mutantur, et not mutamur in Mis. 



S I R, 

I have often thought, that it might not only be entertaining, 
but ufeful, to remark, from time to time, the vicifli- 
tudes in civilized fociety, and the progrefs of its manners ; 
and, by comparing the prefent with the paft, to examine, 
whether, as individuals, or as a people, we were improving 
or declining. 

It is frequently difficult to aflign a reafon for the revolutions 
which take place in the circumftances and manners of a coun- 
try, or to trace the caufes that have occafioned a change ; but, 
it is evident that the firft ftep towards inveftigating the caufe, 
is to ftate the facts. A plan of this kind, frequently repeated, 
might be of great utility, by leading to cultivation and "im- 
provement in fome things, and to correction or prohibition in 
others ; while it would, at the fame time, afford a valuable 

fund 



5§2 Statijlical Account 

fund of facts for the annalift, the philofopher, and the hif- 
torian. 

Every perfon, whofe recolle&amp;ion extends but to a few years 
paft, muft be fenfible of a very ftriking difference in the ex- 
ternal appearance of Edinburgh, and alfo in the mode of liv- 
ing, trade, and manners of the people. 

Let us fta«te a comparifon, for inftance, no farther back than 
between the year 1763 and the year 1783, and from thence 
to 1793, and many features of the prefent time will probably 
appear prominent and ftriking, which, in the gradual pro-

In 1763 — Edinburgh was almoft entirely confined within 
the city-walls. The fuburbs were of fmall extent. Nicol- 
fon's Street and Square,' Chapel-ftreet, the greater part of 
Brifto-ftreet, Crichton-ftreet, George's Square*, Teviot-row, 
Buccleugh-ftreet, St Patrick's Square, &amp;c. &amp;c. to the fouth, 
were fields and orchards. To the north, there was no bridge ; 
and (till of late) the New Town, with all its elegant and 
magnificent buildings, fquares, rows, courts, &amp;c. extending 
upwards of a mile in length, and near half a mile in breadth, 
did not exift f. It may with truth be faid, that there is not

nor a more elegant ftreet than George-ftreet. The views from 
Queen-ftreet, to the north, exhibit a fcene of grandeur and 
beauty uuparallelled in any city. 

It is a moderate calculation to fay, tlftt three millions Ster- 
ling have been expended on building, and public improve- 
ments, in and about the city of Edinburgh, fince 1763 V the 
environs of which cannot be furpafled in views of the fubhme, 
the piaurefque, and the beautiful. 

In 1763-People of quality and falhion lived in houfes, 
which, in 1783, were inhabited by tradefmen, or by people in 
humble and ordinary life. The Lord Jujlice Clerk Tinwald's 
houfe was polTeffedby a French Teacher-Lard Present Crat- 
gie's houfe by a Rouphtg-wife or Sales-woman rf old furniture 
—and Lord Drummorts houfe was left by a Chairman for 
want of accommodation *. 

In 1786— A bridge to the fouth, over the Cowgate ftreet, 
wasbuilt.and the areas for building fhopsand houfes on the eaft 
and weft fide of it, fold higher than perhaps ever was known 
in any city, (even in Rome, during the moft flourifhing times of

and buried 9 people in the ruins. 

Three or four fcattered houfes were then built in the New Town. It was 
fereral years after the bridge was rebuilt, before people took courage to ereft 
houfes in the New Town. 

* The houfe of the Duke of Douglas at the Union, is now poflefred by a 
whecl-wtight. Oliver Cromwell once lived in the late gloomy Chambers of 
the Sheriff Clerk. The great Marquis of Argyle's houfe, in the Cafrlehill, 
was poiTcffcd by a hofier, at L. 12 per annum. The houfe of the late Prefi- 
dent Dundas who died in Dec. 1787, is now poffeffed by an iron- monger, as 
his dwelling houfe and ware-room. — A houfe lately inhabited by one of the

of Milne's Square, fold for above L. i5i,o®o/w acre ! 

In March 179Z — The ground for 9 houfes on the north of 
Charlotte's Square fold for L. 2480 or L. 9 per foot in front, 
befides L. 6 yearly, for every 42 feet in front. 

The foundation-ftone of the South Bridge, over the ftreet of 
the Cowgate. was laid on the ift of Auguft, 1785 *. The 
Bridge, confiding of 22 arches, was built — the old houfes 
were removed — elegant new houfes on both fides were finifbed 
■ — the fhops occupied — and the ftreet opened for carriages in 
March 1788— an operation of aftonifhing celerity !— -By 
this change, Niddry's, Merlin's, and Pebbles' wynds (or lanes) 
were annihilated ; and the oldeft ftone. building in Edinburgh 
was pulled down, where Queen Mary lodged the night after 
the battle of Carberry hill f- It was then the houfe of Sir Si- 
mon Prefton of Craigmiller, Lord Provoft of Edinburgh, 1567. 

In 1783— Acommunication (towards the Cattle) between the 
Old and the New City, was begun by means of an immenfe 
mound of earth, above 800 feet in length, acrofs a deep mo- 
rafs, and made paffable for carriages in 3 years. Whilft the 
mound was forming, it funk at different periods, above 80

then digging in the New Town, were (upon an average) laid

liam of the whole revenue of the Port Office of Scotland, with a penfion of 
L. 300^ annum, to keep up the port. Sir Robot, after deliberation, gave 
up the grant, as thinking it difadvantageous.

In 1783-The number of hackney-coaches was more than 
tripled, and they were the handfomeft carriages, and had the 
belt horfes for the purpofe, of any without exception, in 
Europe. In 1790, many elegant hackney-chariots were added. 
There are no other of the kind in Britain that ply the ftreetsf.

Hume and Dr Robertfon had indeed, a very few years before, 
fold fome of their works ; the one, a part of the Hiftory of 
Britain, for L. 200 ; the other, the Hiftory of Scotland, for 
L. 60© •, — each 2 vols, in quarto. 

In 1 783 — The value of literary property was carried higher 
by the Scots than ever was known among any people. Da- 
vid Hume received L. 5000 for the remainder of his Hiftory of 
Britain ; and Dr Robertfon, for his fecond work, received 
L. 4500. In fermon-writing the Scots have alfo excelled? 
and, although, in 1763, they were reckoned remarkably de- 
ficient in this fpecies of compofition, yet, 1783^ a minifter 
of Edinburgh, wrote the moft admired fermons that ever were 
publifhed, and obtained the higheft price that ever was given 
for any work of the kind. 

N. B. The merit of thefe fermons obtained for Dr Blair a 

penfion of L. 200 per annum. 
Previous to 1763, the Scots had made no very diftinguifhed 
figure in literature as writers, particularly in the departments 
of Hiftory and Belles Lettres. Lord Karnes had, in the year 
before, (in 1762), publifhed his Elements of Criticifm ; Hume 
and Robertfon had made their firft effays in the line of Hifto- 
ry, a fhort time before, as mentioned above.

Inl7 6 4 _A riding fchool was built by fubfcnptton, 124 
feet long by 42 broad. This inaitution afterwards received 
a Royal charter, with a falary of L. 200 per annum to the 
mafter. 

In 1764— The firfl academy in the kingdom, for teaching 
language and fcience to the deaf and dumb, was begun. 
■ In I7 6 4 — The Speculative Society was inftituted by fix ftu- 
dents then at the Univerfity, for improvement in compofition 
and public fpeaking. This Society afterwards built a hall with- 
in the Univerfity, and furniQied a Library for the ufe of the 
Members. The inftitution has been highly ufeful. It can 
now boaft of eminent members in the Senate, in the Pulpit, 
in Profefiors chairs in the Univerfities, at the Bar, in Medi- 
cine, and in various departments of life. 

In 1783— The Society of Antiquaries was conftituted by 
Royal charter ; and in 1792, publiihed the firft volume of their 
Tranfactions. 

In 1783— The Royal Society of Edinburgh was conftituted 
by Royal charter, and publiihed the firft volume of their 
Tranfaftions in March 1788, and a fecond in 1790. 

From 1780 to 1786— Edinburgh produced two periodical 
papers, the Mirror, and the Lounger, which have met with 
much public approbation. No other periodical paper of note 
has appeared in Britain fince the World and the Connoifleur, 

in 1753 and 1754* 

In 1786- -A Chamber of Commerce was conftituted by 
Royal charter, for protecting and encouraging the commer- 
cial and manufacturing interefts of the country. This infti- 
tution has led the public attention to many ufeful objects, and 
has obtained many falutary regulations and laws refpetting 
the general commerce of the country.

There was no law, in Scotland, making the wilful finking 
of fliips a capital crime, till obtained by means of this cham-

The minutes of the proceedings of the Chamber are print- 
ed every year, and diftributed to the members on the third 
Wednefday of January. 

In 1790 — A fociety for the improvement of wool was infti- 
tuted by Sir John Sinclair. This inftitution has had the effect 
of roufing attention to this valuable article of manufacture ; 
and has excited much emulation among the farmers and gen- 
tlemen. Much labour and expence has been bellowed in col- 
lecting the bed. breeds of fheep, foreign and domeftic, and 
fpreading them over the country. 

In 1 79 1 — A Society was inftituted by a few lay fons of 
Clergymen, for the benefit of the children of the clergy of the 
eftablifhed church of Scotland ; and in 1792, the fubfcribers 
to this laudable purpofe were fo confiderable, that they obtain- 
ed a Royal charter of Incorporation. 

The ftipends of the clergy, it mull be allowed, have not 
kept pace with the increafing progrefs and commerce of the 
country. It is of great importance to fociety that fome means 
fhould be devifed to make the fituation of their families as

In 1763 — The (lock of the Society for propagating Chriflian 
Knowledge amounted to L. 30,000. 

In I79? the fame ftock amounted to about L. 100,000. 
This fund it is believed is mod faithfully applied to the object 
of the inftitution. An hundred and fixty thoufand children 
have been educated by this fociety, and there are ten thou- 
fand in their fchools this year 1792.

laid on the 1 6th of November ; the old college having become 
ruinous, and the clafs- rooms being unfit to contain the number 
of Undents who reforted to this celebrated fchool of feience and 
literature. So popular was this meafure, that in five months 
the voluntary fubferiptions amounted to L. 16,869, and they 
are now L. 31,600. The eftimate for completing the whole 
is about L. 6 3j ooo.-The fix columns in the front of this e- 
legant new building are not to be equalled in Britain. The

teaching rooms, and a library, with fmaller apartments. 

In 1763— The number of boys at the grammar fchool wag 
not more than 200. 

In 1783— The number of boys at the grammar-fchool was 
50c.— It is believed, the molt numerous fchool in Britain. 

In 1788— A magnificent pile of building was finifhed, for 
keeping the public records and papers of Scotland, called the 
Regifter Office. It had been about x 8 years in its progrefs, from 
the time of laying the foundation ftone. It has coft L. 36,000.

In 1763 — Few coaches or chaifes were made in Edinburgh. 
The nobility and gentry, in general, brought their carriages 
from London ; and Paris was reckoned the place in Europe

N. B. Notwithstanding the aftonifhing increafe of ftamp- 
duty, and of paper manufactured, yet Scotland muft 
bring all her ftamped paper from London. The very car- 
riage of the ftamped paper to Edinburgh, it isbelieved,cofts 
Government L. 70© per annum, when it could be ftamped 
at Edinburgh for a trifle, and the manufacture of paper 
thereby greatly encouraged. The prefent mode appears 
to be neither juft nor politic. — By the articles of the U-

fent is above L. 6oo,opo ; and the liberal fupport it has 
given to the landed, commercial, and manufacturing in- 
terefts of Scotland, has added greatly to the profperity 
of the country.

In the year 1769-The Douglas and Co. Bank was infti- 
tutcd and the ftock fubfcribed amounted to L. .50,000.- 
In a few years after, this bank by mifmanagement faded ; and 
it is faid, this failure occafioned land to be brought into the 
market, to the value of L. 750,000. 

Although this lofs was hurtful to many individuals, the 
country was highly benefited ; for the money having been be- 
flowed principally on the improvement of the foil, the gam 
was lafting, and general. 

In I7 6 3 -Heriot'3 Hofpital, which holds a great deal of

at the rate of from 3 to 4 bolls of barley per acre per annum. 

In 1790— Heriot's.Hofpital feued their land at the rate of 
from 8 to 10 bolls per acre yearly. 

N. B. George Heriot, who founded this hofpital for the e- 
ducation of boys, was jeweller to James VI. of Scotland, 
and I. of England. He furnifhed jewels to Prince 
Charles, afterwards King Charles I. when he went to the 
court of Spain, 1623. 
Thefe jewels were never paid for by James ; but, when 
Charles I. came to the throne, the debt to Heriot was 
allowed to his truftees, in part of their purchafe of the 
barony of Broughton, then crown-lands in the neighbour- 
hood of Edinburgh. Thefe lands are now a part of the 
foundation of this Hofpital, the revenue of which is at 
prefent between L. 3000 and L. 4000 per annum. 
The fum that now produces this revenue, was, in 1627.

The ftock of the Royal Infirmary, which in 1750 was 
L.5000, in 1790 was L. 36,000. — —This Infirmary admits 
above 2000 patients annually; and, on an average, one only 
in 25 dies. This, on comparifon with other hofpitals, is not 
to be equalled in Europe. An account of the moft celebrated 
hofpitals in Europe has been publifhed ; and, in fome, 1 in 
1 1 dies ; in others, 1 in 13, and 1 in 16. It is daily attended 
by three phyficians ; and the members of the royal College of 

furgeons attend monthly in their turns. During the fitting 

of the College, (from Oaober to May), two of the Profeflbrs 
of Medicine give clinical lectures, on the cafes of a fele&amp;ed 
number of patients. , 

In 1763, One hundred ftudents attended the Infirmary. 

In 1791, Three hundred and twenty-three ftudents attend- 
ed the Infirmary. 

In 1776, A public Difpenfary was built by fubfeription, and 

fupported by voluntary contributions. This charity is for 

patients airlifted with chronic difeafes, or fuch as render ad- 
million to an hofpital improper or unneceflary. They receive 
advice and medicine gratis; and, in the year 1791, no lefs 
than 15,450 patients had been relieved. 

The firft fpring water brought to fupply Edinburgh was in 
1681. A leaden pipe of 3 inches bore was then laid from Co- 
mifton, about 3* miles fouth weft of the city, by oneBrufchi, 
a German engineer, and there was no other pipe completed 
till about the year 1 7 22, when one of 4^ inches was laid. Thefe 
in time were found infufiicient for fupplying the inhabitants; 
and, in 1787. an iron pipe of 5 inches diameter was added. —

A fecond iron pipe of 7 inches diameter was laid in 1790 ; and 
additional fprings 3 miles farther fouth than the former were 
taken in. — Thefe pipes have coft the city of Edinburgh an im- 
nlenfe fum of money, the laft one having coft above L. 20,000. 
The refervoir on the Caftle-hill contains about 300 tons, and 
the new one at Heriot's hofpital contains nearly the fame quan- 
tity. Edinburgh is amply fupplied with as fine fpring water 
as any in Europe, and Leith now partakes of the fame advan- 
tage. On the 10th of May 1782, after 3 weeks of drought, 
thefe fprings at the fountain head, yielded 1060 Scots pints 

(or 4240 Englifh) per minute, or 3000 tons in 24 hours 

After fupplying all the inhabitants, a. large ftream of lim- 
pid water runs down the ftreets for many hours day and night. 
The like is not to be equalled, it is believed in Europe, except 
at Bern in Switzerland *.

with water from pit wells, of which great numbers were on the fouth of the 
Cowgate-ftreet. The increafe of inhabitants alfo appears from a lift of fami- 
lies taken Anno 1687, in the fix parilhes of which the Old Townof Edinburgh 
then confifted. The number was as follows :

having gone out of Scotland for this year's deficiency of

In 1763, and for fome years after— There was one fhip that 
made an annual voyage to Peterfburgh ; and never brought 
tallow, if any other cargo offered. Three tons of tallow were 
imported into Leith in 1763, which came from Newcaftle. 

In 1783— The (hips from Leith and the Firth of Forth to 
the Baltic amounted to fome hundreds. They make two voy- 
ages in the year, and fometimes three. In 1 7 86, above 2500 
tons of tallow were imported directly from the Baltic into 
Vol. VI. 4 G Leith.

oufly avoiding the furyey) amounted to 13,806 ; this, at the fame rate of fix

makes the number of inhabitants 82,836. Befides, this number* is exciufive 

of the Caflle, all the hofpitals, poorhoufes, infirmary, difpenfary, &amp;c. 

Arnot, upon the fame data, fays 80,836 — bu£ this is a typographical er- 
ror. since 1775, the city and fuburbs have been much extended; and tlyj 

inhabitants muft alfo have greatly increafed. 

N . B. It is a finking fact, that either the former population of Edinburgh 
has been very erroneously reprefented, or the luxury of the prefent inha- 
bitants has increafed in a very uncommon degree ; becaufe, without much 
apparent increafe of population, the valued rent of the city and fuburbs, 
according to the cefs-books, has been more than doubled.

fed by only one, or at molt two ports in Britain. 

In 1763— Every fliip from London or Peterfburgh to Leith 
brought part of her cargo in foap. 

In 1783— Every fhip that went from Leith to London car- 
ried away part of her cargo in foap. 

In 1763 — The quantity of foap manufactured was half 3

In 1791 — The quantity was 3,000,000 lbs. The increafe 
of this article fhews the progrefs of manufactures, for it is be- 
lieved few candles are either imported or exported. 

In 1783— The increafe of tonnage in (hipping, belonging 
to the port of Leith fince 1763, was 42,234 tons ; and. fince 
that period, has fo greatly increafed, that magnificent plans 
have been formed for enlarging the prefent harbour, which is 
found much too fmall for the number of fhips reforting to it 
. — In 1791, the regiftered tonnage at Leith was 130,000 tons. 

In 1763 — There was no fuch thing known, or ufed, as an

have increafed their quantities in proportion. The bakers of 
Dalkeith, Muflelburgh, and Lafwade, alfo fend flour and

150,000 bolls of wheat annually confumed in this metropo-

The quantity of butcher meat, can only be afcertained by 
the number of hides ; and, for that reafon, no account can be 
obtained of the quantity brought to the Edinburgh market by 
the country butchers, who bring a great deal thrice every

In 1775 — 8 *354 oxen,— 6,792 calves,— 39,370 fheep—

In 1778, — There were 8,400 barrels of oyfters exported 
from the city's fifhing grounds. This trade was increafmg fo

The magiftratcs have therefore prohibited the exportation, 
and even the fifhing of oyfters under a certain fize. 

There are immenfe quantities of Strawberries fold in the 
Edinburgh market, during the fhort period that they continue. 
They are fold, upon an average, at 6d the Scots pint, equal to

fuburbs; value L. 2500. It is impoffible to eftimate the 

quantity confumed at the pleafure gardens and places of en- 
tertainment in the neighbourhood of the city. It is known 

that an acre of Strawberies has produced above L 50. 

It is eftimatedthat L. 1000 a year is paid in Edinburgh du- 
ring the months of June, July, Auguft,and September, for 
butter milk, or four milk, as it is called ; it is fold at one 
penny the Scotch pint, or 4 Englifh pints. 

In 1763— Edinburgh was chiefly fupplied with vegetables 
and garden fluff from Muffelburgh and the neighbourhood, 
which were called through the ftreetsby women with creels or 
bafkets en their backs : Any fudden increafe of people would 
have raifed all the markets. A fmall camp at Muffelburgh, a 
few years before had this effect. 

In 1783— The markets of Edinburgh were as amply fup- 
plied with vegetables, and every neceffary of life, as any in 
Europe. In 1781, Admiral Parker's fleet, and a Jamaica 
fleet, confiding together of 1 5 fail of the line, nine frigates, 
and about 600 merchantmen, lay near two months in Leith 
Roads, were fully fupplied with every kind of provifions, 
and the markets were not raifed one farthing, although there 
could not be lefs than an addition of 20,000 men for feven 
weeks. 

The crews of the Jamaica fleet, who were dreadfully afflict- 
ed with fcurvy, were foon reftored to health by the plentiful 
fupplies of ftrawberries, and frefh vegetables and provifions, 
which they received. Some merchants in London, who, either 
from motives of humanity, or efteeming it a profitable adven- 
ture, had fent four tranfports with frefh provifions to the fleet, 
had them returned without breaking bulk. It is believed that 
there is fcarcely a port in Great Britain, London alone except-

It may however be entertaining and perhaps ufeful, to have

SIR, 

I Shall now tranfmit to you a few fails refpe£Ung Edin-

which have a more immediate connexion with Manners. 

A great city in modern Europe has been defcribed to be 
" A huge, diflipated, gluttonous, colle&amp;ed mafs of folly and 
" wickednefs." Perhaps this defcription is applicable, more or 
lefs, to every city, as wealth and luxury increafe. — For it feems 
to be a fact, eftablifhed by the hiftory of mankind, that, as 
opulence increafes, virtue fubfides. Yet, one mould not ima- 
gine, a priori, that this would always be the cafe. But it 

ftrongly confirms the judicious obfervat^m of Horace, 
Eft modus in rebus ; funt certi denique fines, 
£uos ultra, citraque nequit conjiftere reclum. 
All nations are at firft poor, and their manners fimple. As 
they advance to induftry and commerce, to a certain degree 
they become improved, and enlightened ; but opulence intro- 
duces indolence, fenfuality, vice, and corruption, and they 
then haften to decay. In all matters of public or private life 
theproDcr modus in rebus, is the diftinguilhingteft of goodfenfe.

The profperity and happinefs of every individual muft, in 
general, depend on his virtue, as muft that of the nation, 
which is compofed of thefe individuals. A corrupted em- 
pire muft therefore tend faft to ruin, witnefs the example of 
France, where all religion had long been a farce, and morals 
of confequence depraved. 

Hence arifes the neceflity of watch ing over the manners, 
as well as the morals of the people, and particularly of the 
higher ranks, whofe example is often pernicious. 

But let us fee, in a fociety comparatively fmall to many o-

ges, however, may be totally unconnected with this caufe.

them after dinner at two. 

In 1783 — People of fafhion, and of the middle rank, dined 
at four or five o'clock : No bufinefs was done in the after-

drawing-rooms of the ladies in the afternoons, to drink tea, 
and to mix in the foeiety and converfation of the women. 

j n 1783— The drawing-rooms were totally deferted ; invi-

In 1783— Attendance on church was greatly neglected, 
and particularly by the men; Sunday was by many "made 
a day of relaxation; and young people were allowed to ftroll about 
at all hours. Families thought it ungenteel to take their do- 
meftics to church with them : The ftreets were far from being 
void of people in the time of public worfhip ; and, in the evenings

In no refpeet were the manners of 1763 and 1783 more re- 
markable than in the decency, dignity, and delicacy, of the 
one period, compared with the loofenefs, diffipation, and li- 
centioufnefs of Ehe other. Many people ceafed toblufh at what 
would formerly have been reckoned a crime. 

In 1763 — Mafters took charge of their apprentices, and 
kept them under their eye in their own houfes. 

In 1783 — Few mafters would receive apprentices to ftay in 
their houfes, and yet from them an important part of fucceed- 
ing fociety is to be formed. If they attended their hours of 
bufinefs, mafters took no farther charge. The reft of their 
time might be palled (as too frequently happens) in vice and 
debauchery ; hence they become idle, infolent, and difhoneft. 
In 1 79 1, the practice had become ftill more prevalent. Re-

In 1763— The fines colled by the kirk-treafurer for baf- 
tard children amounted to L. 154; and, upon an average of 
ten fucceeding years, they were L. 190. 

In 1783—The fines for baftard children amounted to L. 600, 
and have fince greatly increafed. 

In 1748— The firft correaion houfe for difordetly Females 
Was built, and it coft L. 198 :o : 4$ 

N. B. This is the only one Edinburgh yet has. 

In 1 79 1— Manners had been for fome years fo loofe, and 
crimes fo frequent, that the foundation of a large new houfe 
of Correaion, or Bridewell, was laid on the 30th of Novem- 
ber, which, on the lowed calculation, will coft L. 12,000 ; and 
this plan is on a reduced fcale of what was at firft thought ab- 
folutely necefiary. 

In 1763— That is from June 1763 to June 1764, the ex- 
pence of the Correaion houfe amounted to L. 27 : 16 : if. 

In 1791, and fome years previous to it-The expence of 
the Correaion houfe had rifen to near L. 30©, — ten times 
what it had been in the former period ; and there is not room 
for containing the half of thofe that ought to be confined to 
hard labour. 

In 1763— There were five or fix brothels, or houfes of bad 
fame, and a very few of the lowed and moft ignorant order 
of females fculked about the ftreets at night. A perfon might 
have gone from the Caftle to Holyrood-houfe, (the then length 
of the city), at any hour in the night, without being accofted 
• by a fmglefreet-wa/ker. Street robbery, and pocket picking 
were unknown. 

In 1783— The number of brothels had increafed twenty 
fold, and the women of the town more than a hundred fold. 
Every quarter of the city and fuburbs was infefted with mul- 
titudes

titudes of females abandoned to vice, and a great many at a 
very early period of life, before paflion could miflead, or rea- 
fon teach them right from wrong. Street-robbers, pick-pock- 
ets, and thieves, had much increafed *. 

In 1763 — Houfe-breaking and robbery were extremely rare. 
Many people thought it unneceffary to lock their doors at night. 

In 1783, 1784, 1785, 1786, and 1787— Houfe-breaking, 
theft, and robbery, were aftonifhingly frequent ; and many of 
thefe crimes were committed by boys, whofe age prevented 
them from being objects of capital punifhment. The culprits 
were uniformly apprehended in houfes of bad fame, in which 
they were protected and encouraged in their depredations on 
the public. During the winter, 1787, many daring.robberies 
and mop- breakings were committed, by . means before un- 
thought of; but the gang were difcovered, by one of them 
becoming evidence againft the reft, and the others fufFered 
capital punifhment f. 

In no refpeft was the fobriety, and decorum of the lower 
ranks in 1763 more remarkable, than by contrafting them with 
the riot and licentioufnefs of 1783, particularly on Sundays 
and holidays. The King's birth-day and the laft night of

the year were, in 1783, devoted to drunkennefs, folly, and 
riot, which in 1 763 were attended with peace, and harmony*. 

In 1763, and many years preceding and following — The 
execution of criminals was rare: Three annually were reckon- 
ed the average for the whole kingdom of Scotland. There 
were three fucceeding years, (1774* I775» J 77 6 ) in which 
there was not an execution in Edinurgh. 

In 1783 — There were fix criminals under fentence of death 
in Edinburgh jail, in one week; and, upon the Autumn Cir- 
cuit, no lcfs than thirty-feven capital indictments were iffued. 

During the winter 1791 — 92, —there was not a robbery, 
houfe-breaking, fhop breaking, nor a theft publicly known, 
to the amount of forty (hillings, within the city of Edinburgh ; 

Not a perfon accufed of a capital crime ; and, in the jail, 

only 20 for petty offences, and 19 confined for fmall debts f . 

In 1789— A fociety was inftituted for promoting religious 
knowledge among the poor, or the ignorant and indigent mem- 
bers of the community. No fociety is more likely to be of be- 
nefit. They print books of moral and religious inftrudion, 
which are diffufed among the lower ranks. This was a fa- 
vourite fcheme of the late Lord Karnes, but it was never car- 
tied into execution in his time. A worthy lady left, in 1792, 
feven hundred pounds to promote the objed of this inRitution.

n mams, as they are technically termed ;-and a regular cock- 
pit was built for the accommodation of this fchool of gam- 
Ming and cruelty, where every diftindion of rank and charac- 
ter is levelled. 

In 1790— The cock-pit continued to be frequented. 
Before 1790— There never was fuch a thing known as pro- 
fefled bruifers. But. in the courfe of that year a perfon from 
England opened a public fchool for teaching boxing, or pugi- 
lrfm, as it is termed i and he had feveral public exhibitions at 
his fchool, but few pupils. This branch of education does not 
correfpond with the mild genius of Chriftianity, which we pro- 
fefs i and it can be looked on only with pity, even when prac- 
tifed among favages and barbarians. 

In 1792— This folly, which had been borrowed from the 
fouth, was totally given up. 

j n !^6j — A young man was termed a fine fellow, who, to 
a well-informed and an accomplifhed mind, added elegance of 
manners, and a conduct guided by principle ; one who would 
not have injured the rights of the meaneft individual ; who 
contrafted no debts that he could not pay ; and thought every 
breach of morality unbecoming the character of a gentleman ; 
w ho ftudied to be ufeful to fociety, fo far as his opportu- 
nity or abilities enabled him. 

j n l -j^2  — The term fine fellow was applied to one who could 
drink three bottles ; who difcharged all debts of honour, (or 
game debts and tavern bills), and evaded payment of every 
other •, who fwore immoderately, and before ladies, and 
talked of his ivord of honour ; who ridiculed religion and 
morality as folly and hypocrify, (but without argument) ; who 
was very jolly at the table of his friend, and would lofe no op- 
portunity of feducing his wife, or of debauching his daughter 
if fhe was handfome ; but, on the mention of fuch a thing be- 
ing attempted to his own connections,' would have cut the

felfifh purfuits and pleafures. 

In 1 790 — Among the lower orders fwearing had increafed 
greatly.— And on trials in the courts of law, perjury had alfo 
increafed. 

In 1 79 1 -^-Immoderate drinking, or pufhing the bottle, as it 
is called, was rather out of fafhion among genteel people.— E- 
very one was allowed to do as he pleafed, in filling or drinking 
his glafs. The means of hofpitality and the frequency of {hewing 
it had increafed ; — and excefs on fuch occafions had decreafed. 

In 1763 — In the belt families in town, the education of 
daughters was fitted, not only to embellifh and improve their 
minds ; but to accomplifh them in the ufeful and necefiary 
arts of domeftic economy. The fewing fchool, the paftry- 
fchool, were then eflential branches of female education •, nor 
was a young lady of the beft family afhamed to go to market 
with her mother. 

In 1783 — The daughters of many tradefmen confumed 
the mornings at the toilet, or in ftrolling from fhop to fhop, 
&amp;c. Many of them would have blulhed to have been 
feen in a market. The cares of the family were devolved upon a 
houfe-keeper ; and the young lady employed thofe heavy hours 
when ftie was difengaged from public or private amufements, 
in improving her mind from the precious Jiores of a circulating 
library and all, whether they had tafte for it or not, were 
taught mufic at a great expence. 

In 1 79 1 — There is little alteration. Every rank is eager to 
eopy the manners and fafliion of their fuperiors ; and this has 
in all ages been the cafe. Of what importance, then, is 
correa and exemplary manners in the higher ranks to the 
good order of fociety i

j n I7 6 3 — Young ladies (even by themfelves) might have 
walked through the ftreets of the City in perfeft fecurity at 
any hour. No perfon would have interrupted, or fpoken to 
them. 

In 1783— The miftrefles of boarding fchools found it ne- 
cefiary to advertife, that their young ladies were not permitted 
to go abroad without proper attendants. 

In 1791— Boys, from bad example at home, and worfe a- 
broad, had become forward and infolent. They early frequented 
taverns, and were foon initiated in folly and vice /,without any 
religious principle to reftrain them. It has been an error o£ 
twenty years, to precipitate the education of. boys, and make 

shem too foon men. 
In , 763— The weekly Concert of mufic began at fix o'clock. 
I n 1783— The Concert began at feven o'clock j but it was 
not in general fo much attended as fuch an elegant entertain- 
ment fhouldhave been, and which was given at the fole ex- 
pence of the fubfcribers. 

In 1 79 1-2, The fafhion changed, and the Concert became 
the moft crquded place of amufement. 

The barbarous cuftom of faving the ladies, (as it was called), 
after St. Cecilia's Concert, by gentlemen drinking immo- 
derately to fave a favourite lady, as his toaft, has been for fome 
years given up.— Indeed they got no thanks for their abfurdity. 

In 1763— The queftiori refpe&amp;ing the morality of ftage- 
plays was much agitated. A clergyman, a few years before, 
had been brought before the General Affembly of the Church, 
and fufpended from his office, for having written a tragedy, 
unqueftionably one of the moft chafte and interefting in the 
Englim language *'. By thofe who attended the Theatre, even

without fcruplc, Saturday night was thought the mod impro- 
per in the week for going to the play. Any clergyman, who 
had been known to have gone to the playhoufe, would have in- 
curred church cenfure. 

In 1783 — The morality of ftage- plays, or their effects on 
fociety were not thought of. The moft crouded houfes were 
always on Saturday-night. The boxes for the Saturday-night's 
play were generally taken for the feafon, fo that flrangers 
often on that night could not get a place. The cuftom of 
taking a box for the Saturday- night through the feafon, was 
rnuchpracTifed by boarding miftreffes, fo that there could be no 
choice of the play, but the young ladies could only take what 
was fet before them by the manager. Impudent buffoons took 
liberties with authors, and with the audience, in their acting, 
that would not have been fuffered formerly. 

The galleries never failed to applaud what they formerly 
would have hiffed, as improper in fentiment, or decorum. 

In 1763 — There was one dancing affembly room •, the pro- 
fits of which went to the fupport of the Charity-Workhoufe. 
Minuets were danced by each fet, previous to the country dan- 
ces. Strict regularity with refpett to drefs and decorum, and 
great dignity of manners were obferved. 

In 1786— The old affembly room was ufed for the accom- 
modation of the city-guard. There were three new elegant 
affembly rooms at Edinburgh, befides one at Leith ; but 
the Charity Workhoufe was unprovided for to the extent of its 
neceffities.— Minuets were given up, and country dances only 
ufed, which had often a nearer refemblance to a game of 
romps, than to elegant and graceful dancing. Drefs, particu- 
larly by the men, was much neglected ; and many of them 
reeled from the tavern, fluftered with wine, to an affembly 
of as elegant and beautiful women as any in Europe. 

In 1763— The company at the public affemblies met at five 
o'clock in the afternoon, and the dancing began at fix, and

appearance till ten* The young Mafters and Mifles, who 
would have been mortified not to have feen out the ball, thus 
returned home at three or four in the morning, and yawned 
and gaped, and complained of headachs all the next day. 

In .790 and i 79 i-The public affemblies were httle fre- 
quented. "Private balls were much in fafhion, with elegant 
fuppers after them, and the companies feldom parted till three 
four, or five .in the morning. 

In I7 8 3 -The funds of the Charity Workhoufe were in- 
efficient to maintain the poor of the community entitled by 
law to public charity. The courts of law however, and all who 
eall themfelves members of thofe courts, pay no poor's money, 
nor lamp or guard money , although the moft opulent part of 
the community J whilft they fend at the fame time, a very great 
proportion of managers to difpofe of funds, to winch they 
do not contribute; and crowd the houfe with their poor, to 
whofe fupport they do not pay. This privilege is pleaded on old 
afts of parliament, at a period when the courts were ambula- 
tory :-But now that they have been ftationary for near two 
centuries, it is full time it were given up. There is no fuch 
privilege exiRing any where clfe in Britain. The courts of law 
in London claim no fuch exemption ; nor would it be allowed 
it they did. The regulations and cuftoms of Henry Villi 
would ill accord with' the prefent date of England.

Phyjtcal Phenomena, 



6*2 



LETTER THIRD. 



SIR, 

I Shall now, according to my promife, give you an account 
of the phyfical phenomena, that I have noted for fome 
years. The knowledge of faas is the only foundation of 
true philofophy, and without this knowledge, theories and 
fyftems are vague and unfatisfa&amp;ory. 

It is obvious that this globe which we inhabit has undergone 
great and aftoniftiing changes. It is certain that moft of the land 
we now occupy has once been covered by the fea, for many 
of the higheft mountains are replete with marine produaions. 

That many of the rocks and mountains which we fee, mult 
have been ocafioned by fubterraneous fire, no perfon can doubt. 
For inftance, the bafaltic columns of the Giants caufeway, the 
ifland of Staffa, the rocks at the harbour of Dunbar, the hills 
of Arthur's Seat and Craiglockhart *, and many others, too 
tedious to mention. Thefe are only named as being more im- 
mediately under obfervation. 

Nothing can account for the regular form which the parts of 
thefe rocks have taken, but their being produced by fire, 
and this is fupported by experiment. It has lately been found 
that when fimilar fubftances are brought into fufion, and al- 
lowed to cool gradually, they affume the fame regular fhape as 
thefe columns of rock. Some time ago, a furnace of flint glafs 

having

622 Phyjtcal Phenomena. 



having been by accident allowed to cool, the matter was found 
to have taken the form of bafaltic columns. 

We have but very little knowledge of the great procefles 
of nature, or the tremendous changes that have taken place 
in this globe, owing to the remote antiquity of the events, and 
the fhort period and imperfection of our records. 

Volcanos have been obferved as far to the North and South 
Poles as land has been difcovered ; and through all the inter- 
veening latitudes. It would hence appear, that there is a 
great body of aftive fire within the bowels of the earth ; and 
we know the effects of it often appear at immenfe diftances, 
and that it a£ls in a manner which cannot, or has not yet been 
accounted for. Volcanos, we alfo know, have difappeared 
in one place, and have burft out in another ; and that every 
part of the globe is fubjecl: to fuch convulfions of nature. 

The northern part of this ifland of Britain has not within 
the record of hiftory been fubject to any remarkable phyfical 
change, although it is evident that fuch changes have hap- 
pened in it. The following recent fads, however, may not 
perhaps be thought unworthy of remark; and a few fatts are 
of more value than a thoufand hypothefes. 

In 1782, at the time of the dreadful earthquakes in Calabria, 
the Mercury in the barometer in Scotland funk within the tenth 
of an inch of the bottom of the fcale ; the waters in many of 
the lochs or lakes in the Highlands were much agitated. 

In 1783 — There was an immenfe volcanic eruption in the 
ifland of Iceland *, which began on the tenth of June, and con- 
tinued till the middle of Auguft. A new ifland was thrown 
up in the neighbouring fea, and again difappeared. 

Several

Phyjical Phenomena. ^ 2 3 
Several months previous to this eruption, a heavy darkbluifh 
fulphureous fog had been obferved to reft over the nW 
Zn not diffipated by the wind; this fog, at tunes, was 
fpread all over Europe. The year before this erupuon, and a 
f L months before the earthquakes in Calabria, a contagious 
difeafe called the Infiuenza'M^ through Europe. 

This volcanic eruption in Iceland is perhaps the moft remar- 
kable yet recorded in hiftory. One ftream of burning lava ex- 
tndedV miles in length, and ,6 in breadth, and was * 
fome places between 4 and S oO feet deep * ! 

Upon the 18th of Auguft x 7 8 3 -A remarkable meteor or 
ball of fire was feen to pafs from north to fouth, about half 
pall eight in the evening. This meteor was feen all over Bri- 
tain, and in many places upon the continent of Europe. This 
phenomenon happened much about the time of the termina- 
tion of the volcanic eruption in Iceland, and it is remarkable, 
that this meteor was firft feen to the north-weft of the Shet- 
land and Orkney illands, in the quarter of Iceland. 

Upon the 1 2th of September very extraordinary 

phenomena was obferved at Loch Tay. The air was perfed- 
ly calm, not a breath of wind {lining. About nine o'clock in 
the morning, the water at the eaft end of the loch ebbed about 
300 feet, and left the channel dry. It gradually accumulated 
'and rolled on about 300 feet farther to the weftward, when 
it met a fimilar wave rolling in a contrary diredion. When 
thefe waves met, they rofe to a perpendicular height of five 
or fix feet, producing a white foam upon the top. The wa- 
ter then took a lateral direaion fouthward, rufhing to the 
fhore, and rifing upon it four feet beyond the higheft water 

mark.

ry feven minutes for two hours, the waves gradually diminifh- 
ing every time they reached the fhore, until the whole was 
quiefcent. During the whole of that week, at a latter hour in 
the morning, there was the fame appearance, but not with 
fuch violence. 

Upon the nth of March 1785 — The Tiviot, a large river 
in the fouth of Scotland, fuddenly difappeared, and left the 
channel dry for two hours, and then flowed with its ufual ful* 
nefs *. 

Upon the 16th of June 1786 — A fmart fhock of an earth- 
quake was felt at Whitehaven in Cumberland, which extend- 
ed to the Ifle of Man and Dublin, and was alfo felt in the 
fouth-weft parts of Scotland. 

Upon the 1 ith of Auguft 1786 — A very alarming fhock of 
an earthquake was felt about two o'clock in the morning, in 
the north of England, viz. Northumberland, Cumberland, and 
in Scotland, acrofs the ifland ; and as far north as Argylfhire ; 
and in all thefe places at the fame inftant of time. This 
fhock extended above. 150 miles from fouth to north, and 100 
miles from eaft to weft. 

What an immenfe power muft it have been to have produ- 
ced fuch an effect ! 

Upon the 26th of January 1787— A fmart fhock of an earth- 
quake was felt in the parifhes of Campfie and Strathblane, ten 
miles north from Glafgow, about ten o'clock in the morning. A 
rufhing noife was heard to precede the fhock from the fouth- 
eaft. The night preceding this earthquake, a piece of ground 
near Alloa, on which a mill was built, fuddenly funk a foot

Upon the 26th of January, the river Clyde, above Lanark, 
became almoft dry for two hours, and the mills were flopped ; 
and afterwards the river again flowed as ufual. 

On the 25th of January 1787-The river Tiviot again 
became fuddenly dry, and continued fo for four hours, and 
then flowed with its ufual fulnefs. 

In 1787-The months of January and February were un- 
commonly mild S the thermometer at Edinburgh being in ge- 
neral 20 degrees higher than ufual at that feafon. 

On the 1 2th of February 1787— The mercury in the ba- 
rometer at.Edinburgh was nearly as Tow as at the time of the 
earthquakes in Calabria. 

On the 8th of July 1788— The fea at Dunbar fuddenly re- 
ceded eighteen inches. 

On the 8th of July 1788— An earthquake was felt in the 

Me of Man. 

In September 1789— There was a violent earthquake in 
Iceland*. 

On Thurfday the 5th of November 1789, between five and 
and fix in the evening, a fmart fhock of an earthquake was felt 
at Crieff, at Comrie, and for many miles round that diftriSt, 
which is about fifty five miles from Edinburgh.— At Mr. Ro- 
bertfon's houfe of Lawers, a rumbling noife, like diftant thun- 
der, had been heard at intervals for two months ; and at the 
time o£the fhock, a noife like the difcharge of diftant artillery 
was diftbaiy heard. Mr. Dundas and Mr. Bruce of Edin- 
burgh were (landing before the fire in the drawing-room, and 
they defcribed the fhock, as if a great mallet had fuddenly 
ftruck the foundation of the houfe with violence. — At the vil-

the open fields. 

On the nth of November, in the forenoon, in the fame 
place, another (hock was felt, which was more violent than that 
of the 5th. It was accompanied with a hollow rumbling noife. 
The ice on a piece of water near the houfe of Lawers was (hi-

Extract of a letter from Florence y OB. 2. 1789. 

" We have received the melancholy intelligence, that, on 
the 30th of September, at three quarters after eleven o'clock 
in the morning, a violent fliock of an earthquake was felt in 
the town of Borgo San Sepolcro, which lafted two minutes. 
The cathedral was partly deftroyed, and fome churches, with 
many houfes and palaces, entirely fo. In a village five miles 
from Borgo San Sepolcro, the earth opened and fwallowed up 
above thirty houfes, with all the inhabitants; and the remain- 
der of that village, confiding of above 150 houfes, was totally 
deftroyed : The earth there opened in many different places, 
and a great quantity of cattle have perifhed, befides above 
1000 perfons f. 

It is very extraordinary that on the fame day, viz. the 30th 
tof September, near three o'clock in the afternoon, two or 
hree diftincl: {hocks of an earthquake were felt at the houfe 
of Parfons Green, within a mile of Edinburgh. The houfe 
is fituated on the north fide of the hill called Arthur's Seat,

frMeh is compofed of an irnmenfe «Ms of bluegranite.-Several 
"tos were in the houfe to dine with the family, and the 
whole company ran down (lairs from the drawing-room, and 
tl L the fervants from the kitchen, in the. lobby equally 
alaLd at what had happened. They defcribed the faction 
as if the houfe had received two or three violent blows in the 
foundation, fo that all the furniture fhook. 

On Friday the 4 th of December 1789, the mm Brothers, 
Capt. Stewart, arrived at Leith from Archangel, who report- 
ed that on the coaft of Lapland and Norway he failed many 
leagues through immenfe quantities of dead haddocks abating 
on the fea. He fpoke feveral Englifh fhips, who reported the 
fame faft.-It is certain that haddock, which was the fifh in 
the greateft abundance in the Edinburgh market, has fcarcely 
been feen there thefe three years* 

On the 10th of November . 792, three repeated fmart mock* 
of an earthquake, accompanied with a hollow rumbling noife 
like that of diftant thunder, was felt at Loch Rannoch in 
Perthfhire. 

Extraa of a letter from the fame neighbourhood. 

Comrie (Perthfjire), Nov. 30. 1972. 
« We have, of late, been greatly alarmed with feveral very 
fevere (hocks of an earthquake. They were more fenfible and 
alarming than any felt formerly, and the noife attending them 
was uncommonly loud and tremulous. It appeared, probably, 
more fo from the ftillnefs of the atmofphere, and the rever- 
beration of the furrounding mountains. The houfes were 
greatly fhaken, and the furniture toffed from its place. The

weather had been uncommonly variable, and changed from higk 
guftsj of wind to a deep calm, a few days before the fevered 
fhocks of the earthquake. The air was moift and hazy, and 
the clouds feemed charged with elearicity. It is not impro- 
bable, that thefe earthquakes arife from large caverns below 
this place, into which the exterior waters penetrate, and arc 
converted into vapour, or fteam, capable of the higheft degree 
of expanfion, and muft prefs forcibly upon every thing which 
oppofes their dilatation. By this theory, the famous Delomieu 
accounted for the earthquakes of Calabria in 1783, which was 
received, by the learned world, as more fatisfadtory than any 
propofed by Sir William Hamilton, and other philofophers. 
Whatever be the caufe, the effect is certain ; and it muft be 
no fmall force that can fhake a country to the extent of be- 
tween twenty and thirty miles." 



I do not mean at prefent to draw any hypothefis or theory 
from what I have dated above, but merely to bring fa&amp;s into 
one general view, and to induce others to make obfervations of 
the fame kind. I am, with much efteem,
