<p>Origin of the Name. 
T AXTER, in his Glojurium Antiquitatum Britanmcarnm, 
XJ fuppofes that Kirkcudbright was known to the Romans 
by the name of Eemitium. Its prefcnt name, he thinks, is of 
Saxon original *.-How far this antiquarian is well founded 
in his conjecture, muft be left to thofe who are belt acquaint- 
ed with the Saxon language to determine. But whatever was 
the ancient deflation of this town, it is extremely probable 
that its prefent name is of a modern date, and derived from 

A a different

2 Statl/tical Account 

a different original. About the diftance of a quarter of a. 
mile from the borough, there is fituatcd an old church- 
yard, which, from time immemorial, has ferved the pur- 
pofe of a burying ground to the town, and a part of the land- 
ed parifh annexed to it. In former times, a large church was 
built in the midft of this field, but it is now fo completely 
decayed, that there is not the fmalleft veftige of it to- be feen. 
This church was dedicated to St. Cuthbert ; and the church- 
yard is called at this day St. Cuthbert' V church-yard. The 
contiguity of this burying field to the town, together with the 
different ways of fpelling Kirkcudbright, in fome old authentic 
writings, as Kilculbrigt, Kirkcudburgh, Kirkobrie\£c. inclines- 
lis to think, that whatever might have been its ancient de- 
fignation, its prefent name is derived from St. Cuthbert, irv 
honour of the tutelary faint of this place. Hence Kilcud- 
bright, or Kirkcudbright, fignifies the kirk or church of St. 
Cuthbert. 

Ereftion and Extent. — What is now called Kirkcudbright 
Parijh, formerly confifted of 3 feparate and diftincl: parifhes ; 
which are marked in the ancient valuation roll of the ftewartry 
by the names of Dunrod, Galtway, and Kirkcudbright. Thefe 
names are ftill retained; and the different church-yards, which 
are occupied at this day, as the burying gyounds of the inha- 
bitants of thefe pari fees, fufficiently fhew, that they were once 
feparated, and disjoined from each other. The union of thefe 
parilhes, or rather the annexation of Dunrod and Galtway to 
the parifli of Kirkcudbright, appears to have taken place about 
130 years ago.— The burgh is the feat of the prcfbytery. The 
figure of the pariih approaches nearly to an oblong fquare, 
and (ketches from N. to S. The town, or burgh, lies on the 
W. and. project a little on that fide of the fquare. The length 
of the pariih is 7 Britifti miles : its breadth, from 3 to 4. 

The 



of Kirkcudbright. 3 

The general form of it, and the diftri&amp;s, with which it is 
furrounded, will appear from the annexed map. The pariih. 
is moftly hilly, and has but little extended plain. The hills, 
however, do not rife very high ; nor do they terminate at the 
top in rocky points. They flope gradually, and form a very 
obtufe angle with the plain. Along the fides of the hills, 
and even up to their higheft fummits, they are generally arable. 
Such as are not abound with excellent pafture. Not unfre- 
■quenfly the deepeft foil is to be found at the top of the hill. 
This perhaps may be owing to the air, operating more power- 
fully upon the high lands, which are more expofed to its in- 
fyience, and gradually diflolving the rotten rocks, of which 
the tops of thefis hills are here chiefly compofed, and by this 
wieans forming a deeper foil. 

Soil. — The foil of this parivh is chiefly of two kinds, wet 
and dry. The wet foil is occafl-oned by a hard, cold till, 
which is generally found upon thefe hills ; whofe furface is 
fmooth, and lies about 6 inches below the fuperficies. The 
till, by retaining the water, proves highly detrimental to ve- 
getation. Manure, in this cafe, is of little or no ufe. For 
fuch foils, after having been covered with a fuflucient quantity 
of marie, lime or fea ftells, prove very ungrateful, either in 
the production of corn or of grafs. The dry foil, which is 
the moft general, confifts of a light, hazely earth, with a iharp 
gravelly bottom. This kind of foil is about 61 inches deep ; 
and, when covered with any of the former manures, and pro- 
perly treated, it makes a moft ample return ; efpecially if 
the feafons are warm, and attended with frequent mowers. 
The foil in this cafe is aftoniftiingly produdive, both of grafs 
and corn. Although the lands, when not overcropped, pro- 
duce excellent grain, yet, from the peculiar quality of the 
grafs that grows here, they are particularly adapted for fat- 

^ 2 tening. 



4 Statiftical Account 

tening. No parifh xn Scotland feeds cattle richer, or better 
Ihere are at leaft r , 0 oo acres of rich pafture grounds, which 
Will feed as many bullocks or heifers, laid on in May, and 
taken off m November, from 20 to 30 ftones a piece. And, 
if they are kept to the proper age, ( 5 or 6 years old), upon 
the different ftock farms, they will attain from 40 to *o ftone 
Weight. Better beef, in point of fatnefs and quality, is no 
Where to be found. 

Climate, IsV.— Notwithstanding the wind blows chiefly from 
the S. and S. and confequently expofes this country to 
frequent mowers, and fometimes to long continued rains ; yet 
the climate, upon the whole, is neither damp nor unhealthy. 
This is owing to the nature of its fhallow, hazely foil ; which, 
by admitting the rain to pafs eaflly through its furface, quickly 
abforbs and fucks it up. Unlike to deep, clayey grounds ; 
which, by long retaining the falling fhowers upon their fur- 
face, permit the rays of the fun again to exhale them. Hence 
the air, impregnated with a conftant fncceffion of watery per- 
tides, is kept perpetually damp, which perhaps occafions 
thefe rheumatic and confumptive diforders, that are not often 
to be met with here. In proof of this, there are no epidemi- 
cal diftempers peculiar to this country. Jn general, the cli- 
mate is remarkably healthy, and people often attain to a very 
great age — Inoculation is univerfally pradlifed, and with great 
fuccefs. 

Springs.— There are no mineral fprings within the parifh, 
of much confequence. A chalybeate water, mixed with a 
little fulphur, has lately been difcovered in a field adjoining to 
the burgh ; but as neither its ftxength nor virtues have hither- 
to been well afcertained, nothing decifive can be faid con- 
cerning it. The town is fupplied with excellent fpring wa- 
ter.

Uiftance. This very ufeful work, which coil upwards of 
500I. Sterling, was executed in 1764. One half of the ex- 
pence was defrayed by the burgh, and the other half by pri - 
vate fubfcribers : A great undertaking at the time, confider- 
ing the revenues of the town were but fmall, and the opulence 
of the individuals not great. 



Farms, Produce, Improvement, &amp;c. — The whole 
landed property is divided into 40 farms, which, 
upon an accurate meafurement, contain 

From a laboured calculation, made from 8 dif- 
ferent farms, promifcuoufly taken, the contents 
of which were exa£Hy afcertained, the propor- 
tion of arable to pafture land was as 4 to 1.

The fpecies of grain, that Is fown in the parifh, conflfts of 
bear, barley, and oats, chiefly the latter. They are all very 
good, though not fo weighty as what is produced upon deeper 
foils. Although wheat is but little cultivated in this part of 
the country, it is however the opinion of the moft experienced 
farmers, that the foil is equal to the produaion of any kind 
of grain; being, though light and thin, exceedingly gracious. 
For manuring the land, marie is here chiefly ufed. It is found 
more or lefs fcattered over the whole parifb, in beds, from 22 
feet thick to 3 inches, and at various depths below the fur- 
face. Lime too is brought from Whitehaven, and employed 
by fome farmers for meliorating their land. But befides 
marie, which is found within the parifh, there is alfo an inex- . 
hauftible ftore of fhells lying along the coaft, which are prin- 
cipally ufed for enriching the grounds that lie contiguous 
to it.

the payment of his rent, chiefly upon the fale of his bullocks

about 3 years old, and fetch excellent prices. But fhould the 
demand for Galloway cattle and flieep at any time ceafe, in the 
fouthern parts of the united kingdom, or mould the prices 
fall, for a few years fucceffively, the farmer muft infallibly 
become bankrupt ; for he has little or no dependence upon the 
fale of his grain, which, for the mod part, turns out to no great 
account. From the thinnefs of the population, a confiderable 
quantity of the grain produced cannot be confumed in this 
country. Hence it muft be fent coaft-ways, to the Englifli 
market, or to Greenock and the weft of Scotland. But as 
this is attended with confiderable expence, and befides depends 
upon a variable market, it does not always make that profit- 
able return, which the farmer thinks he had a right to expect. 
It is for this reafon, that proprietors, when granting leafes of 
their farms, generally eftrmate the value of the rent, from the 
number of flieep and cattle which the farm will feed, and not 
from the quantity of grain which it will produce. — Accord- 
ing to the ancient valuation roll, the free rent of the parifls 
was 60291. 8s. id. Scotch. Its prefent rent is more than 
6,oool. Sterling. There are very few proprietors in this ex- 
tenfive parifh. The Earl of Selkirk polleffes above five 
fixths of the whole property. 

Fnrejl Trees. — Befides thofe various ufeful improvements 
in hufbandry, which are carried on in the parifli, thefe which 
are alfo adapted for ornament, as well as utility, ought not 
to be omitted. The Earl of Selkirk has planted, with great 
tafte and judgment, feveral hundred acres, with various kinds 
of foreft trees, fuch as oaks, beeches, aflies, elms, birches, chef- 
nuts, fycamores, hornbeams, rowans, walnuts, larches, together 

with

With different forts of pines; as Scotch, black and white, and 
American fpruce, Weymouth, fikrec, and balm of Gilead. 
He has alfo reared a nurfery, confifting of 15 acres of ground ; 
which, contains more than a million of plants, all in a moft 
thriving condition, and foon to be tranfplanted for cherifhing 
and beautifying various other fields. 

Fruit %-ees.—Ris Lordfhip has likewife laid out an extea- 
five orchard of fruit trees, for the purpofe of eftabliftiing a 
fmall orchard at every farm houfe. A few years ago, there 
was not a fingle fruit tree to be feen in any part of the parifh, 
except what grew about St. Mar/s IJle. Some veuiges of 
old orchards, fcattered up and down, are ftill to be traced ; 
but neither trees nor fruit are any where to be found. They 
muft have gone into decay near a century ago. A great many 
indigenous plants are to be found, along the lhore, and in 
the environs of Kirkcudbright, and efpecially around St. 
Mary's Ifle, which would afford much entertainment for the 
curious botanift; but as they are all fo well defcribed by the 
Rev. John Lightfoot, in his Flora Scotica, a repetition of 
them is unneceflary. In his Lordfhip's garden, at St. Mary's 
Ifle, there are 6 hot houfes, befides forcing frames, all upon a 
new conftruclion, which contain various forts of fruits and 
exotics. Fruit trees, laid horizontally upon a bank, in place 
of a wall, have lately been tried by his Lordfhip's gardener, 
and have anfwered remarkably well. In fhorr, from the va- 
rious improvements already made, and ftill carrying on, the 
face of this country will, in the courfe of a few years, be totally 
changed. It will afiume a moft beautiful appearance. The 
moft charming landfcapes will ftrike the eye, and afford de- 
lightful fubjects for the poet's fancy, and the painter's pencil* 

Rivers 



of Kirkcudbright, 



9 



Rivers and FiJJj — Various little dreams, which abound 
with trouts, and other fmall fifli, flow in a meandering courfe 
through this parifh, and afford excellent amufement for fuch as 
are fond of angling. But the only river worth noticing, both, 
on account of its large fize, and its extenfive ufefulnefs, is 
the Dee, called by the ancient Romans Deva. It rifes out 
of Loch Dee, which is fituated at the bottom of thofe hills,, 
that feparate Ayrfhire from Galloway. After running many- 
miles in a ferpentine courfe, and receiving the waters of the 
great river Ken, it flows a confiderable way, till it reaches 
the parifli of Kirkcudbright j then runs alongft the well fide, 
frum N. E. to S. W. and empties itfelf into the Solway 
Frith. The river Dee abounds with excellent falmon, fea 
trouts and hirlines. The falmon are fold here at different 
prices, from 6d. to 2d. per pound. They feldom begin to 
run till the month of March, and then appear only in fmall 
numbers. In May and June they fwim up in fhoals, with 
the tide, and are caught in great numbers. They are fup~ 
pofed to be in the higheft perfection in the month of June, 
and beginning of July. Nothing can exceed the richnefs of 
the falmon caught within the tide mark. Their flelh, when 
boiled, is generally intermixed with a white curd, which 
feels hard ; but if the fifh are kept for a day or two, this curd 
eliffolves into oil. To fuch as are unaccuflomed to eat falmon 
till feveral clays alter they are taken, the diflolved curd is- 
mod agreeable. Sea trouts make their appearance in the ri- 
ver, during the month of June ; the hirlines in July, and the 
grilfes in Augufl. 

Fificrics — The fi(herie3 within this parifh ate let for about 
400I. per annum, and belong to the Earl of Selkirk, Mr. 
Murray, and the town of Kirkcudbright. Mr. Murray's 
fifliery lies in the upper part; both above the tide mark, and

immediately where it flows. One half is within the parifli of 
Tungland, and the other in the parijh of Kirkcudbright. Al- 
though it is commonly called the Tungland fiftiery, yet all 
the grounds contiguous to the river, on the Kirkcudbright 
fide, belong to the Earl of Selkirk f. The fiftiery below is 
carried on by what are called fiJJj yairs. They are 13 in num- 
ber j one half adapted for the flood, and the other for the 
ebb tide. Some belong to the town, but the greater part to 
the Earl of Selkirk. They are rented at about 100I. The 
ieflee of the town's fiftiery is reftricled by his tack, from fell- 
ing his fifti to any but the inhabitants of the burgh, and is 
not allowed to fell them higher than 3d. per pound, even at 
the earliefl feafon. In the month of June he muft fell the 
falmon at 2d., and the grilfes at lfd. per pound. This was a 
very humane regulation of the magiftrates and town council, 
for the benefit of the poorer citizens, who, by this indulgence, 
participate a little of the revenues of the burgh. 

The number of falmon, grilfes, and white trouts, that are 
annually caught in the doaghs or cruives, in the upper, or 
Tungland fiftiery, is almoft incredible. They are all {hipped 
for the Englifti market, Liverpool and Whitehaven, and fetch 
excellent prices, efpecially in the early fiftiing feafon. But 
the method of fithing, pra&amp;ifed by the fiftiermen, in the up- 
per works, is mofl deftru£tive to the lower fiftieries. The 
doaghs are rajfed fo high, that fcarce a fifti can get over, unlefs 
there is an immenfe fwell in the river Dee, which feldom hap- 
pens during the fiftiing feafon.

perpendicular, are placed horizontally, and not near the dis- 
tance from one another which the law directs. Neither is 
there any Saturday's Jlap, (opening of the works), obferved 
during the fifhing feafon, by which means not a fingle fifh can 
get up till the legal time, 26th Auguft, expires. And even 
after it expires, thefe deftruftive works are kept up for 3 or 
4 weeks fucceffively. Hence not only the filheries below, but 
alfo the property of thofe gentlemen, who have confiderable 
eftates higher up the river, and by their charter have a right 
to fifh, are eflentially injured. Some people here pretend 
to fay, that the fame number of fifh are always found to re- 
turn annually into the river, notwithstanding the immenfe 
quantities which are yearly taken. But this, it may be pre- 
fumed, is. juft as abfurd, as if one fhould affert, that though 
you were to deftroy 40 out of 50 breeders, you wourd ftill 
have as many produced next feafon from the 10, as you had 
the preceding year from the 50 breeders. 

Harlour. — The harbour of Kirkcudbright is fituated on 
the N. of the Solway Friih, about 10 leagues N. E. of the 
Ifle of Man, and 7 leagues N. W. of St. Bee's Head, in Eng- 
land. It is a fafe, natural harbour, with good anchorage, 
and fhelter from all winds. There is no harbour in the S. 
coaft of Scotland fuperior to it ; but, being a dry harbour, it 
is fit only for fuch veffels as can take the ground. At the 
mouth of it there is an ifland called Little Rofs. The en- 
trance between this and the E. fhore is about li mile. It is 
fafe and bold on both fides. About 200 or 300 yards N. E. 
of this ifland lies the proper road for veffels to anchor, where 
they ride in perfed fafety, unlefs the wind fets in from S. W. 
by S. to S. S. E. ; and even then, if it does not blow a very 
hard gale. In this road there isadepth of 16 feet at low water, 
and 40 at high water, the rife being about 24 feet. At half 

B a a mile's 



* 2 Statical Account 

a mile's diftance, within Little Rofs, on the W. fide of the 
ifland, there is a fmall but fafe harbour, called Balmalgan 
Bay- At 4 hours flood, there is a depth of i% or 15 feet 
water for veflels to ride in, either at fpring or neap tides ; 
befides mooring, and fufficient room for 20 large veffels to 
lie, on a foft clay bottom. 

Bay. — About 2§ miles within Little Rofs, on the E. fide, 
there is a large bay, called Torres Lake, or Manx-man's Lake, 
where more than 100 large veffels may lie in fafety, upon a 
foft mud or clay bottom. At 4 hours flood, there is a depth 
of 14 or 16 feet water in this bay, either in fpring or neap 
tides. Two perches are placed on the right hand, and one 
fixed at the point of St. Mary's Ifle, to direct veflels to fleer 
in without danger. 

Bar, i$c — Off St. Mary's Ifle there runs a bar, nearly acrofs 
the harbour. At ordinary fpring tides the depth is about 20 
feet water ; and veflels may either pafs over, or run channel- 
courfe clofe in with the rocks on the S. fliore, according to the 
wind and time of the tide. After palling the bar, the channel 
becomes narrow ; and it is neceflary that large veffels fhould have 
aleading wind to carry them up the river. Upon the fliore, clofe 
by the town, there is a fine {helving beach, where the (hipping 
lie, or ride at anchor in the channel. Here the depth is 8 feet 
at low water, and 28 at high water. The rife being about 
20 feet, the river is navigable to Tungland ; that is, 2 miles 
above the town. There is fufficient water for veflels of 200 
tons, though it is but feldom that any except coafting floops 
afcend ib high. The diftance from the entrance into the har- 
bour, up to the town of Kircudbright, is 3 miles ; and the 
wideft part, at the point of St. Mary's Ifle, is 1 mile and 3 
^uarterst % 

light-Houfe 



of Kirkcudbright. 13 

' Li$ht-Houfe proofed.— In ftormy weather, ivhen veffels 
can neither keep the fea, nor clear the land, this harbour is 
the belt in the S. coaft of Scotland for fhelter, and on that 
account is much frequented in winter. But the entrance in- 
to it being narrow, a ftrong tide fetting right acrofs, and no 
light- houfe to direft them, it is dangerous to run for it in 
the dark, and engage with a lee Chore. Many fatal accidents, 
happen by fhips miffing the harbour, and being driven, either 
into Wigton Bay, or on the banks of the Solway Frith. The 
jfland of Little Rofs affords an excellent fituation for a light* 
houfe. One might be erected there at a fmall expence, and 
kept up on moderate terms. It would be ot the utmoft uti- 
lity to all fhipping, and particularly to ftrangers, in the hour 
of danger. Were government apprifed of the great benefit 
that would refult from this, it is to be hoped they would 
think the matter worthy their attention, and caufe a light- 
houfe to be ere&amp;ed at the public expence. 

Sea Ware The harbour furnifhes dilfe, tangle, and com- 
mon fea-weed. A considerable quantity of the latter is cut, 
made into kelp, and fold for the foap and bottle manufactories. 

Sea Fi/h and Fowls Befides falmon, fea-trouts and hirlines, 

the following fea fifh are to be found in the harbour : cod, 
which are fold at ixd. per pound ; fcad, called here lyth or

* There is every reafon to believe, that the country parifl of Kirkcudbright 
was much more populous, about 130 years ago, than it i, at prefent. In the pa- 
nfb.es of Dunrod and Galtway, now annexed to Kirkcudbright, ibme vertiges of 
villages may ftiil be traced; and from good information, obtained from old peo- 
ple ftill alive, the inhabitants of thefe villages were very numerous. The caufe 
cf this depopulation muft be traced back to the time of the civil wars, in the 
jeign of Charles I. and Cromwell, the ufurper. John, 3d Lord Kirkcud- 
bright, who poffelTed almoft the whole property of this cxtenfive parilh, took up 
arms for the king, raifed a icgiment of foot upon his own charges, (levied chiefly 
from among his tenants and vaffals), and carried them over to Ireland, from 
whence, it may be prefumed, very few CYcr returned. Towards the end of laft

Although 



century, when the minifter made application for an augmentation of flip end, thai 
heritors of Dunrod and Galtway oppofed it, upon this ground, that thefe parifhes 
could not afford it, " being a mere ivajle" From this fevere blow, the country 
pariih has never yet regained its former population; nor i9 it probable, from the 
large and extenflve farms, into which it is now divided, that it will, for many 
years to come. But the noble Lord did not only effentially injure the population 
of the parifh, by his loyalty, but alfo fo funk and deranged his fortune, that foon 
after his death, anno 1664, his eftate was delivered up to his creditors. 

\ The deaths, in 1792, cannot be compared with thofc of former years, as 
no regifler of deceafed perfons has been kept. Neither can the births be accu- 
rately compared ; becaufe, from the great extent of the parifli, and the occafional 
abfence of the minifter, children are fometimes chriftened by other minifters ; 
and from the parentj neglecting to regifter them, the names of a few are left un- 
recorded. They may, however, fafely be taken, at an average for the laft 4 
years, at 65. The exact, number, both of births and deaths, being accurately 
taken, at the vifuation in 179a, may be perfe&amp;ly depended upon. 

§ The following inftances of longevity, it may be proper here to infert. In 
1734, a woman died in Kirkcudbright, who was a native of the place, aged 103. 
Except the lofs of her fight, fhc retained her other faculties till within a few 
months of her death. And on the a8th of November 179a, William Marfhall,

Although from the great increafe of population in the burgh, 
fince j 771., the inhabitants in the town are become much 
more numerous, yet, from the conftant emigration of young 
people, the growing population receives a confiderable check. 
No town in Scotland fends perhaps, for its fize, fo many of 
its children abroad to foreign countries. Many of them have, 
by their induftry and application, fucceeded extremely well. 
Some have acquired very ample fortunes, with a fair and ho* 
nourable character. 

Poor — The number of poor people in the town and coun- 
try amounts, upon an average, to 42. They are fupported 
chiefly from the weekly collections at the church doors upoa 
Sunday. Each perfon, at the quarterly divifion, receives ac- 
cording to his circumftances, at the rate of 8s. or 10s. The 
whole annual collection amounts, at an average, to 70I. Ster- 
ling *. At the quarterly divifion of the weekly collection, 
by the minifter and elders, there is a peculiarity worth men- 
tioning. The minifters and elders of the burgh meet toge- 
ther, and divide the quarterly collection among the poor 
people refiding in the town. Then the minifters and elders 
of the country parifti meet by themfeives, and diftribute what

tinker, died here, at the aftonifhing age ef 120. Though he was not a native of 
this place, but of Kirkmichael, in the fhire of Ayr, yet, for feveral years before 
he died, he refilled often in this burgh. This miracle of longevity retained his 
fenfes almoft to the laft hour ; and diftinctly remembered to have feen King 
William's fleet, when on their way to Ireland, riding at anchor in the Solway 
Frith, clofe by the Bay of Kirkcudbright, and the tranfports lying in the harbour. 
His funeral was attended by a great concourfe of people of all ranks, who paid 
due refpedt to his aftonifhing age.

they have collected, during the quarter, among the poor of 
the landward parilh. As each of them collects at their own 
particular doors of the church, their funds by this means are 
kept quite feparate. This practice has exifted ever fince the 
union of the parifhes, and no doubt took its rife, from a fuf- 
picion entertained by the heritors of the landward parifh, that 
if their collections, for the fupport of the poof, were con- 
founded with thofe of the town, they would be fwallowed up 
by the numerous beggars that generally frequent country 
towns and burghs. Time has fhewn that their fears were not 
groundlefs; for the poor upon the town's roll are 5 times 
more in number, than thofe upon the roll of the country 
parifli. 

Kirkcudbright United Society — In this town a fociety was 
conftituted, in the year 1783, by a few perfons, under the 
defignation of the United Society of Kirkcudbright. The fole 
objeft of this fociety is to relieve the diftreffed, by preventing 
their want of fubfiflence while in ficknefs, and, in cafe of death, 
to defray the expences of their funerals. It extends alfo to the 
relief of the widows and orphans of deceafed members. Ac- 
cording to the regulations of this fociety, each member pays, 
upon his admiffion, 6s. 6d., and is. per quarter He muft 
be 5 years a member of this fociety, before he can receive any 
benefit from the funds. In ficknefs he receives 3s. per week 
till he is recovered ; and, at death, his widow or heir receives 
tl. ios. to defray the expences of his funeral. The widow 
of a deceafed member receives a certain fum yearly ; and, in 
cafe there is no widow, the children receive what me would 
have drawn, until the youngeft is 12 years old. This fo- 
ciety, which was eftablifhed at firft by a few well difpofed 
perfons, for the laudable purpofes already mentioned, has now

Burgh — Kirkcudbright, the head burgh of the ftewartry, 
where the courts of jultice and public records are kept, was 
anciently a burgh of regality, and held of the Douglaffes, 
lords of Galloway, as fuperiors. Upon the forfeiture of the 
eftates of James, 9th Earl of Douglas, and lafl: Lord of Gal- 
loway, at Edinburgh, 4th Auguft 1455, King James II. 
ere&amp;ed the town into a royal burgh, by a charter, dated at 
Perth, 26th OBober 1455 J which was renewed and confirmed 
by a novodamus from King Charles I. dated at Holyrood- 
houfe, 20th 'July 1633. By this charter, and the fet of the 
burgh, the town council is unalterably fixed to confift of 17 
perfons, viz. a provoft, 3 bailies, a treafurer, and 13 coun- 
fellors, who are to meet annually at Michaelmas, and vote 
out 3 of their number, and elecl 3 new counfellors in their 
place t«

* There is alfo another fociety, fomewhat fimilar to the former, but upon a 
jnuch more extenfive fcale, about to be eftablifhed in this place. It is to be 
called the Kirkcudbright Farmers Societ /. But as it is only in contemp, 
lation, a defcription of it muft be deferred until fome future period. 

•}• This regulation, however, has never been duly attended to. Sometimes 
the old counfellors have re-eUBed themfelves, without making any alteration at 
all. At other times, particularly in' two famous political ftruggles, one about 
50 years ago, the other fo late as the year 1790, the party, forming the majo- 
rity, voted out no fewer than 5 counfellors, and elected as many new ones to 
fucceed them. However, this arbitrary proceeding received, in the laft inftacccv 
a check, from the Court of Seflion,

inount at prefent to about 330I. But upon the expiration 
of the prefent leafes of land, they will rife .confiderably above 
that fum. Out of this fund the burgh pays about iool. to 
the public teachers. They are not much in debt, and what 
they owe arifes from the lands they have lately puirchafed. Had 
they bought more property at an earlier period, they would 
have confiderably augmented the revenues of the community. 
However, though they have made but few purchafes, it does 
not appear, that they have alienated any property for a great 
many years paft. Confiderable funis have been laid out in 
public buildings, particularly upon a large and elegant court 
houfe, which they built about 3 years ago, for the accommoda- 
tion of the courts of juftice; and public meetings of the ftew 
artry. It coft above 60 ol. 

Cefs. In calculating the annual fupply, which is generally 

done iu April, we cannot avoid remarking a piece of injuftice 
in the mode of affeffing a certain clafs of the inhabitants. 
The fupply, which is about 40I. Sterling yearly, is levied, 
One half from burgh lands, and from merchants and tradef- 
men for their refpective trades 5 the other half is thrown en- 
tirely upon the tenants of houfes, while no part is Charged to 
the account of thofe who poffefs and occupy houfes as their 
ow?i property. Such an egregious deviation from all the

any burgh in the kingdom. But it is to be hoped, fuch an 
unequal taxation, where one defcription of perfons (and thofe 
by ho means the pooreft), is totally exempted, and another 
burdened with the whole fum, will foon be rectified. 

"Trade. — The town of Kirkcudbright had long ago a confi- 
derable inland trade, and a good fliare of commerce. No town 
was better fituated for it. How it carne to lofe it in a later

period, can be accounted for only from the contraband trade, 
wn.ch it afterwards carried on with the Ifle of Man. This 
illegal commerce deranged, for a while, all their ideas of fair 
and upright dealing. After this trade was fet afide, large 
imugglmg companies eftablifhed themfelves along the coaft of 
Galloway, and with a high hand braved, for fome time, all 
the efforts of government to fupprefs them. However, from 
the vigilance and activity of the revenue officers, eftablifhed 
at the port, and particularly thofe upon the coaft, this trade, 
has of late gradually declined. 

ManufaBures — About a year ago, fome faint appearances 
of manufaftories, in the cotton line, began to fhew them- 
felves . Mules and jennies have been erefted, and weavers 
brought from a diftance to work with the fly-fhuttle. A 
woollen manufactory is alfo begun, as well as a candle and 
foap manufactory. Should thefe branches happily fucceed, 
it would be of the utmoft advantage to this town. Would 
government take off the high duty upon the importation of 
coals*, which is the only fuel ufed in this place, it would 
afford great encouragement to thefe manufactories, and turn 
the attention of the people to a more certain profit, than they 
can exped from the precarious advantages which refult from 
fmuggling. 

Shipping. — Twenty-eight brigs and floops belong to the 
port and diftrict : tonnage, 1053. 

Vcjf t h. 

* The coals imported for three years part, within the cuftom-houfe diftrict 
cf this place, amounted, upon an average, to 1490 chalders. Of this quantity 
the town and parifh take the half, 755 chalders, which are equal to 605 tons. 
The duty of this is aojil. The price, at the rate of xl. 6s. per ton, is ^861. ios.

Courts and Public Offices, — The burgh of Kirkcudbright 
is the place exprefsly appointed by acl: of parliament, where 
the fteward's courts are to be held, and no where elfe. This 
court confifts of a fteward depute, who is the fupreme 
judge, a fteward clerk, and 7 folicitors, or procurators. The 
court meets every Friday, excepting during the time of vaca- 
tion. There is alfo a cuftom-houfe eftablifhed within the 
burgh. Formerly it was a member of the port of Dumfries. 
About 50 years ago it was disjoined from it, and eftablifhed 
a port of its own. It confifts of a colle&amp;or, comptroller, fur- 

veyor,

veyor, land waiter, 4 tidemen, and 4 boatmen. Within the 
diftrid there are 3 creeks, viz. Catcraig on Fleet, Balcarry 
&amp;ay, and Pow at Barlochan Mill, upon the river Urr. The 
dillria extends from the eaft fide of the river Urr, where it 
joins the diftrid of the cutiom-houfe of Dumfries, to the 
burn of Carfloath, where It conneds with Wigton cuftom- 
houfe, being about 50 miles in length. 

Schools — Within the burgh there are, 1 redorof the gram- 
mar fchool, 1 teacher of writing and arithmetic, and t teacher 
of Enghfh. The rector enjoys a falary of 30I. per annum, 
the other two have 30I. between them. The fcholars are 
Numerous, and well taught. Both the rector of the grammar 
fchool, and the writing mafter, keep boarders, at the rate of 
1 61. per annum,

Churchy &amp;x — The preferit minifter was ordained trie 27th 
of September 1770, is married, and has 13 children, viz, 
7 fons and 6 daughters. As to his flipend, he cannot well 
fay what it is. About 20 years ago he raifed a firmmorts of 
augmentation, with the concurrence and approbation of all his 
heritors; but from the violent contefts which afterwards arofd 
amongft them, about their adjufting their tiends, the locality 
is not yet finifhed. The unavoidable expence, in which thefe 
litigations have involved the miniller, is not lefs than 250 h 
Whether the heritors will lay this to heart, and reimburfe 
him, according to their promife at the commencement of the 
procefs, he cannot fay. When the locality is fixed, the whole 
ftipend, in money and victual, will not exceed 112I — a poor 
fum for fo rich and extenfive a parifh, and a populous royal 
burgh. — Though there are 3 gkbes in theparifli, yet the mi- 
nifter poffeffes only one, and it is the worjl of the three. It 
is the worft in quality, and fcarce the legal half in quantity.

He has no manfe, notwithstanding there were, in former times, 
3 churches, 3 manfes, and 3 glebes. Inftead of a manfe he 
jias 15I. per annum. This he had to contend for before the 
Court of Seffion. The fum is too fmall for the rent of a 
houfe in Kirkcudbright. 

CharaBer and Manners — The people of Kirkcudbright are, 
in general, of a pleafant, focial and agreeable difpofition, and 
their morals are fully as good as thofe of their neighbours. 
Few or none are ever incarcerated for crimes or mifdemeanors. 
Formerly they were faid to have been muchaddi&amp;ed to drinking, 
and perhaps there was fome truth in the report ; now, except 
amongft a very few of the lowell clafles, the charge would be 
unjuft. In point of tafte, they are much fuperior to moil 
people of the pariflies around them. Their reading is exten- 
iive j and being furnifhed with an excellent fubfcription lib- 
rary of the beft modern books, they have accefs to all the 
improvements in literature and politics. They are all loyal 
to government } and no lefs attached to the principles of the 
Britifh Conftitution, than averfe to divifions in the Church. 
No minifter in the church of Scotland can boaft of fuch una- 
nimity amongft his people : For among the whole 2,295 tnat 
compofe the parifh, there is not one difienter, or feceder, of 
any denomination whatever.

\ Near the Roman camp there is a Druidical temple, which was deftroyed 
within thefe eight years, by the handt of an ignorant Goth, who carried off the 
Hones, fplit them, and applied them to building a contemptible bridge over an 
infignificant rivulet, called Buciland Burn. The ftones were 7 in number, of 
round granite, and of unequal fizes. The fmalleft at leaft 3 feet in diameter. 
In Milton there are alfo two Britifh camps, and one Roman. (See the map.) 

I From the fituation and extent of this camp, it is extremely probable that 
the ancient Britons had here collected a confiderable force together to repel the 
invafion of the Romans, or perhaps to defend thcmfelvcs againft the plundering 
Danifli and Norwegian rovers, who, in a later period, infefted the coaft of Scot- 
land. At fome diftance from this camp, in the farm of Balmae, there was found 
a few years ago, by two ditchers, a ftraight plate of gold, which was fome- 
what thick at each end, and at the middle. It bent eafily at the centre, fo as 
to admit the two extremities to meet. But to whom it originally belonged, or

fupplied the camp with water ; for no water is to be found 
w here the camp ftood. It is all rocky g round.-In the farm 
of Lochfergus there is a large artificial lake, with two fmall

his fleet was wind-bound in this bay, as he was going to raife 
the fiege of Londonderry. Within the fame farm there is a 
remarkable cave, in the precipice on the fea more. From 
the entrance to the fartheft end it meafures 60 feet, but the 
height is unequal. It is narrow at the mouth, then gradually 
widens, rifing in height to 12 feet or more ; again it contrads, 
and at the end of 60 feet terminates. The door had been 
originally built with ftones, and had a lintel, which is now 
fallen down, and buried under the rubbilh. The cave itfelf 
is the work of nature. From its fequeftered fituation, and 
difficult accefs, amidft rocks and precipices, it appears to 
have been a hiding place in ancient times. It was not impro-

LAN, the laft Lord of Galloway, fucceeded to a confiderable fliare of the pro- 
perty of her father, and alfo to this caftle. When the conteft between the 
defendants of Balliol and Robert Bruce, for the crown of Scotland, terminated 
in favour of the latter, the property of Balliol in Galloway was forfeited, and 
beftowed by the King upon Archibald Douglas, brother to James, Lord of 
Douglas, for his eminent fervices in driving Edward Balliol out of the king- 
dom. This caftle remained in the hands of the Douglafes, Lords of Galloway, 
till 1455, when their vaft pofleffions in this country were forfeited, and annexed 
to the crown. James IV. gave a grant of this caftle, and fome lands belong- 
ing to it, to the burgh of Kirkcudbright, by a charter, dated at Edinburgh, 26th 
February 1509. It appears by another charter, dated at Kirkcudbright 1508, 
that the King had been here in perfon ; and the tradition is, that his Majefty 
had been hofpitably entertained by the burgh, and that they claimed fome re- 
ward for their former fervices to James II. when he was befieging the caftle of 
Tiief, and for recent fervices to himfelf ; wherefore his Majefty granted, with 
confetti of Parliament, the Caftle and Caftlemains to the town. At tin's time it 
was not under the jurifdicftion of the burgh ; but fince the King's grant, it has 
been alienated by the corporation, though the land ftill continues fubjecT: to a 
burgage tenure.

The town of Kirkcudbright bears fome marks of ancient 
fortifications. A deep ditch and a wall appear to have formerly 
fnrrounded it. Strong gates were alio placed at the entrance 
into the town, to prevent the approach of an enemy Thefe 
gates were pulled down not many years ago, to make way 
for building new houfes. Some remains of the ditch and wall 
are ft ill to be feen *. It is probable, that the ditch was then 
filled with water by the flowing tide; but from the retreat of 
the fea along this coafl, it does not at pfefent reach it.

Vaftle It hung over a very dreadful precipice above the Solway Frnh, and was 
disjoined from the main land by a deep fofiee, and aftrong wall next the cattle, 
with a draw-bridge of hard free-ftone, of an immenfe fize. The wall and 
draw-bridge were deftroyed only about 40 years ago ; the interior buildings 
perhaps more than aoo years before that period. At prefent nothing remains 
but the deep fofiee. This caftle was befieged and taken by William, Earl of 
Douglas, and Lord of Galloway, in 145a. Sir Patrick M'Clellan of 
JBombie, the proprietor, having incurred the difpleafure of this proud and law- 
less baron, partly from his connexion with Lord Herris, (who had withdrawn 
his dependence upon the Earl, and was hanged), and partly from his attachment: 
to his Sovereign, was feized in his own caftkj carried to the caftle of Tfief, con- 
demned, and difgracefully put to death. This family had another caftle at 
Bombie, within this parifli, from whence they tbek their title. It is now a 
heap of ruins.— In tracing the various remains of old caftles, which formerly be- 
longed to this powerful clan, together with their vaft poffeffions in land, one can- 
not help reflecting on the great inftability of human affairs, and the fad train of 
misfortunes, which fomctimes attend particular families more than others. Of 
all the great eftates that once belonged to this rcfpeflable family, there does not 
now remain one fingle foot of land to the heir male of the title, the prefent 
Lord Kirkcudbright.

Religious Houfes — In SpottifwoocPs Account of Religious 
Houfes in Scotland, notice is taken of the Francifcans, or Gray- 
Friars, having been eftablifhed at Kirkcudbright in the 12th 
century. Brother John Carpenter, who is faid to have been 
an excellent engineer, and dextrous in contriving all inftru- 
ments of war, was one of the perfons profeiTed in this place. But 
there are no records here, that can throw any light on the hif- 
tory of this order, whilll they continued at Kirkcudbright. 
The ancient records of this country, efpecially what belonged 
to the church, were carried off at the Reformation, by the 
Popifh clergy, and lodged either in the Vatican at Rome, or 
in the Scotch College at Paris. The prefent church, however, 
feems to have been built on the fame fpot of ground, which was 
formerly occupied by the Fratres minores,. or Grey Friars*.

Edward. He fent alfo a fummons to Kirkobrie (as he calls it), to come and 
make oath to the King's Majefty. Upon refufing, he marched with his party, 
and came to the town a little after fun-rifing. " But they, who faw us coming, 
" barred their gates, and kept their dikes ; for the town is diked on both fides, 
" with a gate to the water-ward, and a gate on the over end to the fell-ward." 
However, according to Sir Thomas's account, the town, though attacked, was 
not taken. Afterwards, indeed, they fent their commifiioners to Dumfries, and 
engaged to ferve the King's Majefty of England. This hiftorical anecdote, 
lhews that the town, at that time, was tolerably well fortified. 

* From the ancient records of the burgh r there appears, by a contract, dated 
54th March 1570, to have been given to the magiftrates, " the place and kirk 
" in the town of Kirkcudbright, quhilk fometime pertained to the Friars minors 
,* of Kiikcudhright; alfo ane kirk within the burgh, called St. Andrews Kirt,

" M'Clelland, and John Mitchell, the chalmers and yeards, which they occupy 
" at the date hereof, for their liferent-"— After the rcftoration of epii'copacy in 
Scotland, notice is taken of a great tumult having happened, in 1663, upon 
the admiffion of a curate into the parifh of Kirkcudbright. The Lords of hi

examine into the matter, and convene befo.re them all fuch as were concerned

There are no veftiges at prefcnt to fhew that it was ongina 11, 
a priory. Two gates that led to it were many years ago de- 
nied. The outer one, which was placed about half a 
mile diftant from the priory, and about an equal diftance from 
the town, ftill retains its ancient name, the Great Crofs. lhe 
inner gate, which led immediately to a group of cells, the 
habitation of the monks, was called the Little Crofs. All 
thefe cells and buildings were pulled down, and removed 
about a century ago, and the ground now applied by his 
Lordfhip to a much better ufe, in extending his beautiful 
pleafure ground, than ferving the purpofes of folly andfuper-

At the meeting of the commiffioners at Kirkcudbright, John Lord Kirkcud- 
bright, and many others, were arretted and fent prifoners to Edinburgh, for re- 
fufing to quell the tumult and admit the curate. Many women in the town, 
who had been moft active in railing the mob, were condemned by the com- 
miffioners to Hard at the market croft for fcveral market days, with a paper 
on their face, intimating their crime, and then bound over to keep the peace. 
The magiftrates were appointed to execute the fentence.

eaft fide of the ifle, the workmen, in digging and removing the fliells, acci- 
dentally difcovered the fceletons of 14 people, who had been buried under 
them. They were regularly placed alongft the fide of each other, with their 
heads to the weft, and their feet to the eaft. One of them feemed to be dif- 
tinguHhed from the reft, by a row of thin ftones placed around him. Probably 
he had been fome chief among them. How they came to be interred in that 
particular fpot, when there was a burying place adjoining, which belonged to 
the monks, can only be explained, by fuppofing them to have been buried there, 
long before the priory exifted. Be that as it will, the prefent Earl, with great 
humanity, caufed all the bones to be carefully collected, put into boxes, and 
again interred in the Galtway church-yard.

<p>Ere £i ion and Names. 

TlORGUE, Senwicx and Kirkandrews, were united 
about the year 1670. Borgue, or Borg, the genera! 
name of the united pariflies, is derived from the Gaelic word 
burg, which fignifies a little hill, and is certainly very de- 
fective, either of the fituation of the church, which is placed 
on a beautiful eminence, in the middle of the parifh, or of the 
general appearance of this diftrid of land, which is remark- 
ably unequal in its furface. Senwick (originally Sandwick), 
is compounded of f and and wick, two Gaelic words, fignify- 
Jng a narrow neck of land. This is alfo very defcriptive, 
both of the fituation and foil. Kirkandrews evidently takes 
its name from the tutelary faint of Scotland, to whom it was 
dedicated^ 

Situation 



Statiftical Account 

Situation and Extent.— This parifh is fituated in the fouther* 
extremity of the ftewartry of Kirkcudbright. It extends 
farther fouth than any land in Scotland, one point in the mire 
of Galloway excepted. Its greater! length is 10 miles, and 
its greateft breadth 7. The figure of it is very irregular, and 
the whole extent may be computed at 40 fquare miles. 

Sea Coaft and Fi/h. — There are upwards of 1 5 miles of 
fea coaft, nearly half the circumference of the whole parifh. 
On this coaft are the following bays : Rofs Bay, which af- 
fords a fafe and commodious harbour for fhips ; Bridgehoufe 
and Kirkandrews bays, where veffels of light burthen anchor 
occafionally, in fine weather ; and Knockbrix Bay, which is a 
better haven than the two former, but much expofed to fbuth 
and wefterly winds. The other parts of the coaft are all 
rocky : For the moft part it is bold and elevated ; and in 
fome places the cliffs rife 200 or 300 feet perpendicular ; and 
as this coaft is very much expofed to the fouth and weft 
winds, the fea often rolls in upon it with prodigious force, 
and forms a fcene grand and awful beyond defcription. The 
fpray formed by the dafhing furge, is fometimes carried to 
the diftance of two miles. It blafts the crops, and impairs 
vegetation on the coaft ; but enriches and fertilizes the fields 
which lie beyond it. — Samphire grows among the rocks in 
great abundance. Confiderable quantities of other marine 
plants are gathered for making kelp. Cod, fkate and flounder; 
lobfters, oyfters, and other kinds of fhell fhh, are alio found ; 
but it has never been efteemed a good fifhing coaft. Perhaps 
no good fiftiers have ever made the experiment. 

Surface, Soil, \Sc The furface of the ground, it has been

high hills, yet an acre of level ground is fcarcciy to be found

ia any part of the parifli. The little hills, which rife every 
where, and in all the varieties of fbape, are nothing but 
maffes of rocks, covered with a thin ftratum of earth. The 
foil is, for the moll part, a fine loam, fometimes intermixed 
with fand or gravel, and either founded on a rock, or hard 
gravelly bottom. Hence it is extremely kindly, and, in wet 
feafons, very productive, either in crop or pafturage ; but it 
is foon exhaufted by tillage, and eafily injured by drought. 
Any level ground, which was to be found among the numer- 
ous little hills, originally conlifted of mofs ; which is now al- 
moft entirely confumed in digging for fuel or marl, and hath 
left nothing but morafles and pits of Handing water. 

ProfpeBs. — The rifing grounds, in many different places of 
this parifh, afford very beautiful profpe&amp;s. The writer of 
this article has reckoned 15 or 16 different views of the fea, 
prefented through the openings among the little hills. A very 
extenfive view is exhibited of the circumjacent country, the 
furface of which is finely diversified. On the one fide ftands 
Kirkcudbright, and the feat of the Earl of Selkirk ; on the 
other, Wigton, Garliefton, and Whitehorn, the feat of the 
Earl of Galloway. Behind, are the mountains of Gallo- 
way, rifing gradually above one another at proper diftances; 
Before, Whitehaven, Workington, and other towns. The Ifle 
of Man, St. Bee's Head, and the lofty mountains of England, 
ftretching out to an extent of 60 or 70 miles, form the limits 
of the varied fcene — There are no rivers or lakes which de- 
ferve to be mentioned 5 and very little wood, except a few 
fmall plantations around gentlemen's feats. 

Climate and Difeafes. — The climate does not admit of that 
extent and variation, that takes place in the inland and moun- 
tainous parts of the country. The cold is never fo intenfe

in winter, and perhaps the heats are not greater in fummer, 
from the well known efTefts of fea breezes, to cool the air in 
the one feafon, and to warm it in the other. Owing perhaps 
to this caufe, confumptious are lefs common than in other 
places of Scotland. Febrile difeafes are more frequent than in 
the higher diftricls. Agues forrherly prevailed very much. 
There has not, however, been one inflance of this diforder for 
9 or 10 years paft *. Rheumaiifm feems now to be the mofh 

prevalent 

* Similar obfervations have been made in other ftatiftical hiftories, and va* 
rious caufes afligned. It is furely worth while to investigate the true caufe of 
facts fo remarkable. The following theory is- fubmitted with diffidence to the 
public, if admiffible in a publication which is intended chiefly for a record of 
faefs, 

Marjh Mia/ma is afligned as the remote caufe of intermittent fevers; am? 
when fuch difeafes become lefs prevalent, it is very natural to fuppofe, that the 
draining of marfhes or moffes muft be the occafion of it. Eut in this diftricl 
do moffes or marfhes have been drained, of any confequence, for many years 
paft ; n»r has any other remarkable alteration happened to affect the falubrity 
of ihe air, except what may be fuppofed to arife from the fuperior cultivation 
of the ground. When land is deepened and pulverifed, in confequence of im- 
provements, by lime, fhells, and marl, it abforbs the rains more quickly and 
plentifully. Hence lefs moifture will arife in evaporation ; lefs water alfo will 
run along the furface, and ftagnate in the hollows, which are here to be found 
in almoft every field. The water thus collected fooner acquires a noxious qua- 
lity, than that which is in moffes, which are commonly fed by fubterraneous 
fpiings and running rivulets. Increafed vegetation will diminifh evaporation; 
for water is abforbed in considerable quantities by the plants thcmfelves ; and 
in proportion to their luxuriance, they diminifli the reflection of the fun's rays, 
and keep the air more cool and temperate during the heats of funmier and au- 
tumn. Moreover, it has been proved by Lavoisier and others, that water 
contains pure air and inflammable air : and alfo, that it fhimmable and bad airs 
are in a great meafure the food of plants. Thus,, by increasing vegetation, that 
inflammable air, which is hurtiul to animals, is abforbed in greater quantities. 
Water alfo is dec mpcunded by them; the noxious parts it contains are returned; 
and a vafl quantity of vital air is produced. Hence we may conclude, that 
cultivation of the ground will in various ways contribute to remove the caufe of 

agues,

prevalent diforder in this parifti. It may in a good meafure 
be afcribed to fcarcity of fuel, and cold and damp houfes. 
From greater attention to cleanlinefs, and a more plentiful 
ufe of vegetables and frefh animal food, fcorbutic and cuta- 
neous difeafes are lefs prevalent than formerly. Inoculation 
for the fmall pox is generally and fuccefsfully employed— 
The climate, it appears, is favourable to longevity. On the 
I ft of January laft, rsj perfons were alive upwards of 80. 
One of 09, a tinker by trade, bids fair for rivalling his brother 
Marshall, celebrated in the annals of Croffmichael. He can 
drink a glafs from the i'olc of his foot; and in feats of ftrength 
and agility, would furpafs molt men of 60. His teeth were 
all double, and moft of them yet remain faft in their fockets. 

Population. — The number of inhabitants has increafed above 
one tenth within thefe 40 years, as appears from the follow- 
ing

the air which is favourable for promoting general health. Greater length of 
time, and a greater number of inftances, are doubtlefs neceiTary to prove, with 
full conviction, that fuch difeafes become lefs prevalent as the lands are better 
cultivated. It is no uncommon thing f6r particular difeafes to appear at certain 
periods, to rage for a while with great violence, and again to difappear for 
fome time entirely, until fome peculiar ftatc of the air takes place, when they 
again appear, and run their courfe as formerly. Thefe remarks, however, it is 
hoped may be ufeful, to excite farther inquiry into, a matter, which is lo pecu- 
liarly interefti.ng.

Cultivation — The farms let at from 8s. to il. per acre. 
Both foil and climate are favourable to early feed-time and 
harveft. Seed-time ufually begins about the ift of March, 
a,nd harveft about the 10th of Auguft. Agriculture, 
though much improved of late years, is not yet perhaps in 
that improved ftate, which might be expected from the ad- 
vantages of foil and climate, and from the eafy and independ- 
ent circumftances of the farmers. About one half of the land 
is arable; and feldom one fourth of the arable land is in crop. 
The manures chiefly employed are lime (hells and marl. 
Marl is found on moft farms of the parifh. It t was ufed 
firft of any of the above manures, and anfwered extremely 
well for two rotations of crops. But it is obferved, that it 
feldom does much good when employed a fecond time ; nor 
do lime and fhells anfwer well after it. ShelU are found in 
great abundance in all the different bays, and eiteemed the 
belt of all thefe manures. One fmall vein of limellone has 
alfo been difcovered, but fo trifling as not to defray the ex- 
pence of workmanfhip.

produce. — The principal crops are oats and barley. Twice 
as much of both is produced as to ferve the inhabitants oS 
the parifti. The furplus is exported to England and the weft 
of Scotland. Wheat, flax and hemp are alfo reared ; but in 
fmall quantities. The foil is doubtlefs well adapted for tur- 
nips, peafe, and other green crops ; but they have never been 
cultivated to a great extent. The land is feldom laid out in 
fufficient heart. Compoft and dunghills, the moft valuable of 
all manures for a thin and kindly foil, are rarely ufed. 

Hi/advantages. — Three circumftances concur to check im- 
provement in agriculture : Short leafes of farms, want o£ 
ftraw yards, and fcarcity of labourers. Where the proprietor 
gives only a leafe for a few years, fcarce any reftridtions he 
can impofe, or any encouragements he will give, are fufficient 
to induce the tenant to meliorate his farm. No manure is 
found to be of lafting advantage in this country, except dung ; 
which cannot be collected in fufficient quantities, in any other 
way but by keeping the cattle in houfes, or ftraw yards ; which 
no tenant will erect at his own expence, without a very long 
leafe. Of this proprietors begin to be fenfible. Some time ago^ 
the Earl of Selkirk, and lately Mr. Gairie of Dunroad, have 
erected llraw yards and farm houfes, on a very elegant and 
liberal plan. Others, it may be expected, will foon follow 
the example — Owing to the great increafe of manufactures 
in the neighbourhood, it is extremely difficult to find a fuf- 
ficient number of labourers, for carrying on improvements in 
agriculture. The price of labour is nearly doubled within 
thefe laft 15 years, and is now perhaps as high as in any 
place in Scotland ; and as the price of grain is very little raifed 
in that period, this muft alfo prove a material obftacle to the 
improvement of lands. 

Black 



3 8 Stafjfiical Account 

Black Cattle.-The natur,! verdure of the foil, the tem- 
perature of the climate, and the great abundance of fhelter 
afforded from the inequalities of the furface, concur to render 
this one of the fineft grazing countries in Scotland : And the 
farmers, as might be expected, have long been famous for 
their fkill ,n the management of cattle. Trials have been 
made of different forts of black cattle, from England, Ire- 
land, and the Me of Man \ but none have been found to an 
fwer fo well as the true Galloways. The farmers here are 
as attentive to the fhapes of cattle, as a jockey is to the propor- 
tions of a horfe. Even an eye or an ear is not to be overlook- 
ed. Some of their obfervations may appear whimfical ; but 
in general, they are certainly well founded ; for one of good 
proportions is always eafily kept, foon fattened, and, as Mr. 
Ramfay has obferved, « commonly tells well at the end of 
" the balance." It is to be regretted, that few of the cattle 
here are kept to fufficient age, or fed out for (laughter. When 
this is done, no beef in the world exceeds it. They are com- 
monly bought up for the Englifh markets, at % and 3 years 
old. An ox or heifer, of 1 year old, fells from 3 1. to 5I. • of 
2, from 5I. to 7I. ; and of 3, from 7I. to iol. 

Sheep and Horfes There are fix different kinds of fheep 

in this parifli : the Spanijb flieep, introduced by Lord Baer ; 
the Shetland, introduced by Mr. Thompson; the Cheviot 
fine-woolled iheep brought from the fhire of Galloway ; the 
common muir or black faced iheep , the mug, and the Bake- 
well breeds. The 3 firfl kinds were only introduced Iaft 
year. It is . intended to try a pure breed of all the different 
kinds, and alfo to crofs them various ways, which will molt 
probably lead to ufeful difcoveries for the improvement of 
wool. The muir fheep are only bought in annually, and fatted 
for the butcher. The mug and Bakewell, or an intermixture 

of 



of B argue. * 39 

of both, coiucitutes the ftaple of the country. The average 
price of wool, of the ftieep bred in the parilh, is 163. per 
(lone, of, 28 lb. avoirdupois. Muir weep, brought down in 
harveft, anfwer very well without fmearing, and the wool 
improves in quality. The wool of the Cheviot appears to be 
of the fame quality with that of the natives. The Cheviot 
ftieep are very well made. By crofiing the breed of them 
with the Shetland, whofe wool is remarkably fine, it is pro- 
bable that both the quality of the wool and of the mutton will 
be improved. — The foil here is no lefs adapted for horfes than 
for cattle. Not many are reared for fale ; though, under proper 
management, they commonly -pay extremely well, and are 
efteemed much more durable, for the purpofes of agriculture, 
than either the Englifti or Iri£h, which are foretimes intro- 
duced. 



Commerce, Manitfatlures and Fuel. — The prices of vivres 
of all kinds are regulated by Kirkcudbright, which is our 
neareft market town, being only four milts diftaut. This 
diftricl: has long been defervedly celebrated lor fine honey. 

It is clear as cryftal, and of the richeft flavour A fmall 

manufa&amp;ure of cotton has lately been eftabliftied at Kirk- 
andrews, where a village is alio begun, but does not feem to 
increafe with rapidity. Until the duty on coal is taken off, 
it is not to be cxpeded, that population will greatly increafe, 
or manufactures of any kind be carried on with fpirit. This 
partial and oppreffive tax is highly prejudicial to agriculture, 
as well as to manufadures. The farmer muft be employed 
during a confiderable part of the fummer months, in prepar- 
ing and bringing home his peats ; the materials of which are 
with great difficulty dug from deep pits, carried to a confi- 
derable diftance, and muft afterwards be mixed with water, 
kneaded, and formed into loaves, after the manner that the

but the heritors, it is not doubted, will foon repair them 
handfomely. They have lately ere&amp;ed an exceeding good 
fchool-houfe. The fchool is well attended, and the emolu- 
ments may be averaged at 30I. a year. The poor are fup- 
plied from the colle&amp;ions in the church, which ufually are 
between 25I. and 30I. annually, and from the interefl of 140!.

Antiquities. — There are four or five moats in different parts 
of the parifh ; one of which, {the Dun of Borelancf), is very 
remarkable. Its fituation is confpicuous, and commands a 
very extenfive profpeft of the circumjacent country. Its form 
is exactly circular, and at the top about 40 yards diameter. 
The foflee with which it is furrounded, is 10 feet deep, and 
7 or 8 in breadth at the bottom. At the diftance of a bow

intelligence, that the duty on coils is taken off. The advantages of this will 
foon be felt among all ranks; and it will fcarcely admit of a doubt, that in a 
fhort time it will prove equally advantageous to the Siate. For, at a moderate 
calculation, the diftrid of Galloway alone will, in ten years, contain 10,000 
more inhabitants, who will pay thrice as much to Government, in t ./her taxes, 
as is paid at prefent by the duty on coal.

fliot from it, and on lower ground, there is another of the 
fame kind, and nearly of the fame circumference. This is 
alfo furrounded with a foffee, which had been filled with wa- 
ter, but is now become dry, from the draining of a mofs 
adjoining to it*. 

Former State of the Pari/h. —hbout the beginning of this 
century, the number of farms had been double, or nearly triple, 
■What it is at prefent. Four or fix horfes were yoked to u 
plough, which is now drawn by two or three. The lands, 
notwithftanding, were miferably cultivated ; the cattle poorly 
fed ; farms every where overftocked ; and beafts of all kiads 
grazed prorriifcuoufly. Hence, though the foil was grateful, 

Vol. XL F and 



* In this mofs, pieces of fpears, and an oldulver coin (the infcription effaced), 
were lately found. It is natural to conje&amp;ure, from the above particulars, tha t 
they had been intended for military ftations ; for which, in the opinion of fome 
gentlemen of the army, who lately vifited them, they are very well adapted. 
The remains of a ftrong fortification are alfo vifible in the farm of Corneas. It 
is fituated on a ftupendous rock, which juts into the fea. It is of a triangular 
form. On two fides the rock nfes nearly zoo feet perpendicular. On the land fide, 
it is fortified by two ftrong entrenchments, and a mound, the original height of 
which cannot now be afcertained, as it is almoft entirely demolifiied. In other 
places of the Ihore, at the bottom of very remarkable cliff's, there are two or 
three curious caves. One of them evidently feems to have been artifical ; it ic 
uncertain for what purpofe it had been intended. The moft remarkable favft, of 
which any memory is preferved by tradition, is the robbery of the chuich of 
Senwick by French pirates. The church, at that time, contained a very confi- 
derable quantity of plate, which the Frenchmen plundered, and had fafely e- 
fcapedwith their booty; but a ftorm arifing immediately after they had put to 
fea, the fhip was dalhed upon a rock, at a little diftance from the Ihorc, oppofitc 
to the church, and every perfon on board perilhed. In memory of this event, 
the rock has ever fince been ftyled the Frenchman' t Rock.— There are two fine 
old ruins in the parilh ; one of them called the tower of Bolmangan, the other 
Flunton Caflt. Tradition has preferved nothing certain concerning them.

Prefent State .-The rents of land at p re fent are i ncreafed m 
the proportion of 4 or even 6 to x. The quantity of ftock is 
greatly dimmifbed. Many of the farmers, notwithftanding,have 
attained to opulence; all of them are independent, and enjoy the 
comforts, and many of the pleafures of life, in no inconflder . 
able degree. The difadvantages, under which they labour are 
comparatively few; and they enjoy advantages more than 
fufficient to make ample compenfation. Befides the advan- 
tages of foil and climate already mentioned, we apprehend it 
may be added, that their farms, in general, are of a proper 
extent ; that they are at a proper dittance from market 
towns ; that they need few articles, of importation, and have 
a ready fale and eafy conveyance for articles of exportation; 
and that there are no villages, or fmall manufacturing towns in 
the parifh. The laft of thefe, we are aware, is ufually claffed 
under the oppofite head. The politician, doubtlefs, ought to 
confider the want of villages and manufactures as an evil, 
becaufe it is unfriendly to population, and increafe of national 
revenue ; but the philofopher, with more enlarged and better 
fentiments, forbears to lament the lofs, when he confiders 
their pernicious influence on the morals, health and happinefs 
of mankind. It cannot efcape the notice of the attentive ob- 
ferver, that, in villages, the moll worthlefs and wretched part 
of fociety is commonly to be found. Thither the dregs of the 
community, from all quarters, are poured in. Every incentive 
to vice is prefented, and no proper police is eftabliflied to give 
a check to the growing evil. Where villages are founded, 
manufactures ought indeed invariably to be eftabliflied, as the 
beft means to give encouragement to induftry ; which wiH 
opperate as a more effectual check to the progrefs of vice, and

contribute more to the felicity of the inhabitants, than the beft 
code of municipal laws, or the moft rigid exercife of that 
power which is vefted in baron bailies. Pafturage and agri- 
culture are, doubdefs, of all employments, the moft favourable 
to the health and morals of mankind. Perhaps it is of ad- 
vantage where both are blended together. The leifure and 
opportunities of facial intercourfe, afforded by the one, lead 
to indolence and diffipation; the hard and unremitted labour 
of the other impairs the vigour of the mind, and contracts 
the feelings of the heart: but the evils arifmg from either, 
are, in a great meafure, corrected by the intermixture of 
both. 

Character — Thefe obfervations have been fuggefte c'/rom 
taking a view of the occupations and character, of the inha»» 
bitants of this 'pariih ; who are, in general, rational in their 
fentiments; liberal in their opinions; cheerful in their tempers; 
active and intelligent in their profefiion ; fatisfied with their 
own condition, and fympathifing with the diftreffes of others. 
The cottager lives long under the fame mafter ; the tenant 
feldom changes his landlord: the progenitors of the prefent 
race, centuries ago, inhabited the parifh, and, in many inftan- 
ces, the very farms which their offspring now inhabit. They 
are all allied by confanguinity or marriage ; a circumft ance 
which prevents jealoufies, envyings and contentions, and 
doubtlefs contributes to that obliging intercourfe with one 
another, for which they are remarkable. Religious differences 
are unkuown ; and, though very moderate in their religious 
fentiments, they have, from time immemorial, been regular in 
attending public worfhip.-It is not, however, to be denied, 
that, from two caufes, the morals of the inhabitants of this 
country have fullered material injury : x/t, From finuggling, 
•which feldom fails to beget habits of intemperance : And,

* When the Me cf Man was an independent principality, the temptations to 
fmuggling were fo great, that all claffes of people became adventurers. Since 
that period, and particularly fince the duties on tea and fpirits were leffencd, 
fmuggling hath gradually declined ; and, of late years, through the great vigi- 
lance of the excife and cuftom-houfe officers, it hath heen almoft entirely fup- 
preffed. In confequence of a late wife regulation, obliging all who keep public 
houfes, to take licences, a regulation which, in this country, is ftri5tly enforced, 
all unneceffary public houfes are in like manner fuppreffed ; the happy effeds »f 
which cannot fail to be generally experienced.

fTHHE parifh of Rerrick is in length io miles, and in

uneven. On the north ftands Bencairn, a pretty high moun- 
tain, with a few inferior ones round its bafe, all covered with 
heath ; the reft: confvfts of mofs, meadow, plain fields, and 
fwelling eminences ; the whole is arable, excepting thofe parts 
on the north, and the different moffes, one of which contains 
about 300 acres, another 40, and another 30 j befides feveral 
others, and two little lakes, that merit no particular descrip-

what is commonly called a bold more. Here the profpeft

land view, you have an extent of about 50 miles, terminated 
by Cairnfmoor, the hills of Carfphairn and Queenfberry.

On turning round, you have lying before you the Frith, 10 
leagues broad, extending, on the left hand, about 30 miles 3 
and, on the right, until it is loft in the Irifli Sea. On the

Workington, Herrington, Parton, and Whitehaven, with the 
intervening fields and hedges : All of which, except the laft, 
are diftindltly feen by the naked eye. On the back of thefe 
appear the Cumberland mountains, towering one above ano- 
ther ; but all overtopped by the lofty Shidda ; which, how- 
ever, feems to have a competitor in Criffle, on the oppofite 
Jhore, in the neighbourhood of Dumfries. Thefe mountains 
have the effect, as it were, of throwing the Frith into a fliade, 
by which every objed is more diftin£lly perceived, and the 
beauty of the whole greatly increafed. From the point of 
St. Bee's to the Ifle of Man, lying in the Irifli fea, is an ex- 
tent of 1 1 leagues ; and from thence to the point of White- 
horn, of about 9 ; the whole track forming a curve of about 
90 miles ; which, from feveral parts of the parifli, the eye 
can take in diftin&amp;ly at once. But what completes the gran- 
deur of the fcene, is, the variety of veflels that appear fcattered 
every where, often to the number of 4c, 50, and 60. And 
as molt of the ftations from whence it is feen, Hand high, and 
the view reaches to the mouth of St. George's Channel, and 
towards the north of Ireland, (confequently very extenlive), 
the veflels, by a well known law in optics, feem elevated one 
above another, according to their diftance, till the fartheft ap- 
pear as if dropping out of the clouds : So that, in a certain 
ftate of the atmofphere, it looks like an immenfe canvas hung 
down from heaven, with thefe veflels pictured upon it. 

Fijh. The tide in the Frith runs from E. to W. with con- 
fiderable rapidity. Reafoning from analogy, and calculating 
from appearances, it is generally concluded, that there are

great plenty and variety of fi(h on the coaft, though hither^ 
there have been no fpirited exertions to afcertain the truth of 
this. There have indeed been feveral feeble attempts made 
in the Bay of Hefton, which have proved fuccefsful, and cor- 
roborated the common opinion. Along the whole ihore, but 
particularly about Helton, there is plenty of fhell fifh of th* 
common kinds. 

Minerals — In the lands of Lord M'Cartney, there is a rich 
iron mine, which was opened up and carried on for fome time 
by an Englilh company, but is now defifted from : Not, how- 
ever, that it is by any means exhaufted ; but owing entirely 
to the expence and inconvenience of flapping it. The coaft 
every where abounds with free-ftone, which hath been much 
in requeft of late, for the ornamental parts of fome of the moft 
elegant houfes, both in this and the neighbouring parifhes ; 
and laft year it was carried by land, at the ditlance of 12 
miles, to one of the molt magnificent ftructures in the country. 
There are no lefs than three places on the more, which have 
been laid open, and declared, by act. of parliament, to be free 
ports, viz, Balcarry, formerly mentioned, on the E, ; Port 
Mary, (fo called from Mary Queen of Scots taking fhipping 
after the battle of Langfide), on the S. ; and Mullock Bay on 
the S. W. The fir ft of thefe is fafe and commodious by na- 
ture ; the other two might be made fo, by a little affiftance 
from art ; that at Port Mary efpecially, by expending a few- 
hundred pounds upon it, might be rendered inconceivably ad- 
vantageous. And as all the gentlemen, whofe properties lie 
contiguous to it, are very public fpirited, it is to be hoped, 
that, in this improving age, they will foon take up the matter 
in a ferious light. 

Exports,

of Re -nek. 49 

jfxports and Imports, %£c. — This is tlie more e^rneftly to he 
wifht d for, as a fpirit of improvement, introduced here only 
about 25 years ago, is {till advancing ; and confequ^ntly ihe 
articles of export and import are daily multiplying and in- 
creafing. As a fpecimen, the annual importation of lime, for 
the purpofes of building and manure, is about 10,000 bufhels ; 
befides confiderable internal refources of marl, fhells, and 
fea flime. And there are exported, at an average, 15,280 
Hones of meal ; 116 tons of potatoes ; 800 bufhels of barley j 
231 of bear, and 198 of wheat. 

Cultivation and Improvements. — Whether it is owing to the 
foil, which in many places is cold and fpungy, or to its ele- 
vation and expofure to the fea, even where it is dry, in a 
country entirely naked with refpeft to wood, or to the want 
of convenient and fufficient fubdivifions, or to whatever other 
affignable caufe, is not determined ; but the farmers do not 
find their account in cultivating the laft mentioned article, 
(wheat) ; fo that very little attention, in general, has hitherto 
been paid to it. Thefe inconveniences, however, with many 
other obftru&amp;ions to the improvement of hufbandry, are daily 
removing, by the united exertions of the gentlemen, in plant- 
ing, repairing roads, inclofing ground, and binding down 
tenants to certain regulations. The yearly fund, denominated 
road-money, is about 40I. ; which is often confiderably aug- 
mented by handfome donations from fome of the proprietors. 
And fo prevalent is the laudable ambition of wiping off the 
reproach of our country, in refped of its wanting wood, that, 
within thefe few years, there have been planted, in the parifti, 
upwards of 170,000 foreft trees ; befides feveral new orchards, 
to which the proprietors are paying the utmott attention, by 
collefting plants from the places molt noted for nurferies.

Cattle. 



5° Statiftical Account 

Cattk.-But while the gentlemen and principal farmers are 
thus ftudying and promoting agriculture, a principal mare of 
their attention, and that of the tenants in general, is ftill 
paid to black cattle, which here, as Well as over all Galloway, 
continues to be the ftaple commodity of the country ; and no 
part of the Stewartry perhaps is fuperior to feveral farms : n 
this corner, both for rearing and fattening. The lands be- 
longing to Mr. Ross M'KlE give daily proofs, that this is 
neither a partial nor a rafh affertion.— The live flock of the 
•whole parifh is as follows, vi?.

Cows, - - 382 Sheep,'' - - 258-

The black cattle are the produce of our own country, with a 
fmallmixture of Highland and Irifh breed. The horfes are 
moftly Galloways ; many of them are reared in the parifh, 
efpecially of late years, fince their value came to be rated fo 
high. And the Iheep, (excepting thofe in the hands of a few, 
of a fuperior kind), are the defcendants of the old inhabitants of 
the moors and mountains, of a fmall fize and with coarfe wool j 
the beft here felling at 15s., and the ordinary run at us. and 
12s. per ftone there being no woollen manufacture as yet 
ere&amp;ed in this country, to induce the farmers to pay due at- 
tention to the breed. 

Natural Curiq/lties. — On the march, in the northern corner 
of the parifh, within -the property of Mr. Douglas of Or- 
chardtown, there is a fmall ftream, which comes gurgling 
down from the mountain.', in which are found a certain kind 
of litile ftones, of a very ftriking figure and quality, quite 
tranfparent, with a faint colour of purple, and fo hard, that

:h ey wiH eut glafs like a diamond. They grow on the rocks 
that overhang the rivulet in large clutters, about the fize of 
pin heads, where they continue to vegetate (as maybe collect 
ed from the different ftages of their progrefc, evidently there 
to be feen) till they are near an inch long and 3. diameter; 
when dropping out of their fockets, they fall into the water, 
and mix with the gravel at the bottom of the rill. The end 
that fat in the focket, very much refembles that part of a 
tooth which fticks in the jaw ; the other end of moft of them 
is tapered ; and (which is the great and inexplicable pheno- 
menon), are cut into triangular, quadrangular, and various 
other figures, as neatly and diftinftiy, as if they had come 
through the hands of the beft lapidary in the kingdom. . How 
frequently thefe rocks bring to maturity, and caft off their 
fingular fruit, whether in 50, 100, or 1000 years, cannot be 
fo much as gueffed at. 

Population and Longevity. — The return to Dr. Webfter, 

in 1755, was - I0 S I 
The prefent number of the inhabitants of the parifh is 1050 

Decreafe, I 

As there is at prefent no parifli regifter, the average of births, 
burials, &amp;c cannot, with any precifion, be afcertained. Thefe 
particulars, however, may be calculated with an accuracy 
quite fumcierit for any public or political purpofe, from the 
ample data already afforded from places where regiflers are 
kept; taking into confideration this circumftance, that the 
people here, in general, enjoy good health, and many of them 
long life. As a proof of this, there died, within thefe lafl 
5 years, no lefs than 9 perfons, who had all arrived at the ad- 
vanced period of between 8o. and 90. And at this day there 

G a are

are living 15 more, who have nearly attained the feme age. 
One woman in particular is 87, and has the ufe of all her 
fenfes and faculties. 

From certain appearances it might, at firft view, be con- 
cluded, that this parilh had decreafed greatly in its population 
during the laft 50 years, there being feveral large farms now 
occupied by one tenant only, which at that period was divided 
amongmany One of thefein particular, which pays about 500I. 
does not contain above 1 j fouls. And there are 5 other farms, 
in which tradition fays there then lived about 50 families ; 
whereas they do not at prefent contain above 20. But to thefe 
plaulible arguments for depopulation, are oppofed the follow- 
ing facts : In the \ft place, There never was any emigration 
from the parilh during this half century, worthy to be term- 
ed fuch : idly, That although in the farms alluded to, there, 
is but one principal family, yet they are generally pretty large, 
through the number of fervants that are neceifary to manage 
them : That although the two villages have been but 

litile, yet they have been fomewhat enlarged : ^thly, That 
there are no w families rending in feveral other places of 
the parilh, which formerly were wild, and without an in- 
habitant. 

Church, \$c. — It may be added, as no fmall prefumption in 
favour of the increafe of the population, that the parilh church, 
which was enlarged in the year 1743, has for thefe feveral 
years been too fmall, and laft year received a confiderable ad- 
dition. At the fame time, the manfe and office houfes were 
rebuilt ; in which the heritors have lhewn their generofity, 
and politely expreffed their refpf cl for the order of the clergy ; 
Which example is fo comple ely imitated by the tenants, 
and every o'her description of 1 1 ; e inhabitants, that no member 
of the church 01 Dcotiand need be happier than the incumbent

of Rerrick. And this is no temporary effufion, extorted by 
diftinguiflied merit, or a tribute paid only to popular talents ; 
but, like a natural principle, operates fteadily from one ge- 
neration to another j founded, probably, on this very fingular 
circumftance, that there have been, not only no violent fettle- 
ments, but there hath never been fo much as a vacancy in the 
parifli, fince the year 1691 ; the late and prefent incumbent 
having both been fo happy as to be the unanimous choice of 
the people j having been ordained affiltants and fucceffors 
to their refpeftive predeceffors. The ftipend, exclufive of 
the glebe, and the allowance for communion elements, is 
83I. 6s. 8d. 

p oor —The funds arifing from the weekly colleaions, and 
a few donations from fome of the humane and confiderate 
proprietors, are quite fufficient for the fupport of our poor ; 
there being only 6 on the roll, t,hat are regularly fupplied, and 
4 more occafionaly relieved. And it now appears, that the 
aid of the feffion will be ftill lefs reforted to, through the ready 
method of earning fubfiftence in fome department or other of 
the manufactures*. This is one of the many advantages flow- 
ing from this new fource of induftry. Amidft thefe, however, 
two evils are to be dreaded : The one is, leafl parents, either 
from needy circumftances, or from an avaricious difpofition, 
Ihould negleft the education of their children, and thereby 
facrifice the neceffary information of their minds, to the fup- 
ply of their own tables. The other is, lelt thole who have 
the principal management of the bufinefs, and the power of 
hiring and difcharging the hands, fliould not be men of a fin-

Schools—The only defcription of the inhabitants that 
defhtute of the neceffary means of fubfiftence, are our f chool 
mafters, of whom we have two, one in each village, which 
are diftant 4 Englito miles. The falary, it is true, is the 
maximum allowed by law, viz. nl. 6s. 8d., of which 7 1 go 
to the fchoolmafter at the Abbey, (which is looked upon as 
being properly the parilh fchool) 5 and the remaining 4 1. 6s 8d. 
to the one at Aucheneairn. Nothing is more evident, con- 
sidering the advanced price of every article, both of food and 
Aument, than that the above film is inadequate for the pur- 
pofes of a decent and comfortable fubfirtence ; particularly 
when it is refleaed on, that the population is fuch, that, when 
the children are divided between two fchools, neither of them 
can be numerous ; and more efpecially, when it is con- 
fidered, that the quarter's wages are fo low, that an opulent 
farmer can have his child waited upon, and taught Englifh, 6 
hours every day, for the fum of 4 d. a month. This is fo glaring 
an inconfiftency, that, to the honour of fome of our proprietors, 
to whom it has been fliewn, they have declared their readi- 
nefs to enter into an agreement, with the reft of the heritors, 
to fupply the defeft, by an annual voluntary contribution. At 
the period when the law was enaaed with refpea to fchool- 
mafters, the provifion then made for them, bore a fuitable 
proportion to the other ranks and ftations of the community ; 
but now, in the prefent altered ftate of things, it is indifput- 
ably a radical defea in the police of the country. It is there- 
fore molt devoutly to be wifhed, that all perfons of influence,' 
who have a regard to the rifing generation, and feel in their 
minds a veneration for piety and morals, would unite their - 

endeavours

endeavours in remedying this evil, byjgiving a reafonable en. 
couragement, to fo ufeful and neceflary a body of men. 

Proprietors and Rent — There are 2 2 heritors in the parifli. 
The rental, as thited in the valuation roll of the county, is 
5,9601. Scotch ; and the prefent rental is nearly 5,0001. Ster- 
ling, which will be greatly increafed when a few leafes are 
expired ; there being lands in it which, about 15 years ago, 
were rented at Sol., and which now let for 260I. Sterling. 
Indeed it is not eafy to fay, to what fum the rental of the pa- 
yifh might be raifed, if the proprietors would affift their te- 
nants in fencing their farms fufficiently, throwing them into 
fmall convenient fubdivifions, laying them out in good heart, 
and in building comfortable and commodious houfes *. 

Former and prefent State compared., — The people here, till 
of late, lived what may be confidered a kind of pajloral life ; 
with that attention to agriculture only which was abfolutely 
neceflary to mere fubliftence. But now they have taken a 
different turn, and afiumed the appearance of activity, tafte, 
opulence, and gaiety. All our heritors, except 4, either refide 
conftantly, or occafionally. Several of thefe are among the 
principal heritors ; and, coniidering the public fpirit and tafte 
for improvements, which gentlemen of their ftation now al- 
moft every where cultivate, and the diftinguifliing figure

cattle ; now, if the dung of thefe were carefully collected, might it not con- 
tribute greatly to increafe our quantity of wheat, and enlarge our fields of green 
crops ?

which men of their rank now make, it muft neceffarilj pro- 
duce a material difference in the face of things, in comparifoa 
of former days. 



ManafaBures and Villages — What now gives a profpeft of 
comfort, affluence, and importance to the lower clafs, is a {pi- 
rit of cotton manufacture got in amongft us ; which we hope 
will in time lead to the woollen. Here we have two fmall 
villages ; one at the old Abbey, and another at the head of 
He/ton Bay. At the former, a few fpirited \oung men com- 
menced bufinefs lafl fummer. At the latter, a company of 
farmers, headed by a patriotic gentleman, are making pre- 
parations for beginning the next ; having fubfcribed a capital 
of i,30ol. for that purpofe. The machinery of the lafl men- 
tioned place is to go with water. And it is now alfo in con- 
templation, to ere£t a fimilar houfe in the lands of Mr. Cairns 
of Dundranen. Clofe by each of thexe villages runs a burn, 
with water fufficient to drive pretty heavy machinery ; and, 
as their fountain heads are feveral hundred feet higher than 
where they empty themfelves into the fea, works of that kind 
might be ere&amp;ed alongfl them, in fucceffion, for miles. Be» 
fides thefe, we have other three not greatly inferior. 

DiJ advantage. — But with all thefe natural advantages, be« 
fides the exportation of fuch a furplus of grain, and our 
commodious fituation with refpect to harbours, there is one, 
and only one, infuperable barrier to the carrying on of manu- 
factures here, to any conliderable extent, viz. the want of 
fuel. For notwithftanding our large and numerous moffes, 
fuch are the circumftances (which it would be heedlefs here 
to narrate), that peats, to the generality of the inhabitants, 
are nearly as high, and ten times lefs comfortable, than coals 

imported

imported from England, at the prefent exorbitant rate of 2,8s. 



and 30s. the ton. 



ProfpeB of Relief. — It has, however, been long a prevail*, 
ing opinion, that the lands, now belonging to Mr. Johnson - 
Hannah, contain a complete remedy againfl all thofe evils 
and inconveniencies. Thefe lands lie upon the more ; and fo 
promifing are appearances, that veins, 3 inches thick, of ex- 
cellent coal, are found among the rocks at low water. This 
public fpirited gentleman, for the fatisfa&amp;ion of the public 
and himfelf, has this year begun to give it a fair trial, and 
has already got down 40 fathoms. The lymptoms hitherto, 
are neither highly flattering, nor have they given the leaft 
reafon to defpair. The public anxiety for the event is not to 
be defcribed. The eyes of the whole country hang upon 
him in eager expe&amp;ation ; and " eris mihi magnus Apollo," 
is the fentiment that poffeffes every mind, in cafe he fucceeds. 

Probable Confequences — The advantages accruing from it, to 
the community at large, would be very great, as peats, the 
principal fuel over all this country, feem to decreafe in pro- 
portion to the progrefs of agriculture ; many of the mofles 
and marfhy places being thereby laid dry and fertilized; and the 
brum-wood, and other combuftible materials cleared from the 
fields, for thepurpofe of tillage; the demand being greatly aug- 
mented by the increafe of population ; and, even when peats 
are to be had, their value, of late years, is rendered extremely 
precarious by the wetnefs of the feafons. The benefit coal 
would produce to manufaftures, can only be eftimated by 
thofe who know their importance. How inconceivably va* 
luable might it render the rich iron mine in its vicinity, be- 
longing to Lord M'Cartney ? And how. beneficial might it 
prove in faving men's lives and properties, by rendering it

Manners and Cbara&amp;er.— AM ranks, both in their appear- 
ance and manner of living, make a very different figure frorri 
their immediate forefathers. The fame reafons, that account 
for fimilar changes, that have taken place over all the country, 
will no doubt apply here ; thefe alterations being nowife pe- 
culiar to the inhabitants of this parifh. The people here, in 
general, are peaceable, humane, and hofpitable ; have a lively 
fenfe of decorum and charafter ; and many of them give in- 
dubitable proofs, that their minds are deeply influenced with 
rational piety. As an evidence of their fobriety and tent. 
perance, there are not two men in the whole parifh, who 
are fo far enflaved by a habit of drinking, as not to provide 
for their families, nbtwithftanding the many temptations 
they are expofed to, from the variety and abundance of fo- 
reign fpirits, illegally imported on the coaft ; and (what is 
perhaps the caufe of a Hill more general debauchery), the 
cheapnefs of whifky. In refpecl, both of . civil and ecclefiafti- 
cal matters, the inhabitants may juftly be faid to be a people 
■who "meddle not with them thatare given to change." The farm- 
ers here, as well as through the country at large, are a fet of 
civilized, converfible, and well informed men, far fuperior to 
thofe in the fame ftation in many other places of the kingdom'. 
Their line of bufinefs, being chiefly in the cattle branch, by 
which they are often led out into the World, and frequently 
into the company of gentlemen, who, here, are all either fpe- 
culative or practical dealers in cattle, gives an illumination to 
their minds, and a polifh to their manners, which thofe, in a 
mere grain country, are abfolute ltrangers to.

Antiquities. — With regard to Druidical temples, and Saxon, 
Roman or L)anilh camps, fo much has already been faid, in 
the courfe of the Statiftical Account, that any farther def- 
eriptions, conjectures, and bold afTertions, mufl appear trite 
to moft readers. Of the former there are 2, and of the latter

9 lt mav here, however, be obferved, that according to an extraft from tie 
Cbromdeof Melrofs, and other authentic documents, it was founded by Fergus, 
the firft Lord of Galloway, in the year 114a. The firft pofleflbrs came from 
Reivell jn yorkihire, and were of the Ciftercian order ; fo called from Robert, 
Abbot of tittaux, or Cljliaux, or Cficrtium, in Burgundy; who, about the year 
1088, made a fecond refinement on the principles of the Benedicftines, the firft 
having been made about the year 913. That the monks of this defcription were 
very numerous, we have this ftrong evidence, that they had no lefs than 14 con- 
vents in Scotland, four of which were in Galloway. 

The firft abbot of this monastery was one Svlvanuj, who died in the year 
3189. In the year 1430, we find one Henry granting a charter to Henry 
Cutlar of Orroland; which was confirmed by Pope Paul III. in 1437. We 
find another of the name of Thomas, an honour not only to his country, but to 
the age in which he lived. Whether it was he who wrote the Chronicle of 
Melrofs, is not aifcrtcd ; but it is allowed on all hands that it was written by an 
abbot of Dundranen, at leaft the latter part of it. The laft abbot of the place 
was Edward Maxwell, fon to John Lord Harries, who here afforded an 
afylum to Mart Queen of Scots, in her flight from the battle of Langfide, in 
the year 1568; and after whofe death, King James VI. annexed this place to- 
his Royal Chapel at Stirling. The revenue of the abbey about this time, as to 
the money part of it, was jool. Scotch; but, according to the mode of endowing 
religious houfes in thofe days, this muft have been the fmalleft part of it.

* Here it may not be altogether improper to glance at a fmall controversy 
fubfifting betwixt certain refpeclable antiquaries. I t has been commonly af- 
ferted that Sir Chmstopher Seaton, the faithful companion of Wallace, 
was killed, or taken prifoner, at a place called Loch Ore, in Fife. The exigence 
of a chapel at Dumfries, erecled fbf- the very purpofe of faying maffes for his 
feul, led fome people alfo to think, that though Sir Chriftopher was apprehend- 
ed in Fife, yet he was put to death at Dumfries. Now the faft is, that at Loch 
Whur, or Loch Orr, in the ftewfirtry of Galloway, and around the loch, the 
Seaton family had a caftle and a very large'domain. At this day the land-hold- 
ers, in that neighbourhood, have moft of the old inveftitmes of their eftates 
from the Seatons. Sir John Seaton of Barnes feems to hare fold the re- 
mains of the family property in Galloway, fo late as the year 1596. That the 
gallant Sir Chriftopher Seaton loft his life upon the eye of Bruce's coming to

iolwzy £rith\ is a courfe of more than ao miles. The wai 
ter of Urr fldrts the parifli of that name, fo as to divide it from 
thofe of Croffmichael and Buittle ; but the fource of the river 
is about 1 5 miles farther up in the country, than the fpot 
where it becomes the limit of this parifli, as already mention- 
ed. Veffels of 60 tons find the Urr navigable up to Dal- 
beaty, at fpring tides. At fmall expence, and with no confr. 
derable efforts of ingenuity, this navigation might be improv- 
ed, both by bringing it farther inland, and by rendering it 
more commodious for imports and exports : But in this re- 
fpect, as well as fome others, patriotifm and difinterefted- 
nefs make but a tardy progrefs — Befides pikes, trouts, and 
fome other forts of frefh water fifh, this river affords falmon. 
In wet fummers, the latter are had in confiderable quantities ; 
but in dry feafons, fea fifli can get but little higher than the 
flow of the tide. The price of falmon here depends much up- 
on the quantity taken, as little is fent out of the parilh. Two 
. pence per pound was the average this year ; and at no time 
are filh fold higher with us, than the market rates of Dum- 
fries, or of Kirkcudbright, from which towns, Haugh of Urx 
is equally diftaat. 

Soil and Cultivation. — The foil of TJrr is in general light, 
but, at an average, very kindly. The upper parts of the pa- 
rifli are moorifh ; but, in general, capable of tillage ; and it 
is believed, the arable land in Urr may be, to that which can- 
hot be plowed, as 1 2 to 1 . — Agriculture is by no means come 

to 

Scotland, is univerfally admitted. Now the probability of Seaton's being jn 
Fife, when the partifans of Bruce expected that prince at Dumfries ; the pro- 
bability that any man, fo obnoxious to Edward I. as Sir Chriftopher Seaton, 
fhould attempt to conceal himfelf in Fife, rather than in Galloway, (which at 
that time was one of the wildefl diftricts ki Scotland), aje matters that may be 
very fafcly left to common fsnj'e. to determine,

to perfection, but hath greatly improved within thefe ] a ft 30 
years, and . rents have at leaft rifen in proportion. When it 
is told the public, that there are few farms, within 3 miles 
of Urr church, that have not been let, within thefe 40 years, 
for one tenth part of the rent they now yield, the affertion 
may feem improbable; the fad, however, is inconteflible ; 
3nd very adequate caufes may be affigned. By the perfecul 
tion, through which the weft of Scotland, in general, and 
Palloway in particular, fufFered fo much, during the reign of 
Charles II. the minds of the people feem not only to have 
been alienated from the labours of agriculture, but from every 
fpecies of bufinefs, (landing diflina from religion and politics. 
Even the revolution, in 1688, did not feem to affoid abfolute 
iecurity againft the return of their former fufferings. As this 
profped filled the old with defpair, it fired the young with 
refentment ; and hence many of them inlifted in the armies 
of Britain and Holland, during the wars of King William and 
Queen Anne, to oppol'e the return of a family whofe principles,, 
they dreaded. Slowly, indeed, does a nation recover of the 
wounds made by civil difcord. It is not yet quite ico years, 
fince farms in this neighbourhood, that now pay a rent of 
above 200I. per annum, were offered at the church doors, to 
any tenant, who would -pay the land-tax, ministers ftipend, 
and other public burdens. Let us be cautious howfuch times 
are brought back. With a government that exempts us from 
luch calamities, we mould not wantonly quarrel *.

to have improved but very little ; and the value of land to

of tranquillity the country enjoyed. In the year 1740, how- 
fever, fhell marl was difcovered in Galloway ; and the abund- 
ant crops, produced by the ufe of this manure, encouraged 
the landholders, to let out for tillage large tracts of land, 
which had been enclofed for the purpofe of grazing black cat- 
tie. A fpirit of induury began then to be diffufed amongft 
the tenantry and labourers, which was, however, confiderably 
cramped by the vicinity of the Ifle of Man, with which the 
inhabitants of Galloway carried on a confiderable fmuggling 
trade. But that aland having been made fubjecl, about the 
year 1760, to the revemie regulations pf Great Britain, it is 
inconceivable how much the agriculture of every parilh, in 
the maritime parts of Galloway, was benefited : The impor- 
tation of lime from England, by water carriage, foon became 
frequent; (this manure is now carried 15 miles up into the 
country from Dalbeaty Port) ; a corn trade fprung up with 
Greenock, and other towns on the weft coaft of Scotland, as 
well as with Whitehaven, Liverpool, and other ports molt 
adjacent in England ; and the profperity and opulence of this 
parifh, as well as the vicinity, have ever fince continued to' 
improve. 

Produce and Black Cattle Oats, barley,' a little Wheat, and 

black cattle, form the far greater part of the produce of Urr. 
In the year 1782, it was computed, that the oats and barley,' 
fold out of the parilh, amounted to the value of 4,oool. Po~ 
tatoes alfo form a confiderable article of commerce, efpecially 
with the Englifh ports. As to the number of black cattle 
dilpofed of yearly, it is impoffible this can be fbied, with any 
precifion, as many farmers keep what are called running 
flocks, i.e. buy in and fell out feveral times in the year. Pro- 
bably, however, if every farmer was to breed his own fale 
cattle, the parifh might produce 800 bullocks, of two and a 
half years old, which might annually be fent to England, or

otherwife difpofed of. The very beft Galloway bullock, *e 
30 months old, will weigh from 30 to 35 (tones, and will fell 
at 7I. 7s., or at 81. 

Sheep — The fheep kept in Urr are not numerous. By the 
beft information, there are, juft now, about 900 in the parifh. 
Thofe kept in the moor farms are of the black faced kind. 
Their wool confequently is coarfe. On the farms that have 
been well cultivated, the Oieep are generally of the Englifh 
breed, and the wool is fine and more abundant. 

Here it may be proper to obferve, that, in the reign of 
James VI., Galloway was underflood to produce the fineft. 
wool in Scotland, perhaps in Britain. William Lithgow fays, 
he had feen finer wool in Galloway than ever he faw in Spain. 
Even to this day, in fome particular farrhs, the wool is re- 
markably fine, and of a brilliant whitenefs. The fheep from 
which this wool is cut, are white faced, rather fmall, and in 
all refpecls feem very much to referable the Iheep of the Shet- 
land Ifles. Finding that the white faced fheep, with fine 
wool, had once been the common flock of every farm in Gal- 
loway, it became a queftion, Whence the black faced Jheep, 
whofe wool is fcarce worth cutting, were imported? But no 
inveftigatioh or inquiry upon this fubject,, was attended with 
any fatisfa&amp;ion. It may be obferved, that Galloway, in its 
uncultivated flate, abounded with goats, which, in mooriflx 
and mofTV trails, are almoft uniformly of a black colour. 
Now, that the goat and the fheep cafily, nay commonly, breed 
together, is undeniable ; and that the mules fo produced are 
as fruitful as either the feparate breed of goats, or of iheep, 
is a fad that cannot be difputed. In every farm, in the 
wilder parts of Galloway, at this day, where flocks of goats 
and fheep are kept, at no great dillance from one another, 
every fpring we fee, among the Iheep efpecially, feveral mong- 
rels, 



of Urr, 67 

rels, which are juft carried on with the flock of lambs to which 
they belong. Now the goat, in the wild and uncultivated 
parts of the country, is an animal of much larger bone, and 
far hardier than the flieep. About the time, therefore, that 
James VI. left Scotland, and when the manufactures, com- 
merce and agriculture of that kingdom began to decline, it is 
highly probable, that the black faced breed of flieep, (that is, 
the m«ngrels above mentioned), might be encouraged, fo as to 
flock the greater part of the farms calculated for flieep. 
Woollen manufactures having fcarcely any exiftence in Scot- 
land, and the Englifli being hardly able to work their own 
wool, the only objects that could intereft a Scotch farmer, as to 
lheep, were the eafe with which they could be preferved, the 
flavour of their flefli, and the weight of their carcafes. In 
all thefe rcfpects, the mongrels, bred betwixt the flieep and 
the goat, are fuperior, efpecially to the fmall white faced 
fheep already mentioned, the wool of which was of fuch un- 
common finenefs. The mongrels are conltantly black faced, 
and in their form difier little from the fheep thus diflinguiftied. 
Two or three removes might indeed produce all the distinction 
that obtains. This mongrel breed, (half fheep and half goat), 
however much they might fuit ancient times of barbarifm, 
ought no longer to be preferved, at a period, when the proper 
management of Iheep, and the great profits of fheep farming, 
when lkilfully conducted, are fo much better underftood. 

Reptiles, Birds and\Plants — The animals and plants found 
in this parifli, have in them little of Angularity. The fmall 
and deadly coluber, faid to be found in Galloway, has very 
probably exigence, though this reptile may be rare. This 
probability is admitted, not only from numerous traditions, 
but becaufe the writer of this account has once or twice 
met with a copper-coloured "worm, or little ferpent, differing

greatly from both the viper and the common blind worm. The 
heads of thefe fingular reptiles were fo much bruifed, in the 
killing of them, that it was impoffible to diffed them* Seve- 
ral fpecies of birds, not formerly known in this country, fee i 
lately to have taken up their abode in it. Amongft thefe 

are the bullfinch, and gold-crefted wren But though many 

exotic plants grow very well, upon being introduced here, it 
has not been learned, that the wind, the tide, or any fortui- 
tous caufe, has increafed of late the lift of indigenous vege- 
tables.] 

Minerals. — The natural productions of Urr pari Hi need 
hardly to be mentioned, differing little from thofe which are 
found generally throughout the flewartry of Galloway. 
Shell marl there is in abundance ; but that which could be 
dug at the cheapeft rate being exhaufted, the eafe of procur- 
ing lime from England renders the marl, which lies deep, of 
little value, Lime-ftone too there is, but of fo hard a na- 
ture, that it is not meddled with, the rather as coal cannot 
be had to burn it. For the fame reafon, the abundance of 
iron ore remains an ufelefs gift of nature. The growth of 
wood, more efpecially of the Scotch fir, the oak, am, elm, &amp;c, 
(trees with which the face of this country was once covered), 
is exceedingly rapid f : And if the prefent unpopular tax on

of various animals, now extindt even as to fpecies ; the immenfe heads of oxen,

great deal might be wrote, with not much gratification to curiofity. Suffice it 
to fay, that almoft every marl pit, or peat mofs, in the parifh, has at times 
produced bones, heads, &amp;c. fuch as the above mentioned. 

f One inftance may be given of this, inftead of many. In the year 1766, Mr. 
Copland of Coliicfton planted about 60 acres, of very wafte land, near the 
Tillage of Dalbeaty. For thefe 4 yea™ now raft, Scotch firs, to the value of

Jnt i q uities.-ln this pari(h there are few of any importance. 
Several moats and fortified camps are to be met with, bolh » 
U rr a d in the adjoining part of Buittle. Thefe moats ap- 
^ however, to be Daniih or Brit^ works rather h.n 
Roman. Tradition itfelf hath long been filent as to their 
origin. Earthen urns, filled with calcined bones, are fre- 
quently found in this neighbourhood. But the burning dead 
bodies was a cuftom common to the Romans with the north- 
ern nations. The Moat of Urr is perhaps the largeft work 
of the kind in Scotland. It ftands on the weft bank of the 
river, about half a mile below Urr church. A furvey and 
drawing of this moat would have been here given, had this 
confided with the plan of the work for which this article is 
-written. Though the ditches, and the conftruaion of Urr Moat 
in general, are by no means Roman, yet, about 30 years ago, 
fome outworks remained, feemingly erefted by that people. 
Thefe outworks adjoining to Urr Moat, and having fome re- 
ference to the Roman mode of fortifying, were placed up- 
on a rifmg ground, where the moat itfelf, (fteep in other parts), 
is connected with the furrounding plain, upon a levis afcenfus,

Though the prefent minifter of Urr could never difcover 
any roll, drawn up by his immediate predeceffor, diftinctly 
fpecifying the number of inhabitants in the parifli, yet he is 
allured by the precentor, who did his duty alfo under the for- 
mer incumbent, that about 25 years ago, the whole number 
of people in Urr, of all denominations, hardly amounted to 
900. This account of matters appears perfectly credible. 
The villages in the parifh have almofl all arifen, within the£e 
laft 12 years ; and the inhabitants of tbefe, and of fundry 
fmall farms, lately cut off from larger poffeffions, being fub- 
tracled from the population of the parifb, as above ftated, 
there is hardly a remainder of 900 *. It may here be afked, 
whence the increafe of population above ftated has arifen, 
efpecially in a diftricT: of country where no manufactures are 

eftablilhed, 

* Owing to the number of Diffenters, as well as to the confiderable extent 
of the parifh, it is impoffible to be particular as to Births and Deaths. In 
a tract of country, 14 miles long by 5 miles broad, or more in fome place?, 
it would be exceedingly inconvenient to bring to church, (efpecially in winter), 
infants of a few days old. Owing to this, the prefent minifter has not baptifed 
ten children in the church during his incumbency (az years). And very few 
marriages have been folemnized in the church during that fpace. Thus it be- 
comes impoffible precifely to fix the annual number of baptii'ms and marriages : 
And to fay the truth, thefe which are folemnized out of the church are but 
carelefsly recorded. As to Burials, no record of them was ever kept.— The 
males are confiderably more numerous than the females. The want of labourers? 
in a wide country, where the proprietors are moftly or all affluent, the influx of 
Irifhmen , driven from home by tythes, &amp;c. and the eafinefs of fubfiftence, render 
the acquifition of male citizens, fuch as they are, daily and abundant.

eftabliftied, or at leaft none that can encourage population to 
any perceptible extent ? In anfwer to this, it may be obferv- 
ed, that the convenience of fuel feems to be one"great caufe, 
why the number of inhabitants rapidly increafes here, whilft 
population continues at a ftand, or rather diminilhes, in the 
parifhes adjacent. In mofl parts of Galloway, and efpecially 
in the flat country, and on the fea coaft, the moffes are either 
entirely worn out, or dug fo deep, that they ftand covered with 
water ; nor are the proprietors very attentive to the draining 
of fuch moffes as are in this fituation. Coals, indeed, might 
be had from England, at the rate of about 4d. per cwt., in 
the courfe of fair trade ; but then a very ill judged tax, on 
coals carried coaflwifs, precludes this advantage, which equal- 
ly points at the improvement of navigation, manufactures and 
agriculture. If we add to the duty on coals carried coaft- 
wife, as actually paid to government, the infolence of cuftom- 
houfe officers, and the vexatious manner in which they reduce 
their inftrudions to practice, it may be averred fafely, that 
the cwt. of coals, that could be had for 4d. at fartheft, ftands 
the confumer above a pilling. Frequent and continued ap- 
plications have been made to government for taking off this 
tax, equally pernicious and impolitic. One anfwer, however, 
has conftantly been made to all complaints on this fubject : 
What tax will you put in place of the duty upon coals carried 
coqflwife ? or, How do you propofe to remunerate government 
for the diminution of revenue thus occafioned ? One can hard- 
ly obviate fuch a childiQi difficulty, without being fomewhat 
ruffled. There is not one fenfible man in Galloway, who will 
or can deny, that if the tax on coals had been fuppreffed 10 
years ago, the king would have had 10,000 fubjeds more in 
the maritime part of this country. Now the taxation on 
thefe, making the eftimate at only 20s. a head, muft have 
yielded government ten times the tax in queftion. How the 
intereft of the cujlom-honfe mi«ht have flood, is another que- 
ftion. 



ftion. Every man (it has been obferved), who can have a 
family, will have one ; but a {ingle difficulty may be as effec- 
tual as a hundred. If to what has been already obferved, 
we add this unqueftionable truth, that nine tenths of the 
difeafes, which afflict the poorer part of the people, are thofe 
of debility, and chiefly arife from cold, it can hardly be won- 
dered at, that the above tax has been productive of confiderable 
difcontent, and much emigration. 

Villages. — About 12 or 13 years ago, the village of Dal- 
heaty was begun, by Alexander Copland of Kings Grange, and 
George Maxwell of Munflies, Efquires, on both fides of a 
rivulet, called Balbeaty Burn. This village affords one of 
the bell fituations, for a cotton or woollen manufacture, that 
could even be wiflied for. The gentlemen already mention- 
ed feued houfes and gardens at a moderate rate ; and to every 
feuer an allotment was made for perpetuity, in the large 
moffes, not far from the village. The rapidity with which 
this village has increafed, and the diflance from which feuers 
have come, plainly demonstrate how much the tax, upon 
coals carried coaftwife, prevents population in this, and doubt- 
lefs in other parts of Scotland. In other places of Urr pa- 
rim, villages are begun, but they advance flowly ; ' for the 
chief refource they have, as to fuel, is the remainder of the 
peats that can be fpared by Meffrs. Maxwell and Copland, 
after accommodating their own feuers. This refource mull 
fail as the village of Dalbeaty enlarges ; and already many 
farmers, as well as feuers, in the parifh, have their peats to 
lead from 3 to j miles diflance. In one word, it is not chi- 
merical to fuppofe, that, in 10 years, want of fuel might 
drive a great proportion of the people in this parifh, to Ame- 
rica, where indeed a great number of families, that emigrated 
from hence, are already fettled.

Employments. — Though agriculture is the chief objeft of 
induftry, yet there are a confiderable number of people, who 
follow mechanical profeffions. There are about 20 weavers 
in the parifli. Other tradefmen too, fuch as mafons, joiners, 
imiths, fhoemakers, &amp;c. hold fully as great a proportion to 
the total population, already ftated, as could well be expe&amp;ed. 
Enliftments in the army are very rare ; not above a or 3 of 
the natives of Urr having difpofed of themfelves in the mili- 
tary line for thefe 20 years. At prefent, few characters much 
tainted with idlenefs or diffipation are to be found here j of 
abfolute profligacy, there is not one known at prefent. 

Pro-uifions and Wages.— The prices of grain, beef, mutton, 
and provifions of all forts, are eftimated in Urr at the rate of 
the Dumfries market.— As the encouragement for labourers, 
in the line of agriculture, is confiderable, manufadures have 
not as yet been much thought of. Though fome parts of the 
parifh are well peopled, others are not. Even to this day, 
there is hardly in it one human creature for ten acres of land. 
Much watte ground, therefore, is yet to be inclofed and 
cultivated. The wages of labourers are high, and they are 
well paid. Day labourers can earn from is. to is. 6d. per 
diem. Men fervants have from 4 l. 4 s. to 4 L in the half 
year and fome 5 1. Women fervants have from *}. 5s. to

Some people (but very few) are difpofed to give lefs wages, 
and to put up with more indifferent fervants, than the above 
rates of hire would procure ; but fuch economy feldom proves 
advantageous. In a word, there are few counties in Scotland, 
where the labouring poor have lefs caufe of complaint, than, 
in the ftewartry of Galloway ; and it muft be owned, that 
they are honeft, happy and contented accordingly. Mechanics 
in general work by the piece; their gains, therefore, in a 
daily fenfe, cannot be precifely afcertained. Tailors, indeed, 
work moftly by the day: Their wages are 8d., with visuals. 

Manufa£fures t \3c. — Only one manufacture has been hither- 
to eftabliflied in Urr. It is that of paper. The neceffary 
machinery and repofitories were erected at Dalbeaty, on the 
the eftate of Alexander Copland, Efq. fome years ago. This 
work has profpered abundantly. Indeed it is conducted by 
the proprietor of the paper mill ; a perfon fo prudent, fo intel- 
ligent, and fober, that it is believed, few concerns would go 
wrong with him. There is alfo a lint mill at Dalbeaty, 
which is well conducted, and has its full lhare of what bu(i- 
nefs the country affords in that branch. This vicinity, how- 
ever, and the weft of Scotland in general, feem by no means 
fo fit for the growth of flax, as the eaftern diftricts are. The 
copious rains that fall in Galloway render it one of the heft 
counties in Britain, for rearing and feeding cattle. Even when 
unexpected and fevere droughts happen, (nor is this feldom 
the cafe), the abundance of excellent fprings make confider- 
able amends for the hardlhip. But as the heavy rains are a 
difadvantage in the rearing of flax, the droughts, in a light and 
dry foil, are the deftruction of this commodity. In this pa- 
rifh, therefore, it is not probable the culture of it will increafe, 
whilft grain pays the farmer at the prefent rate. The abfurd 
cuftom of fixing a rate of wages, at which fervants and other 

K a labourers 



7 6 Statiftical Ace omit 

labourers are obliged to work, is never thought of in this 
neighbourhood. People of better condition think of what 
they can afford to execute, and fervants and labourers are left 
to their own judgment, as to what they will undertake. Thus 
m all things neceffary, labour and reward meet one another 
on equitable terms. 

Health and Longevity — As the occupations, followed by the 
people, are not prejudicial to the health, ficknefs is not fre- 
quent, efpecially of late years ; and fince the houfes of the 
tenantry and labourers were built of better materials, and 
rendered more convenient, warm and cleanly, — more parti- 
cularly, fince thefe dwellings were improved, the burials of 
infants have decreafed in a furprifing proportion. The dif. 
cafes ufually prevalent are thofe arifing from cold, hard la- 
bour, and other debilitating caufes ; and fuch diftempers are 
found to yield readily to ftrengthening medicines. There is 
one furgeon in the parilh, who praclifes through feveral other 
parifhes adjacent. Attornies we have none.- — As not only 
the labours ufually followed, but the air* and c)imate, are 
friendly to health, longevity is not uncommon. Within thefe 
15 years, feveral perfons have died at the age of 100, or above 
it. One Peter Buchanan died in the village of Dalbeaty, 
about io years ago. His age could not be exactly fixed ; but 
this much is certain, that he was above 115 years old. He 
was furprifingly healthy and active to the day of his death, 
and died of about half an hour's ficknefs. There are juft 
now two or three perfons in Urr aged 90, and feveral above 
fourfcore. Even at the age of 70, or above it, it is not un- 
ufual to fee a labourer fubfifting himfelf, and earning the 
ufual day's wages : Nor is there a poor perfon in the parifli,

excepting one or two, who are quite fuperannuatcd. 

Church, School, and Poor.— The minifter's ftipend is 
83I. 6s. 8d., with an allowance of 5I. for communion ele- 
ments :—200 merks Scotch (or ill. is. 2 T 8 ,d. Sterling) are 
allotted for fupporting the pariflx fchool ; but the large extent 
of the parifli has occafioned even this fmall fumto be divided. 

There never was any poor's rate in the pariih. There are 

at prefent 8 or 9 individuals, who receive from the funds 
of the poor, about a guinea a year, upon an average ; and 
what further aid is neceffary is cheerfully afforded in the 
way of private donation. So attentive has this neighbour- 
hood been to matters of this kind, that for thefe 20 years, 
there have not been 3 travelling beggars belonging to Urr ; 
nor did even thefe go beyond the limits of the parim. At 
prefent, there is no poor perfon of the travelling defcriptioa 
amongft us. 

Religion. — Of the 1354 perfons, who compofe the popula- 
tion already Hated, there are about 30 families of Antiburgher 
Seceders, and 28 families of Roman Catholics. The Seceders 
have had a meeting- houfe within the parifh for thefe 45 years 
paft, or more ; during which time, the Rev. Mr. John Milli- 
gan, a gentleman equally venerable as a minifter, and refpeft- 
able as a citizen, has performed the paftoral duty. The 
Catholics attend divine fervice in a neighbouring parifli, where 
they have a place of worfhip*. Their clergy have been

always perfons of piety, erudition, and irreproachable lives. 
Juftice requires it farther to be faid, that the lives and de- 
portment of the hearers do no difcredit to the example 
and inftruftions of the teachers. The whole amount of the 
Diflenters in Urr is 270 perfons. The difference of religi- 
ous opinion has never occafioned much miiunderftanding or 
bitternefs. The eftablifhed minifter has been in ufe to vifit 
(more efpecially in affiled families), without diftindion ; 
and, on fuch occafions, to perform the ufual ads of devotion 
without referve, or fear of giving umbrage. 

Character — With equal truth and fatisfadlion it is afferted, 
in the face of the public,, that the behaviour of the inhabitants 
of the parifh of Urr hath been, for feveral generations paft, 
(and ftill is) fober, inoffenfive and dutiful. By faying this, 
it is not meant to detract from that independence of fpirit, 
that freedom of opinion, and that acuttnefs of judgment, 
■which diftinguifh the inhabitants of every free country, and 
which afford the beft fupport to every refpe£rable government 
upon earth. In a quarter where (till of late) religious con- 
troversies ufed to be agitated with great freedom and warmth, 

it 

fafety, he faved the lives of feveral of thofe perfecuted people, whom the fury 
of the Epifcopal clergy, and the time-fervers of the court would have brought 
to the gallows. To do the inferior people of this country juftice, the family of 
Munfhes, has not, fince the Revolution, been much difturbed in the exercife of 
their religion. Once or twice, it is true, the houfe of Munfhes has been rum- 
maged, for books containing the doctrines of Antjcbrist, and the veftmcnts 
and implements of idolatry. On thefe occafions, however, we cannot learn, 
that the damage of the family was greater than the lofs of a Greek Teftament, 
and of a book called " 'the faithful Farrier ;" both of which were burnt on the 
Corbelly HU1, near Dumfries, the ufual Tophet for fuch captures. The out- 
landifh character, and a picture or two, in the Teftament, left no doubt of its 
popery ; as for the other book, it» ingenious title was mif-read " The faithful 
c Friar" There have been greater miftakes, both in religion and politics.

it i« not to be fuppofed, that the minds of men mould be de- 
prived of that acutenefs, which remits from fuch dnquifitions. 
Ignorance and ftupidity, however, no more appear to be the 
parents of loyalty than they are of devotion. Though it has 
been announced in fome newfpapers, with an air of triumph 
that feditious writings had never appeared in certain traas of 
country, and it has by fome perfons been talked of as a lucky 
circumftance, that the people in feveral parts of the kingdom 
could not read works of a feditious tendency, fomething bet- 
ter (it is hoped), may be faid for the inhabitants of this 
neighbourhood. There is not one (it is believed) of the late 
feditious publications, that has not found its way into Urr. 
Thefe, with fome of the anfwers (particularly a pamphlet 
called the. Patriot), were read, weighed, and decided upon. 
Therefult is, that, according to every probability, there is not 
a man in the parifti, who would not rifk his life for the fup- 
port of the King's authority, and the Britifti conftitution, as 
eftablifhed at the Revolution in 1688. 

« 

Wants of the Parijh.— The natural advantages belonging 
to Urr parifti, and the fobriety and induftry of its inhabitants, 
are its fole refources. Acquired aids it has but few. The 
military road which paftes through Urr, (and that in a line fo 
prepofterous, that mere Folly could hardly have Humbled up- 
on it), is the only benefit for which it Hands indebted to pub- 
lic benevolence. 

It has been obferved with juftice, that where the mere 
labourer is not encouraged, and enlightened by the man o£ 
letters, human induftry, and ingenuity too, will be ftationary. 
We may go farther, and affirm they will be retrograde. Ig- 
norance as naturally propagates ignorance, and far more 
eafily, than knowledge does knowledge. In an extent of.

more fchools than one would be neceffary. The falary of* thrf 
prefent fchoolmaller is aoo merks Scotch, and, from this 
pittance, 3 1. Sterling is abftracled, for the hire of a perfot, 
to keep a fchool in the mooriflx part of the parifh. For fuch 
an encouragement, it is not to be expefted that teachers of very 
xefpedlable qual.fications can be found. It is the cry of many 
affluent people, however, - The mod indifferent fchoolmafter 
" can teach a young perfon to read, and to fubferibe his name 
" This is education fufficient. Why Ihould we make our 
" tenants and cotters better men than their fathers ?» To 
mention no other abfurdity contained in this argument, feve- 
ral gentlemen, holding this language, feem little to be aware, 
how far they expofe their own families to the recollection of 
the world. As to ignorance of hi/lory, it may well be ex- 
cufed, when people do not remember their own grandfathers. 
As to thofe alfo who think that ability defcends by entail, or 
is fecured by feudal title, it could be wifhed their opinions 
were more frequently juftified by their conduct. The jea- 
loufy, which the more powerful and affluent part of fociety 
have fliewn, for fome time paft, with refpecl to the excenfion 
of knowledge, might profitably be contrafted with the con- 
duft of Scotland, for at lead an age after the Reformation. 
If inattention to the wants of the public, in refped of reli- 
gious, moral, and even ufeful inflrucf ion, much longer pre- 
vails ; if contempt and harflinefs towards thofe moft oppreffed, 
and moft deferving citizens, called parilh fchool-mafters, re- 
mains unabated, people, who have moft to lofe, have greateft 
reafon to dread the confequences. Nil veri, nil fanBi, nulla 
deorum metus, nulla religio, may foon be the character of any 
man, or any number of men; but, of this defcription, we

It is true, a great part of religious and moral inflruction, 
is fuppofed to devolve upon the clergy. But how can this 
happen, when a foundation is not laid for their labours ? Fre- 
quently it is obferved, that the clergy of the prefent day are 
nowife fo popular as their predeceflbrs. And this hath been 
made an argument, for the contempt and depreflion, under which 
they have laboured of late years. The fad* however, mould 
be duly weighed. Of late years, the courts of law, and the 
landed intereft, have entirely fuperfeded the clergy, in the ma- 
nagement of parifh fchools. Heritors will not fo much as allow 
a minifter, to vote in the choice of a fchoolmafter. They 
willchoofe him from year to year ; they will pull into frag- 
ments a falary of ten pounds ; and the parifh minifter is nei- 
ther able to difpute fuch proceedings in a law court, nor is it 
believed, that he would be well heard, if difpofed to afk re- 
drefs. The confequence is, that a parifh fchool is now a mo- 
mentary, or at lead a temporary employment, for fome ne- 
ceffitous perfon of ability ; or a perpetual employment for 
fome languid infignificant mortal, hardly deferving the ftielter 
of a charity work-houfe. Let us contrail with this ftate- 
ment, the character of fchoolmafters in Scotland, for a hundred 
years after the Reformation ; let Us remember, too, the cha- 
racter which the inhabitants of Scotland maintained, and the 
figure they made among foreign nations, during that, and 
even fubfequent periods ; let us advert to the laws of the ftate 
and of the church, refpe&amp;ing the proVifion made for fchool- 
mafters, and the qualifications expected in them ; let us re- 
coiled too the periods when thefe laws were framed, and the 
men who framed them. Things are now changed. If a 
clergyman catechifes his parifh on religion, he finds they can- 
not read the Bible : If he fpeaks of morality, they anfwer 
him with a ftare. Learning and literature are out of the que- 
ftion. At this rate, in order to be popular, the parfon finds

it indifpenfible to propagate a dangerous enthufiafm, or to de- 
clare himfelf retainer to a contemptible fuperaition. 

In his moft rational efforts alfo, to do good, the parifh mi- 
nifter finds himfelf under one great, one infuperable difficulty. 
Whilft almoft deprived of the aid, and of the influence of the 
fchoolmafter, the clergyman finds the fame pains, the fame 
care, the fame attendance expe&amp;ed, from every family, from 
every individual in the parifli, that were ufual a century ago. 
Neverthelefs, the population of the parifh is perhaps tripled, 
the flipend is the fame, and the keeping an affiftant is im- 
poffible. All this while, the Diffenters, of every denomina- 
tion, are not idle. They are not only eftablifliing, but multi- 
plying fchools of their own, and clergymen of their own : And, 
if public difcontent and party fpirit are permitted, nay pro- 
voked, to effedtuate' thefe labours, which might be expected 
from the candour, the juftice, the benevolence of a nation, 
liow can it be otherwife, than that matters fhould haften to a 
revolution ? It has often been obferved, that a religious efta- 
blifhment can only be difpenfed with in a republic, if there. 
Thofe in power, however, are no doubt beft judges, how far 
the expence of the church is an objeft, when the prefent form 
of government is kept in view - in which expence, undoubted- 
ly, the eftablifhment of proper fchools ought to be included *.

PARISH OF <name ref="NA">PRESTON-KIRK</name>. 

^County of Haddington — Prejbytery of Dunbar — Synod of 
Lothian and Tweeddale. 

By the Rev. Mr. Daniel M'Queen, Minifter.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation and Extent, 

THE parlfli of Preston -kirk (formerly called Trtjlon- 
haugh), lies nearly in the centre of the fertile county 
of Eaft Lothian, extending about 4 miles from W. to E., 
on the line of the great road to England, by Berwick ; and, at 
its greateft [breadth, about 7 miles from N. to S. The parifh 
church, which is pleafantly fituated on a fmall eminence, clofe 
by the river Tyne, is equally diftant from Haddington and 
Dunbar. 

Surface, Soil, River and Tip.— -The furface of the ground 
is agreeably varied ; and, were it more generally clothed with 
planting, would afford as beautiful views as any part of 
the county. But the richnefs of the foil, and the fuperior 
profits derived from tillage, prevent this from being the 
cafe. The river Tyne, which takes its rife about 10 miles 
abov£ Haddington, winds through the middle of the parifh,

and empties itfelf into the fea, about 3 miles E. of the church, 
on a flat fandy beach. On each fide of the river, the fields] 
*n the weftern diftrift of the parfli, flope gradually towards its 
channel; but at the village of Linton, a little way above the 
church, the ftream, after falling over fome broken rocks, of 
confiderable height, runs chiefly through a flat fertile haugh, 
till it reaches the fea. In this lower part of the river, confi- 
derable quantities of falmon are caught, and excellent trouts 
through the whole run ; but it is thought the numbers of the 
former, would be much increafed, were the rocks that in- 
terrupt the channel at Linton Bridge, blown, fo as to afford a 
paffage for them to get up more freely, and to fpawn. 

Hill. — The only confiderable hijl in the parifti is Traprane 
Law, formerly called Dun-pender (two Gaelic words fignifying 
Steep Hill), an appellation to which, from its appearance, 
efpecially on the fouth fide, it is well entitled. Its height is 
about 700 feet above the level of the fea; and it forms one 
of the moft confpicuous obje&amp;s to mariners, after entering the 
mouth of the Frith of Forth. From the top of it may be 
feen part of 13 counties.

State of Agriculture. — Agriculture is in general profecuted 
in this parifhj with as much diligence and fuccefs, as in any 
part of the ifland*. — Drilled crops of turnips and beans are 
cultivated to a very confiderable extent. The turnips are eat 
off the ground, in the courfe of winter and fpring, by flieep 
bought in for the purpofe. The flieep are confined within a 
certain part of the field, by a moveable fence, which is fliifted 
fucceffivejy, until the whole crop is confumed. This pradice has 
been found fo profitable (particularly laft year), as to clear at 
the rate of 7I. on the fcore of iheep. The ground, thus ma- 
naged, being clean, and in excellent condition, is very com- 
monly fown with wheat in fpring. The general tafte for agri- 
culture

firft example of fallowing ground, in this part of the ifland, now fo generally a- 
dopted. In the beginning of this century, John Walker, tenant in Beanfton, by 
the advice of fome gentlemen from England, fallowed about 6 acres of land ; 
and finding the experiment anfwer his expectation, he was led to extend it, the 
year following, to upwards of 20 acres. His neighbours, obferving the fuccefs of 
the practice, gradually followed him in it, until at length it became univerfalJy

»e„t wh,c : « affords to perfons of all ages, are circumftances 
unfavourable to the eftablifhment, or extenfive progrefs, of any 
branch of manufafture. 

A^ities-^ place of religious worfhip, it would appear, 
has fubfifled ou the f ame f pot where the church now (lands 
as far back as a thoufand years. It is mentioned, in the Saxon 
Annals, under the name of EccUfia SanBi BaldridL the 
tutelar faint of the place: And that record bears, that the 
oaxons, having made an irruption into Eaft Lothian, in the 
eight century, burnt Ecclefiam SanBi Saldndi, et adjacentem 
vicum de Tyningham, a fmall village, about a mile eaflward 
of this place. It is a fad fomewhat curious, that upon 
taking down the old church, 33 years ago, the oak beams 
bore on them, m feveral places, evident marks of fire ; fo that 
n is probable, they had belonged to the ancient fabric, andcon- 
fequently muff have flood there nearly ,ooo years. Some 
places, adjoining to the church, ftill bear the the name of the 
ancient tutelar faint ; as Baldrics Well, and BaldridL WhUi, 
a pool or eddy in the river. The chancel, at the eaft end of 
the old church, Sffl remains, and is the burial place of the 
family of Smeaton. Under the head of the antiquities of the 
parim, may alfo be mentioned Hailes Cajlle, which bears the 
marks of having been once a large building, and a place of 
llrength. It ftands clofe upon the banks of the Tyne, about 
two miles above Linton, and was in former times the feat of 
the Earl of Both well, fo well known in hiftory, for his dar- 
ing and flagitious enterprife in carrying off the unfortunate 
Mary. It now belongs to Mifs Dalrymple, patronefs of the 
parifhj elded daughter of the lately deceafed Sir David Dal- 
rymple of Hailes— a venerable name— which will convey to 
this, and to fuccetding ages, the rare memorial of talents which

which might have overtaken even the career of genius ; both 
confecrated, by the energy of the pureft principles, to the glory 
of his Maker, and the good of his fellow creatures. 

Civil State. — There are 6 confiderable heritors in this pa- 
rim ; 1 of whom only, (Mr. Buchan Hepburn of Smeaton), 
refides*. This non-refidence of the proprietors, is an un- 
favourable circumftance to the poor's funds, in refpecl to the 
colle&amp;ions at the church ; 20I. annually of affeffinent being 
neceffary to fupply the deficiency. 

Ecclefiajlical State The prefent church was built in the year 

1770. The manfe is old, and in bad repair. The ftipend, ac- 
cording to an augmentation lately granted, confifts of $ chalders 
3 bolls of victual, and 46I. 15s. fd. of money, with a glebe 
of 7 acres. 

Manners of the People. — The uniform, unremitting, but 
healthy labours of agriculture, which occupy the great ma- 
jority of the inhabitants of this pariih, are probably favour- 
able both to their morals and happinefs. They are, in general, 
induftrious and contented with their lot. Poffeffing, as they 
do, the bleffings of liberty, protection, and equal laws, with 
the means of providing, for themfelves and families, the necef- 
faries, and, to a certain degree, even the comforts of life, he 
would not be their friend, who would feek to agitate their 
minds with fpeculative fources of difcontent.

The advocates for political reform, confider themfelves, no 
doubt, to be engaged in a good caufe. But without calling 
their motives in queftion, it may be allowed to thofe, who 
have a deep intereft in the quiet of their country and neigh- 
bourhood, to deprecate the efecls which their zeal in it may 
produce. Such an intereft every clergyman has, both as a 
citizen, and as a paftor. Amidft the keennefs of political af- 
fociations, among men little qualified, either to difcern with 
precifion, or to profecute by proper meafures, the object at 
which they aim, there is danger that the voice of religion may 
be difregarded, that the refped to exifting laws may decay, 
that the amity of neighbours may be interrupted, and that 
the quiet docile character of the people may be ill exchanged, 
for a fpirit of difcontent, jealoufy, and . pertinacious wrang-

(County of Kincardine — Prejhytery of Fordoun — Synod of 
Angus and Mearnsi) 



By the Rev. Mr. William Walker.</head> 



<p>Origin of the Names. 

ECCLESGREIG is evidently a name of Latin origin, 
and an abbreviation of Ecclefia Gregorii, the church 
of Gregory. It perhaps obtained this name from St. Gregory 
the Great, bifhop of Rome, or from fome later pope of that 
name, to whom it might have been dedicated ; or more pro- 
bably from St. Gregory, one of the firft miffionaries from 
Rome to this country. There is little probability that the 
other name, St. Cyrus, was derived from Cyrus, the Mono- 
thelite, bifhop, firft of Phafis, and afterwards of Alexandria, 
unlefs the new converts here favoured his doctrine. It is 
more probable that there was a St. Cyrus refident here, either 
a miffionary, or a native ; becaufe there is a fpring of falubri- 
ous water in the parifh, called St. Cyrus's Well, and a fmali 
portion of adjacent ground, called St. Cyrus's Ward. From 
nun it derives its modern and familiar name ; but in formal

writings, in civil and ecclefiaftical records, Ecciefgreig is [he 
name generally ufed. 

Situation and Extent. —The parifh of Ecclefgreigor St.Cyruz 
is fituated in the fouthern extremity of the county of Kincardine. 
It lies in 56° 45' N. lat., and 2 9 10' W. long, from London. 
The high road, from Montrofe to Aberdeen, runs through 
the parifli, from the 3d to a little beyond the 8th mile 
ftone from Montrofe. It is 5 miles long from E. to W., and 3 
miles broad from N. to S. ; and, being nearly of a reftangular 
form, its whole furface may be reckoned to contain 15 fguare 
miles. 

Surface, %£c The furface of this parifh cannot be faid to be 

uneven upon the whole, although it admits of fome gentle 
declivities, and gradual rifings, is interfe&amp;ed by a few dens 
and rivulets, and rifes into feveral eminences and little hills. 
It is curious to remark with what interrupted elevation the 
land rifes, from the bay of St. Cyrus to the Grampian Hills. 
It riles high, bold, and rocky, with a fudden elevation above 
the coaft. It then fubfides a little, or continues nearly on the 
level for a quarter of a mile towards the north. It afterwards 
rifes gradually, into feveral little hills or eminences, a mile far- 
ther north. It lowers again on the northern confines of the 
parifh ; and rifes flill higher in the more extended chain of 
the hills of Garvock. It finks almoft as low as the level of 
the fea in the how, or hollow lands of the Mearns ; and rifes 
in fublime heighth, and extended grandeur, in the Grampian 
Mountains. More than three fourths of the whole furface 
are arable. The hills of Bridgeton and Woodfton are plant- 
ed. The eminences of Bidderee and Craigie are already ar- 
able j and the hill of Morphy is moftly capable of being made

N. W. boundaries of the parifli, being lefs expofed to the fea 
than other uncultivated places, might be planted, with profit 
to the proprietor and advantage to the public. For wood is 
a fcarce article on this coaft, and does not thrive when much 
expofed to the fea breezes. The general inclination of the 
o-round is towards the S. and S. E. Some farms indeed are 
expofed to the S. W. fun, and decline to the river North Elk. 
The whole lies well under the benign influence of the fun ; 
jet the crops come not foon to maturity. The time of reap- 
ing feldom begins before the middle of September; and harveft- 
work is often not finilhed by the end of October. This may 
be accounted for, from the wetnefs and ftiffuefs of the foil, 
and the coldnefs of the climate. 

Soil. — The foil of the parifli, in general, is deep clay. In 
fome places, the clay is mixed with a little fand ; and in 
others, through long cultivation, and frequent application of 
manures, a black loamy earth, from 15 .to 18 inches deep, is 
fuperinduced above the ftiff clay. The foil foon becomes wet 
after rain, and unfit for tillage ; but it alfo foon becomes dry 
again, and fit for any improvement. Its wetnefs is not lb 
much owing to natural fprings of water, as to the rain water; 
which being prevented from finking to any confiderable depth, 
by the refiftance of ftrong ftjfF clay, floats at or near the fur- 
face, till it is exhaled by the fun, or dried up by the wind. 
This accounts at once for the oppofite impreffions fo foon made 
upon it by rain, or fair weather. The general depth of the 
rain water, which annually falls on this part of the coaft, has 
been computed to be from 24 to 28 inches. This computa- 
tion is thought to be nearly accurate ; but the rain that fell 
laft year, (1792) far exceeds it. Such an immenfe quantity of 
rain, in one year, is not in the remembrance of the oldcft mau 
'in the parilh.

Climate— The climate is fharp and cold for the greateft part 
of the year. But this may be accounted for, from its fudden 
elevation above the fca, its expofure to the eaflern blaft, its 
general want of planting, and its vicinity to the cold, fn'ow- 
covered hills of the north. It is however a healthy climate, 
as appears from the common longevity and healthinefs of the 
inhabitants, and from their general exemption from agues, 
and other chronic difeafes. The fharpeft winds are from the 
E., the coldeft from the N. E. and N., and the warmeft 
breezes, as well as the fineft weather, from the W. The 
fouth wind is, for the mod part, either accompanied with or 
followed by rain. 

River and Bridge — The North Elk, which feparates this, 
parifh from Montrofe and Logie, is fometimes confiderably 
i welled by rain and melting fnow. The common paffage 
through it to Montrofe, about ao years ago, was by a ferry 
boat and a dangerous ford, till a bridge was built over it, by 
fubfeription, for 6 jool. Of that fum his Majefty was pleafed 
to give 700I., to encourage an undertaking fo ufeful. 

Salmon Fijhing.^-ln the fpace of about 1 miles from the 
,3-nouth of this river, the proprietors of the falmon fifliing,

Between 40 and 50 men, including overfeers, bring in all this 
profit to the proprietors, befides what they make for their 
employers, and their own wages and maintenance. This too 

happens 

* Kinnabar, being in the parilh of Montrofe, is not included in this efti-

200I. a year. The author of this article is not fo well acquainted with the 
ftate and profits of the falmon fifhing farther tip the river; but fuppofes it will 
not exceed 50I. yearly, as far as the parifh extends, in conjun&amp;ion with that of

happens between the terms of Candlemas and Michaelmas, 
which are fixed for the commencement and ending of our 
falmon filing. Seldom are the fame number of hands fo 
profitably employed ! Perhaps it might be mere for the be- 
nefit of the fiftiing, both to begin and leave it off a month 
fooner. Continuing to fifh to the end of September, come, 
too near the (pawning feafou ; and if fo, muft ftrike at the 
fource of the increafc of the nth ; but to begm fooner than 
February, when the weather would permit, could do no in- 
jury. Fourteen boats are employed in the falmon fiftiing 
during the fummer months, but feldom half that num- 
ber are needed in the fpring and autumn. The flippers, 
or men who have the charge of the boats, and give di- 
reaions when to draw the net, have for their wages, dur- 
ing the fiftiing feafon, 61., with 4 bolls of oatmeal, and 7s. for 
Jap-money, or drink to their meals. When they have only 
5]., with the fame allowance for viduals, they receive the 
douceur of one halfpenny for each falmon they take. This 
gives them an intereft in the fuccefs of the fifhing, which 
makes them exert themfelves, and muft be an advantage to 
their employers. They are alfo with propriety called fight- 
men ; becaufe, from habit and attention, theyVcome wonder- 
fully quick-fighted in difcerning the motion and approach of 
one or more falmon, under the water, even when ruffled by 
the wind, and deepened by the flowing tide. The ropemcn, 
their afliftants, who draw the net, have 3s. pd. per week, 
with two pecks of meal for wages and maintenance. Of late, 
very few of the falmon caught in this river have been fold 
for exportation. Indeed there has been no occafion ; for the 
fifh being preferved frefh in ice, or boiled in a proper prepara- 
tion of vinegar and fait, and fent, by fea to London, meet with 
a ready market.

their grandeur, from the fummit of the hill, on either fide. 
But you cannot judge, from the appearance of the adjacent 
grounds, which are highly cultivated, and rife not above the 
level of the furrounding fields, that there are any fuch objects 
as dens, till you come clofe upon them ; and die illufion 
heightens greatly the pleafure of the fpedator. Dens fink 
fuddenly from the common level of the country, and feem to 
owe their origin to fome fmall rivulet or flream ; which, iflu- 
ing from fprings on the higher lands, and meeting with foft 
materials in its way, has warned all thefe away, in the courfe 
of ages, till it found the hard bottom, and met with fuch re- 
finance, as occafioned its fudden, and almoft perpendicular 
fall in fome places, which has formed two fine cafcades in 
this parifh, — The dens here are 5 in number : Den Fenel, the 
Den of Lauriejlon, the Burn or Den of Woodfton, the Den of 
Morpby, and Den Side. The 3 firft run in a direction from 
N. to S., and the 2 laft from E. to W. The rivulets which 
have formed the former, run into the German fea j thofe. 
which have formed the latter run into the North Efk. Dea 
Fend is an abbrevation of Venetians Den*. 

Cafcades Over this den, at the diftance of 7 miles from 

Montrofe, there is a bridge of one arch, refling on a rock oa 
each fide, along which goes the great poll road, from Mon- 
trofe to Aberdeen. A little below the bridge, where the den 
grows more narrow, the cliffs are very fteep and rugged, and

inftigated by the lofs of her fan, fhe fled from her caftle of Kincardine, to this

WhlCh Cann0t lail to ^glit the eye of the traveller, and 
fix hun a while on the fpot. About 5 oo yards'below the bridge, 
there is a fine cafcade, which is not perceived till yon come 
clofe upon ,t. This body ot water falls f rom a height of about 
63 feet perpendicular ; and when the rivulet is fwelled into a 
river, or increafed by rain beyond its ufual channel, the be- 
holder is ftruck with aftonifliment at the grandeur of the 
of the fcene. The water, before it precipitates, holds its 
courfe 45 feet below the furface of the adjoining fields. The 
burn of Woodfton, which forms alfo a fmall den near its 
mouth, falls in a broken hypothenufal line, of about 75 feet, 
into the German ocean. Though this fall, deferves a place 
among the natural beauties of the parilh, and is one of the 
fined objeds that meets the eye of the traveller eaft from 
Montrofe, yet that of Den Fenel far furpaffes it in awful 
grandeur, and ftriking fublimity. The rivulets, in fome of 
thefe dens, have contributed as much to profit as to pleafure, 
by fupplying water to fome of the corn mills of the parilh. 
The dens themfelves afford, in general, excellent and well 
flickered paflure. 

Roads, fc/c— Yet, after all the pleafure and the profits 
anfing from ?hefe dens, they have their inconveniences : They 
render the formation of high roads a work of great difficulty 
and expence. So late even as 35 years ago, to travel from 
Montrofe to Bervie, (which is only 13 miles), in a carriage, 
was a dangerous journey. There was a rough, .and often an 
•unfafe ford, to pafs through the North Elk ; then a fteep wa- 
ter-worn path to climb up to the common level of St. Cyrus 
pariffi ; and then 3 dens to pafs, without bridges, by narrow 
and winding paths down their fteep fides, without one foot of 
made road all the way. Now, indeed, thefe inconveniences 



are 



of Ecckfgreig, or St, Cyrus \ gj 

are in a great meafure remedied, by the bridges thrown over 
the North Elk and Den Fenel, the Burn of Woodflon, and the 
Den of Lauriefton ; and it is with pleafure that the author of 
this narrative is informed, that government have lately granted 
iool. to heighten the Bridge of Lauriefton, which is now the 
mod difficult pafs in this parilb. Yet, after all, the gentle- 
men of the county have it in their contemplation, to alter 
the line of road greatly for the better ; and to introduce turn- 
pikes, which are evidently for the public good, as well as for 
that of the county, when the expence of forming and keep- 
ing them up anfwers. 

Minerals. — Upon the farna of Eaft Mathers, there is a very 
valuable lime-Hone quarry. This farm is rented from the 
Vifcount of Arbuthnot, by George Carnegie, Efq. of Pit- 
tarrow, who took it for the purpofe of working the quarry, 
to a greater extent and more advantage, than could have been 
done by a common farmer. Only an inconfiderable quantity, 
moftly for building and plaftering, for which purpofes it is 
preferred to any other in the country, was fold by the former 
tenant. Indeed, he had neither money nor genius to carry 
on the work to any great extent j nor were the benefits of 
ufing lime, as an agricultural manure, fo well known, as to 
occafion a great demand for it. The lime rock begins on the 
more about flood mark, and the poft is now from 12 to 14 
feet deep. When firfl difcovered and worked, it lay very 
near the furface ; but it dips in fo great a declivity, in a S. W. 
direftion, that there is now 25 feet of earth, and brittle 
red rock, above it. And as there is no level to carry off the 
water, it is drawn off by a pump, worked by two horfes, at 
great expence. 

The coals, for burning the lime-Hone, are brought from the 
Frith of Forth, and landed in a fmall creek near the works,

which Mr. Carnegie has enlarged into a tolerable harbour for 
fmall veffels. They are fubjea to the tax on ivater-lom coal, 
fo much felt and complained of over a great part of Scotland, 
but from which, we obferve with pleafure, there is now a 
near profpeft of being relieved ; feeing his Majefty's miniflers 
have recommended it to the confederation of the legiflature, 
and are themfelves the promoters of its repeal. Culm is 
moftlj ufed by Mr. Carnegie for the burning of his lime ; 
but the ftone is fo hard, and the demand at one ieafon of the 
year fo great, that it will not anfwer without a mixture of 
great coal. The increafing expence of removing the fuper- 
ftrata of earth and rock, and of pumping out the water, to- 
gether with the rife on the rates of labour and wages, have 
obliged him to raife the price of the boll of {hells, by degrees, 
from i8d. to 22d. per boll, during a period of 24 years. The 
boll contains 2 barrels, and the barrel 44 pints, Scotch mea- 
fure. It is the fame with the wheat meafure of this country, 
a boll of which is 88 pints. The quantity fold {communibus 
amiis} is 20,oco bolls. It is almoft entirely ufed in agricul- 
ture ; and the demand is greater than can be fupplied. It is 
carried to the diftance of 12 miles, by fteep, rough roads, 
over the Hill of Garvock, into the How of the Mearns, (part 
of the valley of Strathmore) ; and is found to anfwer all the 
expence a confiderable Avay up the fides of the Grampians. 
With the thin fharp foil of thefe barren heath-covered muirs 
it agrees remarkably well ; and it is pleafing to fee fome 
parts of them annually converted into crops of corn and of 
grafs, by the operation of this valuable manure. The carriage 
to the greateft diftance mentioned, is is. per boll. The cart- 
load is from 3i to 4 bolls. 

The flone is of a blue colour, veined with white; and it is 
fuppofed, that, if polifhed, it would be a beautiful grey 
marble. It is very hard, and takes a great quantity of gun- 
powder 



of Ecclefgreigi or St. Cyrus. 99 

powder to force it from its fubterraneous bed. It is of an ex- 
cellent qualitj. The beft proof of this is, that, for mafon 
work, it requires a third part more fand than is ufually given. 
If that fpirituous liquor be allowed to be of the ftrongeft 
quality, which requires the greateft quantity of water to re- 
duce it, by the fame analogy it may be admitted, that the 
lime is of a fuperior quality, which requires the greateft quantity 
of fand to reduce it to proper mortar for building. Every 
boll of this lime requires a cart load of pure fea fand, to pre- 
pare it for the ufe of the mafon. — Upon the fame farm, to the 
weftward, there is another ftratum of lime-ftone, of equal 
quality, and much the fame depth, in a high bank, clofe to 
the fea. It being impoffible to remove the ftrata of rock and 
earth above it, Mr. Carnegie began lately to work it by 
mining, having brought an expert miner from Eaft Lothian 
for the purpofe, who teaches afliftants for himfelf. The ex- 
periment has been attended with fuccefs, and a great quantity 
of lime-ftone has been forced out, by the irreliftible ftrength of 
gunpowder. The mafly pillars, which are left to fupport 
the incumbent hill, and which are open to view, will through 
time produce a linking effect on the eye. This quarry dips, 
in a direction from the fea, more rapidly than the other ; but 
it is not yet incommoded with water. 

At Milton, the lime-ftone quarry, which confifted of bare 
rocks within flood mark, is moftly wrought out. Charles 
Scott, Efq. of Criggie, has lately opened a new one, 
which, it is hoped, will be ufeful to the country, and profitable 
to himfelf. — At Laurieston there is an excellent free-ftone 
quarry, of a brown colour, formed, probably, by the chemi- 
cal procefs of nature, from a mixture of red clay and fand. 
The (lone is eafily cut, and much ufed for building, in Montrofe 
and throughout all the country. The quarrying, and carrying 
thefe ftones, afford employment and bread to many in the parilh ;

which is alfo the cafe with refpeft to the Time quarries.— 
On the eftate of Woodstqn, there is another quarry of free- 
Hone, in every refpeft refembling that of Lauriefton. The 
only advantage, that the latter has, is, that it eafily difcharges 
the rain wafer that falls into it, owing to a ftream that runs 
through the den. — There is another quarry at White Craigs, 
facing the North Elk, from which are turned out ftones, of 
any dimenfions, of a beautiful whitifli colour, limilar to thofe 
ufed in the New Town of Edinburgh ; but being reckoned ; too 
hard for the mafon's chizel, they are ufed only in ruble build- 
ing. There is another quarry of the fcurdy, or whin-ftone 
kind, in the Heughs of St. Cyrus, of a dark blue colour, 
which is alfo ufed in ruble building. 

All thefe quarries are inexhauftible. The two laft men- 
tioned are parts of long chains of rocks, which run through 
the parifh, from W. to E. all the way along the coaft. Near 
the E. end of them begins a fpecies of rock, confining of 
pebbles, baked, as it were, with a hard cement, (which we 
call the plumb-pudding rocf), which continues, with fome 
interruptions, beyond Stonehaven. — The fcurdy rocks, called 
the Heughs of St. Cyrus, may perhaps have been in a ftate 
of vitrification at fome remote period. Upon this fuppofition, 
the word fcurdy may be a corruption of the fcorice, which are 
the effects of volcanic fire. However that may be, the beautiful 
pebbles, and fpars of different forts, which are intermixed 
with thefe rocks, deferve to be mentioned, as they are cer- 
tainly well worth the attention of thofe who delight in 
mineralogy. 

Cave Nigb the fall of the burn of Woodfton, on the W., 

there is a natural cave, formed by the rude jun&amp;ion of ftu- 
penduous rocks, after the manner of a Gothic arch. The en- 
trance to it is on a level with the fca, and the recks and earth 

rife

rife 200 feet above it. The roof is of unequal height, and 
runs out, it is faid, an unexplored length under the rocks 
that form it.

fure in examining the rocks, the botanift might alfo be enter- 
tained with the herbs and plants, which are to be found either 
in the Heughs of St. Cyrus, or on the adjoining more. Pro-

with a high hand. He of courfe became obnoxious to the gentlemen of the coun- 
ty who contained of his conduft ro the king then reigning, who, tf ,s laid, was 
Tames I. of Scotland. Barclay of Mathers, in particular, made frequent and repeat- 
ed complaints ; tired of which, in a moment of unguarded impatience, the King 
laid to him, « Sorrow gif he were fodden ^fupped in brie." As your Majcfty 
pleafes, replied Barclay, who inftantly withdrew from the royal prcfence, and 
coming home in hafte, convened the gentlemen of the county, who were as 
much diflktisfied with the conduit of the fheriff, as he was himfclf.j Having met 
in dofe cabal, they agreed to adhere literally to the King's words, and to make 
the innocent, but unguarded expreffions of royal impatience, a pretext for deftroy- 
iog the fheriff. In order to accompliln their plan, in a manner the leaft likely 
to create fufpicion in the mind of Melville, or put him on his guard, they agreed 
to have a hunting party on the foreft of Garvock, and invited him to Make 
one of their number. In the midft of the hunting ground, a fire was by their 
direction kindled, and a caldron full of water boiled upon it. In the midft of 
their fport, they rufiied with fatal defign to this memorable fpor, feized the un- 
fufpedting fheriff, ftripped him naked, and threw him into the boiling caldron. 
After he was boiled for fome time, or fodden, according to the Kings expreffion, 
they took each a fpoonfulof the fup ; fo after he was fodden, they fupfed him in brie. 
When the King heard of this tragical event, he was highly incenfed againft the 
gentlemen oi the Mcarns, and particularly againft Barclat, Wishart, and 
Arbuthnott, who were the active and leading men in this horrid bufi- 
nefs. To fcrecn himfclf from royal vengeance, Barclay built the Kame of 
Mathers, where in thofe days he mufl have been very fecure. So tradition re- 
ports the ftory, and many firmly believe it. Indeed, compared with the civi- 
lized and gentle manners of our days, thofc of our forefathers, in every part of 
Scotland, were rude and barbarous. From the natural averfion which wc have 
to every fpecies of inhumanity and cruelty, a tragic tale of this fort appears 
fcarcely credible. It is affirmed, however, that there is extant, amongft the 
papers of Arbuthnott, a royal pardon to the Laird of Arbuthnott, for being art 
and part in that murder ; and the ground of this pardnn was " becaufe he is 
«' within the tenth degree of kindred to M'Dufi Thane of Fife '."

walls of an immenfe thicknefs, part of which, with two of 
the towers, are ft ill preferved, and incorporated with a new 
and elegant ftrufture, built on the fcite of the old caftle, by the 
prefent proprietor. The greateft part of the eftate is 'beauti- 
fully fituated, between Den Fenel and the Den of Lauriefton. 
It was for 400 years in the family of Strut on, of which 
there were many who fignalized themfelves by their valour 
in turbulent times*. The laft lineal reprefentative of this fa- 
mily fold the eftate, early in this century, to Falconer of Monk- 
ton, and died without iflue. Joseph Straton, Efq. is de- 
fended from this ancient family, and his anceftors have been 
more than 300 years Lairds of Kirkfide, of which he is the 
prefent proprietor. From the heirs of Mr. Falconer, the 
eftate of Lauriefton was lately purchafed by John Brand, 
Eiq.; who is laying out the grounds near the houfe, in an ex- 
ceeding good tafte. He has thrown a light bridge of one arch 
over the den, which leads to delightful walks, through trees 
and Ihrubs, and is naturally very romantic, though before 
inacceflible. 

Cqflle of Morphy, itc. — On the S. fide of the Den of Mor- 
phy flood another ancient caftle, the feat of the family of 
Graham, in whofe pofleffion the eflate of Morphy has been 
for feveral centuries. It was once a place of confiderable 
flrength, and fecured from the attacks of an enemy by a 

ditch 

the Englifh, who placed a garrifon in it, and ftrenglhened it with fortifications. 
Before that year was expired, the Scotch, under the command of Sir Anmew 
Murray, forced it to furrender. 

* Alexander Straton, who, with feveral of his fons, fell in the unfor- 
tunate battle of Harlaw, in the year 1411, was one of the Lairds of Lauriefton. 
The St ra tons were a race of men remarkable for fize and ftrength, down to 
a very late period. Their attachment to this Laurieston, in St. Cyrus, which 
is the original one, was fo great, that they changed the name of every other 
place in Scotland, where any of them fettled, into Laurieston.

ditch and draw-bridge, according to the genius of thofe days, 
but now few remains of it are to be fecn. A huge /quarts 
fione pillar, of about 12 feet high, is ftill Handing at Stone 0/ 
Morphy, and feems to have given rife to the name*. 

Church About 160 years ago, the church of Ecclefgreig 

flood below the Heughs of St. Cyrus, on the more, nigh the 
mouth of the North EOy. The church-yard there ftill con- 
tinues, and is ufed as a burying ground by the parifh in ge- 
neral f. In the year 1632, this very incommodious fituation 
of the church was changed, and a new one built on an emin- 
ence, a little above the Heughs of St. Cyrus, more conveni- 
ent to the parifh, from its eafy accefs, and centrical fituation. 
By reafon of the increafe of the population, this church be- 
came too fmall to accommodate the parifh : It was alfo ill 
lighted, and narrow, and going fail to decay. The heritors 
faw the neceffity of building a new one ; and, in the year 
1787, they finifhed a church, which, for elegance and accom- 
modation, has met with univerfal approbation. It is adorned 
with a fmall fpire, which is feen at a confiderable diftance. 
The manfe has. been repaired, and the office-houfes rebuilt, 
during the incumbency of the prefent miniller. The King is 
the undoubted patron of Ecclefgreig. The prefent ftipend is

* Whether this ancient pillar was ereiSted, to preferve the memory of fome 
gallant warrior of the name of Graham, or whether it be the' only relick of a 
Druidical temple, it is difficult to determine. But th: firft conjecture feems to 
be the moft natural ; becaufe it is the only ftonc at that place, and goes by the 
name of The Stone of Morphy. 

t Near the church-yard, the fea, in conflux with the varying courfe of the 
river, difcovcred, fome years ago, the walls of a houfe, that had been, from time 
immemorial, entirely buried under the fand. From its dimenfions, internal 
divifions, and fituation, it was undoubtedly the refidence of the minifters in an- 
cient times.

85 bolls of victual, partly meal, and partly bear, and 26I. 13s. 
in money. But an augmentation, with the concurrence of 
the heritors, will foon be obtained. 

School — The fchool-houfe, with abundance of accommo- 
dation for the fchool-mafter, was rebuilt about 10 years ago. 
The prefbytery have, by a committee of their number, now 
twice examined the fchools within their bounds,' and mean to 
continue the practice annually, as they fee the beft effe&amp;s re- 
fulting from it. In general, attention is paid to the education 
of youth, and their morals are not neglected. Indeed, it 
were to be wifhed that more encouragement were given to 
men who have fuch an important truft, as a fpur to their di- 
ligence in office, if it would have that effect. 

Poor. — The funds, for fupporting the poor, arife from the 
interefl: of their mortified money, from the collections made 
for them at the church, and from the fees given for the ufe 
of their mortcloths. They receive nothing from marriages, 
or baptifms, and very little from the fines exacted from thofe, 
who have been guilty of irregularity of conduct. The fol- 
lowing is a flate of the number of the poor, and of the funds 
for fupporting them, from the year 1781, to the year 1791, 
inclufive.

This ftate of the funds, for the fupport of the poor, in* 
eludes 4 colledions, of about 4 1. each, made and given for 
the fupport of the lunatic hofpital at Montrofe. Dedufting 
thefe colleaions, the whole has been diftributed among the 
poor. 

In the year 1783, when provifions were both dear and 
fcarce, owing to the failure of the crop in 1782, the feffion, 
in concurrence with the heritors, broke in upon their funds, 
and bought meal, which they diftributed gratis among the 
poor, together with 29 bolls a firlots if peck of meal which 
they received from government. Had not thefe feafonable 
reliefs been given, it is not eafy to fay what wotxld have been 
the confequence, with refpeft to the poor, even in this opulent 
parifti. Under this denomination, is chiefly meant poor la- 
bourers and houfcholders ; for we have very few mendicant 
poor ; but the number of vagrants and ft rolling beggars is 
prodigious, and has often been complained of as an infuffer- 
able hardfhip. 

State of Agriculture.— Qt all the pariflie3 within the county 
of Kincardine, St. Cyrus has been the firft and the beft meli- 
orated by improvement. To this the lime quarries at Milton 

O z and 



1 ° 8 Statiftical Account 

and Eaft Mathers, have greatly contributed. But thefe might 
have perhaps remained in their original ftate, had not the lata 
Robert Scott, Efq. of Dunninaultj, been induced, from the, 
lime rocks within the flood mark at Milton, to rent the farm 
bearing that name, on the eflate of Lauriefton. As he was 
reprefentative in parliament for the county of Forfar, which 
his fon now reprefents, in going up and coming down from 
London, he was not inattentive to the fyfiem of agriculture 
followed in England. Finding it fuperior to any hither- 
to pra&amp;ifed in Scotland, he tried to follow it, firft upon his 
own eftate, and afterwards upon the farm of Milton. He fet 
the example of draining, ftoning, liming, fallowing, cleaning, 
manuring, and properly drefflng the fields on this farm. The 
confequence was, he raifed great crops of all forts of grain, as 
well as of grafs 1 . The farmers, who at firft held his plans in 
derifion, and were unwilling to leave their own old beaten 
track, began to be furprifed at his great crops; and when ex- 
perience demonftrated to them the fuccefs of his fchemes, 
they gradually turned round to imitate them. Hence arofe 
a fpirit of agriculture, and even of emulation in it, which has 
produced the happieft effects. The well filled barn yards af- 
ter harveft, are ftriking and folid proofs of the fuccefs, with 
which this fpirit for improvement is crowned. The prefent 
high, and ftill rifing rent of land, is another proof of the fame 
fa&amp;. Twenty years ago, ios. or 15s. was thought a high 
rent for an acre of the bell land in the parifh. Now, from 20s. 
to 30s., and even up to 40s. per acre, is given for the fame land, 
in confequence of its melioration ; and no fooner does a leafe 
expire, than the farmers ftrive with one another, who fhall be 
tenant. Another proof of the flourifliing ftate of agricul- 
ture in this parifh, is, the comfortable manner in which the 
farmers can afford to live. Notwithftanding the rife of rent 
now mentioned, and the high price of labour, which fliall

afterwards be noticed, they, in general, enjoy a pleafing and 
agreeable affluence, and have it in their power to bring up and 
educate numerous families, and provide for their future fettle- 
xnent in the world. Such are the happy effefts of rural m- 
duftry! 

Mode of Cultivation.- The common mode of treating land here, 
is, after fummer fallow, to lime and dung it ; and then to foW, 
the firft year, wheat ; the fecond, peas or beans, or a mixture 
of both, called majhlie; the third, barley or Chefter bear, with 
grafs feeds. The grafs is commonly cut the firft year for hay, 
and paftured two years afterwards. It is then broke up, with 
one furrow, for oats ; next year it is fown with barley, or 
Chefter bear, after three earths, or furrows; the third year, it 
is wrought iato-a finer mould for turnips, which are always 
fown in drills, and well manured ; and the fourth year, it is 
fown with barley and grafs feeds. When the foil becomes 
foul, and is over-run with weeds, a new fummer fallow be- 
comes neceffary to clear it ; and then it is treated in the manner 
now defcribed. There are, and no doubt will be, feveral al- 
terations from, and exceptions to this general fyftem. While 
men fpeculate in this, as upon other fubje&amp;s, they will invent 
new plans, and experience alone muft juftify or condemn the 
alteration. Sometimes the ground, after one crop of hay, is 
broke up with the plough, in the beginning of autumn ; and 
wheat is fown with fuccefs. To this fucceed turnips, or 
peafe and beans ; and the third year barley and grafs : It is made 
hay the fummer following ; then paftured for a year or two; 
afterwards plowed for oats, &amp;c 

Sometimes the land thus paftured, is taken for raifing^a*. 
The flax raifers are often different from the farmers, and pay 
them 5I. or 61. an acre, for a fingle crop ot fuch land as fuits 
their purpofe. They pay theexpence of the feed, the fowing, 

4 . tbe 



IJ ° Statiflical Account 

the weeding, the pulling, the watering, the fpreading on and 
taking off the grafs ; in Ihort, of every thing, but dreffing the 
land, which the farmers, from whom they take it, do for them. 
Yet, after all, they make a profit by it ; othervvife, why would 
they continue the fame practice year after year? If the 
farmer, however, were to cultivate the flax himfelf, which is 
fometimes the cafe, he would doubtlefs make more profit by 
it ; but it may be a queftion, whether the high rent he receives 
be not equivalent for it ? The crop of flax is always removed 
in fufficient time, to allow him to fow his land with wheat, 

which is often done to advantage About a third part of 

every farm is refer ved for hay and pafture. 

Black Cattle. — Confidering how much of this parifh is al- 
ways under crop, and how little is referved for pafture, it 
jnuft be obvious, that the number of black cattle cannot be 
great. Yet, if the young are included with the old, the whole 
number will amount to 1150. Of thefe there are 100 oxen, 
all trained to the yoke. They are reared in the parifh ; and, 
after ferving their mailers 4 or 5 years, are carried to market, 
and fold to great advantage. The price they bring is often 
from iol. to 1 5I. The number of milk cows is about 420. 
The reft are young cattle, none of them exceeding 3 years old. 

Horfcs and Sleep. — There are 204 draught, and 10 faddle 
horfes in the parifh. The number of fheep is inconfiderable : 
icoo will comprehend every little flock in the parifh. What 
fheep we have, however, are of a good kind : Thofe, in parti- 
cular, that feed near the fhore, furnifh mutton of an excellent 
quality. 

Ploughgates and Produce.— There are 50 horfe, and 10 

oxen ploughgates in the parifh, allowing 4 horfes and 6 oxen 

to 



of Eccle/greigy or St. Cyrus. I 1 1 

to the plough. From the number of work oxen, it might be 
fuppofed, that there would be more oxen ploughs: But 
many of the farmers keep 12 oxen to one plough, yoking one 
half in the forenoon, and the other half in the afternoon. By 
thefe means, they have time to feed, and the men who manage 
them are kept in conftant work. If we fuppofe every plough- 
gate, to fpare from its produce loo bolls for fale, (and the 
computation is very moderate), it will amount to 6,000 bolls 
yearly, partly wheat, partly barley, partly oat-meal, and 
partly beans and peafe, after paying the rent, fowing the land, 
and every other expence that attends agriculture. 

Proprietors and Rent.— There are 11 heritors in the parifh*, 
and 27 considerable farmers, befides many more of fmaller note. 
The valued rent is 6,2771. 2s. 4d. Scotch ; the real rent, includ- 
ing 85 ol. for falmon fifhing, and 10I. for kelp, is 3778I. Sterling. 
This ftate of the real rent may not be perfeftly accurate, be- 
caufe 3 of the proprietors have the greateft part of their eflates 
in their own hands ; but it is fuppofed to be near the truth. 
If the progrefs of agriculture, for 20 years to come, ihall bear 
any proportion to what it has been for the fame number of 
years paft, it is more than probable, that the real rents of the 
parifti will be as many pounds Sterling, as the valued rents 
are now pounds Scotch.

within thefe 40 years.

Total increafe in 3 7 years, - 49a 

The number of children born in the parifh is, communibus 
annis, about 60. The marriages feldom exceed 12. Indeed, 
fome years, they are mot above half that number. With re- 
gard to funerals, no regular acconut of them has been hither- 
to kept in the parifh. 

Villages The principal village in the parifh is Milton, 

which flands on the fea coaft. In the year 1781, there were 
46 families, containing 170 perfons, in this village. Their 
number is at prefent on the increafe. About 30 years ago, 
three fifaing boats belonged to Milton. Six men went out to 
fea with each boat; who caught haddocks, whitings, cod, ling, 
Ikate, turbot, and common flukes, or flounders, in great abund- 
ance, which they fold at moderate prices. For feveral years 
paft, there has been but one boat employed in the white fifh- 
ing ; nor has that boat been fuccefsful. The reduction of the 
fcfhing boats, and of the number of hands that went to fea 
with them, is withont doubt, a real lofs to the country. It 
leaves no foundation for a nurfery of feamen, and prevents 
the inhabitants from enjoying that abundant fupply of excel- 
lent food, with which the fea is ftored. 

Thefe inconveniences might, however, be in a great mea- 
sure remedied. The fifhermen are fo poor, in general, that 
though fix of them join their little flocks together, they can- 
not 



l 



of Ecckfgreig, or St. Cyrus. 1 1 3 

pot afford to purchafe a new boat, when their old one fails. 
Now, if the proprietors of fifhing villages were to furnifh the 
men with good boats, with all their neceffary tackling, upon 
their-paying a reafonable rent, as intereft for the money, this 
would be a beneficial public fpirited meafure, and would 
greatly encourage the fifhing. Another mode of encouraging 
this ufefulclafs of menmight alfo be adopted. Every oneknows, 
that accidents are continually happening, by which the heads 
of the families employed in fifhing lofe their lives. The 
confequence is of the molt diftrefling nature to their numerous, 
and, very often, young families, who are frequently left in the 
moft deftitute circumftances. Now if the county, or if go- 
vernment, fenfible of the ufefulnefs of this clafs of men, for 
recruiting the navy, would provide fubliftence for them in 
thefe cafes, on this exprefs condition, that all the male children 
fhould be brought up to the fame occupation, and be ready to 
ferve his Majefty in cafe of a war, it would have the effect, 
both to relieve the diftreffed families, and to increafe the 
number of that hardy and ufeful race of men *. Indeed, it 
is well known, that fcarce any but the children of filhermen 
follow the occupation of their fathers, and that they are a 
kind of diftindt tribe, by their manners, and by intermarrying 
only with each other. 

The Village of St. Cyrus ftands befide the church, nigh the 
centre of the parifti. It contains 144 inhabitants, who are 
moflly mechanics, falmon fifhers, or day labourers. Indeed 
no neighbouring parifh exhibits fo cheerful and populous an 
an appearance ; for, from one end to the other, the traveller 
fees, on all hands, numerous, fubftantial, well built cottages 
,of ftone, fome of them hewn ftone, with well proportioned

habitations ; befides a number of gentlemen's feats and farm,* 
houfes, built in a very fuperior {tile. 

Chara6ler.— The people of this parifh are, in general, active 
and induftrious : Thofe employed at the lime quarries, and 
the falmon fisheries, particularly deferve this character. The 
former, working by the yard, obferve the maxim, " The 
more they work, the more they win," (gain). The latter, 
when not fifhing, employ themfelves in their refpe&amp;ive trades, 
cr labour by the day to thofe who employ them *. The fe- 
male part of the parifh is not behind the men in point of in- 
duftry. They are excellent fpiniters, and perform the opera- 
tion with both hands, fpinning two threads at once with the 
greater! facility. Jt is a common and an eafy talk, for one of 
thefe two-handed females, to fpin 3 fpindles in the week ; 
which, at the rate of is, 3d. the fpindle, comes to 3s. 9d. 
The writer of this narrative, is informed, that, excepting in 
harveft, 500 fpindles of co«rfe yarn are fpun weekly in the 
parifh. This quantity of yarn mull bring, at the rate above 
ftated, 31I. in the month; and allowing this to continue 10 
months, the total fum made by fpinning, in the parifh, mufl

* The common hire of the day labourer is 8d. in the (hort, and is. the long 
day, -without maintenance. But, in harveft, the men have is., and the women 
led., befides vicluals. The farm fervants are excellent ploughmen. The Scotch 
plough alone is ufed. Their wages are' lately advanced from 61. to 7I., 81., and 
even iol. for the year's ftrvice. They ufually work % horfes, 4 hours in the 
forenoon, and 4 hours in the afternoon. The married fervants, who live in 
their own houfes, are allowed % pecks of oatmeal in the week, and one half- 
penny a day, for maintenance. They are engaged by their mailers at a public 
market, without any certificate of their charader, and often without any know- 
ledge of their capacity for work. One of thefe markets for hiring fervants is 
held on the Hill of Garvock, and the other at Laurencekirk. The congrefs of 
maftcrs and fervants, at thefe places, is very numerous, and, almoft in cvtry 
point of defcription, refembles the Saturnalia of the ancient Romans. 



of kcclejgreig, or Si. Cyrus. 1 1 J 

tunount to 310I. a year. The yarn is manufactured, at Mon~ 
trofe, into fail-cloth and other purpofes. In the above cal- 
culation, the fine yarn, which is fpun in the parilh, and made 
into linen and diaper for the ufe of families, is not included. 
This induftrious fpirit in both fexes is very commendable f. 

The rtiigmut chdraBer of the inhabitants of this parifli is 
moderate. They neither run into the extreme of fuperfli- 
tion, on the one hand, nor of fariaticifrn on the other. In 
truth, their religion is of the calm mild call ; and they make 
no great noife or buftle about it, though they are very regu- 
lar in attending its inftitutions. The gentlemen of landed 
property, 5 of whom refide in the pariili, are of the Epifcopal 
communion ; yet they very frequently, and almo'ft regularly, 
attend the Eftabliflied Church, fetting at once an example 
both of piety and liberal fentimentj and increafirig the poor's 
funds by their voluntary offerings. There are a few Seceders, 
who join a meeting in the neighbouring parifti of Benholm ; 
but their number is fmall ; and they make little noife or dis- 
turbance, except for reform, which, perhaps, as individuals, 
they ftand very much in need of.

<p>Extent and Soil. 

JL HE parifli of Foulden, in its form, approaches nearer to 
that of a fquare than any other ; and, in breadth, is about z 
miles, and in length i\. The foil, on the S. fide, is a ftrong 
clay ; towards the middle of the parifli it becomes more loamy, 
and on the N. it turns confiderably light. 

Cultivation and Produce The whole lands in this parifli lay 

formerly run-rigg ; which, however unfavourable to improve- 
ment, was indifpenfably neceffary, as a bond of defence in 
thofe days, when the inhabitants of the Borders were in the 
practice of committing depredations upon one another. Al- 
though thefe acts of plunder were relinquilhed, after the revolu- 
tions i688, it wasnot till within thefe 40 years, that a full divi- 
de fion 



of Fouldcn. ttf 

flon of property took place ; but fince the lands were divided, 
they have been in general well inclofed, and brought to a con- 
fiderable degree of cultivation. They yield plentiful crops 
of wheat, barley, oats, peafe, turnips, potatoes, and grafs. 

Rents, Cattle, tfc— Although thefe lands fully bear the 
above defcription of foil and good quality, the bed of them, 
excepting force crofts, were let no higher than ios. per acre; 
but fince the old leales expired, they are now advanced from 
ios., to 20s., 30s., and even 40s., which is not too high, con- 
fidering the fliort diftance from market and lime. Formerly, 
a large trad of land, on the north fide of the parifh, called 
Foulden Muir, was occupied by the refidenters in the village, 
by way of {tents, or pafture for cows and horfes, and, in that 
Hate, paid very little rent. The grafs of thefe grounds being 
always in great plenty, and of good quality, fuggefted the 
advantage of bringing them into a ftate of cultivation. About 
30 years agrj, when improvements in agriculture were intro- 
duced into this part of the country, this piece of land was 
accordingly plowed up, and yeilded a profufe crop, from a 
good foil. It was foon after let out into different farms, which 
now pay about 300I. of yearly rent. Some part of this land 
has been found unfit for hufbandry, and is lately planted with 
firs, which promife a good return in due time. Lime is very 
much ufed in this part of the country. There is (hell marl 
in the parifli, but it has never been properly tried ; and, for a 
number of years paft, it has been entirely neglected. There; 
is nothing remarkable in the mode of hulbandry, nor in the in- 
ftruments employed in it. The breeding or feeding of fheep 
has not been tried here, although great part of the lands are 
very fit for both purpofes. The late proprietor had a fine 
tafte for the breeding and feeding of cattle. His horfes were 
the beft in the country, and it is but 3 years fince the laft

of his breed of oxen were fold. One ox weighed 128 flone, 
and was of a very fine fhape and make. 

Climate, River, \s!c — This parifh, and fome other lands ad- 
joining, ftand upon a confiderable elevation, which continues 
to rife, towards the N., for 2 miles; and then flopes gradually, 
until it reaches the fea banks, which are very high and rocky. 
There is a river, called Whiitadder, which runs on the S. 
fide, and empties itfelf into the Tweed, near Berwick. The 
bed of the river is very deep, being in no place under 40 
yards, and in many places 50 yards, from the top of the bank. 
Thefe banks are cut, upon the N. fide, into very deep dens 
by nature, through which rivulets of water run, from the 
whole lands in the neighbourhood, throughout the year. Thefe 
circumftances, added to an almoft unbounded profpect to the 
S. and W., muft contribute to render the air pure and dry, 
and confequently lefs fufceptible of noxious or infeftious 
taints. It has been frequently remarked here, that the dif- 
eafes, which are peculiar to our climate, fuch as intermittent 
and common continued fevers, putrid fever, and fore throat, 
are fcarce known amongft us, whilft they are fometimes very 
frequent and mortal, in the parifhes immediately adjoining. 
Thefe difeafes have indeed made their appearance here at fuch 
times, but unaccompanied with that malignity, which rendered 
them fo fatal to thofe attacked with them, in lefs elevated 
and more moift fituations. For thefe 7 years and upwards, 
only one young perfon has died, a female of 16 years of age r 
and one child. Good health is enjoyed through life, with 
very little interruption ; and, except thefe two, none have 
died (refiding in this pariih), during the above mentioned 
period, who had not reached at leaft 60 years ; and it is not 
unfrequent to attain the age of 8o, ajid even 90 years, in the 
foil pofieffion of every faculty.

Population.— As the records have not been regularly kept, 
♦he ancient flate of the population cannot be precifely afcer- 
tained. A confiderable village, containing about 60 families, 
being now reduced to 16 only, is fuppofed to have dinfinimed 
the population ; and it is the opinion of old refidenters, that 
the number of fouls is not fo great now, as it was 40 years ago ; 
although, upon comparing the average of baptifms for the 
laft 7 years, with that of the fame number of years half a 
century ago, there appears to be very little difference. Hence 
fome incline to think, that although a number of old people 
have died, and feveral others have left the bounds to refide 
elfe where, the permanent population is ftill nearly the fame ; 
and the reafon they give, is, that feveral new farms have been 
erected, with a number of houfes, containing many families, 
which bear a near proportion to the reduction, which has taken 
place in the village. The former opinion, however, feems 
neareft the truth, the return to Dr. Webfter, in 1755, having

nances of religion in the parifb church ; which was rebuilt in 
Iy86. The manfe was built about 14 years before. The ftipend, 
by a late decreet of augmentation, is 56I. 10s. in money, 
and three chalders and a half of barley and oatmeal, equal 
parts. There is an allowance of 2l. 10s. for the expences of

Antiquities. — There is an old ruin, called Foulden, which 
appears to have been a place of fecurity and ftrength, in the 
times of the Border contefts. There is alfo a property, called 
Nunlands, where there was an eftabliihment of nuns in former 
times ; but no record or tradition has been met with, that give* 
any hiflory of either f . 

Markets and Roads. — There are 2 fairs held annually in the 
village ; but little or no bufinefs is done at them. A very 
few cattle appear fometimes for fale, and a fmall quantity of 
•wool. Formerly, great quantities of fhoes were fold at the 
fairs here, and were bought by the people in Northumber- 
land. — The roads in this neighbourhood have lately under- 
gone a great repair, in confequence of feveral turnpikes hav-* 
ing be-en erected^

* The prefent incumbent fucceeded Mr John Buchanan, whofe predeccf- 
for, Mr Robert Park, was the firft Prtfbyterian minifter of this parifh after 
the Revolution in 1688 ; the Epifcopal clergyman having continued in the 
charge about eleven years after Prefbyterian chnrch-government was eftablilhe 
in Scotland. 

f There was alfo a fortified wall on the eaft end of the village of Foulden, 
the remains of which were taken down fome years ago. The chief defign of

<name ref="NA">KILBRIDE</name>. 

(Count? and Synod bf Argyll— Brefbytery of Lorn.) 
By tie Rev. Mr. Patrick M'Donald, Minifen</head> 



<p>Origin of the Names. 

THE olcleft etymology of Kilmore, is Kil-moire : Oy, at 
Oigh, fignifying, in ancient Gaelic, the church, or place of 
-.vorihip, of the blefled Virgin. It was alfo called Kilmheariachj 
or the middle burial place, from beingin the centre of the coun- 
try. Lately it has been called Kilmor, that is, the great burying 
place, (tho'r fignifying great or large), becaufe the burial 
ground around this church was formerly of greater extent, 
than any other in this part of the country. Kilbride is alfo 
derived from the fame root, Kil, and fignifies a burial place, 
or place of worftiip, dedicated to St. Bridget. The church was 
rebuilt about 50 years ago. It is fuppofed to have been 
joined to the parifh of Kilmore, at the union of many other 
parifhes in the Highlands, under the charge of one minifler. 
Kilbride was a vicarage,' and Kilmore a parfonage.' 

Vol. XI. Q v Situation, 



I2 2 Statijllcal Account 

Situation, Extent, l$c — Thefe united parifhe3 are fituated 
in that diftrift of Argyllfhire called Mid Lorn. Kilmore is 
the feat of the prefbytery. They are 7 miles long, and 6 
broad, and in their form nearly circular. The number of 
acres cannot be afcertained. An ifland is annexed, facing 
Oban, named Kerera, which is 3 mile3 in length. It is the 
property of Mr. M'Dougal of that ilk, excepting one farm, 
which belongs to Lord Breadalbane. 

Surface and Soil. — The country is hilly, but not moun- 
tainous. The hills, though low, are covered with heath, ex- 
cepting a few that are cropped by the fheep, which are in- 
creafing in the parifh. The vallies are generally arable. The 
foil is different in different farms ; but for the moft part fhal- 
low and fpouty. In many places it is molfy, in fome clayifh 
and in others fandy, mixed with gravel. This parifh, like 
moft others in this county, is more calculated to produce grafs 
than corn ; yet it yields as large a proportion of the latter as 
any of the adjacent parifhes ; and from the increafmg know- 
ledge of agriculture in this part of the country, more and 
more of the arable lands are annually brought into cultiva- 
tion. 

Climate and Difeafes, \£!c. — Though the rainy feafon, in this- 
part of the country, continues nearly two thirds of the year, 
yet the health of the inhabitants does not fuffer, fo muchr 
as might be imagined ; but the grain: is much injured by it. 
Weflerly winds prevail to a great degree ; but fevere frofls, 
or great falls of fnow, feldom occur.— This parifh is liable to 
no particular maladies. , Fevers and fluxes are not more 
common than in the lower parts of the kingdom. Colds and 
rheumatifms are a little more prevalent, owing perhaps to the 
humidity of the air. Inftances of longevity fomctimes occur. 

A few 



of Kilmore and Kilbride. 123 

A few are now living in this parifli, aged 90 years and up- 
wards, and a few others died lately about the fame age. 

Cultivation.— The mode of plowing, for 2© years paft, was 
by 4 horfes abreaft; but now, 2 only are ufed, which has been 
found by experience to anfwer better*. The implements of 
hufbandry have of late undergone a very confiderable degree 
of improvement, infomuch, that they. are almoft equal to any 
ufed in the moft improved parts of Scotland, Within thefe 
12 or 14 years, the ufe of carts has become common, both 
among the gentry and the farmers, who are fenfible of the 
great utility of them.— The manures are chiefly produced by 
cattle houfed, or inclofed in moveable folds, from field to field. 
Sea ware is alfo ufed, mixed with mofs and earth. Shell fand, 
not being found in this part of the country, is brought from 
the weftern parts of the counties of Rofs and Invernefs. It 
is laid on the lee grounds, produces good crops, and afterwards 
greatly enriches the pile of grafs. Lime-ftone is found here ; 
but the ufe of it is in a great meafure totally prevented, by 
the expenfivenefs of the fuel in this parifh. The quantity of 
rain which falls here is fo great, as to injure much the peat or 
turf ; yet notwithstanding this difadvantage, and the exorbit- 
ant price of coals, owing to the late heavy duty and freight, 
a few of the inhabitants have made an effort, and burn lime 
with fuccefs. 

Q^a Produce, 

* Seed-time is about the middle of March ; harvqft about the 24th of 
Auguft; but fome very rainy fealons retard the harveft to the fucceeding 
months. In the memorable i'8a, the weather being very cold and wet, the 
price of meal rofe to (26s. .per boll ; but, from the very great attention of go- 
vernment, in fending a feafonable fupply to the poor, and the management of 
thofc to whom the diftribution was committed, together with the charity and 
benevolence of the moft able and beft difpofed in the country, the condition q£ 
tie poor was rendered tolerable. 



1 ? 4 Staiifiical Account 

Produce, i$c— The common crops are barley, oats aiyl 
potatoes. The ordinary returns arc, of barley, "from 5 to 6 
bolls ; of oats, from 3 to 4 ; and of potatoes, from. 6 to 8, for 
I boll. Oats fell at from 133. to tp\ p er boll ; barley from 
15s. to 17s. ditto, Linlithgow meafure; and potatoes from 2s, 
to 5s. per barrel of 32 Englifh gallons. 

Lakes, Rivers and Fi/h— There is only one confiderable 
lake in thefe parities, named Lochnell, from which one of our 
principal heritors takes his title. It is 2 miles in length : Its 
greateft breadth is 4 mile. It has its name from the Gaelic 
word Eal, fignifying afiuan, a great number of thefe fowls 
frequenting it. It is clofely guarded by a zealous friend of 
the family of Lochnell. There are other lakes, but very in- 
confiderable. There is only one fmall river, which runs about 
3 miles, and then falls into an arm of the Weftern Ocean, 
called Loch-feachan. The fifa in thefe lakes, and in the above 
mentioned river, and fmaller brooks, are falmon, trouts and 
eels. The falmon are found in confiderable numbers in this 
fmall river, but of fmall fize. 

Sea Coajls, \§e. — The con ft is of a femicircular form ; and, 
including creeks and bays, may be about 20 miles in extent*. 
It is in general high and rocky ; but, at the end of the bays, 
flat, and fomewhat fandy. The fifti caught on this coaft are 
grey Mi of different kinds, ly.the, fome cod and ling, Ikate, 
flounders, &amp;c. There are no eftablilhed fimeries : They have 
been tried, but with little fuccefs ; perhaps owing to want of

parifh. It is fuppofed thefe towers were built by the Danes. They are built 
in view of one another, that the alarm of|an approaching enemy might begiverj

orooer tackle and of perfeverence. The fea animals, plants, 
and fea-ware, are the fame as is common over all the High, 
land coafts. Little kelp is made here : At an average, not above 
8 tons per annum. The tide flows northward, 

Harbors and Ferries, ^c.-There are 4 gopd ones ; namely, 
Oban, Dunftaffnage Bay, Ardmtraive, oppofite to Oban, in the 
ifland of Kerera, and the Horfejhoe Harbour, a little to the weft- 
ward of Ardintraive in the fame ifland. There are 3 ferries, 
viz. Conil Ferry, between this parifh and that of Ardchattan ; 
Port Kerera, between the main land and that ifland ; and the 
Mull Ferry, between the latter and the Ifland of Mull. There 
is a very remarkable current at the Ferry of Conil. From 
the Sound of Mull enters an arm of the fea, which runs up 
about 8 miles due E. to Bunaiv, in Muckairn, where the 
Lorn-Furnace Company have their refidence. It then turns 
to the N. E., through a glen in Ardchattan parifb, named 
Etive, about 10 miles. At Conil, where it enters by a nar- 
row pafs, being confined at half flood, and half ebb, it rufhes 
through with impetuous force, like a rapid river, over a 
rock, which is feen at low ebb, and reaches almcfl from fide 
to fide ; excepting that, on the Kilmore fide, it has an opening 
wide enough for veflels of confiderable burden to pafs through. 
The fea, at half tides, pours furioufly, and with fome noife, 
pver this rock, and forms a vail variety of little whirlpools, 
efpecially on the fide next the ocean. The ferry here, though 
in appearance very formidable, is yet fafe, by reafon of the 
{kill of the ferrymen in piloting their boats through it ; and 
may be croffed with fafety, when fome greater, and feemingly 
fmoother ferries cannot. 



Volcanic appearances There are fome appearances of this 

kind on part of the coaft. There arc ftones of different fpe- 

cies 9

Dr. H, RVEy, the B.fhop of Derry, and fo me other naturalifts 
who were on a tour through this country a few years ago,' 
afferted, that theft appearances were certainly volcanic. They 
evidently bear the traces of haying been in an igneous ftate at 
lotne dittant period. 

Echoes and Caves.-Therc is a very remarkable echo, a lit- 
tle to the N. W . of the old Caftle of Dunftaffnage, lying 
near Coml Ferry, a Englifh miles to the N. W. of it. It 
comes from an old chapel, where fome of the ancient kings, 
ot Scotland are faid to have been buried. It is near a rock, 
on the S fide of it, one point of which ftretches towards the 
chapel. If a man is placed on the one fide of the point, and 
fpeaks, reads, or cries aloud, the found of his voice is heard 
on the other fide, fo diftinftly reverberated from the chapel, 
as to make him imagine it comes from a perfon within the- 
chapel *._The're have been many caves, but moft of them 
are filled up by time. Urns have been found in feveral of 
them. There is a very remarkable one, in the face of a rock 
in the neighbourhood of Qban, narrow at the mouth, and ex- 
tending to an unknown length backwards. A colledion of 
human bones and Ikulls ftill remain in it f

* It is affirmed, that at fome former period, a man contracted an illnefs, 
■which terminated in death, by hearing a fermon on mortality read to him by 
an alarming voice, in the dufk of the evening, from the oppofite fide of the 
point, by a perfon who concealed himfelf. He believed the addrefs came, 
from one of the dead in the chapel. It warned him to prepare for death. 

t The account given of this collection is this, as related to the author of this 
article, by an old perfon ftill living in the neighbourhood : About 100 years

Roads, Bridges, tf*,— -There is one great line of road finifli- 
ed, from Conil Ferry to the extremity of the parifti, on the 
S., about 6 miles in length ; another from Oban to Kilmore 
Kirk, acrofs the middle of the parifh eaftward, about 4 miles 
in length ; and a third from Oban to Conil, running alfo eaft- 
ward. It is now the common road for carriages, &amp;c. from 
Oban to Inveraray .-^-Bridges are thrown over, wherever they 
are neceflary. Thefe roads have all been made during the in- 
cumbency of the prefent minifter, within thefe laft 33 years. 
There are 4 principal inns, viz. at Oban, Conil, Claghchom- 
bie *, and Kilmore, nigh the kirk, befides feveral fmaller 
ones. There is rather too much whifky drunk in all of them. 

Black Cattle and Horfes The breed of black cattle in this 

parifh is of the bell Weft Highland kind. They are a good 
deal larger than thofe in the North Highlands, and are much 
approved of at market.-— Such as are bred by gentlemen of 
property, bring from 4I. 10s. to 5I. 10s. a head; and fome 
have been fold at 61. and upwards. The cattle bred by the 

tenantry, 

years after, retunied with a banditti of mifcrcants, with whom he confpired to 
fet fire to the village near Oban, in which his grandfather dwelt. On the ap- 
pearance of the veffel, which brought them before Oban, the inhabitants received 
intelligence of their intentions, and likewife of the crew being infected with 
the peftilence ; on which the inhabitants collected a fuperior force, watchci their 
landing, apprehended them, and fhut them up within the cave, where, by the 
humanity of the young man's grandfather, they were (though clofely guarded), 
fed for fome time, till they all died of the difeafe which they brought to land 
with them. — A man, who died lately, once vifited this cave in his younger years, 
in the hopes of finding a treafure in it ; but found only a gold headed cane, and 
a large filver broach. Thefe, however, he afterwards returned, being haunted, 
as he believed, by fpeBres, till he had done fo. The ftory has a fuperftitious 
afpect, but is eafily accounted for, by the force of imagination. 

* Claghchombie inn is fituated where the roads from Oban to Inverary, and 
from Conil to Nether Lorn-crofs, meet. It is not far from Kilmore, and'wa* 
on the common carriage road to Oban, till of late, that the lower one was finilhed

tenantry, or lower daft of people, are fold from 3 I. 5 s. id

the North Highlands. They are exceedingly hardy and fit for 
every kind of labour. Their He is from 12 to 14 hands high 
and they are ftrongly made. 

Sleep and Swine — Sheep flocks are but lately introduced* 
here. Hitherto they have anfwered very well. They are of 
the black faced kind, bred in Annandale, and the high grounds 
about Moffat. As they increafe in numbers, they contribute 
much to wear off the heath; infomuch, that feveral hills, 
covered with it about 30 years ago, have now got a beautiful' 
furface of grafs ; although, alas ! at the expence of reducing 
the number of the poor farmers ; many of the villages being; 
quite depopulated. A fewperfons rear fwine, in fmafl num- 
bers ; but they are not of a good quality. 

Wild Quadrupeds . — Quadrupeds of the wild kind, here, are 
fuch as are common in moll parts of die Highlands of Scotland ; 
a few roes, many hares, of the largeft fize, wild cats, and a? 
few badgers and otters, which are numerous. The foxes are 
nearly extirpated. There are many pok-cats, and beautiful 
weafels, betides rats-, mice, and moles. 

Birds. — There are moor-fowls, black and" red ; butnot infuch 
numbers as formerly, owing to burning the heath, and the in- 
oreafe of the {beep. There are alfo plovers, wild-pigeons, crows, 
and rooks ; the latter are become fo numerous, as to be very 
definitive to the grain and potatoes. Of the migratory kind,- 
eve have wood-cocks, f wallows, fnipes, a few green plovers,

Scotland. We have alfo water fowls of various kinds. There 
Is one kind of duck, of the migratory tribe, called the widgeon. 
They abound much in our bays. They appear about the be- 
ginning of winter, aiid migrate about the end of fpring. If 
the end of autumn is fevere and ftormy, they appear fome- 
times before winter. 

Rents and Heritors.— The valued rent, as ftated in 1751, 
was 389I. 10s. 4d. : the real rent may be at prefent about 
328CI. There are 13 heritors, great and fmall, in the parifh, 
of whom only 4 refide. Services are in a good meafure abo- 
liflied ; but too many ftill remain. 

Ecclefiaftical State. — The church of Kilmore was built 
about 3 co years ago. It was originally in the form of a ca- 
thedral, and continued fo during the eflablifhment of Epifco- 
pacy in Scotland ; but, on the introduction of Prefbytery, as 
the old building became decayed, a part of it was repaired, 
and reduced to the lize of an ordinary large kirk, about 60 
feet long, and 20 broad — -The kirk of Kilbride is of a leffer 
fize, 40 feet in length, and 16 in breadth. The walls of Kil* 
more church are very fufficient : The roof and windows have 
received repairs at different times. It is poorly feated ; but 
there is reafon to think, that the heritors will foon make up 
this defect. The kirk of Kilbride is not fo fufficient in the 
walls, as that of Kilmore } and the feats are equally bad. It 
ftands greatly in need of repairs. Neither of them have 
church-yards ; but it is propofed to have them foon. Indeed, a 
few excepted, the kirks in the Weft Highlands are in a refer- 
able condition, compared with thofe in many other country 
parilhes in Scotland. But, as improvements of all kinds are 
fevefy where going on rapidly, we hope the churches, in this

The Duke of Argyll is patron—The whole parifli obferve 
the rites of the Eftablifhed Church, excepting 2 or 3 families, 
who are of the Epifcopal perfuafion. There is only a fingle 
family of the Seceffion. 

Schools — There is one parochial fchool kept at Kilmore. 
There is no fchool-houfe ; but it is propofed to build one foon. 
The Hated falary is iol. Sterling, with the intereft of 1000 
merks Scotch : But this laft fum is on a precarious footing, 
there being reafon to apprehend, that the intereft will be re- 
duced. The number of fcholars is fluctuating; in winter and 
fpring from 30 to 40, feldom 50. The lituation is very cen- 
trical for a numerous fchool ; and there have been at different 
periods very nourifhing fchools at this ftation. But, owing 
to the reduction of part of the funds which made up the fa- 
lary, the want of proper boarding places, and the fhort con- 
tinuance of feveral of the teachers, the fchool, for fome years 
back, has greatly declined. The quarterly payments for 
teaching, are, Englifh, is. ; ditto and writing, is. 6d. ; arith- 
metic, 28. 6d. ; Latin, 2s. 6d. There is a fiourilhing fchool 
at Oban, which will be noticed afterwards. There is one 
charity fchool in the ifland of Kerera, and one or more fmaller

fchools, kept up at the expence of the inhabitants, in the re- 
mote parts of the parifh. 

Poor The poor are fupported chiefly by the inhabitants 

of the parifh. They beg from door to door ; but are not 
very troublefome in this way, although the funds are by no 
means adequate to their numbers and wants : The whole 
amount, for many years, was from ill. to 14I., arifing from 
the weekly collections, and from a fmall mortification or two. 
But of late 32I. as. 3*d. was added by the commiflioners of 
the cuftoms, 30I. of which is laid out at intereft, and the odd 
money (2I. as. 3+3.) was diftributed among the poor, at the 
time when the order was given by the commiffipners. 

Population The number of inhabitants has greatly in- 

creafed within thelaft 50 years: For, notwithstanding that many 
farms have been turned into grazings, yet fuch is the fpirit of 
improvement, in making roads, inclol'ures by ftone walls 
and ditches, building houfes, &amp;.c. that the population, inftead 
of diminifhing, has increafed above a third within that period. 

It is difficult,, however, to afcertain the exaft number of the 
inhabitants of both thefe parifhes, as they are in a very fluc- 
tuating ftate, by many annually going to the Low Country, 
and from one part of this country to another ; but from th'e 
two laft years lifts*, there appeared to be, at an average, of

Manvfa&amp;ures — Of late a fmall branch of the cotton ma- 
nufadure was introduced into this quarter, by Mr. David 
Dale of Glafgow ; but its progrefs has hitherto been greatly 
retarded by the dearth of fuel. That caufe being now re- 
moved, other gentlemen of enterprife and public fpirit have it 
in contemplation, to eftablifh works of the fame kind. 

VILLAGE of OBAN — This village is fituated on the N. W. 
fide of the parifh, and covered from the Weftern Ocean by the 
IfUnd of Kerera. It has two entries, one from the S., and 
one from the N. The firft houfe of any confequence in Oban 
was built about So years ago, by a trading company of Ren- 
frew. They ufed the houfe as a ftore-room ; Oban being 
confidered, even then, as one of the moft convenient fituations 

in

in this country for trade. The next building was a cuftom- 
houfe, which was erected 28 years ago ; Oban being reckoned 
a proper place for cleanng cut veffels for the herring fifhery. 
It was foon after made the place of general rendezvous for 
the herring buffes ; and for many years, they reforted to it in 
great numbers, till other places of the fame kind were ap- 
pointed. Abput the year 1778, the fpirit of building arofe 
in this village, and has been gradually increafing till the pre- 
fent time. It was on that fide of Oban which belongs to the 
Duke of Argyll, that thefe buildings were firft erefted. But 
now, Mr. Campbell of Bunjiaffnage has feued out part of his 
property, for the fame purpofe, on the other fide ; and the 
demand for new lots daily increafes. Behind the village, there 
is a fhallow lake of fome extent, with Hoping banks, which 
are cultivated for hay, corn, and garden fluff's. The lake 
might, at fome expence, be drained. There is alfo a water 
that runs from it, into the fea, and divides the Duke of Ar- 
gyll's farm from Dunftaffnage's lands. 

Bay and Shipping.— The Bay of Oban is of a femicircular 
form, and from 12 to 24 fathom deep. It is large enough to 
contain 500 fail of merchantmen. The anchorage is every 
where good. About 20 years ago, there were from 20 to 
30 veffels regiftered at Oban, which were chitfly employed in, 
the fi(heries ; but, from the decreafe of that trade oh the 
N. W. coaft, the number of veffels is now much fmaller. 
Still, however, there are from 15 to 20 (loops employed in 
the fiftiing and coafling bulinefs ; and one veffel, from 250 to 
300 tons, is employed in the Baltic trade. But the traders, 
and inhabitants in general, labour under great inconvenience 
for want of a proper quay to difcharge their goods. It is 
hoped this defect will foon be fupplied.

Improvement of the Village. -This village arofe from a very 
fmall beginning. Till the cuftom-houfe was built, it confift- 
ed of only 2 or 3 houfes of mean appearance. But after the 
cuftom-houfe was erected, and fome trade began to arife, from 
the convenient fituation of the bay, lying near the Weftern 
Ocean, and in the vicinity of a populous country, the at- 
tention of the Duke of Argyll, Mr. Campbell of Dunflaff- 
nage, and fome other perfons particularly interefted in the 
profperity of the village, was attrafted. They feued grounds 
for building to a very confiderable extent ; and a great addi- 
tion of buildings is to be made this year. If encouragement 
is given to the trade of the place, by ereding a quay, it will 
go on to increafe to a very great height — We cannot omit 
mentioning here, with all due refpeft, two gentlemen, bro- 
thers, of the name of Stevenson, who have contributed very 
much by their induftry and adivity, to the improvement and 
profperity of Oban. They came to the place in 1778, in the 
line of plain tradefmen ; and, by their genius and ability, 
difplayed in various branches of traffic, they have greatly im- 
proved their own fortunes, while they have at the fame time 
promoted the good of the country at large : Oban, in parti- 
cular, may look on them as its founders ; for the elder bro- 
ther commenced, and fucceffively keeps up the bufinefs of 
fhip-building ; a branch never attempted to any extent before 
in this country. And the younger brother employs alfo 
many artificers in houfe-building. In a word, Oban and its 
environs are Angularly indebted to them, 

CharaBer of the People. — The change in the circumftances, 
the appearance, and the morals of the people of the lower 
clafs, in this parifh, has been confiderable, fince the prefent 
incumbent's admiffion. In refpect. of the firft, three fmall 
villages, of tolerable black farm-houfes, were almoft wholly 

• flocked 



Staiijllcal Account 

flocked with Inhabitants, confiding of tenants and cottagers, 
I he rents being then very moderate, the people lived com- 
fortably in their line, though on ample fare, and in homely 
clothing. But, fince that period, the rents have been doubled, 
nay, in fome parts tripled ; and many of their poffeffions have 
been taken by the more opulent : The lower tenants were, of 
courfe, obliged to remove and fliift for themfelves. The aged, 
the feeble, and the poorer fort, became cottagers ; but the 
moll vigorous, and by far the greater! number, engaging in 
the public works, which were carrying on over the country 
to a very great extent, found means to fubfift more comfort- 
ably. This circumftance afforded them a very providential 
relief, and tended to prevent their being infecled by the pre- 
vailing fpirit of emigration. As to their appearance, if we 
were to judge from the change in their drefs and manner of 
living, (particularly of the workmen and fervants), more 
efpecially of the younger fort, many of them have arrived at 
fuch a pitch of gaiety in the one, and of expence in the other, 
that their circumftances would appear to be much improved : 
B'4fe, there is reafon to believe, the change is more to be a- 
fcribed to their advance in luxury, than in opulence. It de- 
ferves, however, to be remarked, that the old tenants have 
hardly made any alteration in their manner of living. The 
excurfions made to the Low Country, by the labourers and 
fervants, may account, in a good meafure, for their advance- 
ment in luxury, in drefs and living. Thefe excurfions have 
alfo made a confiderable change on their language, and on 
their demand for wages, perhaps little to their own advan- 
tage, and certainly not to that of their country. The harti- 
Ihip is particulaily felt from the demands of houfehold fer- 
vants, whofe high wages have become an intolerable griev- 
ance. On account of their frequent intercourfe with the Low 
Country, they very foon learn the Englifli language, info- 
much

much that mod of them can fpeak it tolerably. But it is to 
be regretted, that they adulterate their native forcible lan- 
guage with Anglicifms, which produce a difagreeable medley. 

Morals.— The people of this parifh have been, fmce the 
prefent incumbent's admiffion, as regular, on the whole, as 
any on the Weftern Coaft. Indeed, he- has obferved, that, 
not only within his own parifli, but within the bounds of the 
prelbytery in general, there has been, fince his firft acquaint- 
ance with them, a very remarkable change to the better, in 
one very important part of duty, namely, in their attendance 
on, and decent behaviour at public worlhip, and at all religious 
ordinances. Moft of them are likewife docile and fond of in- 
ftrudion : And few people are lefs fubjea to religious divi- 
sions. A tin&amp;ure of enthufiafm indeed, never before known, 
began of late years, to infecT: a certain corner within the 
bounds of this prefbytery, and to fpread its baneful influence 
among a few individuals in the adjacent parifli ; but, by every 
appearance, it is now on the decline. The inhabitants, in 
general, are rational in their religion ; fober, with a very few 
exceptions ; laborious and induftrious : The gentlemen are 
well-bred, polite, difcreet and hofpitable.

(County of Banff— Prejbytery of Strathbogie— Synod of

By the Rev. Mr. James Scott, Minifies</head> 



<p>Form and Extent. 

THE parifli of Gartly is of an oval form, though no$ 
very regular. It is about 11 Englifh miles in length, 
from E. to W. ; and 6 in breadth, from S. to N., about the 
middle. 

River and Fijh — It is divided nearly in the centre, by the 
rivulet Bogie ; which, running in a ferpentine form, alfo di- 
vides the counties of Banff and Aberdeen, as it falls to the 
!N., and forms a very pleafant ftrath, from which this county 
derives its name, Strathbogie. Its banks are moftly covered 
with aller ; and it abounds with excellent yellow trouts, and 
falmon in the fpawning feafon. 

Surface and Soil, i£c.~ -The boundaries of this parifli, both on 

the 



of Gartly. *39 

the E and W. fides, are hilly, and moftly covered with heath- 
I„ thefe hills there is plenty of mofs, which not only fupplies 
the inhabitants of the parifti, but alfo the town of Huntly, 
with fuel. From thefe hills feveral fmall brooks fall into the 
Bogie. The vallies, fupplied by thefe brooks, are very fer- 
tile, as well as the lands on the different fides of the Bogie, 
when properly cultivated, though in general rather late. 

Cultivation and Praduce^he cultivation of the foil has 
been annually more and more attended to. fince the year l77 o 
At that time there were only two gentlemen farmer., (both 
of whom had been in the army), who had a field in turnips 
or fown grafs ; whereas now there is not one, who has not 
more or lefs of his farm under thefe crops. One of thefe 
gentlemen, who firft fet the example, and who is ftjll refident 
in the parifh, is now carrying his improvements itill farther, 
by introducing horfe-hoeing -, whereby he raifes moft lux- 
uriant crops of cabbages and turnips. The crops are, bear, 
oats, peafe, and potatoes; and the returns from thefe do much 
more than fupply the wants of the parifli. 

Cattle. The lands are now moftly tilled with horfes, 

which are of different fiz.es, fitted for the different ways they 
are employed ; and are in number above 340. The black 
cattle here are generally fmall, but of a very tight Highland 
breed, and about 1,500 in number. The Iheep are alfo of 
a fmall kind, and in number betwixt 4,000 and 5,000. 

Minerals There is a lime quarry in the parifti, but fo deep, 

and expenfive to work, that the farmers, rather than dig ftone 
from it, choofe to bring their lime from the diftance of 4-or 
5 miles. There is alfo a very fine flate quarry in the parifh.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1013827">KILWINNING</name>. 

{County of Ayr-Prejbytery of Irvine-Synod of Glafgo 

and Ayr. 

By the Rev. Mr. Thomas Pollock.</head> 



<p>THE Keledees, or Culdees, are fuppofed to have been 
originally Chriftian Britons ; and, about the latter end 
of the third century, to have fled into this country, to avoid 
the barbarous and inhuman cruelties, inflicted upon the Chrif- 
tians, during the perfecution under Dioclefian the Roman Em- 
peror. They were faid to have been diftinguifhed for their 
great learning, extraordinary piety, exemplary decency and 
purity of life and manners ; and, as minifters of religion, 
being unwearied in the faithful difcharge of their duty, they 
were univerfally held in the higheft efteem and veneration. 
From their retired and folitary way of living, their ufual 
places of refidence were called cells ; and, after their deaths, 
were turned either into parifh churches, or monasteries. Thefe 
icligious houfes were often dedicated to the memory, and 



Origin of the Name.

bore the name of the Keledee, who had been born, or educated, 
or buried in, or near fuch places. From Cella Winnini, there- 
fore, it is highly probable this parifh takes its name. There 
is a well, at no great diftance from the manfe, called Winning's 
Well; and a fair, held annually, on the firft day of February, 
is called Winnings-day Fair. Not many years after the erec- 
tion of the monaftery, Kilwinning, all over this part of the 
country, wa3 called Saig-town ; and, by this name, it is (till 
very well know to the inhabitants. Saig-town is evidently a 
corruption of Saints-town. From the mortified and contemp- 
lative lives of the monks, from the frequency of their devo- 
tions, and other religious exercifes, and from their reputation 
for learning and knowledge, they were regarded by the fu- 
perftitious, ignorant, and credulous laity, as an order of fu- 
perior beings. Nothing, therefore, could be more natural, 
than to call the place, where perfons of fuch characters lived, 
Saig-town, or the Town of the Saints. It ought alfo to be 
obferved, as it very ftrongly marks the fpirit and manners 
of thofe dark ages, that the fairs, in all the towns and villages 
connected with the monaftery, were named after fome parti- 
cular faint, who was afterwards accounted the protector or 
tutelar faint of the place : Such as, St. Anthony , St. Colm, or 
Columba, St. Margaret, St. Bride, or Bridget. The days on 
which thefe fairs are held, are (till called after the faint whofe 
name they bear ; as, Colm , s-day, Margarets-day, l$c. 

Situation and Extent. — It is fituated in Cunninghame, one 
of the diftricts or fubdivifions of the county of Ayr, and is 
feparated from the Weft Coaft, or Irifh Sea, by part of the 
parifhes of Irvine and Stevenftown. It is fuppofed to be 9 
Englifh miles in length, and, in fome parts of it, not much 
lefs in breadth. The figure, however, it forms, is very irre- 
gular, being in feveral places interfe&amp;ed by the neighbouring 

parifhes

panfhes. There is no map of the pariOi, nor has any regular 
meafurement ever been made of it. For this reafon, the pre- 
Cife number of acres it contains cannot be afcertained. 

General Appearance. — It lifes gradually from the W. and 
S. and S. W., to the E. and N. E. In both thefe directions, 
it terminates in what may be reckoned high lands, but with- 
out any intervening high hill, or mountain. The face of the 
parilh is beautifully diverfified, by thefe eafy, natural rifings, 
which flope gently towards the fea. The fummits of many of 
them, and particularly of fuch as are in the more immediate 
neighbourhood of the town, were planted by the late Earl of 
Eglintoune. The greater part of thefe plantations, being 
rather more than 46 years old, give a rich and very highly 
cultivated appearance to this part of the country. 

Climate, Difeafes, and Longevity. — The frequent, and fome- 
times heavy rains that fall here, are probably owing to the 
parifli being fo very near the fea, and to its fituation with refpe£t 
to Kintyre to the Iflands of Arran, of Bute, and the other 
Weflern Ifles. The atmofphere, by thefe rains, is often ren- 
dered thick and cloudy. The denfer parts of the clouds, how- 
ever, being attracted by the high hills on the S. and N., the 
air is, for the moll part, drier and purer, than in thofeparimes 
which are near or contiguous to thefe high hills. The rains, 
therefore, which fall here, though frequent, and at times 
fevere, are not known to produce any malignant epidemical 
diforders. Difeafes of this kind are, almofl: always, brought 
into the parifh from its intercourfe with other places, either 
nearer or more remote ; and they are even lefs malignant, or 
not fo fatal, as in thofe parts from which they are brought. 
From this peculiar wholefomenefs and purity of the air, the 
inhabitants are, in general, very healthy. Many of them 



of Kilwinning. 145 

live to a very advanced age. Within thefe 40 years, feveral 
have died confiderably above 80. During this period, a man 
died at 91, and a woman at the very great age of 104. There 
are now living 2 men of 85, one of 91, and not a few per- 
fons, of both fexes, between 70 and 82. 

Small P 0 *.-This. difeafe, it muft be acknowledged, is a 
melancholy exception to thefe fads, It rages here, at times, 
with the utmoft violence, and is often extremely fatal. In 
the fummer and autumn of 179^ upwards of 90 children 
had the natural fmall pox, and more than one half of them 
died. The chin-cough and natural fmall pox. not unfrequent- 
ly prevail at the fame time. When this happens, as was the 
cafe at the above period, the ravages committed by this laft 
difeafe, are truly dreadful. The coincidence of thefe difeafes 
might, in a great meafure, be prevented by inoculation. But 
though in this, and in every other refped, inoculation is at- 
tended with the happieft conferences, it is only praftifed 
here in two or three families. From ignorance, and the 
moll fupeftitious prejudices, the parents, regardlefs, or in- 
fenfible of confequences, inftead of inoculating their children, 
crowd into thofe houfes in which the difeafe is of the moft 
malignant nature, and at a time when it is the moft infedious. 
The very worft kind of this dangerous and loathfome difeafe 
is, in this manner, communicated and fpread, and thoufands 
of valuable lives are loft to the community. This impious 
prefumption, thefe illiberal and groundlefs prejudices, are not 
peculiar to this parifh ; in every other country parifh in Scot- 
land, the great bulk of the people think and act pretty much 
in the fame way. It is well known, at leaft to the clergy, 
that every argument in fupport of inoculation, however con- 
clufive or felf-evident, makes no impreffion upon their minds. 
To make a law, obliging all perfons, without diftin&amp;ion, to

inoculate their children, would be thought inconfiftent with- 
the hberty of Britifh fubjedts, and even with the common 
principles of humanity. But as the profperity, nay the very 
exiftence of every country, is infeparably conneded with the 
number of its inhabitants, fomething certainly ought to be 
attempted, to render, if poffible, inoculation in Scotland more 
general than it is at prefent. With a view to this, the fol- 
lowing outlines of a fcheme are humbly propofed. 

Jj, That by an aft of parliament, all the furgeons in Scot- 
land be appointed, under certain penalties, to keep regular 
feparate lifts, both of thefe children who are inoculated by 
them, and of thofe under their care, who take the difeafe in 
the natural way ; and to ftate the precife number of fuch as. 
die of the inoculated, and of the natural fmall pox. 

2dly t In order to fix, with the utmoft certainty, the exaft 
number of thofe children who take the natural fmall pox, 
that all parents be appointed, by the fame authority, and un- 
der the fame penalties, to inform their family furgeons, even 
of fuch of their children, as have the difeafe in fuch a fa- 
vourable way as not to need the affiftance of a furgeon. 

^dly, That thofe lifts be figned, and fent to Edinburgh, 
once every year, or oftener, if it mall be judged neceflary j 
and printed under the particular direction of government. 

qthly, That when printed, thefe lifts mall be immediately 
tranfmitted to the magiftrates and clergy of every town, and 
to the juftices of the peace, and the clergy of every country 
parifh, to be by them diftributed, and made as univcrfally 
known as poffible among the people. 

Stbly, That a falary to the furgeons, adequate to their 
trouble, be eftablifhed by government; as well as a fund for 
inoculating the ehiMrtti cl the poor.

A feries of fadts, thus clearly and fully ftated and authen- 
ticated, will, by degrees, it is hoped, convince even the mod 
ignorant and prejudiced of the propriety and neceffity of ino- 
culation ; and, at laft, make them readily and cheerfully fall

Lakes, Minerals, and Mineral Waters. — There is only one 
lake in the parifh, called the Afien-yard Loch. It abounds in 
excellent pikes and perches.— There are quarries of free-ftone 
in different parts of the parifh. Some of thefe ftones are of a 
very fine quality j and are carried in confiderable quantities to 
Irvine, and to feveral other places in the neighbourhood. 
Lime-ftone, of the very beft kind, and in very great plenty, 
is to be found in almofl every quarter and divifion of the pa- 
rifh.— There is one chalybeate fpring clofe by the town; from 
the ufe of which, perfons, labouring under nervous complaints, 
have received confiderable benefit. 

Collieries.—Thexe are three collieries in the parifh, viz. 
Eqfter Dowra, belonging to Lord Lifle, which lets at 140I 
per annum. At this work from i 3 to 16 colliers are em- 
ployed. Laigh Fergus-hill, belonging to the heirs of the late 
Mr. M'Dowal, which is at prefent under leafe, for a year at 
100I. Monk-greenan, the property of Mr. Bowman of Aflu 
grove. From 4 to 6 men are here ufually employed. It is 
let at 10I. a year. From the two firft of thefe coal-works 
there is ft,H a n exportation to Ireland, from the port of It 
vme. Th ls trade, however, is now very trifling and inconfi- 
aerable, compared to what it was formerly.

Riigrs and Fi/h, i$c There are 1 rivers in the parifh r 

Garnock and Lugton. The laft of thefe rifes in the parifh of 
Neilfton in Renfrewfhire. It runs through a great part of 
this parifh, and falls into the Garnock, about an Englifh mile 
below Eglintoune Caftle. There is plenty of very fine trouts 
in it. Garnock, by far the moft confiderable of thefe a rivers, 
has its fourc.e in the high hills in the parifh. of Kilbirney, 
about the diflance of 10 Englifh miles from the town of 
Kilwinning. After running for fome miles through this pa- 
rifh, it falls into the Irifti Sea at the harbour of Irvine. It is 
well ftored with falmon, and with different kinds of excellent 
trouts. The falmon fifhing, in this river, is at the befl in the 
month of July; and is the exclufive property of Lord Eglin- 
toune, from about one fourth of a mile above the tdwn, to 
where the river falls into the fea. Like all rivers which 
have their fources in very elevated fituations, it is liable to

fudden inundations*. On this river, and alfo on the Lugton, 
there are fome fixations extremely proper for eredrng cotton 
mills. There is a plentiful and conttant fupply of the very 
beft water for all kinds of machinery; a populous and htghly 
cultivated country, in the near neighbourhood of fome good 
market towns; oatmeal, the ordinary food of the labouring 
people, is cheaper by ,d., and fometimes by ad. a peck, than 
in Glafgow and Paittey ; and all other kinds of provifions are 
in the fame proportion. 

Roads and Badges. -There are 4 turnpike roads in the 
parilh. Thefe were . originally made and kept in repair by 
the ftatute labour. This was exaded formerly in kind ; but, 
for more than 20 years, it has, by an ad of parliament, been 
converted into money. Every farm, whether in tillage or m 
grafs, pays at the rate of 3d. Sterling for every pound Scotch 
of valued rent ; and every houfeholder, who does not occupy 
land to the amount of 12L Scotch of valued rent, pays 3s. 
Sterling yearly. Such poor families as produce a certificate 
to the colleftor, from the minifter, of their inability to pay 
this tax, are exempted from payment. The average annual 
amount of the money levied for ftatute labour is 99I. This 
fum being fufficient for making the roads, and keeping them 
in proper repair, there is no toll levied, nor any toll-bar 
erected in the parifli. Unfortunately, the 4 roads are almoft 
jn the very extremities of the W. and S. W. parts of the pa- 
rifh. 



* On the 19th of September 1790, there was a very remarkable inundation. 
The river rofe 4 feet higher, than ever it was known to have done at any former 
period. This flood did great damage to the growing corns, and carried into 
the tea great quantities of fuch as were cut down. The town lies on both fides 
of the river ; and the lower parts of it were laid almoft quite under water. As 
this inundation happened in the night, many of the inhabitants were in thegreateft 
danger, and had.juft time to efcape with their lives.

a new county road bill, is applied for, this road may be par- 
ijcularly included in it. 

Birds, Plants, Woods and 5W.--.The migratory birds are 
the cuckoo, the wood-cock, the bulfinch, and the green and 
gray plover.-There is no curious plant tp be found here 
The greater part of the parilh being cultivated, no rare indi- 
genous plants are to be met with, except a few of the Crypto, 
gamiaoi Linnaeus— There are no natural woods in the parilh. 
Befides the very extenfive plantations, the property of Lord 
Eglintoune, there are feveral other plantations in different 
parts of the parilh, and fome very fine full-grown old trees 
of afli, plane, beech and elm. The weather on the whole of 
this weft coaft is often very variable. There are frequently 
very quick tranfitions from heat to cold, from froft to rain. 
Thefe tranfitions, attended fometimes with violent S. W. and 
W. winds, are hurtful to vegetation. Trees, in general, and 
cfpecially all fuch trees as are of the refinous kinds, fuffer very 
much from them.~-About one half of the parifli is a ftiff, wet, 
clay foil, and the other a light fand and loam. 



Rent, 



of Kilwinning* i$i 

Rents, Agriculture, Sic.f The average rent of the 

farms, per acre, is i8s. The whole of the parifti is 
inclofed with hedge and ditch. Such of the hedges as 

are 



fBy way of contrail to the prefent improved fiate of the parifh, it 
may not be improper to infert the rent, mode of cultivation, prices *f privi- 
fions, &amp;c &amp;c. that took place about 50 years ago. In the year 174*. the 
average rent of an acre was 3s. The parilh was then wholly uninclofed, 
excepting an inclofure or two about Eglintoune Caftle. The farmers 
plowed with 4, and fometimes with 6 horfes, and 3 men. The bufinefs of 
of the third man.it was pretended, would keep the plough fteady, and prevent its 
flatting afide, or going out of the ftraight line. The ridges were exceffively 
broad, and raifed very high in the middle. Nearly two thirds of every ridge 
were left, in a great meafure, without any of the foil, and even the very little 
that remained being, during the winter, almolt covered with water, was foured, 
and confequently in a ftate that produced very little, either of grafs or grain. 
Every farm was confidered as divided into outfifld and infield, or, as this laft 
was called, the croft. The infield, or the crofc, was in proportion to the fize of 
the farm, from 6 to 1 6 acres. It was kept conflantly in tillage. The courfe of 
crops was, ift, bear; 2d, peafe and beans ; 3d, oats; then dunged for bear. The 
outfield was never manured. It was divided info two parts, cropt with oats z 
years, and paflured %. This was the general practice. There were fome who cropt 
it % years, and paflured 3. Produce from if to a county bolls. This produce 
did little more, (if fo much), than to defray the expences of feed and labour 
There was np fown grafs ; confequently no hay, except in fome few farms, a 
little coarfe meadow hay. From this flovenly and abfurd mode of management, 
the pafture was extremely fcanty, and of a very poor quality. There were no 
carts. The produce of the farm was brought to market in facks on horfeback. 
The dung was carried to the croft in fmall creels on horfeback, or in fledges. 
Though the foil was wet, and entirely without any fhelter, every farm kept a 
certain number of fhttep. The number varied according to the extent of 
the farm. They were conftantly houfed at night. The wool they produced 
was coarfe, and in very fmall quantities. There were very few milk cows. 
From their ignorance of a dairy, the profits the farmers made of the few cows 
they kept.were extremely inconfiderable. Skimm'd milk chcefe was the only kind 
they knew how to make.. The little fweet milk cheefe which was then ufed, 
was imported from Ireland. Lime was very little known, and ftill Iefs ufed as a 
manure. There were no potatoes planted, except perhaps a very few in a gar- 
den, or in the corner of a field.

are kept clean, and otherwife properly attended to, thrive ex- 
tremely well, and become, in a few years, a very ftrong 
fence. On fome farms, trees are planted in the hedges. It 
is much to be regretted, that this mode of inclofing was not 
more generally praftifed. Thefe hedge rows, befides the 
warmth and fhelter which they afford, embellifh and enrich, 
to a very great degree, the whole face of the country. What- 
ever reluctance and averfion, from ignorance or prejudice, 
the farmers might, at firft, difcover to inclofing, they now 
feel and acknowledge its advantages, and confequently are 
univerfally fond of it, Difregarding the former abfurd divi- 
fion into outfield and infield, or croft, farms are now divided 
into 3 or 4 inclofures, as nearly equal as poffibly can be done. 
Such farms as are divided into 3 inclofures, or, as they are 
commonly called, breaks, the tenant, by his leafe, is bound, 
under a certain ftipulated penalty, to plow one only of thefe 
at a time ; to crop 3 years, and pafture 5. The 4th year it 
is cut for hay. The principal crop is oats. He fows between 
6 and 7 bufhels an acre : Reaps, at a medium, from 5 to 6 
bolls. On a clay foil, or a rich loam, beans are fown, at the 
rate of between 5 and 6 bufhels an acre. The average pro- 
duce is 7 bolls, 5 bufhels to the boll. Four bufhels bear pro- 
duce 5 bolls, 8 bufhels to the boll. There is however very 
little bear now fown, and no wheat nor barley, and but few 
beans. The almoft univerfal crop in the parifh is oats. Some 
time in the month of Auguft it is limed on the fward ; and, 
about a fortnight or three weeks before plowing, whatever 
dung the farmers have, is laid out, and fpread over the lime. 
The price of lime at the draw-kill, is from «id. to 5d. a bu- 
ftiel. The ground is fown down the 3d year with rye-grafs 
and clover, at the rate of 3 bufhels rye-grafs an acre, and 
from 6 lb. to 10 lb. red and white clover. The produce is 
from 15Q to 200 ftones, 24 EnglUh lbs. to the ftone. Farms,

M into 4 inclofures, are managed precifely in the fame 
way • With this only difference, that every inclofure rea S 9 
years' inttead of 6.-The Scotch plough, of the lighteft and 
beft kind, is generally ufed • and it is drawn by 3, and fome- 
times by 4 horfes, with a man and a boy. The price of the 
plough is from 25s. to 30s. When the feafon happens to be 
Uncommonly dry, oats and beans begin to be fown about the 
middle of March ; but, in general, very little is fown before 
the month of April. Bear continues to be fown, from about 
the beginning to the latter end of May. There is no general 
harveft till about the firft, and fometimes the fecond week of 
September. It is moftly over about the latter end of Oaober. 
By far the greateft part of the hay and harveft work is done by 
women, at from is. to i^d. a day, without victuals. Wheri 
hired till the whole of the grain is cut down, which is the 
more general praftice, they have from 25s. to 30s., with 
board. 

Failure of the Crip in 1782.— Different caufes, no doubt, con- 
tributed to this failure, in different parts of the country : But 
in this parifh, and in others immediately on the fea coaft, the 
chief caufe of its failure was owing to a very fevere weft 
wind, about the middle, or towards the latter end of the 
month of Auguft, Which continued with the utmoft violence 
for a confiderable time. The corns had their roots loofened, 
and were otherwife much damaged by this ftorm. From be- 
ing in general very green, when it happened, in a few days 
afterwards they grew white, but never filled. Snow alfo, in 
fuch parts of the parifh as were at the greateft diftance from 
the fea, fell earlier, and in greater, quantities, than ever had 
been known at that feafon of the year. A boll of well ripen- 
ed oats yields, at an average, from 17 to 20 pecks of meal, 
and even, fometimes, more: But, in 1782, the boll of oats, 
Vol. XL U of 



I i4 Statlftical Account 

of 16 pecks, yielded only from 10 to 12 pecks of meal. The 
price of the peck of meal that year, was from i 4 d. to i8d, 
The parifli produces grain almofl equal to the confumption of 
its inhabitants, though more than one third of it be in 
pafture. 

Pqfiurage, \3c — In a wet clay foil, it generally takes 3 
acres to feed a milk cow j but, in a light dry foil, if, or at 
mod 2 acres, are fufficitnt. The weight of a milk cow is 
from 16 to 20 ftones ; the average produce from 4I. to 5I. 
For grafs to a horfe, 50s. ; for ditto to a milk cow, from 30s. 
to 40s. There is a great quantity of fweet milk cheefe made 
in the pariflh, and of the very beft quality ; for which there is 
a conftant demand in Glafgow and Pauley, and of late in 
Edinburgh. Every farmer has one, or more, one-horfe carts, 
worth from 5I. to 81. 

Potatoe Hujbandry, i^c. — Potatoes are raifed by horfe-hoe- 
ing, and are planted at the diftance of 3 feet between the rows, 
aiid 6 inches from plant to plant in the rows. The ground 
is dunged at the rate of from 50 to 70 carts an acre. It gets 
5 plowings ; the 2 firft with 3 horfes, and the other 3 with 
1 and 1 horfe. The planting and railing coils from 8s. to 
1 os. The potatoes are commonly raifed with the fpade, in- 
ftead of the plough, owing to the heavy rains, which generally 
fet in at the time they are raifed. The produce is from 30 
bolls an acre, and upwards ; the average price 6d. a peck. A 
potf toe crop is reckoned an excellent fallow for oats or bear. 
Lord Eglintoune has, under his own management, a very ex- 
tenfive farm, the greater part of which is of a light fandy 
foil. The high broad ridges are now reduced to low ridges, of 
8 feet each. One year before it is broken up, it is limed on 
the fward, at the rate of from 80 to 150 bolls an acre. The 

rotation;

rotation of crops is, the 2 firft years oats, ; the 3 d, a fallow, 
or a horfe-hoed crop of potatoes and turnips. This crop is 
dunged, at the rate of 60 carts an acre. The 4 th year barley, 
and fometimes oats. It is then laid down with natural grafs 
feeds, and clover and rye-grafs, and allowed to reft from 8 to 10 
years. The produce is from 6 to 10 bolls an acre. Comports 
of dung, earth and lime are fpread on the field in the 2d and 
3d years after it has been laid down. Cattle, fed on the farm, 
clear from 20s. to 30s. an acre—There are now only 3 malt 
kilns. 

Prices of Provtftons.— The average priceof oatmeal, for thefe 
laft 20 years, has been 1 i*d. a peck ; beef, per pound, 4 *dv; veal, 
4 d. ; lamb, 3d. ; pork, from 4 i*. to 5 d.; fweet milk cheefe, 
from 5 ^d.to6d.; fkimm'd milk ditto, from 2^d. to 4 d.; butter,

U 2 Manner 



*From the very imperfect Hate of agriculture in 174a, and for fever at 
years afterwards, the price of oatmeal was variable and uncertain. It was 
fometimes as high as i8d. a peck, and again fo very low as jd. a peck. The 
prices of butter, and other provilions, per lb. (24 Englifh ounces to the lb.), were 
butter 3d.; beef, from i*d. to ifd.; veal, ad.; lamb, I ^d.; mutton, r|d.; 
fldmm'd milk cheefe, l|d.; candles, 16 ounce to the lb, 4d ; hard foap, 4d.; foft

per boll, (8 Winchcfter bufhels per boll), from 9s. to ios. ; malt ditto, from ios. 
to 13s. 4d. The wages of a male farm fervant were from 35s. to 40s, per an n. 
of a female ditto, from a6s. to 30s. Domeftic female fervants had the fame 
wages. There were no domeftic male fervants, except fuch as were in livery, 
The wages of a day labourer were 3^d. or 4d. with his maintenance ; and 8d. 
7/ithout it.

Manner of Living, fcf,.-It is to be obferved, that, not- 
withftanding the very great rife of rents, and of fervants 
wages, the farmers live much more comfortably, and make a 
more decent and refpeftable appearance, than they did 50 
years ago*. Their rents are more regularly and pundually 
paid, and there are fewer bankruptcies, or failures among 
them. There is, however, a ftill greater, and more ftriking 
difference, in the drefs and manner of living of the tradefmen, 
than of the farmers. A good deal of Englifli broad cloth is worn 
by the men; and both miftreffes and fervant-maids, (for in 
point of drefs there is little difference between them), have 
their filk cloaks and bonnets, their muflin and calico gowns ; 
their ribbons and flounced petticoats, with cotton and thread 
ftockings. Tradefmen do not live nearly fo much on oatmeal 
as they did in 1742. There is fcarcely one of their families 
m which tea, with wheaten bread, is not ufed for breakfaft ; 
and very few that do not drink it in the afternoon. Farmers, 
tradefmen, and day-labourers, live a good deal on butcher 
meat, with potatoes, in 1792, upwards of 200 fatted cows 
were made ufe of, befides veal, lamb, and pork. 

Zeafes, 

* In 1742, the men wore ftrong coarfe cloth; the greater part, if not the 
whole, of which was fpun in their own families, and woven and dreffcd in tiie 
parifh. Knit woollen ftockings were then only beginning to be ufed by a few 
of the men. Plaiding hofe were ftill the general wear. There were no hats; 
bonnets were univerfally in ufe. — The wives of fome of the more wealthy and 
fubftantial farmers, and tradefmen, had filk plaids; but by far the greater part 
of the married women, red or ftriped worfted ones. Young women wore 
woollen cloaks, with hoods of the fame kind of cloth. This cloth was of home 
manufacture. They had no buckles in their fhoes; thefe were tied with a piece 
of red or blue tape. The women in general, and particularly the younger part 
of them, feldom put on fhoes and ftockings, excepting to the church, or to a 
fair or market. Their head-drefs was extremely plain and fimple. — They lived 
chiefly on oatmeal and milk, or butter and fkimmed milk cheefe. Butcher meat 

was

leafes The leafes are commonly of 19 or 21 years endur- 
ance. Thefe fhort leafes are a very great difcouragennent to 
theinduftry of the farmer, and confequently highly injurious to 
the interefl both of the proprietor and the tenant. With fuch 
a fhort leafe he will make no new experiments ; he will not 
even proceed with fpirit and animation, in the common beaten 
traft of hufbandry pradifed by his neighbours, or impofed oa 
him by the terms of his leafe. Or mould he, at the com- 
mencement of it, make any uncommon exertions, he very 
ibon becomes difpirited, if not carelefs and remifs. The 
thought of the fhortnefs of his leafe forces itfelf upon his 
mind, almoft inceffantly ; and he is fcarcely entered on poffcf- 
fion, when he thinks he fees the end of it. He has a young 
increafing family of children. They are unable to afiift him : 
He is neceffarily obliged to hire fervants, at very high wages. 
The education of his children, the board and wages of his 
fervants, and other unavoidable expences, embarafs him to 
fuch a degree, that, with all his induftry and attention, he 
can with the utmofl; difficulty pay his rent. After 12 or 14 
years, his profpecls begin to brighten. The oldeft of his 
children are now of fome ufe to him, in the cultivation of his 
farm. He knows, from experience, the different foils that 
are in his farm, and the different kinds of grain that are beft 
adapted to thefe foils. In a very few years he will have it in 

his power to difmifs all his fervants, and to work his farm

of November, a few fmall Highland cows were brought from the iflands of 
Arranaod Bute, and fold at from 13s. 4d. to aos. One of thefe was divided

circumftanccs, fometimes killed a cow in November, which had given milk till

muft remove he knows not whither, and leave the fruits of 
his laborious and painful induftry to another ; a ftranger, per-

fuch is the ftate of leafes, can the country be cultivated with 
fpirit and effecl: ? To accomplifh this, the farmer muft have 
fomething like the idea of property in his poffeffion, or, at 
leaft, the higheft degree of probability of tranfmitting it to 
his children. To render this equally advantageons to the 
landlord and to the tenant, the form of a leafe, propofed in 
his book on hufbandry, by the very ingenious, learned, and 
patriotic Lord Kames, feems to be more effeftual, than any 
other hitherto offered to the public *. 

Horfes. — There is a very excellent breed of large, flrong, 
handfome horfes. They are brought from Laaarkfhire when 
about a year old. The average price is I2l, After being 
kept for 4 or 5 years, they are fold, from 25I. to 40I., for 
the draught or carriage.

Thefe are all of the eftablifhment, except 212 Antiburgher 
Seceders, a few families of Burghers, and an equally fmall 
number of the Relief perfuafion. There are no Epifcopalians 
nor Roman Catholics. From the moll unqueftionable tradi- 
tion, it appears, that, about 50 years ago, the country parifli 
was confiderably more populous than it is now. The caufes 
of ' this decreafe in the population feem to be the three fol- 
lowing : ijl, The union of two or more fmall farms into one 

large farm. This has happened in not a few inftances. idly. 
The barony of Eglintoune, formerly one of the moft populous 
quarters or divifions of the parifh, is inclofed and farmed by 
Lord Eglintoune, and inhabited only by a very few families 
of his Lordfhip's fervants. $dly, The almoft total want of 
cottagers. Every farm had formerly one or two, or more of 
thefe families upon it. The cottages are now, in a great mea- 
fure, demolifhed j and this numerous and induftrious clafs of 
people has been under the neceffity of removing to Irvine,, 
and to the other towns in the neighbourhood. From the want 
of trade and manufactures, very few of them fettled in Kil- 
winning. Owing to the rapid progrefs of manufactures, how- 
ever, the population in the town has, for fome years paft, been 
on the increafe. From the fpirit of induftry and enterprife 
univerfally fpread through the country, there is every degree 
of probability, that thefe will make a ftill more fuccefsful and 
extenfive progrefs ; and that the population will proportionably 
increafe.

pated and profligate indulge themfelves in it to excefs, to the hurt, and fre- 
quently the ruin of their families. Were government to raife the duties on •whijky, 
arid lower them on ale, this, in all probability, would increafe the revenue, and

Within thefe 3 years, 2 houfes have been ereded for fpinning 
cotton, with common and mule jennies j alfo a cotton mill, 
on a fmall fcale, for carding the cotton. In thefe 2 houfes 
there are 12 mule jennies, and 16 common ones. The per-

None of the yarn is manufadured here into cloth. It is fold 
in Glafgow and Paifley. As long as this is the cafe, the cot- 
ton manufacture can never be carried on to any extent. 
Though a large capital be no doubt necefiary, for bringing 
cotton goods of all kinds into the market, it is not, how- 
ever, fo much the want of a capital, as of a market, that 
prevents the manufacturers in this place, and on the whole 
of this weft coaft, from manufacturing their own cotton yarn. 
The readieft, and, every thing confidered, perhaps the moft 
advantageous market for this weft country, would be Ireland. 
But fo very high are the Irifti duties on Scotch muflins, and 
on every kind of Scotch goods, in which there is fo much as 
a fingle thread of cotton yarn, as amounts to a total prohibi- 
tion of carrying thefe goods to the Irifti market. This giyes 
the greateft encouragement to fmuggling, and has alfo made 
feveral very confiderable cotton manufacturers leave Glafgow, 
and other places in its neighbourhood, and fettle in Ireland. 
At the fame time, it is not a little furprifing, that Irifh linens 
are brought into Scotland duty free. Does not this difcover 
an undue partiality in favour of that kingdom ? It is thought, 
that no lefs than ioo,oool. worth of Scotch muflins, and other 
Scotch cotton goods, would be annually fold in the Irifh market, 

were 



of Kilwinning. 163 

were it not for thefe exceffively high duties. An objeft of 
fuch importance to the commercial intereft of Scotland, merits 
the moft ferious attention of the Britifh parliament. Should 
the Irifh, upon an accurate and fair ftatement of the matter, 
refufe to lower the duties on Scotch cotton goods, it is hum- 
bly fubmitted, how far it would not become the wifdom and 
juftice of the Britifh parliament, to lay a proportionable duty 
on all Irifh linens brought into Scotland. 

Flax and Mills.— From 12 to 14 hogfheads of flax feeds are 
fown annually. The flax is fpun and manufactured for the 
various family ufes of the inhabitants. A very fmall quan- 
tity of it only is made into a coarfe kind of cloth, called barn, 
which is brought to market, and fold for fhirts to the lower 
clafles of the people. There is a flax mill, at which 137 
ftones of flax are dreffed annually ; befides a waulk or fulling 
mill ; 4 for grinding corn, 1 for wheat, and 2 for barley*. 

^thirlage.^-h. great part of the p2rifh is thirled to the Kil- 
winning mill, called the Abbey Mill, and to the Mill of Seven 
Acres, the property of Lord Eglintoune. Some farms pay 
an exceffively high multure, no lefs than the iath peck. This 
fervitude is evidently a very great hindrance to improvement. 
It makes the millers more negligent than otherwife they 
would be. They know that the corns of fuch lands as are 
thirled mud be brought to them, in whatever carelefs, or even 
fraudulent a manner, they may juftly be fufpe&amp;ed of hav- 

X 2 ing 

* Fifty years ago there were no barley mills, Inftead of thefe, almoft every 
family had a pretty large ftone, called a morter ftone. This ftone was hollowed 
by a mafon to what was reckoned a proper depth. Into it was put as much 
bear or barley as could be eafily wrought. A little water was thrown upon it, 
to make it part with the hulks. It was then beat with a large wooden mcll, or 
mallet, tifl\it was fit to be ufed for making broth. 



Statical Account 

ing done their duty. Small proprietors, therefore, ought cer- 
tainly to purchafe their thirlage, at almoft any price ; and 
proprietors of mills ought to free their own lands of this bur- 
den, and lay an additional rent on their tenants, equal to what 
is paid by the mill to which they are bound. Thirlage being 
once abolifhed, and farmers at liberty to go where they plea fed 
wuh their corns, mills would be erefted in the moft convenient 
parts of parifhes, grain of courfe would be better ground, 
and at a much lower rate, and a great deal of time and labour 
would be faved to the farmer. 

Fuel— The moffes in the parifh are, the Mofs Mulloch, 
the Auchenmode and Anchentyber Mojfes. This lad mofs is 
fuppofed to contain more than 200 acres. In fome parts of it, 
it is very deep, no lefs than from 12 to 16 feet. It produces 
very good peats. When the fummer is dry, thefe make ex- 
cellent firing, and are ufed as fuch by the neighbouring farm- 
ers. But the ufual and common fuel of the inhabitants is 
coals. In no parifti, perhaps, in Scotland, is there coal in 
greater plenty, or of a better quality, than in this parifti. Very 
lately, however, the price of coals has been raifed exceflively 
high. A load of coals, 8 loads to the ton, which, 50 years 
ago, coft from 3d. to 4d. at the coal pit, is now 8d. ; and the 
probability, at prefent, is, that it will be advanced to a ftiil 
higher price. This fcarcity and dearnefs of coals is owing 
entirely to their not being wrought. Not to mention the in- 
humanity o£ fuch a conduct to the deftitute poor, proprietors 
of coals certainly miftake their own intereft, in fuffering them 
to remain unwrought. An additional rife on coal, is to them, 
when properly confidered, a very trifling object, compared 
with the rife of the rents of their lands ; and this can be ef- 
fected only by the improvements in agriculture, and the in- 
crease of trade and manufactures. But it is a fact univerfally 

acknowledged, 



of Kilwinning, i6^ 

acknowledged, that few, if any, real improvements in agri- 
culture can be made, and that trade and manufaaures cannot 
be extended to any great and permanent degree, without cheap 
fuel. Influenced, then, by a fenfe of their own intereft, let 
proprietors immediately work their own coals, and, at the 
fame time, lower the price of them. This will induce farmers, 
manufacturers and tradefmen, to leave thofe places in which 
firing is fcarce and dear, and fettle in this parifh. 

Poor. There are at prefent on the poor's roll 36 perfons, 

who receive from as. to 5s. per month. Befides thefe, a 
young men, fatuous, are maintained at the rate of 8s. 8d. 
a month, each. The annual ^amount of thefe peniions is 55I- 
Diftribution is alfo made, occafionally, to other poor fick 
perfons, not on the penfion lift ; and even to thofe penfioners,

There are 3 charitable focieties belonging to the parifli. 
When any of their members, from ficknefs or age, are un- 
able to work, they are regularly, and even liberally fupported 
by thefe focieties. At prefent, there are only 3 beggars in 
the parifh ; but the inhabitants are greatly oppreffed with 
beggars from other pari flies, and even with feveral from Ire- 
land. The number of poor has, of late years, very much in- 
creafed, and is ft ill on the increafe. From the very advanced 
wages of the manufa&amp;uring and labouring people of every 
defcription, and from the idlenefs, the diffipation and profli- 
gacy of manners, the ufual, and, indeed, the almofl infepar- 
able confequences of very high wages, it is next to an abfolute 
certainty, that the poor, in a few years, will increafe in a 
proportion hitherto unknown in Scotland. The common and 
ordinary funds, particularly in populous manufacturing pa- 
rifhes, will be unable to fupport them. In thefe parifhes the 
poor's funds, from many very obvious caufes, are, for fome 
years pad, greatly diminifhed. One very general and prin- 
cipal caufe of this decreafe is, that men of rank and for- 
tune are very irregular, and even criminally negligent, in their 
attendance upon divine fervice on the Sabbath. This conduct, 
however fafhionable, is not only difrefpectful to religion, dis-

low rent of The tenant alfo pays % bolls and 6 pecks of meal yearly to 
the parifh minifter, and the half of the cefs and fchoolmafter's falary. This 
very extraordinary length of a leafe was thought, by many, to be beyond the 
powers of the minifter and feffion to grant. By the advice of a lawyer, of the 
very firft character for profeffional knowledge and abilities, the prefent incum- 
bent, with the concurrence of the feffion and principal heritors, commenced a 
procefs of reduction before the Court of Seffion. The CoHrt, however, gave a

graceful to the laws of their country, and pernicious in the 
higheft degree to the morals of the people at large, but muft 
eventually bring, upon tbemf elves, affefiments, or poor's rates. 
Of all the taxes impofed on the people of England, this is one 
of the moft oppreffive, and ruinous to the profperity and im- 
provement of their country. In England, the poor's rates are 
rapidly increafing to the enormous fum of three millions 
Sterling yearly I An evil of fuch magnitude ought moil 
anxioufly to be guarded againft, and, if poffible, to be pre- 
vented by every clafs of men in Scotland, and, in particular, 
by the landed intereft. To render this tax unneceffary, or, at 
all events, to leffen it, mould it be found impoffible to be al- 
together prevented, every man of property, once a year, or 
oftener if neceffary, ought regularly to fend the amount of 
his weekly charity to his own parim church ; and to every 
other parifh, a fum proportioned to the property he holds in 
that parifh. 

Ecclefiajlical State.— There is at prefent but one clergyman, 
the minilter of the Eftablimed Church. An Antiburgher 
minifter, ordained in 1762, died about 3 months ago. The 
ftipend was augmented in 1786. The living is now worth 
140I., befides a glebe of between 4 and 5 acres, and a very 
excellent manfe, built in 1773. The church is a very beauti- 
ful ftructure, built partly in the ancient Gothic tafte, to corre- 
fpond to the venerable ruins of the monaftery. But though 
it be almoft 10 years fince it was built, it has never been 
feated. This has been owing to an unhappy difference of 
opinion among the heritors about the divilion of the area of 
the church, and 7 which is ftill unfettlcd. The Earl of Eglin- 
toune is patton of the parim.

Schools.— Ite falary of the parifh fchoolmafter h 9 !.  
This, with the fchool fees and other emoluments, makes the 
office of fchoolmafter worth about 25I. a year. There is a 
fchool-houfe, but no hotife for the fchoolmafter. Englifh, 
writing, arithmetic, and book-keeping, with the Latin, Greek' 
and French languages, are taught in the parifh fchool. There 5 
are alfo 2 other fchools in the town, and 2 in the country part 
of the parifh, intended chiefly for teaching Englifh and writ- 
ing. The education of youth is indifputably of the very ut« 
moft importance to the religious and civil interefts of fociety. 
No clafs of men, therefore, can bt of more (if indeed of 
equal) confequence and utility, than parifh fchoolmafters. But, 
to the difgrace of an enlightened and liberal age, thefe men 
have been mod amazingly neglefted. Their falaries, when 
originally fixed in Scotland, bore a reafonable proportion to' 
the value of money, and to the price of labour and provi- 
fions. Even then, however, it was only by the greateft at- 
tention, and the moft rigid economy, that they were enabled 
to live with any kind of decency, and fecure that degree of 
xefpecl: fo abfolutely neceffary to their ufefulnefs. For many 
years after that period, parifh fchools were filled with men 
highly refpe&amp;able for their exemplary lives, and for their fu- 
perior parts and learning. Hence that tafte for literature, 
that general knowledge, for . which the Scotch were fo deferv- 
edly celebrated, whilft the great mafs of the people of the other 
nations of Europe were funk in the moft favage ignorance. 
Since that time, the mode of living is entirely changed. 
Every article of drefs, provifions and houfehold furniture is 
rifen to a degree almoft incredible ; and a milling, in real va- 
lue, is worth little more than a penny was then. For thefe 
reafons, the falaries of the judges in Scotland, and the livings" 
of the greater part of the clergy, have been confiderably in- 
creafed ; but no addition whatever has been made to the fa- 
laries 



ef Kilwinning* 169 

laries of pariflr fchoolmafters. A common tradefman, or day 
labourer, if fober and induftrious, will earn a great deal more 
than the generality of fchoolma{ters can poffibly do. Is it to be 
imagined, that a man having any thing like a liberal education, 
and, in other refpefts, of an unblemimed ctiatft&amp;er, will en- 
gage in an office, the duties of which are fo extremely labo- 
rious, for the miferably narrow, fcanty pittance at prefent 
annexed to it ? Should trade and commerce make the fame 
rapid and extenfive progrefs, which of late they have dune, 
parifli fchools, it is to be feared, will be filled with perfons 
wretchedly ignorant, or of grofsly indecent and immoral 
lives. The confequences of this, to the riling generation, are 
too painful to be dwelt upon. Some evils, in order to be re- 
dreffed, need only to be mentioned. A fenfe of duty, and genu- 
ine patriotifm, it is hoped, will ftrongly and effectually impel 
parents, and the friends of humanity and virtue, to unite m 
applying to the legifiature, to make a far more decent and 
comfortable provifion tor pariih tchoolmafters, than is done at 
prefent.

James Bethune, Archbiftiop of Glafgow, and Commendator of Kilwinning, 
He was fucceedtd, as Abbot of Kilwinning, by Gavin Hamilton, the laft 
Popifh abbot cf this place. Abbot Hamilton was a firm and zealous friend of 
the Queen Regent, and of her beautiful but unfortunate daughter, Queen 
JVIary ; and was employed by them in feveral very important negotiations. 
He was killed in the Canongate of Edinburgh, June 28th 1371. In the year 
1553, he made Hugh, Earl of Eglintoune, jufticiary, chamberlain, and bailie 
of Kilwinning, and gave him a confiderable falary for difcharging thefe offices. 
This grant was confirmed by the Queen f , 

* The above Earl of Glencairn obtained a grant of the abbey, and made 
his fon Alexander commendator of it. To him fucceeded William Mel- 
ville, of the family of Raith. On his refignation, January 5th 1603, Hugh 
Earl oi Eglintoune got a new grant of the abbey, with all the lands, and titles, 
and patronage of the churches at that time belonging to it, erefted into a tem- 
poral lordfhip. At the Reformation, the revenue of the monaftery, exclufive of 
the property lands, amounted to 840I. 3*- 4d Scotch, 8 bolls of wheat, 14 chal- 
dcrs 1 holl and 15 pecks of bear, 67 chalders of oatmeal, 13 ftirks, 140 capons, 
100 hens, 268 cheefes,and 9 fathom of a peat ftack. According to the tradition- 
ary account of the entire levenue of the monaftery, it is affcrtcd, that its prefer*

of God in Scotland, was, in a great meafure, laid afide, or 
could with the greateft difficulty be performed, on account of 
the noife of the hammers and trowels, which were employed 
in erecting monafteries and other religious houtes. It was 
during this period that a number of mafons came from the 
Continent to build this monaftery, and with them an architea 
or mailer mafon, to fuperintend and carry on the work. This 
archited refided at Kilwinning ; and being a gudc and true 
mafon, intimately acquainted with all the parts of mafonry 
known on the Continent, was chofen mafter of the meetings 
of the brethren all over Scotland. He gave rules for the con- 
dud of the brethren at thefe meetings, and decided finally in 
appeals from all the other meetings or lodges in Scotland. 
From this time, down to the 15th century, very little of ma- 
fonry can be known, with any degree of certainty; only it is 
faid, that at Kilwinning the head meeting of the brethren was 
held. King James I. of Scotland, eminently diftinguifhed 
for his knowledge and tafte in polite literature, and in the fine 
arts, not long after his return from England, patronized the 
mother lodge of Kilwinning ; and prefided as grand mafter, 
till he fettled an annual falary, to be paid by every mafter. 
mafon of Scotland, to a grand mafter, chofen by the brethren, 
and approved by the crown. This grand mafter was to be 
nobly born, or a clergyman of high rank and character. He 
had his deputies in the different counties and towns of Scot- 
land. Every new brother paid him a fee at entrance. As

grand matter, he was empowered to regul tte and determine 
every matter in difpute, between the founders and builders of 
churches and monafteries, and which it would have been im- 
proper to have decided by a court of law. King James II. 
con! erred the office of grand mafter on William Sinclair, 
Earl of Orkney and Baron of Roslin. By another deed of 
the fame king, this office was made hereditary, in this very 
ancient and'illuftrious family. Earl William, and his fuccef- 
fors, barons of Rollin, held their head courts, or, in the ftyle 
of mafonry, afTembled their Grand Lodges, at Kilwinning, 
as being the mother lodge, or the place where regular and 
Hated lodges had firft been held in Scotland. The fobriety 
and decency of the brethren in all their meetings, the very 
peculiar and diftinguifhing union and harmony, in which they 
lived together, and their humanity and liberality to the fick 
and indigent, made the mother lodge highly refpe&amp;ed in the 
i6'h century. An uncommon fpirit for mafonry then difco- 
vered itfelf. Laws, founded on the original acts and conftitu- 
tions of the mother lodge, were renewed, and are ftill inva- 
riably adhered to. This is evident from her records ftill 
extant*.

Earl made a donation to the fraternity of a piece of ground, for building a new 
and very elegant lodge ; and, with many other gentlemen, anxious to prefervc 
the fights of the very ancient and venerable mother lodge, liberally contributed 
to its erection. There is a common feal, expreffive of the antiquity of the mo-

YO ung men in every pariftx were ftriftly commanded to prac- 
tice archery, for an hour or two, every Sunday after Avtne 
fervice. After the invention of fire arms, archery was la.d 
afide, as no longer ufeful and neceffary in war. Though for 
this reafon it was difufed in moft other places in Scotland, it 
has been pradifed here, as an elegant and manly amufemeut, 
almoft without any interruption, to the prefent day. At the 
fame time, the laws and ufages of the Company, (the term 
U fed for the Society), are known, and that too very imperfea- 
ly, only by tradition, prior to the year 14S8; This date is 
acknowledged and rendered authentic, by a minute in the re- 
cords, dated September 168S. This minute is figned by a num- 
ber of gentlemen of the moft refpedable charafters. From this 
time, archery has been pradifed annually, at a certain Hated 
time of the year, generally in the month of June. What 
has contributed, perhaps more than any thing, to its continu- 
ance, has been the monaftery. This fuppofition is rendered 
highly probable, from the fpecies of archery in ufe here from 
time immemorial. It is of two kinds. The one is a per- 
pendicular mark, called a popingoe. The popingoe is a bird 
known in heraldry. It is, on this occafion, cut out in wood, 
fixed in the end of a pole, and placed 120 feet high, on the 
fleeple of the monaftery. The archer, who moots down this 
mark, is honoured with the title of Captain of the Popingoe. 
He is mafter of the ceremonies of the fucceeding year, fends 
cards of invitation to the ladies, gives them a ball and fupper, 
and tranfmits his honours to pofterity by a medal, with fuit- 
able devices, appended to a filver arrow. The prize, from 
1488 to 1688, was a fafh, or, as it was called, a benn. This 
was a piece of taffeta or Perfian, of different colours, chiefly red, 
green, white and blue, andnotlefs in value than 20I. Scotch. 
This honourable badge was worn by the captain, which he kept, 

and

and produced another of equal value the following year. At 
the revival of archery in 1688, there was fubrtituted a piece of 
plate, which continued to be given by every captain till 1725. 
*The prize was then converted into the prefent filver arrow. 
—The other kind of mooting, is for prizes at butts, point- 
Hank diftance, (about 26 yards.) The prize at butts, is fome 
ufeful or ornamental piece of plate, given annually to the 
fociety by the fenior furvivirig archer. 

Eminent Men — Eglintoune Caftle, the feat of the family 
of Egliutoune for upwards of 400 years, is in the parifli. 
Of the men of this family, eminently remarkable for their 
patriotism, their loyalty, their high fenfe of honour, and dif- 
tinguiflied abilities in peace and war, the two following only 
fhall be mentioned. At the battle of Otterburn, Sir John 
Montgomerie, married to the heirefs of Eglintoune, and 
niece to King Robert IL, had the command of part of the 
Scotch army under the brave Earl of Douglas ; and his per- 
fonal valour and military conduft contributed not a little Co 
the celebrated victory obtained over the Englifli. The re- 
nowned Henry Percy, well k nown by the name of Uotjpur, 
and general of the Englifli army, Sir John Montgomerie took 
prifoner with his own hands, and with his ranfom built the 
caftle of Punnoon, in Renfrewfhire. — All the valuable im- 
provements :n gardening, planting, and agriculture, which, 
within thefe 50 years, have been made in the parifli, and in- 
deed in the greater part of the county of Ayr, are owing in 
a great meafure to the uncommonly fpirited exertions, to the 
very refined and correcl: tafte, of /Vldxandek, the late Earl 
of Eglintoune. By minute and accurate inquiry and obfer- 
vation, he made himfelf acquainted with the ttate of Englifli 
agriculture, with the truly noble and generous defign or be- 
nefiting his native country. Deeply regretting the idlenefs,

the lazinefs and the poverty of the farmers, und the very igno- 
rant and abfurd manner inwtnch they cultivated. their lands, ms 
Lordfhip, at a great expence, engaged and brought to his 
eftates in the parilh, and other parts of the county, men of 
real knowledge and experience in agriculture, who had been 
regularly bred to it,* and who had long fuccefsfully pradifed 
it By the convention and example of thefe pradical im- 
provers, the people, roufed from their former torpui fete, 
ventured to deviate from the mode of management handed 
down by their forefathers ; and, convinced at laft, of the 
infinitely fuperior advantages of this new fyftem of hufbandry, 
by degrees adopted it. His Lordfhip alfo inftituted an agri- 
cultural fociety, confifting of the moll a&amp;ive, intelligent, and 
refpedable farmers. In this fociety he prefided for feveral 
years. By communicating fuch observations as were the effefts 
of his own experience, and fuch as he had collected in con- 
verting with men of knowledge, his Lordfhip excited and dif- 
fufed a keen and enterprifing fpirit of induftry and experi- 
ment ; the very happy effects of which, in the improvement 
and wealth of the country, had little more than appeared, 
when he died by the hands of an unprincipled and mercilefs 
affaffin. His Lordfhip's farm of Eglintoune, with the planta- 
tions, contains about aooo acres Scotch raeafure. The whole 
is planned and executed, with fuch an exquifitely fine tafte, 
as to render the ancient feat of the family, one of the nobleft 
and moil beautiful of any in Scotland. To the patriotic ex- 
ertions of this truly great man, his country chiefly owes the 
aft of parliament, which abolilhed what was called the optional 
claufe of the Scotch banks. By the above claufe, the banks 
had it in their power, to refufe payment of their notes, for no 
lefs than fix months after it had been demanded. This cer- 
tainly was a very great national grievance, and had it continued, 
Scotland could never have made the improvements, which it 

has

has done, in agriculture, in commerce, and in manufactures. 
Sincere and fteady in his friendfhips, humane and generous, 
the patron of unfortunate merit, of the mod polifhed and 
agreeable manners, and poffeffed of all the more amiable and 
efpeftable virtues, the death of the late Earl of Eglintoune 
will be long and painfully regretted by every good man, by 
every friend of humanity, and of his country *♦ 

Names of Places.-^ -Not a few of thefe, it is faid, are ori- 
ginally Gaelic ; fuch as, Auchenmade, Auchentyber, Auchen- 
nvinjie, Auchenfarvie, \£c. Other names are evidently Engl ifh. 
Of thefe, fome are defcriptive of their particular fituations, 
as Wood, Wood-fide, Wood-end. Tradition fays, that in thefe 
places, there was in former times a very extenfive wood ; but 
there is not the leaft veflige of it now remaining. Other 
names defcribe their ancient proprietors ; as Smiths-town, 
Fergus-hill-hall, %3c. 

W«t and Cold Summers. — Tt is in the recollection of many 
ftill living, that the fummers, in this part of the country at 
leaft, are now much more wet and cold than they were 50 
years ago. By men of undoubted veracity it is afferte-d, as 
an abfotutely certain fact, that, at that period, the farmers, 
m plowing for bear, about the middle of the month of May, 
were under the neceffity of beginning to plow fo very early 
as at 3 o'clock in the morning, and to leave off at 8. The 
heat, at that hour, became fo very intenfe, that it was impof- 
fible for them to continue their work any longer: Nor could 
they begin again till between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon.

For a number of years paft, quite the reverfe has been the 
cafe. The month of May, in particular, has been very cold 
and wet, and unfavourable to vegetation ; and, in fome years, 
we have had very little of what may be reckoned fummer 
weather. The harveft of courfe, then, was much earlier than 
it has been fince. In feveral places in the neighbourhood, it 
is faid, the harveft was finilhed about the latter end of Auguft. 
The fafts themfelves are here barely ftated : The phyfical 
caufes of fo very remarkable a change are left to be accounted 
for by others. 

Character of the People. — The people are, in general, very 
decent, fober, honelt and induftrious. Owing to the filk and 
muflin manufactures, feveral ftrangers, of late, have fettled 
in the town. What effects thefe, in time, may have, on the 
morals of the people, cannot as yet be faid. Though the only 
civil officer in the place be a conftable^ there are fewer riots 
committed, than in moft other places equally populous and 
extenfive. It is now upwards of 22 years fince the prefent 
incumbent was ordained, during which time no inhabitant of 
the parifh has been banifhed, or fuffered a capital punifhment.

NUMBER XI, 

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1011363">COMRIE</name>. 

(County of Perth — Prejbytery of Auchterarder — Synod of 

Perth and Stirling.} 

Drawn up by the Rev. Mr. Colin Baxter, Minijier of Mo~ 
nivaird, from Materials chiefly colleBed by the Rev. Mr. 
Hugh M'Diarmeb, Minijier of Comrie.</head> 



<p>Origin of the Name. 

THIS parifh take3 its name from the village of Comrie, 
in which the church Hands. Comrie is derived from 
the Gaelic, Comh-ruidh, which lignifies the confluence of two 
rivers. Thefe are the Erne, and the Rucbil, which join their 
ftreams a few yards to the weflward of the church, and flow in 
one body, till they fall into the Tay. There is another pa- 
lifli, called Tullichetil, united to Comrie. The foundation of 
the church, which is ftill vifible, is furrounded by a pretty 
large church-yard, and is diftant from the village of Comrie 
about a Scotch mile. Tullichetil, in allufion to the dead 
buried there, fignifies in Gaelic, the plain of Jlecp. 

Extent The extent of this parifli is very confiderable, 

being about 13 miles long, and between 9 and 10 broad. It

fionfifts of the ftrath, or flat ground, from Comrie to Locherne- 
head, and of 4 glens ; 2 of them large, Glenairttuy and Glen, 
kdnaig ; and two fmall, Finnigkn and Glentearkin. The 
figure of the parifh is irregular. 

Situation, Soil, aud Surface — It is fituated in the county of 
Perth, and is the weftern boundary of Stratherne. The foil, 
in general, in the low grounds, is light and gravelly, and full 
of fmall ftones. In fome farms, efpecially in the glens, it is 
deeper and rather fivampy. On the fides of the glens, and of 
the ftrath, to the E. end of Locherne, and of the loch itfelf, 
there is a continued chain of hills. Thefe hills, which com- 
prehend by far the greateft part of the parifh, confift moftly 
of ftieep farms. In the higher parts of the glens, there is 
little encouragement to plow and fow, as the crops are al- 
ways late, and often deftroyed by the fro ft and rains. 

Climate and Difeafes — The air, in general, is very pure and 
healthy ; but the climate in the ftrath differs confiderably 
from that in the hilly part of the parifh. In the glens, there 
is a great deal of rain : In the ftrath, which is pretty broad 
near the village, they feldom think they have too much. Be- 
fore the goats were banifhed from the country, this parifh was 
much reforted to by invalids, from Edinburgh and Glafgow, 
for the recovery of their health. Moft of the inhabitants live 
to a good old age. There are among them, at prefenf, 8 men 
and 9 women between 80 and 90 years old, and a great num- 
ber between 70 and 80. Colds and rheumatifms are the moft 
common complaints. A few have of late been attacked by bilious 
diforders, efpecially in fummer and harveft. Colics too have 
ibmetimes proved fatal, particularly (it is remarked) to thofe 
of the name of Fergujfon. The fmall pox were formerly very 

^rudtive; but, about 7 years ago, the people were prevail-

ed upon to allow their children to be inoculated , and ever 
fiace the pradice has been general, and very fucceisful. 

Rivers and Laics The 'principal rivers are the Erne and 

the Ruchil. The Erne iffues from the lake of that name, 

Comrie. Ruchil figni- 
fies, in Gaelic, the red flood ; and it is fo called, from the red^ 
nefs of its waters, when fwelled with rains. It takes its rife 
among the high hills at the head of Glenairtney ; is a fine 
fifhing ftream, and remarkable for the great numbers of fea 
trouts which are to be found in it. Thefe rivers, and the 
Lednaig, the third largeft in the parifh, abound -with burn 
trouts j but there are few falmon in any of them, except 
during the fpawning feafon — Loch Erne is about 8 miles long, 
and i broad. It is called Erne, in Gaelic Erinn, from its 
wefterly fituation. Its banks, for above j miles on both 
fides, are covered with natural oak wood, of great extent and 
value. The road from CriefF, through the parifhes of Moni- 
vaird and Comrie, to Loch-Erne head, prefents a great va- 
riety of natural beautiful objects, and is perhaps not inferior 
to any of the fame extent in the Highlands of Scotland. 
Loch-Erne is not diftinguiflied as a fifhing lake. It is faid, 
that it never freezes. Near each end of it, there is a fmall 
ifland, evidently artificial, on which the remains of a caftle 
are ftill viiible. There are only 2 other fmall lakes in the 
parifh j the one above Dunira, the other m the braes of Glen- 
lednaig, both of which fwarm with trouts about the fize of 
herrings. 

Hills, Woods, and Springs. — This parifh has many high 
hills in it ; but the higheft, not only here, but in all Strath- 
erne, is Benvurlich, that is, the mountain of the great lake : 
And Loch-Erne is certainly great, when compared with the 

other 



of Conine, 181 

ether lakes in Stratherne. In a clear day, this mountain is 
diftinctly fees from Perth, from the Caftle.hill of Edinburgh, 
and from a rifing ground at Loudon Caftle, in Ayrfhire. Its 
elevation above the level of the fea is about 3,200 feet. Be- 
fides the oaks on each fide of Loch-Erne, above mentioned, 
there is ajfo an extenfive and valuable oak wood on the eftates 
of Dunira, Tullibannachar, Comrie, and Aherruchil. A great 
variety of other trees, particularly of the fir fpecies, have alio 
been planted of late, in feveral parts of the parilh, and are 
in a very thriving condition.— The only remarkable i'pring 
here is that of St, Fil/anf, the Popilh faiut of Breadalbane, 
at the W. end of Stratherne. 

Animals The number of fheep is about 16,500 ; of black 

cattle, 3,820 ; of horfes, 726 ; of deer, in the ibreft of Glen, 

airtney, 

* This fpring, tradition reports, reared its head on the top of Dun-FLaolain, 
(Fillan's Hill); for a long time doing much good; but in dijgujl, (probably at 
the Reformation ! J it removed fuddcnly to the foot of a rock, a quarter of a mile to 
the fouthward, where it Hill remains, humbled indeed, but not forfaken. It is 
ftill yiflted by valetudinary people, efpecially on the ift of May, and the ift of 
Auguft.. No fewer than 70 perfons vifited it in May and Auguft. 1 79 1. The in- 
valids, whether men, women, or children, walk, or are carried, round the well, 
three times, in a direction Deifhal, that is, from E. to W. according to the courfe 
of the Sun. They alfo drink of the water, and bathe in it. Thefe operations 
are accounted a certain remedy for various difeafes. They are particularly ef- 
ficacious for curning barrennefs ; on which account it is frequently vifited by 
thole who are very defirous of offspring. All the invalids throw a white Hone 
on the faint's cairn, and leave behind, as tokens of their confidence and grati- 
tude, fome rags of linen or woollen cloth. The rock 011 the fummit of the hill, 
formed, of itfdf a chair for the faint, which ftill remains. Thofe who complain 
of rh'eumatifm in the back, muft afcend the hill, fit in this chair, then lie down 
on their back, and be pulled by the legs to the bottom of the hill. This opera- 
tion is ftill performed, and reckoned very efficacious. At the foot of the hill, 
there is a bafon, made by the faint, on the top of a large flone, which ftldom 
wants water, even in the greateft. drought : And all who are diftreffed with 
fore eyes muft walh them three times with this water.

airtnej, between 200 and 300 ; of goats, about 100. The 
iheep are of the black faced kind, and on moft of the farms 
'are every year improving. The fmall Highland breed, 
vnce very numerous here, is now almoft entirely banifhed. 
The hill horfes too, to make room for the fheep, are reduced 
to a very fmall number. The fmeared or tarry wool, is fold 
at from 4s. to 5s. per ftone -, the white wool at 7s. 6d.— There 
are in the parifh hares, rabbits, foxes, martins, partridges, 
groufe, and a few ptarmigans and heath fowl. 

Produce, i$c — The principal crops are oats and bear. Potatoes 
are planted every where in great quantities, and, with milk, 
eonftitute the principal part of the food of the lower claffes, 
•for 8 months of the year. A good deal of meal is bought 
from the neighbouring parifhes of Monivaird, Crieff and Mu- 
thil. Thofe parifhes alfo fupply our fmall whifky flills with 
about 1200 bolls of barley yearly. 

Manufatlures — Our ttaple manufacture is linen yarn, of 
which a great quantity is fpun and fold every year. With the 
money which this yarn brings, moft of the farmers pay a great 
part of their rents. This yarn fells at about 2s. 4d. per 
fpindle. From the tow of the lint they fpin harn yarn, which 
is made into cloth, that brings from gd. to is. per yard. 
The finer fort is ufed for men and women's fhirts ; the coarfer 
for failors jackets and troufers. The women make alfo a great 
quantity of plaid en cloth, which is fold at from iod. to is. 
per yard ; and a confiderable quantity of tartan, of which 
they make plaids and hofe. Thefe are partly for home ufe, 
,and partly for the market. 

Prices of Labour. — The wages of fervants and labourers 
have rifen very much within thefe 10 years. Day labourers 

get 



of Comric. l8j 

get from iod. to is. in fummer, and from 71. to pd. in win- 
ter, when their provifions are not allowed them. When they 
take work by the piece, and are employed in making roads, 
in ditching, building Hone fences, quarrying lime-Hone and 
flates, they often earn from is. to is. 6d. per day. The men 
fervants receive from the farmers, from 5I. to 10I. a yearj 
The women fervants from 2I. 10s. to 3I. 10s. 

Union of Farms. l$c About a third part of this parifli 

once belonged to the family of Perth ; and when their eftate 
was'forfeited, and put under the management of commiffioners-, 
feveral farms, formerly poflefled by many tenants, were given 
to one perfon. This leffened the number of inhabitants con- 
fiderably. The village indeed has increafed very much of 
late ; but, by comparing what the large farms have loft of 
tenants and cottagers, with what the village has gained, the 
population does not appear to be on the increafe. A great 
part of the village is inclofed, efpecially what belongs to 
Mr. Drummond of Perth; and fome of the farms are 
fubdivided. 

Rents and Proprietors. — The farms on the Perth eftate are 
allowed by all to be low rented ; and they are certainly fa, 
when compared with the reft of the country, The higheft 
grafs farm pays about 200L : The reft are from 80I. down to 
5I. In the neighbourhood of the village, the land lets at from 
il. to' il. 12I. per acre. — The valued rent of the parifli is 
4133I. 6*s. 8d. Scotch : The real rent, though many of the 
beft farms are let very low, is about 2670I. Sterling. One 
cutting of the oak woods in the parifh will yield about 
13,0001. There are 10 greater, and 6 fmaller proprietors.

imaller heritors refide conftantly. 

Population.— The population of this parifh is not thought 
to be mcreafing, although, within thefe 40 years, it has aug- 
mented confiderably. The number of inhabitants, of all ages , 
amounts to about 

- • 3000 
The return to Dr. Webfter, in 1755, was only - 2J4 6 

Hence there is evidently an increafe of - 

When the number of arable acres, the infant fate of trade 
and manufaftures, with thefcarcity and high price of fuel, are 
considered, this part of Stratherne is fufficiently populous. 
Many boys and girls are employed as herds, and many young 
men and women, as fervants, every year, in the neighbouring 
Lowland parifhes. Were a coarfe woollen manufactory etta- 
bhflaed at Comrie, it would meet with encouragement, do 
much good, and employ many half idle hands. For 8 years 
part, none have emigrated from the parifli, but 6 cottagers, with 
their families, to Blair-Drummond Mofs, in Monteith. 

Ecclefiaftical State.— The prefent incumbent, Mr. HUGfi 
M'Diarmed was admitted minifter of Comrie in July 1781. 
The church is old, too fmall, and not in very good repair. 
There is another church, 4 miles weft from the village, in 
which divine fervice is performed, almoft wholly in Gaelic, 
every fourth Sunday. The manfe and offices were built in 
1784. The glebe confifts of near 9 acres, 6 of which are pretty 
good ; the others are very poor. The ftipend is, in money, 
52I. 2s. 3d. ; and, in grain, 16 bolls of meal, and 8 bolls of 
bear ; in all, about 69I. ; and in this fum is included what is 
allowed for communion elements. There is a fmall meeting 
of Antiburgher Seceders in the village j and there are 6 Pa- 

pifts 



of Comrie. 185 

pifts, who attend the Roman Catholic chapel in the neigh- 
Louring parifti of Muthil, in which, as well as in Crieff, 
many of thern refide. 

Schools.— Befides the parochial fchool, at which are taught 
from 70 to 100 fcholars, fhere are 3 others, fupported by the 
Society for propagating Chriftian Knowledge ; one of which 
has often, during the winter feafon, 100 ; the other 2 from 
30 to 60 fcholars. In the remote parts of the parifti, there 
are 2 or 3 fma.ll fchools, fupported by the tenants, whofe 
children derive benefit from them.' 

Poor. — The number of poor on the parifti roll i9 12. Some 
of thefe receive a weekly, and fome only an occafional fup- 
ply. The weekly penfioners receive 6d. or is. ; the occa- 
fional ones 2s. or 3s. three or four times in the year ; and, at 
Martinmas and Candlemas, even the weekly penfioners receive 
2s. or 2s. 6d. each. The annual fum expended for their re- 
lief is about 40I. This fum is produced by the colleftions 
in the church, by proclamations, and mortcloth dues,- by fines 
for irregular marriages, and other trefpaffes, and the intereft 
of iool. The poor are permitted to beg in the parifti. Some 
poor houfe. keepers beg for corn in fpring ; and many popr 
houfe- wives beg for wool in fummer. 

Roads and Bridges. — There is one great road through the 
parifti, leading from Crieff to Loch-Erne head} and feveral 
fmaller roads through the glens. Between Crieff and Loch- 
Erne there are 5 ftone bridges acrofs the river Erne, 3 of 
which confift of 4 arches. There are befides feveral ftone and 
wooden bridges on the Ruchil, the Lednaig, &amp;c. The roads 
in this and the neighbouring pari flies were formerly made by 
the ftatute labour ; but this was lately converted into money. 

V0L ' XI - A a Tenants, 



*86 Statiftical Account 

Tenants, who pcflefs farms of 30L yearly rent, pay from 9s*. 
to 14s. All above and below this fum pay in proportion. 
Cottagers, villagers and tradefmen, pay 2s. or is. 6d. each. 
The converfion money is very well laid out ; but the inha- 
bitants of the glens complain of late that too much is expend- 
ed on the great road. The fum colle&amp;ed is infufEcient for 
keeping all the roads in proper repair, as they are very nu- 
merous, and liable to be hurt by the mountain torrents. 

CharaBer and Language. — Like the generality of the com- 
mon Highlanders, the lower ranks here are modeft, peaceable, 
and very obliging. There are few law-fuiis among them ; 
and there have been none for thele 10 years, except about 
legacies, multures, and marches. They are frugal, moderate, 
and induftrious; and, except at merry meetings, are not much 
addifted to drinking. — The common language of the people 
is Gaelic. All the natives underftand it; but many, efpecially 
of the old, do not underftand Englifti well. All the young 
people can fpeak Englifti ; but, in order to acquire it, they 
mull go to fervice in the Low Country. The Gaelic is not 
fpoken in its purity,, neither here nor in any of the bordering 
parifties. 

Advantages and Difadvantages. — This parifti having good 
roads, particularly on the E. and W., has a fafe and eafy 
communication both with the Low Country and the High- 
lands. The traders, in the village, traffic much with the people 
of Balquhidder and Killin. Thefe they ferve with oat-meal, 
barley-meal, and whifky ; and get in return flax, linen yarn, 
and wools There is a good flate quarry near the foreft of 
Glenaircney. It is the only one in this part of the country. 
There is likewife an excellent lime quarry, at the W. end of 
the parifii, very near the ftde of Loch-Erne, which has beea 

the- 



of Comr'ie, 187 

•tke means of improving a great part of the land, in this and 
the neighbouring parifh of Monivaird. The raw lime-fW 
is brought in a large boat to the E. end of the loch, and there 
fold, burnt or unburnt, as purchafers incline.— The greateft 
difadvantage, under which many parts of the parifh labour, is 
the fcarcity and high price of fuel. White timber, or peeled 
oak, once plentiful and cheap, is now fcarce and dear. Peats, 
at beft a troublefome and expenfive, though the mod common 
fuel, are diftant from the village, and moil of the farms, 1 or 
3 miles. The neareft good coal lies at the diftance of 25 
miles from the village. Were the ftiort road made acrofs the 
hills to the fouthward of Comrie, which is earneftly longed for, 
coals will become cheaper and more plentiful. This road 
will leffen the diftance very confiderably, and, when procured, 
will tend much to advance the happinefs and profperity of this 
part of the country. 

Antiquities In 3 different places in the parifhes, there are 

to be feen the remains of fmall Druidical temples*. The 
greateft piece of antiquity here is the Roman camp on the 
plain of Dalgincrofs, in the neighbourhood of Comrie. On 
this plain are ftill vifible very diftinft remains of two camps, 
with only an inconfiderable diftance between them, and joined 
by an agger f.

* The ftones of one of thefe near the village were broken to pieces, about 10 
ysars ago, and ufed in building one of the new houfes : And it has been remark- 
ed, by fome lovers of antiquity, that thofe who were guilty of this aft of facrilege 
never profpered afterwards. 

* Mr. Gordon, in his Itinerarium Septentrionalt, publifhed in 1726, (hews 
this to have been the plain, on which the battle was fought between Aoricola. 
and Galgacus. One of the camps is 40a paces long, and 391 broad. The 
?ther is now confiderably diminiflicd by the encroachments of the RuchiL

Earthquakes — This parifh, and the neighbourhood, have, 
for more than 3 years paft, been not a little alarmed by 
feveral fmart ftiocks of an earthquake. It was firft felt, 
or rather loud noifes, unaccompanied with any concuffion, 
were heard by the inhabitants of Glenlednaig, during autumn 
1789. Thefe noifes were firft fuppofed to be peals of thun- 
der y afterwards, as they were heard fometimes when the iky 
was quite clear, the people imagined they were occafioned by 
the firing of the carronades at Dunira. Finding, however, on 
inquiry, that they did not proceed from this caufe, they were 
at a lofs how to account for them, till the 5th of November 
1789, when, about 6 o'clock in the evening, they were alarm- 
ed by a loud rumbling noife, accompanied with a fevere fhock 
of an earthquake. This fhock, which is generally fuppofed to 
be the mod violent of any that has happened here, was very 
fenfibly felt over a traft of country of more than 20 miles in 
extent. Since that period the ftiocks have been very frequent, 
and at times pretty violent ; but hitherto they have done no 
harm. Within thefe 3 or 4 weeks, fince the weather has 
fettled into drought, they have ceafed altogether. The cen- 
tre of the earthquake is, as nearly as can be gueffed, about 
the mouth of Glenlednaig, a mile or two north from the vil-. 
lage of Comrie. What fupports this conjecture is, that the 
people who live on the E. fide of the glen, feel the earth- 
quake begin in the N. W., and proceed in a fouth-eafterly 
direction : Thofe again who inhabit the country on the W„ 
fide of it, think it takes its rife in the N. E., and expires in, 
the W. "

UNITED PARISHES OF <name ref="NA">FORBES AND 

KEARN</name>. 

(Prejhytery of Alford— County and Synod of Aberdeen.) 
fiy the Rev. Mr. Benjamin Mercer, Minifitr of the Parifh.</head> 



<p>Origin of the Names. 

THE ancient name of the parifh of Forbes is totally un- 
known. The parifh feems to derive its preient appel- 
lation from the noble family of Forbes, who have been pro- 
prietors of it for feveral centuries paft. Kearn has its name 
from a cairn in the parifh ; which feems to have been, in an- 
cient times, an extenfive dry fortification ; but when, or by 
xvhom ere&amp;ed, tradition itfelf pretends not to fay. 

Situation and Extent, Sic. — Thefe parifheb are diflant from 
Aberdeen about 22 miles, fouth-wefterly ; their length, from 
N. W. to S.E., is about 5£ miles; their breadth 2. They meet 
in a point, in the middle of a ridge of mountains, which ex- 
tend xo or 12 miles from the chapel of Garrioch, on the 
N. E., to Auchendoir and Kildrummy on the S. W. Thefe 
mountains have various appellations, according to their dif- 
ferent 



v 9° Statiflical Account 

ferent fixations. That part of them which feparates Forbes 
and Kear,, and which is about 5 miles over, is called Careen, 
■which, they, who are acquainted with the Gaelic, fay, unifies 
*he mil of the Muirfowh and with which, indeed, it pretty 
much abounds. On the S. E. fide of this mountain, and on 
a gentle declivity, extending about 2 miles along the banks tf 
the river Don, lies the parifh of Forbes. It contains, by a 
iate meafurement, 4075 acres ; of which there are,

— Kearn lies on the N. W. fide of the faid mountain, on a 
very eafy declivity to the river Bogie. As the meafurement 
of this parifh never happened to come into the hands of the 
author hereof, he cannot afcertain its extent with precifion j 
ijut it is fuppofed to contain 2716 acres, of which there may 
fce about 600 under tillage, the reft in paftu.re, mofs and muir. 

Soil and Produ&amp;ions, \Bc — The foil throughout the whole 
diftrict is naturally light and dry. This quality renders k 
favourable for early harvefts. The crop, however, in dry 
feafons, is generally thin and fhort ; but, when refreshed with 
frequent fhowers of rain, it becomes very weighty and luxu- 
riant, where the foil is in good heart. The principal produc- 
tions of this diflricl are oats and bear : Some tenants fow a few 
peafe, but to no great extent. All of them, however, fow a 
few turnips ; and plant fuch quantities of potatoes, greens 
and cabbages, as are fufficient for their own confumption. 
The diftricl fupplies itfelf with provifions, and fends a confi- 
4craile .quantity to market. 

Cultivation* 



of Forbes and KearTt. ig.% 

Cultivation.— The old mode of cultivation continues ; th« 
•Id Scotch plough, drawn by 8, io, and 12 oxen, and fome- 
with horfes and oxen together ; one crop of bear and 3 o£ 
com, after dunging the infield ; and 5 crops of corn on out- 
field, after lathing. The outfield lies other 5 years in natural 
grafs ; but the infield generally goes, on in the forefaid rota- 
tion. There is not an acre of land improved in this diftud,. 
excepting a few, which Mr. Grant of Driminner has improv- 
ed, in the farm which he has in his own hands ; all the reft 
lies in the fame ftatein which it was 30 years ago. 

Wood, Rivers and Fijh, \3c— There are no artificial planta- 
tions of timber in this diftrift. There is fome natural wood along 
the banks of the Don and the Bogie, confiding o£ aller, birch, 
and fome hagberry ; but of no great extent or value. — The 
river Don, which runs through a fmall part of the parifia o£ 
Forbes, and almoft bounds it on the S. E. and S., is a beau~ 
tiful limpid ftream, and abounds with fine burn trouts, fome o£ 
them 3 lb. and 4 lb. weight. Some falmon come up in the fpring, 
and are taken with the rod and fpear in fummer. It often 
overflows its banks, and, as its motion is rapid, it does great 
hurt to the crops in fummer, .and fometimes carries off great 
quantities of corn in autumn. The Bogie, which bounds Keara 
on the N. W. having its fource and part of its courfe in mofTy 
ground, is naturally black and muddy. It abounds, however, 
with fmall burn trouts ; but no falmon come up fo far as Keanu 
It frequently alfo overflows its banks ; but, as its motion is 
flow, it does little hurt to the corn fields, either in fummer ov 
autumn. There is another fmall ftream, called the Eflel, which 
divides Forbes from Tillinefsle, and which has 1 lint and 3 
corn mills on it. 



Mountains, — The hill of Correen, which feparates Forbes 

from 



1 9 2 Statiftical Account 

from Kearn, is covered with heath, mofs and turf. It makes 
an excellent Aieep-walk in fummer. As they ftroll in it night 
and day, they afford excellent mutton in the months of Sep- 
tember and October, in dry feafons. Its perpendicular height 
from the bed of the river Don, will be between 400 and 500 
yards. Immediately on the oppofite fide of the river, there is 
another mountain, nearly of the fame height, called Calwar; 
at the foot of which there is one farm belonging to the parilh 
cf Forbes: That part of the hill which belongs to this farm, m 
covered with heath, and makes a good fheep-walk. 

Fuel. — Peats and turf are the only fuel made ufe of in this 
diftria, which the hill of Correen affords in great plenty, and 
of the beft quality. The tenant, however, cannot accommo- 
date his family with fo neceffary an article, but at a very 
high expence yearly. For befides the expence of calling up 
peats and turf, the whole fummer quarter is fpent in drying 
and bringing them home ; and if to this be added the Ms of 
the fummer feafon, for preparing dung for the land, it will be 
impoffible to calculate the damages, either to the tenant as an 
individual, or to the public at large. Heath is generally made 
ufe of for drying com for the mill, as well as for houfe ufe. 
No coal is ufed in this diftrift but for fmithy work. 

Manure. — Animal dung (mixed with earth and peat alhes), 
is the only manure ufed in the diftridt. Although there be a 
lime-ftone quarry in the hill of Gorreen, of a very fine qua- 
lity, and plenty of peats and turf to burn it, no perfevering 
attempt has yet been made to bring it to a proper bearing. 
The heritors are carelefs and remifs, and the tenants have nei- 
ther abilities nor encouragement to work it. 

Climate 



of Forbes, and Kearn. 193 

Climate and Difeafes—The air is dry, clear, and healthful ; 
and as the country in general is mountainous, it has a fine 
circulation at all feafons, though often very {harp and cold. 
The difeai'es incident to the people of this diftrift, and of the 
couutry in general, are various : lingering fevers, of the nerv- 
ous kind, few inflammatory ; gout, rheumatifm, jaundice, 
fcrophula, fcurvy, gravel and ftone, fmall-pox, meafles, hoop- 
ing cough, Sec. Inftances of all thefe are frequently to be 
met with among the people. Some children are loft by the 
fmall-pox, meafles and hooping cough. But as the people, 
in a great meafure, have got over their prejudices againft ino- 
culation, very few now die in the fmall-pox. But of all the 
difcafes that prevail in 'this country, the fcurvy is the moft 
epidemical, and may juftly be called the bane and fcourge of 
human nature. This diftemper may primarily be contracted 
from various caufes ; idle indolent habits, unwholefome food, 
impure air, the want of attention to cleanlinefs, a fedentary 
life, &amp;c. may occafion it. Sedentary employmants are evi- 
dently nourifhers of this, as well as of all other putrid dif^ 
orders ; and when any putrid diforder gets hold of the human 
conftitution, it is not eafily expelled, and of confequence be- 
comes hereditary, and is handed down to pofterity with all 
its woeful increafing force. This in reality is but too much 
the cafe with the fcurvy among the people of this country. 
When this diftemper is cutaneous, its effeds are often dread- 
ful ; but 9 out of 10 have it latent in the body, and then its 
effeds are baneful indeed ! It falls upon the fofter and warmer 
parts of the body, mixes itfelf intimately with the circulation 
of the blood, corrupts it, weakens and enfeebles all parts of 
the frame, and corrodes the lungs, ftamach and inteftines ; 
hence foetid breath, perfpiration and ftool ; coftive habits, ob- 
ftruftions of the menfes ; various pains throughout the body ; 
coughs and difficulty of breathing ; fore eyes and throats ; 
Y0L ' XL B b ftitcheSj

flitches; headnchs fwellings and boils, now and then, on 
various parts of the body ; laffitudes and melancholy habits, 
&amp;c. All thefe, and many more that will not bear defcription, 
are the difmal effects of this dreadful fcourge, and are all 
feverely felt from time to time among the people at large „ 
and premature death is often the confequence; feveral inftances 
of which could be given in this, and in other neighbouring 
diftrids, within thefe 10 years pail. It is dreadful to think 
in how many ways this ihocking diftemper preys on the hu- 
man frame, and often renders the unhappy fufferer a nuifance 
to himfelf and to fociety. Befides, the nature of this, as well 
as of all other putrid diftempers, is extremely infectious : 
The clothes fcorbutic perfons wear and fleep in, and the air 
they breath, will convey infenfibly the contagion to a clean 
perfon ; and they who fleep with them muft foon feel the 
woeful coufequences*. It is a pity that no fpecific has yet been 
found fufficient, to eradicate this growing evil, or at lead to 
counteract its malignant force. Nothing, perhaps, would be 
more worthy the attention of government, than to offer pre- 
miums for the moft effectual fpecifics againft fo deftructive a 
diftemper ; the confequence might be, the hardy foldier, and 
the healthy fubject. 

Population, 

* Of the truth of the above remarks, there is a melancholy inflance in this 
parifh, of a perfon, who, after having enjoyed the beft ftate of health for the 
ipace of 48 years of his age, unfortunacely, by fleeping with a perfon deeply 
tinctured with this diftemper, in a fmall clofe room, caught the infection, and, 
for 10 years paft, has experienced all its dreadful effects ; and indeed, for three 
of thefe years, has been rendered incapable, in a great meafure, of attending to 
any bufinefs ; and, after laying out, of a fmall income, a confiderable fum of mo- 
ney, on doctors, medicines, goat's whey, &amp;c endeavouring to get clear of the 
diftemper, he has little other hopes left, than to fpin out the remainder of his 
days in the fame woeful fituation, and to wait for purification in the grave. 
This ought to be a warning to every individual in health, to beware with whom 
they affociate, left they meet with the fame fatal coufequences.

Church and SchooL-Kt what time the churches of Forbes 
and Kearn were built, no perfon living knows. They are at 
prefent in bad repair ; and, at the death of the prefent incum- 
bent, the panfhes are to be annexed to Auchendoir and Til- 
lmefsle. The manfe was built about 70 years ago, and has 
got many partial repairs fince, but is (till a mean habitation. 
The fbpend is afil. Sterling, including 4 1. Scotch for com- 
munion elements, and 3 chalders of victual, together with a 
glebe of about 8 acres, grafs included. The tithes are faid 
to be valued and exhaufted. Lord Forbes lately was, but 
now Lord Fife is, patrou. There never has been any legal 
fchool in this diftria ; only fome of the minifters either kept 
a fchool themfelves, or kept a boy for educating their own 
children, and admitted the children in the neighbourhood to 
partake of the benefit. The prefent incumbent applied for a 
fchool 4 years ago; but the application was unfuccefsful. 

Poor.— Before the year 1782, the funds for the poor were 
only about 30I. Sterling, befides the ordinary collections, which 
fcarcely amount to 2I. Sterling per annum. But in 1782-3 
the faid funds were totally exhaufted ; and therefore no pen- 
lions can be bellowed on any, but only fome afliftance given 
where it is abfolutely necefiary. No poor's rates have yet 
taken place in this country. In the years 1782 and 1783, by 
the activity of the feffion, partly by the forefaid funds, and 
partly by the government's gratuity, together with the ufe of 
private money, the poor in this diftria were equally well fup- 

plied 



of Forbes and Kedrn. 1 97 

plied with any in the neighbourhood. But the heritors nei- 
ther took any concern, nor expended a fingle {lulling for their 
relief. 

Heritors, Rents, and Roads.— There are 3 heritors in this 
diftria, only 1 of whom refides. The valued rent is 1166I. 
Scotch ; the prefent rent, reckoning the vidua! paid to the 
heritors at lis. Sterling per boll, is 652I. Sterling. The roads 
in this diftria are made and repaired by the ftatute labour on- 
ly ; and, of confequence, they are in a moft wretched ftate, 
being fcarcely pa ffable in the winter feafon. 

Antiquities. — There are no antiquities in this diftria worth 
mentioning, excepting fome Druidical places of worfhip, and 
a few trifling tumuli, which feem to have been burial places 
in the times of heathenifm. None of them have yet been, 
opened. Driminner, the ancient feat of the family of Forbes, 
is the only caftle and gentleman's feat in the diftria. It feems 
to have been built about the middle of the 16th century ; the 
oldeft date is 1577- 

Characier. — That the people in this diftria are fatisfied 
with their prefent fituation, cannot with propriety be faid ; 
their rents being triple and quadruple what they formerly 
were, their lands ftill unimproved, their leafes fhort, their flock 
exhaufted in the years 1782 and 1783, befides the high rates 
of fervants fees. All thefe, as well as other circumftances that 
could be mentioned, keep them ftill in pinching poverty, in 
fpite of their utmoft induftry. They are, in ftature, about 
the middle fiz,e, and, in general, of a fomewhat fwarthy com- 
plexion. As to their manner of life, they are induftrious, 
fober, regular attendants on public worlliip and other ordinances 
of the gofpel ; charitable, and of an obliging temper and dif- 
pofition. There are no feaaries among them.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q24993844">CAMERON</name>. 

(Prejbytery of St. Andrews—Synod and County of Fife.) 
By the Rev. Mr. John Mair, Minijler.</head> 



<p>EreBion, Situation, and Extent. 

THIS parifh was disjoined from St. Andrews about 160 
years ago. The church and manfe lie almoft in the centre, 
about 3 computed miles S. W. from the city of St. Andrews. 
Its extent, from N. to S., is 3 computed miles'; and 4 from 
E. to W. ; but, from N. E. to S. W., and from N. W. to 
S. E., 4 computed miles each way. 

Cultivation, Minerals, Soil, %3c. — About 30 years before 
the disjunction, there was plenty of game ; and long after that 
period, even no farther back than 60 years ago, almoft all eaft- 
ward from the church, there was one continued tract of heath ; 
but atprefent nothing of that kind is to be feen, excepting upon 
the lands of Lathocker, belonging to Mifs Scott, who, it is 
to be hoped, when Ihe arrives at majority, will give proper 
encouragement to cultivate that barren fpot. What has been

pf Angular fervice in making fuch an alteration is the lime-Hone 
and coal, with which this parrfli abounds. The foil differs 
very much through the whole parifli ; and though fome very- 
good grain is produced, (efpecially on the farms to the north- 
ward of the church), yet, in general, it is better adapted for 
pafturage. The proprietors are fo fenfible of this, that more 
than one half of the parifli, which was all open fields 30 years 
ago, is now inclofed ; and fimilar improvements are daily- 
making upon the reft of it. 

Farm Rents, Prices of Labour, %3c — Rents are considerably 
raifed within thefe 30 years. All the farms, of which leafes 
have been lately granted, produce to the proprietor double, 
and fome of them triple, of what they did formerly. The price 
of labbur, in fome meafure, keeps pace with the rents. Tailors, 
whofe wages were no more than 4d. per day, demand iod. ; 
mafonsjwhoufedtoworkfor a merk, (13s. 4d. Scotch), look for 
is. 8d. Ster.; day labourers cannot be got under is. ; common 
ploughmen have raifed their wages, from 40s. and a pair of 
fhoes, to 5I. Sterling ; and they who fow and bigg t expect, 7 
guineas. Women fervants, who ufed to be fatisfied with 20s. 
in the year, will not now engage under 2I. 10s, at the loweft, 
and few can be got under 3I. The article of coals is very much 
advanced in price within thefe 40 years : A cart load at the 
hill coft only is. 4d. ; but now, for the fame quantity, 3s., 
and fometimes 3s. 6d. is paid. Indeed, it muft be owned, 
that the expence of working coal is greatly increased. Two 
fire engines are employed for that purpofe, in this parifh, by 
Mr. Durham of Largo, and the coal-hewers receive more 
wages. Adjacent to one of thefe fire engines, he has lately 
eredted a number of houfes to accommodate the workmen. 



Population. 



StatWcal 'Account 

Population.-Tho^ this be a new village, the number of 
inhabitants in the parifli has increafed very little within thefe 
13 years, and has decreafed confiderably within thefe 4 oyears,

The above decreafe is to be attributed to the many inclo- 
fures which have taken place, which naturally operate in di- 
miniihing the neceffity of having a number of fervants. 

Climate and Longevity — There is no difeafe peculiar to this 
pariih ; and when any become epidemical in the neighbour- 
hood, they feldom find their way fo high as to reach this, ex- 
cepting the fmall-pox and the meafles, which the ftraggling 
poor fometimes introduce. The climate is remarkably healthy ; 
and as an evidence of this, fix perfons, within thefe 40 
years, were all alive about the fame time, aged upwards of 
50. At prefent, a few can reckon 80 years ; and the mini- 
iler himfelf (who writes this narrative) is 71 complete, and v 
has been 41 years in the parifli, having been ordained in March 



Church — The ftipend is made up by 10 bolls and 3 firlots 
of bear ; 29 bolls, 2 firlots and 6 lippics of fujficient oats, (the 

exprelfion 



of Cameron, 20 1 

«xpreffion in the decreet of locality), and by 98 bolls 2 firlots 
of black oats, at half price, with tfjU. 13s 4i- Scotch, as 
the parfonage tithes, and the vicarage or St- Andrews and 
C imeron panfhcs ; the colleding of which is both expenfwe 
and troublefome, being paid by no perfons, and fome of the 
articles not exceeding one penny and three farthings ; a very 
triaing income ! Indeed, under the denomination of commu- 
nion elements, one particular farm is faddled with 12 bolls 
and 2 firlots of black oats, at half price ; and there is a fufhV 
ciency of unexhaufted tithes to anfwer a Tolerable augmen- 
tation, which will certainly be obtained, whenever an incum* 
tent fhall purfue for it. 

Rent, School, and Poor — The valued rent is S859I. 7s. lod. 
Scotch, and yet affords no more than 100 merks of falary to 
the fchoolmafter.— The minifter and elders have hitherto main- 
tained the poor by the weekly colie&amp;ions in the church, and 
the emoluments arifing from the mort-cloth.

NUMBER XIV. 
PARISH OF <name ref="NA">KILMARONOCK</name>. 

{County and Prefbytety of Dumbarton — Synod of Glafgm 

and Ayr. 

By the Rev. Mr. Andrew White, Mincer.</head> 



<p>Name, Eretfion, and Extent, 

|T* ILMARONOCK fignifies the cell, chapel, or burying- 
-X^. place of St. Maronoch, or St. Marnoch. About the 
middle of laft century, a confiderable part of the parifh was 
disjoined from Kilmaronock, and annexed to Bonhill. Its pre~ 
lent extent is about 5 miles in length, and from 2 to 4 miles 
in breadth. From the Dumbarton moors, the ground has in 
general a gentle declivity towards the north. 

River, Laie  Hi/Is, and Soil. — The windings of he river 
Endrici, through a plain of more than 3000 acres, the Houfe, 
of Buchanan fituated in the middle of the plain, with the ex- 
tenfive lawns and forefts belonging to the Duke of Montrofe, 
prefent to the traveller through this parifh a moil beautiful 
1'and.fcape. Lochlomond, with its numerous iflands and va- 
xiegated backs, the fiurrouBdiwg hills, and towering moun- 

ns s 



hf Kihnaronoch 203 

tains, with the cloud-capt Benlomond, combine to render the 
fcenery very pidurefque.— On the banks of the Endrick, the 
foil is a deep rich loam, very favourable for p aft u rage or til- 
lage ; on the rifing ground above the plain, the foil is in ge- 
neral a cold wet till ; and, towards the moors, of a moffy 
quality. 

Agriculture That there are feldom inftances of good hus- 
bandry on fmall farms, except on foils of the greater! fertility, 
or where there is a command of manure, is a maxim which is 
verified in this parifh. Many of the farms are fo fmall, as to 
yield but a fcanty fubfiftence to the farmer ; and as no lime 
or ftimulating manures can be got but at a high price, little 
attention is paid to the melioration of foil, or rotation of crops. 
From the price of labour and manure, compared with the be- 
nefit of rearing and fattening cattle, fome of the mod judicious 
farmers, in this parifh and neighbourhood, find their intereft in 
having their grounds in pafture father than tillage. But as 
agriculture is acknowledged to be the mod permanent bafis o£ 
the wealth of a country, it would certainly redound to the ho- 
nour and intereft of gentlemen, who are poffefled of large 
eftates, to exhibit a" pattern of improvement; or, if this is 
not found convenient, judicious and experienced farmers might 
be more encouraged, by letting leafes on one or more lives» 
rSuch a practice, it is evident, would be attended with the 
moft beneficial confequences ; at leaft^ it would certainly be 
preferable to the cuftom, of granting leafes of arable farm?' 
for nine, of even nineteen years ; where the farmer no fooner 
begins to improve, than he purfues ah oppofite fyftem, of ex- 
haufting his farm by too frequent cropping, from the idea 
that he may be turned out at the expiration of the leafe, and' 
tf ftranger who offers more rent preferred.

Mills and Multures. —There are three corn- mills in the pa« 
rifh 5 the greater! part of the lands are thirled, or aftricted to 
one or other of thefe mills. The multure, in general, after a 
deduction of feed and horfe-corn, amounts to about a twelfth 
part of the crop ; a fervitude not only highly oppreffive to 
the farmer, but which has a tendency to prevent emulatio* 
among the millers, in the execution of their bufinefs. 

fijheriesf—'tht Endrick abounds, at certain feafons, with 
falmons, pikes, trouts, perches, pars, &amp;c. There is an ex- 
cellent falmon fifhery in Lochlomond, neaF the place where 
the- Endrick difcharges into the lake. As the falmon are not 
now interrupted in their courfe up the Leven, as formerly, 
the fifheries, on the banks ot trie lake, are likely to turn out 
very profitable to the different proprietors. 

Population — The population of this pariih is on the de- 
cline, chiefly owing to the increife of trade and manufadures 
at Bonhill and Balfron, where many of the people have fet- 
tled. The return to Dr. Webtfer, in 1755. was - H93

No authentic account can be given of the births, as many of 
the people, and particularly the Diflenters, decline to have 
them inferted in the parifh regifler.

greater! part of them have but fmall properties: 32 are refi-

Scotch • The real rent cannot be, eafily afcertained, as a great 
part of the lands are in the hands of the proprietors. 

Church and Schools.-?** church has much the appear- 
ance of antiquity. The manfe was built in i 7J I, and fince 
that time it has been enlarged and repaired. The fbpend, by 
a late augmentation, brfides the glebe, is 6 chalders of meal, 
i chalder of bear, and 40I. 5* Stirling in money, including 
eommunion elements. Lord Stonefield is patron.— The pa- 
rochial Tchoolmafter has 100 merks falary. The number of 
fcholars is ufually about 40. His living is only about 15I. 
per annum. Befides the parochial fchool, there are generally 
other two. The fchoolmafter of one of them has 50 merks 
falary, befides fchool fees. If forue fuitable encouragement 
is not foon given to fchoolmafters, it is apprehended, that, 
in many places, the education of children will be totally 
aegledted. 

Prices of Labour, Fuel ^c— The wages of a good plough- 
man, for the year, befides board and lodging, are from 81. to 
ill. Sterling. Thofe of a woman fervant, for the year, be- 
fides board, are from 3I. to 4I. Sterling. The prices of pro- 
vifions are nearly the fame with the Glafgow and Dumbarton 
markets. — Peats are the common fuel. Coals are brought 
from Kilpatrick, a diflaBce of 12 or 14 miles. 

Roads.— The military road from Stirling to Dumbarton* 
after eroding the Endrick, by an excellent modem bridge, 
paffes, from E. to W., through the parifh. There is alfo an 
excellent turnpike road, which is now nearly completed, lead- 
ing from this place by Eafter Kilpatrick to Glafgow. 

Springs., 



2o6 Staiiflical Account 

Springs, Woods, and W-Ev«y field almoft abounds 
*nth pe^nnzal fprings, oozing from rocks of free-ftone. oi 
thefe St. Maronoch's Well is the moil famous. From the 
fpnngs collected, fmall rivulets run, interfering the grounds 
and render them very convenient for pafturage.-There are 
federal woods in the parim, the value of which has conGder- 
ably mcreafed within thefe fe W years. The woods on the 
banks of Lochlomond, belonging to Mifs Buchanan of Drum- 
kill, and John Buchanan, Efq. of Ardoch, abound with wood- 
cocks, in the beginning of winter—The moors, on the con- 
fines of the parifh, are much reforted to by the fportfmen, in 
the hunting feafon. There is a general complaint, that the 
birds are much fcarcer within thefe few years. This may 
fee partly accounted for from the increafe of the flock of fheep, 
and the fmall inducement the fhepherds have to preferve the' 
game. 

Antiquities.— There are the remains of 2 Romifli chapels. 
At Catter, now the property of the Duke of Montrose, 
there is a large artificial mound of earth, where, in ancient 
times, courts were held; near to which the Duke of Lennot 
had a place of refidence. There is not now the fmalleft vef- 
fige of the building. The caftles of Kilmaronock* and Bat- 
turret f, ho iv in ruins, appear to have been formerly very 
magnificent edifices. 

Mifcellaneous Ohfervatioris — There are no towns nor vil- 
lages in the pariih, nor any manufactures carried on. The

men are, in general, employed in hufbandry ; but, as the 
farms are fmall, they are not oppreffed with hard labour. 
The women are engaged in fpinning flax, or in work they 
receive from manufafturers. The people are grave and fober; 
but fome of them are rather difpofed to be litigious* .

* About the beginning of the prefent century, the parifh was much cxpofed 
to the depredation of certain freebooters, who carried off the cattle ; fo that the 
farmers, for their prote&amp;ion, engaged to pay them, or others, a certain tax, named 
flack meal, which was regularly cxa&amp;ed until 1745. when a better police was 
«ftablifhed.

<p>Form, Extent, and Soil. 

r TPHE form of this parifli is an irregular parallellogram. In 
length it is between 5 and 6 miles; in breadth between 
3 and 4, and in fome places more. The foil is various, ge- 
nerally a light fand, or deep black mould.

Situation, Climate and Difeafes — The parifli may be divid- 
ed into 2 diilr.cb. About two thirds of it lie in Strathmore, 
and the other furms the higher ground, which feems to ter- 
minate the ftrath on the N. In the former the climate is 
mildeft ; but the air is moft pure and healihy in the kiter, 
and fieeft from the logs. RIk umarifms, flow fevers, and 
fometimes agues prevail, efpecialiy in the neighbourhood of 
the mofiy and fw ampy ground.

Surface and Cultivation.—^ lower part of the parifli 
has" the appearance of being flat ; but in many places it is 
very unequal. About 26 years ago, it was almoft in a flate 
of nature, with fcarcely an cnclofure in it: Now, the greateft 
part is cultivated to a high degree, and about two thirds of 
it fubflantially enclofed, either with ftone dikes, ditch and 
hedge, or ditch and paling ; which fences, with the (tripes 
and clumps of planting, well dreffed fields, and handfome 
farm Headings, make a moft beautiful appearance.

Produce and Cattle, 13 c The common returns from the 

arable ground, in oats and bear, are from 4 to 6 bolls per 
acre; and of wheat from 8 to 10. There is but little hay 
made, the farmer finding his account rather in fattening cattle.* 
Of thefe there may be reared in a feafon about 500, and fat- 
tened on turnips from 180 to 200. There are about 400 more 
cattle in the parifli. The mode of culture is much the fame 
with what has been defcribed in other improved parifhes. 
Farmers, who pay from 150I. to 300I. of rent, poffefs about 
one half. There is one farmer indeed who pays more ; but 
he, with other two, does not refide. There js one threftiing 
machine in the parifli. There is only one flock of fheep. The 
ewes were brought from Northumberland about a year and 
a half ago, and thrive remarkably well. Their fleeces bring 
about 4s. each ; and, when fat, they weigh about 22 lb. per

but Airly Caftle will foon make another.— The valued rent is 
3310I. Scotch. The real rent is about 2850!. Sterling, in- 
cluding what arifes from mofs and marl. The farmer will 
bring for peats, the chief fuel of the lower clafs, near iool., 
and the latter about 300I. 

Church, School, and Poor — ; The church was rebuilt in 
1783, and the manfe in 1792. The living is 85 bolls 3 fir- 
lots I peck f lippie meal, and 43 bolls 3 firlots bear, with 
about 9I. of vicarage tithes, a glebe and garden. The Eani 
of Strathmore is patron.— The fchool mailer's falary and 

fchool fees amount to about 16I. or 17I The poor are fup- 

plied by the weekly collections, mortcloth money, and the 
interefl of about 130I. The number upon the roll, during 
the laft 10 years, has been from 4 to 9, befides many who

were expended in purcbafing meal for the moll neceffitous

Population The number of parifliioners has decreafed

Airly Castle. — Airly Caftle, which gave title to Ogilvy 
Earl of Airly, is fituated in the N. W. corner of the parifh, 
at the conflux of the Melgin aud Ida. It is built on a pro- 
montory, formed by thefe two rivers, and elevated above 
their bed more than 100 feet. It has been a very large and 
ftrong fortrefs, feemingly inacceflible on every fide but the 
South, on which it has beenfecured by a ditch and draw-bridge, 
more than 20, perhaps 30 feet wide, and a wall (the front of

it has remained a ruin ; but now an elegant modern houfe, 
built on the principal foundations of the caftle, is juft 
finilhing. 

Caftle of ^a/nV.—The caftle of Balrie, another ruin, fitu- 
ated in Strathmore, has been built upon a rifing ground, to- 
wards the W. end of the prefent mofs (formerly a large loch), 
containing about 120 acres, to the eaftward of the caftle, and 
6 or 8 to the weftward. The prefent proprietor, about 10 
years ago, dug up a part of the caufeway which led into the 
draw-bridge ; fo that there is little doubt of this place having 
been once very ftrong, and almoft impregnable. The walls, 
in general, are about 8 feet thick; but the houfe has been 
fmall, and rather intended for a place of refuge in times of 
danger, than the conftant refidence of a family f . 

Mofs of Balrie The mofs of Balrie was begun to be 

drained about 40 years ago, and has, at various intervals, un- 
dergone different degrees of draining ; the great object of 
which has no doubt been the immenfe quantity of fine lhell 
marl found in it, as' well as peats. The one has contributed

Marquis of Argyll in 1640 ; which was repaid in kind by the Marquis of Mont- 
rose and the royalifts, a few years after, when they burnt Mpckart and 
Dollar, and overthrew Lochow, Argyll's principal refidence. 

f The neighbouring lands, with the caftle, were the property of the laft Lord 
Vifcount Fenton, whofe eldeft daughter married into the family of Stratm- 
mor"e, and of which lands the Earl of Strathmore is ftill fuperior. It is faid to 
be more than 100 years fince any part of the roof of the caftle wasftanding.

as much to the improvement of the neighbouring country, as 
the other has to the comfort of the poor. Several thoufand 
bolls of marl are dug out of this mofs yearly, which in price 
has arifen, from 4 4d. to icd. per boll, 8 cubical feet being 
allowed to the boll. And there are Hill beds of marl in it 
16 feet perpendicular, by the boring iron, and the bottom not 
found; but impoffible to work out, without more water being 
taken off, which will be as difficult as expenfive*. Confider- 
able quantities of marl have likewife been found in the moffes 
of other proprietors. 

NUM. 

• Several very large deer's horri9 have been found in the Mofs of Balrie ; 
one of which, prcfented by the proprietor to the Antiquarian Society, weighed 
about a4lb. There are other two in his poffeffion, one of which weighs about 
1 61b. and the other about 141b. In the year 1775, the tuflc of a wild boar wa3 
dug up upon a marl fpade. The length of it, from thefuppofed feat in the jaw- 
bone, is 4 inches ; the greateft breadth near two. It refembles very much the 
colour and fubftance of ivory, but is faid to be only bone.

equal parts, by a den, or hollow, which takes its origin at 
the N. E. angle , and, widening as it reaches the fouthern 
boundary, g 1V es beginning to the great How, or Hollow of the 
Mearns ; which alfo extends through the fliire of Angus 
under the name of Strathmore ; being bounded all along, on 
the W., by the chain of the Grampian mountains, which 
reach obliquely acrofs the ifland, from this neighbourhood to 
the weft coaft *.

Surface, Soil, and Minerals.— The furface of this parifh, 
in general, is uneven, with fmall rifings, but no confiderable 
hill. The foil is various : Toward the fea coaft, loamy and 
clayey; in the middle, wet and moffy ; towards the Weft, 
gravelly and moorifli. The Jlrata appear, both from the fea 
coaft and inland quarries, to pep toward the S. W. ; which 
obfervation is alfo applicable to all the country round. The foil 
is full of round fmall ftones, of various kinds, having the 
appearance of being water-worn. Thefe ftones are very ufe- 
ful for improvement, in filling drains in wet land, almoft 
every field having fufficiency in itfelf ; and the harbour is 
furrounded with excellent free-ftone quarries, of a mod dur- 
able quality, which prove extremely valuable for building. 

Climate, Difeafes, Rivulets, %sc. — The air and climate here 
are much the fame as along the whole eaft coaft; variable, 

giving 

line of march, which all invaders from England followed, at the different periods 
when they over-ran Scotland. To this they were particularly directed, by the 
fordablc paffages of the river Tay, above the flow of the tide at Perth, and con- 
fined by the Grampian chain on the weft. The progrefs of the Romans, parti- 
cularly, in this direction, is evident, from a regular feries of encampments all 
the way along the foot of the hills. And it appears probable, that in this neigh- 
bourhood, where the hills join with the fea, the famous battle was fought, nar- 
rated by Tacitus, of the Scotch, under Galgacos, with the Romans, ftopt at 
the end of their progrefs, by the mountains and moraffes ; which arc defcribed 
as being at the foot of the Grampians, in fight of the Roman fleet. But at no 
other place in Scotland do the Grampian hills approach the fea. And in the 
neighbouring parifh of Fettercffo, about three miles to the northward of this 
place, there are the remains of a very large irregular camp in the hills, ftrongly 
entrenched on the quarter ntxt the fea. This would feem to have belonged to 
the Scotch army ; whereas, at the diftance of about two miles farther down, clofe 
to a flat fea beach, there were evident veftiges of a Roman Camp, a few year* 
ago, though they are now defaced by the improvement of the ground. And 
upon a moor nigh to the fuppofed Scotch camp, there arc a number of tumuli, 
indicating it to have been the field of battle.

giving occaflon to rheumatifm and confumption; but not re 
markable for an 7 other difeafe. Agues are here quite un- 
known, though prevalent through all the parifhes to the 
fouthward -No rivers run through this parifb, but feveral 
fmall rivulets, which chiefly find their way into the Carron 
upon the N. s the reft of the water running toward the 
fouthern boundary, and forming there a fmall ftream. I„ 
the Carron there are excellent trouts, and at its mouth a fal- 
rnon fifhing in the fea, of which the produce is very incon- 
iiderable. 



Sea Coafl and Foio!s.—The fea coaft is very bold, formed 
of ^plumb-pudding rock, and containing feveral deep caves. 
The moft remarkable part of the coaft is called Fowls-heugh 
about a mile in extent, and 30 fathoms high, inhabited by 
fea fowls ; fuch as gulls, coots, and kittyweaks, in fuch num. 
bers, that it is an employment, during the fummer months, 
to climb thefe perpendicular rocks, by the help of a rope tied 
round a man's middle, in which he is let down from the top 
to catch the fowls. The feathers and down of thefe fowls are 
in great demand ; and the kittyweaks, whofe flefti refembles 
that of folan geefe, are fold at high prices in the neighbour- 
ing towns. A rent of about al. 10s. is paid to the proprietor 
for the liberty of catching the fowls : And 6 men are com. 
monly employed in the work ; 5 of thefe being required to * 
let down and draw up the perfon in the rope. Thefe fea fowls 
are all migratory, appearing in April, and removing fouth- 
ward in September. 

Fifli and Kelp — The filliing, upon this part cf the coaft, 
has much declined for fome years part, the fea not producing 
near its ufual quantity : But what are caught, are of excellent 
quality. Three boats and a yawl, with 6 men in each, are 

commonly

commonly employed from this parifh. The fifh caught are cod, 
ling, haddocks, whitings* and flounders; befides a conhderable 
quantity of crabs and lobfterSj which are mofily confumed in 
the neighbourhood. Some kelp is made along this coaft, 
once in three years, the fea weed requiring that time to grow. 
But the quantity is very inconfiderablei 

Town and Harbour. — At the N. E. corner of the parifh, 
where the Carron runs into the feaj is fituated the fmaU town 
of Stonehaven, or Stonehive. The principal circumflance 
obfervable with refpecl to it, is its harbour, for which there 
is the beft natural fituation. It is a bafon, lheltered from the 
Si E. by a very high rock, which ftands out into the fea ; 
and on the N. E. there is a head* or quay, which in fome 
meafure defends it from that quarter. At high tides there is 
a depth of 21 feet water at the entrance. If the prefent quay 
Were carried farther out, and another built oppofite to it* vef- 
fels could lie in perfect fafety. And it would be of the utmolfc 
importance to all the fhipping upon the E. coaft of Scotland* 
that fome improvement of this kind were made : For there 
is not a harbour betwixt the Frith of Forth and Cromarty s 
that veffels in diftrefs can fo eafily get into ; as all the fea- 
faring people can bear witnefs. A fmall aid from govern- 
ment would be requilite for this improvement, to be joined 
to the ihore-dues and private contributions* 

Commerce and Government — There is very little trade here, 
except by 3 or 4 fmall veffcls, which are employed for fup- 
plying the neighbourhood, in bringing lime and coals from 
Sunderland and the Frith of Forth, with a few cargoes of 
wood, iron and flax from the Baltic*. The town confifts of

eftate it was fituated. It is a burgh of barony, of which the. 
jurifdiftion, by charter, is veiled in magiarates, chofen by 
the fuperior and feuers. The principal fupport of the town 
has been derived from the flieriff court of the county, which 
has its feat here ; — retail mops for the accommodation of the 
neighbourhood ; — commiffion upon flax given out to fpin for 
manufactures in Aberdeen and Montrofe ; — and the provifion 
for flapping, which occafionally put in here, or are detained 
by contrary winds. — The number of procurators, or attor- 
nies, before the flieriff court, is 4. 

ManvfaBures. — Tn point of natural fituation, no place has. 
greater advantages, for the eftablifliment of manufactures,, 
than Stonehaven, having a good fea port, an excellent conv- 
mand of running water, a populous diftridt of country around 
it, and abounding with the bed fpinners f . In the courfe of 
lafl; year (1792), fome branches of manufacture, of the Ofna- 
burgh, fheeting, linen cheque, and cotton. woolfey kinds, have 
been here fet on foot, chiefly by merchants in Arbroath. 
Thefe manufactures are as yet but in. their infancy ; but are 

propofed 



disadvantage" for many years paft, by being part of the forfeitures of 17T5, fold

into diforder, about the year 1740, ever fince that period there has been no fu- 
perior to forward the trade, and fuperintend the police of Stonehaven : And few 
of its inhabitants being poffeffed of any flock, little was to be expected fronv 
them. Hence all improvement was prevented, and matters continued in the 
fame ftate of backwardness. 

f A confiderable manufacture of fail-cloth was carried on here fome years 
ago, by a merchant in Aberdeen, which employed about 50 looms within the 
town, and 15 in the neighbourhood. But though attended with great fuccefs» 
it was given up, upon the death of that gentleman, and an end put to the trade

And, fince the commencement of the prefent year (1793). 
another manufacture of fail-cloth has been eftablifhed, con- 
taining 12- looms, requiring a capital of 300I. each. But to 
•fhew to what extent the manufactures might be carried here, 
it is to be obferved, that there are wages given to fpinners in 
this neighbourhood, by perfons in Stonehaven, who give out 
flax for manufacturers here and in other places, to the annual 
amount of 2,6521. 9s. 6d. Of this fum, a large proportion is 
on account of manufactures in Aberdeen, Montrofe, and Ar- 
broath, which have the burden of carriage of the flax and re- 
turn of the yarn, to and from thefe towns, at the refpective 
diftances of 15, 22, and 36 miles. To Montrofe alone, there 
are fent, weekly, at an average, 30 cwt. of yarn throughout 
the year. 

Manner of Living. — -The ftyle of living here is much above 
what might be fuppofed in fo fmall a town, poffeffed of fo 
little trade. But it is much to be regretted, that among the 
tradefmen, and lower fort of people, the practice of drinking 
fpirits is much too prevalent, to the ruin of their morals, 
health, and circumftances. The native beverage of our coun- 
try, ale, is defpifed, though it is fitted to fupport the labourer 
for his work, and encourages agriculture and manufactures ; 
while fpirits, which enervate body and mind, alfo confume 
4he profit of labour. 

E e 2 Revenue* 



220 Statiftical AcccQimt 

Revenue, Imports, tf,._ T he public revenue of Stonehaven 
confifts chiefly of the more dues, amounting annually to about 
ASU w which there has been a very great increafe of late 
years, from the great quantity of lime brought by f ea , for 
the improvement of lands in the neighbourhood.— Upon an 
average of 3 years, 10,566 bolls yearly have been imported 
from Sunderland and from the Frith of Forth, each boll be- 
ing 128 Scotch pints. The reft of the revenue arifes from 
4 fairs in the year, and fome (mall patches of ground, pro- 
ducing together about 20I. more. This fum, if properly ap- 
plied, would do much to the improvement of the harbour : 
But, till of late years, it has been levied to little account. 
From this fund, however, the town has lately been provided 
in excellent water, convened in leaden pipes ; the ftreets put 
in good repair; and a new fteeple built, with a public clock. 

Fuel. — No lime-ftone or coals have ever been difcovered in 
this neighbourhood; nor are there the leaft indications of 
them. The general fuel of Stonehaven, is coals, however, 
which are brought partly from the Frith of Forth, and partly 
from Newcaftle and Sunderland : The Scotch coal at the 
ufual rate of 8s. 6d. per boll, of 72 none ; the Englilh at 3s. 
for 24 ftone avoirdupoife ; of which the lafl are found cheapefl 
and mod economical*. But while coals arefo heavily taxed, 
the greateft bar is laid in the way of manufactures and im- 
provement; which is here the more fenfibly felt, as our neigh- 
bours in Forfarfhire, from a local exception, are free from 
this obnoxious tax, no duty being paid, on Scotch coal, all 
along the coaft of Fife and Angus, till they are brought to 
the borders of this county. But it is with great pleafure we 
underftand, that government have it in view to grant us re- 
lief in this neceflary article. Peats in this neighbourhood

the births, on account of numbers of old people, and perfons decayed, both 
in health and circumftance., who retire to Stonehaven from the neighbouring 
panfnes, when unable to hold poffeffions in the country. It is alfo obfervable 
that nctwKhftanding the decay of manufactures for feveral years, already men' 
tinned, yet the population of Stonehaven not only continued nearly the fame 
but alfo a confutable addition of buildings has fpread out from it, into the neigh.'

This circumftance is to be explained from the Hate of the adjacent country.' 
Upon the fale of the York Building Company's lands in the parifhes of Dun- 
nottar and Fettereffo, a confiderable revolution took place, by ejected cottages 
lemoving from the country to the town. And from the progrefs of improve- 
ment upon thefe eftates,fmce that time, not only thefe perfons find employment 
as day-labourers, but a number of ftrangers from other places have been drawn

lands, enclofing and planting have been rapidly carried for- 
SLd Hard wood and larches are found to fucceed beft, par- 
Ocularly the latter. Scotch firs are moft backward.-The 
Tft Lai crops of grain are bear and oats, with very 
Wley, and no wheat. Turnips and potatoes are likewife 
very much cultivated. The culture of turnips- particu ar y, 
has been greatly extended, which here fucceed remarkably 
well. Formerly they were chiefly ufed for fattening cattle; 
but, of late, the high prices have induced moft people to u&amp; 
them for rearing. They are commonly fown in broad caft 
with moft advantage, the foil being generally dry, A con- 
fiderable quantity of clover and rye-grafs is now fown ; but 
sot fo much as is requifite for good farming ; the horfes being 
chiefly fed upon ftraw, and the ground not fufficiently refted 
after improvement by fallow and lime. 

State of Property.— &amp; very accurate map of this county 
was executed in the year i 77 4 5 by which it appears, that in 
the parifh of .Dunnottar there are 6418 Scotch acres; of 
which about 3600 may be fuppofed arable, the reft being 
green pafture and moor. The greateft part of the land lies 
open; and much of it is let in fmall parcels, from 4 to 10 
acres. The rent is various, according to the different foils 
and the diftance from Stonehaven, being from 8s. to al per 
acre. Few farms are above 50I. rent. The whole rent of the 
parifh is about 2100I. The heritors are 4 in number, of 
whom only 1 refides within its bounds. 

Cattle.— The labour is here chiefly performed by horfes y 
there being 188 work horfes in the parifh, and only 24 oxen. 
—There is only 1 farm in the parifh with a ftock of ftieep ; 
but they have never been attended with any fuccefs. 



Prices 



22 4 Statiftical Account 

Prices of Lnlour _ Tht inhab;tants Qf the c J 
are moftly farmers and cottagers, with very few tradefmen , 
thele latter commonly refiding in Stonehaven. Of late the 
practice, of farmers letting ground to cottagers who do 'their 
work, IS much laid afide ; and they either keep their fervants 
m their own families, or depend upon labourers from the 
town. The ordinary wages of a farm fervant or ploughman, 
living in his matter's family, are from 61. to 7 1. per annum; 
The wages of a labourer, per day, from led. to is., without 
viftuals ; and, in harveft, the fame wages, with victuals. The 
women, in this neighbourhood, are generally employed in fpin- 
ningflax to manufafturers in Aberdeen and Montrofe, as well 
as Stonehaven, by which they gain, in ordinary times, about gs, 
per week. But of late, the price of fpinning has fo much 
advanced, by the increafed demand, that many reach as high 
as 4s. per week. Of confequence, the wages of women fer- 
vants are alfo raifed to about 2I. ics., and 3I. per annum, 
and ll. for harveft work, when engaged for by itfelf. 

Poor — Since the introduction of improvements in land, and 
the eftablifhment of manufactures in this neighbourhood, the 
number of poor in Stonehaven has greatly increafed ; partly 
owing to the cottagers and old people being banifhed from 
the country around, and repairing to the town ; and partly 
to the luxury too commonly introduced by high wages among 
labourers and tradefmen ; fo that they ftill rife in their ex- 
pences above the proportion of their gains. The number of 
poor now receiving alms in this parifh is 71, of whom 25 are 
refident in the country, and 46 in the town. The annual 
fum expended upon them, of public charity ^ is about 50I., 
of which 3a!. arifes from the weekly collections at the church,

iereft of a fum funded for their benefit, and the feveral in- 
cidents in the parim, fuch as fines, proclamation of banns, 
and burials. In the country, the poor, being generally fober 
and induftrious, earn a large (hare of their own maintenance. 
In the town, befides relief from the public funds, the poor 
receive frequent fupplies from charitable perlons, in private, 
otherwife a legal affeffment would be neceffary ; which has 
never yet taken place in this part of the country. 

Ecclefiajlical State and School.— .The eftablifhed clergyman, 
by a late augmentation, has a living of about 115I. value, 
befides a glebe, which might rent at about 81. The church 
was rebuilt in 1782, and the manfe in 1786. In Stonehaven 
there are 2, diffenting meetings, one of the qualified Epifco- 
palians of the Church of England ; the other of Scotch Epif- 
copalians*; to each of which belong about 150 fouls. — The 
parim fchool is placed in Stonehaven, where there is a very 
confiderable number of fcholars, having fometimes amounted 
to ico. Thefalary and emoluments may be about 40I. ; and 
in fome years have amounted to 50I. in proportion to the 
number of fcholars, and the activity of the teacher f . 

Vol. XI. F f Roads* 

* The Epifcopal nonjurant principle was moft prevalent in this neighbourhood, 
for many years after the late rebellions, owing to attachment to the forfeited 
Marischal family. But the fpirit of that feci has here fubfidei, as well as ift 
other places; and the people of the different communions live together in the 
greateft harmony. As an inftance of the liberality of mind I'ublifiing among 
them, in the year 178*, when the parifh. church was rebuilding, the clergyman, 
with the congregation, had accefs to the qualified Episcopal meeting* houfe, to 
perform divine fcrvice; and the two congregations were blended at each of the 
Services.

Roads. — Two highways pafs through this parifh ; the end 
tlire&amp;ly for Perth, the other being the poft road from Edin- 
burgh along the coaft, by Dundee, Arbroath, and Montrofe ; 
which two roads, uniting at Stonehaven, are continued in one 
to Aberdeen. It muft be acknowledged, that no highways 
in Scotland are in worfe condition ; the ftatute labour having 
been very imperfectly applied, although there is reafon to 
believe, it would have been tolerably fufficient for their fup- 
port, if commuted for money ; the country being populous, 
and there being no great towns to occafion heavy carriages. 
The fame remark may be applied to the greateft part of 
this country But, by the ruinous flate into which the high- 
ways have fallen, the county have become fenfible of the ne- 
ceffity of turnpikes, for which an application is refolved to 
be made to parliament next feflion, as well as for a commuta- 
tion of the ftatute labour. 

Caflle. — 'The Castle of Dunnottar,, now in ruins, is the 
only antiquity, in this parifh, deferving particular attention. 
It is fituated on a perpendicular rock, level on the top, of 
feveral acres extent, projecting into the fea, and almoft fepa- 
rated from the land by a very deep chafm. By this fituation, 
it forms one of the rnoft majeftic ruins in Scotland. From 
fome old papers ftill extant f, it appears, that upon this rock 
was formerly fituated the parifh church j and that the fortrefs 

was 

to make them all Latin fchools, thei'r end is much loft. Perhaps the erection 
of only a few of thefc, with an annual viQtation of the whole, by the Coramif- 
ficners of Supply and Prefbyt'ery of the bounds, would be attended with the belt 
effects. Thefe vifitors might alfo have the power of fixing and augmenting the 
falary each year, to be aflefled upon the refpetfive parifh.es, according to the 
merit of the teacher.

+ Its great reputation for ftrengch gave occafion to a circumftance which ren- 
dered it very remarkable. The Regalia of Scotland (the crown, fceptre and 
fvvord) were depofited here, in the year i66r, to preferve them from the Eng- 
lifh army, which over-ran this country during the civil wars of that period. Be- 
ing lodged in this place by order of the Privy Council of Scotland, Earl Mari- 
schal, proprietor of the caftle, obtained from the public a garrifon, with an or- 
der for fuitable ammunition and provifions. He, joining the King's forces in 
England, appointed George Ogilvy of Barras, a neighbouring proprietor, 
who had been officer for feveral years in the King's fervice, to be lieutenant 
governor of the caftle. This truft Mr. Ogilvy maintained with the greatefl; 
refolution. For after all the other forts and places of ftrength in Scotland were 
reduced by the Engliih army, a body of troops, under the command of Lambert, 
fat down before Dunnottar. It was firft fummoned to furrender in November 
l6jl, and repeatedly afterwards during the courfe of the winter. About the 
beginning of May following, the fiege was converted into a- blockade. And 
though Governor Ogilvy was in the greateft ftraits for provifions and ammu- 
nition, with a moft fcanty garrifon, and though he received orders from the 
Earl Marifchal, by that time a prifoner in London, to deliver up the place, and 
was repeatedly urged by the Chancellor of Scotland, and others, to convey away 
th« regalia to fome fecure place in the Highlands, and thereafter capitulate ; 
yet he ftill held out, till preffed by famine, and by the mutiny of the garrifon, 
and having found means to convey the regalia privately to the clergyman of 
Kincrieff, in which parilh Mr. Ogilvy's property chiefly lay, .he at laft capitu-

CharaBer.-T\* labouring people in the country, in gene- 
J are very fober and indubious. Thofe m the town, are 
of the fame charader as in other towns along tins coaft. It 
s to be regretted, that the depopulation of the country, by 
Liming cottagers into towns, has fo much prevailed every 
w here of late, by which the breed of men is enervated the 
morals corrupted, and the ftrength of the ftate impaired. It 
is fr0 m the temperate and healthy family of the country la- 
bourer, or tradefman, and not from the loathfome fink of a 
town, that the race is to be fought, who are to cultivate our 
fields, or defend our property in the time of danger. In ge- 
neral, the character of charity may with great juftice be 
afcribed to the body of the people here ; fo that no fubjeft of 
diftrefs can be long without relief voluntarily offered. And 
perhaps, in a moral view, the encouragement of THIS virtue 
may be none of the leaft arguments againft the eftablifhment 
of poor's rates. For the exercife of. private charity, and com- 
pajion, muji always decline where there is a public afefment.

<p>Origin of the Name. 



J? CCLES , s evidently derived from the word Ecctya, 
J-i which, in the Greek, fignifies a congregation, affembly, 
or meeting of people. Sometimes it fignifies the place where 
the meeting is held ; and, in modern times, it is confined to 
an affembly of Chriftians meeting together for devotion and 
worfhip, and agrees with the Latin phrafe, Cxtus fanBus 
Chriftianorum, out a des fa era. -From an appendix to Hope's 
Minor PraBics, by the late John Spottiswood, Efq. of 
Spottifwood, advocate, (which takes notice of all the religious 
houfes in Scotland, at the time of the Reformation), it appears, 
that Eccles, in the county of Berwick, was anciently the' 
feat of the nunnery of the Benardine, or Cijiertian Nuns. It 
was founded in the year 1154, according to Harden ; but

appearance of a highly cultivated garden. Of late years 
great improvements have been made in agriculture, through 
the whole county of Berwick; but in no parilh have they 
been carried on with greater rapidity, and to greater advan- 
tage, than in this. Notwithftanding the diftance from lime '

Agriculture, 

VThc writer of this article Isold enough to remember, that butcher meat 
was feldom feen on a farmer's table, except on a Sunday. But how is the fcene 
changed ! No perfon now entertains better than the farmer, nor is there more 
neatnefs or elegance any where to be found, than in their houfes; and as all 
this is the effedt of induftry, they have an unqueftionable title to enjny the 
fruits of their honeft labour. Formerly, in this county, eftates were made only 
by gentlemen in the lata department. But the cafe is now entirely altered. 
There are, in the county of Berwick, above a dozen farmers, who, by their in- 
genuity and induftry, have acquired very confiderable eftates ; and there k 
every reafon to believe, that many more will foon be in the fame independent 
fituation. The price of labour has kept pace with the progrefs of improvement.

fpriuK oats are fown in the month of March and beginning 
of April ; and if the fummer is favourable, they are common- 
ly reaped from the end of Auguft to the middle of September. 
Barky is generally fown in April and the beginning of May, 
and is reaped as foon as the oats. Peafe, cold feed, if the 
weather admits, are fown in February and the beginning of 
March. 'When fown later, they feldom come to perfeftion. 
Wheat (a great quantity of which is produced in the parim), 
is generally fown upon fallow in the end of September. 
A number of farmers fow wheat after peafe ; and, if the 
land is clean, and the peafe a good crop, it generally fucceeds ; 
though fome aVe of opinion, that it is a fpecies of hulbandry 
not to be imitated. Wheat is alfo fometimes fown in the 
fpfing, after turnips ; but the crop is feldom good, as it is 
generally very late, and neither gives much wheat nor flour. 
Although there are no ^nds in Berwickshire, that will produce 
turnips of greater fize and quantity, than fome farms in this, 
parifh, yet the moft judicious farmers are of opinion, that 
they can turn their lands to greater account. The incon- 
veniences attending turnips, on a clay foil, are the following : 
jj t They cannot be taken off without injuring the land ma- 
terially, as the water Hands the whole winter in the tracks of

are often up to the belly in mud and water. In thefe places 
of the parifh where the foil is light, great profits are made by 
feeding flieep on turnips. They are generally let at from 4L 
to 5I. the Englilh acre ; and the writer hereof has once and 
again fold them for 5 guineas. 

Climate and Difeafes — The climate of Eccles, from its low 
and flat fituation, is by no means the moft healthy; and from 
the marfh miifma, (arifing from rain water ftagnating on the 
Jurface of a foil, chiefly clay), the people are peculiarly ob- 
noxious to difeafes of debility, fuch as agues, nervous fevers, 
chronic rheumatifms, &amp;c. Within thefe laft 20 years, thefe 
difeafes were almoft epidemic, among the lower claffes of the 
people. Of late, however, they are much lefs frequent, and 
greatly milder. This may be attributed to two caufes : ijl 
To the advanced ftate of agricultural improvement, and efpe- 
cially draining of land ; which, by drawing off the rain water 
that formerly ftagnated on the furface, has rendered the foil 
dryer, and confequently more wholefome : idly % To the lower 
claffes being more comfortably clothed and lodged, and living 
more on animal food than formerly. That the influence of a 
damp climate is corrected by a generous mode of living, is 
abundantly evident from this circumftance, that while the 
poorer fort are often vifited by the abovementioned difeafes, 
the gentry and opulent farmers almoft always efcape. Among 
the caufes, which have contributed to leffen the influence of 

• ... 

the difeafes peculiar to this climate, there is one, which the 
Encumbent's perfonal knowledge of its happy effe&amp;s will not 
allow him to omit ; the wearing of flannel next the Jkin. 
Nor is it difficult to account for this effecl:. Rheumatifm 
proceeds evidently from the perfpiration being obftrudled on 
the furface of the body ; and nothing but flannel will preferve

iefted to togs, and to the vapours which arife from water flag- 
ging on the furface of the ground. Could people be pre- 
vailed on univerfally to adopt this pradice, it would do more 
to alleviate, if not extirpate nervous difeafes, than the united 
powers of the whole materia medica.—The ravages made by 
the fmall pox were formerly very great, not lefs than a third 
part of all thofe infefted being carried off by this malignant 
difeafe : But fince the introduaion of inoculation, which of 
late has become very general, the baneful influence of this 
difeafe has been greatly mitigated *. 

River and jfyfc.— This parifli has no river that runs through 
it, but the Tweed ; which feparates Scotland and England, 
walhes the fouthern boundary, and affords a very lucrative 
falmon filhing, though at the diftance of near 20 miles from 
the fea. 'the property belongs to the Earl of Home.

years ago, the number of examinable perfons in the parifli of 
Eccles, was - " ----- 1240

to reconcile the minds of the common people to this ufeful practice, by paying the 
expence of inoculating the children of the poor around them. In this way, they 
have done more to promote the practice, than either reafon or eloquence could 
have effected. 

J To account for the fmall number of regiftered marriages, it is to be ob- 
served, that the practice of marrying in a dandeftine and irregular manner ftill 
fubfifts upon the Borders; and though the fynud of Merfe and Tiviotdale have 
done every thing in their power to reprefs it, yet it is ftill kept up by fome 
members of the Church of England, who facrifice the dignity of their profeflloii 
to a little tranficnt emolument. — There are alfo many more baptifms than thefe 
which arc regiftered; but of late years, fincc the tax of threepence was paid to 
the King, over and above the ufual fees of regiftration, many cannot be prevailed 
on to enrol their childrens names. The minifter has done every thing in his 
power, to convince them of the propriety of the meafure ; but many individuals

Sheep and Wool Our farmers do not breed many fheep. 

This is owing to the nature of the foil, which often produces 
that baneful difeafe, well known by the name of the rot. The 
greateft proportion is confequently bought in, and fed off. 
The lambs are generally fold in the months of June, July, 
and Auguft, and the ewes about Michaelmas and Martinmas. 
The wool of thefe fheep is not very valuable, as they are ge- 
nerally bought in from mountainous counties, fuch as Tweed- 
dale and Lammermuir. Such wool fells from 10s. to 12s. per 
Hone. As for the fheep purchafed from Northumberland and 
Bijhoprick, they are of a very fuperior kind. The wool of 
that flaple generally fells from 18s. to one guinea per ftone, 
and the carcafe weighs from 70 lb. to 80 lb. There are only 
a farmers in the parifh who are breeders of Iheep ; which 
turn out to great account. The fheep which they breed, are 
equal to any bred in Northumberland, both for weight and 
finenefs of fleece ; and, as a proof of this, 100 lambs, with 
the wool of the ewes, were fold for ico guineas ; and a con- 
fiderable profit was made of them, both by the butcher and 
manufacturer. 

Union of Farms. — About 25 or 30 years ago, the farms in 
the parifh of Eccles were very fmall, and feveral gentlemen 

of 

* There would be many more ploughs, if there was not a confiderable quan- 
tity of land laid eff in the beft order, both for breeding and feeding. 



Statiflkal Account 

6f fmall eftates farmed their own lands. At this period, little 
profit arofe from agriculture j and it is only fince farms were 
united, that great profits have been made. It is now to be 
feared, however, that farming is going to the oppofite extreme ; 
and the writer hereof cannot help thinking, that too great 
property, and too extenfive farming, is a very great lofs to 
any country. In the parifh of Eccles, fome farms are far too 
extenfive, confidering the good quality of the land. Some tenants 
poffefs above 900 acres, feveral 800, and fcarcely can a farm 
of 50 or 60 acres be got for any rent. In land fuch as that 
of Eccles, there ought riot to be a farm exceeding 300 acres. 
This quantity of land would fupport a family very decently, 
and befides afford an ample provifion for their children ; and, 
in the opinion of fome, it is very imprbper to elevate men 
too high above their ftation. As many of our farmers have 
got a very narrow education, riches have often the unhappy 
effeft of making them proud, and leading them to treat their 1 
fuperiors with infolence and contempt. 

Rent and Proprietors, i$c — The rent of this parifh, at pre- 
fent, is nearly n,oool. ; and it will advance confiderably in 
a very fhort time, as fome old leafes, upon extenfive eftates, 
muft foon expire. There is no farm, fince the author has 
been minifter of the parifh, but what has been doubled in rent, 
and fome of them have been tripled ; and if grain and flock 
continue to hold the value they do at prefent, it would not be 
furprifing, if, in the courfe of a few years, the rental of thi? 
parifh mould exceed l8,oool. or even 20,000!. per annum. 
There is a farm, near Eccles, that expires in a year or two, 
rented at 180I., and it is credibly reported, that 480I. has been 
offered, and refufed. — There are above 30 gentlemen, pro- 
prietors of eftates; fome of whom poffefs 1,4001., many 800I. 
and 900I. per annum, many confiderably lefs, and fome fmall

are in number 56 ; and many of our gentbmen retain as much 
land in their own hand, as accommodates their families with 
the neceflaries of life. 

Ecclefiqfiical State.— The incumbent has had great difficulty 
to afcertain the extent of the ancient Nunnery. It appears to 
have been nearly a fquare of 6 acres ; extending rather farther 
to the S. and W. than to the E. and N. The only veftige 
remaining of it is two vaulted cells f, which the late Sir 
John Paterfon converted into two cellars, for holding wine, 

ale, l$c The old church was a Gothic building, in the 

form of a crofs, vaulted and covered with large flag ftones, 
dedicated to St. Andrew, the tutelar faint of Scotland, and 
ornamented with a crofs, and a very elegant fteeple. The 
building might have flood for many centuries, and it was 
with the greateft difficulty it was taken down. But as it was 
too fmall to accommodate the inhabitants, the proprietors of 
the parifh took it down about 20 years ago, and built a very 
handfome modern church on the fame ground, 75 feet long, 

by 



f The burial ground contiguous to thefe vaults is all flagged with fine flone, 
4 feet beneath the furface ; which is a clear proof that there have been many- 
more cells, of a fimilar kipd to the former ; and as the ground, when turned up, 
exhibits only a mixture of fand, lime, and earth, it appears to be nothing but 
the rubbifh of the fallen vaults. It is faid, that the principal entrance to the 
nunnery was from the W., where there was a very fpacious gate, beautifully 
fculptured, and adorned with a variety of figures. Before the front door of 
the manfion houfe 0 f Eccles, a ftone coffin was dug out, above fix feet long, and 
covered above with flag Hones. As it had been buried above 200 years, every 
part of the body was reduced to allies. As the infide of the ftone was pretty 
fmooth.and the whole portrait of the perfon vifible (though in afhes), Sir John 
Paterfon had the curiofity to colled the whole, and (wonderful to tell !) it did 
not exceed in weight one ounce and a half!

It was built after the model of the Chapel of Eafe in Edin- 
burgh, is in every refpeft well finiflied, and is, without dif- 
pute, the bell and handfomeft country church in Berwickfhire. 
The prefent incumbent was the firft minifler who preached in 
it. The r: anfe and offices were built at the fame time. They 
were removed from the place where they formerly flood, 
which was a little to the S. W. of the manfion-houfe of 
Eccles ; and as the heritors would not confent to the removal, 
unlefs Sir John was at the whole expence of the new build- 
ings, he acceded to the conditions. The glebe was exchanged 
at the fame time, and placed very conveniently in the front 
of the manfe. It confifts of rather more than 20 acres of 
good arable ground, and is well worth as many pounds Ster- 
ling. As the ftipend, when the prefent minifler entered to 
the charge, did not exceed 72I., every thing included, he was 
obliged to purfue for an augmentation. The Lords of Seffion 
granted one to the extent of 30I. : But, what is extremely 
hard on him, although it is above 18 years fince it was ob- 
tained, the allocation is not yet finally fettled. Several of the 
heritors, indeed, paid by the firft allocation, but many more 
have refufed payment ; and there are arrears, at this moment 
due, to the extent of fcveral hundred pounds. 

Poor. — The poor, that are rated in the books, amount to 
the number of 30 perfons; and the parifh is aflefled in 120I. 
per annum for their fupport. As for the induflrious poor, 
when families may want occafional fupport, they are relieved, 
either from the money collected on the Sabbath-day, or by 
the generofity of the gentlemen in the parifh. The author 
mentions it to their honour, that on a proper reprefentation 
of diftrefs, he has always found them liberal and beneficent. 



Antiquities. 



of Ecchs. 24 1 

Antiquities From our vicinity to England, it might have 

feeen expeded, that we fhould have had many memorials of 
thofe bloody contefts, which formerly fubfifted between the 
neighbouring kingdoms. We have only, however, one of 
this kind. It is a monument ereded to one of the Percieb, 
who fell in a bloody engagement with one of the rival family 
of Douglas. It confifts of a large fquare ftone, full 9 feet 
above the furface. On one fide of the fquare appears the 
greyhound, which is the Percie's creft ; on another, the figure 
of a naked man, in rude fculpture ; and, on the other two 
fides, the ancient fword and battle-ax are pourtrayed f. It 
ftands nearly a mile to the N. E. of the village, of Eccles. 

Dif advantages* — Among the natural defects in the fituation 
of Eccles, mud fi.lt be mentioned the want of running water. 
In times of fevere drought, our brooks and rivulets are often 
entirely dried up 5 and our farmers are fometxmes obliged to 
drive their cattle to the Tweed, a diftance of between 2 and 
3 miles. Another difadvantage under which we labour, is 
our diftance from coals and lime. We are obliged to bring 
both thefe articles from Northumberland, which is not lefs 
remote than from 14 to 18 miles. Hence fuel becomes a mod 
expenfive article in houlekeeping ; and the diftrefs of the 
lower ranks, in fevere winters, is unfpeakably great. Our 
diftance from markets is alfo another inconvenience. Our

farmers cannot depend on a ready fale, and quick return of 
money, in any market nearer than Berwick, which is diftant 
almoft 20 miles ; and it is to that place, accordingly, that they 
commonly fend all their wheat and barley. Kelfo, indeed, is 
within 6 miles of Eccles ; but as no corn merchants attend 
there, to buy grain for exportation, the only purchafers are 
country millers, who buy it for internal confumption, and 
with whom it is generally difagreeable, and often unfafe to 
deal. The circumftance, which enables us to ftruggle under 
thefe inconveniences, is the goodnefs of our public roads ; and 
the gentlemen of the county deferve high praife for the at- 
tention they have paid to this important particular, and the 
regulations they have made for keeping the roads in a {late 
of good repair.

<p>Origin of the Name. 

THERE is no certainty as to the origin of the name ot 
this parifli. Some fuppofe it to be from the Gaelic, 
In that language it is called Dunnivet, which is probably taken 
from fome part or property in the Head-land, that being the 
mofl remarkable place in the parifli*. The names of many- 
places in the parifli, however, are clearly of Danifli extraction ; 
as Ratter, Syjler, Reajler, Holm (fince called Ham), Sunnigoe i 
AJlngoe, Gettriegcie, Aljloigoe, %3c. 

H h 3 Extent^ 



* What renders this prohahle, is, that the S. \ft. part of Dunnet Headj 
bears a ftrong refemblance to the ground, upon which the Caftle of Dunnotta'r 
fa name not unfimilar in found to Dunnet), in the county of Mearns, it built.

Extent, Situation, and Soi/.-Thz parife is about 10 mile* 
long, irom N. W. to S. E ; and 4 miles broad, about the 
middle, but much narrower towards the extremities. It is one 
of the mod northern pariihes in Scotland; and indeed the ex- 
tremity of Dunnet Head, by the lateft obfervations, is found t» 
be fomewhat farther N. than even Duncanfbay Head, or Job* 
o' Groat's. The foil is, in general, of a light nature, with little 
ftiffclay, or deep loam. On the V/. it is fandy, and towards 
the E. it is chiefly a light black foil ; but not without the ex- 
ception of feveral farms, which are rich clay. The far greater 
part of the parifii is uncultivated, and, indeed, a great part of 
it unfit for cultivation. 



Dunnet Head. — Dunnet Head is an extenfive promontory 
on the W. It confifts of feveral hills, but none of them of 
confiderable height, interfperfed with vallies, in which there 
is a great extent of pafture for fmall cattle or fheep. It was 
formerly well ftored with the latter; which are faid to have 
fucceeded well : But as thefe were deftroyed by the introduc- 
tion of a difeafe, it has, for many years part, turned to little 
account to the neighbouring proprietors, who have it in com- 
mon. Dunnet Head p relents very bold rocks, towards the 
jfea, from 100 10 400 feet high, through its whole circuit, 
•which is not lefs than 9 miles, exclufive of 2 miles of low 
land, by which it is joined to the reft of the panfti. There is 
no part of it inhabited. The foil is chiefly mofs, running on 
free-ftone, or fandy clay. The free-ftone, which is the only 
kind of ftone found there, is exceedingly hard, and feems to 
be very little afFecled by the influence of the air, as appears 
by the corner ftones of a fmall fteeple, adjoining the church, 
which ftill bear the original marks of the iron, though tt has 
not flood, by the beft accounts, lefs than 200 years. Such an 
extent of durable free-ftone quarry, would, in fome parts of 



of D unnet, 2%$ 

(he kingdom, be a treafure; but here it yields nothing, except 
a fmall rent to one of the neighbouring proprietors, for the 
privilege of quarrying millftones ; an article, in which the 
greater part of the county are fupplied from thence. There 
are feveral fmall lochs in different parts of the Head, which 
furnilh water, fufficient for a mill, through the greater part of 
the year. 

Sea Coajl, Ketp, Lakes, &amp;c— Oa the E. of Dunnet Bay, 
there is a" beautiful level fand, for two miles along the more, 
over which the fea ebbs and flows, above a quarter of a mile. 
But as there is commonly a great breach upon the more, very 
few fhell fiih are found in it, and thefe of little value. The 
fand, above high-water mark, is loofe ; and by being expofed 
to driving, from the fudion of the bay, frequently hurts the 
neighbouring lands. Adjoining to that, there is a trad of 
barren fand, nearly a miles in diameter, which is faid to have 
been arable ground, or rich pafture, fome time about the end 
•f lalt century. The ruins of cottages are now appearing in 
different parts of it ; but they feem to be of a much older date. 
The part of the parilh to the E. of Dunnet Head, along the 
Pentland Frith, has a low rocky more, which, on an average, 
may produce about 20 tons of kelp per annum. A few 
tons may likewife be made on the fhores to the N. of 
Dunnet Bay. The other uncultivated grounds are chiefly 
mofs and moor; and of the laft a great part is capable of cul- 
tivation. There is fcarcely an eminence in the parifh, except 
in Dunnet Head, that deferves the name of a hill. Three 
lakes, each about a mile in length, and half as much in breadth, 
fupply the principal mills with water. A few fmall trouts are 
found in one of thefe ; the other two, being in the vicinity of 
the fand, are frequented only by a few eels. 



H$ Statifiical Account 

^ The current in Pentland Frith is exceedingly ftrorir 
during fpring tides, fo that no velTel can ftem it. The flood tide 
tuns, from W. to £., at the rate of 10 miles an hour, with new 
and full moon. It is then high water at Scarfskerry (whence 
the ferry boat croffes fromDunnet for Orkney), at 9 o'clock. 
Immediately as the water begins to fall upon the more, the' 
current turns to the W. : But the ftrength of the flood is 
great in the middle of the frith, that it continues to run E. 
till about twelve, Thefe contiguous currents, running with 
amazing velocity, in oppofite directions, have a ftrange ap- 
pearance from the land, in a day favourable for obferving 
them. With a gentle breeze of wefterly wind, about 8 o'clock 
in the morning, the whole frith feems as fmooth as a meet of 
glafs, from Dunnet Head to Hoy Head, in Orkney. About 
9 the fea begins to be in a rage, for about 100 yards, to appear- 
ance, off the Head, while all without that continues fmooth as 
before. This appearance gradually advances towards the frith,' 
and along the more to the E., though the effads of it are not 
much felt upon the more, till it reach Scarfskerry Head, which 
is about 3 miles diftant from D'unnet Head, as the land be- 
tween thefe t wo points forms a coniiderable bay. By 2 o'clock, 
the whole frith feems to Be in a rage. About 3 in the after- 
noon, it is low water on the Ihore, when all the former pheno- 
mena are reverfed ; the fmooth water beginning to appear on 
the land, and advancing gradually till it reaches the middle of 
the frith, From the ftrength of the tides, and the furprifing 
velocity of thefe contiguous currents, in oppofite directions, 
Pentland Frith is a very dangerous navigation to ftrangers, 
efpecially if they approach near the land. But the natives, 
along the coaft, are fo well acquainted with the direction of* 
the tides, that they can take advantage of every one of thefe 
currents, to carry them fafe to one harbour or another. Hence 
very few accidents happen, but from want of Ikill or know- 
ledge

ledge of the tides. The fafeft way for ftrangers is either to 
taks a pilot on board, or to keep at a confiderable diftance 
from the land *. The frith is faid to be about 1 2 miles broad, 
oppofite to Dunnet, though no exaft meafurement has pro- 
bably been taken. 

Harbours. — Though Dunnet Bay runs far into the land, it 
affords no flielter for any veflel upon the N. fide of it, which 
is contiguous to Dunnet Head, as it is expofed to the W. But 
on the Pentland Frith, to the E. of the Head, there are feverat 
very fecure havens for boats or fmall craft. The haven of 
Brough, clofe by the Head, is well fheltered from every wind 

but 



* la fpring 1 791, there was a veflel from Dantzic, of about 500 or 600 tons 
burden, paffing through the frith, on a voyage to Liverpool, The mafter, find- 
ing the current againjl him, in the middle of the frith, when about 8 or 9 miles 
E, of Dunnet Head, bore in for the fhore, where he fell in with the laft of the 
ebb, called by the people here the wejlcr birth. The wind was about N. W. 
The current brought him up paft Scarfskerry ; but he was fo near the fhore, 
that the people on land were much alarmed for his fafcty. Soon after, a boa t 
went out, and offered him a pilot, which he refufed ; on which they advifed him 
to {land fome miles out to fea. When he came up clofe with Dunnet Head, he 
tacked, and flood out only about a mile to fea. Finding the current ftrong to 
the W., he thought it unneceflary to continue longer on that tack, as he knew 
it was not near low water in the frith ; upon which he tacked again, and ftoocj 
to the W., hoping all danger was over. He cleared Dunnet Head ; but by 
that time it had begun to flow upon the fhore; and the eafier birth fetting in, 
foon reached him with confiderable ftrength. Upon finding his veflel carried 
to the E., by the ftern, and faft approaching the head land, he attempted to 
tack, but found that impoflible, as the wind and current, being nearly in the 
fame direction, the veflel would not anfwer the helm. He then attempted to 
•wear, but with no better effecT:. The people on fhore obferved, that nothing, 
in that fituation, could have faved him, but dropping an anchor over the ftern ; 
and the moment he found that hold, fo as to turn the veflel, flipping the cable, 
and Handing to fea. Negledling that precaution, he was driven afliore and 
wrecked, and that through mere ignorance, without the leaft ftrefs of weather. 



Statiftical Account 

but the N. W.j and a fmall expence might render it fecure 
aga.nft it too, by throwing a pier from the lan, , to a large 
clett, or out-ftanding rock, which is abpul ioc yards from 
the fliore. Nature has already done that in part, by forming 
a barr, or ridge of large ftones, out to that rock ; but that 
barrier is not fufficiently high, to prevent the feas breaking 
over it, at high water. Mr. Knox, in the courfe of his tour, 
was much taken with that harbour, and feemed to think the 
executing fuch a pier, an objeft worthy of attention. This 
could be effcaed with the greater eafe, as there would be no 
occafion for quarrying a fingle llone, or for carrying one above 
200 yards. The fpace to the E. of the pier, being cleared of 
Hones, would form an excellent harbour for fmall veffels; the 
entrance to which is about 3 fathoms deep at low water, and 
without any bar. Brough has, befides, the advantage of be- 
ing very contiguous to the belt fifhing ground for cod and 
ling 5 and hence is not only capable of being rendered a fafe 
harbour, but the moft commodious fifhing ftation in the parifb, 
or even on this fide of the Pentland Frith. The harbour of 
Ham or Holm, is fcarcely a mile to the eaft of Brough. It 
might alfo be rendered fafe for fmall veflels, at 1 ttle expence. 
There is a fuperficial pier erected there already ; and, the 
ground within it being pretty well cleared of nones, veffels of, 
or below 100 tons, find no inconveniency of loading or un- 
loading a cargo, or even lying there for weeks in the fummer 
feafon. It has, however, the inconveniency of a bar, or ridge 
of fand and gravel, acrofs the entrance of it, upon which 
there is not fufficient depth of water for veffels in any great 
burden, but with fpring tides. Scar/skerry is a narrow creek 
between two rocks, and affords a convenient landing for boats 
with eafy weather, but is not capable of being much im- 
proved.

Fijb. DunnetBay affords excellent flounders, and haddocks; 

and is fometimes frequented by fhoals of herrings, in July and 
Auguft. But their continuance in the bay, or even their coming 
to it, has hitherto been reckoned fo uncertain, that no ex- 
tenfive herring fifhery has been attempted. Befides thefe, 
great quantities of cuddins, as they are called here, or fmali 
faiths, are ufually caught in the fummer feafon. Pentland 
Frith abounds with excellent cod and ling ; not of a very 
large fize, but remarkably thick and of a good quality. The 
haddocks and flounders are taken with' fmall lines, mounted 
with 5 or 6 fcore of hooks, which are fet, and left in the fea 
commonly through the night. The cuddens are taken with a 
rod and line, to which is fixed a fingle hook, and for the mofl 
part in mallow water, or near the fhore. The cod and ling 
are found principally in deep water, in the tide way, and taken 
with a line of 50 or 60 fathoms, to which a fingle hook is fixed, 
and a lead weight or finker. There are various other kinds 
of fifh occafionally taken, as turbot, fkate, whitings, &amp;cc. In 
harveft, too, amazing fhoals of fmall fifh, called fellacks (which 
are no other than the young of faiths, and fome fpecies of the 
cod), frequent the fhores, and are often taken in a fmall 
fweep net, to the quantity of feveral bufhels at once. There 
are fcarcely any fhell fifh to be found here, but lobftets, crabs, 
and limpets. 

Birds. — A great variety of fea fowls frequent the rocks of 
Dunnet Head ; though, as the highefl rocks front the W. 
and N. W., they are not fo numerous as they would other- 
wife probably be. There is a bird, called a layer, here, that 
hatches in fome parts of the rock. It is reported, that it is 
only to be found in Dunnet Head, Hoy Head in Orkney, ir» 
Wales, and in the Cliffs of Dover (where it is faid to be known 
by the name of the puffin), and in no other place in Britain.

The old ones are little efteemed ; but the young are reckoned 
extremely delicate. As there is no way, however, of getting 
to their nefts, but by descending from the top of the rock, by 
the affiftance of a rope, no perfon in this parifh has attempt- 
ed to catch aiiy of them for many years pall. A few eagles, 
a variety of hawks, ravens, crows, and wild pigeons, likewife 
hatch in the rocks. The other birds moft common in the 
parifh, are plovers and groufe ; but the latter are not in great 
abundance. 

Wild Quadrupeds — Otters are occafionally found in Dunnet 
Head ; and feals often frequent the fhores, but not in fo great 
numbers as in many other parts of the county. The only 
favenous animals here are foxes and weafels. There are a ! 
good many hares in different parts j and the fandy ground, inr 
the neighbourhood of Dunnet Bay, would make a good rab- 
bit warren, if they were preferved : But, as they expofe the 
fand to driving, by breaking the ground, the proprietor al- 
lows every perfon to moot them, without reftriction. It has 
not, however, been poffible wholly to extirpate them, though 
they do great mifchief. Some of them have found their way 
into Dunnet Head, where they would probably multiply ra«* 
pidly, were they not a prey to the foxes and eagles. 

Climate and Difeafes, \£c — The climate varies according to 
the diftance from the fea. Along the Pentland Frith the air 
is generally temperate in fummer, and cold and fharp in win~ 
ter j but fnow feldom continues upon the ground, for any 
great length of time. Towards the S. E., or more inland 
parts of the parifh, the frofts are much keener in winter ; and 
the corns are more liable to be hurt by hoar frofts, in fpring 
and autumn. The village, or rather farm, of Dunnet, fituated 
to the E. of Dunnet Head,i and to the N t E. of the Bay, has a 

beau* 



of Djunnet. 251 

beautiful expofure and declivity to the S., and is reckoned 
an exceedingly healthy fituation ; yet there are few well at- 
tefted inftances of longevity in it. This may be owing to 
.the people's mode of life. They have all of them very fmall 
farms ; and mod of them depend upon the fea principally for 
-their fubfiftence. By thefe means, they obferve little regu- 
larity in diet, being fometimes obliged to live chiefly on ve- 
getables, and at other feafons, confined perhaps wholly to 
animal food. They are befides frequently expofed to cold 
and damps, and fometimes, like other feafaring people, to 
exceffive fatigue, which brings on rheumatifms and coughs. 
Thefe are no doubt greatly increafed, by their being ill ac- 
commodated in lodging. Their houfes are for the moft part 
ere&amp;ed of turf, exceedingly low and ill aired. Nor have 
•they that regard to cleanlinefs which is neceffary for health. 
They are, however, improving in that refpedt. 

Population. — All the information, that is deiirable on this 
.article, cannot be obtained, from the want of authentic re- 
cords. That of baptifms is the only regifter, that has been 
•kept with any degree of accuracy. Indeed, the principal re- 
gifter of the parilh is faid to have been deflroyed, or carried 
off by a clerk, in revenge of a difference between him and 
fome of the heritors. There were in the parilh, on the ill of 
March 1791, males 645, and females 754*; in all, 1399 fouls.

Occupations. — In the inland parts, the people depend chief- 
ly on their farms for fubfiftence : But along the coaft, their 
chief fupport is from the fea. And there are fcarcely any 
handicraftfmen in the parifli, who do not occafionally follow 

the profeffion of farmers, or fifhermen f The women are 

generally employed in fpinning linen yarn, which they make 
of a good quality, though they cannot do a great quantity in 

a day. 



pafs, without fome young men going thither. A few have likewife gone of 
late to the fouth of Scotland, in queft of employment : But thefe laft cannot 
have much affedled the proportion, as feveral females have alfo gone thither, 
with the fame view. 

* It is generally believed, that the parifli has increafed in population within 
thefe 40 years ; and Dr. Webfter's report affords a proof of it. But it would 
appear, from the above averages of baptifms, that the difference is not confider- 
able. Yet there are unqueftioiiably great trads of common that have been 
peopled within that period. 

I The employment of fifhing feems to be a great bar to induftry in other 
branches, as it partakes too much of the nature of fport, as well as of labour. The 
fuccefs never being known till the experiment be made, one day's fuccefsful 
fifliing will prevent a week's application to any other bufinefs. Women, when 
hired by the day, draw from qd. to 6d., according to the work in which they are 
employed. — The wages to a man, per annum, is about 45s. ; and his allowance 
for food, is 3 bolls of oat-meal, at 8£ ftone per boll, and 3 bolls of bear-meal, at 
9 ftone per boll. A woman fervant's wages and allowance are about one half 
of the former. The wages of fervants, however, arc upon the increafe. Men, 
hired by the day, draw 8d. without maintenance : But as moft of the inhabitants 
ate fifhermen, it is very difficult to procure day labourers.

a day Some of them have of late begun to fpin on two. 
landed wheels, and are making aftonifhiug progrefs with 
them. 

Agriculture. -It is fuppofed, that there are about 1600 acres 
in cultivation in the parifli. The only grain cultivated is 
oats and bear, with a very fmall quantity of peafe. Of late, 
however, confiderable quantities of potatoes have been raifed, 
particularly in the farm of Dunnet, where the foil is well 
adapted to that root, the benefit of which was much felt in 
the late bad years. Small quantities of lint are raifed alfo in 
different parts. The quantity of grain raifed is fufficient to 
fupport the inhabitants, and admit of an export of about 533 
bolls of bear, and the fame quantity of oatmeal, per annum. 
Of the houfeholders, 194 occupy fmall farms. Moil of thefe 
have one plough, and a few of them two ; but the farms of 
fome are fo fmall, that two or three of them unite in furnifii- 
ing cattle, to labour their joint poffefiions. There are 190 
ploughs in the parifh, befides 14 on 4 farms laboured by the 
proprietors*. The tenants ploughs are generally drawn by 
4 horfes, or oxen, yoked a breaft. That pradice ^appears 
ridiculous to ftrangers : But a better acquaintance with the 
people's circuro fiances would lead to a more favourable opi- 
nion. The cattle are very fmall and ill fed ; and hence their 
ftrength is not fufficient for drawing a plough, if they were 
yoked in any manner, where part might have an opportunity 
of throwing the whole burden occafionally upon the reft. This 
praftice, however, is attended with the inconveniency, that 
one of the cattle muft walk on the plowed ground. Of this

agnculture, „ from the fcarcity of gra f s and prov J der a 
.defed that can never -be fupplied, till the inhabitants fee the 
.propriety of cultivating artificial^, and green crops. Nor 
would it be difficult to perfuade them of the advantage of 
thefe, were it not for their rooted prejudice againft winter 
herding. So far as they are not prevented by that preju- 
dice, they are beginning to afpire ,to the making of fmall 
wclofures about their boufes, and fowing them with clover 
and rye-grafs. Twenty years ago, there were not above 15 
carts in the parifli ; and now there are more than 4 times that 
number. Progrefs in improvement, however, mu ft be flow, 
while the farms are fo fmall, and fuch a number of wretched 
labouring cattle kept upon them. 

Black Cattle, Horfes and Sheep.— As the parifli is not weft 
Supplied with pafture, few cows can be kept by the farmers : 
.and hence there is feldom any cattle reared for exportation' 
A fupply of horfes from Orkney is needed annually. By the 
way, the greater part of Caithnefs, excepting the Highland 
parifties of Latheron, Halkirk, and Reay, is fupplied with 
horfes from Orkney ; and yet, what may appear Grange, very 
few breeding mares are kept in that county. They annually 
import feveral hundred colts, of 1 or 2 years old, from Strath- 
naver and the high lands of Caithnefs, and export their own 
horfes to Caithnefs, about the age of 6 or 8 years. That 
flan they follow fo regularly, that, in fome parts of Orkney, 
a dead horfe is thought a curiofity. Unhappily that is not 
the cafe in Caithnefs, and particularly in the pariih of Dun- 
net, where numbers every year fall a facrifice to age and po- 
verty. The greater part of the horfes, imported from Ork 



aey 



of Dunnet, 25^ 

Fniy, are landed at Scarfskerrj, about the Lammas feafon,- 
The fame boats that carry over the colts, generally return 
loaded with horfes* There are about 500 fheep in the pa- 
riftx, of a very indifferent quality ; a very ineonfiderable num- 
ber indeed, confidering the extent of pafture in Dunnet Head. 
But' as the proprietors have not, for many years, paid 
any attention to that objea, it is not poffible for the poor 
farmers to reap much advantage from it ; as the fheep there 
muft be expofed to many accidents, from the height of the 
rocks, and from the ravenous animals, if not properly 
attended. 

Heritors and Rent. — The parifli belongs to 3 heritors ; and" 
1 of thefe relide occafionally in it* The valued rent is 
1309I. 12s. 6d. Scotch j and the real rent about 950!, 
Sterling.

92I. Sterling, including the glebe. Sir John Sinclair of

* It has not been pofllble to afcertain an average, either of the export or im- 
port, with accuracy. But, from the beft information that can be got on the fub- 
jc5t, about 300 colts are annually imported into Orkney ; and fomewhat more 
than half as many horfes returned. Such as are carried to the north ifles of 
Orkney, fcldom return, but are allowed to remain there, till they die of old 
age, as in other parts of the kingdom.

School and Poor.— The fchoolmafter's falary is only 
61. 13s. 4d. Sterling ; and, as the emoluments from teaching, 
and other perquifites, are inconfiderable, it is not worth the 
acceptance of a perfon of education. The prefent teacher's 
knowledge extends only to reading Englifh, writing, and the 
common rules of arithmetic.- The parifh has the benefit of a 
Society fpinning fchool. And as the different parts of it are 
much detached from one another, it has been found convenient 
to have 3 or 3 private fchools, in the remotefl corners. At 
thefe different fchools there have been, for the laft 3 years, 
generally about 90 fcholars, male and female. The only lan- 
guage taught and fpoken is Englifh As the people are, in

"Rev. Dr. James Ofwald, who was a native of the parifh, and 
who fettled an annuity of 20I. Sterling, for charitable pur- 
pofes in it. 

Antiquities. — There are few natural curiofities in the parifli, 
•excepting a or 3 caves, in the rocks of Dunnet Head, and 
one at Ham. But as theaccefs to them is difficult, they have 
not been fufficiently examined to permit a defcription. None 
of them, however, excepting the laft, are fuppofed to be of 
great extent. Veftiges of 3 chapels are ftill vifible. One 
of thefe is fituated in Dunnet Head, and fuppofed to have 
been a place of penance. Two inner cells of Picls houfes 
are ftill entire at Ham. Thefe appear to be divided only 
by a ftone partition, 3 or 4 feet thick, probably hearted with 
earth*.

<p>Name, Situation, and Extent. 

"^nyHENCE or how this parifh obtained the name of 
Wattin, cannot be determined with any certainty. 
Perhaps it was from the large lake of that name, as thofc 
who pretend to an acquaintance with the Danifh fay, that the 
word Wattin, in that language, is the fame with water in ours. 
It is an inland parifli, fituated in the centre of the county of 
Caxthnefs. It is of confutable extent, ftretching, from S. 
to N., between 8 and 9 computed miles ; and, from E. to 
W., about 7.

and raoffes, of which there is great extent, it is for the mon: 
part very light — The air is fharp and pure, and the climate 
very changeable from heat to cold, from wet to dry, and from 
frefh to froft. Snow feldom lies for any length of time ; ne- 
verthelefs, the inhabitants are very healthy. 

River, Lakes, and Fijb, \$c — The fmall river Wich has its 
fource in the rifing grounds, which divide this parifli from that 
of Latheron. In its courfe, it is joined by 2 llreams ; the one 
riming from the lake of "Teftingall, lying on the S. W„ 
boundary ; the other from that of Wattin, lkuated nearly in 
the centre of the parifh. It is a large and beautiful fheet of 
■water, extending full 3 miles from E. to W., and nearly 2- 
from S. to N. Eels and trouts are caught in it. Sea fowls, 
and ducks of different kinds, frequent it. 

Population. — From the catechifing rolls, made up at differ- 
ent periods, it appears, that there has been a gradual decreafe 
in the population, within thefe 20 years.

This decreafe is partly to be afcribed to the more eafy and

wages of every kind are thought more inviting ; partly to 
the failure of crops 1782 and 1783, which forced many frorr* 
their native homes ; and partly to the growing extent of farms*

Heritors, Rent, and Poor — This parifh is the property rjfi 
9 heritors, 2 of whom only refide. — The valued rent amounts 
to 1939I. 4s. iod. Scotch.— Since 1782, the number upon the 
poor's roll has been greater, than at any period fince regular 
rolls appear to have been kept here. It cannot, however, be 
faid that their funds increafe in proportion. Our ordinary 
collections, at an average, do not exceed is. Sterling per 
Sabbath. Thofe, on facramental occafions, amount only to 
between 2I. and 3I. This, with the intereft of about iool., and 
the occafional fines paid by delinquents, are all that the poor of 
this parifh have to look to. And, were it not for the charity 
of their affluent fellow men, their wants would be infupport- 
able. All that thefe funds will admit of,, is, the price of a 
pair of fhoes to fome ; as much as will buy a coarfe covering 
to others j and what may purchafe a firlot or 6 pecks of meal,

non-refiding heritors in general. It is a duty incumbent up- 
on them to remember the poor, within the bounds of their re- 
fpeft.ve panffies, by contributing annually fomewhat for their 
fupport. Heritors draw a great part of the produce of their 
eftates, to fpend where they will, and at their uleafure ; whilft

the church was repaired in 1784; and thefchool-houfe is about

ferving the attention and encouragement of every enlightened 
nation. 

Occupations, Improvements, %Sc. — There being neither vil- 
lage nor manufactory within the bounds of this parifh, its in- 
habitants are all employed in the bufmefs of farming. Even 
our tradefmen (of whom there are fufficient numbers of every 
kind to fupply the demands of householders)", as well as our 
fervants, betake themfelves to that occupation, dividing their 
time between the labours of the field, and their, particular pro- 
feffions. As to our improvements in farming, it mud be al- 
lowed, we are ft ill greatly behind our fellow fubjects in the 
more fouthern counties. At the fame time, every one, capable 
of making the obfervation, fees, that confiderable progrefs has 
been made, during the courfe of 12 or 14 years paft. Now, 
the fpirit becomes daily more vigorous ; and, in a few years 
hence, large tracts will affume a different appearance. Nature 
has been uncommonly favourable to us. Our corn fields are, 
for the molt part, extenfive, though as yet, in many places, 
irregular. They hang, with an ea'fy declivity, from S. to N., 
and from N. to S. : And the moors and commons, though not 
rich, afford an extenfive pafture to fmall black cattle, flieep, 
and horfes, 

Produce — Bear and oats, with as many potatoes as are fuf- 
ficient to ferve the people, are the crops generally cultivated. 
Our oats are partly of the black, and partly of the grey 
kind : The former, weighing from 10 to i2f nones per boll, 
according to the foil and culture they meet with ; the latter 
from 7 to 8 ftones, and of a very poor quality. The only 
reafon, which can be affigned for continuing to fow them, is, 
that they fland almofl any wind. Several of the gentlemen 
farmers fow fome white oats; and, where the land is good, and

well prepared, they anfwer to their fatisfaftion. The gene- 
ra. /, however, of farmers are prejudiced againft them, from 
a belief that they ate not fo fruitful as either the black or 
grey ; befides being much more liable to be fhaken. 

Agriculture — Though this be the common plan of crop- 
ping, it is neverthelefs allowed, by every one fkilled in farm- 
ing, that our foil is exceedingly well adapted for greea crops 
of every kind. And, upon trial, it has been found to be the 
cafe. For feveral years pad, large fields have been laid down 
in grafs, turnips, peafe and beans ; all of which have anfwered 
the moft fanguine expectation. Trial is making juft now, 
whether wheat may not be raifed. Eight bolls were fown 
laft feafon ; and, though the winter has been very unfavour- 
able, it promifes fairly. Hedges, too, have the appearance of 
fucceeding to advantage. More vigorous healthy {hoots could 
not be defired, thanthofe to be feen growing around the ditches 
upon the Mains of Wattin. About 10 years ago, the out, 
lines of a large farm, on the S. fide of the loch, were laid with 
thorns ; and, though totally neglected, both as to cleaning and 
dreffing, feveral chains lengths, without a breach, have come 
to fuch perfection, as to be a fufficient fence againft all kinds 
of cattle. The fields under culture are much infcfted, both 
with top and root weeds. But this is owing to the eftabliflied 
mode of farming, and not to any natural tendency in the foil s 
The infield ground is perpetually under tillage. One year* 
a third part goes to bear, and the other two thirds to oats ; 
and fo on, in conftant rotation. The fmallnefs of their pof- 
feflions, and the uncertain tenor by which they hold them, 
prevents their attempting to fallow. Indeed, they have little 
inclination that way ; nor will their prefent circumftances per- 
mit them to undergo an immediate lofs, for the profpecT: of 
future gain. Without flock to begin upon* very few ever

get above the world. And this feems to be the pimcipal rea- 
son of their being fo averfe to hold their poffeffions by leafe. 
Unable to bear any great lofs, either by failure of crop or 
cattle, they think themfelves fafeft, when free to remove at any 
term they choofe, after finding matters likely to go againft 
them. And yet, notwithstanding of this, removals are by no 
means fo frequent* as might be expected. It is very common 
to fee the fon fncceed the father, and end his days within, 
the walls of the fame dwelling in which he was born. 

Farms, 12c.— The ordinary extent of farms, is from 12 to 26 
acres infield", 'from 2 to 6 outfield, from 1 to 2 meadow; off 
which they cut a fhort "kind of natural hay, with fome acres 
of pafture ground, and the liberty of common. The yearly 
rent of fuch poffeflions is from 2L to 3I. Se'rling, and from 6 
to 9 bolls oatmeal, at 9 or gl ftonesper boll. They likewife\ 
pay fome feet of cuftom peats, as they are called ; the number* 
almoft univerfally in proportion to the diftance they are at 
from the mofs ; from 8 to 12, or 13 fowls, with the cutting 
down of an acre, or an acre and a half of corn. Such fmall 
poffeffions, and there are very many below this extent, cannot 
afford much for the fubfiftence of the labourer and his family; 
and may be affigned as a reafon why the inhabitants in general 
are fo very poor. A fpirit for larger farms, however, now 
begins to break out amongft them. Several are venturing to 
join two into one. Unlimited fervices, fome time ago exacted 
almoft by every proprietor, are nearly abolifhed in this place. 
The abolition of this pfa&amp;ice, baneful in the higheft degree, 
both to the interefts and morals of the people, has made a very 
perceptible change, not only on their fpirit, but on their induf- 
try. Still, however, they require to be encouraged, if not 
nurfed by their landlords. Improvement, even in huibandry, 
is not to be expe&amp;ed, but by the labour of the aftual farmer.

Proprietors may trim up and adorn a few acres, around their 
own manfions, but it is only the judicious, diligent, perfevering 
efforts of the hufbandman, which extends improvement, and 
renders it beneficially lafling to the public at large. 

Method of Plowing. — Their yoke confifts of 4 beafts ; 
horfes, oxen, or cows, as they happen to have, or can afford 
them, all going abreaft, and drawing by theets. One treads 
conftantly upon the tilled land, another goes in the furrow, and 
two upon the Hubble, or white land. The perfon driving 
walks backwards, holding the cattle tied with halters, 
and taking care that each beaft has its equal fhare of the 
draught. This, though moft aukward to appearance, is a 
method of yoking, by which the creatures evidently feem to 
have moll power. Were they yoked in any other way, it does 
not appear that they would be able to draw a plough, with 
any thing like a furrow, after them. One, not accuftomed to 
their manner, upon looking at their pitiful fize, and lean con- 
dition, would not think they were able, many of them, fo far 
to blacken a rig (raife a furrow), as to cover the feed : Yet 
fome of them will turn over the mould to the depth of about 
4 inches ; and it is furprifing what good crops their fluffing 
labour produces, both of bear and oats. When the feafon is 
dry, a part of the ground is plowed, after the corns are ga- 
thered in, generally for the following bear crop. During the 
winter feafon, and the firft month of fpring, nothing without 
doors is done. The whole of their time is employed in 
threfhing down and manufacturing the crop. As foon as the 
weather fets in dry, and the land becomes fit for plowing, 
which generally is not before the beginning or middle of 
March, they are on the fields, labouring from morning to 
night. When once they begin, greater activity, or more per- 
fcverance, is not to be feen amongft any body of people. The

Seafons Vegetation here makes but flow progrefs during 

the firft part of the feafon. Until towards the fummer fol- 
flice, both corn and grafs make but a poor appearance. In- 
deed, as to the latter, few think of keeping off their cattle 
before they finifh their labouring; and many ftill permit them 
to traverfe, and feed even upon the fown land, till the bear 
feed is begun. But, when once cattle of every kind are care- 
fully kept off, and the night begins to lengthen, it is fur- 
prifing what vigour vegetation aflumes, and what quick pro- 
grefs it makes f . 

L 1 a Fuel. 

* About 40 years ago, few, if any, thought of plowing before the middle 
of March, even when the feafon was favourable. And, when they did begin, it 
was, for the mod part, with giving the firft furrow to their bear land. They ne- 
rer thought of laying down their oats before the middle of April ; and every 
one was defirous that the feed mould follow the plough as faft as poifible, But, 
ever fince the year 1785, they turn out at any time when the ground is fit for 
plowing, and are anxious to have the feed fown as foon as pofEble ; from a con- 
viction, that an early laying down is both fafeft and moft fubftantial. 

t Our harvefts are not fo late as might be expected, confidering how far 
north we lie. For feveral years paft, they have not been either fo early, or fo 
good, as they were wont to be. But this has not been peculiar to us. Lefs 
damage is fuftained here, by a rainy feafon, than in moft countries. High 
winds fometimes break down a good deal of corn, about the time they are 
nearly full ; but any thing confiderable of this kind feldom happens, our grain 
being of a hardy quality. To prevent lofs by rain, great care is taken to fe- 
«urc the corns, when cut, as foon as poffible. Little attention is paid, by the 
general run of farmers, to win the grain in the ftook. They are careful to cut 
when dry 5 and, if poflible, before it gets focked with rain, they put it together 
in very fmall (hcks, allowing it to lie in that ftate for feveral weeks. When 
deadened by lying in this manner, they lay it open a fecond time, by building it,

Fuel. — The labouring being ended, the next work which 
.comes on, is to make provision for winter firing. We have 
fuel in great abundance, and of an excellent quality. Cutting, 
winning, and carrying home their peats, however, confumea 
a great deal of time, notwithftanding they be at no great dis- 
tance from them, moil places having ready accefs to the ad- 
jacent moors and commons. Their labour, in this refpecl:, 
however, will become lefs, as they now tjegin to ufe carts 
even for that purpofe. As yet they are, in general, of a very 
trifling kind, though, at the fame time, tolerably well adapted 
to the fize of their cattle; and the principal ufe made of them, 
is to carry out their dung in the bear- feed feafon. Amongft 
the gentlemen and more fubftantial farmers, carts of a very- 
good fize are ufed ; fome drawn by horfes, others by 2 oxen^ 
and applied to all the purpofes of farming and carriages. 

Boufesy Cattle, Wc— After the peats are brought home, their 
next labour, is the repairing and trimming of their houfes : And 
this they are under the neceffity of doing annually. We have 
no wood growing ; and what is imported fells at a very high 
rate. This circumftance obliges the people to ufe as little of 
that article, in the conftruaion of their houfes, as poflible. 
Though their poffeffions be Ml, they keep a number of 
cattle, poorly fed, at all feafons. A farmer here, who rents 
only to the extent of 3I. and 9 bolls, makes a fhift to keep 
alive from 4 to 6 little horfes, from 16 to 20. head of black 
cattle, and from 20 to 30 head of fheep. This ftock (for, 
during all feafons, they are houfed in the night time, except 
their horfes, which, throughout the fummer, lie on the com.

mens and, in harveft, (land upon tether, during the night 
as well as day), requires confiderablc extent of houfing. 
Though heritors furniQi wood for the M eredion, or give 
allowance to the tenant upon his removal, Mill he is expofed 
t o confiderable expence. Seeing they hold their poffeffions 
without any leafe, and being themfelves but in ftraitened cir- 
cumftances, it is neither fafe nor convenient for them, dther 
to lay out money, or fpend a great deal of labour, for then- 
accommodation in the article of houfing. On thefe accounts, 
they themfelves, as well as their cattle, are but poorly accom- 
modated in that refpetf. The walls of their dwelling houfes 
confift of 2 or 3 feet of Hone, coarfely huddled together with 
3 or 4 feet of feal laid above them : Their roofs very thinly 
wooded, aud covered with the lighten; divots (or turfs) they 
can procure, tied down with ropes made of heather, to prevent 
blowing off by the wind. Barns, byres, and (tables, it may be 
believed, are not more elegant and fubftantial. Compofed of 
fuch coarfe materials, and put together with fo little art, they 
pannot be very lading, efpecially when expofed to the feverity 
of a boifterous climate, 

Bijlilleries Of late years, the greater part of their bear is 

diftilled by themfelves ; and, it is to be feared, too much of 
it is drank, without bringing what it otherwife might into 
their pockets. From the number of fmall ftills in the coun- 
try, they have an opportunity, as often as they choofe, of 
drawing 3 bolls of malt, upon paying the owner of the (till a 
certain confideration. This produce they difpofe of as they 
beft can; and, while they are employed in the manufacturing 
and difpofing of it, they have likewife an opportunity of 
tajling ; and thus lofing their time, and fpending part, at 
lead, of their profits. Neither their conftitutions, nor morals, 
are gainers by this new branch of bufinels, whatever advan-

tage it may bring to the revenue ; and it will bear a queftion, 
whether their profits are, upon the whole, much increafed 
by it. 

Commerce.— What quantity of grain, of the growth of 
this parilh, may be fodd, is impoffible to fay with certainty. 
There muft, however, be fomething confiderable, befides the 
viftual rent, which is at leaft the half of what is paid, and 
which feldom, if ever, falls to be exported. The Weft 
Highlands is the common market. Indeed, it requires no 
fmall quantity of grain to maintain the inhabitants f. Befides 
what viftual they may difpofe of, after paying their rents, 
and maintaining their families, which is more or lefs in pro- 
portion to the extent of their farms, and the number of eaters, 
they fell annually i, 2, or 3 young cattle, as they can fpare. 
Thefe being poorly fed, at all feafons, bring but little money, 
And when no demand comes from the South, they are at a 
3ofs to difpofe of them, owing chiefly to the narrownefs of 
the country. The general run of (lots and queys, reared 
here, from 3 to 4 years old, feldom fetch above 30s. or 40s., 
according to their fize and fliape. Milk cows and labouring 
oxen, particularly the latter, give a tolerable price, and, of 
late years, have rifen greatly in their value. Horfes, confi- 
dering their fmall fize, fell exceedingly high. This circum- 
ilance is juft beginning to induce gentlemen, and fome of the 
more fubftantial farmers, to ufe a larger fize than the original 
breed of the country. Inftead of 4 garrtms, as they are here 
called, drawing a plough, 1 tolerable fized horfes are ufed by 
feveral. From the great number necefiary to carry on work 
of every fort, agreeable to the practice of the country, they

do not rear fo many as are needed. Indeed, from fome mif- 
taken notions, they feldom keep what they rear, till they are 
fit for the purpofes of labour. When about a year old, they 
are fold, and carried into the Orkneys ; from whence they are 
brought back, in their prime, and fold again at a very high 
rate. Strathnaver, too, furnilhes a good many horfes and 
mares for the accommodation of this quarter. 

Sheep The few flieep they may have to difpofe of, are 

confumed, either in the towns of Wick and Thurfo, or in the 
families around. Indeed, that ufeful animal does not profper 
here fo well as could be wilhed. The moors, mofles, and 
commons are, it is thought, too wet for them. But, befides 
this natural difadvantage, they are not fo well taken care of, 
as they ought and deferve to be. The pafture is not only 
poor, but greatly overftocked : and they are, all the year 
round, confined, during the night time, in very low clofe huts- 
The winter feafon, too, is changeable, boifterous, and rainy. 
Thus expofed, upon bare open fields, without any thing na- 
tural or artificial to ihelter them, numbers often die, during 
the courfe of winter and fpring, of what are here called the 
rott, pock, and fcab. 

Manufa&amp;ures — The only thing, befides corn and cattle, 
which brings any money amongft us, is a little fpinning, for 
the manufacturers in fome of the more fouthern counties. 
This, by the by, is but a mere trifle. Our women, perhaps, 
are more employed in the field, for at leaft 8 months in the 
year, than in moll other places of the kingdom. This affords 
the generality of them but little time for making any thing 
confiderable by that branch of bufinefs. Almofl: every family, 
too, fows what linfeed they think will anfwer the purpofes 
of their own wearing. The produce thereof, and the fmall

parcel of wool which their few flieep yields, exhaufts the 
greater part of tj*e time they can fpare, from the labour of 
their little farms. No fmall lofs is fuftained by the country 
at large, that more cloth, efpecially woollen, is not made 
amongfl them. 

Minerals, &amp;c. — This corner is capable of very great improve- 
ment. Befides the natural quality of the foil already under 
tillage, there are vaft traces of ground fit to yield crops of every 
kind, at little or no expence. It requires only to be plowed 
up and reduced.* In different places, confiderable quantities 
of marie have been found ; and in fome, lime-ftone, of a very 
excellent quality, though difficult to work. In general, the 
country abounds with it. 

Prejudicial Cujloms From our remote fituation, and little 

intercouife with other countries, we have hitherto been neglett- 
ed, if not defpifed. Of late, ftrangers have begun to creep in 
amongfl; us ; and a little time will convince, both ftrangers 
and natives, that our remote fituation is by no means fo un- 
friendly, either to happinefs or iniereft, as has too ^generally 
been believed. No douht there are local practices, and local 
prejudices amongfl: us, which require to be laid afide, before 
great improvement can take place, or ftrangers refide with 
real comfort to themfelves. From time immemorial, it had 
been the praftice here, for cattle of all kinds to travel and feed 
promifcuoufly, without diftinftlon of property, from the day 
the laft Iheaf was put into the farm-yard, till the concluuon 
of the bear feed, in the end of May, or beginning of June 
The prejudice this pradice is of, to land in general, but to 
arable land in particular, is now feen by many, and begins to be 
abolifhed. Few men will obftinately perfift in prejudices or 
cuftorns, when they are judicioufly expofed, and fhewn to be 

contrary

contrary to their intereft. Still, however, the generality are 
againft winter herding. And it is matter of great regret to 
every friend of improvement in agriculture, that the laws re-* 
fpechng that practice are not univerfally enforced and obferv- 
ed. The a&amp;ive enterprifing farmer can never avail himfelf, 
of all the c dvantages to he derived from his pofleffion, unlefs 
he be at liberty to ufe and lay it out as he pleafes. He can 
never benefit himfelf, either by fallow or green crops, fo long 
as cattle of every kind, his neighbours as well as his own, 
are at freedom, for 8 months, nearly, out of 12, to traverfe 
his fields, day and night, wet and dry. Such a cuftom may, 
and, no doubt does, profit the Jluggard. His cattle are half 
maintained almoft at the expence pf his neighbours. But 
men of this description ought not to be fupported, at the ex- 
pence of the willing, induftrious farmer, His fpirited endea- 
vours to provide for himfelf, and ferve the public, ought 
not to be rendered abortive, merely to gratify the indolence 
of the floven ; who, rather than exert himfelf in conftant ads 
of induftry, is contented to live in a hovel, to be clothed in 
rags, and to feed upon bread and water. 

Roads, %3e. — Another circumflance, which greatly retards 
the improvement of this place, is the want of good roads. 
Some attention, indeed, has been paid to this firft and moil effen- 
tial Hep towards improvement. Our roads, in general, have 
been lined out, and fomething done upon them, reluctantly, 
by theftatute labour of the people. By thefe means, we have 
a more plain and direft tract, during the dry feafon of the, 
year, to the ports of Wick and Thurfo, for travellers, as well 
as riders and carts : But from this neglect, and the inefficient, 
manner in which they are executed, they become fo foft after 
rain, and are fo blown by the froft, that in many places, dur* 
ing winter and fpring, the beft horfes are not fit to drag a cart 

Vol. XI. M m w i t h 



2 74 Statj/lical Account 

with fafety. This circumflance renders the carriage of grain, 
wood, and indeed every other article, tp and from port ex- 
tremely difficult and tedious. From the narrownefs of their 
farms, they can keep only horfes of a very fmall fize ; which, 
with the badnefs of their roads, obliges them to make feveral 
journies, where one might otherwife ferve. Every thing, by 
thefe means, muft be carried on horfe-back, and that, too, in 
very fmall quantities. 

Character Sjfc.^—Fond of drefs, rather to excefs, too much 
of their earnings, particularly of the younger part of both 
fexes, goes to gratify their fancy in that refpect ; and it is not 
always with the bed or mod fubftantial articles of any kind, 
that they are fupplied. Being naturally of a fprightly turn, 
what appears the moft fhowy gains their choice; and, while 
it pleafes for a little, its fervice is foon at an end. This lively 
turn, is, perhaps, one reafon why our young men, in general, 
fhow fuch a relifh for a military life. No fooner does a recruit- 
ing party make their appearance, than numbers, even before 
they are fit fo carry arms, are willing to inliit. Wages, it 
mufl be allowed, do not bear a proportion with what is given 
in more fouthern counties ; but thefe, like every other thing, 
are daily increafing*. Sripplings now get more than 30s. per 

half 



* About 15 "or 20 years ago, a man fervant, qualified for all the pur- 
pofes of farming, did not look for mere than 18s. or aps per half year, with 
3 bolls fubfiftence, half oat, half bear meal; the former at 8$ ftones per boll, 
tlie latter at 9 done. Women, qualified for tending cattle throughout the win- 
ter, driving the plough, and filling the dung cart in fpring, had only about 
8s. Sterling, with juft half the fubfiftence allowed the man. Why fo little 
fubfiftence was and ftill is allowed to women, no good reafon can be affigned. 
Eftablifhed cuftoms cannot always be accounted for, nor are they wfily or fud- 
denly overturned. This article of wages, however, has of late rifen, and ftill 
continues to incrcafe.

half year, and the better qualified nearer to 40s., with the old 
allowance for fubfiltence ; and the women from 12s. to 15s. 
Neverthekfg, numbers of both fexes annually leave the place, 
in hopes of higher wages, and in the belief that better living 
is to be had elfewhere, than what they are accu domed to at 
home.

(County and Synod of Argyll— Prejbytery of Kintyre.} 
By the Rev. Mr. John M'LlESH, Minijler.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, and Extent. 

TRADITION fays, that Chomanus was fent from the 
monaftery of Icolumkill, by St Columbus, to plant the 
gofpel in Iflay, and being buried in this place, gave name to 
the parilh of Keil-choman. It is fituated in the ifland of 
of Iflay, is ao miles long, and 6 broad, and is of a peninfu- 
lar form ; as Lochgrunart and Locbindale, two arms of the 
fea, cut deep into the country. 

Coafi, Harbours, and Surface.— -The more, to the W., is 
rough and bold, affording no anchoring ground ; but Lochin- 
dale, to the E., is a fair fpacious harbour, with a fine quay 
at the village of Bowmore; and very much frequented, as the 
fea, to the W. of Iflay, in ftormy weather, is very rough, 

rifing 



of Kitcbontan. 277 

riling literally mountain high. A ridge of moor lands, fa- 
mous for grazing, runs through the parifh. 

Soil, Produce, Exports, r.-The ground ail around the 
coaft is arable, producing corn and barley, flax and potatoes. 
The foil is of different qualities; mofs, clay, loam, and fand ; 
but no other crops are raifed, owing to the open ftate of the 
country. Shell, fand, and fea-weed are made ufe of for ma. 
nure, as there is no lime-flone in the parifh. Thefe are found 
to give good crops, and to mend the grafs : When mixed 
with mofs, they prove an excellent compoft. Large fields o£ 
potatoes are annually raifed by it, which is very fortunate, 
for the poorer fort of people, who can get no other manure, 
and who live upon potatoes and fifh for three fourth* of the 
year. The rearing barley and flax is much pradifed by the 
common tenantry, who by thefe make up the greater part of 
their rent, yarn being one of our principal exports. The 
produce of the country, in good feafons, is fufficient to fup- 
port its inhabitants ; but, in bad feafons, they have been ob- 
liged to import a good deal of meal. 

Cultivation, \3c— Of late, the farmers have got into the 
way of fowing early oats, which gives them an earlier har- 
veft ; for our crops have been often much hurt by the winds 
and rains, that fet in from the W. early in autumn. Seed- 
time commences about the aid of March ; and by the middle 
of October all the crop is generally got in. The broad 
Scotch plough, with 4 horfes, is moft generally in ufe. There 
are feveral tackfmen in the parifh, who employ cottagers to 
work their farms, and tend their dairy. This mull be the 
cafe with gentlemen who have large farms, as it would be 
impofuble to take fervants into their houfes to carry on all 
their bufmefs ; and as there m.ay be fome of them, whofe 

circumftances 



2 7^ Statijiical Account 

circumftances enable them to be above taking f uc h druj* 
upon themfelves. 

Climate and Difeafes.-^Om climate is the fame with that 
of other maritime places. If we hare our wefterly winds and 
rains, we are free of the frofts and fnovvs of the eaft% mow 
never continuing above a day or two with us. An inftance 
of the wholefomenefs of that climate, may be feen in the 
healthfulnefs of our people, who are feldom or never vifited 
with any epidemical diftemper, and generally live to a good 
age. The fmall pox, which ufed to make avail devaftation, 
is now eafily got over by inoculation ; one furgeon having, 
laft feafon, performed that operation upon more than 8oo 
children, very few of whom died. Some people advanced in 
years were alfo inoculated, with good effects. The poor 
were inoculated gratis, and the operator enjoys their blefling. 

Wild Animals — Any one, that has a right to keep a gun 
and dog, may find plenty of game here ; fuch as partridges, 
woodcocks, blackcocks, moorfowl, plovers, wild geefe and 
ducks, and wild pigeons j alfo otters, rabbits, and hares, fea 
and land barnicles. 

Black Cattle.^-The rearing of cattle is a principal ob- 
jeft with the gentlemen of May, who have* the merit of 
having brought the May cattle to vie with the beft of their 
neighbours at market, and to be much run upon. The farm- 
ing bufinefs may be purfued to advantage in May ; but black 
cattle have been its greateft riches of late years. There are 
about 800 of thefe annually fold out of this parifti, at the 
avarage price of 3I. 15s.; they are carried by drovers to Dum- 
barton and Falkirk, and even to England, occafionally. 

Horfcsz, 



of Kilchoman. 279 

Horfes. We are faid to keep too many horfes, which is a 

gainfl the fyflem of black cattle: Yet thefe horfes bring a good 
deal of money into the country, the Irilh being very fond of 
them, as they are neat lively creatures, and fit for the faddle. 
Our manner of hufbandry requires alfo a good many horfes, 4 
being yoked in each plough ; and peats, corn, and fulzie car- 
ried home on horfeback. As the country is champaign, and 
the roads good, an Iflayman will fcarce ftir from home with- 
out his pad. 

Sheep It is much to be wiflied, we had got more into the 

rearing of fheep than we have, as the country would anfwer 
them well ; and the higher lands would be excellent fheep 
walks, being green to the top, and there being no foxes or other 
vermin to deltroy them. The tenantry content themfelves, 
however, with rearing no more than ferves their own families : 
Hence mutton and wool fell high. 

Population By a late enumeration, the number of inha- 
bitants in this parifli amounts to 2300 

The population in 1755 is uncertain. Dr. Webfter fays, 
that the ifland of Iflay contained then only the two parifhes 
of Killarow and Kildalton ; under which, it is probable, that 
Kilmenie and Kilchoman were included. We are enabled, 
however, to ftate the exact increafe of population in the 
whole ifland; as the total number of people in Iflay, at 
prefent, amounts to above - 95 00 
From which deducting the return, in 

1755, from Killarow, " " 1761"! 

And that from Kildalton, - - 3583 j " 5344

Employments, &amp;.c. — The inhabitants are all employed in the 
farming and graling line, there being no manufactory eftablifh- 
ed in the country j but they are well fupplied with tradef- 
men, in the common and moft neceffary arts, who make a 
good livelihood of it. Travelling merchants gather our yarn, 
and bring home our flax-feed, grocery goods, and rather too 
many jineries. But our people like to appear to advantage. 
There are about 80 hogftieads of flax-feed annually imported 
into the parifli ; the cultivation of which, and manufacturing 
the produce, conftitute the principal bufinefs in the ifland. The 
people are much more given tb the making of linen, than 
woollen cloth, this being a flaxen country. Many of the gen- 
teeler families keep weavers employed for themfelves, all the 
y«ar through. The Highland drefs has not made fuch rapid 
progrefs among us, as with our neighbours to the N. We 
are more clad in the long coat, hat, and breeches, than the in- 
habitants of any of the Hebrides. Befides the fcarcity of 
wool, there is another, and indeed a very great difadvantage, 

that 

- No regular regifter of burials has been kept, on account of the great num- 
ber of burial places in the parifh. On occafions of baptifms, marriages, and 
burials, the expence incurred borders on extravagance, through a filly com- 
..ucc with the old fafhion.

{hat May lies under, by a fcarcity of wood ; timber being 
brought from the northern lakes, at a very high price, and 
difficult to obtain even for it, owing to the great demand for 
charcoal. Hence implements for hufbandry, houfe-building, 
and carpentery bufinefs, come to be very expenfive. 

Fijheries, Fuel, &amp;c.-^Bat if the fea has bared our coun- 
try of wood, it has filled its coafh with fifli. Lochindale 
affords all kinds of fea fifh, and Portnahaven, a fifhing village, 
in the Rinns of Iflay, is famous for its cod fifliing : And for 
their encouragement, Mr. Campbell of Shawfield has given 
them fome boats, lands, and timber for houfes. Another very 
great advantage, we have, is, that no country is better fupplied 
with fire and wr.ter. Almoft every farm has peatmofs within 
itfelf, of an excellent kind. 0F Tding charcoal for the fmith, as 
•we have no coals. Thefe peats, with the filh oil they bum 
in lamps, make the habitation of the meaneft cottager warm 
and cheery. As to our waters, there are alembics enough to 
make them light and wholef me. They are remarkably good 
for bleaching, which the clearnefs of our linens can fhow ; 
and it is probable the bleaching bufinefs might be profecuted 
with great advantage in Iflay, 

Lake and Ijland, — There are no waters in the parifh that 
deferve the name of rivers. There is one lake, which covers 
about 100 acres of land, and is well fupplied with fine trouts. 
There are feveral brge oak trees at the bottom of it, which 
fhews the country was once under wood. In this lake, there 
is a fmall ifland, fort'fied very ftrong. Its baftions are all 
entire. To this fort, it is faid, M'Donald of Islay betook 
himfelf in his difficulties*. Now the owls of the defert nettle

Roads and Bridges.— .None of the Weftern lues can boaft 
of fuch good roads and bridges as May. The inhabitants are 
every year called out to work upon them ; and any gentleman 
may drive for 30 miles through the ifle in his carriage. To 
complete the line, our communication with the main more 
is kept up by a packet, which goes and returns regularly 
every week, with the mail, paffengers, and goods on board. 
This packet has 40I. of falary from the country, and 30I. 
from government. The expence of government is more than 
defrayed by the port-office here, as feafaring people, along 
with thofe in the country, fend a great many letters through 
that channel. 



Proprietor and Rent. — Mr. Campbell of Shawfield is 
proprietor of the whole ifland, and poffeffes one of the beft and 
moft compact eftates, enjoyed by any commoner in Britain. 
On the forfeiture of the M'Donalds, May, Jura, and the lands 
of Muckairn, were made over to Campbell of Calder, who 
was then a favourite at court, on condition of his paying 
500I. yearly of a feu-duty out of Iflay, which is the reafon 
of the duty being fo high ; and Calder fold all thefe lands 
again to Shawfield, for 1 2,oool. ; which, if the rage for rent- 
ing land continues, will, by and by, be the income from it. 

Church. 

the mofc remarkable erent of this diftricl. M'Lean, being married to M'Don- 
ald's daughter, was to have part of Iflay as her portion ; but the treaty not be- 
ing implemented, be came from Mull with 1400 of his cian, to force M'Donald 
to a compliance. M'Donald, with IOOO of his tribe, gave him battle, and des- 
troyed the flower of his army. M'Lean himfelf was killed with an ar.ow, and 
lies interred in the kirk of Kilchoman. A favage courtfnip indeed ! but fuch 
were the times ! It is not certain how long the M'Donalds maintained their 
dominion in Iflay, and other places, after that xn ; but furc it i», that, by their 
leHlefs diipofition, they at lalt forfeited them. 



of Kllchoman* 283 

€lurch. — The church* now made ufe of, ftands in the 
middle of the parifli. The minifter goes occafionally to the 
ikirts of it, and preaches for more than one half of the year, 
in both languages ; a duty which nene but the clergy in the 
Highlands have to go through. He has 50I. of ftipend, a 
glebe, and manfe-money, with 5I. for communion elements j 
has been fettled 10 years in the parifli, and is married to his 
predecefibr's widow, by which her children drew 200I. out of 
the widow's fund. The King is patron of all Iflay, and draws 
5C0I. yearly feu-duty out of it. All the inhabitants belong 
to the Eftablifhed Church. There are 4 parifties, but only 3 
minifters in the ifland, notwithstanding the great number of 
the inhabitants. 

Schools — The parochial fchool is taught in the church. 
There are at prefent about 40 fcholars attending it. The 
matter has 100 merks of yearly falary, with dues from 
chriftenings and marriages. There are feveral other fchools in 
different parts of the parifli ; the mailers of which are main- 
tained and paid by the contributions of individuals. An in- 
duftrious good fchoolmafter is a moil valuable member of fo- 
ciety, and much needed in this parifli, to affift in guarding the 
youth from the errors of Popery, as we are juft in the very 
neighbourhood of Ireland. A fourth minifter is alfo much 
to be wiflied for in the ifland ; as, upon fome occafions, 3 
clergymen have to difpenfe the facrament to no fewer than 
xaoo communicants.

Improvements. — One other ciicumllance that dtferves to bq 
noticed, in the hiftory of lflay, is the attention that has of late 
been effected in the police of it. Changes and improvements, 
in all countries, take their rife from the fpirited exertions of 
particular individuals, who feem born for the purpofe of rouf- 
ing the multitude from a Hate of ignorance and torpqr. 
Within thefe dozen of years, the prefent proprietor has more 
than doubled his rents ; yet the tenantry, as well as himfelf, 
are better off than ever. They have given him, as it were, 
an addition to his eflate, by relcuing many acres, of moor and 
mofs, from a ftate of nature, and bringing them to yield 
good crops of corn and grafs. On the other hand, the pro- 
prietor has given the tenants fuch advantageous leafes, that 
they have greatly bettered their circumftances, as well as in- 
creafed their numbers, and are enabled to live much more 
comfortably than formerly. And indeed they are fo fenfible 
of the advantages they enjoy, and are in general fo contented 
with their lituation, that very few have emigrated from the 
illand: And the farms of thole who have, have never con- 
tinued long mipofkffed. When tenants are emancipated from 
the avarice of mouopolifers, they feem to breathe a purer air, 
and improvements go on rapidly 3 for nothing has tended more 
to excite the ipirit of ..migration, than the Demon of Monopoly, 
which leads the avaricious to add land to land, and farm to 
farm. The writer of this article, cannot approve of the maxim, 
u That the more rents you by on, the tenants .will -work the 
better." This, like the Egyptian bondage, is exacting bricks 
without ftraw, and tends to check, rather than incite, the fpmt 
rf induftry. But if the moderation and lenity, that have 
hitherto been obferved in Klay, continue to be adhered to, we 
may venture to promife, that the people will rather flay at 
home, to improve the lands of their native ifhnd, than go 
abroad to cultivate the wilds of America. Amen I

CharaBer and Manners—So objeaion can be made againfl 
their naturaVparts and abilities, which are fubtle and ingenious, 
They are fond of their own country, and are not much addift- 
ed to enlifting in the army or navy. They marry young, and 
are greatly combed by intermarriages, which mutt always 
be the cafe with infular fixations ; and yet they are very Rind 
to all ftrangers, who come to refide among them, or vifit them. 
They are in general as contented with their fituation .as moil 
people, as they have the comforts and conveniences of life in a 
reafonable degree. The Gaelic is the general language of the 
common people - 7 yet Englifti is pretty well underftood, and 
taught in all our fchools. The dance and the fong, with 
fhinty and putting the ftone, are their chief amufements. 
Numbers of them play well on the violin and bagpipe. They 
have a natural eafe and gracefulnefs of motion in the dance, 
which is peculiar to themfelves. The gentlemen, once a year, 
treat the ladies with a ball, where cheerfulnels and propriety 
of conduct, always prefide ; and more elegance of manners 
are to be feen, than could well be expected in fo remote a

(County and Synod of ArgyU—PreJhytery of Kintyre.) 
By the Rev. Mr. Archibald Robertson, Minijter.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, and Extent. 

THE name of this pariQi is probably derived from fome 
eminent perfon who had been the firft that was buried 
here. It is fituated on the S. E. end of the ifland of May, 
and extends along the fea more, from the Moille of Keann-outh, 
to MCarture's Head, near the entry of the Sound of lflay 
from the E. It is above 15 miles in length, and about '6 in 
breadth. 

Soil, Cultivation, Roads, &amp;c — There is great variety in the 
foil over all the parifli; for, in the fame farm, you will find a 
very poor, light, fandy foil, and fome very good ground, 
that would produce a rich crop, if it had tillage and manure. 
There is fome clay ground, and a great quantity of mofs. 
But the great lofs, in this country, is, that the fmall tenant 
are almoft every year plowing down all their arable ground; 
and they feldom manure any ground, except for potatoes and 

3 barley - } 



of Klldallon. 2S7 

fcafley j fo that they cannot have a good crop of oats. The 
gentlemen farmers, again, employ almoft their whole time in 
rearing good black cattle, and lay out their fine arable ground 
in feeding them ; in confequence of which, the cultivation of ' 
grain is very little attended to. All the farmers here plow 
with 4 horfes, excepting a very few, who, having light ploughs, 
employ only 2. The reft make ufe of heavy clumfy ploughs,, 
of their own manufacture. They carry out their manure in 
fmall creels on horfeback, and they bring home their peats in 
the fame manner ; whereby much time is fpent in doing very 
little work. This is partly owing to the want of good public 
roads ; for the inhabitants only work at them 2 days in the 
year, and the ftatute labour is never commuted. They do 
little or nothing for the reparation of private roads. It is 
much to be wifhed, that the tenants knew the value of good 
roads, and that they would employ carts to manure the 
ground, as they do in the next pariih, where they have a 
good public road, which is upheld at a fmall expence to the 
tenants. The people of Killarow are encouraged to improve 
a little in agriculture, by the example of Mr. Campbell of 
Shawfield, who is one of the bed farmers in the weft of Scot- 
land : And perhaps his Iflay eftate is capable of as much im- 
provement as any in the kingdom. 

Inclofures — There is only a very fmall part of this parifn 
inclofed ; and the large parks, that the principal tenants have 
made, are employed for feeding their young black cattle in 
winter. Thefe parks are very feldom, if ever, plowed ; and 
in harveft no beaft is fed in them, as they are kept for winter 
grals. The parifti might eafily be inclofed, for we abound in 
Hones ; and the want of inclofures is feverely felt in this pa- 
lifh, where we are ib much expofed to every wind that blows,

and where We lofe fo much grain in antumn by fhaking w?nd«»' 
But we want money and the fpirit for agriculture; for if we 
had a real defile of improving our lands, we might live com- 
fortably, and be of great ufe to fociety. 

Produce.-— The tenants fovv yearly about 28 hogfheads of 
flax-feed ; but the quantity of oats, barley and potatoes, that 
are fown here, cannot be known, becaufe the farmers feldom 
meafure any thing that they fovv. The number of ploughs 
employed here, is more or lefs, according to the feafon. When 
we have a great quantity of rain in fpring, which is often the 
cafe, we are obliged to employ more ploughs, in order to 
,fmifh the work of the field early ; for a late harveft is very 
dangerous in this ifland, where we have fuch a deluge of rain 
in the end of autumn. 

Imports and Exports. — This parifh imports annually meal, 
fait, fugar, tea, iron, flaxfeed, green hides, and other goods, 
to a considerable amount. The chief articles exported, are 
black cattle, horfes, and linen yarn ; for the women here are 
.always employed in fpinning, excepting a few weeks during 
harveft.- 

Harbours. — There are many anchoring places along this 
fhore, where fmall veffels may befafe in time of danger. One 
of thefe is about 3 miles to the S. W. of the Sound of May, 
and is known by the name of Loch-Knock. The name is taken 
from a very high hill, which rifes in the figure of a fugar 
loaf, near the head of the lake or bay, and is the firft part of 
this end of the ifiand, that is feen by mariners, when they are at 
a great diftance from the fhore. There are two very large 
flag ftones erected near this lake. They are placed about 34

feet from each other, and they are called the Two Stones of 
Ijlay*. 

l/lands, \3c There are alfo a few fmall iflands on each 

fide of this entry to the lake. Strangers fhould therefore be 
very careful to keep at a proper diftance from thefe iflands, 
when near this fhore, as they are very near the main ifland. 
There is another anchoring place, about 3 miles to the S.W. 
of Loch-Knock, which is known by the name of Laga- 
mhuilin. There are 3 ways of coming to this anchoring place, 
which is Oppofite to a fmall village, and they ufually cait 
anchor near a quay, that lies below this village. The entry 
next the manfe, on the W. fide of the bay, is the beftf. The

* The common tradition concerning thefe ftones is, that a daughter of one 
of the kings of Denmark was buried here, whofe name was Yhla ; and that 
from her this ifland was called Is lay, or Is la; which feems to be the more 
probable, that a Highlander pronounces' both thefe words nearly in the fame 
manner. 

f On the E. fide of this place there is a tower, or caflle, known by the name 
of Dun-naomhaig. This caftle is built on a large rock, which is furrounded 
by the fea on all fides, except the N. There are (till, on the N., the remains of 
many old houfes, that had been built for barracks and ftorehoufes. Some of the 
cellars, and a baker's houfe, are ftill vifible here. There is a very ftrong wall on 
the W. fide, between the caftle and the barracks ; and the fide walls of a large 
gate are ftill ftanding. This gate is called the Iron Gate ; and it is reported 
here, that the fort was fupplied with water from a fmall river, that runs paft the 
end of the marife; and that it was conducted in pipes, under the fea, acrofs this 
bay, to the diftance of about half a mile. There is a large ftone room ori the 
top of the fort ; and here the gun ports are entire, On the N. fide of this room 
there is an earthen mound, which is very thick ; and it appears to have been 
built up to the top of the fort, as a kind of defence to that part of the building j 
for the N. is the only place where an enemy could make an attack on this fort. 
There is a high hill on the W. fide of the bay, oppofite to this fort, where ther 
was alfo a tower, for the defence of Dun-naomhaig ; and as both pi

church now employed for public worfliip is at this place ; 
and the village contains ioo fouls. There is, to the W. 
of this place about 2 miles, aa ifland, called Texa and, 
on the N. fide, a very good place for anchoring large fhips. 
The anchoring is oppofite to an old chapel, that is about the 
middle of the ifland. Thofe who are ftrangers here, fhould 
keep, if poffible, at the diftance of a mile from the W. end 
of this ifland, when they are going through the found, between 
this and the main ifland, or when- they are obliged to caft 
anchor ; as there is a ridge of rocks that lie out from the 
W. end, until you are on a level with the N. fide of this 
ifland. The E. end of the ifland is free from rocks, and the beft 
ground for anchoring is near the fhore. This ifland is near 
a miles in length, and above \ mile in- breadth. There is 
good pafture in this fmall ifland ; and there is a burying- 
place around the chapel, the walls of which are partly 
{landing. There are the remains of other 2 or 3 chapels in 
this parifh, where they were formerly wont to bury thofe 
who were of the popilh religion ; but the whole inhabitants 
of this parifh now belong to the Eftablifhed Church ; fo that 
there are none now buried at thefe chapels, unlefs when a 
ft ranger happens to die here, who is of the Roman Catholic 
religion. 

Bays and Rocks, l$c. — A little to the N.W. of this ifland, 
there is a bay, called the Lowdinas, where many fmall veffels 
may anchor ; for it is large, and well fheltered on all fides but 
the S. The whole of thefe anchoring places are very dan- 
gerous 

mile from each other, it was an eafy matter to prevent fmall veffels from coming 
to this place; for no veffels that draw above 6 or 7 feet water, can come here 
at any time. It is faid, that the M'Donalds of May lived here about the be- 
ginning of the laft century. There are a great many forts and building, 
alfo within a few miles of this place.

serous for Grangers to come into, becaufe all of them are fur- 
rounded with large rocks, that run along the whole coaft, and 
in many places jut out into the fea 3 or 4 miles ; and fome of 
them are vifible, others not. When Grangers are obliged to 
take flielter here from a ftorm, they mould, if poffible, get 
out fome boat from the &amp;ore, that they may have fome of the 
natives of the :fland to pilot them through thefe rocks, and to 
conduft them into the beft ground for anchoring. The in- 
habitants here are very ready to perform this fervice to all 
Grangers, if it lies in their power to give them affiftance. 
There are many other creeks along this coaft, into which the 
natives run with their fmall boats j but flrangers are in very 
great danger, when they venture into any of thofe creeks, be- 
caufe many of them are full of funk rocks. There is a place 
called hun-Aidh, where a Danifh fort was formerly built. 
The rock on which this fort flood is very large, and its height, 
from the bottom of the fea, is very extraordinary. The top 
of the rock is now covered with grafs ; for there is no ap- 
pearance of any building now remaining. The wall, on the 
N. fide, is nearly covered with earth, and the whole N. fide 
is fine pafture for fheep. There is more than an acre of ground 
between the top and the N. fide of this rock. There is a deep 
valley both on the W. and the E. of this rock ; and the 
afcent is fo very fteep on each fide, that it is almoft impoffible 
for any man to creep up upon his hands and feet to the 
top. No ordinary gun is fuppofed to be capable of carrying 
a ball from the bottom of this valley to the top of the rock*. 

O02 There. 



* It is faid, that the only way of accefs up to it was on the very edge o£ 
this great valley ; and that there was a cave made here, where a few men were 
hid ; who, when they faw any perfon coming near the entry, either killed them 
from the cave, or drove them over the precipice, whereby they were da&amp;ed to 
pieces before they reached the bottom of this immcnie valley.

There is a part of a wall yet {landing, in a place that is norc 
very dangerous to approach. This wall is about 18 feet 
thick. The fea, almoft every day, dafhes againft it in a mod 
tremenduous manner ; for this place is very near the Moile of 
Cheunti-Outh, and it is the mod dangerous place in this parifh 
lor any veflel to come near. All the farms round this fort 
have Danifh names, fuch as Kennibus, Jlflibus, Kelibus, Lire- 
hus, and Cragabus. 

Lakes, Hills, &amp;c. — There are 4 lakes in this end of the pa- 
rifh, and there are alfo fome lakes in the high mountains be- 
longing to it ; but they are of little ufe to the people here, 
who have almoft their whole fifh from the fea ; only thofe 
who are near thefe lakes may fometimes catch a few trouts 
in them. The mountainous part of the parifh is very ex- 
tenfive, and part of it is a common to all the tenants, where 
they pafture their ftrong black cattle and horfes in fummei, 
and a part of autumn. Some parts of thefe mountains are 
barren and wet; but there is fome dry foil, where fheep might 
find good pafture ; and if a great number of them were fed 
here, the grafs would gradually become better every year. 
There are only a few fheep, of a very fmall kind, that feed on, 
thefe mountains, from the time they fow their feed till the 
whole crop is got in. 

Wood and Fuel. — The greateft part of the wood of May 
lies on each fide of Loch-Knock. This wood, which conGfts 
of fmall timber of various kinds, extends above % miles along 
the fea. The whole inhabitants have liberty to cut down 
timber, and carry it away at pleafure, out of this wood. Here 
they get bark, and wood for their farming utenfils ; and fome 
of them ufe the timber for fuel, when they are fcarce of

peats, which are the principal fuel we have, and are very 
plentiful throughout all this ifland. 

Population.-^ parifh contains above 1600 fouls ; and 
the females are more numerous than the males, a great num. 
ber of young men having left the parifh, and gone to the Low 
Country for employment : Some have gone to America and 
other places ; fo that the number of inhabitants has dimuum- 
ed within thefe 40 years*. There is no regifter kept of the 
burials. The following is a lift of the baptifms and marriages,

Wages, Manner of Living, &amp;c— The wages of men fer- 
vants are 5I. Sterling, befides fome little advantages, fuch as 
ground for fowing flax-feed, or potatoes. Women fervants 
have about the half of that fum. The hire of both is 
double what it was 20 years ago ; and there is almoft an 
annual increafe in their wages. There are very few employ- 
ed by the day ; but when they are, they get 6d. a day and 
their maintainance. Tradefmen are generally paid fo much 
per piece ; but as we have no kind of manufa&amp;ure, the num- 
ber of tradefmen is very few. The poor people who have 

families,

families, fpend much of their time, in fpring, in preparing 
fome potatoe land, and in carrying manure from the fhore 
on their backs, which they fpread on fuch mofs land as they 
procure ; for the fea-ware is very abundant, and proves good 
manure for mofs ground. The fumrner, again, is employed 
in cutting their own peats, and the peats of thofe on whom 
they depend for a houfe, or a cow's grafs, or any other ad- 
vantages they enjoy ; which are all paid for in labour of this 
kind. They are alfo frequently employed, on fimilar terms, 
an harveft, as they get ground for fowing flax-feed, which 
they pay for, by affifting the farmers in cutting down their 
barley and oats ; nothing elfe being fown here excepting pota- 
toes, which is the only fupport of the poor. They alfo catch 
fome grey fifti and cod, which they dry, and keep for winter 
provifions ; and they fometimes get a few herrings in the 
winter feafon ; but the herrings are only driven here in ftormy 
weather, and feldom continue any time. 

Poor — The number of thofe who apply to the kjrk-feffion 
for charity, feldom exceeds 20, as we have no fund for their 
relief, except what is collected on Sabbath in the church, 
which is very trifling. However, the wants of the poor are 
partly fupplied by the tenants at their own houfes, where, 
they give freely what is neceflary for their maintainance and 
clothing. The natives are very hofpitable to ftrangers ; and 
are often impoled upon by vagrant beggars, who are very 
capable of working for their own fupport. Giving charity 
to fuch perfons is an encouragement to idlenefs and vice, 
which every friend to mankind ought to difcourage, and re- 
ward the oppofne virtues of induftry and fobriety. 



Church, %$c The old church walls are entire, though the 

roof was demolifhed many years ago. It is about a century 

fincc 



of Kildalton. ig$ 

fin ce public worfhi was performed in it. There is at pre- 
fent no appearance of any houfe near this church. There is,- 
however, within the church-yard, a very large crofs ; and 
there is another crofs on the outfide of the wall that inclofes 
the burying ground; and both of them have the appearance 
of having been very long in this place. This church (lands 
in the N. E. end of the parifli, and within a few miles from 
the entry to the Sound of May. There is alfo, in the other 
end of the parifli, the remains of an old church, at a place 
known by the name of Kilnaughtan. The walls of this kirk 
are very much decayed ; and in a few years both the kirk 
and the burying ground will be covered over with fand, that 
is driven from the more in great quantities. There is much 
of the burying ground already deftroyed; for there is no wall 
or fence around this burying place, and it is very difficult to 
fence it, fo as to prevent the fand from blowing over the 
whole church-yard, as it is fo near a ftormy fea. The greateft. 
part of the inhabitants are buried in this place. The nearefl 
farm to this is called Bailie Vicar, or the Vicar's Town ; and 
there is joined to this farm the clerk's patch, which is now of 
fome value. There is, at the diftance of 4 miles, a farm 
called Bailie Naughtan ; and, as that farm is the centre be- 
tween the two kirks, it was judged a proper fituation for the 
minifter's manfe. Thefe 2 farms are juftly efteemed the belt 
land in the whole parifli. The church now employed for 
public worfliip was built about 60 years ago, near this laft 
farm ; and it is ftill a good edifice; only the roof wants fome 
repairs. Public worfliip was performed here before the new 
church was built. There is a convenient manfe near this church, 
which was built a few years ago, and was lately plaittered. 
Good office houfes were alfo built within thefe 2 years. The 
glebe is large, and maintains, through the whole year, ia 
cows, and 4 horfes. It produces ia Iflay bolls of oats,

a bolls of barley, and 4 bolls of potatoes ; befides the mofs 
ground, that fome poor people have for 3 years gratis, for 
potatoe ground f. The ftipend is only 50I. Sterling, which is 
all paid by the facior of Iflay ; as the whole parilh belongs 
to Mr. Campbell of Shawfield. 

Schools. — There have been 2 fchool-houfes built here within 
thefe 3 years, and both the fchoolmallers are lodged under the 
fame roof, in a houfe joined to each of the fchool-houfes. 
The one is the parochial fchool, and the other a charity fchool. 
Befides thefe, we fometimes have other 2 fchools, at the more 
diftant corners of this large parilh ; and there is great need of 
them all the year, if it were poflible to fupport the teachers. 

Peculiar Privilege, and Confequences. — This if! and hath a 
liberty of brewing whilky, without being under the neceffity 
of paying the ufual excife duty to government. We have 
not an excife officer in the whole iiland. The quantity there- 
fore of whilky rhade here is very great ; and the evil, that 
follows drinking to excefs of this liquor, is very vifible in 
this ifland. This is one chief caufe of our poverty ; for the 
barley, that Ihould fupport the family of the poor tenant, is 
fold to a brewer for 17s. the boll ; and the fame farmer is 
often obliged to buy meal at il. 3s. Sterling, in order to keep 
his family from ftarving. When a brewer knows that a 
poor man is at a lofs for money, he advances him a trifle, on 
condition that he makes him fure of his bai ley at the above 
price ; and it is often bought by the brewers even at a lower 
rate; while thofe who are not obliged to afk money until they

UNITED PARISHES OF <name ref="NA">KILLARROW 
AND KILMENY</name>, 

IN THE ISLAND OF ISLAY. 
{County and Synod of Argyll— Prejbytery of Kintyre.') 

By the Rev. Mr. John Murdoch, Minifler.</head> 

<p>I. 

— . 

Origin of the Names. 

ISLAY is traditionally derived from IsLA, daughter of one 
of the kings of Lochlin, or Norway, who lies buried in 
a neighbouring farm. Killarrow took, its name from St. 
Marrow, whofe cell or burying place was in the parifh : And 
Kilmeny has dou'bdefs had a fimilar derivation. Killarrow 
is now frequently called Bowmore ; the old church at Killar- 
row having been thrown down, and the prefent church built 
at the village of Bowmore. 

Extent, Surface, Rivers, Fijh, &amp;c— The parifli of Bow- 
more is of great extent, being 17 or 18 computed miles long, 
and 8 broad. The lands are generally low ; the hills are not 
very high, nor rocky, but coverW with heath and fern. The 

river 



of Killarrow and Kilmeny. 29$ 

river Luggan, where there is a falmc-n fifhing, is one of the 
iargeft in the diftrift, emptying itfelf into a bay of the fame 
name , in the S. corner of the parifl, The river of Marrow 
runs a great way in the country, and empties itfelf into the 
bay or harbour of Lochendaal, which harbour runs from the 
Mull of May and the Hunn's Point, about 12 miles, to Shaw- 
field's pleafuregrounds. It is an excellent harbour for flapping, 
is very much reforted to, and of late more than ever ; as the 
proprietor has lately built a fine quay at the village of Bow, 
Lre, which will contain many veffels from 8 to 10 feet wa- 
ter. The harbour abounds with all forts of fib; and, m good 
weather, the inhabitants, with fmall boats, fupply themfelves 
abundantly. Salmon fells at i^d. per pound; when deareft, 
at 2d. per pound. As every farm round Lochendaal has a 
boat of its own, fifh are in no great demand, nor is there a 
market convenient*. 

Soil, Produce and Cultivation, &amp;c— -The foil varies in mod 
of the farms. The farmers plow too much ground. The 
average produce of oats is, from 3 to 4 returns, of barley from 
4 to 5 ; but where marl and lime, or fliell fand, are eafily 
obtained, and the lands are drained, the increafe is much 
greater. Mr. Campbell has improved large tra&amp;s of moor 
gTound, within view of his own houfe, which lies about 3 
Englifli miles from the village ; and, from his method of cul- 
tivation, they have produced large crops. He fpares neither 
pains nor expencej and in this refpea feveral of his te- 
nants attempt to imitate him. It is computed that he lays

feed, of which the people of this ifland few 120 hogfheads 
(new feed) annually ; befldes what is reared in the country, 
the value of which, in the year, may amount to 2000L 
There is a great deal of linen cloth manufactured for home 
confutation, and fome for fale. The harvefl is as early in 
Iflay, as in the neighbourhood of Glalgow 

Climate, &amp;c— The air is generally moift, from its local fix- 
ation, being funounded by the fea, and having no flielter from 
the ftorms of the Atlantic Ocean, nearer than North America, 
Iflay is the moft weftern part of Scotland. The prevailing 
xvinds are the W. and % W. The feafons of late have changed 
to the difadvantage. The 2 laft years we had little or no 
froft or fpring; fometimes the tops of the trees were covered. 
The rains and high winds in the fucceeding fummers, hurt 
the crops, which obliged the inhabitants to import meal ; 
whereas, in former years, they ufed to export large quantities 
to other markets.. 

Cattle — There is, twice a year, a market for black cattle ; 
to which drovers from the main land always refort, and buy 
up great numbers. The cattle are of an excellent quality, 
and draw high prices. 



Population* — From a late furvey, the number of fouls in

Indeed the whole population of May has increafed greatly 
within thefe 40 years f, owing principally to the tenants, who 
are in poffeffion of large farms, dividing their poffeffions 
among their children, which encourages marriage. Some, 
however, who are reduced in their circumftances, are obliged 
fo emigrate. 

Village. The village of Bowmore was begun in the year 

1768, and laid out on a regular plan. By order of the pro- 
prietor, the new church was built at the end of one of the 
principal ftreets, in a very elegant manner, and upon a new 
plan. It is ornamented with a fteeple, fronting the quay, built 
from the foundation with freeftone. It coft about 1000J.. 
There are already 110 houfes built in the village, 50 of which 
are covered with blue flates, 20 with tiles, and the reft are 
thatched. The inhabitants are increafing. The number at 
prefent (1793), of old and young, is about 500. 

Church, School, and Poor — Befides the new church in Bow- 
more above mentioned, there is another in the parifh of Kil- 
meny, 7 miles diflant. The value of the livings is but fmall, 
and, including the glebe and manfe, not worth above 60I. 
a year. The King is patron. — There is only one charity 
fchool in both the pariflhes, though the people are fond of be- 
ing instructed. — The poor of both parilhes are not very nu- 
merous.

well fupplied ; fuch as are confined are aflifted from the col- 
leftions on Sundays, and fome little funds in the poor's box. 

Roads and Bridges. -^The roads in Iflay are carried on to 
great perfeftion. Thofe already finiflied are excellent, parti- 
cularly from the Sound of Iflay to Bowmore, a diftance of 
about 1 1 miles, wherein there are 7 bridges, built with Hone 
and lime* The reft of the roads go on in courfe ; and, in lefs 
than 20 years, they may be all travelled with carriages. 

Miturals.—Thtxt is plenty of lime-ftone and marl, which, 
when the roads now making by the proprietor are finiflied, 
will be the means of improving large tracts of land, ftill in 
a ftate of nature, but very capable of improvement. 

Chara&amp;er of the People — The inhabitants are moftly na- 
tives of the ifland, and all belong to the Eftabliflied Church. 
They are hofpitable, generous, and humane j and, like all 
iflanders, attached to their country.

$Jame y Situation, and Rivers, 

THIS parifh derives its name from a compound of Eden 
and Ham; being fituated on the banks of the river Eden, 
and Ham fignifying a village. The village, where the church 
Hands, is built on the N. bank of the river Eden, which 
runs for more than 3 miles through this diftrict, and joins* 
the Tweed at Edenmouth. The parifh is placed in one of the 
moll delightful fituations in Scotland, on the banks of the 
river Tweed. This beautiful river, after being joined by the 
Tiviot at Kelfo, bounds the parifh of Edenham, about a mile 
below it, oa the S. and S. E. The parilh is not quite a mile 
and a half diftant from the Englilh border, at the burn of 
Carham, on the oppofite fide of the Tweed, formerly well 
known by the name of the March Burn,

Extent and Climate.— -In extent, it is about 3 miles broad"; 
and rather fomewhatmore in length. The climate of Edenharn, 
from its fituation on the two rivers, is undoubtedly falubri- 
ous ; yet, fince the prefent incumbent was fettled, it has been 
vifited by different epidemical fevers, that fometimes proved 
mortal. 

Cultivation, Surface, Hills, Soil, i£c Agriculture is carried 

on to a great extent in this parifh. The induftry and activity 
of the farmers cannot be exceeded, and they are all opulent and 
profperous. The furface of the grounds confifts of fome beauti- 
ful flats in many places, efpecially on the fides of the rivers Tweed 
and Eden. The parifli contains alfo feveral fields, lying on in- 
clined plains. There are tworifing grounds, one on theN. fide 
of the Eden, near the village, called Edenham Hill, and another 
between the Tweed and the Eden, called Henderjide Hill. 
The height of neither is great, though not afcertaincd ; but 
they are both highly cultivated. The foil is of various kinds : 
Some part of it ftrong clay, fome of it light fand and channel, 
and fome of it a mixture of both. In a few places there is a 
thin bed of mofs, covering rich ftores of marl. The marl has 
been dug for manure, at confiderable expence, and it has been 
attended with great fuccefs. Burned lime-flone is brought 
in great quantities from Northumberland, at the diftance of 
17 or 18 miles. 

Produce and Farm Rents .—The ground produces wheat, 
barley, peafe and beans, and oats, all of the befl quality, 
v/hich can fcarcely be exceeded in any part of Scotland. It 
produces alfo turnips, and broad clover, in abundance; and the 
pafiure land is of the richeft kind. Land rent is confequent- 
ly high in price: 3I. an acre has been given here both for 

arable 



of Eden bam, 305 

arable and pafture land, and inferior prices according to 
the quality. 

Cattle and Fuel. — The farmers confider the land as too good 
for breeding cattle or ftieep, and therefore few are reared in 
the parifti : The (heep and cattle are moflly all bought in, and 
fed for the butcher to great value. Fuel is very expenfive, as 
there are no coals, but what are brought from Northumber- 
land, at the diflance of 16 or 18 miles,. 

Population. — The number of inhabitants has increafed con- 
fiderably within thefe 40 years. 

The prefent number of fouls is about - 600 

The return tp Dr. Webfter, in 1755, was only - * 387 

Increafe,, * - 213 

The number of births, burials, and marriages is not eafily 
afcertained. Seceders, though obliged by law to regifter the 
births of their children in the parifti regifter, confider the tax 
on baptifms as a profanation, and often neglect it on that ac- 
count j though afterwards it may be prejudicial to their 
children. And marriages are often made fo irregularly, by 
pevfons not legally qualified, that thofe, who belong to the 
Seceffion, do not willingly fubmit to the difcipline of the 
Church. 

Improvements and Manufaflures, &amp;.c. — 'The population of 
this parifli has not, however, increafed in proportion to what 
it once promifed. When the late James Dickson, Efq. M.P. 
became proprietor of Edenham, being a perfon of public 
fpirit, he inclofed all his lands, planned and built a neat vil- 
lage, the houfes being all of brick, covered with pantile, or 
flates j— r— brought manufacturers from England, and efta- 

Vol. XI. Q^q bliflied

blilhed woollen manufactures for cloth, particularly for Eng.- 
Wh blankets. He alfo erected a waulk mill, to promote 
this ufeful undertaking ; but his death marred the progrefs of 
thofe public fpirited fchemes. He built alfo an extenfive 
brewery, which is ftill carried on with great fuccefs ; and 
great quantities of the ale and porter, brewed in it, are export- 
ed to England. We have likewife a corn mill and a good, 
bleachfield in the parilh. 

i 

Roads. — The roads are very bad. They are repaired by a con- 
vernon of the ftatute labour. Laft winter, however, (1792-3), 
an a£t of parliament was obtained for making feveral roads 
near Kelfo, and eftablifhing toll-bars. By this aft, three new 
roads will be made through this parifli, which will be of great 
fervice in this part of the country, where they have been much 
wanted for thefe many years paft. 

Church. — The church is very fmall, was built about 34 
years, ago, and is very inefficient. There are fome Quakers 
and Epifcopals, but no Roman Catholics. The number of 
Seceders is not eafily afcertained, as all the denominations of 
them have houfes of worlhip in Kelfo, and Edenham lies fo 
near it, that many of the inhabitants attend thefe meetings ; but 
all the principal farmers attend the Eftabliftied Church. The 
King is undoubted patron. 

Heritors and Poor. — The number of heritors are four. As 
none of them refide in theparifh, the collections at the church 
doors are but trifling ; in confequence of which the poor are 
obliged to be maintained by affeffments, regularly laid on for 
their fupport. 

Eminent, 



of Edenham. 307 

Eminent Men.— Mr. James Thomson, the celebrated author 
of the Seafons, &amp;c. was the fon of the reverend Mr. Thomas 
Thomfon, the fecond mlnifter of this parifh after the Revolu- 
tion, and was born .at Edenham in the year 1706. It is un- 
neceffary here to enlarge upon the merits of an author fo well 
known, and whofe genius and abilities do fo much honour to 
his native country. A propofal was made, fome years ago, 
to ere&amp; a monument to his memory, on Edenham Hill, with- 
in view of the manfe ; but the plan has not yet been accom- 
plifhed. Several noblemen and gentlemen, however, with a 
laudable zeal fo* the literary fame of their country, have met 
annually at Edenham, for fome years paft, to celebrate Thom- 
fon's birth day, as well as with a view to forward the execu- 
tion of that defign. 

Antiquities. — There is a finall fifing ground, W. from the 
village, called the PiBs Know j out of which, fome years ago, 
were dug three ftohe coffins, with an urn in one of them. The 
Know is fince inclofed, and planted with trees*. 

Qjji NUM. 

* A farm in this parifh is named Comb-fdt, which feems to he fo called from its 
containing extenfive earthen mounds, called C*mh-knoivs. As, before the union o f 
the kingdoms, this was the warlike part of the country, thefe tvimuli feem to 
hrte b«n raifed by art, as rneans of defence.

NUMBER XXIV. 
PARISH OF <name ref="NA">GIRTHON</name>. 

{County and- Pre/by tery of Kirkcudbright—Synod of Galloway.-) 
By the Rev. Mr. William Thorburkt.</head> 

<p>Situation and Extent. 

GIRTHON lies about 6 miles N. W. of the burgh of 
Kirkcudbright. It no where aflumes a regular figure. 
The extent from N. to S. is about 20 miles ; and the breadth, 
from E. to W., from 3 to 5. 

Soil and Surface. — Thefe are extremely varied. For 
about 10 miles from its northern, and all along its eaftern 
boundary, it is bleak, unequal, hilly, and covered with heath. 
For 10 miles to the S., within a mile of the Fleets it prefents 
a beautiful level furface, which yields grain and grafs of an 
excellent quality. Except the extenfive wood of Cajlramont, 
there is little natural wood j though the foil feems highly 
favourable for rearing trees of every fpecies. 



Climate, 



of Girthon. 30 j 

Climate. -The air and climate vary with the foil and fur* 
face. In the high lands, and to the E. and N„ they are cold 
andunpleafant: In the low lands, and towards the S., they 
are mild and agreeable. Though the frequent rains render 
the foil there rather moift ; yet, from its being defended with 
the hills and high lands, expofed to the fun, and open to the 
fea breezes, the atmofphere which covers it, is, in general, pure 
and healthy. The difeafes, which appear here, are in no re- 
fpeft peculiar. They are fuch as amid the inhabitants of alt 
the fouthern diftricls of Scotland. 

Cultivation, Animals, Fuel, tft.— The fyftem of agriculture 
is the fame here, that is generally adopted by all who cultivate 
land near the fea coaft*. The horfes are moftly bred by the 
farmers. The cows are of the well known Galloway breed. 
The ftieep are of the fmall moor kind — various forts of game 
and wild animals are found here : Groufe, black-cocks, par- 
tridges, hares, rabbits, woodcocks, badgers, foxes and pole- 
eats PeatSj the fuel ufed by the farmers and cottars, are 

dear, owing to the diftance of the mofles, and the bad roads 
which lead to them. 

Rivers, FiJJj, and Lakes. — The Fleet, which bounds this pa- 
rifh to the W. is a beautiful winding river, and difembogues 
jtfelf into Wigton Bay. There is a falmon fifliing belonging 
to it, now of little value ; owing probably to the lime import- 
ed, and to a foap houfe lately erected on its banks. The 
lakes are, Loch-Fleet, the fource of the river, abounding 
with trouts : Loch-Scero, abounding with pike : Loch-Grun- 
nock, about 3 miles long, and, in fome places, 1 mile broad,

remarkable for its vaft numbers of charr, a fpecies of fifh rare* 
^ Scotland : and Loch-Whinnyan, abounding with trout* 
Ihis lake, it deferves notice, furnimes the cotton mills at 
Gatehoufe with a copious ftream of water ; the courfe for 
conveying which from the lake, was cut a long way through 
a hill, at the expence of above liool. 

Proprietor, Manfwh-Houfe, &amp;c— The whole parilh is the 
property of James Murray, Efq. of Broughton, whofe man- 
fion-houfe, Cally, ftands about an Englifh mile below Gate. 
Jioufe, at a fmall diltance from the borders of the Fleet. The 
fituation is extremely pleafant. The houfe is modern, and 
amongft the largeft, and moft princely, in the fouth of Scot- 
land. The place is laid out on an extenfive fcale. About 
1000 acres are in planting, gardens, orchards, and pleafure- 
grounds. The gardens were made at a great expence, and 
have equalled the proprietor's expectations. Befides the com- 
mon fruits, they yield apricots, figs, grapes, and neftarines,' 
equal to any in the hot-houfes of this country. There is alfo' 
a deer park, well flocked ; the venifon of which is reckoned 
equal, if not fuperior to any in Britain. 

Rent, Leafes, Servitudes, %£c— The total valuation of the 
parilh, in the cefs-book, is 3281I. 3s. 6"d. Scotch, or 273I. 8s; 
7ld. Sterling. The prefent rent is about 3500I., including a 
moderate average rent for the lands not in leafe. The leafes 
are generally given for 19 years. The greater part of the 
moor lands are let by the lump : The low lands bring about 
10s. per acre: The fields, near Gatehoufe, from il. to i\. 
The oppreflive practice of thirlage prevails, and hurts their 
lands. The barony of Caftramont is thirled to the mill of 
Kelleren, in the parilh of Anwoth ; and the barony of Cally 
to the mill of Burby, in this parilh. The proprietor has con- 

fiderably 



of Girthon, 3 1 % 

iiderably leffened the multures of the mill on his own eftate, 
to the no fmall encouragement of its agriculture. The cotton, 
works eftabliOied at Gatehoufe, have much advanced the 
wages of farm fervants. 

Population.— As no regular regifter has been kept, the an- 
cient ftate of the population cannot be afcertained precifely. 
From Dr. Webfter^s report, however, we are certain, that it 
has increafed greatly within thefe 40 years, even excluding 
the vaft addition made to it, by the new village of Gatehoufe. 
The reft of the parifli at prefent (1792), contains,

Church and Poor.— The living, every thing included, is, 
about 120I. yearly. The manfe was built a confiderable time 
ago, and is in a very uncomfortable ftate. The church is 
fmall, and, from its fituation, extremely inconvenient for the 
bulk of the inhabitants. The weekly collections, fines for 
irregularities, &amp;c amount to about 25I. a year. Paupers, to 
the number of 10, are affifted therewith. 

General Chara&amp;er.—Six M'Millanites excepted, the tenants 
and cottagers are all Prefbyterians. Much praife is due to 
their religious and moral conduct. A circulation of good

indubious : They affed no parade of fanclity : They have 
nothing of an indifcreet, or intolerant zeal : Firm to the re- 
ligion of their country, " they meddle not with thofe that are 
" given to change." 

GATEHOUSE OF FLEET. 

Situation and Origin — This neat and beautifully fituated 
village ftands to the S. W. |of the parifh, on the banks of the 
Fleet. Its increafe has been rapid. Though the firft houfe 
in it was built as an inn, not above 30 years ago, it now con, 
tains upwards of 160 houfes, and 11 50 inhabitants. The cot, 
ion works, which have fwelled it to its prefent fize and popu- 
lation, promife foon to give it a rank among the towns dif- 
tinguilhed for induftry an4 cpmmerce. 

Houfes, Rents, The village is held in feu from Mr-. 

Murray. The ground Heads, of 30 feet in front, 150 back, 
for a kitchen garden, paid, till within thefe few years, only 
is. annual feu-duty each. Since that period, they pay at the 
rate of 3d. per foot in front, with 150 back. The houfes are 
built of brick, or of whin-itone, and are moftly % ftories high. 
Owing to the vaft influx of inhabitants, they bring a great 
rent. A houfe of 3 ftories, with but indifferent convenience 
and accommodation, will let fo high as 30I. yearly. The 
village is divided into 3 ftreets, which rife parallel from the 
river. It is well watered, and allowed to be by far the plea- 
fanteft in Galloway. Though its induftry has kept it as yet 
qu^ier, a burgh police is certainly neceffary for the eftablilhing 
and perpetuating good order. It is matter of pleafure to the 
inhabitants, that the fuperior has fignified, that his attention 
{hall foon be turned to this important objeft. It deferves re- 
mark.

-ivu-k, that there is not a lamp-pcft in any of its ftreets. This, 
■with many other, disadvantages, would be attended te, and 
remedied, by feveral refpeftable inhabitants, if they were in- 
vented with any external authority. 

Inn, Road, \£c.— Befides a good inn, there are about 1 5 
houfes in which fpiritous liquors are fold. The road, betwixt 
Dumfries and Portpatrick, runs throngh this village, andmakes 
its principal inn well frequented. Two mail coaches arrive 
here, at 7 o'clock, every morning, one from Carlifle, the other 
from Portpatrick. 

Bank, Commerce, Shipping, 13c. — A. branch of the Paifley 
tJnion Bank was lately eftablifhed here, and tranfa&amp;s bufinefs 

to a confiderable amount The right of a weekly market, 

which the village charter gives, has not yet been ufed. The 
beft frequented markets are, for eight fuccefilve Fridays, after 
the firft Friday of winter ; and at fome of thefe there is a con- 
fiderable fhow of black cattle*. Several veffels, of 80 tons and 
under, belong to this port. They trade chiefly to the weft of 
Scotland, and to the north of England. One of them trades 
conftantly to London. The commodities imported are, ale, 
porter, wine, grocery goods, raw hides, tallow, timber, lime, 
cotton wool, coals, &amp;c. Cotton manufactures, tanned leather, 
foap, grain, potatoes, &amp;cc. are exported. 

Manufa-Elwes. — Many branches of commerce thrive in 
Gatehoufe. It has a tannery and foapery, both carried on to 
Vol. XI. R r a 

* Butcher meat is in general to be got here. Beef, mutton, veal, and pork, fell 
from 3{d. to 4$d. the pound; butter, at 6d. the pound; Scotch cheefe, at 3d,

a good extent. But its induftry is principally direftcd to tb« 
manufacturing of cotton wool. Befides about 50 mules and 
jennies, managed by private hands, it has 4 mills in conftant 
employment ; and will probably have 2 more in a fliort time* 
Of thofe built, the 2 largeft are twift mills ; the 2 others are 
mule mills. The mule mills are 3. ftories high, 70 feet by 20 ; 
have about 130 mules each, which give employment to up- 
wards of 100 labourers. The largeft of the twill mills is 4 
ftories high, 120 feet by 30; and employs about 300 labour- 
ers. The other twift mill is 3 ftories high, 84 feet by 32 ; 
and is not yet completely fet agoing. There is alfo a cotton 
factory, in which are wove muflins, and other cottons, of neat 
patterns and good fabric *. 

Fuel. — Coals are the general fuel here. They are imported 
from Whitehaven, Newcaftle, See. and run from 30s. to 40s; 
the ton. Notwithftanding the extravagant price of this necef- 
fary article, the inhabitants are often in abfolute want. This 
tends to hurt the manufactures, as it caufes many of the la- 
bourers to remove ; and will, when known, prevent ftrangers 
from fettling. Employers would therefore confult their own 
intereft, would they adopt fome method of fupplying their 
workmen conftantly, and upon as moderate terms as poffible. 
The duty upon coals was a frequent, and juft caufe of com- 
plaint, which, fince the commencement of this account, has 
been happily removed. 

School. 

* The cotton workers are paid, fome by the day, others by the pound, others 
by the piece. A picker will earn is. per day; a carder is. 2d.; a fpinner 
5s. 6d. One male, houfe, or farm fervant, has from 7I. to 9I. a year; a female 
ditto from 3I. to 4I. Mafons and carpenters have from is. 6d. to as. per day, 
without meat ; tailors 8d. per day, with meat. Shoemakers, weavers, &amp;c. are 
paid according to the quantity and quality of their work,

School— There is one fchool here, very well endowed. It 
Ss fubjeft of regret, however, that fo large a parifh has only 
one This is a great difadvantage to the farmers and cottagers 
children, who cannot travel as far as Gatehoufe. What de- 
ferves commendation is, that the fchoolmafter has, though 
with little encouragement, opened a Sunday fchool, for the In- 
fineon of fuch children as are obliged, from the ftraitened 
circumftances of their parents, to attend the cotton mills dur- 
ing the reft of the week.

<p>Origin of the Name, Ifc. 

|N all ancient writings, the name of this partfli is fpelled 
A Oxenham, whereof the prefent mode of fpelling it is 
an abbreviation. Several names in the parifh are evidently 
taken from animals, and mod probably from thofe, for which 
the various places have been moft eminent : As Bindhope, 
from hind, where there had been a foreft 5 Swinfide, from 
fwine, one of thefe having been kept in many places by every 
cottager ; Stotfeld, from flot, a young bullock ; Oxenham, 
from oxen and ham, which, in the Saxon language, fignifies a 
hamlet or village. The names of many other places defcribe 
and exprefs their local filiations, and other concomitant cir- 
cumftances. Thus, Millheugh, the heugh by the mill ; Mofs* 
burnford, through which the burn from Scraclbureh Mofs

perhaps there had been an orchard ; &amp;c. Pienderleith R ic 
calton, and Bolphijlon, are moll probably the names of their 
onginal proprietors, 

Form, Extent, and General Appearance — The figure of the 
panfh bears a ftrikiug refemblance to that of Scotland. The 
greateft length, from the head of Coquet water on the Eng- 
lilh border, in a line by Swinfide, to Capehope, a farm (lead 
on the N. point of the parifh, in a direction N. W. f N., is 
9f Englifh miles ; the greateft breadth, in a perpendicular 
xeftion, from Ka.imburnfoot, on the W., in a line by Swinfide, 
to Conzierton march on the E„ is 4 | Englifla mil es . 0 n the 
N. it runs nearly to a point ; and about ii miles from the S. 
end, it is only 2 miles broad. The general complexion is 
rather bleak, interfperfed with beautiful green hills, fertile 
fields, and dark heath ; and almoft uninclofed. But though, 
it is hilly, yet there are no hills of very considerable magnitude. 

Climate, Soil, and Bifeafes — The country is damp, and 
the air often moift, by rains from all directions, and in parti- 
cular from the E. The rains arifing out of Solway Frith, on 
the S., are conduced, as it were, along the vale of Liddif- 
dale, and frequently fall in great' quantities on the adjoining 
fells, whilft they fcarcely touch this parifh. The foil is vari- 
ous, admitting both the amufements of paflurage, and the la- 
bours of agriculture. At the fame time, the agreeable inter- 
change of hill, dale, and ftreams of water, gives a vibration to 
the air which renders it healthy, and free from agues. Certain 
it is, however, that rheumatifms, confuroptions, and nervous 
itvers are pretty frequent, 

Rivers. 



of Oxnam, 319 

Rivers and Fijh.— The river Jed runs along the W. bound- 
ary % miles. Oxnam water has its fource about 2 miles 
from the S. end of the parifh, runs N. by Oxnam, and, after 
a courfe of ill miles, wherein there are many beautiful Ter- 
pentine windings, falls into Tiviot below Crailing. Both the 
Coquet and the Kail, arife in that lofty ridge of mountains, 
lying in a direction betwixt N. and E., which feparates Scot- 
land and England from each other. The Coquet bounds the 
parifli for a mile on the S., the only point in which it touches 
Scotland; and, after receiving a vaft number of fmaller ftreamSi 
precipitating themfelves from the mountains, quickly fwella 
into a confiderable river, which takes an eafterly direction 
through Northumberland, and difcharges itfelf into the Britifh 
Ocean, betwixt Alnwick and Coquet Ifle. The Kail, after 
running the breadth of the parifh in a N. E. direction, takes 
its courfe, of i6i miles, by Hownam, Morebattle, and Marie- 
field, and joins the Tiviot a little below Eckford kirk. Thefe 
all abound in trout of an excellent quality, though, in point 
of quantity, the Coquet is the moft diftinguifhed. Befides, it 
affords a falmon fifhery, many of which fpawn about 4 or 5 
miles from its head. 



Minerals and Mineral Springs, — Attempts have been made 
to find coal in this parifh, as well as in the neighbourhood, 
but without fuccefs. Limeflone was found on the W. fide of 
the parifh, by Jed ; but, being under a deep cover, and at. a 
great diftance from coal, the advantage of burning it is very 
doubtful. There is a chalybeate fpri.ng near Fairloans, on the 
S. end of the parifh, to which qualities limilar to GiMand 
water are afcribed ; but little of it has ever been ufed. 

Perennial and Migratory Birds. — Game abounds here 5 
amongft which may be reckoned the beautiful black-cock and 

groufe,

groufe. The woodcock, and fieldfare appear in the beginning 
of Oaober, and remain during winter. The curlew, the green 
and the grey plover, come in March, breed in the moors, and 
go in the latter end of harveft. The cuckoo, fwallow, dottrel, 
and land and water rail, appear in May, hatch their young, 
and then difappear.

Villages.— Oxnam was once large and populous ; but, at 
prefent, there are hardly cottagers in it fufficient for the pro- 
per culture of the land, and only 4 tradefmen. Newhigging 
has been poiTeiTed by pqrtioners, who hold of the Marquis 
of Lothian,, iince 161 1. The fole property of it, how- 
ever, falls to his Lordfhip at Martinmas 1815, according to 
the decifion of Lord Juftice Clerk, to whom it was referred 
by both parties. Swin/ide Dolphijlon, and Mofsburnford, 
are inconfiderable villages.

confiderable alterations, and is in pretty good repair §. The

70 years ago,, there were zz tenants, who kept about 16 ploughs, drawn by 7, 
oxen and a horfes, driven by a boy ; whereas now, 3 perfons occupy the whole, 
and have only 7 ploughs, drawn by z horfes. 

*Thcparifh regifter was accurately kept, from 1700 to 1710, during 
which, the births amounted to 398, annual average 40 nearly. Since that pe- 
riod, the regifter has. not be$n fo accurate ; occafioned, chiefly,, by the neglect 
of parents to fave a very trifling expence. Within the laft 10 years', the annual 
average of births has been about Ij, of which only 10 are regiftered. 

f There is ap inftance.of ene marriage producing %% births, and of a mar- 
riages out of thefe, producing each 15. 

% During the above period, the. morrcloth has been ufed 107 times, 90 0 f 
which were for interments in this church-yard. There is a ftone in the church- 
yard, bearing the ages of a father and mother, z fons, a daughter-in-law, and 
3 grandchildren, amounting to 6l8, average 77 years; the oldeft of whom wat

in all probability, there has been areliding vicar. The mini- 
iler has alfo the privilege of turf, alternately, from 3 flock 
farms belonging to the Marquis of Lothian. A confiderable 
proportion of the inhabitants of this parifh are connected 
with the diffenting meetings in Jedburgh.

has 4I. 3s. 4'd. r intereft of money mortified by Lady Yefter,

Poor,— In confeqtjence of a legal intimation of 10 free 
days, the heritors, tenants, and kirk-feffion hold meetings 
about the terms of Candlemas, Whitfunday, Lammas and 
Martinmas. Upon the day of meeting they choofe a prefes ; 
after which their clerk reads the minutes of laft federunt, 
when they proceed to the roll of the poor, confider their cir- 
cumftances individually, and appoint them correfponding ali- 
ments. The inrolled poor amount to '24 ; and the quarterly af- 
fefl'mentfor their relief is, at prefent, about 19I., being of late 
greatly increafed, by the high prices of provifions, as well as 
by the advanced age, and growing infirmities of moil of them. 
The higheft yearly allowance for a fingle perfon is 4 guineas, 
and for a frail old couple 61. 9s. But when any perfon is fo 
circumltanced as to require a nurfe, the heritors provide one. 
In order to their enrolment they muft give inventories of their. 
e#e&amp;s, which become the legal property of the heritors, and 
are expofed to fale at their death. The heritors, fteadily and 
uniformly, infill upon having thefe inventories, both for en- 
livening their own induftry, and for ftimulating their children 
and near relations to give them aid. It is much to be regrets 
ed, that a taile for finery, inconfiftent with their ftation, pre- 
vents many from relieving their aged and indigent parents, 
and other near relations, and expofes them to want, upon the 
approach of ficknefs or old age ; while, at the fame time, it 
deprives them of a luxury, far fuperior to that of fuperfluous 
ornament, the godlike pleasure of difpelling grief, and 
communicating happiness. The affeffment is divided a- 
mongft the heritors, according to their valued rents ; and the 
proportion which falls to each is paid, one half by the pro-

their real rents*. I 

Heritors and Rents.— There are 7 heritors ; but only 2 re- 
ticle. The valued rent of the pariiL is 14,101!; 10s. 8d. Scotch, 
and the real rent about 3,670}. Sterling. The yearly rent of 
the arable land is from 10s. to upwards of 20s. per acre, and 
of Hock land froni 3s. to 3s. 6d. per acre. Farms are rented 
from 40I. to about 600I. per annum. Two confiderable flock

3 2(5 Statical Account 

Cultivation.^ upper part of the ^ 
EnghiL Border, is found healthy ftock land, but very ftormy , 
the hills being high, and the valleys deep and narrow. The 
hills are moftly green and fertile, with an intermixture of 
heath, mofs, bent, ling, fprat, &amp;c. ; partly dry, andjmtly wet 
and marfhy. The arable land, in this part of the parifli, is 
almoft wholly laid into grafs. Towards the middle of the 
parifli they raife rather more corn ; but their principal de- 
pendence is upon ftock. The land is inferior in quality, but 
not fo ftormy, as the Border hills. On the lower end of the 
parifli, they depend more upon their crops than upon their 
flocks. Three fmall farms in this part of the parifli keep nq 
fheep at prefent. 

Improvements.— The ftock land has been mueh improved^ 
pf late, by draining the wet and marfhy grounds ; by plant- 
ing clumps of firs, for Jells to fhelter the flocks in ftorms , 
and by inclofing fome part of the lands contiguous to the farm 
houfes, for hay to the fheep in fevere winters and fprings, 
for a number pf years, excellent crops of turnips have been 
raifed on the lower end of the parifli, to which the foil, which 
is dry and gravelly, is well adapted. The lime ufed for thefe, 
and for wheat, is brought, both from Tillfide on the E., and 
from Red water on the S, A cart load, of 5 bolls, cofts 12s.; 
and 5 loads are commonly fpread upon an Englifh acre. The 
general practice is to allow the fheep to eat them upon the 
field. Throughout the whole parifli, potatoes are raifed in fuch 
quantities, as to become the principal food of the lower ranks 
of life for 8 months in the year. They are alfo ufed in feeding 
fwine, horfes, poultry, &amp;c. and fome are fold to the people on 
the fells. 



Sheepy

Sheep &amp;c. On the upper end of this, and of the neighbour- 
ing parifhes bordering on Northumberland, the fheep have been, 
greatly improved of late, in fhape, in weight, and in quality of 
wool. This has been effected, partly, by purchafing tups 
from Northumberland, and other counties in England, or by 
purchafing from, and exchanging them with each other ; and 
partly, by adopting a different mode of breeding their tups. 
The farmers of the laft generation took their tups out of the 
whole flock, when they cut their lambs ; whereas now, they 
felect a few of their beft ewes, and fuch as have the fined fleece, 
which they keep apart from the reft of the flock, during the 
tupping feafon, with a good fine woolled tup, procured as above; 
and out of the lambs bred from thefe, they choofe their tup 
lambs. — There is a good breed of horfes in the parifti, and 
many prefer them, with a little blood, for long carriages. 

Commerce. — The produce of the lands far exceeds the cbn- 
fumption of the inhabitants. Part of the redundancy is fold 
at Jedburgh, and part is manufactured at the mills of Swin- 
fide and Oxnam, and carried over the fells to the ftockfmen. 
and their herds. A great quantity of cheefe, of butter, and 
of veal is fold at Jedburgh ; the eggs are carried weekly to 
Berwick, and the poultry, both there and to Edinburgh, by 
perfons who return loaded with fait, groceries, and other com- 
modities, for fupplying the inhabitants, and merchants in Jed- 
burgh. 

Seed-Time and Harvejl. — Wheat is fown from the middle 
to the clofe of October ; oats, peafe, and flax, from the 10th 
of March to the middle of April ; barley, rye-grafs and clover, 
from the' middle of April to that of May ; potatoes are put in- 
to the ground during the fame period ; and turnips are drilled 
during the courfe of June and to the middle of July. The 

harveft 



3 2 § Biatijlical Account 

harveft begins, for the xnoft part, with September; the corn 
is all cut in 20 or 2i working days; and, in 5 or 6 after, it 
is generally fecured in the barns, and barn-yards, except when 
the feafons prove cold and wet. 



Implements of Hujbandry.— There are '42 ploughs and 52 
carts in the parifh. The old Scotch plough is entirely laid 
afide, and the new conftrudion, with metal mould boards, uni- 
verfally adopted. Two flout horfes, driven by the plough- 
man, are quite fufficient, except in a few inftances, where 3 
horfes are ufed, and a driver. Carts, of a light make, on 
wheels 4 feet 8 inches high, commonly flayed with iron at 
each corner, are ufed for coal and lime ; and the long cart 
with rung and fheth, for corn, peat and turf *.

board ; for which they poffefs a hoUfe and yard, have one 
or two dargs of turf of peat, which their matters bring 
home, and give them as much ground as the afhes will 
cover for fowing barley. They have likewife two lippies 
of lint-feed fown, and half a firlot of potatoes planted. 
Their crop, when it is good, conftitutes a great part of 
their living throughout the year ; and, in that cafe, theif 
houfes coft them little. Hinds receive 8 bolls of oats, 2 bolls 
of barley, 1 boll of peafe, a cow's grafs, and il. 5s. for Iheep, 
as the wages of their own labour ; and are bouud to the fame 
fervitude with a cottager for their houfes, lint, potatoes, &amp;c. 
The wages of herds are considerably higher than thofe of hinds, 
and differ according to the extent of their charge. They are 
paid with fheep, and cows,, which require a flock at beginning, 
and fubjeft them to frequent loffes. 

Antiquities. — The only remains of antiquity are, a chapel 
at Plenderleith, 3 old forts, and a Roman caufeway. The 
chief fortification is a tower at Dolphiflon, faid to have been 
built by one Dolphus, from whom it took its name. Tha 
walls are from 8 to 10 feet thick, built of hewn ftone, and fo 
clofely cemented with lime, that it is found more difficult to 
obtain ftones for building from it, than from a quarry. Ic 
has been extenfive, and divided into fmall apartments by ftone 
partitions. Several vaulted apertures are in the middle of 
the walls, large enough for a fmall bed, and fome of them fo 
long, as to be ufed by the tenants for holding their ladders. 
On a rifing ground, a little to the S. there is an atea of a 
chain fquare, which is faid to have been a watch tower or 
light houfe, and fhows that Dolphiflon Tower had been ufed 
as a fort, or place of refuge. The tower on Mofsburnford 
ground, N. from Dolphiflon, which is nearly entire, is built and

divided in the lame manner, but far inferior in ftrength*. The 
Roman road, or caufeway, is the eartern boundary of the parilh, 
and runs the whole length of itf. This ftreet has been traced 

to 

*"The Crag Tower was built on a rock of fome eminence, on the E. fij e 
of Oxn^.n water, about 500 yards W. of the church. Within thefe ao years, 
it was a place of the fame conftru&amp;ion with thofe already mentioned, but much 
ftronger from its natural fituation, being furrounded with water on three fides. 
In the memory of many, now living, there was a pit in the middle of it, which 
is faid to have keen a road cut through the rock to the water, by which it was 
Applied when befieged. It is alfo faid to have been furrounded on the acceffible 
fide, with a flrong wall, within which the inhabitants of the neighbourhood 
ufed to fhut up their cattle, to prevent the plunderers from carrying them offin 
the night. Anciently, the oppofite bank of Oxnam water, on the W,, was co- 
vered with wood n denominated heniveod, and is laid to have been the rendezvous 
of the inhabitants, to oppofe the Engiifh freebooters, when the watch word was, 
a henivoody. A quarter of a mile to the W., on Millheugh-farm, there is a hil- 
lock, called Galea la-Know, which is faid to have been ufed in the Border 
wars as a; place of execution. Many buildings, finiilar to thofe defcribed, are 

fcattered over the country, efpecially on the Border, which were called peels. 

There is a tradition, that, during the animofities between the two kingdoms, one 
of the principal bells, now upon the cathedral of Durham, was carried from this 
parilh. Certain it is, that Oxnat* is inferibed upon it % but whether it be the 
name of this parifli, or of the founder, is not determined. Some are of opi- 
nion, that as Oxnam was fubjed to the abbacy of Jedburgh, the Crag Tower 
might be a religious houfe, and the bell is faid to have been hung upon it. 
Before the union of England and Scotland, which feem deftined, by their fitua- 
tion to conftitute a mighty monarchy, among the military and turbulent Bor- 
derers, fo little acquainted with the arts of peace, and fo averfe to induftry and 
labour, juftice was feebly, irregularly, and partially adminiftered ; and great op- 
preffion and violence prevailed, when rapine was the only trade, and bloodfhed 
often led the way to the fucccfsful profecution of it. By the interpofal of the 
authority of both houfes of parliament, the reign of good laws is cflablifiied, 
tending, in an eminent degree, to form habits of order, induftry, and virtue, to 
increafc the happhnefs of individuals, to promote national profperity, and to in- 
troduce a taftc for general improvement, throughout this, as well as other parts 
of the kiugdom.

Lothians by Bofwel's Green, where one of the hrrgeft fairs in, 
Scotland is annually held, on the f8th of July. 

Roads. — Formerly, the ftatute labour, for county roads, 
from 20 to 22 feet broad, was levied from the number of roera 
and horfes, of late at is. for a man, and is. 6d. for a horfe. 
In confequence of an application from the gentlemen of this 
county, a few years ago, an a® of parliament was granted to 
collet it from the tenants according to their valued rents, but 
not to exceed ics. Sterling upon the 100L Scotch. The 
county is divided into four diftrias, Jedburgh, Kelfo, Hawick, 
and Melro/e, and each of them has a conftable for infpeding 
the roads, and for feizing vagrants. Though thefe do not all 
colled to the full amount fpecified in the aft, yet it is found 
neceffary to do fo in this diftrift of Jedburgh, on account of 
its being mterfefted by fewer public roads. A road is now 
making, from Wooden-bur* Bridge, in the parifh of Crailinr 
and Kaimburnfoot in this parifh, conneaing the great turn 
P1 ke roads from Kelfo to Hawick, and from Edinburgh by 
Jedburgh, to Newcaftle. In order to complete it fpeedily W 
public fpirited gentlemen have taken out a cafh account to 
be paid off every half year with the ftatute money Att'en 
tion has alfo been paid to other roads in the pariih, whereby

communication is greatly facilitated. Not long ago, fmall 
coal was brought from Ryechefter, and great coal from Ital, 
on horfeback, but they are now brought in carts, which have 
been univerfally adopted fince the bettering of the roads. 

Difadvantages.—rOne of the chief difadvantages, the greateft 
part of this parifti labours under, is its diftance from coal, 
which is ftill, notwith (landing, the cheapeft fuel to thofe who 
have horfes, but which popr people cannot afford to purchafe. 
A two-horfe cart-load of coal, from Ryechefter, cofts 12s. 6d., 
and one from Ital cofts about 14s. 6d. Though this parifti 
abounds in excellent peats and turf, yet the moft populous 
parts have no claim to them, and are but fcantily fupplied 
with turf, of far inferior quality, from a moor, once common, 
and which ftill goes by that name. Another growing difad- 
vantage is ? the depopulation of the parifti, by fuffering the 
cottage houfes to fall into decay ; whereby the country is de- 
prived of many ufeful members of fociety, and the tenant of 
aid for carrying on his labours, efpecially in harveft, when he 
is overtaken by ftorms, particularly of wind, which often do 
great and irreparable damage to £he valuable productions of 
the year. 

General QharaBer.--T^ people are indnftrious, fober, and 
economical, and feem to have no inclination either for a mili- 
tary or a feafaring life. They are friendly to one another, 
and hofpitable to ftrangers. The labouring part fupport their 
families in a very decent manner, and give their children a 
tolerable education. Even in 1783, when the pennons of the 
poor were doubled by the failure of crop 17S2, no family in 
the parifti folicited relief from the heritors, nor were fupplied 
with provifions, at reduced prices, as was the cafe in many 
other parifhcs*

DUMBER XXVI. 
PARISH OF ROSEMARKIE. 

{County and Synod of Rofs—Prejbytery of Chanonry.') 
By the Rev. Mr. Alexander Wool?, Minifler, 



Name and Extent. 

THE name of this parilh was anciently fpelled RoJJhiarhie, 
and fometimes Rofemarknic. The molt probable ac- 
count of the origin of the name is this: To the parifli church, 
in former times, was annexed a fteeple, in an elevated and 
confpicuous ftation, which being one of the firft objects 
obferved by mariners in coming mp the Murray Frith, 
they would naturally fay' to one another, " Mark ye Rojs !" 
which, for the fake of better found, was turned into Rolf, 
markie. The extent of the parifli, from E. to W., is about 
6 miles in length i and 3 miles in breadth, from S. to N. 

Situdtion, Soi/ t Climate, and Difeafes. — The fituation of the 
parifli is very fine and pleafant, as it rifes gradually from the 
feaj and the hills, both on the S. and N., are for the moft part 

arable, 



334 Siati/I'ical Account

generally on a deep clay bottom, producing oats in great 
aoundance, that make excellent meal. As the country U JJ 
and has the benefit of fine fea breezes, the air is pure and L 
lubnous, fo that few contagions d.ftempers make their an 
pearanoe and when they do, their progrefs is nuickly checked! 
The fmall-pox, that, m former times, ufed to make the greateft 
ravages,' rs now alleviated by inoculation, to which ev-„ the 
lower ranks of the people begin to be reconciled I„ this 
parifh, very few children have died of that diftemper for th, 
laft 20 years. 

Coajt, Shell Fi/b, and Caves.-The coaft all along, between 
Rofemarkie and Cromarty, is bold and rocky. I t abounds 
with romantic views, and frightful precipices. Along thefe 
the ivy creeps in ragged cliff,, where hawks and wild pigeons 
ncftle, and 6 

" Low brow'd rocks hang nodding o'er the deep." 

Crabs and lobflers are dragged from holes among the rocks, 
with old corn hooks, by country women; and feals are often 
feen on them, and otters lliot, though not very numerous. 
There are likewife a variety of curious natural caves along 
the more, fome of them very deep, and one that runs quite 
through the rock, for about 50 yards, affording an open 
paffage to fuch as wi£h to examine it. Some of thefe have

been ufed as a temporary lodging by filhers, when there was 
a great run of herring, and others reforted to by ftnugglers. 
ag fit places for concealing of their prohibited articles. 

Woods, Fijheries, Ferry, &amp;c. — Though large tracks of the 
pariih were of old covered with wood, it had become quite 
exhaufted. In the courfe of 20 years back, fome confider- 
able plantations of firs have been railed, which are very thriv- 
ing ; and as the parifh is but poorly fupplied with mofs, thck: 
will be a ufeful fund for fuel. There is a falmon fiihing at 
the Point of Chanonry Nefs, where the falmon are caught, 
frefh from the fea, in their higheft perfe&amp;ion. About 40 
years ago, it was rented at a 100 merks Scotch. It now pro- 
duces 70I. Sterling. The Point here proje&amp;s a good way in- 
to the fea, and forms a fine curve, which makes it a beautiful 
objed. It terminates the Links of Fortrofe, about an Eng. 
lifh mile in length, and fmooth as a carpet. This is fine ground 
for the golf, which is often played here by the gentlemen of the 
town and country, "the Point is the fituation for the ferry, 
boat that paffes to Fort-George ; and fo fafe is the paflage, 
that there is not a 0 inftance of any being loft on it in memory 
of man. 

Agriculture, Produce, and Cattle.— The common Scotch 
plough is for the mod part ufed in the parifh 5 but fome 
farmers begin to prefer that with the feather fock, as mod 
convenient, efpecially for turning lee or meadow ground. The 
number of ploughs in the country and town is reckoned to 
be about 60. Thefe are commonly drawn by 6, and fome- 
times 8 middle fixed, or rather fmall oxen, which are found 
beft adapted for fteep or hilly lands, and go through their 
labour with much ftcadinefs. Small horfes are employed in 
trying manure, yoked in a fort of light fledge, rolling on 

0 wooden

336 Statiftical Account 

wooden wheels. But where the ground is tolerably level, 
many farmers now begin to ufe coups, drawn by a couple of 
oxen, which make the work much eafier and more expediti- 
ous. Horfes are chiefly employed in cultivating the lands 
about the burgh. The method of farming there, for time 
immemorial, has been remarkably uniform. It confifts of a 
conftant fucceffion of barley ; and though the lands be feldom 
or never refted, it is furprifing how much they produce, bearing 
commonly fix or feven returns. When a quantity of fea ware 
and tangles are thrown afhore (which often happens in a ftorm), 
the farmers, in fpring especially, are very attentive in gather- 
ing it, and fpreading it upon their lands ; and they reckon it 
an excellent manure for a barley crop. They feldom take 
time to mix it in a compoft dunghill, though that might better 
anfwer the purpofe. Of late, they have begun to ufe the roll- 
er, which in light foil they find to be an advantage. In the 
country part of the parifh, the tenants are not fo accuftomed 
to raife green crops, but frequently fow oats in the fame fields 
for feveral years running, which renders them much lefs pro- 
ductive. A large quantity of potatoes is raifed here, of a very 
free and fweet quality. Some of the farmers have flocks of 
fheep, of a fmall kind, which are paftured on heath, and 
among whins and broom ; but their flocks are not numerous*. 

Improvements.— Btrt it may not be amifs to take notice of 
a fmall improvement lately made by the minifter of the panfli, 
which, in fimilar operations, may ferve as an example and 
encouragement to others. Very near the manfe, on the fide 
of the public road to Fortrofe, there was a lake, covering be- 
tween , aad 4 acres, in winter filled with water, running 

down

down from a hill above it, and kept in by a rifing ground on 
the fide contiguous to the king's highway. Owing to this, 
it was, in the middle, at leaft four feet deep ; and a fmall 
boat has been feen paddling through it, with perfons in 
queft of wild ducks. By the ftagnation of the water in 
the heat of fummer, and the fteeping of lint by the people 
(which- raifed a moil difagreeable and unwholefome frriell), 
it was often an intolerable nuifance. Many fchenes had 
been formed for draining it, but they were generally thought 
impracticable. However, the writer of this, considering that 
his glebe, which lay directly oppofite to it, on the other fide of 
the road, was upon a bank of gravel, (having firft taken a feu 
of it from the town, at a reafonable feu-duty), determined to 
cut a very deep drain acrofs the road into his glebe, fo as to 
command the level of the water (which required about 14 feet 
.in depth), and then to let it off by degrees, in hopes the gravel 
bank might fwallow it. The experiment anfwered his expecta- 
tion j and, in- the courfe of lefs than a month, there was not a 
drop left in it. He then cut a wide and deep ditch by the 
lide of it, to receive the water as it fell from the hills ; and, 
befides a number of crofs drains, filled with ftones, he dug 
under ground an open drain, faced with ftone and covered with 
flags, communicating with the bottom of the ditch, and convey- 
ing the water, for more than 150 yards, into the bankof chingle, 
where it finks, and never more appears. Sometimes, indeed, 
on a fudden thaw, or a violent rufh from the hills, the drain 
cannot immediately command the water, and fo it breaks out 
upon the furface ; but in a fhort trad of fair weather it goes 
down, and leaves a {lime, which ferves to enrich the foil. 
Thefe operations were attended with considerable expence; 
but the fuccefs has amply repaid it. From a fingle boll of 
Eflex oats, fown here in 1789, in fcarce an acre and a half, 
there were actually reaped 22 bolls and 2 firlots, a very exl 
tfaordinary return. The (talks in many partes were from 6 to

7 feet long. Lafl feafon a part of it was laid down with large 
glolTy- black oats, from a farm in Aberdeenlhire*; and though 
the feed happened to arrive rather too late, it produced a good 
return. This fpecies of black oats is a new grain in this coun- 
try, but they are faid to meal remarkably well, and a few 
bolls of them have been circulated to give them a fair trial. 
It is hoped the length of this article will be excufed, as it 
may incite others to make the like ufeful experiments. ' 

Population — An exaft enumeration of the inhabitants of 
the parifa was made out lalt fpring. From the lofs of fome of 
the old regifters, and the negligence of the people in regifler- 
ing the births of their children, the baptifms cannot be ftated 
with perfed accuracy. No regiiter of burials has been kept 
in the parim ; but as its fituation is uncommonly healthy f, thefe 
rather fall below the ordinary proportion. In mod years, the 
births of males and females are nearly equal ; but upon the 
whole, the males are moft numerous. All the inhabitants are 
of the Eftablimed Church, excepting one or two families in 
the town of Chanonry, who are of the Epifcopal perfuafion.

lands and tenements. None of the principal heritors refide in 
the parifh. The total valued rent is 3753I. 13s. 4d. Scotch ; 
the real rent is about 1350 bolls of grain, and above 500I. 
Sterling in money. About the burgh, lands are rented from

fhoemakers not only furnifh fhoes for the parifh, but carry a p a ce ] weekly for

Burgh. — The town of Rosemarkie, though not large, is 
of conliderable antiquity. It was erected into a royal burgh 
by Alexander King of Scotland ;— -which of them is not fpeei- 
fied, but it was probably Alexander II. About a mile to 
the W. of it, ftands the town of Chanonry, fo called from its 
being the chanonry of Rofs, where the bilhop formerly had 
his refidence, and which is now the prefbytery feat. It was 
united to the burgh of Rofemarkie, by a charter granted by 
King James II. anno 1444, under the common name of Fort- 
rofs, now foftened into Fortrofe ; which charter was ratified 
by King James VI., anno 1592, and confirmed in a ftill more 
ample form, by the fame monarch, in the year 1612. Thefe 
charters bear, that it was to be " entitled to all the privileges, 
" liberties and immunities, granted to the town of Invernefs." 
Fortrofe is then fpoken of, as a town flourifhing in the arts 
and fciences, having been at that time the feat of divinity, law 
and phyfic, in this corner of the kingdom*. 

Court Hill. — Above Rofemarkie there is a circular hill, 
quite level on the top, which feems to have been artificial.

* About 6 years ago, a parcel of filver coins were found in a fmall cairn of 
ftones, in a moor, about a mile from Rofemarkie. They were moftly fhillings 
of Queen Elizabeth, with a mixture of other coins, and particularly fome beau- 
tiful ones of James I. and Charles I. of different ftzes. It is probable they were 
depofited there in the time of the civil war, and may have been brought to the 
country by the gallant Marquis of Montroie, or fome of his followers. Moft 
of them are in the poffeffion of Mr. Wood, the minifter of the parilh. About 
300 more filver coins were found lately, in a maffy copper jug of an antique 
form, in digging up the foundation of an old houfe at Chanonry. They were 
coined in the reign of Robert King of Scots, and are nearly of the Gze of a Britilh 
(hilling.

It has been always called the Court Hill. In ancient times, 
it was probably the place where courts were held, for the ad- 
ministration of juftice. 

Cathedral, Only a fmall part of the ancient cathedral * 

now remains. This Teems to have been a wing that ran front E. 
to W., with an arched roof/ about 100 feet in length, and 30 
in breadth. It had a communication, by entries or porches, 
with the main body of the cathedral. It was preferved and 
repaired, by fome of the biihops, finoe the Reftoration, as a 
place for public worihip ; but now it has gone much to de- 
cay f ; and as the roof is in danger of falling in, it is quite 
deferted. It is ftill ufed as a burial place by the M'Kenzies, 
and other old families in this country. No infcriptions are to 
be found about it worth notice, excepting one on a large old

* Though, the Bifliop of Rofs was originally ftyled Epifcopus Rofmarkic»f, 
the cathedral church flood in the town of Chamonry, in a fpacious fqtia're. 
Here the bifliop refided, with a number of his cltrgy ; fo that there is fcarcc &amp; 
feoufe in' the burgh, of any great value, but was formerly a manfe belonging to 
fome of the chapter, as appears by the ancient charters and infcftments. The 
epifcopal fee was founded by David I. king of Scotland ; but there is no certain 
account at what period the cathedral was built, though it is faid to have been a 
fine one, with a lofty fteeple. Bifliop Leflie alfo takes notice of the palace, 
which flood at a little diftance from the houfes of the canons ; and he reprefeM3 
it, in his time, as a fplendid and magnificent building. 

f It is highly probable, that this cathedral, at the Reformation, had fullered, 
the fate of many others, though it be a current tradition in the place,, that the 
greater part of it, together with the bilhop's palace, already mentioned, was 
pulled down irt the time of Oliver Cromwell. By his order, the ftor.es were, 
carried by fea to Invcrnefs, about the diftance of S miles, for erecting a fort 
there, called Cromwell's Fort, whereof the ditch and ramparts are ftill difcern- 
ible. No chartulary belonging to the bifliopric has been found in Scotland. It 
is probable that Lefly, the laft Popifli bifliop of Rofs, and the zealous advocaic 
fur the unfortunate Queen Mary, when he was forced to go abroad, carried all 
the writs of the diocefe with him. either to France, or to Bruffels, where 
he died ; and where thefe parchments may ftill be mouldering in duft and 
folitude.

The hnlory of our faint, according to tradition, is limply this. In the year' 

(93, or, as others fay, about the year 6 97 , Boniface, an Italian, a .rave and 

venerable perfon, came to Scotland, to make up our acquaintance, with the 

church of Rome. He built, to the memory of St. Peter, a church where he 

landed, at the mouth of a little water, betwixt the flares of Angus and Mearns - 

ereded another church at Felin, a third at Reftennoth, and a fourth at Rofe' 

markie ; where, being taken with the pleafantnefs of the place, he thought fit 

to refide, and was buried there. Bifhop Lefly fpeaks of Rofemarkie as deco 

rated with the relidts of the faint, and the very ancient fepulchres and mom, 

ments of him and his parents; whence it would fcem, that he had brought h» 

parents from Italy with him, in this pious expedition. 

f Befides this famous faint, tradition reports, that there was buried in this 
place a Dan.fh chief, of a large fize, who fell in a battle fought in the Mull 
Buy, ah extenfive moor about 3 miles diftant. There are, indeed,, evident marks 
of graves and battles ; and fome huge piles of ftones, in digging among which 
feveral ftone coffins have been difcovered. In this moor, it is probable, the in- 
habitants of the country fought the Danes, after they had landed at Cromarty. 
In the church-yard, too, lies the body of Andrew Murray, a very brave man, 
regent of the kingdom in the reign of David it, who, after defeating the Engl 
lifh in many battles, and quieting the ftate of the nation (according to Buchanan'), 
having gone to the north, to take a view of his pofll-ffions there, died in rj-jg 
and was buried at Rofemarkie.

From the traditional account of St. Boniface annexed, there 
is ground to think, the prefent parifh church had its foundation 
laid by him. In repairing it, anno 1735, in a vault, under 
a very ancient fteeple, there were found fome Hone coffins of 
rude workmanfhip, one of which might probably contain the 
bones of this venerable apoftle. To perpetuate his memory,, 
we have here an annual market, called St. Boniface Fair, 
and a well of excellent water is alfo diftinguifhed by his name. 
Nay, what is flill more, the feal of the old cathedral is yet 
preferved, and ufed as the public feal of the burgh, with this 
infcription, in Saxon chara&amp;ers, *J scapituli scoa.* Petri

Above 2 chalders are drawn in teind Jheaves, or in kind, from

tenants, for many years, having turned at leaft a fourth part 
of the lands into potatoes and grafs, (from which the miniflcr 
receives nothing), his living is thus diminifhed. He lias like- 
wife, on account of thefe drawn teinds, a valuation in the pa- 
rifh of 104I. Scotch, by which he pays cefs, and is burdened 
with a proportion of the expence of kirk and manfe, and 
fchoolmafter's falary. This he reckons a hardfhip j and as 
the drawing of the teind from the fields is very troublefome 
and difagreeable, for this and other reafons, he has been ob- 
liged

liged to apply to the Court of Seffion, to have thefe teinds 
paid in another manner, and his living put upon a hetter and 
more certain footing than it now is f. Kenneth M'Kenzie, 
Efq. of Cromarty, is reckoned p3tron of the parifh. The 
prefent manfe was built in 1756, on a rifmg ground, directly 
oppofite to Fort George ; and commands a fine extenfive 
profpeft of the Murray Frith, Invernefs, Nairn, and the ad- 
jacent country. It is juft about to be repaired ; and is fur- 
rounded with the glebe, confiding of about 4 Scotch acres. The 
church (lands about a quarter of a mile diftant, in the town 
of Rofemaj-kie, on a dry bank of fand, near the fea more. 
Jt was built upon the old plan, uncommonly long and narrow, 
which is very difagreeable to the preacher ; but when the 
prefent roof fails, it is hoped the heritors will have it re- 
built, in a more proper and commodious form. 

Poor. — The lift of the poor in the parifh is above 60. In 
this, however, are included a good number, who, though able to 
work for themfelves, receive fmall annual fupplies, efpecially 
when they are known to have young families. Thefe the 
minifter and kirk-feffion endeavour to proportion to their real 
SeceSities. Few or none of them travel about to feek charity 
3n other parifhes. The fund for their fupport arifes from the 
weekly .collections in the church, which may amount, through- 
out the year, to between 81. and cd., and a fmall capital of 
above 200I., laid out at intereft, with fome rents of feats in 
the church. In the late hard years they were forced to en- 
croach upon their capital, for the fubfiftence, not only of their 
ordinary poor, but of many other families, then reduced to 
very ftraitened circum fiances. Belidcs this, there are two 

mortifications

mortifications for the poor of Chanonry ; the one by Barbara. 
M'Kenzie Countefs of Seaforth, anno 1680, of 17 bolls 2 
-firlots land rent, under the adminiftration of the minifters of 
Rofemarkie and Avoch ; and the other of 27 bolls, from fome 
lands difponed by Bifhop Paterson, and others purchafed 
-with money mortified by Sir Alexander M Kenzie of Coul, 
whereof the magiftrates are adminiftrators. Ttiefe are no 
doubt ufeful, but would be much more fo, had they been def- 
tined, or could they be regulated, fo as to operate as an incite- 
ment and reward to induftry. John Fowler, Efq. a native 
of this place, who died Jaft year in Jamaica, has alfo bequeath- 
ed iool. to the poor, and 100 guineas to the academy. 

Academy The origin of this inRitution is a little Angular, 

And will require a particular detail. In the year 1699, ThoiHas. 
Forbes, bailie of Fortrofe, who feems to have been a good 
and pious man, mortified (funk) a bond of 1800 mcrks Scotch, 
or tool. Sterling, for a falary to a catecbift and examiner of 
the inhabitants ; until, by the charitable donations of others, 
fuch a fum might be contributed, as might produce an annual 
jftipend for a minifter of the Eftablifhed Church, ferving the 
cure in that burgh. This bond was granted to him by Isobel 
Countefs of Seaforth; and, in the deed of mortification, the 
minifters of Rofemarkie and Avoch, are left folc adminiftra- 
tors of the fund ; John Dallas and Hugh Baillie, then writers 
in Fortrofe, having been nominated during their lifetime only. 
At what time this money was firft received, or how it was 
applied for many years, there is no evidence to be found. It 
is certain, however, that the mortification was much neglecled, 
and in danger of being entirely loft. Its recovery was greatly 
owing to the exertions of Mr. Alexander Rat, minifter of 
Avoch, with the afliftance of Mr. Nicol Spence, then agent 
for the church, who'were forced to raife a procefs againft thofc

principally concerned in it, which began in 171 7, and 
tinued till I73I ; w hen they recovered what the., could, and 
got the money fettled to bear intereft. On the death of Mr. 
Ray, in 1735, the fund fell chiefly under the management of 
Mr. John Wood, late minifter of Rofemarkie, who bellowed 
on it the utraoft attention j and, notwithftanding focne misfor- 
tunes, to which all human affairs are liable, by the power of 
accumulation, and the care of the adminiftrators, in laying it 
out to the bell advantage, it is now brought up to a capital of 
about 2000L Sterling. And, fince the year 1746, a fmall fa- 
Jary of 30s. yearly has been alfo paid from it, to a catechift 
in the town of Fortrofe. 

The prefent adminiftrators, Mr. Alexander Wood, minifter 
of Rofemarkie, and Mr. James Smith, minifter o Avoch, find- 
ing the fund in fo thriving a date, from their own attention, 
to it, as well as the fidelity and diligence of their predeceffors, 
began to think in what manner they might apply if to the 
moft ufeful purpofe. With a view to this, it occured to them, 
that it could not be employed better than in the eftablifhment 
of an academy at Fortrofe. To this they were invited much 
by the healthy fituation of the place, free from temptations 
to vice, and abounding with many fine walks and places of 
cxercife for the fludents. They faw likewife, that this could 
be effected, fo as fully to anfwer the intention of the pious 
donor, and to be productive of the befl effects to the community. 
This inflitution has been accordingly formed. With the aid 
of a liberal fubfciption from the gentlemen of this county, and 
many others, (to the amount of above 6oz\. Sterling), the 
administrators purchafed a new houfe and garden, in a very 
agreeable part of the town, commanding a moft pleafant pro- 
fpeft ; and have built another houfe in the fame fquare, with 
excellent rooms for teaching, and other accommodations. One 
of thefe houfes is dcftined for the reftor, and the other for the 

teacher.

teacher of mathematics ; and both are very fit for lodging 
boarders. 

In this bufinefs, the adminiftrators are happy in having 
the affiftancfe and fupport of feveral very refpeaable gentle- 
men of the county of Rofs, who are named Vifitors of the Aca- 
demy, to obferve that the regulations be properly attended to ; 
and each of thefe has the privilege of fending to it any young 
man they pleafe, to be educated without paying fees to the 
matters. The inftitution is yet in its infancy ; but, from a 
variety of circumftances, there is little doubt of its fuccefs. A 
finer or healthier lituationfor fuch afeminary, is not to be found 
in Scotland ; and, as there is now a very frequent intercomfe 
by trading veffels, this affords a cheap and eafy conveyance 
to Fortrofe from London, Leith, and other principal fea ports ; 
and ftudents who attend here, among many other advantages 
in point of health, may have the benefit of excellent fea 
bathing. 

The prefent vifitors are, Sit Heclor Munro of Novar, K. B.; 
Francis Humberfton M'Kenzie of Seaforth ; Sir Hugh Munro 
of Fowlis, Bart.; Sir Charles Rofs of Balnagown, Bart.; Sir 
He£tor M'Kenzie of Gairloch, Bart.; Donald M'Leod, Efq. 
of Geanies, fherriff- depute of Rofs and Cromarty ; Charles 
M'Kenzie, Efq. of Kilcoy; Kenneth Murchifon, Efq. of Tar- 
radale ; David Urquhart, Efq. of Braelangwell ; and Robert 
Bruce iEneas M'Leod, Efq. of Cadboll. To thefe, other gen- 
tlemen will be added from time to time, who prove bene- 
factors to the academy. 

The adminiftrators will require about 300I. more, to com- 
plete their plan, in finifhing the buildings, purchafing mathe- 
matical instruments, and making up a decent library, which 
they hope yet to be fupplied with by the liberality of the 
public. They find that this bufinefs occupies much of their 
time, and has been attended with no fmall gevfonal trouble ;

but this they will not regret, if it turn out, as they expeft, for 
the general utility. The reclor teaches the Greek, Latin, 
EngliOi and French languages ; the fecond rnafter, arithmetic, 
book-keeping, geography, all the branches of mathematics, na- 
vigation, perfpeftive drawing, &amp;c; and a third rnafter is em- 
ployed for initiating children in the elements of the Latin and 
Englilh languages, writing and arithmetic. 

Language. — It is fomewhat remarkable, that in this, as 
well as the neighbouring parifhes of Cromarty and Aroch, 
the minifters preach only in Engliih, which is the common 
language of the people ; and it has been remarked by travel- 
lers, that even the lower fort of them pronounce it with eafe 
and propriety. In this parifh, no Gaelic is to be found, but 
among, a few fervants who come from-the Highlands ; and 
they foon acquire the Englifh by their refidence here. From 
this, it mould feem, that thefe parifhes were not originally 
peopled with natives of thefe northern regions, but by perfons 
who came by fea to fettle here, invited by the pleafantnefs 
and fertility of the country. Among thefe, there has pro- 
bably been a mixture of Danes. 

Eminent Men. — Sir George M'KENzrEof Rofehaugh, that 
eminent ftatefman and able lawyer, pafied a part of his time 
at Fortrofe, and had a particular attachment to it, on account 
of its delightful walks and profpe&amp;s. Dr. George M'Ken- 
7 q , too, the laborious compiler of " the Lives/ of the mofl 
*' eminent Writers of the Scotch Nation," refided here, in an 
oldcaftle belonging to the Earl of Seaforth, an&amp;lies interred in 
the tomb of that family in the cathedral. And Dr. James 
M'Kenzif, who writes " the Art of preferving Health," is faid 
to have been for fome time employed in teaching the grammar 
fchool of the burgh,-

mfadwntages.-lt is to be regretted, that the ftate of im- 
provement, in this and the neighbouring parimes, is ftill fo 
far behind, though moft of the heritors have fet a good ex- 
aWe to their tenants. This proceeds from different caufes. 
The principal one is the want of leafes, fufficiently long to 
encourage the people to improve their farms. What induce- 
ment can a farmer have, to be at any extraordinary pains m 
improving his foffeffion, by inclofing, railing turnips, fown 
grafs, &amp;c when, at the expiration of a fliort tack, he mult 
either pay an additional rent, or be deprived of all the fruits 
of his toil and induftry ? Another ferious grievance, to the 
farmer, is the fcarcity of fervants, arid the increafe of their 
fees. The young fellows, for the moft part, either go into 
the army, or travel to the fouth, where they meet with better 
living, and higher wages. It is certain, however, that every 
man has naturally a ftrong attachment to his native place, 
which makes him very unwilling to abandon it. Surely, 
then, it muft be the intereft of all : concerned, to induce the 
people to remain at home, by every reafonable encouragement. 
This will always be found the moft effectual method. 

Circumjances attending tie S&amp;arcjty &amp;i'782-3;-^Intfcis coun- 
try, the crops ina great meafure failed in 1782 and 1783, which 
■were remarkably hard for the farmers. Yet none here, at 
that time, were fuppofed to have died of real famine. The 
white peafe and other grain from England, on the event of 
the peace, afforded a movV feafonable fupply to many poor fa- 
milies. One thing remarkable was, that in thefe years, fevere 
as they were, fewer were fick among the parilhioners, than have 
been obferved before or fince ; which may in a great meafure 
be attributed, to their being unable to fpend their money in 
drinking fpiritous liquors, and thus being obliged to live 
fobcxly. Another good effeel: proceeded alfo from this tem- 
porary

porary fcarcity s-that various kinds of grain having bee* 
then imported, from England and other countries, they were 
fown in various foils, and on different farms ; and according 
to the goodnefs of the produce, they were preferved and con- 
tinued in the country. The early oats were particularly dif- 
tinguifhed, which, upon late frrms, are found to be of the 
greateft benefit. This has rendered thofc farms far more va- 
luable than they were formerly. 

Farming Society — It gives pleafure to the writer of this - , to 
obferve, that within thefe few months, a fociety has been' 
tbrmed, under the name of the Rofsflrire Farming Society, of 
which he and fome other clergymen are members, that pro-' 
mifes to be of fervice to the county. It confifts already of 
above 5c members, who have contributed a fum of money 
for the public benefit ; and as it is propofed to branch it out 
into feveral committees, it will probably prove more exten- 
ilvely ufeful. In a little time, it may excite a fpirit of emu- 
lation among the practical farmers, who will thus have an 
opportunity of communicating to one another their obferva- 
tions and experiments, which maybe the means of introducing 
valuable improvements. Now that the duty is taken off the 
coals imported to the north, this will tend much to forward 
the views of the fociety, and facilitate tlie operations of the' 
farmers. 

Propofed Improvement^ — The parifli of Rofemarkie is ex- 
ceedingly well fituated, for a manufacture of coarfe linens or 
Ofnaburghs, which might be carried on here to great advan- 
tage. To this branch the inhabitanss are already much ac- 
cuftomed. The price *f fpinning is cheap; on which ac- 
count flax and tow are brought here from Aberdeen, to be 
given out to fpin, and the yarn returned by the merchants to

their correfpondents, being allowed a certain rate for commif- 
"xon A *ood deal of flax is raifed in the parifh, which would 
no double increased, but for want of a lint mill to drefs it. 
It would be of confidence fervice to the people, to have a pro- 
per one erefted, by encouragement from the truftees for im- 
provements and manufaaures, or by any of the proprietors. 

Ale-Houfes.—Thtxe is every reafon to complain of the 
number of obfcure tippling houfes, in this as well as the ad- 
jacent parifhes. Thefe have the moft baneful effeds in injur- 
ing the health, wafting the fubftance, and debauching the mo- 
rals of the people. Many, by haunting them too often, bring 
ruin on themfelves and their families. It is much to be wifh- 
ed, that fome effeftual courfe were devifed and put in execu- 
tion to crufh them 

CharaBer. — The minifter, however, has the fatisfaaion to 
fay, that the inhabitants of the parifh, in general, efpecially 
thofe of the better fort, are fober and induflrious, moderate in 
their principles, and decent in their condud; and free from thofe 
contracted notions and religious prejudices, which are flill fo 
prevalent in more northern parifhes, and fome other parts of 
Scotland.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5315298">DENINO</name>. 

(County and Synod of Ffe-^PreJbytery of St. Andrews.) 

By Mr. William West, SeJ/ion Clerk and Schoolmajer,</head> 



<p>Origin of the Name. 

SOME perfons, little lefs fanciful, perhaps, than intelligent, 
think, that Denino derives its origin from the Gaelifr 
word Dunynacb, whofe firft conftituent fignifies a hill, and the 
two laft young women. This feminine original feems, in their 
judgments, to be deducible from the apparent fimilitude of the 
Gaelic word to the name "Denino. They infer, therefore, that 
Denino and the Hill of Virgins are terms perfectly equivalent. 
But ^imes, and manners too, are doubtlefs much changed fince 
the primary impofition of this fo very pure and endearing 
title of our parifli. Unfortunately, there is not the leaft cir- 
cumftance, either in tradition or record, tending to eftablifh 
the authenticity of this derivation. Indeed no circumitance 
appears fo decifive of the matter as the local fituation of Deni- 
no. The fimple confideration of its ltanding in the immediate 
vicinity of a large and deep den, where, in right oppofitiou to 



of Den'ino, 353 

It, two huge rocks feem to threaten an embrace over the per- 
ennial ftream below, appears to have naturally fuggetted the 
name, Denino; or, in other words, the Village on the Den. 
And, when it is further known, that, unlefs in cafes of inac- 
curacy, or of inadvertency, the ancient and modern ortho- 
graphies of Denino are uniformly the fame, the latter opi~ 
nion, with regard to its original, muft appear the more cre- 
dible. The firlt fy liable of the word being attended with no 
difficulty, by only admitting a common tranfpofition, as to 
the two remaining ones, Denino and the Village ON THE Dek, 
will appear plainly fynonymous. 

Situation and Extent.— The parifh lies among the eaftern 
diftrifts of the county of Fife, on the road between St. An- 
drews and Anftruther. The extent of Denino is uncommonly 
.circumfcribed, being fcarcely 3 miles in length, and little more 
than half as much in breadth. 

Figure, Surface, Rivulets and Fijh — The form of the parifli 
is pretty regular ; diftinguiftied by no interferons from other 
parilhes ; to a good degree paralellogramical ; with a large 
extent of its centre furrounded by circularly riling ground, 
which, being generally but barren, produces a lingular conca- 
vity of very confiderable fertility. It is beautifully inter- 
fperfed with a variety of fmall rivers, abounding with trout 
of various fpecies and of moderate fize, but of fuperior fla- 
vour. The wild and protuberant banks of thefe rivulets, if 
fuitably decorated with thofe diverfities of plantation, with 
which, to the honour, and, eventually, to the emolument of 
their propri '^nrs, they now begin to be occupied, muft pre- 
sent fcenes highly pi&amp;urefque and gratifying.

Soil, —This parifb, though furrounded pn every 

hand, almoft, by extenfive moor, deftitute nearly of what 
plight, at a very trifling expence, compared with future re- 
turns, contribute to general gratification and indulgence, in 
addition to the more intimate advantage and pleafure of indi- 
viduals, is far from being barren. Though, from the fmall- 
nefs of the extent, no perceptible variation of air, or of cli- 
mate, can be naturally expe&amp;ed ; yet this is not the cafe re- 
fpe&amp;ing its foil, which is confiderably diverflued. Some of the 
ground confifts of a black and light, but tolerably fertile loam, 
yefting upon a gravelly bottom ; while a large proportion of 
it difplays a foil of a deep and ftiff clay, with a bed of white 
land light fand. The molt juft idea of it, however, will be 
Jiad from, the information, that the foil, in general, is, in a 
great meafure, wet and fpungy ; in molt of the farms of the 
parifti, frequently broken by large fwamps and fens ; and, 
though pretty well adapted for producing corn, is principally 
remarkable for crops of artificial grafs and natural pafturage. 
Some of the proprietors, therefore, availing themfelves of this 
obvious property of their eflates in this diftrict, have, with 
much fuccefs, converted them into thofe fpecies of farms, for 
■which their lands are thus fo very well calculated. 

Climate and Difeafes. — Denino, fheltered from np quarter 
by any confiderable planting or eminences, except by fome 
riling ground towards the S. W., is often expofed to great 
•winds from the fea, which, blowing with great force and 
fharpnefs, concur with the natural coldnefs of the foil, in ren- 
dering the frequent humidity and bleaknefs of the climate, 
the more fenfibly felt. The air and climate are, however, of 
fuch a nature and temperature, as to occaiion but few inter- 
ruptions in the health and native gaiety of the people, the 
rheumatifm and hyfteric complaints being the chief diforders 

which 



of Demno. 355 

which occur. The inhabitants, though commonly healthy, 
and many of them long-lived, furnifh no inftances of remark- 
able longevity. 

Minerals and Mineral Waters.— Coal feems, from the vaft 
number of old pits in various places of the parim, to have, 
fome time ago, been a very plentiful article here. There 
is ftill, it is faid, plenty of it in feveral eftates of this Mfict ; 
but it is uncertain when any Of its proprietors will open thefe 
mines, .or rather, whether their future gains would cdmpen- 
fate the expenditure necefiary for that purpofe. Free-ftone is 
alfo found in much abundance ; but, though of an eafy accefs, 
and of a tolerable good quality, it is feldom called for beyond 
the limits of the parifh. The ere&amp;iori and reparation of en- 
clofures, particularly on Sir William Erfldne's eftate of Deni- 
no, and the building of his tenants fiibftantial premifes, are the 
chief ufes to which it has hitherto been, and is ftill occafion- 
ally applied. There is an uncommon variety of places in 
the parim, where ochre is found, particularly at a number of 
chalybeate fprings. Between 30 and 40 years ago, thefe 
were much reiorted toj for relief in diforders, chiefly fcorbutic j 
but of late they have loft much of their former celebrity ^ 
though, to all appearance, very undeservedly, 

Curiojties, — Towards the S. W. end of the parifh of De- 
ninoj there is a moft remarkable fall of water, of probably 
near 20 feet, from the fhelve of the rock to the common fur- 
face of the very deep pond, into which, among a vaft number 
of the finny race, (and which, according to the conje&amp;ures of 
the inhabitants, forms the boundary of their journeying up- 
wards,) it pours almoft perpendicularly. This fall, from fome 
kdicrous, but perhaps natural, analogies, has, for time im- 

^7 2 memorial, 



35 6 Statl/lieal Account 

Memorial, been conftantly known bya very mark'd appellation. 
To the pond below there is no accefs, but up either fide of 
the headlong current, overhung by rocks, fome of them im- 
minent and dreadful ; while the immediate entrance to the 
pond is narrowed, by the feemingly artificial and mutual pro- 
jection of two rocks, erected in the form of pofts, deftined for 
doors and hinges ! The only artificial curiofity, is a fubterra- 
neous canal, of nearly 30 yards in length, of between 4 and 5 
feet of an average breadth and height, and dug from the one 
end to the other, under a folid and continued rock of free- 
Hone, about 20 yards from the furface of a large piece of 
arable ground, actually peninfular. This very ingenious con- 
duit, which forms the peculiar haunt of a few otters, was, about 
60 years ago, effectuated by one of the then refiding heritors, 
with an intention of conducting, through below the founda- 
tions of this ifthmus, an increafe of water to his mill, in its 
remote vicinity. The expence, attending the atchievement 
of fuch an aftonifhing piece of work, was no lefs than three 
pounds Sterling, and a loll of meal I and for the damage occa- 
fioned by the intake, as it is ironically called, there is ft ill an 
yearly allowance of 2s. and 3 firlots of oats, made by the 
tenant of the above mill, to a tenant of another, through 
whofe farm the water runs, before its difappearance in the 
mouth of its invifible receiver. There are two or three echoes 
to be met with in the parilh, which merit no defcription. 

Population. — Theparilh records of Denino extend back only 
to a little before the middle of laft century ; and it is fome- 
thing curious to obferve, that the ftate of population was then 
very little above what it is at prefent. From 177 1 till to- 
wards 1778, the population of the diftrid of Denino appears 
gradually to have decreafed, till it affumed its prefent feem- 
ingly 



of Den'ino.

Inhabitants 



* For fome time preceding the middle of the prefcnt century, the principal 
part if not the whole, of the parifh hufbandry wa, performed by cottagers; who 
enjoyed, as a material perquifite of their fervices, a fmall portion of land.- 
The parifh alfo abounded with pendiclers, or inferior tenants. Thefe, therefore 
and the cottagers, together with a confiderable number of families employed in 
the coal mines, but moft of all, the divifion of farms, and employing of hired 
fervants in their cultivation, contributed much to the multiplication of the in- 
habitants; and hence it is eafy to perceive the caufes of fo remarkable a depo- 
pulation ; which is a natural confequence of the union of farms. More than 
30 inhabited houfes exifted in the parifh, about half a century ago, ofhich 
fcarcely a fingle veftige now remains, It may be remarked farther, that the 
converfion of a very large extent of the diftrict into grafs farms, has operated 
very materially to the decreafe of the people, by employing a much fmaller 
number of fervants of either fex. 

f This is the average, after making a proportional deduction, for the many 
burials from other parifhes, that take place here, on account, it is faid, of the 
fuperiority of our burial-ground. In the above averages, the baptifms, marri- 
ages, and burials of the inhabitants of Kings Muir are included ; it being found 
impoflible, from the connexion they neceffarily had with Denino, to make any 
exact difcrimination from the records.

preceding 1790, are as follows ;

Proprietors, Rents, and Improvements. — None of the pro-, 
prietors refide in the" parifli. A few remains of the very an- 
cient and venerable feats of their progenitors lie in it, in the 
wildeft {late of ravage and of Gothic defolation ; and which, 
whether reitored according to their former conftitution, or 
after a modern and more refined plan, mult, at any rate, af- 
ford but indifferent accommodation for their more illuftrious 
fuccefiors. There is a fmall farm in this parifti, of 17 acres, 
belonging to the kiik-feffion of Ely, a confiderable village 
about 5 miles S. of this ; and there are 4 feuers in it, whole 
feu-duty, to Mifs Scott of Scotftarvet, for about 12 acres 
of pretty good ground, is 5I. 2S. 4-^d. Within lefs than 30 
years, the landed property of the diftrict, of Denino has un- 
dergone frequent changes, and has always been attended with 
confiderable augmentations in the purchafe. The whole rental 
of a confiderable eftate in it, little more than 20 years ago, 
was only 196I. per annum, though now it draws no lefs than 

500I. 

• It is fomewhat remarkable, that there neither are, nor have been, for an 
unknown time paft, any Jboemulers in the parifli of Denino, notwithftanding of 
the inceffant demand for their fervices in every other place. To remedy as 
much as poflible, however, this inconvenience, the parilhioners arc far from be- 
ing defpicable menders of fliocs. The circumftance of being, at the neareft, 3 
miles diftant from any makers, has taught them this article of ingenuity. 



3 6° Stati/lical Account 

500I. a year. The average price of the whole parifli is nearly 
105. 6d. an acre ; good farms letting at about 15s. per acre, 
at an average. The very beft may be about al. ; the fecund 
about 1 as.; while the inferior kind is not worth more than 
5s. an acre. Laft year, a confiderable eftate here, though al- 
moft wholly uninclofed at the time, was fold for 5,000 gui- 
neas, which was no lefs than 35 years purchafe. What has 
chiefly contributed, to raife the price of land to fuch a degree, 
is the now general practice of inclofing, which only commen- 
ced in this diftrict, about ao years ago, but ever fince has 
made the moil rapid advances. Moft of the inclofures of the 
parifli confift of dry ftone dikes, topped with a (tony layer, 
of {tones placed upon their edges, and the whole caft with 
lime. Inclofures, confifting of ditch and hedge, likewife go 
fall forward, and are paving the way for an univerfal emula- 
tion on thofe grounds, which beft agree with fuch kinds of 
inclofures — The valued and real rents of the whole diftrift 
are ftated in the table. In calculating the latter, the feus are, 
not included. 



Agriculture. — There is only a fmall proportion of the pa*, 
rifli under grain; but that fmall part is well cultivated. Dur- 
ing the ftiort fpace of 20 years paft, the Hate of our cultiva- 
tion has undergone very confiderable improvement; infomuch, 
that the ground, which formerly was let for about 2s. 6d. an 
acre, on an average, is now rented at near 14s. an acre ; and, 
even at this rate, it is thought fufiiciently cheap. There is 
perhaps fomething in the management of the grafs farms in 
the parifli worthy of remark : Of fuch fmall portions of them, 
as are folely occupied by oats and barley, the fpecies of grain 
for which their foil is naturally adapted, the tenants are pro- 
hibited from taking any more than two crops running ; and 
of thefe farms alfo, which are almoft all arable, about a fixth 

part 



of DenhiOi 



part is annually under the above fpecies of crops ; the one 
half, or near it, is to be yearly fown down with clover and 
rye-grafs. This lingular rotation mull be uniformly and 
punftually obferved. There being fcarcely any cattle ufed 
in hufbandry here, and only 5 cottagers employed in it, who 
have portions of land for part of their labour, the hired fer- 
vant cultivates his fields with 2 middle fized horfes yoked in 
a plough, which is almoft uniformly of the Englilh conftruc- 
tion.

Pajiurage, Sheep, IsV.-F. om a furvey of the above tables, 
it appears, that there are only about V 1 acres of the parifh 
of Denino under real crops. There are fully 180 acres of 
perfeft moor m it, of no ufe, unlefs perhaps for planting, of 
Which it is hitherto deftitute. The parifh is, however, adorn- 
ed with nearly 60 acres of planting, confiding, in a great de- 
gree, of ftripes, as they are called, and judicioufly enough de- 
fi ned for cheriming the cold grounds, where they flourifli i n 
beautiful and plentiful variety. There are, in the laft place, 
generally about /40 acres of fallow in the parifli ; fo that, if 
from 2280 acres, which the whole diftrift of Denino contains, 
we deducl: 991, the number under corn, fallow, &amp;c. &amp;c. there 
will appear a balance of 1289 acres of natural and artificial 
pafturage ; upon the laft divilion of which, great numbers of 
excellent cattle are fed, during the fummer, by the graziers, 
and either occafionally difpofed of, to the itinerant merchant, 
or driven to the country markets. The number of flieep in 
the pariih does not exceed 20 ; they are kept and fed by fome 
ef the farmers, for their own ufe only, during the fummer. 

Prices of Labour and Provijions. — From a view of the 
table of the annual produce, it appears, that the parifh mull 
do confiderably more than maintain its inhabitants. The ave- 
rage prices of the feveral fpecies of gtain, therein fpecified, 

1 are 



of Denino* 363 

are ftated as regulated by the county fiars ; or rather, by the 
general ftate of the market — The yearly wages of a labouring 
man-fervant, are 71. ; and thofe of a woman, 3I. The day- 
labourer has is. a day, without meat; as. 2d. per acre, for 
hay cutting; and for making ditto, or for turnip hoeing, either 
hy males or females, 6d., and fometimes 7d. per day. The 
price of a goofe here is commonly 33. ; a hen, is.; and eggs, 
3fd. a dozen ; butter fells at 8d., and cheefe from 3d. to 6d. 
per pound ; pigeons, 3d. a pair ; chickens at 4d. each ; rab- 
bits, (animals very common in the parifli of Denino), at 6d. 
a pair, without the lkin ; and butcher meat, univerfally, at qd, 
per pound. 

Eccljiajlical State The manfe, almoft thrown down from 

the foundation, and rebuilt, on a durable conlb ucliun, about 
the year 1741, is a tolerably decent houfe, 2 ftories high, 
and contains 6 moderately good rooms, with a kitchen, and, 
fame other apartments. Since its kft ere&amp;ion, it has un- 
dergone very many repairs. The glebe contains little 
more than 41 acres of Englifh tneafure. worth about iL 10s. 
per acre, if duly cultivated. The ftipend confiUs of 24L irj 
money, with 5 chalders, or 8c bolls of vi&amp;ual ; the one half 
meal, and the other bear. The whole annual income, ex- 
clulive of the manfe, and a tolerably good garden, is about 
90I. Sterling. The church is one of the fmalieft of country 
churches, nerhaps, with an aile, and afmall jjprch by one oJ its 
frontdoors. It is uncertain when it was built; bu Joine perions 
are perfectly fure of its havi.g been very lately and very ma- 
teri'lly repaired. Mr. James ISroWN, ordained 13th May 
1790, is the prefent miniller ot Denino. 

School — The fchool houfe is a very fiiort, low, thatched, 
fcoufe, and, though not verj old, a very crazy edilice. The 

Z s 2 fciioolj 



oH Statical ccount 

fchool, very fortunately for the health of the teacher, as well 
a of thofc who are taught, is large, and capable of containing 
a few more fchoWs, befides the parochial ones ; a great num. 
Ber of whom commonly attend it. Befides a very good gar- 
den, of 8 by 12 paces, there is a falary of IO o merks 
(jl us. Old. Sterling), and the feffion-clerk's fees, which 
amount to al. 15s. 8d.; with an occafional gratuity of 5 s. 
Stcrlj g, at the difpenfation of the Lord's Supper, for extraor- 
dinary fingjp|, The fees for teaching are, for Englifh, is. 3d.; 
for reading and writing, is. 6d.; for arithmetic, as.; and for 
Latin, as. 6d. Other branches of education are feldom de- 
fire, ; and even the laft not very frequently. Moft of the 
peo le have a laudable ambition to have their children edu- 
cated ; and the payment of the quarter fees is fcaraely ever 
grudged, though often paid with a good degree of tarainefs, 
arifing from the actual penury of fome of the parents. The 
dues on a pi (clamauon of marriage, are as. 6d. when regu, 
lar, one third whereof goes to the beadle ; and, when irregu- 
lar, or perforr.ed in fliorter time than the church ftandards 
die! te, an additional gratuity is commonly given by the 
e loyers. r ^he dues on each baptifm are is., of which the 
beadle gets 3 Id, ; and thofe on certificates are 6d. each, of 
w hich the beadle has no mare. The feffion-clerk has alfo 
4d. each for regxftraiing burials. His annual income, altoge- 
ther, does not exceed 2l\., at an average, one year with ano- 
ti-er. Such, howe ver, is the liberal provifion allotted for the 
far greater patt of thofe members of fociety, from whofe fer- 
viccs rruff ever, aindamentally, proceed whatever is elegant 
and resectable in the lives and manners of their fellow 



pll zens.

ed in the payment of falaries , fuch as, the feffion-clerk s, 
the beadle's, the preibytery clerk's, te. Sec ; w.th vanous 
repairs ahout the church, the fchool, and fchool-honfe ; and even 
about the public bridges of the parilh. Thefe repairs, how- 
ever devolve upon the kirk-feffion, who defray thefe expences 
only in fuch cafes as they judge unworthy of an apphcat.on 
to the heritors of the parilh. But, at any rate, thofe who 
have their falaries as above, paid from the poor's funds, 
are perhaps equally neceffitous with thofe for whom they 
were originally deltined. Upwards of l S l, was expended 
lately in the purchafe of a new pall, without touching the 
poor's capital. 

Antiquities, r.— It is affirmed, that there are fome relics 
of antiquity in the parifli, but they happen to exift more in 
the imaginations of the credulous antiquary, aided by fuper- 
ftitious report, than otherwife. There are only two even of 
thefe: the one is a Dmidical temple, which is faid to have 
ftood in the vicinity of a place called Balkethly ; from which, 
(in the opinion that Baal, the Sidonian deity, and the God 
of Jezebel, was worftiipijd there), it is aflerted to have de- 
rived its name. Of this Druidical temple not the moft fmalleft

poor of thts parilh; the principal proprietor of the coal-mines 
here having entered into an agreement with the proprietor of 
an adjoming colliery, to keep his own coal-works (but till 
thofe of the other (hall be completely exhaufted ; in return 
for whtch the other has bound b.mldf, and his heirs, &amp;c. , 0

patilfc,

jparifli, as well as the adjacent country, are deprived of a hlef- 
fing evidently intended for them by Providence ; and oblig- 
ed to purchafe fuel from a confiderable diftance, at a higher 
price, and of a worfe quality. To this effential, and feem- 
ingly irremediable grievance, may be added, mill thirla^es^ 
which, however, , are not fo much felt in this as in other 
places. 



KING'S MUIR. 

Name, Privileges, %3c. This is a very extenfive tract of 
ground, containing more than io«o acres. It is called King 1 * 
Muir, on account of its being, fome time after the reftoration of 
Charles II. conferred by that Prince upon one Col. Borthwick, 
who had attended him in his adventures and exile, previoufly to 
Us attainment of the throne, as a reward for his attachment 
and fervices. This is the account given of its origin by Mr. 
Hanno, the prefent proprietor. Moft of the ground of this 
ancient royal donation is, as its name infinuates, extremely 
wild in appearance ; though, upon the whole, much lefs un- 
fertile than might be expected. The proprietor, however, 
is of opinion, that, taking all of it together, it is not worth 
more than is. 6d. an acre j while others rate it much higher. 
It is wholly exempt from afleffment ; and the circumftance of 
its not yielding either minilter's ftipend or fchoolmafter's fa- 
lary, feems, in the conjectures of many, to have clafled it 
with no pariQi whatever. Its inhabitants have, neverthelefs, 
either from their vicinity to our church, or the popularity of 
its mimfters, always confidered themfelves as parifhioners of 
Denino, in the moft decided preference to Crail ; in whofe 
parifli they are afferted, by a few, to be legally included. As 
the prelent laird of King's Muir has not his charter by him, 

we

we (hall leave the determination of this eontroverfy, to thofe 
who may think it worth the investigation. It may not be 
amifs to obferve, however, that although the people of King's 
Muir have, for time immemorial, conne&amp;ed themfelves with 
the diftrift of Deuino, quoad faCra ; yet tliere is a little farm, 
fituated between this paiiih and it, which pays ftipend to the 
xninifter of Crail, as he himfelf fays, though perfectly uncon- 
nected with King's Muir, and belonging to a different pro- 
prietor. The moft fertile parts of King's Muir are parcelled 
out into fmall farms, let by the lump, tu perfons, moft of 
whom are either tradefmen, or work, during a great part 
of the year, by day-labour. The population of it is as un« 
der ;

Proprietor, Rent, Minerals, \Jc The eftate of King's 

Muir is now entailed on the name of Hanno, the furuame of 
its prefent laird, whofe whole yearly rental amounts to iool. 
There is nothing remarkable in the King's Muir, befides its 
containing the coal-mine above mentioned, and one of the 
two mines that convey the water from the links, which was 
dug nearly 50 years ago, being more than 300 fathoms in 
length ; in moft places 9 ditto from the furface of the earth 9 
originally 18 inches wide, and 3f feet high. The coal here 
was hitherto wrought by a wind-mill, no veftige of which 
iemains j but will in future be wrought by a different ele- 
ment, 



of Denino, 369 

ment, and by different machinery, The cflate of King's 
Muir is wholly devoid of planting, and no lefs deftitute of 
enclofures, or any kind of fence. This large piece of ground, 
apparently an outcajl from all parilb.es, as its inhabitants are 
fometimes humouroufly told, by thofe of the adjacent diftri&amp;s, 
would, with that extenfive part of this pariih, which went to 
complete the vicarage of Cameron, but which ought ftill to 
pay fome proportion to Denino, form a pariih of a very re- 
fpeciable extent. 

General Cbara&amp;er.—Of the inhabitants of this pariih it 
may juftiy be afferted, that induflry and hofpitality, fincerity 
and an obliging behaviour, are their general characleriftics. 
They are alfo noted for moderation and fobriety, generofity 
and candour. From thefe virtues there may be, however, as 
is but too natural, not a few deviations. The bulk, of the 
people, though poor, are contented and refigned. The mi- 
nority, whofe circumftances are more affluent, appear to in- 
dulge as much in the luxuries of the table, and of drefs, as 
the fuperiority of their fortunes can we 1 ! countenance. The 
inferior claffes feem to be uncommonly fond of pei-fonal de- 
coration ; and rather than (as they imagine) difgrace the 
back, they will often ftarve its fupporter. This remark is, 
perhaps, not more applicable to the one fex than to the other; 
or to this diftria more than to other parifhes. Spiritous li- 
quors produce, at prefent, fewer unpleafant fcenes than fome 
time ago. Notwithfianding the general penury of the di- 
ftria:, the inhabitants are proof againft the fordid invafions of 
avarice. As a fpecimen, both of the morals and natural 
tempers of fome of the individuals in the pariih, let the fol- 
lowing fa£t fuffice : Two men in the pariui of Denino have, 
for nearly 30 years, held a confiderable farm arid mill in con- 
junttion; preferving every article, regarding their external 

Vol. Xf. o a

37° Statiftical Account 



property, in perfeft community, their wives and private 
property only excepted. The people in general are humane ; 
and, as far as means will allow, more than ordinarily chari- 
table to the poor. 

Language. — Refpech'ng this article there is nothing at all 
linking, except that the vulgar dialect is remarkably exemp- 
ted from the corruptions that abound on the coaft, as well as 
from many of thofe Scotticifms, and uncouth phrafes, fo pe- 
culiar to many other places, whofe inhabitants lay claim to a 
higher degree of refinement. This bit of lingo- eminence may 
have arifen from the vicinity of Denino, in common with 
many other adjacent diflrifts, to Ahna Mater ! Agreeably 
to the general practice of the county, the inhabitants here 
difplay a lingular hollovvnefs in the accentuation of their 
words, with an unufual prolongation of the final tone of 
their fentences ; all aided at leaft by the antique manner of 
enunciating fome of the vowels and diphthongs.

By the Rev. Mr. Gavin Gibb, Minijler o/'Strathblane.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, and Extent. 

•^jpHE name of this parifh is of Gaelic origin, and fignifies 
Fair Land. Contrafted with the bleak and precipitous 
rudenefs of the adjacent moors and mountains, its grafiy 
hills, its fertile and well watered valleys, entitle it to this 

appellation. Fintry is lituated in the midft of that range of 

hills, which reaches from Stirling to Dumbarton, and behind 
that particular diftricl of them ufually denominated the Camp- 
fie Fells. It lies 17 miles due N. from Glafgow, 12 miles 
W. by S. from Stirling, and 21 or 22 miles E. by N. from 
Dumbarton. It belongs to the commiffariot of Glafgow. It 
extends from E. to W. 5 miles, and from N. to S. more than 
4 ; though the only parts of if, which are inhabited, are a 
f.nall valley on the banks of the Endrick, and another on 
the banks of the Carron j both of which rivers have their 
fource in this parifli. 

General Appearance — The general appearance of the coun- 
try is hilly. The hills are fmall ; they are clothed with re-

frefhing verdure ; and their fhapes are finely diverfified. C 
vered with fheep, they fuggeft many paftoral images. Tb. 
eauern part of the parifh coiififfc of three ranges of hills, with 
fcarcely any intervening plain. Between the two fouther- 
moft of thefe ranges, the Canon bog or meadow commences ; 
the largeft perhaps in Scotland. Beginning in Fintry, it runs 
E. between the parilhes of Kilfyth and St. Ninian's to the 
extent of 4 miles ; is in fome places 2 miles in breadth, and 
in no place lefs than 1 ; containing about 500 acres in one 
continued plain. It affords fuftenance during the winter to 
the cattle of the furrounding farms. This remarkable mea- 
dow, befides its utility, adds great livelinefs and beauty to 
the general face of the country. The fcene it exhibits du- 
ring the months of July and Auguft, of 2D or 30 different 
parties of people employed in hay-making, is certainly very 
cheerful : And during winter, the greater part of it being 
overflowed by the Carron, which runs through the middle of 
it, and which is then induftrioufly led over its whole extent, 
to fertilize it for the enfuing crop, it afiu mes the appearance 
of a large and beautiful lake. In both nutations, it affords an 
agreeable relief from the bleaknefs of the country around it. 
Towards the well end of the parifli, the hills are mere rocky 
and rugged. The valley through which the rapid llream of 
the Endrick runs, widens gradually to the extent of a mile. 
Several groves, recently planted, beginning to lift their heads 
along the banks of the river; the cultivated fields on its mar- 
gin ; the hedges and hedge rows round the enclofures on the 
eftate of Culcruich ; an extenfive plantation behind the man- 
fion-houfe of that name ; and fome well-difpofed clumps of 
trees on the fides of the oppofite' hills, gratify the traveller, 
not only with a view of beauty, but of well-diredted induftry. 
Above thefe, the fummits of the mountains on both fides, bro- 
ken, and prcfenting abiupt precipices, and fometimes covered

frith clouds, add grandeur and dignity to the fcene.— The 
profoea, however, is confined within narrow limits, excepting 
towards the weft, where it is terminated by Benlomond that 
rife5 with eminent dignity above the neighbouring Gram- 
plans. Thus fenced and fevered, the little hilb and va U 
feys of Fintry fuggeft ideas of tranquil and undifturbed f - 
clufion. Nor can any thing of the kind be more agree i e 
• than when in fummer, the fun letting by the fide of Benlo- 
mond, throws a blaze of parting radiance on the romantic 
banks of the upper Endrick. 

^7— The foil in thofe parts of the parifh which are fit for 
agriculture, is light, quick, and fertile ; agrees better with 
dung for manure than lime ; and, when enriched with the 
former, produces excellent crops. Some recent experiments 
however have fhewn, that when the ground is paftured for 
two years, then limed and allowed to reft another year, it 
will thereafter yield better crops, than by any mode of huf- 
bandry hitherto praftifed. 

Cultivation and ?roduce.—\xv agriculture, however, the in- 
habitants have made but few improvements. They follow 
fervilely the ancient mode of pafturing, and of /owing oats, for 
two or three years alternately on their out-field, and of uni- 
formly fowing as much land with bear as the winter's dung will 
cover ; and from which they afterwards take two fucceffive 
crops of oats. However a few of the farmers are now beginning 
to get the better of thefe prejudices, and find their account in 
altering the mode of cropping. In making this change they 
have been inftrucled and prompted by Mr. Spiers of Cul- 
cruich, who, fince his refidence on his eftate, has fet the ex- 
ample of clearing the ground with turnips, and has introdu- 
ced the fowing of grafs and clover feeds for hay. The bene-

w;th turnips and potatoes ; in fowing next yeaf beaf whh 
grafs feeds ; m ramng hay for two years ; in pafturing one 
or two ; in fowmg oats for two years , and then in returning 
to the turnips. This routine anfwers very well, and , with 
the angle amprovement of taking only one crop of each 
kind and paftunng two years, is beft adapted for this foil, 
winch, being light, is foon impoverished by a continuation of 
crops, and if not regularly cleaned by pafturing and crops of 
turmps, is apt to be over-run with the creeping wbeat-grafs 
known by the vulgar name of felt, or pirl-grafs. There is 
no foil better adapted for railing potatoes, of which the in 
habitants plant confiderable quantities; after which they 
commonly fow flax-feed, which fucceeds very well, yielding 
from three to four ftones from each peck fovvn. 

Cattle.— But the attention of the inhabitants is, with very 
few exceptions, confined to grazing* which is by far the 

moll 

* Under this article it is but juftice to mention the name of David Dun, a 
man whofe exertions, in improving the mode of grazing, are truly laudable, and 
to whofe example its prefent advanced ftate, through a confiderable part of the 
weft of Scotland, is in a great meafure owing. He has the merit of firft im- 
proving the breed of black cattle and fheep, by raifing them to a greater fize, 
and feeding them more thoroughly, than was ever done hefore upon grafs alone. 
This he has accomplifhed, by judicioufly feledling the moft choice cattle, to (lock, 
his farms with, and by keeping his grafs lighter, i. e. by putting fewer cattle 

upon the fame fpace of ground, than what had been ufedin former times As 

a fpecimen of his fuccefs in this branch, the writer flates the following fa&amp;s, 
which are well atteftcd. At one time he fold a Highland ftot, which was kill- 
ed

xnoft beneficial mode of ufing the ground in this parifli, where 
hill and vale equally afford moft excellent pafture for black 
cattle and fheep. They ufe the plough therefore chtefly with 
a view to the fuftenance of their cattle through winter, a S 
fodder is the gieat object of labour. In fome of the farms 
the rent is folely paid from the produce of milk cows ; in- 
deed butter and cheefe form the ftaple produce of the panlh. 
Feeding of cattle is alfo generally praflifed. In the month of 
May, each farmer buys a number of Highland cows, propor- 
tioned to the extent of his farm, which he fattens during 
fummer, and again fells off in the months of September and 
Oaober. When markets are bvifk, and fales ready, this is by 
much the moft convenient and advantageous method of ufing 
the ground in this parifh, as the excellence of the pafture 
during fummer, enfures the fattening of the cattle purchafed, 
and the difficulty of procuring fodder for winter prevents the 
rearing any more than are neceffary, to keep up the flock of 
milk-cows. Sheep are alfo an objed of attention. The 
breed is in general good, a confequence of the excellent paf- 



ture 



ed in Glafgow, and weighed, according to the yurchafer's confeffion, $% ftones 
beef, and to ftones tallow : the price he received was 45 guineas. At another 
time he fold 25 Highland ftots at izl. each, the lighteft of which weighed up- 
wards of 30 ftones. He fells annually about 60 tup-lambs of a year old, for 
which he never receives lefs than a guinea each ; and his lambs for killing he 
commenly fells in May, at half-a-guinea each. He carries on his plan on a very 
extenfive fcale, renting farms in different parts of the country, from one to ano- 
ther of which, he removes his cattle at the proper feafons, according to the qua- 
lity of the farm, and the ftate of the cattle. His ftots he fells at 5 years old, 
hut calves of his own rearing fometimcs equal his beft cattle, at three years old, 
and are accordingly fold at that age. When he dealt to the greateft extent he 
paid rents to the amount of 1800I. per annum ; the lar^eft proportion of which 
he paid to the Duke of Montrofe. His annual ftock at that time was 470 black 
cattle, and 1740 fheep, of which aoo were ewes, as a permanent ftock, from 
which he has frequently fold ia a year 300 lambs.

ture on which they graze, as well as of the care which is ta- 
ken to m^prove the (lock, by croffing the breed, and rearing 
none but the beft ewe-Iambs. Lambs are alfo frequently 
brought from the fouthem parts of Scotland, which improve 
greatly on this foil. The wool is of a very good quality. 
Lambs generally fell at 61. per fcore ; wool fells at from Js . 
to 73. per ftone. The following table will mew the number

Population — The population of this parifh, like that of 
mofl other grazing countries in Scotland, has decreafed very 
much within thefe 40 years. Since the return to Dr. Web- 
Iter, in 1755, it has decreafed more than a third part. There 
are feveral farms in the parilh, upon which from 14 to 20 
familes formerly lived, where only from 5 to 8 families now 
refide. This depopulation is evidently caufed by throwing 
feveral fmall farms into one, which enables the pofTeffor to 
pay a greater rent to the proprietor, and at the fame time to 
live better in his own family, than when parcelled out in 
fmall portions. Nor is this counted difadvantageous to thofc 
who are eje&amp;ed, as the great demand for hands by manufac- 
turing companies, affords them a ready reception; where they 
and their children can earn more, and live better, than upon a 
fmall farm. But, notwithftanding prefent opinions, it ftill 
remains a doubt, whether this revolution in the ftate of a 
country, will in the end prove a national advantage. Whe- 
ther a pallid and lickly race, brought up in the confined air 
of cotton mills, with few attachments, and little education, 
will comnenfate for the fturdy fons of our hills and moun-

ManufaBures and AW Pillage. — This pari(h is on the eve 
of experiencing a great change, by the introduction of ma- 
nufactures, on a very large fcale. A cotton mill is jult 
ere&amp;ed on the eftate of Culcruich, 156 feet in length, and 
40 feet wide 5 which, when finiftxed, will employ 1000 hands. 
A handfome village, upon a rifing ground along the fide of 
the Endrick, is already feUed off, and building for the recep- 
tion of the work people. The houfes, according to a regular 
planj are to (land in one row, and to cOnfift of two ilories 
and garrets. Thus lituated, the village will be well aired, 
dry and healthy ; and very pleafant, having the gardens in 
front, feparated from the houfes by the turnpike road) drelfed 
on a doping bank down to the river.

Proprietors and Rent.— The whole property of the parim 
is verted in the Duke of Montrose, and Mr. Spiers of Cul- 
criiich ; the former of whom is patron of the parifh, and the 
latter is the only refiding heritor. The prefent rent is between 
1500!. and ipocl.j but it may be expefted to rife confider- 
ably. 

Church, 13c — The church was built before this century : 
Part of it appears to be of a very ancient date. The manfe 
was built in 1732, and has undergone feveral repairs. The 
ftipend confirts of 44 bolls of meal, 5 bolls of bear, and 24I. 10s. 
Sterling in money; exclufive of the glebe, which contains 9 
acres, 4 of which are arable. 

poor — The poor of this parifli are fupported by the week- 
ly colle&amp;ions, and the intereft of a fund, which has accumu- 
lated to 200I. Sterling and upwards, chiefly by donations 
from the family of Montrofe. The prefent number on the 
poor's roll is 7, and varies from that 10. They receive, indi- 
vidually, according to their neceflities, from is. to 3s. weekly. 
Befides this dated diftribution, attention is paid to clothing 
the moft deftitute, and fupplying them with fuel. Thefe 
fupplies are adequate to their wants ; infomuch, that there is 
not, nor has been for many years part, a Angle inftance of a 
poor perfon, belonging to the parifli, going out to beg. This 
attention to their own poor, however, does not by any means 
free the inhabitants from the burden and plague of mendicants 
from other places. Crowds flock thither, from the great 
towns and populous villages, for the fpace of 33 miles round, 
who frequently repay the charity they receive, by making 
nightly depredations upon their humane landlords. 

Fuel.-— The fuel which has been principally ufed hitherto 
in this parifh, is peat ; in cutting, drying, and carrying home 
■which, the whole fummcr is fpent, from the end of feed- 
time, 



of Fintry. 379 

time, till the beginning of the hay harveft. This, were there no 
other obftacle, is a powerful bar to agricultural improvements, 
as the only time of the year, in which the farmers can carry 
lime, is fpent in preparing and fecuring their fuel. It is to 
be hoped, however, that this obftacle will foon be removed. 
An attempt is juft now making to find coal upon the eftate . 
of Culcruich, and appearances have hitherto been favourable. 
Whatever may be the ultimate iffue of this fearch, great praife 
is due to Mr. Spiers for his indefatigable exertions, in promot- 
ing every meafure that can contribute to the profperity of the 
parilh*. 

Roads and Bridges — Till within thefe two years, the accefs 
to Fintry was extremely difficult on all fides, infomuch, that 
had it not been rendered eafier, no improvement could have 
made its way thither. The difficulty was even fo great as 
almoft to forbid any attempt to remove it. A hill, almoft. 
perpendicular, over which horfes could fcarcely crawl with 
half a load, cut off the communication with Campfie and 
Glafgow, from which fide coal could only be got; and deep 
moor and roofs obftructed the approach on the N. and W. 
Thefe obftacles, feemingly infurmountable, are now happily 

3 B 2 overcome, 

* The mode of boring, which he* has adopted, is fuch as muft afcertain, 
without a doubt, whether there be coal in the country or not, and may ferve as 
a leffon to others, who may have occafion to make trial for coal in hilly countries. 
The top of the hill confifts of a very thick bed of whin-ftone, below which 
there is a bed of free-ftone equally thick. Beginning at the bottom of the 
free ftone, which is half a mile up the hill, with a 10 fathom bore, he takes the 
level of the bottom of this bore down the fide of the hill, making allowances for 
the dip and run of the metals, where he bores again to the depth of 10 fathoms, 
and fo on, continuing till he reaches the level of the river. In one of thefe 
bores there was found laft week a fmall crop feam of coal, which it is to be hop- 
ed is the forerunner of one of greater confequence. If the attempt fuccceds, 
it will be of the utmoft importance, to a tract of country for 10 miles round, 
the grcatcft part of which lies at prefcnt ao miles from coal.

overcame, by the public fpirited exertions of Mr. Spurs w4 
Mr. Dunmore. The gentleman laft mentioned, has formed, 
as t were, a new creation on the water of Endrick, and given 
hfe and fpjpt to a country which, 4 years ago, - feemed con- 
demned to perpetual dullnefs; having, in that fpace, brought 
from d,fferenr parts of the country, to the neighbouring pa- 
nines of Balfron and Killearn, no fewer than 1100 perfons. 
Both thefe gentlemen, with much private expence, obtained 
an aft of parliament for a new diftrift of roads, in the weftern 
parts of Stirlingfhire ; and, with a promptitude of execution, 
equal to their zeal in moving the meafure, have furnifhed this 
part of the country with as good roads as any part of Scot- 
land. The Craw Road, a mile in length and upwards, which 
was formerly 1 foot of afcent in 7, and in fome places 1 foot 
in 5, is now reduced to 1 foot in 20, in the fteepeft place. 
This line of road reaches from Glafgow through Fintry, and 
joins the. military road between Stirling and Dumbarton, about 
6 miles to the N. of this place. The county road to the W. 
is alfo now put into a ftate of repair ; fo that, from being the 
mofl difficult of accefs, Fintry is now eafily acceffible on all 
fides.— The bridges, on this line of road are numerous, and 
add very much to the eafe of the communication ; as the deep 
ravines formed by the mountain ftreams, which were former- 
ly very difficult to pafs, are all arched over, and filled up to 
the level of the adjacent banks. The bridge over the End- 
rick confifts of 4 arches, 2 of which are 26 feet wide, and the 
other two 12 feet each. The bridge on the old line of road, 
about a mile farther up the river, confifts of one beautiful 
arch of 47 feet wide, and another of 15 feet.

the Loup of Fktry, and inclofing part of the parifh within 3 
fides of a fquare. After receiving the river Blanc, and other 
plentiful ft reams, in its courfe, and forming 2 beautiful caf- 
cades at Gartness, the fpot where the famous Napier of 
Merchiston invented his logarithms, it lofes itfclf m Loch- 
lomond, about 14 miles below Fintry. This river abounds 
with trout and par. The trout are reckoned to be of a fupe- 
rior quality, and may be taken in great numbers, even by an 
unfkilful angler ; upon which account it is very much refort- 
ed to, by perfons fond of that amufement. Salmon, likewife, 
make their way in great numbers into the mouth of this 
river; fome of which, when the water is high, come as far 
up as Fintry. The Carron rifes in the W. end of the parifh, 
on the S. of the Endrick, and runs E. in a ftraight direaion, 
watering the Carron Bog in its paffage ; leaving which, itrufties 
over the AuchinlilyLinn Spout, a tremenduous cataraft, cor- 
refponding to an interefting defcription in the tragedy of 
Douglas, — - 

" Red came the river down," &amp;c. gtc 

From this it continues its courfe eaflward, through the Carfe 
of Falkirk, and falls into the Forth, about 3 miles from that 
town. It abounds with froall and large trout ; fome of which, 
taken in the pools in Carron Bay, meafure ao inches in

Natural Curiofities The only curiofity which is uni- 

verfally remarked in this parifh, is the above mentioned Loup

--There is alfo in this parifti a grand range, or colonnade,

patrick, Drumfdale, Hoddam, and Caftlemilk, (now St. Mun-

ly probable, however, that it mud have been about the year 
1250 or 1260, when the cathedral church of St. Mungo at 
Glafgow was built, from which this parifli has derived its 
name. Whether the whole of this parilh, or only a part of 
it, was then called Caflemilk, as mentioned above, cannot now 
be afcertained. 

Situation, Extent, Surface, Soil, and Minerals. — This parifli 
lies in that part of the county of Dumfries which was for-

xnerlv called the ftewartry of Annandale. It extends from 
N. to S. nearly 4 miles, and from E. to W. rather more. 
Being bounded with high hills to the E. and the W it ap 
pears like a valley to the traveller at a diftance ; and the rifing 
grounds in the middle of the parilh, called Nut-holm Hill*, are 
diftinclly feen from the heights above Moffat, on the very 
boundary of Annandale. From different furveys, the parifh 
is faid to contain about 4 cco Scotch acres 3 f part of which 
is of a loamy and fertile foil. On the Hoping fides of the 
rifing grounds it is more fharp and ftoney. The higher ground 
is in general the beft, and is all arable, except a very few 
fmall fpots, which contain iron and copper-ftone in abun- 
dance. Some free-ftone is found in the parilh of a white co- 
lour, fit for building ; and in fome parts of the lowlands 
there are lime-Hone and feveral valuable marl pits. 

Rive rs, Fifh, Mineral Water, Woods, tfc.-The river Milk runs 
along the N.E. fide of the parilh, and divides it from Tunder- 
garth ; afterwards it interfefts the parifh for almoft two miles, 
and, on the eaftern extremity, empties itfelf into the river sJn- 
nan. The Annan runs nearly 4 miles along the S. and W. and 
feparates St.Mungo from the parifiies of Dalton and Cammer- 
trees. Both thefe rivets abound with frefh water and fea- 
trout, falmon, and hirlings. Thefe waters were much re- 
forted to by fportfmen from diftant parts of the country, but 
fince the general ufe of lime as a manure, the number of fifh 
has greatly decreafed. In the Annan, a little below the

large hooks are tied together, in different diredions, on a 
ftrong line, having a weight of lead fufficient to make it fink 
immediately as low as the perfon inclines, and then by giving 
the rode a fudden jerk upward, the hooks are fixed into the 
falmon, which are thus dragged to land by force. Salmon 
and hidings are moll plentiful in thefe rivers in the month of 
Auguft. This parilh likewife abounds with fprings of excel- 
lent water ; and there is one mineral well, which, as far as 
the writer knows, has never been applied to any valuable 
purpofe. There are alfo feveral natural woods and planta- 
tions, the banks of the Milk being clothed with natural wood, 
beautifully doping towards the river ; and the hills orna- 
mented with planted wood on the mod confpicuous parts. 

Climate and Di/eafes, i$c. — The air is generally moifl for 
a confiderable part of the year. As the Solway Frith is only 
6 miles difiant, aud the country around is very hilly, greater 
quantities of rain are fuppofed to fall on this and the neigh- 
bouring pariflies, than in any other part of the county. Not- 
withftanding of thefe circumftances, no epidemical difeafes 
are prevalent here, and the inhabitants are uncommonly 
healthy, except that they are fometimes nfHi&amp;ed with the co- 
lic in rainy weather. 

Population. — The population of St. Mungo has varied con- 
fiderably at different periods :

Employments, Wages, &amp;c.-As this parifh is furroundedwith 
manjr thriving and populous villages, very few mechanics re- 
side in it. There are only 2 or 3 joiners, and about as many 
weavers, blackfmiths, and tailors. There are no writers, 
furgeons, nor flioemakers in the parifh. There is but one 
alehoufe, fituated on the turnpike road from Glafgow to Car- 
Me. The number of farmers, great and fmall, amounts to 
about 50 ; and of thofe who occupy cottages, the number may 
be nearly the fame. The farmers cultivate their lands them- 
selves, with the help of their families, fervants, and cott* 
gers. The wages of a man by the day have lately increafed 
to is. 4d. or is. 6d. in fummer, and to iod. or is. in winter; 
and of a woman to is. in fummer, and 8d. in winter. Servants 
hired by the half-year, and maintained in the houfe, are paid 
at the fame rate, 

Ecclefiajlical State, &amp;c — All the inhabitants are of the 
Eftablifhed Church, except 22. Of thefe 2 attend the Englifh 
Chapel, 2 the Kirk of Relief, 2 the Burgher, and 16 the An- 
tiburgher Meeting- Houfes in the neighbourhood. The church 
and manfe are fituated in the very extremity of the parifli to 
the S. W. on the bank of the river Annan, where the lands, 
which rife by a very gradual afcent, to the diftance of half a 
mile, in every dirc&amp;ion, have formed by nature a moft de- 
lightful 



* The caufc of the decreafe, between 1763 and 1784, is imputed to a divifion 
of the commons in the parifh, which took place about the year 1770. The 
poorer fort of the people, being thus deprived of fome of their former privileges, 
removed to the neighbouring towns of Lockerbie and Ecclesfcchan. Another 
circumftance might have contributed to diminifh the number of inhabitants. 
Sometime ago, a plan was adopted by fome of the heritors, of rouping their 
muir farms annually; whereby they were more thinly inhabited, and frequently 
poffeffed by the proprietors themfelvcs. Fortunately this caufc of depopulation 
it removed, the farms being now let on lcafc

iightful ntuationf. The prefept church was built in 1754, 
but feems never to have been properly finiihed. It is nei* 
ther plaftered nor ceiled. It has no bell ; and the feats are in 
a ruinous condition. There are only the traces of a dyke a- 
round the church-yard. — The manfe and offices were built 
only 7 years ago, at an expence of 374I. Sterling, and are 
already fcarcely habitable ! This Angular fa£t can only be 
accounted for, from the abfurd method, which the generality 
of heritors in this part of the country adopt, of contracting 
for manfes, kirks, &amp;c. with the friend of fome leading man 
in the parifli, or with fuch as will build them at the fmalleft 
expence. And though the preibyiery get tradefmen upon 
oath, to declare them fufficient, yet even this does not pro- 
duce the defired effect ; for fuch people generally declare, not 
that the work is fubjlantially executed, or that the houfes will 
ftand for a reafonable time, but only, that the money is laid 
out according to the ejlimate. Hence the houfes built at the 
expence of the pariflb, are fuperficially executed, and confe- 
quently productive of much additional trouble and expencej 

both to the heritors and to thofe who occupy them. The 

King is patron. The ftipend was formerly only 5CI. Ster- 
ling ; it is now 52I. 10s. excluhve of the glebe, which is efti- 
mated at 40I. per annum, being upwards of 40 Scotch acres 
of the beft land in the parilh. About 2 years ago the prefent 
incumbent obtained an augmentation of 4 chaldera of bear 
and meal, worth about 40I. more. There is no parochial 
fchool'm the parifli, nor any falary appropriated for the fup-

t Tn the centre of this vdla, where the manfe is placed, there are fome re- 
mains of an ancient village (built probably by the friars from Glafgow). and 
likewife of an extenfive garden, with a fifh-pond in the middle of it. Of thefe, 
the prefent incumbent hath feen many infallible proofs, though neither tradi- 
tion nor hiftory (as far as he knows) have thrown any light on the fubjedt.

port of a teacher. P rope r meafures are now taking to reme- 
dy this fliameful defect. 

Poor.— The number of perfons receiving alms from the 
parifli does not at prefent exceed 8 ; though it is fometimes 
greatly more. They are fupported by the colleftions at the 
church, and by the charity of their neighbours. Though 
none of them are permitted to beg from houfe to houfe, yet 
we are greatly molefted with vagrants from other pariflies. 
Some wife regulations, obliging the poor to content then 
felves with feeking charity within the bounds of their re- 
fpedive parifhes, were lately adopted by the juftices of the- 
peace, and had for a time a falutary effeft. The officers 
however, have become more remifs in enforcing thefe regula- 
tions, and vagrants are nearly as numerous as before. 

Proprietors, Rents, Improvements, &amp;c. — There is one con- 
fiderable proprietor, and about 19 others, who all refide, ex- 
cept two or three. One half of them poflefs their whole pro- 
perty themfelves. The annual real rent is about 1800I. 
Sterling, and the valued rent 2285 merks Scotch. The farms 
are in general let from 20I. to 80I. per annum ; and a few as 
low as 10I. About the year 1769, a fpirit of improvement 
was introduced into the parifli, the good effects of which are 
vifible, in the fubftantial farm houfes, enclofures, domeftic 
economy, and the general appearance of the inhabitants. 
The whole parifli is now enclofed, and the commons are un- 
der cultivation, which muft, in a few years, greatly increafe 
both the rent and the number of inhabitants. The greateft. 
part of the parifli is thirled to the mill of Caftlemilk, and 
pflys, of multure, nearly a 9th part of the whole ; which is a 
very heavy drawback on the improvement of the country.^

farmer who does not rear a foal annually, which at a year old 
generally fells at from 81. to 12I. 

Wild Animals.- -There are plenty of partridges and fome 
muir-fowl in the parifh. The fwallow, cuckoo, wheat-ear, 
and woodcock, are the only birds of pafiage. The king's- 
fifher frequently appears on the banks of the rivers. The lea- 
gull from the Solway Frith, 6 miles diftant, is the forerunner 
of exceffive rains or high winds. There are alfo plenty of 
hares, and feveral foxes, in the parifh. 

Roads, Fuel, &amp;c. The great turnpike road from Car- 

lifle to Glafgow runs through the E. end of the parifh, by the 
bridge over the river Mite* The converfion of the ftatute

Cattle ; and though his entrenchments (ftill diilindly vifible) 
had greatly the command of it, it flood out for a confidence 
time *. The Caftle was demolilhed in the year ^07 and 
converted into a dwelling houfe, which has fince been much 
improved. It is now one of the moft delightful and romantic 
fituations which can well be conceived, having fine pleafure 
grounds furrounding it, and a beautiful country in its neigh- 
bourhood. The prefent proprietor is Robertson Lidder-

<p>Name, Situation, and Extent. 

THE name Cambray, Cimbray, or Cimbraes, is faid to 
be derived from the Gaelic, implying a place of fhelter, 
or refuge. It is an ifland in the Frith of Clyde, furrounded 
by the fea, diftant from Largs a miles, upon the E.; from the 
Ifland of Bute 4 miles, to the W.; and feparated from the 
Little Cimlraes, upon the S., by a ftrait three quarters of a 
mile over. The length of the ifland, from N. E. to S. W., 
is 2t miles ; the breadth, from E. to W., ii miles. It is of 
an irregular figure. The furface contains about 2,300 acres, 
one third of which is, or might be made, arable. 

Hills and VrofpeBs. — With few exceptions, the hills rife 
with a gentle affcnr, to the various heights and forms they 

affumc. 



3 9 2 Statt/lical Account 

affume, from the fldrts of the ifland, till towards the centre, 
where they may come near 400 feet above the level of the 
lea ; and, unlefs in 2 or 3 places, they are not much incum- 
bered with rocks. The profpeft, from every point of view, 
is delightful; particularly from the S., where the Little Cim- 
braes, and the Point of Pencrofs, with their ancient caftles, 
bound it by fea. The Frith, too, often difplays the beau, 
tiful fcenery of the extenfive navigation of the Weft ; while 
that noble beacon, Eilfa, rifes towards the horizon ; and, to 
the N., Gatefield, in Arran, feems to fupport the clouds on 
its brow *. 



Climate and Lifeafes. — The ifland, being furrounded by the 
fea, and there being little marfliy ground, the air is pure and 
falubrious. Snow feldom lies long ; and froft does not pene- 
trate deep, unlefs in very fevere winters. Its effect upon the 
vegetables in the gardens, is much lefs than on the adjoining 
grounds. The parifh abounds with excellent fpring wa- 
ter. Thefe advantages, joined with temperance and induftry, 
contribute greatly to the health of the inhabitants. As an 
evidence of the goodnefs of the climate, there are at prefent 
(May 1793), 35 people above 60 years of age in the ifland ; 
an uncommon number advanced in years, in fo fmall a com' 
munity. There is no particular difeafe prevalent. Fevers 
rarely vifit the ifland ; and, when they do, feldom prove 
fatal f . Inoculation now prevails, which renders the fmall-pox 
both much milder, and more frequent. 

Soil, 

* Unlefs the weather 19 particularly clear, a cloud generally hangs on the 
top of Gatefield. 

•f-In the year 1783, a great number of people were attacked by a nervous 
fever ; but it proved fatal in only one inftance. The fmall-pox frequently made 
great depredations, when the infedlion was introduced but once in feveral years, 
which indeed was the cafe about 40 years ago, in moft places of Scotland. 
They generally appeared in thofe days with pcftilcntial malignity. 



of Cimbreas* 393 

Sbil Cultivation, Produce, and Minerals.-The foil, in ge- 
neral, 'is a gravelly loam, and fome clay. It produces good 
crops of oats, bear, peafe, potatoes, and fome flax The 
manure, befides what is made on the farms, is fea weed, and 
mells, with fmall coral, which they dig out of pits m feveral 
parts of the ifland. It has been obferved, that were the 
farms more generally inclofed, and fubdivided and improved 
by the introduaion of turnips and fown grafs, it would add 
much to the fertility of the ifland. The advantage of thefe 
improvements, and the addition of the manure, upon their 
farms, that fuch crops would produce, could not fail, with 
the induftry of the farmers of this ifland, to be highly bene- 
ficial, and would put the ground in a progreffive ftate of me- 
lioration. Were a plan of this kind properly formed, there 
ban be little doubt but fuitable encouragement would be given 
by the proprietors, by affifting them in inclofing their farms, 
and by lengthening their leafes, which are too fliort, and their 
renewal too precarious, for great exertions ; a circumftance 
which equally affeas the intereft of the proprietor and tenant. 
There is plenty of lime-ftone in the ifland ; but the great 
expence of coal has hitherto prevented its being ufed as a 
manure. There is alfo an unexhauftible fund of free-ftone. 

Trees.— There are few trees on the ifland ; but the few we 
have, feem to grow tolerably well. Lord Glafgow has made 
a fmall plantation of pines and Scotch firs, on a piece of 
moorifti ruing ground ; and, mould they thrive, the hills 
might be planted farther up ; and, affifted by the flicker of 
thofe below, in keeping them from the influence of the fea 
water, fuch plantations might, in time, be very valu- 
able, from the demand on the Clyde, and the advantage of 
water carriage.

Cattle, Commerce, Fifh, Manvfaclures, %3c There are at 

prefent, on the ifland, 33 horfes, 350 black cattle, and 347' 
Iheep. The prices of provisions are regulated by the Green- 
ock market. The farmers find a ready fale for what they 
can fpare, after fupplying their families, among the feafaring 
people and tradefmen ; who, belides a ready market, fave 
them the expence of carriage. The fifh chiefly caught here, 
are haddocks, cod, whitings, lyth, cuddies, mackerel, and a 
few herrings. Of ihell fifh , too, there is fome variety, but 
in no great quantity. No maaufa&amp;ures of any confequence 
have ever been attempted here. The chief obftacles, to any 
confiderable exertion in that way, are the expence of fuel, 
the want of a fufficient run of water to drive machinery, and

the ferry being often interrupted by dorms. From 1600 to 
3000 yards of coarfe linen, however, and fome linen yarn, 
are exported from the ifland ; with free-ftone, to the value 
of fully more than 20cl. a year*. 

Village, Harbour and Roads— The village of Milnport, con- 
tains about 60 houfes, which have been moftly built within thefe 
25 years, and are ftill increafing. It is pleafantly fituatedon the 
S. W. fide of the ifland, and has a commodious dry harbour, 
that will admit veflels of confiderable burden, particularly du- 
ring fpring tides, when the water rifes from 10 to 12 feet along 
the Chores. There is alfo an anchoring ground, which is well 
flickered by a fmall rocky ifland, where veflels may be moor- 
ed to iron rings in the rocks, and ride in fafety in the greatefl 
ftorms. The profperity of this village, as well as that of the 
ifland, is much owing to its being the rendezvous of the Royal 
George revenue cutter, Captain James Crawford. The offi- 
cers and crew of this vefTel are inhabitants of the ifland. There 
is little done to the roads, excepting to that between the vil- 
lage and ferry, which has lately been repaired, and a ready 
intercourfe eflablifhed between the ifland and Largs. 

Proprietors and Rents. — The whole ifland belongs to the 
Earls of Glafgowf and Bute. The valued rent is 1087I. 8s. 2d.

* All the free-ftone, employed in creeling the much improved harbour of 
Portpatrick, was taken from this ifland. 

f About the beginning of laft century, according to the tradition of the 
ifland, there was a family of the name of Montgomerie, who then poffeffed the 
greateft part of the land now belonging to Lord Glafgow, and had a manfion 
houfe at BUlikellet. Among the laft of that family was Dame Margaret Mont- 
gomerie, joint patronefs of the kirk, who, being on horfeback at the green of the 
Largs, is faid to have been thrown off amidft a crowd of people; but, being a 
woman of high fpirit, Ihs purfucd the horfe, and received a ftroke of his foot,

Scotch ; the real rent is nearly 700I. The average rent of 
the arable land may be from 103. to 12s. per acre ; and the 
remainder of heath and pafture, from is. to 2s. per acre. 

Church, Poor, and School. — The value of the living is about 
70I., with 1 fmall glebe. The Earl of Glafgow is patron. 
The church was built in the 161 2, and is now too fmall to 
accommodate the inhabitants. The manfe was built about 
26 years ago, and is in good repair. There are few poor up- 
on the fe.Tion lift. The collections made at the church door, 
amounting to about 16I., with the intereft of a fmall fund, 
is nearly equal to their fupport. Englifh, writing, and arith- 
metic, are carefully taught, and the fchool is pretty well at- 
tended ; but the fchoolmafter's falary and perquifites are very 
trifling. 

Natural Curiojities. — There are two rocks, called Reppel 
Walls, on the E. fide of the ifland. They rife out of the ele- 
vated ground, and run along, or rather acrofs, a plain near 
the fea, in the dir,e&amp;ion of S. by E,, and N by W., diftant 
from each other 500 feet, running in parallel lines ; the one 
to the E. about 30 feet in height, 89 in length, mean thick-, 
nefs 10 feet ; that to the W. 20© feet long, 70 feet high, 
where it comes out of the hill, and 60 feet near its outer 
end; the thicknefs 12 feet. In the fame dire&amp;ion, there is 
the appearance of a foundation running into the fea. Some- 
thing fimilar to thefe are feen in the oppofite fide of the ifland:

kirk, and were lately to be feen on a part of the ruins of Billikellet. About u, 
quarter of a mile from Billikellet, there is a large (lone fet up on end. About 6 
feet of it is above the ground. It appears to have been the rude monument of 
fomc ancient hero. There is is alfo a place which the inhabitants point out, »« 
having been a Danifh camp, though no vcftiges of it now remain.

and may be eftimated as the produdion of volcanic fufion and 
eruption; a procefs of nature, which, however dreadful and 
tZendous, feems to be produce of the greateft change, 
the furface of this globe has undergone. 

CWfcr.-The people are fober, regular and induftrious, 
in a remarkable degree. It is not known, that any perfon 
born in this parilhhas ever flood trial before a criminal court. 
Confidering their opportunity of improvement, they may be 
deemed intelligent ; and it is but juftice to the feafaung part of 
the community to fay, that, for their line of life, their general 
con^a is peculiarly proper and praife-worthy.

By Alexander Simpson, A. M. Schoolmajler of the Fari/h.</head> 



<p>Name, Figure, River, Surface, and Soil. 
IT EN-EDAR was the ancient name of the parifh, which 
XV like all the old names of places in this country, is no 
doubt a word of Gaelic derivation. The parifli is of an ob- 
long irregular figure, from the northern extremity, which is 
wilhin a quarter of a mile of the town of Banff, extending ia. 
Englifh miles S.E. and varying from 2 to 5 miles in breadth. 
The Deveron runs along the W. end of it for feveral miles, 
and divides it from the parifh of Alvah ; but two detached 
parts of the latter lie on this fide the river, one of which 
meeting the parifh of Gamry, entirely disjoins the N. end of 
this parifh from the reft. The country, though flat, rather 
than hilly, is diverfified with high and low grounds, and in- 
terfered by feveral burns and rivulets. All the higher land* 
are covered with fhort heath, and except where the foil is en- 
tirely mofs, or extremely poor, retain marks of former cul- 
tivation. The foil is in general dry and gravelly, but, as 

may

snay be expeSed, in a pariflx of fuch extent, fields of a differ 
rent and oppofite nature are not uncommon. 

Heritors, Extent, Rent, Sec—The parifh is the property 
of the Earl of Fife, William Urquhart of Craigfton, Adam 

Urquhart of Byth, Gordon of Men, and John Ruffell 

and John Taylor of Balmad; all of whom, except the Earl 
of Fife and the proprietor of Iden, refide in the parifh. From 
an aftual furvey of the feveral eftates, except that of Iden, a 
computation of the meafurement of which is here included, 
the parifh is found to contain 14,000 Scotch acres, of which 
6482 are arable, 4402 moor and pafture, and 1982 mofs. On 
the property of the Earl of Fife there are 550 acres of wood r 
on that of Mr. Urquhart of Craigfton 500, and on that of 
Mr. Urquhart of Byth 84 acres, confifting of various kinds 
of foreft trees ; but chiefly Scotch fir. In low and fheltered 
fkuations, the wood is thriving and of large fize ; but in thofe 
that are elevated, and more expofed to the killing blafts from 
the N. fea, it rifes little higher than a fhrub ; however, under 
cover of thefe fhrubs, a fecond plantation makes greater pro-

Balmad enjoy only the increafe of rent which has taken place 
fince the year 1750, or thereabout, when this eftate was fold, 
by King's College ; the rent which it bore at the time of the 
fale continues to be rjaid to the faid College and the fchool of 
Fordyce.

has been anticipated, in the report for the parifh of Gamry*. 
The falmon caught above the cruives are fold at home at 2d.

Mills and Multures — The parifh is accommodated with 
1 lint mills, 2 waulk mills, and 10 for grinding corn. For 
grain carried to the mill, the rate of multure varies froni 

to iV» a nd for what is fold unmanufactured T ' T is general- 
ly exacted, which is called dry or abft rafted multure. From 
thefe mills, the heritors, who have their tenants reftricled to 
a certain mill, receive annually about 328 bolls of meal, part 
of the rent in grain before mentioned. To enable the tackf- 
men to pay this mill rent, and to defray their own labour 
and charges, the quantity of meal made annually in the pa- 
rifh, together with the grain fold unmanufactured, muft be 
from 7000 to 8000 bolls. 

Church and School. — The Rev. Mr. Robert Duff is mi- 
nifler of the parifh. The church, which is an old building", 
has been repaired, and the manfe rebuilt fince his admiffion to 
the charge. The living is 601. 10s. id. Sterling, in money ; 4 
chalders, 2 firlots, 2 pecks, of meal, and 1 chalder of bear, 
■with a glebe of 12 or 13 acres of arable and pafture land. 
The King is patron.— The fchoolmafter's falary, lately aug- 
mented, and paid by the heritors, is io!.; as feffion- clerk he 
receives 2I. 3s. 4d. Scotch, for a proclamation of marriage, and

Village. — New Byth, which is the only village in the pa- 
rifh, began to be feued in 1764, on a plan limilar to that of 
Cumineftown in Monquhitter *. It contains 195 inhabitants, 
and enjoys the advantage of a charity fchool. By feuing and 
dividing the land into fmall parcels, James Urquhart, the late 
proprietor of Byth, raifed the rent of his eftate nparly to 5 
times what it was in 1731, when he came to the manage- 
ment of it. The valuation of this eftate is only one icth, and 
the number of its inhabitants more than one 4th of the whole 
parifh.

A houfe, formerly intended as a linen manufaaory, and for 
•fome time ufed as fuch, diflant from the parifh church 10 
miles, was lad year con verted into a chapel of eafe, for theaccorr- 
modation of the people at Byth. Application was made to the 
Society for Propagating Chriftian Knowledge, for the aid of 
their bounty, who, with refervation of the right of patron- 
age, agreed to give 25I. a-year for the fupport of a clergy, 
man, upon condition that the heritor of Byth would give fe- 
curity for the fame fum, afford him a dwelling-houfe and 
cilices, with land fuff.cient to maintain a horfe and 2 cows. 
As thefe conditions are complied with, the affair will be efta- 
blilhed on fuch a footing as to afford a decent living to the 
miffionary, and be a lading advantage, not only to this pa- 
iiih, but to thofe parts of fome neighbouring parifhes, which 
are alfo diflant from their own churches. 

Agriculture, \£c — All the people, even thofe who are 
handicraftfmen and artificers, are employed in agriculture. 
According to their extent, and the quality of the land, the 
rent of farms varies from 61. to 85I., yaluing the meal at 10s. 
per boll. Improvements in agriculture have made confider- 
able progrefs for fome years part. The mode of culture, and 
rotation of crops, have undergone a great and almoff total 
alteration fince the year 1745 : Even later than that period, 
the ufe and efficacy of lime as a manure*, the advantage of 
artificial gntlTes, fallow, and green crops, were little known : 
Thefe are now fo common, that not only the principal farm- 
ers, but almoft every cottager, has a proportion of his land

in potatoes, turnips, and clover. Small black oats, which 
formerly occupied what was called the out-fiekl, have giyeri 
place to white oats ; and the diltinaion of infield and outfield 
begins to be lefs attended to. After fallow or turnips, where 
the land is dry, the following, crop is barley, with fown grafs 
for 3 or 4 years ; where the land is wet, oats are found to 
fucceed better. After breaking up, the rotation diCers ac- 
cording to the nature of the foil, and genius of the farmer. 
Moft families raife flax fuflkient for private ufe ; and fome 
have obtained premiums from the truflees the advan- 
tages of inclofures are better underftood than experienced.- 
Excepting the fields in the immediate poffeffion of fome of the 
heritors, we have few fenced with none or hedge. Stones he 
for building are not to be found above ground in any part o£ 
the parilh ; and inclofing with hedge, or {lone parried and 
carried to a diftance,- would be attended with an expence, 
greater than the rent of land and the fhortnefs of leafes can 
afford. Though fome of the heritors are difpofed to make 
compenfation at the expiration of a leafe, for building and in* 
doling ; yet the expence of both, or either of thefe, would 
fink too much of the fmall flock, with which many commence 
farmers. 

Marnier of living, Produce, Sec— Animal food is rarely art 
article in the bill of fare, but on holidays ; among the bettcr 
fort of farmers, tea is ufed once and often twice a-day ; and 
occafionally among thofe of inferior rank. Inffeead of ale, 
with which our forefathers ufed to make merry, whilky punch'

nants, are annually exported to the S. and W. of Scotland. 
When the pnce is low, bear-meal fometimes finds a market 
in Norway. The brewery of ale and porter at Banff, and 
the fmall hcenfed whifky ftills in the neighbourhood, afford a 
good market for barley: Thefelaft, befides increafing the con- 
fumption and priee of barley, and fupplyi ng us with whi(k 
of a quality greatly fuperior to what we have from the large 
ftills : n the fouthern drftri&amp;s, as well as cheaper, and no lefs 
wholefome than foreign fpirits, have given agreat check to fmug- 
gling, and, in every point view, are a reciprocal advantage to 
the farmers, and the country at large*. Extending the pa- 
flure, and rearing cattle for the grazier and drover, are at 
prefent the! principal objeas of the farmer ; for this purpofe 
turnips are more frequently applied to, than feeding for the 
butcher. A high proportion of rent in kind is fomedmes an 
obftruaion to this mode of farming, as it lays the tenant un- 
der the neceffity of keeping more land in tillage, than he can 
properly manure, which mult prevent him from having ei- 
ther fo much grafs or corn, as he might have, at lefs expence, 
if not fo refti-idted. But the converlion of fuch rent into 

money 

* In 178*, fomc farms of an eatly foil produced what was neceffary to pay 
aiafter and fervant; but the deficiency of the crop of that year, was fuch, in 
genera), as to make the importation of grain from England neceffarv. It would 
be doing injuftice to the principal proprietors of the parifh,.not to mention that 
they voluntarily fhared the calamity of that, and the following year, by fupply. 
iug the people with meal and 'grain at a 1 reduced price, accepting bear-meal in- 
ftead of oat-meal for putt of their grain rent, and a moderate converfion in mo- 
ney for what they could not afford to pay in kind. By thefc acts of humanity 
•n the part of the heritors, the difburfement of 80I. extraordinary from the 
poor's fund, and 15 bolls of meal Fent by Government, the wants of the poor 
wcrefupplied, and the unfortunate aflifted. An advance in the price of black' 
cattle, and the plentiful crop 1784, flill more effectually repaired the lof* fuf- 
tamed by the two preceding years, which would othcrwife have been more

black cattle, 447 borfes, .nd, 3 34*"P- About 400 black 
cattle can be fpared annually; moft of them being fold young, 
at or under 3 years old, the average price may be eftimated 
at 3 1 15s. The number of ploughs is 135, of which 15 are 
d.awn by oxen, 76 by a horfes, and 4 4 by 4 borfcs, each 
of carts 326, of which 3 drawn by oxen, 76 by z horfes 
in a line, and *47 by a fingle horfe each. By a ftronger 
breed of horfes, and an improved conftruftion of ploughs and 
carts, the operations of hufbandry are greatly facilitated, and 
the increafing price of labour in fome meafure counterbalan- 
ced. A fingle man, with a pair of horfes, will do more work 
in the fame time, than was performed by 2 men and 4 borfes, 
4 o years ago. The hire of a man qualified to work a pair of 
horfes is from 61. to 81. ;— of a woman farm-feivant, from 
21. 10s. to 3I. per annum ;— of a man engaged for harvefl il. 
10s. ;— of a woman for ditto, il. is., with maintainance. The

proper management, might have been of lafthig benciit to the country.

W that many hundred, died in a fevere feafon ; and thofe 
that furvived were of f ma ll fi ze and value. When fo little 
attention was paid to them, the profits of a flock muir have 
been fmall and uncertain, which, with the espence of winter 
herding, when turnips and fown grafs were introduced, may 
be affigned as the principal caufes, why their number is fo 
greatly diminimed. Where they ftill retain their ground, 
the breed is improved both as to fize and quality of wool 
The articles which bring in money, are grain, cattle, butter, 
eheefe, and linen yarn. Of thefe, cattle, in the opinion of the 
moil judicious farmers, is the fiaple commodity. 

Roads and Fuel.— The public roads are made and repaired 
by the ftatute labour, which the people perform with reluc- 
tance, and often in a fuperficial manner. The poft road from 
Banff to Turriff is well fupplied with bridges, and has of late 
been much improved ; but on this, as well as on many pri- 
vate roads, much remains to be done. It is the general opU 
nion, that affeffments in money, or the introduclion of turn- 
pikes, are the only effectual way of making and keeping the 
roads in good repair, as the experience of many years Iheu s 

the ftatute labour to be inadequate to that purpofe Peats, 

turf, and broom, are ufed for fuel. Wet feafons, of which 
we have had many of late, togetlier with the great expence 
of preparing and bringing home peats, induced many to burn 
Englifh coal, even before the late reduc tion of duty on that 
neeeffary of life took place.

Propofed Improvements. -To give greater encouragement 
to the induftrious, and make improvements m agriculture 
more permanent and extenfive, nothing is more requifite m 
this place than longer leafes. The ufual period of leafes docs 
not exceed 19 years ; though, it muft be owned, there are 
exceptions on Craigfton's and the Earl of Fife's eftates.-The 
converfion of multures, and particularly of abftrafted mul- 
tures, might likewife promote this end, and would certainly 
free the future generation from an accumulating tax on im- 
provement. As what is here fuggefted is at prefent in agita- 
tion, and has already, in fome inftances, taken place, this 
grievance will be foon remedied, and the people enjoy the 
fame privilege in manufafturing their grain, which they have 
in making their carts and ploughs, of employing thofe who 
ferve them beft.

NUMBER XXXII. 
PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1009846">CRIMOND</name>. 

(County and Synod of Aberdeen Prefbytery of Deer.') 

By Mr. William Gall, Afliflant to the Rev. Mr. James 
Johnston Minijler of the Parijh.</head> 



<p>Situation, Extent, Surface, and Rivulets, &amp;.c. 

THE parifh of Crimond is fituated in that diftrift of 
Aberdeenfhire, called Buchan, and lies nearly in a line 
between the fea port towns of Peterhead and Fraferfburgh ; 
being about miles diftant from the former, and 7-j from 
the latter ; and bounded on the N. E. by the German Ocean. 
The figure of the parifh, including the Loch of Strathbeg, 
(part of which is in the parifh of Loanmay), is triangular. 
The bafe of the triangle, adjacent to the German Ocean, is 
nearly 3 miles, and its height is about 5^ miles. It contains 
about 4600 acres, of which nearly 3000 are arable. The re- 
mainder is occupied by mofles, links, fands, a common, and 
the lake of Strathbeg. About a quarter of a mile from high 
water mark, there is a fteep hill along the fhore, almoft per- 
pendicular, and nearly 200 feet in height. From the fummit 
of this hill there is a gradual defcent for about a mile, till the 

VoL ' Xt 3 F ground

4*° Slat'ifiical Account 



ground be but a little higher than the level of the fea ; after 
"which there is a gradual afcent, with a few variations, to the 
upper part of the parifh. As the parifh lies very flat, there 
are few fprings of foft water j and, in dry fummers, many 
have confiderable difficulty, and muft go to a great diftance to 
procure water for themfelves and their cattle. There are a few 
ltreams of foft water in the parifh, arifing from moffes ; but 
they contain very little water in fummer. The moft confi- 
derable of thefe breams, or burns, divides the parifh of Cri- 
niond from Loanmay, and falls into the Loch of Strathbeg ; 
but its whole courfe, with all its turnings, will not exceed 4 
miles. Yet, though there is rather a fcarcity of foft water, 
there are many mineral fprings ; moft of them are fuppofed 
to be much impregnated with iron. None of them, however, 
have been much ufed for any medicinal purpofe. 

Heritors and Rent. — The parifh is divided among 4. heri- 
tors: Mr. Irvine of Drum, proprietor of the lands of Crimond 
and Millhill; Mr.Harvey of Broadland, proprietor of the land 5 
of -Rattray and Broadland ; Mr. Duff of Fetereflo, proprie- 
tor of Logie; and Mr. Annand of Haddo, proprietor of Had- 
do ; befides 2, who poffefs only a few acres each. Of thele, 
Mr. Harvey of Broadland generally refides. The valued rent 
of the parifh is 2172I. 13s. 4 d. Scotch ; the real rent islibove 
13C0I. Sterling. The value of the land here has rifen very 
confiderably during the laft 50 or 60 years. 

ManufaBures and Commerce.— Yxom the fcarcity of water in 
the parim; there can be no manufactures eftablifhed here. The 
^omen, however, are employed partly in fpinmng flax, for 
the manufacturers of Aberdeen and Peterhead j partly in 
fpinning tow, which is manufactured into a coarfe kind of 
harrow cloth, called ham, which labouring people ufe for 

{huts, 



of Crimond. 41 1 

ftirts, and which fells, unbleached, at about 6d. cr per 
yard ;' or into a ftill coarfer kind, which is made into bags 
for carrying grain, and which, being much clofer woven, 
fells at about 8d. or lod. per yard. A confiderable quantity 
of this cloth is fold yearly at different fairs in this neighbour- 
hood ; and a ftill greater proportion of linen yarn is fpun, 
and Cent by land carriage, chiefly to Aberdeen, a diftance of 
35 miles. The women will gain, by fpinning, from 46!. to 6d, 
a day. 

Fi/b, Kelp,, &amp;c The coaft abounds in fifli, particularly cod, 

which are of an excellent kind (Rattray cod being very famous); 
but for want of a proper landing place, they are not caught 
in very great quantities here. There is no fifhing town in the 
parifh ; but fome of the crofters and artificers, on the eftates of 
Broadland and Haddo, fifh in good weather, when they are not 
•otberwife employed. Mr. Harvey of Broadland propofes to 
make a proper landing place, but has not yet begun to put 
his plan in execution. Sea weed, or ware, is ufed as a ma- 
nure ; and a fmall quantity of kelp is manufactured here. 
Rattray Head, in this parifh, is a very dangerous rock, k 
is very low, and ftretches a good way into the fea. A great 
number of veffels have been fhipwrecked there. In thefe 
cafes, the conduct of to omany of the lower ranks, in this and 
the neighbouring parifhes, efpecially of thofe who are moft 
adjacent to Rattray Head, can by no means be juftilied ; for 
they pilfer and carry off from the wreck whatever they can. 
lay hold on, fometimes in a very bareface4 manner. The 
ere&amp;ion of a light-houfe at Kinnaird's Head, about 7 miles 
W. from Rattray Head, will probably render thefe wrecks 
lefs frequent at the latter. The lafl fhip wrecked there was 
{he Delight of Turlington, a large veffel, laden with iron, 
wood and tallow, m November or December 1790.

cww«_ The cWte i8health andfeemsnot 

fo hable to infe&amp;ous diforders, as other parifties in the neigh- 
bourhood. The putrid fore throat raged with great violence 
* or 3 years ago, in mod parifhes in the neighbourhood, and 
carried off great numbers ; but though a few werefeized with it 
m Crimond, none died of that diforder. Confumptive diforders 
are moft frequent here. At prefent an infectious fever pr^ 
vails, which has proved fatal to feveral. In fpring 1792 2o 
people, from 1 to 16 years of age, were inoculated for the 
fmall pox. One of them did not catch the infection j the 
other 19 had them in the moft favourable manner. But' not- 
withftanding this fuccefs, the example is not likely to be 
followed. 

The land next the fliore is a very light fandy foil, which 
produces, in general, weighty crops of bear, peafe and beans. 
It is eafily cultivated, and would produce excellent crops of 
early grafs ; but this hufbandry has been feldom attempted in 
that part of the parifh. In the N. W. part of the parifh, for 
2 or 3 miles from the fea, is a light loam, earlier than moft 
other parts ; and fome of it produces weighty crops. Part is 
on a clay bottom ; much of it is a cold damp late foil, particu- 
larly near the moffes j and as a great part of the parifh ap- 
pears once to have been covered with mofs, this foil is to be 
found in many places. The only grain produced here is oats, 
bear, peafe and beans ; the two laft in not very great quan- 
tities* 



Agriculture and Produce — It is but lately that any consi- 
derable improvements in agriculture were made here. It is 
indeed nearly 60 years fince Mr. Irvine of Crimond began to 
ufe lime.. But fo little was the nature of that manure known 
at that time, that he took 7, 8, and even 11 fucceflive crops 

after 

1 



of Crimond. 413 

after liming. Some fields have not yet recovered the bad ef- 
fects of this over-cropping. When the tenants, about 30 or 
40 years ago, began to ufe lime, the landlords, in order to 
prevent over cropping, caufed infert a claufe in the leafes they 
granted, prohibiting tenants from taking more than 4 crops 
after folding with fheep or cattle, and 5 after liming, without 
the intervention of a green crop ; but if the 5 th crop after 
liming was peafe, they could, by their leafe, make the 6th 
bear, and then a 7th and 8th oats. It is eafy to fee, that fuch 
a mode of ufing ground, muft have greatly retarded improve- 
ment. Liming is not much ufed at prefent here, as moll of 
the ground, for which it is proper, has already been limed, 
and got fuch a large dofe, that a fecond liming is rather hurt- 
ful than beneficial. What lime is now ufed, is commonly har- 
rowed in with bear, and clover and rye-grafs feeds, after tur- 
nips and potatoes, in old infield ground. Shell marl is begin- 
ning to be ufed as a manure, and feems to anfwer well. 

It is not much above 20 years fince potatoes, turnips, or 
artificial graffes, were to be feen in the fields in any quantity. 
But people now begin to perceive the advantages of thofe im- 
provements. Potatoes are planted in quantities fufficient to 
fupply the confumption of the pariih, which is confiderable. 
A few were fold laft year for exportation ; but the expence 
of land carriage will probably prevent any attempts to raife 
them for exportation. Many have large fields of turnips. 
Summer fallow is fometimes ufed ; and the potatoe, turnip, 
and fallow fields are generally fown down with rye-grafs, and 
red and white clover feeds ; and fometimes grafs feeds are 
fown in ground not fo well prepared. But a great deal re- 
mains to be done and it will be a long time before the dif- 
trict can arrive at the degree of cultivation it is capable of. 
There is no regular rotation of crops carried on here, unlefs 
by one or two tenants. A very good rotation, which has been

Nearly the half of the arable ground in he parifh is in na- 
tural or artificial graffes. About a 5 th part of the remainder 
is in potatoes, turnips, peafe, or other green crop. Every 
tenant, for the moft part, has a greater or leffer quantity of 
flax, chiefly for family ufe. What remains, i s in oats and bar- 
ley. The turnips are ufed, partly in feeding cattle for the 
butcher, but chiefly in rearing young cattle. The parifli will 
produce nearly, on an average, 6ooo bolls of grain annually ; 
of which from iooo to 2000 are exported; the remainder is 
needed for feed, and the fupply of the inhabitants. The va- 
lue of cattle fold yearly, including a few fheep, amounts to 
more than the grain exported. Very fine cattle are reared 
and fed here. The number of black cattle is rather above 
800. There are but few Iheep. About 20 years ago, horfes 
ufed to be brought from other places, to fupply the farmers in 
this and the neighbouring parimes ; but now good horfes are 
reared and exported. The number of horfes in the diftrid is 
exactly 205. Some farmers alfo difpofe of a little hay. 

Some time ago, in this diftricl:, the plough was drawn by 
6 horfes, or 10 or 12 oxen ; now 4 horfes, or 4 oxen, anc} 
fometimes 2 horfes, are ufed. The Scotch plough is general- 
ly employed. There is fcarcely any of the parifh inclofed, 
which is partly compenfated by the pra&amp;ice of winter herding. 
About 16 or 20 years ago, many of the tenants began to in- 
clofe with earthen fences ; and perhaps a third part of the pa- 
rifh was inclofed in that manner. But as thefe fences foon 
mouldered away, and became infuflicient, a flop was put to 
that manner of inclofing, and the earthen fences were gene-

tally thrown down. In fome parts of the diftrid, Hones are 
not to be got in fufficient quantities for inclofmg ; and, even 
where they can be got, a tenant can hardly be expected to «- 
clofe on a leafe of 19 years, the longeft generally granted 
here. 

The fliortnefs of leafes ufually given, feems to prefent an 
infuperable bar to perfedion in agriculture. From the de- 
creafing value of money, the landlord imagines he mutt be 
a lofer by granting a long leafe. But might not a leafe be 
granted for 3, 4, or 5 nineteen years, without any material in- 
jury to the landlord, arifing from the progreffive decreafe of the 
value of money ? For inftance, might not the rent of a farm be 
regulated by the price of oatmeal, or of any kind of grain ? 
Suppofe a farm to be let for aol., and the price of oatmeal, 
at the beginning of the leafe, to be 10s. per boll, then the 
rent, or 20I., would be equivalent to 40 bolls of oatmeal. 
Suppofe, at the end of the firft 19 years, the price of oatmeal, 
on an average cf 7 years, to be 12s. per boll, then let the 
rent for the feennd 19 years be the price of 40 bolls of meal, 
at 12s. per boll, or 24I. Suppofe, at the end of the fecond 
19 years, oatmeal to be 14s per boll, then let the rent, for the 
third 19 years, be the price of 40 bolls of meal, at 14s. pec 
boll, or 28I. The rifing rent might in the fame manner be 
regulated by the price of cattle or fheep of a certain weight, 
or of beef or wool, or other productions of the farm. A 
moderate advance might likewife be made for the capability 
of improvement. A long leafe might l'urely be granted, upon 
this or a fimilar plan, without materially injuring the land- 
lord ; while the tenant would be encouraged to attempt fub- 
ftantial improvements, as he would have a certain profpect of 
reaping the fruits of his induftry.

* About the time that the return was made to Dr. Webfter, and for fome time 
after, the population was faid to be on the increafc, owing chiefly to the divid- 
ing of large farms into fmaljer ones. But fince the year i 77 o, the population 
feems to have been upon the decreafe. In i 77 z, it appears, from the lift kept 
by the overfeer of the roads, that there were 23* men in the parifh, from 16 to 
60, liable to work on the highways. Thefe have gradually decrcafed fince. In 
i 7 8l, there were but 200 ; and laft year only i 7 i. 

t In February i 793 , there was a decreafe of 15, owing to the removal of 
1 families and 5 or 6 artizans out of the pariih.— It is impoffible to give any 
account of the births, deaths, and marriages. Scarcely any of the diffenters in- 
fert their childrens births in the regifter ; and even fome of the Eftablifhed 
Church are equally negligent. 1 Before i 7 8 3 , no regifter of burials and marri- 
ages was kept, and fcarcely the half have been regiftered fince that period 
The decreafe of the population may, among other caufes, contribute to the high 
jrice of labour, and to what is of worfe confequence, the difficulty of procuring 
labourers. At the time that the large farms were divided into fmaller ones, the 
fubtenants and cottagers rented partly the fmaller farms, and partly crofts, from 
the heritor, which were generally too large. When the poffeffors of thefe fmall 
farms and crofts were found not to be the beft improvers of the ground, the 
landlords began to put two or more of the fmall farms into one, fo that now 
there are fcarcely any fubtenants, and few crofts let by the heritors. As there 
are no villages in the parifh, and no cottages to be let, but fuch as have a piece 
of ground annexed to them, young people, for want of a fettlement, remove to the 
manufacturing towns of Peterhead and Aberdeen ; fo that day-labourers and 
handicraft people : re procured with thegreateft difficulty. It would probably be 
of great advantage both to therjnfelves ami the public, if the heritor* would allot

Church *, School, Poor, %£c. — The ftipend is a chalder of 
bear, a chalder of meal, 700 rrietks Scotch in money, with 
^50 merks for communion elements, and a glebe of about 5 
acres of very good ground. The Earl of Enrol is the prefent 
patron. The church was built in 1 576 ; at lead this date is 
above one of the doors. It is probable, however, that it had 
only been repaired that year, as there is ftill a font flone in 
the E. end. The manfe was built in 1763,- and new offices 
about 4 or 5 years ago. — A new fchool-houfe, with rooms for 
the mafter, was built in J 791. The .fchoolmafier's falary is 
100 merks Scotch, and, including all perquifites and fchool fees., 
Vv'ill not amount to above ill. or 1.2I. a year. — The poor are 
fupported by the weekly coll e&amp;ions, and the iiftereft of 1301. 
Sterling. Of this, too merks Scotch were mortified by a pro- 
prietor of Logie, about the beginning of the century, and -50 
merks by Mr. Leflie, late minifter of Crimond, about the 
year 1740. Thefe two fums, by being lent out at interefr, 
amounted, in 1748, to 7.00 merks Scotch ; and, in 1782, with 
fome fmall favings, to 170I. Sterling: A practical proof of

or 3 acres to day-labourers and artificers, and to grant them leafcs. By thefe 
means many would fettle in the country, the bell nurfery of the human fpecics, 
and it would always he cafy to procure labourers and artificers, which is fre- 
quently not the cafe at prefent. This difficulty of procuring day-labourer* la- 
bouring fervar.ts, &amp;c. prevents many improvements from being attempted. It 
wouid alfo be of confsquence, that fitch crofts were very fmall, becaufe if they 
were large, they would either take up too much of the poffeffor's time, or the 
neceffury attention would not be paid to them. 

* Mr. William Law, probably the firft Prefbyterian minifter at Crimond 
after the Revolution,, was depofed, foon after the beginning of the century, by 
the Synod of Aberdeen, for what they were pleafed to call bcrefy, he having ai- 
ferted in a Synod fermon, « That virtue was mm natural 'to the human mind

W'.-The r ° ads in this dIftri «a are repaired by the ila- 
tute labour, which, if properIy performed, would have kept 
them m repair : But the work was always too fuperficially 
performed, becaufe too much was attempted in one year. 
And, as the roads flood as much in need of repair as ever, 
in a few years they became very bad. This rendered people 
averfe and aukward in performing the ftatute labour. Be- 
fides, about 10, 12, or 20 years ago, the then refiding heri- 
tors frequently repaired their private roads by means of the 
ftatute labour; and overfeers were often partial or negli- 
gent. More attention, however, has been paid to the public 
roads for fome years paft, and they are now confiderably im- 
proved. 

Lake, Hill, &amp;c— The Loch of Strathbeg is partly in the pa- 
rim of Crimond, partly in that of Loanmay. It contains about 
550 acres, and is above a mile in length from E. to W.; the 
breadth is unequal, The E. end, which is in Crimond, is 
nearly half a mile from the fea, the W. end fomewhat far*

worfiiip. A great many are diffenters, who contribute little or nothing to the 
fupport of the poor. For 10 or 12 years part, Mr. Irvine of Drum has caufed 
5 or 6 bolls of oat-meal, and fometimes more, yearly, and, at different times 
money, to be diftributed among the ] oor of his cftate : An example which de- 
ferves to be followed by all non-refiding heritors, and thofe who do not attend 
public worfiiip. 

* At the beginning of the prefent century, this lake was of much fmaller ex- 
tent than it is now. It was confined to a frnall part of the E. end, and had a 
communication with the fea, fo that yeffels of fmall burthen could enter it. 
People born about the beginning of the century well remembered the firft over- 
flowing of the W. part of the Loch, though the particular year is not now 
kriown, but it muft have been about 1720. Previous to that time there was a 

hill 



of Crhnond.

pleafant fituatlon, there 5s a fmall hill, of a circular form, 
whofe top is exaftly half a Scotch acre in extent, called the 
CaJlle-HM. It rifes 38 feet above a fmall plain on the N. E. 
but is only 12 or 14 feet above the higher ground on the oppo- 
fite fide. The famous Gummine Earl of Buchan, had a feat 
here ; but after his defeat at the battle, of Inverury, by King 
Robert Bruce, this caftle fell into ruins. By the blowing of 
the light fandy ground in the neighbourhood, which very 
frequently happens, it is now covered with a deep foil, and 
produces crops of grain and grafs* Such is the inftability of 
human affairs *. About a quarter of a mile S. of the Caftle- 
hill, the walls of a chapel, furrounded by a burial place, are 1 
moftly entire f. Around this chapel formerly flood the 
burgh of Rattray. It is faid to have had the fame privileges

hill of fand, between the hill above mentioned and the fea, and ftill higher than 
it. A furious E. wind blew away this hill of fand in one night, which flopped 
the communication between the loch and the fea by forming a fand bar. The 
low lying ground to the W» was fodn overflowed, and the extent of the loch much 
increafed. An attempt has been made to drain this loch : the operations for 
draining it were begun in 1787, and are ftill continued, though hitherto unfuc- 
cefsful. The proper method of draining it does not appear to be yet difcovered, 

* About 60 years ago, Mr. Arbuthnot, then of Broadland, caufed dig up an 
eminence at the S. E. fide of the Caftle-hill, where he found a great number of 
ftones, fuppofed to belong to the kitchen of the caftle, as the workmen found 
very large hearth-ftones covered with afhes. 

f It is fuppofed to have been a private chapel for the ufe of the Earl's 
family. The length is 45 feet within the walls, the breadth 18 feet, the thicknefj 
of the walls 3 feet, and the height of the end walls, ftill above ground, 32 feet. 
In the E. end of the chapel are 3 arched windows; the largeft, which is in the 
middle, is n feet high and 2 feet wide. The other 2 are each 7 feet high, and 
2 wide. The walls are built of very fmall ftonei firmly cemented with lime.

There are, however, very few trees in it at prefent ;. but it

mond in the laft century, there are feveral very extenfive 
moffes contiguous to each other, which, if we may judge 
from thcfe already exhaufted,. have been once covered with 
wood *.

Balgardno of Blackwater, and David Rivis of Strathftedlie, bailies of the burgh 
of Rattray, a jury of 13 honed men, citizens of the faid burgh, find, that 
Magnus Smith, the father of William Smith, died pofiefied of 4 roods of land 
in the faid burgh. Upon this, David Rivis, one of the faid bailies, fuperior of 
the lands of Rattray, giants a charter on the faid 4 roods in favour of William 
Smith —The next charter is granted in 1075 by William Watfon of Haddo, 
bailie of the burgh of Rattray,- fuperior of the faid lands, in favour of Ifobel

<p>Name, Situation, and Extent. 

THE general name of this parifh, like thofe of moft of 
the farms of which it confifts, feems to be Danifti. It 
is fituated on the N. W. coaft of Scotland. The figure of 
the inhabited part approaches neareft to a quadrangular pen- 
infula, being inclofed by the fea on 3 of the fides. The 
Kyle, or narrow fea, which feparates the adjacent ifiand of 
Sky from the main land of Scotland, is its weftern boundary; 
the bays of Lochduich and Lochlong encompafs it on the S. ; 
and that range of high hills, which divides the eaft from the 
weft coaft of Scotland, bound it on the eaft. The inhabited 
part i$ computed to be 10 miles long, and j broad.

Surface, Soil, and Climate, Vc.-The general appearance 
of the country, like that of all Highland parifhes, xs moun- 
tainous. The hills are neither rocky, nor ^ covered W1 th 
heath, as in the neighbouring countries to the N. On the 
declivity of the fmaller hills, and in the intermediate hollows, 
the foil is rich, and commonly of the fame quality with the 
ground which covers lime-ftone rocks. On the top they are 
covered with thin mofs. The whole produces excellent pa- 
fture, reckoned fuperior in quality to any in the neighbour- 
ing countries. The climate, as may be expeded, from the 
attraflion of the clouds by the high hills in the panfh, and 
the ftill higher hills of Kintail and Sky, is exceedingly moift 
5ind rainy. The inhabitants, however, are healthy, and many 
live to a confiderable age. Nervous fevers are the principal 
epidemical diftempers to which they are fubjecT:. 

Produce.— The produce of the country is oats, barley, po- 
tatoes and peafe. But the attention of the farmer being 
principally occupied in rearing cattle, the railing of corn be- 
comes a fecondary confideration. The inequality of the fm 
face renders cultivation difficult, and the wetnefs of the climate 
makes the return precarious. In the beft feafons it does not 
produce corn fufficient for the inhabitants. They annually 
import oat-meal from Ireland, the Frith of Clyde, or Caith* 
nefs, at from 15s. to 24s. per boll, of 8 ftone Dutch weight. 
The quantity varies, according to the goodnefs of the harveft, 
or the feverity of the fpring. In a bad fpring, the cattle often 
confume their corn after the provender has been exhaufted. 

Cattle.— The number of cattle in the parifb, according to 
a very accurate furvey lately taken, is as follows : 



Milk

5 6 7 Lambs,

994 Sheep, - 1} 8 9

The fheep and goats are kept folely for family ufe .By 
the produce of the black cattle, the farmer lives and pays his 
rent to the landlord. About 400 are annually fold to drovers 
from the fouth of Scotland, who come to purchafe them, from 
April to November. The average price will be about three 
guineas. 

Commerce and Cultivation, — A conflderable quantify of but- 
ter and cheefe is annually exported. The butter is efteemed 
of the beft quality and higheft flavour. Formerly, the farmer 
trailed for winter provender folely to pafture grafs, on which 
no cattle were paftured from the 12th of Auguft to the 12th of 
November. Having little ftraw, and no hay, many cattle, 
in ferere winters, perifhed for want. They now begin to ml 
clofe their ground, and grow natural and artificial hay, by 
which means this lofs is in a great meafure obviated. By 
raffing more hay, and keeping a lighter ftock, cattle of greater 
value, fecure from bad feafons, might be reared. A very ex- 
tenfive bank of coral and flieU land, to which all the tenants 
Git the eftate have free accefs, will greatly contribute to pro- 
mote .agriculture amongft them. Of late years it has been 
generally ufed j and experience fo much convinces them of its 
utility, that it is now carried in fmall boats, bearing from 12 
to 18 barrels, through Lochduich, 15 miles, and fometimes to 
a considerable diftance afterwards by land carriage. Thpfe 
who carry it by contract, demand 6d. per barrel for delivering 
it on the iuore. By employing large flat-bottomed boats, the 
fuice of carriage might be much reduced, and the manure,

found fo much adapted for corn and grafs, more univerfally 
ufed.

As there was a confideraWe emigration from this country 
to North America, in 1770, and a large drain of young men 
to recruit the army during the late war*, it is difficult to af- 
fign adequate caufes for this rapid increafe of population. 
It cannot be accounted for, from any change in the divifion o£ 
farms, moft of which have been bounded by the fame marches 
for upwards of a century, and ft ill poffeffed by what may be 
called the Aborigines of the country, often defcending, from 
father to fon, in the fame family, to the fourth generation^ 
The cultivation of potatoes, introduced here about 45 years 
ago, (which, with various kinds of fifti, now conftitute the 
greateft part of the food of the people,) feems to have princi- 
pally contributed to it. Their mode of farming, requiring 
little of their attention, during the fummer and beginning of 
harveft, they are much employed in fifhing of fythe, (a fmall 
fpecies of the cole fifh), herrings, and fometimes ling, cod and

feate. The fythc are eat frefh ; the herrings are pickled, to- 
be eat with the potatoes during the harveft, winter, and 
ipnng. Though 63 boats be employed in this manner, there 
are no fift exported from the pariih. Communicating the fmall- 
pox by inoculation, now become univerfal over this coaft, and 
practifed with fuccefs, has alfo very much contributed to pre- 
ierve the lives of the people f . The emancipation of the 
lower dalles, too, from the remains of feudal oppreffion, and 
their circumftances greatly improving, under the foftering 
care of a liberal landlord, enables them to marry earlier m 
life, and to provide with more eafe for a rifing family. 

Church, Poor, Schools, &amp;c— The church was built in 1641. 
Jt was repaired and flatcd in 1766, and lately furniihed with 
commodious feats. The living, including the glebe, is worth - 
65I. per annum. The patronage is vefted in the Crown. The 
fole heritor, Mr. M'Kenzie of Seaforth, does not refide in 
the pariih. All the people come to the Eftabliihed Church,, 
excepting 62 Roman Catholics, who attend a Popifli meeting- 
houfe in the neighbouring pariih of Kintail.— The number of 
poor at prefent on the parifh roll is 35. The only fund for 
their fupport, arifing from collections at the church door, does 
not exceed 7I. per annum, Which Is diftributed by the kirk- 
feffion according to their neceflities. The parochial fchool is 
fituated near : the church. The falary is 200 merks Scotch. 
Laft year, the Society for Propagating Chriftian Knowledge 
reflorcd one of their fchools to a detached diuria of the pa- 
riih, with a falary of 1.5I. Sterling.

quitous tax on that neceffary article*.-The Gaelic is the only

ple ; though, from the introduction of Society fchools, and a 
ftronger defire in the people to have their children educated, 
molt of them are now taught to read and write. 

Wild Animals. — Red deer, mountain hares, and tarmagan, 
frequent the higher hills. In the lower, may be found roes, 
foxes, black-cocks, groufe, plovers, partridges, eagles, and a 
variety of hawks. The migratory birds are the wood-cock,

fnow-flakc. The fea coafl abounds with a variety of water 
fowl. 

Advantages and Llfadvantages — The parifh. derives its 
principal advantage from its local fituation on the fea coaft, fa 
contiguous to the bays of Lochduich, Lochcarron, Kifhorn, 
and Lochorn, fome one of which,, and generally all of them, 
ftioals of herrings never fail to vifit between the end of June, 
and the beginning of November. From benefiting by this 
advantage, they are, however, in a great meafure, prevented,

bjtheprefent exifting laws regarding/,/,. If this obflacle 
were removed, by allowing the country people fait at the fame 
duty as the fife curers have it, for curing fifo for home con- 
fumption, their condition would be greatly improved. They 
would then not only have it in their power, to cure a fuffi- 
cient quantity for the ufe of their families, at a fmaller ex- 
pence, butlikewife find profitable employment in curing her- 
rings for the Irifh markets. It is now not at all uncom- 
mon to fee them, after catching a quantity of fifli, in propor- 
tion to their fmall flock of fait, return from a lake where 
boat loads might be taken. The country people, from the 
fame caufe, not two years ago, fold good herrings in Loch- 
duich to the mailers of bufies, at from is. to zs. per bar- 
rel. The people being, from their infancy, principally em- 
ployed in attending cattle, are generally difpofed to be idle, 
and, though able-bodied, continue at hard work with re- 
luctance. The women particularly, ignorant of the arts of 
domellic induflry, contribute little to the fupport of their fa- 
milies. Habits of indullry, however, begin to be acquired. 
The introduftion of fome fpecies of manufacture would great- 
ly meliorate their condition, without interfering much with 
their principal employment of herding. The manufacture of 
coarfe ftockings feems to be the beft adapted for the local fi- 
tuation of the country. There is a great quantity of wool 
raifed on fheep farms in the neighbourhood, which might be 
fpun during the winter, a feafon generally fpcnt in idlenefs, 
and knitted while they fit in the meadows tending their herds. 
If the population continues to increafe, in the fame proportion 
ssit has done for the lafl 40 years, unlefs fome employment be 
found for the people, the country will foon be unable to fup- 
port them, and they will be reluctantly compelled to feek, in

nacy, the more refined inhabitants of the South will yield to

Drawn up from the Communications of the late Rev. Mr. JoHlf 
-Dun, Minifler of that Pari/h *.</head> 



<p>Name, and Extent. 

AUCHINLECK is a Celtic compound, fignifying th\ 
Field of Rock, an appellation indicative of its fitua- 
tion, the houfes at the extremities being founded on rock, and 
rocks appearing in moft places in the parifh, chiefly of the 
fpecies called Free-ftone. The length of this diftri£t. is about 
18, and the breadth, on an average, 2 Englifh miles. 

Soil and Produce. — Except upon the rocks, and the banks of 
the ftreams, which are warm rich land, the foil is a lhallow,

poor clay, upon a cold till bottom, Glenmore, in the upper 
part of the parifh, extending 8 miles in length, is covered 
with heath. The clay foil prevents the praftice of turnip 
crops, and winter feeding for cattle ; and has occafioned fe~ 
veral arable farms to be let for grazing. No wheat is now 
fown, except by the Earl of Dumfries ; oats, big, or bear, 
barley, clover, and rye-grafs, are much cultivated, but peafe 
do not thrive well. Lime is ufed as a manure on all the 
farms. 

Climate, Mineral Waters, Fiji), i£c— The ridges of hills to 
the N. and S. of this pariih, attracting the clouds coming 
from the Atlantic, prevent fo much rain falling here as in 
other neighbouring parifties. There are two mineral wells, 
the one a chalybeate, and the other of a purgative quality. 
Salmon come up the waters of Ayr and Lugar. Trouts, 
which formerly ufed to abound in the Lugar, are now become 
fcarce, owing to their being caught with nets, and faked like 
herrings. Pike come into the Lugar from New Cumnock 
Lochs. 

Minerals. — On the eftare of Auchinleck, there is an excel- 
lent coal, wrought from time immemorial. For 13 or 14 
miles above the church, coal is to be found almoft every 
where, and is wrought wherever any demand prevails. Above 
the coal, on the rocky banks of the Lugar, there is a beautiful 
bluifh free ftone, fine in the grain, which cuts well ; and at 
Bell's Park, there is a lead mine, which has never been 
wrought, and is faid by a fkilful perfon to look rather like a 
filver mine. On the lands of Wall ace- town there is a quarry 
of black fire-proof ftone, carried far and near for building 
ovens.

Antiquities and Remarkable Places, 6r.-_In an angle, form- 
ed by the Lugar and the Dupol burn, there are the remains 
of the old Caftle of Auchinleck, of whofe age there is not the 
fmalleft account to be found. Near this caftle there are three 
remarkably flraight and tall fir trees, planted in the laft cen- 
tury by one of the Bofwells of Auchinleck, who brought the 
plants in his boot from Dalziel near Hamilton. Next the 
caftle, lies the Place of Auchinleck, in a romantically plea- 
fant fituation ; and about half a mile from thence, the Houfe 
of Auchinleck, built by the late worthy Lord Auchinleck. 
Ayr's Mofs, in this parifti, is famous for a defeat of a party of 
the Covenanters in Charles IPs time. On a green know 
therein, is a tomb-ftone to the memory of Mr. Richard Came- 
ron, preacher of the gofpel, and feven others, killed in the 
engagement. At the head of this mofs, which extends 5 
miles in length, and 1 in breadth, there are the remains of 
an iron forge, erected at a great expence by a Lord Cathcart, 
but fuddenly given up, even when bar iron was manufactured 
there.

his reign over the Pifts, A C. 436, and reigned 25 years. He

Form, Extent, Surface, and Climate. This parifh is of 

an irregular figure. It extends from E. to W. 4 miles, and 
from N. to S., in fome places, about 5. The furface i3 un- 
even ; a confiderable part of it is hilly, and forms a part of 
that ridge of hills, called the Ochills. The low ground, 
bounded by the rivers Tay and Earn on the N. and the 
hills on the S. are nearly an oblong fquare ; in length from 
E. to W. about 4 Englifh miles, and in breadth from N. to 
S. about ii. There is a bank of a gentle rife, that runs dia- 
gonally through this fquare. It begins in a point on the Tay 
-at the north-eaflern extremity of the parifh, and extends nearly 
in a line to the foot of the hills, not fat from the weftern ex- 
tremity. All below this bank, to the banks of the Tay and 
the Earn, which may be about two thirds of the low ground, 
is flat, and the foil artificial. As the air is falubrious, there 
is no difeafe peculiar to this parifh. The prejudices againft 
inoculation are wearing off. No part of the country can af- 
ford better diverfion to the fportfman for hares, partridges, 
foxes, &amp;c. 

Soil. About 25 feet below the furface of this flat ground, 

and 4 feet below the higheft fpring tide mark in the rivers 
Tay and Earn, there is uniformly a ftratum of mofs, from 1 
to 3 feet thick. This mofs is a compofition of the wood and 
leaves of fome trees, fuch as oak, aller, hazle, birch, &amp;c 
The foil above this bed of mofs is compofed of ftrata of clay 
and fand, of different thicknefs, and of different colours and 
qualities. The fand for the moft part is very fmall, and in 
colour brown and white ; the clay orange and blue; and in 
fome places the one, and in other places the other is at the 
furface. The foil of this flat then, upon that account, is van- 
ous. The fand, indeed, even in the compofition of the foil, 
and ils extent upon the furface, bears but a fmall proportion

fpring tides, which overflow thefe haughs, carry back, and 
leave on their furface, the fineft particles of the clay warned 
down by the river. This clay mixing with the rufhes, and 
rich grafts that grow and rot on thefe haughs, has formed a 
foil of amazing fertility. Some of thefe haughs are now fe- 
cured from being overflowed by embankments. The foil of 
the bank, that runs diagonally through the plain, is vege- 
table mould, or loam with a mixture of fand ; in fome parts, 
a mixture of till or natural clay. Above the bank, to the 
foot of the hills, there are large fields of deep loam, fome 
fmall fields of natural clay, but, in general, the foil is a 
Hght loam, with a mixture of fand or till, and a gravelly 
bottom. This gravelly bottom conveys the water from the 
hills, which, when not carried off by proper drains, is very 
hurtful. The foil in general, among the hills, where they 
are arable, is a light vegetable mould, with fome banks in- 
clining to till or natural clay.

cattle in the ftraw yard ; alfo a little for pafture to give the 
cows an airing. The reft of it, which will commonly be 
about the half, is made into hay ; which the farmer ufes for 
his own horfes, or occafionally fells. The quantity of hay 
upon an acre will be from 200 to 400 ftones, 22 lib. avoir- 
dupois to the ftone. The firft crops were more luxuriant ; 
about 500 ftones of excellent hay have been produced, at an 
average, over a large field. Some of the ftems of clover, in 
the fwath after the mower, meafured in length 4 feet. From 
the lofs of milk cows, and the danger well known in paftur- 
ing red clover by horned cattle, fome of the farmers are now 
laying down part of their land with white clover, rye, and 
rib grafs for pafture. Oats are fown in March and the be- 
ginning of April; the ground is prepared by 1 plowing ; the 
returns from 8 to 12 bolls an acre. One man and a pair of 
horfes plow in the low ground. The ploughs are of diffe- 
rent kinds, fome with iron heads, fome with crooked focks, 
chains below the beam, &amp;c ; but all with caft iron mould- 
boards. — The harrows are different ; fome coupled one way, 
fome another, fome drawn by a pair of horfes, fome by a 
fingle horfe. The rollers ufed are of different conftru&amp;ions 
and different weights, for the purpofes of breaking clods, 
fmoothing the furface for the fmaller feeds, and condenfing 
the lighter foils. There are 4 threfliing machines which are 
found to anfwer well. — Harveft begins in the month of Sep- 
tember, fometimes later even in the low ground, and always 
in the hills. Some of the farmers that have fettled here from

of their flock, the exhaufted ftate of the ground at their

entry, the great rife of rent, and the improvement of their 
farms, have for fome time pad had a ftruggle to fulfil their 
engagements j but now their farms begin to anfwer their own 
expectations, and far to exceed the expectations of thofe a- 
mong whom they have fettled. Nor have the old tenants, 
with liftlefs apathy, feen the exertions and improvements of 
thofe who have fettled among them ; they have not only co- 
pied, but even tried to excel them in improvement. Fallow, 
wheat, and fown grafs have been introduced among the hill 
farms. Lime is now laid on old ley, as well as fallow, with 
judgment and fuccefs. The crops of wheat and fown grafs 
are often confiderable, and o£ good quality. This new mode of 
farming has induced many of them to give up keeping flieep. 
Some of the hill farms are very extenfive. Great part of 
what is called outfield is fteep, and of difficult accefs, lying 
alfo at a diftance from their houfes ; that ground they are 
with great judgment laying out for pafture in parks from a- 
bout 4 to 20 acres. The fmall feuers in the town of Aber- 
nethy, who may have 1, 2, or 3 acres, and not lying all to- 
gether, though they cannot conveniently get it fallowed, are 
laying on lime, fowing grafs, and drilling beans. Each 
farmer raifes as much flax as is fufficient for his own family ; 
little is raifed for fale. 

Inclofures, Orchards, &amp;c. — Some farms in the low ground 
are inclofed, and fubdivided by ditches and thorn hedges. 
The farmers, not thinking the ground adapted to pafture, fay 
the hedges are hurtful, by Hopping the free circulation of 
air, and hoarding a great number of fparrows, and other 
birds, that deftroy the grain. None of the hedges arc in a 
thriving condition (except thofe on the eftate of Craigpettie), 
which is chiefly owing to the little care taken of them. One 
farm at the foot of the hills, containing about 88 acres, fit 

both

both for grain and pafture, Mr. William Sommerville (tho 
having only a leafe of 30 years) has fufficiently inclofed and 
fubdivided by none dikes and thorn hedges at his own ex- 
pence. Frnit trees thrive well in the low ground, and their 
fruit is not thought inferior to any in the country— There 
are 4 orchards in the parifh : Afh, elm, plane trees, &amp;c 
wherever they have been planted, grow to a good fixe, and 
the wood is of the beft quality. The N. fide of the hill is 
particularly adapted for planting. Scotch, and other firs, if 
planted, would turn out to the advantage of the proprietors, 
and tend to beautify the country. A part of thefe hills, 
planted about 20 or 30 years ago, are in a thriving condi- 
tion. 

Cattle, Commerce, Wages, &amp;c — Both cattle and horfes are 
bred in this parifh, of a good fize and confiderable value: 
Some of the farmers pay a particular attention to this pleat- 
ing and profitable objea. There are only 3 flocks of fheep. 
About 30 years ago, almoft every farmer had a flock. At 
that time there was little wheat fown, and no grafs. From 
experience, it is found, that the advantages arifing from wheat 
and grafs, and their being able to breed double the number 
of cattle bred formerly, far overbalances the profit derived 
from keeping fheep. Thofe who now do fp, have a/i exten - 
five range of hilly ground ; a confiderable part of which is 
covered with heath. Confiderable quantities of wheat and, 
barley are fold and carried to Perth, or exported at New- 
burgh fnore. Small quantities of oats and peafe are pur- 
chafed by the farmers in Fife for feed. The ancient fervi- 
tudes, fo oppreffive and harraffing to the farmer, are almoft 
entirely abolifhed. Men fervants get from 61. to iol. Ster- 
ling a-year ; women fervants from 2I. 10s. to 3I. Men fer-

Rivers, Fijh, I/land, Mills, &amp;c.-The Tay, which walhes 
part of the northern boundary, is navigable ; it affords many 
falmon and fea-trout. The proprietor of Carpow has timings 
upon it, which yield him iool. per annum. In the middle 
of this river, oppofite to Mugdrum, (which is in the parifli of 
Newburgh), is an ifland (called Mugdrum ljland) belonging 
to this parifh. It is nearly 1 Englifh mile in length ; its 
breadth varies, but its greateft is i 9 8 yards 1 foot. It mea- 
fures 31 acres, of which %i are embanked under cultivation, 
and produce luxuriant crops ; the remaining part is efteemed 
valuable as a fait marfli for pafture. There is a houfe upon it, 
in which the tenant refides with his family ; it rents about 
681. Sterling. Mr. Hay of Leys, the proprietor, has fifliings 

in the river that rent at about 200I. yearly The Earn, 

which bounds the northern part of the parifli, (till it falls into

fource of much agricultural improvement, as mod of the 
farmers have their lime brought by water, either from the 
N. of England, or the Earl of Elgin's lime kilns on the coaft 
of Fife. It produces falmon and trout as the Tay. The 
falmon are of an excellent quality, fell at 6d. and 7 d: per 
lib. in the fpring, and 4 d. during fummer. Few indeed are 
fold in the neighbourhood. They are chiefly fent to Perth, 
and from thence to the Englifti market. Fiflring upon the 
Tay begins about the middle of April ; upon the Earn, 
when not frozen, about the beginning of February % it is given 
over in both on the 1 jth of Auguft. There are two pafiage 
boats on the Earn : one at Cary, which is feldom employed ; 
another at Ferryfield, upon the eftate of Carpow : this place 
being near the junction of the Earn and the Tay, the boat be- 
longing to it is often employed; in carrying paffengers over the 
Tay to the Carfe of Gowrie. There are 20 boats from the 
parifh ufually employed in fifhing during the feafon ; each 
boat having 2 men, who are generally tradefmen or labourers 
in the neighbourhood: they are allowed, for wages, 6s. 6d. 
a- week, with what trout they catch. The Farg, a rivulet, 
about an EngliOi mile and a half W. from Abernethy, a- 
bounds with fmall trout. Upon it there are one oil mill, 
with 2 corn and 2 lint ditto belonging to this parifh.— There 
is another fmall rivulet, called the Batto Burn, that runs by 
Abernethy on the W. and fupplies the inhabitants with wa- 
ter ; on it alfo there is a corn mill.

difcharge of his duty. The fpirit of feceffion has for fome 
time paft been on the decline. The members of the enablifh- 
ment and the Antiburghers live in the mofl friendly habits. 

Schools and Poor.— There are 2 fchools in the parilh, at an 
average about p fcholars at each during the winter. The 
parochial fchoolmafter has generally that number throughout 
the year. His falary, and perquifites as feffion-clerk, amounts

'* ed by the Earl of Angus;" probably he meant Archibald Earl of Angus' 
Lord of Abernethy, who gave the town a Charter of Privileges, Auguft 23. 
1476. The Earl might be a benefactor to the Collegiate Church, • or reftore it 
to a better ftate than it had been in for fome time before, and, on that account, 
might be faid to have founded it. To the above charter, a venerable man, Sir 
John Frizzle, (that is Frazer), Provoft of the Collegiate Church of Aber- 
nethy, was one of the witnefles. This charter was renewed by William Earl 
of Angus, at Holyroodhoufe, on; the 16th of November 1628. By this chaiter

Roads and Bridges. There are 2 public roads; that 

which leads to Fife by Newburgh is in tolerable repair ; the 
other, which is through the glen of Abernethy (and by winch 
great quantities of coal and lime are brought from Fife to 
Strathearn) is very bad ; that which ftrikes off the glen to 
Auchtermuchty, is in winter almoit impaffable. The ftatute 
labour, and compontion-money allowed, are totally inadequate 
to keep thefe roads in repair. There are % bridges over the 
Farg ; the one at Gowly, which is old and ruinous, the 
other below Potty Mill, which is too narrow for carriages, 
and lies at fome diftance from the public road. A new bridge 
over this water, near Aberargie, would be a defirable objeft, 
as after heavy rains it fwells to fuch a height, and is fo rapid, 
that it is both difficult and dangerous to crofs it. 

Antiquities Tn the church-yard Hands a tower of an ex- 
traordinary conftrudtion. It confifts of 64 courfes of hewn, 
{lone, laid circularly and regularly, is in height 74 feet, in 
circumference 48 feet. It is difficult to affign this to any but 
the Pidts, as it Hands in the capital of their dominions. There 
is but one other tower of a fimilar ftrudture in Scotland, viz. 
at Brechin. The ufe of thefe towers, according to the lateft 
and moft probable conjectures, was not only for the con- 
finement of thofe who were doing penance, but alfo for call- 
ing people to public worfhip by the found of a horn or 
trumpet, before the introduction of bells. S. W. from the

them a profitable crop, if properly managed. For the know- 
ledge, however, of this, and indeed of improvements in ge- 
neral, this county and neighbourhood are principally, if not 
altogether, indebted to Mr. Barclay of Urie, whofe exer- 
tions in agriculture have been very great, and attended with 
fuccefs. The climate here is rather cold than otherwife, but

as many of the leafes are of an old date, the rents at prefent

Lord Monboddo, are in this agreeable fituation. They hold 
their farms on eafy, and, perhaps, peculiar terms ; and, from

Church, School, and Poor — The church was partly rebuilt 
in 17 7 1, and is in good condition, but is ill contrived for 
the intended purpofe, and too fmall for the congregation. 
Thofe of the Scotch Epifcopal perfualion have a fmall meet- 
ing houfe for public worlhip. The manfe was built about 
70 years ago, and has been three times repaired. The fti- 
pend was augmented laft year, and is now 56 bolls of meal, 
32 bolls of bear, and 43I. 17s. ic4d. in money, including 
5I. for communion elements. The glebe is a little above the 
legal fize. Mrs. Helen Milne Nicolfon of Glenbervy is pa-

and a dwelling-houfe for the mailer. The fchool fees, for 
teaching Englifh and writing, are is. 6d. ; for arithmetic,

<p>Situation, Extent, Surface, and Soil. 

THIS pariih is divided on the N. and E. by high hills, 
from the pariflies of Monymulk, Oyne, Premnay and 
Lefly. It is in form fomewhat irregular, but compact ; the 
inhabited part of it extending from the church, in all direc- 
tions, from ii to 2 miles. By furveys made of the different 
eftates, it contains 1^04 acres arable, and 431 acres palture 
ground, befides a confiderable extent of hills and moor, and 
360 acres in wood, moftly natural. As the arable ground 
lies partly on the declivities of hills, and partly in a flat 
country, interfered by the river Don, the foil is various, 
and the furface unequal. The hills are moftly covered with 
heath, and afford tolerable pafture for iheep and black cattle, 
pf a fmall breed. 



Climate 



45 6 Statiftteal Account 

Climate and Difeafes — The country is inland, and confider- 
ably above the level of the fea. The winters, therefore, are 
often pretty fevere, and the work of the fpring is fometimes 
retarded by the long continuance of froft and fnow ; yet the 
harveft is not later here than in moll other parts of the coun- 
ty. Owing to the vicinity of high hills, thunder, and partial 
dowers of rain, are pretty frequent in fummer. Fogs are 
often feen refting upon the river, and fome part of the low 
grounds, in the nights of July and Auguft; the corn, how- 
ever, if fowed in proper feafon, is feldom materially injured 
by froft or mildews. The climate is certainly very favour- 
able to the human conftitution. No epidemical diftemper, 
excepting the fmall pox and meaftes, has been known for. 
many years. The influenza was not communicated to others, 
by thofe who had caught it in Aberdeen. The people are, in 
general, healthy ; and neither rheumatic nor bowel complaints 
are frequent, though their honfes are often damp and inef- 
ficient, and, in fume feafons, fuel fcarce and bad. The fcro- 
phula may perhaps be reckoned the molt common diftemper ; 
and, when pulmonary or hypochondriacal affeftions occur, thefe 
complaints are generally connected with a fcmphulous taint 
in the blood. The affiftance of a phyfician is feldom alked, 
till the cafe is defperate. In all inward diforders, whilky or 
black beer are the common prefcriptions. In cutaneous erup- 
tions, (which are much lefs common, and confidered as more 
difgraceful than formerly), recourfe is too frequently had to 
mercurial belts and ointments, which can be got in moft coun- 
try mops. The confequences are often fatal. The country 
people are lefs reluftant than formerly, to go as patients to the 
Infirmary of Aberdeen, where they find themfelves treated 
with much kindnefs and attention.

Female Employments, &amp;c — Knitting ftockings for the Aber- 
deen manufactures is the principal occupation of the women. 
Half a crown weekly may be earned by a very good hand ; 
and it is fuppofed that a fum, equal to two thirds of the land 
rent, is annually gained in this way. As a lint mill has 
been lately erefted in a neighbouring parilh, it is probable 
that another manufacture will be gradually introduced. 

Agriculture, Produce, &amp;c. — Excepting the few mechanics 
mentioned in the table, the men are chiefly employed in 
agriculture. Improvements in that branch, however, are 
yet in their infancy. Few of the tenants fow grafs feeds, or 
raife more turnips or potatoes than are neceflary for the pot. 
The general mode of culture is that which has already been 
repeatedly related, in the accounts of feveral pariihes in the 
N. of Scotland. Bear, or bigg, with dung, and afterwards 
2 crops of oats, femetimes mixed with rye, is the common 

rotatioa 



of Keig. 459 

option upon infield. The outfield, after producing 3 or 
4 crops of oats, is left unplowed 3, 4, or 5 years more. The 
rid.es of both Out and Infield are generally very broad, and 
not* very ftraight. They are often very much raifed m the 
middle, and baulks left betwixt them without any apparent 
neceffity. There are fome farms of confiderable extent, lhe 
reft are fmall ; and the horfes and cattle of two neighbouring 
tenants are often joined in one plough. The number of 
ploughs is 47, which are drawn by 88 horfes, 87 cows, and 
153 oxen and young cattle. Creels (or bafkets) are {till ufed 
for carrying dung and fuel on the fides of horfes. Where 
there are neither green crops, hay, inclofures, nor winter 
herding, cattle and fheep mull fare very poorly for a confi- 
derable part of the year. The greater part of the fheep be- 
long to the poffeffors of crofts and pendicles ; and they are left, 
for one half of the year, to wander, during the day, in fmall 
parcels of from 10 to 40.- They are therefore much more 
detrimental to the neighbours, than advantageous to their 
owners. It is fuppofed, however, that this parifti commands 
hill paflure for fheep, to the extent of at leaft 2000 acres. 

Farm-Rents, Wages, &amp;c— The rent of the infield ground 
is from lis. to 21s.; of outfield, from as. to 5s. per acre. 
The rent is paid partly in money, and partly in grain, cuf- 
toms, fervices, and mill multures. The wages of men fer- 
vants are from 4I. 10s. to 61. 10s., or 7I.;— of women Ser- 
vants, from 2l. to 3I. per annum ; — of day labourers, 6d. 
with maintainance. There are few day-labourers, as it is only^ 
at fome feafons of the year that they could find employment 
from the farmers. Reapers are hired for the harveft, the 
men at 2I. and the women at il. 



Roads. — Aberdeen is the neareft fea port, being 25I. miles

diftant. The roads are made, and kept in repair, by the fta- 
tute labour ; but the landholders, in this and other parifhes 
in the neighbourhood, have lately fubfcribed different pro- 
portions of the valued rents of their eftates, for the purpofe 
of making fome miles of road in a new trad to Aberdeen. 

Church, School, atia. Poor. — The Crown is patron. The 
ftipend, including communion element money, is 53I. 6s. 8d., 
1 chalders meal, and 1 chalder bear. The teind victual, paid 
from lands in this parifli to Monymulk, amounts to a 2 bolls 
of meal — The fchoolmafter's falary is 100 merks Scotch. 
The number of children, who attend the fchool, is from 10 
to 30. — Befides the poor on the roll, who, for feveral years 
pad, have not exceeded 10,. others have been affifted occafion- 
ally. The parifli funds, at prefent, are 3I. ics. per annum, 
for interefl of money lent. The annual colledions, Sec. may 
amount to, from 5I. to 81. Till lately, the poor were more 
numerous, and the parifli funds lefs confiderable ; but no per- 
fon, belonging to this 'parifli, has begged for 15 years paft. 
The people, in general, are fufficiently attentive andaffilling 
to their neighbours, when in want or diftrefs. The refiding 
heritors are remarkably fo ; and their attention and affiftance 
are not confined to their own eftates.

(County and Synod of Rofs-Rrejbytery of lain.) 
By the Rev. Mr. Alexander Munro, Minifter,</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, and Extent. 

THE parifli of Eddertown certainly derives its name 
from its fituation, being on all fides, excepting the N., 
furroufided by hills .and mountains. It is pronounced Eder- 
doun in Gaelic, and furely ought to be written fo in Englifti. 
The parifli is fituated in that part of the county of Rofs, call- 
ed Eafter Rofs. \% is about 10 miles in length, and 7 in 
breadth, and the Frith of Tain waihes its coaft on the N. 

Rivulets, Soil, Cultivation, Sec.— There are no rivers of 
note, but feveral fmall rivulets, known by the appellation of 
burns ; which, when fwelled with rainy weather, being with- 
out bridges, greatly interrupt the traveller. Here there is a 
a variety of foils, generally deep and rich j but the moifture

the pari fl le nd ^ Th£re ^ naturalwoQd 

Sir Charles Rofs of Balnagowa, and Mr. M'Leod of Caboll 
have fome hundred acres planted with Scotch firs. 

Cattle, Cultivation, and Produce.— There are about loco 
black cattle in the parilh. There are no Iheep walks ; but 
as every tenant and cottager rears a few flieep, the number 
upon the whole muft be confiderable. As there are no im- 
provements in hufbandrv, the time and attention of the peo- 
ple is taken up in the management of the farms, which re- 
quire many hands, and occupy many cattle, their horfes and 
oxen being of a fmall fi ze . Thofe of Mr. Hugh Scobie of 
Ardmore, however, muft be excepted. This gentleman la- 
bours fuccefsfully according to the new fyftem, and was late- 
ly at the expence of bringing a manure, known by the name 
of Jhelly /and, from the ifland of Tanara, near Ullapool, 
through the Pentland Frith, to his farm at Ardmore. His 
labour and expence are already moft amply repaid. His flock 
of cattle is large, and of the beft quality, the place giving 
him every advantage for thefe purpofes. In fummer he abounds, 
with grafs, and in winter he has the beft of covering, and a 
good more. He likewife rears large quantities of wheat, bar- 
ley, oats, beans, peafe, potatoes, turnips, and artificial grafs. 
The farm of EaJler-Fearn, for which, about 40 years ago, a 
tenant could not be found at the rent of 21I , is fo improved 
by watering, that it lets now at more than triple that fum. 

Inclofures, Fuel, i$c — This parifli is very capable of im- 
provement, having great tracts of moors, gently Hoping, with 
clay and gravelly bottoms *. The grounds inclofed by Sir

with barley, oats, turnips, potatoes, clover and rye-grafs. The 
whole inclofure eonfifts of 300 Scotch acres, of a circular 
form, and on the outfide of the circle is a deep belting of firs, 
afla, and other foreft timbers. The death of that gentleman 
feems to have put a ftop to any more of the ground being 
fubdivided and turned into corn land. Few parillies have 
more the means of improvement within themfelves ; the foil of 
the moors is good ; there is great abundance of turf f and peat;' 
and the burn of Daan, which is pretty centrical, abounds 
with lime. There are great quantities of fea weed, commonly 
called fea ware, on all our mores.

Admiral Sir John Ross of Balnagowan, inclofed and fubdivided, with excel- 
lent ftone dikes, about 60 acres. 

f Here it may not be improperto take notice of the Dutch ivay of preparing 
turf. As foon as the Dutch have fown their fpring corn, they begin to pre- 
pare the turf for winter fuel. They firft take off the green fod ; they then 
pour water on the turf mould, and dig it out, by little and little, till they reach 
fandy foil. The hole is made flopping, that a horfe and cart may go into it. 
This mud is carted out on a field; then fpread with a fpade, to 3 or 4 inches 
thick ; then cut crofs ways. Thofe who wilh to have their turf ftill harder, 
fqueefe the mi d, whilft foft, into round forms, refenibling loaves, or form them 
in fhapes like brick making, and then let them dry in the fields. When the 
pieces of turf are become a little hard, they are laid in heaps, that they may 
dry, and be more effectually fheltered from rain. From t! i El ey are carried 
home, and put under a roof. The turf foil is either brown, red, or black, but 
muft not be mixed with fand or clay.

Rents and Proprietors. — The grofs rent of the pa'fifti li 
about 650 bolls of grain, and 500I. Sterling in money. The 
rent is flu&amp;uating, but is daily increafing. The heritors are, 
Sir Charles Rofs of Balnagown, Mr. M'Leod of Cadboll, 
Mr. M'Kenzie of Ardrofs, Mr. John Robertfon merchant in 
Glafgow, and Mr. Rofs of Kerfe. None of thefe gentlemen 
refide in the parilh. 

Church and School, — The Church is lituated within a mile 
of the eaftern extremity of this parilh. Both church and 
manfe are old, and ftand much in need of repairs. The fti- 
pend is 120 bolls of grain, and 9I. 14s. 6d. Sterling for 
vicarage and communion elements. All the parifhioners are 
in communion with the church of Scotland. The patron is 
Capt. Kenneth M'Kenzie of Cromarty — There is a parochial

is increafing. 

Employments and Character. — We have no eftablimed ma- 
nufactures ; but the women and girls are often employed in 
fpinning, what in this country we call factory yarn, from lint} 
and the bell fpinners among them, with difficulty, earn 2 Id. 
per day. The people fubfift chiefly by agriculture, and like 
their neighbours, are of a mixt charader. They are very in- 
duftrious j and, upon the whole, are very regular in attend- 
ing divine ordinances. 

Antiquities, &amp;c There is a large plain, about half a mile 

to the W. of the church, and in circumference about 2 miles, 
where there are evident marks of an encampment. Tradi-

tion fays, that a battle was fought here againfl the Danes*. 
Near to this there is a large circle of earth, flat in the top, 
and raifed about 2 feet above the level of the ground around it. 
it. In the centre of this circle, there is a large obelifk, above 10 
feet high above the ground. No tool feems to have been em- 
ployed in forming it, though there are fome rude figures ftiJI 
difcernible, the largeft of a triangular form, with final! circles 
fufpended from it. Here the Prince of Denmark, who com- 
manded his countrymen, is faid to be interred. The plain is 
called Carriblair; and the village, immediately to the S. of 
it, is to this day dalled Ballioch, or Phyjician's "Town, where, 
it is faid, the wounded were lodged and taken care off. There 
is only one other piece of antiquity, that merits attention, which 
is Bunalijkag, about 4 miles from the church, by the fea fide. 
It is one of thefe circular buildings., called by fome cairns, by 
others douns. The ftones are of a very large frze, and laid 
very regularly and clofe. To the S. W. it is flill about ia 
feet high, and 7 where it is lowed J. The entry is to the 
E.; and the, middle of the wall, which makes the circle, is

trenching it, along with the ground around it, his fpade ftruck againfl a coffin. 
He foon found five of them, in which there were human fkeletons perfectly en- 
tire, excepting one that wanted the head. The coffins were made of fir, and

the bodies was about 5 feet 10 inches.

TOWN AND PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1016931">HUNTLY</name>. 



(County of Aberdeen Synod of Moray Prsjbytery of 

Straihbogie) 



By the Rev. Mr. Robert Inner, Minifler.</head> 



<p>EreBion and Names. 

J_jUNTLY, which is the modern name of the parifh, con- 
fifts of 2 divifion9, the town and the country part. The 
town bears by much the greater proportion. The parifti con- 
lifted, formerly, of 2 diftind pariihes, both ferved by one par- 
ton. The name of the one was Dumbenan, which lignifies 
the bottom of the hill ; and accordingly all the farm-houies are 
placed at the bottom of the different hills furrounding the 
village, fuch as, Clajhmach, the grey-headed hill ; Bin-hill, 
or the flony-hill ; Ordfull, or the battle-hill, &amp;c. The name 
of the other parilh, before they were united, was Kinore t that 
is, the gold or yellow-headed hill ; and in all public advertife- 
ments it is ftill thus diftinguimed — Thefe 2 pariihes of Dum- 

3 N 2 benaa 



4^8 Statijlical Account 

benan and Kinore were united by a decree of the Lords of 
Seflion and Plantation of Kirks, and called the parifli of 
Huntly, in honour of the Duke of Gordon's eldeft fon ; and 
a place of worfliip erected, centrical to both, in the year 1727. 

Extent and Roads.— The extremity of that part of the parifli, 
called Kinore, is diftant from the town of Huntly 3 computed 
miles, over very rough and rocky ground ; and to the extremity 
of the other, called Dumbenan, it is alfo 3 computed miles, 
equally rough and rocky ; and, indeed, in thofe parts where 
the roads through the parifli have been attempted to be made 
by ftatute labour, as they have hitherto been conducted, they 
are often impaflable. 

Climate, "Difeafes, %sc — The air of Huntly is falubrious. 
There are no diftempers peculiar to this place, but what are 
common to other manufacturing towns. Weavers, and thofe 
whofe bufinefs confines them to low and damp ftiops, may be 
more fubject to aflhmatic and fcorbutic complaints, but the 
place, on the whole, is healthy, and the inhabitants, who 
are in general fobef and induftrious, live to a good age. 
There are many now living in the parifli aged from 70 to 87; 
and one died a few years ago aged 90. But the number of 
ale-h©ufes, and private retailers of fpiritous liquors, not only 
becomes hurtful to the health, but very prejudicial to the 
morals of the lower clafs of tradefmen and mechanics. 

Hill y \fc. — In Kinore there is a hill called St. Mango, on 
the W. fide of which there is a fpring ifiuing from it, called 
St. Mungo's Well, of no medicinal quality but what arifes • 
from fuperftitious credulity. On the top of the N. end, there 
is a large circular opening, which, in a rainy feafon, is full 
of water, and feldoro quite empty. In very dry fummers 

fome 



of Huntly. 469 

feme peats have been got from it, but of a fulphurous nature. 
Many pieces of hard and porous fluff, refembling lava, or ra- 
ther the refufe of a fmith's forge, have been found about it. 
Near to this opening there is a very large ftone, and another 
juft by it of a much lefs fize, the fuperficies of each exaftly 
correfponding to the other, as if they had fallen afunder by 
fome extraordinary convulfion. The whole of this hill as 
now inclofed, and planted with trees of various kinds. 

fawn The town is placed in a dry and healthy fituation, 

furrounded with hills, but at a convenient diftance, all moft- 
ly inclofed, full of plantations of firs, elms, oaks, birch, &amp;c. 
It is the feat of the prefbytery, and a poft town. There 
are 2 principal ftreets in the town of Huntly, eroding each 
other at right angles, forming a fpacious fquare, where the 
weekly and other markets are held. Here too there was 
once a town-houfe and a prifon ; but they are now demolifh~ 
cd. On each fide of the fquare there are many decent and 
commodious dwelling-houfes ; and many on the flreet leading 
t0 i t , A fpirit of building ftill prevails. 

Rivers, Bridges, Mills, i$c — Two pleafant rivers run on 
each fide of it • the Doveron on the W. and the Bogie on the 
E., both uniting half a mile below it, where they prefent a 
delightful and romantic fcene, and, thus uniting, glide over a 
rough and rocky channel, fhaded with trees on each fide, till 
they fall into the fea at Banff, 21 miles N. E. of Huntly. On 
each of the rivers there is a bridge : that over the Bogie 
is modern^ and has 3 arches, very convenient for heavy car- 
riages to and from Aberdeen,, which is 34 meafured miles 
diftant ; and for bringing peats and turf from the mofs, 5 miles 
diftant. The name of this river is faid to be Gaelic, and to 
fignify marjhy flow-running water. The water is of an excellent 

quality, 



47° Stat't/iical Account 

quali^, and fit for every purpofe, particularly whitening and 
bleach.ng cloth. There are, accordingly, feveral bleaclLds 
r.chly covered in the bleaching feafon with white linen cloth 
to a great value, thread, ftockings, cotton, &amp;c. Upon this 
water (which rifes in the parifh of Achindore, 8 miles S of 
Huntly, and is increafed by the water of Kirkney and Kefs 
$o gl e, with fome fmall burns), there are feveral mills for 
grinding corn, barley, malt, and other grain, well occupied 
from the adjacent fruitful fields. One of thefe, called the 
Mill of Huntly, is in this parilh, and is fupplied with water 
from the Bogie—The river Doveron takes its fource in the 
Cabrach, 12 miles above Huntly; a little below it meets 
with a river called the Black-water, and is increafed by fome 
fmall burns, till it becomes very full and rapid at the Kirk of 
Glafs. Over the river Doveron there is a bridge of 1 arch 
very ancient, but very ftrong, built upon a rock ; and each 
ftone of the arch, as far as the river in a flood may be fuppof- 
ed to reach, is ftrongly bound together with iron. Standing 
upon the bridge, one has a moft agreeable view, whether he 
looks downward to the fpot where the rivers join, called the 
Invers, or up the river, gliding through fpacious and fruitful 
fields on each fide. It leads alfo to Huntly Lodge through a 
broad avenue, gently afcending to the Houfe, fhaded with 
trees of various kinds *. The Doveron would be often im- 

paflable, 

• It may not be improper to obferve, that, though, for time immemorial, the 
water has kept its prefent courfe, there is ground to think it has not always done 
fo ; but that its ancient courfe had been by a long range of bank, now called 
the Me doiu Braes, and terminating at a place called the Kiln Barn,, probably 
from its having been the place where the out houfe?, ftables, barns, &amp;c. of that 
noble family flood, when they reCded at the caftle, and which have fince been 
detached to a proper diftance from it. The old fuundations are ftill to be fcen. 
This long curved bank is now inclufcd by a ditch and ftrong hedge, correfpond- 

ing 



of Huntly, 471 

paffible, were it not for this bridge, by which the roads on 
the other fide lead, the one to Portfoy, 10 computed miles 
diftant northward ; the other to Keith, Fochabers, Gordon 
Caftle, and the river Spey. 

Fifb. — Both the Doveron and the Bogie afford excellent 
trouts. Thofe of the Bogie are preferable to the others, from 
its muddy and clayey bottom, and perhaps from the foft qua- 
lity of its water. After a flood, many falmon are got; and did 
the proprietors Of the falmon-fifhing, at Banff, obferve the le- 
gal openings in their cruives or dikes, many more might be 
caught, to the great advantage of the different heritors. 

Minerals. — Upon the banks of the Doveron, near its junc- 
tion with the Bogie, there was an attempt made, fome years

able depth, many pieces of a black friable matter, like the 
ore which the lead pencils are made of, were got ; but the 

work was difcontinued A lime-flone quarry was happily 

difcovered, fome years ago, in the S. W. end of the pariih, 
but when opened, it was found fo difficult to get at, that it was 
abandoned, after working to a confiderable depth.-^-Near the 
fame place there is a kind of white marble, of which the 
author has feen a horizontal dial made, perfectly fmooth on 

the furface, and all the lines and figures drawn quite clear as 
on flate. 



Agriculture . — In this parifh there are many excellent farms, 
rented from 20I. to 60I., including a certain proportion of 
farm meal, of the beft quality, which the tenants are obliged 

to 

ing to the turns of the fuppofed ancient courfe of the river, and planted with a, 
variety of trees, different fhrubs, and clumps of nurfcries, all kept in good con- 
dition and very thriving.

to carry from the granary at their own charge, and which is 
all the fervice the proprietor requires. It would feem, that 
the country in general had not been favourable for the pro- 
duftion of barley, till of late that the erection of diRilleries 
has encouraged farmers, to prepare their grounds for that 
now very vendible grain. But were farmers more encou- 
raged, by the heritors granting longer leafes than are general- 
ly given, under certain reftriftions, and modes of improve- 
ment, it would give vigour and fpirit to the induftrious farm- 
er. He would be encouraged to improve his land to the 
higheft degree of cultivation, of which it was capable ; and 
the face of the country would prefent a more beautiful ap- 
pearance, and become more profitable to both landholder and 
tenant. At prefent, except Heightening the ridges, where 
that can be done, little more, in fuch a ftate, can, in general, 
be looked for. Some of the molt fubftantial tenants have 
ftrong ploughs and good cattle ; but moil farmers plow with 
poor horfes, and weak cattle, yoked together, 

Cattle. The number of cattle cannot be afcertained. 

Many dealers in that article, rent parks from the neighbour- 
ing proprietors, for the fole purpofe of keeping their Hock on 
hand, for a few days or weeks, till they have opportunity of 

driving to market. This is not a Iheep country. The in- 

•clofures and planting oblige the tenant to reduce the .number 
of thefe ufeful animals, and the few that are in it are poor and 
ihabby, and of a comparatively diminutive fize ; except thofe 
xvedders that range the hills, and are feldom or never hpufed, 
or fuch sis are fed, and fold for butcher-meat. 

Improvements and Produce, \3c. — The village of Huntly 
has furprifingly increafed within thefe 50 years, in popula- 
tion and induftry, infomuch that, where all around it, for

ibme didance, was formerly barren heath, fwamps, or marfh, 
there is now fcarcely one uncultivated fpot to be feen ; and 
barley, oats, lint, potatoes, and turnips, are produced in a. 
bundance, where nothing grew before. This fpirit of im- 
provement and manufacture was firft introduced by a few 
who dealt in the yarn trade. From their laudable example, 
3 nd from obferving the profits arifing from induftry, others 
were encouraged j and now it is become one of the firft vil- 
lages in the North, both in point of population and manufac- 
tures. Being fituated in the midft of a large and fertile coun- 
try, the induftrious inhabitants have a ready fale for what 
they bring to market, by which many poor cottagers and fub- 
tenants are enabled to pay for their fcanty poffeffions. 

Prices of Labour and Provifions.—TUe advanced price of 
all the neceffaries of life makes wages high in proportion. 
The common hire of a ploughman is from 7I. to 81. yearly, 
of a day-labourer from 8d. to lod. or is., according to the 
work he is hired for, and his Ikill in doing it. A mafon's 
wages are is. 3d. a-day ; a Wright's and Hater's the fame, when 
the work is not undertaken by private bargain — The price 
of provifions, of all kinds, has been greatly advanced of late 
years; that of filh, in particular, has increafed. Haddocks, 
formerly fold for 5d. or 6d. the dozen, now fell for 73. gd. and 
jeven fometimes is. 6d. the half dozen, The beft beef fells at 
344, and 4d. the pound ; and mutton from is. 6d, to 2s. the 
quarter. 

Rent and Proprietors. — The real rent of the parifh is 
about 1700I. Sterling, and the valued rent about 2600I. 
Scotch. The Duke of Gordon is proprietor of the whole 
parifh, excepting a haugh of land in the N.' end of Kinore, 
which belongs to Mr. Gordon of Avochy.

Church, The Church, when firft ereCted, might have 
been perhaps large enough, to contain more than, at that time, 
attended the Ettablifhed worfhip, but it cannot now hold 
above 3 fourths of the parifh, though 3 galleries have been 
of late ereCted. One of thefe is direCtly fronting the pulpit, 
which, from the narrownef3 of the church, proves a very 
great incumbrance to the fpeaker's voice, and equally fo to 
many of the hearers. The other a galleries were ereCted at 
the expence of the feffion, and the rent of the feats annually- 
paid for the ufe of the poor. If there had been a church. 
ereCted here, equal to the number of inhabitants, and fuited 
to the high rank of the patron, it would have prevented many 
diffenters and feCtaries, and, what is of greater confequence, 
would have contributed to a more religious obfervation of the 
Sabbath j as many, who cannot find room in the church, either 
go to other places of worlhip, ftay at home, or ftroll in the 
fields. — There are other 3 places of public worfhip, I of the Se- 
ceffion (Antiburgher), 1 of the Church of England, and I of 
Roman Catholics j but the numbers attending thefe are^ not 
increafing. The paftors of each, however, live in mutual 
friendfhip and Chriftian charity. There is no manfe proper- 
ly belonging to the minifter. There is a glebe, but it lies at 
fuch a diftance from the town, that the prefent incumbent 
finds it more profitable, to let it in leafe from year to year, 
than to cultivate it. It confifts of io acres of ground, of va- 
rious qualities, partly of a hard, dry, and faady foil, and

Schools — There is a parochial fchool, but it is poorly en- 
dowed, the falary being only 61. 18s. iod., with the perqui- 
fites, viz. 6d. for each baptifm, is. for each marriage, and 2I. 
4s. 5d. as feflion- clerk. Thefe, with the quarterly payments 
for teaching, (Englifli is. 6d., for writing and arithmetic, 2s., 
and for Latin 2s. 6d.) are the whole of the fchoolmafter's emo- 
luments. There are other private fchools here, of great ad- 
vantage both to parents and children 5 neverthelefs a Sunday, 
or a charity fchool would be of great ufe. 

Poor — The fund for the fupport of the poor confifts chiefly 
of collections from the congregation, which, at an average, 
may be from 53. to 8s. weekly ; with the intereft of 1000 merks 
of mortified money, and fome lent out on bills, together with 
penalties incurred by delinquents, and the rents of the feats 
in the 2 galleries. The feffion regularly meet every two 
months, and diftribute to the poor on the roll, according as 
their neceffities (from the bed of their knowledge and infor- 
mation) demand ; befides many interim dilburfements for cof- 
fins, (hoes, clothes, 8cc. as occafion requires. The gallery in the 
front being ere&amp;ed at the expence of the Society of Weavers, 
the money arifing from it is allotted to indemnify that expence. 
The inhabitants in generalare of that charitable difpontion,which 
tends to invite many poor people, and even whole families, 
from other parts, to refide among them. The writer hereof

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3660486">CARNOCK</name>. 

(County and Synod of Fifc-—Prefbytery of Dunfermline,} 
By the Rev. Mr. Alexander Thomson.</head> 



<p>Origin of the Name. 

IT is not known, when, either the parifh, or the village 
from which it is denominated, received the name of 
Carnock. But it is probable, that this happened at the time 
when the Gaelic was the prevailing language in the Lowlands 
of Scotland. In that language, the words Cair, or Cairn, 
and Knock, (of which Carnock is fuppofed to be a compound), 
fignify a Village, or Collection of Houfes adjoining to aftnall 
hill, which is verj expreffive of its fituation. The adjoining 
eminence of Carneil Hill feems to have been the fpot where a 
battle wa3 once fought, probably during the time of the Da- 
nifli invafion, in 1039, or 1042*; and perhaps derived its 
name (Cairn- Neil) from one of the chieftains who fell on that 
eccafion.

Situation, Extent, Surface, and Hills. — This parifh is fitu- 
ated in the weftern extremity of the county of Fife. Its 
form is nearly fquare, if we except an excrefcence containing 
the barony of Pitdennies, which terminates in the village of 
Cairney-hill, and extends the whole breadth of the parifh at 
its fouthern extremity. The length and breadth are about 3 
Englifh miles at a medium f . The ground is level towards 
the E., but has a gentle declivity towards the S., and is 
bounded on the N. and N. E. by fome hills, which terminate 
in a precipice, called Craig-Lufcar, beyond the limits of the 
parifh. Other hills, called the Clums, feparate this parifh 
from that of Saline. Moft of the ground confifts of gentle 
declivities. The Camp's Bank on the S. and Carneil Hills on 
the W. are confiderable eminences, commanding extenfive 
profpe&amp;s of the Frith of Forth, and the country adjacent. 
The former has a fine expofure towards the S., confuting 
xnoftly of arable land greatly improved j the latter confifts of 
excellent pafture. 

Soil, Produce, Woods, &amp;c. — The foil is partly black earth, 
and partly clay or till. In feveral places there is a mixture 
of gravel near the furface 5 but the two firft fpecies of foil 
are moft prevalent, and the country is of confequence pretty 
fertile. The hills, except fuch as are in tillage, are in general 
covered with grafs ; but the heath begins to appear upon the 
iifing grounds towards the N. The ground produces crops 
of oats, barley, peafe, wheat, turnips, and fown grafs, in con- 
fiderable quantities. There is aUp natural grafs, mixed with 
feveral herbs, and fit for pafture, on thofe grounds, which

either are not arable, or have not been tilled within the me- 
mory of man. There are pretty confiderable plantations of 
wood on the lands of Clune and Pitdennies, chiefly fir, with 
fome alh and larix trees intermixed. In Lufcar Dtan (or 
Den) there are feveral pleafant walks among the trees, with 
very romantic fcenery ; and upon the banks of the rivulet, 
near the village of Carnock, there are fome trees which have 
Hood thefe 50 years, and afford a refreftiing lhade during the 
heat of fummer. 



Climate and Di/eafes.— The air is rather damp in winter 
and fpring, but in fummer it is abundantly falubrious. Epi- 
demical diftempers are more rare in this, than in fome of the 
neighbouring parifhes. The mod common complaints are 
coughs and rheumatifms, which prevail moft in winter and 
fpring. Fevers and fluxes are rare. The fmall-pox general- 
ly vifits the parifh once in 3 or 4 years. The 4 laft returns 
were in 1780, 1783, 1787, and 1789. That of 1787 was by 
far the moft fevere, when 15 children out of 45 died of that 
diftemperj and that of 1789, the moft favourable, when only- 
three died out of 63 ; and, of thefe 3, one at leaft was in bad 
health before. In 1780 and 1783, the medium of deaths was 
from 4 to 6 each year, though a great many had that difeafe. 
Inoculation has as yet made but little progrefs, though the 
prejudices of the common people, againft that falutary prac- 
tice, feem to be fubfiding. 

Agriculture, Crops, Exports, &amp;c.-_The rotation of crops is 
much the fame here as in other parts of the country. After 
rye-grafs, oats, fometimes repeated, then peafe and beans, then 
turnips or potatoes, or fallow and lime, fucceeded by a crop 
of wheat. There feems to be a feventh part of the arable 
land in fallow and turnips, and about a feventh part under

fown grafs. The ploughs employed by the farmers are the 
common Scotch plough and Small's plough. The latter was 
introduced here within thefe laft 10 years. When the ground 
is limed, 5 or 6 bolls of lime, mixed with dung or compoft, 
generally fuffices for an acre ; but a much larger quantity is 
found neceffary on land taken in from moors. Upon part of 
the eftate of Clune, about 50 bolls per acre were ufed, when 
it was firft improved. Inclofures have made great progrefs 
within the laft 30 years, above four 5ths of the arable land be- 
ing already inclofed, and the remainder in the near profpect 
of being fo. The fences are partly ftone walls teethed with 
lime, partly ditches, with thorn hedges on the top, which 
thrive pretty well. The quantity of ground, laid out under 
the different crops, cannot be exaftly afcertained, but the fol- 
lowing is nearly the average of the arable land. Under clover 
and rye-grafs one 5th, wheat one 10th, barley one 5th, oats 
one 4th, peafe one 5th, turnips one 10th, potatoes one 8th, flax 
one loth, and, in field cabbage, a few falls of ground *; befides 
about one 4 th kept in pafture. There is no common, even the 
moor land being exactly divided among the different proprie- 
tors Within thefe 2 years there has been more than ufual 
attention paid to the growth of flax, feveral acres being an- 
nually laid out in that way, by perfons who make it their 
buiinefs to attend to it during fummer. The produce, even 
when the crop is but indifferent, is fully adequate to the con- 
sumption of the inhabitants. When plentiful, it is exported 
in confiderable quantities. Barley is fent to Culrofs, Borrow- 
Hownnefs, Alloa, and Dunfermline, where » is manufactur- 
ed into*nalt. Med and potatoes are alfo fent to Dunferm-

donation bequeathed to the kirk-feffion of Carnock, by the 
Reverend Principal Row, who, being a native of this parifli, 
left this as a fmall teftimony of his regard for the place of his 
birth. The fcheolmafter's whole income may be calculated 
to amount to 151. 6s. 8d. Sterling ; a fum by far too fmall, 
in the prefent expenfive age, to oompenfate any man of let- 
ters and genius, for executing the laborious talk of teaching 
youth. 

Poor, — Though the number of poor upon our ordinary lift 
\s at prefent only 15, yet, upon an average of 10 years, it 
appears to have been not lefs than 18 annually. To thefe 
there are 6 diftributions made in the year, befides occasional 
fupplies to others, whofe neceffities, occafioned by temporary 
indifpolition, or fudden calamities, require charitable aid. 
For thefe purpofes, there are 4 quarterly diftributions made, 
in February, May, Auguft, and November ; befides 2 extra- 
ordinary meetings, viz. one about the beginning of the year, 
and another at one of the occafions of difpenfing the Lord's 
Supper, as that ordinance is celebrated twice a-year in this 
parifli. Sometimes, however, that coincides with one of our 
quarterly meetings, which is confidered by the kirk-feffion, 
and feveral of the quotas are increafed in proportion. The 
funds for the fupport of the poor are as follows ;

* The ftate of this parifh, in 1783 and 1783, merits particular attention, at 
extraordinary exertions were made on thefe occafions for the fupport of the 
poor, who would othcrwife have been in very deplorable circumftances. At the 
defire of fcveral of the proprietors, a meeting was called, on the 31ft of De- 
cember 1781, of the heritors and kirk-feffion conjunctly, when it was agreed, 
that an affeffment of the 10th part of the valued rent fliould be levied. This 
was accordingly done, and 61- being taken from the poor's funds, and feveral 
private voluntary donations added to it, the fum of 30I. Sterling was raifed, 
with which meal was bought at the market price, and fold to the poor at the 
reduced prices of is. per peck for the oat meal, and 8d. per peck for the bear 
and peafe meal. This falc continued for 8 morths, from the 18th of January to 
the 19th of September 1783, when the meal fell to the prices above-mentioned; 
and, upon calculating the fum total of expenditure, it appeared that about a 4 ». 
Sterling had been laid out for that benevolent purpofe. On that occafion, too,

Heritors and Rents.- There are 7 gtcat proprietors in this 
frrilh, who pay ftipend and all public burdens ; befides one 
frnall fetter, who pays only a trifle of vicarage, one large feu- 
er, who pays no ftipend, and a great number of others, who 
have no other property but their houfes, and a fmall fpot of 
ground (often lefs than an acre) adjoining to each. Iheir 
number is, therefore, uncertain and variable. The landed 
property (including that of the whole bf thefe feuers) may- 
be eftimated at about Iiooi; per annum*. In this fum is 
included the rent of the feffion houfes on the feveral eftates j 
and the rents of the gentlemens houfes, inhabited or habit- 
able, within the pariih, may be computed at 50I. more. 
The beft arable land lets at about ics. per acre ; in- 
ferior grounds at 10s. us. and 15s. Pafture lands let 
at from 5 s. to 71. 6d. The average rent of farms is a- 
bout 70I. a-year, none of them being very large, few indeed 
exceeding too acres, and fome being much lefs. The fize of 
farms, however, and confequently the rents, are upon the in- 
creafe ; the greater part of the arable land being now enclof- 
ed, as both proprietors and tenants feem convinced of the ad- 
vantage of enclofures.

the kirk.feffion were more liberal than ufual hi their diftributibns; and our pi- 
tron and principal heritor evidenced his liberality by giving two Guineas to the 
poor in May 1781, and three more in December, befides his proportion of the 
affeffment, which amounted to upwards of feven Guineas. By thefe means,' 
under the blefiing of God, the poor of this parUh were provided for, and not on- 
ly prevented from rioting and mobbing, but pretty comfortably fupported, till 
the return of plenty fuperfeded any farther demands upon the generofity of the 
public. 

* Landed property has not been very fluduating in thi pariih, none having 
been difpofed of within thefe. 20 years, except the eftates of the Clune and tk- 
Camps ; which, it is faid, were fold St about $J years purchafa.

*W.— There is a fmall quantity of mofs in the S. E. part 
Of the panfh, from which a few peats are dug, but thefe are 
folely appropriated to the kindling of fires, coals being the 
only fuel ufed in this diftricl, as they abound both in this 
parifli and in the neighbourhood. The average price of great 
• coal is as. 6d. for 40 ftones, and, for the fame quantity of 
chows, or fmall coal, is. 3d. The carriage paid for a fmgle 
horfe cart of coals is 4 d. per mile. But here it will be pro- 
per to give a particular account of the coal mines on the dif- 
ferent eftates in this parilh. 

Blair Colliery.- -There are two veins of coal, the one 4 and 
the other 7 feet thick ; both of which have been wrought 
fome years, and are ftill working. They are of a ftoney qua- 
lity, and emit a very confiderable heat when ufed as houfe 
fuel. They are fold at is. 3d. per cart (of 40 ftones weight), 
exclufive of carriage. The fmall coal has been found to 
anfwer well for burning lime, and for falt-works. Under 
thefe two veins of coal there are other two ; the one 2 feet 
10 inches, and the other 3 feet thick. The former is a fplint 
coal, the latter a fmithy coal of a good quality. Of thefe two 
veins only a fmall part has yet been wrought, as they are 
under level. Preparations, however, are now making for 
working both *. 

Merrylees Colliery :.• — This coal-work is the property of Mr, 
Mutter of Annfield, and has been wrought to a confiderable 
extent for thefe 8 years pall. The laft leafe taken of it was 
at the rent of lool. Sterling, and a fteam engine was erefted 

for

tot draining it. There are many veins of this coal, feveral 
feet thick, partly above level and partly below It is princx- 
pally ufed for drying corn and malt for the mills, for winch 
it feems peculiarly well qualified, as the grain, dried by it, 
does not receive the fmalleft tinge, but is rather fairer after 
the operation than before it. But the moft valuable, as well 
as lingular property of this coal, is, that grain or malt dried 
ty it is proof againft the depredations of the weevil, and all 
other fmall vermin. And it is even faid to be afcertained, 
by repeated experiments, that if only a part of the grain be 
dried with this coal, and mixed with other grain, the Vermin 
among the grain not dried with it will be deftroyed :— So 
powerful are its effeds in deftroying thofe pernicious animals, 
without communicating any quality to the corn, in the fmall- 
eil degree prejudicial to the health of man. On thefe ac- 
counts this coal is of confiderable ufe to maltfters and corn- 
dealers. When there is a great demand, it is Hupped at Tor- 
ry pier, oppofite to Borrowftownnefs, where veffels are load- 
ed with the greater! difpatch. 

Whinny-hill Colliery This coal belongs to Sir John 

Halkett of Pitfirran, and has the fame qualities with that of 
Merrylees, as the two collieries are fituated very near each 
other, and are feparated only by a fmall rivulet, which forms 
the march, or boundary between the two eftates. This coal 
is at prefent (May 1791) wrought to a confiderable extent, 
and is delivered at Torry pier, and put on Ihip-board, car- 
riage free, at 30s. per chaldron. Notwithftanding the great 
abundance of coals, there are no coal waggons in the parifli. 



Roads The fituation of this parilh is upon the whole ad- 
vantageous j but the inhabitants labour under one great in-

convenience from the badnefs of the roads. In fummer the* 
-e tolerab e, but m winter, or during a long courfe of rainy 
-eathcr, they are hardly paffable, owing to the foftnefs of 
the foil, and the great number of heavy carriages. It is hop- 
ed, however, that this inconvenience will foon be remedied 
by a proper application, or reafonable commutation of the 
ftatute labour, as well as by the eredion of turnpike roads - 
the advantages of which, being already felt in fome of the 
neighbouring diftfids, are now more generally acknowledged 
than formerly. 

Ltns andAle.hoUfes There are about 10 fmall inns and 

ale-houfes in the parifh, viz 4 in Carnock, 5 in Caimy-hill, 
and 1 in Blair. Although thefe, as well as moft other ac- 
commodations, and enjoyments in life, are and may be abuf- 
ed to the purpofes of intemperance, yet it muft be admitted 
that feveral houfes of this kind are neceffary in country pa- 
rifhes, for the convenience of travellers, and the accommoda- 
tion of the people who come from a diftance, to attend public 
worfhip on the Sabbath day. Perhaps, however, the number 
at prefent in this parifh might be diminifhed, without any 
great inconvenience, or rather, probably, with advantage to 
the inhabitants. 

tloufes and Cottages, &amp;c Within thefe 10 years, about 

2.0 new houfes have been built in different parts of the pa- 
rim. Scarce any have been pulled down, except fome cot- 
tages belonging to the colliers, who frequently move from 1 
one colliery to another ; and the habitations being flight and 
fuperficial foon go to ruin. Two or three huts, poffeffed by 
fmall tenants, have alfo become ruinous, but the number of 
cottages erefted within that period greatly counterbalances

jhern ; a very confiderable number of cottagers, being cm- 
ployed as day-labourers, from the villages of Carnock and 
Cairny-hill. The employing of cottagers has been found 
preferable to the hiring of fervants, being equally cheap and 
far lefs troublefome *. It is a fad, that improvements, pro. 
fecuted in this manner, on feveral of the neighbouring eftates 
have turned out to good account. And it may be added, that 
thofe gentlemen who thus employ the inferior ranks, do the 
moft effential fervice to their eountry, by not only beautify- 
ing and enriching the ground, but, at the fame time, giving 
encouragement to population and honeft induftry. 

Improvements. — Within thefe lafl 16 years there have been 
planted in the lands of Blair above 130,000 foreft trees, part- 
ly firs of different kinds, and partly hard wood. There 
are two parks on Carneil-Hill, in high cultivation, mak- 
ing about 100 acres between them. About five or fix bolls 
of lime (mixed with dung or compoft), are ufed for an acre. 
In the land of Clune, about 50 or 60 bolls of lime were ufed 
for an acre, when firft taken in from moor. Lime being 

plentiful, 



* Day-labourers generally get is. per clay in fummer and iod. in winter, with- 
out maintenance. Men fervants receive from 61. to 7I., and women from stL. 
10s. to 3I. Sterling, befuks their board. The expence of a common labouier 
and his family may be eftimated at from 15I. to 18I. per annum, which is de- 
frayed by the united induftry of the parents and their children, from the time 
they are able to do any thing. The wages of a day-labourer will be about 14L 
Sterling a-year of clear gain, at an average. At hay-making the men get iod. 
and the women i&amp;. Male reapers during harveft get rod. per day, and female*

may be added, that the wages of tradefmen are in proportion ; as houfe -carpent-

plentiful, there is no demand for marl, though fome of the 
latter has been dug from the mofs in the S. E. part of the 
parifli. The farm of Carneil was all enclofed fince 1761, and 
likewife the Clfne farm fince 1757 ; the former being done 
by Mr. Colvill, the prefent farmer, and the latter by Mr. 
Chalmers, the late proprietor of thefe lands. 

language. — That the Gaelic or Erfe was the ancient lan- 
guage of this part of the country, is evident from the names 
©f raoft places in the parifli ; fuch as Carnock, Lufcar, Clune, 
Blair, Pitdenny, Carneil, &amp;c; though others, indeed, of later 
date, are clearly of modern derivation ; fuch as Bonny-Town, 
Herd-Hill, Gowk-Hall, Wood-End, &amp;c. The language now 
generally fpoken in this diftridt, is the broad Scotch diale6t, 
with the Fifefliire accent, which gives fome words fo peculiar 
a turn, as to render the fpeaker almoft unintelligible to the 
natives of a different county, 

Eminent Men.— Under this head, we can only enume- 
rate as natives of this parifli, or refidents in it, the Rev. 
John Row, above mentioned, (whofe father was minifter 
of it in the beginning and middle of lafl. century, and) who 
was promoted to be principal of King's College in Aber- 
deen ; and the late Mr. John Erskine of Carnock, profef- 
for of municipal law in the college of Edinburgh, and 
author of the larger and lefler Infiitutes of the Law of 
Scotland. Of Mr. Erlkine's abilities we need fay nothing. 
His eminence as a lawyer is univerfally known. He refided 
at his houfe of Newbigging, in this parifli, during the fum- 
mer feafon, for upwards of 30 years ; but at laft removed to 
Cardrofs, in Monteith, where he died in the year 1767, hav- 
ing, fome years before that, purchafed confiderable property 
4 there, 



of Carnock,

there, which is now poffeffed by his fecond fori, James 
Erskine, Efq. of Cardrofs. 

Antiquities.— -Of thefe we cannot boaft that we have many. 
There feems to have been a camp a little S. from the village 
of Carnock, upon an eminence, which ftill retains the name 
of Camps ; and probably another, in fume remote period, up- 
on Carneil-hill. Both feem well adapted for that purpofe j 
the afcent being fteep and difficult upon two fides at leaft, 
and the profpect of the adjacent country noble and extenfive 
from the fummits. Upon opening a cairn upon Carneil-hill, 
about 20 years ago, there was found an urn of earthen ware, 
containing foroe fmall copper coins, but they had no infcrip- 
tion which could be read by thofe into whofe hands they 
came. There are evidently the remains of a camp (probably 
one of the Roman Cajlra ftativa), upon Craig-Lufcar Hill, in 
the parifh of Dunfermline, adjoining to the N. E. boundary 
of ours. — We have no barrows or tumuli, certainly known as 
artificial. There are indeed fome Knows, or fmall eminences, 
as the Knows of Lufcar, and the Law K?iov3 adjoining to Car- 
nock. From the name of the laft of thefe, we may be led to 
believe, that it was a place for affembling the vaffals and de- 
pendants round their fuperiors, in the days of the feudal fyf- 
tem, that differences might be decided and juftice a-dminifter- 
ed. Several of the hamlets preferve fome traces of thofe dif- 
tra&amp;ed times in the names they bear, as they feem to indi- 
cate war, confvfcn, and noife Among the antiquities of 

Carnock may alfo be mentioned an ancient crofs, in the 
middle of the northern divifion of the village. This crofs is 
of a circular form, containing fix rounds of (tone fleps, rifing 
one above another, and gradually dirninilhing in diameter as 
they afcend. In the middle grows a venerable thorn tree,

which was, even within thefe few years, covered wish leaves 
and bloffoms in fummer ; but is now much decayed. It is 
called the Thome in our feffion records ; about the middle of 
the laft century; and is probably about 200 years old. 

Ink Craig — The Ink Craig of Carnock, adjoining to the 
Dam Dike, deferves to be mentioned as a curiofity. It produces 
a liquid, refembling ink, which drops almoft conftantly from 
the rock, A chemical analyfis was made of this liquid, by 
the ingenious Dr. Black, when it was found to contain a 
mixture of coal, flinty earth, and clay. 

Stature, CharaSlcr, and Manner of Living. — The natives? 
of this parifb have nothing remarkable in their fize or ftrength : 
neither are they difcriminated from their countrymen by any 
ptecifliar qualities of the mind. Their fize is generally be- 
tween 5 and 6 feet ; and fcarce any one has been known to 
exceed 6^. A laudable fpirit of induftry prevails much 
among the inferior claffes. The men are movtly occupied in 
hufbandry, and the women in fpinning, fewing, knitting' 
llockings, &amp;c. There are very few who incline to go to fea, 
though fame are engaged at the ports- on die Frith. The na- 
tives are equally averfe to the land fervice ; not above 9 or 
10 having inlifbed in the army thefe many years j and of 
thefe, 1 or 3 only of late. In point of benevolence,, it is 
but juftice to fay, that the people of this parifh are at lead 
upon a par with their countrymen in the neighbouring dif- 
fricls ; and in times of extraordinary fcarcity, exertions have 
been made by many individuals in behalf of the diftrefied, 
•which did honour to their feelings. The common people

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q773613">CHANEL OF GARIOQH</name>. 
(County and Synod of Aberdeen— Prejbytery of Garioch.') 
By the Rev. Mr. John Shand, Minifter,</head> 



<p>Name and EreElion. 

FTpHE ancient name of this parifli was Logie-Durno, or 
JL Dumoch\, which fignifies a low or holloiu place. The 
church was transferred from Logie Durno, on the N. fide of 
the water of Ury, to its prefent fituation, at the E. end of 
the hill of Bannochie, early in the 17th century ; at which 
period the parfonage of Fetterneer, lying on the N. fide of 
the river Don, was annexed to the parifh, which was then 
appointed to be called Chapel of Garioch, in a decree refpecT:- 
ing the llipend obtained about that time. It is the feat of the 
prefbytery of Garioch. 

Rivers, Form, Extent, Soil, Climate, &amp;c. — The river Don 
divides it, on the S. fide, from the parilh of Kernnay, and is 
the boundary between them for about a miles. The parifli 

' is 

f Hence, probably, the origin of Dornock in Sutherland, and Dornick in 
Dumfiies-fliire. 



of Chapel of Garioch. $ol 



is of a very irregular figure : Its greateft extent, from N. to 
S„ is about 8 miles; and from E. to W., about 7. The ap- 
pearance of the country is hilly. The foil is of various qua- 
litiss ; in general, it is very improvable. The air is fuffi- 
ciently dry and healthy. The W. end of the parifh is indeed 
fubjeded to frequent mowers, from its vicinity to the hill of 
Bannochie. There are no diftempers peculiar to the panfh ; 
the mod prevalent are fevers and rheumatifm. The water of 
Ury runs through the pariih for feveral miles. It abounds 
with fine trout. Pike is alfo to be found in fome of the pools i - 
but no falmon, excepting in the fpawning feafon. 

Woods, Agriculture, and Produce,' &amp;c— .Trees of all kinds 
thrive well; and there are plantations, of confiderable extent, on 
the eftates of Logie, Pittodrie, Balquhain, and on the lands 
of Afforjl, belonging to Sir Archibald Grant, in the parifli. 
It would be highly beneficial to this part of the country, that 
trees were more cultivated than they are. A great deal of 
ground in this parifh is fit only for planting. Wood has, of 
late, become much more fcarce in this di drift than formerly, 
and has of confequence rifen greatly in value. The number 
of acres is not afcertained. The greater part of the arable 
land is employed in raifing oats and bear. Some of the farms 
are of confiderable extent, and will fow between 50 and: 60 
bolls of grain. There are few enclofures in the parifh, ex- 
cepting upon the farms in the poffeffion of the proprietors ; 
confequently fown grafs or turnips cannot be much culti- 
vated *.

much efteemed, as being hardy, large boned, and well ihaped. 
The number of cattle amounts to 859, of flieep 1550, of

17S8 and 1789. The prefent ftipehd is 49I. 13s. 4d. Sterling

money; alfo 4 1. 15s. of intereft, and 10I. Sterling, mortified 
by Dr. Anderson, late of St. Chriftophers, a native of this 
parifli. 

Roads and Inns.— The roads in the parifli are made and re- 
paired by the ftatute labour, which is, in general, very fuper- 
ficially performed. The road from Aberdeen to Invernefa 
paiTes through the parifli for about 7 miles, and is often, in, 
many places, almoft impaffable. The crofs roads are numer- 
ous, and very bad in winter.— There are 3 public houfes in 
the parilh ; 2 of them on the road to Invernefs, and the other 
On the road that leads to the upper part of Garioch. 

Difadvantages.— The people feem to be fenfible of the be- 
nefit of enclofures and green crops ; but they labour under 
many difadvantages. They are far from the means of im- 
provement : Their leafes, in general, are ftiort : The mill 
multures are either an abft rafted thirlage, or amount to the 
loth or nth part of the whole produce of the farm. Mr. 
Horn of Logie, and fome others of the heritors, are convinced 
Of the impolicy of this tax, and its hurtful effects upon im- 
provements, and are taking every ftep in their power to re- 
medy the grievance. Among the difadvantages of the parifli, 
may alfo be reckoned the difficulty of procuring fuel. A 
confiderable number of the parilhioners go to the hill of Ban- 
ilo&amp;faie far their peats, by a very fteep road, which, in a rainy 

feafon, 



504 Stati/ticpl Account 

feafon, is impaffable, The -diftance from lime is alfo a great 
difadvantage. Indications of limertone appear on the eftate 
of Pittodrie ; which is to be particularly examined by Colonel 
Knight the proprietor ; and if it fucceed upon trial, it will 
be of great benefit to this part of the country. Perfonal fer- 
vices are not abolilhed in this parifh, and are confidered as 
a great bar to improvement. The wages of fervaftts are alfo 
increafed beyond what the tenants can bear. A ploughman, 
who was formerly fatisfied with 3 1. in the year, now demands 
7].; and" the wages of other fervants have rifen in the fame 
proportion. 

Antiquities, Echo, \Sc — There is a Druidical temple near 
the old ruinous caftle of Balquhain. From this caftle there 
is one of the fined echos in Scotland. There is a large ftonc, 
about half a mile W. from the church, which is about 10 feet 
high above ground, 4 feet broad, and a foot thick ; it is called 
the Maiden Stone. There are feveral curious hierogryphical 
figures cut upon it, which are defcribed in Pennant's Tour, 
and an elegant plate of them given.. The bloody battle of 
Harlaw * was fought in this parifh. 

NUM. 



* This battle was fought in the year 14I1, between Alexander Earl of Marr» 
who eominanded the royal army, and Donald Lord of the Ifles. It proved fatal 
to a great number of the nobility and gentry of that age, being cibftinately con- 
tended on both fides. Buchanan fays, that night feparated the combatants, n- 
ther wearied with fighting, than from any idea that either had gained the bat- 
tle ; for when each army reviewed the number of their flain, they confidered 
themfclves as vanquifhed. In this battle, more men of rank and fame loft their 
lives, than had fallen in any foreign engagement for many years preceding, by 
whigh this obfeure village was rendered memorable to pofterity.

PARISH OF IN <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q15059179">VERKEITHN Y</name>. 

(County of Banff— Synod 'of Aberdeen— Prejbytery of 'Turriff.) 
By the Rev. Mr. John Milne, Minifter*</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, River, and Extent. 

A Very large burn, or rivulet, which comes through 
the parilhes of Drumblade and Forgue, falls into the 
river Deveron, near the church, from which it is probable the 
parifh derives the name of Inverkeithny. The parifh is fitu- 
ated on the S. fide of the river, and is in the commifTariot of 
Moray. It is in length, along the river fide, from 5 to 6 
Englilh miles, and between 4 and 5 in breadth. 

Produce and Rent. — A confiderable quantity of grain is 
annually raifed in the parifh. The rent is fully 900I. Ster- 
ling. 



Fuel.— There is fcarcely any thing in the parifh, that can be

called mofs or peats. The inhabitants are fupplied with peats 
from the moffes of Foudland, in the parifh of Forgue, and of 
Auchintoul, in the parifh of Marnoch. They alfo burn a kind 
of turf, which they get upon the hills. Banff is the nearefl 
fea-port where coals can be got, which is about 12 Englifh 
miles diftant from the church. 

Ecchfiajiical Matters — The church and manfe are fituated 
in a narrow valley, near the bank of the Deveron. The pa- 
rifh formerly belonged to the Synod of Moray and Prefby- 
tery of Huntly. An exchange was made with the parifh of 
Mortlich, which originally was in the Synod of Aberdeen 
and Prefbytery of Turriff, and the minifter of Inverkeithny 
ftill draws 6s. 8d. Sterling as the feu-duty of a houfe in El- 
gin, which has, probably, been one [of the flails in the ca- 
thedral at Elgin. There are no diffenters from the Eftablifh- 
ed Church, except a few members of theEpifcopal Church of 
Scotland. 

Population.— -The population of Inverkeithny has decreafed 
confiderably within thefe 20 years. This has been partly oc- 
cafioned by the fcarcity of fuel, but chiefly by the farmers 
thinking, from the high prices obtained for cattle and grain, 
that they had more profit, by cultivating their farms them- 
felves, than by fubfetting a confiderable part of them, as was 
formerly done in all the northern parts of Scotland-

{County and Prejbytery of Elgin Synod of Moray.) 

By the Rev. Mr. William M'Bean, Minifter.</head> 



<p>Extent, Surface, Soil, and Climate. 

THE parifh of Alves is about 5 Englifti miles in length, 
and nearly the fame in breadth. The Moray Frith 
walhes its coaft on the N. The face of the country prefents 
a moft agreeable mixture of hill and dale ; and the planta- 
tions lately made by the Earl of Moray, will, in a (borr time, 
add not a little to its beauty. The foil is dtftinguifhed for 
its fertility, being generally a deep loam on a clayey bottom ; 
though, in a few phces, it is of a lighter quality. From the 
nature of the foil, the crops are rather late; but from the 
happy climate of the county of Moray, this is attended with 
no material inconvenience to the farmer. 

Cultivation and Produce.— The tenants are very induftrious, 
and their labours are amply rewarded by excellent crops. 
For centuries paft, they have raifed wheat ; and, until lately, 

a 



of /lives, 509 

l d onfiderable proportion of their rents was paid to the Earl of 
Mor-iy in that grain. This his Lordfhip has now converted 
into money, as the tenants found it more advantageous to 
cultivate barley : But wheat is Mil fown, though not to &amp; 
great an extent. They are now making a rapid progrefs id 
the modern ftyle of agriculture. Graf, feeds are laid down 
on a large fcale. Beans are planted in drills. Many acre, 
of turnips are fown both in drills, and in the broad call way, 
with great fuccefs. Potatoes are alio raifed in very confut- 
able quantities, both by the plough and fpade. The general 
fuceeffion of crops is three plowings for barley ; the firft m 
autumn, the fecond, after dunging, in April, and a feed 
furrow in the beginning of May. The fucceeding crop is 
commonly oats, if grafs feeds are not laid down with the bar- 
ley. Occafionally, grafs feeds, are laid down with the oats j 
and, when that is not the cafe, the following crop is peafe, 
and barley with grafs feeds thereafter, TRe oats, that grow- 
in Alves, are about a fortnight later in ripening than thofe 
produced in- the neighbourhood, and therefore are in requeft 
for feed in the light and fandy grounds in this country, and, 
on trial, are found to produce an excellent quality of grain, 
and fuperior quantity of fodder. 

Leafes. — It would be of material confequence to the in- 
tereft, both of proprietors and farmers all over Scotland, but 
efperially in this corner, that long leafes were introduced. 
They would animate the farmers to fuperior induftry and pro- 
fitable fpeculation, as they would afcertain to them the fruits 
of their induftry, and prevent their having recourfe to ex- 
haufting crops, under the apprehenfion of being foon remov- 
ed. It is with pleafure that the writer of this article can 
add, that in this parilh, u^on Lord Moray's property, there

Ploughs, Cattle, &amp;c._The number of ploughs in this pa- 
rifh may be Hated at 115 : the number of horfes at 560 ■ 
moll of them' are bf a pretty large fize, and fo ftout, that J 
of them draw a plough. The number of black cattle is about 
1 1 00. The tattle are not now fo numerous as they were 
formerly, but confiderably increafed in fize, from their being 
fed with artificial graffes and turnips. The number of fceep 
is about 2500. They are of a very fmall fize, excepting a 
few of the large Bakewell breed; 

Prices bf Labour — The price of labour is confiderably ad- 
vanced within thefe few years. The wages of men fervants, 
employed in hufbandry, are from 61. to 81. when they live in 
the family, and 2 pecks of meal in the week when they do 
not. W omen fervants have generally from 30s. to 40s. per 
annum, with fome perquifites. The wages paid to reapers* 
during harveft, are from 18s. to il. 10s. They are gene- 
rally hired for the feafon, except in thofe cafes when the farm- 
ers have cottagers : To cut down their corn is a part of their 
Hated labour ; and, for this and other fervices, the cottagers 
have a free houfe and a garden.

* It is a circurhftance that deferves particular notice^ as it points out what 
induftry and a fteady economy can produce, and at the fame time proves the 
laudable foftering care and attention of fome proprietors, that a family, of the 
name of Anderson, have occupied a farm in this pariflj, on the eftate of the 
Earl of Moray, for upwards of 4*0 years. The prefent tenant, having produced 
to the late Earl of Moray receipts for rents as far back as the time of Earl 
Randolph, obtained from his Lordfliip a renewal of his leafe on the moft indul- 
gent terms.

Minerals, Fuel, Inns, tfc — The E. end of the parifh a- 
bounds with inexhauftible quarries of excellent freeftone, 
very fit for either building or mill-ftones.— This parifh was 
once abundantly accommodated with peats for fuel ; but the 
moffes are now almoft exhaufled, and many of the country 
people are neceffitated to purchafe coals.— There is but one 
inn or public houfe in the parifh. It lies on the county road 
from Elgin to Forres, which paffes through Alves. 

Heritors and Rent. — The heritors are, the Earl of Moray; 
the Earl of Fife ; William Brodie of Windyhills, Efq.; Peter 
Rofe Watfon of Callfield, Efq.; Mifs Brodie of Lethen ; Joha 
Spence Munro of Kirktown, Efq.; and George Forteath of 

Newton, Efq two of whom only have their refidence in 

the parifh. It is not pretended to give an accurate flatement 
of the real rent, as that mull depend upon the price of grain ; 
but, at an average, it may be eflimated at upwards of 3000I. 
Sterliog per annum. Land, in general, here lets at from 20s. 
to 30s. per Scotch acre. The rents are paid, partly in mo- 
ney, and partly in grain ; that is, oats, at 5 firlots per boll, 
and barley. 

Population * — By every information, the population of 
this parifh is very confiderably diminifhed. This is flill far-

Church, School, and Poor. — The Earl of Moray is patron 
of the pariih of Alves. A new and fubftantial church was 
built in the year 1769. The manfe is faid to have been built 
in the year 1690, and has fmce undergone frequent repairs. 
The ftipend is 80 bolls of barley, 300I. Scotch, with 60 merks 
for communion elements. The fdlary of the fchoolmaiter is 
10 bolls of bear, and 33I. 6s. 8d. Scotch. The quarterly 
payment for reading is is., for reading and arithmetic is. 6d., 
and for Latin as. The fchoolmafter is always feffion-clerk, 
for which he has a falary of il. 12s. per annum, together 
pith the cafual perquifites arifing from the regiftration of bap- 
tifms and marriages. In the year 1715, George Duncan, 
late merchant in Invernefs, mortified (funk) 3000 merks for the 
benefit of this fchool ; the intereft of which is applied to the 
education of 6 boys, not above 10 years of age, each of them 
enjoying this tor 4 years. Thefe burfars are named by the 
minifter and kirk-feffion — The funds, for the fupport of the 
■poor, arife from the weekly collections, fines from delin- 
quents, mortcloth dues, and fome mortifications. The late 
Rev. Mr. Alexander Watt, who was once incumbent at 
Alves, and died minifter of Forres, mortified the principal 
turn of 30I. Sterling, for behoof of the poor of this parilli. 
Thefe funds afford a comfortable relief to our poor, who are 
not very numerous.

Antiquities Under the head of antiquities, there is little 

that deferves notice, but a prodigioufly large cairn of ftones, 
in a moor on the N. fide of the poft or county road, where 
tradition fays a battle was fought ; but .no circumftances are 
handed down concerning it. Some Lochaber and Danilh 
axes, of a particular figure, have been dug out of the mofs of 
Earnfidej in the neighbourhood of this cairn. An inferip- 
tion on a grave-ftone in the church-yard, dated in the year 
1590, records a very uncommon circumftance. It runs thus: 
" Here lies Anderson of Pittenfere, maire of the earldom of 
*• Moray, with his wife Marjory, whilk him never difplicit." 

Character of the People. — The people, in general, are very 
fober and induftrious, regular in their attendance upon public 
worfhip, and fully equal to their neighbours in point of 
knowledge and information. They have lately acquired a 
tafte for greater neatnefs in their houfes, furniture and drefs, 
than formerly prevailed.

W Andrew, bifhop of Glafgow, anno l 4 S9 *• About a mile 
from the prefent church there is a farm, the property of S»r 
James Johnftone, but which formerly belonged to the family 
of Glendonwyn, called Wefterker, from which the panfk 
feems to hare got its name; and this conjedure is the more 
probable, that, on a neck of land between the Elk and the 
Megget, and part of the farm of Wefterker, there are feveral 
large whin or moor ftones placed in the ground eredly, 
which are evidently the remains of a Druidical temple. The 
parifh of Wefterker might, in procefs of time, be named 
Wefterkirk, from the circumftance of its being the mod west- 
erly of the five kirks of Efkdale, commonly fo called, viz. 
Cannohie, Wauchope, Ewes, Staplegordone, and Wefterkirk ; of 
the laft of which the prefent parifh of Eftdalemuir was a 
part, till the year 1703, when it was ere&amp;ed into a feparate 
eftablifhment. The farm of Weferker, from which the parifb, 
is fuppofed to have got its name, was probably fo called from 
its vicinity to, and its fituation in refpeft of an ancient build- 
ing in the neighbourhood. There are vefliges of a caftle on 
the farm of Crooks, a great part of which was {landing in 
the memory of many of the prefent inhabitants. Caer, in the 
Gaelic language, fignifies caftle, and Wefier-caer, or Wefter- 
ker, muft mean a place to the weft of the caftle ; and the farm 
of Wefterker feems to have been fo called, becaufe it lies a- 
long the W. fide of the Megget, oppofue to, and diftant not 
more than a furlongs from the place where the caftle former- 
ly ftood. 

Extent. — The length of the parifh, from the N. to the E. ex- 
tremities, is 9 miles ; but as the boundaries on the N. and S. are 
generally regulated by the water falls, or ridges of the moun-

EflTl ?\ dwdes " «ro» pari^es of Langholm and 
Efcddemwr, the breadth, at an average, does not exceed a 
Wiles ; whereas between the church, which is nearly in the 
centre, and the N, W. end of the parifh, the breadth, in fome 
places, is little Ihort of its length. Though the length on the 
5. exceeds, by a miles, that on the N. bank of the Elk, yet 
as Wefterkirk extends a great way among the hills to the 
northward, till it reaches the boundaries of Tiviotdale, two 
thirds of the parilh, or thereabouts, are fituated on the N. 
fide of the river. The parifh confifts of 27,307 acres ; but 
not more, perhaps, than a twentieth part of it arable. 

Surface, Soil, and Climate.—Tht appearance of the country 
is hilly ; and the hills in general are high, Some of them 
are covered with heath, but they are moltly green and dry 

and afford excellent pafture for fheep. The foil is various • 

the lower grounds along the banks of the Elk, which are flat, 
confift. in general of a light loam, and produce plentiful crops 
when under proper management: The foil on the riling 
grounds is a deep ftrong loam, interfperfed with Hones ; and 
the tops of many of the hills are covered with mofs.— The 
climate is not unhealthy, though fomewhat moift, as the hills 
cn the S. fide of the parilh are among the firft that intercept: 
the clouds, in their progrefs northward, from the Irifh fea and 
the Solway Frith. 

Rivers. — The Black Eft, dividing the parifli of Wellerkiik 
on the S. from that of Elkdalemuir on the N.^ for about a 
mile in length, falls into the white Ejk at a place named the 
King Pool*, in the neighbourhood of the farm houfe of Bailie- 

4 hill.

in attempting to pafs over the ice, from which circumftance it got the name of

jiill. From the confluence of the Elks, the river, by a va- 
riety of beautiful curves, runs through the parifh toward the 
g. E. for th« fpace of 7 miles, till it reaches Dowglen-cleugh,; 
and then paffes along the N. fide of the parifh, nearly in the 
fame direaion, till it reaches a place named Craig-cleugh ; a 
rivulet which divides the parilh from that of Langholm ojj 
the S., as Dowglen-cleugh does on the N. fide of the Elk. 
Many burns, or rivulets, fall into the Elk within the bounds 
of the parilh. From the hills on the S. fide of the river there 
are 13, and from thofe on the N. 9, befides the Megget and 
Stennis water. In the S. fide of a ridge of mountains, the 
fummits of which are the line of divifion between the county 
of Dumfries, in this direction, and that of Roxburgh or Ti- 
vietdale, the Megget and Stennis water have their fources. 
They are divided in their courfes by a ridge of hills, and fad 
in their progress, with a variety of ftrearolets from the neigh- 
bouring mountains ; and running fouthward for 6 miles, the 
Stennis water, near a place named the Crooks, joins the Meg- 
get, which paffes on in the fame direction for about half a 
mile, and falls into the Elk in the neighbourhood of Wauk- 
mill. The Elk, the Megget, and the Stennis water abound 
wkh trout ; and falmon were alfo taken in the Elk in great 
numbers, till the late Dr. Graham of Netherbie built a bay 
acrofs the river, for the profeffed purpofe of procuring water 
for working the mills, which he was then erecting in the 
neighbourhood of Langtoun ; but fince that time fcarcely any 
falmon get up the Elk, excepting when it happens to be greatly 
flooded.

Agriculture, Produce fiattle,\3c Confiderable improvements 

have been made in agriculture fince the ufe of carts became 
general, and efpecially fince the year 1775, when abridge 
was thrown over the Elk at Langholm, by which means the 
tenants have eafy accefs to the lime-kilns in Cannobie. The 
principal crops are oats, barley, peafe, potatoes, fown grafs ; 
and wheat has fometimes been cultivated with fuccefs. Oats

are fown from the beginning of March to the ioth of April j 
peafe in the end of March or beginning of April ; barley is 
fown, and potatoes are planted, from the middle of April to 
the middle of May ; turnips are fown in June, and wheat in 
the end of Auguft or beginning of September. The harveft 
commences about the end of Auguft, and is generally con- 
cluded about the middle of Oaober. Clover and rye-grafs 
are almoit univerfally fown with barley, and the general ro* 
ution is as follows ; 

Years. 

I. Barley with clover arid rye-grafs* 
i. Clover and rye-grafs. 

3. Oats. 

4. Fallow, or turnips, or potatoes. 

With the fifth feed time the rotation begins anew, when" 
the land is again fowed with barley, together with clover and 
rye-grafs. Some take two crops of oats after the clover and 
rye-grafs, and others 3 ; and perhaps the fecond crop will be 
better than the firft, becaufe it is net fo apt to lodge when the 
feafon is wet. But in grounds, that are conflantly under til- 
lage, efpecially where the foil is light, this practice is very 
injurious to the tenant, becaufe it impoverifhes the land to 
fuch a degree, that it cannot be brought to produce a plentiful 
crop for feveral fucceeding feafons. There are 69 carts in 
the parilh, and 35 ploughs, which laft are generally of the 
Englifli form. There are 86 horfes, 181 cows, with their 
followers ; and a few black cattle are bred for the Englilh 
market.

thefe are all of the long or white faced kind, now known un-

der the name of the Cheviot breed. Every farmer difpofes of 
his whole lambs, excepting what he retains for keeping up 
his ftock, i. e. he referves as many of his belt ewe lambs,; 
when he fells the others in the month of July, as are equal to 
what of his flock had died fince the Michaelmas preceding^ 
and- the number of draught ewes which he intends to difpofe 
of in the September following: At this feafon, he difpofes yearly 
of fome of the oldeft and woift of his ewes. The number of 
draughts that he fells annually, is about a feventh part of the 
whole ; and therefore the oldeft of his flieep are not more 
than 7 years of age. A ewe 8 years old may be expected to 
bring a better lamb than when me was 4 or 5 ; but her fleece 
will be both coarfer and lighter, and me be in greater danger 
of dying during the winter or fpring. The lambs and draught 
ewes are generally fold into Northumberland and Yorkfliire. 
The fheep are falved about Martinmas. A gallon of tar,- 
mixed with a Scotch Hone of butter, will falve, of young and 
old throughout the flock, about 45. One man will falve 20 
flieep in a day. Of late years the farmers have been in ufe 
to buy tups of the Cheviot breed; and, by this improvement, 
the value of wool is fuppofed to be increafed at the rate of 
about as. 6d. per ftone. Till this feafon, the price of wool 
had increaftd thefe feveral years. Some of it fold, laft year, 
as high as 18s. a ftone: This year (1793), it is fallen about 
5s. a ftone. Eight fleeces, at an average, go to a ftone. 

Bridget and Roads — There are in the pari (h, to the great 
accommodation and fafety of travellers, 16 ftone bridges. 
Thefe, however, are moftly built on a fmall fcale ; none of 
them has more than one arch, excepting that which is over 
the Elk, in the neighbourhood of the church, and confifts of 
3 arches. This was built about 50 years ago, and at the ex-

pence of the county. Five of the bridges are thwwn over 
burns or rivulets, which fall into the Elk from the hills on the 
S., and 10 are built over'thofe that come from the mountains 
on the N. fide of the river. There are 2 public roads, which 
are kept in excellent repair, and run from the S. E. end of 
the pa'rifh; the one along the S., the other along the N. banks 
of the Elk, for about 6 miles. The road on the S. crolTss 
the river 2 miles above the church, and, on the N. fide of 
the E(k, joins the other, which is continued into the parifti 
of Elkdalemuir. Though fome of the bridges were built, 
and the roads were originally formed, and are Hill kept in re- 
pair, with money collected from the occupiers of land, in lieu 
of theftatute labour, in terms of an a£l of parliament obtained 
for this county, yet the public is much indebted, for the con- 
veniency of good roads and fufficient bridges, to the benevo- 
lent exertions of Sir James Johnstone. From him the pro- 
pofition firfl came to throw a bridge over the Elk, at Lang- 
holm, by which the inhabitants of Wefterkirk have ready 
accefs to the lime kills and coal pits of Cannobie ; and his 
attention is unremitted, while he refides in this part of the 
country, to the reparation of the roads and bridges. 

School and Poor. — The fchoolmafter's falary is lool. 
Scotch : The number of fcholars, at an average, is about 45 
in winter, and 25 in fummer. He receives, for teaching 
Englifh, per quarter, is. 6d ; for writing, 2s. 6d. ; for arith- 
metic, 3s. 6d ; and for Latin, 5s. As fefEon-clerk and pre- 
centor, he has 13s. from the feflaon ; on every marriage he has 
is., on every baptifm 4d., and 3d. on every certificate : Be- 
fidts, he is collector of the affeiTment for the poor, for which 
lie has il. ics. a Year. The office may be worth about 22I. 
Sterling per annum. The number of poor upon the roll at 
prefent is 18. The annual amount of the contributions for 

their

their relief is 57I. 6s. 4L Of the above affeffment, the fef- 
fion advances 7I. 5s. 5J. ; the reff is paid, one half by the 
heritors, and the other by the tenants. There is a fum cf 
160I. in frock, the intereft of which., at 4 per cent, together 
with the collections, the ufe of the mortcloth, and what fines 
or penalties are exaded from defaulters, enable the feffion, 
not only to advance more than an 8th part of the whole an- 
nual airelTment, but to provide clothing for feveral of the pau- 
pers, and to relieve fuch individuals as fall into circumftan- 
ces of diftrefs between the quarterly meetings. The number 
of poor upon the roll had increafed no more than 2 for 10 
years preceding Candlemas laft, whereas the affeffment was 
nearly doubled. 

The number of poor upon the roll in February 1783, was 17 
Ditto, in February 1793, - 19 

The quarterly affeffment, in Feb. 1783, was £. 7 15 ff 
Ditto, in Feb. 1793, - 14 6 7 

This rapid increafe of poor's rates may indeed be fomewhat 
alarming to thofe by whom the affeffment is paid. Trufting 
to thefe rates, individuals are net fo folicitous, perhaps, as 
they otherwife would be, to make provifion for a time of 
ficknefs, a feafon of dearth, or the indigence of old age ; and 
this mode of providing for the poor may ferve to leffen tkat 
attention to parents, and that defire to provide for their com- 
fortable fubfiftence, which are fo much the duty "of, and fo 
very becoming in children: On the other hand, fince this 
method of maintaining the paupers commenced, the parifh has 
not been much infefted with vagrants and fturdy beggars ; 
and the poor being thus provided for, live comfortably at 
home, and are not reduced to the neceffity of wandering up 
and down the country begging bread.

5-4 Staiiftkal Account 



Heritors, &amp;.C.— The property of the parim belongs, at pre- 
fect, to 4 heritors, viz. the Duke of Buccleugh, Sir James 
Johnftone, Bart. John Johnftone, Efq. and Major Dirora ; of 
whom Sir James Johnftone only refides, and that but oc- 
cafionajly. 

Ecdrfiajlical State — The manfe was rebuilt in 1783, and is 
in good repair ; The kirk in 1788, and it is one of the neateft 
and bell finiihed country churches in the fouth of Scotland. 
The ftipend was formerly 70I. 16s. 8d., including 4I. 3s. 4d. 
for communion elements ; but an augmentation of 4 chalders 
of victual, half meal, half barley, was obtained in February 
laft. The glebe conlifts of about 19 Engliih acres, which the 
prefent incumbent inclofed, and fubdivided with {tone fences, 
at an expence of not lefs than iool, Befides the glebe, the mi- 
nifter has a right of pafturage for 44 ftieep on the neighbour- 
ing farm of Hirtonhill. 

Prices of Labour, ifc — The wages of a man labourer are 
,55c!. a day without victuals, except when he is employed as a 
mower, and in the time of harveft, when they are iod. or 
when he is engaged in falving flieep, for which he receives is. 
The wages of wcmen are 8d. a day in harveft, with main- 
tainance, and 6d. at other times. The wages of a mafon are 
as., and thofe of a carpenter is. 6d. a day, when they find 
their own victuals. The wages of men fervants, who eat in 
the houfe, are from 8 to 10 guineas a year ; and thofe of wo- 
men, from 3I. 1 os. to 4 guineas. The ftiepherds are allowed 
grafs for a certain number of Iheep, as their wages. Some of 
them have a leifer, others a greater number, according to 
their ikill and the largenefs of the flock which they tend ; 
and the wages of fome of them of late years, owing to the

Minerals, bV.-There is a pit of excellent fliell marl* 
in the farm of Megdale, the property of the Duke of Buc- 
cleugh. Little of the marl, however, is ufed, becaufe it can- 
not be got for money, but mutt be afked as a favour ; and the 
tenant is naturally averfe to the tref P afs which horfes would 
occafion, by being brought upon his grounds to carry it off; 
befides the pit is fituated in the declivity of a hill, and by no 
means of eaiy accefs. Sir James JohnAone had, for more than 
30 years back, been in fearch of lead in the grounds of Glen- 
dinning. In the year 1788, metal was difcovered ; but, up- 
on trial, it was found to be antimony. Antimony, the Jubium 
of the ancients, by the Greeks called is found in Hun- 

gary, in Germany, in France, in Ruffia, and in Siberia ; but this 
is the only mine of antimony that has, as yet, been difcovered 
in Great Britain. The reafon of its modern denomination is 
referred to Bufd Valentine, a German monk, who, as the tra- 
dition relates, having thrown fome of it to the hogs, obferv- 
ed that, after it had purged them haftily, they immediately 
fattened ; and therefore imagined his fellow monks would be 
the better for a like dofe. The experiment, however, fuc- 
ceeded fo ill, that they all died of it ; and the medicine was 
henceforward called antimoine, antimonk f. Of the mines in 

the 



* About 50 years ago, one of the tenants of Glendinning X manured part of 
his arable land with marl from this pit. His neighbour did not make the ex- 
periment; and that part of the field on which the marl was laid, is diflinguifti- 
ed from the other, even to this day, by producing a more luxuriant crop.

the grounds of Glendinning, Sir James Johnftone retains two 
fourth mares. He has let one fourth fliare to Captain Cochran, 
and another to Mr. Tait. The company has built a fmelting 
houfe in the neighbourhood of the mines, in which the ore is 
manufadured. It is made into fulphurated antimony, and re. 
gulus of antimony. When the ore is beaten fmall, and waft- 
ed, it is put into an earthen pot, the bottom of which is per- 
forated with a number of holes. This pot is let into the 
mouth of another, which ferves as a receiver. They are then 
put into the furnace ; and feveral fets of this apparatus are 
commonly worked at once. The fluid antimony paffes through 
the holes into the underraoft pot, while the unfufible matters 
remain in the uppermoft : What is found in the undermoft 
pot, when the procefs is finifhed, is called fulphurated ariti. 
mony. 

Reguhn of antimony is prepared in the following manner. 
The ore, when beaten fmall and wafted, is out into a cruci- 
ble, and, along with it, a certain preparation of iron, and an 
alkaline flux: the crucible is then placed in a furnace ; and 
the iron having a greater affinity to the fulphur, than the ful- 
phur has to the ore, feparates the one from the other, mak- 
ing the fulphur fwim on the top of the fluid metal : The 
matter in the crucible, when fufficiently heated, is poured in- 
to a call iron cone, from which it is taken when cooled, and 
then the fulphur readily feparates from the inetal. The me- 
tal is again beaten into fmall pieces, put a fecond time into 
a crucible in the furnace, and melted, with a mixture of anti- 
mony and an alkaline flux ; it is then poured into a veffel of a 
conical fhape, from which it is taken, when cooled, having 
the form of a large fugar loaf, and a fine ftarry furface. Its 
texture is full of little mining veins, or threads, like needle?, 
and is brittle as glafs. Regulus of antimony is a common in- 
gredient in fpeculums, in bell metal, in types for printing, &amp;c. 

The

The fulphurated antimony is fold at 42I., the regulus of 
antimony at 80I. per ton. 

Miners, Village, tf*.— There are 40 people, exclufive of an 
overfeer, employed at prefent in the mines, and in preparing 
the antimony. A miner's wages are from to 26L a year, 
and, as fuch, he enjoys many other advantages. The com- 
pany has built a village, which is pleafantly fituated on the 
•banks of the Megget, and named James* 'Town, in which 
every miner is provided with a comfortable lodging for him- 
felf and his family, at a moderate rent : He has grafs for a 
cow, during the fummer, for which he pays no more than 20s., 
and ics. for coarfe hay for her provifion in the winter; and 
may have as much land as he has occafion for, at the rate of 
ios. per acre, for cultivating cabbages and potatoes. A ftore- 
houfe is built by the company, in which they mean to lay up 
grain when the prices are low, and fell it out to the workmen, 
at all times, even in a feafon of dearth and fcarcity, at the 
rate at which it was purchafed. The miners are at work 
only 6 hours a-day ; and, to encourage them to read, a pre- 
fent was, fome months ago, made them in books, by the com- 
pany, to the value of 15I. ; and thefe, with others, which the 
workmen have fince been able to purchafe, amount at prefent 
to 120 volumes. To render the filiation, of the miners as 
comfortable as poffible, the company has built a fchool-houfe, 
for the purpofe of having their children educated; has grant- 
ed considerable advantages to the teacher, and purpofes to 
give ttili per annum, to which each of the workmen is to add- 
is. a quarter, as a fund for the relief of fuch individuals 
among them, as may be difqualified for following their em- 
ployment by ficknefs and old age. We wifli fuccefs to this 
undertaking. The mining company not only finds employ- 
ment to many individuals, but has done an effential fervice to

the public, by making an excellent road, along the E. fide of 
Megget, between James' Town and Waulk-Mill; and, in the 
line of this road, which is three miles and a half, has built 
4 Hone bridges, of one arch each. 

Eminent Men, &amp;c — The prefent family of Wefterhall arc 
all natives of the parilh ; and they have diftinguiflied them- 
ielves much, and are well known in the world. Mr. Pulte- 
ney, who married the heirefs of Bath, is one of this family, 
as was the late Governor Johnstone, whofe bravery as an 
officer, and whofe information and eloquence as a fenator, are 
fufficiently known, and will long be remembered. Here, 
too, are depofited his remains,, over which, and many of his 
anceftors, John John (tone of Alva, Eiq. has ereded a very 
elegant maufoleum. This is a piece of excellent architecture, 
and muft have coft 700I. or thereabout. The pariih gave 
birth alfo to Commodore Pasley, who at this inftant com- 
mands the firft divifion of the van fquadron of Lord Howe's 
fleet, as i% lies in line of battle at Torbay. 

Antiquities. — Befides the remains of the Bruidical temple 
above mentioned, veftiges of encampments may be traced on 
the tops of feveral of the hills in the N. W. end of the pa- 
rifla. Thefe feem to have been out ftations of the Roman 
camp, which bears the name of Cajlle-c?er, in the S. end of 
the pariih of Elkdalemuir ; and there are others along the 
banks of the Elk, which were probably formed as part of a 
chain of communication between Caftle-o'er and the camp at 
Netherbie, in the neighbourhood of Langtown. There is 
a great number of burians in the parilli. Tbefe are all of a 
circular form, and are from 36 to 50 yards diameter*. On

fortification, of a triangular form. It has the appearance of 
great antiquity, and has undoubtedly been a place of very 
confiderable ftrength ; but it is fo much fallen into ruins, that 
no probable conjecture can now be formed, either of the time 
w hen it was built, or by whom it was poffeffcd. There are 
veftiges of an old tower, or caftle, at Glendinning, and the 
remains of another at Wefterhall. 

Wood.— About 50 years ago, the parifh was much better 
ftored with wood than it-is now. From the S. E. end of it, 
however, to about a mile beyond the church, there is a con„ 
fiderable quantity of natural wood along the banks of the 
Elk, and feveral thriving plantations on the eftates of Craigs, 
Dowglen and Wefterhall ; at the laft of which places, there 
are many very venerable afties and plane trees. 

Difeafes There are no difeafes peculiar to the parilh. 

The rheumatifm and tuberculous phthijis arel the moft preva-. 
lent. The practice of inoculation has, for many years, been 
very general, and very fuccefsful.

think that they were places of ftrength, into which the inhabitants collected 
their cattle, when alarmed with a vifitation from the Englilh Borderers ; and 
many are of opinipn that they were formed for the purpofe of protecting the 
cattle, during the night, from the ravages of wild beafts, when this country was 
moftly covered with wood. The laft of thefe fuppofitions feems to receive fome 
countenance from the following circumftanc^s, that there is a burton on almoft 
every farm, and that its fituation, in general, is on the firft piece of dry or rifing 
ground that is to be met with in the neighbourhood of the farm-ftead, efpecially 
when fuch a fituation is rendered the more inaccefiible, by the bank of the river, 
fr fome other adjoining precipice. 



53° Statlfacal Account 

_ ^^W^There are hares, rabbits, and fome foxes 
in the parifli. We have the /waUow, the wood-cock, the 
cuckoo, and other migratory birds, in their feafons. Part- 
ridges have not been fo numerous for fome years as they 
formerly were. The moor-toci and hen are natives, and in 
confiderable numbers ; but the black-cock is feldom to be 
met with. 

Peat was the only fuel formerly in ufe ; but as mofs 
33 no-where to be found in any confiderable quantity, except 
on the tops of the hills, (and is therefore of difficult accefs), 
and as peats cannot be properly got in rainy feafons, and efpe- 
ciallv as a road for carts is now opened into the parilh of Can- 
nobie, where coals are worked, thefe are become part of the 
fuel ufed in almolt every family. 

Prices of Grain — The price of grain was remarkably high 
laft feafon. Oatmeal fold at as. 8d. a ftone, of 17^ lbs.; yet 
none that the writer knows of were in danger of perifliing 
for want. The meal is now felling at 2s. the ftone, and the 
price is expected to be ftill lower, as there has not been, per- 
haps, in the memory of man, a more plentiful crop of oats 
and barley, in this part of the country, than the prefent, 
which, within the bounds of the parifli, is now \06iobcr 2 1. J 
almoft gathered in, and in excellent order. 

Character, &amp;c — The inhabitants of Wefterkfrk have long 
been remarked for decency and regularity of conduct. They 
are, in general, religious without fup'erftition, and charitable 
without oftentation, and temperate almoft without exception. 
None of the poor are reduced to the neceffity of begging 
bread : in what they receive from the parifli, and what they

can earn, they have a comfortable fubfiftence ; and many of 
the tenants are men of very considerable property. The dif- 
fenters, of all denominations, do not amount to more than 
io. There are 4 ale-houfes in the parifli ; but thefe are little 
frequented ; nor do thofe who keep them depend much on the 
profits of this employment for the fupport of their families.

for fome time paft, very deficient, owing to a circumftance, which will be ex- 
plained afterwards, as the explanation may be ufcftU to other parifhes. 



534 Stati/lical Account 

Poor—The average of Mated penfioners on the poor's roll, 
tor the laft 10 years, is 14. The expenditure on thefe, in- 
eluding occafional fupplies to others, and the falaries of feffion 
clerk, precentor, beadle, fynod and prelbytery clerks, and 
prefbytery officer, amounts, at an average, to 42I. per annum. 
The money at prefent in the kirk treafurer's hands, is a mere 
trifle. The poor, however, have been, hitherto, maintained 
pretty decently, by the funds arifing from the weekly collec- 
tions, and from the ufe of the parilh mortcloths, without hav- 
ing recourfe to any affiffment for that purpofe, though not 
without the neceffity of frequent encroachments on the very 
fmall capital in the treafurer's handi. 

Charitable Societies and Mortcloths —The body of colliers, 
in this parilh have been in ufe to keep what they call a bo J, 
from which they allow an aliment, or fupport, to fuch of the 
contributors as are laid afide from work by ficknefs. This 
no doubt, afforded a temporary relief to the parifh funds! 
But when the contributor dies, there is no provifion made 
for the widow and family, who mufl, confequently, fall a bur- 
den on thefe funds. They purchafed, fome years ago, from 
this dock, a fet of mortcloths, the ufe of which was given 
gratis, to the contributors. The body of carters, who have a 
fund of the fame kind, within thefe 2 or 3 years, followed 
their example. As the great body of the parilh confifts of 
thefe two descriptions of people, the kirk-feffion forefaw, that 
this practice, if allowed to continue, would foon go nearly to 
extinguifli altogether the funds arifing from the ufe of the pa- 
rifh mortcloths. They communicated their ideas on this cir- 
cumftance to the heritors of the parifh, who unanimoufly agreed 
to concur with the kirk-feffion in trying the point of law on 
this fubject, and to defray the whole expcr.ee that fhould be 
incurred on this occafion. The neighbouring parifh of Liber-

ton, who were in the fame fituation, joined in the procefs. Ac- 
cordingly, a decree of the Court of Seffion, dated November 
3 oth 1792, was obtained, "ftridly prohibiting the ufe of any 
" but the.parifli mortcloths." Notwithftanding this decifion 
in their favour, the kirk-feffion, in confideration of that de- 
gree of relief which they were fenfible the parifti funds de- 
rived from thefe boxes, by maintaining decently fuch of the 
contributors as may be laid afide, by accident or difeafe, were 
willing to grant them fome indulgence. Accordingly, after 
having obtained the full confent of all the heritors, they agreed 
to allow them the ufe of their own mortcloths for the fpace of 
20 years, by which time their prefent mortcloths may be fup- 
pofed to be worn out ; on condition that, at every time any 
of them are ufed, they pay to the kirk treafurer, for the be- 
nefit of the poor, the moderate fum of 4s.; it being exprefsly 
underftood, that this indulgence mall continue only during the 
continuance of that aid which they have been accuftomed to 
give to the parifh funds ; but, that the moment any of thefe 
boxes are given up, and confequently that aid is withdrawn, 
this indulgence mail be at an end ; and the kirk-feffion, in 
that event, are determined immediately to avail themfelves of 
the right which they now poffi:fs, by virtue of this decree. 

Collieries. — Coal works have been very long carried on here. 
The following ftate of the feams of coal is given from the beft. 
authority : There are no lefs than 19 different feams that run 
through this parilh, ftretching nearly N. and S. Six of thefe 
feams are termed fiat, becaufe they lie in a horizontal pofition, 
and make but a fmall angle with the horizon ; dipping to the 
eaftward, 1 in 10, and fometimes 1 in 15 or 20 feet. The other 
13 are called edge feams, owing to the pofition in which they 
fland, running down from the earth's furface in a perpendicu- 
lar direction, and making an angle of near 90 degrees with 

the 



53^ Stalift'ical Account 

the horizon. Thefe feams vary in their thickneffes. The 
thickeft of the flat feams are about 4 feet, and the thinneft 
about 2t. The thickeft of the edge feams are about 9 or 10 
feet, and the thinneft about 2. All of thefe feams have been 
already wrought in part ; fome of them probably 200 years 
ago ; feveral of them by levels taken from the fea, and others 
by levels from the loweft parts of thefe lands. Some of the 
flat feams, which are of the beft quality, have been wrought 
of late, and are ft.ill working by fire engines, and other ma- 
chinery, 26 fathoms perpendicular depth below the fea. There 
Hill remain to be wrought a great quantity of thefe feams ; 
which, if ever attempted in any future period, will require 
very powerful fire engines to drain the water from them, and 
confequently a great outlay of money, before thefe coals can 
be brought to market. 

Wages and CharaEler. — The bufinefs of a collier feems to 
be a very lucrative one. Each of them may earn 18s. or 
20s. per-week. It is however matter of much regret, that 
very few inftances are known, of fuch as are fo attentive as to 
fave any thing at all. On the contrary, it is the heavy com- 
plaint of all the coal-mafters, that a collier will work none, 
fo long as he has any money in his pocket. This is the real 
reafon of the fcarcity of that article, which was fo deeply and 
univerfally felt during the courfe of laft winter. 

Antiquities The only antiquity here, that deferves to be 

taken notice of, is a very high ridge, of a circular form, and 
of considerable extent, which evidently appears to be altoge- 
ther artificial. The people of the country have always called 
it " ^he Kaim" a corruption, it is fuppofed, of the word 
Camp. If it is the remains of a camp, it could not be a Roman 
one, as it is well known that their camps were of a fquare form.

By the Rev. Mr. jAJtES Hay, Mini/ten</head> 



<p>Situation, Extent, Rivers, Lakes, and Fi/h'. 

THE parifli of Roberton, in the prefbytery of Selkirk- 
lies in the weftern extremities of the fliires of Rox- 
burgh and Selkirk, where they march with the county of 
Dumfries. It is eftimated about thirteen miles in length, 

and fix in breadth. The water of Borthwick, running 

to the E. from the high grounds, where the Ihires of Sel- 
kirk and Dumfries meet, divides the parifli into two parts, 
nearly equal. The water. Ale, flowing from a beautiful cir- 
cular lake, of nearly 2 miles in circumference, in the N. W. 
quarter of the parifli, holds, while in it, a courfe nearly pa- 
rallel to the Borthwick, from which it is about 2 miles dis- 
tant Befides Alemuir Loch, there are feveral fmaller lakes, 

in which there is abundance of fine perch and pike ; and in

Ung that of Lochleven. The waters, Borthwick and Ale, 
augmented in their courfe b 7 a great number of rivulets, 
abound with trouts of the beft quality 5 but it is only in the 
fpawnmg feafon that they are vifited by falmon. 

Game, Woods, and Mojfes. The diverfion of mooting may 
here be as much enjoyed as that of angling, as there is plenty 
of all the common kinds of game.— That the part of this pa- 
nih lying in the Ihire of Selkirk, was within the bounds of 
the royal foreft, appears from the valuation of the land. The 
valuations, in proportion to prefent rents, are uniformly 
higher in Selkirk-lhire than in Roxburgh-mire. At prefent, 
there is but little wood in the parilh: In a few years the banks 
of the Borthwick will be more covered, as forae proprietors 

are at prefent rearing confiderable plantations Mofles are 

numerous ; almoft every farm has its particular mofs. The 
minifter has the privilege of carting peats, by a yearly rota- 
tion, in no lefs than 5 of them. The marl, found in fome of' 
thefe mofles already drained, is of the beft fliell kind j and 
has, for many years, been profitably ufed. Peats vary much 
in quality in the different mofles. 

Surface and Soil — The parim is hilly ; but there is no 
hill of extraordinary magnitude or height in it. From 
the Borthw ick and the Ale, the land rifes by a gentle afcent. 
The lower grounds are in a ftate of cultivation, and there 
are fome fpots of planting along the Borthwick; the higher 
grounds ai;e employed in pafturage ; the fummits between the 
Ale on the N., and the Teviot on the S., are, in part, mofly, 
but generally covered with grafs or heath ; and thofe fpots, 
only, where mofles are wrought, appear black. Grafs is pre^ 
dominant ; and the general appearance of the parifli, to the 
eye, is that of graffy hills. — The foil, locally varying, is, in 

general,

general, of good quality. The greateft part, even of the 
higher grounds, is of a hard gravelly, or rocky bottom. In 
the higheft and weftern part of the parifh, there is a confider- 
able proportion of wet and boggy land. From land, which 
has a fouthern expofure, has been drained, or is naturally 
dry, crops have been taifed as early, and as good, as from 
lands many miles lower down the country. The peculiar 
fitnefs of the foil, for the pafturage of fheep, is evinced by 
their reputatioa in the country for foundnefs, for carcafe, and 
for wool. 

Climate and Difeafes, \$c, — The fituation of the parifli, 
nearly centrical between the E. and W. feas, fufficiently in- 
dicates the nature of the climate* — Though this parifli ap- 
pears level, when viewed from heights, greatly inferior to the 
Ettrick hills on the N., and thofe of Liddjfdale on the S j 
yet it is fo high, as always to intercept fome portion of the 
moifture of thofe heavy clouds, which are fo often feen attract- 
ed to either or to both of thefe quarters. The autumnal rains 
are particularly violent, and fometimes of long duration. In 
the months of November and December, they are accom- 
panied with fuch boifterous winds, that only a few houfes 
can perfe&amp;ly exclude the waters of the weftern tempeft. There 
are inftances of houfes, built with lime, and judged fufficient,^ 
through which thefe rains force their way every winter. The 
noxious efFe&amp;s of a damp atmofpbere were formerly prevent- 
ed by the copious ufe of fpirits, and now by better houfes 
and clothing ; but flannel is little, if ever, ufed by the labour- 
ing people, among whom rheumatifm is a general complaint,

almoft invariably accompanying the decline of life. Unlefc 
*he weather be tempeftuous, the labours of the field are never 
interrupted, on account of a cafual, though heavy rain. Not- 
withftanding the great moifture of the climate, to which the 
labouring inhabitants are expofed, they are healthy, robuft, 
and generally reach a good old age. No inflances of rare lon- 
gevity occur ; but there were recent, and there are exifting 
examples of great vigour and activity, in perfons who have 
feen fourfcore years. 

Produce and Cultivation.— All the ordinary kinds of graiir, 
andfometimes wheat, are raifed in the parifh, but it is thought 
not in proportion to the confutation. The mode of culture 
has, of late, been greatly reformed by the introduftion of 
green crops, grafs feeds, and efpecially the judicious ufe of 
marl. There is, perhaps, too great a proportion of the arable 
• land Hill kept in tillage ; but this is a miftake, which is be- 
coming every year more obvious, and will foon be curried. 
Much of the land is fit for the growth of flax ; but its cul- 
ture muft be negleded, as unprodudive, till a flax mill be 
erected fomewhere in the neighbourhood. It is for the 
breeding and feeding of meep, that the foil and climate are beft 
adapted, and to which, accordingly, the chief .attention of the 
inhabitants is directed. The meep paflure has been greatly 
meliorated, by the burning of heath, draining of wet lands, 
and ufe of marl *. 

Proprietors and Rent — There are u heritors ; 4 of whom 
have houfes, and generally refide in the parilli. One manfion-

Produce.— There are 358 bolls of grain yearly fown, and 
95 packs of wool annually fold. 

Fuel.r-Pczts are the principal fuel, and are reckoned as 
jdear as coals from Lothian or Northumberland, a diftance of 
30 miles. The convenience of this fpecies of fuel, its being 
near at hand, and procured at a feafon, when fervants upon 
farms could not be otherwife fo profitably employed, give it 
the preference ; and cottagers, living near moffes, make it a 
bufinefs, through the year, to carry peats from the diftance 
of 8, and even fometimes 14 miles, to Hawick ; where they 
are fold, at the rate of from 3s. to 4s. the fingle cart load, 
and from is. 3d., to is-. 6d. the back load. 

Roads.— The expence of fuel is heightened by the badnefs 
of the roads. The principal road in the parifh, and the moll 
direft one from Dumfries, 8tc. to the towns of Hawick, Sel- 
kirk, Sec. is along the Borthwick, but is made only half way 
up this parim, and not even formed where it enters that of 
Wilton. The gentlemen of Dumfries-fhire have carried this 
line of road nearly to the confines of their own county ; and 
it is to be regretted, that they have not been feconded by pro- 
prietors of land in the counties on the E., in a meafure of 
fuch obvious importance. The heritors of Roberton are at

to him, and 3 1. to the minifter of Wilton, from lands within 
the prefent cure, upon the fuppofition, that the remaining

School— A new fchool-houfe was built in 1790. The 
fchoolmafter has the ordinary legal falary, fome perquifites as 
feffioii-clerk and precentor, and a fmall fee from the heritors, 
fbr uplifting and diftributing the poor's money. Till fome- 
thing be done by the public to render country fchoolinafters 
more comfortable and independent, the important office which 
they bear, cannot be filled by men of education, of talents, 
and conference enough to benefit fociety, as they, with fome 
encouragement, might do. 

Poor The average number of poor on the roll, young 

and old, mfcy be about 32. They are fupplied by collections 
made in the kirk and quarterly affeffments. A fum is always 
kept in hand for occafional fupplies ; and, if fuch fund fliould 
fail, the minifter has hitherto had the approbation of the he-

Employments — Of thefe families 28' are tenantry; the reft 
confift of fhepherds, hinds, day labourers, and forne tradef- 
men. The number of the latter, owing to the neighbourhood 
of Hawick, is fmall. There is not a ftioemaker in the pa- 
rifh. The nature of the foil and climate has fuggefted to 
herds and labourers the ufe of a kind of a ftrong leather

in the market town, mended at home, and known by the 
name of clogs. 

• Condition and Character. — The inhabitants, in their feveral 
flations, are comfortable and independent; nor are there 1 
wanting inftances of confiderable wealth. They are equally 
induurious and frugal. There are a good many feparatifts 
from the Eftahlifhed Church ; Burghers, Antiburghers, and 
Cameronians ; but no Epifcopalians or Roman Catholics. The 
character of feparatifts and adherents fcarce admits of any 
fliade of diftindtion, unlefs it be, that the former have the ap- 
pearance of greater zeal in religious matters than the latter. 
In other refpe£fo, they are much alike. If the Seceders 
think themfelves more religious, thofe belonging to the 
Hftabliftiment fancy themfelves better moral men, and more 
heartily attached to Government. Happily no party rancour 
is known, and no religious or political controverfics interrupt 
the exercife of that fympathy to one another in diltrefs, and 
of that neighbourly and obliging difpofition, which are the 
more linking and diftinguifhing features of the Chriftiaft

Antiquities, Cafcade, &amp;c— There are feveral remains of en- 
tampments and fortifications. One large fquare encampment, 
flanked by a rivulet, whofe banks aire fteep, having the 
Borthwick in front, and artificial ramparts towards the hill, 
bears to this day the name of Africa. Between this, and 
others of a circular or femicircular form, the Cat-rail (of 
which fome veftiges, though with breaks, may (till be traced), 
is fuppofed to have run *. One of thefe femicircular encamp- 
ments, above a miles from the fquare one, and of which it 
has a diftind view, has, for its diameter, the fteep and craggy 
bank of a rivulet, where there is a beautiful cafcade; the fall 
of water being about 20, and the breadth 6 feet, when the 
rivulet is in flood.

PARISH OF <name ref="NA">TULLIALLAN</name>. 

(County of Perth—Prefhytery of Dumblane— Synod of Perth 

and Stirling.} 

By the Rev. Mr. David Simson, Minifter.</head> 



<p>Name, Extent, and EreBion. 

r JpULLiALLAN, according to thofe who are acquainted with 
the Gaelic language, fignifies the beautiful hill ; which name 
was probably given to it from its appearance, the greateft part 
of it being a beautiful bank, gently declining to the S. and 
W., and the reft of it Hoping to the N. and N. E. It is 
generally fuppofed to be 4 miles from S. to N., and 4 mile* 
from E. to W. It is of an irregular figure, being broader at 
the two ends than in the middle. Originally, it comprehended 
the barony of Tulliallan only ; but, in 1659, the barony of 
Kincardine, the lands of Lurg and Sands, and Kellywood, 
were disjoined from the parifh of Culrofs, and annexed to it. 
The whole parifh now contains about 2760 acres. 

Soil, Cultivation, and Produce. — The foil is various. It 
confifts of clay, rich loam, fand, and dryfield ; all of which lie 
upon till or rock. About 40 years ago, it was in a ftate of 
nature j but, fince that period, it has been highly improved ; 

and 



of 'Tulliallan. 547 

and the greateft part of it has been enclofed with Hone dikes, 
or hedges, which lafl have fucceeded amazingly well. As 
the farmers are diligent in procuring dung from the village o£ 
Kincardine, and lime from Lord Elgin's lime quarries, at a 
confiderable expence, and are affiduous in cultivating their 
farms, they generally have good returns of wheat, barley, 
oats, beans and peafe, potatoes, turnips, and fown grafs. 
Were not the tenants reftrifted by their leafes, the quantity 
of oats fown would be lefs than any other grain, owing to 
the high thirlage. If a tenant carries II bolls of oats to the 
mill, he may lay his account with leaving one behind him as 
dues ; I had almoft faid I in 10 ; which is very difcouraging 
to the improvement of lands. 

River, Climate, and Difeafes. — Surrounded by the river 
Forth on the S. W., expofed to a free current of air in this 
dire&amp;ion, and well flickered by the elevation of the ground, 
and the adjacent woods on the N. and E., this parifh pof- 
feffes, at all feafons, a morje mild and temperate climate than 
many other parts of Scotland, in the fame latitude. Violent 
inflammatory difeafes, depending on the qualities of the air, are 
feldom feen here, excepting the croup among infants, which 
prevails moft in cold and damp fituations. During the courfe 
of the laft 20 years, the fmall pox (the moft fatal difeafe in 
this diftrift), has been obferved to become epidemical every 
fecond or third year, often preceded by the chincough, and 
followed by the meafles. The fcarlet fever, thrice on one 
occafion was ufhered in with all the fymptoms-of the malignant 
fore throat ; and the dyfentery once in Auguft 1784, which, 
at its commencement, was, in feveral inftances, fatal. With 
thefe exceptions, infectious fevers are very uncommon. Agues, 
formerly prevalent, have not appeared thefe many years, 
owing, in fome meafure, to the improvements in agriculture,

the general cleanlinefs, and free ventilation of the houfes of 
pianj of the inhabitants ; who, being in eafy circumftances, 
ieel lefs the evils arifing from poverty and extreme want. It 
is probable, that the mortality of many of the difeafes men- 
tioned, has been, of late years, mitigated, by an improved mode 
of living, a more eafy accefs of the inhabitants to a greater 
variety of vegetable productions, and a more moderate ufe of 
fi(h, which abound in the river. The fmall pox has alfo been 
greatly alleviated by inoculation. Praftitioners of experi- 
ence affirm it would be more general and fuccefsful, if prac- 
tifed by mothers on children, one or two months old ; the 
eruptive fever being of much fhorter duration, and the puf- 
tules very few in number, at this early period. 

Fijheries.— There are above 100 cruives in the parifh; 
in which are caught herrings, whitings, haddocks, fparlings, 
fythe, fprats^ecrd, Ikate, with fome few falmon and flounders. 
Of thefe laft, there are 4 different fpecies, called here the/o/e, 
the turbot, the /and, and the bunnock flounders. The fole 
and turbot are efteemed the beft. The precife value of a 
cruive cannot be afcertained, as it depends on the quantity of 
fifh caught. When the herrings are numerous, it may amount 
to more than 5I., befides the tytbe, that is, a tide in the ftream. 
In other years, their gain would fcarcely keep them in repair. 
The average of a cruive, in good and bad fifhing feafons, is 
eftimated between 40s. and 5QS. yearly, befides the tythe. 
When the herring fifhery fucceeds, it is a great benefit to the 
place and neighbourhood. Thefe, together with the potatoes, 
fupport the poor people for fome months in the end of the 
year. 



Colliery and Salt Work. — About 60 years ago, there was 
an extenfivc colliery and fait work carried on here. Therp 



of Tulliallan. 549 

is a man living, who knew 4* V^™° and th f b ! a ' erS ' 
employed in it. The coals, at that time, were either fold to 
the country, or confumed by the pans ; none of them were 
exnorted ; bnt after the fhipping increafed, they carried them 
to Dundee, Perth, See. Though there is abundance of coals 
to work, and a fteam engine was erected, nothing has been 
done for a number of years. There were formerly 35 Ml 
pans in this parifh, 1 4 of which have been in ruins beyond the 
memory of any man living. Their foundations were lately 
dug up, and there is not a veftige of them to be feen. About 
60 years ago, there were 21 in the parifh, 6 at N«v Pans, and 
15 at Weft Pans, now called Kincardine. The author has 
known 18 of them working at one time. The proprietor 
furnifhed each pan with 36 fmall cart loads of coals in the 
week; and for thefe the falter was obliged to produce 4 
draughts of fait, each draught containing 14 firlots of Lin- 
lithgow barley meafure. The produce of the whole pans, 
(fuppofing them to go conftantly), was 252 bolls in the week, 
and 13,104 bolls in the year ; which were fold at 48s. the boll, 
amounting to 2,6201. 16s. But after the duty was laid upon 
it by aft of parliament, it was fold at as. the bufhel. The 
wages paid to the falter, were a peckof oatmeal, at 8 Ad, the 
peck, and what fait he had more than his 14 firlots from his 
draught ; and, when cleaning the bucket, pots, gec, he had 
only 4d. per day. The whole of thefe pans are in ruins, ex- 
cepting two, which work but little ; for as the coal, is not work- 
ing, the pan wood tnuft be carried from the Alloa collieries 
to Alloa fhore, and from thence to Kincardine, by water, 
which makes it very dear. The fait is at prefent felling here 
at 48. the bufhel. A firlot of fait, taken from the pan, weighs 
58 lb. or a bufhel and 2 lb. After it hath lain fome time in 
the granary, it will weigh 63 lb. or a bufhel and 7 lb.

A confiderable number of them confifl of two, and fome cf 

them of three flats. They are moftly covered with tiles, and 
built upon pan afl.es ; which, being naturally dry, contributes 
greatly to the health of the inhabitants. There are two mar 
ket days in the week, viz. Wednefday and Saturday, which 
are generally well fupplied with provifions. Beef, mutton 
veal, and lamb, fell from 3 d. to 5 d. the lb ; butter from 8d! 
to xod ; and cheefe from 3 d. to 4 d. the lb : fowls, from is. to 
Md. a piece; a duck at 8d.; a chicken 8d. ; eggs from 4 d. to 
Cd. the dozen. There is a poft office in the village of Kincar- 
dine; and we have two polls from Edinburgh regularly every 
day in the week, the one by Stirling, and the other by the 
Queensferry. By the latter, all letters from Fife, Perth, and 
the North Country, are conveyed. For thefe laft three 
years, the amount paid into it, by this parifh only, was 
■347I. 10s. ^d. 

Roads, Ferry, and Harhour—The roads are extremely bad 
in winter, in foft weather, though good in fummer. The pa- 
rifh affords no materials to make them of, but free-ftone and 
pan afhes, which carriages foon grind to powder. There is a 
paffage boat between Kincardine and HiggirCs Neuk, at prefent 
on a very incommodious footing. It is only within 2 hours, 
before and after flood, that they can pafs with a horfe ; and foot 
paffengers are often obliged, at low water, to wade through 
mud for 40 yards. The fhipmaflers here, by a voluntary 
contribution, have begun to build a pier. If their finances 
allow them to finifh it, it will be a great advantage to thofc 
who have occafion to pafs here. 

Shipping 



of full'iallan: 55! 

Shipping and Commerce.— Kincardine is a creek, within 
the precinfts of the cuftom-houfe of Alloa*. For thefe 40 
years pad, a confiderable number of (hip carpenters have re- 
lided here, who built annually feveral floops and brigantines. 
Veflels of 200 and 300 tons have been built here, for the 
Weft India trade, and the Greenland fifliery. In 1786, there 
were 9 veflels upon the flocks at one time j and the number 
then belonging to this place was 91, and their tonnage 5,461 5 
which is about 200 tons more than what belongs to Alloa, 
and the whole precinds of that port, at prefent ; and more than 
half of the tonnage f of Leith in that year. If the diftilleries, 
in this parifh and the neighbourhood, had not failed, they 
would have been confiderably increai'ed: But owing to thefe, 
and a ftagnation of trade that fucceeded in this place for two- 
years, their {hipping decreafed; and, fince that period, 24 veflels,. 
amounting to 1859 tons, have been fold or loft. Within thefe 
three years, trade has begun to revive, and feveral veflels have 
been built. The number of floops and brigantines belonging 
to Kincardine, at prefent, is 75, and their regifter tonnage 
4043. All thefe, excepting two, are included in the §261 tons, 
which, in the Statiftical Account of the parifh of Alloa, are 

faid 



* In the beginning of this century, there were no (hipping of any confequence 
belonging to it. They had only 5 boats, from 10 to 20 tuns burden. Thefe 
were employed in carrying fait to Leith, and importing from thence wood, and, 
iron, for the ufe of the pans, and in the lime trade. They went no farther. 
But after fome fhip carpenters had come to fettle in it, the fpirit for fhip build- 
ing prevailed fo much, that, in 1740, they had 30 veflels, from 15 to 60 tons 
barden, amounting to 860 tons. In 1745, feveral of thefe were employed in 
government fervice. When the coal was working, and the fait pans going, 
they had abundance of exports ; but fince thefe were given up, they have had 
none^ Yet this did not deftroy their fpirit for trade and fhip building; for they 
had the addrefs and good fenfe to become carriers to other ports.

faid to belong to that port*. They require about 300 Tailor* 
to navigate them. They import a great quantity of wood, 
iron, flax, and lintfeed, from the Baltic and Holland, and barley 
from England and the Carfe of Gowrie, &amp;c. ; and they ex- 
port coals from Alloa, Clackmannan, and the other collieries 
on the Frith, to Dundee, Perth, Norway and Sweden. Some 
of them are in the Mediterranean and Levant trade, and one 
of them has been in government fervice to the Eaft Indies. 

Coaft At Kincardine there is a very good road-ftead, 

where 100 veffels may ride with fafety. The beach where 
they clean and repair their veffels is hard gravel. From the 
W. end of the parifh to New Pans, the more is level ; and, 
where the flood ebbs, 400 or 500 acres of fine mud might be 
taken from the river by a fea dike, and annexed to the land. 
From New Pans, to the parifh of Culrofs, the fhore is full of 
rocks, which are vifible when the tide ebbs, but covered when 
it flows. 

Minerals. — This parifh abounds with excellent quarries of 
free-ftone, both yellow and white. The quarry of Longannat 
hath been in great reputation, time immemorial. It is a dur- 
able ftone, perfectly white, of a fmall greek, and takes on a fine 
fmooth polifh. The demand for it has been greater than the 
quarriers have ever been able to fupply. Befides many houfes 
in the neighbourhood, of the fir ft architecture, that have been 
built out of it, it has been carried by fea to many diftant 
places. The Royal Exchange, Infirmary, and Regifter Office, 
in Edinburgh, and one of the churches in Aberdeen, were 
partly built out of it. And it is reported here, that one of 

the 



• Sec Vol. VIII. No. XL. 



tf Tulllallatu 553 

the principal houfes of Amsterdam, and the Stadt-Houfe of 
JIollaND were built out of it *. 

Mills .There are 4 mills in this parifh, within 40 yards of 

each other, built in a moll fubftantial manner ; viz. a meal, 
a barley, a flour, and a threfliing mill, all driven by the fame 
water. Little, if any, of that water arifes from fprings, for 
there are very few in the parifli, but from what falls from the 
clouds. Before fleam engines were invented, the coal ma- 
chinery on the lands of Kincardine were driven by this water, 
as they had no rivers nor rivulets by which they could be 
wrought. To remedy this defeft, a ftrong dike was built 
between two rifing banks, about 40 yards in length, and 22, 
feet deep, and around all the rifing ground, they caft ditches, by 
which the water, tailing from the clouds, might be conducted 
into what is called the Papermill Dam, which, when full, covers 
56 acres, and contains water fufficient to drive the mills, and 
the coal machinery, for 9 months of the year. They likewife 
built another dam, which, when full, covers 50 acres. This 
Vol. XI. 4 A is 



* Thefe two laft, perhaps, may be thought difputable ; but, to corroborate, 
this affertion, there are ft ill the remains of a long pier, faid to be built by a 
Dutch company, to be feen. About ao yards of it, neareft to the land, are in a 
great meafure entire. From this pier to low water, they built two ftone dikes, 
fome yards diftant from one another, in which were erected pullies, by which 
they hauled out their veffels through the dock formed by the two dikes. This 
dock was 9 feet deep at high water, but is now almoft filled up with mud. Conti- 
guous to it, there are the remains of a large refervoir, built by them, which filled 
when the tide flowed ; and, when it was near ebb, they opened a fluice in the 
refervoir, of about 9 feet wide, which emptied itfelf along the "pier into the 
dock, and carried off the mud which the former tide had wafhed into it. A 
little weft from it, there is another pier (if it may be fo called), named the Royal 
Exchange Pier, becaufe at it they loaded their veffels with ftones for that, 
building; and at this pier they generally load their veffels |t prefeot.

is not fo deep as the former, and only contains a quarter of 
a year's water. The laft is often dry in fummer, and the 
other, in a great drought, has not fo much water running into 
it as would fill a half inch pipe. 

Hijlilleries and Cattle — There* are two large diftillcries in 
this place, which feed annually from 170 to 200 cattle. Thefe, 
when fed, are fold at from iol. to 15I. each. They employ a 
great many fervants and horfes, befides what they hire. 
Their fpirits goto the Fife, Edinburgh, and Glafgow markets. 
They import barley from England, Carfe of Govvrie, &amp;c, 
befides what they purchafe in the neighbourhood. 

Manufactures. — No manufactures, excepting (hip building* 
which has been carried on fuccemvely for above 50 years part, 
have been introduced into Kincardine, until within thefe two 
years, that two companies for tambouring have fettled in it, 
who employ about 50 girls each, and 18 looms. The other 
mechanics are employed in working to the people of the 
parim. 

Houfes, — In 1740 there were 224 houfes in the parim. Of 
thefe 51 have been pulled down, and the ground they occu- 
pied annexed to farms. The number of houfes now Handing,

Proprietors and Rent.— There are 7 heritors in the parifli;

The church was formerly built about a mile farther 
north than it is at prefent, and was very fmall, being only 
36 feet in length, 16 in breadth, and 8 feet in height. 
The prefent church is built half an Englifh mile from the 
fhore, upon a riiing ground, overlooking the village of Kin- 
cardine, which lies between it and the Forth. It was built 
in 1675 ; and, were it not for it's Gothic windows, would be 
taken for a modern edifice. It appears, from the parifli re- 
cords, that though the heritors built the church, they did not 
feat it. This the kirk-feffion, in order to accommodate the 
people, did, out of the poor's funds; and afterwards, to reim- 
tmrfe'thofe funds, fold them to the pariihoners ; which they,

<p>Ere&amp;ion, Names, and Extent. 

tTT^HTS parifh, in its prefent ftate, confiits of the original 
JL par.fh of Groy, and that of DALCRObS annexed to it. It 
is not kno"/n when this annexation took place; but it is pro- 
bable that it happened at the Reformation. There are accounts 
of a vicar of Dalcrofs in the time of Popery, but none of any 
clergymen being there fince that timef. The names are fup- 
poled of French -origin : Croy from Croix^ a crofs; and Da l- 
crofs. from deta Croix. The extent of it is very great; in length 
f,om N. E. to S. W. it is about 16 miles. The breadth is 
various. In fome places it is indented, and almofl: interfecled 

by

and part of the walls of the church ltill remain ; and the miuiftcr has a glebe,

By the neighbouring pariflies \ and in others, including the 
wafte ground, it is 7 or 8 miles broad. 

River, Fijh, Woods, Surface, bV— The river Nairn, fo call- 
ed from the aller trees growing on its banks, runs through 
this parifti for about 8 miles ; fo that part of the parifti is in- 
eluded in the diftria of country called Strathnairn. In this 
river there are falmon and trout of a good quality. To the E. 
of Kilravock, there is a frhall falmon fiihing, the property of 
Mrs. Rofe bf Kilravock. The falmon aire fold in the neigh- 
bourhood. In the courfe of 12 years, the price of this article 
has been raifed from ifd. to 4d. per lb. The banks of the 
river are well cultivated, or, when they do not admit of cul- 
tivation, covered with wood, natural and planted ; which, 
with other circumftances to be afterwards ftated, has a very 
agreeable appearance, and forms a fcene of true rural amenity. 
The other part of the parifti, lying to the N. and N. W. of 
the Nairn, is almoft one continued ridge * from one end of 
the parifti to the other. As it confifts almoft entirely of wafte 
moor ground, withfmall fpots of land indifferently cultivated^ 
the appearance is rather bleak and difagreeable.

* On this ridge, and near the middle of it, on the fide towards the Nairn, 
was fought the famous battle of Cullbden; memorable for the complete defeat 
•f the adherents of the houfe of Stuart, in their laft attempt to replace that 
deluded family on the Britifli throne. The circumftances and confequenccs ef 
that action are fo well known, as to render it unnecefiary to give any account of 
them here. Strangers ftill vifit the field of battle, though there is little to be 
feen on it, excepting the graves of thofe that fell in the action, which are dis- 
cerned by the green furface, while the reft: df the ground is covered with black 
l»eath. Bullets, and fragments ef armour, that are picked up by people in the 
neighbourhood, are anxioufly fought after, and carefully prcfened, by the ti£ s 
tuofi, as curiofities and valuable relics;

lake — There is no running water in the parifh that merits 
notice, excepting the Nairn, already mentioned. There is one 
lake, called the Loch of the Clans ; bin for what reafon it goes 
by this name is not known. It is about a mile long, but the 
breadth is inconfiderable. There are no fi(b in it, excepting 
fome pike, which are faid to be fo voracious and deftru&amp;ive, 
as to prevent any other fifh from breeding there. 

Soil* The foil of this parifh, as might be reafonably ex- 
pected, from the great extent of it, is various. In general, 
that on the fides of the Nairn is good, and, when well culti- 
vated, produces good crops of all fpecies of grain In iome 
fmall fpots of the reft of the parifli, the foil is likewife good} 
but the far greater part of it is rather poor and thin, on a 
cold hard bottom, producing indifferent crops, which fuffer 
greatly when the harveft is late or wet. 

Population The population of this parifh appears to have 

decreafed confiderably during the laft 30 or 40 years.

the accounts have already been pubhflied, that it is unneceflary to difcufs them

Knowledge, in the year 1759, with a lift taken in the year 
1774, the decreafe, during that period, appears to have been

which is nearly one fourth lefs within thefe 35 years. No 
fatisfa&amp;ory reafon can be affigned for this great and rapid 
diminution of the population. It is attributed, in fome mea- 
fure, to the improvement and enlargement of feveral farms, 
by which the number, both of occupiers and fervants, has 
been greatly reduced. Of late, fome young men have been 
in the praftice of going to the South as labourers. But both 
thefe caufes conjoined, could not have produced the effe&amp;

above ftated. It is probable that many families have left 
the panlh, (though by reafon of the extent of it, they have 
pot been taken notice of,) in expedition of bettering their 
pondition in other places. 

Agriculture — The great body of the people are employed 
in agriculture. The farms are of various fizes ; fome pretty 
large, of 40I. and 50I. rent ; but the far greater part of them 
are below 2&amp;1., and fome of them inconfiderable crofts, lately 
brought into culture from the moor, and threatening to re- 
turn to their former ftate. The gentlemen, both proprietors 
3nd farmers, cultivate their lands in the more approved man- 
ner pra&amp;ifed in the South, by fallowing and liming, and by 
fowing grafs, and raifing green crops. They ufe likewife horfes 
and cattle of a large fize, and have implements, as ploughs, 
carts, harrows, &amp;c. of a proportionably good quality. But 
the common tenants, who occupy the far greater part of the 
parifli, have horfes and cattle of a diminutive fize, and imple- 
ments equally indifferent. Their crops of courfe are propor- 
tionably poor. 

Employ me?its.~'T\\tre are in the parifli artificers or tradefmen 
of the different crafts, as mafons, carpenters, millers, black- 
fmiths, weavers, tailors, fhoemakers, &amp;c. who are employed by 
the other inhabitants. But as moll of thefe tradefmen have more 
pr lefs land, which they cultivate, and on which they de- 
pend for pa.rt of their living, it would not be eafy, in fome 
cafes, to determine to which profeffion they belong. 

Li/advantages The people, in general, appear fatisfied with 

their condition, though they labour under great difad vantages, 
ehiefly from the caufes already ftated, namely, the unfavour-

uble quality of the foil on the one hand, and their bad treat- 
Lent of it on the other. It is much to be regretted, that they 
cannot be prevailed upon to adopt a preferable mode of farm- 
ing. Indeed mod of them are fo poor, as to be fcarcely able 
to labour their lands in the ordinary manner; but fuch as are 
in better circumftances are as averfe to improvements as their 
poorer neighbours. Though they have plenty of Hones for 
making enclofures, moft of the fields are quite open; and 
though there are inexhauftible quarries of lime-none on the 
fides°of the Nairn, and plenty of fuel for burning it, yet none 
of it is made ufe of, excepting by one proprietor, whofe great 
improvement, mall be dated under the fubfequent article. 

State of Property, Rent, r.-This parifh is the property 
pf ten heritors ; all of whom have land likewife in other pa- 
rities. Only 4 of thefe refide in the parifli. One refides at 
Kilravock, the feat of Rofe of Kilravock, one of the moft an- 
cient and remediable families in this country. Here is an old 
tower, faid to.be built in 1460, and an elegant modern houfc, 
on a rock, hanging over and warned by the Nairn. There 
are at this place gardens laid out with great tafte ; orchards, 
flocked with fruit trees of various kinds ; woods of consider- 
able extent, both natural and planted : All which make this 
the moft beautiful place in this part of the country, A little 
above Kilravock, lies Holme, the feat of Mr. Rofe of Holme. 
It is a neat manfion-houfe, beautifully fituated on the banks 
of the river, with fome natural wood and planting by it. And 
above that again, is Cantray the feat of David Davidfon, Efq, 
v;ho has built a neat commodious houfe there, with fuitable 
office houfes. He has been remarkably active and fuccefsfu! 
in improving his eftate, by cultivating and planting large 
trafts of wafte moor ground ; by making fubftantial regular 

fences ; by liming his lands, fowing gral's, and adopting the

*5 years ago, have been repaired fince that time, and are at 
prefent in pretty good condition. The diftrid called the Leys 
almoft detached from the reft of the parifh, is in ule on ac' 
count of its great diflance from the church, to have 'preach- 
ing once a month during fummer and autumn. But as there 
is neither houfe nor church there, when the weather is unfa- 
vourable, both minilter and congregation find great incon- 
venience, by being in the open air. There are in this parifh 
no d {Tenters from the Eftablifhed Church, excepting 3. or 4 of 
the Epifcopal perfuafion, who neverthelefs commonly atten4 
the church, 

JfAoo/f,— -There is a parochial fchool fituated near the 
church. The falary of the fchoolmafter, is a chafer of grain, 
allocated on, and paid by the tenants, in proportion to the ex- 
tent of then firms. This, with the fchool fees (which are the 
fame as in the neighbouring pariuies), and the perguifites be- 
longing 



ofCrdy* 567 

longing to the office of feffion clerk, make the whole provifioii 
for the fchoolmafter, at an average, about 22I. a year. There 
is likewife, in the parifh, afchool, on the eftablifhment of the 
Society for Propagating Chriftian Knowledge, The falary 
annexed to it is ill, The fchoolmafter is furnifhed with 
different articles of accommodation, by the heritor and tenants 
of the lands on which the fchool is ftationed ; as a free houfe, 
fuel, grafs and ftraw to a cow, a fmall garden, &amp;c. The child- 
ren of the poor are taught at this fchool gratis. Both fchools 
are well attended, as the people are much difpofed to give 
education to their children. 

Poor.— There is a great number of poor people in this pa- 
rifh. As it is well fupplied with fuel, this is an inducement 
to them to emigrate to it from other places, where that arti- 
cle is fcarce. The number generally on the roll is from 60 
to 70. The funds for their provifion are the weekly collec- 
tions in the church, the hire of a mortcloth or pall, ufed by 
the parifhioners at burials, and the intereft of 60I., due to the 
kirk-feffion by bond. Thefe funds afford only a fmall occafion- 
al relief to this number. Their chief fupport arifes from the 
benevolence of their neighbours, who are always ready to re- 
lieve the indigent and diftreffed. There are few travelling 
beggars belonging to this parifh, and no caufe for any : But 
as no effectual meafures are taken, in this part of the country, 
to prevent public begging, this parifh, and the neighbouring 
ones, are vifited by many from different and diflant parts of the 
Highlands. 

Mills Befides common mills, there is within the parifh 

a large handfome flour mill, on the Kilravock property, and 
another of a Idler fue on that of Holme. At thefe mills, a con.

<p>Name, Situation and Extent- 

LAirg, or Larig, fbould be written La ri Leig ; that is, 
befide or bordering on the lake. This definition agrees 
well with its fituation, for almoll the whole of the parifh. lies 
on the fides, or within fight of Loch-Shin. The extent of the 
parifh is 24 miles long, from E. to W. ; and the greateft 
breadth not above 8, including the breadth of Loch-Shin, 
which runs through about 20 miles of the length of the 
parifh. 

Soil and Surface. — The foil is various ; in a few places a 
good fertile loam, in others gravelifh ; and, in many, molly, 
very wet and fpouty. By far the greateft part of the parifh 
confifts of hills, and very extenfive trafts of heath. Not a 
twentieth part of it confifts of arable land j nor is there much 

Vol. XI. 4 G ©f 



5 7° Statijiical Account 

of what is called a &amp;W/y, or f weet gra f s , but a vail deal of 
heath and coarfe grafs. 

Climate — The climate is rainy ; but though the air is very 
damp, there is no diftemper peculiar to the parifli. The in- 
habitants, having the greateft abundance of peats, take care to 
keep a good fire without, and, as often as they can get at 
fpiritous liquors, they will kindle a fire within ; nor d© they 
apprehend more danger to their conftitutions from the one 
than from the other. 

River, Fijh, Lake, Wood, &amp;c — There is no river of any 
note, except the river Shin; which, running out of the E. end 
of the loch of that name, for about a mile, comes upon a mod 
tremendous rock, of about 20 feet high, and runs over it 
in a prodigious cafcade. The old method of killing the fal- 
mon of the Shin, (which are, in general, a much larger and 
coarfer fifh than any other in Scotland), was by thrufting a 
long creel or bafket in behind the cafcade, at the foot of the 
rock, and every fifh that jumped to get up, was fure to fall in 
the balket, and kill itfelf by the fall. When the river hap- 
pened to be very high a few of the lighteft fifh would get over 
the cafcade, and make their way to the lake, which was per- 
haps the circumftance that preferved the breed, the whole run 
of the water, from the great fall, being fo extremely rough 
and*rapid, that there is no fand nor gravel to proteft the fpawn j 
but the fifliing company have now eredled cruives upon the 
Shin, near the place where it difcharges itfelf into the Kyle 
of Sutherland.— Loch-Shin is a fine flieet of water, of about 
20 miles long, and not above 2 broad. There is a good wood, 
chiefly birch, on the S. fide of it, belonging to Mr. Munro of 
Pointzfield, and fome on the N. fide, too, at the place called 

Shinnefs.

Shinnefs. There is alfo, at the fide of the loch, below Shin- 
nefs, the end of a large vein of lime-ftone. 

Population.-Thou g h the face of the parifh is very exten- 
five, it is but thinly inhabited. There has been, however, a 
eonfiderable increafe within thefe 50 years.

Cattle and Produce Cows and horfes cannot well be num- 
bered, as the people's whole ltock lies in them, excepting a 
few meep and goats. They always buy a great deal of grain, 
the land not producing above 8 months bread for the inhabi- 
tants ; for it is much more calculated tor breeding cattle than 
for yielding corn. The only crops are, oats, barley, and po- 
tatoes, and thefe in fcanty portions, as the land is motliy all 
let to fmall tenants, who have neither inclination nor ability 
to improve their farms. 

R en t.—Tbe rent of this, as well as of the parilhes in the 
neighbourhood, is a deep arcanum, known only to faftors, 
who (it mould feem) think, that if the clergy or the publie 
were let into the fecret, they would, by fome legerdemain or 
other, deprive them of the handling of it, or their conilitu- 
ents of the ufe. It is calculated, however, that the grofs rent 
does not exceed 3 50I. or 600I. Sterling. The proprietors are 
the Countefs of Sutherland, Pointzfield, Achany, and Captain 
Mathifon, wadsetter of Shinnefs.

Eccleftaftical State—The l iving is exa£Uj g 00 merks 
Scotch, paid in money, and a glebe. A new manfe is build- 
ing. Small as the ftipend is, it does not all arife from the 
rents of the parifh, 200 merks of it being paid out of the 
lands of Skibo, in the parifh of Dornoch ; which is one evi- 
dence that the rent-roll of the diftrid is not very great. 

Manners and Morals.— Notwithstanding the difadvantnge 
of a rainy climate, furely nothing but that want of induftry, 
which reigns among the inhabitants, could prevent their 
availing themfelves of the lime-Hone they have in fuch 
abundance, for meliorating their land. Refpefting their cha- 
racter, in general, it is not much in its favour, that they feem- 
ed to entertain a particular dread of thefe ftatiftical inquiries, 
and would not permit the minifter of the diflricl to draw up 
an account of it, as if confcious that it could not turn out 
much in their favour. 

Improvements Suggefted — The greateft improvement, of 
which this part of the kingdom is capable, (and indeed it is a 
national concern), is that of making an inland navigation, 
through this parifti, from the E. to the W. fea. It is but 
5 computed miles (or about fi Englifh), from the end of 
Loch-Shin to a navigable arm of the Weflern Ocean. The 
loch, (or lake), itfelf is about iS miles long. It was never 
fathomed, but is fuppofed to be very deep. It is joined to an- 
other fmall loch, out of which the river Shin runs, and enters 
the Moray Frith, an arm of the E. fea. The advantage that 
would refult, from joining the two feas, to the diftri&amp;s in the 
neighbourhood, and to the public at large, need not be dwelt 
upon. It would foon be the means of eftablifhing fiflieries, 
manufactures, commerce and induftry, over all the neighbour- 
hood. Perhaps it might alfo prevent the dangerous and cir- 
cuitous 



of Lairg. 573 

cui.ous navigation through the Pentland Frith And the na- 
tural advantages in its favonr are to ftrong, that the under- 
takers, it is believed, wonld be fuffictently tndemmfied for the 
expence attending it, by the income that * would produce. 
Auother improvement to be recommended ts that o£ convert- 
Z the farms, from a cattle to a flreep ftock for whtch th, 
pariih is particularly well calculated. It would be unoeceffcry 
to remove the prefent poffeffors for thatpurpofe , for unlefs 
they are very ftubom and obftinate indeed, they m.ght eafily 
be prevailed upon to convert their cattle into Iheep ; aud to

■ m of which, there is no difficulty or witchcraft.

and Stirling.') 



Sy the Rev. Mr. James Robertson, JMinifter of that 

Parijh.</head> 



<p>Etymology of the Name. 

npHE etymology of Callander is by fome underftood 
A to be from Calla-ftraid. which is the Gaelic name 
given to it by the common people : Calla, fignifying the 
landing place at the Ferry, where the village is built; and 
Straid, the ftreet or avenue leading from the caftle of Callan- 
der to the fame ferry. By others, it is thought to refer to a 
more remote period than the exiftence of the cattle, or any ave- 
nue in this country, and to be derived from Caldin-doir, which 
is alfo a Gaelic word, and tignifies the hazle grove. From the 
remains of hazle woods in this neighbourhood,. and the aptnefs 
©f this kind of foil to carry hazie and oak, it is probable, that 
mot only this place, but other places, which have a fimilar 
name, originally abounded, or do flill abound with that 
timber. 

jLreSHon. 



cf Callander. $7$ 

Erefiion, tf*.— Callander was formerly divided into two 
parifties, the one called Leney, and the other a chapel dependent 
on Inchmahomo, where the Nories of that ilk had their family 
burying place. The remains of both are viable, and people 
bury at both places. The northern branch of the river, more 
than a century ago, changed its courfe, and feparated the 
church of Leney from part of its parochial bounds ; and the 
fame inundation, in the fouthern branch, fwept away the 
bridge leading to the chapel ; whereupon both pariflies were 
united, and the parifli church was built at Callander, below 
the junction of the two branches, where it now fiands. 

Extent, Situation, and Surface.— The extent of this parifli, 
from E. to W., is about 16 computed miles ; and its breadth, 
at the E. end about 10 miks. Its form is like a lady's fan 
half fpread. It is fituated between 56 0 15' and 21' N., 
and from i° to i° 24' W. of the meridian of Edinburgh, 
including the greateft extent of the mountains. The ap- 
pearance of the country on the W. and N., is mountainous. 
The hills were formerly black, and covered with heath; but, 
by the introdudion of Iheep, within thefe 30 years, they are 
beginning to lofe their fliaggy cover, and to ailume a more 
verdant hue. About Callander there is a beautiful val- 
ley, in which are fituated, not only the villages of Callan- 
der and Kilmahog, but feveral fine farms, in a plain of fome 
extent, which is formed by the confluence of two confiderable 
branches of the Forth, and covered with rich meadows and 
fertile arable land. The higher ground is here and there clad 
with thriving oak woods, and plantations of trees of various 
kinds ; and the bold ftupendous rock, above Callander, di- 
verfifies the fcene, and forms a fine contraft to the valley and 
meandering links of the river below. 



5?6 Siatiftical Account 

Soil, Inclqfitres, &amp;c._ The foil of this diftridt, in general, 
is a light gravel, capable of high cultivation, and making an 
immediate and plentiful return. On the eftate of Leney, 
there is fome rich loam, or haugh land, probably formed by 
the fediment of a rivulet which runs through it, the foil 
being of the fame deep red colour with the earth and rocks 
in the glen above. Agriculture is making rapid progrefs. 
The arable ground is moftly inclofed, either with ftone walls, 
or with hedge and ditch, having, in many places about Callan- 
der, hedge rows, which gives the country a comfortable and 
neat appearance *. 

Romantic Pro/peels. — The Trofacks are often vifited by per- 
fons of talle, who are defirous of feeing nature in her rudeft 
and mod unpolimed ftate. They are iituated about 10 miles 

W. 



* The paring and burning of mofs, and alfo the drill huibandry, in rearing 
leguminous crops, was introduced into this country, about 30 years ago, by Mr. 
Buchanan of Camfmore ; who, by means of reading, extenfive obfervation and 
experience, has not only improved his own eftate, but has, by his example, 
diffufed a fpirit of cultivation through the country, which it never had before. 
The late Mr. Buchanan of Leney introduced the trenching of ground in the 
open fields. He cleared the moft rugged and untoward foil, made good arable 
land, where even the grafs was very coarfe and fcanty. The firft two crops 
paid the expence ; and the ground, completely fubducd, was fitted for future 
profit. The farmers have not generally adopted this plan, either owing to their 
want of capital, the fhortnefs of their leafes, or to their having already as much 
cleared land as they can keep in good order. Some of them, indeed, take in new 
land with the plough, where they muft meet with the fame obftructions of 
ftones, and rocks, and bullies every year. 

The regulations of the late commifiioners of annexed eftates, contributed 
much to improve this country, and to introduce a better ftyle of houfes among 
their farmers and villagers, which has been followed by the country in general.

W. from Callander, and acceffible by a carriage road. A tra- 
veller going by the S. limb of Ben-kdi, and along the fides o£ 
two beautiful lakes, has thefe lakes fometimes concealed from 
his view; and fometimes they appear in all their extent, hav- 
ing their banks clad with a fiicceffion of fields, trees, houfes, 
flocks and herds. One while his road is formed on a bulwark, 
like the key of a harbour, raifed on the very borders of the 
deep ; another while, he travels through darkening woods, 
whofe folemn gloom is fcarcely penetrated by a ray of the 
fun. On the right is the foreft of Gknfinla Si which is green to 
the very top, and was once covered with the deer of the kings 
of Scotland ; on bis left is Ben-venu, which was once a forefl: 
of the family of Monteath, Ben-venu, is called the fmall moun- 
tai^ becaufe it is lefs than Ben-ledi, or Ben-lomond * froni 
which it is almoft equally diftant, forming nearly a ftraight 

line with both. 

When you enter the Trafachs, there is fuch an affemblage 
of wildnefs and of rude grandeur, as beggars all defcription, 
and fills the mind with the moft fublime conceptions. It 
feems as if a whole mountain had been torn in pieces, and 
frittered down by a convulfion of the earth ; and the huge 
fragments of rocks, and woods, and hills,- fcattered in confufion, 
for tw T o miles* into the E. end, and on the fides of Loch-Ca- 
therine. The accefs to the lake is through a narrow pafs, of 
half a mile in length,' fuch as JEneas had in his dreary patfage 
to vifit his father's home, " •va/loquc immanis hiatu" The 
rocks are of a ftupenduous height, and feem ready to cloi'e 
above the traveller's head, or to fall down and bury him irt 
their ruins. A huge column of thefe rocks was, fome years

ago, torn with thunder, and lies in large blocks very near the 
road ; which muft have been a tremenduous fcene to paflen- 
gers at that time. Where there is any foil, their fides are 
covered with aged weeping birches, which hang down their 
venerable locks, in waving ringlets, as if to cover the naked- 
nefs of the rocks. The fenfible horizon is bounded by thefe 
weeping birches, on the fummit of every hill, through which 
you fee the motion of the clouds, as they moot acrofs behind 
them. The end of the lake is nothing but one of the feveral 
bays or creeks, which, on all hands,, run boldly amidft the 
rocks and hills. 

Travellers, who wifli to fee all they can of this lingular 
phenomenon, generally fail W. on the S. fide of the lake, to 
the Rock and Den of the Ghoft, whofe dark receffes, from their 
gloomy appearance, the imagination of fuperftition conceived 
to be the habitation of fupernatural beings. 

]n failing you difcover many arms of the lake. Here a bold 
head-land, where the black rocks dip into unfathomable wa- 
ter ; there, the white fand in the bottom of a bay, bleached 
for ages bv the waves. In walking on the N. fide, the road is 
fometimes cut through the face of the folid rock, which rifes 
upwards of 2cq feet perpendicular above the lake : Sometimes 
the view of the lake is loft ; then it burfts fuddenly on the 
eye ; and a clufter of iflands and capes appear, at different dif- 
tances, which give them an apparent motion of different de- 
grees of velocity, as the fpeftator rides along the oppofite 
beach : At other times, his road is at the foot of rugged and 
iiupenduous cliffs ; and trees are growing where no earth is 
to be feen. Every rock has its echo ; every grove is vocal, 
by the melodious harmony of birds, or by the fweet airs 
of women and children, gathering filberts, in their feafon. 
Down the fide of the oppofite mountain, after a fliower of 
rain, flow a hundred white ftreams, which rufh with in-

credible velocity and noife into the lake, and fpread their 
froth upon its fitrface. On one fide, the water eagle fits in 
majefty, undifturbed, on his well known rock, in fight of his 
neft on the face of Ben-venu ; the heron ftalks among the 
reeds in fearch of his prey; and the fportive ducks gambol on 
the waters, or dive below : On the other, the wild goats climb, 
where they have fcarce ground for the foles of their feet; 
and the wild fowls, perched on trees, or on the pinnacle of a 
rock, look down with compofed defiance at man*. In a word, 
both by land and water, there are fo many turnings and wind- 
ings, fo many heights and hollows, fo many glens, and capes, 
and bays, that one cannot advance 20 yards without having 
his profpect changed, by the continual appearance of new ob- 
jects, while others are conftantly retiring out of fight. This 
fcene is clofed by a weft view of the lake, for feveral miles, 
having its fides lined with alternate clumps of wood and ara- 
ble fields, and the fmoke rifing in fpiral columns through the 
air, from villages which are concealed by the intervening 
woods ; and the profpecl is bounded by the towering Alps of 
Arrochar, which are chequered with fnow, or hide their heads 
in the clouds. The Horu Mrs. Drummond of Perth has 
ere&amp;ed booths of wicker work, in the moll convenient places, 
for the accommodation of ftrangers, who vifit this wild and 
pi&amp;urefque landfcape ; and the tenants of the next farm are 
very ready to fhow the beauties of the place to travellers.

name to the pafs. In one or other of the chafms of this Angular place, there 
lived, for many years, a diftiller of fmuggled fpirits, who eluded the moft dili- 
gent fearch of the officers of the revenue, although they knew perfectly he was

* Dia, which is invariably the name of God in Gaelic, is the fame word, 
both in fpelling and pronunciation, with the name which the Greeks, in the ob- 
lique cafes, gave to the Supreme Being; and it is probable, that all the cafes 
■were originally from this word. Many other inltances of the fame kind might 
be pointed out ; but it will come in our way, in thefe few pages, to find that 
the words fignifying land, a cujllc and harbour, are the fame in Gallic and in 
JLatin ; and the name of the De ity is the fame in Gaelic and in Greek. Wher 
jther the Celtic language borrows the firft from the Romans, and the laft from 
the Greeks, or whether the Romans and Greeks borrowed from the Celtic, (the 
language of a more ancient people than either, and of a more ancient analogy 
than their languages), the reader who underftands the three languages, is left 
to judge.

the people of the adjacent country, to a great difrance, aflemblc-d annually on 
its top, about the time of the fummer folllice, during the Druidical priefihood, 
to worfhip the Deity. This affembly feems to have been a provincial or fynodi- 
cal meeting, wherein all the different congregations within the bounds wifhed to 
cret as near to heaven as they could, to pay their homage to the God of heaven. 
Tradition fays, that this devotional meeting continued three days. The fum-

that place. The Druids were ignorant, it appears, of the life of letters, or ex- 
tremely fhy to commit any part of their creed to writing; but thev were fond, 
in a very high degree, of great and ftupenduous monuments, to mark their re- 
treats, and to perpetuate the remembrance of their devotion. They had ex-

fon obferves, wear away and encroach on the land, in certain places,' while it 
leaves dry ground behind it, where formerly there had been feveral fathoms of 
water. But there is little probability of this ring having ever belonged to the 
fea. It feems rather more probable, that it has been made for tying the dogs 
of chace.when the hunters went to reft during the night; er for the pur- 
pofe of fecuring cattle from ftraying through the mountains, or.to the valleys 
below, where they would have become the prey of wild beafts, before the 
country was cleared of woods and of ravenous animals, which lived on blood. 
We need not be furprifed at this precaution, becaufe there is little doubt that 
the original inhabitants, of this part of the ifland at leaft, took up their firft re- 
iidence on the tops of hilis, however utip'romifing thefc habitations may appear 
now to their pofterity. The veftiges of ridges, where the ground has certainly 
been plowed and fown, are ftill to be feen on places of cd Gderable altitude, 
and even on fome very high mountains, in the Highlands. Ridges, where the 
ground has once been arable, may be traced diftinftly in the immediate neigh- 
bourhood of this ring ; and the place has its name from that circuniitance. There 
is a remarkable hill, which is called the Mountain of Ridges, in the braes of 
Glenlochy, on the eftate of Breadalbane, where the ridges and furrows are as 
vifible and regular in the heath, as though it carried, at prefent, a crop of 
grain. Did our limits admit of it, the inquiry would be curious, to inveftigate, 
how a crop could be raifed in fuch elevated fituations, where no man, at this day, 
could think of bringing any grain, that we know of, to maturity. A country 
covered with wood, is much warmer than after it is cleared and expofed. The 
degree of cold, to which our naked mountains are now laid open, muft be more 
intenfe than when the afli and alder covered every valley, oak and fir the fkirts 
of every hill, and the hardy birch climbed up near its brow; and it is difficult 
to fay what hardlhips a certain kind of oats, whofe hulk is thick, and whofe 
grain is fmall, can endure, with what culture it is fatisfied, and with what 
jiourilhment it is matured.

probably the Druids had a place of worfhip, and Loch-van- 
A- choir, the Lake of the white or fair Valley. The name of 
a farm on the fouth fide is the Fair Valley. This whitenefs is 
different from that afcribed to Ghn-fin-glafs ; and different 
words are ufed to denote them with more precifion. The 
former implies the whitenefs of daizies, or the fair appearance 
of the fummer's clothing ; the latter is defcriptive of the 
bleached whitenefs of long winter grafs ; an accuracy of ex- 
preffion to which many languages are ftrangers, however much 
improved. Thefe three lakes form a chain, conneded by fhort 
intervals, of a moft beautiful river, lined with a variety of 
natural wood, and leading from Callander to the romantic view 
at the end of Loch-Catherine. 

Near the top of Benledi, there is a fmall lake, called LoCHAN- 
NAN-CORP, the fmall Lake of dead Bodies, which got its name, 
from a whole company attending a funeral having dropt 
through the ice, and being drowned, when patting from Glen- 
fin-glafs to the chapel of St. Bridget*. On the north fide of 
Benledi, lies Locft-LUB-NAIG, the 'crooked or winding Lake 
which, in the diftance of 4 miles, forms two or three fine 
f weeps, on the great road to Fort- William. About the middle 
of this lake, there is a tremenduous rock, called Graig-na-co-

between two eftates, and a common name given in the High-

lands to fuch places. Upon hunting days, the two chief: aina 
met there, with their hounds, and followers, hunted about the 
rock in common, and afterwards feparated, each turning away 
to his own property. 

Oppofite to this rock, lies the hunting feat of Mr. Bruce 
of Kinnaird, a part of theeftate of Kzer, where he retired for 
feveral fummers, (as much as his converfation and hofpitality 
allowed him to be retiied), in order to arrange the notes of 
his memorable travels to Abyflinia, which will tnmfmit his 
fame to future ages, when the barking of fnarling critics will 
be heard no more. His knowhdge of the fcriptures, of the 
oriental languages and cuitoms, his acquaintance with the 
whole circle of the liberal arts and fciences, his penetration in 
knowing human nature, his addrefs in fuiting himfelf to un- 
forfeen and incidental circumltances, together with his forti- 
tude of mind, and ftrength ot conflitution, fitted him for an 
undertaking, which, without all of thefe endowments, would 
either have proved abortive, or have been incomplete. The 
grandeur of this fcene fuited the flate of his mind. There he 
found the lake of Dembea in miniature, where the ancient 
tract of a river is covered by a modern lake, formed by inci- 
dental circumltances, as may be feen from the top of any 
neighbouring hill, in a clear day. Lochlubnaig owes a great 
paft of its prefeot depth to its being choaked, at the E. end, 
by ftones and gravel, which are carried down the face of Ben- 
ledi, by torrents, in the Burn of Stank. And, in the time 
of floods, the muddy river, which enters Lochlubnaig at 
the W. end, leaving the circumambient water unfullied, and 
ftagnant, preferves its yellow colour and ftream, in the origin- 
al tract:, for a confiderable way down the middle of the lake. 
Similar appearances take place in the lochs of Balquhidder, 
and many others, where bars are formed, and the water 
thrown back by the like caufes.

if executed by Mr. Boca ana* of Cambufmore, (to whom the

and fometimes formed, by torrents falling, at right angles, into 
rivers which fun in narrow valleys; efpecially where tbeie 
torrents have a long range, contain a great body of water, and 
operate upon loofe and heavy mattr'ials. 

Rivers.— t\W thefe waters meet at Callander, and form a 
frne river, which is called the tffa* £ « the warm River. 
This is the mod cbnfiderable branch of the Forth, both for the 
quantity) of its water, the ftraighthefs of its courfe to the fe.i, 
■ the clearnefs'of its ftream, and the variety and number of its 
filh. Mr. Guthrie, in his Geographical Grammar, and Mr* 
Nimmo, in his Hiftory of Stirlingfhire, call this branch by the 
name of Forth ; although the fouth branch more commonly 
gets that name. None of our rivers are navigable within the

Stirling of Kier, which rife of a proper breadth, ring well, 
Hand the carriage, and refill the influence of the weather for 
any length of time. The inferiority of the flate at Kerinoeh, 
on the property of Mr. M'Nab of M'Nab, is chiefly owing, 
not to any want of metal, but to their being lefs beautiful* 
and fmaller in the fize. The purple flates at Tombea, the 
property of Mr. Drummond of Perth, being lefs durable than 
the other two kinds, fell at 15s. the iooo, while the others

Moray, which rife frequently 6 feet fquare, not above i£ or 
1 inches thick, and very fmooth ; yet, from their toughnefs, 
they are eafily carried to a diftance, and ufed for malt kilns,

this country, thefe flags were ufed for. covering houfes; par-

all in one mafs, occaficned by the aftion of fome mineral, it 
is difllcult to determine. The rock above Callander is wholly 
compoted of this cemented (tone. The vein of it is of no great 
breadth, hut extends in the direction of S. W. and N. E., to 
the diftance of many miles, through lakes, and rivers, and 
mountains, and valleys. The pebbles, which are inclofed in

but of fri&amp;ion. They are of different colours ; fome white, 
fome blue, and fome gray, and moftlyof the roundnefs of field

pearance, being all of one colour, and uniformly brown. This

neighbourhood ; becaufe the Hones in the huh, on the E. and 
W., are of a different fpecies 5 and becaufe, if the rock IQ 
queftion had been in fufion, the ftream would have taken the 
direclion of the valley, which it has not done. 

All that is requifite farther to be mentioned under this article* 
is, that this fingular kind of cemented rock, together with the Jlatt 
and the lime /tone, run in three parallel veins, at the diftance of 
aftatute mile from each other, not only acrofs this ijarilh, but to 
a great diftance on both fides. The ftratum of flats reaches from 
Lufs toDunkeld, making its appearance above ground atleaft in 
8 different places ; the lime-ftone, from Buchanan to the pa-, 
riih of Comrie, and appearing in as many places ; and the 
plumb-pudding rock, from Gartmore to Crieff, and vifible on 
the furface almoft the whole way. There fecms to run paral- 
lel to thefe on the E., a chain of free-ftone, from Gartur, 
through Rujlde, T'orry, and Drumvaich, to the vicinity of 
Crieff. It is probable that thefe parallel lines of rock may 
extend much farther, and may be taken notice of by others,

Cafcade — In the glen betwixt Brackland and Achinlaicb, 
there is a bridge on the water of Kelty, confining of 2 flicks, 
covered with a few branches of trees and fome turf, which is 
abundantly romantic and dangerous. The fticks are laid 
acrofs the chafm, with their ends refting on the rocks, which 
projeft on oppofire fides, about 50 feet high, above a deep pool : 
On the one hand, the white cafcade precipitates itfelf, from a 
height above the bridge, with a tremenduous noife, occafioned 
by the conflicl of the rocks, the narrownefs of thepafiage, and 
the lofty column of water, whofe fpray often wets the clothes 
of paflengers. On the other hand, the winding glen, which 
deepens as it defcends, the gloominefs of the hanging rocks, of 
the lhading trees, and black pools, ftrikes with terror and with 
awe. Yet the people of the adjacent farms, from the mere 
forpe of habit, pafs and repafs with very little concern ; al-

Cove. — There is a large cove in a mountain, on the confines 
•f the parilhes of Callander and Kilmadock, where lawlefs peo- 
ple ufed to hide themfelves, after committing depredations on 
the adjacent country. The mountain itfelf is called Udh Vbr* 
i. e. The Great Cove ; but the defcription of it is left to the 
account of Kilmadock parim. 

Climate and Longevity*— The air is falubrious in a very 
high degree. There are no local diftempers ; and people live 
to a very great age. A woman died lately, who was faid to 
have been 101 years of age. A man is ftill alive, who is 99, 
and tolerably vigorous. A few years ago, he was able to earn 
his bread, by driving a horfe and cart, and carrying lime to the 
farmers in the neighbourhood. Several married people have, 
of late, lived together near 60 years. Some of thefe are ftill 
alive. 

Population The number of inhabitants in the different 

farms, was greater about half a century ago than it is now ; 
yet the general population o£ the parifh is daily increafing,

fyftem, wherever it took place, the barons valued themfelves, and were valued 
by the ftate, not by their rental, but by the number of their followers. The 
objec~r, therefore, of every great man, in thofe times, was to have his eftate 
crowded with inhabitants ; and all his farms were fplit down into many divifions 
and fubdivifions. But, upon the decline of this fyftem, the farms were generally 
given to one of the moft wealthy of the former tenants, and all the reft compel- 
led to fin ft for themfelves, or to become cottagers. 

1 While the farms in the Highlands continued in tillage, thefe fuperior farm- 
ers flood in need of the cottagers to cultivate the ground as fervants and labour- 
ers; and they were allowed a fmall pendicle and fome cattle, befides a little 
money, in name of wages. But when flieep began to be introduced, thefe fmall 
poffell'ors were i'wept entirely away, and all the bufinefs of the farm was ma- 
naged by a fhepherd or two, and three or four dogs. What remedy had the 
pcor then ? None furely, but either to emigrate, or to crowd into villages, or to 
beg. Thofe who had money to pay their paflage, left their native country, 
and carried away their riches; fome, who had no money, bartered their fer- 
■vices, for a number of years, to obtain a paflage ; and others, of lels fpirit, the 
dregs of the people, in this predicament, have remained at home, and have 
fought an afyium in villages. 

This is no ideal picture of the times. That it is more or lefs the cafe, in 
many parts of this kingdom, and that it is daily increaling, is undeniable. But 
in this part of the country, we feel not the full extent of the calamity. The 
farms, in this parifh, are let at a moderate rent ; and the practice, of ciigrofliii* 
many' into one, has not hitherto, owing to the good fenfe of the proprietors, 
taken place ; although it has come very near our doors. Our grafs farms, in 
the mountainous part of the diftricr, are thinly inhabited, but not depopulated, 

as is the cafe in the fouth and weft of Scotland.

, and s in Scotland. But where the people were moft crowded and the ^landlord 
had leaft money, there depopulation has made the wide* j£ 
nran race has been fwept away as with a peftilence. In the fouth or Scotland 
there are many towns, to which the people could refort ; but in the Weft 
Highlands, there are few towns of any conference. The people therefore 
in that large traft of country, from Kintyre to Rofs, who are difpollelT d of 
their farms! have no alternative, but to crofs the Atlantic, if they have Cpiut 
or wealth; or to travel fouthward, till they pafs the Grampians, if they be 
poor. The villages of this place, and other villages in fimilar fituatlons are 
filled with thofe naked and ftarving crowds of people, who are pouring down 
every term, for fhelter and for bread. And what is to be the fate of villages, 
crowded by (hangers, who have neither money, nor arts, nor indulry, I leave 
to others, who have more political forefight, to determine. 

One thing is certain, on this point, that the proprietors, who eredl vdlages 
on proper plan, in order to keep their countrymen in the kingdom, deferve 
better of the public, than thofe who fet them adrift, without the leaft feeling of 
remorfe ■ Yet the condudl of thefe humane gentlemen ought to be regulated by 
a cautious prudence, even in gratifying their feelings of companion. And a 
hint may be taken by the wife, from whatever quarter it comes, efpecially when 
it is given with fiheerity, and has a tendency to do good. 

Whenever the population of any town or village exceeds the induftry of the 
inhabitants, from that moment the place muft decline. When their confump- 
tion is greater than their earnings, when their wants are not fupphed by their- 
labour, the ftock of the fociety muft decreafe, and many undue prattices muft 
be fub'ftituted for the honeft means of procuring fubfittence. The body politic 
may be vitiated, as well as the natural body. If its corpulence is too much in- 
creafed bad humours prey upon the conftitution, for want of exercife j habits

Villages.— The proprietors of the villages of Callander 
and Kilmahog, are extremely defirous to find employ ent 
for their refpeftive people. Kilmahog has not increafed fo 
much of late as Callander has done. In the former, the houfes 
are not the property of the poffeffors ; but new houfes, of a 
better conftrudtion, are frequently built, and a few acres of 
ground are given to each family ; upon which, with their own 
indultry, they are enabled to live with comfort and with eafe. 

In 

of indolence eradicate every defire of exertion; the whole frame is corrupted; 
^defpondency enfues; and mifery, mingled with contempt, produces the direful 
effects of defpair. Many inftances might be mentioned ; but every perfon of 
obfervation can quote abundance for himfelf. It is a wife maxim, therefore, t» 
increafe the population of villages, providing the people are rendered iduftrious; 
otherwife, it is the greater! curfe that can befal a place. Thriving villages 
afford a ready market for whatever the farmer has to fell ; and, in return, pro- 
vide him with artificers and labourers, and many other conveniences, which he 
ftands in need of; befides, that it is to thefe nurferies of the human fpecies, 
properly conftituted, we are to look forward now, for men to recruit our army 
and navy in the hour of danger, while our hardy peafantry are decreafmg 
daily. 

f We have no data to afcertain, with accurac)', what the population was 
15 years ago. None have emigrated in whole families; but forae young men 
have gone to the Weft Indies and America as furgeons, clerks and teachers ;, 
feveral artificers have been tempted to go to Glafgow ; and fervants have gone 
to the fouth and eaft country, by the profpect of high wages.

\n the latter, the ground is feued in fmall lots*; and the proprie- 
tor neither wants the means, nor the inclination, to employ 
the people. The village of Callander is laid down after a re- 
gular plan, built fubftantially with ilone and lime, and cover- 
ed with blue flates. A beautiful river runs between the old 
and the new part of the village, over which there is a large and 
convenient bridge, with roads branching out in all direftions. 
Aftupendous rock rifesonthe N.ftuck full of firs, and a variety 
Of natural wood, wherever there is any foil between- the fhelves, 
which affords protection to the village from the cold. Over 
this rock occasionally falls down a white ftream of water, 
feveral hundred feet high ; ail which gives the place both a 
pidturefque and an elegant appearance. — Including the foldiers 
fettlement, (which confifls of houfes built by government, for 
penfioners, after the Peace of Paris, in the year 1763), the 
number of families in Callander is 190. The mode of giving 
feus is a rood of ground, or one 4th of an acre, in property, 
upon paying 7I. 10s. of a premium, and 5s. of feu duty yearly, 
together with an acre of arable ground, a rood of meadow or 
bog hay, and two cows grals, in the common pafture, for rent 
and the liberty of mofs, common thatch and flones, free. 
Some time ago, no premium was paid ; but the feu duty was 
6s. 8d., and the property redeemable. This village has in- 
creafed greatly within thefe 30 years. 

In the village of Kilmahog, there are about 48 families. 
The inhabitants have lohgleafes, which encourages them, with 
the afliftance of the proprietor, to erect better houfes than 
formerly. This village is beautifully fituated on a plain be- 
low the proprietor's manfion. At its W. end, the wood of 
Leney forms an amphitheatre, which covers the front of the 
hills j and the tumultuous noife of the cataract at the Pafs of

Church — One of the principal ornaments of the beautiful 
village of Callander, is a new church, which was built about 
18 years ago, with a pavilion roof, and a fpire over the pedi- 
ment in the front f . It is happily fet down, in the centre of 
the place, and at a proper diftance from the road. The prin- 
cipal expence was defrayed by the late commiffioners of an- 
nexed eftates, and the plan defigned by Mr. Baxter, architecl. 
the manfe was built in ihe year 1773 ; and is all in good or- 
der, except the weft gable, which the heritors are propofing 
to repair, before it go into fuch difqrder, as to create a heavy 
expence. The ftipend is 50I. in money, 2 chalders of meal, 
and 1 of bear, befides a glebe of 9 acres, including grafs. Mr. 
Drummond of Perth is patron. The prefent minifter was 
admitted in 1768, is married, and has a numerous iffue*. 

Schools. — On one fide of the fquare before the church, the 
fchool is fituated ; where the learned languages, geography, 
elements of aftronomy and perfpe£Hve, are taught by one 
mailer; writing, accounts, drawing, geometry, book-keeping, 
navigation, and the elements of mathematics, by another. The 
terms are very moderate. About 80 boys, from different 
parts of Britain, and from abroad, attend. There is alfo a 
fociety fchool in the parifh. 

Poor. — The poor, upon the public roll of the parifh, are 
30. The funds for afiifling to maintain them, are the public

all to about 4 «1. yearly. Thefe matters are managed, both before 
and fince the affeffment was given up, by the kirk-feffion The 
Charity of the inhabitants, in general, and of thofe in the vd. 
lage of Callander, in particular, is eminent. The heritor, 
did, fome years ago, adopt a .plan for fupporting their own 
poor, by an equal affeffment on the landlord and tenants, ac- 
cording to the valuation 5 but the people could not be rettmn- 
Cd from ferving beggars, and fome were refraftory in paying 
their proportion of the affeffment { fo that the plan was dropt. 

Proprietors and Rents.— The number of heritors is 9. Three 
pf them are refident. The valued rent is 3,2781. i«. Scotch; 
the real rent is 3000I. Sterling, at leaft. The rent paid foe 
one acre, or for a few acres, efpecially in the vicinity of the 
Villages of Callander and Kilmahog, is 20s. at an average. 
But in large farms, and on old leafes, fome arable land is rent- 
ed under 5s. the acre, after allowing a proper deduaion foe 
the pafture or hill ground. The extent qf the farms is from 
J2l. 1 col. to per annum. 

Markets.— The greateft fair is held on the 21ft of March, 
or the 10th old ftyle, which is called Fil-ma-chejfaig, or the 
feftival of St. Kejfaig. There is another great fair on the 16th 
of May, for black cattle, where the drovers find excellent ac- 
commodation for themfelves and their cows, and are relieved, 
by Mr. Drummond ©f Perth, irom impofts and feveral incon- 
veniences, which are met with in other places, befides various 
marks of attention which he dire&amp;s his friends to pay to 
them. There are 3 fmaller fairs for country bufinefs. 

Horfes. — The horfes are generally of a middle fize, between 
the Highland poneys, and the heavy draught horfes of the 
Low Country. Their number is 350. They are fure-footed, 
full of fpirit, and can endure incredible fatigue. 



59 S Statical Account 

Black Cattle.^ breed of black cattle is, in general, in- 
fcnor in lhape and pile to the Argvll.ftnre or lile of Sky cows, 
but fupenor to tholV, in the low parts of the north of Scot- 
laud. Their number is about 2400. When properly fed 
they give plenty of milk, and bring between 5I. and 61. a 
pkcc, in the market. 

***** and G°ats. About 20 years ago, the farmers began 
to flock with iheep. At that time, the number of (keep was 
*coo; now it is 18,000, all of the black-faced kind. They 
are generally fmeared in the beginning of winter. The lambs 
are often attacked, on the approach cf their firft winter, by the 
Iraxy, a difeafe which feems to be of the nature of the gaftritis. 
Goats are not fo numerous as formerly. 

Wild Quadrupeds and Birds—Red deer come here for food 
and fhelter in fevere winters. Roes breed in our woods. 
Hares, rabbits, foxes, wild cats, badgers, otters, moles, pole- 
eats, we. fles, and black martins, are alfo to be found here. 
Our domeftic, migratory, and water fowls, and birds under the 
denomination of game, are the fame as in other places of this 
country, as well as our birds of prey. 

Fi/h.— Salmon are found in the Teath, and in the northern 
branch thereof, all the way to Ealquhidder. They are more 
rare in thefouthern branch, owing probably to the large pikes 
in Loch Vennachoir and Loch Achray, which are enemies to 
other fifh. Trouts abound in all the lakes and ilreams of this 
parilh ; and pars in every ftream. Whitlings t which fome 
filhermen fay are young falmon, and which others reckon a 
diftincl fpecies of trout, are common in the Teath, in July and 
Auguft. Char have been difcovercd in Lochlubnaig; and, 
when pickled, are found to equal any from the lakes in the 

north.

north of England. They live in the bottom of deep waters, am! 
cannot eafily be caught, without the feine or net. The Englifb, 
char have two rows of fpots upon their fides; thofe of Loch- 
lnbnaig only one. They are alfo found in fome other lakes in 
the neighbourhood. Pikes or jacks are very numerous ia 
Loch Vennachoir and Loch Achray, in the fouthern brand* 
of the Teath, and in fome ftagnant pools near Callander. Thej 
grow to a large fize, and are frequently caught weighing from 
12 lb. to 20 lb., of 1 6 ounces, each. They may be taken at 
all feafons with bait, for which par are efteemed befl ; but 
they are mod efteemed in June, July and Auguft. Eels are 
in all the It ill waters where the bottom is muddy. Minnows 
are rather fcarce, being probably devoured by the larger fifli. 

Pearls In the Teath are found confiderable quantities of 

mufcles, which fome years ago, afforded great profit to thofe 
who fiflied them, by the pearls they contained, which were fold 
at high prices. The pearls were efteemed in proportion to 
the gloffy finenefs of their luftre, their fize, and fhape. Some 
of the country people made 100I. in a feafon, by that em- 
ployment. This lucrative fifhery was foon exhaufted ; and 
it will require a confiderable time before it can be refumcd 
with profit, becaufe none but the old fhells, which are crook- 
ed in the fhape of a new moon, produce pearls of any value. 

Pearl Fijhcry. — They are fiihed with a kind of fpear, con- 
fiding of a long fhaft, and fhod at the point with two iroa 
fpoons, having their mouths inverted ; their handles are long 
and elaftic, and joined at the extremity, which is formed into 
a focket, to receive the fhafr. With this machine in his hand, 
by way of Uaff, the- filher, being often up to the chin in water, 
gropes with hia feet for the mufcles, which are fixed in the

face of the water. He has a pouch or bag of net work hang- 
ing by his fide, to carry the mufcles till he come afhore, where 
they are opened. The operation is much eafier in mallow water, 

"frees. — The oak is the moft numerous and the moft valu- 
able of our trees. Our oak woods bring, at ah average, about 
J5,oool., at every cutting, to the different proprietors, once 
in 24 or 25 years. The oak bark is generally fold to the 
tanners, on the Frith of Forth,* at from is. 2d. to is. 6d. per 
ftone. Our oak woods have lately been peeled to the ground, 
and no vifible bad confequence has followed that practice ; 
whereas formerly, they were only peeled to the 1 ax or place 
where the tree is cut. The alder and the am abound here. 
We have bird cherry, willows of various kinds, and mountain 
afh. The bark of the two laft is ufed in tanning leather, a- 
long with oak bark. The bark of the latter is a powerful 
aftringent, and is faid not to be much inferior to the Peruvian 
bark. Our moft numerous and extenfive plantations are of 
Scotch fir, or pine. Although there are whole forefts of this 
fpecies, which grow naturally in the north of Scotland, yet, 
on the foulh fide of the Tay, few or none are to be found 
planted by the hand of nature. Larch thrives exceedingly well,- 
and grows much taller than any other timber we have. Spruce 
firs, filver firs, New-England pines, elms, beeches, walnuts, 
fweet chefnuts, horfe chefnuts, white poplars, balfam poplars, 
afpens, laburnums and hollies, have been planted here, and thnva 
well. The laurel Qaurus nobilis) bears well the fcventy of 
the Winters, and flowers every year. The Ihrubs and under- 
wood of this parifh are much the fame with thofc around it. 

Grain.-ln this parifh two kinds of oats are cultivated ; 
early oats, which yield lefs meal j and the late, or old Scotch 



of Callander, 60 1 

oats, which generally yield a boll of meal for every boll of 
grain. Barley is the moft valuable crop raifed by the farmers 
in this diftrift. That which has two rows in the ear is the 
beft grain, and is commonly called barley ; that which confifts 
of four rows, is more prolific in light foils, and affords more 
bolls upon an acre. The Ruffian barley of fix rows, and the 
naked or Siberian barley, have been tried, but have fallen into 
difufe, on account of the fmallnefs of their profit, and the bad- 
nefs of the ftraw. 

Green Crops, &amp;c We have two kinds of peafe ; the one 

early, and the other late. Wheat is not much cultivated. 
Flax is raifed in confiderable quantities, and makes good re- 
turns. Potatoes are cultivated to a great extent ; and have 
very much fupplanted the turnips as a fallow, where barley and 
grafs feeds are to be fown for the fucceeding crop. The graffes 
fown are rye-grafs, red, white, and fometimes yellow clover, 
and narrow plantane or rib grafs. 

Agriculture.— The foil of this country is by no means rich ; 
but it is capable of great improvement, and makes good re- 
turns. The ftyle of the farmers houfes is much improved 
within thefe ao years. In this diftri&amp; the farmers often plow 
their ground with two horfes, which the ploughman drives

Mills$ \3c — We have a lint mills, 4 meal- mills, r for bruif- 
ing lint and rapefeed, 1 fulling mill for woollen cloth, and r, 
threfhing mill for grain;, and- 3 kilns, with yetling y ox call iroa 
floors, for drying grain. 

Improvements — One material regulation, which tended 
greatly to the improvement of this country,, was dividing the 
large farms into as many lots or divifions as there were te- 
nants, and fe ting down every man on his own lot, inftead of 
having two or three ploughgates, all run-rig, as formerly. 
By this pradice, the floven was left behind, while the induftri- 
ous farmer beautified his lot, and enriched himfelf. A great 
extent of new ground has- been cultivated,, and rendered arable. 
Mr. Buchanan of Cambufmore has at prefent rich grafs on 
corns on feveral hundreds of acres, where heath, knee deep,, 
ufed to grow. 

Wild Plants. — The moft obnoxious weeds are* thiftles, (fer-* 
ratula), wild muftard, dock, fpurry (fpergula arvenfis~), bi- 
lhop-weed, cow-parfnip, fitches (vicca Jepium), cow-thiftle y 
mugwort, coltsfoot, or' tullilago, triticum repens, avena fterilis, 
daitylis glomerata. The principal officinal herb is the uva 
wji, which grows in great abundance on the face of the hill 
above Stronedragon, in Brea-Leney. Several others are to 
be found, which are common almoft every where in Scotland.- 
—This parifh- affords a good field for the botanijl. A great 
variety of fpla&amp;inums, niniums, bryums, hypnums, lichens, 
junger mmnnias, trcmillas, agarici, volcti, and other fungi, are 
to be found. No plant, except what belongs to the clafs

Mr. Lightfoot in his Flora Scotica. 

Seed Time and Harveft — Our feed time is regulated by the 
Teafon. Oats and peafe are generally fown about the begin- 
ning of April, and flax-feed towards the latter end of it. Po- 
tatoes are planted alout the beginning of May ; the barley, 
with or without grafs feeds, about the middle of May; turnips 
in June. The flax is pulled about Lammas,, or the middle of 
Auguft; the barley is reaped by the beginning of September ; 
the oats and late peafe about the middle, and towards the end. 
of that month. The late potatoes are ripe about the fame 
time ; yams a little later ; but the early potatoes are ready 
'in July *. 

Prices of Grain, Provifions and Labour. — -The barley is 
generally fold at from 15s. to 18s. per boll, Linlithgow mea- 
sure; the oats from 13s. ^d.to 16s.; the fown hay at6d. and the 
bog hay at 3d. per Hone. Butcher meat fells at from 3d. to 
*id. per lb., according to its quality and the feafon of the year. 
Lamb generally brings a higher price. A man fervant, who 
'is mailer of his bufinefs, is hired at yl. or 81. Sterling, and a 
maid fervant at 3I. a yearf. Day-labourers receive is. a day.

ticles were ftated at greater length ; but the author being now employed at the 
defire of the BOARD of AGRICULTURE, to draw up a general view of the 
prefent ftate of the ftock and hufbandry of Strathern, and the Fouthern parts of

within as moderate bounds as poffible.

of cheefe, and the wages of fervants, are tripled, in this coun. 
try, within thefe 40 years: partly owing to the improved, 
ftate of the country, and partly to the influx of money from 
the Eaft Indies. This rife in the articles of living does not 
affeCt the landed intereft, becaufe their rents rife in propor- 
tion; neither does it materially affeCt labourers, manufacturers 
or farmers, becaufe the prices of their labour, and of their 
commodities, rife in the fame degree ; but to individuals, or t© 
claties of men who live upon ftated annuities, fuch as the mini- 
flers of the Eftabliftied Church, thefe are ferious matters. The 
fame domeftic expence, which they could eafily have fupported 
about 40 years ago, upon an income of 50I., cannot, at this 
day, be fupported upon thrice that income. They muft there- 
fore fall back daily in the fcale of fociety : And there is no 
remedy, unlefs the Court of Teinds are pleafed to adopt an- 
other mode of procedure, by opening decreets, at Ihorter inter-* 
vals, or the Legiflature to interfere, to refcue them from pe- 
nury, which always begets contempt. 

Manufa&amp;ures, &amp;c — There are no fervices exaCted from the 
farmers in any part of this parifli. There are no manufac- 
tures upon extenfive plans, or earried on by companies, upon 
a joint ftock. Woollen and linen yarn is much fpun by the 
poor, for fale. The carpet manufacturers in Stirling buy up 
the woollen, and the Glafgow manufacturers the linen yarn, 
The fervants, and the children of farmers are all employed, 
(when they have no labour in the fields), in fpinning thefe 
kinds of yarn, partly for fale, and partly for their own ufe. 
.All that is wanted, to eftablifh manufactures here, is a proper 
plan, and fome perfon or company of credit to be undertakers. 
Wool has become the ftaple of this country of late years. We 
have alfo fine ftreams to drive machinery, of any weight 
neceffary in the linen or cotton bufinefs, and plenty of proper 

fields,

fields and the fofteft water for bleaching cloth. And if a 
perfon of knowledge, in any of thefe branches, and otherwife 
li a good charafter, were to offer his fervices, it is well 
known, that Mr. Drummond of Perth would meet his wifoes ; 
by affording him every accommodation, and by gffijhng him 
otherwife, on reafonable terms. 

Police. -The gentlemen are very attentive to the police of 
the country, as far as the prefent influence or interpretation 
of the law renders their endeavours fuccefsfnl. Yet there are 
many petty crimes which mull finally pafs with impunity, 
which are very hurtful to fociety, becaufe they do not incur 
the higher penalties of the law ; crimes, hurtful to fociety and 
contagious in a high degree, which fcarcely come within the de- 
fection of a breach of the peace, which neither the public pro- 
fecutor for the crown, nor any private profecutor have any con, 
cern with ; and if a magtftrate mall be fo public fpirited, as, out 
of regard to the morals of the people, to commit perfons guilty 
of thefe crimes,he generally gets the conftables to payout of his 
own pocket, for his pains ; and thefe oorrupters of fociety return, 
in a few days, with a brazen countenance, more hardened in 
vice, and »ore intent upon corrupting others, than they were 
before *.

lord to be careful to accommodate the public, Mr. Drummond

and to the terrors of a jail, to thofe who have either the ingenuity to keep 
within the law, and elude its penalties, or who have no ' reluctance to be fup-

Antiquities — The charter of the family of Leney, which 
at prefent, is reprefented by Mr Hamilton of Bardowie, is ? 
very lingular. Alexander II., on the 2 S th of Odober, in 
the 23d year of his reign, which correfponds to the 1237 year 
of the Chriftian sera, confirmed by a written charter, Atano de 
Lani et Margarita de Lani, the poffeffion of this eftate, which 
had been formerly granted by king Calenus to Gillefpic 
Moir de Lani, mi/iti, to be held, virtvte Gladii parvi. This 
charter is not only a cur.iofity for its antiquity, but it appears 

from. 



* The licences to retail fpirits are too eafily obtained. While many taxes, 
which fall very heavy on the poor and induftrious, are necefiary for the fupport 
of the public expence, thefe tippling houfes, in a great meafure, go /cart free, 
There is perhaps .as much duty laid on the malt, and on diftillery, as they can 
bear and be .productive ; but the retailers of fpirits, in ; loiv houfes, are very 
tenderly dealt with. A guinea or two, upon every licence to fell fpirits of any 
kind, and in any quantity, and upon any road 4 would bring a prodigious reve- 
nue to government, and amend the morals of the people. And it is better in 
a'll cafes to prevent, than to punifli crimes. Dramming is not only a luxury 
but a pernicious luxury. Many of our luxuries have a tendency to make us 
more induftrious ; but when will the feller or drinker of drams be induftrious J

the farm of AcUnlaich, a circular rampart, on the fummit of 
a rifing ground, and in the vicinity of a deep chafm formed by

place of no great fecurity j were it not,, that the adjacent

behind it, where the water can fcarcely be feen,. for projecting 
rocks and hanging trees, afforded, at all times, a near and fafe

* This charter al'fo proves, that the date of royal charters was not, in thofe 
ages, afcertained by the year of God, but by the year of the king's reign ; 
which was the practice of the Jews, who referred to a particular yearof the king's 
reign, as well as of the Romans, who referred to the confulfhip of particular 
perfons ; and likewife, that more ancient grants were t in the fimplicity of thefe 
ages, proved by the poffeffion of particular relics ; fuch as the gladius parvus*

different languages.

\ If this fortification be of Danifh conftruction, thefe rovers muft have ufed

But if it was ufed by the natives, it was probably intended, not only to fecure

There are the remains of an old caftle at the manfe of Callan-

* This ftrong hold feems to have been erected, not only for the protection of 
the inhabitants, when they were actually invaded, but as a watch tower, to- 
give the alarm in the profpect of danger. It commands the raoft extenfive 
view towards the E. and is well feen from Dunmait, near Stirling, which place, 
from its name, Dun-7i;a-it, (contracted for Dun-tna-chit, the hill of the 
good profpetf), and, from its lituation, may have been another poft for alarming 
the people ; and Dunmait may have got the fignal of danger from fome other 
place farther E. There are, in many valleys, which ftretch into the Grampians, 
not only from the champaign country in the E. of Scotland, from which quarter 
an attack was, for feveral reafons, generally made, but in all other directions, 
the veftiges of watch towers, of rude workmanfhip,, to be found. They were 
fituated not far from the dwellings of fome of the inhabitants, on the face of 
the hills, and placed zigzag from the one fide of a valley to the other, and 
running generally far into the country. By means of fire lighted on thefe 
towers, the whole inhabitants could be alarmed, tr a great diltance, in a few 
minutes. 

In Breadalbane, there aie three of thefe, one at each end of Loch-Tay, on 
the S. fide, and one about the middle, on the N.; by means of which all the 
people in that tract of country, from Benmore to Weem, confifting of near 4* 
miles, could be put on their guard, on any fudden emergency ; and it is likely 
that other fimilar pofts communicated with thefe, down to Dunkeld, or far-

James I. or It, and given to the Livingftons, who were after- 
wards created earls, by that title. They either enlarged or 
rebuilt the caftle*, and infcribed the name of their own fa- 
mily, and the year, on the door-head. This land was fold to 
the family of Perth, about the year 1630, in whofe poffef-

that the ftrong band which took place, and is fo much admired in old buildings, 
is not owing to any intrinfic or fuperior quality in the lime of thefe times ; but 
to the precaution of pouring, into every courfe of the wall, liquid mortar, of 
ncwjlacked lime, while the building was going on. The calcined ihells were 
carefully kept from rain or moifture, Under a proper cover, and taken in fmall

f Our fathers had an uncommon predeliction for building their churches, 
and having their burying ground in places furrounded with waters, and often in- 
acceflible by reafon of the floods. Yet we ought not to judge ralhly of their 
conduct ; for mankind, in general, feem, at every period, to have reafoned with 
the fame degree of accuracy, and exerted the fame penetration, concerning 
their own fitualion, independent of the ufe of letters] In the earlier ftages of 
fociety, man had a hoft of foes to contend againft ; and the tribes of carnivorous 
beafts, which might be afraid to attack him when alive, would often, when fti. 
mulated by the cravings of a voracious appetite, attack the manfions of the 
dead, and difturb the repofe of man even in the lonely grave. And if man-kind 
found it neceffary to have thefe places of fecurity, to protect their bones from 
the ravages of wolves, boars, and other beafts of prey, they would naturally, 
be led to confecrate.a place, for the worfiiip of the Deity, near to their burying, 
ground.

There is neither the one nor the other here ; no ditch or foflu. 
The bank itfelf has a great deal of more earth, than any mound 
that furrounds any Roman camp, in this part of the world ; 
and therefore altogether unneceflary for refilling any mode of 
attack, which was pra&amp;ifed at the time the Romans paid their 
vifit to this country. It is a beautiful waving bank, formed 
by the hand of nature, covered with a variety of trees, and 
fbrubery, and having a well dreffed terrace on the fummit, 
whofe fucceffive curvatures, whofe waving fwells and hollows, 
put the prefent peffeflor, Captain Fairfoul, in mind of the roll- 
ing waves in the Bay of Bifeay. There are feveral fuch banks 
on either fide of the river, both above and below that place; ak 
though they have not attracted the notice of mankind, by being 
covered with wood, nor winding in fuch beautiful meanders.

the Romans. There are alfo many compounded names of places in England, 
of which ceftcr makes a part. It is however probable, that thefe places had 
fuch names before the invafion of Julius C^sar, becaufe the ifland was well 
peopled, and becaufe the inhabitants, but more efpecially the Caledonians, had 
not fuch refpedl for thefe plunderers of the -world, or fuch knowledge of their 
language, as to borrow the names of places from them.

Ari-vuri-cbeardich, the Jhealling of the Moravian tinker i Every place of 
this country, in the early ages, abounded in wood, and there are veftiges, in

into rude implements, which were neceffary for the ufe of the inhabitants. 
—If we allow the authenticity of what Scot of Scotftarvet fays, in his 
Hi/lory of Scotland, that the county ef Moray was fo named from a num- 
ber of Moravians who fettled there, and that they were an a&amp;ive and in- 
genious people, thefe Germans very probably imported the art of working 
in caft- iron, pradhfed it themfelves, and went up and down through the coun- 
try, teaching their art to the inhabitants : And in the intervals of peace, when 
national induftry was encouraged by the ftate, confidering the difficulty of get- 
ting iron from abroad, fome of them might have been fettled by government, 
at Ari-vuri-cbeardich. The Gaelic always applies the word which fignifies 
tinker, to one wh« Works in caft iron ; and the word which fignifies ajmiib, to 
6ne who works in iron that is malleable. 

Broc-lan, full of badgers, a farm where thefe animals ftill abound.

Bincan, a peak rifing behind the Trofachs, which feems to be all 
that remains, in its original fituation, of the mountain from which the 
Trofachs were formed. It is very Angular,, from the fmallnefs of its cir- 
cumference, and the altitude with which it puflies its head up into the 
clouds. This word is the diminutive of bei?i, a mountain. The dimi- 
nutives in Gaelic, are moftly formed by adding the fyllable ean, or an, 
to the end of mafculine, and ag to feminine words, with fometimesa fmall va- 
riation of the preceding vowels, for foftening the found. The language of a 
people is always fmooth or rugged, harmonious or harfli, correfponding to the 
tafte of that people for mufic, and to the nicety of their ear. The Gaelic pays 
particular attention to this circumftance, although it has the appearance of be- 
ing altogether guttural to a (hanger: Thefe gutturals are omitted in pronouncing 
it, being preferved only, in order to afcertain the derivation, and point out the 
root of the word. Some late improvements, attempted in that language, are 
picking out the brijllcs, to give it a fmoother appearance to the eye, without 

feeming.

The perfons of each teufe are diuinguifhed, n»t by dif- 
ferent terminations of the verb, but by adding pronominal 
particles to each perfon, both in the fingular and plural num- 
bers (Z). The third perfon fingular of every tenfe has 
genders, or admits of a mafculine and feminine particle affix- 
ed (c). The moods, in a ftrid fenfe, are the indicative, the 
imperative, and the infinitive. Some mode of exprefling what 
is called the fubjun&amp;ive, mull be in every language. In 
Gaelic, it differs from the indicative only by the addition of 
one fy liable to the verb, and a conjunction before it (d). The 
imperative has no more than the fecond perfon in both num- 
bers (?). The action of the third perfon is expreffed by the 
fubjun&amp;ive, whether it implies command or defire (/*). 
The infinitive is frequently ufed as a fubjunclive noun, ex-

jmarians, the mod learned in thofe languages which have 
theneareft affinity to the Gaelic, have exploded every conjuga- 
tion, except one ; or have acknowledged, at leaft, that more 
than one are unneceffary, becaufe the reft are only modifica- 
tions of the fame verb, and declined in the fame manner (z). 
Thsre are no more than one declenfion, unlefs we call the 
mafculine words one, and the feminine another. The cafes 
of nouns are marked, not by additional terminations, but by 
different particles, which are peculiar to each cafe, and gene- 
jally a change of the laft vowel in fome of the cafes (-£). The 
genitive is often known by the conftruBion. When one fub- 
ftantive governs another, the accent is put on the laft fyllable 
of the preceding word, with fome change in the vowels ; 
which, without any poffeflive particle, mows that the follow- 
ing word is underftood to be in the genitive cafe. Two fub- 
ftantives, pronounced with the fame tone, are of the nomina- 
tive cafe ; but the accelerated pronunciation always denotes 
the poffeffive. This, conftruction is called by grammarians, 
who treat of it, the Jtatus abfolutus and the ftatus conftruBus 
of words (/). The degrees of comparifon are formed, not 
by adding certain fyllables to the end of the adjectives, but by 
placing before them ; for the copjparative, an indeclinable 
word, fignifying a higher degree of their quality ; and for the 
fuperlative, either another indeclinable word, denoting their 
higheft degree, or very frequently a repetition of the pofi- 
tive -(ni)- *.

General ChamBer—The charter of the people is various ; 
but, in general, both here and along the eaftern fide of the Gram,' 

pians, 

and the examples of each, for the fake of illuftration, added ; but perhaps to 
fome perfons, what has been already faid may appear too much, while others 
will fee, in the conftitution of this language, a very ftriking affinity to the 
Eaftern languages, in fome of their moft diftinguifhing peculiarities. Such a 
ftrong likenefs, and clear analogy, cannot poflibly be the effeft of chance. To 
the candid, who are at pains to trace it with induftry and impartiality, it mull 
infer a near propinquity in thefe languages, and an origin from the fame fource. 
This is the manner of reafoning with regard to the analogy between the ori- 
ental languages themfelves ; and it is univerfally allowed to be conclufive. 

Evidence of this nature, founded on proofs drawn from the fimilarity or the 
derivation of a few words, are generally regarded with fome degree of fufpi- 
cion ; but fuch a ftriking analogy, in the very conjiitutional and fundamental 
principles of languages, and that in fo many particulars, is a very different kind 
of proof; and, in all cafes, implies a family likenefs, which is fairly and fully 
recognized, and carries conviction to the mind. 

This conviclion is ftrengthened, if it be allowed, on the credit of Ezekiel, Stra- 
bo, Jofephus, Bochart, Diodorus, Cxfar, Tacitus, and others, (and I know not 
how their teftimony can be refufed), that the Celts and Scythians were one 
great people, or that they frequently mixed together, as they advanced in their 
progtefs, and in the neighbourhood of each other, from AGa to the weftern 
boundaries of Europe ; and that they had a near affinity, both of kindred, and 
of language, and manners, being fprung from Gomer and Magog, the 
grandfons of Noah, by Japhet. Thefe fons of Japhet were the firft coufins of 
Eber, the father of the Hebrews. Their family language mufl have been ori- 
ginally the fame, and their claim to antiquity equally well founded. 

While tribes continue unmixed with people of other tongues, their language 
continues pure : But when empires are overturned, and fierce invafions take 
place, the natives and foreigners, the invaded and invaders, are, in a courfe of 
years, blended together, and their languages, however different, are melted 
down in into one tongue. This has introduced a confufion into modern lan- 
guages and nations; by their being compounded of different races, and of a 
mixture of different words and idioms, from which more ancient languages 
and an unmixed people are altogether free. 

The emigrations and feparations of the fame people, into different nations and 
tribes, introduces indeed different dialects of the original language, but never 
£he mixed language, which follows from a mixture of heterogeneous peoples and

tribes of mankind appear ever to have been more jealous of others, or more de- 
firousof preferving themfelves a diftinft people, and every thing diftind, that 
belonged to them, than the Celts and Hebrews.-But I haften to drop this fub- 
j'ecL 

The Gaelic, being the language of a people by no means refined, muft ne~ 
ceffarily appear as defeclive as the languages of other nations in the fame ftate 
bf foeiety. Languages are not invented by pbilofophers, and formed from theo- 
ries, nor by nations in the more pdlilhed ftages of foeiety; but by men engaged 
in the bufieft fcenes of life, and in the infancy of foeiety. In the rude ages, 
the wants of men are few, and their ideas limited : Their language co^efponds 
with their fituation. They have no ufe for words to exprefs, either circumftances 
which do not occur, or ideas which they have not acquired. Their language is 
abundantly copious for themfelves. In the progrefs and more refined ftages of fo- 
eiety, when arts and fciences, and commerce anfi luxury, are introduced, a nation 
muft have new words to exprefs thefe ; and they generally borrow the words 
and phrafes, from the people who are their inftru&amp;ors in the innovations intro- 
duced. They alfo learn, by degrees, to exprefs themfelves with more preciGon, 
even with regard to time: Hence not only a multitude of new words, but a. 
greater variety of moods and tenfes, in their verbs. 

"■ Even the Greek and Latin, which are accounted the moft perfect languages, 
I abound in modes of expreffing time, have fewer original tenfes than one 
would at firft fuppofe, Their compound tenfes are nothing elfe but certain 
participles, coupled with an auxiliary verb. And thefe compound tenfes in the 
paffive voice, and fome of their derived tenfes in the active, together with fuch 
a' variety of moods, were not, in all probability, invented at the time of forming 
the language, but when the language was improved, and while the foeiety was 
advancing from barbarifm to refinement. The fame ftruclure takes place in 
French and Englifli ; and may be owing to the fame caufe. The Greek that 
was fpoken by Jafon and his Argonauts, in queft of the golden fleece, and the 
Latin fpoken by the Romans', in the Sabine war, may have beeri as defective, in 
all refpecfls, as the Gaelic, in the days of Offian. This poverty, therefore, is not 
a fault of the language, but the unavoidable lot of every language, fpoken in 
the fame ftate of foeiety. And a language muft continue for ever ban en, when 
books are not written in it, to bring it upon the anvil of the critic, or when the 
tide of fafhion runs in favour of another language, whenever the ftate of foeiety 
begins to be imnroved. '■

while they have relinquiflied much of the pride of the latter! 
They are fait acquiring the diligence and attention neceffary 
in the agricultural (late of fdciety, and are in a great meafure 
free from the vices of great towns *, The people are humane, 
affectionate, and polite. But if the enlargement of farms is 
introduced, and the country depopulated to make room for 
fheep, the inhabitants muft emigrate, or croud to villages : 
And if villages are increafed, without due regard to their po- 
lice, their employment, and their manners, it were mnch better 
for the people, and their country, that they had never feen 
a village, but had remained in the fimplicity of rural life, 
■wrapped in their plaids all day long, as their fathers were, on 
the brow of a hill, attending their cattle, and compofing 
fonnets. 



'Peculiar Gujlomr — The people of this diftrift have two cuf- 
toms, which are fall wearing out, not only here, but all over 
the Highlands, and therefore ought to be taken notice of, while 
they remain. Upon the firfl: day of May, which is called Bel- 
tan, or Bal-tein day, all the boys in a townlhip or hamlet, 
meet in the moors. They cut a table in the green fod, of a 
round figure, by calling a trench in the ground, of fitch circum- 
ference as to hold the whole company. They kindle a fire, 
and drefs a repair, of eggs and milk in the confiftence of a cuf- 
' tard. They knead a cake of oatmeal, which is toafted at the 
embers againft a none. After the cuftard is eaten up, they 
divide the cake into fo many portions, as firnilar as poflible

in this parifli in the memory of man. No perfon was ever known to be hanged

to- one another in fize and fhape, as there are perfons in the 
company. They daub one of thefe portions all over with 
charcoal, until it be perfectly black. They put all the bits of 
the cake into a bonnet. Every one, blindfold, draws out a 
portion. He who holds the bonnet, is entitled to the laft bit. 
Whoever draws the black bit, is the devoted perfon who is 
to be facrificed to Baal*, whofe favour they mean to implore, in 
rendering the year produdive of the fuftenance of man and 
beau. There is little doubt of thefe inhuman facrifices hav- 
ing been once offered in this country, as well as in the eaft, 
although they now pafs from the ad of facrificing, and only 
compel the devoted perfon to leap three times through the 
flames ; with which the ceremonies of this feftival are clofed. 
The other cuftom is, that on All-Saints Even, they fet up 
bonfires in every village. When the bonfire is confumed, the 
afhes are carefully colkaed in the form of a circle. There is 
a ftone put in, near the circumference, for every perfon of the 
feveral families interefted in the bonfire; and whatever ftone 

is 



* Bal-Uin fignifies the fire of Baal. Baal, or Ball, is the only word in Gaelic 
for a globe. This feftival was probably in honour of the fun, v/hofe return, in his 
apparent annual courfe, they celebrated, on account of his having fuch a vifible 
influence, by his genial warmth, on the productions of the earth. That the Ca- 
ledonians paid a fuperftitious refpect to the fun, as was the practice among 
many other nations, is evident, not only by the facrifice at Baltein, but upon 
many other occafions. When a Highlander goes to bathe, or to drink waters 
•ut of a confecrated- fountain, he muft always approach by going round the 
place, from eajl to ivejl on the fouth fide, in imitation of the apparent diurnal 
motion of the fun. When the dead are laid in the earth, the grave is approach- 
ed by going round in the fame manner. The bride is conducted to her future 
fpoufe, in the prefence of the minifter, and the glafs goes round a company, in 
the courfe of the fun. This is called, in Gaelic, going round the right, or the 
lucky way. The oppofite courfe is the wrong, or the unlucky way. And if a 
perfon's meat or drink were to affect the wind-pipe, or come againft his breath, 
they infeantly cry out deijl.'ealt which is an ejaculation praying that it may go 
hy the right way.

is moved out of its place, or injured before next morning, tne

fuppofed not to live twelve months from that day. The peo- 
ple received the confecrated fire from the Druid priefts next 
morning, the virtues of which were fuppofed to continue for 
a year. 

Stature and Manner of Living.— The inhabitants of this 
diftrid, are neither remarkable for the tallnefs nor the fliort- 
nefs of their feature. They are, in general, well fliaped ; and 
very few or none deformed from their birth. A common la- 
bourer, who earns is. or is. 3d, a day, is thereby enabled, to- 
gether with the induftry of his wife, to bring up 5 or 6 child- 
ren, with very little help 'from the public. By the time the 
children are 8 or 10 years of age, he hires them out to attend, 
cattle, infummer, and puts them to fchool in winter. His 
earnings buy meal for the whole family ; and a few potatoes, 
which he raifes on a fpot of ground, that he rents with his 
houfe, and a cow's milk, enable them to pafs the winter com- 
fortably. / 

• Advantages . — This diftricx has the advantage of being lituated 
on the great military road, which leads from Stirling to Fort- 
William, and of having 5 fairs in the year. The merchants 
of this country, being near the Highlands, have the firft offer 
for all the commodities in which they can fupply the places 
beyond them ; and its vicinity to the Low Country, enables it 
to partake of the plenty which there abounds. The fchool 
brings a good deal of money to the place, by the refort of 
boarders, end of families, who take lodgings in and about Cal- 
lander, for the education of their children. Some genteel fa- 
milies take fummer quarters for the benefit of the goat whey : 
And although the grain is no more than adequate to the con- 

l fumption 



of Callander. 623 

fiimption of the inhabitants, yet there are fo many fheep and 
cows, fo much wool and yarn, befides the produce of the dairy, 
fold off every year, that they can fupply themfelves abundant- 
ly, and have a furplus to pay their rents. This place lies 
fo'near the cattle markets at Doune, and in that neighbour- 
hood, that our graziers have not only a ready fale for then- 
own cows, but can let any remainder they have of grafs, in 
their parks, to great advantage, both while the drovers from 
the Highlands are going forward, and when any cattle remain 
unfold, from one market to another. 

Difadvantages.— The principal difadvantages are, that the 
coals are 18 ftatute miles didant ; and that lime is but 2 miles 
nearer, if our quarry at Leney fhould dip fo much that it can- 
not be wrought, which is very probable ; that the village of 
Callander may increafe fader than the induftry of the people ; 
and that the growing luxury of the times, efpecially in the 
articles of drefs, may, unlefs it be f up-ported by honed labour, 
drive them to ufe improper means to fupply their artificial 
wants. There is a communication opening between this place 
and Comrie, and the countries adjacent to it, on the N. But 
this line of road is incomplete, unlefs the road from Callan- 
der to Thornhill, and the Bridge of Frews, be put in proper re- 
pair, and the direction, in many places, changed. The two 
countries would then be more conne&amp;ed, and the reciprocal 
benefit of both advanced in a high degree ; which is evidently 
the intereft of the fuperiors of Thornhill and Callander, and 
of the country at large. 

Means of Improvement The mod apparent means of ame- 
liorating the circumdances of the people of this place, are the 
introdu&amp;ion of fome public works ; either the fpinning or 
weaving of wool, upon a larger fcale; the fpinning of cotton, 

the 



***4 Smiftlcd Account 

the bleaching of linen, or the printing of cotton clothe f; 
But we cannot exped to fee the manufafture of cotton 
at home, meet with the encouragement it ought, as long 
as the monopolizers of cotton goods from the Eaft In- 
dies have fuch a weight in the public councils of the na- 
tion, unlefs the firmnefs, and the public fpirit of the mi- 
niftry interpofe, in behalf of the manufaaure of their 
own country. In the infancy of any trade, monopolies 
may be neceffary for its profperity ; but, in its advanced 
ilate, monopolies are its ruin, and that of the country to which 
it belongs. Our flates, too, might be carried to the more of 
Stirling, to which we have a fine road. Markets might 
be eftabliflied for the fale of flieep, at proper feafons, in 
the fame manner as for cows, and we might have a cow- 
market in the fall, the fame as on the 15th of May. A great 
many more Scotch firs mould be planted. Such is the pre- 
fent fcarcity of this wood at Callander, that a cubical foot of 
it fells as dear in this place, as that from the Baltic, at the 
more of Stirling. If the village mail be increafed farther^ 
Scotch firs or larches, of all kinds of timber, are the moft necef- 
fary for that purpofe ; and there is plenty of watte ground, unfit 
for tillage, and yielding very little pafture. Inoculation might 
be rendered more general, and many lives faved to the public, 
if any method were devifed for having it performed to the poor 
gratis. The furgeons of Edinburgh deferve great praife in 
this refpecl. Out of thefe princely donations, which the Society 
for Propagating Chriftian Knowledge in Scotland, have lately 

received, 

f Since October 1791, when this account was fent to Sir John Sinclair, the 
weaving of cotton has been introduced into the village of Callander; and about 
zoo looms are employed. Two tambour fchools, for the flowering of cotton 
•goods, have alfo been eftabliflied, -which afford employment to upwards of ico 
r| r ls. And, had it not been for the check that credit has received in fpring 
1793, it is probable thefe branches would have advancsd with rapidity, ae the 
people difcover a great eagernefs to be employed. _

received, fomething might lardy be done, in this way ; either 
by allowing a trifle to the i'urgeon of the bound?, where there 
is one, for every poor fcholar on their eftabliftrtnent, that was 
inoculated; or by employing a few furgeons, in their own pay, 
evh to inoculate the poor in a certain diilrift ; or by caufing the 
iuoft intelligent of their fchoolmaftefs to be inRrufted for this 
purpofe. If the women inoculate in the eaft, (as we are told 
they do), fchoolfnafters certainly might, with very few leflons, 
be taught to do it here ; and if the falaries are to be increafed, 
this would be a moft laudable duty, in return for the increafe 
of falary. The funds of this fociety are faid to be one of the 
belt managed public flocks, of the fame capital, in the Britiili 
dominions; and from the known character of the members,' 
Mho are fo high already in the efteem of the public, that no' 
account of their qualities is neceffary here, it might not per- 
haps be foreign to the objed of their inftitution, for a few 
years, until inoculation became general, to bellow lome at- 
tention in promoting f he health and preferring the lives of 
their poorer fcholars, while there is fo much done to enlighten 
their minds, and to reform their morals. The number of 
dogs might be diminifhed by a judicious tax. There are mere 
ufekfs dogs, than what coniume three times the quantity of 
food, which would maintain the whole poor. The number 
of dram houfes is out of all bounds too great. Thefe haunts of 
the idle, of the prodigal and profane, contaminate the mo- 
rals of the lower claffes of the people beyond del'cription. A 
poor widow mult pay a tax, before foe can obtain a candle to 
give her light, in fpinning for the fupport of her fatherlefs child- 
ren; and yet a dram-feller, it feems, can get a licence, under 
the fanclion of law, for little more than one milling, to cor-

policy. It is very doubtful, whether perfons can be constitu- 
tionally detained, hj force, in this country, and prevented from 
transporting themfelves and their effefts, wherever they are 
inclined. Unlefs, therefore, the legiflature can interfere, ia

finglafs, falls at right angles into the river thatiflues from Loch- 
Achray. The impetuofity of the ftream has collected fuch a

the Earl of Moray and the Hon. Mr. Drummond of Perth; 
who certainly might find their intereft in laying out the ne- 
ccflary charges.

Britannia fits already on a folitary rock, hangs down her 
head, and, with her eyes bent towards America, me de-
